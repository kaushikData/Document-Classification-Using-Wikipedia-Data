      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">An '''account manager''' is a person who works for a company and is responsible for the management of [[sales]] and [[Customer relationship management|relationships]] with particular [[customer]]s. An account manager maintains the company's existing relationships with a client or group of clients, so that they will continue using the company for business. The account manager does not manage the daily running of the account itself. They manage the relationship with the [[Customer|client]] of the account(s) they are assigned to. Generally, a client will remain with one account manager throughout the duration of hiring the company. Account managers serve as the interface between the [[customer service]] and the [[sales]] team in a company.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; They are assigned a company's existing client accounts. The purpose of being assigned particular clients is to create long term relationships with the portfolio of assigned clients. The account manager serves to understand the customer's demands, plan how to meet these demands, and generate sales for the company as a result.&lt;ref name="Barry"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Handbook_of_Model_Job_Descriptions.html?id=z6R_uExfMGAC
 |title=Handbook of Model Job Descriptions |author =Barry.C|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Key accounts''' provide the most business because they contain a small number of clients which contribute a large portion of the company's sales. According to research, sales from a company's key accounts have increased from 23% in 1975 to 60% currently.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130815025753/http://members.chiefexecutive.com/display_article.asp?id=37111 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-08-15 |title=The Evolution of Key Account Management |author=Phill J. |year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responsibilities==
The responsibilities of an account manager can vary depending on the industry they work in, size of the company and nature of the business. Each [[customer account]] can vary in demands and an account manager may work with [[brand manager]]s for one account and a media department for another. Account managers usually report directly to the account director or agency director of the activity and status of accounts and transactions. An account manager may also manage a single account or a variety of accounts depending on the requirement of the company. Although the responsibility can vary between companies and between accounts, there are a shared set of common responsibilities which are as follows:

# Generate sales for a portfolio of accounts and reach the company's [[sales target]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Identify new sales opportunities within existing accounts to retain a client-account manager relationship by [[up-selling]] and [[cross-selling]]&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Manage and solve conflicts with clients&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; The Account Manager is expected to have specific information regarding daily operations of the Company and keep the Client updated.
# Interact and coordinate with the sales team and other staff members in other departments working on the same account&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt;
# Establish budgets with the client and company&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Meet time deadlines for accounts&lt;ref name="sam"&gt;{{citation |url=http://salesmanagement.org/web/uploads/docs/0a8e2f77635dbfc5e2c2663404582988.pdf|title=Strategic Account Manager|author =The Sales Management Association.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are situations in which an account manager, for example in advertising firms, is responsible for more than one account and therefore looks after multiple clients. When account locations do not overlap the account manager can be placed at the divisional, district, or territory level. When a sales team has a senior sales manager, the account manager coordinates sales accounts from other departments or specialties.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZYKyKAxpUvwC&amp;pg=PA102 |title=Sales management: a global perspective |author1=Earl D. Honeycutt |author2=John B. Ford |author3=Antonis C. Simintiras |year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this scenario, the sales team will work under the direct supervision of influencers and deciders instead of with a [[buyer]].&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

* '''Global account managers:''' Manage company accounts worldwide. This typically occurs in large companies with international accounts.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;
* '''National account managers:''' Manage numerous accounts nationwide. This typically occurs in medium to large companies when a company has multiple locations across the country.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

Global account managers and national account managers may work together in a hierarchical or matrix structure. The trend is to move responsibility for the major key accounts to the global level.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt;

==Key account manager==
Key account manager is assigned to a company headquarters to oversee the account team assigned to a particular account.&lt;ref name="Honeycutt"/&gt; Key account management includes sales but also includes planning and managing the full relationship between a business and its most important customers. An account manager who works in this role will engage in a variety of tasks including [[project management]], coordination, [[strategic planning]], [[relationship management]], negotiation, leadership and innovative development of opportunities,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YutAr0bk2OUC&amp;pg=PA294 |title=Key Account Plans |author1=Lynette Ryals |author2=Malcolm McDonald |year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and keeping record of transaction of sale and purchase goods. The tasks may include working with [[product design]] and application, [[logistics]], sales support, and [[marketing]].

==Key account management models==
The basic assumption for a key account management model is the correct classification of the key accounts. A basic model often used in the period of 1950-1970 was the classification model of Webster. This model has been adapted by Milman and Wilson into a two-dimensional model and was paramount in the period of 1970-1990. Bensaou has tested this model empirically by his research of [[carmaker]]s in the [[Automotive industry in the United States|United States]] and [[Automotive industry in Japan|Japan]] and made revisions. De Blick synthesized the adaptations into the 4S-model, a key account classification model.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |editor=Sloan Management Review volume 4 issue 4|title=Portfolios of buyer-seller relationships|author =M.Bensaou, |year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1990s, key account management spread to most B2B ([[business-to-business]]) models.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Global_Account_Management.html?id=QEwXt2F3GssC&amp;redir_esc=y |title=Global Account Management |author =Peter C.|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work environment==
Account managers can work for small or large companies either corporate, financial, retail, or government for instance.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Any company with a specific clients they conduct business with, can employ an account manager. Typical employers can be: 
#Direct marketing consultancies and agencies
#Marketing departments 
#Major commercial organizations

Account managers usually work in an office setting and can work more than 40 hours weekly. Travel is usually included in the job description. National or global account managers will very likely experience extra travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://davidmaister.com/articles/key-account-management/
 |title=Key Account Management |author =David.M|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Qualifications==
Although personality and an [[business acumen|aptitude for sales]] is key, a degree in business, marketing, or related field is typically required and depending on the nature of the account, a background in marketing or [[media studies]] may be preferred.&lt;ref name="Barry" /&gt; Due to each company having different requirements, it is important to obtain information from each potential company of employment.

Both versions was launched by [[Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah]], Malaysia's Former Finance Minister and also the Founding Chairman and CEO of Petronas in April 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tengku Razaleigh' Speech at RMPM Book Launching|url=http://tengkurazaleighhamzah.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=339:rich-malaysia-poor-malaysians&amp;catid=50:blog&amp;Itemid=131|website=Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah applauded Anas' intellectual discipline in completing the writing which he describes as demanding mental toughness, tenacity and absolute patience. Policy makers, scholars and corporate figures are of the opinion that the views and ideas presented in the book can be usefully adopted for the formulation of policies by political parties and the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians|url=http://www.gerakbudayaebooks.com/store/p27/Rich_Malaysia,_Poor_Malaysians.html|website=GERAKBUDAYA ebooks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Energy, the book touches on how Petronas plays it roles in its significant contribution to the country. It also explains the history, the regulations and mechanism used and the secret behind Petronas’ success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Are We In Fact Poor?|url=http://www.bfm.my/current-affairs-are-we-in-fact-poor-20140207.html|work=BFM: The Business Radio Station}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On economy, the book introduces the Malaysia's inequality dilemma, the myth of the rich and poor, high income nation versus low income citizen, the Malaysia's hollow economy conundrum and addresses issue on the foreign workers, education and healthcare. It also explains the concept of free trade, its pros and cons .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=‘Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians’ shows the economic reality|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/leisure/2014/01/14/rich-malaysia-poor-malaysians%E2%80%99-shows-the-economic-reality/|work=Free Malaysia Today|date=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On education, the book advocates revisiting the national education philosophy, the introduction of the Love Pedagogy, promoting reading and critical thinking culture, the introduction of philosophy. It also touches on volunteerism and how the third party can become an agent of democracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia's spectacular drop in inequality – for real?|url=https://www.malaysiakini.com/news/315933|work=Malaysiakini|date=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book also offers insightful proposals and shares a way out for the problems facing the country.

The book was a bestseller for more than six months at Kinokuniya and Borders and is arguably a tour de force in the local intellectual landscape, as a venue for ideas that bridge policies and the hopes of the people, the responsibility of educators and the potential of their students and more important the problems of the present and the potential of a brighter future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title='Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians'|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/251000|work=Malaysiakini|date=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 11th May 2017, [[:ms:Arshad Ayub|Tan Sri Arshad Ayub]], Father of UiTM and former deputy of Malaysia's Bank Negara launched the new and expanded edition of Rich Malaysia, Poor Malaysians. He was accompanied by [[Anuwar_Ali|Emeritus Professor Tan Sri Anuwar Ali]], Former Vice-Chancellor of Open University Malaysia and Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia, Tan Sri Dato' Ahmad Fuzi Abdul Razak, Secretary-General of the World Islamic Economic Forum and [[Ghauth_Jasmon|Professor Tan Sri Dr. Ghauth Jasmon]], former Vice-Chancellor of Universiti Malaya.

Tan Sri Arshad Ayub highlighted that Malaysia's 60th year of independence is the precise moment that Malaysia is to return to the drawing board. He argued that Anas has initiated the process by bringing forward a multitude of original ideas encompassing energy, economy, and education based on his analysis on the state of the nation and he urged the government, politicians, the civil society, and policy makers to take heed of Anas' powerfully brave book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2017/05/12/malaysia-a-success-story-says-former-bank-negara-deputy-governor/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The expanded book is an updated version with 13 additional chapters providing a more holistic coverage on fundamental issues that are currently plaguing Malaysia on healthcare, the foreign workers, environment, the hollow economy, green technology, woman empowerment and others.

==Non-governmental organisations==

Anas is a co-founder of BLINDSPOT,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysia's Vicious Inequality and Proposed Actions To Remedy It|url=http://www.mtuc.org.my/malaysias-vicious-inequality-and-proposed-actions-to-remedy-it/|work=Malaysian Trades Union Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt; a socio-economic think tank, a group of concerned citizens voicing out the voice of the voiceless - presenting critical, informative data and facts often missed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Details of TPPA in a month - Nation {{!}} The Star Online|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2015/10/07/details-of-tppa-in-a-month/|work=www.thestar.com.my}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anas was formerly a Founding Chief Executive Officer on the board of Teach for The Needs (TFTN),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Leaving an [i]MPACT - R.AGE|url=http://rage.com.my/leaving-an-impact/|work=R.AGE|date=2 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a non-profit education-based civil society organisation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Malaysian Education Blueprint 2013-2025: A lacklustre framework - The Rakyat Post|url=http://www.therakyatpost.com/allsides/2014/04/21/malaysian-education-blueprint-2013-2025-a-lacklustre-framework/|work=The Rakyat Post|date=21 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which houses 1,000 volunteers, 300 university students and adopts 12 orphanages.

==Controversies==
In 2013, Astro Awani named Anas as Top Ten social media influencers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=2013 10 personaliti media sosial paling berpengaruh|url=http://www.astroawani.com/berita-malaysia/2013-10-personaliti-media-sosial-paling-berpengaruh-27427|work=www.astroawani.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, The Malaysian Insider named Anas through Teach For The Needs (TFTN) as Inspiring person of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=In the race for straight As, a movement teaches kids the most important values|url=https://sg.news.yahoo.com/race-straight-movement-teaches-kids-most-important-values-025806756.html?pt=tAD3SCT8P7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Anas has also been giving public talks and forum nationwide. His rise to fame and his published book came to attract one made up political allegations by a blogging website that he had a secret affair with a female politician, a foreign citizenship and Islamist alliances. However, nothing substantial has been proven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Azizan|first1=Hariati|title=The numbers guy - The Star Online|url=http://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2014/05/18/the-numbers-guy-as-cofounder-of-bantah-tppa-he-has-been-at-the-forefront-of-public-talks-and-meeti/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8304">'''Anita Eugenie McCormick Blaine''' (1866-1954) was an American [[philanthropist]] and political activist. An heir to the McCormick Reaping Machine Works fortune built by her father, [[Cyrus McCormick]] (1809-1884), Blaine was influential in subsidizing the launch of a number of progressive political causes, including Chicago's Francis W. Parker Elementary School, the [[New World Foundation]], the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party (1948)]], and the radical New York newspaper, the ''[[National Guardian]].''

==Biography==

===Early years===

Anita Eugenie McCormick was born July 4, 1866, the third of five children born to [[reaping machine]] inventor and industrialist Cyrus McCormick and his wife, the former Nancy Maria "Nettie" Fowler.

Working upon lessons learned from failed efforts by his father, the [[Virginia]]-born Cyrus McCormick had worked to construct a mechanical grain-harvesting device from an early age, fabricating his first crude machine in 1831, when he was just 22 years old.&lt;ref name=Harrison10&gt;Gilbert A. Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair: The Life of Anita McCormick Blaine.'' Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1979; pg. 10.&lt;/ref&gt; After putting down the project for a time, McCormick returned to refine his mechanical reaper in 1842, beginning to sell the first few commercial machines in that year.&lt;ref name=Harrison10 /&gt; McCormick moved his operation to [[Chicago]] in 1848 and within five years was well on his way to becoming a prosperous industrialist.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pp. 10-11.&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of Anita's birth, the family fortune exceeded $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anita was born in the East but the [[Great Chicago Fire]] of 1871 pulled the McCormicks back to Chicago to help rebuild the family franchise.&lt;ref name=Harrison18&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Her early education was by means of private tutors.
&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/anb/9780198606697.article.1500066 "Anita McCormick Blaine,"] American National Biography Online, oxfordindex.oup.com/&lt;/ref&gt; From her early teenage years, McCormick was educated at Misses Grant's Seminary, a conservative [[Presbyterian]] religious institution financially supported by McCormick and his fortune,&lt;ref name=Harrison18 /&gt; and at Miss Kirkland's Academy, a pedagogically progressive, though economically elite private school, from which she graduated high school. Her enlightened ideas about education in later life seem to have begun there.&lt;ref&gt;Papers of Kirkland School, Chicago Historical Society&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Educational activity===

Spending much of her time in New York and Europe, Anita McCormick returned to Chicago in October 1887, in the wake of the [[Haymarket Affair]] and the growth of [[Hull House]] and the municipal reform movement.&lt;ref name=Harrison48&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; She became involved in the work of the [[Howe Street Mission]], a philanthropic institution in which young and poorly educated [[working class]] women could gather in the evenings to learn sewing, cooking, and other skills and attend informational lectures.&lt;ref name=Harrison48 /&gt;

McCormick felt that the instruction of the Howe Street Mission was largely ineffective and in 1888 she branched out to form a [[settlement house]] of her own, renting a nearby apartment building to serve as a meeting place for women and hiring a destitute widow to manage the facility.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; McCormick's new facility taught cooking and garment-making, an provided a library for reading as well as musical opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 51.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1880 Anita McCormick had met Emmons Blaine (1857-1892), a railroad executive and son of former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] politician and presidential candidate [[James G. Blaine]].&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pp. 52-53.&lt;/ref&gt; The pair were married in September 1889, with the union between the politically prominent Blaine and wealthy McCormick clans making national society news.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pp. 61-62.&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had one child, a boy, Emmons Blaine, Jr. (1890-1918), prior to the senior Blaine's sudden death of an intestinal ailment at the age of 35.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pp. 66, 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1890s, Anita McCormick Blaine's attention turned to public education, spurred by the forthcoming need of her own child to gain a competent, practical education. Blaine turned a room of her own house into a 10-student [[kindergarten]] in 1893, beginning the educational process of her 3-year-old son at home.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 85.&lt;/ref&gt; She immediately began to look outward for further education, becoming acquainted with [[Francis Wayland Parker]], an educational innovator whose [[Chicago Normal School]] trained young teachers in child-centered educational methods which emphasized "illustrative teaching" using pictures, models, and field trips as well as physical education and crafts over rote memorization methods.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Blaine was instrumental in establishing a school on Chicago's North Side based upon Parker's educational ideas and she would remain a patron of the educator, sponsoring a series of lectures by him in her living room and publishing the talks as an 1890 book, ''The School and Society.''&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 87.&lt;/ref&gt; She would also come to sponsor a teachers' college in Chicago, making a nearly $30,000 commitment over a 5-year period.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, ''A Timeless Affair,'' pg. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The effort would eventually be realized as the School of Education of the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref name=Castledine32&gt;Jacqueline Castledine, ''Cold War Progressives: Women's Interracial Organizing for Peace and Freedom.'' Urbana, IL: University of Illinois Press, 2012; pg. 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peace activity===

In the years after the conclusion of [[World War I]], Blaine became a leading public advocate of the [[League of Nations]] as an international mechanism for the maintenance of world peace.&lt;ref name=Castledine32 /&gt; Following the collapse of the League, Blaine was supportive of the foreign policy efforts of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], based upon collective security against the spread of [[fascism]].&lt;ref name=Castledine32 /&gt;

Following [[World War II]], Blaine was supportive of the [[United Nations]] as a world peace institution.&lt;ref name=Castledine32 /&gt; She also became a leading financial benefactor of former Vice President [[Henry C. Wallace]] and his effort to launch the anti-[[Cold War]] [[Progressive Party (United States, 1948)|Progressive Party]].&lt;ref name=Castledine32 /&gt;

===Later years===

In 1954 Anita McCormick Blaine launched a civil rights organization known as the [[New World Foundation]] with a $7 million behest.&lt;ref name=NWFStory&gt;[https://newwf.org/milestones/founding-story/ "Milestones: Founding Story,"] New World Foundation, www.newwf.org/&lt;/ref&gt; The organization was deeply involved in subsequent years in the effort to end [[racial segregation]] in the American South.&lt;ref name=NWFStory /&gt;

===Death and legacy===

Anita McCormick Blaine's papers are housed [[Wisconsin Historical Society|Wisconsin Historical Society Archives]] at the [[University of Wisconsin]] in [[Madison, Wisconsin|Madison]].&lt;ref name=Papers&gt;[https://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/999463885902121 "Anita McCormick Blaine Correspondence and Papers, 1828-1958,"] Wisconsin Historical Society Archives, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; The voluminous material, which includes Blaine's correspondence and writings, is incorporated in 939 archival boxes, 16 cartons, 9 bound volumes, and 1 oversized folio and is open to researchers for in-library use.&lt;ref name=Papers /&gt;

[[File:Coat of Arms of the Lee Family.svg|175px|thumb|right|Coat of Arms of Arthur Lee]]

'''Arthur Lee''' (20 December 1740 – 12 December 1792) was a physician and opponent of slavery in colonial Virginia in North America who served as an American diplomat during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. He was educated in medicine and law at the [[University of Edinburgh]] and in London, respectively. After passing the bar, he practiced law in London for several years. He stayed in London during the Revolutionary War, representing the colonies to Britain and France and also serving as an American spy to track their activities. After his return to Virginia, he served as a delegate to the Continental Congress.

==Life==
Born in Virginia, Arthur Lee was the youngest son of Hon. [[Thomas Lee (Virginia colonist)|Thomas Lee]] (1690–1750) and [[Hannah Harrison Ludwell]] (1701–1750). Three of his five surviving elder brothers, [[Richard Henry Lee]] (1732–1794), [[Francis Lightfoot Lee]] (1734–1797) and [[William Lee (diplomat)|William Lee]] (1739–1795), also became Revolutionary-era diplomats.

He attended [[Eton College]] in England and studied medicine at the [[University of Edinburgh]], where he graduated in 1764. The title description of his thesis is: Dissertatio medica inauguralis, de cortice peruviano: quam ... ex auctoritate ... Gulielmi Robertson ... Academiae Edinburgenae praefecti ... pro gradu doctoratus ... eruditorum examini subjicit, Arthur Lee, Virginiensis. Ad diem septembris [1764] ... – Edinburgi : in aedibus A. Donaldson et J. Reid, MDCCLXIV. – 2 p. l., 47 p. ; 20 cm.&lt;ref&gt;Kaiser, Leon M. Contributions to a census of American Latin Prose, 1634–1800 – In: Humanistica Lovaniesia : Journal of Neo-Latin Studies, Vol. 31, 1982, p. 178.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;National Union Catalogue: NL 0195158; DLC; NNNAM; DSI; MH-BA; ICN; NjP; NIC; DNLM.&lt;/ref&gt; In May, 13th 1765 he matriculated at the [[University of Leiden]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;Album Studiosorum Academiae Lugduno Batavae MDLXXV-MDCCCLXXV, kol. 1085.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Index to English speaking students who have graduated at Leyden university / by Edward Peacock, F.S.A. – London : For the Index society, by Longmans, Green &amp; co. 1883, p. 59, 1085.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;English-speaking students of medicine at the University of Leyden / R.W. Innes Smith. – Edinburgh/London : Oliver and Boyd, 1932, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the latter period, Lee wrote in 1764, "An Essay in Vindication of the Continental Colonies of America," one of his more noted works. He opposed the [[Townshend acts]] and became a major proponent of American resistance to the British.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

He studied law in London, passing the bar, and practising there from 1770 to 1776.&lt;ref name="bdusc"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://bioguide.congress.gov/scripts/biodisplay.pl?index=L000188 | title=LEE, Arthur, (1740–1792) | work=Biographical Dictionary of the U. S. Congress | accessdate=22 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this time in London, Lee wrote many influential pamphlets and essays opposing slavery&lt;ref&gt;Gary B. Nash,'' The Unknown American Revolution'' (New York: Viking Penguin, 2008) pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt; and British continental policies. 

In 1770, Lee in London was named as the Massachusetts correspondent to Britain and France. He began corresponding with [[Samuel Adams]], which began a long friendship. They probably did not meet personally until sometime after 1780. Lee met [[Benjamin Franklin]] while he was in London, where Franklin was negotiating on behalf of Pennsylvania interests. Lee criticized Franklin's extravagant lifestyle and told Sam Adams he would never be a good negotiator between a free people and a tyrant. 

In May 1776, he was a guest at the dinner organized by [[James Boswell]] that brought together [[Samuel Johnson]], an ardent opponent of the American colonists' cause, and [[John Wilkes]], one of its most prominent British supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~jlynch/Texts/BLJ/b764.html | title=Life of Johnson | first=James | last=Boswell | accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
During the [[American Revolution]], the [[Continental Congress]] appointed Lee as its envoy to Spain and [[Prussia]], but his success was at best mixed.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} Later, in Paris, after Lee helped negotiate the [[Treaty of Alliance (1778)]] with France, he fell out with [[Benjamin Franklin]] and [[Silas Deane]]. He persuaded Congress to recall Deane to America, but he was himself recalled soon afterward.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

In addition to his diplomatic duties, Lee was arguably one of America's first spies. He gathered information in France and Britain. He also successfully identified [[Edward Bancroft]], secretary to the American legation in Paris, as a British spy.&lt;ref name="bdusc"/&gt; 

After Lee returned to [[Virginia]], the state in 1782 sent him as a delegate to the [[Continental Congress]].&lt;ref name="bdusc"/&gt; The same year he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=28 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1790, Arthur Lee purchased [[Lansdowne (Urbanna, Virginia)|Lansdowne]] from Robert Wormeley III. This fine mansion still stands in [[Urbanna, Virginia|Urbanna]],{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}} a small waterfront town on Virginia's [[Middle Peninsula]].  It is presently a private residence. Lee died in 1792 and was buried in the rear garden with no stone. He never married and had no children. Plans to reinter him at Stratford Hall never came about. Lansdowne was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==

== Quotes ==

:A key factor in explaining the sad state of American education can be found in over-bureaucratization, which is seen in the compulsion to consolidate our public schools into massive factories and to increase to mammoth size our universities even in underpopulated states. The problem with bureaucracies is that they have to work hard and long to keep from substituting self-serving survival and growth for their original primary objective. Few succeed. Bureaucracies have no [[Soul (spirit)|soul]], no memory, and no [[conscience]]. If there is a single stumbling block on the road to the future, it is the bureaucracy as we know it. (p. 219)

'''Robert D. Haas''' (born 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.referenceforbusiness.com/biography/F-L/Haas-Robert-1942.html |title = Robert Haas |accessdate = August 21, 2011 |author = Kirk H. Beetz |date =  |work = Reference for Business }}&lt;/ref&gt;) is the Chairman Emeritus of [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]], son of [[Walter A. Haas Jr.]], and the great-great-grandnephew of the company's founder, [[Levi Strauss]].

== Biography ==
Born and raised in San Francisco, Robert (Bob) Haas received a Bachelor of Arts (BA) from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1964, where he was Phi Beta Kappa, and a Master of Business Administration (MBA) from [[Harvard Graduate School of Business]] in 1968, where he was named a Baker Scholar. Haas served in the [[Peace Corps]] in the Ivory Coast from 1964 to 1966. He was a [[White House Fellow]] from 1968 to 1969. After business school, Haas worked as an Associate at [[McKinsey &amp; Company]] from 1969 to 1972.

Haas joined [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.]] in 1973 and served in a variety of roles. He was elected to the Board of Directors in 1979 and as President and Chief Executive Officer in 1984. He served in that position until stepping down in 1999. He became Chairman of the Board in 1989 and retired from the Board in 2014.

Sales and profitability grew during the period of Haas’s leadership, thanks largely to the expansion of [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi's]] branded apparel internationally and the creation and rapid growth of the [[Dockers]] brand of casual apparel.

In 1985, Haas returned the company to private ownership. At the time it was announced, the Levi's [[Leveraged buyout|LBO]] was the largest in U.S. business history.

During his tenure, Haas built upon the ethical traditions of [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi Strauss &amp; Company]]. During the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]] of the 1930s, Robert's grandfather, [[Walter A. Haas Sr.]], and great uncle, [[Daniel E. Koshland Sr.]], refused to lay off idled employees, risking bankruptcy. Instead they created work projects such as laying wooden floors in the company's factory in San Francisco. [[Walter A. Haas Jr.|Walter Haas Jr.]] and his brother Peter insisted on running integrated factories in the American South, giving equal treatment to all races during the era of [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]]. During his tenure as leader at Levi Strauss,  Haas tried to create a corporate culture in which tens of thousands of employees around the world were treated fairly and well. In addition, the company led the way in addressing a range of social and business issues. In 1982, the company became the first prominent business to become involved in addressing the problems of HIV/AIDS, at the time a largely unknown disease. Under his leadership the company pioneered corporate standards for dealing with HIV-positive employees and created employee AIDS awareness programs. Since the early 1980s the Levi Strauss Foundation has donated over {{US$|60{{nbsp}}million|link=yes}} to AIDS-oriented non-profits. In 1992, Levi Strauss became the first [[Fortune 500]] company to extend health-care benefits to the unmarried partners of its employees, starting the acceptance of this practice by other leading companies. In that same year the company published the first ever corporate standards governing the treatment of employees in contractor factories around the world. Since then, these guidelines have been largely adopted by the apparel and footwear industries.

In 2009, Haas was selected as the ''Alumnus of the Year'' of the [[University of California, Berkeley]].

Active in support of his alma mater, he endowed the Haas Scholars Program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://hsp.berkeley.edu/about-robert-and-colleen-haas |title = Haas Scholars Program |accessdate = September 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; at UC Berkeley, which funds financial aid eligible, academically talented undergraduates to engage in a sustained research, field-study or creative project in the summer before and during their senior year at Berkeley. Each year, twenty Haas Scholars are selected from all disciplines and departments across the University on the basis of the merit and originality of their project proposals.

Haas is married to the former Colleen Gershon, and they have a daughter, Elise.

He is a member of the Board of Visitors of the University of California, Berkeley and serves as a Trustee of the [[Evelyn and Walter A. Haas Jr. Fund]]. He is a former member of the [[Trilateral Commission]], Trustee of the [[Ford Foundation]], member of the [[Council on Foreign Relations]], and Honorary Trustee of the [[Brookings Institution]]. In addition, Haas is the former Chairman of Stanford's Humanities and Sciences Council as well as the former president of the [[Levi Strauss Foundation]].

'''Rev. Bryan Fairfax, 8th Lord Fairfax of Cameron''' (1736{{mdash}}1802) was a Scottish clergyman and peer. He was a lifelong friend of [[George Washington]] and became the first{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} American-born holder of a [[British peerage]].

==Early life and family==
Bryan Fairfax was the son of Col. [[William Fairfax]] (1691–1757) of [[Belvoir (plantation)|Belvoir]] and Deborah Clarke (1708–1746).  As a young man, Fairfax lived at [[Belvoir (plantation)|Belvoir]] with his father who was the business agent for his cousin, [[Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]]. His brother, [[George William Fairfax|George William]] (1729–1787) and his wife, [[Sally Fairfax|Sally Cary Fairfax]] (1730–1811), also lived there and were close neighbors to [[George Washington]]'s [[Mount Vernon]]. As a young man, [[George Washington]] and his brother, [[Lawrence Washington (1718-1752)|Lawrence Washington]] (1718–1752), visited the Fairfax family at Belvoir often and Lord Fairfax employed Washington to join a surveying team of his western lands, in the valley of Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/secret/famous/washington.html|title=The Fairfaxes And George Washington|work=pbs.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peerage===
In 1793, when his cousin, [[Robert Fairfax, 7th Lord Fairfax of Cameron]], died in 1793, he initially ignored the title.  However, while in England in 1798 on other business, he presented the necessary proofs to the House of Lords to claim the title. In 1800, after he had returned to Virginia, the peerage was adjudged, and he became the Eighth Lord Fairfax.  After his death in 1802, his widow sued his executor, but the Supreme Court found for the executor in 1809.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://supreme.justia.com/us/9/19/case.html|title=Fairfax's Executor v. Fairfax (9 U.S. 19 (1809))|work=Justia Law}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His son [[Thomas Fairfax, 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Thomas Fairfax]] became the 9th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.

==Career and land holdings==
In 1740, he was deeded {{convert|3400|acre|km2}}, and 1741 was deeded {{convert|232|acre|km2}}, at Little Run or Hunger Run.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.directlinesoftware.com/Pool/nova.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1754, Bryan Fairfax clerked for his brother-in-law, [[John Carlyle (merchant)|John Carlyle]] (1720–1780), in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], and was appointed as a deputy clerk for [[Fairfax County]].&lt;ref name="Grizzard 460"&gt;{{cite journal

Fairfax was an avid foxhunter, and he and Washington often rode together.

In 1773, Fairfax deeded Towlston Grange to his daughter Elizabeth and her husband, David Griffith.&lt;ref name="FCDB"&gt;Fairfax County Deed Book-W, pp. 355–357&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary War==
When the [[Fairfax Resolves]] were debated in 1774, Fairfax corresponded with George Washington, the chairman of the committee considering the Resolves.

Fairfax was torn over the question of American independence during the [[American Revolutionary War]]. On his own in 1777, he tried to travel to England.  He was arrested in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]], for refusing to sign a loyalty oath.  However, he wrote to his good friend, George Washington, who sent him a pass to travel between the lines.   In New York, British officials also required a loyalty oath, to board ship, which he refused to take.  With his attempt thwarted, on his return trip home, he visited Washington, at [[Valley Forge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

===Correspondence with Washington===
When the [[Fairfax Resolves]] were debated in 1774, Fairfax sent letters to George Washington, the chairman of the committee considering the Resolves, giving reasons why they should not be adopted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For I think myself bound to oppose violent measures now.  The entering upon a Plan of having no Trade would be an arduous undertaking.  I mean if persisted in, and if once entered upon it ought to be strictly kept.  I therefore think it would be more proper to try first what Effect a petition might have toward obtaining a repeal of the Duty.&lt;ref&gt;p.129, Papers of George Washington, Colonial Series, Volume 10, University of Virginia Press, 1995, Charlottesville, Virginia {{ISBN|978-0-8139-1550-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, Washington responded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;As to your political sentiments, I would heartily join you in them, so far as relates to a humble and dutiful petition to the throne, provided there was the most distant hope of success. But have we not tried this already? Have we not addressed the Lords, and remonstrated to the Commons? And to what end? Did they deign to look at our petitions?  Does it not appear, as clear as the sun in its meridan brightness, that there is a regular, systematic plan formed to fix the right &amp; practise of taxation upon us?&lt;ref&gt;p.109, Papers of George Washington, Colonial Series, Volume 10, University of Virginia Press, 1995, Charlottesville, Virginia {{ISBN|978-0-8139-1550-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.familytales.org/dbDisplay.php?id=ltr_gwa1509&amp;person=gwa ''George Washington letter to Bryan Fairfax, 4 July 1774'', familytales]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

But he added:

{{quote|That I differ very widely from you, in respect to the mode of obtaining a repeal of the Acts so much, &amp; so justly complaind of, I shall not hesitate to acknowledge; &amp; that this difference in opinion may, probably, proceed from the different Construction's we put upon the Conduct, &amp; Intention of the Ministry, may also be true; But as I see nothing on the one hand, to induce a belief that the Parliament would embrace a favourable opportunity of Repealing Acts which they go on with great rapidity to pass, in order to enforce their Tyrannical System; and on the other, observe, or think I observe, that Government is pursuing a regular Plan at the expence of Law &amp; justice, to overthrow our Constitutional Rights &amp; liberties, how can I expect any redress from a Measure which hath been ineffectually tryd already—For Sir what is it we are contending against? Is it against paying the duty of 3d. pr lb. on Tea because burthensome? No, it is the Right only, we have all along disputed, &amp; to this end we have already Petitiond his Majesty in as humble, &amp; dutiful a manner as Subjects could do; ...

I cannot conclude without expressing some concern that I should differ so widely in Sentiments from you in a matter of such great Moment &amp; general Import; &amp; should much distrust my own judgement upon the occasion, if my Nature did not recoil at the thought of Submitting to Measures which I think Subversive of every thing that I ought to hold dear and valuable – and did I not find, at the same time, that the voice of Mankind is with me.&lt;ref&gt;p.131, Papers of George Washington, Colonial Series, Volume 10, University of Virginia Press, 1995, Charlottesville, Virginia {{ISBN|978-0-8139-1550-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/revolution/letters/bfairfax2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-09-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081020043311/http://gwpapers.virginia.edu/documents/revolution/letters/bfairfax2.html |archivedate=2008-10-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Bryan Fairfax respectfully disagreed:

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is a new opinion now lately advanced in Virginia that the Parliament have no right to make any or scarce any Laws binding on the Colonies. It has given me much Uneasiness. For altho' I wish as much as any one that we were legally exempted from it, yet I hold it clearly that we ought to abide by our Constitution. The common Consent and Acquiescence in the Colonies for such a Length of time is to me a clear Proof of their having a Right.

Later during September, 1777, Fairfax was detained in [[Lancaster, Pennsylvania]].  However, he wrote to his Washington, who sent him a pass to travel between the lines:

{{quote|For the  past two years I have had a strong Desire to enter into Holy Orders than ever I had before tho' frequently in my Life have had the same, yet generally suffered worldly considerations to interfere.  This Desire and the not finding myself at Liberty to concur in the Public measures make me very anxious to get to England, and I have been in Hopes of obtaining a Pass from the Congress to go to N: York for that Purpose.  There has appeared to me but one Objection, and that is, the giving of Intelligence, but I would not only enter into Engagements in that respect if required but it may [be] considered that what I might say would be of little Consequence, but if of any would raher{{Clarify|date=April 2016}} be in Favour of America because I really think that it would be the Interest of Great Britain to let her enjoy her Independence, for if successful in this Struggle which is very doubtful it might all be to do over again at another Time.

Washington wrote him back: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;The difference in our political Sentiments never made any change in my friendship for you, and the favorable Sentiments I ever entertained of your hon'r, leaves me without a doubt that you would say any thing, or do any thing injurious to the cause we are engaged in after having pledged your word to the contrary.  I therefore give my consent readily ...&lt;ref&gt;p.310, Papers of George Washington, Revolutionary War Series, Volume 11, University of Virginia Press, 2001 Charlottesville, Virginia {{ISBN|0-8139-2026-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">[[Image:Charlecote Morris edited.jpg|thumb|Charlecote Park circa 1880, the former seat of the Cameron-Ramsay-Fairfax-Lucy family]]
The '''Fairfax''', later '''Ramsay-Fairfax''', later '''Cameron-Ramsay-Fairfax-Lucy Baronetcy''', of The Holmes in the County of Roxburgh, is a title in the [[Baronetage of the United Kingdom]]. It was created on 14 March 1836 for Henry Fairfax, in honour of his father, [[Vice-Admiral]] [[William George Fairfax|Sir William George Fairfax]]. The second Baronet [[Name_change#Historical_usage|assumed the additional surname]] of Ramsay in 1876, which was the [[maiden name]] of his maternal grandmother. The third Baronet assumed by [[College_of_Arms#Change_of_name_and_arms|Royal Licence]] the additional surname of Lucy in 1892 after his marriage to Ada Christina Lucy, daughter and heiress of Henry Spencer Lucy. In 1921 he added by Royal licence the additional surname of Cameron, making this quadruple-barrelled name a notable example of [[Double-barrelled_name#British_tradition|the British tradition of concatenated surnames]].

The sixth Baronet was the husband of [[Lucinda Lambton]], architectural writer, between 1986 and 1989.

[[Charlecote Park]] in the village of [[Charlecote]] in [[Warwickshire]] came into the Fairfax family through the marriage of the third Baronet to Ada Christina Lucy. The previous owners of Charlecote Park, the [[De Lucy|Lucy family]], had become extinct in the male line. In the 20th century the family fell on harder times and they gave Charlecote Park to the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]].

The [[Lord Fairfax of Cameron|Lords Fairfax of Cameron]] are members of another branch of the Fairfax family.

'''Carlos Heller''' (born October 17, 1940) is an Argentine executive, [[cooperative banking]] leader, and politician.

==Life and times==

===The cooperative movement===
Carlos Heller was born in rural Villa Dominguez (near [[Villaguay]], [[Entre Ríos Province]]), in 1940, to a [[Argentine Jew|Jewish]] family. The Hellers relocated to [[Buenos Aires]] in 1950, and Carlos completed his secondary schooling in a [[vocational]] school. He married Ether Sosa in 1962, and the couple had two children. Losing his post in an auto parts manufacturer due to layoffs, Heller was hired as an administrative assistant in one of Buenos Aires' then-numerous [[credit union]]s, in 1963; in 1974, he was named to the board of directors of the ''Instituto Movilizador de Fondos Cooperativos'' (Argentine credit unions' coordinating body).&lt;ref name=vida&gt;[http://www.carlosheller.com.ar/temas/mi-vida/ Carlos Heller: mi vida {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Reorganization Process|military dictatorship]] installed in 1976 brought with it an ultra-conservative Economy Minister, [[José Alfredo Martínez de Hoz]]. Following a round of [[wage freeze]]s (amid 400% inflation), Martínez de Hoz further threatened community banks in February 1977 with his Financial Entities Law. The measure prohibited [[non-profit]] banking and raised minimum capital requirements to US$10 million, both of which precluded most smaller [[credit union]]s in the country at the time. This and further measures enacted by the Economy Minister in 1977 encouraged the dramatic growth of [[investment banking]] in Argentina - particularly the financing of [[speculation]]. This adversely affected credit unions further by allowing larger, commercial banks to offer depositors exotic investment vehicles with high yields.&lt;ref name=archive&gt;[http://www.archicoop.com.ar/documentos/banco_credicoop.pdf Banco Credicoop: 25 años de trayectoria {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lewis&gt;Lewis, Paul. ''The Crisis of Argentine Capitalism''. University of North Carolina Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; As credit unions closed, Heller and other leaders in the sector met in a [[Villa Ortúzar]] co-op in 1978 to discuss the creation of a unified credit union; in November, they petitioned the [[Central Bank of Argentina]] to charter ''[[Credico-op Bank|Banco Credicoop]]''. Receiving the Central Bank's charter in February 1979, the new institution named Carlos Heller its first General Manager.&lt;ref name=vida/&gt; 

Even as community banks closed, unregulated investment banks proliferated in Argentina during the late 1970s; the practice collapsed between 1980 and 1982, however, and hundreds of these unregulated financial houses, as well as numerous banks, closed.&lt;ref name=lewis/&gt;

===Tenure at Boca Juniors football club===
[[Antonio Alegre]] invited Heller to run with him for the vice-presidency of the [[Boca Juniors]] football team, one of Argentina's (and the world's) most prominent. Elected in 1985, Alegre and Heller inherited a financially insolvent football club and a stadium unable to meet municipal safety requirements. Selling land near Buenos Aires' waterfront for US$21 million, they were able to recover the club's finances and refurbish the iconic [[Estadio Alberto J. Armando|Bombonera]] stadium. The duo was narrowly defeated for re-election by [[Mauricio Macri]], in December 1995.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ole.clarin.com/notas/2008/01/03/01576706.html Olé: Antonio Alegre {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt; Heller has been nominated numerous times for the presidency of the [[Argentine Football Association]] (AFA), though his prospective candidacy has been reportedly opposed by the AFA's longtime head, [[Julio Grondona]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gacemail.com.ar/Detalle.asp?NotaID=5843 Gacemail: Entrevista a Carlos Heller {{es icon}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105020422/http://www.gacemail.com.ar/Detalle.asp?NotaID=5843 |date=November 5, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Politics===
Long a [[socialist]], Heller publicly entered the fractious realm of [[Politics of Argentina|Argentine politics]] in 2004, when he joined the [[Rosario]] Group, a left-leaning [[advocacy group]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artemisanoticias.com.ar/site/notas.asp?id=1&amp;idnota=4311 Artemisa Noticias: Carlos Heller {{es icon}}] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928115457/http://www.artemisanoticias.com.ar/site/notas.asp?id=1&amp;idnota=4311 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heller formed the Solidary Party ahead of the [[Argentine general election, 2007|2007 elections]], obtaining the support of Congressman [[Miguel Bonasso]] and former Buenos Aires Mayor [[Aníbal Ibarra]], who had been impeached a year earlier over accusations of negligence in a tragic New Year's Eve 2004 [[República Cromañón nightclub fire|nightclub fire]]. Heller was [[Daniel Filmus]]' running mate for the post of Mayor of Buenos Aires. A close ally of President [[Néstor Kirchner]], Filmus proceeded to a [[runoff election]]; but he and Heller were amply defeated by the center-right [[Republican Proposal]] candidate, [[Mauricio Macri]]. 

For the [[Argentine legislative election, 2009|Argentine legislative elections of 2009]] Heller became a candidate for a seat at the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|lower chamber]] for the City of Buenos Aires. His candidacy was on top of the joint ticket of his own [[Solidarity Party (Argentina)|Solidarity Party]] ('''''PSOL''''') and the [[Kirchnerism|Kirchnerist]] [[Front for Victory]]. In one of the most important and competitive electoral districts of Argentina, Heller secured a seat in Congress obtaining 12% of the vote, its ticket placed fourth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/2009/06/28/um/m-01948181.htm ''Clarín'': Primeros datos de capital {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The building is also notable for its former proposed architectural height of {{convert|1775|ft|m}}, one foot shorter than the symbolic {{convert|1776|ft|m|adj=on}} height of [[One World Trade Center]].

==Design==
The building is designed by [[Adrian Smith + Gordon Gill Architecture]].

==Construction issues &amp; incidents==
A lawsuit was filed by the [[Art Students League]], against their board for selling the rights to build the tower.  However, the State Supreme Court judge dismissed the case stating that there was not enough evidence to support the claims of the 200 league members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/life-style/real-estate/art-students-league-loses-battle-skyscraper-article-1.1891321|title=Judge tosses lawsuit brought by Art Students League against giant 57th St. skyscraper  |date=4 August 2014|access-date=16 November 2018|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 3,000 pound glass panel standing at the ground floor tipped over on top of a security guard at the building's construction site on May 26, 2018.  The security guard was declared dead at the hospital.  A construction worker at the scene had tried to rescue the security guard, and ended up fracturing his right foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/security-guard-struck-killed-skyscraper-falling-glass-article-1.4011406|title=Security guard dies after falling glass from Central Park Tower skyscraper strikes him |date=26 May 2018|access-date=16 November 2018|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the incident, the [[New York City Department of Buildings]] ordered a halt on all construction work at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/guard-died-nyc-tower-construction-accident-history-article-1.4012961|title=City suspends construction on Midtown skyscraper after falling glass killed security guard |date=27 May 2018|access-date=16 November 2018|work=New York Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Infobox cobalt}}
'''Cobalt''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Co''' and atomic number 27. Like nickel, cobalt is found in the Earth's crust only in chemically combined form, save for small deposits found in alloys of natural [[meteoric iron]]. The free element, produced by reductive [[smelting]], is a hard, lustrous, silver-gray [[metal]].

Cobalt-based blue pigments ([[cobalt blue]]) have been used since ancient times for jewelry and paints, and to impart a distinctive blue tint to glass, but the color was later thought by alchemists to be due to the known metal [[bismuth]]. Miners had long used the name ''[[kobold]] ore'' (German for ''goblin ore'') for some of the blue-pigment producing [[minerals]]; they were so named because they were poor in known metals, and gave poisonous [[arsenic]]-containing fumes when smelted. In 1735, such ores were found to be reducible to a new metal (the first discovered since ancient times), and this was ultimately named for the ''kobold''.

Today, some cobalt is produced specifically from one of a number of metallic-lustered ores, such as for example [[cobaltite]] (Co[[Arsenic|As]][[Sulfur|S]]). The element is however more usually produced as a by-product of [[copper]] and [[nickel]] mining. [[Copperbelt|The copper belt]] in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) and [[Zambia]] yields most of the global cobalt production. The DRC alone accounted for more than 50% of world production in 2016 (123,000 tonnes), according to [[Natural Resources Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Electric car future spurs Cobalt rush: Swelling demand for product breathes new life into small Ontario town|author=Danielle Bochove |work=Vancouver Sun|date=November 1, 2017|agency=Bloomberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobalt is primarily used in the manufacture of [[magnetism|magnetic]], wear-resistant and high-strength [[alloy]]s. The compounds cobalt silicate and [[Cobalt blue|cobalt(II) aluminate]] (CoAl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, cobalt blue) give a distinctive deep blue color to [[glass]], [[ceramic]]s, [[ink]]s, [[paint]]s and [[varnish]]es. Cobalt occurs naturally as only one stable [[isotope]], cobalt-59. [[Cobalt-60]] is a commercially important radioisotope, used as a [[radioactive tracer]] and for the production of high energy [[gamma ray]]s.

Cobalt is the active center of a group of [[coenzymes]] called [[cobalamin]]s. [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B{{ssub|12}}]], the best-known example of the type, is an essential [[vitamin]] for all animals. Cobalt in inorganic form is also a [[micronutrient]] for [[bacteria]], [[algae]], and [[fungi]].

==Characteristics==

Cobalt is a weakly reducing metal that is protected from oxidation by a [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivating]] [[oxide]] film. It is attacked by [[halogens]] and [[sulfur]]. Heating in [[oxygen]] produces [[Cobalt(II,III) oxide|Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]] which loses oxygen at {{convert|900|C}} to give the [[Cobalt(II) oxide|monoxide]] CoO.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; The metal reacts with [[fluorine]] ([[Fluorine|F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) at 520&amp;nbsp;K to give [[Cobalt(III) fluoride|CoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]; with [[chlorine]] ([[Chlorine|Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[bromine]] ([[Bromine|Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) and [[iodine]] ([[Iodine|I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]), producing equivalent binary [[halides]]. It does not react with [[hydrogen gas]] ([[hydrogen|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) or [[nitrogen gas]] ([[nitrogen|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]]) even when heated, but it does react with [[boron]], [[carbon]], [[phosphorus]], [[arsenic]] and sulfur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Housecroft3rd|page=722}}&lt;/ref&gt; At ordinary temperatures, it reacts slowly with [[mineral acids]], and very slowly with moist, but not with dry, air.

==Compounds==
{{Category see also|Cobalt compounds}}
Common [[oxidation states]] of cobalt include +2 and +3, although compounds with oxidation states ranging from −3 to [[percobaltate|+5]] are also known. A common oxidation state for simple compounds is +2 (cobalt(II)).  These salts form the pink-colored [[metal aquo complex]] [Co(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; in water. Addition of chloride gives the intensely blue {{chem|[CoCl|4|]|2-}}.&lt;ref name=greenwood/&gt; In a borax bead [[flame test]], cobalt shows deep blue in both oxidizing and reducing flames.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7tfyCAAAQBAJ|title=Rutley’s Elements of Mineralogy|last=Rutley|first=Frank|date=2012-12-06|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media|isbn=9789401197694|page=40|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oxygen and chalcogen compounds===
Several [[oxide]]s of cobalt are known. Green [[cobalt(II) oxide]] (CoO) has [[Cubic crystal system|rocksalt]] structure. It is readily oxidized with water and oxygen to brown cobalt(III) hydroxide (Co(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). At temperatures of 600–700&amp;nbsp;°C, CoO oxidizes to the blue [[cobalt(II,III) oxide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), which has a [[spinel]] structure.&lt;ref name=greenwood&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|pages=1117–1119}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black [[cobalt(III) oxide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) is also known.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=107|title=The history and use of our earth's chemical elements: a reference guide|author=Krebs, Robert E.|edition=2nd|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|date=2006|isbn=0-313-33438-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cobalt oxides are [[antiferromagnetic]] at low [[temperature]]: CoO ([[Néel temperature]] 291&amp;nbsp;K) and Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (Néel temperature: 40&amp;nbsp;K), which is analogous to [[magnetite]] (Fe&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;), with a mixture of +2 and +3 oxidation states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Petitto|first1=Sarah C.|last2=Marsh|first2=Erin M.|last3=Carson|first3=Gregory A.|last4=Langell|first4=Marjorie A.|title=Cobalt oxide surface chemistry: The interaction of CoO(100), Co3O4(110) and Co3O4(111) with oxygen and water|url=http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1021&amp;context=chemistrylangell|journal=Journal of Molecular Catalysis A: Chemical|volume=281|pages=49–58|date=2008|doi=10.1016/j.molcata.2007.08.023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal [[chalcogen]]ides of cobalt include the black [[cobalt(II) sulfide]]s, CoS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, which adopts a [[pyrite]]-like structure, and [[cobalt sulfide|cobalt(III) sulfide]] (Co&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).

===Halides===

Four [[:wikt:dihalide|dihalide]]s of cobalt(II) are known: [[cobalt(II) fluoride]] (CoF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, pink), [[cobalt(II) chloride]] (CoCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, blue), [[cobalt(II) bromide]] (CoBr&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, green), [[cobalt(II) iodide]] (CoI&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, blue-black). These halides exist in anhydrous and hydrated forms. Whereas the anhydrous dichloride is blue, the hydrate is red.&lt;ref name=greenwood2&gt;{{Greenwood&amp;Earnshaw2nd|pages=1119–1120}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reduction potential for the reaction {{chem|Co|3+}} + e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → {{chem|Co|2+}} is +1.92&amp;nbsp;V, beyond that for [[chlorine]] to chloride, +1.36&amp;nbsp;V. Consequently, cobalt(III) and chloride would result in the cobalt(III) being reduced to cobalt(II). Because the reduction potential for fluorine to fluoride is so high, +2.87&amp;nbsp;V, [[cobalt(III) fluoride]] is one of the few simple stable cobalt(III) compounds. Cobalt(III) fluoride, which is used in some fluorination reactions, reacts vigorously with water.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

===Coordination compounds===
As for all metals, molecular compounds and polyatomic ions of cobalt are classified as [[coordination complex]]es, that is, molecules or ions that contain cobalt linked to several [[ligand]]s. The principles of [[electronegativity]] and [[HSAB theory|hardness–softness]] of a series of ligands can be used to explain the usual oxidation state of cobalt. For example, Co&lt;sup&gt;+3&lt;/sup&gt; complexes tend to have [[ammine]] ligands. Because phosphorus is softer than nitrogen, phosphine ligands tend to feature the [[HSAB theory|softer]] Co&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, an example being tris(triphenylphosphine)cobalt(I) chloride ((P(C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CoCl). The more electronegative (and harder) oxide and fluoride can stabilize Co&lt;sup&gt;4+&lt;/sup&gt; and Co&lt;sup&gt;5+&lt;/sup&gt; derivatives, e.g. caesium hexafluorocobaltate (Cs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CoF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;) and potassium [[percobaltate]] (K&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CoO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"&gt;{{cite book|author=Holleman, A.

[[Alfred Werner]], a Nobel-prize winning pioneer in [[coordination chemistry]], worked with compounds of [[empirical formula]] [Co(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. One of the isomers determined was [[cobalt(III) hexammine chloride]]. This coordination complex, a typical Werner-type complex, consists of a central cobalt atom coordinated by six [[ammine]] orthogonal ligands and three [[chloride]] counteranions. Using [[chelation|chelating]] [[ethylenediamine]] ligands in place of ammonia gives [[tris(ethylenediamine)cobalt(III) chloride]] ([Co(en)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]Cl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), which was one of the first [[coordination complex]]es to be resolved into [[Chirality (chemistry)|optical isomers]]. The complex exists in the right- and left-handed forms of a "three-bladed propeller". This complex was first isolated by Werner as yellow-gold needle-like crystals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author = Werner, A. |title = Zur Kenntnis des asymmetrischen Kobaltatoms.

Twenty-two [[radioisotope]]s have been characterized; the most stable, [[Cobalt-60|&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co]] has a [[half-life]] of 5.2714&amp;nbsp;years, and &lt;sup&gt;57&lt;/sup&gt;Co has a half-life of 271.8&amp;nbsp;days, &lt;sup&gt;56&lt;/sup&gt;Co a half-life of 77.27&amp;nbsp;days, and &lt;sup&gt;58&lt;/sup&gt;Co a half-life of 70.86&amp;nbsp;days. All the other [[radioactive]] isotopes of cobalt have half-lives shorter than 18&amp;nbsp;hours, and in most cases shorter than 1&amp;nbsp;second. This element also has 4 [[meta state]]s, all of which have half-lives shorter than 15 minutes.&lt;ref name="nubase"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Audi| first = G.|title = The NUBASE Evaluation of Nuclear and Decay Properties| journal = Nuclear Physics A| volume = 729| pages = 3–128| publisher = Atomic Mass Data Center| date = 2003| doi=10.1016/j.nuclphysa.2003.11.001| bibcode=2003NuPhA.729....3A| last2 = Bersillon| first2 = O.| last3 = Blachot| first3 = J.| last4 = Wapstra| first4 = A.

The isotopes of cobalt range in [[atomic weight]] from 50 [[atomic mass unit|u]] (&lt;sup&gt;50&lt;/sup&gt;Co) to 73 u (&lt;sup&gt;73&lt;/sup&gt;Co). The primary [[decay mode]] for isotopes with atomic mass unit values less than that of the most abundant stable isotope, &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co, is [[electron capture]] and the primary mode of decay in isotopes with atomic mass greater than 59 atomic mass units is [[beta decay]]. The primary [[decay product]]s below &lt;sup&gt;59&lt;/sup&gt;Co are element 26 ([[iron]]) isotopes; above that the decay products are element 28 (nickel) isotopes.&lt;ref name="nubase"/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Early blue and white ware circa 1335 Jingdezhen.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=cobalt blue Chinese porcelain |Early Chinese blue and white porcelain, manufactured c. 1335]]
Cobalt compounds have been used for centuries to impart a rich blue color to [[glass]], [[ceramic glaze|glazes]], and [[Ceramics (art)|ceramics]]. Cobalt has been detected in Egyptian sculpture, Persian jewelry from the third millennium BC, in the ruins of [[Pompeii]], destroyed in 79 AD, and in China, dating from the [[Tang dynasty]] (618–907 AD) and the [[Ming dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/123235/cobalt-Co Cobalt], Encyclopædia Britannica Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cobalt has been used to color glass since the [[Bronze Age]]. The excavation of the [[Uluburun shipwreck]] yielded an ingot of blue glass, cast during the 14th century BC.&lt;ref name="Pulak"&gt;

The word ''cobalt'' is derived from the German ''{{lang|mhd|kobalt}}'', from ''[[kobold]]'' meaning "goblin", a superstitious term used for the [[ore]] of cobalt by miners. The first attempts to smelt those ores for copper or nickel failed, yielding simply powder (cobalt(II) oxide) instead. Because the primary ores of cobalt always contain arsenic, smelting the ore oxidized the arsenic into the highly toxic and volatile [[arsenic(III) oxide|arsenic oxide]], adding to the notoriety of the ore.&lt;ref name="met1863" &gt;{{cite book|isbn = 978-0-202-36361-5|pages =254–256|chapter = Cobalt|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=UyE49SzKWHIC&amp;pg=PA254|title = Metallurgy: 1863–1963|author1 = Dennis, W.

Swedish chemist [[Georg Brandt]] (1694–1768) is credited with discovering cobalt circa 1735, showing it to be a previously unknown element, different from bismuth and other traditional metals.

&lt;/ref&gt; He showed that compounds of cobalt metal were the source of the blue color in glass, which previously had been attributed to the [[bismuth]] found with cobalt.

During the 19th century, a significant part of the world's production of [[cobalt blue]] (a dye made with cobalt compounds and alumina) and [[smalt]] ([[cobalt glass]] powdered for use for pigment purposes in ceramics and painting) was carried out at the Norwegian [[Blaafarveværket]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ramberg, Ivar B. |title=The making of a land: geology of Norway|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rMVNE0F2SckC&amp;pg=PA98|accessdate= 2011-04-30 |date=2008 |publisher=Geological Society |isbn=978-82-92394-42-7|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cyclopaedia|title=Cyclopædia of useful arts &amp; manufactures|editor=C.

After World War II, the US wanted to guarantee the supply of cobalt ore for military uses (as the Germans had been doing) and prospected for cobalt within the U.S. border. An adequate supply of the ore was found in Idaho near [[Blackbird Mine|Blackbird canyon]] in the side of a mountain. The firm Calera Mining Company started production at the site.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=kNwDAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA65&amp;dq=true#v=onepage&amp;q=true&amp;f=true "Richest Hole In The Mountain"] ''Popular Mechanics'', May 1952, pp. 65–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Occurrence==
The stable form of cobalt is produced in [[supernova]]s through the [[r-process]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode = 1980SvAL....6...61P|title=Creation of the Iron-Group Elements in a Supernova Explosion|author=Ptitsyn, D.

Free cobalt (the [[native metal]]) is not found on Earth because of the oxygen in the atmosphere and the chlorine in the ocean. Both are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent native metal cobalt from forming. Except as recently delivered in meteoric iron, pure cobalt in native metal form is unknown on Earth. The element has a medium abundance but natural compounds of cobalt are numerous and all amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.

In nature, cobalt is frequently associated with [[nickel]]. Both are characteristic components of [[meteoric iron]], though cobalt is much less abundant in iron meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron [[alloy]]s may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://rruff.info/rdsmi/V35/RDSMI35_355.pdf |title=Determination of metallic iron, nickel and cobalt in meteorites |author=Nuccio, Pasquale Mario and Valenza, Mariano |year=1979 |journal=Rendiconti Societa Italiana di Mineralogia e Petrografia |volume=35 |issue=1 |pages=355–360}}&lt;/ref&gt; though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.

Cobalt in compound form occurs in copper and nickel minerals. It is the major metallic component that combines with [[sulfur]] and arsenic in the sulfidic [[cobaltite]] (CoAsS), [[safflorite]] (CoAs&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), [[glaucodot]] ((Co,Fe)AsS), and [[skutterudite]] (CoAs&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) minerals.&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt; The mineral [[cattierite]] is similar to [[pyrite]] and occurs together with [[vaesite]] in the copper deposits of [[Katanga Province]].&lt;ref&gt;

The main ores of cobalt are [[cobaltite]], erythrite, [[glaucodot]] and [[skutterudite]] (see above), but most cobalt is obtained by reducing the cobalt [[by-product]]s of nickel and [[copper]] mining and [[smelting]].&lt;ref name="YB2006"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/myb1-2006-cobal.pdf|first = Kim B.|last = Shedd|accessdate = 2008-10-26|title = Mineral Yearbook 2006: Cobalt|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://minerals.usgs.gov/minerals/pubs/commodity/cobalt/mcs-2008-cobal.pdf|first = Kim B.|last = Shedd|accessdate = 2008-10-26|title = Commodity Report 2008: Cobalt|publisher = United States Geological Survey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since cobalt is generally produced as a by-product, the supply of cobalt depends to a great extent on the economic feasibility of copper and  nickel mining in a given market. Demand for cobalt was projected to grow 6% in 2017.&lt;ref name=ft&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ft.com/content/bc8dc13c-07db-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b|title=Cobalt’s meteoric rise at risk from Congo’s Katanga|author=Henry Sanderson |date=March 14, 2017|publisher=Financial Times | url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several methods exist to separate cobalt from copper and nickel, depending on the concentration of cobalt and the exact composition of the used [[ore]]. One method is [[froth flotation]], in which [[surfactant]]s bind to different ore components, leading to an enrichment of cobalt ores. Subsequent [[roasting (metallurgy)|roasting]] converts the ores to [[cobalt sulfate]], and the copper and the iron are oxidized to the oxide. [[Leaching (metallurgy)|Leaching]] with water extracts the sulfate together with the [[arsenate]]s. The residues are further leached with [[sulfuric acid]], yielding a solution of copper sulfate. Cobalt can also be leached from the [[slag]] of copper smelting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page = 347| title = ASM specialty handbook: nickel, cobalt, and their alloys| author =Davis, Joseph R.|publisher = ASM International| date = 2000| isbn = 0-87170-685-7| url = https://books.google.com/?id=IePhmnbmRWkC&amp;dq=cobalt+copper+nickel+ore+separate}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The products of the above-mentioned processes are transformed into the cobalt oxide (Co&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). This oxide is reduced to metal by the [[aluminothermic reaction]] or reduction with carbon in a [[blast furnace]].&lt;ref name="HollemanAF"/&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) currently produces 63% of the world’s cobalt. This market share may reach 73% by 2025 if planned expansions by mining producers like [[Glencore]] Plc take place as expected. But by 2030, global demand could be 47 times more than it was in 2017, Bloomberg New Energy Finance has estimated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=We’ll All Be Relying on Congo to Power Our Electric Cars |author=Thomas Wilson |date=October 26, 2017|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/battery-boom-relies-on-one-african-nation-avoiding-chaos-of-past |archive-url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-10-26/battery-boom-relies-on-one-african-nation-avoiding-chaos-of-past |archive-date=March 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes that Congo made to mining laws in 2002 led did attract investment in Congolese copper and cobalt projects. However Glencore dominates the coltan market in DRC. Its Mutanda mine shipped 24,500 tons of cobalt from its Mutanda mine last year, 40% of Congo DRC’s output and nearly a quarter of global production. T Glencore’s Katanga Mining project is resuming as well and should produce 300,000 tons of copper and 20,000 tons of cobalt by 2019, according to Glencore.&lt;ref name=ft/&gt;

In 2005, the top producer of cobalt was the copper deposits in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]'s [[Katanga Province]]. Formerly Shaba province, the area had almost 40% of global reserves, reported the [[British Geological Survey]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; By 2015, Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) supplied 60% of world cobalt production, 32,000 tons at $20,000 to $26,000 per ton. Recent growth in production could at least partly be due to how low mining production fell during DRC Congo's very violent civil wars in the early 2000s, or to the changes the country made to its Mining Code in 2002 to encourage foreign and multinational investment and which did bring in a number of investors, including [[Glencore]]. Three of its current Congo projects 
[[Artisanal mining]] supplied 10% to 25% of the DRC production.&lt;ref name=wpDRC1/&gt; Some 100,000 cobalt miners in Congo DRC use hand tools to dig hundreds of feet, with little planning and fewer safety measures, say workers and government and NGO officials, as well as [[Washington Post]] reporters' observations on visits to isolated mines.

The political and ethnic dynamics of the region have in the past caused horrific outbreaks of violence and years of armed conflict and displaced populations. This instability affected the price of cobalt and also created perverse incentives for the combattants in the First and Second Congo Wars to prolong the fighting, since access to diamond mines and other valuable resources helped to finance their military goals—which frequently amounteed to genocide—and also enriched the fighters themselves. While DR Congo has in the 2010s not recently been invaded by neighboring military forces, some of the richest mineral deposits adjoin areas where Tutsis and Hutus still frequently clash, unrest continues although on a smaller scale and refugees still flee outbreaks of violence.&lt;ref&gt;

Cobalt extracted from small Congolese [[artisanal mining]] endeavors in 2007 supplied a single Chinese company, Congo DongFang International Mining. A subsidiary of [[Zhejiang Huayou Cobalt]], one of the world’s largest cobalt producers, Congo DongFang supplied cobalt to some of the world’s largest battery manufacturers, who produced batteries for ubiquitous products like the Apple [[iPhone]]s. Corporate pieties about an ethical [[supply chain]] were thus met with some incredulity. A number of observers have called for tech corporations and other manufacturers to avoid sourcing conflict metals in Central Africa at all rather than risk enabling the financial exploitation, [[human rights]] abuses like kidnappings for [[unfree labor]], environmental devastation and the human toll of violence, poverty and toxic conditions.

The [[Mukondo Mountain]] project, operated by the [[Central African Mining and Exploration Company]] (CAMEC) in [[Katanga Province]], may be the richest cobalt reserve in the world. It produced an estimated one third of the total global coval production in 2008.&lt;ref name=IntMining200807&gt;

==Applications==
Cobalt has been used in production of high-performance alloys.&lt;ref name="YB2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"/&gt; It can also be used to make rechargeable batteries, and the advent of electric vehicles and their success with consumers probably has a great deal to do with the DRC's soaring production. Other important factors were the 2002 Mining Code, which encouraged investment by foreign and transnational corporations such as Glencore, and the end of the First and Second Congo Wars.

===Alloys===
Cobalt-based [[superalloy]]s have historically consumed most of the cobalt produced.&lt;ref name="YB2006"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CR2008"/&gt; The temperature stability of these alloys makes them suitable for turbine blades for [[gas turbine]]s and aircraft [[jet engine]]s, although nickel-based [[single-crystal]] alloys surpass them in performance.&lt;ref name="super"&gt;

===Catalysts===
Several cobalt compounds are oxidation catalysts. Cobalt acetate is used to convert [[xylene]] to [[terephthalic acid]], the precursor of the bulk polymer [[polyethylene terephthalate]]. Typical catalysts are the cobalt [[carboxylate]]s (known as cobalt soaps). They are also used in paints, varnishes, and inks as "drying agents" through the oxidation of [[drying oils]].&lt;ref name="WhyCo"/&gt; The same carboxylates are used to improve the adhesion between steel and rubber in steel-belted radial tires. In addition they are used as accelerators in [[polyester resin]] systems.

Cobalt-based catalysts are used in reactions involving [[carbon monoxide]]. Cobalt is also a catalyst in the [[Fischer–Tropsch process]] for the [[hydrogenation]] of carbon monoxide into liquid fuels.&lt;ref&gt;

Before the 19th century, cobalt was predominantly used as a pigment. It has been used since the Middle Ages to make [[smalt]], a blue-colored glass. Smalt is produced by melting a mixture of roasted mineral [[smaltite]], [[quartz]] and [[potassium carbonate]], which yields a dark blue silicate glass, which is finely ground after the production.&lt;ref&gt;

'''David John Gunn''', generally known as '''Davey''' or '''Davy''', (18 September 1887 – 25 December 1955) was a keen promoter of the attractions of the [[Hollyford Track]] and from 1936 guided parties to them.  A farmer and [[the bush#New Zealand|bushman]] he ran his almost wild cattle in the glacier-cut [[Hollyford River|Hollyford Valley]] in [[Fiordland]], [[Westland District|South Westland]], New Zealand. 

Gunn was the fourth of five children of Scottish parents, Isabella Grierson Robertson and her husband, Alexander Gunn. A one-time shepherd,&lt;ref name="DNZB Gunn"&gt;{{DNZB|Owen|Alwyn|4g25|Gunn, David John|24 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander Gunn ran a sheep farm of 27,000 acres in Central Otago.&lt;ref name=WDA&gt;[https://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/newspapers/WDA19170517.2.21?query=gunn%20waimate Waimate Daily Advertiser, page 3, 17 May 1917]&lt;/ref&gt; For secondary schooling David lived at Hook near [[Waimate]] with his maiden aunts on their 500 acre farm.&lt;ref name=WDA/&gt; Matriculating and leaving school he briefly followed other family members into [[Dalgety and Company|Dalgety's]] working in one of their many branch offices as a clerk before deciding a desk job did not suit him.&lt;ref name=JB&gt;Julia Bradshaw (with Murray Gunn), ''The Land of Doing without, Davey Gunn of the Hollyford'', 2007, Canterbury University Press. {{ISBN|9781877257537}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went back to work on and later manage the farm at Hook.&lt;ref name=WDA/&gt;  He underwent military training at Trentham in 1918 but was too late to be sent overseas.&lt;ref name=JB/&gt;
[[File:Hollyford2036.jpg|thumb|A bridge on Gunn's Hollyford Track]]
He went farming on his own account 100 miles south of Waimate at [[Sutton, New Zealand|Sutton]]. On 10 July 1919 at [[Morven, New Zealand|Morven]] near Waimate he married Ethel May Willetts, a confectioner. They were to have two daughters, Isabel and Dorothy, and a son, Murray. 

George Gunn, an early runholder, mapped some of the [[Hollyford Valley]] in 1861. In 1926 David Gunn bought freehold land there from remaining original settlers, the McKenzie family. He increased his Hollyford landholding in 1929, just before the onset of the [[Great Depression]], by acquiring four leases totalling more than 25,000 acres. He then moved to the valley, establishing his solitary base at Deadman's Hut on the banks of the [[Hollyford River]]. Gunn cut a number of well used tracks and erected huts in the more remote parts of his run. 

His wife took their children to Oamaru to be educated and Gunn returned to his family for brief visits only twice a year.

==Fox Moth crash==
Gunn came to public attention on 30 December 1936 with a speedy journey to bring assistance to the injured passengers of a [[de Havilland Fox Moth]] cabin plane he had seen crash into the sea at [[Big Bay, New Zealand|Big Bay]]. He covered the 90-kilometre, four-day journey in just 21 hours, a feat which earned him a [[King George VI Coronation Medal]] the following year.
==Hollyford Track and tourism==
[[File:Mt Tutoko, Hollyford Track (5845381298).jpg|thumb|Mt Tutoko, Hollyford Track]]
In 1936, Gunn began guiding tramping parties down his [[Hollyford Track]], and would continue doing so until his death in 1955. Friendly and hospitable by nature, and possessing considerable personal charm, Gunn became a well-known and popular figure. He was respected for his bushcraft, his energy, and his knowledge of the area.

On Christmas Day 1955, Gunn was fording the Hollyford River on horseback near [[Hidden Falls (New Zealand)|Hidden Falls]], with a 12-year-old boy mounted behind him. The horse stumbled and fell, and both riders were seen to find their feet in the river, until the horse stood up and they were both swept away and drowned. Gunn's body was never found.

After his death his son, Murray, continued to guide trampers in the area, and started "Gunn's Camp", a rest-stop for trampers with store and small museum, which still stands near the southern end of the track, around 10&amp;nbsp;km from the [[Milford Sound]]-[[Te Anau]] highway.

{{Liberalism sidebar |Ideas}}
'''Democratic capitalism''', also known as '''capitalist democracy''', is a political, economic and social ideology that involves the combination of a [[democracy|democratic]] [[political system]] with a [[capitalist]] [[economic system]]. It is based on a tripartite arrangement of a private sector-driven [[market economy]] based predominantly on a [[democracy|democratic]] [[policy]], economic incentives through [[free markets]], [[fiscal responsibility]] and a [[liberalism|liberal]] [[moral]]-[[cultural]] system which encourages [[pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Novak |first=Michael|title=[[The Spirit of Democratic Capitalism]] |authorlink=Michael Novak|url=|date=|accessdate=|edition=|publisher=|isbn=|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Benne |first=Robert|title=The Ethic of Democratic Capitalism|page=97|isbn=0-8006-1445-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ideology supports a capitalist economy subject to control by a democratic political system that is supported by the majority. It stands in contrast to [[corporatism]] by limiting the influence of special interest groups, including corporate lobbyists, on politics.

It is argued that the coexistence of modern capitalism and democracy was the result of the creation of the modern [[welfare state]] in the post-war period, which enabled a relatively stable political atmosphere and widespread support for capitalism. This period of history is often referred to as the "[[Golden Age of Capitalism]]".&lt;ref name="Capitalism and Inequality, 2013"&gt;''Capitalism and Inequality'', by Muller, Jerry Z. 2013. Foreign Affairs, March 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The ideology of "democratic capitalism" has been in existence since medieval times. It is based firmly on the principles of [[liberalism]] and [[Whig historiography]], which include liberty and equality. Some of its most prominent promoters were the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]] and subsequent [[Jeffersonian democracy|Jeffersonians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Prindle|first=David|title=The Paradox of Democratic Capitalism: Politics and Economics in American Thought|authorlink=David Prindle|isbn=0-8018-8411-X |page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13750">In [[organizational theory]], '''dynamic capability''' is the capability of an organization to purposefully adapt an organization's resource base. The concept was defined by [[David Teece]], Gary Pisano and Amy Shuen, in their 1997 paper ''Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management'', as "the firm’s ability to integrate, build, and reconfigure internal and external competences to address rapidly changing environments".&lt;ref name="Teece et al."&gt;{{cite journal|last2 = Pisano|first2 = Gary|last3 = Shuen|first3 = Amy|date = August 1997|title = Dynamic Capabilities and Strategic Management|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7%3C509::AID-SMJ882%3E3.0.CO;2-Z/epdf|journal = [[Strategic Management Journal]]|volume = 18|issue = 7|pages = 509–533|last1 = Teece|first1 = David|doi=10.1002/(sici)1097-0266(199708)18:7&lt;509::aid-smj882&gt;3.0.co;2-z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term is often used in the plural form, '''dynamic capabilities''', emphasizing that the ability to react adequately and timely to external changes requires a combination of multiple capabilities.

== Overview ==
The phrase "dynamic capabilities" was introduced in a working paper by [[David Teece]], [[Gary Pisano]], and Amy Shuen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Teece |first1=David |last2=Pisano |first2=Gary |last3=Shuen |first3=Amy |title=Firm Capabilities, Resources, and the Concept of Strategy |date=1990 |publisher=Center for Research on Management |location=University of California, Berkeley |edition=CCC Working Paper 90–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;The final, peer-reviewed version was published in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Teece |first1=David J. |last2=Pisano |first2=Gary |last3=Shuen |first3=Amy |title=Dynamic capabilities and strategic management |journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=August 1997 |volume=18 |issue=7 |pages=509–533 |doi=10.1002/(SICI)1097-0266(199708)18:7%3C509::AID-SMJ882%3E3.0.CO;2-Z}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of dynamic capabilities is similar in some ways to the previously existing concept of operational capabilities; the latter pertains to the current operations of an organization, whereas the former, by contrast, refers to an organization's capacity to efficiently and responsively change these operations and develop its resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Helfat|first1=Constance E. |last2=Finkelstein |first2=Sydney |last3=Mitchell |first3=Will |last4=Peteraf |first4=Margaret |last5=Singh |first5=Harbir |last6=Teece |first6=David |last7=Winter |first7=Sidney G. |title=Dynamic Capabilities: Understanding Strategic Change in Organizations |year=2009 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=9781405182065 |url= https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=u0Tuh5vixLkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22Dynamic+Capabilities:+Understanding+strategic+change+in+organizations |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main assumption of this framework is that an organization's basic competencies should be used to create short-term competitive positions that can be developed into longer-term competitive advantage. Nelson and Winter, in their 1982 book ''An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change'', link the growth of the concept of dynamic capabilities to the [[resource-based view]] of the firm and  the concept of "routines" in evolutionary theories of organization.&lt;ref name="Nelson1982"&gt;{{cite book|first=Richard R. |last=Nelson |title=An Evolutionary Theory of Economic Change |year=1982 |publisher=Belknap Press of Harvard University Press |isbn=978-0-674-27228-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Douma and Scheuder describe it as a bridge between the economics-based strategy literature and evolutionary approaches to organizations.&lt;ref name="DoumaSchreuder2002"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douma |first1=Sytse |authorlink1=Sytse Douma |last2=Schreuder |first2=Hein |authorlink2=Hein Schreuder |title=Economic Approaches to Organizations |edition=Third |year=2002 |publisher=Financial Times Prentice Hall |isbn=9780273651994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resource-based view of the firm emphasizes sustainable competitive advantage; the dynamic capabilities view, on the other hand, focuses more on the issue of competitive survival in response to rapidly changing contemporary business conditions.  Strategy scholars Gregory Ludwig and Jon Pemberton, in one of the few empirical studies on the topic, called for clarification of the specific processes of dynamic capability building in particular industries to make the concept more useful to senior managers who set directions for their firms.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2011 pp.215-236"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ludwig|first1=Gregory |last2=Pemberton |first2=Jon |title=A managerial perspective of dynamic capabilities in emerging markets: The case of the Russian steel industry |journal=Journal for East European Management Studies |issn=0949-6181 |year=2011 |volume=16 |issue=3 |pages=215–236 |jstor= 23281688}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dynamic capabilities theory concerns the development of strategies for senior managers of successful companies to adapt to radical discontinuous change, while maintaining minimum capability standards to ensure competitive survival.  For example, industries which have traditionally relied on a specific manufacturing process can't always change this process on short notice when a new technology arrives; when this happens, managers need to adapt their own routines to make the most of their existing resources while simultaneously planning for future process changes  as the resources depreciate.&lt;ref name="Ludwig 2011 pp.215-236"/&gt;

The New Dynamic Capabilities framework, posed by Amy Shuen in her analysis of Web 2.0, focuses on the firm's ability to quickly orchestrate and reconfigure externally sourced competences,ranging from Apple, Google Android, IBM Linux developer ecosystems to crowdsourced, crowdfunded open innovations such as the Obama08 mobile app—while leveraging internal resources such as platforms, know-how, user communities and digital, social and mobile networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Shuen |first1=Amy |last2=Sieber |first2=Sandra |title=Orchestrating the New Dynamic Capabilities |journal=IESE Insight Review|date=2009 |issue=3 |pages=58–65 |url= http://www.ieseinsight.com/review/articulo.aspx?doc=5445&amp;seccion=6 |accessdate=7 December 2017 |doi=10.15581/002.art-1605}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shuen |first=Amy |title=Web 2.0: A Strategy Guide: Business thinking and strategies behind successful Web 2.0 implementations |year=2008 |publisher=O'Reilly Media |isbn=9780596553753}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Dynamic Capabilities framework takes into account digital, information and network economics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shapiro |first1=Carl |last2=Varian |first2=Hal R. |title=Information Rules: A Strategic Guide to the Network Economy |year=1998 |publisher=Harvard Business Review Press |isbn=9780875848631}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the fall of the transaction costs of involved in using specialized services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Williamson |first=Oliver E. |title=Nobel Prize Lecture: Transaction Cost Economics: The Natural Progression |url= https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/economic-sciences/laureates/2009/williamson-lecture.html |website=nobelprize.org |date=8 December 2009 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Philip Cordes-Berszinn, though, more research is needed in order to measure the "capabilities" and to appropriately apply the ideas to practical management situations.&lt;ref name=berszinn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cordes-Berszinn|first1=Philip|title=Dynamic Capabilities: How Organisational Structures Affect Knowledge Processes|date=November 2013|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|url=http://www.palgrave.com/page/detail/dynamic-capabilities-philip-cordesberszinn/?K=9781137351272|accessdate=16 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Processes ==
A detailed description of processes and theoretical roots is provided by Arndt, Pierce, and Teece (2017). Teece, Pisano, and Shuen proposed three dynamic capabilities as necessary for an organization to meet new challenges:  the ability of employees to learn quickly and to build new strategic assets; the integration of these new strategic assets, including capability, technology and customer feedback, into company processes; and lastly the transformation or reuse of existing assets which have depreciated.&lt;ref name="Teece et al."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Eisenhardt and Martin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Eisenhardt|first1= Kathleen M.|last2= Martin|first2= Jeffrey A.|title=Dynamic capabilities:What are they? |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/1097-0266%28200010/11%2921:10/11%3C1105::AID-SMJ133%3E3.0.CO;2-E/abstract |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume= 21 |issue=10/11 |pages=1105–1122 |publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |date=October 2000|doi=10.1002/1097-0266(200010/11)21:10/11&lt;1105::AID-SMJ133&gt;3.0.CO;2-E |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Teece refers to successful implementation of these three stages as developing "corporate agility".&lt;ref name="dynamic"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Teece|first=David J.|title=Explicating Dynamic Capabilities: The Nature and Microfoundations of (Sustainable) Enterprise Performance |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.640/abstract |journal=Strategic Management Journal |volume= 28 |issue=13 |pages=1319–1350 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |date=August 2007 |doi=10.1002/smj.640 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stage, learning, requires employees and managers to reorganize their routines to promote interactions that lead to successful solutions to particular problems, to recognize and avoid dysfunctional activity and  strategic blind spots, and to make appropriate use of alliance and acquisition to bring new strategic assets into the firm from external sources. A practical example of this is provided by Jean-Pierre Jeannet and [[Hein Schreuder]], in their book ''From Coal to Biotech'', which lays out how the Dutch company [[DSM (company)|DSM]] transformed itself twice using 'strategic learning cycles'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeannet |first1=Jean-Pierre |first2=Hein |last2=Schreuder |year=2015 |title=From Coal to Biotech: The transformation of DSM with business school support |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783662462980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== New assets ===
In his 1988 book ''Managing Quality'', [[David A. Garvin]] states that quality performance depends on organisational routines for gathering and processing information, for linking customer experiences with engineering design choices and for coordinating factories and component suppliers.&lt;ref name="Garvin1988"&gt;{{cite book|first=David A. |last=Garvin |title=Managing Quality: The Strategic and Competitive Edge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K-LWY2qgSHwC|year=1988|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-0-02-911380-6|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increasingly competitive advantage also requires the integration of external activities and technologies through alliances and partnerships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahra |first1=Shaker A. |last2=Nielsen |first2=Anders P. |title=Sources of capabilities, integration and technology commercialization |journal=Strategic Management Journal |date=1 May 2002 |volume=23 |issue=5 |pages=377–398 |doi=10.1002/smj.229 |url= http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/smj.229/abstract |issn=1097-0266 |accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transformation of existing assets ===
Economists Amit and Schoemaker pointed out in 1993 that success in fast changing markets depends on reconfiguring the firm’s asset structure to accomplish rapid internal and external transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Khalid |first=Saba |title=Exploring Firm Level Market Knowledge Competence and Its Implications for the Speed and Success of Export Expansion: A Mixed Methodology Study from the Software Industry|date=2009|publisher=University of Vaasa|isbn=9789524762700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afJT6sXTyroC&amp;pg=PA25 |page=25|accessdate=7 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Firms must develop processes to make changes inexpensively while accomplishing reconfiguration and transformation ahead of the competition. This can be supported by decentralization, local autonomy and strategic alliances.

===Co-specialization ===
Another "dynamic capabilities" concept is co-specialization. For example, the physical assets, human resources and the intellectual property of a company, having developed together over time, are more valuable in combination than separately, and give a firm a sustainable competitive advantage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Douma |first1=Sytse |authorlink1=Sytse Douma |last2=Schreuder |first2=Hein |authorlink2=Hein Schreuder |title=Economic Approaches to Organisations |year=2013 |publisher=Pearson |isbn=9780273735298 |edition=Fifth |url= https://www.amazon.com/Economic-Approaches-Organisations-Sytse-Douma/dp/0273735292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1535">An '''End-user certificate''', or '''EUC''', is a document used in international transfers, including sales and arms provided as aid, of [[weapons]] and [[ammunition]] to certify that the buyer is the final recipient of the materials, and is not planning on transferring the materials to another party.  EUCs are required by many governments to restrict the flow of the materials to undesired destinations, such as [[embargo]]ed states or rebel groups, governments with bad human rights records or states which are considered a threat by the original supplier of the arms.

There are several problems with EUCs as a means to prevent undesirable [[arms exports]]. EUCs can be [[forgery|forged]] or falsified; they can also be obtained from [[corrupt]] officials, therefore there is a need for EUCs that are difficult to forge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://books.sipri.org/files/insight/SIPRIInsight1003.pdf |title=End-User Certificates: Improving standards to prevent diversion |accessdate=2010-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another problem is that an EUC does not guarantee that the arms recipient will actually live up to its promise not to re-transfer the weapons received. EUCs which are not backed up by proper end-use monitoring are weak. 

In 1936-1938, German arms were supplied to both sides in the [[Spanish Civil War]] via Greece using Greek then Mexican end-user certificates, see [[Pyrkal]].

The '''European Committee for Banking Standards''' ('''ECBS''') was formed in December 1992  by leading [[European Banking Federation|European banking associations]] to enhance the European technical banking infrastructure by developing standards.  In 2006 its functions were taken over by the [[European Payments Council]] and the committee was disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ecbs.org| title = European Committee for Banking Standards (ECBS)| accessdate = 2009-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.experian.co.uk/payments/glossary/ecbs-%28european-committee-for-banking-standards%29.html | title=ECBS - (European Committee for Banking Standards) | publisher=Experian | accessdate=August 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its website is now maintained by an independent group the European Banking Resources.

'''François Jean Baptiste Marie "Franz" Colruyt''' (14 December 1901, [[Lembeek]] - 4 November 1958, [[Halle, Belgium|Halle]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mandlonline.com/IMG/pdf/archives_mm_ef_entreprise.pdf Short biography]&lt;/ref&gt; is the founder of the Colruyt family business. Under his leadership, a business in colonial goods evolved into a wholesale business in dry food. 

== Family ==
{{main|Colruyt family}} 
Franz Colruyt was the second son in a family of 11 children. His father Joseph was a baker and had a store under the church tower of Lembeek (a borough of [[Halle,_Belgium|Halle]]). After his death, his son [[Jo Colruyt]] took over the company. 

==Career==
Franz Colruyt started working with his father and delivered food to stores and large consumers. In 1928, Franz Colruyt decided to shut down the bakery and start up a wholesale business in colonial goods, such as coffee and spices. Until the war, the wholesale business mainly serves stores around Halle and [[Tubize|Tubeke]]. 

After WW2, the business booms and new customers are found in and around [[Brussels]]. Franz Colruyt also starts bottling wine and roasting coffee. The family business grows into a food wholesaler. 

In 1950, Franz Colruyt founds the "Etablissementen Franz Colruyt nv" with a capital of 5 million francs (€ 125,000). His brothers Henri and Jules are also part of the business. 

In the 1950s, the first mini-supermarkets and supermarkets open in Belgium. As a reaction to this, Franz Colruyt opens the Boni stores. These are run by independent shopkeepers that buy goods from Colruyt. 

In 1958, his son Jo Colruyt takes over the company with his brothers. At that time, the company is already delivering to about 800 small independent stores and has about 150 employees. 

==Personal==
Franz Colruyt had a lot of attention for matters such as work simplification, efficiency, simplicity and working with production lines. This was also a necessity. He started his business during a crisis year. He concluded that low prices and low costs could help the company.

'''Hany M. Sala'am''' ({{lang-ar|هاني سلام}}) is the current chairman and CEO of [[Gulf Resources Corporation]] (GRC) an international group of companies specialising in the exploration and development of energy, mining and smelting of related natural resources. Sala'am graduated with a [[Bachelor of Science in Engineering|Bachelor of Science in Civil Engineering]]. Sala'am became a successful entrepreneur from the outset of his career establishing a network of companies throughout the Middle East, Europe, North America and Africa and has acted as Chairman to GRC since its inception.

== Family Background ==
Sala'am born in Lebanon was raised in a successful business and politically orientated family which presumably formed the basis of his future entrepreneurial and diplomatic activities. His father Muhammad Salaam in partnership with his paternal uncle Saeb Sala'am founded [[Middle East Airlines]] (Lebanon’s national airline) in 1948. Saeb Sala'am also served as Prime Minister of Lebanon as did another of Sala'am’s paternal uncles [[Rashid Karami]]. On Sala'am’s maternal side his uncle Dr. Hussein Fakri Khalidi served as Prime Minister of Jordan.

Sala'am's eldest daughter [[Princess Ghida al-Talal|Ghida]] married HRH [[Prince Talal bin Muhammad|Prince Talal Bin Muhammad]] a Jordanian Royal in Amman July, 1991. They have two sons and one daughter: Prince Hussein, Prince Muhammad &amp; Princess Raaja. Princess Ghida acts as chairperson to the [[King Hussein Cancer Center]] in Jordan.

== Political Endeavours ==
Sala'am served his country as a Presidential Envoy under the governments of Presidents [[Suleiman Franjieh]], [[Elias Sarkis]] and [[Amin Gemayel]]. He achieved success as Head of the Lebanese delegation and with his partner [[Mahdi Al Tajir]] negotiated with the late President [[Hafez al-Assad]], securing the peace accords (known as Taif) which ended the [[Lebanese Civil War]].

== Gulf Resources Corporation “GRC” ==
GRC was formed in the late 1979 by its current Chairman (Sala'am), and began operations as a civil engineering contractor. Shortly after, an association with the [[Kaiser Aluminium and Chemical Corporation|Kaiser Aluminium Company]] led to the success of Alba, the first aluminium smelting company in Bahrain. GRC then embarked on a grand smelter scheme with [[Kaiser Aluminium]] to launch a massive joint venture including oil refining and aluminium smelting in Qatar, UAE &amp; Saudi Arabia. This development set the course for the emergence of gas and oil based process industries that expanded on a global scale. GRC also owned and operated a manganese mine in Western Australia under the leadership of Simon Farrell. The group since has diversified into a wide field of operations. These include engineering, industrial management, project management, real estate development, finance and investment, representation and trading. The successful development of GRC owes much to the contributions of key individuals who served for periods as board members. These include Timothy Ready (Chairman &amp; CEO of [[Kaiser Aluminium]] and President of Primary Producers of Aluminium), Jean Ping &amp; [[Lord Hanson]].

In 1996 Sala'am and “GRC” was involved in a commercial dispute with [[Dubal|Dubal Aluminium]]. The dispute was later amicably settled out of court in 1998.

== Educational Activities ==
Sala'am supports various charitable and educational ventures. One of his most notable educational ventures was the establishment of [http://msfs.georgetown.edu/admissions/salaamcenter/ Sala'am Intercultural Resource Centre] in [[Georgetown University]], Washington DC. The Sala'am Centre was established by a grant from the Sala'am Family and dedicated by former president [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1989. The Sala'am Centre houses the [[Master of Science in Foreign Service|MSFS]] (Master of Science in Foreign Services) programme. The centre provides its students with exclusive educational tools/materials and organises high-profile seminars aimed at the promotion of a better international and cultural understanding. Sala'am has also been known to personally sponsor the University education of many deserving student.

== Honours ==
HM King [[Ja'afar of Negeri Sembilan|Ja'afar of Malaysia]] bestowed on Sala'am the prestigious title of [[Dato' Seri]] and was also awarded with the [[Congressional Medal of Honour|Congressional Medal of Honour of the Philippines]].

'''James Moore''' (c. 1650 – 1706) was the [[Kingdom of England|English]] governor of [[Province of Carolina|colonial Carolina]] between 1700 and 1703. He is best known for leading several invasions of [[Spanish Florida]] during [[Queen Anne's War]], including attacks in 1704 and 1706 which wiped out most of the [[Spanish missions in Florida]].&lt;ref name="Doak2007"/&gt; He captured and brought back to Carolina as slaves thousands of [[Apalachee|Apalachee Indians]].

==Early life==
Little is known of James Moore's origins. During his life he was said to be a son of Roger Moore (also known as [[Rory O'Moore]] or Ruairí Óg Ó Mórdha), leader of the [[Irish Rebellion of 1641]] and that he had supposedly inherited his father's rebellious nature.&lt;ref name="Heitzler2005-275"/&gt; He first appears in the records of the [[Province of Carolina]] in 1675 representing Margaret Berringer Yeamans, widow of Sir [[John Yeamans]], before the colonial council. At about the same time he married her daughter by her first husband, also named Margaret.

==Political career==

In 1677, 1682, and 1683, he served on the colonial council. He played a leading role in a 1690 expedition into the Carolina back country, crossing the [[Appalachian Mountains]] to investigate possibilities of trade with the local Indian population. In 1698 he was elected to the colonial assembly, and was described as the right-hand-man of proprietor Sir John Colleton. The next year he was named chief justice of the colony, a post he held until he was named governor in 1700, replacing the deceased [[Joseph Blake (governor)|Joseph Blake]].

James Moore was a leader of one of colonial South Carolina's political factions, called the "Goose Creek Men", after [[Goose Creek, South Carolina|Goose Creek]], an outlying area of [[Charleston, South Carolina|Charleston]].&lt;ref name="Heitzler2005-275"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heitzler|first=Michael James|title=Goose Creek, A Definitive History: Volume One, Planters, Politicians and Patriots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32l9iEyKUxkC&amp;pg=PA275|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-055-6|page=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1683 Moore was granted {{convert|2400|acre}} by the [[Lords Proprietor#Carolina|Lords Proprietors]]. He called his estate "Boochowee". Part of this land is known today as Liberty Hall Plantation.&lt;ref name="Heitzler2005-275"/&gt;

From 1691 Moore was the acknowledged leader of the Goose Creek Men, the main political opposition to the ruling "[[English Dissenters|Dissenter]]" faction. Moore's rise to governorship in 1700 signalled a major shift in the politics of the colony. The Dissenters contested Moore's "unjust election". But the Lords Proprietors saw to it that Moore remained governor, and they made it clear that the Dissenters were no longer in favor.&lt;ref name="Edgar1998"&gt;{{cite book|last=Edgar|first=Walter B.|title=South Carolina: a history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EFSbwGk2szgC&amp;pg=PA93|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=1998|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-255-4|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1700 and 1703 Moore was the [[British Empire|British]] governor of Carolina, which was then in the process of dividing into the provinces of [[Province of North Carolina|North]] and [[Province of South Carolina|South Carolina]]. During this period, he led a number of attacks from the Carolinas into [[Spanish Florida]]. He relied on allied Indian tribes, especially the [[Yamasee]] for most of his military force. On news of the outbreak of [[Queen Anne's War]] in 1702, he led 500 colonists, 300 native allies, and 14 small ships on an invasion of Spanish Florida along the coast, destroying the remaining Spanish missionary Indians of [[Guale]] and [[Mocama]], and devastating the lands around [[St. Augustine, Florida|St. Augustine]]. While the town of St. Augustine was razed, its central fortress, [[Castillo de San Marcos]], where the Spanish and numerous allied Indians had taken refuge, [[Siege of St. Augustine (1702)|resisted Moore's siege]].&lt;ref name="Doak2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Doak|first=Robin|title=South Carolina 1540-1776|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uWASfc2EuawC&amp;pg=PA48|accessdate=8 October 2011|date=14 August 2007|publisher=National Geographic Books|isbn=978-1-4263-0066-0|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RowlandMoore1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowland|first1=Lawrence Sanders|last2=Moore|first2=Alexander|last3=Rogers|first3=George C.|title=The History of Beaufort County, South Carolina: 1514-1861|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WjdhnfG0tYcC&amp;pg=PA88|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=1996|publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press|isbn=978-1-57003-090-1|pages=88–89}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1702 campaign was viewed as a disaster due to the failure to take the fortress and the expenses incurred, and Moore resigned his post.

In 1704, Moore led an expedition of 50 Englishmen and 1,000 [[Creek people|Creek]], Yamasee, and other allied Indians, into western Florida, leading to the [[Apalachee Massacre]]. The [[Apalachee]] were the last powerful Spanish-allied Indian nation in the region.  Their defeat in 1704 resulted in many Apalachee being enslaved and taken from Charleston to the West Indies.  Other Apalachee were relocated (some voluntarily, others not) to the [[Savannah River]] to live in semi-serfdom.  Another result of the defeat of the Apalachee was the collapse of the final defence of the Indians of Florida.  In the following years, Carolinian and Indian slave raiders virtually wiped out the Indian population of Florida all the way to the [[Florida Keys]].

Moore's defeat of the Apalachee in Spanish Florida was hailed as a major victory for Carolina, which had been fighting with the Spanish for control of the region for decades.  It also served to strengthen ties between various southeastern Indians and Carolina.  The [[Creek people]] and the [[Cherokee]]s became much more closely allied with Carolina. With these two Indian nations as strong allies, the English rose to a position of dominance over the French and Spanish in the American southeast.

Governor Moore died in 1706 of a tropical disease, possibly [[yellow fever]].  He was significantly in debt. His son by the same name was elected to the same office in 1719 following the overthrow of the proprietary governor.

==Family==

James Moore married Margaret Berringer, daughter of Lady Margaret Yeamans (by a previous marriage).&lt;ref name="Heitzler2005-160"&gt;{{cite book|last=Heitzler|first=Michael James|title=Goose Creek, A Definitive History: Volume One, Planters, Politicians and Patriots|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=32l9iEyKUxkC&amp;pg=PA160|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=2005|publisher=The History Press|isbn=978-1-59629-055-6|pages=160, 272}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their daughter, Mary Moore, married Job Howe, another of the "Goose Creek Men".&lt;ref name="Heitzler2005-160"/&gt; Altogether James and Margaret had ten children, many of whom moved to the [[Cape Fear (region)|Lower Cape Fear]] region, where they and their descendants became known as "The Family", the most powerful family in the region.&lt;ref name="OlwellTully2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Olwell|first1=Robert|last2=Tully|first2=Alan|title=Cultures and identities in colonial British America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6XqEkzVWNnkC&amp;pg=PA60|accessdate=8 October 2011|year=2006|publisher=JHU Press|isbn=978-0-8018-8251-7|pages=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Moore was the grandfather of [[American Revolutionary War]] [[Brigadier General]] [[James Moore (Continental Army officer)|James Moore]], and great-grandfather of [[Major General]] [[Robert Howe (soldier)|Robert Howe]].

The Moore family imported over 4,000 [[African slavery|slaves]] into the Carolinas, mostly for its own extensive plantations and farms in and around the Cape Fear area of what later became North Carolina. James Moore also had a house in Charleston and another in the Goose Creek area near Charleston.

Another Moore family descendent, [[Alfred Moore]], became a Justice of the [[US Supreme Court]].

'''Jose Yao Campos''' (1922 – May 1, 2016), also known by his Chinese name '''Yao Cho Diat''', was a [[Filipino-Chinese]] businessman best known as the founder of United Laboratories, and as the first of [[Ferdinand Marcos]]' closest cronies to enter into a settlement deal with the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG).

Successfully becoming a major player in the local Pharmaceuticals manufacturing industry by cofounding UNILAB after [[World War II]], he became early supporter of Philippine dictator Ferdinand Marcos, who tapped him as a "Financial Advisor."  In 1986, the Presidential Commission on Good Government cited him for having served as a "front man" for various "ill-gotten" wealth, including $52.5 million of real estate representing the most prominent [[Marcos Mansions]].  He then became the first of the [[Marcos cronies]] to make a deal with the PCGG in exchange for immunity from suit.  By the time he died in 2016, Yao Campos' family had become one of the Philippines' most powerful business clans, with UNILAB helmed by his firstborn, Joy Campos Hess and her son, Clinton Hess; his eldest son Joselito Yao founding condiments company Nutri-Asia and occupying top positions in Del Monte Philippines and the Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation; and his youngest child Jeffrey running Greenfields Development Corporation.

== Early life and move to the Philippines ==
Campos was born Yao Cho Diat in Ha-ngo-po, a village in Jinjing Town, [[Jinjiang, Fujian|Jinjiang]], part of modern-day [[Quanzhou]], China.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508" /&gt; He lived there as a youth and was educated in the Chinese classics until he was old enough to be accepted for admission to the [[Whampoa Military Academy]] established by [[Sun Yat-sen]]—an honor which he described as "''the ultimate dream of all patriotic Chinese boys.''"&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; Instead of allowing him to attend the academy, however, his father sent Yao to [[Quezon province]] in the Philippines, where he would learn business skills from his older brother Yao Shiong Shio, who was already a successful trader.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2006/05/08/335608/who-will-be-next-taipans |title=Who will be the next taipans? |last=Flores |first=Wilson Lee |date=May 8, 2016 |work=The [[Philippine Star]] |access-date=September 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yao started out as a worker at his brother's buntal hat business before the war, and survived the [[Second World War]] by making his living as a buy-and-sell trader.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508" /&gt;

He eventually took "Jose Yao Campos" as his Filipino name.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/lifestyle/business-life/2006/08/21/354033/pharmaceutical-king146s-little-told-tale |title=The Pharmaceutical King's Little-Told Tale |last=Flores |first=Wilson Lee |date=August 21, 2006 |work=The [[Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Foundation of UNILAB ==
{{see also|Labor policy in the Philippines}}
Soon after the end of World War II in 1945, Yao Campos partnered with Mariano K. Tan to build a drugstore on Sto. Cristo Street in [[Binondo, Manila]].&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; (Some sources also mention an American soldier named Robert Horowitz as Yao Campos' partner in charge of production when the drugstore was first built.&lt;ref name="Domenec2017"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Business ethics in action : seeking human excellence in organizations |last=Domènec. |first=Melé, |date=2009 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9781137074683 |location=Basingstoke [England] |oclc=891470965}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Describing the beginnings of the company, Yao Campos' brother-in-law and later UNILAB president Howard Q. Dee&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; later recounted:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Unilab started with humble beginnings as a small manufacturing enterprise. Our offices and modest production facilities were located in JY’s residential compound in [[Santa Mesa]]. We literally began as a home industry with no more than 30 employees. With the new monetary policies, in no time, a dozen foreign pharmaceutical companies established large manufacturing facilities. Unilab was the smallest but under the leadership of JY, we developed a game plan like no other. Our strategic planning showed us the way to segment the pharma market with a multi-divisional approach that would enable us to compete on all fronts. The keys were product sourcing and planning, synergism in promotions and distribution outreach."&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

By 1959, after only fourteen years in operation, Yao Campos and Tan, with the help of Yao Campos' brother-in-law Dee, had transformed United Drug into United Laboratories, with the highest share of the Philippine pharmaceuticals market among all the Philippines' local drug manufacturers.&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt; This was attributed to the values Yao Campos was said to have instilled in the company, which admirers described as "the [[Confucianism|Confucian values]] of hard work, frugality, discipline, perseverance, filial piety to parents and ancestors, love of education and delayed personal gratification."&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt;

Under Yao Campos, UNILAB remained a proudly non-unionized company, with a company-initiated Employee Board providing benefits to employees instead of a union negotiating with the company on their behalf.&lt;ref name="Atienza2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060821"/&gt;  Unionization was so much of “a no-no to the owners” of UNILAB that they went as far as to hire a feng shui expert to redesign their corporate headquarters in response to a 1996 incident in which union organizers nearly succeeded in forming a union.&lt;ref name="Atienza2002"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Shrewd Business Tactics |last=Atienza |first=A.T. |year=2002 |isbn=9780595227235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early support of Ferdinand Marcos ==
Campos was an early supporter of [[Ferdinand Marcos]], making campaign contributions as early as Marcos’ first Congressional run in 1946.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1986-03-23/news/8601210600_1_jose-y-campos-eduardo-cojuangco-ferdinand-marcos |title=Marcos Graft Staggering: Investigators Trace Billions In Holdings |last=Crewdson |first=John |date=March 23, 1986 |work=Chicago Tribune}}&lt;/ref&gt; He would eventually become one of the closest among Marcos’ cronies, along with [[Danding Cojaungco]] and [[Roberto Benedicto]].&lt;ref name="FloresWilsonLee20060508" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Although critics of the Marcos administration would later note that [[Cronies of Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos’ cronies]] managed to make huge fortunes despite not being known as particularly good businessmen, Yao Campos and [[Rolando Gapud]] were often considered the notable exceptions, because of their established business record from before Marcos’ presidency.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Nevertheless, Marcos’ stint in the legislature allowed him to favor Yao Campos’ business. &lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326"/&gt; Having won as congressman, Marcos was soon made chairman of the House Committee on Commerce and Industry.&lt;ref name="DNDMarcos"&gt;{{Cite web |title="Ferdinand E. Marcos" |last=Department of National Defense |first=Government of the Republic of the Philippines |website=Department of National Defense website}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When he won a seat in the senate later, he became a member of the Senate Special Committee on Import and Price Controls and on Reparations.&lt;ref name="DNDMarcos" /&gt; This allowed Marcos to make his fortune by selling import licenses to businessmen.&lt;ref name="JariusBondoc20160815"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/opinion/2016/08/15/1613577/plunder-be-glorified-marcos-libingan |title=Plunder to be Glorified with Marcos at the Libingan |last=Bondoc |first=Jarius |date=August 15, 2016  |work=The [[Philippine Star]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His campaign benefactor Yao Campos’ company UNILAB was granted exclusive import licences in the Pharmaceuticals industry.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Because UNILAB’s market dominance turned it into a major supplier of pharmaceuticals for government health programs, Yao Campos found one more way to help build up Ferdinand Marcos during campaigns: by supplying the government with medicine packs branded “Medical Assistance to Rural Communities and Other Sectors” – the acronym for which spelled out “M.A.R.C.O.S.” &lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

Marcos eventually asked Campos to became godfather to both Imee and Bongbong Marcos.&lt;ref name="JohnCrewdson19860326" /&gt;

== "Front man" for the Marcoses ==
As an early supporter of Marcos, Yao Campos became a Financial advisor to the president.  While it was Roberto Benedicto who helped the Marcoses open a Swiss bank account under the fictitious names "William Saunders" and "Jane Ryan", it was Yao Campos organized 40 different [[Shell corporation|shell companies]] through whose bank accounts the Marcoses could later transfer the Saunders account money, giving them multiple additional layers beneath which to hide their identity.&lt;ref name="DaleRussakoff19860330"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1986/03/30/the-philippines-anatomy-of-a-looting/620251dc-cffe-46f3-be40-a248f501882c/ |title=The Philippines: Anatomy of a Looting |last=Russakoff |first=Dale |date=March 30, 1986 |work=The [[Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also served as the Marcoses' "front man| for various assets and properties.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies Philip M. Lustre Jr. |date= February 25, 2016 |url=https://www.rappler.com/newsbreak/in-depth/123667-marcos-cronies-compromise}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely publicized of these properties include the most prominent [[Marcos mansions]]—over P2.5 billion ($52.5 million) worth in real estate located in [[Metro Manila]], [[Rizal province|Rizal]], [[Laguna province|Laguna]], [[Cavite]], [[Bataan]] and [[Baguio City]].&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"&gt;{{cite news|title=Search for Marcos' wealth: Compromising with cronies Philip M.

Yao Campos was in Canada in 1986 &lt;ref name ="SethMydans19860522"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/22/world/philippines-seizes-a-big-corporation.html |title=Philippines Seizes a Big Corporation |last=Mydans  |first=Seth |date=May 22, 1986 |work=The [[New York Times]] |access-date=September 28, 2018 |language=en}}PHILIPPINES SEIZES A BIG CORPORATION By SETH MYDANS and SPECIAL TO THE NEW YORK TIMES &lt;/ref&gt; when Corazon Aquino’s Revolutionary Government took over the Philippines after the Marcoses were deposed by the EDSA revolution.  He was the first among the Marcos cronies to make a deal with the Aquino government in exchange for immunity from suit,&lt;ref name="SethMydans19860522" /&gt; and the deal he struck with the [[Presidential Commission on Good Government]] (PCGG) was one of the agency’s earliest successes.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt;

The 1986 settlement involved PhP 250 Million in cash and PhP 2.5 Billion worth of titles to 197 properties in Metro Manila, Rizal, Laguna, Cavite, Bataan, and Baguio—all of which Yao Campos admitted were under his name but actually part of the ill-gotten wealth of Ferdinand Marcos.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt;
It also included a building on Efipanio de Los Santos Avenue (EDSA) where [[Imee Marcos]] had an office before the EDSA revolution, which eventually became the headquarters of the PCGG.&lt;ref name="SCMP20130505"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1227453/embarrassment-riches |title=Embarrassment of Riches |date=May 5, 2013 |work=South China Morning Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130506033913/http://www.scmp.com/magazines/post-magazine/article/1227453/embarrassment-riches |archive-date=May 6, 2013 |dead-url=No |publication-place=Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the Marcos family confirmed that the properties surrendered by Yao Campos to the PCGG in 1986 were indeed owned by Ferdinand Marcos, arguing that Yao Campos should not have surrendered them to the government because “''under a constructive trust in favor of the estate of the former president.''”&lt;ref name="RainierAllanRonda20171122"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.philstar.com/headlines/2007/11/22/28940/fm-heirs-want-cronyrsquos-assets-returned |title=FM heirs want crony’s assets returned |last=Ronda |first=Rainier Allan |date=November 22, 2007 |work=The Philippine Star |access-date=August 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Later life, death, and family empire ==
After the [[People Power Revolution]], Yao Campos earned a reputation as the most media-shy of all the Philippines’ taipans.&lt;ref name="PhilipLustreJr20160225"/&gt;  By the time Yao Campos died on Labor Day, May 1, 2016, UNILAB had become  the Philippines’ largest drug-manufacturing company, helmed by his eldest child, Joy Campos Hess and her son, Clinton Hess.&lt;ref name="Town&amp;Country2016"/&gt;

The rest of Yao Campos' children have also become dominant forces in their own industries, making the Yao Campos family one of the Philippines’ most powerful business clans.  Yao Campos’ eldest son and namesake, Joselito D. Yao Camoos, left UNILAB to found  the condiments company Nutri-Asia,&lt;ref name="Town&amp;Country2016"/&gt; and is now also vice chairman of [[Del Monte Foods|Del Monte]] Philippines, and chairman of [[Fort Bonifacio Development Corporation]].&lt;ref name="Town&amp;Country2016"/&gt;

Baron {{nihongo|'''Kishichiro Okura'''|大倉 喜七郎|Ōkura Kishichirō|June 16, 1882 &amp;ndash; February 2, 1963}} was a Japanese entrepreneur and hotelier. 

== Biography ==
He was a son of [[Okura Kihachiro]] (1837-1928) who as an entrepreneur built up the Okura-gumi and founded the giant Okura [[Zaibatsu]] (family owned conglomerate) and the Okura [[Shogyo]] Gakko which later became [[Tokyo Keizai University]] (Tokyo University of Economics) in 1949. 

He studied at [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from 1903 to 1906 but he did not graduate from [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]]. 

Okura competed in the first ever car race held at [[Brooklands]] in [[Surrey]] on July 6, 1907 and came second. He is one of the pioneers who introduced the motor car to Japan. He was the President of the Imperial Hotel, and the [[Okura Hotels|Okura luxury hotel chain]] is still an important one in Japan today.

Okura Kishichiro was a primary patron in the establishment of the [[Nihon Ki-in]] or Japanese Go Association in 1924, organizing and supporting professional go players in Japan following the [[Meiji Restoration]] and subsequent ceasing of government support for the [[four go houses]].

He also invented the musical instrument [[Okraulo]], a type of vertical flute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shukokan.org/english/index.html#link04 |title=Okraulo |website=Oruka Shukokan |publisher=公益財団法人 大倉文化財団 |date=7 July 2016 |accessdate= 28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
An '''output contract''' is an [[contract|agreement]] in which a producer agrees to sell his or her entire production to the buyer, who in turn agrees to purchase the entire output. Example: an almond grower enters into an ''output contract'' with an almond packer: thus the producer has a "home" for output of nuts, and the packer of nuts is happy to try the particular product. The converse of this situation is a [[requirements contract]], under which a seller agrees to supply the buyer with as much of a good or service as the buyer wants, in exchange for the buyer's agreement not to buy that good or service elsewhere.

[[Uniform Commercial Code]] comment section 2-306: A term which measures the quantity by the output of the seller or the requirements of the buyer, means such actual output or requirements that may occur in good faith. [[Good faith]] cessation of production terminates any further obligations thereunder and excuses further performance by the party discontinuing production. However, the cessation of production must be in light of [[bankruptcy]] or other similar situations. The yield of less profit from a sale than expected does not excuse further performance of an output contract. See Feld vs. Henry S. Levy &amp; Sons, Inc. (New York, 1975)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.casebriefs.com/blog/law/commercial-law/commercial-law-keyed-to-lopucki/performance/feld-v-henry-s-levy-sons-inc/ Brief at CaseBriefs.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.leagle.com/decision/197476545AD2d720_2489/FELD%20v.%20HENRY%20S.%20LEVY%20&amp;%20SONS,%20INC.

'''Phoenix New City''' or '''Phoenix New Town'''  ({{Zh|s=凤凰新城|t=鳳凰新城}}) is a [[district of China|special district]] of [[Tangshan]], [[People's Republic of China|China]] that developed as its [[central business district]].

==Economy==

Taking advantage of its good ecological environment, Phoenix New City, which is under construction, aims at the domestic first-class CBD development standards. Sixty-eight key projects are comprehensively promoted with a total investment of 63.5 billion [[Renminbi|yuan]].

Different from the traditional expansion type of many cities, Phoenix New City aims at the highest town planning standards in developed countries from the very beginning with commercial, administrative, culture, and green land axes co-existing. "Eco-oriented", "new urbanism", "smart growth" and other advanced international concepts were introduced into the construction to build the domestic first class central business district with eco-tourism and leisure, business services, financial center, the headquarters base, high technology, creative cultural industries, etc.

In accordance with the strategy of inviting business (focusing on inviting global business and strategic investors to improve core competitiveness) which was brought up in early 2010, the Administrative Committee of Tangshan Phoenix New City targeted at [[Fortune 500]] companies home and abroad to carry out a variety of effective activities to invite business, which achieved remarkable results. In 2010, Tangshan received 200 batches of Chinese and foreign visiting groups. Among these groups, 11 are from global Fortune 500 enterprises, 16 are from China fortune 500 enterprises, and 15 are from China's top 500 private enterprises and top 100 specialized enterprises.

Among these projects, the residential and commercial projects co-developed by Hong Kong Kerry Group and China Resources Land Group, as well as the residential and commercial projects co-developed by China Water Power Group and China Petroleum Jidong Oil Company started construction. The South Korean Lotte urban complex project and Pangda Automobile Trade Group Jidong Material Building project reached an agreement with the administrative committee and will start construction in 2011. Yicheng Group urban complex project and Beijing Wanke real estate project will be started soon.

Late communism produced sizable, specific middle classes of relatively well-educated professionals, technicians and even highly skilled blue-collar workers. [...] These classes had no attachment whatsoever to Marxist-Leninist ideology, while they became attracted to the Western way of life. Many members of the ruling 'nomenklatura' shared the same sentiments, as Western consumerism and individualism seemed more attractive to them than communist collective Puritanism. There were two very important consequences of this, one economic, and the second political. The economic one was the attractiveness of consumerism [...].

On 4 June 1989, the trade union [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] won an overwhelming victory in a [[Polish legislative election, 1989|partially free election in Poland]], leading to the peaceful fall of Communism in that country in the summer of 1989. Also in June 1989, Hungary began dismantling its section of the physical [[Iron Curtain]], leading to an exodus of East Germans through Hungary, which destabilised East Germany. This led to mass demonstrations in cities such as [[Leipzig]] and subsequently to the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]] in November 1989, which served as the symbolic gateway to [[German reunification]] in 1990.

The [[Dissolution of the Soviet Union|Soviet Union dissolved]] in December 1991, resulting in eleven new countries ([[Armenia]], [[Azerbaijan]], [[Belarus]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Kazakhstan]], [[Kyrgyzstan]], [[Moldova]], [[Russia]], [[Tajikistan]], [[Turkmenistan]], [[Ukraine]] and [[Uzbekistan]]) which had declared their independence from the Soviet Union in the course of the year while the [[Baltic states]] ([[Estonia]], [[Latvia]] and [[Lithuania]]) [[Occupation of the Baltic states|regained]] their independence in September 1991. The rest of the Soviet Union, which constituted the bulk of the area, became the [[Russian Federation]] in December 1991. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Albania]] and [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] abandoned Communism between 1990 and 1992. By 1992, Yugoslavia had split into five successor states, namely [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Croatia]], [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]], [[Slovenia]] and the [[Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which was later renamed [[Serbia and Montenegro]] in 2003 and eventually split in 2006 into two states, namely [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]]. Serbia was then further split with the breakaway of the [[International recognition of Kosovo|partially recognised]] state of [[Kosovo]] in 2008. [[Czechoslovakia]] dissolved three years after the end of Communist rule, splitting peacefully into the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Slovakia]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://www.cecl.gr/RigasNetwork/databank/Constitutions/Yugoslavia.html | publisher = CECL |date=1992-04-27 | accessdate = 2013-08-12 | place = [[Greece|GR]] | title = Constitution | contribution = Yugoslavia}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The impact of these events made itself felt in several [[Socialist countries]]. Communism was abandoned in countries such as [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition and State of Cambodia (1989–1992)|Cambodia]] (1991), [[People's Democratic Republic of Ethiopia|Ethiopia]] (1990), [[People's Republic of Mongolia|Mongolia]] (which in 1990 [[Mongolian legislative election, 1990|democratically re-elected]] a Communist government that ran the country until [[Mongolian legislative election, 1996|1996]]) and [[South Yemen]] (1990).

During the adoption of varying forms of [[market economy]], there was a [[1990s#Economics|general decline in living standards]] for many former Communist countries.&lt;ref name="Living standards CR"&gt;{{cite book|title= Vývoj vybraných ukazatelů životní úrovně v České republice v letech 1993&amp;nbsp;– 2008| year = 2009 | publisher= Odbor analýz a statistiky.

Many communist and socialist organisations in the West turned their guiding principles over to [[social democracy]] and [[democratic socialism]]. Communist parties in [[Italy]] and [[San Marino]] suffered and the [[Mani Pulite|reformation of the Italian political class]] took place in the early 1990s. In [[South America]], the [[Pink tide]] had instead begun, starting with [[Venezuela]] in 1999 and sweeping through the early 2000s. The [[Politics of Europe|European political landscape]] changed drastically, with several former Eastern Bloc countries joining [[NATO]] and the [[European Union]], resulting in stronger economic and social integration with Western Europe and the [[United States]].

[[File:Kolejka.jpeg|thumb|Queue waiting to enter a store, a typical view in [[History of Poland (1945–1989)|Poland in the 1980s]]]]
[[Socialism]] had been gaining momentum among working class citizens of the world since the 19th century. These culminated in the early 20th century when several [[State (polity)|states]] and [[colonies]] formed their own [[communist parties]]. Many of the countries involved had [[hierarchical structure]]s with [[monarchic]] governments and [[aristocracy (class)|aristocratic]] social structures with an established [[nobility]]. Socialism was undesirable within the circles of the [[ruling class]]es (which had begun to include industrial business leaders) in the late 19th/early 20th century states; as such, [[communism]] was repressed. Its champions suffered persecution while people were discouraged from adopting it. This had been the practice even in states which identified as exercising a multi-party system.

The [[Russian Revolution]] of 1917 saw the first [[communist state]] in the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]] (USSR), when the [[Bolsheviks]] overthrew the [[Russian Provisional Government|provisional government]].

During the period between the world wars, communism had been on the rise in many parts of the world, especially in towns and cities. This led to a series of purges in many countries to stifle the movement. Violent resistance to this repression led to an increase in support for communism in Central and Eastern Europe.

In the early stages of [[World War II]], both Nazi Germany and the USSR invaded and occupied the countries of Eastern Europe after the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]]. Germany then turned against and invaded the USSR: the battles of this [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Eastern Front]] were the largest in history. The USSR joined with the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and in conferences at [[Tehran Conference|Tehran]] and [[Yalta Conference|Yalta]], the Allies agreed that Central and Eastern Europe would be in the "Soviet sphere of political influence.". The USSR fought the Germans to a standstill and finally began driving them back, reaching Berlin before the end of the war. Nazi ideology was violently [[anti-communist]], and the Nazis brutally suppressed communist movements in the countries it occupied. Communists played a large part in the [[Resistance during World War II|resistance to the Nazis]] in these countries. As the Soviets forced the Germans back, they assumed temporary control of these devastated areas.

After World War II, the Soviets ensured that communists loyal to Moscow took power in the countries it occupied. The Soviets retained troops throughout these territories. The [[Cold War]] saw these states, bound together by the [[Warsaw Pact]], have continuing tensions with the capitalist west, bound together by [[NATO]]. The [[Chinese Revolution (1949)|Chinese Revolution]] established communism in [[China]] in 1949.

During the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], a spontaneous nationwide anti-authoritarian revolt, the Soviet Union invaded Hungary to assert control. Similarly, in 1968, the USSR repressed the [[Prague Spring]] by organizing the [[Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia]].

=== Emergence of Solidarity in Poland ===
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
Labour turmoil in Poland during 1980 had led to the formation of the independent [[trade union]], [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], led by [[Lech Wałęsa]], which over time became a political force. On 13 December 1981, Polish Prime Minister [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]] started a crackdown on Solidarity by declaring [[martial law in Poland]], suspending the union, and temporarily imprisoning all of its leaders.

=== Mikhail Gorbachev ===
{{main|Mikhail Gorbachev|Perestroika|Glasnost|Democratisation in the Soviet Union}}
Although several Eastern bloc countries had attempted some abortive, limited economic and political reform since the 1950s (e.g. the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]] and [[Prague Spring]] of 1968), the ascension of reform-minded Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] in 1985 signaled the trend toward greater liberalization. During the mid-1980s, a younger generation of Soviet [[apparatchiks]], led by Gorbachev, began advocating fundamental reform in order to reverse years of [[Brezhnev stagnation]]. After decades of growth, the Soviet Union was now facing a period of severe economic decline and needed Western technology and credits{{clarify|date=March 2017}} to make up for its increasing backwardness. The costs of maintaining its military, the [[KGB]], subsidies to foreign client states etc., further strained the moribund [[Soviet economy]].

The first signs of major reform came in 1986 when Gorbachev launched a policy of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) in the Soviet Union, and emphasized the need for ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). By the spring of 1989, the Soviet Union had not only experienced lively media debate, but had also held its first multi-candidate elections in the newly established [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|Congress of People's Deputies]]. While glasnost ostensibly advocated openness and political criticism, these were only permitted within a narrow spectrum dictated by the state. The general public in the [[Eastern bloc]] was still subject to [[secret police]] and political repression.

Gorbachev urged his Central and Southeast European counterparts to imitate ''perestroika'' and ''glasnost'' in their own countries. However, while reformists in Hungary and Poland were emboldened by the force of liberalization spreading from the east, other [[Eastern bloc]] countries remained openly skeptical and demonstrated aversion to reform. Believing Gorbachev's reform initiatives would be short-lived, hardline communist rulers like [[East Germany]]'s [[Erich Honecker]], Bulgaria's [[Todor Zhivkov]], Czechoslovakia's [[Gustáv Husák]] and Romania's [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] obstinately ignored the calls for change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://countrystudies.us/romania/75.htm | contribution = Romania – Soviet Union and Eastern Europe | place = US | publisher = Library of Congress | title = Country studies}}.&lt;/ref&gt; "When your neighbor puts up new wallpaper, it doesn't mean you have to too," declared one East German politburo member.&lt;ref name = "Steele" /&gt;

== Leadup to revolution ==
By the late 1980s, people in the [[Caucasus]] and [[Baltic states]] were demanding more autonomy from [[Moscow]], and the Kremlin was losing some of its control over certain regions and elements in the [[Soviet Union]]. In November 1988, the [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic]] issued a [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declaration of sovereignty]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-11-17/news/mn-458_1_soviet-union|title=Parliament in Estonia Declares 'Sovereignty'|work=latimes}}&lt;/ref&gt; which would eventually lead to other states making similar declarations of autonomy.

The [[Chernobyl disaster]] in April 1986 had major political and social effects that catalyzed or at least partially caused the revolutions of 1989. One political result of the disaster was the greatly increased significance of the new Soviet policy of [[glasnost]].&lt;ref name="ShlyGlasnost"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00139157.1992.9931445 |title=Chernobyl andGlasnost: The Effects of Secrecy on Health and Safety |year=1992 |last1=Shlyakhter |first1=Alexander |last2=Wilson |first2=Richard |journal=Environment: Science and Policy for Sustainable Development |volume=34 |issue=5 |pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PetrynaSarc"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1525/can.1995.10.2.02a00030 |title=Sarcophagus: Chernobyl in Historical Light |year=1995 |last1=Petryna |first1=Adriana |journal=Cultural Anthropology |volume=10 |issue=2 |pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is difficult to establish the total economic cost of the disaster. According to Gorbachev, the Soviet Union spent 18 billion rubles (the equivalent of US$18 billion at that time) on containment and decontamination, virtually bankrupting itself.&lt;ref name="GorbachevBoC"&gt;Gorbachev, Mikhail (1996), interview in Johnson, Thomas, ''{{YouTube|dd-QBnAd5qY|The Battle of Chernobyl}}'', [film], Discovery Channel, retrieved 19 February 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regime changes outside of Eastern Europe ==
{{see also|Third Wave Democracy}}
In February 1986, in one of the first peaceful, mass-movement revolutions against a dictatorship, the [[People Power Revolution]] in the [[Philippines]] peacefully overthrew dictator [[Ferdinand Marcos]] and inaugurated [[Cory Aquino]] as president.

The [[domino effect]] of the revolutions of 1989 affected other regimes as well. The [[South Africa]]n [[apartheid]] regime and [[Pinochet]]'s [[military dictatorship]] in Chile were gradually dismantled during the 1990s as the West withdrew their funding and diplomatic support. [[Argentina]], [[Ghana]], [[Indonesia]], [[Nicaragua]], [[South Korea]], [[Suriname]], [[Republic of China]] (Taiwan), and [[North Yemen|North]] and [[South Yemen]], among many others, elected democratic governments.

Exact tallies of the number of democracies vary depending on the criteria used for assessment, but by some measures by the late 1990s there were well over 100 democracies in the world, a marked increase in just a few decades.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

== Solidarity's impact grows ==
{{main|Solidarity (Polish trade union)}}
[[File:WieczorWroclawia20marca1981.jpg|thumb|20–21 March 1981, issue of ''Wieczór Wrocławia'' (''This Evening in [[Wrocław]]'') shows blank spaces remaining after the government censor pulled articles from page 1 (right, "What happened at [[Bydgoszcz]]?") and from the last page (left, "Country-wide strike alert"), leaving only their titles as the printers—[[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity-trade-union]] members—decided to run the newspaper with blank spaces intact and the bottom of page 1 of this master copy bears the hand-written Solidarity confirmation of that decision]]

Throughout the mid-1980s, [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] persisted solely as an underground organization, supported by the Catholic Church. However, by the late 1980s, Solidarity became sufficiently strong to frustrate [[Wojciech Jaruzelski|Jaruzelski's]] attempts at reform, and [[1988 Polish strikes|nationwide strikes in 1988]] forced the government to open dialogue with Solidarity. On 9 March 1989, both sides agreed to a [[bicameral legislature]] called the [[National Assembly (Poland)|National Assembly]]. The already existing [[Sejm]] would become the lower house. The Senate would be elected by the people. Traditionally a ceremonial office, the presidency was given more powers&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.2facts.com Poland:Major Political Reform Agreed], ''Facts on File World News Digest'', 24 March 1989. Facts on File News Services. 6 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Polish Round Table Agreement]]).

By 1989, the Soviet Union had repealed the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] in favor of non-intervention in the internal affairs of its [[Warsaw Pact]] allies, termed the [[Sinatra Doctrine]] in a joking reference to the [[Frank Sinatra]] song "[[My Way (song)|My Way]]". Poland became the first Warsaw Pact country to break free of Soviet domination.

== National political movements ==
=== China ===
{{main|Tiananmen Square protests of 1989}}
New Chinese leader [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1982–1987) developed the concept of [[socialism with Chinese characteristics]] and local [[Socialist market economy|market economy]] around 1984, but the policy stalled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | date = 3 February 2012 | url = http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90780/7719657.html | title = 'Market fundamentalism' is unpractical | newspaper = People's Daily | publisher = Central Committee of the Communist Party | place = [[China|CN]] | accessdate = 13 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Chinese student demonstrations, which directly preceded the Beijing protests of 1989, took place in December 1986 in [[Hefei]]. The students called for campus elections, the chance to study abroad and greater availability of Western pop culture. Their protests took advantage of the loosening political atmosphere and included rallies against the slow pace of reform. [[Hu Yaobang]], a protégé of Deng Xiaoping and a leading advocate of reform, was blamed for the protests and forced to resign as the CCP general secretary in January 1987. In the "Anti Bourgeois Liberalization Campaign", Hu would be further denounced.

The Tiananmen Square protests were sparked by the death of Hu Yaobang on 15 April 1989. By the eve of Hu's state funeral, some 100,000 students had gathered at [[Tiananmen Square]] to observe it; however, no leaders emerged from the [[Great Hall of the People|Great Hall]]. The movement lasted for seven weeks.&lt;ref name= "Zhao153"&gt;{{Citation | first = Dingxin | last = Zhao | title = The Power of Tiananmen: State-Society Relations and the 1989 Beijing Student Movement | place = Chicago | publisher = University of Chicago Press | year = 2001 | ISBN = 0-226-98260-2 | page = 153}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gorbachev's visit to China on 15 May during the protests brought many foreign news agencies to Beijing, and their sympathetic portrayals of the protesters helped galvanize a spirit of liberation among the Central, South-East and Eastern Europeans who were watching. The Chinese leadership, particularly Communist Party general secretary [[Zhao Ziyang]], having begun earlier than the Soviets to radically reform the economy, was open to political reform, but not at the cost of a potential return to the disorder of the [[Cultural Revolution]].

The movement lasted from Hu's death on 15 April until tanks rolled into Tiananmen Square on 4 June 1989. In Beijing, the military response to the protest by the PRC government left many civilians in charge of clearing the square of the dead and severely injured. The exact number of casualties is not known and many different estimates exist.

On 7 July 1989, President Mikhail Gorbachev implicitly renounced the use of force against other Soviet-bloc nations. Speaking to members of the 23-nation Council of Europe, Mr. Gorbachev made no direct reference to the so-called [[Brezhnev Doctrine]], under which Moscow has asserted the right to use force to prevent a Warsaw Pact member from leaving the Communist fold, but stated 'Any interference in domestic affairs and any attempts to restrict the sovereignty of states—friends, allies or any others—are inadmissible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/07/07/world/gorbachev-spurns-the-use-of-force-in-eastern-europe.html?scp=714&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=8324637C96A56F9E0671EC017DB71D98 | work=The New York Times | first=James M. | last = Markham | title=Gorbachev spurns the use of force in Eastern Europe | date=7 July 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lech Walesa George H Bush.PNG|thumb|Solidarity Chairman [[Lech Wałęsa]] (center) with President [[George H. W. Bush]] (right) and Barbara Bush (left) in Warsaw, July 1989]]
A [[1988 Polish strikes|wave of strikes]] hit Poland in April and May 1988, and a second wave began on 15 August that year when a strike broke out at the [[July Manifesto]] coal mine in [[Jastrzębie-Zdrój]], the workers demanding the re-legalisation of [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]]. Over the next few days, sixteen other mines went on strike followed by a number of shipyards, including on 22 August, the [[Gdansk Shipyard]], famous as the epicentre of the [[History of Solidarity|1980 industrial unrest]] that spawned Solidarity.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 151}} On 31 August 1988 [[Lech Wałęsa]], the leader of Solidarity, was invited to Warsaw by the Communist authorities, who had finally agreed to talks.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 157}} On 18 January 1989 at a stormy session of the Tenth Plenary Session of the ruling [[Polish United Workers' Party|United Workers' Party]], General [[Wojciech Jaruzelski]], the First Secretary, managed to get party backing for formal negotiations with Solidarity leading to its future legalisation, although this was achieved only by threatening the resignation of the entire party leadership if thwarted.{{Sfn | Wałęsa | 1991 | p = 174}} On 6 February 1989 formal Round Table discussions began in the Hall of Columns in Warsaw. On 4 April 1989 the historic [[Polish Round Table Agreement|Round Table Agreement]] was signed legalising Solidarity and setting up partly free [[Polish legislative election, 1989|parliamentary elections]] to be held on 4 June 1989 (incidentally, the day following the midnight crackdown on Chinese protesters in Tiananmen Square). A political earthquake followed. The victory of Solidarity surpassed all predictions. Solidarity candidates captured all the seats they were allowed to compete for in the [[Sejm]], while in the [[Senate of Poland|Senate]] they captured 99 out of the 100 available seats (with the one remaining seat taken by an independent candidate). At the same time, many prominent Communist candidates failed to gain even the minimum number of votes required to capture the seats that were reserved for them.

On 15 August 1989, the Communists' two longtime coalition partners, the [[United People's Party (Poland)|United People's Party]] (ZSL) and the [[Democratic Party (Poland)|Democratic Party]] (SD), broke their alliance with the PZPR and announced their support for Solidarity. The last Communist Prime Minister of Poland, General [[Czesław Kiszczak]], said he would resign to allow a non-Communist to form an administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/15/world/poland-s-premier-offering-to-yield-to-non-communist.html?scp=187&amp;sq=Poland&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=1619ADC23679717BAA7BEEB89D42F7C7 | work=The New York Times | first=John | last=Tagliabue | title=Poland's premier offering to yield to non-Communist | date=15 August 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Solidarity was the only other political grouping that could possibly form a government, it was virtually assured that a Solidarity member would become prime minister. On 19 August 1989, in a stunning watershed moment, [[Tadeusz Mazowiecki]], an anti-Communist editor, Solidarity supporter, and devout Catholic, was nominated as Prime Minister of Poland and the Soviet Union voiced no protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/20/weekinreview/a-new-orbit-poland-s-break-leads-europe-and-communism-to-a-threshold.html?scp=825&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=6C7A9946FB31BA34FCA893628C2ECB2B | work= The New York Times | first=R.

Following Poland's lead, Hungary was next to switch to a non-Communist government. Although Hungary had achieved some lasting economic reforms and limited political liberalization during the 1980s, major reforms only occurred following the replacement of [[János Kádár]] as General Secretary of the Communist Party on 23 May 1988 with [[Károly Grósz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/05/23/world/hungarian-party-replaces-kadar-with-his-premier.html?scp=135&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=E283E53C9144CEB5DC839A7740A35E80 | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Hungarian Party replace Kadar with his premier | date= 23 May 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November 1988 [[Miklós Németh]] was appointed Prime Minister.

Mass demonstrations on 15 March, the National Day, persuaded the regime to begin negotiations with the emergent non-Communist political forces. [[Hungarian Round Table Talks|Round Table talks]] began on 22 April and continued until the Round Table agreement was signed on 18 September. The talks involved the Communists (MSzMP) and the newly emerging independent political forces [[Fidesz – Hungarian Civic Union|Fidesz]], the [[Alliance of Free Democrats]] (SzDSz), the [[Hungarian Democratic Forum]] (MDF), the [[Independent Smallholders, Agrarian Workers and Civic Party|Independent Smallholders' Party]], the [[National Peasant Party (Hungary)|Hungarian People's Party]], the Endre Bajcsy-Zsilinszky Society, and the Democratic Trade Union of Scientific Workers. At a later stage the [[Democratic Confederation of Free Trade Unions]] and the [[Christian Democratic People's Party (Hungary)|Christian Democratic People's Party]] (KDNP) were invited.{{Sfn | Falk | 2003 | p = 147}} It was at the talks that a number of Hungary's future political leaders emerged, including [[László Sólyom]], [[József Antall]], [[György Szabad]], [[Péter Tölgyessy]] and [[Viktor Orbán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = József | last = Bayer | contribution-url =  http://www.europainstitut.hu/pdf/bayer22.pdf | contribution = The Process of Political System Change in Hungary | title = Schriftenreihe | publisher = Europa Institutes | place = Budapest, [[Hungary|HU]] | year = 2003 | page = 180}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 1989, the first visible cracks in the [[Iron Curtain]] appeared when [[People's Republic of Hungary|Hungary]] began [[Removal of Hungary's border fence with Austria|dismantling its {{convert |240|km| adj =on}} long border fence with Austria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Stokes | first = G | title = The Walls Came Tumbling Down | page = 131 | publisher = [[Oxford University Press]] | year = 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This increasingly destabilized the [[East Germany|GDR]] and [[Czechoslovakia]] over the summer and autumn as thousands of their citizens illegally crossed over to the West through the Hungarian-Austrian border. On 1 June 1989 the Communist Party admitted that former Prime Minister [[Imre Nagy]], hanged for treason for his role in the 1956 Hungarian uprising, was executed illegally after a show trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/01/world/hungarian-party-assails-nagy-s-execution.html?scp=654&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=AB4FDDAFE5F0111C9B81EEA7B377A93F | work=The New York Times | title = Hungarian Party Assails Nagy's Execution | date=1 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 June 1989 Nagy was given a solemn funeral on Budapest's largest square in front of crowds of at least 100,000, followed by a hero's burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/06/17/world/hungarian-who-led-56-revolt-is-buried-as-a-hero.html?scp=678&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=1CA5680B13F144C9AD6C2CA30484B16C | work=The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Hungarian Who Led '56 Revolt Is Buried as a Hero | date=17 June 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Round Table agreement of 18 September encompassed six draft laws that covered an overhaul of the [[Constitution of Hungary|Constitution]], establishment of a [[Constitutional Court of Hungary|Constitutional Court]], the functioning and management of political parties, multiparty elections for National Assembly deputies, the penal code and the law on penal procedures (the last two changes represented an additional separation of the Party from the state apparatus).{{Sfn | Heenan | Lamontagne | 1999 | p = 13}}{{Sfn | De Nevers | 2003 | p = 130}} The electoral system was a compromise: about half of the deputies would be elected proportionally and half by the majoritarian system.{{Sfn | Elster | Offe | Preuss | 1998 | p = 66}} A weak presidency was also agreed upon, but no consensus was attained on who should elect the president (parliament or the people) and when this election should occur (before or after parliamentary elections). On 7 October 1989, the Communist Party at its last congress re-established itself as the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/08/world/communist-party-in-hungary-votes-for-radical-shift.html?scp=28&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=8A34A86DC90090167E32320BB95CB02F | work = The New York Times | first=Henry | last=Kamm | title=Communist party in Hungary votes for radical shift | date=8 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election, which took place on [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 1990|March 24, 1990]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/19/world/hungary-purges-stalinism-from-its-constitution.html?scp=61&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=142906DE0FC1FFA303D77A84282021BB | work = The New York Times | title = Hungary Purges Stalinism From Its Constitution | date= 19 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation transformed Hungary from a [[People's Republic]] into the [[Republic of Hungary]], guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url = https://www.nytimes.com/1989/10/20/world/hungary-legalizes-opposition-groups.html?scp=68&amp;sq=Hungary&amp;st=nyt&amp;gwh=57F88FEB3671803C0BA623ABE2583F4C | work=The New York Times | title=Hungary legalizes opposition groups | date= 20 October 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 23 October 1989, on the 33rd anniversary of the 1956 Revolution, the Communist regime in Hungary was formally abolished.  The [[Soviet occupation of Hungary|Soviet military occupation of Hungary]], which had persisted since World War II, ended on 19 June 1991.

=== East Germany ===
{{main|Die Wende|German reunification|Peaceful Revolution}}
[[File:BerlinWall-BrandenburgGate.jpg|thumb|[[Berlin Wall]] at the [[Brandenburg Gate]], 10 November 1989]]
On 2 May 1989, Hungary started dismantling its barbed-wire border with [[Austria]], opening a large hole through the Iron Curtain to the West that was used by a growing number of East Germans. By the end of September 1989, more than 30,000 East Germans had escaped to the West before the GDR denied travel to Hungary, leaving the CSSR ([[Czechoslovakia]]) as the only neighboring state where East Germans could escape to. Thousands of East Germans tried to reach the West by occupying the West German diplomatic facilities in other Central and Eastern European capitals, notably the [[Prague Embassy]] and the Hungarian Embassy where thousands camped in the muddy garden from August to November waiting for German political reform. The GDR closed the border to the CSSR on 3 October, thereby isolating itself from all neighbors. Having been shut off from their last chance for escape, an increasing number of East Germans participated in the [[Monday demonstrations in East Germany|Monday demonstrations]] in Leipzig on 4, 11, and 18 September, each attracting 1,200 to 1,500 demonstrators; many were arrested and beaten. However, the people refused to be intimidated. On 25 September, the protests attracted 8,000 demonstrators.

After the fifth successive Monday demonstration in Leipzig on 2 October attracted 10,000 protesters, [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) leader [[Erich Honecker]] issued a ''shoot and kill'' order to the military.&lt;ref name = "Pritchard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reconstructing education: East German schools and universities after unification| first = Rosalind MO | last = Pritchard|page =10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Communists prepared a huge police, militia, [[Stasi]], and work-combat troop presence and there were rumors a Tiananmen Square-style massacre was being planned for the following Monday's demonstration on 9 October.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Germany, 1918–2000: the divided nation| first =Mary | last = Fulbrook|page = 256}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 and 7 October, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] visited East Germany to mark the 40th anniversary of the German Democratic Republic, and urged the East German leadership to accept reform. A famous quote of his is rendered in German as "Wer zu spät kommt, den bestraft das Leben" ("He who is too late is punished by life"). However, Honecker remained opposed to internal reform, with his regime even going so far as forbidding the circulation of Soviet publications that it viewed as subversive.

In spite of rumors that the Communists were planning a massacre on 9 October, 70,000 citizens demonstrated in Leipzig that Monday, and the authorities on the ground refused to open fire. This victory of the people facing down the Communists' guns encouraged more citizens to take to the streets. The following Monday, 16 October, 120,000 people demonstrated on the streets of Leipzig.

[[Erich Honecker]] had hoped that the [[Group of Soviet Forces in Germany|Soviet troops]] stationed in the [[East Germany|GDR]], as by the [[Warsaw Pact]], would restore the communist government and suppress the civilian protests. By 1989 the [[Government of the Soviet Union|Soviet government]] deemed it impractical for the Soviet Union to [[Sinatra Doctrine|continue asserting its control]] over the [[Eastern Bloc]], and so it took a neutral stance regarding the events happening in East Germany. Soviet troops stationed in eastern Europe were under strict instructions from the Soviet leadership not to intervene in the political affairs of the Eastern Bloc nations and had to remain in their barracks. Faced with ongoing civil unrest, the SED deposed Honecker on 18 October and replaced him with the number-two-man in the regime, [[Egon Krenz]]. However, the demonstrations kept growing and on Monday 23 October the Leipzig protesters numbered 300,000 and remained as large the following week. The border to Czechoslovakia was opened again on 1 November, but the Czechoslovak authorities soon let all East Germans travel directly to West Germany without further bureaucratic ado, thus lifting their part of the Iron Curtain on 3 November. On 4 November the authorities decided to authorize a demonstration in Berlin and were faced with the [[Alexanderplatz demonstration]] where half a million citizens converged on the capital demanding freedom in the biggest protest the GDR ever witnessed. Unable to stem the ensuing flow of refugees to the West through Czechoslovakia, the East German authorities eventually caved in to public pressure by allowing East German citizens to enter West Berlin and West Germany directly, via existing border points, on 9 November 1989, without having properly briefed the border guards. Triggered by the erratic words of regime spokesman [[Günter Schabowski]] in a TV press conference, stating that the planned changes were in effect "immediately, without delay," hundreds of thousands of people took advantage of the opportunity. The guards were quickly overwhelmed by the growing crowds of people demanding to be let out into West Berlin. After receiving no feedback from their superiors, the guards, unwilling to use force, relented and opened the gates to West Berlin. Soon new crossing points were forced open in the [[Berlin Wall]] by the people, and sections of the wall were literally torn down as this symbol of oppression was overwhelmed. The bewildered guards were unaware of what was happening and meekly stood by as the East Germans took to the wall with hammers and chisels.

On 13 November, GDR Prime Minister [[Willi Stoph]] and his entire cabinet resigned. A new government was formed under a considerably more liberal Communist, [[Hans Modrow]]. On 1 December, the [[Volkskammer]] removed the SED's leading role from the constitution of the GDR. On 3 December Krenz resigned as leader of the SED; he resigned as head of state three days later. On 7 December Round Table talks opened between the SED and other political parties. On 16 December 1989, the SED was dissolved and refounded as the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|SED-PDS]], abandoning Marxism-Leninism and becoming a mainstream democratic socialist party.

On 15 January 1990, the Stasi's headquarters was stormed by protesters. Modrow became the de facto leader of East Germany until free elections were held on 18 March 1990—the first held in that part of Germany since 1933. The SED, renamed the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]], was heavily defeated. [[Lothar de Maizière]] of the East German Christian Democratic Union became Prime Minister on 4 April 1990 on a platform of speedy [[German reunification|reunification]] with the West. The two Germanies were reunified on 3 October 1990.

The Kremlin's willingness to abandon such a strategically vital ally marked a dramatic shift by the Soviet superpower and a fundamental paradigm change in international relations, which until 1989 had been dominated by the East-West divide running through Berlin itself. The last Russian troops left the territory of the former GDR, now part of a reunited [[Germany|Federal Republic of Germany]], on 1 September 1994.

=== Czechoslovakia ===
{{main|Velvet Revolution}}
[[File:Prague November89 - Wenceslas Monument.jpg|thumb|Protests beneath the monument in [[Prague]]'s [[Wenceslas Square]]]]
[[File:Bratislava Slovakia 213.JPG|thumb|upright=0.75|Memorial of the [[Velvet Revolution]] in [[Bratislava]] ([[SNP Square (Bratislava)|Námestie SNP]]), [[Slovakia]]]]
The "Velvet Revolution" was a non-violent revolution in Czechoslovakia that saw the overthrow of the Communist government. On 17 November 1989 (Friday), riot police suppressed a peaceful student demonstration in Prague, although controversy continues over whether anyone died that night. That event sparked a series of popular demonstrations from 19 November to late December. By 20 November the number of peaceful protesters assembled in Prague had swelled from 200,000 the previous day to an estimated half-million. Five days later, the Letná Square protest held 800,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.denik.cz/z_domova/demonstrace-na-letne-pred-25-lety-urychlily-kapitulaci-komunistu-20141123.html | title = Demonstrace na letne pred 25 lety urychlily kapitulaci komunistu | language = cs| place = [[Czhec|CZ]] | newspaper = Denik}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 24 November, the entire Communist Party leadership, including general secretary [[Miloš Jakeš]], resigned. A two-hour general strike, involving all citizens of Czechoslovakia, was successfully held on 27 November.

With the collapse of other Communist governments, and increasing street protests, the Communist Party of Czechoslovakia announced on 28 November 1989 that it would relinquish power and dismantle the single-party state. Barbed wire and other obstructions were removed from the border with West Germany and Austria in early December. On 10 December, President [[Gustáv Husák]] appointed the first largely non-Communist government in Czechoslovakia since 1948, and resigned. [[Alexander Dubček]] was elected speaker of the federal parliament on 28 December and [[Václav Havel]] the President of Czechoslovakia on 29 December 1989. In June 1990 Czechoslovakia held its first democratic elections since 1946. On 27 June 1991 the last Soviet troops were withdrawn from Czechoslovakia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=20 Years After Soviet Soldiers Left the Czech Republic, Russians Move In|url = https://blogs.wsj.com/emergingeurope/2011/06/28/soviet-soldiers-left-czechoslovakia-20-years-ago-ordinary-well-off-russians-to-move-in/ | newspaper= The Wall Street Journal|date=28 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
In October and November 1989, demonstrations on ecological issues were staged in Sofia, where demands for political reform were also voiced. The demonstrations were suppressed, but on 10 November 1989 (the day after the Berlin Wall was breached) Bulgaria's long-serving leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted by his Politburo. He was succeeded by a considerably more liberal Communist, former foreign minister [[Petar Mladenov]]. Moscow apparently approved the leadership change, as Zhivkov had been opposed to Gorbachev's policies. The new regime immediately repealed restrictions on free speech and assembly, which led to the first mass demonstration on 17 November, as well as the formation of anti-communist movements. Nine of them united as the [[Union of Democratic Forces (Bulgaria)|Union of Democratic Forces]] (UDF) on 7 December.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.sds.bg/about/history | title = History of the UDF | language = bg | publisher = SDS | place = [[Bulgaria|BG]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDF was not satisfied with Zhivkov's ouster, and demanded additional democratic reforms, most importantly the removal of the constitutionally mandated leading role of the [[Bulgarian Communist Party]].

Mladenov announced on 11 December 1989 that the Communist Party would abandon its monopoly on power, and that multiparty elections would be held the following year. In February 1990, the Bulgarian legislature deleted the portion of the constitution about the "leading role" of the Communist Party. Eventually, it was decided that a round table on the Polish model would be held in 1990 and elections held by June 1990. The round table took place from 3 January to 14 May 1990, at which an agreement was reached on the transition to democracy. The Communist Party abandoned Marxism–Leninism in April 1990 and renamed itself as the [[Bulgarian Socialist Party]]. In June 1990 the first free elections since 1931 were held, won by the Bulgarian Socialist Party.

=== Romania ===
{{main|Romanian Revolution}}
After having suppressed the [[Braşov Rebellion]] in 1987, [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]] was re-elected for another five years as leader of the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR) in November 1989, signalling that he intended to ride out the anti-Communist uprisings sweeping the rest of Europe. As Ceauşescu prepared to go on a state visit to Iran, his [[Securitate]] ordered the arrest and exile of a local Hungarian [[Calvinism|Calvinist]] minister, [[László Tőkés]], on 16 December, for sermons offending the regime. Tőkés was seized, but only after serious rioting erupted. [[Timişoara]] was the first city to react on 16 December and civil unrest continued for five days.

Returning from Iran, Ceauşescu ordered a mass rally in his support outside Communist Party headquarters in Bucharest on 21 December. However, to his shock the crowd booed and jeered him as he spoke. Years of repressed dissatisfaction boiled to the surface throughout the Romanian populace and even among elements in Ceauşescu's own government, and the demonstrations spread throughout the country.

At first the security forces obeyed Ceauşescu's orders to shoot protesters. However, on the morning of 22 December, the Romanian military suddenly changed sides. This came after it was announced that defense minister [[Vasile Milea]] had committed suicide after being unmasked as a traitor. Believing Milea had actually been murdered, the rank-and-file soldiers went over virtually ''en masse'' to the revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cornel|first=Ban|title=Sovereign Debt, Austerity, and Regime Change: The Case of Nicolae Ceausescu’s Romania|date=November 2012|publisher=East European Politics &amp; Societies|page=34|url=http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160518013101/http://0-web.a.ebscohost.com.libraries.colorado.edu/ehost/detail/detail?sid=b54ec8d0-8831-43ba-93d1-3f55b98fb916%40sessionmgr4002&amp;vid=0&amp;hid=4112&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZQ%3d%3d#db=aph&amp;AN=83866105|dead-url=yes|accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Army tanks began moving towards the Central Committee building with crowds swarming alongside them. The rioters forced open the doors of the Central Committee building in an attempt to capture Ceauşescu and his wife, [[Elena Ceauşescu|Elena]], coming within a few meters of the couple. However, they managed to escape via a helicopter waiting for them on the roof of the building. The revolution resulted in 1,104 deaths. Unlike its kindred parties in the Warsaw Pact, the PCR simply melted away; no present-day Romanian party claiming to be its successor has ever been elected to the legislature since the change of system.

Although elation followed the flight of the Ceauşescus, uncertainty surrounded their fate. On Christmas Day, Romanian television showed the Ceauşescus facing a hasty trial, and then undergoing [[summary execution]]. An interim [[National Salvation Front (Romania)|National Salvation Front]] Council led by [[Ion Iliescu]] took over and announced elections for April 1990, the first free elections held in Romania since 1937. However, they were postponed until 20 May 1990. Over 1,000 people died during the Romanian Revolution, out of which 100 where children and the youngest was only one month. The Romanian dictator, Nicolae Ceauşescu, and his wife, Elena Ceauşescu, were executed by firing squad after a very brief trial. The Romanian Revolution was the bloodiest of the revolutions of 1989.

=== Mongolia ===
{{main|Mongolian Revolution of 1990}}
Mongolia declared independence in 1911 after the collapse of the [[Qing dynasty]]. The [[Mongolian People's Party]] [[Outer Mongolian Revolution of 1921|took power]] in 1921 and the party renamed itself the Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Constitutions of the Communist World|editor-first=William B.|editor-last=Simons|publisher=BRILL|year=1980|ISBN=9028600701|pages=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the years, Mongolia was closely aligned with the Soviet Union. After [[Yumjaagiin Tsedenbal]] left in 1984, the new leadership under [[Jambyn Batmönkh]] implemented economic reforms, but failed to appeal to those who, in late 1989, wanted broader changes,&lt;ref name="Kaplonski" /&gt; which led to the "Mongolian Revolution", a democratic [[Nonviolent revolution|peaceful]] revolution that started with demonstrations and [[hunger strike]]s that ended 70-years of [[socialism]] and eventually moved towards democracy. It was spearheaded by mostly younger people demonstrating on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] in the capital [[Ulaanbaatar]]. It ended with the [[authoritarian]] government resigning without bloodshed. Some of the main organizers were [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], [[Sanjaasürengiin Zorig]], [[Erdeniin Bat-Üül]], and [[Bat-Erdeniin Batbayar]].

During the period of the morning of 10 December 1989, the first public demonstration occurred in front of the Youth Cultural Center in the capital of Ulaanbaatar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=G.|first=Dari|title=

The protesters called for Mongolia to adopt [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]]. Dissident leaders demanded free elections and economic reform, but within the context of a "human democratic socialism".&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"/&gt; The protesters injected a nationalist element into the protests by using traditional [[Mongolian script]]&amp;mdash;which most Mongolians could not read&amp;mdash;as a symbolic repudiation of the political system which had imposed the [[Mongolian Cyrillic alphabet]]. In late December 1989, demonstrations increased when news came of [[Garry Kasparov]]'s interview to ''[[Playboy]]'', suggesting that the Soviet Union could improve its economic health by selling Mongolia to China.&lt;ref name="Kaplonski"&gt;{{cite book|title=Truth, History, and Politics in Mongolia: The Memory of Heroes|first=Christopher|last=Kaplonski|year=2004|publisher=Psychology Press|pages=51, 56, 60, 64–65, 67, 80–82|ISBN=1134396732}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 January 1990, the protesters, having grown from three hundred to some 1,000, met on square in front of Lenin Museum which was named as Freedom Square since then in [[Ulaanbaatar]]. A demonstration on [[Sükhbaatar Square]] on 21 January (in weather of -30&amp;nbsp;C) followed. Protesters carried banners alluding to Chinggis Khaan (also referred to [[Genghis Khan]]), rehabilitating a figure which Soviet schooling neglected to praise.&lt;ref name="Fineman"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-01-24/news/mn-609_1_rock-music/2|title=Mongolia Reform Group Marches to Rock Anthem|first=Mark|last=Fineman|date=1990-01-24|accessdate=2012-12-26|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|quote=Mongolia-watchers in Beijing said that... the democracy movement is rooted more in nationalism than in dissent....

In November 1991, the People's Great Hural began discussion on a new constitution, which entered into force on 12 February 1992. In addition, the new constitution restructured the legislative branch of government, creating a unicameral legislature, the State Great Hural (SGH). The MPRP retained its majority, but lost the 1996 elections. The final Russian troops, which had stationed in Mongolia in 1966, fully withdrew in December 1992.

=== Yugoslavia ===
{{main|Breakup of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav Wars}}
The [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]] was not a part of the Warsaw Pact but pursued [[Titoism|its own version of "Communism"]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]]. It was a multi-ethnic state which Tito was able to maintain through a doctrine of "[[Brotherhood and unity]]", but tensions between ethnicities began to escalate with the so-called [[Croatian Spring]] of 1970–71, a movement for greater [[Socialist Republic of Croatia|Croatia]]n autonomy, which was suppressed. In 1974 there followed constitutional changes, and the [[1974 Yugoslav Constitution]] devolved some of the federal powers to the constituent republics and provinces. After Tito's death in 1980 ethnic tensions grew, first in Albanian-majority [[Socialist Autonomous Province of Kosovo|SAP Kosovo]] with the [[1981 protests in Kosovo]]. In the late 1980s [[Socialist Republic of Serbia|Serbia]]n leader [[Slobodan Milošević]] used the Kosovo crisis to stoke up Serb nationalism and attempt to consolidate and dominate the country, which alienated the other ethnic groups.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

Parallel to the same process, [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia|SR Slovenia]] witnessed a policy of gradual liberalization since 1984, somewhat similar to the Soviet Perestroika. This provoked tensions between the [[League of Communists of Slovenia]] on one side, and the central Yugoslav Party and the [[Yugoslav People's Army|federal army]] on the other side. By the late 1980s, many civil society groups were pushing towards democratization, while widening the space for cultural plurality. In 1987 and 1988, a series of clashes between the emerging civil society and the Communist regime culminated with the so-called [[Slovene Spring]], a mass movement for democratic reforms. The [[Committee for the Defence of Human Rights]] was established as the platform of all major non-Communist political movements. By early 1989, several anti-Communist political parties were already openly functioning, challenging the hegemony of the Slovenian Communists. Soon, the Slovenian Communists, pressured by their own civil society, came into conflict with the Serbian Communist leadership.{{Citation needed |date=August 2015}}

In January 1990, an extraordinary Congress of the [[League of Communists of Yugoslavia]] was called in order to settle the disputes among its constituent parties. Faced with being completely outnumbered, the Slovenian and Croatian Communists walked out of the Congress on 23 January 1990, thus effectively bringing to an end the Yugoslav Communist Party. Both parties of the two western republics negotiated free multi-party elections with their own opposition movements.

On 8 April 1990, the democratic and anti-Yugoslav [[DEMOS coalition]] won the [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 1990|elections in Slovenia]], while on 24 April 1990 the [[Croatian parliamentary election, 1990|Croatian elections]] witnessed the landslide victory of the nationalist [[Croatian Democratic Union]] (HDZ) led by [[Franjo Tuđman]]. The results were much more balanced in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina parliamentary election, 1990|Bosnia and Herzegovina]] and [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 1990|Macedonia]] in November 1990, while the [[Serbian parliamentary election, 1990|parliamentary]] and [[Serbian presidential election, 1990|presidential]] elections of December 1990 in Serbia and [[Montenegrin parliamentary election, 1990|Montenegro]] consolidated the power of Milošević and his supporters. Free elections on the level of the federation were never carried out.

The Slovenian and Croatian leaderships started preparing plans for secession from the federation, while the [[Serbs of Croatia]] organized the so-called [[Log Revolution]], an insurrection that would lead to the creation of the breakaway region of [[SAO Krajina]]. In the [[Slovenian independence referendum, 1990|Slovenian independence referendum]] on 23 December 1990, 88.5% of residents voted for independence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |publisher=Sussex |place=UK |format=PDF |title=Slovenian Referendum Briefing No. 3 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218000730/http://www.sussex.ac.uk/sei/documents/slovenian3.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Croatian independence referendum, 1991|Croatian independence referendum]] on 2 May 1991, 93.24% voted for independence.

The escalating ethnic and national tensions were exacerbated by the drive for independence and led to the following [[Yugoslav wars]]:
* [[Ten-Day War|War in Slovenia]] (1991)
* [[Croatian War of Independence]] (1991–1995)
* [[Bosnian War]] (1992–1995)
* [[Kosovo War]] (1998–1999), including the [[NATO bombing of Yugoslavia]].

In addition, the [[insurgency in the Preševo Valley]] (1999–2001) and the [[insurgency in the Republic of Macedonia]] (2001) are also often discussed in the same context.{{Sfn | Judah |  2011}}{{Sfn | Naimark | Case | 2003 | p = xvii}}{{Sfn | Rogel | 2004 | pp = 91–92}}

=== Albania ===
{{main|Fall of Communism in Albania}} &lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[File:Fall of Communism in Albania.JPG|thumb|left|The fall of Enver Hoxha's Statue in central Tirana on 11 December 1990]] --&gt;
In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], [[Enver Hoxha]], who led Albania for four decades, died on 11 April 1985. His successor, [[Ramiz Alia]], began to gradually open up the regime from above. In 1989, the first revolts started in [[Shkodra]] and spread in other cities. Eventually, the existing regime introduced some liberalization, including measures in 1990 providing for freedom to travel abroad. Efforts were begun to improve ties with the outside world. March 1991 elections—the first free elections in Albania since 1923, and only the third free elections in the country's history—left the former Communists in power, but a general strike and urban opposition led to the formation of a coalition cabinet including non-Communists. Albania's former Communists were routed in elections held in March 1992, amid economic collapse and social unrest.

== Malta Summit ==
[[File:Bush and Gorbachev at the Malta summit in 1989.gif|thumb|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and President [[George H. W. Bush]] on board the Soviet cruise ship ''Maxim Gorky'', [[Marsaxlokk Harbour]]]]
The [[Malta Summit]] consisted of a meeting between U.S. President George H. W. Bush and U.S.S.R. leader Mikhail Gorbachev, taking place between 2–3 December 1989, just a few weeks after the fall of the Berlin Wall, a meeting which contributed to the end of the [[Cold War]]{{citation needed| date=December 2010}} partially as a result of the broader pro-democracy movement. It was their second meeting following a meeting that included then President Ronald Reagan, in New York in December 1988. News reports of the time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title=1989: Malta Summit Ends Cold War|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/december/3/newsid_4119000/4119950.stm|accessdate=23 February 2015| publisher =BBC | work = News|date=3 December 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; referred to the Malta Summit as the most important since 1945, when British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, Soviet premier Joseph Stalin and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt agreed on a post-war plan for Europe at the [[Yalta Conference]].

== Election chronology in Central/Eastern Europe and Central Asia ==
Between June 1989 and April 1991, every Communist or former Communist Central and Eastern European or Asian country—and in the case of the USSR and Yugoslavia every constituent republic—held competitive parliamentary elections for the first time in many decades.

== Dissolution of the Soviet Union ==
{{Eastern Bloc sidebar}}
{{main|Dissolution of the Soviet Union}}
[[File:Image0 ST.jpg|thumb|Tanks in Moscow's [[Red Square]] during the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|1991 coup attempt]]]]
On 1 July 1991, the Warsaw Pact was officially dissolved at a meeting in Prague. At a summit later that same month, Gorbachev and Bush declared a US–Soviet strategic partnership, decisively marking the end of the Cold War. President Bush declared that US–Soviet cooperation during the 1990–1991 [[Gulf War]] had laid the groundwork for a partnership in resolving bilateral and world problems.

As the Soviet Union rapidly withdrew its forces from Central and Southeast Europe, the spillover from the 1989 upheavals began reverberating throughout the Soviet Union itself. Agitation for self-determination led to first Lithuania, and then Estonia, Latvia and Armenia declaring independence. However, the Soviet central government demanded the revocation of the declarations and threatened military action and economic sanctions. The government even went as far as controversially sending [[Red Army]] troops to the streets of the Lithuanian capital, [[Vilnius]], to [[January Events (Lithuania)|suppress the separatist movements]] in January 1991, causing the deaths of 14 people.

Disaffection in other Soviet republics, such as Georgia and Azerbaijan, was countered by promises of greater decentralization. More open elections led to the election of candidates opposed to Communist Party rule.

''Glasnost'' had inadvertently released the long-suppressed national sentiments of all peoples within the borders of the multinational Soviet state. These nationalist movements were further strengthened by the rapid deterioration of the Soviet economy, whose ramshackle foundations were exposed with the removal of Communist discipline. Gorbachev's reforms had failed to improve the economy, with the old Soviet [[planned economy|command structure]] completely breaking down. One by one, the constituent republics created their own economic systems and voted to subordinate Soviet laws to local laws. In 1990, the Communist Party was forced to surrender its seven-decade monopoly of political power when the Supreme Soviet rescinded the clause in the Soviet Constitution that guaranteed its sole authority to rule. Gorbachev's policies caused the Communist Party to lose its grip over the media. Details of the Soviet Union's past were quickly being declassified. This caused many to distrust the 'old system' and push for greater autonomy and independence.

After a referendum confirmed the preservation of the Soviet Union but in a looser form, a group of Soviet hard-liners represented by Vice-President [[Gennadi Yanayev]] launched [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|a coup attempting to overthrow Gorbachev]] in August 1991. [[Boris Yeltsin]], then president of the [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Russian SFSR]], rallied the people and much of the army against the coup and the effort collapsed. Although restored to power, Gorbachev's authority had been irreparably undermined. Gorbachev resigned as General Secretary of the Communist Party following the coup, and the Supreme Soviet dissolved the Party and banned all Communist activity on Soviet soil. Just a few weeks later, the government granted the Baltic states their independence on 6 September.

Over the next three months, one republic after another declared independence, mostly out of fear of another coup. Also during this time, the Soviet government was rendered useless as the new Russian government began taking over what remained of it, including the Kremlin. The penultimate step came on 1 December, when voters in the second most powerful republic, Ukraine, overwhelmingly voted to secede from the Soviet Union in a referendum. This ended any realistic chance of keeping the Soviet Union together. On 8 December, Yeltsin met with his counterparts from Ukraine and Belarus and signed the [[Belavezha Accords]], declaring that the Soviet Union had ceased to exist. Gorbachev denounced this as illegal, but he had long since lost any ability to influence events outside of Moscow.

Two weeks later, 11 of the remaining 12 republics—all except Georgia—signed the [[Alma-Ata Protocol]], which confirmed the Soviet Union had been effectively dissolved and replaced by a new voluntary association, the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]]. Bowing to the inevitable, Gorbachev resigned as Soviet president on 25 December, and the Supreme Soviet ratified the Belavezha Accords the next day, legally dissolving itself and the Soviet Union as a political entity. By the end of 1991, the few Soviet institutions that hadn't been taken over by Russia had dissolved. The Soviet Union was officially disbanded, breaking up into fifteen constituent parts, thereby ending the world's largest and most influential Socialist state, and leaving to China that position. A [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|constitutional crisis]] dissolved into violence in Moscow as the [[Russian Army]] was called in to reestablish order.

=== Baltic states ===
{{main|Singing Revolution}}
[[File:1989 08 23 Baltijoskelias14.jpg|thumb|[[Baltic Way]] was a [[human chain]] of approximately two million people dedicated to liberating the [[Baltic Republics]] from the [[Soviet Union]].]]
Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania implemented democratic reforms and achieved independence from the Soviet Union.

The Singing Revolution is a commonly used name for events between 1987 and 1991 that led to the restoration of the independence of [[Estonian Soviet Socialist Republic|Estonia]], [[Latvian Soviet Socialist Republic|Latvia]] and [[Lithuanian Soviet Socialist Republic|Lithuania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last=Thomson | first=Clare | title=The Singing Revolution: A Political Journey through the Baltic States | location= London  | publisher= Joseph | year= 1992 | isbn= 0-7181-3459-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Ginkel | first=John |date=September 2002 | title=Identity Construction in Latvia's "Singing Revolution": Why inter-ethnic conflict failed to occur | journal=Nationalities Papers | volume=30| issue=3| pages=403–33 | doi = 10.1080/0090599022000011697}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was coined by an Estonian activist and artist, [[Heinz Valk]], in an article published a week after the 10–11 June 1988 spontaneous mass night-singing demonstrations at the [[Tallinn Song Festival Grounds]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nI73PdnqQlcC&amp;pg | title = Between Utopia and Disillusionment | first = Henri | last = Vogt | p = 26 | ISBN = 1-57181-895-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Estonia [[Estonian Sovereignty Declaration|declared its sovereignty]] from the Soviet Union on 16 November 1988. Lithuania followed on 18 May 1989 and Latvia on 28 July 1989. [[Act of the Re-Establishment of the State of Lithuania|Lithuania declared full independence]] on 11 March 1990 and on 30 March, Estonia announced the start of a transitional period to independence, [[On the Restoration of Independence of the Republic of Latvia|followed by Latvia]] on 4 May. These declarations were met with force from the Soviet Union in early 1991, in confrontations known as the [[January Events (Lithuania)|"January Events" in Lithuania]] and "[[The Barricades]]" in Latvia. The Baltic states contended that their incorporation into the Soviet Union had been illegal under both international law and their own law, and they were reasserting an independence that still legally existed.

Soon after the launching of the August coup, Estonia and Latvia declared full independence. By the time the coup was foiled, the USSR was no longer unified enough to mount a forceful resistance, and it recognized the independence of the Baltic states on 6 September.

=== Belarus, Ukraine and Moldova ===
* {{flag|Belarus|1991}} declared full independence from the USSR on August 25, 1991. The main political changes of the early 1990s were driven by the [[Belarusian Popular Front]] and its fraction in the [[Supreme Soviet of Belarus]]. A few years later, a new postcommunist leader, [[Alexander Lukashenko]], has obtained power. After a short period he increased his power as a result of two controversial referenda (1995–96) and has been criticized for [[Human rights in Belarus|repressing political opposition]] ever since.
* {{flag|Moldova}} participated in the [[War of Transnistria]] between Moldova and Russian-connected forces. Communists came back to power in a 2001 election under [[Vladimir Voronin]], but faced [[2009 Moldova civil unrest|civil unrest]] in 2009 over accusations of rigged elections.
* {{flag|Ukraine}} [[Declaration of Independence of Ukraine|declared its independence]] in August 1991. Presidencies of former Communists [[Leonid Kravchuk]] and [[Leonid Kuchma]] were followed by the [[Orange Revolution]] in 2004, in which Ukrainians elected [[Viktor Yushchenko]] (also former member of [[CPSU]]).

=== Transcaucasia ===
[[File:April9victims.jpg|thumb|Photos of 9 April 1989 victims of the [[Tbilisi massacre]] on a billboard in [[Tbilisi]]]]
* {{flag|Georgia|1990}} and the [[North Caucasus]] have been marred by ethnic and sectarian violence since the collapse of the USSR. In April 1989 the [[Soviet Army]] [[April 9 tragedy|massacred]] demonstrators in [[Tbilisi]]. By November 1989, the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Georgian SSR]] officially condemned the Russian invasion in 1921. Democracy activist [[Zviad Gamsakhurdia]] served as president from 1991 to 1992. Russia aided break-away republics in wars in [[1991-1992 South Ossetia War|South Ossetia]] and [[War in Abkhazia (1992-1993)|Abkhazia]] during the early 1990s, conflicts that have periodically reemerged, and Russia has accused Georgia of supporting Chechen rebels during the [[First Chechen War|Chechen wars]]. A coup d'état installed former Communist leader [[Eduard Shevardnadze]] as President of Georgia until the [[Rose Revolution]] in 2003.
* {{flag|Armenia}}'s independence struggle included violence as the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan. Armenia became increasingly militarized (with the ascendancy of Kocharian, a former president of Nagorno-Karabakh, often viewed as a milestone), while elections have since been increasingly controversial, and government corruption became more rife. After Kocharyan, notably, [[Serzh Sargsyan]] ascended to power. Sargsyan is often noted as the "founder of the Armenian and Karabakh militaries" and was, in the past, defense minister and national security minister.
* {{flag|Azerbaijan}}'s [[Azerbaijani Popular Front Party|Popular Front Party]] won first elections with the self-described pro-Western, populist nationalist Elchibey. However, Elchibey planned to end Moscow's advantage in the harvesting of Azeri oil and build much stronger links with Turkey and Europe, and as a result was overthrown by former Communists in a coup backed by Russia and Iran (which viewed the new country as a compelling threat, with territorial ambitions within Iranian borders and also being a strong economic rival).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Curtis|first1=Glenn E.|title=Azerbaijan: A Country Study|date=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mutallibov rose to power, but he was soon destabilized and eventually ousted due to popular frustration with his perceived incompetence, corruption and improper handling of the war with Armenia. Azerbaijani KGB and Azerbaijani SSR leader [[Heydar Aliyev]] captured power and remained president until he transferred the presidency to his son in 2003. The [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]] was fought between Armenia and Azerbaijan, and has largely defined the fates of both countries. However, unlike Armenia, which remains a strong Russian ally, Azerbaijan has begun, since Russia's 2008 war with Georgia, to foster better relations with Turkey and other Western nations, while lessening ties with Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nagorno-Karabakh profile|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18270325|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chechnya ===
[[File:Evstafiev-chechnya-women-pray.jpg|thumb|[[Chechen people|Chechen]] women praying in [[Grozny]], December 1994]]
In [[Chechnya]], using tactics partly copied from the Baltics, anti-Communist coalition forces led by former Soviet general [[Dzhokhar Dudayev]] staged a largely bloodless revolution, and ended up forcing the resignation of the Communist republican president. Dudayev was elected in a landslide in the following election and in November 1991 he proclaimed [[Checheno-Ingushetia]]'s independence as the Republic of Ichkeria. Ingushetia voted to leave the union with Chechnya, and was allowed to do so (thus it became the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria). Due to his desire to exclude Moscow from all oil deals, Yeltsin backed a failed coup against him in 1993. In 1994, Chechnya, with only marginal recognition (one country: Georgia, which was revoked soon after the coup landing Shevardnadze in power), was invaded by Russia, spurring the [[First Chechen War]]. The Chechens, with considerable assistance from the populations of both former-Soviet countries and from Sunni Muslim countries repelled this invasion and a peace treaty was signed in 1997. However, Chechnya became increasingly anarchic, largely due to the both political and physical destruction of the state during the invasion, and general Shamil Basaev, having evaded all control by the central government, conducted raids into neighboring Dagestan, which Russia used as pretext for reinvading Ichkeria. Ichkeria was then reincorporated into Russia as Chechnya again, though insurgency continues.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rbc.ru/politics/12/05/2017/5915d8799a794757ef77f42e&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Central Asia ===
* {{flag|Kazakhstan|1991}}'s independence struggle began with the [[Jeltoqsan]] uprising in 1986. Former Communist leader [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] has been in power since 1990 when he started serving as [[Kazakh SSR|President of Kazakh SSR]].
* {{flag|Kyrgyzstan|1991}}'s [[Askar Akayev]] retained power until the [[Tulip Revolution]] in 2005.
* {{flag|Tajikistan|1991}}'s [[Rahmon Nabiyev]] retained power, which led to the [[civil war in Tajikistan]]. [[Emomalii Rahmon]] has succeeded Nabiyev and has retained power since 1992.
* {{flag|Turkmenistan|1991}}'s [[Saparmurat Niyazov]] retained power until his death in 2006 and was criticized as one of the world's most totalitarian and repressive leaders, maintaining his own [[cult of personality]].
* {{flag|Uzbekistan}}'s [[Islam Karimov]] retained power until his death in 2016, and was widely criticized for repressing the political opposition throughout his tenure.

=== Post-Soviet conflicts ===
Russia was involved in a number of conflicts, including the [[Nagorno-Karabakh War]], the [[War of Transnistria]], the [[1991–1992 South Ossetia War]], the [[First Chechen War]], the [[War in Abkhazia (1992–1993)|War in Abkhazia]], the [[Ossetian–Ingush conflict]], and the [[2014 Crimean Crisis|Crimea]] and [[War in Donbass|Donbass]] conflicts in Ukraine.

== Political reforms ==
{{main|Decommunization}}
Decommunization is a process of overcoming the legacies of the [[Communist state]] establishments, culture, and psychology in the post-Communist states.

Decommunization was largely limited or non-existent. Communist parties were not outlawed and their members were not brought to trial. Just a few places even attempted to exclude members of communist secret services from decision-making. In a number of countries the Communist party simply changed its name and continued to function.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icer.it/docs/wp2000/Pejovich162000.pdf After Socialism: where hope for individual liberty lies]. Svetozar Pejovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several European countries, however, endorsing or attempting to justify crimes committed by Nazi or Communist regimes will be punishable by up to 3 years of imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.annefrank.org/content.asp?PID=888&amp;LID=2|title=This page does not / no longer exist|author=Anne Frank Stichting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic reforms ==
State run enterprises in socialist countries had little or no interest in producing what customers wanted which resulted in shortages of goods and services.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt; In the early 1990s, the general view was that there was no precedent for moving from socialism to capitalism",&lt;ref name="Havrylyshyn"/&gt; and only some elderly people remembered how a market economy worked. As result the view that Central, Southeastern and Eastern Europe would stay poor for decades was common.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title=The world after 1989: Walls in the mind |work=The Economist | date=5 November 2009 | url=http://www.economist.com/displayStory.cfm?story_id=14793753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was a temporary fall of output in the official economy and an increase in black market economic activity.&lt;ref name="aslund"/&gt;
Countries implemented different reform programs. One example, generally regarded as successful was the "shock therapy" [[Balcerowicz Plan]] in Poland. Eventually the official economy began to grow.&lt;ref name="aslund"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Myth of Output Collapse after Communism | author=Anders Aslund | date=1 December 2000 | url=http://www.carnegieendowment.org/publications/index.cfm?fa=view&amp;id=611 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, President Yeltsin's government invited [[Vladimir Bukovsky]] to serve as an expert to testify at the [[CPSU]] trial by [[Constitutional Court]] of Russia, where the Communists were suing Yeltsin for banning their party. The respondent's case was that the [[CPSU]] itself had been an unconstitutional organization. To prepare for his testimony, Bukovsky requested and was granted access to a large number of documents from Soviet archives (then reorganized into [[TsKhSD]]). Using a small handheld scanner and a laptop computer, he managed to secretly scan many documents (some with high [[security clearance]]), including [[KGB]] reports to the [[Central Committee]], and smuggle the files to the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | publisher = JHU | contribution-url = http://psi.ece.jhu.edu/~kaplan/IRUSS/BUK/GBARC/buk.html | contribution = Soviet Archives | title = Info-Russ}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The event that many expected would be another [[Nuremberg Trial]] and the beginnings of reconciliation with the Communist past, ended up in half-measures: while the CPSU was found unconstitutional, the Communists were allowed to form new parties in the future. Bukovsky expressed his deep disappointment with this in his writings and interviews: "Having failed to finish off conclusively the Communist system, we are now in danger of integrating the resulting monster into our world. It may not be called Communism anymore, but it retained many of its dangerous characteristics... Until the Nuremberg-style tribunal passes its judgment on all the crimes committed by Communism, it is not dead and the war is not over."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.frontpagemag.com./Articles/Printable.asp?ID=1589 | title = The Cold War and the War Against Terror | first = Jamie | last = Glazov | newspaper = Front Page | date = 1 July 2002}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Interpretations ==
The events caught many by surprise. [[Predictions of Soviet collapse|Predictions of the Soviet Union's impending demise]] had been often dismissed.&lt;ref name="melt"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ian|last=Cummins|title=The Great MeltDown|work=The Australian|date=23 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bartlomiej Kaminski's book ''The Collapse of State Socialism'' argued that the state Socialist system has a lethal paradox, saying that "policy actions designed to improve performance only accelerate its decay".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/47325/robert-legvold/the-collapse-of-state-socialism | title = The Collapse of State Socialism | newspaper = Foreign Affairs}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of 1989, revolts had spread from one capital to another, ousting the regimes imposed on Central, South-East and Eastern Europe after World War II. Even the isolationist Stalinist regime in Albania was unable to stem the tide. Gorbachev's abrogation of the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]] was perhaps the key factor that enabled the popular uprisings to succeed. Once it became evident that the feared Soviet Army would not intervene to crush dissent, the Central, South-East and Eastern European regimes were exposed as vulnerable in the face of popular uprisings against the one-party system and power of [[secret police]].

[[Coit D. Blacker]] wrote in 1990 that the Soviet leadership "appeared to have believed that whatever loss of authority the Soviet Union might suffer in Central and South-East Europe would be more than offset by a net increase in its influence in western Europe."&lt;ref name="fa90"&gt;{{Citation | first = Coit D | last = Blacker | title = The Collapse of Soviet Power in Europe | journal = Foreign Affairs | year = 1990}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, it is unlikely that Gorbachev ever intended for the complete dismantling of Communism and the Warsaw Pact. Rather, Gorbachev assumed that the Communist parties of Central and South-East Europe could be reformed in a similar way to the reforms he hoped to achieve in the CPSU. Just as ''perestroika'' was aimed at making the Soviet Union more efficient economically and politically, Gorbachev believed that the [[Comecon]] and Warsaw Pact could be reformed into more effective entities. However, [[Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev|Alexander Yakovlev]], a close advisor to Gorbachev, would later state that it would have been "absurd to keep the system" in Central and South-East Europe. Yakovlev had come to the conclusion that the Soviet-dominated Comecon could not work on non-market principles and that the Warsaw Pact had "no relevance to real life."&lt;ref name="Steele"&gt;{{Citation | last = Steele | first = Jonathan | title = Eternal Russia: Yeltsin, Gorbachev and the Mirage of Democracy | place = Boston | publisher = Faber | year = 1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''security interest''' is a legal right granted by a debtor to a creditor over the debtor's [[property]] (usually referred to as the ''[[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/collateral.asp|title=Collateral|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=2003-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;) which enables the creditor to have recourse to the property if the debtor defaults in making [[payment]] or otherwise performing the secured obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/security-interest.asp|title=Security Interest|publisher=Investopedia|accessdate=30 August 2017|date=2009-12-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the most common examples of a security interest is a [[Mortgage law|mortgage]]: When person, by the action of an expressed conveyance, pledges by a promise to pay a certain sum of money, with certain conditions, on a said date or dates for a said period, that action on the page with wet ink applied on the part of the one wishing the exchange creates the original funds and negotiable Instrument. That action of pledging conveys a promise binding upon the mortgagee  which creates a face value upon the Instrument of the amount of currency being asked for in exchange. It is therein in good faith offered to the Bank in exchange for local currency from the Bank to buy a house. The particular country's [[Bank Act (Canada)|Bank Acts]] usually requires the Banks to deliver such fund bearing negotiable instruments to the Countries Main Bank such as is the case in Canada. This creates a security interest in the land the house sits on for the Bank and they file a caveat at land titles on the house as evidence of that security interest. If the mortgagee {{Clarify|reason=Do you mean mortgagor?|date=October 2018}} fails to pay defaulting in his promise to repay the exchange, the bank then applies to the court to for-close on your property to eventually sell the house and apply the proceeds to the outstanding exchange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.consumerfinance.gov/ask-cfpb/my-mortgage-closing-forms-mention-a-security-interest-what-is-a-security-interest-en-1999/|title=What is a 'security interest'?|publisher=CFPB|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most security interests are created [[contract|by agreement between the parties]], it is also possible for a security interest to arise by [[operation of law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/security-interest.html|title=Security Interest|publisher=The Business Dictionary|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in many jurisdictions a mechanic who repairs a car benefits from a [[lien]] over the car for the cost of repairs.  This lien arises by operation of law in the absence of any agreement between the parties.

Most security interests are granted by the person who owns the property to secure their own indebtedness.  But it is also possible for a person to grant security over their property as collateral for the debts of another person (often called ''third party security'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fieldfisher.com/publications/2014/02/a-guide-to-third-party-security|title=Guide to third party security|publisher=Field Fisher|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  So a parent might grant a security interest over their home to support a business loan being made to their child.  Similarly, most security interests operate to secure debts or other direct financial obligations.  But sometimes a security is granted to secure a non-financial obligation.  For example in construction a [[performance bond]] may secure the satisfactory performance of non-financial obligations.

The different types of security interest which can arise and the rights which they confer [[Conflict of contract laws|will vary from country to country]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abfjournal.com/articles/cross-border-asset-based-loans-transforming-challenges-into-opportunities/|title=Cross-Border, Asset-Based Loans|publisher=ABF Journal|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rationale ==

A secured creditor takes a security interest to enforce its rights against [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] in case the debtor [[default (finance)|default]]s on the obligation. If the debtor goes bankrupt, a secured creditor takes precedence over unsecured creditors in the distribution.

There are other reasons that people sometimes take security over assets.  In shareholders' agreements involving two parties (such as a [[joint venture]]), sometimes the shareholders {{cfy|reason=huh?|text=will each charge their shares in favor of the other as security for the performance of their obligations under the agreement to prevent the other shareholder selling their shares to a third party|date=March 2016}}.  It is sometimes suggested that banks may take [[floating charge]]s over companies by way of security - not so much for the security for payment of their own debts, but because this ensures that no other bank will, ordinarily, lend to the company; thereby almost granting a monopoly in favour of the bank holding the floating charge on lending to the company.{{efn|"A charge... may be so all-embracing as to give the charge holder what amounts in practice to an exclusive right to supply the debtor with credit in that potential second financiers will be deterred from lending by the breadth of the existing charge."{{sfn|Finch|2002|p=78}}}}

Some economists question the utility of security interests and secured lending generally. Proponents argue that secured interests lower the risk for the lender, and in turn allows the lender to charge lower interest, thereby lowering the cost of capital for the borrower. For example, interest rates for a [[mortgage loan]] (for which the mortgage is secured by the real property) are considerably lower than for a [[credit card]] debt (where there may be no collateral at all, or such collateral is easily hidden or depreciates rapidly).

Detractors argue that creditors with security interests can destroy companies that are in financial difficulty, but which might still recover and be profitable. The secured lenders might get nervous and enforce the security early, repossessing key assets and forcing the company into bankruptcy.  Further, the general principle of most insolvency regimes is that creditors should be treated equally (or ''[[pari passu]]''), and allowing secured creditors a preference to certain assets upsets the conceptual basis of an insolvency.{{efn|Although the principle of equality is rarely observed in practice, most countries have "[[preferential creditor]]s" (including, usually, employees and the [[tax]] authorities, who have first claim on an insolvency; see e.g. [[Cork Report]], ch 35, para 149-197}}

More sophisticated criticisms of security point out that although unsecured creditors will receive less on insolvency, they should be able to compensate by charging a higher interest rate. However, since many unsecured creditors are unable to adjust their "interest rates" upwards (tort claimants, employees), the company benefits from a cheaper rate of credit, to the detriment of these non-adjusting creditors. There is thus a transfer of value from these parties to secured borrowers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1 = Lucian A. Bebchuk|author2 = Jesse M. Fried|year= 1996|title= The Uneasy Case for the Priority of Secured Claims in Bankruptcy|ssrn= 417960|journal= [[Yale Law Journal]]|volume= 105|issue= 4|pages= 857{{endash}}934 |doi=10.2307/797243|jstor = 797243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most insolvency law allows mutual debts to be [[set-off (law)|set-off]], allowing certain creditors (those who also owe money to the insolvent debtor) a pre-preferential position. In some countries, "involuntary" creditors (such as [[tort]] victims) also have preferential status, and in others environmental claims have special preferred rights for cleanup costs.

The most frequently used criticism of secured lending is that, if secured creditors are allowed to seize and sell key assets, a liquidator or bankruptcy trustee loses the ability to sell off the business as a [[going concern]], and may be forced to sell the business on a break-up basis. This may mean realising a much smaller return for the unsecured creditors, and will invariably mean that all the employees will be made redundant.

For this reason, many jurisdictions restrict the ability of secured creditors to enforce their rights in a bankruptcy. In the U.S., the [[Chapter 11, Title 11, United States Code|Chapter 11]] creditor protection, which completely prevents enforcement of security interests, aims at keeping enterprises running at the expense of creditors' rights, and is often heavily criticised for that reason.{{efn|''[[The Economist]]'' described the American bankruptcy system, [[tongue-in-cheek]], as "...perverse affairs. First, failed managers often hang on to the helm well after their firms have officially gone bust. After companies seek safe harbour under Chapter 11, America's famous insolvency law, banks swoop in to lend them even more money. Next, lawyers help the firm restructure older debts, giving bosses months or years to run their businesses interest-free. Failure, American style, is nice work if you can get it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Up from the ashes|journal = The Economist|url = http://www.economist.com/node/1047606|date = March 21, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} In the [[United Kingdom]], an [[Administration (insolvency)|administration order]] has a similar effect, but is less expansive in scope and restriction in terms of creditors rights. European systems are often touted as being pro-creditor, but many European jurisdictions also impose restrictions upon time limits that must be observed before secured creditors can enforce their rights. The most draconian jurisdictions in favour of creditor's rights tend to be in [[offshore financial centres]], who hope that, by having a legal system heavily biased towards secured creditors, they will encourage banks to lend at cheaper rates to offshore structures, and thus in turn encourage business to use them to obtain cheaper funds.{{efn|There seems to be much anecdotal evidence that this works, although hard data is scarce.  A huge proportion of the international shipping tonnage is registered in jurisdictions flying [[flags of convenience]], and, although, again, hard data is difficult to come by, a signification proportion of the non-US [[securitization]] market uses offshore [[special purpose entity|special purpose vehicles]] to issue the [[asset-backed security|asset-backed securities]], partly for benefits in relation to [[recharacterisation]] and partly for benefits in relation to protection of secured creditor's rights.}}

| style="text-align: left;" | "There are only four kinds of consensual security known to English law: (i) pledge; (ii) contractual lien; (iii) equitable charge and (iv) mortgage.  A pledge and a contractual lien both depend upon the delivery of possession to the creditor.  The difference between them is that in the case of a pledge the owner delivers possession to the creditor as security, whereas in the case of a lien the creditor retains a right of possession of goods previously delivered to himfor some other purpose.  Neither a mortgage or a charge depends upon the delivery of possession.  The difference between them is that a mortgage involves a transfer of legal or equitable ownership to the creditor, whereas the equitable charge does not."

|}
Under [[English law]] and in most [[common law]] jurisdictions derived from English law (the United States is the exception as explained below), there are nine major types of proprietary security interests:
{{div col|colwidth=22em}}
#'true' legal mortgage;
#equitable mortgage;
#statutory mortgage;
#fixed equitable charge, or bill of sale;
#floating equitable charge;
#pledge, or pawn;
#legal lien;
#equitable lien; and
#hypothecation, or trust receipt.
{{div col end}}
The United States also developed the conditional sale of personal property as another form of security interest, which is now obsolete.

Security interests at common law are either ''possessory'' or ''[[Nonpossessory interest in land|nonpossessory]]'', depending upon whether the secured party actually needs to take possession of the collateral. Alternatively, they arise ''by agreement'' between the parties (usually by executing a security agreement), or ''by operation of law''.

The evolution of the law of nonpossessory security interests in personal property has been particularly convoluted and messy.  Under the rule of ''[[Twyne's Case]]'' (1601)&lt;ref&gt;''Twyne’s Case'', (1601) 76 Eng. Rep. 809 (Star Chamber).&lt;/ref&gt; transferring an interest in personal property without also immediately transferring possession was consistently regarded as a [[fraudulent conveyance]].{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=24{{endash}}25}}  Over two hundred years would pass before such security interests were recognized as legitimate.

The following discussion of the types of security interest principally concerns English law. English law on security interests has been followed in most [[common law]] countries, and most common law countries have similar property statutes&lt;ref&gt;Based upon the English [[Law of Property Act 1925]] and its predecessor statutes&lt;/ref&gt; regulating the common law rules.

== Types ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Mortgage law]] --&gt;

Security interests may be taken on any type of property. The law divides property into two classes: [[personal property]] and [[real property]]. Real property is the land, the buildings affixed to it and the rights that go with the land. Personal property is defined as any property other than real property.

=== "True" legal mortgage ===
{{see also|Hypothec|Mortgage law}}

A legal mortgage arises when the assets are conveyed to the secured party as security for the obligations, but subject to a right to have the assets reconveyed when the obligations are performed.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Santley v Wilde]]'' [1899] 2 Ch 474; ''[[Carter v Wake]]'' (1877) 4 Ch D 605&lt;/ref&gt;  This right is referred to as the "[[equity of redemption]]".  The law has historically taken a dim view of provisions which might impede this right to have the assets reconveyed (referred to as being a "clog" on the equity of redemption); although the position has become more relaxed in recent years in relation to sophisticated financial transactions.

References to "true" legal mortgages mean mortgages by the traditional common law method of transfer subject to a proviso in this manner, and references are usually made in contradistinction to either equitable mortgages or statutory mortgages.  True legal mortgages are relatively rare in modern commerce, outside of occasionally with respect to [[stock|shares]] in [[company|companies]].  In England, true legal mortgages of land have been abolished in favour of statutory mortgages.&lt;ref&gt;[[Land Registration Act 2002]]&lt;/ref&gt;

To complete a legal mortgage it is normally necessary that title to the assets is conveyed into the name of the secured party such that the secured party (or its nominee) becomes the legal titleholder to the asset.  If a legal mortgage is not completed in this manner it will normally take effect as an equitable mortgage.  Because of the requirement to transfer title, it is not possible to take a legal mortgage over future property, or to take more than one legal mortgage over the same assets.  However, mortgages (legal and equitable) are nonpossessory security interests.  Normally the party granting the mortgage (the ''mortgagor'') will remain in possession of the mortgaged asset.{{efn|The word "mort-gage" comes from the French term meaning "dead pledge", and is in distinction to the "living pledge" whereby the party who benefits from the security interest was expected to take possession of the mortgaged property, and work it to generate a profit; such security interests fell into disuse centuries ago.}}

The holder of a legal mortgage has three primary remedies in the event that there is a default on the secured obligations:

#they can foreclose on the assets,
#they can sell the assets, or
#they can appoint a receiver over the assets.

The holder of a mortgage can also usually sue upon the covenant to pay which appears in most mortgage instruments.  There are a range of other remedies available to the holder of a mortgage,&lt;ref&gt;Perfection of title, orders for possession, delivery of documents etc.&lt;/ref&gt; but they relate predominantly to land, and accordingly have been superseded by statute, and they are rarely exercised in practice in relation to other assets.  The beneficiary of a mortgage (the ''mortgagee'') is entitled to pursue all of its remedies concurrently&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants=The China and South Sea Bank Limited v Tan Soon Gin, George alias George Tan|link=|court=UKPC|year=1989|num=38|parallelcite=[1990] 1 AC 536|date=|courtname=[[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|P.C.]]|juris=Hong Kong}}''; [[Re Bank of Credit and Commerce International SA (No 8)]]'', [1998] AC 214&lt;/ref&gt; or consecutively.{{efn|The holder for a mortgage may appoint a receiver notwithstanding that they have already started foreclosure proceedings, see ''[[Stevens v Theatres Ltd]]'' [1903] 1 Ch 857; if a power of sale is exercised and there is a shortfall, the holder of the mortgage can still sue on the covenant to pay.  But there are two exceptions - once a decree ''nisi'' has been granted in foreclosure proceedings, the power of sale can only be exercised with the leave of the court, and an applicant to enforce a right of foreclosure and the covenant to pay should be brought in the same proceedings.}}

Foreclosure is rarely exercised as a remedy. To execute foreclosure, the secured party needs to petition the court,{{efn|''[[Re Farnol, Eades, Irvine &amp; Co]]'' [1915] 1 Ch 22.  "Foreclosure as a thing which can be done by a person has no meaning.  Foreclosure is done by the order of the court, not by any person.  In the strict legal sense it is nothing more than the destruction of the equity of redemption which previously existed." per Warrington J at 24.}} and the order is made in two stages (''nisi'' and ''absolute''), making the process slow and cumbersome.  Courts are historically reluctant to grant orders for foreclosure, and will often instead order a judicial sale.  If the asset is worth more than the secured obligations, the secured party will normally have to account for the surplus.  Even if a court makes a decree ''absolute'' and orders foreclosure, the court retains an absolute discretion to reopen the foreclosure after the making of the order,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Campbell v Holyland]]'' (1877) 7 Ch D 166; ''[[Quarles v Knight]]'' (1820) 8 Price 630; ''[[Eyre v Hansom]]'' (1840) 2 Beav 349&lt;/ref&gt; although this would not affect the title of any third party purchaser.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stevens v Theatres Ltd]]'' [1903] 1 Ch 857&lt;/ref&gt;

The holder of a legal mortgage also has a power of sale over the assets.  Every mortgage contains an implied power of sale.&lt;ref name = "Deverges"&gt;''[[Deverges v Sandeman, Clark &amp; Co]]'' [1902] 1 Ch 579&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Stubbs v Slater]]'' [1910] 1 Ch 632&lt;/ref&gt;  This implied power exists even if the mortgage is not under seal.&lt;ref name = "Deverges"/&gt;  All mortgages which are made by way of deed also ordinarily contain a power of sale implied by statute, but the exercise of the statutory power is limited by the terms of the statute.  Neither implied power of sale requires a court order,  although the court can usually also order a judicial sale.  The secured party has a duty to get the best price reasonably obtainable, however, this does not require the sale to be conducted in any particular fashion (i.e. by auction or sealed bids).  What the best price reasonably obtainable will be will depend upon the market available for the assets and related considerations.  The sale must be a true sale - a mortgagee cannot sell to himself, either alone or with others, even for fair value;&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Bank of Australasia v United Hand-in-Hand and Band of Hope]]'' (1879) 4 App Cas 391; ''[[Martinson v Clowes]]'' (1882) 21 Ch D 857; ''Warner v Jacob'' (1882) 20 Ch D 220&lt;/ref&gt; such a sale may be restrained or set aside or ignored.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Williams v Wellingborough BC]]'' [1975] 1 WLR 1327; ''[[Martinson v Clowes]]'' (1882) 21 Ch D 857&lt;/ref&gt;  However, if the court orders a sale pursuant to statute, the mortgagee may be expressly permitted to buy.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Palk v Mortgage Services Funding plc]]'' [1993] Ch 330&lt;/ref&gt;

The third remedy is to appoint a receiver.  Technically the right to appoint a receiver can arise two different ways - under the terms of the mortgage instrument, and (where the mortgage instrument is executed as a deed) by statute.

If the mortgagee takes possession then under the common law they owe strict duties to the mortgagor to safeguard the value of the property (although the terms of the mortgage instrument will usually limit this obligation).  However, the common law rules relate principally to physical property, and there is a shortage of authority as to how they might apply to taking "possession" of rights, such as shares.  Nonetheless, a mortgagee is well advised to remain respectful of their duty to preserve the value of the mortgaged property both for their own interests and under their potential liability to the mortgagor.

=== Equitable mortgage ===

An equitable mortgage can arise in two different ways – either as a legal mortgage which was never perfected by conveying the underlying assets, or by specifically creating a mortgage as an equitable mortgage.  A mortgage over equitable rights (such as a beneficiary's interests under a trust) will necessarily exist in equity only in any event.

Under the laws of some jurisdictions, a mere deposit of title documents can give rise to an equitable mortgage.&lt;ref&gt;For a recent example an equitable mortgage created this way in Australia, see {{cite AustLII|litigants=Theodore v Mistford Pty Ltd|link=Theodore v Mistford Pty Ltd|court=HCA|num=45|year=2005|pinpoint=|parallelcite=|date=|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With respect to land this has now been abolished in England,{{efn|The [[English Court of Appeal]] in ''[[United Bank of Kuwait v Sahib]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= United Bank of Kuwait Plc v Sahib &amp; Ors|link=|court=EWCA|division=Civ|year=1996|num=1308|parallelcite=[1996] 3 WLR 372|date=2 February 1996|courtname=|juris=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in construing a provision relating to formalities for disposition of interests in land in the [[Law of Property (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1989]], held that the provisions repealed the common law rules relating the creation of equitable mortgages by deposit of title deeds.&lt;ref&gt;see {{cite journal |author = M. Robinson|year= 1997|title= In the Chancery adventure playground|url= |journal= [[Law Quarterly Review]]|volume= 113|issue= |page= 533}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} although in many jurisdictions company shares can still be mortgaged by deposit of share certificates in this manner.

Generally speaking, an equitable mortgage has the same effect as a perfected legal mortgage except in two respects.  Firstly, being an equitable right, it will be extinguished by a bona fide purchaser for value who did not have notice of the mortgage.  Secondly, because the legal title to the mortgaged property is not actually vested in the secured party, it means that a necessary additional step is imposed in relation to the exercise of remedies such as foreclosure.

=== Statutory mortgage ===

Many jurisdictions permit specific assets to be mortgaged without transferring title to the assets to the mortgagee.  Principally, statutory mortgages relate to land, registered aircraft and registered ships.  Generally speaking, the mortgagee will have the same rights as they would have had under a traditional true legal mortgage, but the manner of enforcement is usually regulated by the statute.

=== Equitable charge ===

A fixed equitable charge confers a right on the secured party to look to (or appropriate) a particular asset in the event of the debtor's default, which is enforceable by either power of sale or appointment of a receiver.  It is probably the most common form of security taken over assets. Technically, a charge (or a "mere" charge) cannot include the power to enforce without judicial intervention, as it does not include the transfer of a proprietary interest in the charged asset. If a charge includes this right (such as private sale by a receiver), it is really an equitable mortgage (sometimes called charge by way of mortgage). Since little turns on this distinction, the term "charge" is often used to include an equitable mortgage.

An equitable charge is also a nonpossessory form of security, and the beneficiary of the charge (the ''chargee'') does not need to retain possession of the charged property.

Where security equivalent to a charge is given by a natural person (as opposed to a corporate entity) it is usually expressed to be a [[bill of sale]], and is regulated under applicable bills of sale legislation. Difficulties with the Bills of Sale Acts in Ireland, England and Wales have made it virtually impossible for individuals to create floating charges.

=== Floating charge ===

{{main|Floating charge}}

Floating charges are similar in effect to fixed equitable charges once they crystallise (usually upon the commencement of liquidation proceedings against the chargor), but prior to that they "float" and do not attach to any of the chargor's assets, and the chargor remains free to deal with or dispose of them.  The U.S. equivalent is the floating lien, which unlike the floating charge, can be given by any kind of debtor, not just corporate entities.

=== Pledge ===

{{see also|Pledge (law)}}

A pledge (also sometimes called a pawn) is a form of possessory security, and accordingly, the assets which are being pledged need to be physically delivered to the beneficiary of the pledge (the ''pledgee'').  Pledges are in commercial contexts used in trading companies (especially, physically, commodity trading), and are still used by [[pawnbrokers]], which, contrary to their old world image, remain a regulated credit industry.

The pledgee has a common law power of sale in the event of a default on the secured obligations which arises if the secured obligations are not satisfied by the agreed time (or, in default of agreement, within a reasonable period of time).  If the power of sale is exercised, then the holder of the pledge must account to the pledgor for any surplus after payment of the secured obligations.

A pledge does not confer a right to appoint a receiver or foreclose.  If the holder of pledge sells or disposes of the pledged assets when not entitled to do so, they may be liable in conversion to the pledgor.

The major flaw with the pledge is that it requires physical possession by the pledgee, which traps a business pledgor in a paradox.  Unless the pledgee literally occupies the same premises as the pledger, the collateral once transferred is unavailable for the pledgor to operate its business and generate income to repay the pledgee.  Lawyers in many jurisdictions tried to get around this problem with creative devices like conditional sales and trust receipts (see below) with varying results.

=== Legal lien ===
{{Main|Lien}}

A legal lien, in many [[common law]] systems, includes a right to retain physical possession of tangible assets as security for the underlying obligations. In some jurisdictions it is a form of possessory security, and possession of the assets must be transferred to (and maintained by) the secured party. In the case of a possessory lien, the right is purely passive. In the case of a possessory lien, the secured party (the ''lienor'')&lt;ref&gt;"Lienor... The person having or owning a lien; one who has a right of lien upon property of another". Black's Law Dictionary, p. 832 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; has no right to sell the assets - merely a right to refuse to return them until paid. In the United States, a lien can be a nonpossessory security interest.

Many legal liens arise as a matter of law (by common law or by statute). It is possible, however, to create a legal lien by contract. The courts have confirmed that it is also possible to give the secured party a power of sale in such a contract, but case law on such a power is limited and it is difficult to know what limitations and duties would be imposed on the exercise of such a power.{{Cn|date=February 2015}}

=== Equitable lien ===
Equitable liens are slightly amorphous forms of security interest that arise only by operation of law in certain circumstances.  Academically it has been noted that there seems to be no real unifying principle behind the circumstances that give rise to them.{{sfn|Palmer|McKendrick|2002|p=975}}

An equitable lien takes effect essentially as an equitable charge, and arises only in specified situations, (e.g. an unpaid vendor's lien in relation to property is an equitable lien; a [[maritime lien]] is sometimes thought to be an equitable lien). It is sometimes argued that where the constitutional documents of a [[company (law)|company]] provide that the company has a lien over its own shares, this provision takes effect as an equitable lien,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Hickman v Kent Sheep Breeders]]'' [1915] 1 Ch 881&lt;/ref&gt; and if that analysis is correct, then it is probably the one exception to the rule that equitable liens arise by operation of law rather than by agreement.

=== Hypothecation ===
{{main|Hypothecation}}
[[Hypothecation]], or "trust receipts" are relatively uncommon forms of security interest whereby the underlying assets are pledged, not by delivery of the assets as in a conventional pledge, but by delivery of a document or other evidence of title.  Hypothecation is usually seen in relation to [[bottomry]] (cf. [[bill of lading|bills of lading]]), whereby the bill of lading is endorsed by the secured party, who, unless the security is redeemed, can claim the property by delivery of the bill.

=== Conditional sale ===

Another form of security interest which flourished in the United States in the late 19th century and the first half of the 20th century was the conditional sale, the ancestor of what U.S. lawyers now call the purchase money security interest (PMSI).{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}} It was popular in that era among creditors for two reasons.{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}} First, most U.S. states had imposed numerous onerous restrictions upon [[chattel mortgage]]s in order to protect debtors (at a time [[debtor's prison]]s were being abolished but were still within the memory of most persons then living), and second, all U.S. states in that era also had strict anti-usury laws.{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}} Conditional sales, at least initially, were seen to be free of both of those problems.{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}}

Under pressure from creditors and their lawyers, U.S. courts gradually developed a highly technical distinction between an absolute, unconditional sale, in which the seller simply became another unsecured creditor of the buyer, and a conditional sale, in which the sale of the goods was made dependent upon some condition (such as payment of the price in installments).{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}} Thus, the buyer's breach of a material condition, in turn, made it possible for the seller to declare the contract had ended, that the ''[[wikt:Special:Search/status quo ante|status quo ante]]'' should be restored, and to repossess the goods accordingly.{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}} Since the buyer had breached, he had forfeited his right to reimbursement of any portion of the price already paid, or in the alternative, those payments could be regarded as a crude form of rent for the use of the goods.{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}}

As conditional sales became popular for financing industrial equipment and consumer goods, U.S. state legislatures began to regulate them as well during the early 20th century, with the result that they soon became almost as complex as the older forms of security interests which they had been used to evade.{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=62{{endash}}85}}

== Security interest vs. general obligation ==
Some obligations are backed only by a security interest against specific designated property, and liability for repayment of the debt is limited to the property itself, with no further claim against the obligor.  These are referred to as "[[nonrecourse debt|nonrecourse obligations]]".

Other obligations (i.e., recourse obligations) are backed by the full credit of the borrower. If the borrower defaults, then the creditor can force the obligor into bankruptcy and the creditors will divide all assets of the obligor.

Depending on the relative credit of the obligor, the quality of the asset, and the availability of a structure to separate the obligations of the asset from the obligations of the obligor, the interest rate charged on one may be higher or lower than the other.

== Perfection ==
{{main|Perfection (law)}}

Perfection of security interests means different things to lawyers in different jurisdictions.
* in [[English law]], perfection has no defined statutory or judicial meaning, but academics have pressed the view that it refers to the attachment of the security interest to the underlying asset.  Others have argued cogently that ''attachment'' is a separate legal concept, and that perfection refers to any steps required to ensure that the security interest is enforceable against third parties.{{sfn|Goode|1988}}
* in [[United States law|American law]], perfection is generally taken to refer to any steps required to ensure that the security interest remains enforceable against other creditors or other parties,&lt;ref&gt;See generally "Perfection of security interest," Black's Law Dictionary, pp. 1023-1024 (5th ed. 1979).&lt;/ref&gt; including a bankruptcy trustee in the case of the debtor's [[bankruptcy]].

The second definition is becoming more frequently used commercially, and arguably is to be preferred,{{Cn|date=February 2015}} as the traditional English legal usage has little purpose except in relation to the comparatively rare true legal mortgage (very few other security interests require additional steps to attach to the asset. Security interests frequently require some form of registration to be enforceable in connection with the chargor's insolvency).

== "Quasi-security" ==
There are a number of other arrangements which parties can put in place which have the effect of conferring security in a commercial sense, but do not actually create a proprietary security interest in the assets.  For example, it is possible to grant a power of attorney or conditional option in favour of the secured party relating to the subject matter, or to utilise a [[title retention clause|retention of title]] arrangement, or execute undated transfer instruments.  Whilst these techniques may provide protection for the secured party, they do not confer a proprietary interest in the assets which the arrangements relate to, and their effectiveness may be limited if the debtor goes into [[bankruptcy]].

It is also possible to replicate the effect of security by making an outright transfer of the asset, with a provision that the asset is re-transferred once the secured obligations are repaid.  In some jurisdictions, these arrangements may be [[recharacterisation|recharacterised]] as the grant of a mortgage, but most jurisdictions tend to allow the parties freedom to characterise their transactions as they see fit.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Welsh Development Agency v Exfinco]]'', [1992] BCLC 148&lt;/ref&gt;  Common examples of this are financings using a stock loan or [[repurchase agreement|repo agreement]] to collateralise the cash advance, and title transfer arrangements (for example, under the "Transfer" form English Law credit support annex to an [[International Swaps and Derivatives Association|ISDA]] Master Agreement (as distinguished from the other forms of CSA, which grant security)).

==The law in different jurisdictions==

===European Union===

The laws relating to taking and enforcing security vary by country, and depend on whether it derives from [[common law]] or [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Taking and enforcing security in Europe|publisher = Taylor Wessing LLP|url = http://www.taylorwessing.com/fileadmin/files/docs/Taking_and_enforcing_security_in_Europe.pdf|date = February 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[European Union]], the ''Financial Collateral Arrangements Directive'' provides for ''appropriation'' as a remedy for securing [[collateral (finance)|financial collateral]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EU directive |serial= 2002/47/EC|year= 2002 |date= 6 June 2002 |description = on financial collateral arrangements |eurlextag = OJ:L:2002:168:0043:0050:EN:PDF }}, at Art. 4&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]], this has been introduced under the ''Financial Collateral Arrangements (No.2) Regulations 2003''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type = si|year = 2003|number = 3226|si = The Financial Collateral Arrangements (No.2) Regulations 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the assets subject to the mortgage are "financial collateral" and the mortgage instrument provides that the regulations apply.  Appropriation is a means whereby the mortgagee can take title to the assets, but must account to the mortgagor for their fair market value (which must be specified in the mortgage instrument), but without the need to obtain any court order. In 2009, the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] ruled that as a matter of English law:

#Appropriation is much closer to sale than it is to foreclosure. It is in effect a sale by the collateral-taker to himself, at a price determined by an agreed valuation process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII|litigants= Cukurova Finance International Ltd &amp; Anor v. Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd|link=|court=UKPC|year=2009|num=19|para=27|parallelcite= [2009] 3 All ER 849|date=5 May 2009|courtname=[[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council|P.C.]]|juris=British Virgin Islands}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#It is not necessary, for a valid appropriation, for the collateral-taker to become a registered holder of the shares.&lt;ref&gt;''Cukurova'', par. 34&lt;/ref&gt;
#Commercial practicalities require that there should be an overt act evincing the intention to exercise a power of appropriation, communicated to the collateral-provider.&lt;ref&gt;''Cukurova'', par. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

The principles under which equitable relief may be sought, where appropriation has been exercised under English law, were expressed in 2013 in ''[[Cukurova Finance International Ltd v Alfa Telecom Turkey Ltd]]''.

===United States (the Uniform Commercial Code)===

In the late 1940s, the United States (U.S.) legal community arrived at a consensus that the traditional common law distinctions were obsolete and served no useful purpose.  They tended to generate too much unnecessary litigation about whether the creditor had selected the correct type of security interest.  There was a growing recognition that the different types of security interests had developed only because on the one hand, many judges thought there was something inherently wrong with allowing a person, either out of desperation or foolishness, to summarily encumber all his or her personal property as collateral for a loan, but on the other, debtors and creditors would attempt to reach a desired result by any means necessary, even if that meant resorting to creating multiple security interests to cover different types of personal property.{{sfn|McCormack|2004|p=50}} There was also the problem of the above-mentioned early English cases that regarded such security interests as fraudulent conveyances and failed to recognize that they had legitimate uses in a modern industrial economy.  Therefore, because the very history of security interests demonstrated that judicial resistance to enforcing broad security interests ''would not stop'' debtors from trying to give them as inducement to creditors to extend financing, and that they were socially useful under the proper circumstances, the better choice was to make the law of security interests as clear and simple as possible.

The result was Article 9 of the [[Uniform Commercial Code]] (UCC), which regulates security interests in ''personal property'' (as opposed to real property) and establishes a unified concept of a ''security interest'' as a right in a [[debtor]]'s property that secures payment or performance of an obligation.{{sfn|Gilmore|1965|pp=288{{endash}}294}}

Article 9 was subsequently enacted, although not entirely without variations, by the 50 [[U.S. states|states]], [[District of Columbia]], and most [[Territories of the United States|territories]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[Uniform Commercial Code adoption]] for additional details regarding adoption by U.S. jurisdictions.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Article 9, a security interest is created by a security agreement, under which the debtor grants a security interest in the debtor's property as [[collateral (finance)|collateral]] for a [[loan]] or other obligation.

A security interest grants the holder a right to take a remedial action with respect to the property, upon occurrence of certain events, such as the non-payment of a loan. The creditor may take possession of such property in satisfaction of the underlying obligation. The holder will sell such property at a [[public auction]] or through a private sale, and apply the proceeds to satisfy the underlying obligation. If the proceeds exceed the amount of the underlying obligation, the debtor is entitled to the excess. If the proceeds fall short, the holder of the security interest is entitled to a deficiency judgment whereby the holder can institute additional legal proceedings to recover the full amount unless it is a [[non-recourse debt]] like many mortgage loans in the United States.

In the U.S. the term "security interest" is often used interchangeably with "[[lien]]". However, the term "lien" is more often associated with the collateral of real property than with of personal property.

A security interest is typically granted by a "security agreement". The security interest is established with respect to the property, if the debtor has an ownership interest in the property and the holder of the security interest conferred value to the debtor, such as giving a loan.

The holder may "perfect" the security interest to put third parties on notice thereof. Perfection is typically achieved by filing a financing statement with government, often the secretary of state located at a jurisdiction where a corporate debtor is incorporated. Perfection can also be obtained by possession of the collateral, if the collateral is tangible property.

Absent perfection, the holder of the security interest may have difficulty enforcing his rights in the collateral with regard to third parties, including a trustee in bankruptcy and other creditors who claim a security interest in the same collateral.

If the debtor defaults (and does not file for bankruptcy), the UCC offers the creditor the choice of either suing the debtor in court or conducting a disposition by either public or private sale.  UCC dispositions are designed to be held by private parties without any judicial involvement, although the debtor and other secured creditors of the debtor have the right to sue the creditor conducting the disposition if it is not conducted in a "commercially reasonable" fashion to maximize proceeds from the sale of the collateral.

Article 9 is limited in scope to personal property and [[Fixture (property law)|fixtures]] (i.e., personal property attached to real property).  Security interests in real property continue to be governed by non-uniform laws (in the form of statutory law or case law or both) which vary dramatically from state to state.  In a slight majority of states, the [[Trust deed (real estate)|deed of trust]] is the primary instrument for taking a security interest in real property, while the [[Mortgage law|mortgage]] is used in the remainder.

===Commonwealth===

As noted above, UCC Article 9's core insight was that the traditional distinctions were hopelessly obsolete, which was highly influential elsewhere and inspired the enactment of the ''[[Personal Property Security Act (Canada)|Personal Property Security Acts]]'' throughout Canada during the 1990s.  Although Ontario was the first province to enact such a law in 1990, all other Canadian provinces and territories followed the example set by [[Saskatchewan]]'s PPSA enacted in 1993.  The PPSAs are generally similar to UCC Article 9. However, they differ substantially on several issues such as the treatment of rental property, and the effectiveness of a financing statement after a debtor changes its name. Quebec has not enacted a PPSA but the sections of the 1994 [[Quebec Civil Code]] governing [[hypothec]]s were clearly influenced by the PPSAs and Article 9, and the province has made further amendments to the Civil Code to make possible more types of transactions that are already available in Article 9 jurisdictions. 

In turn, [[international development]] experts recognized in the mid-1990s that reform of the law of security interests was a major reason for the prosperity of both Canada and United States, in that it had enabled their businesses to finance growth through forms of secured lending which simply did not exist elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Heywood Fleisig, [http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/1996/06/pdf/fleisig.pdf "Secured Transactions: The Power of Collateral,"] ''Finance and Development'', 44-46.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[International Monetary Fund]], the [[World Bank]], and other international lenders began to encourage other countries to follow Canada's example as part of the [[structural adjustment]] process (a consultation process often required as a condition of their loans). The Canadian PPSAs were subsequently followed by the New Zealand Personal Property Securities Act 1999, the Vanuatu Personal Property Securities Act 2008, the Australia Personal Property Securities Act 2009, the Papua New Guinea Personal Property Security Act 2012, the Jersey Security Interests Law 2012 (covering intangible personal property only), the Samoa Personal Property Securities Act 2013, and the Jamaica Security Interests in Personal Property Act 2013.   

The Canadian, New Zealand and Australian acts all followed the UCC's pragmatic "function over form" approach and borrowed extensive portions of Article 9's terminology and framework.  However, New Zealand, as a [[unitary state]], only needed to enact one act for the whole country and was able to create a single nationwide "register" for security interests.  While the U.S. enacted Article 9 at the state level and Canada enacted its PPSAs at the provincial level, Australia, another common law federation, deliberately implemented its new security interest law at the federal level in order to supersede over 70 state laws and create a national register similar to New Zealand's.

===Civil law===

The first major attempt to bring the benefits of UCC Article 9 to civil law jurisdictions was launched by the [[European Bank for Reconstruction and Development]] in 1992, which resulted in the EBRD Model Law for Secured Transactions in 1994.  However, the EBRD Model Law's approach to the entire subject differed radically from UCC Article 9, and it was also quite limited. For example, it did not have provisions for purchase money security interests. Nearly all Central and Eastern European countries undertook reform of their secured transactions laws in the 1990s and 2000s, although most of them either came up with ''ad hoc'' indigenous solutions or followed the EBRD Model Law to some extent. Only Albania, Kosovo, and Montenegro attempted to closely follow the UCC Article 9 approach. 

In 2002, the [[Organization of American States]] promulgated the Model Inter-American Law on Secured Transactions, in response to a rapidly growing body of empirical evidence that the chronic failure of Latin America's legal systems to support modern asset-based financing is a primary reason for the region's economic instability.  The OAS Model Law attempted to import many of the best parts of UCC Article 9 into the Latin American civil law sphere, but with extensive revisions for that region's unique problems. The OAS Model Law has been enacted to some extent in several countries, including Mexico (2000, 2003, and 2010), Peru (2006), Guatemala (2007), and Honduras (2009). 

To date, only Honduras has been able to fully enact and actually implement the OAS Model Law in a manner faithful to the spirit of UCC Article 9, in the sense of unifying security interests and making them easily visible on a public registry.  At the launch of the Pathways to Prosperity in the Americas initiative in San Jose, Costa Rica on March 4, 2010, then-U.S. Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] stressed that "the United States is committed to working with our Pathways partners to modernize laws that govern lending so that small and medium size businesses can use assets other than real estate as collateral for loans," and generously praised Honduras for its aggressive reform efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Clinton|first=Hillary Rodham|title=Remarks: Pathways to Prosperity Ministerial|url=https://www.state.gov/secretary/20092013clinton/rm/2010/03/137832.htm|publisher=U.S. Department of State|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=4 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Separately, after the issue of secured transactions reform was recommended to the [[United Nations Commission on International Trade Law]] in 2000 by the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary-General]], UNCITRAL eventually prepared a Legislative Guide on Secured Transactions as a recommendation to all countries, which ended up structured as an compromise between ''all'' major legal systems.  Therefore, although it was obviously inspired by UCC Article 9, the Legislative Guide did not closely conform to Article 9's terminology or structure.  The Legislative Guide uses different terminology for even the most basic concepts. For example, it uses the term "security right" in lieu of "security interest".  On December 11, 2008, the Guide was subsequently endorsed by the 67th plenary meeting of the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in Resolution 63/121, which took effect January 15, 2009.

'''Small Business Saturday''' is an American shopping holiday held during the Saturday after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|US Thanksgiving]] during one of the busiest shopping periods of the year. This Saturday is always the last one in November, so falls between November 24 and November 30.

==History==
First observed in the United States on November 27, 2010, it is a counterpart to [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] and [[Cyber Monday]], which feature [[big box retail]] and [[e-commerce]] stores respectively. By contrast, Small Business Saturday encourages holiday shoppers to patronize [[brick and mortar]] businesses that are [[Small business|small]] and [[Localism (politics)|local]]. ''Small Business Saturday'' is a registered trademark of American Express.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.trademarkia.com/small-business-saturday-85155778.html |title= SMALL BUSINESS SATURDAY Trademark Information |access-date= November 24, 2017 |publisher= Trademarkia}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first event was sponsored by American Express, in partnership with the non-profit [[National Trust for Historic Preservation]], Boston Mayor Thomas M. Menino, and Roslindale Village Main Street. In 2010, the holiday was promoted by [[American Express]] via a nationwide radio and television [[advertising campaign]]. That year Amex bought [[Internet advertising|advertising inventory]] on [[Facebook]], which it in turn gave to its small [[merchant account]] holders,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/129649/-small-business-saturday--campaign-boosts-city-merchants |publisher=NY1 News |title="Small Business Saturday" Campaign Boosts City Merchants |date=November 27, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130051924/http://www.ny1.com/content/top_stories/129649/-small-business-saturday--campaign-boosts-city-merchants |archivedate=November 30, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and also gave rebates to new customers to promote the event.&lt;ref name="philly"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philly.com/inquirer/business/20101121_In_holiday_shopping__Small_Business_Saturday_is_small_business__rebuttal_to_Black_Friday.html|title=In holiday shopping, Small Business Saturday is small business' rebuttal to Black Friday|first=Diane|last=Mastrull|date=November 21, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.stockbriefings.com/american-express-nyseaxp-%E2%80%98small-business-saturday%E2%80%99/3176918|publisher=StockBriefings.com|title='Small Business Saturday'|first=Michel|last=Pena|date=November 27, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101130081600/http://www.stockbriefings.com/american-express-nyseaxp-%E2%80%98small-business-saturday%E2%80%99/3176918|archivedate=November 30, 2010|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American Express publicized the initiative using [[social media]], advertising, and [[public relations]]. Many local politicians and small business groups in the United States issued proclamations concerning the campaign,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myfox8.com/news/sns-ap-nc--smallbusinessday,0,6347959.story|publisher=Associated Press|title=North Carolina's small businesses noted as Gov.

==Hashtag==
The [[Twitter]] hashtag #SmallBusinessSaturday has existed since early 2010 and was used to promote small businesses on any Saturday (not solely that Saturday between Black Friday and Cyber Monday). The hashtag is used in a manner similar to #FollowFriday to highlight favorite local businesses.  Additionally, some small business owners have run marketing specials on the November Small Business Saturday to help capitalize on the boost in foot or online traffic, as most customers in this time period are actively shopping for the holidays.

==Around the world==
[[Small Business Saturday UK]] began in the United Kingdom in 2013 after the success of Small Business Saturday in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/retailandconsumer/10501415/Small-Business-Saturday-hailed-as-success.html|title=Small Business Saturday Hailed as Success.

In the context of [[Production (economics)|production]], a '''split-off point''' is the point at which joint products appear in the production process.&lt;ref&gt;Wouters, Mark; Selto, Frank H.; Hilton, Ronald W.; Maher, Michael W. (2012): ''Cost Management: Strategies for Business Decisions'', International Edition, Berkshire (UK), p. 532.&lt;/ref&gt;

Example:

When the Entity is carrying on the business with two subsidiaries,one subsidiary is making huge profits and another subsidiary making huge losses.....while preparing the financial statements of the company, the company showing no profit and no loss,and these will not attract the investors.The company got the idea to form independent companies so that it can be easily measurable and it can decide the future of the companies and where developments required for the companies.

'''Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou''' ({{lang-el|Στέλιος Χατζηιωάννου}}; born 14 February 1967) is a [[British Cypriots|British Cypriot]] entrepreneur. He is the scion of a wealthy ship owning family, but is best known for founding the [[Low-cost carrier|low-cost airline]] [[easyJet]] and the Stelmar shipping line with start-up funds provided by his father, [[Loucas Haji-Ioannou]]. easyJet's foundation in 1995 marked the beginning of a series of ventures marketed under the "easy" brand, managed by easyGroup and chaired by Haji-Ioannou.

== Family and education ==
Stelios Haji-Ioannou is the second of three children by Loucas and Nedi Haji-Ioannou. He was born in [[Athens]] on 14 February 1967. He has an elder brother, [[Polys Haji-Ioannou|Polys]], and a younger sister, [[Clelia Haji-Ioannou|Clelia]]. His father's family originates from the village of [[Pedoulas]] high in the [[Troodos Mountains]] of Cyprus, while his mother is from the Potsos family of [[Laneia]], a village at the foot of the mountains. After his secondary education in Athens, he studied Economics at the [[London School of Economics]], graduating with a BSc in 1987. He went on to obtain an [[MSc]] in Shipping, Trade &amp; Finance from [[Cass Business School]]. He was later awarded four honorary doctorates from [[Liverpool John Moores University]], [[Cass Business School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=FT Innovate Speakers and bios|year=2006 |url=http://www.ftinnovate.com/2006/speakers.aspx?m_pid=0&amp;m_nid=11963|work=[[Financial Times]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928001803/http://www.ftinnovate.com/2006/speakers.aspx?m_pid=0&amp;m_nid=11963 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=28 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Newcastle University#Business School|Newcastle Business School]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newcastlebusinessschool.co.uk/news-stelios.aspx|title=Top Honour for Stelios|publisher=[[Newcastle University#Business School|Newcastle Business School]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070819051902/http://www.newcastlebusinessschool.co.uk/news-stelios.aspx &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=19 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Cranfield University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/alumni/events/page1489.jsp|title=Cranfield University 2006 - Honorary Graduates|publisher=[[Cranfield University]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071001015804/http://www.cranfield.ac.uk/alumni/events/page1489.jsp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=1 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early career ==
A self-labelled "serial entrepreneur", Stelios started working in 1988 for his father's already successful shipping business, [[Troodos Shipping Co]] Ltd. At 25, Stelios received £30 million from his father, that he used to set up his own shipping company, Stelmar Shipping.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard|last=Morais|title=Proving Papa Wrong|date=19 June 2001|url=https://www.forbes.com/2001/06/19/096.html|work=Forbes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haji-Ioannou floated the company on the NYSE in 2001. In 2005, Stelmar Shipping was sold to the [[Overseas Shipholding Group|OSG Group]] for approximately $1.3 billion.

== Exonerated in shipping accident ==
{{Main article|MT Haven}}
In April 1991, a Troodos-owned VLCC [[oil tanker]] suffered a disaster that resulted in six deaths and spilt about 50,000 tons of crude oil into the sea - arguably the Mediterranean's worst-ever ecological disaster.&lt;ref name="Making it all look easy"&gt;{{cite news|title=Making it all look easy|date=21 April 2002|url=http://observer.guardian.co.uk/comment/story/0,,687834,00.html|work=Guardian Unlimited|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tanker, [[M/T Haven|M/T ''Haven'']], was an elderly vessel, formerly the ''Amoco Haven'', sister ship of the ill-starred [[Amoco Cadiz]] that had foundered in 1978. Haji-Ioannou was accused of poor maintenance and charged, in Italy, with manslaughter and also intimidating and attempting to bribe witnesses. Haji-Ioannou blamed the accident on an error by one of the surviving crew members.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014}}

He and his father were acquitted by the jury. Subsequent civil demands for compensation were also dismissed by the courts.&lt;ref name="Making it all look easy"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BBC Radio 4's On The Ropes|date=7 July 2002|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2002/07_july/07/ontheropes_stelios.shtml|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The "easy" companies ==
{{main article|easyGroup}}
Haji-Ioannou started [[easyJet]] in 1995 when he was 28, running a service between Luton and Scotland. In 2000, easyJet PLC was partially floated on the [[London Stock Exchange]]. He and his family remain its largest single shareholders (34%) in the airline, capitalized at £6.8bn as of 20/08/15.

Haji-Ioannou conducts business via his private investment vehicle, the [[easyGroup]], which owns the 'easy' brand and licenses it to the various 'easy'-branded ventures, including the airline. Haji-Ioannou continues to extend his business interests, mainly in the field of travel and leisure by encouraging entrepreneurs to adopt the "easy" brand for their companies.

easyJet PLC is one of Europe's largest airlines with a fleet of over 240 jets (+150 on order) carrying over 70m passengers annually.

Other travel/leisure-related businesses include:

* [[easyCar]], which offers a peer2peer car sharing scheme as well as low cost car rental in 2,000 locations globally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=J.F.O.|last=McAllister|title=Easy All Over Europe|date=23 July 2001|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1000398,00.html|work =[[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[easyBus]], which offers low cost bus transportation between London/Paris/Geneva airports and their respective city centres&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Livin' On Easy Street|date=8 May 2005|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1059003,00.html|work=[[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[easyHotel]], which offers low cost accommodation in city centres across Europe&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Thomas|last=Grose|title=A Room with No View|date=11 April 2007|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1609075-2,00.html|work=[[Time Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[easyFoodstore]] is a new concept, currently being trialed with a view to offering discounted, "white-label" groceries to low-income and benefit dependent groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london24.com/news/business/stelios_plans_to_set_up_easyjet_style_no_brands_food_store_1_2321729|title=Stelios plans to set up easyJet-style 'no brands' food store - Business|publisher=London24|date=6 August 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150404164535/http://www.london24.com/news/business/stelios_plans_to_set_up_easyjet_style_no_brands_food_store_1_2321729|archivedate=4 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[easyGym]] which offers low cost, no-contract gym memberships in 16 locations in the UK and 5 in France, while looking to expand further inside the EU.
* [[easyProperty]] which offers an on-line service to homeowners and prospective buyers as well landlords and tenants.
* [[easyCruise]] was a low-cost  cruise line started in 2004 by Haji-Ioannou. It was sold in August 2009 to Greek ferry operator Hellenic Seaways for £9 million which ran it till 2010 before being defunct.
* Easycoffee owns a number of self service coffee machines including a cafe in central london.
In [[Birthday Honours 2006|June 2006]], Haji-Ioannou received a [[Knight Bachelor|knighthood]] from [[HM Queen Elizabeth II]] for "services to entrepreneurship".

== Fastjet ==
{{main article|Fastjet}}
In September 2011 it was reported that Haji-Ioannou was working on Fastjet, a new low-cost airline serving routes within Africa, as part of a joint venture with Lonrho plc. The airline started operations on 29 November 2012 with [[Airbus A319]] aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flightglobal.com/news/articles/pan-african-low-cost-carrier-fastjet-launches-scheduled-flights-379587/|title=Pan-African low-cost carrier Fastjet launches scheduled flights|publisher=Flightglobal.com|date=2012-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Battle with Ryanair ==
In 2009, Haji-Ioannou brought proceedings in London's High Court over [[Ryanair]] adverts which appeared in ''[[The Guardian]]'', the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and on Ryanair's website in January and February. The adverts featured a picture of Haji-Ioannou in the style of [[Pinocchio]] and referred to him as "[[easyJet]]'s Mr Late Again". The case was eventually settled out of court, with Haji-Ioannou receiving an official apology from the airline and the sum of £50,100, which Haji-Ioannou announced he would donate to his philanthropic foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/top-stories/2010/07/15/easyjet-founder-stelios-wins-libel-payout-from-ryanair-over-pinocchio-ads-115875-22414818/|title=EasyJet founder Stelios wins libel payout from Ryanair|newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]]|date=15 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== EasyJet Disagreement ==
In 2010, Haji-Ioannou quit the board of EasyJet, in order to attempt to force the management of the company to abort their expansion plans.

In an interview with ''[[Management Today]]'', he said: 'EasyJet is seen as a huge success, which I'm happy about, because I own the brand. But easyJet is a publicly listed company. The share price has gone up and down as it's got bigger and things have happened – but overall, really it's gone sideways.'

He then went on to say: 'Basically, it's created no shareholder value for 10 years.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.managementtoday.co.uk/mt-interview-sir-stelios-haji-ioannou-easyjet/article/1004499|website=Management Today|title=The MT interview: Sir Stelios Haji-Ioannou of easyJet}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Stelios said he had become "increasingly concerned" at easyJet's expansion plans. He announced that he sold 200,000 easyJet shares in protest against plans to buy more planes, while his siblings have done the same with their shares.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/transport/9815704/Sir-Stelios-threatens-to-sell-family-stake-in-fresh-easyJet-row.html|website=Telegraph|title=Sir Stelios threatens to sell family stake in fresh easyJet row|date=2013-01-21|last1=Peacock|first1=Louisa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Residence ==
Haji-Ioannou has been a [[Monaco]] resident since his family left Athens when he was a teenager.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Hajiioannou, Stelios|url=http://www.hellenism.net/cgi-bin/display_celeb.html?c=92|work=Hellenism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Politics and public life ==
Haji-Ioannou was a member of the [[New Enterprise Council]], a group set up to advise the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] on business policy. He stated at the time that this appointment did not reflect his political affiliations, adding "I agreed to be included in the group of entrepreneurs because I was assured it will be non-partisan. [There is] not much difference between Left and Right any more."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marketwatch.com/story/parties-clash-in-corporate-credentials-battle Parties clash in corporate credentials battle] MarketWatch, 15 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 April 2010, in a letter to the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'', Haji-Ioannou joined 23 other UK business leaders, including [[Marks &amp; Spencer]]'s [[Stuart Rose]] and [[Next (clothing)|Next's]] [[Simon Wolfson]], criticising the Labour government's plans to raise [[National Insurance]] contribution rates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/election-2010/7541734/Business-supports-George-Osbornes-national-insurance-cut.html|title=Business supports George Osborne's national insurance cut|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=31 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The character of Omar Baba in the BBC TV comedy ''[[Come Fly with Me (2010 TV series)|Come Fly With Me]]'' is reportedly based on Haji-Ioannou.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/8209821/Come-Fly-With-Me-fasten-your-seatbelts....html|title=Come Fly With Me: fasten your seatbelts|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation finances ten undergraduate scholarships annually for students taking a three-year course at his [[alma mater]], the [[London School of Economics|London School of Economics and Political Science]], and a further ten postgraduate awards at City University's Cass Business School (1-year course). It also gives a £50,000 cash prize to the winner of the Disabled Entrepreneur in the UK Award, run in conjunction with Leonard Cheshire Disability. Similar prizes are awarded for enterprises in Cyprus that help foster inter-communal relationships on the island and Greece where the Foundation hosts an award for young entrepreneurs.

Most recently the Foundation has joined the relief effort aimed at helping those in Greece and Cyprus worst affected by the current economic downturn. Its "Food from the Heart" initiative, based in Limassol, hands out free lunchtime snacks to registered recipients in Nicosia, Limassol and Athens. Further outlets to help cope with the refugees landing on Aegean islands are in the planning stage. (www.stelios.com)

[[File:TIA logo.png|thumb|200px|Logo of Telecommunications Industry Association]]

The '''Telecommunications Industry Association''' ('''TIA''') is accredited by the American National Standards Institute ([[ANSI]]) to develop voluntary, consensus-based industry standards for a wide variety of Information and Communication Technologies ([[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]) products, and currently represents nearly 400 companies. TIA's Standards and Technology Department operates twelve engineering committees, which develop guidelines for private radio equipment, [[cellular tower]]s, [[data terminals]], [[satellites]], telephone terminal equipment, [[accessibility]], VoIP devices, [[structured cabling]], [[data centers]], [[mobile device]] communications, multimedia [[multicast]], vehicular [[telematics]], healthcare ICT, [[Machine to machine|machine to machine communications]], and [[smart grid|smart utility networks]].  

Overall, more than 500 active participants, communications equipment manufacturers, service providers, government agencies, academic institutions, and end-users are engaged in TIA's standards setting process.  To ensure that these standards become incorporated globally, TIA is also engaged in the International Telecommunication Union ([[International Telecommunication Union|ITU]]), the International Organization for Standardization ([[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]]), and the International Electrotechnical Commission ([[International Electrotechnical Commission|IEC]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaonline.org/standards/ TIA standards] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111106042758/http://www.tiaonline.org/standards/ |date=2011-11-06 }} (official site)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Participating in TIA Standards Development==
TIA encourages engineers who represent the manufacturers and/or users of network equipment technology products and services (from both the public and private sectors), to become engaged in TIA's engineering committees, by voting and submitting technical contributions for inclusion in future standards.

==Collaborative Activities==
TIA is a participating standards organization of the ITU-T [[Global Standards Collaboration]] (GSC) initiative.  The GSC has created a [[Machine-to-Machine]] Standardization Task Force (MSTF) to foster industry collaboration on standards across different vertical markets, such as finance, e-health, connected vehicles, and utilities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tiaonline.org/search2.cfm?cx=008376098640550958608%3Aqiqx332xq-k&amp;cof=FORID%3A9&amp;q=MSTF&amp;sa=&amp;siteurl=www.tiaonline.org%2Fstandards%2Fmstf%2Findex.cfm MSTF]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation==
TIA supported the [[E-LABEL Act (H.R. 5161; 113th Congress)]], a bill that would direct the [[Federal Communications Commission]] (FCC) to allow manufacturers of [[electronic devices]] with a screen to display information required by the agency digitally on the screen rather than on a label affixed to the device.&lt;ref name=cbo5161&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO - H.R. 5161|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/45666|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=12 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MarcosHousePasses1&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marcos|first1=Cristina|title=House passes 'E-labeling' bill|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/house/217448-house-passes-e-labeling-bill|accessdate=12 September 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grant Seiffert argued that "by granting device manufacturers the ability to use e-labels, the legislation eases the technical and logistical burdens on manufactures and improves consumer access to important device information."&lt;ref name=HatternIndustryCheers&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hattern|first1=Julian|title=OVERNIGHT TECH: Industry cheers device laws|url=http://thehill.com/policy/technology/overnights/217511-overnight-tech-industry-cheers-device-laws|accessdate=12 September 2014|publisher=The Hill|date=11 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Total shareholder return''' ('''TSR''') (or simply '''total return''') is a [[Measurement|measure]] of the performance of different companies' [[stocks]] and [[shares]] over time. It combines [[share price]] appreciation and [[dividends]] paid to show the total return to the [[shareholder]] expressed as an annualized percentage. It is calculated by the growth in capital from purchasing a share in the company assuming that the dividends are [[reinvested]] each time they are paid. This growth is expressed as a percentage as the [[compound annual growth rate]].

The main benefit of TSR is that it allows the performance of shares to be compared even though some of the shares may have a high growth and low dividends and others may have low growth and high dividends.

Most [[Stock market index|stock market indices]] only use the growth of the prices of the companies making up the index. However, when they use TSR for the companies it is called a [[total return index]] or accumulation index. For example, corresponding to the [[S&amp;P 500]] index calculated by [[Standard and Poor's]], there is the S&amp;P 500 TR index.

In the technology sector, a study has found that regardless of a company's size, the more diverse the portfolio, the more difficult it is to generate high TSR.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=DiGrande|first1=Sebastian|last2=Zajac|first2=Jason|last3=Nolan|first3=Tim|last4=Borno|first4=Ruba|title=Break Up of Shake Up: Get Ready for the Technology Industry Revolution|url=https://www.transactionadvisors.com/insights/break-or-shake-get-ready-technology-industry-revolution|publisher=Transaction Advisors|ISSN=2329-9134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice TSR is difficult to calculate since it involves knowing the price of the shares at the time the dividends are paid. However, as an approximation over one year it can be calculated as follows with:
 
&lt;math&gt;Price_{begin}&lt;/math&gt; = share price at beginning of year,
 
&lt;math&gt;Price_{end}&lt;/math&gt; = share price at end of year,
 
''Dividends'' = dividends paid over year and

''TSR'' = total shareholder return, TSR is computed as

&lt;math&gt;
TSR={(Price_{end} - Price_{begin} + Dividends)}/{Price_{begin}}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Validation''' is the process of establishing documentary evidence demonstrating that a procedure, process, or activity carried out in testing and then production maintains the desired level of compliance at all stages. In the pharmaceutical industry, it is very important that in addition to final testing and compliance of products, it is also assured that the process will consistently produce the expected results.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pharmacistspharmajournal.org/2010/03/validation-in-pharmaceutical.html  Validation definition and FDA, Regulatory agencies guidelines requirement] Accessed 27 Feb 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;  The desired results are established in terms of specifications for outcome of the process. Qualification of systems and equipment is therefore a part of the process of validation. Validation is a requirement of food, drug and pharmaceutical regulating agencies such as the US FDA and their [[good manufacturing practice]]s guidelines. Since a wide variety of procedures, processes, and activities need to be validated, the field of validation is divided into a number of subsections including the following:
*Equipment validation
*Facilities validation
*HVAC system validation
*[[Cleaning validation]]
*[[Process Validation]]
*Analytical method validation
*Computer system validation
*[[Packaging]] validation
*[[Cold chain]] validation

Similarly, the activity of qualifying systems and equipment is divided into a number of subsections including the following:
*Design qualification (DQ)
*Component qualification (CQ)
*Installation qualification (IQ)
*Operational qualification (OQ)
*Performance qualification (PQ)

==History==
The concept of validation was first proposed by two [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) officials, Ted Byers and Bud Loftus, in 1979 in USA, to improve the quality of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Validation: an unconventional review and reinvention | author=Agalloco, J. | journal=Validation: an unconventional review and reinvention | year=1995 | volume=49 | issue=4 | pages=175–179}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was proposed in direct response to several problems in the sterility of large volume [[parenteral]] market.  The first validation activities were focused on the processes involved in making these products, but quickly spread to associated processes including environmental control, media fill, equipment [[Disinfection|sanitization]] and purified water production.

The concept of validation was first developed for equipment and processes and derived from the engineering practices used in delivery of large pieces of equipment that would be manufactured, tested, delivered and accepted according to a contract&lt;ref&gt;Hoffmann, A., Kahny-Simonius, J., Plattner, M., Schmidli-Vckovski, V., &amp; Kronseder, C. (1998), 'Computer system validation: An overview of official requirements and standards', Pharmaceutica Acta Helvetiae, vol. 72, no. 6, pp.&amp;nbsp;317–325.
&lt;/ref&gt;
The use of validation spread to other areas of industry after several large-scale problems highlighted the potential risks in the design of products.  The most notable is the [[Therac-25]] incident.&lt;ref&gt;Leveson, N. G. &amp; Turner, C. S. (1993), 'An investigation of the Therac-25 accidents', Computer, vol. 26, no. 7, pp.&amp;nbsp;18–41.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Here, the software for a large radiotherapy device was poorly designed and tested. In use, several interconnected problems led to several devices giving doses of radiation several thousands of times higher than intended, which resulted in the death of three patients and several more being permanently injured.

In 2005 an individual wrote a standard by which the transportation process could be validated for cold chain products.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}  This standard was written for a biological manufacturing company and was then written into the PDA's Technical Report # 39, thus establishing the industry standard for cold chain validation.  This was critical for the industry due to the sensitivity of drug substances, biologics and vaccines to various temperature conditions.  The FDA has also been very focused on this final area of distribution and the potential for a drug substances quality to be impacted by extreme temperature exposure.

==Reasons for validation==
FDA, or any other food and drugs regulatory agency around the globe not only ask for a product that meets its specification but also require a process, procedures, intermediate stages of inspections, and testing adopted during manufacturing are designed such that when they are adopted they produce consistently similar, reproducible, desired results which meet the quality standard of product being manufactured and Complies the Regulatory and Security Aspects. Such procedures are developed through the process of validation. This is to maintain and assure a higher degree of quality of food and drug products.  
''"process validation is defined as the collection and evaluation of
data, from the process design stage through commercial production, which establishes scientific
evidence that a process is capable of consistently delivering quality product. Process validation
involves a series of activities taking place over the lifecycle of the product and process."''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Guidelines on General Principles of Process Validation | author=FDA | year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; A properly designed system will provide a high degree of assurance that every step, process, and change has been properly evaluated before its implementation. Testing a sample of a final product is not considered sufficient evidence that every product within a batch meets the required specification.

== Validation Master Plan ==

The [[Validation Master Plan]] is a document that describes how and when the validation program will be executed in a facility. Even though it is not mandatory, it is the document that outlines the principles involved in the qualification of a facility, defines the areas and systems to be validated and provides a written program for achieving and maintaining a qualified facility with validated processes. It is the foundation for the validation program and should include process validation, facility and utility qualification and validation, equipment qualification, cleaning and computer validation. The regulations also set out an expectation that the different parts of the production process are well defined and controlled, such that the results of that production will not substantially change over time.

==The validation process==

[[File:Traditional2.png|thumb|'''Figure 1: Traditional Qualification Process (adapted from the typical V-Model''')|375px]]
The validation scope, boundaries and responsibilities for each process or groups of similar processes or similar equipment's must be documented and approved in a validation plan.  These documents, terms and references for the protocol authors are for use in setting the scope of their protocols.  It must be based on a Validation Risk Assessment (VRA) to ensure that the scope of validation being authorised is appropriate for the complexity and importance of the equipment or process under validation.  Within the references given in the VP the protocol authors must ensure that all aspects of the process or equipment under qualification; that may affect the efficacy, quality and or records of the product are properly qualified. Qualification includes the following steps:

*Design qualification (DQ)- Demonstrates that the proposed design (or the existing design for an off-the-shelf item) will satisfy all the requirements that are defined and detailed in the User Requirements Specification (URS).  Satisfactory execution of the DQ is a mandatory requirement before construction (or procurement) of the new design can be authorised.
*Installation qualification (IQ) – Demonstrates that the process or equipment meets all specifications, is installed correctly, and all required components and documentation needed for continued operation are installed and in place.
*Operational qualification (OQ) – Demonstrates that all facets of the process or equipment are operating correctly.
*Performance qualification (PQ) – Demonstrates that the process or equipment performs as intended in a consistent manner over time.
* Component qualification (CQ) – is a relatively new term developed in 2005.  This term refers to the manufacturing of auxiliary components to ensure that they are manufactured to the correct design criteria.  This could include packaging components such as folding cartons, shipping cases, labels or even phase change material.  All of these components must have some type of random inspection to ensure that the third party manufacturer's process is consistently producing components that are used in the world of GMP at drug or biologic manufacturer.

There are instances when it is more expedient and efficient to transfer some tests or inspections from the IQ to the OQ, or from the OQ to the PQ. This is allowed for in the regulations, provided that a clear and approved justification is documented in the Validation Plan (VP).

[[File:OPQ Adaptation of V-Model.png|thumb|'''Figure 2: OPQ Validation Process (adapted from the typical V-Model''')|375px]]
This combined testing of OQ and PQ phases is sanctioned by the European Commission Enterprise Directorate-General within ‘Annex 15  to the EU Guide to Good Manufacturing Practice guide’ (2001, p.&amp;nbsp;6) which states that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''Although PQ is described as a separate activity, it may in some cases be appropriate to perform it in conjunction with OQ.''"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Computer System Validation==
This requirement has naturally expanded to encompass computer systems used both in the development and production of, and as a part of [[pharmaceutical]] products, [[medical devices]], food, blood establishments, tissue establishments, and clinical trials.  In 1983 the FDA published a guide to the inspection of Computerized Systems in Pharmaceutical Processing, also known as the 'bluebook'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Guide to Inspection of Computerised Systems (The Blue Book) | author=FDA | journal=US Food and Drug Administration, Maryland, USA | year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recently both the American FDA and the UK [[Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency]] have added sections to the regulations specifically for the use of computer systems. In the UK, computer validation is covered in Annex 11 of the EU GMP regulations (EMEA 2011). The FDA introduced 21 CFR Part 11 for rules on the use of electronic records, electronic signatures (FDA 1997).
The FDA regulation is harmonized with ISO 8402:1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=ISO 8402:1994: Quality management and quality assurance—Vocabulary | author=International Organization for Standardization, Geneva, Switzerland | year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; which treats "[[Verification and validation|verification]]" and "[[Verification and validation|validation]]" as separate and distinct terms.  On the other hand, many software engineering journal articles and textbooks use the terms "verification" and "validation" interchangeably, or in some cases refer to software "[[Verification and Validation (software)|verification]], validation, and [[Software testing|testing]] ([[VV&amp;T]])" as if it is a single concept, with no distinction among the three terms.
The General Principles of Software Validation (FDA 2002)  defines verification as 
''"Software verification provides objective evidence that the design outputs of a particular phase of the software development life cycle meet all of the specified requirements for that phase."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/MedicalDevices/DeviceRegulationandGuidance/GuidanceDocuments/ucm085371.pdf | title=General Principles of Software Validation; Final Guidance for Industry and FDA Staff | publisher=US FDA | year=2002 | accessdate=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It also defines Validation as
''"Confirmation by examination and provision of objective evidence that software specifications conform to user needs and intended uses, and that the particular requirements implemented through software can be consistently fulfilled"''. The software validation guideline states: “The software development process should be sufficiently well planned, controlled, and documented to detect and correct unexpected results from software changes." Annex 11 states "The validation documentation and reports should cover the relevant steps of the life
cycle."

Weichel (2004) recently found that over twenty warning letters issued by the FDA to pharmaceutical companies specifically cited problems in Computer System Validation between 1997 and 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Survey of Published FDA Warning Letters with Comment on Part 11 (21 CFR Part 11) | author=Weichel, P. | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2004 | volume=11 | issue=1 | pages=62–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably the best known industry guidance available is the GAMP Guide, now in its fifth edition and known as GAMP5 published by ISPE (2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=GAMP5: Risk Based Approach to Computer Compliance | author=ISPE | journal=International Society for Pharmaceutical Engineers, Tampa, FL. | year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This guidance gives practical advice on how to satisfy regulatory requirements.

===Scope of Computer Validation===
The definition of validation above discusses production of evidence that a system will meet its specification.  This definition does not refer to a computer application or a computer system but to a process.  The main implications in this are that validation should cover all aspects of the process including the application, any hardware that the application uses, any interfaces to other systems, the users, training and documentation as well as the management of the system and the validation itself after the system is put into use.  The PIC/S guideline (PIC/S 2004) defines this as a 'computer related system'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Good Practices for Computerised Systems in Regulated "GXP" Environments, Report PI 011-2 | author=PIC/S | journal=Pharmaceutical Inspection Convention, Geneva | year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Much effort is expended within the industry upon validation activities, and several journals are dedicated to both the process and methodology around validation, and the science behind it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Considerations for Improving Software Validation, Securing better assurance for less cost | author=Smith, H. G. | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2001 | volume=7 | issue=2 | pages=150–157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=A Validation Approach for Laboratory Information Management Systems |author1=Tracy, D. S.  |author2=Nash, R. A.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2002 | volume=9 | issue=1 | pages=6–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Testing Times in Computer Validation | author=Lucas, I. | journal=Journal of Validation Technology | year=2003 | volume=9 | issue=2 | pages=153–161}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Taming the Regulatory Beast: Regulation vs Functionalism |author1=Balogh, M.  |author2=Corbin, V.  |lastauthoramp=yes | journal=Pharmaceutical Technology Europe | year=2005 | volume=17 | issue=3 | pages=55–58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Risk Based Approach To Computer Validation===

In the recent years, a risk-based approach has been adopted within the industry, where the testing of computer systems (emphasis on finding problems) is wide-ranging and documented but not heavily evidenced (i.e. hundreds of screen prints are not gathered during testing).  Annex 11 states "Risk management should be applied throughout the lifecycle of the computerised system taking into account patient safety, data integrity and product quality. As part of a risk management system, decisions on the extent of validation and data integrity controls should be based on a justified and documented risk assessment of the computerised system."

The subsequent validation or verification of computer systems targets only the "[[GxP]] critical" requirements of computer systems. Evidence (e.g. screen prints) is gathered to document the validation exercise.  In this way it is assured that systems are thoroughly tested, and that validation and documentation of the "GxP critical" aspects is performed in a risk-based manner, optimizing effort and ensuring that computer system's fitness for purpose is demonstrated.

The overall risk posed by a computer system is now generally considered to be a function of system complexity, patient/product impact, and pedigree (Configurable-Off-The-Shelf or Custom-written for a certain purpose).  A lower risk system should merit a less in-depth specification/testing/validation approach.  (e.g. The documentation surrounding a spreadsheet containing a simple but "GxP" critical calculation should not match that of a Chromatography Data System with 20 Instruments)

Determination of a "GxP critical" requirement for a computer system is subjective, and the definition needs to be tailored to the organisation involved.  However, in general a "GxP" requirement may be considered to be a requirement which leads to the development/configuration of a computer function which has a direct impact on patient safety,
the pharmaceutical product being processed, or has been developed/configured to meet a regulatory requirement. In addition if a function has a direct impact on GxP data (security or integrity) it may be considered "GxP critical".

==Product life cycle approach in validation==
Validation process efforts must account for the complete product life cycle, including developmental procedures adapted for qualification of a drug product commencing with its research and development phase, rationale for adapting a best fit formula which represents the relationship between required outputs and specified inputs, and procedure for manufacturing. Each step is required to be justified and monitored in order to provide a good quality food and drug product. The FDA emphasizes the product life cycle approach in its evaluation of manufacturer regulatory compliance as well.

== Conceptual Framework==

Conceptually, Work 4.0 reflects the current fourth phase of work relations, having been preceded by the birth of industrial society and the first workers' organizations in the late 18th century (Work 1.0), the beginning of mass production and of the welfare state in the late 19th century (Work 2.0), and the advent of [[globalization]], [[digitalization]] and the transformation of the [[social market economy]] since the 1970s (Work 3.0). By contrast, Work 4.0 is characterized by a high degree of integration and cooperation, the use of digital technologies (e.g. the [[internet]]), and a rise in flexible work arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2015). ''Re-Imagining Work: Green Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 33-5.&lt;/ref&gt; Its drivers include [[digitalization]], [[globalization]], [[demographic change]] (ageing, [[Human migration|migration]]), and cultural change.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 18-41.&lt;/ref&gt; Challenges include 
* (i) the transformation of economic sectors and activities and its effect on employment,
* (ii) the creation of new markets and new forms of work through digital platforms,
* (iii) the issues associated with [[Big Data]] (e.g. data protection),
* (iv) the relationship between the use of human and machine labour (upskilling vs. deskilling, devaluation of experience, individual support vs. behavioural monitoring),
* (v) the possibility of flexible work conditions regarding time and location, and 
* (vi) profound changes in the structures of organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 42-91.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to these challenges, the BMAS has developed a "vision for quality jobs in the digital age", based on policies such as moving from [[unemployment insurance|unemployment]] to [[employment insurance]], the promotion of self-determined flexible working time arrangements, improvements in the working conditions of the service sector, new ergonomic approaches to [[occupational health and safety]], high standards in employee [[data protection]], the co-determination and participation of social partners in employment relations, better social protection for self-employed persons, and the beginning of a European dialogue on the future of the welfare state.&lt;ref&gt;Federal Ministry of Labour and Social Affairs of Germany (2017). ''Re-Imagining Work: White Paper Work 4.0'', pp. 98-187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==[[World Bank]] Analysis==
The [[World Development Report]] 2019 argues that a new social contract is needed to address longer work transitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/publication/wdr2019|title=The Changing Nature of Work|access-date=7 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Authors [[Simeon Djankov]] and Federica Saliola documents examples of countries and companies that have created new ways to deliver social insurance.
