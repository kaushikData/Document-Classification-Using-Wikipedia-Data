'''Alcoholic beverage control states''', generally called '''control states''', are 17 states in the [[United States]] that, as of 2016, have state [[Alcohol monopoly|monopoly]] over the wholesaling or retailing of some or all categories of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, such as [[beer]], [[wine]], and [[distilled spirits]].

==History==
{{unreferenced section|date=January 2016}}
At the beginning of the [[temperance movement]] in the United States, many states controlled where and when alcohol could be sold. Before this time, most alcoholic beverages for off-premises consumption were often sold just like any other item of commerce in stores or bars. Because of heavy lobbying by temperance groups in various states, most required off-premises beverages to be sold in dedicated stores (primarily called dispensaries) with [[Three-mile laws|controls over their location]]. To further enhance oversight of beverage sales, some states such as [[South Carolina]] operated state-run dispensaries.

Following [[repeal]] of national [[prohibition]] in the U.S. in 1933, some states initially decided to continue their own prohibition against the production, distribution, and sale of alcoholic beverages within their borders. Other states decided to leave the issue to local jurisdictions, including counties and cities, a practice called [[local option]].

States were also able to restrict the importation of "intoxicating liquors" into their territory under the provisions of the [[Twenty-first Amendment to the United States Constitution]] which, while ending the Federal role in alcohol control, exempted liquor from the constitutional rule reserving the regulation of interstate commerce to the federal government. Thus states which wished to continue prohibition could do so.

[[Image:2008-09-24 ABC Liquors on Hillsborough Rd in Durham.jpg|thumb|right|ABC Store in [[Durham, North Carolina]].]]

Among those states which chose not to maintain complete [[prohibition]] over alcoholic beverages, approximately one-third established government monopolies while the remaining two-thirds established private ''license systems''. In its simplest terms, the license system allows private enterprises to buy and sell alcohol at state discretion. In actual effect, the license operates as a device of restraint and not merely a grant of privilege or freedom. In a constitutional sense, the license confers no property right and the exercise of its privilege is continuously contingent upon the holder’s compliance with required conditions and the general discretion of the licensing authority.

The remaining states adopted the monopoly system of regulation, the more cautious of the two regulatory frameworks. As alluded to above, under the monopoly plan the government takes over the wholesale trade and conducts the retail sale of heavier alcoholic beverages through its own stores. That is, the state itself engages in the sale and distribution of alcoholic beverages. Most of these states have an ''"Alcoholic Beverage Control" (ABC)'' board and run [[liquor store]]s called ''ABC stores''. In all monopoly states a parallel license system is used to regulate the sale and distribution of lighter alcoholic beverages such as [[beer]] and [[wine]].

Beginning in the 1960s onward, many control states loosened their monopoly of beverage sales. States like [[Alcohol laws of West Virginia|West Virginia]] and [[Washington State Liquor Control Board|Washington]] sold all of their state liquor stores to private owners,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018331473_liquor02.html |title=The day liquor went private and prices stumped the public |publisher=[[Seattle Times]] |date=1 June 2012 |accessdate=1 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604033832/http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/localnews/2018331473_liquor02.html |archivedate=June 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while others like [[Vermont]] permit private store owners to sell alcohol on behalf of the state for a commission.

The 17 control or monopoly states {{as of|2015|2|lc=y}} are:
#[[Alabama]] – Liquor stores are state-run or on-premises establishments with a special off-premises license, per the provisions of Title 28, Code of Ala. 1975, carried out by the Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alabamaadministrativecode.state.al.us/docs/abc/index.html |title=Alabama Alcoholic Beverage Control Board |publisher=Alabama Administrative Code |date= |accessdate=2009-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Idaho]] – Maintains a monopoly over sales of beverages with greater than 16% [[Alcohol by volume|ABV]].
#[[Iowa]] – All spirits are sold to privately owned retailers by the [[Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division]]. Beer and wine can be sold by private license-holders.&lt;ref name=IAlaw&gt;{{cite web|url=http://iowaabd.com/|title=Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division|last=Iowa Alcoholic Beverages Division|publisher=State of Iowa|date=n.d.|accessdate=5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Maine]] – State-contracted to private businesses for commission.
#[[Michigan]] – Does not operate retail outlets, but maintains a monopoly over wholesaling of distilled spirits only.
#[[Mississippi]] – State contracted liquor stores.
#[[Montana]] – State contracted liquor stores, modeled after the [[Alberta Gaming and Liquor Commission]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mt.gov/revenue/forbusinesses/liquordistribution/learnaboutliquordistribution.asp |title=Department of Revenue – State of Montana |publisher=State of Montana |date= |accessdate=2009-09-06| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090904223238/http://mt.gov/revenue/forbusinesses/liquordistribution/learnaboutliquordistribution.asp| archivedate=September 4, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[New Hampshire]] – Beer and wine can be sold at supermarkets and convenience stores. Liquor is sold only in state-run liquor stores and a small number of stores with a private Liquor Agency License.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One Private Liquor Store Thrives As State Ponders More|url=http://info.nhpr.org/node/21207|accessdate=27 October 2017|work=New Hampshire Public Radio}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[North Carolina]] – Beer and wine can be sold in supermarkets and convenience stores. Other spirits must be sold in liquor stores owned by local ABC boards. The State ABC Commission controls wholesale distribution and oversees local ABC boards. Prices for bottles of liquor are specified by the North Carolina ABC Commission and are the same throughout the state. The price list is updated quarterly. "Sales" on certain liquors are held monthly, and all ABC outlets in the state use the same special pricing. "Holiday" or "gift" packages, typically released by distillers around [[Thanksgiving]] and [[Christmas]], are sold at the same price as standard bottles of the enclosed liquor, regardless of the included accessories ([[hip flask|flasks]], [[rocks glass]]es, [[shot glass]]es, [[cocktail shaker]]s, etc.)
#[[Ohio]] – Appoints businesses to sell liquor, as agents of the state, for a commission. These stores have a monopoly on sales of beverages with an alcohol content equal to or greater than 21.5% ABV (43 proof).  Beer, wine, mixed alcoholic beverages, and "low proof" alcohol are sold by the aforementioned contract liquor agencies as well as by businesses (bars, restaurants, convenience stores, and gasoline/convenience store retailers) which have been issued an annual permit to sell. Privileges (such as sale for carryout only, or for consumption on the premises) and hours during which sales are allowed are dependent on the terms of the permit.
#[[Oregon]] – Beer and wine can be sold in supermarkets and convenience stores. Other spirits must be sold in liquor stores operated and managed by state-appointed liquor agents who act as independent contractors under the supervision of the [[Oregon Liquor Control Commission]].
#[[Pennsylvania]] – All spirits are sold in [[Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board]] stores, known since the early 2010s as "Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits", which also sell other alcoholic beverages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.finewineandgoodspirits.com/webapp/wcs/stores/servlet/FindStoreView?catalogId=10051&amp;storeId=10051&amp;langId=-1|title=Fine Wine &amp; Good Spirits: Find a Store|publisher=Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|accessdate=November 7, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up to {{convert|3|l|usgal|1}} of wine may be purchased from hotel and restaurant licensees that obtain a permit allowing the sale of wine to go.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcb.pa.gov/Licensing/ResourcesForLicensees/Pages/WineExpandedPermits.aspx|title=Wine Expanded Permits|publisher=Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Malt beverages are sold in case lots by licensed beer retailers known as "distributors", and in smaller quantities by licensed grocery stores, convenience stores, and on-premises establishments. The number of licenses to serve alcohol (including beer and wine) in restaurants is limited based on county populations.&lt;ref name=PLCquota&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcb.pa.gov/Licensing/Topics-of-Interest/Pages/Quota-System.aspx|title=Quota system|publisher=Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board|accessdate=April 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
#[[Utah]] – All beverages over 3.2% ABW (4.0% ABV) are sold in state-run stores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE32A/htm/32A01006.htm |title=Utah Code Section 32A-1-105 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080210085756/http://le.utah.gov/~code/TITLE32A/htm/32A01006.htm |archivedate=February 10, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Vermont]] – Liquor stores are state-contracted and licensed.
#[[Virginia]] – All distilled spirits are sold at state-run Virginia Alcoholic Beverage Control locations, commonly known as ABC stores. Virginia has [[List_of_dry_communities_by_U.S._state#Virginia|ten "moist" counties]] that prohibit the sale of distilled spirits and thus do not have any ABC stores. Beer and wine is sold at licensed supermarkets and convenience stores. ABC stores also carry a small amount of local wine.
#[[West Virginia]] – Does not operate retail outlets, but maintains a monopoly over wholesaling of distilled spirits only.
#[[Wyoming]] – Does not operate retail outlets. Maintains monopoly on wholesale importation. Although licenses are issued by local licensing authorities, all liquor licenses must be approved by the state, and licenses are limited by population density.&lt;ref name=WYlaws&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wyoliquor.org/html/common_questions.htm |title=WSLA common questions |last=WSLA |publisher=Wyoming State Liquor Association |accessdate=18 Feb 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140212185550/http://wyoliquor.org/html/common_questions.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

About one-quarter of the United States population lives in liquor control or government monopoly states.

[[Maryland]] as a whole is not a control state, and private liquor stores sell beer, wine, and spirits in most of the state, but under state law, [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], [[Somerset County, Maryland|Somerset]] and [[Wicomico County, Maryland|Wicomico]] counties are county alcohol-controlled, which mandates that off-premises liquor sales are to be conducted only at county-owned and operated stores. An exception exists in Montgomery County, in that four grocery stores have grandfathered licenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/dlrtmpl.asp?url=%2FContent%2FDLC%2FLiquor%2FRetail%2FFAQs.asp |title=Montgomery County Department of Liquor Control Frequently Asked Questions |access-date=October 8, 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091003220233/http://www.montgomerycountymd.gov/dlrtmpl.asp?url=%2FContent%2FDLC%2FLiquor%2FRetail%2FFAQs.asp |archive-date=October 3, 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dorchester County, Maryland|Dorchester]] County was an alcohol control county until 2008, when the County Council voted to permanently close the county-owned liquor dispensaries, with subsequent change in the state law.&lt;ref name=MD2008SB154&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mgaleg.maryland.gov/webmga/frmMain.aspx?ys=2008rs%2fbillfile%2fSB0154.htm|title=Senate Bill 154|last=Colburn|date=22 May 2008|publisher=State of Maryland|accessdate=18 Feb 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Worcester County, Maryland|Worcester County]] was an alcohol control county until July 2014, when the [[Maryland General Assembly]] abolished the Liquor Control Board by statute, replacing it with the Department of Liquor Control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmarvanow.com/story/news/local/maryland/2014/07/21/worcester-alcohol-sales/12957707/ Delmarvanow.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Andrejeva v. Latvia''''' (55707/00) was a case decided by the Grand Chamber of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2009. It has concerned ''[[ex parte]]'' proceedings and discrimination in calculating retirement pensions for [[Non-citizens (Latvia)|non-citizens of Latvia]].

==Facts==

Ms. N. Andrejeva, a non-citizen of Latvia, was employed at a recycling plant at the Olaine chemical complex, formerly a public body under the authority of the USSR Ministry of Chemical Industry and located in Latvia.

According to the Latvian State Pensions Act, only periods of work in Latvia could be taken into account in calculating the pensions of non-citizens of Latvia, unlike citizens of Latvia.  

As the applicant had been employed from 1973 to 1990 by entities based in Kiev and Moscow, her pension was calculated solely in respect of the time she had worked before and after that period. Latvian courts agreed with the administration. 

Besides, during the proceedings before the Supreme Court of Latvia, N. Andrejeva was unable to take part in the hearing of 6 October 1999 as it had started earlier than scheduled.

==Court's proceedings==

Application was lodged with the Court on 27 February 2000. It was declared partly admissible on 11 July 2006 (meanwhile, the Constitutional Court of Latvia has found the provisions in question constitutional, hearing a case after a complaint by MPs of [[ForHRUL]] and [[LSDSP]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2001/02/2001-02-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf Judgment of the Constitutional Court of Latvia in case No. 2001-02-0106]&lt;/ref&gt;). On 11 December 2007 the Chamber has relinquished the case to the Grand Chamber. The Grand Chamber has held public hearing on 25 June 2008 and delivered its judgment, which was the third Grand Chamber judgment on the merits in a case against Latvia at all, after ''[[Slivenko v. Latvia|Slivenko]]'' and ''[[Tatjana Ždanoka|Ždanoka]]'', on 18 February 2009.

The applicant was represented before the court by [[Vladimirs Buzajevs|V. Buzajevs]] and A. Dimitrovs, members of [[Latvian Human Rights Committee]].

==Judgment concerning Article 6==

The Court has unanimously concluded that the fact N. Andrejeva was unable to take part in the hearing of 6 October 1999 as it had started earlier than scheduled was violating Article 6 of ECHR.

==Judgment concerning Article 14 and Article 1 of the 1st protocol==

Concerning government's objections that "In view of the financial burden borne by Latvia and the limited capacity of its national budget, it was not unreasonable for it to assume full responsibility for the pensions of its own citizens alone" (para. 71) and "the situation complained of was largely the fault of the applicant herself, who had refused to apply for naturalisation despite having been entitled to do so since 1998. The sooner she did so, the sooner she would receive the desired portion of her pension" (para. 72), the Court concluded that Ms. Andrejeva already "has the status of a “permanently resident non-citizen” of Latvia, the only State with which she has any stable legal ties and thus the only State which, objectively, can assume responsibility for her in terms of social security" (para. 88) and that "dismissing the victim's claims on the ground that he or she could have avoided the discrimination by altering one of the factors in question – for example, by acquiring a nationality – would render Article 14 devoid of substance" (para. 91).

The Court accepted that the difference in treatment between non-citizens and citizens pursued at least one legitimate aim that was broadly compatible with the general objectives of the Convention, namely the protection of the country’s economic system. However, it didn't find a “reasonable relationship of proportionality” between the legitimate aim pursued and the means employed. The Court therefore found a violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1, by 16 votes to 1.

===Partly dissenting opinion===

Judge [[Ineta Ziemele]] didn't find violation of Article 14 taken in conjunction with Article 1 of Protocol No. 1 in the case, considering that ''saying or implying that Latvia has some automatic obligations stemming from the Soviet period would defy the fact that the occupation and annexation of Latvia were illegal in international law'' (para. 22., italicized by I. Ziemele).

==Just satisfaction and implementation of the judgment==

N. Andrejeva was awarded 6500 EUR: 5000 EUR in respect of all damage sustained and 1500 EUR in respect of costs and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sim.law.uu.nl/SIM/CaseLaw/hof.nsf/2422ec00f1ace923c1256681002b47f1/3bcb67663658772ac1257563002f70cd?OpenDocument |title=ECHR : Andrejeva v.

In order to implement the judgment, amendments to the State Pensions Act were adopted in the first reading. They foresaw to abolish discrimination by cancelling rights of citizens of Latvia to receive pensions for all time worked in the USSR outside Latvia, so that both citizens and non-citizens would receive pensions for this time only in certains cases. In December, 2009, the deciding on the amendments was postponed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rus.delfi.lv/news/daily/latvia/sejm-otlozhil-popravki-k-zakonu-o-pensiyah.d?id=28580567 {{ru icon}}] [http://www.delfi.lv/news/national/politics/pretrunigie-pensiju-likuma-grozijumi-noguls-saeimas-plauktos.d?id=28577497 {{lv icon}}] [[Delfi (web portal)|DELFI]]&lt;/ref&gt; Those amendments were criticized by the Equal Rights Trust.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equalrightstrust.org/ertdocumentbank/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Latvia%20PisjmoDaudze%20_2_.pdf Letter of the Equal Rights Trust to the Saeima] 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 12, 2009, Mrs. Andrejeva submitted an application to the administrative court, since she was refused to recalculate her pension by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Бузаев В. [http://www.rusojuz.lv/ru/archive/2009/index.php/21012-/ Суд поздравил Наталью Андрееву с днем освобождения Риги]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in April, 2010, while the case on recalculating the pension was still pending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mixnews.lv/ru/society/news/39728_ushla-iz-zhizni-vyigravshaya-v-esp4-delo-protiv-latvii-pensionerka/ Ушла из жизни выигравшая в ЕСПЧ дело против Латвии пенсионерка]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2011, the Constitutional Court of Latvia, upon a complaint of several other non-citizens, found the provisions in question compatible with the provisions of constitution and ECHR.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satv.tiesa.gov.lv/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/2010-20-0106_Spriedums_ENG.pdf Judgment of the Constitutional Court of the Republic of Latvia in Case No. 2010-20-0106]&lt;/ref&gt; In August, 2011, a new application to the ECtHR by the same non-citizens concerning those provisions was registered.&lt;ref&gt;[http://baltija.eu/news/read/19477 Европейский суд по правам человека принял иск неграждан против Латвии]{{ru icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2012, the [[European Commission against Racism and Intolerance]] has published its report on Latvia, noting that "the Constitutional Court's decision, at best, gives a very narrow interpretation of the ECtHR's judgment" and that the approach taken by authorities "fails to address the 'non-citizens', who have worked in the remaining 9 former USSR republics, in respect of which a bilateral agreement has not been signed. This, according to the ECtHR's Andrejeva judgment, amounts to discrimination".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/ecri/Country-by-country/Latvia/LVA-CbC-IV-2012-003-ENG.pdf ECRI Fourth Report on Latvia] Para. 130-131&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the Latvian Human Rights Committee has submitted a communication to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe on the lack of implementation of the judgment, which was responded by the agent of the Latvian government.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wcd.coe.int/com.instranet.InstraServlet?command=com.instranet.CmdBlobGet&amp;InstranetImage=2063047&amp;SecMode=1&amp;DocId=1876714&amp;Usage=2 Communication from a NGO (FIDH Latvian Human Rights Committee) (09/03/12) in the case of Andrejeva against Latvia (Application No. 55707/00) and reply of the government]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Advisory Committee on the [[Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities]] adopted its second opinion on Latvia, stating "Regarding access to pensions, the Advisory Committee regrets that the 2009 Andrejeva Judgment of the European Court on Human Rights has not led to a comprehensive solution regarding the calculation of pensions of citizens and "non-citizens". It notes the Government's view that the judgment has been implemented by signing bilateral agreements with the Russian Federation and a number of other countries in which "non-citizens" spent periods of employment under the Soviet Union, but remains concerned by the fact that these agreements do not cover all former republics of the Soviet Union and are therefore not suitable to address the situation vis-à-vis all "non-citizens". It notes with interest reports of a new case relating to the calculation of pension benefits having been
registered at the European Court of Human Rights following the rejection of the Constitutional Court in February 2011 of the complaints of five "non-citizens" relating to relevant sections of the State Pension Act".&lt;ref&gt;[https://rm.coe.int/168008c1a1 Second Opinion on Latvia] ACFC/OP/II(2013)001 — Para. 139&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement''' ('''ACTA''') was a proposed [[plurilateral agreement|multinational]] [[treaty]] for the purpose of establishing international standards for intellectual property rights enforcement. The agreement aims to establish an international legal framework for targeting [[counterfeit]] goods, [[generic drug|generic]] medicines and [[copyright infringement]] on the Internet, and would create a new governing body outside existing forums, such as the [[World Trade Organization]], the [[World Intellectual Property Organization]], and the [[United Nations]].

The agreement was signed in October 2011 by [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[Japan]], [[Morocco]], [[New Zealand]], [[Singapore]], [[South Korea]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Walsh 2012-02-11"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jason Walsh |title=Europe's Internet revolt: Protesters see threats in antipiracy treaty |date=11 February 2012 |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Europe/2012/0211/Europe-s-Internet-revolt-protesters-see-threats-in-antipiracy-treaty |work=[[The Christian Science Monitor]] |accessdate=9 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Mexico]], the [[European Union]] and 22 countries that are [[member state of the European Union|member states of the European Union]] signed as well.&lt;ref name="Solon 2012-02-22"&gt;{{cite news |author=Olivia Solon |title=The EU signs up to Acta, but French MEP quits in protest |date=26 January 2012 |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-01/26/eu-signs-up-to-acta |work=[[Wired UK]] |accessdate=9 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One signatory (Japan) has [[ratification|ratified]] (formally approved) the agreement, which would come into force in countries that ratified it after ratification by six countries.

Industrial groups with interests in copyright, trademarks and other types of intellectual property said that ACTA was a response to "the increase in global trade of counterfeit goods and pirated copyright protected works". Organizations such as the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] and [[International Trademark Association]] are understood to have had a significant influence over the ACTA agenda.&lt;ref name="Horten 2013"&gt;{{citation  |author=Monica Horten |title= A Copyright Masquerade - How Corporate Lobbying Threatens Online Freedoms |pages= 41–65|url= http://www.zedbooks.co.uk/paperback/a-copyright-masquerade}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement#Criticism|Organisations representing citizens and non-governmental interests]] argued that ACTA could infringe fundamental rights including [[freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and [[Internet privacy|privacy]]. ACTA has also been criticised by [[Doctors Without Borders]] for endangering access to medicines in [[developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/MSF_assets/Access/Docs/Access_Briefing_ACTABlankCheque_ENG_2012.pdf |title=A Blank Cheque For Abuse — The Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) and its Impact on Access to Medicines |format=PDF |date=February 2012 |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] |accessdate=3 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The secret nature of negotiations has excluded [[non-governmental organization|civil society groups]], developing countries and the [[public|general public]] from the agreement's negotiation process and it has been described as [[policy laundering]] by critics including the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] and the [[Entertainment Consumers Association]].

The signature of the EU and many of its member states resulted in widespread protests across Europe. [[European Parliament]] [[rapporteur]] [[Kader Arif]] resigned. His replacement, British MEP [[David Martin (Scottish politician)|David Martin]], recommended that the Parliament should reject ACTA, stating: "The intended benefits of this international agreement are far outweighed by the potential threats to civil liberties". On 4 July 2012, the European Parliament declined its consent, effectively rejecting it, 478 votes to 39, with 165 abstentions.&lt;ref name="Monica Horten"&gt;{{cite news |author= Monica Horten |title=Wow what a scorcher!

==Negotiations==
Negotiations for the ACTA treaty are not part of any international body.&lt;ref name="med.govt.nz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____34357.aspx |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716072750/http://www.med.govt.nz/templates/ContentTopicSummary____34357.aspx |archivedate=16 July 2011 |title=On Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement |author=Ministry of Economic Development of New Zealand |authorlink=Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand) |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ACTA was first developed by Japan and the United States in 2006. Canada, the [[European Union]] (represented in the negotiations by the [[European Commission]], the [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|EU Presidency]] and [[Member state of the European Union|EU Member States]])&lt;ref name="Jointstatement"/&gt; and Switzerland joined the preliminary talks throughout 2006 and 2007. Official negotiations began in June 2008, with Australia, Mexico, Morocco, New Zealand, the Republic of Korea and Singapore joining the talks. The [[Senate of Mexico]] voted unanimously to withdraw [[Mexico]] from ACTA negotiations on 30 September 2010.&lt;ref name="Masnick 2010-10-06"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mike |last=Masnick |title=Mexican Senate Unanimously Votes To Remove Mexico From ACTA Negotiations |date=6 October 2010 |url=http://www.techdirt.com/articles/20101005/17320811304/mexican-senate-unanimously-votes-to-remove-mexico-from-acta-negotations.shtml |work=[[Techdirt]] |accessdate=5 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation mandates and positions===

====European Union====
A draft Report from 26 August 2008 by the [[European Commission]] tried to establish a mandate from the [[European Parliament]] for the negotiation of ACTA.&lt;ref name="europarl-report-susta"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gianluca Susta |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=COMPARL&amp;mode=XML&amp;language=EN&amp;reference=PE405.983 |title=Draft Report on the impact of counterfeiting on international trade |publisher=European Parliament's Committee on International Trade |date=26 August 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 September 2008 the [[Council of the European Union]] adopted a resolution in support of ACTA.&lt;ref name="council-26-sep-2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.consilium.europa.eu/ueDocs/cms_Data/docs/pressData/en/intm/103037.pdf |title=Council Resolution on a comprehensive European anti-counterfeiting plan |format=PDF |publisher=[[Council of the European Union]] |date=25 September 2008 |author=Presidency of the Council }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2008 the European Commission described ACTA as an attempt to enforce intellectual property rights and states that countries involved in the negotiations see intellectual property rights as "a key instrument for their development and innovation policies". It argues:

{{Cquote|''The proliferation of intellectual property rights ''(IPR)'' infringements poses an ever-increasing threat to the [[sustainable development]] of the world economy. It is a problem with serious economic and social consequences. Today, we face a number of new challenges: the increase of dangerous counterfeit goods (pharmaceuticals, food and drink, cosmetics or toys, car parts); the speed and ease of digital reproduction; the growing importance of the Internet as a means of distribution; and the sophistication and resources of international counterfeiters. All these factors have made the problem more pervasive and harder to tackle''.|&lt;ref name="ec-fact-sheet-nov2008"/&gt;}}

In March 2010, a leaked draft negotiation text showed that the European Commission had proposed language in ACTA to require criminal penalties for "inciting, aiding and abetting" certain offenses, including "at least in cases of willful trademark counterfeiting and copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU proposes ACTA require criminal sanctions for inciting, aiding and abetting infringements |publisher=[[Knowledge Ecology International]] |url=http://keionline.org/node/806 |date=17 March 2010 |accessdate=19 March 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322191648/http://keionline.org/node/806 |archivedate=22 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a report published on 11 March 2009, the European Parliament called on the European Commission to "immediately make all documents related to the ongoing international negotiations on the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) publicly available".&lt;ref name="EP transparency resolution"&gt;{{cite web |title=European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2010 on the transparency and state of play of the ACTA negotiations |publisher=[[European Parliament]] |date=10 March 2010 |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2010-0058&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=P7-RC-2010-0154 |accessdate=13 June 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100722060547/http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2010-0058&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=P7-RC-2010-0154 |archivedate=22 July 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''European Parliament resolution of 10 March 2010 on the transparency and state of play of the ACTA negotiations'' stated that "according to documents leaked, the ACTA negotiations touch on, among other things, pending EU legislation regarding the enforcement of IPRs (COD/2005/0127 – Criminal measures aimed at assuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights ([[Proposed directive on criminal measures aimed at ensuring the enforcement of intellectual property rights|IPRED-II]])) and the so-called "[[Telecoms Package]]" and on existing EU legislation regarding e-commerce and data protection." The resolution furthermore states, "whereas the ongoing EU efforts to harmonise IPR enforcement measures should not be circumvented by trade negotiations that are outside the scope of normal EU decision-making processes." Also, that the enforcement of intellectual property rights (IPRs), including patent, trademark, and copyright law, must be "accomplished in a manner that does not impede innovation or competition, undermine IPR limitations and personal data protection, restrict the free flow of information or unduly burden legitimate trade."&lt;ref name="EP transparency resolution"/&gt;

The resolution called for the European Commission and the European Council to "grant public and parliamentary access to ACTA negotiation texts and summaries, in accordance with" the Lisbon Treaty and "Regulation 1049/2001 of 30 May 2001 regarding public access to European Parliament, Council and Commission documents." In the resolution, the European Parliament "deplores the calculated choice of the parties not to negotiate through well-established international bodies, such as WIPO and WTO, which have established frameworks for public information and consultation". The European Parliament asserted that under the [[Treaty of Lisbon]] the European Commission needed to provide "immediate and full information" to the European Parliament on international treaties, such as ACTA. The resolution also "stresses that, unless Parliament is immediately and fully informed at all stages of the negotiations, it reserves its right to take suitable action, including bringing a case before the Court of Justice in order to safeguard its prerogatives".&lt;ref name="EP transparency resolution"/&gt;

==Signatures and ratifications==
As of 26 December 2014, the treaty was signed -but not all ratified- by 31 states as well as the European Union. Japan was on 4 October 2012 the first to ratify the treaty.&lt;ref name=ratification&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mofa.go.jp/policy/economy/i_property/acta_conclusion_1210.html|title=Conclusion of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) by Japan|accessdate=6 October 2012|date=5 October 2012|work=Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Japan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The treaty is according to Article 39 open for signature until 1 May 2013 for the participants involved in the negotiations as well as all members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) of which the participants agree. It enters into force after subsequent ratification by six states (Article 40). After 1 May 2013, WTO members that did not sign, may accede to the convention after approval by the ACTA committee (Article 43).

A signing ceremony was held on 1 October 2011 in Tokyo, with the United States, Australia, Canada, Japan, Morocco, New Zealand, Singapore, and South Korea signing the treaty. The European Union, Mexico, and Switzerland attended but did not sign, professing support and saying they will do so in the future&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ustr.gov/about-us/press-office/press-releases/2011/october/joint-press-statement-anti-counterfeiting-trade-ag |work=Office of the United States Trade Representative |year=2011 |title=Joint Press Statement of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement Negotiating Parties}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/01/uk-japan-trade-counterfeiting-idUKTRE79018620111001 |title=Anti-counterfeiting agreement signed in Tokyo |work=[[Reuters]] |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the European Union and 22 of its member states did so in January 2012).

===European Union===
The European Union and [[member state of the European Union|its 28 Member States]] share competency on the subject of this convention. This means that entry into force on its territory requires ratification (or accession) by all states, as well as approval of the European Union.&lt;ref name=ZDNetUK/&gt; Approval of the European Union involves consent of the [[European Parliament]] as well as the [[Council of the European Union|Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ACTA — Anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement |url=http://ec.europa.eu/trade/creating-opportunities/trade-topics/intellectual-property/anti-counterfeiting/ |date=2 February 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2012 |publisher=[[European Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 January 2012, the European Union and 22 Member States signed the treaty in Tokyo.

When Poland announced its intentions to sign the treaty on 18 January 2012,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mkidn.gov.pl/media/docs/20120118-wniosek_ACTA.pdf |publisher=[[Ministry of Culture and National Heritage (Poland)|Polish Ministry of Culture and National Heritage]] |title=Letter regarding Signature |language=Polish |date=16 January 2012 |accessdate=3 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of Polish government websites, including those of the President and [[National Assembly of the Republic of Poland|Polish Parliament]], were shut down by denial of service attacks that started 21 January, akin to [[protests against SOPA and PIPA]] that had happened two days previously.&lt;ref name="polskie"&gt;{{cite news |title=UK Japan Trade Counterfeiting |url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/2011/10/01/uk-japan-trade-counterfeiting-idUKTRE79018620111001 |date=1 October 2011 |accessdate=22 January 2012 |work=[[Reuters]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="polskiase"/&gt; Notwithstanding the ongoing protests, the Polish ambassador to Japan signed the treaty.&lt;ref name="26 Jan POL"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rt.com/news/acta-poland-internet-government-745/ |title=ACTA action: Poland signs up to 'censorship' as 20,000 rage |work=[[Russia Today]] |date=24 January 2012 |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 February 2012, the European Commission asked the [[European Court of Justice]] to assess whether the ACTA agreement violates the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|EU's fundamental human rights and freedoms]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=MEMO/12/128|title=Statement by Commissioner Karel De Gucht on ACTA (Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement) |accessdate=11 March 2012 |date=22 February 2012 |publisher=[[European Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; thereby resulting in delay for the ratification process in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Europe delays vote on anti-piracy law in face of protests |url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/article/1134958--europe-delays-vote-on-anti-piracy-law-in-face-of-protests |date=22 February 2012 |work=[[The Toronto Star]] |accessdate=11 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Committee on International Trade|INTA]], the International Trade Committee of the European Parliament, in view of its exclusion from the negotiations, the secrecy of the negotiations, and the recent protests, moved to have its vote on the ratification take place in June or July 2012 as planned, in spite of the European Commission's objections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.zdnet.co.uk/news/regulation/2012/03/28/acta-to-see-euro-vote-in-june-as-delay-averted-40154905/ |date=28 March 2012 |accessdate=8 April 2012 |author=David Meyer |work=[[ZDNet]] UK |title=ACTA to see Euro vote in June as delay averted}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 May 2012, [[European Commissioner for Digital Agenda]] [[Neelie Kroes]] suggested in a speech in Berlin that ACTA would not come into force and welcomed openness in negotiations:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[ABC News]] |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory/eu-official-acta-law-16277540#.T6QNQL933Lc |title=EU Official: ACTA unlikely to become law |date=4 May 2012 |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 May 2012 the [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Dutch House of Representatives]] in two non-binding resolutions called upon the Dutch government not to sign ACTA and not to submit it to the House for ratification. In addition it requested the government not to vote in favor of similar treaties in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tweedekamer.nl/kamerstukken/verslagen/verslag.jsp?vj=2011-2012&amp;nr=88 |title=Record of the proceedings of the Dutch House of Representatives |date=29 May 2012 |publisher=[[House of Representatives of the Netherlands]] |accessdate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Commission confirmed on 20 December 2012 that it was withdrawing Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) referral to the Court of Justice of the European Union (EU). This ended ACTA’s process at EU level and confirms rejection of the treaty by the EU.{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}

====European Parliament====
On 26 January 2012, after the signing of 22 European Member States [[Kader Arif]], the European Parliament's [[rapporteur]] for ACTA, resigned, saying "I want to send a strong signal and alert the public opinion about this unacceptable situation. I will not take part in this masquerade.".&lt;ref name="Masnick 26 January 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson 27 January 2012" /&gt; He was replaced by [[David Martin (Scottish politician)|David Martin]].

On 12 April 2012, David Martin recommended that the European Parliament should reject ACTA, saying the intended benefits were far outweighed by the risks, and "given the vagueness of certain aspects of the text and the uncertainty over its interpretation, the European Parliament cannot guarantee adequate protection for citizens' rights in the future under ACTA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU rapporteur's draft recommendation |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?pubRef=-//EP//NONSGML%2BCOMPARL%2BPE-486.174%2B02%2BDOC%2BPDF%2BV0//EN |format=PDF |publisher=[[European Parliament]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-17728045 |title=Euro MP David Martin dismisses anti-counterfeiting treaty |accessdate=4 May 2012 |date=16 April 2012 |work=[[BBC News Online]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These recommendations of the top 4 committees served as advice for the [[Committee on International Trade|International Trade Committee]], the lead committee on ACTA. On 21 June 2012, this committee recommended 19–12 that the EP reject the treaty.

===United States===
It has been reported that the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR) has stated they will not use the [[fast track (trade)|fast track negotiating authority]] (Trade Promotion Authority) to implement ACTA, but the form of a "sole [[executive agreement]]" instead.&lt;ref name="katz-hinze"&gt;{{Cite journal|authors=Eddan Katz and Gwen Hinze |title=The Impact of the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement on the Knowledge Economy: The Accountability of the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative for the Creation of IP Enforcement Norms through Executive Trade Agreements |url=http://www.yjil.org/docs/pub/o-35-katz-hinze-ACTA-on-knowledge-economy.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227154801/http://www.yjil.org/docs/pub/o-35-katz-hinze-ACTA-on-knowledge-economy.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-02-27 |format=PDF |accessdate=30 January 2012 |date=November 2009 |journal=[[Yale Journal of International Law]] |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; While on 6 March 2012 [[Legal Adviser of the Department of State]] [[Harold Hongju Koh|Harold Koh]] refused to back USTR's theory that it could enter any agreement that does not change U.S. law (but binds [[United States Congress|Congress]] not to change it) without Congressional consent, Koh described ACTA as a "congressional-executive agreement" that Congress approved of ''{{lang|la|[[ex-ante]]}}'', citing the [[PRO-IP Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Wyden Amendment Needed to Challenge Dubious ACTA Justification |author=Sean Flynn |work=infojustice.org |url=http://infojustice.org/archives/9072 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This proposed method of adoption has encountered criticism in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sen.

==ACTA committee==
ACTA establishes the ''ACTA committee'' in Article 36 as its own governing body outside existing international institutions such as the World Trade Organization (WTO), the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) or the United Nations.&lt;ref name="ec-fact-sheet-nov2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Pilieci&gt;{{Cite news|author=Vito Pilieci |title=Copyright deal could toughen rules governing info on iPods, computers |work=[[Vancouver Sun]] |date=26 May 2008 |accessdate=27 May 2008 |url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=ae997868-220b-4dae-bf4f-47f6fc96ce5e&amp;p=1 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080601022602/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=ae997868-220b-4dae-bf4f-47f6fc96ce5e&amp;p=1 |archivedate=1 June 2008 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; With regards to the reason for not pursuing ACTA through the [[G8]], WTO, WIPO or other formal existing structures the [[European Commission]] explains that a free-standing agreement provides the most flexibility "to pursue this project among interested countries", while stating that "the membership and priorities of those organizations (G8, WTO, and WIPO) simply are not the most conducive to this kind of path breaking project."&lt;ref name="ec-fact-sheet-nov2008"/&gt;

==Treaty content==
The finalized agreement text&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement |url=http://www.international.gc.ca/trade-agreements-accords-commerciaux/topics-domaines/ip-pi/acta-text-acrc.aspx?lang=eng |date=15 April 2012 |accessdate=16 October 2012 |format=PDF |publisher=[[Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade|Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; was published on 15 April 2011 and includes six chapters with 45 articles:

===Chapter I: Initial Provisions and General Definitions===
This Chapter describes the scope of the agreement as well as relations to other agreements. It asserts that obligations from other agreements still exist with entry into force of this agreement (Article 1) and that the agreement applies only those intellectual property rights existing in the country applying the treaty (Article 3). Countries may impose stricter measures than the treaty requires (Article 2) and should share (confidential) information for law enforcement purposes (Article 4). The treaty explicitly also applies to [[free economic zone|free zones]] (Article 5).

===Chapter II: Legal Framework For Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights===
The legal framework set out in Chapter II is divided in five sections.

====Section 1: General Obligations with Respect to Enforcement====
General obligations are requirements to implement the provisions in law, to have fair procedure as well as "[[Proportionality (law)|proportionality]] between the seriousness of the infringement, the interests of third parties, and the applicable measures, remedies and penalties" (Article 6).

====Section 2: Civil Enforcement====
The sections provides that rights holders have access to [[Civil law (disambiguation)|civil]] or (if they exist) administrative procedures (Article 7) and to have the possibility for judges "to issue an order against a party to desist from an infringement" (Article 8). They may also require in civil procedure pirated copyright goods and counterfeit trademark goods to be destroyed (Article 10). According to Article 11, they may ask (alleged) infringers to provide information on the goods it "controls". Article 9 states that a Party's judicial authorities ''may'' consider ''{{lang|la|[[inter alia]]}}'' any legitimate measure of value submitted by a rights holder, including lost profits, the value of infringed property as per market price, or the [[suggested retail price]]. This clause has received considerable criticism for its validity, as well as its similarity to previously controversial attempts at establishing precedent to the same effect. According to the [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]], the principle does not "reflect the economic loss suffered by the right holder".&lt;ref name="Baker 4 April 2011"&gt;{{cite news |author=Jennifer Baker |title=ACTA Text Hurts Startups, Goes Beyond EU Law, Says FFII |date=4 April 2011 |publisher=[[PCWorld (magazine)|PCWorld]] |url=https://www.pcworld.com/article/227048/acta_text_hurts_startups_goes_beyond_eu_law_says_ffii.html |work=IDG News |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FFII analysis" /&gt; In a ''[[Business Line]]'' [[opinion piece]], a professor from the [[Indian Institute of Foreign Trade]]'s Centre for WTO Studies also explained that it would lead to "excess valuation" in infringement suits.&lt;ref name='Sinha'&gt;{{cite news |author=Madhukar Sinha |title=IPR rules and their uncertain effects |date=2 June 2011 |url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/opinion/article2068519.ece |work=[[Business Line]] |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Section 3: Border Measures====
At borders, officials may act on suspect goods on their own initiative or upon request of a "rights holder". For goods in transit, the requirements do not have to be enacted by a state (Article 16). "Small consignment" for commercial use are included in the border provisions, while "goods of a non-commercial nature contained in travellers’ personal luggage" are excluded from the scope (Article 14).

====Section 4: Criminal Enforcement====
Section 4 of ACTA deals with the criminal enforcement of IPRS according to Professor Michael Blakeney. The primary focus of the section (in Article 23) is the criminalisation of wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale.

=====Article 23: Criminal Offences=====
At least "wilful trademark counterfeiting or copyright or related rights piracy on a commercial scale" should be punishable under [[criminal law]].

According to European Digital Rights, the article "provides an extremely low threshold" when considering that the scope includes "acts" and because consequences for infringement can include criminal penalties.&lt;ref name="EDRi criminal sanctions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_2_20120117.pdf |title=ACTA – Criminal sanctions |accessdate=5 February 2012 |date=17 January 2012 |publisher=[[European Digital Rights]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65DmRnRob?url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_2_20120117.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; EDRi also outlines an absence of definitions for associated constructs, such as "aiding and abetting", "commercial scale", and "economic advantage", which it describes as "simply inappropriate in a key provision, on whose meaning the proportionality and the legality, of the Agreement rests".&lt;ref name="EDRi criminal sanctions"/&gt;

=====Article 24: Penalties=====
Penalties that Parties should have in their criminal system should "include imprisonment as well as monetary fines", which are sufficiently high for discouragement of actions forbidden under the treaty.

====Section 5: Enforcement of Intellectual Property Rights in the Digital Environment====

=====Article 27: Enforcement in the Digital Environment=====
In the digital environment, also Civil and Criminal enforcement should be available "to permit effective action against an act of infringement of intellectual property rights that takes place in the digital environment" (Article 27, paragraph 1). Furthermore, infringement over digital networks (''possibly'' including "the unlawful use of means of widespread distribution for infringing purposes") should be enforced in a manner, which "preserves fundamental principles such as freedom of expression, fair process, and privacy" (Paragraph 2). Against circumvention of systems to prevent copying measures should be implemented (Paragraph 6).

Critics of this article, such as the [[European Digital Rights]], have raised concerns that its emphasis on the role of corporations in enforcement "promotes the policing and even punishment of alleged infringements [[extrajudicial punishment|outside normal judicial frameworks]]", while failing to "ensure effective remedies against such interferences with fundamental rights" despite "vague references to 'fair process' in the text [that] are not backed up by mandatory processes requiring respect for the Rule of Law" in Article 21 of the European Union's [[Maastricht Treaty]].&lt;ref name="EDRi fundamental rights"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_1_20120116.pdf |title=ACTA and its impact on fundamental rights |accessdate=5 February 2012 |date=16 January 2012 |format=PDF |publisher=[[European Digital Rights]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65DjZsK8f?url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_1_20120116.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EDRi international relations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_4_20120119.pdf |title=The impact of the ACTA on the EU's international relations |accessdate=5 February 2012 |publisher=[[European Digital Rights]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65DnN9Y2g?url=http://www.edri.org/files/EDRI_acta_series_4_20120119.pdf |archivedate=5 February 2012 |quote=The preamble of ACTA, as well as the 'Digital Chapter' specifically promotes policing and enforcement through 'cooperation' between private companies. This is an obvious violation of Article 21 of the TEU, which re-states the EU's obligation to support democracy and the rule of law in its international relations. |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chapter III: Enforcement Practices===

====Article 28: Enforcement Expertise, Information, and Domestic Coordination====

Parties are expected to cultivate expertise within agencies tasked with enforcing intellectual property rights, promote internal coordination, and facilitate joint actions. They are also compelled to collect and utilize statistical data, as well as "other relevant information concerning intellectual property rights infringements", to prevent and combat infringement as necessary. The article also indicates that parties shall "endeavour to promote, where appropriate, the establishment and maintenance of formal or informal mechanisms, such as advisory groups, whereby [their] competent authorities may receive the views of right holders and other relevant stakeholders."

====Article 29: Management of Risk at Border====

Parties may consult stakeholders or the intellectual property authorities of another party to identify and mitigate risks. Information, including but not limited to information that assists in identifying and targeting suspicious shipments, may be shared between parties for the purposes of border enforcement. Should an importing party seize infringing goods, it may supply such information to assist an exporting party in pursuing infringers.

===Chapter IV: International Cooperation===
Chapter V contains three articles:

* Article 33: International Cooperation
* Article 34: Information Sharing
* Article 35: Capacity Building and Technical Assistance

===Chapter V: Institutional Arrangements===
In Article 36, the '''ACTA committee''' is established as governing body of the treaty in which all parties are represented. The body is not involved in individual cases, but monitors implementation, can formally propose changes to the convention (on the suggestion of a Party) and decides on the admittance of WTO-members that were not present at the negotiations. The committee decides by consensus. Parties establish a contact point (Article 37) that acts as a primary contact with regards to the execution of the treaty and are required to "shall accord sympathetic consideration" to requests for cooperation on matters regarding the convention (Article 38).

===Chapter VI: Final Provisions===
Chapter VI is the treaty's last chapter. It outlines principles and procedures regarding the treaty's status and execution.

====Article 39: Signature====

The article specifies that the agreement remains open for signature until 1 May 2013 by its negotiators, as well as any other [[World Trade Organization#Members and observers|World Trade Organization member]] that the negotiators support by consensus.

====Article 40: Entry into Force====

Conditions necessary for the treaty to become effective are defined, which include six parties submitting instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval to the [[depositary]], as well as a thirty-day interim waiting period.

====Article 41: Withdrawal====

The process for withdrawal is outlined, which entails a party submitting written notification to the depositary and becomes effective 180 days after receipt.&lt;ref name="Article 41"&gt;[[Wikisource:Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement#ARTICLE 41: WITHDRAWAL|Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, Article 41]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ATNIF 2011"/&gt; This process would also be subject to various national guidelines.&lt;ref name="ATNIF 2011"/&gt;

====Article 42: Amendments====

Parties may submit proposed amendments to the Committee for review, which would then determine whether or not the proposed amendment should be presented for potential ratification, acceptance, or approval. Successful amendments would become effective 90 days after all parties have provided their respective instruments of ratification, acceptance, or approval to the depositary.&lt;ref name="ATNIF 2011"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement: Australian Treaty National Interest Analysis |page=7 |year=2011 |url=http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jsct/21november2011/treaties/anti_counterfeiting_nia.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215045642/http://www.aph.gov.au/house/committee/jsct/21november2011/treaties/anti_counterfeiting_nia.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-02-15 |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Wikisource:Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement#ARTICLE 42: AMENDMENTS|Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, Article 42]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a report to the Australian Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, [[Kimberlee Weatherall]], an associate professor at the [[University of Queensland]], assessed the article in saying "it might be argued that the text of ACTA could be fleshed out through guidelines on an ongoing basis, with possible amendments in the longer term."&lt;ref name='Weatherall'&gt;{{Cite book |contribution=Submission of Associate Professor Kimberlee Weatherall |title=Joint Standing Committee on Treaties Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement |editor=Kimberlee Weatherall |publisher=Berkeley Electronic Press |place=Sydney |page=17 |date=27 January 2012| id=|contribution-url=http://works.bepress.com/kimweatherall/26/ |postscript=. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Citing the relationship with Article 33, she added that "it might further be argued that the exhortations to 'promote cooperation, where appropriate, among [the Parties'] competent authorities', particularly in conjunction with the existence of regular meetings and exchange of information about enforcement practices, creates the basic framework within which more detailed mechanisms can be developed over time".&lt;ref name='Weatherall'/&gt;

====Article 43: Accession====

After the date in Article 39 passes, any WTO member nation may seek to accede into the agreement. The terms of acceptance would be decided by the Committee on an individual, case-by-case basis. The treaty would enter into force for successful applicants thirty days after receipt of its instrument by the depositary.

====Article 44: Texts of the Agreement====

The treaty makes equally authoritative English, French and Spanish versions of the text, which for the purposes of signature are part of a single document.

====Article 45: Depositary====

Article 45 is the final text of the treaty. It elects the [[Government of Japan]] as [[depositary]].

In June 2008, Canadian academic [[Michael Geist]], writing for ''Copyright News'', argued that "Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy", noting that before documents leaked on the Internet, ACTA was shrouded in secrecy. Coverage of the documents by the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' "sparked widespread opposition as Canadians worry about the prospect of a trade deal that could lead to invasive searches of personal computers and increased surveillance of online activities". Geist argued that public disclosure of the draft ACTA treaty "might put an end to fears about [[iPod]]-searching border guards" and that it "could focus attention on other key concerns including greater Internet service provider filtering of content, heightened liability for websites that link to allegedly infringing content, and diminished privacy for Internet users". Geist also argued that greater transparency would lead to a more inclusive process, highlighting that the ACTA negotiations have excluded both civil society groups as well as developing countries. Geist reported that "reports suggest that trade negotiators have been required to sign non-disclosure agreements for fear of word of the treaty's provisions leaking to the public". He argued that there is a need for "cooperation from all stakeholders to battle counterfeiting concerns" and that "an effective strategy requires broader participation and regular mechanisms for feedback".&lt;ref name="liftveil"&gt;{{cite web |author=Michael Geist |title=Government Should Lift Veil on ACTA Secrecy |url=http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3013/135/ |date=9 June 2008 |accessdate=28 November 2008 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081205070642/http://www.michaelgeist.ca/content/view/3013/135/ |archivedate=5 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2008, the European Commission responded to these allegations as follows:

{{Cquote|''It is alleged that the negotiations are undertaken under a veil of secrecy. This is not correct. For reasons of efficiency, it is only natural that intergovernmental negotiations dealing with issues that have an economic impact, do not take place in public and that negotiators are bound by a certain level of discretion. However, there has never been any intention to hide the fact that negotiations took place, or to conceal the ultimate objectives of the negotiations, the positions taken in European Commission Trade 5/6 the negotiations or even details on when and where these negotiations are taking place.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;The EU and other partners (US, Japan, Canada, etc.) announced their intention to start negotiations of ACTA on 23 October 2007, in well publicised press releases. Since then we have talked about ACTA on dozens of occasions, including at the European Parliament (INTA committee meetings), and in numerous well-attended seminars. Commission organised a stakeholders' consultation meeting on 23 June in Brussels, open to all&amp;nbsp;– industry and citizens and attended by more than 100 participants. US, Australia, Canada, New Zealand and other ACTA partners did the same''.|&lt;ref name="ec-fact-sheet-nov2008"/&gt;}}

As another indicator of the way that the ACTA process was handled by the EU, the Council of Ministers officially adopted ACTA at a meeting of the Fisheries Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iptegrity.com/index.php/acta/726-eu-council-gives-fishy-go-ahead-for-acta|title=EU Council gives fishy go-ahead for ACTA |work=Iptegrity.com |date=18 December 2011 |accessdate=17 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To coincide with the negotiation round [[InternetNZ]], a nonprofit organisation, held a ''PublicACTA'' event on 10 April 2010 to discuss the known and likely content of the ACTA draft agreement and to develop a statement on ACTA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/internetnz-launches-anti-acta-petition-121331 |title= InternetNZ launches petition to limit ACTA |work=[[National Business Review]] |date=12 April 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2010 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100602123319/http://www.nbr.co.nz/article/internetnz-launches-anti-acta-petition-121331 |archivedate= 2 June 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the event, the ''Wellington Declaration'' was developed by over 100 participants, and was published the following day along with a petition for its endorsement. By 13 April, it had received 6,645 signatures. The Wellington Declaration and the petition was given to the [[government of New Zealand]], which delivered the Declaration to the other negotiating countries.&lt;ref name=WellingtonDeclaration&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publicacta.org.nz/wellington-declaration// |title=The Wellington Declaration |accessdate=16 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814164925/http://publicacta.org.nz/wellington-declaration// |archivedate=14 August 2010 |deadurl=unfit }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Threats to freedom and human rights===
[[File:ACTA Der Big Bang der Netzpolitik WMDE iRights.pdf|thumb|Booklet criticizing the treaty]]
An open letter signed by many organizations, including [[Consumers International]], [[European Digital Rights]] (EDRi, an [[umbrella organization|umbrella group]] for 32 European civil rights and privacy NGOs), the [[Free Software Foundation]] (FSF), the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF), ASIC (French trade association for [[Web 2.0]] companies), and the [[Free Knowledge Institute]], states that "the current draft of ACTA would profoundly restrict the [[fundamental rights]] and freedoms of European citizens, most notably the [[freedom of expression]] and communication [[privacy]]."&lt;ref name="freeo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://freeknowledge.eu/acta-a-global-threat-to-freedoms-open-letter |title=ACTA: A Global Threat to Freedoms (Open Letter) |publisher=Free Knowledge Institute |accessdate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130023554/http://freeknowledge.eu/acta-a-global-threat-to-freedoms-open-letter |archivedate=30 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The FSF argues that ACTA will create a culture of surveillance and suspicion.&lt;ref name="fsf-speak-out"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsf.org/campaigns/acta/|title=Speak out against ACTA |publisher=[[Free Software Foundation]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Aaron Shaw, Research Fellow at the [[Berkman Center for Internet &amp; Society]] at [[Harvard University]], argues that "ACTA would create unduly harsh legal standards that do not reflect contemporary principles of democratic government, free market exchange, or civil liberties. Even though the precise terms of ACTA remain undecided, the negotiants' preliminary documents reveal many troubling aspects of the proposed agreement" such as removing "legal safeguards that protect Internet Service Providers from liability for the actions of their subscribers", in effect giving ISPs no option but to comply with privacy invasions. Shaw further says that "[ACTA] would also facilitate privacy violations by trademark and copyright holders against private citizens suspected of infringement activities without any sort of legal due process".&lt;ref name="problem"&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Aaron Shaw |title=The Problem with the Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (and what to do about it) |url=http://kestudies.org/node/20/ |journal=KEStudies |volume=2 |date=April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215065354/http://www.kestudies.org/node/20 |archivedate=15 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FSF has published "Speak out against ACTA", stating that the ACTA threatens free software by creating a culture "in which the freedom that is required to produce free software is seen as dangerous and threatening rather than creative, innovative, and exciting."&lt;ref name="fsf-speak-out" /&gt; ACTA would also require that existing ISPs no longer host free software that can access copyrighted media; this would substantially affect many sites that offer free software or host software projects such as [[SourceForge]]. Specifically, the FSF argues that ACTA will make it more difficult and expensive to distribute free software via [[file sharing]] and [[peer-to-peer]] (P2P) technologies like [[BitTorrent]], which are currently used to distribute large amounts of free software. The FSF also argues that ACTA will make it harder for users of free operating systems to play non-free media because [[digital rights management]] (DRM) protected media would not be legally playable with free software.&lt;ref name="fsf-speak-out" /&gt;

On 10 March 2010, the European Parliament adopted a resolution&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2010-0058&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=P7-RC-2010-0154 |title=Texts adopted – Wednesday, 10 March 2010 – Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) – P7_TA(2010)0058 |work=[[Europa (web portal)|Europa]] |date=10 March 2010 |accessdate=29 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; criticizing the ACTA with 663 in favor of the resolution and 13 against, arguing that "in order to respect fundamental rights, such as the right to freedom of expression and the [[right to privacy]]", certain changes in the ACTA content and the process should be made.&lt;ref name="europarl.europa.eu"/&gt;

===Criminalising generic medicine===
According to French EP member [[Kader Arif]], "The problem with ACTA is that, by focusing on the fight against violation of intellectual property rights in general, it treats a [[generic drug]] just as a counterfeited drug. This means the patent holder can stop the shipping of the drugs to a developing country, seize the cargo and even order the destruction of the drugs as a preventive measure." He continued, "Generic medicines are not counterfeited medicines; they are not the fake version of a drug; they are a generic version of a drug, produced either because the patent on the original drug has expired, or because a country has to put in place public health policies," he said.

A number of countries such as [[India]] and African nations have histories of seeking generic cheaper versions of expensive drugs for infections such as HIV, something that has often been resisted by pharmaceutical companies. "There are international agreements, such as the [[Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights|TRIPS Agreement]], which foresees this last possibility," he said. "They're particularly important for developing countries that cannot afford to pay for patented HIV drugs, for example." Arif has stated ACTA would limit the freedom of countries such as India to determine their own medical choices.&lt;ref name="karifgaurd"&gt;{{cite news |title=ACTA goes too far, says MEP |author=Charles Arthur |url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/feb/01/acta-goes-too-far-kader-arif |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 February 2012 |accessdate=4 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also the non-governmental organization [[Médecins Sans Frontières]] has taken a stance against ACTA&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/common-tags/acta |title=The Access Campaign: ACTA |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] |accessdate=2 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of their Access Campaign, a campaign promoting the development and access to "life-saving and life prolonging medicines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/the-access-campaign |title=The Access Campaign: About Us |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] |accessdate=2 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In their report ''A blank cheque for abuse: ACTA &amp; its Impact on Access to Medicines'', Médecins Sans Frontières concludes that ACTA has "fatal consequences on access to medicines", furthermore that the agreement "does nothing to address the problem of poor quality and unsafe medicines" and finally that ACTA "undermines existing international declarations to protect public health", circumventing the [[Doha Declaration]].&lt;ref name="MSF-report"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msfaccess.org/sites/default/files/MSF_assets/Access/Docs/Access_Briefing_ACTABlankCheque_ENG_2012.pdf |title=The Access Campaign: ACTA Briefing |publisher=[[Médecins Sans Frontières]] |format=PDF |accessdate=2 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Gylling Nielsen, the executive of the Danish division of Médecins Sans Frontières, has in a statement to the media said that "In the end, this is a question of life and death", elaborating his point by mentioning the "possible consequenses" of the treaty that "the hundreds of thousands of people who for example have [[HIV/AIDS]] will not get the treatment they need".&lt;ref name="SVD"&gt;{{cite news |title=Actaavtalet "dödar" i tredje världen |trans-title=Acta Agreement "kills" in the Third World |url=http://www.svd.se/nyheter/utrikes/actaavtalet-dodar-i-tredje-varlden_6842553.svd |newspaper=[[Svenska Dagbladet]] |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DN"&gt;{{cite news |title=Actaavtalet "dödar" i tredje världen |trans-title=Acta Agreement "kills" in the Third World |url=http://www.dn.se/ekonomi/actaavtalet-dodar-i-tredje-varlden |newspaper=[[Dagens Nyheter]] |date=11 February 2012 |accessdate=2 July 2012 |language=Swedish }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal scope===
Nate Anderson with [[Ars Technica]] pointed out that ACTA encourages service providers to collect and provide information about suspected infringers by giving them "safe harbor from certain legal threats". Similarly, it provides for criminalization of copyright infringement on a commercial scale,&lt;ref name="Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, Section 4: Criminal Enforcement"&gt;{{cite web |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement, Section 4: Criminal Enforcement |url=http://trade.ec.europa.eu/doclib/docs/2011/may/tradoc_147937.pdf |publisher=[[Directorate-General for Trade (European Commission)|European Commission Directorate General for Trade]] |accessdate=21 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; granting law enforcement the powers to perform criminal investigation, arrests and pursue criminal citations or prosecution of suspects who may have infringed on copyright on a commercial scale. It also allows criminal investigations and invasive searches to be performed against individuals for whom there is no probable cause, and in that regard weakens the presumption of innocence and allows what would in the past have been considered unlawful searches.

Since ACTA is an international treaty, it is an example of [[policy laundering]] used to establish and implement legal changes.  Policy laundering allows legal provisions to be pushed through via closed negotiations among private members of the executive bodies of the signatories.  This method avoids use of public legislation and its judiciary oversight.  Once ratified, companies belonging to non-members may be forced to follow the ACTA requirements since they will otherwise fall out of the safe harbor protections.  Also, the use of trade incentives and the like to persuade other nations to adopt treaties is a standard approach in international relationships.  Additional signatories would have to accept ACTA's terms without much scope for negotiation.&lt;ref name="Anderson, Nate: The real ACTA threat"&gt;{{cite web|title=The real ACTA threat (it's not iPod-scanning border guards) |work=[[Ars Technica]] |url=https://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080602-the-real-acta-threat-its-not-ipod-scanning-border-guards.html |author=Nate Anderson |date=2 June 2008 |accessdate=14 June 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080605004747/http://arstechnica.com/news.ars/post/20080602-the-real-acta-threat-its-not-ipod-scanning-border-guards.html |archivedate=5 June 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 16–18 June 2010, a conference was held at the [[Washington College of Law]], attended by "over 90 academics, practitioners and public interest organizations from six continents".&lt;ref name="communique"/&gt; Their conclusions were published on 23 June 2010 on the American University Washington College of Law website. They found "that the terms of the publicly released draft of ACTA threaten numerous public interests, including every concern specifically disclaimed by negotiators." A group of over 75 law professors signed a letter to President Obama demanding a host of changes to the agreement. The letter alleges that no meaningful transparency has been in evidence.&lt;ref name="haltofACTA"/&gt;

===Parallels with SOPA and PIPA===
{{See also|Stop Online Piracy Act|PROTECT IP Act|Protests against SOPA and PIPA|l2=Protect IP Act}}
Connor Adams Sheets of the ''[[International Business Times]]'' outlined five categories where digital rights advocates compared but expressed greater concern about ACTA than SOPA. Among these were the treaty's broader international nature, its fundamental lack of transparency, the relative ease of enactment, the degree of support by signatories, and a lack of visibility on the global political stage.&lt;ref name='Sheets 24 January 2011'&gt;{{cite news|author=Connor Sheets |title=ACTA vs. SOPA: Five Reasons ACTA is Scarier Threat to Internet Freedom |date=24 January 2011 |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/286925/20120124/acta-sopa-reasons-scarier-threat-internet-freedom.htm |work=[[International Business Times]] |accessdate=29 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/652uCsDQL?url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/286925/20120124/acta-sopa-reasons-scarier-threat-internet-freedom.htm |archivedate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' writer E.D. Kain compared the characteristics of ACTA with that of SOPA and PIPA, noting that they were each "defined by [their] opacity: secret negotiations, closed door talks, no public discussion."&lt;ref name="Kain 28 January 2012"&gt;{{cite news|author=E.D. Kain |title=Final Draft of ACTA Watered Down, TPP Still Dangerous on IP Rules |date=28 January 2012 |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/28/final-draft-of-acta-watered-down-tpp-still-dangerous-on-ip-rules/ |work=[[Forbes]] |accessdate=29 January 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/652ta2ttE?url=http://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2012/01/28/final-draft-of-acta-watered-down-tpp-still-dangerous-on-ip-rules/ |archivedate=29 January 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requests for disclosure==
In September 2008, a number of interest groups urged parties to the ACTA negotiations to disclose the language of the evolving agreement. In an open letter, the groups argued that: "Because the text of the treaty and relevant discussion documents remain secret, the public has no way of assessing whether and to what extent these and related concerns are merited." The interest groups included: the [[Consumers Union]], the Electronic Frontier Foundation, Essential Action, [[IP Justice]], [[Knowledge Ecology International]], [[Public Knowledge]], [[Global Trade Watch]], the US Public Interest Research Group, IP Left (Korea), the [[Canadian Library Association]], the Consumers Union of Japan, [[Consumer Focus]] (UK) and [[Médecins Sans Frontières]]' Campaign for Essential Medicines.&lt;ref name="factorfiction"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.wired.com/27bstroke6/2008/09/international-i.html |title=Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement: Fact or Fiction? |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=15 September 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Electronic Frontier Foundation and Public Knowledge filed a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request, which was denied.&lt;ref name="med.govt.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="What is ACTA"&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.eff.org/issues/acta |title=What is ACTA? |publisher=[[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] |accessdate=1 December 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081127020704/http://www.eff.org/issues/acta |archivedate=27 November 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
A coalition of concerned organisations submitted to the responsible Australian Government department, the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Principles for ACTA negotiations |url=http://www.digital.org.au/submission/documents/PrinciplesforACTAnegotiations.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106160743/http://www.digital.org.au/submission/documents/PrinciplesforACTAnegotiations.pdf |archivedate=6 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The submission agreed that reducing counterfeiting is important where it endangers consumer health or safety, or constitutes commercial scale infringement. However, the coalition urged that pursuit of that goal should not threaten legitimate commercial, social, innovative and creative activities, the rights of consumers or the free flow of information. The coalition noted the current proposed treaty raised serious concerns with respect to transparency, increased customs search powers, increased penalties for IP infringement, and lack of due process.

The coalition consisted of:
* the [[Australian Digital Alliance]]&amp;nbsp;– a public interest copyright organisation advocating for an appropriately balanced copyright regime;
* the [[Australian Library and Information Association]]&amp;nbsp;– the peak professional organisation for the Australian library and information services sector;
* [[Choice (Australian consumer organisation)|Choice]]&amp;nbsp;– a not-for-profit consumer organisation that campaigns on behalf of Australian consumers; and
* the [[Internet Industry Association]]&amp;nbsp;– Australia's national Internet industry organisation that provides policy input to government and advocacy on a range of issues.

===Canada===
The [[University of Ottawa]]'s [[Canadian Internet Policy and Public Interest Clinic]] filed an ''[[Access to Information Act]]'' request to see the government's position but received only a document stating the title of the agreement, with everything else blacked out.&lt;ref name="Pilieci"/&gt;

===European Union===
In November 2008, the [[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] requested secret Anti-Counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) documents from the EU Council, specifically naming twelve documents to be published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://press.ffii.org/Press_releases/FFII_opposes_stealth_legislation%2C_demands_ACTA_documents |title=FFII opposes stealth legislation, demands ACTA documents |date=3 November 2008 |accessdate=4 February 2012 |publisher=[[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503123622/http://press.ffii.org/Press_releases/FFII_opposes_stealth_legislation%2C_demands_ACTA_documents |archivedate=3 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The request was denied by the EU council, stating that "disclosure of this information could impede the proper conduct of the negotiations, would weaken the position of the European Union in these negotiations and might affect relations with the third parties concerned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://press.ffii.org/Press_releases/EU_Council_refuses_to_release_secret_ACTA_documents |date=10 November 2008 |title=EU Council refuses to release secret ACTA documents |accessdate=4 February 2012 |publisher=[[Foundation for a Free Information Infrastructure]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090501081045/http://press.ffii.org/Press_releases/EU_Council_refuses_to_release_secret_ACTA_documents |archivedate=1 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010, the European Parliament passed a resolution demanding greater transparency in public affairs, which among other things called on the European Commission to make public all documents relating to the negotiations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europarl.europa.eu/sides/getDoc.do?type=TA&amp;reference=P7-TA-2010-0058&amp;language=EN&amp;ring=P7-RC-2010-0154

In August 2005, a coalition&lt;ref name=actanetnz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://acta.net.nz |title=acta.net.nz coalition |accessdate=20 March 2010 |author=acta.net.nz |date=20 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100308015940/http://acta.net.nz/ |archivedate=8 March 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of NGOs and individuals formed to request more transparency in ACTA negotiations. At briefings held by the Ministry of Economic Development (MED) and the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (MFAT) on 16 December 2009, representatives from the coalition organisations supported the New Zealand negotiators stated desire to call for more transparency. In December 2009 two New Zealand members of Parliament, [[Clare Curran]] ([[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour]]) and [[Peter Dunne]] ([[United Future]]) also publicly questioned the need for secrecy.&lt;ref name="ClareCurran"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.labour.org.nz/index.php/2009/12/04/whats-the-need-for-secrecy/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091205155042/http://blog.labour.org.nz/index.php/2009/12/04/whats-the-need-for-secrecy/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 December 2009 |title=What's the need for Secrecy? |accessdate=12 April 2009 |author=[[Clare Curran]] |date=12 April 2009 |publisher=[[New Zealand Labour Party]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PeterDunne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unitedfuture.org.nz/default,1286,dunne_what_are_we_signing_up_to_mr_power.sm |title=Dunne: What are we signing up to, Mr Power? |accessdate=12 April 2009 |author=[[Peter Dunne]] |date=12 April 2009 |publisher=[[United Future]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123221752/http://www.unitedfuture.org.nz/default%2C1286%2Cdunne_what_are_we_signing_up_to_mr_power.sm |archivedate=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2010, Tech Liberty, a New Zealand digital civil rights organisation, received a response to its [[Official Information Act 1982|Official Information Act]] request on ACTA.&lt;ref name="TechLibertyACTAOIA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techliberty.org.nz/acta-the-nz-official-information-requests/ |title=TechLiberty's Official Information Act request on ACTA |accessdate=17 March 2010 |author=Thomas Beagle |date=17 March 2010 |publisher=TechLiberty |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100324044912/http://techliberty.org.nz/acta-the-nz-official-information-requests/ |archivedate=24 March 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was given letters from the [[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|Ministry of Economic Development]] and the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (New Zealand)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] plus the May 2008 cabinet paper&lt;ref name="ACTACabinetPaperNZ"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://techliberty.org.nz/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/ACTA-Cabinet-Paper.pdf |title=NZ's MED 2008 Cabinet paper on ACTA |accessdate=21 March 2010 |author=[[Ministry of Economic Development (New Zealand)|New Zealand Ministry of Economic Development]] |date=5 July 2008 |publisher=TechLiberty }}&lt;/ref&gt; in which the New Zealand government agreed to participate in ACTA. Portions of the cabinet paper, and answers to questions posed by TechLiberty, were withheld including the venue for the April 2010 ACTA negotiations, the cabinet discussion paper on participation in ACTA, and all copies of draft negotiation texts, and all documents expressing New Zealand's negotiating position. This information was withheld under Official Information Act provisions allowing for withholding of information where it would prejudice the international relations of the Government of New Zealand, where it would affect the privacy of natural persons, where it was required to maintain the effective conduct of public affairs, and where withholding information was required to enable the government to carry on negotiations (including commercial and industrial negotiations).

In April 2010 a coalition of NZ organisations ran the PublicACTA event immediately prior to the negotiation round held in Wellington New Zealand. At the PublicACTA event participants drafted the [https://web.archive.org/web/20120718223527/http://acta.net.nz/the-wellington-declaration Wellington Declaration]. The Wellington Declaration was delivered to the New Zealand negotiators, who provided it to representatives from all the other negotiating countries. Following the Wellington negotiation round in April 2010 the text of ACTA was released publicly. This was the only time this occurred during the ACTA negotiations.

{{anchor|Rapporteur's resignation}}
[[Kader Arif]], European parliament's [[rapporteur]] for ACTA, resigned from his position on 26 January 2012 denouncing the treaty "in the strongest possible manner" for having "no inclusion of civil society organizations, a lack of transparency from the start of the negotiations, repeated postponing of the signature of the text without an explanation being ever given, [and] exclusion of the EU Parliament's demands that were expressed on several occasions in [the] assembly," concluding with his intent to "send a strong signal and alert the public opinion about this unacceptable situation" and refusal to "take part in this masquerade."&lt;ref name="Masnick 26 January 2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thomson 27 January 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20120205" /&gt;

===Slovenia===
Helena Drnovšek-Zorko, Slovenian ambassador to Japan, issued a statement on 31 January 2012 expressing deep remorse for having signed the agreement. "I signed ACTA out of civic carelessness, because I did not pay enough attention. Quite simply, I did not clearly connect the agreement I had been instructed to sign with the agreement that, according to my own civic conviction, limits and withholds the freedom of engagement on the largest and most significant network in human history, and thus limits particularly the future of our children," she said.&lt;ref name="NYT-20120205" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Drnovšek-Zorko 2012-01-31"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metinalista.si/why-i-signed-acta/ |title=Why I signed ACTA |accessdate=4 February 2012 |author=Helena Drnovšek-Zorko |date=31 January 2012 |work=Metina lista |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65DCnzGnz?url=http://metinalista.si/why-i-signed-acta/ |archivedate=4 February 2012 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57801">'''Anti-clericalism''' is opposition to [[religious authority]], typically in social or political matters. Historical anti-clericalism has mainly been opposed to the influence of [[Roman Catholicism]]. Anti-clericalism is related to [[secularism]], which seeks to remove the church from all aspects of public and political life, and its involvement in the everyday life of the citizen.&lt;ref&gt;José Mariano Sánchez, ''Anticlericalism: a brief history'' (University of Notre Dame Press, 1972)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have opposed clergy on the basis of moral corruption, institutional issues and/or disagreements in religious interpretation, such as during the [[Protestant Reformation]]. Anti-clericalism became extremely violent during the [[French Revolution]] because revolutionaries believed the church had played a pivotal role in the systems of oppression which led to it. Many clerics were killed, and French revolutionary governments tried to control priests by making them state employees.

Anti-clericalism appeared in [[Catholic Europe]] throughout the 19th century, in various forms, and later in Canada, Cuba, and Latin America.

[[File:Action cléricale.jpg|thumb|Illustration in the French anti-clerical magazine [[La Calotte]] in 1908.]]

====Revolution====
The [[Civil Constitution of the Clergy]] was passed on July 12, 1790, requiring all clerics to swear allegiance to the French government and, by extension, to the increasingly anti-clerical [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]]. All but seven of the 160 bishops refused the oath, as did about half of the parish priests.&lt;ref name=Joes-51&gt;Joes, Anthony James [https://books.google.com/books?id=buHXFDFdeoQC&amp;dq Resisting Rebellion: The History and Politics of Counterinsurgency] 2006 University Press of Kentucky {{ISBN|0-8131-2339-9}}. p.51&lt;/ref&gt; Persecution of the clergy and [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|of the faithful]] was the first trigger of the rebellion; the second being conscription. Nonjuring priests were exiled or imprisoned and women on their way to Mass were beaten in the streets.&lt;ref name=Joes-51/&gt;

The anti-clericalism during the French Revolution initially began with attacks on church corruption and the wealth of the higher clergy, an action with which even many [[Christian]]s could identify, since the Roman Catholic church held a dominant role in pre-revolutionary France.  During a two-year period known as the [[Reign of Terror]], the episodes of anti-clericalism grew more violent than any in modern European history. The new revolutionary authorities suppressed the church; abolished the Catholic monarchy; nationalized church property; exiled 30,000 priests and killed hundreds more.&lt;ref name="StoryChr"&gt;{{cite book |last= Collins|first= Michael|others= Mathew A Price |title=The Story of Christianity|year=1999 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=978-0-7513-0467-1 |pages=176–177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many churches were converted into "temples of reason," in which {{notatypo|atheistical}} services were held.&lt;ref name="HorneDavidson2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Horne|first1=Thomas Hartwell|last2=Davidson|first2=Samuel|title=An Introduction to the Critical Study and Knowledge of the Holy Scriptures|date=21 November 2013|publisher=Cambridge University Press|language=English |isbn=978-1-108-06772-0|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Latreille, A.

Local people often resisted dechristianisation and forced members of the clergy who had resigned to conduct Mass again. Eventually, [[Maximilien Robespierre]] and the [[Committee of Public Safety]] denounced the dechristianization campaign and tried to establish their own religion, without the superstitions of Catholicism.&lt;ref&gt;Censer and Hunt, ''Liberty, Equality, Fraternity: Exploring the French Revolution'', pp. 92–94.&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Pope Pius VI]] took sides against the revolution in the [[First Coalition]] (1792–1797), [[Napoleon Bonaparte]] invaded [[Italy]] (1796).&lt;ref name="SandS"&gt;{{cite book |last= Duffy|first= Eamon|title=Saints and Sinners, a History of the Popes|year=1997|publisher= [[Yale University Press]] in association with S4C |isbn=|id=Library of Congress Catalog card number 97-60897}}
&lt;/ref&gt; French troops imprisoned the Pope in 1797, and he died after six weeks of captivity.&lt;ref name="SandS"/&gt;
After a change of heart, Napoleon then re-established the Catholic Church in France with the signing of the [[Concordat of 1801]],&lt;ref name="SandS"/&gt; and banned the Cult of the Supreme Being.
Many anti-clerical policies continued. When Napoleonic armies entered a territory, monasteries were often sacked and church property secularized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3m1CfZj8ZAC&amp;pg=PA131&amp;lpg=PA131&amp;dq=napoleon+sacked+monasteries+closed+secularized&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XmGqU5d6LT&amp;sig=ac2RlTNNh6gcD_U90vSJ_lCnzeE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K98vT5ueM4zkggfCsP37Dw&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=napoleon%20sacked%20monasteries%20closed%20secularized&amp;f=false |title=Napoleon's Legacy: Problems of Government in Restoration Europe - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZS3nAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA412&amp;lpg=PA412&amp;dq=napoleon+sacked+monasteries+closed+secularized&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=oFPjMTHcxw&amp;sig=PU_gWjv16zvshLlpylXNSgdq-vQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K98vT5ueM4zkggfCsP37Dw&amp;ved=0CDcQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=napoleon%20sacked%20monasteries%20closed%20secularized&amp;f=false |title=The Churchman - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=1985-12-29 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XRtWxK42KMgC&amp;pg=PA281&amp;lpg=PA281&amp;dq=napoleon+sacked+monasteries+closed+secularized&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K9lykl9zkB&amp;sig=RyIp6kcSjEzFs8TI_8__1Rw-_fQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K98vT5ueM4zkggfCsP37Dw&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=napoleon%20sacked%20monasteries%20closed%20secularized&amp;f=false |title=Prosperity and Plunder: European Catholic Monasteries in the Age of ... - Derek Edward Dawson Beales - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=2003-07-24 |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gordon.edu/lettersfromeurope/agneshoward |title=Notes On Monastero San Paolo: Reentering The Vestibule of Paradise - Gordon College |publisher=Gordon.edu |date= |accessdate=27 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Third Republic====
A further phase of anti-clericalism occurred in the context of the [[French Third Republic]] and its dissensions with the Catholic Church. Prior to the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State]], the Catholic Church enjoyed preferential treatment from the French state (formally along with the Jewish, [[Lutheran]] and [[Calvinist]] minority religions, but in practice with much more influence than those). During the 19th century, public schools employed primarily priests as teachers, and religion was taught in schools (teachers were also obliged to lead the class to [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]). In 1881–1882 [[Jules Ferry]]'s government passed the [[Jules Ferry laws]], establishing free education (1881) and mandatory and lay education (1882), giving the basis of French [[public education]]. The [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]] (1871–1940) firmly established itself after the [[16 May 1877 crisis]] triggered by the Catholic [[Legitimists]] who wished for a return to the ''[[Ancien Régime]]''.

A law of 7 July 1904 preventing religious congregations from teaching any longer, and the [[1905 French law on the Separation of the Churches and the State|1905 law on separation of state and church]], were enacted under the government of [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist]] [[Émile Combes]]. [[Alsace-Lorraine]] was not subjected to these laws as it was part of the [[German Empire]] then.

In the ''[[Affaire des Fiches]]'' (1904-1905), it was discovered that the anticlerical War Minister of the [[Émile Combes|Combes]] government, General [[Louis André]], was determining promotions based on the French [[Catholicism and Freemasonry|Masonic]] Grand Orient's card index on public officials, detailing which were Catholic and who attended Mass, with a view to preventing their promotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Franklin|2006|p=9}} (footnote 26) cites {{cite book |last=Larkin |first=Maurice |title= Church and State after the Dreyfus Affair |pages=138–41}}:  {{Cite journal |title=Freemasonry in France |journal=Austral Light |volume=6 |year=1905 |pages= 164–72, 241–50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Republicanism|Republicans]]' anti-clericalism softened after the First World War as the Catholic right-wing began to accept the Republic and [[secularism]]. However, the theme of subsidized [[education in France|private schools in France]], which are overwhelmingly Catholic but whose teachers draw pay from the state, remains a sensitive issue in [[Politics of France|French politics]].

===Austria (Holy Roman Empire)===
Emperor [[Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor|Joseph II]] (emperor 1765-1790) opposed what he called "contemplative" religious institutions — reclusive Catholic institutions that he perceived as doing nothing positive for the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite CE1913|wstitle=Joseph II |first=H. |last=Franz |volume=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; His policy towards them are included in what is called [[Josephinism]].

Joseph decreed that Austrian bishops could not communicate directly with the [[Roman Curia|Curia]]. More than 500 of 1,188 monasteries in Austro-Slav lands (and a hundred more in Hungary) were dissolved, and 60 million florins taken by the state. This wealth was used to create 1,700 new parishes and welfare institutions.{{sfn|Okey|2002|p=44}}

The education of priests was taken from the Church as well. Joseph established six state-run "General Seminaries." In 1783, a Marriage Patent treated marriage as a civil contract rather than a religious institution.{{sfn|Berenger|1990|p=102}}

Catholic Historians have claimed that there was an alliance between Joseph and anti-clerical Freemasons.&lt;ref&gt;"In Germany and Austria, Freemasonry during the eighteenth century was a powerful ally of the so-called party, of "[[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]" (Aufklaerung), and of Josephinism" {{harv|Gruber|1909}} .&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
{{main article|Kulturkampf}}
[[File:Kladderadatsch 1875 - Zwischen Berlin und Rom.png|thumb|"Between Berlin and Rome", with Bismarck on the left and the Pope on the right. ''[[Kladderadatsch]]'', 1875]]
The [[Kulturkampf]], (literally "culture struggle") refers to German policies in reducing the role and power of the Catholic Church in Prussia, enacted from 1871 to 1878 by the Prime Minister of [[Prussia]], [[Otto von Bismarck]].

Bismarck accelerated the ''Kulturkampf'', which did not extend to the other German states such as [[Bavaria]] (where Catholics were in a majority). As one scholar put it, "the attack on the church included a series of Prussian, discriminatory laws that made Catholics feel understandably persecuted within a predominantly Protestant nation." [[Jesuits]], [[Franciscans]], [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and other orders were expelled in the culmination of twenty years of anti-Jesuit and antimonastic hysteria.&lt;ref&gt;Michael B. Gross, [https://books.google.com/books?id=fnCzk2fI9Z4C&amp;dq The war against Catholicism: liberalism and the anti-Catholic imagination in nineteenth-century Germany], p. 1, University of Michigan Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1871, the Catholic Church comprised 36.5% of the population of the German Empire, including millions of Germans in the west and South, as well as the vast majority of Poles. In this newly founded Empire, Bismarck sought to appeal to liberals and Protestants (62% of the population) by reducing the political and social influence of the Catholic Church.

Priests and bishops who resisted the ''Kulturkampf'' were arrested or removed from their positions.  By the height of anti-Catholic measures, half of the Prussian bishops were in prison or in exile, a quarter of the parishes had no priest, half the monks and nuns had left Prussia, a third of the monasteries and convents were closed, 1800 parish priests were imprisoned or exiled, and thousands of laypeople were imprisoned for helping the priests.&lt;ref&gt;Richard J. Helmstadter, [https://books.google.com/books?id=aw_1aaE0Fb4C&amp;pg ''Freedom and religion in the nineteenth century''] (1997), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kulturkampf backfired, as it energized the Catholics to become a political force in the Centre party and revitalized Polish resistance. The ''Kulturkampf'' ended about 1880 with a new pope Leo XIII willing to negotiate with Bismarck. Bismarck broke with the Liberals over religion and over their opposition to tariffs; He won Centre party support on most of his conservative policy positions, especially his attacks against Socialism.

===Italy===
Anti-clericalism in [[Italy]] is connected with reaction against the absolutism of the [[Papal States]], overthrown in 1870. For a long time, the [[Pope]] required Catholics not to participate in the public life of the [[Italy|Kingdom of Italy]] that had invaded the Papal States to complete the unification of Italy, prompting the pope to declare himself a "prisoner" in the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. Some politicians that had played important roles in this process, such as [[Camillo Benso, conte di Cavour]], were known to be hostile to the temporal and political power of the Church.  Throughout the history of Liberal Italy, relations between the Italian government and the Church remained acrimonious, and anticlericals maintained a prominent position in the ideological and political debates of the era.  Tensions eased between church and state in the 1890s and early 1900s as a result of both sides' mutual hostility toward the burgeoning Socialist movement, but official hostility between the [[Holy See]] and the Italian state was finally settled by fascist [[dictator]] [[Benito Mussolini]] and Pope Pius XI: the [[Lateran Accords]] were finalised in 1929.

After World War II, anti-clericalism was embodied by the [[Italian Communist Party|Italian Communist]] and [[Italian Socialist Party|Italian Socialist]] parties, in opposition to the Vatican-endorsed party [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democracy]].

The revision of the Lateran treaties during the 1980s by the Socialist [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Bettino Craxi]], removed the status of "official religion" of the Catholic Church, but still granted a series of provisions in favour of the Church, such as the [[eight per thousand]] law, the teaching of religion in schools, and other privileges.

Recently, the Catholic Church has been taking a more aggressive stance in [[Politics of Italy|Italian politics]], in particular through [[cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Camillo Ruini]], who often makes his voice heard commenting the political debate and indicating the official line of the Church on various matters. This interventionism has increased with the papacy of [[Benedict XVI]]. Anti-clericalism, however, is not the official stance of most parties (with the exception of the [[Italian Radicals]], who, however identify as [[laicist]]), as most party leaders consider it an electoral disadvantage to openly contradict the Church: since the demise of the Christian Democracy as a single party, Catholic votes are often swinging between the right and the left wing, and are considered to be decisive to win an election.

===Poland===
[[Your Movement]] is an anti-clerical party founded in 2011 by politician [[Janusz Palikot]]. Palikot's Movement won 10% of the national vote at the [[Polish parliamentary election, 2011]].

===Portugal===

The fall of the Monarchy in the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Republican revolution of 1910]] led to another wave of anti-clerical activity. Most church property was put under State control, and the church was not allowed to inherit property. The revolution and the republic which took a [[Separation of church and state#Friendly and hostile separation|"hostile" approach to the issue of church and state separation]], like that of the [[Dechristianisation of France during the French Revolution|French Revolution]], the [[Spanish Constitution of 1931]] and the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]].&lt;ref&gt;

The first instance of anti-clerical violence due to political conflict in 19th century Spain occurred during the [[Trienio Liberal]] (Spanish Civil War of 1820–1823). During riots in [[Catalonia]], 20 clergymen were killed by members of the liberal movement in retaliation for the Church's siding with absolutist supporters of [[Ferdinand VII]].

In 1836 following the [[First Carlist War]], the [[Ecclesiastical Confiscations of Mendizábal]] ({{lang-es|Desamortización}}) promulgated by [[Juan Álvarez Mendizábal]], prime minister of the new regime abolished the major Spanish Convents and Monasteries.&lt;ref&gt;Germán Rueda Hernánz, ''La desamortización en España: un balance, 1766-1924,'' Arco Libros. 1997. {{ISBN|978-84-7635-270-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many years later the [[Radical Republican Party]] leader [[Alejandro Lerroux]] would distinguish himself by his inflammatory pieces of opinion.

====Second Republic and Civil War (1931-1939)====
{{Main article|Red Terror (Spain)}}
{{Further information|Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War}}

The [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican government]] which came to power in Spain in 1931 was based on secular principles. In the first years some laws were passed secularising education, prohibiting religious education in the schools, and expelling the [[Jesuits]] from the country. On [[Pentecost]] 1932, Pope Pius XI protested against these measures and demanded [[restitution]]. He asked the Catholics of Spain to fight with all legal means against the injustices. June 3, 1933 he issued the encyclical [[Dilectissima Nobis]], in which he described the expropriation of all Church buildings, episcopal residences, parish houses, seminaries and monasteries.

By law, they were now property of the Spanish State, to which the Church had to pay rent and taxes in order to continuously use these properties. "Thus the Catholic Church is compelled to pay taxes on what was violently taken from her"&lt;ref&gt;[[Dilectissima Nobis]] 1933, § 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; Religious vestments, liturgical instruments, statues, pictures, vases, gems and other valuable objects were expropriated as well.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dilectissima Nobis]] 1933, § 12&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Spanish Civil War|Civil War]] in Spain started in 1936, Catholics largely supported Franco and the Nationalist forces in the Spanish Civil War of 1936–1939. Anti-clerical assaults during what has been termed by the Nationalists [[Red Terror (Spain)|Red Terror]] included sacking and burning monasteries and churches and killing 6,832 members of the clergy.&lt;ref name="cueva355"&gt;{{Harvard citation no brackets|de la Cueva|1998|p=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prior to the [[Falange Española de las JONS|falangists]] joining Francisco Franco's unified alliance of right-wing parties, the party exhibited anti-clerical tendencies. the party was less ferverent in its support for the catholic church which it saw as an elite being an obstacle for the movement to be able to fully control the state. Despite this, no [[Martyrs of the Spanish Civil War|massacres of catholics]] have been caused by falangists, whom supported the church as a result of their alliance to monarchists and other [[FET y de las JONS|nationalist movements]].

== Canada ==
In French Canada following the Conquest, much like in Ireland or Poland under foreign rule, the Catholic Church was the sole national institution not under the direct control of the British colonial government. It was also a major marker of social difference from the incoming Anglo-Protestant settlers. French Canadian identity was almost entirely centred around Catholicism, and to a much lesser extent the French language.  However, there was a small anti-clerical movement in French Canada in the early nineteenth drawing inspiration from American and French liberal revolutions.  This group was one current (but by no means the dominant) one in the [[Parti canadien]] its associated [[Lower Canada Rebellion]] of 1837. In the more democratic politics that followed the rebellions, the more radical and anti-clerical tendency eventually formed the [[Parti rouge]] in 1848.

At the same time in English Canada, a related phenomenon occurred where the primarily [[Nonconformist]] (mostly [[Presbyterianism in Canada|Presbyterian]] and [[Methodism in Canada|Methodist]]) [[Reform movement (pre-Confederation Canada)|Reform movement]] conflicted with an [[Anglican Church of Canada|Anglican]] establishment. In Upper Canada, [[The Reform Movement (Upper Canada)|The Reform Movement]] began as protest against the [[established church|"establishment"]] of the Anglican church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilton|first=Carol|title=Popular Politics and Political Culture in Upper Canada 1800-1850|year=2000|publisher=McGill-Queens University Press|location=Montreal/Kingston|pages=51–53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The vastly different religious backgrounds of the Reformers and rouges was one of the factors which prevented them from working together well during the era of [[co-premiers of the Province of Canada|two-party coalition government]] in Canada (1840–1867).  By 1861, however, the two groups fused to create a united Liberal block.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Parties: The Liberal Party of Canada |url=http://www.canadian-politics.com/tiki-index.php?page=Liberal |publisher=Canadian-Politics.com |accessdate=2011-11-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111010203255/http://canadian-politics.com/tiki-index.php?page=Liberal |archivedate=2011-10-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; After 1867, this party added like-minded reformers from the Maritime provinces, but struggled to win power, especially in still strongly-Catholic Quebec.

Once [[Wilfrid Laurier]] became party leader, however, the party dropped its anti-clerical stance and went on to dominate Canadian politics throughout most of the twentieth century.  Since that time, Liberal prime ministers have been overwhelmingly Catholic (St. Laurent, Trudeau, Chrétien, Martin), but since the 1960s Liberals have again had a strained relationship with the Catholic church, and have increasing parted with the Catholic church's teachings on [[sexual morality]], as when Trudeau legalized homosexuality and streamlined divorce (as justice minister under Pearson), and Martin legalized same-sex marriage.

In Quebec itself, the [[Quiet Revolution]] of the 1960s broke the hold of the church on provincial politics.  The [[Quebec Liberal Party]] embraced formerly taboo [[social democratic]] ideas, and the state intervened in fields once dominated by the church, especially health and education, which were taken over by the provincial government. Quebec is now considered &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/canada-marching-from-religion-to-secularization/article1320108/|title=Canada marching from religion to secularization|publisher=|via=The Globe and Mail}}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada's most secular province.

== United States ==
Although anti-clericalism is more often spoken of regarding the history or current politics of Latin countries where the Catholic Church was established and where the clergy had privileges, [[Philip Jenkins]] notes in his 2003 book ''[[The New Anti-Catholicism]]'' that the U.S., despite the lack of Catholic establishments, has always had anti-clericals.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, Philip, [https://books.google.com/books?id=cVwthOtTiI4C The New Anti-Catholicism: The Last Acceptable Prejudice], p. 10, Oxford University Press US, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Latin America==
{{Main article|Anti-clericalism in Latin America}}
Of the population of Latin America, about 71% acknowledge allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church.&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, Barbara J., [http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050628212330/http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0503707.htm In Latin America, Catholics down, church's credibility up, poll says] Catholic News Service June 23, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Fewer Catholics in Latin America"&gt;Oppenheimer, Andres [http://legacy.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20050517/news_lz1e17oppenh.html Fewer Catholics in Latin America] San Diego Tribune May 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, about 43% of the world's Catholics inhabit the ‘Latin’ countries of South, Central and North America.&lt;ref name="Fewer Catholics in Latin America"/&gt;

The slowness to embrace religious freedom in Latin America is related to its colonial heritage and to its post-colonial history. The [[Aztec]], [[Maya civilization|Maya]] and [[Inca Empire|Inca]] cultures made substantial use of religious leaders to ideologically support governing authority and power. This pre-existing role of religion as ideological adjunct to the state in [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] culture made it relatively easy for the Spanish conquistadors to replace native religious structures with those of a Catholicism that was closely linked to the Spanish throne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Paul E. |last=Sigmund |year=1996 |publisher=Emory University School of Law |journal=Emory International Law Review |title=Religious Human Rights in the World Today: A Report on the 1994 Atlanta Conference: Legal Perspectives on Religious Human Rights: Religious Human Rights in Latin America}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-clericalism was a common feature of 19th-century liberalism in Latin America. This anti-clericalism was often purportedly based on the idea that the clergy (especially the prelates who ran the administrative offices of the Church) were hindering social progress in areas such as public education and economic development.

Beginning in the 1820s, a succession of liberal regimes came to power in Latin America.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy, ''Mexico and the United States'' (2003), p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of these liberal regimes sought to imitate the Spain of the 1830s (and revolutionary France of a half-century earlier) in expropriating the wealth of the Catholic Church, and in imitating the eighteenth-century benevolent despots in restricting or prohibiting the religious orders. As a result, a number of these liberal regimes expropriated Church property and tried to bring education, marriage and burial under secular authority. The confiscation of Church properties and changes in the scope of religious liberties (in general, increasing the rights of non-Catholics and non-observant Catholics, while licensing or prohibiting the orders) generally accompanied secularist and governmental reforms.&lt;ref name="Norman172"&gt;Norman, ''The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History'' (2007), pp. 167–72&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Reform War ====
{{Main article|Reform War}}

Starting in 1855, President [[Benito Juárez]] issued decrees nationalizing church property, separating church and state, and suppressing religious orders. Church properties were confiscated and basic civil and political rights were denied to religious orders and the clergy.

==== Cristero War ====
{{Main article|Cristero War}}

More severe laws called [[Calles Law]] during the rule of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] eventually led to the [[Cristero War]], an armed peasant rebellion against the Mexican government supported by the [[Catholic Church]].&lt;ref name="Chadwick264"&gt;Chadwick, ''A History of Christianity'' (1995), pp. 264–5&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[Mexican Revolution]] of 1910, the new Mexican Constitution of 1917 contained further anti-clerical provisions. Article 3 called for secular education in the schools and prohibited the Church from engaging in primary education; Article 5 outlawed monastic orders; Article 24 forbade public worship outside the confines of churches; and Article 27 placed restrictions on the right of religious organizations to hold property. Article 130 deprived clergy members of basic political rights. Many of these laws were resisted, leading to the [[Cristero War|Cristero Rebellion]] of 1927–1929. The suppression of the Church included the closing of many churches and the killing of priests. The persecution was most severe in Tabasco under the [[atheist]]"&lt;ref&gt;Peter Godman, "Graham Greene's Vatican Dossier" ''The Atlantic Monthly'' 288.1 (July/August 2001): 85.
&lt;/ref&gt; governor [[Tomás Garrido Canabal]].

The church-supported armed rebellion only escalated the violence.  US Diplomat [[Dwight Morrow]] was brought in to mediate the conflict.  But 1928 saw the assassination of President [[Alvaro Obregón]] by Catholic radical [[José de León Toral]], gravely damaging the peace process.

The war had a profound effect on the Church. Between 1926 and 1934 at least 40 priests were killed.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"&gt;Van Hove, Brian [http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT Blood-Drenched Altars] Faith &amp; Reason 1994
&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1926 and 1934, over 3,000 priests were exiled or assassinated.&lt;ref name="Scheina"&gt;Scheina, ''Latin America's Wars: The Age of the Caudillo'' (2003), p. 33&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Van Hove | first =Brian | title =Blood Drenched Altars | publisher =EWTN | year =1994 | url =http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT  |accessdate=2008-03-09}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Where 4,500 priests served the people before the rebellion, in 1934 there were only 334 priests licensed by the government to serve fifteen million people, the rest having been eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Scheina, Robert L. p. 33"&gt;

This issue was one of the bases for the lasting dispute between Conservatives, who represented primarily the interests of the [[Geography of Ecuador#La Sierra (the highlands)|Sierra]] and the church, and the Liberals, who represented those of the Costa and anticlericalism.

=== Colombia ===
{{Further information|La Violencia}}

Colombia enacted anticlerical legislation and its enforcement during more than three decades (1849–84).

[[La Violencia]] refers to an era of civil conflict in various areas of the [[Colombia]]n countryside between supporters of the [[Colombian Liberal Party]] and the [[Colombian Conservative Party]], a conflict which took place roughly from 1948 to 1958.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stokes, Doug |url=http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |title=America's Other War : Terrorizing Colombia |publisher=Zed Books |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-84277-547-9 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160109132325/http://bailey83221.livejournal.com/54324.html |archivedate=2016-01-09 |df= }} p. 68, ''Both Livingstone and Stokes quote a figure of 200,000 dead between 1948–1953 (Livingstone) and "a decade war" (Stokes)''&lt;br /&gt;*{{cite journal

Across the country, militants attacked churches, convents, and monasteries, killing priests and looking for arms, since the conspiracy theory maintained that the religious had guns, and this despite the fact that not a single serviceable weapon was located in the raids.{{sfn|Williford|2005|p=218}}

When their party came to power in 1930, anticlerical Liberals pushed for legislation to end Church influence in public schools. These Liberals held that the Church and its intellectual backwardness were responsible for a lack of spiritual and material progress in Colombia. Liberal-controlled local, departmental and national governments ended contracts with religious communities who operated schools in government-owned buildings, and set up secular schools in their place. These actions were sometimes violent, and were met by a strong opposition from clerics, Conservatives, and even a good number of more moderate Liberals.

=== Argentina ===
The original [[Argentine Constitution of 1853]] provided that all Argentine presidents must be Catholic and stated that the duty of the Argentine congress was to convert the Indians to Catholicism. All of these provisions have been eliminated with the exception of the mandate to "sustain" Catholicism.

Liberal anti-clericalists of the 1880s established a new pattern of church-state relations in which the official constitutional status of the Church was preserved while the state assumed control of many functions formerly the province of the Church. Conservative Catholics, asserting their role as definers of national values and morality, responded in part by joining in the rightist religio-political movement known as Catholic Nationalism which formed successive opposition parties. This began a prolonged period of conflict between church and state that persisted until the 1940s when the Church enjoyed a restoration of its former status under the presidency of Colonel [[Juan Perón]]. Perón claimed that Peronism was the "true embodiment of Catholic social teaching" – indeed, more the embodiment of Catholicism than the Catholic Church itself.

In 1954, Argentina saw extensive destruction of churches, denunciations of clergy and confiscation of Catholic schools as Perón attempted to extend state control over national institutions.&lt;ref name="Norman167"&gt;Norman, ''The Roman Catholic Church an Illustrated History'' (2007), pp. 167–8&lt;/ref&gt;

The renewed rupture in church-state relations was completed when Perón was [[Excommunication|excommunicated]]. However, in 1955, he was overthrown by a military general who was a leading member of the Catholic Nationalist movement.

=== Venezuela ===
In Venezuela, the government of [[Antonio Guzmán Blanco]] (in office from 1870–1877, from 1879–1884, and from 1886–1887) virtually crushed the institutional life of the church, even attempting to legalize the marriage of priests. These anticlerical policies remained in force for decades afterward.

=== Cuba ===
Cuba, under the rule of atheist [[Fidel Castro]], succeeded in reducing the Church's ability to work by deporting the archbishop and 150 Spanish priests, by discriminating against Catholics in public life and education and by refusing to accept them as members of the [[Communist Party of Cuba|Communist Party]].&lt;ref name="Chadwick266"/&gt; The subsequent flight of 300,000 people from the island also helped to diminish the Church there.&lt;ref name="Chadwick266"&gt;Chadwick, ''A History of Christianity'' (1995), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
In 1925, [[Rezā Shāh|Rezā Khan]] founded the [[Pahlavi dynasty|Imperial State of Iran]] and proclaimed himself shah of the country.  As part of his Westernization program, the traditional role of the ruling clergy was minimized; Islamic schools were secularized, women were forbidden to wear the [[hijab]], [[sharia]] law was abolished, and men and women were desegregated in educational and religious environments.  All this infuriated the ultraconservative clergy as a class.  Rezā Khan's son and heir [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] continued such practices. They ultimately contributed to the [[Iranian Revolution|Islamic Revolution]] of 1978–79, and the Shah's flight from his country.

When [[Ayatollah Khomeini]] took power a month after the revolution, the Shah's anticlerical measures were largely overturned, replaced by an [[Islamic Republic]] based on the principle of rule by Islamic jurists, [[Hokumat-e Islami : Velayat-e faqih (book by Khomeini)|velayat-e faqih]], where clerics serve as head of state and in many powerful governmental roles. However, by the late 1990s and 2000s anti-clericalism was reported to be significant in the [[Iran|Islamic Republic of Iran]].

According to the 1913 [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], Freemasonry was historically viewed by the Catholic Church as a principal source of anti-Clericalism,&lt;ref&gt;"From the official documents of French Masonry contained principally in the official 'Bulletin' and 'Compte-rendu' of the Grand Orient it has been proved that all the anti-clerical measures passed in the French Parliament were decreed beforehand in the Masonic lodges and executed under the direction of the Grand Orient, whose avowed aim is to control everything and everybody in France" ({{harvnb| Gruber|1909}} cites ''"Que personne ne bougera plus en France en dehors de nous", "Bull. Gr. Or.", 1890, 500 sq.'')&lt;/ref&gt; – especially in, but not limited to,&lt;ref&gt;"But in spite of the failure of the official transactions, there are a great many German and not a few American Masons, who evidently favour at least the chief anti-clerical aims of the Grand Orient party" {{harv|Gruber|1909}}&lt;/ref&gt; historically Catholic countries.

The '''Assize of Clarendon''' was an 1166 act of [[Henry II of England]] that began a transformation of [[English law]] and led to [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] in [[common law]] countries worldwide, and that established [[assize court]]s. 

Prior systems for deciding the winning party in a case, especially [[felony|felonies]], included [[trial by ordeal|trials by ordeal]], [[trial by battle|by battle]], or [[compurgation|by compurgation]] to an [[Evidence (law)|evidentiary model]], in which evidence, inspection, and inquiry was made under oath by [[laymen]], [[knight]]s or ordinary [[Franklin (class)|freemen]].  After the Assize of Clarendon [[Jury trial|trial by jury]] developed, though some historians say beginnings of the jury system predate this act.&lt;ref&gt;cf. the debate between Stubbes, Powicke and Maitland, 'The Jury of Presentment and the Assize of Clarendon', N. Hurnard (1941), ''EHR'' vol.56, no.223, pp.374-410.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Assize of Clarendon did not lead to this change immediately; recourse to trial by combat was not officially rescinded until 1819, though by then it had fallen out of use. 

The assize takes its name from [[Clarendon Palace]], [[Wiltshire]], the royal hunting lodge at which it was promulgated.

==Problems addressed by the assize==
In 1154, Henry II inherited the throne of a troubled [[England]].  In full swing were the [[Crusade]]s, a military endeavour that kept noble landowners away from their castles for years at a time. Unoccupied and unclaimed land invited squatters; since there was no central recording office for [[real property]] in England at the time, and sorting out who owned what fief was entrusted to human memory, disputes arose when aristocrats returned, or died thousands of miles from home.

Another, even more serious was the aftermath of [[The Anarchy]], a disastrous civil war between King [[Stephen of England|Stephen]] and the [[Empress Matilda]]. The two factions had hired [[mercenary]] soldiers, and when there was no one left to pay them, many resorted [[robbery]] and other forms of violence as a profession. Crime followed the breakdown of local authority.  The quarrel between the King and the Empress created more property troubles; as communities were divided, both factions were happy to reward their supporters with the lands of the local opponents. 

Finally, there was the long-standing difficulty involving the [[Catholic Church]], which culminated in the murder of [[Thomas Becket]], the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]. The problem for the King was that the Church acted like an ''[[List of Latin phrases (F–O)#I|imperium in imperio]]'', a "kingdom within a kingdom", only partially subject to Henry's laws if at all.  The church operated its own court system, which answered not to Henry but to the [[Pope]]; it was a large landowner and a powerful vested interest.  Henry wished to establish a system of justice that would enlarge the power of [[the Crown]] at the expense of the clergy.

==The assizes==
Henry therefore promulgated various [[assize]]s (i.e. courts that convened in a town periodically, rather than being permanently established). The primary and most general one, the Assize of Clarendon was issued in 1166. Others, the "petty" assizes known respectively as the assize of [[assize of novel disseisin|novel disseisin]], of [[Assize of mort d'ancestor|mort d'ancestor]], and of [[Assize of darrein presentment|darrein presentment]] gave more specific relief.&lt;ref name="Sources"&gt;Stephenson, C. &amp; Marcham, F. eds, ''Sources of English Constitutional History'', (NY:Harper &amp; Row, 1937), pp 76-81. &lt;/ref&gt; The most popular one became the ''assize of novel disseisin'', which in [[Law French]] meant something close to the "assize of recent dispossession". Those who had been recently put out of their lands could recover the beneficial use of them by resort to this assize, which led to a then innovative method of trial. Twelve "of the more lawful men"&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/history/british/middle_ages/henryii_law_01.shtml|title=BBC - History - British History in depth: Common Law - Henry II and the Birth of a State|last=Hudson|first=John|date=2011|website=|language=en-GB|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the locality were summoned by the king's sheriff to determine, upon their own knowledge, who was entitled to the property. This innovative method of proceeding, the origin of the civil [[petit jury]] at [[common law]], was aimed at the chaos introduced into property rights by crusade and civil war.  

Henry's true measure of cleverness, though, is on display in his innovations in [[criminal justice]]. Henry appointed "[[justice in eyre|justices in eyre]]," the counterpart of [[Circuit judge (UK)|circuit judge]]s, to travel from town to town. When they arrived, they too called upon the sheriff to summon twelve free men from the surrounding areas. These twelve free men were a prototype of a [[grand jury]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; They were called to report under [[oath]] any accusations of [[crime]] they were aware of in the community. In theory, then as (in the United States and Liberia) now, the grand jury only brought accusations; it did not find guilt or innocence. The crimes to be investigated were specified in the Assize of Clarendon to be robbery, murder or theft or anyone who had harboured a robber, murderer, or thief.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Helmholz|first=R.H|date=1983|title=The Early History of the Grand Jury and the Canon Law|url=|journal=The University of Chicago Law Review|volume=50|pages=613|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; To these the Assize of Northampton (1176) added counterfeiting, forgery, and arson.&lt;ref name="Sources"/&gt; Minor crimes were specifically excepted so the new assizes concerned themselves with what would later be labeled "[[felonies]]".

This new assize did away with the old form of trial known as "[[compurgation]]" in accusations brought by the grand jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schwartz|first=Helene E.|date=1972|title=Demythologizing the Historic Role of the Grand Jury|url=|journal=The American Criminal Law Review|volume=10|pages=707-709|via=HeinOnline}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under compurgation, an accused person who swore he did not commit the crime, and who found a sufficient number of his neighbours to swear that they believed him, was acquitted. Compurgation was no longer available in charges brought by the grand jury.  

The only trial available to the defendant remained the traditional [[trial by ordeal]], specifically in the Assize of Clarendon, "the ordeal of water."&lt;ref name="Sources"/&gt; Nevertheless, Henry did not put much faith in the results of the ordeal. The unfortunate [[felony|felon]] who was convicted through the ordeal was typically [[execution (legal)| executed]]. However, the [[Assize of Northampton]] (1176) provided that the loss of the right hand shall be added to a previous punishment of the loss of one foot for those who failed the ordeal.&lt;ref name="Sources"/&gt; This implies that execution was not the inevitable result of conviction. But even if the indicted culprit was ''acquitted'' in the ordeal, he was [[banishment|banished]] from the kingdom. In other words, the proceedings by the grand jury were the actual trial; everyone it accused was punished in some way, and the community was rid of the malefactor, one way or another, as adjudicated "by the oath of twelve knights of the hundred&amp;mdash;or, should knights not be present, by the oath of twelve lawful freemen."&lt;ref name="Sources"/&gt;

==Effects of the assize==
These proceedings did much to transfer power out of the hands of local [[baron]]s and into the hands of the royal [[court]] and its [[judge]]s. In 1215, moreover, the [[Fourth Lateran Council]] forbade [[clergy]]men from participating in trial by ordeal. After this date, trials after indictment by the grand jury were conducted by juries as well.

The large changes wrought in the English system of justice did not go unchallenged. The dispute over [[jurisdiction]] over the one-sixth of the population of England who were [[clergy]] was the chief grievance between the king and Becket. Disgruntled [[peerage|peers]] attempted to undo Henry's reforms by the [[Magna Carta]] forced on King [[John of England|John]], but by that time the reforms had progressed too far—and their superiority over the system they had replaced was too obvious—for the forces of reaction to gain much ground. Henry II's reforms laid the groundwork for the system of [[trial (law)|trial]]s in [[common law]].

{{Tort law}}
The '''attractive nuisance doctrine''' applies to the [[law]] of [[torts]], in the United States. It states that a [[Land tenure|landowner]] may be held [[liable]] for [[Injury|injuries]] to [[children]] [[trespass]]ing on the land if the injury is caused by an object on the land that is likely to attract children.&lt;ref name="CottenWolohan2003"/&gt;  The doctrine is designed to protect children who are unable to appreciate the risk posed by the object, by imposing a liability on the landowner.&lt;ref name="CottenWolohan2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cotten|first1=Doyice|last2=Wolohan|first2=John T.|title=Law for Recreation and Sport Managers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YO80DTGw1MEC&amp;pg=PA208|accessdate=9 November 2014|year=2003|publisher=Kendall/Hunt Publishing Company|isbn=9780787299682|pages=208–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The doctrine has been applied to hold landowners liable for injuries caused by [[abandoned car]]s, piles of [[lumber]] or [[sand]], [[trampoline]]s, and [[swimming pool]]s. However, it can be applied to virtually anything on the property of the landowner.

There is no set cut off point that defines youth. The courts will evaluate each "child" on case by case basis to see if the "child" qualifies as a youth.

If it is determined that the child was able to understand and appreciate the hazard, the doctrine of attractive nuisance will not likely apply.&lt;ref&gt;Holland V. Baltimore &amp; Ohio Railroad Co. 431 A.2d 597 (D.C. 1981).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the old [[common law]], the [[plaintiff]] (either the child, or a parent suing on the child's behalf) had to show that it was the hazardous condition itself which lured the child onto the landowner's property. However, most jurisdictions have statutorily altered this condition, and now require only that the injury was foreseeable by the landowner.

==Conditions==
According to the [[Restatement of Torts]] standard, which is followed in many jurisdictions, there are five conditions that must be met for a [[Property|land owner]] to be liable for tort damages to a child trespasser as a result of '''artificial''' hazards. 

===Elements=== 
*The place where the condition exists is one on which the possessor knows or has reason to know that children are likely to trespass, and
*The condition is one of which the possessor knows or has reason to know and which he realizes or should realize will involve an unreasonable risk of death or serious [[bodily harm]] to such children,
*The children, because of their youth, do not discover the condition or realize the risk involved in inter-meddling with it or in coming within the area made dangerous by it
*The utility to the possessor of maintaining the condition and the burden of eliminating the danger are slight as compared with the risk to children involved, and
*The possessor fails to exercise [[Duty of care|reasonable care]] to eliminate the danger or otherwise to protect the children

(See Restatement of Torts §339)

[[File:Dr James Hay as Bear Leader, 1704-1729.png|thumb|right|A caricature of a bear-leader]]
A '''bear-leader''' was formerly a man who led [[bear]]s about the country. In the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Tudor period]], these animals were chiefly used in the [[blood sport]] of [[bear-baiting]] and were led from village to village. Performing bears were also common; their keepers were generally [[French people|Frenchmen]] or [[Italian people|Italians]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Bear-Leader|volume=3|page=582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, the phrase "bear-leader" came colloquially to mean a [[tutor]] or [[Legal guardian|guardian]], who escorted any young man of rank or wealth on his travels.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911}}

'''''Between Past and Future''''' is a book written by the [[Germany|German]]-born [[Jewish]] [[Americans|American]] [[Political theory|political theorist]], [[Hannah Arendt]]. It was published for the first time in 1961 by [[The Viking Press]] in the United States and by [[Faber and Faber Ltd|Faber and Faber]] in Great Britain.  The first edition consisted of six essays, and two more were added to a 1968 revision. The book is a collection of various essays written between 1954 and 1968. The final version of the book includes essays dealing with different philosophical subjects including [[Freedom of will|freedom]], [[education]], [[authority]], [[tradition]], [[history]] and [[politics]]. The subtitle of the final version is '''''Eight Exercises in Political Thought'''''.

All of the essays share a central idea. Humans are living between the past and the uncertain future.  They must permanently think to exist, and each man is required to learn thinking. For a long time humans have resorted to tradition, but in modern times, this tradition has been abandoned, there is no more respect for tradition and culture. With her essays, Hannah Arendt tries to find solutions to help humans think again today. According to her, there is no way to live again with tradition, and modern philosophy has not succeeded in helping humans to live correctly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | contribution-url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/arendt/#WorAre | contribution = Hannah Arendt | title = [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
===Preface===
The title of the preface is ''The Gap between Past and Future''. The first sentence of the preface is a citation of French poet and [[Résistance|résistant]] [[René Char]]: "Notre héritage n'est précédé d'aucun testament," translated by Arendt herself as "our inheritance was left to us by no testament." For Arendt, this sentence perfectly illustrates the situation in which European peoples are left after the [[Second World War]].  It also illustrates the crisis in culture–the main subject of the sixth essay. Indeed, the absence of testament means the current breaking-off with tradition.

To characterize the way writers, men of letters and thinkers had lived the period of the [[French Résistance]], Hannah Arendt speaks of a "treasure." Indeed, René Char had stated during this period: "If I survive, I know that I have to break with the aroma of these essential years, silently reject my treasure." This treasure is the experience of freedom all intellectuals made during this unique period, when they left their traditional occupation, that is a life focused on their personal affairs and the quest of themselves. With the Resistance, these men had at last found themselves, they had discovered what is freedom. But with the [[Libération|Liberation]], they had lost their treasure, in other words they had either to return to their past occupations or to be involved again in public life but defending ideologies and engaging themselves into endless polemics, which had nothing to do with the time of the [[Resistance movement]].

The example of the French Resistance is one of the several historical experiences in which a treasure appears and then disappears. It was the case with the Revolutions of 1776 in the United States, 1789 in France or 1956 in Budapest. Although this treasure has no name, it was called public happiness in the United States in the eighteenth century. Any time this treasure appeared, it did not remain, not because of historical events nor chance, "but because no tradition had foreseen its appearance," no tradition or no "testament" had been able to announce the coming and the reality of this treasure. Indeed, tradition is what "selects and names, (...) hands down and preserves, (...) indicates where the treasures are and what their worth is."

===Analysis of the history of Western philosophy===
According to Arendt, the origins of European philosophical thinking date back to [[Ancient Greece]], with [[Aristotle]] and [[Plato]]. Plato had taught us that the truth was not present within the society and in public affairs, but in eternal ideas, as demonstrated in the [[allegory of the cave]]. On the contrary, [[Marx]] thought that the "truth is not outside the affairs of men and their common world but precisely in them."  The end of Platonic and Aristotelean tradition of philosophy came with Marx, according to whom the philosopher had to turn away from philosophy in order to be involved in society and human affairs in order to change the world.

{{quote |Marx's own attitude to the tradition of political thought was one of conscious rebellion. Crucial among [certain key statements containing his political philosophy] are the following: ‘Labor created man’.  ‘Violence is the midwife of every old society pregnant with a new one’, hence: violence is the midwife of history. Finally, there is the famous last thesis on Feuerbach: ‘The philosophers have only interpreted the world differently; the point is, however, to change it’, which, in the light of Marx's thought, one could render more adequately as: The philosophers have interpreted the world long enough; the time has come to change it. For this last statement is in fact only a variation  of another: ‘You cannot ''aufheben'' philosophy without realizing it’.}}

For Arendt, [[Marxist philosophy]] considers that man creates himself, that his humanity is the result of his own activity, and that what distinguishes man from [[animal]] is not [[reason]] but [[labour (economics)|labor]]. Thus Marx challenges the traditional praise of reason.  Moreover, for Marx violence is the leading force that determines human relations, while for the traditional thought it is the most disgraceful of human actions and the symbol of tyranny.

{{quote|To Marx, violence or rather the possession of the means of violence is the constituent element of all forms of government; the state is the instrument of the ruling class by means of which it oppresses and exploits, and the whole sphere of political action is characterized by the use of violence. The Marxian identification of violence with action implies another fundamental challenge of tradition.}}

'''Celine's Laws''' are a series of three laws regarding government and social interaction attributed to the fictional character [[Hagbard Celine]] from [[Robert Anton Wilson|Robert Anton Wilson's]] and [[Robert Shea|Robert Shea's]] ''[[The Illuminatus Trilogy|Illuminatus! Trilogy]]''. Celine, a gentleman [[Anarchism|anarchist]], serves as a mouthpiece for Wilson's [[Libertarianism|libertarian]], anarchist and sometimes completely uncategorizable ideas about the nature of humanity. Celine's Laws are outlined in the trilogy by a manifesto titled ''Never Whistle While You're Pissing.'' Wilson later goes on to elaborate on the laws in his nonfiction book, ''[[Prometheus Rising]]'', as being inherent consequences of average human psychology.

A piece entitled ''Celine's Laws'' appears in [[Robert Anton Wilson]]'s ''[[The Illuminati Papers]]'', which features articles written by Wilson under the guise of many of his characters from  ''[[The Illuminatus! Trilogy]]'' alongside interviews with the author himself.  One article pulls from another, as well as from the original Trilogy.

Celine, in his manifesto, recognizes these are generalities, but also says that their basic principles can be used to find the source of every great decline and fall of nations, and goes on to claim they are as universal as Newton's Laws in applying to everything.

==Celine's First Law==
{{quote|National Security is the chief cause of national insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wilson |first=Robert Anton|title=The Illuminati Papers|year=1980|isbn=978-1-57951-002-2|publisher=Ronin Publishing, Inc|page=118}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Three Surveillance cameras.jpg|thumb|right|Obsession with national security creates a surveillance state that is more a threat to the citizens than the threat it seeks to confront.]]

Reflecting the paranoia of the [[Cold War]], Celine's First Law focuses around the common idea that to have national security, one must create a [[secret police]]. Since internal revolutionaries and external foes would make the secret police a prime target for infiltration, and because the secret police would by necessity have vast powers to blackmail and intimidate other members of the government, another higher set of secret police must be created to monitor the secret police. And an even higher set of secret police must then be created to monitor the higher order of secret police. Repeat ad nauseam.

This seemingly infinite regress goes on until every person in the country is spying on another, or until "the funding runs out." And since this paranoid and self-monitoring situation inherently makes targets of a nation's own citizens, the average person in the nation is more threatened by the massive secret police complex than by whatever foe they were seeking to protect themselves from. Wilson points out that the [[Soviet Union]], which suffered from this in spades, got to the point that it was terrified of painters and poets who could do little harm to them in reality.

At the same time, given the limitation of funding and scale, the perfect security state never truly emerges, leaving the populace still vulnerable from the original threat while also being threatened by the vast and [[Orwellian]] secret police.

==Celine's Second Law==
{{quote|Accurate communication is possible only in a non-punishing situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wilson |first=Robert Anton|title=The Illuminati Papers|year=1980|isbn=978-1-57951-002-2|publisher=Ronin Publishing, Inc|page=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:US Great Seal Reverse.svg|thumb|right|Wilson uses the eye in the pyramid as a symbol of the dysfunction of hierarchies. Every level except the top is blind, but the eye can see only one way.]]

Wilson rephrases this himself many times as "communication occurs only between equals". Celine calls this law "a simple statement of the obvious" and refers to the fact that everyone who labors under an authority figure tends to lie to and flatter that authority figure in order to protect themselves either from violence or from deprivation of security (such as losing one's job). In essence, it is usually more in the interests of any worker to tell his boss what he wants to hear, not what is true.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Disorder and the Disinformation Society: The Social Dynamics of Information, Networks and Software |author=Jonathan Paul Marshall, James Goodman, Didar Zowghi, Francesca da Rimini |publisher=Routledge |year=2015 |isbn=9781317436393 |page=85–86 |chapter=Hierarchy and Managemnt as Sources of Disorder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In any hierarchy, every level below the highest carries a subtle burden to see the world in the way their superiors expect it to be seen and to provide feedback to their superiors that their superiors want to hear. In the end, any hierarchical organization supports what its leaders already think is true more than it challenges them to think differently. The levels below the leaders are more interested in keeping their jobs than telling the truth.

Wilson, in ''Prometheus Rising,'' uses the example of [[J. Edgar Hoover]]'s [[FBI]]. Hoover saw [[Communism|communist]] infiltrators and spies everywhere, and he told his agents to hunt them down. Therefore, FBI agents began seeing and interpreting everything they could as parts of the communist conspiracy. Some even went as far as framing people as communists, making largely baseless arrests and doing everything they could to satisfy Hoover's need to find and drive out the communist conspiracy. The problem is, such a conspiracy was greatly exaggerated. Hoover thought it was monolithic and pervasive, and any agent who dared point out the lack of evidence to Hoover would be at best denied promotions, and at worst labeled a communist himself and lose his job. Any agent who knew the truth would be very careful to hide the fact.

Meanwhile, the FBI was largely ignoring the problem of organized crime (the Mafia), because Hoover insisted that organized crime did not exist on the national scale.  Not only does the leader of the hierarchy see what he wants to see, but he also does not see what he does not want to see.  Agents who pursued the issue of organized crime were sometimes marginalized within the organization or hounded into retirement.

In the end, Celine states, any hierarchy acts more to conceal the truth from its leaders than it serves to find the truth.

==Celine's Third Law==
{{quote|An honest politician is a national calamity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Wilson |first=Robert Anton|title=The Illuminati Papers|year=1980|isbn=978-1-57951-002-2|publisher=Ronin Publishing, Inc|page=124}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Image:Stalin-Lenin-Kalinin-1919.jpg|thumb|right|Citing [[Lenin]] and his successors as examples, Wilson argues that the most tyrannical and brutal regimes in history were created by honest politicians who believed in a good cause.]]

Celine recognizes that the third law seems preposterous from the beginning. While a dishonest politician is interested only in bettering his own lot through abusing the public trust, an honest politician is far more dangerous since he is honestly interested in bettering society through political action, and that means writing and implementing more and more laws.

Celine argues that creating more laws simply creates more criminals. Laws inherently restrict individual [[Freedom (political)|freedom]], and the explosive rate at which laws are being created means that every citizen in the course of his daily life does not have the research capacity to not violate at least one of the plethora of laws. It is only through honest politicians trying to change the world through laws that true [[Tyrant|tyranny]] can come into being through excessive legislation.

Corrupt politicians simply line their own pockets. Honest idealist politicians cripple the people's freedom through enormous numbers of laws. So corrupt politicians are preferable according to Celine, despite the possibility of an honest politician who honestly opposes the formation of new laws (or wants to do away with some).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4179">The '''Coalition for the Prevention of Alcohol Problems''' is a [[Washington D.C.]]-based [[coalition]] of 24 public health and consumer groups co-chaired by [[George Hacker]] of the Alcohol Policies Project at the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] and Stacia Murphy of the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]].

Members include the [[Woman's Christian Temperance Union]], [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the [[American Council on Alcohol Problems]], the [[Temperance League of Kentucky]], the [[General Board of Global Ministries]] and the [[Illinois Church Action on Alcohol and Addiction Problems]], among others. Over 120 organizations now participate in the Coalition for the Prevention of Alcohol Problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/booze/CPAP/CPAPOverview.htm |title=Coalition for the Prevention of Alcohol Problems  |accessdate=2012-08-03}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Agenda ==
The group advocates raising taxes on beer, wine, and liquor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/letter-alcohol.pdf |title=CPAP Letter to Congress  |accessdate=2012-08-03}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; limiting alcohol advertising on television and radio,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asc.upenn.edu/gerbner/Asset.aspx?assetID=1287 |title=CPAP Letter to Activists  |accessdate=2012-08-03}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; and opposes alcohol advertising that may target youths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cadca.org/files/040802.pdf |title=CPAP Letter to Senator Hollings, (D) South Carolina   |accessdate=2012-08-03}} 
&lt;/ref&gt;

There are several issues which the Coalition has identified as priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/booze/CPAP/CPAPOverview.htm |title=CPAP Website, Coalition Interests   |accessdate=2012-08-03}} 
&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

# Restrictions on alcohol advertising, including:
#*  Placement of rotating health and safety messages in all alcohol advertisements.
#*  Equal time for health and safety messages in the broadcast medium.
#*  Elimination of ads that promote the association of drinking and risky activities.
#*  Reform of alcohol ads that associate drinking with sexual and social success.
#*  Restrictions on the promotional activities of alcohol companies on college campuses.

#* Disallowance of tax deductions for alcohol advertising.
# Improvements in alcoholic beverage labeling, including strengthening and expanding the current mandated warning label and providing additional consumer on alcoholic beverage containers, such as ingredients, alcohol content, calories, information about standard units of service, and a toll-free telephone number for consumer questions about alcohol.
# Increase in federal alcohol excise taxes and equalization of the tax rate on all beverage alcohol types.
# Stronger regulation of alcoholic beverage industry practices by federal agencies, including the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Trade Commission.
# Expanded research on alcohol advertising, labeling and tax issues through the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other public and private agencies.
# Promotion within the legislative and executive branches of government of a better understanding of alcohol as America's costliest and most widespread drug problem.
# Stronger demand-reduction policies related to alcohol, and proposals to expand public alcoholism treatment and prevention initiatives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10425">The '''[[European Union]]'s (EU) [[Common Commercial Policy]]''' or '''EU Trade Policy''' is the policy whereby EU member states delegate authority to the [[European Commission]] to negotiate their external trade relations, with the aim of increasing trade amongst themselves and their bargaining power vis-à-vis the rest of the world. The Common Commercial Policy is logically necessitated by the existence of the [[European Union Customs Union|Customs Union]], which in turn is also the foundation upon which the [[European Single Market|Single Market]] and [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Monetary Union]] were later established.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/636921207|title=Ever closer union: An introduction to European integration|last=Dinan|first=Desmond|date=|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2010|isbn=9780230272613|edition=4th|location=Basingstoke|pages=502-512, 529, 569|oclc=636921207|author-link=Desmond Dinan}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== History ==
The [[Inner Six|six original member states]] had signed the 1957 [[Treaty of Rome]], establishing the EU's forerunner, the [[European Economic Community]], with the aim of facilitating greater trade and investment amongst themselves and strengthening their bargaining power with outside states. As signatories to the [[General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade]] (GATT), the removal of [[Tariff|tariffs]] between them required the formation of a customs union, with a [[Common external tariff|common external tariff]] applied by all members to their trade with the rest of the world.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gstöhl|first=Sieglinde|date=2013|title=The European Union’s Trade Policy|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160527214735/http://www.ritsumei.ac.jp/acd/re/k-rsc/ras/04_publications/ria_en/11_01.pdf|journal=Ritsumeikan International Affairs|publisher=Institute of International Relations and Area Studies,  Ritsumeikan University|volume=11|pages=1-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Customs unions of the past, such as the [[Southern African Customs Union]], had relied upon a dominant partner, in that case [[South Africa]], to set the external tariff vis-à-vis the rest of the world on behalf of junior states in the arrangement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/785836288|title=The Economics of European integration|last=Baldwin|first=Richard|last2=Wyplosz|first2=Charles|date=2012|publisher=McGraw-Hill|others=|year=2012|isbn=9780077131722|edition=4|location=London|pages=327-347|oclc=785836288}}&lt;/ref&gt; In sharp contrast, the Community member states decided that they would jointly share in the management of a common external commercial policy by delegating authority to the commonly appointed [[Supranational union|supranational]] body of the [[European Commission]], and scrutinising its decisions via the common institutions they had established - namely, the [[Council of Ministers]], and later, additionally, the [[European Parliament|European Parliament.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The common commercial policy officially came into existence in July 1968 alongside the common external tariff, following the 12 year grace period for the 1957 Treaty of Rome's signatory states to align their trade policies. In practice, however, member states had sought to take advantage of their combined bargaining strength prior to this.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=LEGISSUM:a20000|title=Archived summary: EUR-Lex - a20000 - EN - EUR-Lex|last=|first=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This included the Commission concluding, a [[European Union free trade agreements|Free Trade Agreements]] (FTAs) and [[European Union Association Agreement|Association Agreements]] at the bilateral level, including, amongst others, with [[Israel]] in 1964, as well within the multilateral [[Kennedy Round]] of GATT negotiations, lasting from 1963-1967.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In the intervening decades of managing the EU's Common Commercial Policy, the European Commission has developed a deep expertise in international trade, with its [[Directorate-General for Trade]] (DG Trade) becoming one of the best staffed, and most capable negotiating teams in the world. Along with the [[United States|United States of America]], it is one of few entities able to negotiate complex trade agreements in parallel.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is has also played a key role in the development of global [[Free trade|trade liberalisation]], as a founding member of the [[World Trade Organization|World Trade Organisation]], with former European Commissioner for Competition (1985-1989) [[Peter Sutherland]] being its founding [[Director-General of the World Trade Organization|Director General]], and European Commissioner for Trade (1999-2004) [[Pascal Lamy]] later following in his footsteps.

== Accountability ==
Historically, as laid down in the 1957 Treaty of Rome, the [[European Commissioner for Trade]], acting on behalf of the European Commission, has always had to first seek approval from the member state governments in the Council of Ministers (now [[Council of the EU]]), before either taking retaliatory trade measures (e.g. anti-[[Dumping (pricing policy)|dumping]]) or conducting trade negotiations. This, has, since the inception of the Common Commercial Policy occurred by [[Voting in the Council of the European Union|qualified majority voting]], though the Council tends to act by consensus when possible.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 

The [[Treaty of Lisbon|Lisbon reform Treaty]] further clarified what was already the case by defining the Common Commercial Policy as an [[Politics of the European Union#Competencies|exclusive competency]], only to be acted upon by member states at the EU level.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== European Parliament ===
Successive treaty changes have also empowered the European Parliament in the trade realm. Today the decision-making process for the implementation of EU Common Commercial Policy is under the auspices of the [[European_Union_legislative_procedure#Ordinary_legislative_procedure|Ordinary Legislative Procedure]] (formerly called the co-decision procedure)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:12012E/TXT|title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union|last=|first=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;: 
{{Quote|text=The European Parliament and the Council, acting by means of regulations in accordance with the ordinary legislative procedure, shall adopt the measures defining the framework for implementing the common commercial policy.|sign=|source=Art. 207:2 [[TFEU]]}}
This necessitates the European Commission, in order to take any actions within the Common Commercial Policy, to first table a legislative proposal, usually drafted by DG Trade, to the relevant European Parliamentary [[Committees of the European Parliament|committees]] (the most relevant being the [[European_Parliament_Committee_on_International_Trade|International Trade Committee]]) eventually making its way to a full vote of the plenary, and simultaneously submit it to the Council of EU working parties and EU member state ministers. Both the European Parliament and the Council of the EU have powers to amend said proposal and must agree on a common final text.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Mixed Agreements ===
With global tariffs falling, and an increasingly integrated and complex Single Market, European Union member states have shown a growing appetite to conclude bilateral and multilateral agreements that do not pertain to exclusive competencies of the Union, such as agreements on [[Bilateral investment treaty|investment]] and [[intellectual property]] with third countries. Such trade deals are said to be "mixed agreements" and include the member states themselves as signatories, rather than just the EU.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Owing to a different legal basis within the EU treaties, the elements that do not fall under exclusive competency require unanimity in the Council of the EU and must be ratified by the respective constitutional arrangements of the 28 EU member states, usually requiring the consent of [[National parliaments of the European Union|national parliaments]], and depending on the issue, may include regional parliaments or even [[Referendum|referenda]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; For the elements that fall outside exclusive competencies, the European Parliament loses its amendment powers, but usually retains an overall veto via the [[European_Union_legislative_procedure#Special_legislative_procedures|Special Legislative Procedures]] laid down in the treaties for the scrutiny of [[Common Foreign and Security Policy|EU foreign relations]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Trade and Foreign Policy ===
The EU is also held to account in the way it conducts its commercial policy and general foreign relations via Article 3:5 TEU&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=celex:12012M/TXT|title=Consolidated version of the Treaty on European Union|last=|first=|date=|website=eur-lex.europa.eu|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which states that:
{{Quote|text=In its relations with the wider world, the Union shall uphold and promote its values and interests and contribute to the protection of its citizens. It shall contribute to peace, security, the sustainable development of the Earth, solidarity and mutual respect among peoples, free and fair trade, eradication of poverty and the protection of human rights, in particular the rights of the child, as well as to the strict observance and the development of international law, including respect for the principles of the United Nations Charter.|sign=|source=Art 3:5 [[Treaty on European Union|TEU]]}}
How this might influence the EU's Common Commercial Policy in the future is not year clear.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:LocationCookIslands.png|thumb|right|250px|Location of the Cook Islands]]
'''Cook Islanders''' or '''Cook Islands Māori''' are residents of the [[Cook Islands]], which is composed of 15 islands and atolls in [[Polynesia]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

== Citizenship and nationality ==
From a legal standpoint, there is no such thing as a Cook Islands [[citizenship]]. The Cook Islands is a self-governing country in [[Associated state|free association]] with [[New Zealand]] and is part of the [[Realm of New Zealand]]. As such, Cook Islanders are [[New Zealand citizen]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cook Islands Constitution Act 1964]], s 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cook Islands does not issue its own [[passport]]s, a privilege usually assumed by virtually all [[List of sovereign states|sovereign countries]], but places this responsibility in the hands of the New Zealand Government which issues [[New Zealand passport|passports for New Zealand citizens]] who are also Cook Islands nationals.

On the other hand, Cook Islands nationality is differentiated from that of the rest of the New Zealand citizens.
{{Quotation|A person shall have the status of a permanent resident of the Cook Islands if he was born in the Cook Islands, and -...
# Either or both of his parents had the status of a permanent resident of the Cook Islands at the date of his birth; or
# In the case of a child who was born after the death of his father to a mother who did not have the status at the date of birth of the child, his father had that status at the date of his death; or
# He was adopted by a person who at the date of adoption had that status|Cook Islands Constitution|Constitution Amendment (No 9) Act 1980-81|Article 76A(1)}}
These provisions setting out qualifications for the status of a permanent resident of the Cook Islands are supplemented by other legislation to regulate the granting of permanent resident status to others, qualifications to be held by a permanent resident, and conditions under which that status may be withdrawn.&lt;ref&gt;Article 76A(2)-(4)&lt;/ref&gt;

''Nationality'' in this sense may be distinguished from ''citizenship''. While it does not have distinct citizenship legislation, the Cook Islands has determined under its own laws who are its nationals and what privileges they enjoy by virtue of that status. Cook Islanders possess [[New Zealand citizenship]] with the full rights and privileges that status entails. At the same time, however, the Cook Islands has determined its own distinct nationality which, in effect, does not grant New Zealand citizens the same rights and privileges enjoyed by Cook Islanders in New Zealand.{{CN|date=October 2013}}

== Ethnicity ==
Well over 90 percent of Cook Islanders are either of full or partial descent of the native [[Polynesian people]] of the islands, who are known as Cook Islands Māori.&lt;ref&gt;CIA World Factbook, [https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/cw.html "Cook Islands: People"].&lt;/ref&gt; Cook Islands Māori share many ancestral links with the [[Māori people|Māori]] of New Zealand and the native people (Mā'ohi) of [[French Polynesia]]. Some Cook Islanders are also of other Polynesian, European ([[Papa'a]]), or Asian descent.

[[File:Copyright Card Catalog Files.jpg|thumb|right| The pre-1978 indices to the copyright records are available for public inspection at the Library of Congress.]]
The purpose of '''copyright registration''' is to place on record a verifiable account of the date and content of the work in question, so that in the event of a legal claim, or case of [[copyright infringement|infringement]] or [[plagiarism]], the [[copyright]] owner can produce a copy of the work from an official government source.

Before 1978, in the [[United States]], federal copyright was generally secured by the act of [[publication]] with notice of copyright or by registration of an unpublished work.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Circ01|Copyright Basics (Circular 1)]] p.3.&lt;/ref&gt; This has now been largely superseded by international conventions, principally the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]], which provide rights harmonized at an international level without a requirement for national registration. However, the U.S. still provides legal advantages for registering works of U.S. origin.{{specify|date=August 2013}}

==Requirement of registration==
It is a common misconception to confuse copyright registration with the granting of copyright. Copyright in most countries today is automatic on "fixation" – it applies as soon as the work is fixed in some tangible medium. This standard is established internationally by the [[Berne Convention]] (1886), which most countries have signed onto since.  Registration may be required by countries before joining Berne. For instance, the US required registration of copyrighted works before it signed onto the Berne Convention in 1989; at that point, registration was no longer required for works to be copyrighted in the US.

The observation that registration is not required in the United States, however, has been described as misleading.&lt;ref name="thos2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thomas|first1=Roger E.|author1-link=John R. Thomas (professor)|last2=Schechter|first2=John R.|title=Intellectual Property: The Law of Copyrights, Patents, and Trademarks|date=2003|publisher=Thomson/West|location=St. Paul, MN|isbn=0-314-06599-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|86–87}} This is partly because registration remains a prerequisite to filing an infringement suit,&lt;ref name="thos2003" /&gt;{{rp|87}} and also because important remedies depend on prompt registration—such as attorneys fees and [[statutory damages]].&lt;ref name="thos2003" /&gt;{{rp|90}} At least one commentator has questioned whether the conditioning of legal recourse on registration is inconsistent with the United States' obligations under the Berne Convention regarding "formalities".&lt;ref name="thos2003" /&gt;{{rp|90&amp;nbsp;n.11}}

==Scholarship on reinstating registration requirements==
Some scholars and policy advocates (such as law professor and activist [[Lawrence Lessig]] and U.S. [[Zoe Lofgren|Representative Zoe Lofgren]]) have called for returning to a system of registration requirements and possibly other formalities such as [[copyright notice]].  The system of automatic copyright on fixation has been cited as one of the factors behind the growth of so-called "[[orphan works]]" in, for instance, the [[U.S. Copyright Office]]'s 2006 report on orphan works.&lt;ref&gt;United States Copyright Office, [http://www.copyright.gov/docs/regstat030806.html Copyright Office's Report on Orphan Works] (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  UC Berkeley's Law School held a conference in 2013 on the question of "Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age?", noting that &lt;blockquote&gt;"Formalities, which in the past three decades have largely disappeared from American copyright law, may be about to stage a comeback. ... [R]ecent research on formalities suggests that we can get many of the benefits that formalities promise for a more efficient and focused copyright law, without the problems that led us to do away with them in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.berkeley.edu/formalities.htm "Reform(aliz)ing Copyright for the Internet Age?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502015326/http://www.law.berkeley.edu/formalities.htm |date=2013-05-02 }}, [[Berkeley School of Law]], April 18–19, 2013, Claremont Hotel, Berkeley CA.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Registering agencies==
*In Canada, copyrighted works can be registered at the Canadian Intellectual Property Office for a fee.&lt;ref name="CIPO - Canadian Copyright Registration"&gt;{{cite web|title=A Guide to Copyright|url=http://www.cipo.ic.gc.ca/eic/site/cipointernet-internetopic.nsf/eng/h_wr02281.html|accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In Kenya, copyrighted works can be registered at the Kenya Copyrights Board for a small fee.{{cn|date=September 2018}}
*In the United Kingdom, there is no official registration regime for copyrights. Commercial services provide a registration facility where copies of work can be lodged to establish legal evidence of a copyright claim. There are also requirements to file certain published works with the [[British Library]] and, on request, the five [[national library|legal deposit libraries]].{{cn|date=September 2018}}
*In the United States, the [[United States Copyright Office]] accepts registrations. For works created in the US by US citizens, a registration is also required before an infringement suit may be filed in a US court. Furthermore, copyright holders cannot claim [[statutory damages for copyright infringement|statutory damages]] or [[attorney's fee]]s unless the work was registered prior to infringement, or within three months of publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Circ01|Copyright Basics (Circular 1)]] p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Finding copyright registrations==
All United States copyright registrations and renewals registered since 1978 have been published online at the
[https://www.loc.gov Copyright Office website]. Registrations and renewals prior to 1978&lt;ref&gt;''Copyright and the Public Domain'' page 11-10; Stephen Fishman - Law Journal Press (2008); {{ISBN|978-1-58852-151-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; were published in semi-annual softcover [[Copyright Catalog]]s. For films from 1894 to 1969, inclusive, [[Library of Congress]] published hardcover '''''Cumulative Copyright Catalogs''''', each covering ten or more years.

Please see the [[Copyright Catalog]] article for links to download digital copies of these pre-1978 US catalogs.

{{UStaxation}}
The '''crack tax''' was the name given to the taxes on illegal drugs in Tennessee. The tax, under a law passed by the [[Tennessee General Assembly]] in January 2005, was applied to illegal substances including cocaine, marijuana, and moonshine. Drug dealers were required to pay anonymously at the state revenue office, where they received a stamp to prove their payment. If a drug dealer was arrested without having a stamp, the state would seek the money owed it.&lt;ref name="Tennessean2009-09-07"&gt;{{cite news|first=Sheila|last=Burke|title='Crack tax' struck down by state appeals court|publisher=''The Tennessean''|date=September 7, 2007|url=http://tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070907/NEWS03/70907021|accessdate=September 15, 2007}}{{Dead link|date=February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NC5"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court: Taxing Illegal Drugs Is Unconstitutional |url=http://www.newschannel5.com/story/7044396/court-taxing-illegal-drugs-is-unconstitutional |accessdate=September 14, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131141658/http://www.newschannel5.com/story/7044396/court-taxing-illegal-drugs-is-unconstitutional |archivedate=January 31, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the Tennessee Supreme Court judged in a 3-2 ruling that the Crack Tax is unconstitutional, and repealed it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_155500.asp |title=Supreme Court Rules Statute Taxing Unauthorized Substances Unconstitutional |date=July 24, 2009 |work=The Chattanoogan |accessdate=January 18, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120117230632/http://www.chattanoogan.com/articles/article_155500.asp |archivedate=2012-01-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Challenge and repeal==
Steven Waters sought to challenge the statute after [[Tennessee Department of Revenue]] agents decided to seize his home in a drug sting operation. A county court found the law unconstitutional because it violated the drug dealer's [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fifth Amendment]] right to protection from self-incrimination. The [[Tennessee Court of Appeals]] upheld the lower court's decision, unanimously declaring the law to be "arbitrary, capricious and unreasonable, and therefore invalid under the constitution of this state."&lt;ref name="AP_Wire"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=20070908&amp;id=EQJZAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BkYNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3034,4705060&amp;hl=en|title=Court Finds 'Crack Tax' Unconstitutional|last=Nashville|first=Tenn|date=September 8, 2007|website=|accessdate=September 15, 2007|agency=AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; The opinion was written by Judge Sharon G. Lee.&lt;ref name="AP_Wire"/&gt;

Governor [[Phil Bredesen]] stated on September 14, 2007 that the crack tax should be ended, though State Revenue Commissioner Reagan Farr has said that the state will continue to enforce the tax. A meeting was planned by officials with the state attorney general to determine whether to appeal to the [[Tennessee Supreme Court]].&lt;ref name="Tennessean2007-09-14"&gt;{{cite news|first=Erik|last=Shelzig|title=Bredesen has doubts about tax on illegal drugs|publisher=''The Tennessean''|date=September 14, 2007|url=http://www.tennessean.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20070914/NEWS0201/709140404/1009/RSS0102|accessdate=September 15, 2007}}{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2005, Tennessee had collected more than $6 million from the crack tax, much of which came from confiscated property. In 2006 alone, the state collected $1.8 million.&lt;ref name="NC5"/&gt;

'''Customs''' is an [[authority]] or [[Government agency|agency]] in a country responsible for collecting [[tariff]]s and for controlling the flow of goods, including animals, transports, personal, and [[hazard]]ous items, into and out of a country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.wordreference.com/definition/customs|title= customs|publisher= [[WordReference]] |accessdate= 2013-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of people into and out of a country is normally monitored by [[international migration|migration]] authorities, under a variety of names and arrangements. [[Immigration]] authorities normally check for appropriate documentation, verify that a person is entitled to enter the country, apprehend people wanted by domestic or international [[arrest warrant]]s, and impede the entry of people deemed dangerous to the country. Compare [[illegal emigration]].

Each country has its own laws and regulations for the [[international trade|import]] and [[export]] of goods into and out of a country, which its customs authority enforces. The import or export of some goods may be restricted or forbidden.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 1992"&gt;
Chowdhury, F. L. (1992) Evasion of Customs Duty in Bangladesh, unpublished MBA dissertation submitted to Monash University, Australia.
&lt;/ref&gt;  
In most countries, customs are attained through government agreements and international laws.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}} A [[customs duty]] is a [[tariff]] or [[tax]] on the importation (usually) or exportation (unusually) of goods.  
Commercial goods not yet cleared through customs are held in a [[customs area]], often called a [[bonded warehouse|bonded store]], until processed. All authorized [[port]]s are recognized customs areas.

At airports, customs functions as the [[point of no return]] for all passengers; once passengers have cleared customs, they cannot go back.

In many countries, customs procedures for arriving passengers at many international airports and some road crossings are separated into red and green channels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dual-Channel System (Customs Clearance)|url = http://www.ica.gov.sg/page.aspx?pageid=98#red-or-green|website=Ica.gov.sg|accessdate = 2015-09-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toll.no/upload/Dokumenter/brosjyrer_veiledere/Reisende_ENG.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319202853/http://www.toll.no/upload/Dokumenter/brosjyrer_veiledere/Reisende_ENG.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=19 March 2009|title=Wayback Machine|date=19 March 2009|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Passengers with goods to declare (carrying goods above the permitted customs limits and/or carrying prohibited items) go through the red channel. Passengers with nothing to declare (carrying goods within the permitted customs limits and not carrying prohibited items) go through the green channel. However, entry into a particular channel constitutes a legal declaration, if a passenger going through the green channel is found to be carrying goods above the customs limits or prohibited items, he or she may be prosecuted for making a false declaration to customs, by virtue of having gone through the green channel. Each channel is a point of no return, once a passenger has entered a particular channel, they cannot go back.

[[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]], and the [[United States]] do not officially operate a red and green channel system; however, some airports copy this layout.

===Blue channel===
Airports in EU countries such as [[Finland]], [[Ireland]] or the United Kingdom, also have a blue channel. As the EU is a [[customs union]], travellers between EU countries do not have to pay customs duties. Value-added tax and excise duties may be applicable if the goods are subsequently sold, but these are collected when the goods are sold, not at the border. Passengers arriving from other EU countries go through the blue channel, where they may still be subject to checks for prohibited or restricted goods. [[Bag tag|Luggage tickets]] for checked luggage travelling within the EU are green-edged so they may be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/customs_controls/baggage_controls/index_en.htm#exit|title=EUROPA - Taxation and Customs Union / Baggage controls|publisher=Ec.europa.eu|date=2007-02-21|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/images/etiquette_verte.gif |title=Archived copy |access-date=2007-01-19 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328205916/http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/resources/images/etiquette_verte.gif |archive-date=2007-03-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In most EU member states, travellers coming from other EU countries can simply use the green lane.

===Red point phone===
All airports in the United Kingdom operate a channel system, however some don't have a red channel, they instead have a red point phone which serves the same purpose.

==Privatization of customs==
[[File:Orrling of CentralHFA 15.jpg|thumb|The Customs-and-duty House at the [[port of Haifa]], Israel ]]
Customs is part of one of the three basic functions of a government, namely: administration; maintenance of law, order, and justice; and collection of revenue. However, in a bid to mitigate corruption, many countries have partly privatised their customs. This has occurred by way of contracting pre-shipment inspection agencies, which examine the cargo and verify the declared value before importation occurs. The country's customs is obliged to accept the agency's report for the purpose of assessing duties and taxes at the port of entry.

While engaging a pre-shipment inspection agency may appear justified in a country with an inexperienced or inadequate customs establishment, the measure has not been able to plug the loophole and protect revenue. It has been found that evasion of customs duty escalated when pre-shipment agencies took over.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2006"&gt;Chowdhury, F. L. (2006) Corrupt bureaucracy and privatization of Customs in Bangladesh, Pathok Samabesh, Dhaka.&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been alleged that involvement of such agencies has caused shipping delays.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 1992"/&gt; Privatization of customs has been viewed as a fatal remedy.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2006"/&gt;

==Summary of basic custom rules==

===European Union===
The basic [[customs law]] is harmonized across Europe within the [[European Union Customs Union]]. This includes customs duties and restrictions. Customs tax from €22 to €150. In addition, see regulations of each member state.

For customs declarations in the EU and in Switzerland, Norway and Iceland, the "[[Single Administrative Document]]" (SAD) is used as a basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/customs/procedural_aspects/general/sad/index_en.htm|title=The single administrative document (SAD) - Taxation and customs union - European Commission|website=Taxation and customs union|accessdate=31 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
Up to €22, there are no taxes. From €22 up to €150, it is necessary to pay VAT (EUSt in Germany), which is 7% or 19% depending on the goods. From €150 it is necessary to pay VAT and customs.

====Romania====
Customs may be very strict, especially for goods shipped from anywhere outside the EU. Up to €10 goods/package.

====Italy====
Customs in Italy takes additional 22% VAT (Value-added tax) for goods imported from outside the European Union even if the VAT is already paid to the origin country sender.

====Czech Republic and Slovakia====
Up to €22, there are no taxes. From €22 up to €150, it is necessary to pay VAT (DPH in Czech/Slovak), which is 21%. From €150, it is necessary to pay VAT and customs. Customs may range from zero to 10% depending on the type of imported goods.

===North America===

====United States====
The United States imposes tariffs or "customs duties" on imports of goods: 3% on average.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fita.org/countries/us.html|title=Federation of International Trade Associations, country profile: United States|publisher=Fita.org|accessdate=2012-01-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The duty is levied at the time of import and is paid by the [[importer of record]]. Individuals arriving in the United States may be exempt from duty on a limited amount of purchases, and on goods temporarily imported (such as laptop computers) under the [[ATA Carnet]] system. Customs duties vary by country of origin and product, with duties ranging from zero to 81% of the value of the goods. Goods from many countries are exempt from duty under various trade agreements. Certain types of goods are exempt from duty regardless of source. Customs rules differ from other import restrictions. Failure to comply with customs rules can result in seizure of goods and civil and criminal penalties against involved parties. The [[U.S. Customs and Border Protection]] (CBP) enforces customs rules. All goods entering the United States are subject to inspection by CBP prior to legal entry.

===South America===
===Argentina===
Customs may be very strict. Up to u$300 overall, there are no taxes. From u$300 to u$1500, tax is 50% of the value of all acquired goods sumed up.

=="Magic mail"==
[[Sebastián Marroquín|Juan Pablo Escobar]] writes, in ''My Father Pablo Escobar'', "At the time [[Pablo Escobar]] was trafficking cocaine, Colombia's major airports had what was known as "magic mail", a sort of parallel customs system that made it possible to bring anything into the country without leaving a paper trail – in exchange for a fat bribe."

[[File:Defensive gun use training - Prague Cech Republic.jpg|thumb|450px|A woman trains real-life defensive gun use scenarios with live ammunition at a video shooting range in Prague, Czech Republic.]]

'''Defensive gun use''' ('''DGU''') is the use or presentation of a firearm for [[self-defense]], [[defense of others]] or in some cases, protecting property. The frequency of incidents involving DGU, and their effectiveness in providing safety and reducing crime is a controversial issue in [[gun politics]] and criminology.&lt;ref name="hlw"&gt;[[Harry L. Wilson]], ''Guns, Gun Control, And Elections: The Politics And Policy of Firearms'', {{ISBN|0742553485}}, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|64}} Different authors and studies employ different criteria for what constitutes a defensive gun use which leads to controversy in comparing statistical results. Perceptions of  defensive gun use are recurring themes in discussions over [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]], [[gun control]], [[armed police]], [[Open carry in the United States|open]] and [[concealed carry]] of firearms.

Estimates over the number of defensive gun uses vary wildly, depending on the study's definition of a defensive gun use, survey design, population, criteria, time-period studied, and other factors. Low-end estimates are in the range of 55,000 to 80,000 incidents per year, while high end estimates reach of 4.7 million per year. Discussion over the number and nature of DGU and the implications to gun control policy came to a head in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asc41.com/Criminologist/2000/January-February%202000.htm Otis Dudley Duncan, "Gun Use Surveys: In Numbers We Trust?"], ''Criminologist'', v25 n1, Jan/Feb 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSPOF" /&gt;

Estimates of DGU from the [[National Crime Victimization Survey]] (NCVS) are consistently lower than those from other studies. A 2000 study suggested that this may be because the NCVS measures different activities than the other surveys do.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDowall|first1=David|last2=Loftin|first2=Colin|last3=Presser|first3=Stanley|journal=Journal of Quantitative Criminology|date=2000|volume=16|issue=1|pages=1–19|doi=10.1023/A:1007588410221|title=Measuring Civilian Defensive Firearm Use: A Methodological Experiment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[National Self-Defense Survey]] and the NCVS, vary in their methods, time-frames covered, and questions asked.&lt;ref&gt;[[Committee on Law and Justice]], ''Firearms and Violence: A Critical Review'' (2004) {{ISBN|0-309-09124-1}}, page 103.&lt;/ref&gt;  DGU questions were asked of all the NSDS sample.&lt;ref name="kleck j crim l" /&gt; Due to screening questions in the NCVS survey, only a minority of the NCVS sample were asked a DGU question.&lt;ref name="NSPOF"&gt;[https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf [[Philip J. Cook]] and [[Jens Ludwig (economist)|Jens Ludwig]], "Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms"], NIJ Research in Brief, May 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lower-end estimates include that by [[David Hemenway]], a professor of Health Policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, which estimated approximately 55,000–80,000 such uses each year.&lt;ref name="hemenway chance"&gt;[https://stat.duke.edu/~dalene/chance/chanceweb/103.myth0.pdf David Hemenway, ''Chance'', Vol 10, No. 3, 1997.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hemenway northwestern"&gt;[http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6936&amp;context=jclc Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (Northwestern) 87 (1997): 1430.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another survey including DGU questions was the National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms, NSPOF, conducted in 1994 by the Chiltons polling firm for the Police Foundation on a research grant from the National Institute of Justice.   in 1997 NSPOF projected 4.7 million DGU per year by 1.5 million individuals after weighting to eliminate false positives.&lt;ref name="NSPOF" /&gt;
Another estimate has estimated approximately 1 million DGU incidents in the United States.&lt;ref name="hlw" /&gt;{{rp|65}}&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

===Kleck and Gertz, and Cook and Ludwig===
A commonly cited 1995 study by [[Gary Kleck|Kleck]] and [[Marc Gertz|Gertz]] estimated that between 2.1 and 2.5 million DGUs occur in the United States each year.&lt;ref name="hlw" /&gt;{{rp|64–65}}&lt;ref name="kleck j crim l"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kleck | first1 = Gary | last2 = Gertz | first2 = Marc | year = 1995 | title = Armed Resistance to Crime: The Prevalence and Nature of Self-Defense with a Gun | url = | journal = J.

Schulman, Guns, Crimes and Self-defense, Orange County Reg., Sept. 19, 1993, at 3.&lt;/ref&gt; After Kleck and Gertz accounted for [[telescoping effect|telescoping]], their estimate was reduced to 2.1 million DGU per year.&lt;ref name="kleck j crim l"/&gt; Kleck and Gertz conducted this survey in 1992, and Kleck began publicizing the 2.5 million DGU per year estimate in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=David|title=Survey Research and Self-Defense Gun Use: An Explanation of Extreme Overestimates|journal=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology|date=1997|volume=87|issue=4|page=1430|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6936&amp;context=jclc}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1997, the 2.5 million per year number from Kleck &amp; Gertz' study had been cited as fact by news articles, editorial writers, and the [[Congressional Research Service]].&lt;ref name=jpam/&gt; Besides the NSDS and NCVS surveys, ten national and three state surveys summarized by Kleck and Gertz gave 764 thousand to 3.6 million DGU per year.&lt;ref name="kleck j crim l" /&gt; In the report "Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms" by Philip J. Cook and Jens  Ludwig, projected 4.7 million DGU which Cook and Ludwig explained by pointing out all of the NSPOF sample were asked the DGU question. Cook and Ludwig also compared the U.S. crime rate to the number of DGU reported by Kleck and similar studies and said that their estimate of DGU is improbably high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guns in America: National Survey on Private Ownership and Use of Firearms|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/165476.pdf|publisher=US  Dept. of Justice, Office of Justice Programs, National Institute  of Justice|author=Cook, Philip J.|author2=Ludwig, Jens|date=May 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Kleck and Gertz' and Lott's research are highly controversial within the academic community. Hemenway has asserted that Kleck and Gertz' methodology suffers from several biases leading them to overestimate the number of DGU, including [[Telescoping effect|telescoping]], the [[social desirability bias]], and the possibility that "some gun advocates will lie to help bias estimates upwards."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/magazine/story/2015/01/defensive-gun-ownership-myth-114262.html#.VOUaccakQvc|title=The Myth Behind Defensive Gun Ownership|author=Evan DeFilippis and Devin Hughes|work=POLITICO Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hemenway contends the Kleck and Gertz study is unreliable and no conclusions can be drawn from it.&lt;ref name="hemenway chance" /&gt; He argues that there are too many "false positives" in the surveys, and finds the NCVS figures more reliable, yielding estimates of around 100,000 defensive gun uses per year. Applying different adjustments, other social scientists suggest that between 250,000 and 370,000 incidences per year.&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scholarlycommons.law.northwestern.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=6938&amp;context=jclc |title=A Call for a Truce in the DGU War |author=Smith, Tom W.|date=1997 |publisher=Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology (Northwestern)|volume=87|page=1462}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-12-27/how-often-do-we-use-guns-in-self-defense |title=How Often Do We Use Guns in Self-Defense? |author=Paul Barrett |date=27 December 2012 |publisher=''[[Bloomberg Businessweek]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, Cook and Ludwig reported that based on their analysis of the National Survey of Private Ownership of Firearms, which "incorporated a sequence of DGU questions very similar to that used by Kleck and Gertz," they estimated that 4.7 million defensive gun uses occur in the United States per year. However, they questioned whether this estimate was credible because the same survey suggests that approximately 132,000 perpetrators were either wounded or killed at the hands of armed civilians in 1994. They note that this number is about the same as the number of people hospitalized for gunshot injuries that year, but that "almost all of those are there as a result of criminal assault, suicide attempt, or accident."&lt;ref name=jpam&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Philip J.|last2=Ludwig|first2=Jens|last3=Hemenway|first3=David|title=The gun debate's new mythical number: How many defensive uses per year?|journal=Journal of Policy Analysis and Management|date=Summer 1997|volume=16|issue=3|pages=463–469|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1520-6688(199722)16:3&lt;463::AID-PAM6&gt;3.0.CO;2-F|url=http://home.uchicago.edu/ludwigj/papers/JPAM_Cook_Ludwig_Hemenway_2007.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|464–5}}

Kleck asserts errors in his critics' statements that his survey's estimates of defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved a wounding of the offender, are implausibly large compared to estimates of the total numbers of such crimes. The total number of nonfatal gunshot woundings, whether medically treated or not, is unknown, and no meaningful estimates can be derived from his survey regarding defensive gun uses linked with specific crime types, or that involved wounding the offender, because the sample sizes are too small. The fact that some crime-specific estimates derived from the Kleck survey are implausibly large is at least partly a reflection of the small samples on which they are based - no more than 196 cases. Kleck states that his estimate of total defensive gun uses was based on nearly 5,000 cases. Thus, he argues, the implausible character of some estimates of small ''subsets'' of defensive gun uses is not a valid criticism of whether estimates of the ''total'' number of defensive gun uses are implausible or too high.&lt;ref name="Kleck, G 2001"&gt;Kleck, G. and D. Kates (2001), Armed: New Perspectives on Gun Control, Chapter 6.  N.Y.: Prometheus&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marvin Wolfgang]], who was acknowledged in 1994 by the ''British Journal of Criminology'' as ″the most influential criminologist in the English-speaking world″,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/04/18/us/marvin-e-wolfgang-73-dies-leading-figure-in-criminology.html | title=Marvin E.

[...] The Kleck and Gertz study impresses me for the caution the authors exercise and the elaborate nuances they examine methodologically. I do not like their conclusions that having a gun can be useful, but I cannot fault their methodology. They have tried earnestly to meet all objections in advance and have done exceedingly well."&lt;ref&gt;Marvin E. Wolfgang, A Tribute to a View I Have Opposed, 86 J. Crim.

A 1998 study by [[Philip J. Cook|Philip Cook]] and [[Jens Ludwig (economist)|Jens Ludwig]] replicated the Kleck and Gertz survey, but also concluded that the results of these surveys were far too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar conclusion was reached by a 2018 [[RAND Corporation]] report, which stated that the Kleck-Gertz estimate of 2.5 million DGUs per year, and other similar estimates, "are not plausible given other information that is more trustworthy, such as the total number of U.S. residents who are injured or killed by guns each year." The same report also stated that "At the other extreme, the NCVS estimate of 116,000 DGU incidents per year almost certainly underestimates the true number," concluding that "... there is still considerable uncertainty about the prevalence of DGU".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rand.org/pubs/research_reports/RR2088.html |title=The Science of Gun Policy |last=Morral |first=Andrew R. |date=2018 |website=RAND Corporation |language=en |access-date=2018-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|280}}

===National Crime Victimization Survey===
A 1994 study examined NCVS data and concluded that between 1987 and 1990, there were approximately 258,460 incidents in which firearms were used defensively in the United States, for an annual average of 64,615. The same study said that "Firearm self-defense is rare compared with gun crimes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDowall|first1=D|last2=Wiersema|first2=B|title=The incidence of defensive firearm use by US crime victims, 1987 through 1990.|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=December 1994|volume=84|issue=12|pages=1982–1984|doi=10.2105/AJPH.84.12.1982|pmid=7998641|pmc=1615397}}&lt;/ref&gt; An article published by the Bureau of Justice Statistics, drawing its DGU from the NCVS, said: "In 1992 offenders armed with handguns committed a record 931,000 violent crimes ... On average in 1987-92 about 83,000 crime victims per year used a firearm to defend themselves or their property. Three-fourths of the victims who used a firearm for defense did so during a violent crime; a fourth, during a theft, household burglary, or motor vehicle theft."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rand|first=Michael R.|title=Guns and Crime: Handgun Victimization, Firearm Self Defense, and Firearm Theft|url=http://bjs.ojp.usdoj.gov/content/pub/ascii/hvfsdaft.txt|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice, Office of Justice Programs,Bureau of Justice Statistics|accessdate=11 November 2012|date=April 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study, also released by the BJS, found that less than 1% of nonfatal violent crime victims during the 2007-2011 period reported using a gun to defend themselves. The same study reported that "The percentage of nonfatal violent victimizations involving firearm use in self defense remained stable at under 2% from 1993 to 2011.", reporting 235,700 instances of defensive use of a firearm between 2007-2011&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bjs.gov/content/pub/pdf/fv9311.pdf |title=Firearm Violence, 1993-2011 |last=Planty |first=Michael |website=Bureau of Justice Statistics |publication-date=May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|12}}

Cook and Ludwig said of the NCVS, NSPOF, and Kleck surveys: "The key explanation for the difference between the 108,000 NCVS estimate for the annual number of defensive gun uses and the several million from the surveys discussed earlier is that NCVS avoids the false-positive problem by limiting defensive gun use questions to persons who first reported that they were crime victims. Most NCVS respondents never have a chance to answer the defensive gun use question, falsely or otherwise."&lt;ref name="NSPOF"/&gt;

[[Clayton Cramer]] and David Barnett say that such a structure could cause the NCVS to under-count defensive gun uses, because someone who has successfully defended themselves with a gun may not consider themselves a "victim of a crime." In the NCVS, if one says that they have not been a victim of a crime, the survey assumes that there was no attempted crime and does not go on to ask if they have used a gun in self-defense.&lt;ref name="CATO"&gt;[http://www.cato.org/sites/cato.org/files/pubs/pdf/WP-Tough-Targets.pdf Clayton Cramer and David Barnett, "Tough Targets: When Criminals Face Resistance From Citizens"] CATO Institute, 2012, p.8&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Jens Ludwig (economist)|Jens Ludwig]], estimates of the frequency of DGU from the NCVS appear to be too low, but those from phone surveys (like that conducted by Kleck and Gertz) appear to be too high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Gun Self-Defense and Deterrence | author=Ludwig, Jens | journal=Crime and Justice | year=2000 | volume=27 | pages=363–417 | doi=10.1086/652203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Lott]], an economist and guns rights advocate, argues in both ''[[More Guns, Less Crime]]'' and ''[[The Bias Against Guns]]'' that media coverage of defensive gun use is rare, noting that in general, only shootings ending in fatalities are discussed in news stories. In ''More Guns, Less Crime'', Lott writes that "[s]ince in many defensive cases a handgun is simply brandished, and no one is harmed, many defensive uses are never even reported to the police".

Attempting to quantify this phenomenon, in the first edition of the book, published in May 1998, Lott wrote that "national surveys" suggested that "98 percent of the time that people use guns defensively, they merely have to brandish a weapon to break off an attack." The higher the rate of defensive gun uses that do not end in the attacker being killed or wounded, the easier it is to explain why defensive gun uses are not covered by the media without reference to media bias. Lott cited the figure frequently in the media, including publications like the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref name="Lott98WSJ"&gt;{{Cite news|first=John R. |last=Lott, Jr. |title=Keep Guns out of Lawyers' Hands |publisher=Wall Street Journal |page=1 |date=1998-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Lott98LAT"&gt;{{Cite news|first=John R. |last=Lott, Jr. |title=Cities Target Gun Makers in Bogus Lawsuits |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |page=7 |date=1998-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, he repeated the survey, and reported that brandishing a weapon was sufficient to stop an attack 95% of the time. Other researchers criticized his methodology, saying that his sample size of 1,015 respondents was too small for the study to be accurate and that the majority of similar studies suggest a value between 70 and 80 percent brandishment-only.&lt;ref name="2002studycriticism"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McDowall |first=David |date=Summer 2005 |journal=[[Public Opinion Quarterly]] |title=John R. Lott, Jr.'s Defensive Gun Brandishing Estimates |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=246–263 |doi=10.1093/poq/nfi015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lott explained the lower brandishment-only rates found by others was at least in part due to the different questions that were asked.&lt;ref name="GenSurveys" &gt;[http://www.johnlott.org/files/GeneralDisc97_02Surveys.zip Discussion of different surveys on defensive gun use.]&lt;/ref&gt;  Most surveys used a recall period of "Ever" while some (Hart, Mauser, and Tarrance) used the previous five years. The Field Institute survey used periods of previous year, previous two years and ever.&lt;ref name="kleck j crim l" /&gt; The NSPOF survey used a one-year recall period.&lt;ref name="NSPOF" /&gt;  Lott also used a one-year recall period and asked respondents about personal experiences only, due to questionable respondent recall of events past one year and respondent knowledge of DGU experiences of other household members.&lt;ref name="GenSurveys" /&gt;

===Hemenway research===
In 2000, Hemenway published a survey which found that "Guns are used to threaten and intimidate far more often than they are used in self defense";&lt;ref name=ip&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=D|title=Gun use in the United States: results from two national surveys|journal=Injury Prevention|date=1 December 2000|volume=6|issue=4|pages=263–267|doi=10.1136/ip.6.4.263|pmid=11144624|pmc=1730664}}&lt;/ref&gt; also that year, he published another survey which found that "criminal gun use is far more common than self-defense gun use."&lt;ref name=vav&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=D|last2=Azrael|first2=D|authorlink2=Deborah Azrael|title=The relative frequency of offensive and defensive gun uses: results from a national survey.|journal=Violence and Victims|date=2000|volume=15|issue=3|pages=257–72|pmid=11200101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these surveys argued that many defensive gun uses may not be in the best interests of society.&lt;ref name=ip/&gt;&lt;ref name=vav/&gt; Also in 2000, Hemenway and his colleagues conducted a small survey that found that guns in the home were used more often to intimidate family members (13 respondents) than in self-defense (2 respondents). The same study stated that its results suggested that most self-defense gun uses did not occur in the home, and that non-gun weapons are used more often to thwart crime than guns are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azrael|first1=Deborah|last2=Hemenway|first2=David|title=‘In the safety of your own home’: results from a national survey on gun use at home|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=January 2000|volume=50|issue=2|pages=285–291|doi=10.1016/S0277-9536(99)00283-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; A later survey by Hemenway et al. that included 5,800 California adolescents found that about 0.3% of these adolescents reported having used a gun in self-defense, whereas, in the same study, 4% of those adolescents reported that someone had threatened them with a gun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=David|last2=Miller|first2=Matthew|title=Gun Threats Against and Self-defense Gun Use by California Adolescents|journal=Archives of Pediatrics &amp; Adolescent Medicine|date=1 April 2004|volume=158|issue=4|pages=395|doi=10.1001/archpedi.158.4.395}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2015 study co-authored with Sara Solnick, Hemenway analyzed data from the NCVS from 2007 to 2011 and identified only 127 instances of DGU.&lt;ref name=pm&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hemenway|first1=D|last2=Solnick|first2=SJ|title=The epidemiology of self-defense gun use: evidence from the National Crime Victimization Surveys 2007-2011.|journal=Preventive Medicine|date=October 2015|volume=79|pages=22–7|pmid=25910555|doi=10.1016/j.ypmed.2015.03.029}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
A study published in 2013 by the [[Violence Policy Center]], using five years of nationwide statistics (2007-2011) compiled by the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] found that defensive gun uses occur an average of 67,740 times per year.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vpc.org/studies/justifiable.pdf, retrieved 10/29/2014&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2004 study surveyed the records of a [[Phoenix, Arizona]] newspaper, as well as police and court records, and found a total of 3 instances of defensive gun use over a 3.5 month period. In contrast, Kleck and Gertz's study would predict that the police should have noticed more than 98 DGU killings or woundings and 236 DGU firings at adversaries during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Denton|first1=JF|last2=Fabricius|first2=WV|title=Reality check: using newspapers, police reports, and court records to assess defensive gun use.|journal=Injury prevention : journal of the International Society for Child and Adolescent Injury Prevention|date=April 2004|volume=10|issue=2|pages=96–8|pmid=15066974|pmc=1730063|doi=10.1136/ip.2003.003947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1995 study led by [[Arthur Kellermann]], which examined 198 home invasion crimes in [[Atlanta]], Georgia, found that in only 3 of these cases did victims use guns for self-protection. Of these three, none were injured, but one lost property. The authors concluded that "Although firearms are often kept in the home for protection, they are rarely used for this purpose."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kellermann|first1=AL|last2=Westphal|first2=L|last3=Fischer|first3=L|last4=Harvard|first4=B|title=Weapon involvement in home invasion crimes.|journal=JAMA|date=14 June 1995|volume=273|issue=22|pages=1759–62|pmid=7769769|doi=10.1001/jama.1995.03520460041032}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A followup study in 1998 by Arthur Kellermann analyzed 626 shootings in three cities.  The study found that "For every time a gun in the home was used in a self-defense or legally justifiable shooting, there were four unintentional shootings, seven criminal assaults or homicides, and 11 attempted or completed suicides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Kellermann |first1=AL |last2= Somes |first2=G |last3= Rivara |first3=FP |last4=Lee |first4=RK |last5= Banton |first5=JG |title= Injuries and deaths due to firearms in the home |journal=Journal of Trauma and Acute Care Surgery |date= Aug 1998 |volume=45 |issue=2 |pages= 263–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Gun Violence Archive]], which uses a methodology of counting incidents reported and verified by law enforcement or media, reports substantially lower numbers of defensive gun use in the US than studies based on polls.  1,980 and 2,043 incidents were reported and verified in 2016 and 2017, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Past Summary Ledgers |publisher= Gun Violence Archive |url= http://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls |accessdate= 1 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==
The same data indicating that DGU against criminals is uncommon also indicates that it is often effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McDOWALL|first1=D.|title=Firearms and Self-Defense|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|date=1 May 1995|volume=539|issue=1|pages=130–140|doi=10.1177/0002716295539001010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2002 study looking at instances of DGU where convicted offenders were the defenders found that DGUs "are not likely to provide similar social benefits, implying that prevalence estimates may not simultaneously estimate social benefits."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=William|title=The nature and circumstances of defensive gun use: A content analysis of interpersonal conflict situations involving criminal offenders|journal=Justice Quarterly|date=1 March 2002|volume=19|issue=1|pages=127–157|doi=10.1080/07418820200095191}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study published the same year found that DGU is an effective deterrent against injury for some groups of people, but not others; notable groups for whom DGU did not provide benefits in this study included women, people living in rural areas, and those living in low-income homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Schnebly|first1=Stephen M.|title=An examination of the impact of victim, offender, and situational attributes on the deterrent effect of defensive gun use: A research note|journal=Justice Quarterly|date=June 2002|volume=19|issue=2|pages=377–398|doi=10.1080/07418820200095281}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study reported that gun owners were more likely to be shot in an assault than were non-gun owners, and concluded that the chances of DGU being successful for residents of urban areas may be low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Branas|first1=Charles C.|last2=Richmond|first2=Therese S.|last3=Culhane|first3=Dennis P.|last4=Ten Have|first4=Thomas R.|last5=Wiebe|first5=Douglas J.|title=Investigating the Link Between Gun Possession and Gun Assault|journal=American Journal of Public Health|date=November 2009|volume=99|issue=11|pages=2034–2040|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2008.143099|pmid=19762675|pmc=2759797}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another 2009 study of NCVS data found that DGU was "most often effective at helping the victim" in the contexts in which it occurred, with an average of 92% of victims reporting that their DGU had been beneficial for them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hart|first1=T. C.|last2=Miethe|first2=T. D.|title=Self-Defensive Gun Use by Crime Victims: A Conjunctive Analysis of Its Situational Contexts|journal=Journal of Contemporary Criminal Justice|date=1 February 2009|volume=25|issue=1|pages=6–19|doi=10.1177/1043986208328164|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1043986208328164}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 [[National Research Council (United States)|National Research Council]] report found that studies looking at the effectiveness of different self-protective strategies had consistently found that victims who used guns defensively had lower injury rates than did victims who used other strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nap.edu/read/18319/chapter/3 | title=Priorities for Research to Reduce the Threat of Firearm-Related Violence | publisher=National Academy of Sciences | date=2013 | accessdate=6 April 2016 | author=National Research Council | pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2015 study by Solnick and Hemenway which analyzed NCVS data reported "little evidence that [DGU] is uniquely beneficial in reducing the likelihood of injury or property loss."&lt;ref name=pm/&gt;

==Predictors of defensive gun use==
Individuals who use guns defensively tend not to have extremely punitive attitudes toward criminals, but people with punitive attitudes may be somewhat more likely to own guns, and, thus, to use them defensively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kovandzic|first1=Tomislav|last2=Gertz|first2=Gary Kleck Marc|title=Defensive gun use: vengeful vigilante imagery versus reality: results from the national self-defense survey|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|date=May 1998|volume=26|issue=3|pages=251–258|doi=10.1016/S0047-2352(97)00077-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 study found no support for the "[[Culture of honor (Southern United States)|Southern culture of honor]]" hypothesis, in that no significant relationship was seen between living in the [[Southern United States]] and defensive gun use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Copes|first1=H.|last2=Kovandzic|first2=T. V.|last3=Miller|first3=J. M.|last4=Williamson|first4=L.|title=The Lost Cause?

'''Facebook Zero''' is an initiative undertaken by [[social networking service]] company [[Facebook]] in collaboration with mobile phone-based [[Internet provider]]s, whereby the providers waive data (bandwidth) charges (also known as ''[[Zero-rating|zero-rate]]'') for accessing Facebook on phones via a stripped-down [[text-only]] version of its [[mobile website]] (as opposed to the ordinary mobile website m.facebook.com that also loads pictures). The stripped-down version is available online only through providers who have entered the agreement with Facebook.&lt;ref name=facebook-zero-page&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/fast-and-free-facebook-mobile-access-with-0facebookcom/391295167130|title = Fast and Free Facebook Mobile Access with 0.facebook.com|publisher = [[Facebook]]|last = Murlidhar|first = Sid|date = May 18, 2010|accessdate = January 15, 2014|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140116060937/http://www.facebook.com/notes/facebook/fast-and-free-facebook-mobile-access-with-0facebookcom/391295167130|archivedate = January 16, 2014|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mtn&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtn.co.ug/MTN-Services/Communication/Facebook.aspx |title=Facebook |publisher=[[MTN Group|MTN]] |accessdate=January 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116114459/http://www.mtn.co.ug/MTN-Services/Communication/Facebook.aspx |archivedate=January 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="2deg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.2degreesmobile.co.nz/facebookzero |title=Facebook Zero - free on 2degrees! |publisher=[[2degrees]] |accessdate=January 15, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116100528/http://www.2degreesmobile.co.nz/facebookzero |archivedate=January 16, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grameenphone.com/whats-new/facebook-zero|title = Facebook Zero!|publisher = [[GrameenPhone]]|accessdate = January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Photos are not loaded by default.

==History==

Plans for Facebook Zero were first announced at the [[Mobile World Congress]] in February 2010 by [[Chamath Palihapitiya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2010/02/16/facebook-launches-zero-a-text-only-mobile-site-for-carriers/|title = Facebook Launches Zero, A Text-Only Mobile Site For Carriers|last = Wauters|first = Robin|date = February 16, 2010|accessdate = January 15, 2014|publisher = [[TechCrunch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In collaboration with 50 [[mobile operator]]s around the world, it was officially of launched on May 18, 2010.&lt;ref name=facebook-zero-page/&gt;

==Reception and impact==

An article by [[Christopher Mims]] in ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]'' in September 2012 stated that Facebook Zero played a very important role in Facebook's expansion in [[Africa]] over the 18 months following the release of Facebook Zero, noting that data charges could be a significant component of mobile usage cost and the waiving of these charges reduced a significant disincentive for people in Africa to use Facebook.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/5180/facebooks-plan-to-find-its-next-billion-users-convince-them-the-internet-and-facebook-are-the-same/|title = Facebook's plan to find its next billion users: convince them the internet and Facebook are the same|last = Mims|first = Christopher|date = September 24, 2012|accessdate = January 15, 2014|publisher = ''[[Quartz (publication)|Quartz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facebook Zero was also credited as the inspiration for a similar initiative undertaken by [[Wikipedia]] titled [[Wikipedia Zero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://wikimediafoundation.org/wiki/Mobile_partnerships|title = Mobile partnerships|publisher = [[Wikimedia Foundation]]|accessdate = January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/asia/2012/05/27/wikipedia-zero-expands-into-asia-drops-mobile-data-charges-for-10m-subscribers-in-malaysia/|title = Wikipedia Zero expands into Asia, drops mobile data charges for 10m subscribers in Malaysia|last = Brian|first = Matt|date = May 27, 2012|accessdate = January 15, 2014|publisher = ''The Next Web''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dw.de/wikipedia-zero-free-data-if-you-can-afford-it/a-17304321|title = Wikipedia Zero: free data if you can afford it|last = Dillon|first = Conon|date = December 18, 2013|accessdate = January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Google Free Zone]], a similar service launched by [[Google]] in November 2012, was viewed by Internet commentators as both inspired by and a potential challenge to Facebook Zero.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://googlesystem.blogspot.com/2012/10/google-free-zone.html|title = Google Free Zone |date = October 25, 2012|accessdate = January 15, 2014|publisher = Google Operating System blog (not affiliated with Google)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/mobile/2012/11/08/google-and-globe-telecom-launch-freezone-for-mobile-access-to-web-and-select-google-sites/|title = The Philippines gets Facebook Zero-style free mobile access to Google services via Globe Telecom |last = Knowles |first = Jamillah|date = November 8, 2012|accessdate = January 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jana.com/blog/google-free-zone-googles-challenge-to-facebook-zero/|title = Google Free Zone: Google's Challenge to Facebook Zero|date = December 3, 2012|accessdate = January 15, 2014|author = Jana}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innovation-series.com/2013/02/19/google-free-zone-and-facebook-zero-products-targeting-developing-populations/|title = Google ‘Free Zone’ and Facebook ‘Zero’: Products Targeting Developing Populations|date = February 19, 2013|accessdate = January 15, 2014|publisher = Innovation Series|last = Deibert|first = April}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Subsecretaría de Telecomunicaciones'' of [[Chile]] ruled that ''[[zero-rating]]'' services like Wikipedia Zero, Facebook Zero, and Google Free Zone, that subsidize mobile data usage, violate [[net neutrality]] laws and had to end the practise by June 1, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/215064/when-net-neutrality-backfires-chile-just-killed-free-access-to-wikipedia-and-facebook/|title = Less than zero – When net neutrality backfires: Chile just killed free access to Wikipedia and Facebook|last = Mirani|first = Leo |publisher= Quartz |date = May 30, 2014|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techpresident.com/news/wegov/25090/face-chile-net-neutrality-v-human-right-facebook-wikipedia|title = Face Off in Chile: Net Neutrality v. Human Right to Facebook &amp; Wikipedia|last = McKenzie|first = Jessica|date = June 2, 2014|accessdate = July 2, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, researchers evaluating how Facebook Zero shapes [[information and communication technology]] use in the developing world found that 11% of Indonesians who said they used Facebook also said they did not use the Internet. 65% of Nigerians, 61% of Indonesians, and 58% of Indians agree with the statement that "Facebook is the Internet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qz.com/333313/milliions-of-facebook-users-have-no-idea-theyre-using-the-internet/|title=Millions of Facebook users have no idea they’re using the internet|author=Leo Mirani|date=9 Feb 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3869">'''Golus nationalism''' (Yiddish: גלות נאַציאָנאַליזם ''Golus natsionalizm'' after [[Jewish diaspora|golus]]), or Diaspora Nationalism, is a [[Nationalism|national]] movement of the [[Jews|Jewish people]] that argued for furthering Jewish national and cultural life in the large Jewish centers throughout the world, while at the same time seeking recognition for a Jewish national identity from world powers.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Yiddish Culture: The Story of the Yiddish Language Movement|last=Goldsmith|first=Emanuel S.|publisher=Fordham Univ Press|year=1997|isbn=0823216950|location=|pages=107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
Golus Nationalism was conceived by [[Nathan Birnbaum]], the Austrian philosopher who had given [[Zionism]] its name. Although Birnbaum was an early theorist of Zionism and participated in the [[First Zionist Congress]] (1897), he broke with the movement shortly after. Birnbaum began to develop a theory of pan-Judaism (''Alljudentum''), which embraced Jewish life in the [[Jewish diaspora|Diaspora]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laboratory for World Destruction: Germans and Jews in Central Europe|last=Wistrich|first=Robert S.|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|year=2007|isbn=0803211341|location=|pages=139}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum was opposed to the idea that [[Jewish assimilation]] was inevitable, inspired by the Jews of Eastern Europe, who had retained Yiddish as a language, had a robust folk culture, and banded together in recognizably distinct communities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Seeking recognition for Jewish nationality ==
Birnbaum made several attempts to have a Jewish national identity recognized by state powers. In 1907, he unsuccessfully advocated for [[Yiddish]] to be included as a Jewish national language in the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian]] census. The following year, he ran a popular but fruitless campaign for a seat in Parliament. In 1910, he again attempted to have Yiddish recognized. Birnbaum felt that if he could get state recognition for elements of Jewish nationhood, he could petition for Jews to have shared control of a province in [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]]. He was encouraged by the fact that the Austro-Hungarian Empire was offering the possibility of autonomous regions to ethnic groups and nationalities.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Yiddish: A Nation of Words|last=Weinstein|first=Miriam|publisher=Ballantine Books|year=2002|isbn=0345447301|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Birnbaum also propagandized on behalf of Yiddish as a language, coining the words "Yiddishism" and "Yiddishist." He organized Yiddish events in [[Vienna]], translate Yiddish authors into German, and in 1905 established a student organization for the furtherance of the language called ''Yidishe Kultur''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 1908, he organized an international conference on the Yiddish language in [[Chernivtsi|Czernowitz]], in which different Jewish factions squared off as to whether Yiddish should be declared the official language of Jewish nationalism or instead one of several Jewish languages.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Influence ==
Golus nationalism prefigured a variety of attempts to reconcile Jewish identity with the experience of diaspora. Rabbi [[Mordecai Kaplan|Mordecai M. Kaplan]] would wrestle with similar themes, developing a theory that Judaism should be seen as a civilization, rather than a religion, and founding [[Reconstructionist Judaism]] on this theory. Yiddishist [[Abraham Golomb]] wrote frequently about maintaining a Jewish identity in the Diaspora, and the centrality of Yiddish and Hebrew in this pursuit.

The '''history of United States patent law''' started even before the U.S. Constitution was adopted, with some state-specific patent laws. The history spans over more than three centuries.

==Background==
{{Main|History of patent law}}

The oldest{{Dubious|date=September 2009}} form of a [[patent]] was seen in [[Medieval]] times.  Medieval rulers would grant an exclusive right to a "[[monopoly]]." This was sometimes an attempt to raise funds without [[tax]]ing, although taxes were still imposed.&lt;ref name="ladas"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ladas.com/a-brief-history-of-the-patent-law-of-the-united-states-2/ |title=A Brief History of the Patent Law of the United States |accessdate=29 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In [[Kingdom of England|England]] such grants took the form of  '''"[[letters patent]]"''', issued by the sovereign to inventors who petitioned and were approved: a grant of 1331 to John Kempe and his Company is the earliest authenticated instance of a royal grant made with the avowed purpose of instructing the English in a new industry.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Terrell on Patents]]'', 8th edition edited by J R Jones, London (Sweet &amp; Maxwell) 1934.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E Wyndham Hulme, ''The History of the Patent System under the Prerogative and at Common Law'', Law Quarterly Review, vol.46 (1896), pp.141-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1474, in [[Republic of Venice|Venice]], the first known patent law that granted inventors exclusive rights to their inventions was passed as a result of an economic policy. Thereafter, patents were a formal means of granting and restricting monopolies in Europe. The Venice statute had all the basic elements of a modern patent system—a requirement of novelty, proof of usefulness, and a requirement that the patentee describe and explain the invention.&lt;ref&gt;"Robert P. Merges et al., Intellectual Property in the New Technological Age (5th ed. 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1624, in England, the [[Statute of Monopolies]] was passed primarily to restrict the power of the sovereign in granting monopolies. The Statute of Monopolies, for the first time in history, defined the following: that inventions had to be "new" to attain a monopoly, and that a monopoly would be granted only for a limited period of time (in this case 14 years.) These aspects have carried forward and helped shape the [[United States Patent Law]]. The Statute of Monopolies attempted to reinforce the advantages to society of new inventions; however, a [[Early Modern France|French]] Patent Law, established in 1791, focused on the inventor and emphasized the invention as the inventor's property. The US Patent Law today adopts both streams of thought; however, the concept of monopolies and patents, in the US, initiated with the British thought of advantages to society.&lt;ref name="ladas"/&gt;

==United States patent law==

===Patent practice before federal patent laws===

====Case-specific acts====
In America in the early colonial period, there were no general laws providing for the issuing of patents. However, people who invented new products could appeal to the colonial governments, which could grant them the exclusive commercial right to the products. The earliest of such rights granted in the colonies was in the state of Massachusetts in 1641. The Massachusetts General Court gave [[Samuel Winslow (patentee)|Samuel Winslow]] an exclusive right to utilize a new process of making salt for 10 years. The case is unofficially known of as the first "patent" in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Manufactures of the United States in 1860; compiled from the original returns of the eighth census, under the direction of the Secretary of the interior|year=1865|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=cxcix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other similar exclusive commercial rights were granted in other colonies and later states of the United States of America. These acts were all private acts of the colony or state governments to grant commercial privileges to specific people, before general laws regarding the issuing of patents were passed in each state. This custom of using private acts to grant patents is often said to have come from the early in England, particularly the [[Statute of Monopolies|English Statute of Monopolies of 1624]].

====State-level general patent laws====
Near the end of the 18th century, states started to pass general patent laws replacing the case-specific acts. These state-level general acts set up standardized procedures for patent applications, an examination process, and general terms for patent holdings. The first state to pass a general patent law was South Carolina, in 1784.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The South Carolina Historical and Genealogical Magazine , Volumes 8-9|year=1907|publisher=South Carolina Historical Society|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This first general patent act of the state of South Carolina is titled "An Act for the Encouragement of Arts and Sciences." Although most of its terms concerned the protection of copyrights, it also included the following provision: "The Inventors of useful machines shall have a like exclusive privilege of making or vending their machines for the like term of 14 years, under the same privileges and restrictions hereby granted to, and imposed on, the authors of books."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Thomas|title=The Statutes at Large of South Carolina: Acts from 1716 to 1752|year=1838|publisher=A.S. Johnston|page=805}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Research Council|title=Global Dimensions of Intellectual Property Rights in Science and Technology|year=1993|publisher=National Academies Press|page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many other states followed suit in passing general patent acts, most using a 14-year term, resembling English practices. However, without a federal system, patentees who wanted to use their invention in more than one state had to apply separately for patents in each state, which was expensive and time-consuming. A standardized national patent law was needed for more efficient patent grating process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Constitutional Rights Foundation|first=Bill of Rights in Action WINTER 2008 (Volume 23, No. 4)|title=The Origins of Patent and Copyright Law|url=http://www.crf-usa.org/bill-of-rights-in-action/bria-23-4-a-the-origins-of-patent-and-copyright-law#.UU-OeVdMy3M|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States federal patent laws===

====Constitution====
[[United States Constitution|The Constitution of the United States]], first adopted on September 17, 1787, had a provision for protecting intellectual properties. The provision is found in Article I, Section 8:

"The Congress shall have Power ... To promote the Progress of Science and useful Arts, by securing for limited Times to Authors and Inventors the exclusive Right to their respective Writings and Discoveries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=copyright.gov|title=Copyright Law of the United States of America and Related Laws Contained in Title 17 of the United States Code|url=http://www.copyright.gov/title17/92preface.html|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Patent Act of 1790====
{{main|Patent Act of 1790}}
The Patent Act of 1790 was the first federal patent statute of the United States. It was titled "An Act to promote the Progress of Useful Arts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=docs.law.gwu.edu|title=The First United States Patent Statute|url=http://docs.law.gwu.edu/facweb/claw/patact1790.htm|work=Patent Act of 1790, Ch. 7, 1 Stat. 109 (April 10, 1790) CHAP. VII. – An ACT to promote the Progress of uſeful Arts.|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The statute was concise, including only seven sections. Similar to the state statutes, the federal statute allowed the patentees a 14-year term of exclusive right to use their inventions, without the possibility of an extension. This was unsatisfactory to many inventors who wanted extended protection time for their inventions. They argued that 14 years were not enough, given that it often took several years already for their inventions to be commercialized.&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite web|last=Watson|first=Jason|title=A History of the United States Patent Office|url=http://www.historical-markers.org/usptohistory2.cgi|publisher=historical-markers.org|accessdate=26 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another important point of the Patent Act of 1790 was that it did not allow foreigners to obtain patents in the United States.

In the Patent Act of 1790, the power to grant or refuse patents was given exclusively to three people: the Secretary of State, the Secretary of War, and the Attorney General. Patent applicants needed the consent of at least two of the three officials to obtain a patent. The act provided that an examination process be carried out by the same three officials to decide whether the inventions were "not before known or used" and "sufficiently useful and important". This examination process was soon criticized as taking unreasonably too much time. At the same time, the people responsible for examining and granting patents had other important duties to attend to and could not carry out the process quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=P.J|first=Federico|title=Operation of the Patent Act of 1790|year=1990|publisher=Pat. &amp; Trademark Off. Soc'y}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took several months for a patent to be examined.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt;

====Patent Act of 1793====

In 1793, the 1790 act was repealed and replaced by the Patent Act of 1793. The act was notable for its definition of the subjects of patents which remains unchanged until now: "any new and useful art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter and any new and useful improvement on any art, machine, manufacture or composition of matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patent Act of 1793, Ch. 11, 1 Stat. 318-323 (February 21, 1793)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this later act, the patent application process was much simpler than in the Patent Act of 1790. People who sought patents only needed to petition the Secretary of State and then it was the duty of the Secretary of State to acquire examination from the Attorney General. The examination process was simplified by dropping the clause that patented inventions needed to be "sufficiently useful and important". It was enough that inventions were somehow useful, even if the usefulness was insignificant, and "not before known or used" to be granted patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[s:United States Statutes at Large/Volume 1/2nd Congress/2nd Session/Chapter 11|Patent Act of 1793]], Ch. 11, 1 Stat. 318-323 (February 21, 1793)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obtaining patents became much easier during the period after the Patent Act of 1793 and the next federal Patent Act passed in 1836. Between the Patent Act of 1790 and that of 1793, only 57 patents were granted, but by July 2, 1836, a total of 10,000 patents had been granted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=P.J|first=Federico|title=Operation of the Patent Act of 1790|year=1990|publisher=Pat. &amp; Trademark Off. Soc'y}}&lt;/ref&gt; This however, came at an expense of the quality of patents granted. Thomas Jefferson, who was Secretary of State at the time, realized the need to employ experts into the patent examination process. He hired personnel from the University of Pennsylvania to help with determining the novelty and usefulness of the inventions. When more and more patent applications came in, the patent office, which was still loosely organized, was unable to adequately examine every application. In his book "Science in the Federal Government: A History of Policies and Activities" Dupree commented: "The patent office languished, but inventors were ever more active."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dupree|first=Hunter|title=Science in the Federal Government: A History of Policies and Activities|year=1986|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Patents were granted to objects and procedures which were not original inventions or not useful. As this ineffective situation went on, more lawsuits were filed over patent validity and infringement. Patentees were dissatisfied, and courts were overwhelmed with patent lawsuits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Gustavus|title=The Patent Office: Its History, Activities and Organization|year=1924|publisher=The Johns Hopkins University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Patent Act of 1836====
{{main|Patent Act of 1836}}
In 1836, another federal Patent Act was passed to reform problems in the previous acts. The Patent Act of 1836 was significant in a number of ways. Firstly, the act created an official [[United States Patent and Trademark Office|Patent Office]], which was still a part of the [[United States Department of State|Department of State]], but no longer under the duties of the [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]]. It freed the Secretary of State from the enormous duty of granting patents, when he had many other significant tasks to tend to. Instead of the Secretary of State, the Commissioner of Patents chaired the Patent Office. This restructuring of the patent office allowed for more efficient process of patent applications. Secondly, the act prevented the applications of already patented inventions by requiring information on newly granted patents to be made publicly accessible at libraries throughout the country. Anyone could consult this information to check whether his or her invention was truly original before filing for a patent. This greatly improved the quality of patents granted.&lt;ref name="Watson"/&gt; Thirdly, the act resolved a long-standing dissatisfaction on patent terms by allowing, for the first time, a possible extension of 7 years of protection in addition to the original 14-year term. With the permission of the Commissioner of Patent, upon appropriate reasons, patentees could appeal to have their protection extended.  And lastly, it finally removed the US nationality and residency requirements, making it possible for foreigners to file for US patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Patent Act of 1836, Ch. 357, 5 Stat. 117 (July 4, 1836)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 13, 1836, Patent Number 1 was granted. In 1836, The Patent Office also went back and renumbered all previous patents with a suffix '''"[[X-patent|X]]"'''. Prior to this, patents were listed by names and dates and not numbers. After the renumbering, the very first US Patent became ''Patent 1X''. On December 15 of the same year, a [[1836 U.S. Patent Office fire|fire]] demolished the Patent Office, and only 2,845 patents were recovered. This resulted in a law that required all patent applications to be submitted in doubles. This law for double copies of patent applications was dropped in 1870 when the Patent Office started printing.&lt;ref name=archives&gt;Robert B. Matchette et al.

US National Archives and Records Administration. website. National Archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Subsequent changes====
In 1849, the Patent Office was transferred from the State Department to the [[United States Department of the Interior|Department of the Interior]].

====The Sherman Antitrust Act====
{{main|Sherman Antitrust Act}}
{{refimprove section|date=November 2017}}

&lt;!-- ***************************************************************
The main article, Sherman Antitrust Act, has no text re "negative attitude" or "opposing" , etc., patents.  Sources are needed here!!

Please do not "fix by deleting". This text explains some of the problems [[Herman Hollerith]] had at that time and will be referenced in a (slowly) coming revision of the Hollerith article. Thanks 
****************************************************************** --&gt;

The [[Panic of 1890|1890 depression]] resulted in an unfavorable view of patents. The depression was marked by a strained economy in which patents were perceived as a method of promoting monopolies. This negative attitude towards patents led to the inception of the Sherman Antitrust Act. During the depression, many opposed patents, and this is depicted in the tendency of courts to invalidate patents. The conclusion of the depression also ended the negative attitudes towards patents; however, the Patent Law underwent opposition again in the [[Great Depression]]. This skepticism towards patents again returned after [[World War II]] in another period of economic depression.

In 1925, the Patent Office was transferred again from the Department of the Interior to the [[United States Department of Commerce|Department of Commerce]], where it is today.

====Modern patent laws====
In 1952, the basic structure of the modern Patent Law was laid out with the [[Patent Act of 1952]]. In this amendment, an inventor had to describe not only his invention but also the basis for its infringement. Furthermore, an invention needed to be new and useful, as well as "non- obvious"&lt;ref&gt;Jethro K. Lieberman, 1992, The Evolving Constitution, pp. 371-2&lt;/ref&gt; to be granted a patent. This amendment, which required patents to be non-obvious, was implemented to keep individuals from taking ownership or taking away from the base pool of knowledge in a particular field.

In the 1980 and '90s the atmosphere once again became pro-patent. The patent was seen as not only a business need but also a means to protect inventors. Patents became important, and they began to signify the importance of technology, invention, and discovery to the US.

In 1982, the Court of Customs and Patent Appeals was abolished, and patent cases were heard in the newly established [[United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit|Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit]]. The Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit observed patents favorably and also started to provide more protection to their owners.&lt;ref name="Lawrence M. Friedman 2002, p. 427"&gt;Lawrence M.

In 2011, the [[Leahy-Smith America Invents Act]] (AIA) enacted the most significant change to the U.S. patent system since 1952. After decades of debate in the U.S. comparing and contrasting the pros and cons of [[First to file and first to invent|"first-to-invent" versus "first-to-file" systems]], the AIA switched the U.S. patent system from "first to invent" to "first inventor to file". The U.S. had been the last remaining country still using a first-to-invent system. The AIA reforms eliminate [[interference proceedings]] and develop post-grant opposition. Its central provisions went into effect March 16, 2013 for patent applications filed that day or afterwards.

==Terms of patents==
{{main|Term of patent in the United States}}

The original patent term under the [[1790 Patent Act]] was decided individually for each patent, but "not exceeding fourteen years".&lt;ref&gt;See [[1790 Patent Act]].&lt;/ref&gt; The [[1836 Patent Act]] (5 Stat. 117, 119, 5) provided (in addition to the fourteen-year term) an extension "for the term of seven years from and after the expiration of the first term" in certain circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/patents/Patent_Act_of_1836.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130319075734/http://ipmall.info/hosted_resources/lipa/patents/Patent_Act_of_1836.pdf |archivedate=2013-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1861 the seven-year extension was eliminated and the term changed to seventeen years (12 Stat. 246, 249, 16) (from grant date).  The signing of the 1994 Uruguay Round Agreements Act&lt;ref&gt;uspto.gov, [http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/doc/uruguay/uraaact.html Title V - Intellectual Property] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130121173709/http://www.uspto.gov/web/offices/com/doc/uruguay/uraaact.html |date=2013-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; then changed the patent term from seventeen years from the date of issue to the current twenty years from the earliest filing date.

An '''inholding''' is [[private property|privately owned]] land inside the boundary of a [[national park]], [[United States National Forest|national forest]], [[state park]], or similar publicly owned, [[protected area]]. In-holdings result from private ownership of lands predating the designation of the park or forest area, or the expansion of the park area to encompass the privately owned property.  
In the [[United States]], the main causes of inholdings is that all of the Federal land-management agencies were formed over a century after the government sold and issued land grants to private citizens to fund the administration of the United States.  When the park system was formed, many of these now-called "inholdings" had been in private ownership for generations and not available for sale when the park was formed.      
Over the last several decades, [[Conservation movement|conservation groups]] have lobbied the [[United States Congress]] to acquire private residences especially within [[Wilderness Act|designated wilderness areas]], either by direct purchase or via land exchange which trades the inholding for other [[federal lands]] located outside of national parks or wilderness areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wildernesslandtrust.org/about-wilderness.html ''What are the adverse impacts caused by the development of wilderness inholdings?'']  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100628052429/http://www.wildernesslandtrust.org/about-wilderness.html |date=June 28, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rights and regulations==
Generally, owners of inholdings are allowed to use their properties in a manner similar to other private property owners in their state. However, they may be subject to additional federal and agency-specific regulations regarding access to their homes and use of their lands by their Federal agency neighbors.

Under the [[Wilderness Act]] (1964), the designated area cannot include the privately owned property within the border.  Under the Act, federal agencies have an obligation to provide property owners "adequate access" across public lands should their property lie within the designated wilderness boundary. As such, many public agencies have allowed limited use roads to be built in wilderness areas. Under the [[Eastern Wilderness Act]], public agencies are allowed to seize wilderness inholdings if the owner of the inholding manages his land in a manner "incompatible with management of such area as wilderness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wilderness.net/library/documents/Tanner1.pdf Tanner]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Contract law}}
An '''invitation to treat''' (or '''invitation to bargain''' in the United States) is a concept within [[contract law]].&lt;ref&gt;It comes from the Latin phrase ''invitatio ad offerendum'' and means "inviting an offer".&lt;/ref&gt; In Andrew Burrows' words, an invitation to treat is

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"...an expression of willingness to negotiate. A person making an invitation to treat does not intend to be bound as soon as it is accepted by the person to whom the statement is addressed."&lt;ref&gt;Burrows, A. (2009). Offer and Acceptance. A Casebook on Contract (2nd ed., pp. 5). Portland, OR, North America: Hart Publishing. (Original work published 2007).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A contract is a legally binding voluntary agreement that is formed when one person makes an offer, and the other accepts it. There may be some preliminary discussion before an offer is formally made. Such pre-contractual '''representations''' are known variously as “invitations to treat”, “requests for information” or “statements of intention”.

True offers may be accepted to form a contract, whereas representations such as invitations to treat may not. However, although an invitation to treat cannot be accepted it should not be ignored, for it may nevertheless affect the offer. For example, where an offer is made in response to an invitation to treat, the offer may incorporate the terms of the invitation to treat (unless the offer expressly incorporates different terms). If, as in the ''Boots'' case (described below) the offer is made by an action without any negotiations—such as presenting goods to a cashier—the offer will be presumed to be on the terms of the invitation to treat.

==Case law==
Generally, [[advertisements]] are not offers but invitations to treat, so the person advertising is not compelled to sell. In ''[[Partridge v Crittenden]]'' [1968] 1 WLR 1204, a defendant who was charged with "offering for sale protected birds"—bramblefinch cocks and hens that he had advertised for sale in a newspaper—was ''not'' offering to sell them. Lord Parker CJ said it did not make business sense for advertisements to be offers, as the person making the advertisement may find himself in a situation where he would be contractually obliged to sell more goods than he actually owned.

In certain circumstances called [[unilateral contract]]s, an advertisement can be an offer; as in ''[[Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company]]'' [1893] 1 QB 256, where it was held that the defendants, who advertised that they would pay £100 to anyone who sniffed a smoke ball in the prescribed manner and yet caught influenza, were contractually obliged to pay £100 to whomever accepted it by performing the required acts.

A display of goods for [[contract of sale|sale]] in a shop window or within a shop is an invitation to treat, as in the ''Boots'' case,&lt;ref&gt;''[[Pharmaceutical Society of Great Britain v Boots Cash Chemists (Southern) Ltd]]'' [1953] 1 QB 401 [http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Civ/1953/6.html Bailii]&lt;/ref&gt; a leading case concerning supermarkets. The shop owner is thus not obliged to sell the goods, even if signage such as "special offer" accompanies the display. Also, in ''[[Fisher v Bell]]'' [1961] 1 QB 394, the display of a [[flick knife]] for sale in a shop did not contravene legislation which prohibited "offering for sale an offensive weapon". If a shop mistakenly displays an item for sale at a very low price it is not obliged to sell it for that amount.&lt;ref name="BBC News - 08Sep1999 - The Economy  Argos "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/441740.stm|title=Business: The Economy  Argos - an invitation to 'treat' |date=September 8, 1999 |publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=8 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
For an offer to be capable of becoming binding on acceptance, the offer must be definite, clear, and objectively intended to be capable of acceptance.

In England, auctions are governed by the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]] (as amended). Section 57(2) provides: “A sale by auction is complete when the auctioneer announces its completion by the fall of the hammer, or in other customary manner. Until the announcement is made any bidder may retract his bid”. S. 57(3) provides further: “An auction sale may be subject to a reserve price”. However, if the auction is held ''"without reserve"'' then the auctioneer is obliged to sell to the highest bidder.&lt;ref&gt;Warlow v Harrison (1859) 1 E &amp; E 309&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barry v Davies (Heathcote Ball &amp; Co.) [2000] 1 WLR 1962&lt;/ref&gt; It is implicit from ''[[Payne v Cave]]'' (1789),&lt;ref&gt;''[[Payne v Cave]]'' (1789) 3 TR 148&lt;/ref&gt; an early case concerning auctions, that each bid is deemed to expire when others make higher bids; but some auctioneers (such as [[eBay]]) have lawfully amended this presumption so that, should a higher bidder withdraw his bid, they may accept a lower one.

The [[Call for bids|tender]] process is a debated issue. In the case of ''[[Spencer v Harding]]''&lt;ref&gt;''[[Spencer v Harding]]'' (1870) LR 5 CP 561&lt;/ref&gt; the defendants offered to sell stock by tender, but the court held that there was no promise to sell to the highest bidder, merely an invitation for offers which they could then accept or reject at will. In ''exceptional'' circumstances an invitation for tenders may be an offer, as in ''[[Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada (CI) Ltd|Harvela Investments v Royal Trust of Canada]]'' [1986]&lt;ref&gt;''[[Harvela Investments Ltd v Royal Trust of Canada (CI) Ltd]]'' [1986] AC 207&lt;/ref&gt; where the court held that because defendants had made clear an intention to accept the highest tender, then the invitation to tender was an offer accepted by the person making the highest tender. The ''Harvela'' case also made it clear that "referential bids"&lt;ref&gt;(eg: “$2,100,000 or $101,000 in excess of any other offer which you may receive, whichever is the higher”, as in the Harvela case)&lt;/ref&gt; are void as being "[[public policy|contrary to public policy]] and [[Unsportsmanlike conduct#Examples|not cricket]]".

In countries where this agency is called a department (usually '''department of justice''', sometimes '''attorney general's department''') the head of the department is entitled ''[[attorney general]]'', for example in the [[United States Department of Justice|United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.justice.gov/about/history|title=History &amp; Art of the Department of Justice {{!}} DOJ {{!}} Department of Justice|website=www.justice.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monaco]] is an example of a country that does not have a ministry of justice, but rather a Directorate of Judicial Services (Secretary of Justice) that oversees the administration of justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.gouv.mc/Gouvernement-et-Institutions/Les-Institutions/La-Justice|title=La Justice / Les Institutions / Gouvernement et Institutions / Portail du Gouvernement -  Monaco|last=Monaco|first=Gouvernement Princier de|website=www.gouv.mc|language=fr-FR|access-date=2018-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vatican City]], a country under the sovereignty of the [[Holy See]], also does not possess a ministry of justice. The legislative body (which includes a legal office) is overseen by the [[President of the Pontifical Commission for Vatican City State]]. 

Specific duties may relate to organizing the [[Criminal justice|justice system]], overseeing the [[public prosecutor]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/public-prosecutor|title=Public Prosecutor (Meaning)|last=|first=|date=|website=Cambridge English Dictionary|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and maintaining the [[justice system|legal system]] and [[public order]]. Some ministries have additional responsibilities in related policy areas overseeing [[elections]], directing the [[police]], law reform. The duties of the ministry of justice may in some countries be split from separate responsibilities of an [[attorney general]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://thelawdictionary.org/attorney-general/|title=What is ATTORNEY GENERAL?

Sometimes the prison system is separated into another government department called Corrective Services.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8679">'''LPD433''' (low power device 433&amp;nbsp;MHz) is a [[ultra high frequency|UHF]] band in which licence free communication devices are allowed to operate in some regions. The frequencies correspond with the [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU region 1]] [[ISM band]] of 433.050&amp;nbsp;[[megahertz|MHz]] to 434.790&amp;nbsp;MHz, and operation is limited to [[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT]] countries. The frequencies used are within the [[70-centimeter band]], which is currently reserved for government and [[amateur radio]] operations in the United States and most nations worldwide.

LPD hand-held radios are authorized for licence-free voice communications use in most of Europe using analog [[frequency modulation]] (FM) as part of [[short range device]] regulations,&lt;ref name=rec_70-03&gt;[[European Conference of Postal and Telecommunications Administrations|CEPT/ERC]] [http://www.erodocdb.dk/docs/doc98/official/pdf/rec7003e.pdf  REC 70-03] (22 August 2011)&lt;/ref&gt; with 25 [[kilohertz|kHz]] channel spacing, for a total of 69 channels. In some countries, LPD devices may only be used with an integral and non-removable [[antenna (radio)|antenna]] with a maximum legal power output of 10 [[milliwatt|mW]].

Voice communication in the LPD band was introduced to reduce the burden on the eight (now sixteen)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.erodocdb.dk/Docs/doc98/official/pdf/ECCDEC1505.PDF|title=ECC Decision (15) 05|publisher=CEPT Electronic Communications Committee |accessdate=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[PMR446]] channels over shorter ranges (less than 1&amp;nbsp;km) .{{citation needed|date=October 2011}} In some EU countries voice is not allowed over LPD.

LPD is also used by wireless instruments and digital devices such as car keylocks.

==Usage by country==

'''ITU Region 1 (Europe)'''

'''United Kingdom'''

In the UK, LPD433 equipment that meets the respective [[Ofcom]] Interface Requirement can be used for model control, analogue/digitised voice and [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry systems]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0028/84970/ir-2030-july-2017.pdf
|title=IR 2030 - UK Interface Requirements 2030 - Licence Exempt Short Range Devices |publisher=Ofcom |date=July 2017 |accessdate=2017-12-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is significant scope for interference however, both on frequency and on adjacent frequencies, as the band is far from free. The frequencies from 430 to 440&amp;nbsp;MHz are allocated on a secondary basis to licensed radio amateurs who are allowed to use up to 40&amp;nbsp;W (16&amp;nbsp;dBW) between 430 and 432&amp;nbsp;MHz and 400&amp;nbsp;W (26&amp;nbsp;dBW) between 432 and 440&amp;nbsp;MHz. Channels 1 to 14 are UK amateur repeater outputs and channels 62 to 69 are UK amateur repeater inputs. This band is shared on a secondary basis for both licensed and licence exempt users, with the primary user being the [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Ministry of Defence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/spectrum/spectrum-information/UKFAT_2013.pdf|title=United Kingdom Frequency Allocation Table 2013 |publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ofcom, together with the  R.S.G.B. Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee have produced guidelines to help mitigate the side effects of interference to an extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ofcom.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0024/86172/Interference-between-Short-Range-Devices-and-Amateur-Repeaters.pdf|title=Interference between Short Range Devices and Amateur Repeaters|publisher=Ofcom |accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ukrepeater.net/documents/srd.pdf|title=Paper on SRD Mitigation Techniques |publisher=R.S.G.B. Emerging Technology Co-ordination Committee|accessdate=2014-01-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Other European countries'''

European [[Remote keyless system|remote keyless entry systems]] often use the 433&amp;nbsp;MHz band, although, as in all of Europe, these frequencies are within the [[70-centimeter band]] allocated to [[amateur radio]], and interference results. In Germany, before the end of 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rc-network.de/magazin/artikel_05/art_05-027/laender/GER.pdf RC-Network.de Fernsteuerfrequenzen für den Modellbau - Deutschland  (Frequency bands for RC modeling - Germany) - "Am 31.12.2008 endet die Betriebserlaubnis für Fernsteuerungen im Frequenzbereich 433 MHz!"] (As of 12/31/2008, RC use of the 433 MHz bands ends in Germany!)&lt;/ref&gt; radio control enthusiasts were able to use frequencies from channel 03 through 67 on the above chart for radio control of any form of model (air or ground-based), all with odd channel numbers (03, 05, etc. up to ch. 67) as read on the chart,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukrcc.org/germany.html |title=United Kingdom Radio Control Council: International Frequencies - Germany |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=UKRCC |publisher=UKRCC |accessdate=July 13, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with each sanctioned frequency having 50&amp;nbsp;kHz of bandwidth separation between each adjacent channel.

'''ITU Region 2 (America)'''

In [[International Telecommunication Union region|ITU region 2]] (the Americas), the frequencies that LPD433 uses are also within the [[70-centimeter band]] allocated to [[amateur radio]]. In the United States LPD433 radios can only be used under [[Title 47 CFR Part 97|FCC amateur regulations]] by [[Amateur radio licensing in the United States|properly licensed amateur radio operators]].

'''ITU Region 3'''

'''Malaysia'''

In Malaysia, this band are also within the 70-centimeter band (430.000 – 440.000 MHz) allocated to amateur radio. Class B amateur radio holder are permitted to transmit up to 50 Watts [[Peak envelope power|PEP]] power level&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.skmm.gov.my/skmmgovmy/media/General/pdf/Guideline-for-Amateur-Radio-Service-in-Malaysia-2nd-Edition_1.pdf|title=Guidelines for Amateur Radio Services in Malaysia 2nd Edition|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. There is no licence requirement for LPD as long as it complies with requirement regulated by [https://www.skmm.gov.my/ Malaysian Communications And Multimedia Commission] (MCMC). As regulated by MCMC in Technical Code for Short Range Devices&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.mcmc.gov.my/skmmgovmy/media/General/pdf/MCMC-MTSFB-TC-T007_2014.pdf|title=MCMC MTSFB TC T007:2014 - Specification for Short Range Devices|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=11 Feb 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, remote control and security device are allowed up to 50 mW [[Effective radiated power|ERP]] and up to 100 mW ERP for Short Range Communication (SRC) devices.

{{Law enforcement in the United Kingdom}}
[[File:MPS officers supervising World Cup, 2006.jpg|250px|thumb|right| [[Metropolitan Police]] officers on crowd control after England loses to Portugal, 1 July 2006]]
There are a number of agencies that participate in [[law enforcement in the United Kingdom]] which can be grouped into three general types:

* '''Territorial police forces''', who carry out the majority of policing. These are police forces that cover a [[police area]] (a particular region) and have an independent [[police authority]]. Current police forces have their grounding in the [[Police Act 1996]] (in [[England and Wales]]), a combination of [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]] and [[Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012]] (in [[Scotland]]) and the [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]] (in [[Northern Ireland]]), which prescribe a number of issues such as appointment of a [[chief constable]], jurisdiction and responsibilities.
* '''National law enforcement bodies''', including the [[National Crime Agency]] and national police forces that have a specific, non-regional jurisdiction, such as the [[British Transport Police]]. The [[Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005]] refers to these as '[[special police force]]s', not including the NCA which is not a police force.  In addition, there are non-police law enforcement agencies, whose officers are not police officers, but still enforce laws, and other bodies with solely investigatory powers.
* '''Miscellaneous police forces''', mostly having their foundations in older legislation or [[common law]]. These are responsible for policing specific local areas or activities, such as ports and parks. Before the passing of recent legislation such as the Serious Organised Crime and Police Act 2005, they were often referred to as 'special police forces'; care must therefore be taken in interpreting historical use of that phrase. These constabularies are not within the scope of the legislation applicable to the previously-mentioned organisations but can still be the subject of statutes applicable to, for example, docks, harbours or railways. Until the passing of [[Railways and Transport Safety Act 2003]], the British Transport Police was such a force.

The majority of law enforcement in the United Kingdom is carried out by territorial police forces that police the general public and their activities. The other types of agencies are concerned with policing of more specific matters.

Over the centuries there has been a wide variation in the number of police forces in the United Kingdom, with a [[List of defunct law enforcement agencies in the United Kingdom|large number now no longer in existence]].

===England and Wales===
[[File:Map of English and Welsh Police areas in the United Kingdom.svg|right|225px]]
Except in Greater London, each [[territorial police force]] covers one or more of the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government areas]] (counties) established in the 1974 local government reorganisations (although with subsequent modifications), in an area known in statute as a [[police area]]. These forces provide the majority of policing services to the public of England and Wales. These forces have been known historically as "[[Home Office]] police forces" due to the [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] {{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} that established them although use of that description was only correct for the Metropolitan Police and in that case ceased to be so when local control was transferred from the Home Office to the [[Metropolitan Police Authority]]. Despite the implication of the term, all police forces are independent, with operational control resting solely with the chief officer of each force (the [[Chief Constable]] or with regard to the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] and [[City of London Police]] forces, their respective Commissioners); each force was overseen by a [[Police authority]] until these were replaced by [[Police and Crime Commissioners]] in 2012.

The Police Act 1996 is the most recent piece of legislation, which outlines the areas of responsibility for the 43 territorial forces of [[England and Wales]] (found in Schedule 1 of the Act).

''Constable'' is the lowest rank in the police service, but all officers, whatever their rank are "constables" in terms of legal powers and jurisdiction. Police officers in territorial police forces in England and Wales derive their jurisdiction from Section 30 of the Police Act 1996. This section outlines that such officers have jurisdiction throughout England and Wales and also the adjacent United Kingdom waters. [[Special Constable]]s, who are part-time, volunteer officers of these forces, used to have a more limited jurisdiction – limited solely to their own force areas and adjacent forces (collectively, their "constablewick"). Since 1 April 2007, however Special Constables of England &amp; Wales have full police powers throughout those two countries. This means that, in contrast to the majority of countries, all UK volunteer police officers now have exactly the same powers as their full-time colleagues. There are a number of situations in which the jurisdiction of a constable extends to one of the other countries – see [[Law enforcement in the United Kingdom#Cross-border powers|the main article]] for details.

===Scotland===
[[File:Map of Scotland Police area in the United Kingdom.svg|right|225px]]
Most police powers and functions have been inherited by the [[Scottish Government]] and [[Scottish Parliament]] from the [[Scottish Office]]. Areas for which legislative responsibility remains with the UK Government include national security, terrorism, firearms and drugs. The [[Police (Scotland) Act 1967]], as amended, was the basis for the organisation and jurisdiction of the eight former territorial forces in Scotland that were formed in 1975. These forces covered one or more of the areas of the [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government regions]] established in the 1975 local government reorganisation (and since abolished), with minor adjustments to align with the post-1996 [[subdivisions of Scotland|council area]] borders. These forces provided the majority of police services to the public of Scotland, although Scottish police officers also have limited jurisdiction throughout the rest of the United Kingdom as required (See above comments under English and Welsh forces).

In 2011, the [[Scottish Government]] announced that it planned to amalgamate the eight territorial forces in Scotland, along with the [[Scottish Crime and Drug Enforcement Agency]], into a single agency. The [[Police and Fire Reform (Scotland) Act 2012]], an Act of the [[Scottish Parliament]], codified this amalgamation and brought about the new [[Police Scotland|Police Service of Scotland]] (to be known as "Police Scotland"). The new force was established on 1 April 2013.
{{legend|#0086BE|[[Police Scotland]]}}

In 2017, plans were being debated in the Scottish Parliament to merge railway policing with Police Scotland.

As of December 2012, police numbers in Scotland were:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/|title=Police Scotland - Police Scotland|first=Scottish Police Services|last=Authority|website=www.scotland.police.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407051805/http://www.scotland.police.uk/about-us/police-scotland/|archivedate=7 April 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Police officers: 17,436
*[[Special Constable|Special constables]]: 1,404
*Other staff: 6,168

&lt;small&gt;Community Support Officers, commonly referred to as "Police Community Support Officers", were established by Section 38(2) of the Police Reform Act 2002, which applies only to England and Wales.  There are therefore no Community Support Officers in Scotland.&lt;/small&gt;

===Northern Ireland===
[[File:Map of Northern Ireland Police area in the United Kingdom.svg|right|225px]]
County and borough based police forces were not formed in Ireland as they were in Great Britain, with instead a single [[Royal Irish Constabulary]] covering most of Ireland (the exceptions being the [[Dublin Metropolitan Police]], which was responsible for policing in [[Dublin]], and the [[Belfast Town Police]] force, which was replaced by the RIC in the 1880s). The [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] was formed in 1922 after the establishment of the [[Irish Free State]], and served until the reforms of the police under the terms established initially by the [[Good Friday Agreement]] of 1998 undertaken by the [[Independent Commission on Policing for Northern Ireland|Patten Commission]], which led to the renaming of the RUC in 2001. The [[Police (Northern Ireland) Act 2000]] sets out the basis for the organisation and function of the police force in the province. Until 2010, police powers were not transferred to the devolved [[Northern Ireland Executive]], unlike Scotland, instead remaining with the [[Northern Ireland Office]]. However, in January 2010 agreement was reached between the two largest parties in the Assembly, the [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] and [[Sinn Féin]], over a course that would see them assume responsibility for policing and justice from April.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8459824.stm What will happen when policing and justice is devolved?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140508095422/http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/8459824.stm |date=8 May 2014 }} – BBC News, 05/02/10&lt;/ref&gt;
{{legend|#0086BE|[[Police Service of Northern Ireland]]}}

As of April 2007 police numbers in Northern Ireland were:&lt;ref name="strengthmap" /&gt;
*Police officers: 7,216
*Full-time reserve police officers: 335
*Part-time police officers: 684
*Other staff: 2,265

&lt;small&gt;Police in Northern Ireland do not employ Police Community Support Officers&lt;/small&gt;

===Naming===
County police forces traditionally bore the name "[[constabulary]]" upon their formation (as a derivation of "[[constable]]"). The reorganisation of police forces over the years has seen this name dropped in favour of "police" as a name, as many have decided that the word "constabulary" is confusing for people more used to searching for the word "police".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Name change for police force |author= |url=http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Ello-ello-ello-police-force-changes/story-11431850-detail/story.html |newspaper=This is Cornwall |date=8 March 2010 |accessdate=26 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120503105408/http://www.thisiscornwall.co.uk/Ello-ello-ello-police-force-changes/story-11431850-detail/story.html |archivedate=3 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a number of police forces in the areas overseen by the United Kingdom retain the name "constabulary":
*12 territorial forces in England
*3 special police forces - [[Ministry of Defence Police]], [[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] &amp; [[British Transport Police]]
*1 [[Isle of Man Constabulary|territorial force]] in the [[crown dependencies]]
*1 [[Kew Constabulary|parks police force]] (under the terms of the Parks Regulation Act 1872)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=An Act for the regualtion of Royal Parks and Gardens|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1872/15/pdfs/ukpga_18720015_en.pdf|publisher=UK Government|accessdate=25 April 2015|date=27 June 1872|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130627044055/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1872/15/pdfs/ukpga_18720015_en.pdf|archivedate=27 June 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National law enforcement==

===Bodies with police powers===
These bodies operate in more than one county of the United Kingdom. The remit of some of the forces is further limited to the areas that they police, such as railway infrastructure. The [[Anti-terrorism, Crime and Security Act 2001]] gave the British Transport Police and Ministry of Defence Police a limited, conditional authority to act outside of their primary jurisdiction if the situation requires urgent police action and the local force are not readily available, or if they believe that there is risk to life or limb, or where they are assisting the local force.

;Government agencies
*[[National Crime Agency]] (NCA) – An agency that leads UK-wide activities to combat high-level crime such as organised crime. In addition, the NCA acts as the UK point of contact for foreign law enforcement agencies. It replaced the [[Serious Organised Crime Agency]] in 2013.
*[[Border Force]] is a part of the [[Home Office]], responsible for frontline border control operations at air, sea and rail ports in the United Kingdom. Employees of Border Force may be [[Immigration Officer]]s and/or [[customs officer]]s. They hold certain powers of arrest, detention and search in addition to those available to ''Any person''&lt;ref&gt;Part III Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984&lt;/ref&gt; in England and Wales or to any person in Scotland and Northern Ireland. Police-like powers are exercised by border officers and inland immigration enforcement officers. 
*[[Immigration Enforcement]] The agency also has a specialist criminal investigations directorate.
*[[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs]]. Since the creation of the UK Border Agency (now [[Border Force]]), staff of HMRC no longer perform frontline duties at [[port of entry|ports of entry]]. The remainder of the staff with law enforcement powers employed by [[HM Revenue and Customs|HMRC]] consists of the Criminal Investigation Branch, who, as [[customs officer]]s, continue to exercise the powers granted under the Customs Management Acts and the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984 including arrest.
*Environment Agency Fisheries Enforcement Officers/[[Water bailiff]]s have powers of a constable under the Salmon and Freshwater Fisheries Act 1975. Officers/bailiffs protect fish and combat related crime (e.g. poaching).

{{Anchor|Special police forces}}&lt;!-- Linked from [[Special police#United Kingdom]] --&gt;
Additionally, the following three government agencies are defined in legislation as "[[special police force]]s". As these forces are responsible to specific areas of infrastructure, they do not answer to the Home Office, but instead to the government department responsible for the area they police. All three forces do voluntarily submit themselves to [[HMIC]] inspection:
*[[Ministry of Defence Police]] – A police force tasked with providing armed security, uniformed policing, and investigative services to Ministry of Defence installations throughout the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0506/hc12/1206/1206.pdf|title=Ministry of Defence Police and Guarding Agency Annual Report 2005-2006|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926133434/http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc0506/hc12/1206/1206.pdf|archivedate=26 September 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Civil Nuclear Constabulary]] – A police force responsible for providing law enforcement and security at or within 5&amp;nbsp;km of any relevant nuclear site and for nuclear materials in transit within the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnc.police.uk/files/cnpacnc_annual_review_2006-2007.pdf CNPA/CNC Annual Review 2006–07] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926133437/http://www.cnc.police.uk/files/cnpacnc_annual_review_2006-2007.pdf |date=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[British Transport Police]] (Great Britain) – A police force responsible for providing law enforcement at certain railways and light-rail systems in Great Britain.&lt;ref name="strengthmap" /&gt;

;Bodies hosted by the Association of Chief Police Officers
*[[National Wildlife Crime Unit]] – A police unit run by the [[Association of Chief Police Officers|ACPO]] that gathers intelligence on wildlife crime and provides analytical and investigative support to law enforcement agencies across the United Kingdom.
*[[National Counter Terrorism Security Office]] – A police unit run by the ACPO, which advises the British government on its counter terrorism strategy.
*[[National Vehicle Crime Intelligence Service]] – A police unit run by the ACPO, tasked with combating organised vehicle crime and the use of vehicles in crime.

;Bodies hosted by territorial police forces
*[[National Domestic Extremism and Disorder Intelligence Unit]] – A police unit that is part of the Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Operations Directorate, tasked with coordinating police response to domestic extremism across the United Kingdom.
*[[Protection Command]] – A police unit that is part of the Metropolitan Police Service Specialist Operations Directorate, responsible for providing protective security to the government/diplomatic community and the Royal Family within the United Kingdom.
*[[National Fraud Intelligence Bureau]] – A police unit hosted by the City of London Police, tasked with combating economic crime throughout the United Kingdom.
*[[National Ballistics Intelligence Service]] (Great Britain) – A police unit hosted by West Midlands Police, tasked with gathering and disseminating fast time intelligence on the criminal use of firearms across Great Britain.
*[[National Police Air Service]] (England and Wales) – A police aviation service hosted by West Yorkshire Police, that provides centralised air support to the 43 territorial police forces in England and Wales.

===Bodies with limited executive powers===
These organisations are not police forces but do have similar powers to that of the police with the exception that they cannot arrest a person nor make forcible entry without a warrant.
*[[Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency]] (Great Britain)
*[[Driver and Vehicle Agency]] (Northern Ireland)

==Miscellaneous police forces==
These police forces generally come under the control of a local authority, public trusts or even private companies; examples include some ports police and the Mersey Tunnels Police. They could have been established by individual [[Act of Parliament|Acts of Parliament]] or under common law powers. Jurisdiction is generally limited to the relevant area of private property alone and in some cases (e.g. docks and harbours) the surrounding area. This, together with the small size of the police forces, means they are often reliant on the territorial force for the area under whose jurisdiction they fall to assist with any serious matter. The statutory responsibility for law and order sits with the territorial police forces even if there is a specialist police force in the locality. These police forces do not have independent Police Authorities and their founding statutes (if any) do not generally prescribe their structure and formation.

===Ports police===
There are two types of [[port police]] in the United Kingdom — most are sworn in under the 1847 Act, but a few have Acts specific to their port.

;Ports police operating under the Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847
For every port/harbour, an individual Act of Parliament (or, more recently, a Harbour (Revision) Order) can incorporate parts of the [[Harbours, Docks, and Piers Clauses Act 1847]] (HDPCA) and apply them to that specific port/harbour. Officers of port police forces are sworn in as "[[special constable]]s" under section 79 of the 1847 Act, as incorporated by the individual local Act. As a result, officers have the full powers of a constable on any land owned by the harbour, dock, or port and at any place within one mile of any owned land.

The [[Marine Navigation Act 2013]] has potentially enabled ports contables in England &amp; Wales to act as constables beyond this one mile limit, in relation to policing purposes connected with the port only, in a [[police area]] where consent has been obtained from the relevant Chief Constable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/23/section/7/enacted|title=Marine Navigation Act 2013|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|access-date=2017-12-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171217014059/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2013/23/section/7/enacted|archivedate=17 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This act does not however give general police powers to ports constables beyond their core jurisdiction as set out in the 1847 act, merely in relation to policing purposes connected to the port as set out in the Act.  As of 2014, 3 ports police forces (Dover, Teesport and Bristol) have sought and received consent from the local Chief Constable, with a fourth (Liverpool) in the process of applying for it.  This has enabled these 3 ports forces to act as constables, in relation to policing purposes connected to the port, throughout the police area in which they are geographically located.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2014-07-03/203891|title=Police: Ports:Written question - 203891|website=UK Parliament|access-date=2017-12-16|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171216201500/http://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-question/Commons/2014-07-03/203891|archivedate=16 December 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are 224 constables sworn in under the 1847 Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/shippingports/ports/accountabilityreview?page=8 |title=Accountability and Standards of the Port Police Forces |publisher=Dft.gov.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-06-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406093527/http://www.dft.gov.uk/pgr/shippingports/ports/accountabilityreview?page=8 |archivedate=6 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Serious or major incidents or crime generally become the responsibility of the local territorial police force.

===Parks police===

;Parks not controlled by local authorities
These small constabularies are responsible for policing specific land and parks. Officers of these forces have the powers of a constable within their limited jurisdiction. They are not ''constables'' as dealt with in the general Police Acts.

;Parks controlled by local authorities

[[File:Birmingham Parks Police photo.jpg|right|thumb|A photograph of officers of the Birmingham Parks Police, taken between c. 1900 and 1910.]]
Over history, a number of local authorities outside London have maintained their own parks police forces, the most notable being Liverpool ([[Liverpool Parks Police]]) and Birmingham ([[Birmingham Parks Police]]). No local authority parks police forces currently exist outside London, although the legal powers for them to do so (granted by various local Acts of Parliament) survive in a limited number of cases.

In London, these constabularies are responsible for enforcing byelaws within the parks and open spaces of their respective local authorities. Members of the constabularies are sworn as [[Constable#United Kingdom|constables]] under article 18 of the Greater London Parks and Open Spaces Order 1967.&lt;ref&gt;The 1967 order is scheduled to the [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1967/29/contents/enacted Ministry of Housing and Local Government Provisional Order Confirmation (Greater London Parks and Open Spaces) Act 1967] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161112172840/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukla/1967/29/contents/enacted |date=12 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of the constabularies are constables only in relation to the enforcement of the parks byelaws (which, by definition, apply only in the parks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kelly|first=Amanda|title=THE MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF THE RESPONSE BRANCH OF THE COUNCIL’S CRIME AND ANTI-SOCIAL BEHAVIOUR SERVICE|url=http://www.newham.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ED1C2C59-4028-4BFA-AA8A-3AFF6F389882/0/asbr.pdf|work=Website of London Borough of Newham Council|publisher=London Borough of Newham Council|accessdate=26 December 2011|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120209045646/http://www.newham.gov.uk/NR/rdonlyres/ED1C2C59-4028-4BFA-AA8A-3AFF6F389882/0/asbr.pdf|archivedate=9 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Service Police are PACE trained and all investigations are PACE compliant.  They make regular use of civilian police facilities often conducting joint investigations where necessary. The Service Police are able to investigate all crime within their jurisdiction, up to and including Murder, however within the UK, offences of murder and sudden deaths are passed to the local police force as per national jurisdiction agreements.

Whilst operating in conflict zones the military police will conduct the full range of policing including murder investigations as evidenced by the Sgt Blackman investigation.&lt;ref name="PACE 1984"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents|title=Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507161506/http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1984/60/contents|archivedate=7 May 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Wikimedia Foundation''' has been involved in several [[lawsuit]]s. Some of them have gone in favor of the Foundation, others have gone against it.

==Outcomes in favor of the plaintiffs==
In May 2011, [[Louis Bacon]] obtained a court order against the [[Wikimedia Foundation]] to compel it to reveal the identity of the editors who defamed him on [[Wikipedia]]. However, the order was obtained in the UK, and is therefore unenforceable in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2011/may/09/us-billionaire-wikipedia-defamation|title=US billionaire wins high court order over Wikipedia 'defamation'|publisher=The Guardian|date=May 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/luisakroll/2011/05/10/u-s-law-protects-anonymous-speech-not-billionaires/|title=U.S. Law Protects Anonymous Speech, Not Billionaires|publisher=[[Forbes]]|date=May 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Outcomes in favor of the Wikimedia Foundation==
Barbara Bauer, a literary agent, sued Wikimedia Foundation (which owns Wikipedia) for defamation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/05/07/wikipedia_eff_defamation_immunity_lawsuit/ |title=Wikipedia goes to court to defend defamation immunity |publisher=The Register |date=May 7, 2008 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Beaumont |first=Claudine |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1946275/Wikipedia-fights-defamation-lawsuit.html |title=Wikipedia fights defamation lawsuit |publisher=Telegraph |date=May 11, 2008 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She claimed that a Wikipedia entry branded her the “dumbest” literary agent.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;  But the case was dismissed because of the [[Communications Decency Act]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citmedialaw.org/threats/bauer-v-wikimedia|title=Bauer v. Wikimedia|publisher=[[Citizen Media Law Project]]|date=May 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Professional golfer [[Fuzzy Zoeller]], who also felt he was defamed on Wikipedia, did not sue Wikipedia because he was told that his suit would not prevail in light of the Communications Decency Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1946275/Wikipedia-fights-defamation-lawsuit.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Wikipedia fights defamation lawsuit | first=Claudine | last=Beaumont | date=May 11, 2008 | accessdate=September 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then sued the Miami firm from whose computers the edits were made, but later dropped the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dmlp.org/threats/zoeller-v-josef-silny-associates |title=Zoeller v. Josef Silny &amp; Associates |publisher=[[Digital Media Law Project]] |accessdate=December 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, three French nationals sued the Wikimedia Foundation when an article on Wikipedia described them as gay activists.&lt;ref name="theinquirer1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/1002559/wiki-cleared-defamation |title=Wikipedia cleared of defamation |publisher=The Inquirer |date=November 2, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2007/11/02/us-france-wikipedia-court-idUSL0280486220071102 |title=Wikipedia cleared in French defamation case |publisher=Reuters |date=November 2, 2007 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A French court dismissed the defamation and privacy case, ruling that the Foundation was not legally responsible for information in Wikipedia articles.&lt;ref name="reuters2007"/&gt;  The judge ruled that a 2004 French law limited the Foundation's liability, and found that the content had already been removed.&lt;ref name="theinquirer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters2007"/&gt;  He found that the Foundation was not legally required to check the information on Wikipedia, and that "Web site hosts cannot be liable under civil law because of information stored on them if they do not in fact know of their illicit nature."&lt;ref name="reuters2007"/&gt;  He did not rule whether the information was defamatory.&lt;ref name="theinquirer1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="reuters2007"/&gt;

Sylvia Scott Gibson, author of ''[[Latawnya, the Naughty Horse, Learns to Say "No" to Drugs]]'', sued Wikipedia for describing her book.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/doc/45079183/Gibson-v-Amazon-Complaint Gibson v Amazon complaint]&lt;/ref&gt; Her suit was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;[https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/cacdce/5:2011cv00021/491638/142 Sylvia Scott Gibson et al v. Amazon.com] (Document 142) on Justia&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other alleged defamation==

[[John Seigenthaler]], an American writer and journalist, contacted Wikipedia in 2005 after his article was edited to incorrectly state that he had been thought for a brief time to be involved in the assassinations of John Kennedy and Bobby Kennedy. The content was present in the article for four months.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="findlaw1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://writ.news.findlaw.com/ramasastry/20051212.html |title=FindLaw's Writ – Ramasastry: Is an Online Encyclopedia, Such as Wikipedia, Immune From Libel Suits? |publisher=Writ.news.findlaw.com |date=December 12, 2005 |accessdate=April 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seigenthaler called Wikipedia a "flawed and irresponsible research tool," and criticized the protection the Communications Decency Act provided to Wikipedia.&lt;ref name="telegraph1"/&gt;

The representative for the [[American Academy of Financial Management]], George Mentz, suggested that either phony or incompetent Wikipedia editors were creating legal problems for Wikimedia in May 2013, because of alleged intentional false claims that had been published on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AAFM ® Legal Complaint FOR Defamation, Libel and Fraud To Wikipedia/Wikimedia Legal Offices.|url=http://aafm.us/wikimedialawsuit.html|work=AAFM|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==DMCA takedown notices==

[[Texas Instruments]] sent a [[DMCA takedown notice]] to the Wikimedia Foundation because certain cryptographic keys were made public in the [[Texas Instruments signing key controversy]] article. A Wikipedia editor later filed a counter-notice, Texas Instruments did not reply in 10–14 business days as required by the [[Digital Millennium Copyright Act|DMCA]], and the keys were restored to the article.

Two other articles also came under the purview of Wikipedia's office actions because of the DMCA: [[Damon Dash]] and [[Conventional PCI]].&lt;ref&gt;See [[WP:OFFICELIST]] for more information.&lt;/ref&gt;

==FBI seal controversy==
In July 2010, the [[FBI]] sent a letter to the Wikimedia Foundation demanding that it cease and desist from using its seal on Wikipedia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from FBI to Wikimedia|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/us/20100803-wiki-LetterFromLarson.pdf|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=July 22, 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818194345/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/us/20100803-wiki-LetterFromLarson.pdf | archivedate=August 18, 2014 |deadurl=no|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI claimed that such practice was illegal and threatened to sue. In reply, Wikimedia counsel [[Michael Godwin]] sent a counter notice to the FBI claiming that Wikipedia was not in the wrong when it displayed the FBI seal on its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Letter from Wikimedia to FBI|url=http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/us/20100803-wiki-LetterToLarson.pdf|accessdate=August 16, 2012|date=July 30, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140818194343/http://graphics8.nytimes.com/packages/pdf/us/20100803-wiki-LetterToLarson.pdf | archivedate=August 18, 2014 |deadurl=no|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He defended Wikipedia's actions and also refused to remove the seal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwartz|first=John|title=F.B.I., Challenging Use of Seal, Gets Back a Primer on the Law|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/03fbi.html?_r=1|accessdate=August 16, 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=August 2, 2010| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141206234156/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/03/us/03fbi.html?_r=2&amp; | archivedate=December 6, 2014 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==NSA lawsuit==
{{Main|Wikimedia Foundation v. NSA}}
In March 2015, the Wikimedia Foundation, along with other groups, sued the [[National Security Agency]] over its [[Upstream collection|upstream]] [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|mass surveillance program]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/03/10/us-usa-nsa-wikipedia-idUSKBN0M60YA20150310 | title=NSA sued by Wikimedia, rights groups over mass surveillance | work=Reuters | date=10 March 2015 | accessdate=28 August 2015 | author=Ingram, David}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2487">A concept of [[English law]] that has been adopted in [[India]], a '''misrepresentation'''  is an untrue or misleading&lt;ref&gt;''[[Royal Mail Case|R v Kylsant]]'' [1931]&lt;/ref&gt;  statement of fact made during negotiations by one party to another, which then induces that other party into the contract. The misled party may normally [[Rescission (contract law)|rescind]] the contract, and sometimes may be awarded damages as well (or instead of rescission).

==In India (under IPC section-90)==
In India, the federal laws defines misrepresentation under "Misconception Of Fact". This is dealt with under the [[Indian Penal Code]] in Section 90, which states:

Consent given firstly under fear of injury, and secondly under a misconception of fact, is not consent at all.

That is what is explained in the first part of Section 90. There are two grounds specified in Section 90 which are analogous to coercion and mistake of fact which are the familiar grounds that can vitiate a transaction under the jurisprudence of India and other countries. The factors set out in first part of Section 90 are from the point of view of the victim; the second part of Section 90 enacts the corresponding provision from the point of view of the accused. It envisages that the accused has knowledge of - or reason to believe that - the consent was given by the victim in consequence of fear of injury or misconception of fact. Thus the second part lays emphasis on the knowledge or reasonable belief of the person who obtains the tainted consent. The requirements of both parts should be cumulatively satisfied. In other words, the Court has to determine whether the person giving the consent has done so under fear or misconception of fact; the court should also be satisfied that the person doing the act (i.e. the alleged offender) is conscious of the fact or should have reason to think that but for the fear or misconception, the consent would not have been given. This is the scheme of Section 90 which is couched in negative terminology.

==Vitiating factors==
Misrepresentation is one of several [[vitiating factor]]s that can affect the validity of a contract. Other vitiating factors include:
* [[Mistake (contract law)|Mistake]]
* [[Undue influence]]
* [[Duress in English law]]
* [[Duress in American law]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4122">'''Name-dropping''' is the practice of naming or alluding to important people and institutions within a [[conversation]],&lt;ref name="lat"&gt;{{citation|title=It's Hard to Eradicate the Name-Dropping Pest|first=Leonard|last=Wibberley|journal=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 24, 1950}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[narrative|story]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Bibliographic name-dropping|first=Harry C.|last=Bauer|journal=Library Review|volume=17|issue=6|year=1960|pages=408–410|doi=10.1108/eb012326}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[song]], [[online identity]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Public displays of connection|first1=J.|last1=Donath|first2=D.|last2=Boyd|journal=BT Technology Journal|volume=22|issue=4|year=2004|pages=71–82|doi=10.1023/B:BTTJ.0000047585.06264.cc}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or other communication.  The term often connotes an attempt to impress others; it is usually regarded negatively,&lt;ref name="lat"/&gt; and under certain circumstances may constitute a breach of [[professional ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=‘Yeah, I work with Beckham’: Issues of confidentiality, privacy and privilege in sport  psychology service delivery|first=Mark B.|last=Anderson|pages=3–13|journal=Sport &amp; Exercise Psychology Review|volume=1|issue=2|year=2005|url=https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151005164006/https://ess220.files.wordpress.com/2008/02/2005volume2.pdf|archivedate=2015-10-05|deadurl=no}}.&lt;/ref&gt; When used as part of a logical [[argument]] it can be an example of the [[false authority]] [[fallacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Understanding arguments|first1=Donald|last1=Evans|first2=Humphrey|last2=Palmer|publisher=Drake Educational Associates|year=1986|page=286}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 'shout-out' can be regarded as a type of name-dropping where someone's name, or a list of names, is spoken out in order to direct attention towards these groups or individuals, often as a means of expressing [[wikt:kudos|kudos]] or making a referral.

==Purposes==
Name-dropping is used to position oneself within a [[social hierarchy]].  It is often used to create a sense of superiority by raising one's status.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}  By implying (or directly asserting) a connection to people of high status, the name-dropper hopes to raise his or her own [[social status]] to a level closer to that of those whose names he or she has dropped, and thus elevate himself or herself above, or into, present company.

Name-dropping can also be used to identify people with a common bond.  By indicating the names of people one knows, one makes known his or her [[social circle]], providing an opportunity for others with similar connections to relate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|contribution=Name-Dropping|title=5 steps to professional presence: how to project confidence, competence, and credibility at work|first1=Susan|last1=Bixler|first2=Lisa Scherrer|last2=Dugan|publisher=Adams Media|year=2000|isbn=978-1-58062-442-8|pages=154–155}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

As a form of [[appeal to authority]], name-dropping can be an important form of informal [[argument]]ation, as long as the name being dropped is of someone who is an expert on the subject of the argument and that person's views are accurately represented.

==Methods==
{{Expand section|date=May 2011}}
Use of the first name may be effective, as in the case of "Kingsley" for [[Kingsley Amis]].&lt;ref name="Knack"&gt;Joseph Epstein, "A Nice Little Knack for Name Dropping" in ''Narcissus Leaves the Pool'', Houghton Mifflin Harcourt, 2007, p. 80ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Name-dropping is also sometimes used in works of fiction to place a story in a certain historical timeframe, or to imply the involvement of a historical figure in the action (for example, in a story set during World War II, mentioning [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Winston Churchill]]). {{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

'''''[[National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality]] and Others v [[Minister of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Minister of Home Affairs]] and Others''''', [[Case citation|[1999] ZACC 17]], is a 1999 decision of the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa]] which extended to same-sex partners the same benefits granted to spouses in the issuing of immigration permits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Muted welcome to gay couples decision |newspaper=Independent Online |date=2 December 1999 |url=http://www.iol.co.za/news/politics/muted-welcome-to-gay-couples-decision-1.21602 |accessdate=2 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first Constitutional Court case to deal with the recognition of same-sex partnerships, and also the first case in which a South African court adopted the remedy of "reading in" to correct an unconstitutional law. The case is of particular importance in the areas of civil procedure, immigration, and constitutional law and litigation.

In the area of constitutional litigation, the court considered its powers where it has declared a law or provision to be inconsistent with the Constitution. It found that, where the constitutional invalidity resulted from an omission in the legislation, it was not possible to cure the defect by way of notional severance. The only logical equivalent of severance, the court determined, is "reading in," which can be an appropriate form of relief under section 38 of the Constitution. Whether the court reads in or strikes out words from a challenged law, the focus should be on the appropriate remedy, not on the label used to arrive at the result.

==Background==
The [[Aliens Control Act, 1991|Aliens Control Act]] was the primary statute governing immigration law; it required that any foreigner who wanted to permanently move to South Africa obtain an immigration permit. Section 25(5) of the act authorized the [[Department of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Department of Home Affairs]] to issue an immigration permit to the spouse of a South African citizen or permanent resident, even if that spouse would not otherwise meet the requirements for such a permit.&lt;ref name="louw"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Louw |first1=Ronald |year=2000 |title=Gay and Lesbian Partner Immigration and the Redefining of Family: ''National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs'' |journal=South African Journal on Human Rights |volume=16 |pages=313–324}}&lt;/ref&gt; Section 28(2), meanwhile, allowed the [[Minister of Home Affairs (South Africa)|Minister of Home Affairs]] to grant exemptions from the permit requirement in special circumstances.

On 27 April 1994 the [[Interim Constitution of South Africa]], which contained a section prohibiting unfair discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation, came into force; on 4 February 1997 it was replaced by the final [[Constitution of South Africa]], which contained [[section 9 of the Constitution of South Africa|an identical provision]]. After 1994 the [[National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality]] (NGCLE) entered into negotiations with the Department of Home Affairs on various issues, including the recognition of same-sex relationships for immigration purposes. The negotiations were initially successful, and the department agreed to consider the foreign same-sex partners of South Africans for exemptions under section 28(2); at least thirteen such exemptions were granted during 1997. In January 1998, however, the department changed its policy, deciding that same-sex partners did not qualify for the "special circumstances" requirement.&lt;ref name="motara"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Motara |first1=Shireen |year=2000 |title=Making the Bill of Rights a Reality for Gay and Lesbian Couples: ''National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs'' |journal=South African Journal on Human Rights |volume=16 |pages=344–350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NCGLE, joined by six same-sex couples and the [[Commission for Gender Equality]], asked the [[Cape Provincial Division]] of the [[High Court of South Africa|High Court]] to declare section 25(5) of the Aliens Control Act to be invalid because it discriminated on the basis of sexual orientation and therefore violated the constitutional right to equality. The three-judge panel of the High Court handed down its decision in February 1999, ruling that the section was indeed unconstitutional. So that spouses were not immediately deprived of immigration benefits, the order was suspended for twelve months to allow Parliament to correct the unconstitutionality. The court ruled that, in the interim, "special circumstances" existed and that same-sex partners were to receive section 28(2) exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;''National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs'' 1999 (3) SA 173, 1999 (3) BCLR 280 (12 February 1999), [[Cape Provincial Division]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The government appealed the High Court's decision to the Constitutional Court; the Constitution also requires that any court order that declares an Act of Parliament to be unconstitutional be confirmed by the Constitutional Court.

== Judgment ==
The Constitutional Court heard oral argument on 17 August 1999, and its unanimous judgment was delivered on 2 December. The opinion was authored by Justice [[Lourens Ackermann]].

The basis of the NCGLE's case was that providing immigration benefits to "spouses"{{dash}}necessarily opposite-sex couples{{dash}}that were not available to same-sex couples amounted to unfair discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. [[Section 9 of the Constitution of South Africa|Section 9(3) of the Constitution]] states that "the state may not unfairly discriminate directly or indirectly against anyone on one or more grounds, including [...] sexual orientation." They also argued that it discriminated on the basis of marital status, also a prohibited ground under section 9(3).

The government argued that the case was not "[[Ripeness|ripe]]" for the court to hear, claiming that the committees responsible for approving immigration permits could interpret the word "spouse" to include same-sex partners and that the law would then not be discriminatory. The court disagreed, stating that "spouse" could not reasonably be extended to include unmarried partners; as same-sex marriages were not (at that time) legal or recognised in South African law, the law as written could not be interpreted to include same-sex partners.&lt;ref name="louw"/&gt; The government also argued that immigration policy was at the complete discretion of the government and that foreign nationals did not have the right to equality in immigration decisions. The court, without accepting the validity of this argument, dismissed it as irrelevant, stating that the rights of the South African partners were also affected by the government's policy.&lt;ref name="motara" /&gt;

Addressing the discrimination directly, the government denied that it was based on sexual orientation, arguing that it was based on "non-spousal" grounds not protected by section 9(3). The court dismissed this argument, as well the government's alternative argument that gays and lesbians were free to marry partners of the opposite sex and thus obtain the benefits of marriage. Justice Ackermann described this second argument as "a meaningless abstraction". The court ruled that section 25(5) was indeed discriminatory on the overlapping grounds of sexual orientation and marital status.&lt;ref name="motara" /&gt; According to section 9(5) of the Constitution, discrimination on these grounds is presumed to be unfair unless it can be proved otherwise. Although unfairness was presumed, the court proceeded to examine the impact of the discrimination on gays and lesbians, noting that they were a vulnerable minority who had suffered from past disadvantage.&lt;ref name="motara"/&gt; In a passage repeatedly quoted in subsequent decisions on the rights of same-sex couples, Justice Ackermann describes "the facts concerning gays and lesbians and their same-sex partnerships":&lt;ref name="louw"/&gt;
{{Quote|Gays and lesbians in same-sex life partnerships are as capable as heterosexual spouses of expressing and sharing love in its manifold forms including affection, friendship, ''[[eros (concept)|eros]]'' and charity;

They are likewise as capable of forming intimate, permanent, committed, monogamous, loyal and enduring relationships; of furnishing emotional and spiritual support; and of providing physical care, financial support and assistance in running the common household;

They are individually able to adopt children and in the case of lesbians to bear them;

In short, they have the same ability to establish a ''[[consortium omnis vitae]]'';

Finally [...] they are capable of constituting a family, whether nuclear or extended, and of establishing, enjoying and benefiting from family life which is not distinguishable in any significant respect from that of heterosexual spouses.}}
In light of these facts, the court ruled that the discrimination had the effect of reinforcing harmful stereotypes about gays and lesbians.

The government's final argument was that the discrimination was fair because it served the public purpose of protecting the institution of marriage. This, too, was dismissed, with the court stating that there was no rational connection between denying benefits to same-sex couples and the protection of marriage. The court held that section 25(5) amounted to unfair discrimination and therefore infringed on the right to equality as well as the right to human dignity. Not finding any opposing interest that could justify these severe infringements, the court declared the section to be unconstitutional.&lt;ref name="motara"/&gt;

=== Reading in ===
The High Court had remedied the unconstitutionality by declaring section 25(2) invalid, but suspending the declaration and providing interim relief for the affected couples. The Constitutional Court decided that, in cases where a law is unconstitutional because of an omission, the courts may apply the technique of "reading in" to insert words to extend the law. The court laid down certain conditions, requiring that the words to be read in can be precisely defined, and that they should not interfere too greatly with the intent of Parliament.&lt;ref name="motara"/&gt;

Ackermann was persuaded by the submission of Advocate [[Wim Trengove]] (counsel for the appellants) that, as far as deference to the Legislature was concerned, there was no difference, in principle, between the court's rendering a statutory provision constitutional by removing the offending part by actual or notional severance, and the court's doing the same thing by reading words into a statutory provision. In both cases, the parliamentary enactment, as expressed in a statutory provision, was being altered by the order of the court—in the one case by excision and in the other by addition.&lt;ref&gt;Para 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

"This chance difference," wrote Ackermann, "cannot by itself establish a difference in principle." The only relevant enquiry, he held, was what the consequences of such an order were, and whether they constituted an unconstitutional intrusion into the domain of the Legislature. Any other conclusion would lead to what he described as

&lt;blockquote&gt;the absurdity that the granting of a remedy would depend on the fortuitous circumstance of the form in which the Legislature had chosen to enact the provision in question. A Legislature could, for example, extend certain benefits to life-partners generally and exclude same-sex life partners by way of express exception. In such case there would be no objection to declaring the exception invalid, where a Court was satisfied that such severance was, on application of whatever the appropriate test might be, constitutionally justified in relation to the Legislature. It would be absurd to deny the reading-in remedy, where it was equally constitutionally justified in relation to the Legislature, simply because of its form.&lt;ref&gt;Para 68.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There was, Ackermann found, "nothing in the Constitution to suggest that form must be placed above substance in a way that would result in so glaring an anomaly."&lt;ref&gt;Para 69.&lt;/ref&gt; He concluded, accordingly, that reading in, "depending on all the circumstances," was an appropriate form of relief under section 38 of the Constitution. He quoted with approval the Canadian case of ''[[Knodel v British Columbia (Medical Services Commission)]]'': "Whether a court 'reads in' or 'strikes out' words from a challenged law, the focus of the Court should be on the appropriate remedy in the circumstances and not on the label used to arrive at the result." The real question, according to Ackermann, was "whether, in the circumstances of the present matter, reading in would be just and equitable and an appropriate remedy."&lt;ref&gt;Paras 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retrospective effect ===
In this case, the words "or partner, in a permanent same-sex life partnership," were inserted after the word "spouse".&lt;ref name="louw"/&gt; The court ruled that the order would not be retrospective, as partners whose applications for a permit had previously been denied were free to reapply in light of the new situation.&lt;ref name="motara"/&gt;

==Subsequent developments==
In 2002 the Aliens Control Act was replaced by a new [[Immigration Act, 2002|Immigration Act]], in which the word "spouse" was defined as including "a person who is party to ... a permanent homosexual or heterosexual relationship which calls for cohabitation and mutual financial and emotional support, and is proven by a prescribed affidavit substantiated by a notarial contract."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Human Rights Watch |author2=Immigration Equality |title=Family, Unvalued: Discrimination, Denial, and the Fate of Binational Same-Sex Couples under U.S. Law |url=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/us0506/index.htm |accessdate=16 February 2012 |year=2006 |publisher=Human Rights Watch |isbn=1-56432-336-6 |chapter=Appendix B: Countries Protecting Same-Sex Couples’ Immigration Rights |chapterurl=https://www.hrw.org/reports/2006/us0506/10.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision in ''National Coalition for Gay and Lesbian Equality v Minister of Home Affairs'' was followed by a series of judgments extending to same-sex couples other benefits of marriage, including adoption, medical and pension benefits, artificial insemination, and intestate inheritance. In December 2005 the Constitutional Court ruled in ''[[Minister of Home Affairs v Fourie]]'' that Parliament was required to extend marriage to same-sex couples, which it duly did with the passage of the [[Civil Union Act, 2006|Civil Union Act]] in November 2006.

'''Offshore radio''' is [[radio]] broadcasting from ships or fixed maritime structures. Offshore broadcasters are usually unlicenced but transmissions are legal in [[international waters]]. This is in contrast to broadcasting without a licence on land or within a nation's [[territorial waters]], which is usually unlawful.

==History==
The claimed first wireless broadcast of music ''and'' speech for the purpose of entertainment was transmitted from a [[Royal Navy]] craft, [[HMS Andromeda (1897)|HMS ''Andromeda'']], in 1907. The broadcast was organized by a Lieutenant Quentin Crauford using the callsign QFP while the ship was anchored off [[Chatham, Kent|Chatham]] in the [[Thames Estuary]], [[England]].

However, the majority of offshore broadcasters have been unlicenced stations using seaborne broadcasting as a means to circumvent national broadcasting regulations, for example the practice has been used by broadcasting organizations like the [[Voice of America]] as a means of circumventing national broadcasting regulations of other nations. Unlicenced offshore commercial stations have operated off the coasts of [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Israel]], The [[Netherlands]], [[New Zealand]], [[Sweden]], The [[United Kingdom]], [[Yugoslavia]] and the [[United States]].

By the late 1920s, the "[[UK]] government concluded that radio was such a powerful means of mass communication that it would have to be in state control", and gave the publicly-funded [[BBC]] a monopoly on broadcasting. Because of rigid governmental controls and programming mostly consisting of serious music and highbrow issues, much of the UK population began to turn to radio stations [[border blaster|from abroad]], such as [[Radio Lyon]], [[Radio Normandy]], [[RTÉ|Radio Athlone]], [[Radio Mediterranee]] and [[Radio Luxembourg]], especially on Sundays, when the BBC did not carry any entertainment programmes. However, English-speaking broadcast hours were limited and parts of the UK were unable to receive most stations properly during the daytime.

The earliest attempt to establish an offshore broadcaster in England occurred in 1928, when [[Associated Newspapers]] (owners of the ''[[Daily Mail]]'') acquired the yacht Ceto and installed radio equipment. Unfortunately, the apparatus could not operate properly overboard, the signal being heavily affected by the climate conditions. The transmitter was then replaced by Siemens loudspeakers and the Ceto toured England "broadcasting" gramophone records interspersed by advertising.

Unauthorized offshore broadcasting stations operating from ships or fixed platforms in the coastal waters of the [[North Sea|Northern Sea]] first appeared in 1958. There were as many as eleven such stations in the mid-1960s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3647&amp;context=lcp HORACE B. ROBERTSON, JR. THE SUPPRESSION OF PIRATE RADIO BROADCASTING: A TEST CASE OF THE INTERNATIONAL SYSTEM FOR CONTROL OF ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE NATIONAL TERRITORY]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the most popular offshore radio broadcasts in Europe came from [[Radio Caroline]], which developed out both of the strict broadcasting regulations in England in the 1960s as well as the fact the major labels had left little to no airtime to less established acts.&lt;ref name=Chapman&gt;Robert Chapman, ''Selling the Sixties: The Pirates and Pop Music Radio'' London: :Routledge, 1992 {{ISBN|0415078172}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Radio Caroline name was used to broadcast from international waters, using five different ships of three different owners, from 1964 to 1990. Radio Caroline was the brainchild of Ronan O'Rahilly, who dreamed up a way to air music by "unestablished" rock and roll artists&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.radiocaroline.co.uk/#history_part_2.html&lt;/ref&gt; Other well-known stations of the period were [[Radio Atlanta]], [[Wonderful Radio London|Radio London]], [[Radio 270]] (broadcasting of the coast of [[Filey]], Yorkshire) [[Radio 390]], [[Radio Scotland]], [[Radio North Sea International|Radio Northsea International]] and [[Radio City (pirate radio station)|Radio City]].&lt;ref name=Chapman /&gt;

Most offshore broadcast is usually associated with European unlicenced radio stations; the trend never caught on as much in the [[United States]] as most organizations that could afford an offshore broadcasting boat would instead buy a legal station. Still, there were a few American offshore stations that made a lasting impression.  The first station to broadcast in the U.S. from international waters was [[RXKR]] off of the coast of [[California]].&lt;ref&gt;Yoder, Andrew R. Pirate Radio: The Incredible Saga of America's Underground, Illegal Broadcasters. Solana Beach, CA: HighText, 1996. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; and broadcast from May 1933 until August 1933. It was operated from a cargo carrier named the S.S. City of Panama, a ship that was actually supposed to be advertising tourism in [[Panama]] to Americans from [[California]]. The operators of the ship actually broadcast popular music and advertisements, fooling the Panamanian government and eventually being shut down at the request of the [[U.S. Department of State]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcasting-fleet.com/panama.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==Suppression==
Unlicenced ''Radio and TV Noordzee'' since August 1964 used [[REM island]] offshore platform for broadcasting aimed at the [[Netherlands]]. On December 12, 1964, a law, which split the North Sea into continental sections was passed in the Netherlands. The sea bed under REM Island, to which the structure was attached, was declared Dutch territory. Five days later, [[Netherlands Marine Corps|Royal Marines]] boarded the platform and ended the broadcasting.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Council of Europe]] in 1965 passed the "European Agreement for the Prevention of Broadcasts transmitted from Stations outside National Territories" to address this loophole, although some member states were slow to implement this in national law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://conventions.coe.int/Treaty/en/Treaties/Html/053.htm|title=European Agreement for the Prevention ofBroadcasts transmitted from Stations outside National Territories|date=22 January 1965|work=European Treaty Series|publisher=Council of Europe|pages=ETS No. 53|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.icce.rug.nl/~soundscapes/VOLUME06/Fight_free_radio.shtml |title=The fight for free radio |last=Rugge|first=Hans|date=October 2003 |journal=Soundscapes |issn=1567-7745 |volume=6 |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the UK Government enacted the [[Marine, &amp;c., Broadcasting (Offences) Act 1967]], outlawing advertising on or supplying an unlicensed offshore radio station from the UK. Several other European countries passed similar legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4306">'''Padayatra''' ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]], lit. ''journey by foot'') is a [[Travel|journey]] undertaken by a politicians or prominent citizens to interact more closely with different parts of society, educate about issues concerning them, and galvanize his or her supporters. Pada [[Yatra]]s or 'Foot pilgrimages' are also [[Hindu]] religious pilgrimages undertaken towards sacred shrines or pilgrimage sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.padayatra.com/history.php History of Padyatra] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/69MQ33ldO?url=http://www.padayatra.com/history.php |date=2012-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social causes==
[[Image:Marche sel.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Gandhi on the [[Salt March]], 1930]]

[[Mahatma Gandhi]] originated{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} the padayatra with his famous [[Salt March]] to [[Dandi, Gujarat|Dandi]] in 1930. In the winter of 1933-34, Gandhi went on a countrywide padayatra against untouchability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Where Gandhi Meets Ambedkar|author=Ramachandra Guha|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2005-11-08/edit-page/27860607_1_untouchability-padayatra-hindu |publisher=The Times of India |date=Nov 8, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Gandhian [[Vinoba Bhave]] also started a padyatra, which was part of his [[Bhoodan movement]] in 1951. Starting from [[Telangana]] region, Bhave concluded his padayatra at [[Bodh Gaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=15mSMA8LXhoC&amp;pg=PA135 | title=Reflections From Shillong: Speeches Of M.M.

[[File:Post Mart logo.png|thumb|Company logo]]

'''Post Mart''' is a joint-venture between [[China Post Group]] and U.S.-owned China Horizon Investments Group.



Post Mart provides consumer goods to people in rural China using the existing China Post network of hundreds of thousands of village postal stations as well as a network of distribution centers.



In January 2016 China Horizon Investments sued China Post for fraud and breach of contract in relation to this venture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Freifeld |first=Karen |date=13 January 2016 |title=China Post Group sued by investors in joint venture |publisher=[[Reuters]] |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/china-post-lawsuit-idUSL2N14X2FM20160113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
China Horizon Investments Group was founded in January 2007 by Alan Clingman for the purpose of investing in the growth of Chinese domestic consumption projects alongside major Chinese entities, especially state-owned entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chan |first1=Savio |last2=Zakkour |first2=Michael |year=2014 |title=China's Super Consumers: What 1 Billion Customers Want and How to Sell it to Them |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |pages=123-126 |isbn=9781118834749}}&lt;/ref&gt;

China Post is the official postal service of China. The State Post Bureau of the People's Republic of China, the owner of China Post, is both a regulatory authority and government-owned enterprise. Thus, it is responsible for the regulation of the national postal industry and the management of national postal enterprises. China Post also owns one of China’s largest banks, the EMS courier service, an insurance company and a large-scale distribution business.

Following a multi-year pilot program, regulatory approvals for the China Horizon and China Post Joint Venture were granted in September 2015.

The scope of the joint venture is to build a modern distribution system for consumer products, expanding upon the extensive China Post network in order to bring a variety of safe, affordable and appropriate products (including a wide selection of Post Mart branded products) to rural China with the added ambition of improving the lives of rural citizens.




The joint venture has a registered capital of RMB 1 billion and has a license to use the China Post brand.

== Operations ==
Post Mart has established an efficient route to market sales and delivery system in Henan. It plans to roll this out nationally, reaching 10 provinces within five years. There are currently more than 50,000 village postal stations in Henan.

Post Mart operates a loyalty program called the Post Mart Emerald Club.

== Products ==
Post Mart provides a range of daily supply products such as cooking oil, rice, household goods, personal items and beverages such as Coca-Cola. Their brands include Chinese brands, international brands and its own brand.

A '''prize crew''' is the selected members of a [[ship]] chosen to take over the operations of a captured ship. Prize crews were required to take their prize to appropriate [[prize court]]s, which would determine whether the ship's officers and crew had sufficient cause to have the value of the prize awarded to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keegan |first=John |authorlink =John Keegan |title =The Price of Admiralty |publisher =Viking |volume = |edition = |date =1989 |location =New York |page =279 |isbn =0-670-81416-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Age of Sail]] and up into the [[American Civil War]], capturing enemy ships was quite common. As a result, [[warships]] optimistically carried extra crew members for use as prize crews.{{cn|date=April 2016}}  More recently, as evidenced by results of sea battles during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]], ships generally were sunk, not captured. If, however, a ship is captured, a prize crew would be selected from the winning ship’s complement.

== Examples ==
* See {{USS|Nightingale|1851|6}} for prize crew and prize court example.
* in 1939, [[SS City of Flint (1919)|SS ''City of Flint'']] was captured by a German warship in the Atlantic and sailed to Norway. As Norway was neutral, the German prize crew were eventually interned and the vessel returned to her American owners.
* In 1941, a Royal Navy prize crew sailed the captured German U-boat ''[[U-570]]'' from Iceland to the United Kingdom.
* At the end of World War II, {{USS|Bangust|DE-739|6}} selected a prize crew to board the Japanese submarine {{ship|Japanese submarine|I-14||2}}.
* {{USS|Hanna|DE-449|6}} placed a prize crew on the Japanese ''[[Tachibana Maru]]'' at the end of [[World War II]].
* [[U.S. Coast Guard]] cutters capture vessels during drug interdiction operations, and then bring them to port using prize crews.

The procedures of the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] for hearing cases is established in the ''Rules of the Supreme Court of Canada'', the [[Supreme Court Act]], and by tradition.

==Terms and sittings==
Hearings of the Supreme Court take place exclusively in the Supreme Court building in Ottawa. The Court sits three times a year for three months at a time starting in January, April, and October. Every two weeks that the Court sits is followed by a two-week break making for a total of 18 weeks a year of hearings. The Mondays are often reserved for hearing [[Motion (legal)|motion]]s regarding ongoing appeals. The remaining days of the week the Court is used for hearings. The Court will hear one or two cases a day beginning at 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m.

Quorum of the Court requires five Justices, but most cases are heard by a panel of seven or nine Justices. The Chief Justice presides over each hearing.  If the Chief Justice is not available, the senior [[puisne justice]] on the panel will preside.

Hearings are live-streamed through the Court's website.  They are also video recorded for delayed telecast in both of Canada's official languages and are often aired on [[CPAC (TV channel)|CPAC]]. The Court's hearings are open to the public except for certain sensitive cases where a sealing order is enacted. There are three rows of benches reserved for public seating, which are generally taken on a first-come, first-served basis except where it is reserved by counsel or parties in the appeal.

==Leave to appeal==
Initially, all civil and criminal cases had the right to appeal to the Supreme Court. An amendment to the ''Supreme Court Act'' in 1975 required that parties wishing to appeal must apply for "leave to appeal". The only exception is a select type of more serious criminal cases where there continues to an appeal "as of right", as well as appeals from [[reference question]]s submitted to the provincial courts of appeal by the provincial governments.  The federal government also has the power to pose a reference to the Court on its own motion, as an original proceeding, without requiring leave from the Court.

Leave applications are considered by the justices in groups of three. Only cases which raise questions of public importance are granted.&lt;ref&gt;See the following: ''R. v. Gardiner'', [1982] 2 S.C.R. 368 at 397, ''MacDonald v. City of Montreal'', [1986] 1 S.C.R. 460 at 512 and ''R. v. Hinse'', [1995] 4 S.C.R. 597 at 610, 629.&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for their decisions on leave applications are not given.

==Hearings==
On the bench, the Chief Justice of Canada (or the senior puisne justice) presides from the centre chair with the other justices seated to the right and left of the Chief Justice by order of seniority of appointment.   At sittings of the Court, the justices usually appear in black silk robes but they wear their ceremonial robes of bright scarlet trimmed with Canadian white mink in court on special occasions and in the Senate at the opening of each new session of Parliament.

Historically, they were addressed as "My Lord/Lady" during sessions of the court, but the Court has indicated that it prefers that the judges be addressed as "Justice", "Mr Justice" or "Madam Justice".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scc-csc.ca/contact/faq/qa-qr-eng.aspx#f10 Supreme Court of Canada:  Frequently Asked Questions - "How does one address a judge?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each side is given one hour to make their submissions. Where there are multiple claimants or defendants they are required to split the time among them. However, in exceptional circumstances the parties may apply to the Court to have their time extended. [[intervention (law)|Intervener]]s are typically granted ten minutes to make their arguments.

==Reasons==
Occasionally, the Court may give judgment from the bench, either dismissing or allowing the appeal on the spot.  The Court may give short reasons explaining its decision at that time, or it may announce the outcome of the case, with reasons to follow.

The more common practice is that once the hearing is complete, the judges convene immediately in their conference room behind the court room to discuss the case. They sit at a round table in the conference room and each judge gives their opinion of the case, starting with the least senior judge. Typically, once the discussion is complete the justices make a tentative decision of the case, and in most cases a decision will be arrived at by the end the day. Retired Justice Binnie has coined the term the "sundown rule" for this practice. &lt;ref&gt;http://online.cle.bc.ca/CourseMaterial/pdfs/2001/262_13_1.pdf{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This practice was begun by Chief Justice Cartwright in the 1960s.  It was intended to reduce the number of separate reasons that the court was generating at the time and to maintain relations among the judges.&lt;ref&gt;see C. L'Heureux-Dube, "The Dissenting Opinion: Voice of the Future?" (2000) Osgoode Hall Law Journal.&lt;/ref&gt;

Except where the reasons are announced orally at the hearing, the Court normally reserves its decision.  While the case is on reserve, the judges spend a considerable amount of time producing detailed written reasons for judgment.  That process may take several months, or over a year.   There is normally a majority decision, but judges who disagree with the majority can write a minority opinion, dissenting in whole or in part from the majority.  Any judge can write a concurring opinion, agreeing with either the majority or the minority, or setting out the judge's own separate position. While the reasons for judgment are being developed, the may be rewritten several times.  There may be a significant amount of continued debate over how the propositions should be articulated and what should be left out. In the more divided cases, there is a possibility that a judge may switch sides during the process and change the outcome of the case.

{{Wiktionary|provost}}
A '''provost''' (introduced into [[Scots language|Scots]] from [[French language|French]]) is the ceremonial head of many [[Scottish local authorities]], and under the name '''''[[prévôt]]''''' ({{IPA-fr|pʁeˈvoː}}) was a governmental position of varying importance in [[Ancien Régime]] [[France]].

==History==
As a [[secular]] title, ''praepositus'' is also very old, dating to the ''[[praepositus sacri cubiculi]]'' of the late [[Roman Empire]], and the ''praepositus palatii'' of the [[Carolingian]] court. The title developed in [[France]] from where it found its way into [[Scots language|Scots]], where in [[Scotland]] it became the style (as ''provost'') of the principal magistrates of the [[Royal Burgh]]s (roughly speaking, the equivalent of "[[Mayors in the United Kingdom|mayor]]" in the rest of the [[United Kingdom|UK]]) ("[[Lord Provost]]" in [[Edinburgh]], [[Glasgow]], [[Aberdeen, Scotland|Aberdeen]] and [[Dundee, Scotland|Dundee]]), and into [[England]], where it is applied to certain officers charged with the maintenance of military discipline. A [[Provost Marshal]] is an officer of the army originally appointed when troops are on service abroad (and now in the [[United Kingdom]] as well) for the prompt repression of all offenses. He may at any time arrest and detain for trial persons subject to military law committing offences, and may also carry into execution any punishments to be inflicted in pursuance of a court martial (Army Act 1881, § 74). A [[provost sergeant]] is in charge of the [[garrison|garrison police]] or [[regimental police]]. The 'Provost' also refers to the [[military police]] in general. The British Army pronunciation is 'Prov-oh', though the U.S. Army pronunciation is 'Pro-vost' as written.

==Scotland==
Historically the provost was the chief magistrate or convener of a [[Scotland|Scottish]] [[burgh]] council, the equivalent of a [[mayor]] in other parts of the English-speaking world. Previous to the enactment of the [[Police burgh|Town Councils (Scotland) Act 1900]] various titles were used in different burghs, but the legislation standardised the name of the governing body as “the provost, magistrates, and councillors” of the burgh. After the re-organisation of [[local government in Scotland]] in 1975, the title of [[Lord Provost]] was reserved to [[Aberdeen]], [[Dundee]], [[Edinburgh]] and [[Glasgow]], while other district councils could choose the title to be used by the convener; in 1994 twenty-two councils had provosts.&lt;ref&gt;''Whitakers Concise Almanack 1995'', London, 1994. J. Whittaker &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|9780850212471}}; The district councils with provosts were Angus, Bearsden and Milngavie, Clydebank, Cumbernauld and Kilsyth, Dumbarton, Dunfermline, East Kilbride, Eastwood, Ettrick and Lauderdale, Falkirk, Gordon, Hamilton, Inverclyde, Inverness, Kyle and Carrick, Monklands, Motherwell, Nairn, Nithsdale, Perth and Kinross, Renfrew and Strathkelvin&lt;/ref&gt; Similar provisions were included in the [[Local Government etc. (Scotland) Act 1994]] which established unitary [[council areas]] in 1996. The area councils are allowed to adopt the title of provost (or any other) for the convener of the council, as are the [[area committee]]s of the council. Some [[community council]]s which include former burghs also use the style for their chairmen.

==In fiction==
In the [[Cadfael]] series of historical detective novels by [[Ellis Peters]], taking place at 12th Century [[Shrewsbury]], [[England]], an important role is played by the town's Provost - who in addition to this position is a prominent [[shoemaker]].

The Provost plays an important role in [[William Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Measure for Measure]]''. He is promoted at the end of the play.

'''''R v Stephens''''' (1866) LR 1 QB 702 is an [[English criminal law]], [[English land law|land law]] and [[UK public law]] case decided by the [[Queen's Bench]] that applied a [[strict liability]] standard to the violation of a [[crime|criminal]] [[statute]] prohibiting the dumping of refuse into a river. 

==Facts==
The defendant owned a quarry where refuse was dumped into a nearby river. The owner claimed he had no knowledge of the dumping and so should not be liable.

==Judgment==
The defendant quarry owner was held criminally [[liable]] even though he had no knowledge of the dumping.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie, R.J. et al.  ''Criminal Law, Second Edition.''  Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2004, p. 252&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''IISS Asia Security Summit: The Shangri-La Dialogue''' (SLD) is a "[[Track II diplomacy|Track One]]" inter-governmental security forum held annually by an independent think tank, the [[International Institute for Strategic Studies]] (IISS) which is attended by defense ministers, permanent heads of ministries and military chiefs of 28 Asia-Pacific states. The forum gets its name from the [[Shangri-La Hotel Singapore|Shangri-La Hotel]] in [[Singapore]] where it has been held since 2002.

The summit serves to cultivate a sense of community among the most important policymakers in the defence and security community in the region. Government delegations have made the best out of the meeting by holding bilateral meetings with other delegations on the sidelines of the conference. While primarily an inter-governmental meeting, the summit is also attended by legislators, academic experts, distinguished journalists and business delegates.

The participants have included [[Australia]], [[Brunei]], [[Burma]] (Myanmar), [[Cambodia]], [[Canada]], [[Chile]], [[China]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[India]], [[Indonesia]], [[Japan]], [[Laos]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mongolia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Pakistan]], [[Philippines]], [[Russia]], [[South Korea]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Singapore]], [[Sweden]], [[Thailand]], [[East Timor]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[Vietnam]].

==History==

===Background===
Prior to the first summit, Asia lacked a regional security framework like Europe. Earlier in 1996, US Defence Secretary [[William Perry]] and Thai Defence Minister [[Chavalit Yongchaiyudh]] each proposed separate initiatives to gather their counterparts in Asia but came to nothing.&lt;ref name="Btaylor" /&gt; The only Track One multilateral Asian security forum was the [[ASEAN Regional Forum]] (ARF), which was found to be unwieldy since it focused on confidence-building and at worst, little more than a talkshop.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiss.org/conferences/the-shangri-la-dialogue/press-coverage/press-coverage-2002/the-international-herald-tribune---asean/|title=IISS|website=www.iiss.org|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition, the ARF was led by foreign ministers, leaving defence diplomacy and security cooperation in the region somewhat in want for a mechanism for defence ministers to interact.

The Shangri-La Dialogue was conceived by the current IISS Director-General and Chief Executive Sir John Chipman in 2001 in response to the clear need for a forum where the Asia Pacific defence ministers could engage in dialogue aimed at building confidence and fostering practical security cooperation. During the 36th Munich Conference on Security Policy, Chipman 'noticed Asian officials receiving short shrift' and realised that 'Asia needed its own defence institution at which defence ministers met and spoke'.&lt;ref name="Btaylor"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shangri-La Dialogue and the Institutionalization of Defence Diplomacy in Asia |author=David Capie, Brendan Taylor |publisher=The Pacific Review Vol 23 No 3 |year=2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially the SLD was modelled after the [[Munich Conference on Security Policy]] but with greater ambition - to create a Track One organization that "defence ministers needed if they were to have any chance at all of meeting multilaterally in a transregional format".&lt;ref name="report5" /&gt; Invitations were essentially focused on the members of the ASEAN Regional Forum in order to serve as a true regional security institution. Singapore was chosen as the location for the initial conference and with the Shangri-La Hotel as the venue.&lt;ref name="report5" /&gt; Chipman approached Singapore President [[SR Nathan|S.R. Nathan]] in February 2001 to propose the idea and Nathan offered to provide [[Institute for Defence and Strategic Studies|IDSS]] support until the IISS could run the conference independently. The idea was brought forward to the Singapore Cabinet and was approved to be supported by the Ministry of Defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201106300202.html|title=The Asahi Shimbun|website=The Asahi Shimbun|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early dialogues===
Initiated in 2002, it was an "unofficial defence summit'" which allowed defence officials to meet "privately and in confidence, bilaterally and multilaterally, without the obligation to produce a formal statement or communique".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiss.org/conferences/the-shangri-la-dialogue/press-coverage/press-coverage-2002/taipei-times---asian-multilateralism/|title=IISS|website=www.iiss.org|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; About a dozen deputy ministers and ministerial representatives attended the inaugural summit (then known as the Asia Security Conference), including a US delegation led by US Deputy Defence Secretary [[Paul Wolfowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiss.org/conferences/the-shangri-la-dialogue/press-coverage/press-coverage-2002/the-straits-times---need-for-a-network/|title=IISS|website=www.iiss.org|accessdate=2 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iiss.org/conferences/the-shangri-la-dialogue/press-coverage/press-coverage-2002/taipei-times---asian-multilateralism/|title=Regional Security: Different Targets|author=Ralph A Cossa |publisher=Far Eastern Economic Review|date=2002-08-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first summit was organized in six plenary sessions lasting for one and a half days.

In 2003, the second summit expanded its invitation list to include chiefs of defence staff, and permanent or under secretaries of defence ministries. The agenda this year was organized around five plenary sessions supplemented by two simultaneous off-the-record 'break-out groups'.&lt;ref name="report5"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shangri-La Dialogue: The 5th Anniversary IISS Asia Security Conference |author=5th Dialogue report |publisher=The International Institute for Strategic Studies |year=2006 |location=p11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the invitation list was again further expanded to include participating countries' most senior intelligence and the police and national security officials of some countries. The number of break-out groups was increased to three. The IISS Asia office was opened this year, which allowed IISS to organize the summit completely independently.

In 2005, Pakistan was represented for the first time.

In 2006, the number of delegations had risen to 23 countries, with 17 being led by their respective defence ministers, and another 3 by deputy defence ministers or equivalent.

===Recent dialogues===

The 2007 iteration of the Shangri-La Dialogue was a landmark meeting as it attracted top-level participation from China. The Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army (with the status of Vice-Minister) Lieutenant-General [[Zhang Qinsheng]], led Beijing's delegation that year. Subsequently, in 2008, Vietnam and Myanmar elevated their representation to deputy minister level. Then in 2009, Vietnam was represented at full ministerial status with General [[Phung Quang Thanh]] leading its delegation.

In 2008, Laos was represented for the first time. Notably despite the natural disasters in their respective countries, Myanmar and China were both led by high-level officers, Deputy Minister of Defence, Major-General [[Aye Myint]] for Myanmar and Deputy Chief of the General Staff, Lieutenant-General [[Ma Xiaotian]] for China. The number of plenary sessions increased from five to six, while the number of break-out groups increased from three to six.&lt;ref name="report6"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Shangri-La Dialogue: The 7th IISS Asia Security Conference |author=7th Dialogue report |publisher=The International Institute for Strategic Studies |year=2008 |location=p5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] was the first head of government other than Singapore to address the summit's opening dinner. It is also known that Singapore and Australia signed a memorandum of agreement on the sidelines of the 2009 summit allowing Singapore's armed forces access to Australian training facilities for a further decade.

In the 2010 summit, The President of the Republic of Korea, [[Lee Myung-Bak]], was the first head of state to make the keynote speech at the summit. Other notable delegations include the Russian delegation, led by Deputy Prime Minister (and former defence minister) [[Sergei Ivanov]], and the Chilean delegation, led by Minister of Defence [[:es:Jaime Ravinet|Jaime Ravinet de la Fuente]]. Despite Japanese Prime Minister [[Yukio Hatoyama]]'s resignation the day before the SLD, his successor, Prime Minister [[Naoto Kan]], ensured that Minister of Defense [[Toshimi Kitazawa]] could attend and speak in a plenary session at the SLD. US Defence Secretary [[Robert Gates]] made his fourth SLD appearance and China's Lieutenant-General [[Ma Xiaotian]], Deputy Chief of the General Staff led a strong delegation from China's People's Liberation Army.

==Format==

===Plenary sessions===
Each summit typically is opened by a keynote address, historically given by a prominent Singaporean figure. Beginning in 2009, a head of state or head of government has delivered the keynote address. Australian Prime Minister [[Kevin Rudd]] in 2009, the President of the Republic of Korea [[Lee Myung-Bak]] in 2010, and Malaysian Prime Minister Dato' Sri  Najib Tun Razak in 2011 respectively delivered the opening speech. Five plenary sessions are held across the remaining two days of the summit where all participants are expected to be present. These on-record sessions are usually led by a minister only and the press are invited to report on them. By 2006, plenary speaking slots are allocated only to ministers  from a delegation.

===Break-out groups===
Introduced by the second summit in 2003, break-out groups are held concurrently with each other and allow more open discussion between participants on specific issues. These sessions also ensure that sufficient time is available during the summit for ministers to hold bilateral meetings. The break-out groups are strictly off-the-record so that officials could advance policy goals more freely. The break-out groups are usually chaired by a senior IISS staff member. By 2006, break-out group speaking slots are allocated only to ministers or senior officials from a delegation.&lt;ref name="report5" /&gt;

===Bilateral meetings===
While largely unpublicised, the Shangri-La Dialogues provide an annual venue for ministers, [[Chief of Defence|CHODs]], and top defence officials to network and expand their defence diplomacy in private, both bilaterally and multilaterally. Rooms are reserved for the meetings to take place during breaks. A government delegation might typically arrange 15-20 such encounters, lasting half an hour each, over the course of the summit. Singapore's defence minister usually also hosts multilateral private lunches.

===Non-Government delegates===
The summit has been consistently attended by a mix of 200-plus non-government delegates, which include politicians, academics, businessmen, think tank analysts, media and other NGO personnel. This has given the SLD an aspect of a [[Track two diplomacy|Track Two]] process, even though it is primarily a Track One event. Taylor notes that there are limited opportunities for interaction between non-government and government representatives.&lt;ref name="Btaylor" /&gt; The inclusion of non-government delegates is the result of dynamic efforts being made so that the SLD does not become an "exclusive club".&lt;ref name="Btaylor" /&gt;

==Impact==
Shangri-La has contributed to the enhancement of [[Defence Diplomacy|defence diplomacy]] by participating countries, in part by inspiring similar forums in other regions (e.g. the [[Halifax International Security Forum]]).

The 2010 Chinese Defence White paper explicitly mentioned senior Chinese participation in Shangri-La Dialogue since 2007 as one of their forums of participation in regional security cooperation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Wang Guanqun, Ed. |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english2010/china/2011-03/31/c_13806851_36.htm|title=China's National Defense in 2010 |date=2011-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IISS thinks that China's increased representation shows their eagerness to increase their engagement on a multilateral level and a recognition that the PLA wants to soften its image after a series of steps that were seen as too aggressive resulted in a downturn in relations with its neighbors.&lt;ref name="thecable"&gt;{{cite web|author=Josh Rogin and Philip Walker. |url=http://thecable.foreignpolicy.com/posts/2011/06/01/us_and_china_set_for_military_talks_in_singapore|title=U.S. and China set for military talks in Singapore|date=2011-06-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''simap.ch''' is the [[official gazette]] for [[government procurement]] publications in Switzerland. It is published online by an [[Voluntary association|association]] established jointly by the [[Swiss Confederation]] and the [[cantons of Switzerland]]. The name is an acronym for ''système d'information sur les marchés publics en Suisse'', "information system on government procurement in Switzerland".

Notices published on simap.ch include [[requests for tender]], [[requests for information]], and [[contract award]]s by Swiss federal, cantonal and municipal authorities and public enterprises as provided for by law. Most notices are also republished in the European Union's ''[[Tenders Electronic Daily]]'', based on agreements between Switzerland and the EU.

By 2019, simap.ch is set to be renewed based on [[e-procurement]] software by [[European Dynamics]]. In this form, simap.ch is intended to allow public authorities in Switzerland to conduct procurement procedures entirely on a digital basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neue Plattform für öffentliche Beschaffungen soll Firmen entlasten|url=https://www.cash.ch/news/politik/neue-plattform-fuer-oeffentliche-beschaffungen-soll-firmen-entlasten-1072559|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=[[Cash (newspaper)|Cash]]|date=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bund will neue Beschaffungsplattform|url=http://www.inside-it.ch/articles/46032|accessdate=31 May 2017|work=inside-it.ch|date=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on the Conservation of Southern South American Migratory Grassland Bird Species and Their Habitats''' is a Multilateral Environmental [[Memorandum of Understanding]] concluded under the auspices of the [[Bonn Convention|Convention on Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS)]], also known as the [[Bonn Convention]] and became effective on 26 August 2007. Under the “umbrella” of the CMS, the governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay agreed to work together towards better conservation of migratory species of grassland birds of Southern South America. The MoU covers five range States (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay), all of which have signed. 

== Development of MoU ==
[[File:Signing of South American Grassland Birds MoU.jpg|thumb|300px|Signing of the South American Grassland Birds MoU, August 2007]]
The Eight Meeting of the Conference of the Parties to CMS adopted a recommendation calling on range States, regardless of whether they were Parties to CMS, to develop a MoU to help conserve the endangered grassland bird species of South America and the habitats upon which they depend.&lt;ref&gt;Recommendation 8.26: http://www.cms.int/bodies/COP/cop8/documents/proceedings/pdf/eng/CP8Rec_8_26_GrasslandBirdSpecies_SouthAmerica_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of Argentina, Bolivia, Paraguay and Uruguay therefore agreed to work together towards better conservation of migratory species of grassland birds and developed the MoU text. Argentina, Paraguay and Uruguay signed the MoU on 26 August 2007. Brazil, although not a Party to CMS, signed the next day. Bolivia was the last of the range States to sign the MoU on 23 September 2009.

Signatories to the Southern South American Migratory Grassland Bird Species MoU:
* Argentina (26 August 2007)
* Brazil (27 August 2007)
* Paraguay (26 August 2007)
* Uruguay (26 August 2007)
* Bolivia (23 September 2009)

In addition, the CMS Secretariat also signed the MoU (26 August 2007).

== Aim of MoU ==
The grasslands of Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay in southern South America represent important habitat to numerous migratory bird species. These birds play vital roles in the ecosystem by dispersing seeds and controlling insect populations. According to the [[IUCN]] the global conservation status of many South American grassland species is alarming. The fragmentation, degradation and loss of grassland ecosystems by human activities are key threats to the species populations. These important habitats are being placed at risk by unsustainable agricultural activities, pollution from pesticides and other agrochemicals, conversion to pasture land for cattle, and the transformation of natural grassland into eucalyptus and pine plantations for paper production. The MoU aims to conserve the remaining populations by coordinated and concerted actions in the range States.

== Species covered by MoU ==
The MoU protects the following migratory grassland birds of southern South America:
* [[Eskimo curlew]] ''(Numenius borealis)''
* [[Strange-tailed tyrant]] ''(Alectrurus risora)''
* [[Cock-tailed tyrant]] ''(Alectrurus tricolor)''
* [[Chestnut seedeater]] ''(Sporophila cinnamomea)''
* [[Rufous-rumped seedeater]] ''(Sporophila hypochroma)''
* [[Marsh seedeater]] ''(Sporophila palustris)''
* Zelich's seedeater ''(Sporophila zelichi)''
* [[Saffron-cowled blackbird]] ''(Agelaius flavus)''
* [[Dark-throated seedeater]] ''(Sporophila ruficollis)''
* Dinelli’s doradito ''(Pseudocolopteryx dinellianus)''
* [[Bearded tachuri]]  ''(Polystictus pectoralis pectoralis)''

== Fundamental components ==
Concerned that the populations of several species of migratory birds inhabiting the grasslands of southern South America have been subject to a drastic reduction and fragmentation of their habitats and have a delicate state of conservation, the Signatories decide to work together to improve the conservation status of the species throughout their breeding and wintering ranges. To this end, they will:&lt;ref&gt;Text of the Southern South American Migratory Grassland Birds Memorandum of Understanding: http://www.cms.int/species/Grassland_birds/MoU_Grassland_birds_with_sigs_with_Bolivia_E.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
# Provide effective protection for the populations of migratory grassland birds and for the habitats upon which their survival depends
# Develop an Action Plan to protect the species and their habitats
# Assess the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan at regular meetings
# Provide the CMS Secretariat a regular report on the implementation of the MoU in their respective countries

The MoU came into effect following the third Signature (26 August 2007) and will remain in effect indefinitely subject to the right of any Signatory to terminate its participation by providing one year’s written notice to all other Signatories.

== Meetings ==
Meetings of Signatories are organized on a regular basis to review the conservation status of the species and the implementation of the MoU and Action Plan.

'''The First Meeting of Signatories''' took place in [[Asunción, Paraguay]], 15 December 2010, with funding and logistical support from Asociación Guyra Paraguay, the national Partner of [[BirdLife International]].&lt;ref&gt;Report First Meeting of Signatories to the Migratory Grassland Birds MoU:http://www.cms.int/species/Grassland_birds/grassland_birds_news.htm&lt;/ref&gt; During the meeting an Action Plan was adopted and annexed to the MoU. Furthermore, the meeting approved a list of priority activities as recommended by the Technical Meeting. At the meeting a joint offer by BirdLife International and Guyra Paraguay to provide coordination services for the MoU in the future, was accepted.

== Secretariat ==
The CMS Secretariat – located in [[Bonn, Germany]] – acts as the secretariat to the MoU. 

== Action Plan ==
The First Meeting of Signatories adopted an Action Plan which was added as an Annex to the MoU.&lt;ref&gt;Action Plan: http://www.cms.int/news/PRESS/nwPR2010/pressreleases/CMS_Grassland_Birds_South_America_clean.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Plan had been drafted at a workshop in Paraguay in September 2010 and finalized at a Technical Meeting immediately prior to the Meeting of the Signatories. The text of the MoU states that the Action Plan should include measures to promote coordination of conservation actions, international cooperation, improving the knowledge on these species, management, research, awareness and the exchange of information among the Signatories. The Action Plan focuses on the identification of new protected areas to create a network of habitats, in addition, it recommends actions to be taken outside of protected areas to help conserve habitat on private lands.

In [[international law]], a '''stateless''' person is someone who is "not considered as a national by any state under the operation of its law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, article 1(1)|url=http://www.unhcr.org/refworld/docid/415c3cfb4.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stateless persons are also [[refugee]]s. However, not all refugees are stateless, and many persons who are stateless have never crossed an international border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Human Rights and Citizenship: The Need for Better Data and What to Do about It|last = Hovy|first = Bela|publisher = MIT Press|year = 2011|isbn = 9780262015271|location = Cambridge, Massachusetts, United States|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=KhejoCZ7alEC&amp;pg=PA90|work = Children Without a State: A Global Human Rights Challenge|accessdate = 11 August 2014|editor-last = Bhabha|editor-first = Jacqueline|editor-link = Jacqueline Bhabha|page = 90|quote = People who reside in their country of birth, have never crossed a border, but have never had their birth registered by the state—the effectively stateless, in Jacqueline Bhabha's terminology—also resemble refugees in their relative rightlessness.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated over 10 million people worldwide are stateless. On 13 November, 2018, [[Filippo Grandi]], [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] said there are about 12 million stateless people in the world. &lt;ref&gt;[https://news.un.org/en/story/2018/11/1025561 ‘12 million’ stateless people globally, warns UNHCR chief in call to States for decisive action]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Causes ==

=== Conflict of law ===
Conflicting nationality laws are one of many causes of statelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Statelessness|url=http://www.fmreview.org/statelessness|work=Forced Migration Review|publisher=Refugee Studies Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationality is usually acquired through one of two modes, although many nations recognize both modes today: 
* ''[[Jus soli]]'' ("right of the soil") denotes a regime by which nationality is acquired through birth on the territory of the state. This is common in the [[Americas]]. 
* ''[[Jus sanguinis]]'' ("right of blood") is a regime by which nationality is acquired through descent, usually from a parent who is a national. Almost all states in Europe, Asia, Africa, and Oceania grant citizenship at birth based upon the principle of ''jus sanguinis''.

A person who does not have either parent eligible to pass citizenship by ''jus sanguinis'' can be stateless at birth if born in a state which does not recognize ''jus soli''. For instance, a child born outside [[Canada]] to two Canadian parents, who were also born outside Canada to Canadian parents, would not be a Canadian citizen, since ''jus sanguinis'' is only recognized for the first generation in Canada. If the child were born in [[India]] and neither parent had Indian citizenship, then the child would be stateless since India only confers citizenship to children born to at least one Indian parent.

=== By gender ===
Although many states allow the acquisition of nationality through parental descent irrespective of where the child is born, some do not allow female citizens to confer nationality to their children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks on Statelessness and Gender Discrimination|url=https://www.state.gov/g/176132.htm|publisher=US Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are 27 countries in the world that do not grant equal rights to women in passing on their nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Background Note on Gender Equality, Nationality Laws and Statelessness 2014|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/532075964.html|date=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can result in statelessness when the father is stateless, unknown, or otherwise unable to confer nationality. There have been recent changes in favor of gender neutrality in nationality laws, including reform processes in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]], and [[Senegal]] that may inform change elsewhere. For example, Algeria amended its [[Algerian nationality law|nationality code]] to repeal the limitations on mothers’ ability to confer nationality on their children, replacing them with an overarching provision granting Algerian nationality to all children born in or outside Algeria to an Algerian mother or father.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Good Practices Paper - Action 3: Removing Gender Discrimination from Nationality Laws|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/54f8377d4.html|date=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (CEDAW)|url=https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/cedaw/cedaw.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; prohibits sex-based discrimination in the conferral of nationality.

An important measure to prevent statelessness at birth provides nationality to children born in a territory who would otherwise be stateless. This norm is stipulated in the 1961 [[Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]];&lt;ref name="1961 Convention"&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/6_1_1961.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; appears in several regional human rights treaties, including the [[American Convention on Human Rights]], the [[European Convention on Nationality]], and the [[African Charter on the Rights and Welfare of the Child]]; and is implicit in the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child|United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child (CRC) |url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611182141/http://www2.ohchr.org/english/law/crc.htm |archivedate=2010-06-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Discrimination ===
In most large-scale statelessness situations, statelessness is a result of discrimination. Many states ([[Non-citizens (Latvia)|Latvia]] being a notable example) define their body of citizens based on [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]], leading to the exclusion of large groups. This violates international laws against discrimination. The [[International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination|United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination]] stated on 1 October 2014 that the "deprivation of citizenship on the basis of race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin is a breach of States’ obligations to ensure non-discriminatory enjoyment of the right to nationality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Nationality and Statelessness: Handbook for Parliamentarians N° 22|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/53d0a0974.html|date=July 2014|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== State succession ===
In some cases, statelessness is a consequence of [[state succession]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Observatory on Statelessness|url=http://www.nationalityforall.org/state-succession}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some people become stateless when their state of nationality ceases to exist, or when the territory on which they live comes under the control of another state. This was the case when the [[Soviet Union]] disintegrated, and also in the cases of [[Yugoslavia]] and [[Ethiopia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Southwick|first=Katherine|title=Ethiopia-Eritrea: statelessness and state succession|url=http://www.fmreview.org/sites/fmr/files/FMRdownloads/en/FMRpdfs/FMR32/15-17.pdf|work=Forced Migration Review|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Nationality and Statelessness: A Handbook for Parliamentarians|url=http://www.ipu.org/pdf/publications/nationality_en.pdf|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tekle|first=Amare|title=Eritrea: State succession and the effort to eliminate statelessness|url=http://africanarguments.org/2010/12/13/state-succession-and-the-effort-to-eliminate-statelessness-the-case-of-eritrea/|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Administrative obstacles ===
People may also become stateless as a result of administrative and practical problems, especially when they are from a group whose nationality is questioned. Individuals might be entitled to citizenship but unable to undertake the necessary procedural steps. They may be required to pay excessive fees for documentation proving nationality, to provide documentation that is not available to them, or to meet unrealistic deadlines; or they may face geographic or [[literacy]] barriers.

In disruptive conflict or post-conflict situations, many people find that difficulties in completing simple administrative procedures are exacerbated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=The State of the World's Refugees: In Search of Solidarity, 2012|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/5100fec32.html|date=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such obstacles may affect the ability of individuals to complete procedures such as birth registration, fundamental to the prevention of statelessness in children. Whilst birth registration alone does not confer citizenship on a child, the documentation of place of birth and parentage is instrumental in proving the link between an individual and a state for the acquisition of nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Birth registration and the right of everyone to recognition everywhere as a person before the law : Report of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/53ff324e4.html|date=17 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UNICEF|United Nations Children’s Fund]] (UNICEF) estimated in 2013 that 230 million children under the age of 5 have not been registered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNICEF|title=A Passport to Protection: A Guide to Birth Registration Programming|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/52b2e2bd4.pdf|date=December 2013|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Not holding proof of nationality—being "[[Undocumented immigrant|undocumented]]"—is not the same as being stateless, but the lack of identity documents such as a [[birth certificate]] can lead to statelessness. Many millions of people live their entire lives without documents, without their nationality ever being questioned.

Two factors are of particular importance: 
* whether the nationality in question was acquired automatically or through some form of registration
* whether the person has ever been denied documents on the basis that he or she is not a national. 
If nationality is acquired automatically, the person is a national regardless of documentation status (although in practice, the person may face problems accessing certain rights and services&amp;nbsp;because he or she is undocumented, not because he or she is stateless). If registration is required, then the person is not a national until that process has been completed.

As a practical matter, the longer a person is undocumented, the greater the likelihood that he or she will end up in a situation where no state recognizes him or her as a national.

=== Renunciation ===
In rare cases, individuals may become stateless upon renouncing their citizenship (e.g., "world citizen" [[Garry Davis]] and, from 1896 to 1901, [[Albert Einstein]], who, in January 1896, at the age of 16, was released from his [[Württemberg]] citizenship after, with his father's help, filing a petition to that effect; in February 1901 his application for Swiss citizenship was accepted&lt;ref&gt;Walter Isaacson, ''Einstein: His Life and Universe'' (New York: Simon and Schuster, 2007), pp. 29, 58, 569n.66, &amp; 572n.20.&lt;/ref&gt;). People who subscribe to [[Voluntaryist]], [[Agorist]], or some other philosophical, political, or religious beliefs may desire or seek statelessness. Many states do not allow citizens to renounce their nationality unless they acquire another. However, consular officials are unlikely to be familiar with the citizenship laws of all countries, so there may still be situations where renunciation leads to effective statelessness.

=== Non-state territories ===
A final cause of statelessness is non-state territories. As per the definition of a stateless person, only states can have nationals. As a result, people who are "citizens" of non-state territories are stateless. This includes, for instance, residents of occupied territories where statehood has ceased to exist or never emerged in the first place. The [[Palestinian territories]] are the most prominent example. Others are [[Western Sahara]] and [[Northern Cyprus]] (depending on the interpretation of what constitutes [[sovereign state|statehood]] and [[sovereignty]]). An example not involving military occupation is [[American Samoa]].

While statelessness has existed for several centuries, the international community has only been concerned with its eradication since the middle of the [[20th century]]. In 1954, the [[United Nations]] adopted the [[Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN General Assembly|title=Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons|url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1954/04/19540422%2000-23%20AM/Ch_V_2p.pdf|date=28 September 1954|publisher=United Nations Treaty Series|volume=360|page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provides a framework for the protection of the stateless. Seven years later, the United Nations adopted the [[Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN General Assembly|title=Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness|url=https://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/1975/12/19751213%2003-00%20AM/Ch_V_4p.pdf|date=30 August 1961|publisher=United Nations Treaty Series|volume=989|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a range of regional and international human rights treaties guarantee a right to nationality, with special protections for certain groups, including stateless persons.

States bound by the 1989 [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] are obligated to ensure that every child acquires a nationality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN General Assembly|title=Convention on the Rights of the Child|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6b38f0.html|date=20 November 1961|publisher=United Nations Treaty Series|volume=1577|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The convention requires states to implement this provision in particular where the child would otherwise be stateless, and in a manner that is in the [[best interests]] of the child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Interpreting the 1961 Statelessness Convention and Preventing Statelessness among Children|url=http://www.unhcr.org/4e847ecf9.html|accessdate=27 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of a person who might be stateless ultimately depends on the viewpoint of the state with respect to the individual or a group of people. In some cases, the state makes its view clear and explicit; in others, its viewpoint is harder to discern. In those cases, one may need to rely on ''[[prima facie]]'' evidence of the view of the state, which in turn may give rise to a presumption of statelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=De Jure Statelessness in the Real World: Applying the Prato Summary Conclusions|url=http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/articles_publications/publications/prato-20110302|publisher=Open Society Foundations}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Before World War II ===
The status of [[slaves]] and inhabitants of conquered territories in the [[Greco-Roman]] world of [[classical antiquity|antiquity]] is in some ways analogous to contemporary statelessness. In antiquity, "statelessness" affected captive and subject populations denied full citizenship, including those enslaved (e.g., conquered populations excluded from [[Roman citizenship]], such as the [[Gauls]] immediately following the [[Gallic Wars]], or the [[Israelites]] under [[Babylonian captivity]]).

Some characteristics of statelessness could be observed among [[Apostasy in Islam|apostates]] and [[slaves in Islamic society]] (the former shunned for rejecting their religious birth identity, the latter having been separated from that identity and subsumed into an [[underclass]]). Statelessness also used to characterize the [[Romani people]], whose traditional [[nomad]]ic lifestyles meant that they traveled across lands claimed by others.

The [[Nansen International Office for Refugees]] was an international organization of the [[League of Nations]] in charge of [[refugees]] from 1930 to 1939. It received the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1938. [[Nansen passports]], designed in 1922 by founder [[Fridtjof Nansen]], were internationally recognized [[identity cards]] issued to stateless [[refugees]]. In 1942, they were honored by governments in 52 countries.

Many [[German Jews|Jews]] became stateless before and during the [[Holocaust]], because the [[Nuremberg laws]] stripped them of their German citizenship.

=== After World War II ===
The [[United Nations]] (UN) was set up in 1945, immediately after the end of [[World War II]]. From its inception, the UN had to deal with the mass atrocities of the war, including the huge refugee populations across [[Europe]]. To address the nationality and legal status of these refugees, the [[United Nations Economic and Social Council]] (ECOSOC) requested that the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary-General]] carry out a study of statelessness in 1948.

In 1948, the [[Universal Declaration on Human Rights]] (UDHR) was adopted. It provided both a right to asylum (Article 14) and a right to nationality (Article 15). The declaration also expressly prohibited arbitrary deprivation of nationality, which had affected many of the wartime refugees.

In 1949, the [[International Law Commission]] put "Nationality, including statelessness", on its list of topics of international law provisionally selected for codification. In 1950, at the behest of ECOSOC, that item was given priority, and ECOSOC appointed an [[ad hoc]] Committee on Refugees and Stateless People to draft a convention. A treaty on refugees was prepared with a draft protocol addressing the status of stateless persons.

The [[Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees]] was adopted on 28 July 1951. As of January 2005, it had attracted the signatures of 145 state parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unhcr.org.uk/press/press_releases2005/pr25Jan05.htm UNHCR in the UK&amp;nbsp;– News and press] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050228062055/http://www.unhcr.org.uk/press/press_releases2005/pr25Jan05.htm |date=February 28, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[International Refugee Organization]]—the predecessor to the [[United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees]] (UNHCR)—was in the process of being dissolved, the convention was adopted without the protocol addressing statelessness.

The [[International Law Commission]], at its fifth session in 1953, produced both a Draft Convention on the Elimination of Future Statelessness and a Draft Convention on the Reduction of Future Statelessness. ECOSOC approved both drafts. In 1954, the UN adopted the [[Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]]. This convention provided a definition of a stateless person (which has since become part of [[customary international law]], according to the International Law Commission) and set out a number of rights that stateless persons should enjoy. The convention thus became the basis for an international protection regime for stateless persons. However, in order to ensure that the rights enumerated in the convention are protected, states need to be able to identify stateless individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Protecting the Rights of Stateless Persons: The 1954 Convention relating to the Status of Stateless Persons|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4cad88292.html|date=March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Statelessness Determination Procedures and the Status of Stateless Persons ("Geneva Conclusions")|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4d9022762.html|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven years later, in 1961—only one year after the 1954 convention entered into force—the UN adopted the [[Convention on the Reductions of Statelessness|Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness]].

In 2014, following a series of expert meetings, UNHCR issued a Handbook on Protection of Stateless Persons.&lt;ref name="UNHCR"&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Handbook on Protection of Stateless Persons|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/53b676aa4.html|date=30 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stateless refugees covered by the 1951 convention should be treated in accordance with international refugee laws. As of 1 September 2015, 86 states were party to the 1954 convention, up from 65 when UNHCR launched its conventions campaign in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN Treaty Collections|title=Status of Treaties, Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons|url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsII.aspx?&amp;src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=V~3&amp;chapter=5&amp;Temp=mtdsg2&amp;lang=en#3|date=1 September 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325151555/https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetailsII.aspx?&amp;src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=V~3&amp;chapter=5&amp;Temp=mtdsg2&amp;lang=en#3|archivedate=25 March 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Reiseausweis Staatenlose1.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Germany|German]] [[1954 Convention Travel Document]]]]

=== Statelessness since 1961 ===
On 13 December 1975, the 1961 Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness entered into force. It provides a number of standards regarding acquisition and loss of nationality, including automatic loss, renunciation, and deprivation of nationality.

In 1974, the [[General Assembly of the United Nations|UN General Assembly]] (UNGA) requested that UNHCR undertake the functions established by the Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness. While the convention had only 37 state parties on 1 January 2011, 33 states pledged to accede to it at a ministerial event organized by UNHCR in December 2011. As of 1 September 2015, the number of state parties had increased to 64.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UN Treaty Collections |title=Status of Treaties, Convention on the Reduction of Statelessness |url=https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=V-4&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en |date=1 September 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325153730/https://treaties.un.org/pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=V-4&amp;chapter=5&amp;lang=en |archivedate=25 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1994, the UNHCR Executive Committee (ExCom) and the UNGA asked UNHCR to broaden its activities concerning statelessness to include all states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=How UNHCR helps the stateless|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/49c3646c16a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Executive Committee Conclusions|url=http://www.unhcr.org/41b4607c4.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, UNHCR was asked by the UNGA to actively promote accessions to the 1954 and 1961 conventions, as well as to provide interested states with technical and advisory services pertaining to the preparation and implementation of nationality legislation.

An internal evaluation released in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Engstrom, Magnus and|first=Naoko, Obi|title=Evaluation of UNHCR's role and activities in relation to statelessness|url=http://www.unhcr.org/3b67d0fa7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that UNHCR had done little to exercise its mandate on statelessness. Only two individuals were tasked with overseeing work in that area at UNHCR headquarters, though some field officers had been trained to address the issue. The evaluation also noted that there was no dedicated budget line.

Concerned organisations such as the [[Open Society Justice Initiative]] and [[Refugees International]] have called for UNHCR to dedicate more human and financial resources to statelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice |title=Open Society Justice Initiative &amp;#124; Open Society Foundations (OSF) |publisher=Soros.org |date=2013-10-02 |accessdate=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, a statelessness unit (now a statelessness section) was established in [[Geneva]], and staffing has increased both in headquarters and in the field. As part of an overhaul of UNHCR’s budget structure in 2010, the budget dedicated to statelessness increased from approximately US$12 million in 2009 to $69.5 million in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Note on statelessness|url=http://www.unhcr.org/559643a19.html|date=3 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to regular staff in regional and country offices, UNHCR has regional statelessness officers in [[Dakar]], [[Senegal]], for [[West Africa]]; [[Nairobi]], [[Kenya]], for the [[Horn of Africa]]; [[Pretoria]], [[South Africa]], for [[Southern Africa]]; [[San José, Costa Rica|San José]], [[Costa Rica]], for the [[Americas]]; [[Bangkok]], [[Thailand]], for [[Asia-Pacific|Asia and the Pacific]]; [[Almaty]], [[Kazakhstan]], for [[Central Asia]]; [[Brussels]], [[Belgium]], for [[Europe]]; and [[Amman]], [[Jordan]], for the [[Middle East]] and [[North Africa]].

In 2004, ExCom instructed UNHCR to pay particular attention to situations of protracted statelessness and to explore, in cooperation with states, measures that would ameliorate and end these situations. In 2006, it provided UNHCR with more specific guidance on how to implement its mandate. The Conclusion on Identification, Prevention and Reduction of Statelessness and Protection of Stateless Persons requires UNHCR to work with governments, other UN agencies, and civil society to address statelessness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=EXCOM Conclusion on Identification, Prevention and Reduction of Statelessness and Protection of Stateless Persons|url=http://www.unhcr.org/453497302.html|date=6 October 2006|number=106(LVII)}}&lt;/ref&gt; UNHCR's activities are currently categorized as identification, prevention, reduction, and protection.

UNHCR has achieved some success with campaigns to prevent and reduce statelessness among peoples in the [[Crimea|Crimean peninsula]] ([[Armenians]], [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Germans]], and [[Greeks]]) who were deported ''en masse'' at the close of World War II. Another success has been the naturalization of [[Tajiks|Tajik]] refugees in [[Kyrgyzstan]], as well as campaigns that have enabled 300,000 [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamils]] to acquire [[Sri Lanka]]n citizenship. UNHCR also helped the [[Czech Republic]] reduce the large number of stateless persons created when it [[Dissolution of Czechoslovakia|separated]] from [[Slovakia]].

At the beginning of 2006, the UNHCR reported that it had records of 2.4 million stateless persons, and estimated that there were 11 million worldwide. By the end of 2014, UNHCR had identified close to 3.5 million stateless persons in 77 countries and estimated the total number worldwide to be more than 10 million.&lt;ref name=globaltrends&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title= UNHCR Global Trends 2014: World at War|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/558292924.html|date=18 June 2015|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNHCR does not report refugee populations in its statelessness statistics in order to avoid [[double counting (fallacy)|double counting]], which would affect the total number of "persons of concern". Stateless refugees are counted as refugees, not as stateless. For the same reason, Palestinian refugees under the mandate of the [[UNRWA|United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East]] (UNRWA) are not reported in the UNHCR statelessness table. Instead, they are referred to elsewhere in UNHCR's statistical reporting.

While the two UN conventions on statelessness constitute the primary international framework for the protection of stateless persons and the reduction of statelessness, there are also regional instruments of great importance. The 1997 [[European Convention on Nationality]], for example, has contributed to protecting the rights of stateless persons and provides standards for reducing statelessness in the [[Council of Europe]] region. That document emphasizes the need of every person to have a nationality, and seeks to clarify the rights and responsibilities of states in ensuring individual access to a nationality.

Today, some of the largest populations of stateless persons are found in  [[Bangladesh]], [[Bhutan]], [[Cambodia]], [[Côte d'Ivoire]], [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Dominican Republic]], [[India]], [[Kenya]], [[Latvia]], [[Estonia]], [[Malaysia]], [[Mauritania]], [[Myanmar]], [[Nepal]], [[Brunei]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Kuwait]], [[Qatar]], [[Bahrain]], [[Iraq]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], [[Algeria]] and [[Thailand]].

== Notable cases ==

=== Airports ===
Some stateless people have received widespread public attention in airports due to their status as [[Port of entry|ports of entry]].

One famous case is that of [[Mehran Karimi Nasseri]], an expelled Iranian who lived in [[Charles de Gaulle Airport]] in France for approximately 18 years after he was denied entry to the country. (The 1994 French film ''[[Tombés du ciel]]'' and the 2004 American film ''[[The Terminal]]'' are fictional stories inspired by his experiences.&lt;ref name="Berczeller"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/sep/06/features.features11 |title=The man who lost his past |date=2004-09-06 |last=Berczeller |first=Paul |accessdate=2008-08-01 |work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Another case is that of [[Zahra Kamalfar]], an Iranian who lived in [[Sheremetyevo International Airport]] near [[Moscow]] for many months before receiving refugee status in [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Emotional reunion for Iranian family at Vancouver airport | url = http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/story/2007/03/15/kamalfar-family.html | work = CBC News | date = 2007-03-15 | accessdate = 2012-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== During change of citizenship ===
Countries that restrict [[multiple nationality]] often require immigrants who apply for naturalisation to obtain official documentation from their countries of origin proving that they are no longer citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.taiwantoday.tw/ct.asp?xItem=95438&amp;CtNode=426|first=Steven|last=Crook|title=Citizenship reform is a win-win proposition|work=Taiwan Today|date=2010-05-03|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In others, including [[Taiwan]], the documentation must be provided prior to the granting of citizenship. During the period between the renunciation/cancellation of the prior citizenship and the granting of the new citizenship by naturalization, the applicant may be officially stateless. (In two cases in Taiwan, Pakistani immigrants applied for naturalization and renounced their Pakistani citizenship. In the interim, the decisions to permit their naturalization as citizens of Taiwan were reversed, leaving them stateless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2012/12/15/2003550192|author=Loa Iok-sin|title=Legislator to propose changes to naturalization laws|work=Taipei Times|date=2012-12-15|accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

=== Brunei ===
There are a large number of stateless permanent residents in [[Brunei]]. Most of these residents have lived on Bruneian soil for generations, but Bruneian nationality is governed by the policy of ''[[jus sanguinis]]''; the right to hold it comes from blood ties. The government of Brunei has made obtaining citizenship possible, albeit difficult, for stateless people who have inhabited Brunei for many generations. Requirements include rigorous tests in [[Ethnic Malays|Malay]] culture, customs, and [[Malay language|language]]. Stateless permanent residents of Brunei are given an [[Bruneian International Certificate of Identity|International Certificate of Identity]], which allows them to travel overseas. The majority of Brunei's Chinese and Indians are permanent residents.

Holders of International Certificates of Identity can enter [[Germany]] and [[Hungary]] visa-free for a maximum of 90 days within a 180-day period. In the case of Germany, in theory, in order for an individual to benefit from the visa exemption, the ICI must be issued under the terms of the [[1954 Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons]], and it must contain an authorization to return to Brunei with a sufficiently long period of validity.

Brunei is a signatory to the 1959 [[Declaration of the Rights of the Child]], which states that "the child shall be entitled from his birth to a name and a nationality", but it does not currently follow the guidelines of the convention. The [[List of Sultans of Brunei|Sultan of Brunei]] has announced changes that may expedite the process by which stateless persons with permanent residence status sit for citizenship exams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Rachel Thien and Bandar Seri Begawan |url=http://www.bt.com.bn/news-national/2011/01/26/citizenship-news-lifts-spirits-stateless-prs |title=Citizenship news lifts spirits of stateless PRs |work=Brunei Times |date= January 26, 2011 |publisher=Bt.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
An amendment to the [[Canadian Citizenship Act 1946|Canadian Citizenship Act]] (S.C. 2008, c. 14, previously Bill C-37) came into effect on 17 April 2009 and changed the rules for the acquisition of foreign-born Canadian [[citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;See the Executive summary of the [http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2009/2009-04-15/html/sor-dors108-eng.html REGULATIONS AMENDING THE CITIZENSHIP REGULATIONS, 1993 (SOR/2009-108)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002053218/http://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2009/2009-04-15/html/sor-dors108-eng.html |date=2013-10-02 }}. The Act to amend the Citizenship Act itself states (sec. 14): "The provisions of this Act, other than section 13, come into force on a day or days to be fixed by order of the Governor in Council, but no later than 365 days after the day on which this Act receives royal assent." [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/annualstatutes/2008_14/ Royal assent was given] on 17 April 2008. No Order in Council appears to have been made.&lt;/ref&gt; Individuals born outside [[Canada]] can now become Canadian citizens by descent only if at least one of their parents was either a [[native-born citizen]] or a [[naturalization|naturalised]] citizen of Canada.

The new law limits citizenship by descent to one generation born outside Canada. All individuals born within one generation of the native-born or naturalised citizen parent are automatically recognised as Canadian citizens, but second-generation descendants born abroad are no longer citizens of Canada at birth, and such individuals might be stateless if they have no claim to any other citizenship. Since the passage of Bill C-37, this situation has already occurred at least twice:
* Rachel Chandler was born in [[China]], to a [[Libya]]n-born father who is a Canadian citizen through the provision in the above paragraph and a mother who is a Chinese citizen. Because of the nationality laws of Canada and China, she was not eligible for citizenship in either country and was apparently born stateless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=c3a5560d-5170-4d4a-a318-a8675e759171 |title=Citizenship Act creates a 'stateless' child |publisher=''[[The Vancouver Sun]]'' |date=September 25, 2009 |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604120258/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/news/editorial/story.html?id=c3a5560d-5170-4d4a-a318-a8675e759171 |archivedate=June 4, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, because Chandler's paternal grandfather was born in [[Ireland]], she was [[Irish nationality law|entitled to Irish citizenship]] and now holds an Irish passport.&lt;ref name="Branham"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lostcanadians.org/forum/topics/ireland-saves-canadians |title=Rachel Chandler's status highlights a policy that could see thousands of stateless children born abroad to Canadians |first=Daphne |last=Branham |work=The Vancouver Sun |publisher=''LostCanadians.org'' |date=October 9, 2010 |accessdate=March 13, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324084319/http://www.lostcanadians.org/forum/topics/ireland-saves-canadians |archivedate=March 24, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Bill C-37, the term "native-born" is construed strictly: children born outside of Canada to Canadian government employees working abroad, including diplomats and [[Canadian Forces]] personnel, are considered foreign-born.&lt;ref name="Branham" /&gt;

The bill was intended to resolve the status of so-called "[[Lost Canadians]]"—people who considered themselves Canadians, with undeniable connections to the country, but who had either lost or never been granted citizenship because of the vagaries of the country's previous nationality law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Statelessness in the Canadian Context: An updated discussion paper|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4facb7a62.html|date=March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dominican Republic ===
There are an estimated 800,000 [[Haitians in the Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37018 |title=DOMINICAN REPUBLIC: Deport Thy (Darker-Skinned) Neighbour |accessdate=14 October 2008 |author=Diógenes Pina |publisher=Inter Press Service (IPS) |date=21 March 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312093852/http://www.ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=37018 |archivedate=12 March 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For much of its history, the Dominican Republic had a ''jus soli'' policy, meaning that all children born in the country, even to undocumented parents, were automatically given citizenship. This is a policy practiced by most countries in the [[Western Hemisphere]]. But in June 2013, the Dominican high court amended existing legislation to exclude from ''jus soli'' citizenship children born "in transit", such as the children of foreign diplomats and "those on their way to another country".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Haitians in the Dominican Republic in legal limbo|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/opinion/2015/03/haiti-dominican-republic-ease-tensions-150324130359613.html|website = www.aljazeera.com|accessdate = 2015-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, the law has been expanded to address the children of non-citizens, such as Haitian migrants who immigrated after 1929.

=== Estonia and Latvia ===
{{See also|Non-citizens (Latvia)}}

[[Estonia]] and [[Latvia]], two neighboring European countries, were occupied by [[Soviet Union]] since 1940. When their independence was restored in 1991, citizenship was automatically granted to individuals who had been Latvian citizens prior to 18 June 1940 or Estonian citizens prior to 16 June 1940, and their descendants.  Citizens of Soviet Union, who had moved to Estonia or Latvia while they were occupied Soviet Union did not receive citizenship automatically in 1991, and neither did their descendants.  They had to apply for naturalisation as immigrants, a process that included a knowledge test and a language test in [[Estonian language|Estonian]] or [[Latvian language|Latvian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/society/citizenship.html|title=Estonia — Estonia is a place for independent minds|website=estonia.ee|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827195243/http://estonia.eu/about-estonia/society/citizenship.html|archivedate=2010-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meis.ee/applying-for-citizenship-as-an-adult|title=Integration Foundation - Applying for citizenship as an adult|first=BestIT|last=OÜ|website=www.meis.ee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children born after Latvia re-established independence (21 August 1991) to parents who are both non-citizens are also entitled to citizenship at the request of at least one of the parents.

These criteria mainly excluded ethnic Russians. Some decided not to apply for Estonian or Latvian citizenship because Russia has a visa waiver for stateless persons living in Estonia and Latvia, while Estonian and Latvian citizens need to obtain a visa to enter Russia. These stateless persons can also travel freely within the [[Schengen area]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.workpermit.com/news/2007_01_02/eu/visa-free_travel_stateless_aliens.htm|title=Latvian &amp; Estonian "non-citizens:" visa-free travel for most of EU-27|date=2 January 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, about 12% of residents of Latvia, and 6% of residents of Estonia, are stateless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unhcr.org/pages/4e12db4a6.html|title=UNHCR - Document Not Found|first=United Nations High Commissioner for|last=Refugees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greece ===
Article 19 of the [[Greek nationality law|Greek Citizenship Code]] (Law 3370 of 1955) stated: "A person of non-Greek ethnic origin leaving Greece without the intention of returning may be declared as having lost Greek citizenship. This also applies to a person of non-Greek ethnic origin born and domiciled abroad. Minor children living abroad may be declared as having lost Greek citizenship if both their parents or the surviving parent have lost it as well." (The [[Ministry of the Interior (Greece)|Minister of the Interior]] decides such cases, with the concurring opinion of the Citizenship Council.).

Article 19 was abolished in 1998, but no provision was established for restoring citizenship to people who had lost it. Interior Minister Alekos Papadopoulos stated that, since the article's introduction in 1955, 60,000 Greeks had lost their citizenship because of it. Many of these people moved and adopted the nationality of another country. However, an estimated 300–1,000 people remain stateless in Greece (primarily minorities in [[Thrace]], some of whom never settled abroad) and other former Greek citizens are stateless outside the country (an estimated 1,400 in [[Turkey]] and an unknown number elsewhere).

Stateless individuals in Greece have had difficulty receiving social services like health care and education. Until December 1997, they were denied the protection of the 1954 U.N. Convention Relating to the Status of Stateless Persons, which Greece ratified in 1975. Then, as a result of pressure from [[Non-governmental organization|nongovernmental organizations]] and minority deputies, around 100 ethnic Turks made stateless under Article 19 received identity documents from Greek authorities in accordance with the 1954 U.N. Convention. In August 1998, [[Minister for Foreign Affairs (Greece)|Foreign Minister]] [[Theodoros Pangalos (politician)|Theodoros Pangalos]] stated that within a year, most or all stateless persons living in Greece would be offered Greek citizenship; this promise was repeated in subsequent months by Alternate and Deputy Foreign Ministers [[George Papandreou]] and [[Giannos Kranidiotis]]. However, the government took no steps to carry out this promise.

From the mid-1950s until 1998, the Greek government used Article 19 to discriminate not only against the Turkish ethnic minority in Western Thrace, but also against immigrants to Turkey itself. The dispute over [[Cyprus]] between Greece and Turkey further exacerbated the problem, and tens of thousands of Greek citizens lost their nationality arbitrarily, sometimes while they were simply visiting Turkey on holiday.

The law was repealed in 1998, but not retroactively (i.e., those who had been affected did not have their citizenship automatically restored). Human rights groups and the United Nations have since helped many to regain their citizenship, but not without long struggles. Many stateless residents of Greece have had their nationality restored, but others have been waiting for decades, unable to re-enter the country of their birth and sometimes separated from their families in Greece.

=== Hong Kong ===
{{Refimprove section|date=January 2015}}
[[Hong Kong]], as a [[Special administrative regions of China|special administrative region of China]], does not have its own citizenship laws. The [[right of abode in Hong Kong|right of abode]] is the status that allows unrestricted right to live and work in Hong Kong; persons with right of abode in Hong Kong are called [[Hong Kong residents|permanent residents]]. Most permanent residents of Chinese descent are Chinese citizens as provided by the [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese nationality law]]. Citizens of other countries who have obtained right of abode in Hong Kong remain the citizens of their respective countries, and enjoy all the rights accorded to permanent residents except for those restricted to permanent residents with Chinese citizenship, such as the right to a [[Hong Kong Special Administrative Region passport|HKSAR passport]] and the eligibility to be elected as the [[Chief Executive of Hong Kong|Chief Executive]].

When Hong Kong was [[Transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong|transferred]] from the United Kingdom to China on 1 July 1997, all [[British Dependent Territories citizens]] (BDTCs) connected to Hong Kong lost their [[British nationality law and Hong Kong|British nationality]], unless they had applied for the [[British National (Overseas)]] (BN(O)) status. Most BDTCs of Chinese descent became Chinese citizens. BDTCs who did not become Chinese citizens and did not apply for BN(O) status while holding no other citizenship became [[British Overseas citizen]]s (BOCs). As BN(O) and BOC statuses do not provide right of abode in the United Kingdom, BN(O)s and BOCs of non-Chinese descent who do not hold any other citizenship are ''de facto'' stateless. However, [[British nationality law]] allows BN(O)s and BOCs who are otherwise stateless to register for full British citizenship. In addition, the Chinese nationality law as applied in Hong Kong provides the option of naturalisation as a Chinese national.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.immd.gov.hk/eng/services/chinese_nationality/Application_for_Naturalization_as_a_Chinese_National.html|title=Application for Naturalisation as a Chinese National|publisher=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chinese citizens from the mainland who had migrated to Hong Kong on a [[One-way Permit]] lose their mainland [[hukou]] (household registration). They then must reside in Hong Kong for 7 years before gaining the right of abode in Hong Kong. Therefore, persons who had migrated out of the mainland but have not obtained Hong Kong [[permanent residency]], while technically not stateless, are unable to exercise rights and privileges associated with citizenship in either the mainland or Hong Kong.

Stateless permanent residents of Hong Kong and Chinese migrants without right of abode may apply for a [[Hong Kong Document of Identity for Visa Purposes]], which allows them to travel overseas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gov.hk/en/residents/immigration/traveldoc/hkdoci/eligibility.htm|title=Eligibility for HKSAR Document of Identity for Visa Purposes|publisher=The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region}}&lt;/ref&gt; This document (with few exceptions) requires the holder to apply for and receive a travel visa prior to departure from Hong Kong.

Children born to foreign domestic workers are not classified as citizens because Chinese nationality is determined by blood ties. Under the visa regulations governing foreign domestic workers, the government of Hong Kong may award an unconditional stay visa. Many of these children can obtain citizenship in their parents' country of birth. When they are put up for [[adoption]], however, citizenship applications can become challenging. In cases where both adoptive parents are Chinese nationals, the children will likely remain stateless. Applying for [[Nationality law of the People's Republic of China|Chinese citizenship]] by naturalisation is only possible for permanent residents of Hong Kong, and an unconditional stay visa does not grant this status.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

In 2013, the UN sought a third country to resettle her due to the lack of protections for [[LGBT]] people and refugees in Hong Kong. After almost one year, a UN declaration recognized her as a woman under international law, and she was sent to [[New Zealand]], where she received asylum.

=== South Asia ===
As of 2012, [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] were each holding several hundred prisoners from the other for violations like trespass or visa overstay, often with accusations of [[espionage]]. Some of these prisoners have been denied citizenship in both countries, leaving them stateless. In Pakistani law, if one leaves the country for more than seven years without any registration from a Pakistani embassy or foreign mission of any country, they will be losing Pakistani citizenship.

In 2012, the [[BBC]] reported on the case of Muhammad Idrees, who lived in Pakistan and had been held under Indian police control for approximately 13 years for overstaying his 15-day visa by 2–3 days after seeing his ill parents in 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Muhammad Idrees: Abandoned by India and Pakistan - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-20752541|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-21|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; He spent much of those 13 years in prison waiting for a hearing, sometimes homeless or living with volunteer families. Both states denied him citizenship.

The BBC linked these problems to the political atmosphere caused by the [[Kashmir conflict]]. The Indian [[People's Union for Civil Liberties]] told the BBC it had worked on hundreds of cases with similar features. It called Idrees' case a "violation of all human rights, national and international laws", adding, "Everybody has a right to a nation." The Indian [[Human Rights Law Network]] blamed "officials in the home department" and slow courts, and called the case a "miscarriage of justice, a shocking case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00z57wt |title= Your World: The Nowhere Man |author= Rupa Jha |date=October 21, 2012 |publisher= BBC |accessdate=October 20, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 100,000 [[Bhutanese refugees]] in Nepal, who have neither Bhutanese nor Nepalese citizenship.

=== Japan ===
When [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] lost control over Korea in 1945, those Koreans who remained in Japan received [[Chōsen-seki]], a designation of nationality that did not actually grant them [[Japanese nationality law|citizenship]]. Roughly half of these people later received [[South Korean citizenship]]. The other half were affiliated with [[North Korea]], which is [[Japan–North Korea relations|unrecognized by Japan]], and they are legally stateless. Practically speaking, they mostly hold [[North Korean citizenship]] (albeit meaningless in Japan, their country of residence) and may repatriate there, and under Japanese law, they are treated as foreign nationals and given the full privileges entitled to that class.

[[Palestinians in Lebanon]] and [[Palestinians in Syria|those in Syria]] are constitutionally denied citizenship, and are thus stateless.

Stateless persons in [[Kuwait]] are descendants of Arab nomads who have settled in Kuwait during the 1960s but were denied the right to citizenship for different reasons. The number of stateless Kuwaitis, who are locally known as [[Bedoon (ethnicity)|Bedoons]] -the [[Arabic]] for "without", ranges between 120,000 and 200,000,{{citation needed|date= July 2016}}

The first Bedoon demonstrations for nationality rights took place on February 18, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Without Citizenship: Statelessness, discrimination and repression in Kuwait|url=http://www.soros.org/initiatives/justice/articles_publications/publications/without-citizenship-20110509}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, Kuwaiti courts ruled that Bedoon could be issued birth, marriage and death certificates.&lt;ref name="Al-Watan-2"&gt;Saeed, Ebtessam (3 March 2011) [http://alwatandaily.kuwait.tt/ArticleDetails.aspx?Id=106209 "Bedouns plan to rally for Amir"] ''Al-Watan Daily Newspaper''; [https://www.webcitation.org/5wuwzQsCp?url=http://alwatandaily.kuwait.tt/ArticleDetails.aspx?Id%3D106209 archived by] [[WebCite]]&lt;/ref&gt; Before those rulings, Bedoons were impeded in education and employment by the lack of such documentation.&lt;ref&gt;Staff (6 October 2010) [http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20101007071659/Tough%20requirements%20of%20Bedoun%20students%20to%20be%20cancelled%3A%20MoE%20/ "Kuwait: Tough requirements of Bedoun students to be cancelled: MoE"] ''Zawya'' (Dubai, UAE), [https://www.webcitation.org/5wuxeeamU?url=http://www.zawya.com/story.cfm/sidZAWYA20101007071659/Tough%20requirements%20of%20Bedoun%20students%20to%20be%20cancelled:%20MoE%20/ archived by] WebCite&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kuwaiti government has given some stateless people conditional rights and has worked to improve their overall standard of living. The government has incorporated into Kuwaiti society those who can provide documentation verifying that their male descendants resided in Kuwait prior to 1967.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Many families cannot provide such documents because they were never issued by the government.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Thus, only a minority of stateless people in Kuwait have access to this status.

Stateless people in Kuwait are divided into five groups:
* Those who have not registered or cannot register, and therefore have no access to services 
* Those with green cards, who are allowed access to some basic services, as long as their eligibility is maintained in their government security files
* Holders of blue cards, who must re-register with the government every six months
* Holders of yellow cards, who must re-register every three months 
* Holders of red cards, who can be deported at any time based on government conditions that are attached to the card.
Conditional access for green card holders is provided only as long as the identification card belonging to the male head of household is current and has the green classification. It is common for cards not to be renewed. The International Coalition for the Rights of the Stateless announced that it would report the lack of renewals to the United Nations at the Periodic Review for Kuwait in 2015.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Of the four color classifications, only the green card is linked to the provision of services such as: 
* free medical treatment&lt;ref name="ri"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.al-monitor.com/pulse/originals/2013/03/kuwait-bedoon-naturalization.html|title = Is Kuwait Serious About Bedoon Naturalisation? - Al-Monitor: the Pulse of the Middle East|publisher = Al-Monitor|date = |accessdate = 2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Public funded charity education&lt;ref name="ri" /&gt; 
* birth, death, marriage and divorce certificates&lt;ref name="ri" /&gt; 
* inheritance and guardianship documentation&lt;ref name="ri" /&gt; 
* driver’s licenses (for which there are a number of hurdles)&lt;ref name="ri" /&gt; 
* basic supermarket supplies ([[subsidies]])&lt;ref name="ri" /&gt; 
* care for those with special needs and disabilities (not including specialist treatment).&lt;ref name="ri" /&gt; 
According to media reports,{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Kuwait does not prioritize stateless people for citizenship. Rather, priority is given to citizens of other countries and foreign spouses of important Kuwaitis, as well as foreigners who have performed a service for Kuwait. There is no public information regarding the number of stateless people who are granted Kuwaiti citizenship.

In 2013, ''BBC News'' reported that 4,000 "foreigners" would receive citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kuwait MPs pass law to naturalise 4,000 stateless Bidun - BBC News|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-21857431|website = BBC News|access-date = 2016-01-20|language = en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; (The number was higher than usual because in 2012, there was no such round of citizenship distribution.) But the government said that only a third of Bedoons were eligible for [[naturalisation]], and that the rest had destroyed documents identifying them as citizens of other nations.

Local news sources in Kuwait have cited parliamentarians in reporting that the government wants to deport Bedoons.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}} Some humanitarian agencies have reported that posters advertising fraudulent passport services were placed in government offices, and that workers advised stateless people that they could not register at the office, but should take down the details on the poster. A Refugees International/Open Society Foundations report on 13 May 2011 stated, "After years of encouraging—sometimes coercing—Bidoon to sign affidavits to the effect that they were nationals of other countries, government officials became involved in an illicit trade of forged foreign passports."&lt;ref&gt;Refugees International and Open Society Foundations. ''[http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4dd205b62.pdf Without Citizenship: Statelessness, Discrimination and Repression in Kuwait].'' 13 May 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This strategy enabled hundreds, if not thousands, of stateless families to be removed from government records and designated "other nationals", allowing the government to deny any obligation to provide services and preventing those families from ever receiving citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.kuwaittimes.net/600-bedoon-children-denied-admission-local-schools-kids-without-birth-certificates-crammed-makeshift-classrooms/|title=600 bedoon children denied admission to local schools - Kids without birth certificates crammed in makeshift classrooms - Kuwait Times|work=Kuwait Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kuwait also expelled some 400,000 [[Palestinians]] during the [[Iraq War]].

On 17 April 2014, a parliamentarian, Nabil al Fadhl, argued that stateless persons accused of security offences should be sent to camps in the desert.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kuwaiti MP wants protesting stateless sent to desert camp|url = http://gulfnews.com/news/gulf/kuwait/kuwaiti-mp-wants-protesting-stateless-sent-to-desert-camp-1.1320968|website = gulfnews.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one author who provided information for the United Nations' Universal Periodic Review of Kuwait was blacklisted and accused of such security offences. Since then, parliamentarians who have spoken in opposition to the Kuwaiti government have been rendered stateless.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Kuwait urged to stop stripping citizenship|url = http://www.aljazeera.com/news/middleeast/2014/10/kuwait-urged-stop-stripping-citizenship-20141019144335134722.html|website = www.aljazeera.com|access-date = 2016-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Restrictions on employment and education mean that many stateless people are never employed. Some men who sell fruit in the street are made to pack up their things or risk arrest for security offences. The streets of the segregated communities of Taima and Sulabiya are deserted during the daytime because whole families are effectively confined to their homes.{{Citation needed|date = January 2016}}

There are no statistics available on what portion of the stateless population has access to government-funded services. Nor is there up-to-date information on the numbers of registered and unregistered stateless people in Kuwait; only an approximate figure of "those eligible to receive citizenship"—i.e., people who were issued green cards in 2012—has been published. The number of registered stateless people has likely fallen because many identity cards have not been renewed, as reported to the United Nations' International Coalition for the Rights of the Stateless in advance of the 15th Periodic Review of Kuwait.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group29q8.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/UPR-13-6-2014-en-Final1.pdf |title=UPR Report to the Human Rights of state of Kuwait |date=January–February 2015 |publisher=International Coalition for the Rights of the Stateless|dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230001810/http://www.group29q8.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/UPR-13-6-2014-en-Final1.pdf |archive-date=2016-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of [[Qatar]]'s [[Bidoon (stateless)|Bedoon]] are stateless tribesmen from the [[Ghufrani]] tribe. In 2005, Qatar stripped the citizenship of over 5,000 members of the tribe.

==== Palestine ====
{{See also|History of Palestinian nationality}}
Even though Palestinians living in the [[West Bank]] and the [[Gaza Strip]] were issued [[Palestinian passport]]s under the [[Oslo Accords]], many countries (such as [[Germany]]) do not recognize their citizenship. As a matter of international law, only states can have nationals (meaning citizens), and the citizenship status of Palestinians therefore depends on whether or not [[State of Palestine|Palestine]] is a state. Some countries [[International recognition of the State of Palestine|recognize Palestinian statehood]], but others do not.

After [[Israel]] annexed [[East Jerusalem]] following the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, Palestinians living there received, along with Israeli [[permanent residency]] status, the right to apply for citizenship. Shortly after the offer was made, it was rejected by Arab leaders. Almost all Jerusalem Palestinians have shied away from citizenship for ideological reasons. Between 1967 and 2007, only 12,000 of the 250,000 Palestinians living in Jerusalem applied for Israeli citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Ronny |last=Shaked |url=http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3468672,00.html|title=Thousands of Palestinians apply for Israeli citizenship |publisher= Ynetnews.com |date=November 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/israel-reports-jump-in-jerusalem-arabs-seeking-israeli-citizenship-1.232665 |title=Israel reports jump in Jerusalem Arabs seeking Israeli citizenship |work= A.P. |date=November 7, 2007 |publisher=Haaretz.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2007, more have applied, although the majority still reject it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/National-News/More-e-Jerusalem-Palestinians-seeking-citizenship|title=More e.

Many descendants of Palestinian refugees live permanently in countries of which they would be expected to be citizens, but they are not citizens because that country adheres to the policy of the [[Arab League]] in denying citizenship to Palestinians.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}}

=== Puerto Rico ===
{{Main|Juan Mari Brás}}
In 1994, [[Juan Mari Brás]], a [[Puerto Rican people|Puerto Rican]] lawyer and political historian, renounced his American citizenship before a consular agent in the United States Embassy of [[Venezuela]]. In December 1995, his loss of nationality was confirmed by the [[United States Department of State|US Department of State]]. That same month, he requested that the Puerto Rico State Department furnish him with proof of his Puerto Rican citizenship. The request involved more than just a bureaucratic formality; Mari Brás tested the self-determination of [[Puerto Rico]] by trying to become the first Puerto Rican citizen who was not also an American citizen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/1997/jan/first.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020902141929/http://www.digitas.harvard.edu/~perspy/old/issues/1997/jan/first.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2002-09-02|title=World's Only Puerto Rican|publisher=Digitas.harvard.edu|accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mari Brás claimed that as a Puerto Rican national born and raised in Puerto Rico, he was clearly a Puerto Rican citizen and therefore had every right to continue to reside, work, and, most importantly, vote in Puerto Rico. The State Department responded promptly, claiming that Puerto Rican citizenship did not exist independent of American citizenship, and in 1998, the department rescinded its recognition of his renunciation of citizenship. The official response to Mari Brás stated that Puerto Rican citizenship existed only as an equivalent to [[Residency (domicile)|residency]]. However, the Puerto Rico State Department issues certificates of citizenship to people born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican parent, including some people who may have never resided in the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pr.gov/attachments/pdf/023%20-|title=solicitud de certificado de ciudadanía |accessdate= 2016-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Different classes in [[British nationality law]] have led to situations in which people were considered British subjects but not nationals, or in which people held a [[British passport]] without [[Right of Abode (United Kingdom)|right of abode]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. Examples include so-called [[British Protected Person|British protected person]]s, who are not considered British nationals. British nationals (irrespective of the class of nationality) who reside abroad but are not entitled to protection by the British government are ''de facto'' stateless.

Many situations that put people at risk of statelessness were resolved after 30 April 2003, when the [[Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002|Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act of 2002]] came into force. As a result of this act, the United Kingdom gave most people with residual British nationality but no other citizenship the right to register as full British citizens. However, there are still some people who have not been able or willing to register as citizens.{{Specify|date=November 2012}} Following the publication of a joint UNHCR-Asylum Aid report in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Mapping Statelessness in The United Kingdom|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4ecb6a192.html|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the UK adopted a statelessness determination procedure in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=UK's new determination procedure to end legal limbo for stateless|url=http://www.unhcr.org/5163f0ba9.html|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] of the US Constitution granted citizenship to African American slaves.

General Assembly Resolutions 3274 (XXIV) and 31/36 designated UNHCR as the body responsible for examining the cases of persons who claimed the benefit of the 1961 convention and assisting such persons in presenting their claims to the appropriate national authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=UNHCR Action to Address Statelessness: A Strategy Note|url=http://www.refworld.org/docid/4b9e0c3d2.html|date=March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] conferred upon UNHCR a global mandate for the identification, prevention, and reduction of statelessness and for the international protection of stateless persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNGA|title=UNGA resolutions A/RES49/169|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/49/a49r169.htm|date=23 December 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNGA|title=UNGA resolutions A/RES/50/152|url=https://www.un.org/documents/ga/res/50/ares50-152.htm|date=21 December 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; This mandate has continued to evolve as the General Assembly has endorsed the conclusions of the UNHCR Executive Committee, notably Executive Committee Conclusion No. 106 of 2006 on the "identification, prevention, and reduction of statelessness and protection of stateless persons".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNGA|title=UNGA resolutions A/RES/61/137|url=https://www.un.org/en/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/61/137&amp;Lang=E|date=19 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Global campaign to end statelessness ====
The UNHCR launched a global campaign on 4 November 2014 to end statelessness within 10 years.

As part of the campaign, it published a special report providing a comprehensive overview of statelessness and delving into the human impact of the phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Special report: Ending Statelessness within 10 years|url=http://www.unhcr.org/546217229.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also published an open letter addressed to states, urging them to take action. In addition to UNHCR High Commissioner [[António Guterres]], the letter was signed by [[Angelina Jolie]], a UNHCR special envoy; [[Surin Pitsuwan]], former secretary-general of ASEAN; [[Shirin Ebadi]], a [[Nobel Peace Prize]] laureate; Archbishop Emeritus [[Desmond Tutu]]; [[Barbara Hendricks]], a UNHCR honorary lifetime goodwill ambassador; [[Madeleine Albright]], former US secretary of state; [[Carla Del Ponte]], former chief prosecutor of two UN international criminal tribunals; [[Zeid Ra’ad Al Hussein]] and [[Louise Arbour]], former UN high commissioners for human rights; and Dame [[Rosalyn Higgins]], former president of the [[International Court of Justice]], among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=UNHCR's Open Letter to End Statelessness|url=http://ibelong.unhcr.org/en/join/index.do}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a "global action plan to end statelessness" was launched following consultation with states, civil society, and international organisations. It sets out a guiding framework of 10 actions that need to be taken to end statelessness by 2024.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=UNHCR|title=Global Action Plan to End Statelessness: 2014-2024|url=http://ibelong.unhcr.org/cms-web/upl/entities/story/FINAL%20Global%20Action%20Plan%20-%20PDF%20Version.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan includes actions to:
* resolve existing situations of statelessness;
* prevent new cases of statelessness from emerging; and
* better identify and protect stateless persons.

The 10 actions are:
* Action 1: Resolve existing major situations of statelessness.
* Action 2: Ensure that no child is born stateless.
* Action 3: Remove gender discrimination from nationality laws.
* Action 4: Prevent denial, loss, or deprivation of nationality on discriminatory grounds.
* Action 5: Prevent statelessness in cases of state succession.
* Action 6: Grant protection status to stateless migrants and facilitate their naturalisation.
* Action 7: Ensure birth registration for the prevention of statelessness.
* Action 8: Issue nationality documentation to those entitled to it.
* Action 9: Accede to the UN statelessness conventions.
* Action 10: Improve quantitative and qualitative data on stateless populations.

=== International Stateless Persons Organisation ===
In March 2012, the International Stateless Persons Organisation (ISPO), an [[international non-governmental organization]], was founded by Dr. Fernando Macolor Cruz, a tribal prince and instructor of history and political science at [[Palawan State University]] in [[Philippines|the Philippines]]. It aims to provide institutional representation to stateless persons throughout the world through a network of volunteer human rights law practitioners who act as country representatives.

=== Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion ===
The Institute on Statelessness and Inclusion is an independent non-profit organisation dedicated to leading an integrated, interdisciplinary response to statelessness. It works on research, analysis, empowerment, advocacy, and awareness globally. It also maintains an online forum on statelessness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.institutesi.org www.institutesi.org&lt;/ref&gt;

=== European Network on Statelessness ===
The [[European Network on Statelessness]], a civil society alliance, was set up to address the problem of 600,000 stateless persons in Europe and to act as a coordinating body and expert resource for organisations across Europe that work with or come into contact with stateless persons.

'''The Burke Group'''&lt;ref&gt;This should not be confused with the Canadian [[temporary worker]] and human resources recruitment agency by the same name, est. 1979. For the Canadian firm, see The Burke Group's [http://www.theburkegroup.com/ website].&lt;/ref&gt; is a U.S.-based international [[management consulting]] firm established in 1982 with headquarters in Los Angeles.&lt;ref name="TBGweb"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Burke Group|url=http://www.theburkegroup.us.com/|accessdate=4 Jan 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burke Group describes itself as an "international leader" in guiding management during union recognition campaigns.&lt;ref name=TBGweb /&gt; It provides commercial services to private and public employers. Services are also offered toward business development and leadership training. Critics of The Burke Group call the firm's practices professional [[union busting]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/5547ad92-d8d5-11dc-8b22-0000779fd2ac.html?nclick_check=1|title=TUC acts to thwart US ‘union busters’|last=Taylor|first=Andrew|date=2008-02-12|work=Financial Times|accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] and President is David J. Burke.

==Business==
The Burke Group Labor assists employers in responding to automatic recognition and ballot campaigns.  According to its U.S. website, employees considering a [[trade union]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Employees want and deserve to hear both pro employer and pro union arguments in order to make an informed choice before voting in a union election. A [[union organizer]] is experienced at running a union membership campaign whereas employers have little if any experience on how to respond to them when this activity presents itself. Once union activity becomes apparent, employers generally seek TBG and/or legal counsel in order to be better able to respond accurately and lawfully to employees."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.tbglabor.com/faq.aspx |title=TBG Labor's FAQ on union avoidance |access-date=2009-03-07 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090804081408/http://www.tbglabor.com/faq.aspx#faq3/ |archive-date=2009-08-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although their business has reportedly been international in scope since its inception, their services increased in the EU "after the [[Employee Relations Act 1999]] (ERA 1999)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.eurofound.europa.eu/eiro/2000/07/feature/uk0007183f.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1999/26/contents&lt;/ref&gt; was established in June 2000 and triggered new procedures related to trade union recognition and ballot elections".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theburkegroup.eu.com/services.aspx?cid=11#19/TBG-EU Website-Trade Union Recognition Campaigns retrieved 4/27/2013]&lt;/ref&gt;  UK employers may seek the services of labor relations consultants such as The Burke Group and/or legal counsel to assist them thru the new law's complexities regarding automatic recognition or subsequent ballot elections.  "Human Rights Watch does not take the position that employer silence is required under international standards. Rather, non-interference is required by international standards."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.hrw.org[Human Rights Watch:  Letter to member of the Board of Management, Human Rights Watch, July 29, 2010 (copy on file with Human Rights Watch)]&lt;/ref&gt; As stated by Dr. John Logan:  "Britain has a “hybrid” system of union recognition: employers can recognize the union without a demonstration of majority support, or, if the employers refuse voluntary recognition, the Central Arbitration Committee can recognize the union on the basis of documentary evidence of union membership or by holding a ballot election."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lera.uiuc.edu/pubs/perspectives/onlinecompanion/Spring2009Vol10/Logan.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120805113538/http://www.lera.uiuc.edu/pubs/perspectives/onlinecompanion/Spring2009Vol10/Logan.html |archivedate=2012-08-05 |df= }} Union Recognition and Collective Bargaining: How Does the United States Compare With Other Democracies?

When direct communications known as third party persuading are requested, The Burke Group recommends&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tbglabor.com/services.aspx?cid=8&lt;/ref&gt; its U.S. clients work with ''Labor Information Services,'',&lt;ref name="LIS"&gt;{{cite web|title=Labor Information Services|url=http://www.laborinformationservices.com/|accessdate=4 Jan 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where David J Burke is also CEO.  This service&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.laborinformationservices.com/ LIS website]&lt;/ref&gt; provides workers a chance to talk "directly" with professional consultants during organizing campaigns which allows questions and answers from sources other than professional union organizers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/union/index.cfm?mins=267&amp;minors=27&amp;majorsubjectid=14/TUC Organizing Academy in UK]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aflcio.org/aboutus/oi/indspecific.cfm/%20AFLCIO%20Training%20Institute{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlc.edu/educational-programs/union-skills-classes/National Labor Institute] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720013822/http://www.nlc.edu/educational-programs/union-skills-classes/National |date=2011-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   "Direct communications with employees during union activity must be conducted in strict accordance with the definitions and guidelines provided within the Landrum-Griffin Act known as the [[Labor Management Reporting and Disclosure Act]] passed by the U.S. Congress in 1959. It requires detailed reporting of all monies paid for third party activities be provided via Form LM10 which is later posted for public record."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbglabor.com/services.aspx?cid=8#36/TBG website: Services: Direct Communications]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to their webpage, Labor Information Services is necessary because "the increase of non English speaking workers throughout U.S. industries has made communications (third party persuading) to a company's workforce a major challenge. The supervisors and managers at most companies are not bi-lingual, they do not know the law (National Labor Relations Act) nor can they be expected to answer employee questions in the short time frame of a union organizing campaign." Labor Information Services consultants are fluent in [[English language|English]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]], and a number of [[varieties of Chinese]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laborinformationservices.com/#3&lt;/ref&gt;

==AFL-CIO and TUC Agreement on anti-union activities of U.S. firms==
A report released in 2008 called "US Union Avoidance Consultants: A Threat to the Rights of British Workers"  commissioned by the [[Trades Union Congress]] (UK) to coincide with their joint announcement with the [[AFL-CIO]] (USA) of their campaign to thwart employer efforts which they claimed to "demonise trade unions and scare employees from joining up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuc.org.uk/union/tuc-14301-f0.cfm/Union Busters not welcome in the UK, see par. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/02/22/afl-cio-uk-unions-join-forces-against-union-busters/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081201000417/http://blog.aflcio.org/2008/02/22/afl-cio-uk-unions-join-forces-against-union-busters/ |archivedate=2008-12-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was designed to demonise companies which employ consultancies during recognition campaigns and ballot elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/protocolagreement.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120229224010/http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/protocolagreement.pdf |archivedate=2012-02-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The report examined tactics allegedly used by U.S. consultants and law firms, including detailed descriptions of Burke Group and clients in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/loganreport.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-02-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524160721/http://www.tuc.org.uk/extras/loganreport.pdf |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response, a Burke Group press release noted, the "report was biased and misleading based on subjective partisan research for which no request has ever been made to TBG nor its clients to review the veracity of the statements/conclusions contained therein before going to print."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2794237/Union-recognition-dispute-ruling-altered-after-consultants-complain.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Union-recognition dispute ruling altered after consultants complain | first=Richard | last=Tyler | date=2008-08-04 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tbg724pr"&gt;.{{cite web|url=http://www.theburkegroup.eu.com/news.aspx?newsID=125|title=CAC Amends Its Judgement About The Burke Group|last=The Burke Group|date=24 July 2008|accessdate=2011-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cable and Wireless Case Study==
In May 2007, the Communication Workers Union in the UK petitioned Cable and Wireless for "automatic recognition" of their Field Service team by filing form 1A which defines and describes the potential unit to the Central Arbitration Committee.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cac.gov.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;  After review, the Central Arbitration Committee sanctioned the unit.  However Cable and Wireless Worldwide decided to challenge the decision due to the relatively small size of the unit and concerns about potential fragmentation.&lt;ref&gt;https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200910/jtselect/jtrights/5/5we75.htm/Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, reps employed by the Communication Workers Union were assigned at Cable and Wireless to provide guidance to employees regarding joining their union,.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cwu.org/52991/cable-amp-wireless.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130414141229/http://www.cwu.org/52991/cable-amp-wireless.html |archivedate=2013-04-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cable and Wireless also employed reps to provide guidance to Cable and Wireless management.  But according to an article in The Guardian, the Communication Workers Union expressed "shock" saying that such hiring "can only lead to an atmosphere of bitterness and resentment."&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;"CWU attacks Cable &amp; Wireless for hiring US 'union-busters'", The Guardian, http://www.guardian.co.uk/business/2007/aug/18/7 retrieved 6/15/2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2008, after a review of the “appropriate bargaining unit”, the Central Arbitration Committee ordered a workforce ballot election process (as opposed to automatic recognition) as the best way to decide the most appropriate form of representation.  The subsequent ballot election resulted in a 92% turnout of the Cable and Wireless Field Services team where 77% voted against the Communication Worker’s Union as their representative for collective bargaining.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Vxv4mOkheooC&amp;pg=PA328&amp;lpg=PA328&amp;dq=cable+and+wireless+and+CWU+evidence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=lv8GyAtuCh&amp;sig=l6-JrzCWNrDFDXTPPg4jqKZFlAU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cxMPUf27MIHViwKkwYCADw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=cable%20and%20wireless%20and%20CWU%20evidence&amp;f=false/Any of Our Business?:  Human Rights and the UK Private Sector, Volume 2, Joint Committee on Human Rights: Evidence, Ev P 328]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, to dispute the outcome of the ballot election, the Communication Workers Union filed a complaint to the Central Arbitration Committee and The Joint Committee on Human Rights.  Annotated from evidence presented at the hearing: &lt;blockquote&gt; “The Burke Group (TBG) was engaged by Cable and Wireless to advise them on the statutory recognition process because it was complex and unfamiliar to Cable and Wireless.  TBG helped Cable and Wireless to implement a 'fact-based' approach to the ballot process which enabled managers to inform their teams about the union recognition process and what it would mean for them.  The Burke Group did not engage directly with employees in the bargaining unit, and they supported the ballot process.  Both Cable and Wireless and the Communication Workers Union had equal access to employees and colleagues during the 20 day ballot process.”&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/jt200910/jtselect/jtrights/5/5we75.htm/Publications Parliament UK],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''[[Trust law]]''' is not part of most '''[[Civil law (legal system)|civil law jurisdictions]]''', but is a common figure in most [[common law]] system (and thus in most [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]] jurisdictions). Trust law enters civilian jurisdictions through [[Conflict of laws|conflict of law]] arrangements recognizing it as a matter of [[private international law]] and has been implemented in the [[civil code]] of certain countries such as [[Liechtenstein]] and [[Curaçao]].

==Conflict of laws==
Sometimes, in a civil law jurisdiction, a foreign trust is involved. This recognition often involves "translating" the trust's characteristics into legal concepts that do exist within the civil law country. With the accession of the United Kingdom to the European Community, the trust entered [[Community Law]]; the law of the member state where the trust is constituted (the ''situs'') is designated as the applicable law (the law that must be followed) in member states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|language=Dutch|url=http://www.verenigingvoorburgerlijkrecht.nl/pdf_files/preadviezen/1994%20Boeschoten_Vriesendorp_Trust.pdf|accessdate=14 September 2012|author=C.D. van Boeschoten|work=vereniging voor burgerlijk recht|title=het Haags trustverdrag in Nederlands persectief}}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain trusts must be recognized by parties to the [[Hague Trust Convention]] (amongst which the civil law countries Italy, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, the Netherlands and Switzerland) if they are following certain requirements: the trust must be an [[express trust]] reduced to writing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hcch.net/index_en.php?act=conventions.status&amp;cid=59|title=Status Table: 30: Convention of 1 July 1985 on the Law Applicable to Trusts and on their Recognition|accessdate=14 September 2012|work=[[Hague Conference on Private International Law]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Curaçao,Sint Maarten and Liechtenstein==
The [[Curaçao trust]] and [[Sint Maarten trust]] exist since 1 January 2012 and 1 April 2014 respectively. They enable creation of trusts in the jurisdiction of Curaçao/Sint Maarten, when constituted by [[Civil law notary|notarial]] [[Act (document)|instrument]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cifa-curacao.com/pdfdocuments/WPNR%202012-6926%20De%20Boer.pdf|title=De Curaçaose trust in de partijk|language=Dutch|author=M.

The Liechtenstein trust requires a written agreement and registration on a trusts registry, which will not be publicly available if it is registered within 12 months. Later registrations require the registration in public record of the trustee's name, and certain details of the trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.envisage.ch/other-services/company-trust-amp-foundation-formation/liechtenstein-trusts/|title=Liechtenstein trusts|accessdate=14 September 2012|work=Envisage Wealth Management Systems}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''United States federal administrative law''' encompasses [[statute]]s, [[common law]], and directives issued by the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] in the [[Executive Office of the President]], that together define the extent of powers and responsibilities held by administrative agencies of the [[United States Government]] (both [[List of federal agencies in the United States|executive branch agencies]] and [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]]). The [[executive (government)|executive]], [[legislature|legislative]], and [[judiciary|judicial]] branches of the [[United States Government|U.S. federal government]] cannot always directly perform their [[United States Constitution|constitutional]] responsibilities.  Specialized powers are therefore delegated to an agency, board, or commission. These administrative governmental bodies oversee and monitor activities in complex areas, such as commercial aviation, medical device manufacturing, and securities markets.

[[Stephen Breyer|Justice Breyer]] defines administrative law in four parts. Namely, the legal rules and principles that: (1) define the authority and structure of administrative agencies; (2) specify the procedural formalities employed by agencies; (3) determine the validity of agency decisions; and (4) define the role of reviewing courts and other governmental entities in relation to administrative agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Breyer, Stephen, et al., ''Administrative Law &amp; Regulatory Policy'', Fifth Edition, at p. 3 (Aspen Pub. 2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. federal agencies have the power to adjudicate, legislate, and enforce laws within their specific areas of delegated power.

==Jurisdiction==
The authority of federal administrative agencies stems from their [[organic statute (USA)|organic statutes]], and must be consistent with constitutional constraints and [[legislative intent]].

==Rulemaking==

Federal administrative agencies, when granted the power to do so in a statutory grant of authority from Congress, may [[promulgate]] rules that have the effect of substantive law.  Agencies "legislate" through [[rulemaking]]—the power to promulgate (or issue) regulations.  Such regulations are codified in the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (CFR) and published in the ''[[Federal Register]]''.

===Administrative law statutes governing rulemaking===

Section 551 of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] gives the following definitions:
* [[Rulemaking]] is "an agency process for formulating, amending, or repealing a rule."
* A rule in turn is "the whole or a part of an agency statement of general or particular applicability and future effect designed to implement, interpret, or prescribe law or policy."

The primary administrative law statutes and other laws that govern agency rule making include:
* The [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]], 5 U.S.C. §§ 552 and 553
* The Housekeeping Act, 5 U.S.C. § 301, which gives heads of agencies authority to issue rules for agency employees
* The [[Regulatory Flexibility Act]], 5 U.S.C. §§ 601 et seq., which requires agencies to consider the needs of small entities in rule making
* The [[Paperwork Reduction Act]], 44 U.S.C. §§ 3501 et seq., which limits the power of an agency to collect information from the public
* The [[Congressional Review Act]], 5 U.S.C. §§ 801–808, which gives Congress the authority to review and veto any agency regulation
* The Independent Offices Appropriations Act of 1952, 31 U.S.C. §§ 9701, which limits the power of agencies to set user fees
* Executive Order 12,866, which requires agencies to use cost-benefit balancing in all regulatory actions

The [[Congressional Review Act]] passed in 1996 created a category of ''major rules'', which are those that the [[Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs]] determines result in either: (1) "an annual effect on the economy of $100,000,000," (2) "a major increase in costs or prices for consumers, individual industries, Federal, State, or local government agencies, or geographic regions," or (3) "significant adverse effects on competition, employment, investment, productivity, innovation, or on the ability of United States-based enterprises to compete with foreign-based enterprises in domestic and export markets."&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations/&gt; If the rule is major, an additional report must be provided to [[United States congressional committee|congressional committees]].&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations/&gt; From 1997 to 2012, the number of major rules has ranged from 100 (2010) to 50 (2002).&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations/&gt;

E.O. ([[Executive order (United States)|Executive Order]]) 12866, which was issued in 1993, requires agencies (other than [[Independent agencies of the United States government|independent agencies]]) to submit proposed rules for reviews by OIRA if the rule meets certain criteria.&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations/&gt; Rules that are "economically significant" (meeting the criteria of "an annual effect on the economy of $100 million or more or adversely affect in a material way the economy") require a [[cost-benefit analysis]].&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations/&gt;

===Scope and extent of rulemaking power===

Limits on the power of agencies to promulgate regulations include:
# The regulation must lie within a grant of power from Congress, and that delegation must in turn be [[nondelegation doctrine|constitutional]] (courts almost never invalidate a regulation on this ground).  The power must be granted in the agency's [[organic statute]], and extends so far as fairly inferrable from the statutory language.&lt;ref&gt;''[[National Petroleum Refiners Assn. v. FTC]]'', 482 F.2d 672 (D.C. Cir. 1983), ''cert. denied'', 415 U.S. 951 (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  Statutory grants of authority to agencies are generally construed more strictly than the "necessary and proper" power of Congress granted in Article I, section 8, clause 18 of the Constitution.
# The regulation must lie within that grant of rulemaking authority (in the extreme case, Congress sometimes includes an explicit limit on the agency's authority).  Some agencies have power to promulgate both [[substantive rule]]s as well as [[procedural rule]]s; some (like the IRS, EEOC, and Patent and Trademark Office) may promulgate only procedural rules.  When Congress grants that authority retroactively, courts carefully scrutinize the case, and sometimes bless the regulation, and sometimes invalidate it.
# The regulation must be promulgated with observance of the procedures of required by the statutes set forth in the previous section.  Among these procedures, one of the most important is the requirement that an agency set forth factual findings sufficient to support a rational basis or by procedures otherwise inadequate to meet the statutes listed above.

Agencies may not promulgate [[retroactive rule]]s unless expressly granted such power by the agency's [[organic statute]].  ''[[Bowen v. Georgetown University Hospital]]'', {{ussc|488|204|1988}}

There is no broad prohibition against an agency's regulation that does not serve the "public convenience, interest, or necessity."  The law presumes that rulemaking conducted with procedural safeguards of the statutes and Executive Orders noted above reflect a rational balancing of interests by the agency, and a court will strike down a regulation only for violation of those procedures.

Agencies are permitted to rely on rules in reaching their decisions rather than adjudicate, where the promulgation of the rules is within the agency's statutory authority, and the rules themselves are not arbitrary or capricious.  ''[[Heckler v. Campbell]]'', {{ussc|461|458|1983}}.

Agencies must abide by their own rules and regulations.  ''[[Accardi v. Shaughnessy]]'', {{ussc|347|260|1954}}.

Courts must defer to administrative agency interpretations of the authority granted to them by Congress (1) where the intent of Congress was ambiguous and (2) where the interpretation was reasonable or permissible. ''[[Chevron U.S.A., Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'', {{Ussc|467|837|1984|el=no}}. ''Chevron'' is probably the most frequently cited case in American administrative law.&lt;ref name="wp2015"&gt;{{cite web| title=When the subject is Obamacare, never forget about Chief Justice Roberts |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/courts_law/when-the-subject-is-obamacare-never-forget-about-chief-justice-roberts/2015/03/05/e12b0ec2-c36e-11e4-ad5c-3b8ce89f1b89_story.html| date= March 5, 2015| first= Robert|last= Barnes |publisher= The Washington Post| accessdate= 2015-03-06 | quote= Roberts’s question was referring to “Chevron deference,” a doctrine mostly unknown beyond the halls of the Capitol and the corridors of the Supreme Court.

It says to the executive branch: Implementation of the law is up to you.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Type of rulemaking===
There are five levels of [[rulemaking]] procedure:
* [[Formal rulemaking]], which is rulemaking for which the [[organic statute]] requires that rules be "made [[court of record|on the record]] after agency opportunity for hearing" (that is, a trial-type hearing that is taken down by a transcriptionist into the record) and for which the APA prescribes particular procedures.  The phrase "on the record" is required to trigger requirements for formal rulemaking; simply requiring that rules be made "after a hearing" does not trigger the requirements of formal rulemaking.
* [[Informal rulemaking]], also known as "notice-and-comment rulemaking," which is rulemaking for which no procedural requirements are prescribed in the [[organic statute]], and for which the APA requires only notice and comment.
* [[Hybrid rulemaking]], which is rulemaking for which particular procedural requirements beyond notice and comment, but not rising to the level of formal rulemaking.
* [[Negotiated rulemaking]] under 5 U.S.C. §§ 561–570 of the Administrative Procedure Act.
* [[Publication rulemaking]], or "nonlegislative rulemaking," typically for procedural rules, interpretative rules, or matters relating to agency management or personnel, that an agency may promulgate by publication in the Federal Register.

=== Nonlegislative rules: interpretative rules, "statements of policy" and guidance ===

"Nonlegislative rules" include three main classes:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Agency Policy Statements |publisher= Administrative Conference of the United States|url = https://www.acus.gov/recommendation/agency-policy-statements|website = www.acus.gov|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* interpretative rules under 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A), which interpret ambiguities in binding rules, but themselves have only the limited binding effect of ''Skidmore'' deference.
* "statements of general policy," purely advisory rules directed to the public, also promulgated under 5 U.S.C. § 553(b)(A).  Typically, a "statement of policy" uses words like "should" instead of "must" or "shall," to advise the public of an agency's preference that the agency does not intend to enforce.
* "housekeeping rules" or "matters relating to agency management or personnel" directed to agency staff, including agency staff manuals, staff instructions and memoranda, and the like, promulgated under 5 U.S.C. § 301 and authority delegated to agency heads.
A class called "guidance" includes all rules '''not''' promulgated by legislative procedure, such as guidance, guidelines, agency staff manuals, staff instructions, opinion letters, interpretive memoranda, policy statements, guidance manuals for the public, circulars, bulletins, advisories, press releases stating agency position, and the like.  The class of "guidance" is almost, but not exactly, coextensive with the union of the sets of interpretative rules, general statements of policy, and housekeeping rules.

====Agency Interpretations: § 553(d) “Interpretative Rules” vs. ''Chevron''/''Auer'' Interpretations====

Every statute and regulation has some lingering ambiguity.  Someone has to have authority to adopt some interpretation, and do so with a minimum of procedural delay. So the law grants every agency the authority to promulgate interpretative rules, and to do so with minimal procedural fuss.  By default, most interpretations slot into the “interpretative rule” category of 5 U.S.C. § 553(b).

If an interpretation satisfies a long list of criteria, then the interpretation is binding on parties before the agency, courts, and the agency itself, under ''[[Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.]]'' (for agency interpretations of statute)&lt;ref&gt;''Chevron U.S.A. Inc. v. Natural Resources Defense Council, Inc.'', 467 U.S. 837 (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Auer v. Robbins]]'' (for agency interpretations of regulations)&lt;ref&gt;''Auer v. Robbins'', 519 U.S. 452, 461 (1997).&lt;/ref&gt;.  (The inquiries under ''Chevron'' and ''Auer'' are slightly different. But the analytical similarities overshadow the differences.  For this short article, we will gloss over the differences, and treat ''Chevron'' and ''Auer'' together).

Any interpretation that fails any one of the ''Chevron''/''Auer'' eligibility bullets from the list below falls into the residual category of “interpretative rule.”

=====Interpretative rules and ''Skidmore'' deference=====

Fundamentally, the § 553(b) “interpretative” exemption from notice and comment is a rule of necessity—laws have to be interpreted, and (for public-facing substantive rules) the agency is the party that can do so fairly, and deference follows to the degree the agency demonstrated diligence in developing its interpretation (under ''Chevron'', ''Auer'', or ''[[Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.]]'', as appropriate).

The ''quid pro quo'' for an agency’s choice to exercise the “interpretative” option, and forego the formalities required for legislative rulemaking or for ''Chevron'' or ''Auer'' deference, is that the agency has very little enhanced power to enforce its interpretation.  If a party challenges the agency's interpretation, an agency’s invocation of the “interpretative” exemption surrenders any claim to heightened ''Chevron'' or ''Auer'' deference,&lt;ref&gt;JEFFREY S. LUBBERS, A GUIDE TO FEDERAL AGENCY RULEMAKING at Part II, § 1(D)(3)(c), at 84 (4th ed. 2006), RICHARD J. PIERCE, ADMINISTRATIVE LAW § 6.4 at 435 (5th ed. 2010),&lt;/ref&gt; and the interpretation falls into the residual category, under which a court gives ''Skidmore'' deference to an agency’s informed position&lt;ref&gt;''Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.'', 323 U.S. 134, 140 (1944)&lt;/ref&gt;:

:We consider that the rulings, interpretations and opinions of the [agency], while not controlling upon the courts by reason of their authority, do constitute a body of experience and informed judgment to which courts and litigants may properly resort for guidance. The weight of such a judgment in a particular case will depend upon the thoroughness evident in its consideration, the validity of its reasoning, its consistency with earlier and later pronouncements, and all those factors which give it power to persuade, if lacking power to control.

As a practical matter, an agency operates under the agency's interpretative rules.  The law permits parties before the agency to argue alternative interpretations, and under the law, agencies are supposed to respond to the arguments, and not foreclose alternatives suggested by parties.  But as a pracitcal matter, agencies seldom give anything more than short shrift consideration to alternatives.  On judicial review, the practical reality is that a court is most likely to agree with the agency, under ''Skidmore'' deference.  But ''Skidmore'' deference is only as strong as the quality of the agency’s analysis, and courts regularly overturn “interpretative” rules.

=====''Chevron''/''Auer'': Formal Interpretations of Statutes or Regulations=====

Some agency interpretations are binding on parties and the courts, under ''Chevron'' deference&lt;ref&gt;''Cooper Technologies Co. v. Dudas'', 536 F.3d 1330, 1337–1338, 87 USPQ2d 1705, 1711 (Fed. Cir. 2008) (citations omitted) (quoting ''Chevron'', 467 U.S. at 843 n.9, 843–844).&lt;/ref&gt;:

:Under the familiar two-step ''Chevron'' analysis, “[w]e always first determine ‘whether Congress has directly spoken to the precise question at issue.’” “We do so by employing the traditional tools of statutory construction: we examine the statute’s text, structure, and legislative history, and apply the relevant canons of interpretation.” “If we find ‘that Congress had an intention on the precise question at issue, that intention is the law and must be given effect ... .’” If we conclude that “Congress either had no intent on the matter, or that Congress’ purpose and intent is unclear,” then we proceed to step two, in which we ask “whether the agency’s interpretation is based on a permissible construction of the statutory language at issue.”

But an agency has to ''earn'' this deference; it is far from automatic. When an agency interprets its own organic statute (for ''Chevron'') or a regulation that it promulgated (under ''Auer''), and the interpretation meets ''all'' the following prerequisites, ''only then'' does the agency receive the high deference of ''Chevron'' or ''Auer''.

* Under “''Chevron'' step zero,” an agency only receives deference when interpreting a statute or rule within its delegated authority, and that it is charged with administering.&lt;ref&gt;''United States v. Mead Corp.'', 533 U.S. 218, 226–227 (2001); ''Adams Fruit Co. v. Barrett'', 494 U.S. 638, 649 (1990) (“even if [the statute’s] language … is ambiguous, we need not defer to the Secretary of Labor’s view of the scope of § 1854 because Congress has expressly established the Judiciary and not the Department of Labor as the adjudicator of private rights of action arising under the statute. A precondition to deference under Chevron is a congressional delegation of administrative authority.”)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under “''Chevron''/''Auer'' step one,” an agency only earns high ''Chevron''/''Auer'' deference for an interpretation where there is an ambiguity in words in the statute or rule, or a delegation of authority by Congress to fill gaps.&lt;ref&gt;''Ethyl Corp. v. EPA'', 51 F.3d 1053, 1060 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (for Chevron, “explicit” requires “Congress … authorizing the agency to adopt implementing regulations,” “implicit” requires ambiguity that requires interpretation, and silence generally implicates expressio unius est exclusio alterius)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under “''Chevron''/''Auer'' step two,” an agency interpretation only receives deference if it is a “reasonable” interpretation of the statutory language considered with statements of Congressional intent, and is supported by a reasonable explanation.
In addition to the three classical steps, an agency must observe additional procedural formalities:
* Not every silence is a ''Chevron''/''Auer'' “gap:” the agency must be charged with filling the gap.  Silences without a Congressional rulemaking charge are just silences, leaving the underlying default in place.&lt;ref&gt;Christensen v. Harris Co., 529 U.S. 576, 588 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The interpretation or implementing regulation at issue must tend to resolve the precise ambiguity or fill the precise gap: overly imprecise rules or interpretations do not receive ''Chevron'' or ''Auer'' deference.&lt;ref&gt;Fogo De Chao (Holdings) Inc. v. U.S. Dept. of Homeland Sec., 769 F.3d 1127 (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;
* High ''Chevron''/''Auer'' deference requires that the agency publish its interpretation with some degree of formality, including any procedural formalities that Congress specifies, either for agencies in general (such as the Paperwork Reduction Act), or specific to the agency—while full-blown notice and comment is not a prerequisite to ''Chevron''/''Auer'' deference, informal statements of agency interpretation are not entitled to ''Chevron''/''Auer'' deference.&lt;ref&gt;''Encino Motorcars , LLC v, Navarro'', 136 S.Ct. 2117, 2124 (2016) (''Chevron'' deference applies when an agency fills a statutory gap by ''regulation''); ''United States v. Mead Corp.'', 533 U.S. 218, 230–231 (2001) (a U.S. Customs ruling letter is not entitled to ''Chevron'' deference); ''Christensen v. Harris Cty.'', 529 U.S. 576, 587 (2000) (agency rules promulgated without hearing or notice and comment are entitled to only ''Skidmore'' deference).&lt;/ref&gt;
* High ''Chevron''/''Auer'' deference requires some level of consistency by the agency.
* An agency can lose ''Chevron''/''Auer'' deference in a specific case if its adjudicatory procedures in that case were haphazard.
* ''Chevron''/''Auer'' only applies to an agency’s interpretations of a statute or rule reached on its own reasoned decisionmaking, not to interpretations of Congressional intent or case law.&lt;ref&gt;''New York, New York LLC v. Nat’l Labor Reln’s Bd.'', 313 F.3d 585, 590 (D.C. Cir. 2002) (“We are not obligated to defer to an agency’s interpretation of Supreme Court precedent under Chevron or any other principle”); ''American Bioscience Inc. v. Thompson'', 269 F.3d 1077, 1085 (D.C. Cir. 2001) (“We, of course, owe no deference to an agency’s reading of judicial orders or decisions”); International Swaps and Derivatives Ass'n v. U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Comm'n, 887 F.Supp.2d 259, 280–281 (D.D.C. 2012) (“deference to an agency's statutory interpretation is only appropriate when the agency has exercised its own judgment, not when it believes that interpretation is compelled by Congress. …  [D]eference to an agency's interpretation of a statute is not appropriate when the agency wrongly believes that interpretation is compelled by Congress.”).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Congress may specify procedures that an agency must use in its gap-filling—a delegation of authority to make “rules” invokes the § 553 defaults for procedure, while a charge to promulgate “regulations” implicates legislative procedure.

=====“Interpretative” rules and “shortcut procedure” exemption of § 553(b)=====

An “interpretative” rule sets out the agency’s interpretation of a statute or rule, without altering rights or obligations.  If the interpretation fails at least one of the ''Chevron''/''Auer'' criteria, then the interpretation falls into the category of “interpretative rule” which binds only the agency itself, and is entitled to at most ''Skidmore'' deference.

======Availability of the § 553(b) “Interpretative” Exemption======

The line for permissible exercise of the § 553(b) “interpretative” exemption is blurry—courts and treatise writers uniformly complain about this.&lt;ref&gt;The distinction between these types of rules has been called "one of the most confusing in administrative law". {{Cite journal|title = Legislative Rules Revisited|jstor = 20141880|journal = The University of Chicago Law Review|date = 2007-01-01|pages = 1705–1722|volume = 74|first = Jacob E.|last = Gersen}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The most basic requirement for the “interpretative” exemption is that the agency “interpret” a validly promulgated law (statute or regulation), by following a recognizable interpretative path originally set out by the statute or regulation. An agency may promulgate an “interpretative” rule “only if the agency’s position can be characterized as an ‘interpretation’ of a statute or legislative regulation rather than as an exercise of independent policymaking authority.”&lt;ref&gt;JEFFREY S. LUBBERS, A GUIDE TO FEDERAL AGENCY RULEMAKING at Part II, II, § 1(D)(3)(e), at 103 (4th ed. 2006);  John Manning, ''Nonlegislative Rules'', 72 GEO. WASH. L. REV. 893, 916 (2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  Mere “consistency” (in the sense of “absence of clash”) is insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;''Mission Group Kan., Inc. v. Riley'', 146 F.3d 775, 781 (10th Cir. 1998) (quoting Richard A. Posner, ''The Rise and Fall of Administrative Law'', 72 Chi.-Kent L. Rev. 953, 962 (1997)).&lt;/ref&gt;  Most “gap filling” is beyond the scope of “interpretative” authority. An “interpretative” rule cannot create a new requirement, carve-out, or exception from whole cloth. If the rule changes “individual rights and obligations” (rather than resolving ambiguity), the rule requires legislative procedure.

An agency may promulgate interpretative rules outside the scope of its rule making authority. Where an agency can only issue legislative rules pursuant to an express grant of authority from Congress, an agency may (and is encouraged to) issue advisory interpretations to guide the public.

If an agency elects the “interpretative” shortcut, there are almost no procedural requirements, beyond the publication required by 5 U.S.C. § 552 and § 552(d).  The decision maker must ensure that there is indeed an ambiguity that is not resolved by any binding law, but if the ambiguity exists, the decision maker simply interprets as best he or she may. If the issue is outside the agency’s scope of rule making authority,&lt;ref&gt;''In re Stepan Co.'', 660 F.3d 1341, 1345, 100 USPQ2d 1489, 1492 (Fed. Cir. 2011) (“[T]he PTO’s regulatory interpretation is due no deference in view of the agency’s statutory obligation under the Administrative Procedure Act (‘APA’) to provide prior notice to the applicant of all ‘matters of fact and law asserted’ prior to an appeal hearing before the Board. 5 U.S.C. § 554(b)(3). Allowing the Board unfettered discretion to designate a new ground of rejection—when it relies upon facts or legal argument not advanced by the examiner—would frustrate the notice requirements of the APA.”).&lt;/ref&gt;, the agency must follow the agency or courts that do have authority on that specific issue.

======Consequence of the “Interpretative” Exemption======

In return for the privilege of bypassing rule making procedure, the agency risks loss of binding effect for an interpretative rule. “An agency issuing an interpretative rule . . . may well intend that its interpretation bind its own personnel and may expect compliance from regulated individuals or entities. Nonetheless, the agency cannot expect the interpretation to be binding in court; because it does not have the force of law, parties can challenge the interpretation.”&lt;ref&gt;JEFFREY S. LUBBERS, A GUIDE TO FEDERAL AGENCY RULEMAKING at Part II, § 1(D)(3)(c), at 82 (4th ed. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Many courts have characterized interpretative rules as only “[[Hortative|hortative]]” and “lacking force of law.”&lt;ref&gt;''Chrysler Corp. v. Brown'', 441 U.S. 281, 315 (1979) (after an agency characterizes a rule as “interpretative,” “a court is not required to give effect to an interpretative regulation”)&lt;/ref&gt;

In proceedings before the agency, a party may advance alternative positions or interpretations, and the agency must address them, without relying on an interpretative rule as the last word.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices § II(2)(h), 72 Fed. Reg. 3432 (Jan. 25, 2007)) &lt;/ref&gt;

Interpretative rules are binding on agency employees, including its administrative law judges (ALJs).&lt;ref&gt;''Yale-New Haven Hosp. v. Leavitt'', 470 F.3d 71, 80 (2d Cir. 2006) (“an interpretative rule binds an agency’s employees, including its ALJs”)&lt;/ref&gt; If an interpretative rule (say, a provision of the MPEP, or the PTAB Trial Guidelines) sets a “floor” under the rights of a party, individual employees have no discretion to back out of the agency’s interpretation or create ad hoc exceptions adverse to the party.

===“Statements of Policy”===

“Statements of policy” are even weaker statements than “interpretative” rules. Agencies use them to express agency preferences, but with no binding effect.  Policy statements are “tentative intentions,” nonbinding rules of thumb, suggestions for conduct, and tentative indications of an agency’s hopes. Policy statements have no binding effect. A policy statement “genuinely leaves the agency and its decisionmakers free to exercise discretion,” and “a statement of policy may not have a present effect: a ‘general statement of policy’ is one that does not impose any rights and obligations.”&lt;ref&gt;''Community Nutrition Inst. v. Young'', 818 F.2d 943, 946 (D.C. Cir. 1987); ''Brock v. Cathedral Bluffs Shale Oil Co.'', 796 F.2d 533, 536–537 (D.C. Cir. 1986) (Scalia, J.).&lt;/ref&gt;

Agencies likewise use “policy statements” to offer a unilateral ''quid pro quo'' or set a floor for agency procedure (“If you the public do X, we the agency promise favorable outcome Y. If you don’t do X, you can still convince us to do Y by arguing the controlling law.”).

A near-certain indicator of a “statement of policy” is the word “should” rather than “must.” 

Agency policy statements are not binding on courts, and therefore receive no ''Chevron'' deference, not even weak ''Skidmore'' deference.&lt;ref&gt;''Bechtel v. FCC'', 10 F.3d 875 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (an agency policy statement is not due even ''Skidmore'' deference); ''Vietnam Veterans of Am. v. Sec’y of the Navy'', 843 F.2d 528 (D.C. Cir. 1988) (policy statements do not bind courts).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guidance===

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, many agencies were bypassing the APA’s requirements for rulemaking by tucking rules into informal documents like agency staff manuals and the like.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Interpretive Rules, Policy Statements, Guidances, Manuals, and the Lik" by Robert A. Anthony|url = http://scholarship.law.duke.edu/dlj/vol41/iss6/1/|website = scholarship.law.duke.edu|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is simply illegal.  The Executive Office of the President stepped in to stop bootleg rulemaking, and forbade this practice.&lt;ref&gt;Executive Office of the President, Office of Management and Budget, Final Bulletin for Agency Good Guidance Practices § IV, OMB Memorandum M-07-07, http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/memoranda/fy2007/m07-07.pdf (Jan. 18, 2007), 72 Fed. Reg. 3432 (Jan. 25, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Some agencies, for example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, have nonetheless continued to defy the law, and state their formal refusal to implement the President's directive.

The distinction between these types of rules has been called "one of the most confusing in administrative law".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Legislative Rules Revisited|jstor = 20141880|journal = The University of Chicago Law Review|date = 2007-01-01|pages = 1705–1722|volume = 74|first = Jacob E.|last = Gersen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Number of rules ===
About 2,500 to 4,000 rules are published per year, and in 2011 32% of the Federal Register pages were in the "Rules and Regulation" section.&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations&gt;Carey MP. (2013). [http://www.fas.org/sgp/crs/misc/R43056.pdf Counting Regulations: An Overview of Rulemaking, Types of Federal Regulations, and Pages in the Federal Register]. CRS.&lt;/ref&gt; However, included in the total number of rules are the repeal of rules and also minor rules.&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations/&gt; The GAO maintains a Federal Rules Database and in 2012, 68% of rules were classified as Routine/Info/Other while the remainder were Significant/Substantive.&lt;ref name=CountingRegulations/&gt; In addition to an overall number of rules, there are "major rules" and "significant" rules.

==Adjudication==

Section 551 of the [[Administrative Procedure Act (United States)|Administrative Procedure Act]] gives the following definitions:* [[Adjudication]] is "an agency process for the formulation of an order;"
* An [[Court order|order]] in turn is "the whole or part of a final disposition ... of an agency in a matter other than rule making but including licensing;"

===Right to a hearing===
There are two ways that an individual can attain the right to a hearing in an adjudicative proceeding.  First, the [[Due Process]] clause of the [[Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution|5th Amendment]] or [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|14th Amendment]] can require that a hearing be held if the interest that is being adjudicated is sufficiently important or if, without a hearing, there is a strong chance that the petitioner will be erroneously denied that interest.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Mathews v. Eldridge]]''&lt;/ref&gt;  A hearing can also be required if a statute somehow mandates the agency to hold formal hearings when adjudicating certain issues.

=== Conclusion ===
The adjudication will typically be completed with a written report containing [[Question of fact|findings of fact]] and [[Question of law|conclusions of law]], both at the state and federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = "Making Findings of Fact and Preparing a Decision " by Patrick J. Borchers|url = http://digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu/naalj/vol11/iss2/2/|website = digitalcommons.pepperdine.edu|access-date = 2016-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the affected does not wish to contest the action, a [[Consent decree|consent order]] may be published allowing for the hearing to be bypassed.

===Federal tribunals===
{{main article|Federal tribunals in the United States}}

==Determining whether rulemaking or adjudication is appropriate==
Agency actions are divided into two broad categories discussed above, [[rulemaking]] and [[adjudication]].  For agency decisions that have broad impact on a number of parties, including parties not specifically before the agency, the agency must use the procedures of rulemaking (see the bullet list in "Administrative law statutes governing rulemaking" above).  Because actions by rulemaking affect many parties, rulemaking procedures are designed to ensure public participation, and are therefore more cumbersome, except that the agency is permitted to seek comment by publication of notice, without soliciting the views of specific parties.  For decisions that, on first glance, affect only a small number of parties that actually appear before the agency (see the section on "Adjudication" above), the agency may use procedures that are generally simpler, but that require the agency specifically solicit input from the directly affected parties.

Adjudication decisions may become precedent that binds future parties, so the transition zone between the regime for rulemaking and the regime for adjudication is very hazy.

The classical test for the dividing line is seen in the contrast between two cases decided a few years apart, both involving taxes levied by the city of Denver Colorado.  In 1908, in ''[[Londoner v. City and County of Denver]]'', a tax levied on residents of a particular street was held to be an adjudication, and the Supreme Court ordered the city to do a "do over," because the residents of the street were not given sufficient opportunity to be heard.  Then, in 1915, in ''[[Bi-Metallic Investment Co. v. State Board of Equalization]]'', a tax levied on the entire city of Denver was held to be rulemaking, and the city's action of imposing the tax was affirmed.

Factors tending to make an act adjudicative in nature:
*Involving a small number of people
*Individuals involved are specially affected by the act
*Decision based on the facts of an individual case, rather than policy concerns

For most agencies, the choice of whether to [[promulgate]] rules or proceed by [[common law]] adjudicative decisions rests in the informed discretion of agencies.  ''[[SEC v. Chenery Corp. (1947)|SEC v. Chenery Corp.]]'', {{ussc|332|194|1947}} (Dissenting opinion arguing that the decision permitted agencies to rule arbitrarily, without law).  Agencies may also announce new policies in the course of such adjudications.  Some agencies' organic statutes obligate the agency to use rulemaking, for example, the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office, 35 U.S.C. § 2(b)(2)(B).

== Judicial review ==
A party aggrieved by an agency action (either rulemaking or adjudication) may seek judicial review (that is, sue) as provided by an agency's organic statute or by §§ 701-706 of the Administrative Procedure Act.

Studies of judicial review typically find that 70% of agency rules are upheld with the Supreme Court upholding 91% of rules; a 2011 empirical study of [[judicial review]] found that 76% were upheld,&lt;ref&gt;Pierce RJ, Weiss J. (2011). [http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/alr/vol63/iss3/3/ An Empirical Study of Agency Interpretations of Agency Rules]. ''Administrative Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt; although the [[United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit|D.C. Circuit]], which hears many administrative law cases, has been found less deferential than other courts.&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, RJ. (2011). [http://digitalcommons.wcl.american.edu/alr/vol63/iss1/3/ What Do the Studies of Judicial Review of Agency Actions Mean?]. ''Administrative Law Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==State-level administrative law==
[[U. S. state|States]] may have their own administrative law; for example, a [[State constitution (United States)|state constitution]] may allow the [[state legislature (United States)|legislature]] to delegate [[rule-making]] authority to an executive or independent agency, and [[state government]]s may provide an [[administrative appeal]] process for people who are dissatisfied with decisions made by certain [[U. S. state|state]] agencies.

Many states, such as [[Kentucky]], have been less willing than the federal government to allow their agencies to promulgate rules with the effect of substantive law.

The states have widely instituted Home Rule by which the Cities are given Broad Powers that allow them to enact any law that is not prohibited by the States Constitutions or already addressed by State Laws or State Codes.  This widespread institution of [[Home rule in the United States|Home Rule]] has resulted in more administrative laws being passed by the cities.

California has an extensive body of administrative law including a [http://www.oah.dgs.ca.gov/default.htm hearing agency] that requires that its administrative law judges be lawyers.  California statutory law governing the hearing agency states that [http://www.oah.dgs.ca.gov/DDS+Mediation+and+Hearings/FairHearings.htm non-lawyers] may appear before it.  However, California case law holds that [http://www.cppf.us/CPR/Articles/2006/02MApr06/0206BolBenn.html former attorneys] who no longer practice law may [http://www.lacba.org/showpage.cfm?pageid=7513 not appear] before it.  Most California agencies adjudicate license cases utilizing the [http://ag.ca.gov/careers/descriptions/civillaw.php California Attorney General's legal staff]. However, others (including the [http://www.corp.ca.gov/ENF/list/default.asp Department of Corporations] and [http://www.insurance.ca.gov/0500-about-us/0500-organization/0200-fraud/index.cfm Insurance]) utilize their own legal staff.--&gt;

{{distinguish|writ of execution}}
A '''warrant of execution''' is a form of [[writ of execution]] used in the [[County Court|County court]] in England and Wales (only). It is a method of enforcing [[judgement]]s and empowers a [[county court bailiff]] to attend a [[judgement debtor]]’s (hereafter, debtor) address to take goods for sale. The closest equivalent in Scotland is a Charge for Payment, executed by [[Sheriff officer|Sheriff Officers]] after a decree (a [[Scots Law]] [[judgement]]) is granted in a [[Sheriff Court]] in favour of a pursuer ([[plaintiff|claimant]]) seeking recovery of a debt or other sum due.

==Procedure==

An application for a warrant of execution can be made by the [[judgment creditor|judgement creditor]] (hereafter, creditor) at any point following the entry of judgement.

The request can be made for any amount up to the outstanding value of the judgement along with an application for the costs of requesting the warrant.

A warrant of execution can be issued in the County Court to recover a debt between £50 (£600 if the debtor is in [[Scotland]]) and £5,000. If amount sought is more than £600 it can be enforced in the [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] using a writ of control.

The value of the warrant will calculated by adding the amount of the request, plus the court fee and creditor's costs (if granted).

As the warrant can only be sought on a judgement debt of £5,000 or less, statutory [[interest]] is not recoverable.

Upon issue of the Warrant the court will transfer the case to the debtor's local court and write to the debtor informing them of the warrant. The debtor is currently given seven days to pay the amount of the warrant without further action; if the defendant pays within this time, the warrant is cancelled and the money is sent by the court to the creditor.  

Should the defendant fail to pay, the bailiff will visit the premises of the defendant, usually within fifteen working days, and attempt to identify items which can be sold at auction to recoup the outstanding debt, subject to the restrictions below.  Such items are usually removed and stored, the storage costs being added on to the outstanding balance.  The items are auctioned, usually without a reserve price, and the resulting amount (less auctioneer fees) is paid to the creditor.

If there is still an outstanding balance, the bailiff may again visit and seize further goods or assets.

Instead of actually removing goods, the bailiff can take payment from the debtor or agree to return later to allow the debtor to gather funds. If the debtor agrees to pay later the bailiff may take [[walking possession]] of goods as a [[surety]] of payment.

==Right of entry==

The warrant grants limited rights of entry to the bailiff depending on the type of property and whether the bailiff has already successfully visited the debtor.

===Residential property===

A bailiff can only enter using peaceable means unless they have a High Court writ giving them the right to force entry. When forcing entry they must have a locksmith and police officer present and cannot force entry themselves. The locksmith can break into a locked door and if the debtor attempts to bar entry then the police officer can remove them or the bailiff can use reasonable force to remove them. 
Peaceable entry means that they cannot push past the debtor to get in though an open door, they cannot get in though an open window (the law previously allowed them to do so), they cannot climb over fences or locked gates; they can only gain entry though an unlocked door or unlocked gate. Gaining entry to the land (i.e. the garden) does not give them permission to force entry into the property. They do not require permission to enter the property.

If the bailiff has previously been admitted and is returning to collect payment or goods to be sold, then they have a right of entry to residential property even if the occupants refuse to let them in. In this case they can force entry.

===Business premises===

If there is no living accommodation attached and the bailiff has good reason to believe the debtor has goods inside, they  may force entry to business premises.

==Goods that cannot be seized==

Social policy considerations, particularly the requirements enshrined in the Overriding Objective of the [[Civil Procedure Rules 1998]], currently limit the goods which the bailiff may take.

The goods must currently meet the following criteria:

* The goods or items are required by the debtor to carry out business; examples of this are a tradesman's tools or reference books
* Essential household items which the debtor and their family require such as clothing or bedding
* Items which do not belong to the debtor; for example items that are subject to a hire purchase agreement, leased or rented from a third party. Goods that are joint owned by the debtor can be seized.
* Goods already marked for seizure by another bailiff dealing with a different warrant

As the warrant is a specific sanctioned interference with the debtor's general right to enjoyment of his property any question as to whether goods are or are not available for seizure is likely to be determined in the Defendant's favour.

==Suspending a warrant==

The defendant may apply for the warrant to be suspended; this application must state reasons, for instance an offer to pay by instalments, and usually requires payment of a fee.  The court will inform the creditor of the application and require them to confirm whether they agree to the suspension and if not to state why and, in the case of an offer, what they would accept.

If the suspension is contested the court will list the application for a hearing. The court will there decide whether the warrant should be suspended, and whether terms attach to the suspension. The court is not bound by the party's suggested payment regimes.

==Duration of a warrant==

Warrants last for a period of one year from the date of issue.  In some cases a fee can be paid to extend the warrant's life beyond one year, but the creditor must supply the court with sufficient reason for such an extension to be granted, and - unless there are exceptional circumstances - apply before the warrant expires.
