&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt; Finals televised on tape delay.  Ennis, TX race broadcast schedule and channel changed from FS2 to FS1 because of [[2018 National League Division Series]] presented by Doosan Game 3 start times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nhra.com/tv/2018/nhra-mello-yello-drag-racing-series|title=NHRA Mello Yello Drag Racing Series TV schedule|accessdate=January 30, 2018|work=NHRA.com|publisher=[[National Hot Rod Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Additional Rules for Specially Marked Races===
''4 Lanes'':  The Four-Wide Nationals in both Las Vegas and Charlotte in the spring will compete with cars on four lanes.
* All cars will qualify on each lane as all four lanes will be used in qualifying.
* Three rounds with cars using all four lanes.
* In Rounds One and Two, the top two drivers (of four) will advance to the next round.
* The pairings are set as follows:
** Race One:  1, 8, 9, 16
** Race Two:  4, 5, 12, 13
** Race Three:  2, 7, 10, 15
** Race Four:  3, 6, 11, 14
** Semifinal One:  Top two in Race One and Race Two
** Semifinal Two:  Top two in Race Three and Race Four
** Finals:  Top two in Semifinal One and Semifinal Two
* Lane choice determined by times in previous round.  In first round, lane choice determined by fastest times.
* Drivers who advance in Rounds One and Two will receive 20 points for each round advancement.
* In Round Three, the winner of the race will be declared the race winner and will collect 40 points.  The runner-up will receive 20 points.  Third and fourth place drivers will be credited as semifinal losers.

''1.5'':  The U. S. Nationals and Auto Club Finals will have their race points increased by 50% .  Drivers who qualify but are eliminated in the first round receive 30 points, and each round win is worth 30 points.  The top four receive 10, 9, 8, and 7 points, respectively, for qualifying positions, with the 5-6 drivers receiving 6 points, 7-8 drivers receiving 5 points, 9-12 receiving 4 points, and 13-16 receiving 3 points.  Also, the top four, not three, drivers after each session receive points for fastest times in each round (4-3-2-1).

===Event changes===
On January 16, 2018, [[Old Bridge Township Raceway Park]] in Englishtown, New Jersey ceased all drag racing operations at the facility due to ongoing safety concerns as well as rising maintenance costs. Two weeks later, the [[NHRA Summernationals]], already scheduled to take place there in June, was announced to be moved to [[Virginia Motorsports Park]] in Petersburg, Virginia.&lt;ref name="ENGLISHTOWN"&gt;[https://bangshift.com/bangshift1320/bad-news-raceway-park-englishtown-new-jersey-will-cease-drag-racing-operations/ BangShift.com, ''Bad News: Raceway Park Will Cease Drag Racing Operations – The End Of Englishtown Appears To Be Nigh'' by Brian Lohnes, January 16, 2018], Retrieved Jan. 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;  The last NHRA professional event took place at VMP in 2009.&lt;ref name="VIRGINIA"&gt;[https://www.nhra.com/news/2018/nhra-virginia-nationals National Hot Rod Association, ''NHRA partners with Virginia Motorsports Park to host NHRA Virginia Nationals'', NHRA.com, January 30, 2018], Retrieved Jan. 30, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of a series of [[Monster Energy NASCAR Cup Series]] date changes, the NHRA changed the dates of numerous rounds to avoid conflicts.  The race in Joliet was moved to early June, as the normal date had been reassigned to the [[Overton's 400|NASCAR meeting]] at the nearby Chicagoland Speedway, and the Countdown dates in Reading and Charlotte were swapped since the Charlotte date would have been too close to the [[Bank of America Roval 400|NASCAR road course playoff race]].

''2'': Due to inclement weather throughout the day, Final Elimination Rounds at the Menards NHRA Heartland Nationals in Topeka, Kansas did not start until around 7 PM CDT on May 20, 2018. After fog began settling in during the second round of pro racing, it was postponed until the following day at 10 AM CDT when the semifinal and final rounds were held.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1984">'''Aliw Awards''' by the Aliw Awards Foundation, Inc. was established by the renowned [[Philippine]] [[journalist]] [[Alice H. Reyes]], to recognize achievements in the live [[entertainment]] industry in the Philippines. Founded in 1976 in [[Manila]], it is the pioneer in giving awards for excellence in [[theatre]], [[opera]], [[dance]], live [[singing|vocal]] and [[instrumental]] shows.

The first awards show was held in 1977 with singer [[Pilita Corrales]] winning the Entertainer of the Year Award followed by [[Rico Puno]] and [[Celeste Legaspi]] in 1978 and 1979, respectively. In 2007, the Award was given to [[Regine Velasquez]], who also received it in 2009. In the 2011 Aliw Awards, 19-year-old International Singing Sensation [[Charice]] was the recipient, making her the youngest artist to be conferred such recognition.

[[Sarah Geronimo]] is one of the female artist in the history to win all of the major awards from "Entertainer of The Year" in 2010,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/news/27130/sarah-geronimo-named-entertainer-of-the-year-at-the-23rd-aliw-awards&lt;/ref&gt; "Best Female in Major Concert" in 2010 and in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/news/27130/sarah-geronimo-named-entertainer-of-the-year-at-the-23rd-aliw-awards&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.remate.ph/2012/11/mga-wagi-sa-25th-aliw-awards/&lt;/ref&gt; "Best Collaboration for a Major Concert
" for What Love Is with [[Martin Nievera]] in 2011&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pep.ph/guide/at-a-glance/9289/elmo-magalona-and-julie-anne-san-jose-were-hailed-as-best-teen-performers-angeline-quinto-named-best-new-artist-by-aliw-awards/1/2#focus&lt;/ref&gt; and "Most Promising Female Entertainer" in 2003. The other female artist to win all major awards is Regine Velasquez.&lt;ref&gt;http://filmacademyphil.org/?page_id=1151&lt;/ref&gt;

''Aliw'' is the root word meaning "to entertain" in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

The 2,600 ton vessel had been in the sea and was flung 2 to 3 kilometres inland by the [[2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tyglobalist.org/focus/riding-out-the-next-big-wave/|title=Riding Out the Next Big Wave|last=|first=|date=22 October 2010|website=|publisher=[[The Yale Globalist]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was owned by PLN, the local power generating company, and crashed upon two homes when it landed, killing those inside. Visitors are able to enter the ship, and can explore the interior in its entirety.

This boat was given to Aceh during the Aceh conflict between the government and [[Free Aceh Movement|GAM]] (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka). In 2012–2013 the boat was renovated and now has 2 towers, a monument, a flying walk &amp; jogging area and a fountain.

'''Ballechin House'''  was a [[Georgian architecture|Georgian]] [[estate (house)|estate]] home near [[Grandtully]], [[Perthshire]], Scotland. It was built in 1806,&lt;ref name="Herald"/&gt; on the site of an old manor house which had been owned by the Steuart family since the 15th century.&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia  | title = Ballechin House  | encyclopedia = The Element Encyclopedia of the Psychic World  | volume =   | pages = 59 | publisher = Harper Element  | year = 2006  | id =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

In 1834 Major Robert Steuart (1806-1876)&lt;ref name=mitchell44&gt;{{cite book | title=Mystical Scotland | author=Ann Lindsay Mitchell | publisher=Dundurn Press | year=1994 | isbn=1-85877-005-X | page=44 }}&lt;/ref&gt; inherited the house and rented it to tenants whilst he served in the [[Indian Army]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; During his time in India, Steuart came to believe in [[reincarnation]] and [[transmigration of the soul|transmigration]].&lt;ref name=hall74&gt;Hall (1980) p.74&lt;/ref&gt;  He returned to the house in 1850 and lived there with numerous dogs: he is reported to have stated that he would return in the form of a dog.&lt;ref name=mitchell44/&gt;&lt;ref name=hall74/&gt;  Major Steuart was unmarried, but local gossip linked his name with that of his much younger housekeeper who died there in 1873.&lt;ref name=mitchell44/&gt;&lt;ref name=hall74/&gt;  After the Major's death, the house was inherited by his nephew John Skinner who assumed the name Steuart.&lt;ref name=hall100&gt;Hall (1980) p.100&lt;/ref&gt;  Fearing that his uncle would reincarnate in the form of one of his dogs, the new owner reportedly shot them all.&lt;ref name=hall74/&gt; From this story came the legend that Robert Steuart was forced to haunt the house as a disembodied spirit.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; The first reported haunting at the house took place in 1876; the witness was a maid in the house.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoS"/&gt;

==Society for Psychical Research investigation==

In 1897 an investigation of the house was organized by [[John Crichton-Stuart, 3rd Marquess of Bute]] with the assistance of paranormal researchers from the [[Society for Psychical Research]].&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SoS"/&gt; Ballechin House was known as "The Most Haunted House in Scotland",&lt;ref name="SoS"&gt;{{cite news|author = |title = The spirit of sanity|quote = |publisher = Scotland on Sunday|date = March 9, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author = Laura Miller|title = Ghost world|quote = |publisher = Salon.com|date = August 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; with several similarities to the [[Borley Rectory]] haunting, including the alleged [[Apparitional experience|apparition]] of a ghostly nun.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;  The team of investigators from the [[Society for Psychical Research]] included Colonel Lemesurier Taylor and the notorious [[Ada Goodrich Freer]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Harry Price|Price, Harry]]. (1945). ''Poltergeist Over England''. Country Life. p. 224&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=brake231&gt;{{cite book | title=Dictionary of nineteenth-century journalism in Great Britain and Ireland | author1=Laurel Brake | author2=Marysa Demoor | publisher=Academia Press | year=2009 | isbn=90-382-1340-9 | page=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1899, ''The Alleged Haunting of B---- House'' by Crichton-Stuart and Freer was published, and serialised in ''[[The Times]]'', containing a journal of the phenomena kept by Freer.&lt;ref name="book"/&gt;

J. Callender Ross who had stayed at the house stated in ''The Times'' that there was no evidence for any supernatural disturbances and considered the whole investigation to be fraudulent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perthshirediary.com/html/day1217.html "The 'unhaunted' Ballechin House"]. Perthshire Diary.&lt;/ref&gt; The SPR later removed material from a volume of their Proceedings on the investigation and denounced Freer. Psychical researcher [[Frederic W. H. Myers]] who was originally supportive of the investigation wrote in a letter to ''The Times'' he "greatly doubt[ed] whether there was anything supernormal" at the house.&lt;ref name="Grimes"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Late Victorian Gothic: Mental Science, the Uncanny, and Scenes of Writing | author=Hilary Grimes | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | year=2011 | isbn=1-4094-2720-X | pages=87–90 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Trevor H. Hall]] revealed that Freer was an unreliable investigator, had deceived the SPR, plagiarised material and lied about her own life.&lt;ref name="Grimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[John Grant (author)|Grant, John]]. (2015). ''Spooky Science: Debunking the Pseudoscience of the Afterlife''. Sterling Publishing. pp. 46-49. {{ISBN|978-1-4549-1654-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballechin House was uninhabited by 1932, and most of the house was demolished in 1963, after a fire, leaving only the former servants quarters and outbuildings.&lt;ref name="Herald"&gt;{{cite news|author = Graeme Virtue|title = Favourite haunts|quote = |publisher = The Sunday Herald|date = October 31, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="book"/&gt; Also lost was art work and furniture which had been collected by generations of the Steuart family, including many pieces from the far east, reflecting successive [[laird]]s' involvement in the [[British East India Company]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The '''Battle of Thermopylae''' ({{IPAc-en|θ|ər|ˈ|m|ɒ|p|ᵻ|l|iː}} {{respell|thər|MOP|i-lee}}; [[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Μάχη τῶν Θερμοπυλῶν}}, ''Máchē tōn Thermopylōn'') was fought between an alliance of [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] [[city-state]]s, led by [[Leonidas I|King Leonidas]] of [[Sparta]], and the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] of [[Xerxes I]] over the course of three days, during the [[second Persian invasion of Greece]]. It took place simultaneously with the naval [[Battle of Artemisium|battle at Artemisium]], in August or September 480 BC, at the narrow coastal pass of [[Thermopylae]] ("The Hot Gates"). The Persian invasion was a delayed response to the defeat of the [[first Persian invasion of Greece]], which had been ended by the [[Classical Athens|Athenian]] victory at the [[Battle of Marathon]] in 490 BC. By 480 BC Xerxes had amassed a huge army and navy, and set out to conquer all of Greece. The Athenian politician and general [[Themistocles]] had proposed that the allied Greeks block the advance of the Persian army at the pass of Thermopylae, and simultaneously block the Persian navy at the Straits of [[Battle of Artemisium|Artemisium]].

A Greek force of approximately 7,000 men marched north to block the pass in the middle of 480 BC. The Persian army, alleged by the ancient sources to have numbered over one million, but today considered to have been much smaller (various figures are given by scholars, ranging between about 100,000 and 150,000),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sacks|first=Kenneth|title=Understanding Emerson: "The American scholar" and his struggle for self-reliance |year=2003|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-09982-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bi1Zd1o9MRwC&amp;pg=PA157 |page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cassin-Scott|first=Jack|title=The Greek and Persian Wars 500-323 B.C. |year=1977|publisher=Osprey|isbn=978-0-85045-271-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=geWUfjew_PEC&amp;pg=PA11|page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; arrived at the pass in late August or early September. The vastly outnumbered Greeks held off the Persians for seven days (including three of battle) before the rear-guard was annihilated in one of history's most famous [[last stand]]s. During two full days of battle, the small force led by Leonidas blocked the only road by which the massive Persian army could pass. After the second day, a local resident named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] betrayed the Greeks by revealing a small path that led behind the Greek lines. Leonidas, aware that his force was being outflanked, dismissed the bulk of the Greek army and remained to guard their retreat with 300 [[Spartan hoplite|Spartans]] and 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], fighting to the death. Others also reportedly remained, including up to 900 [[helots]] and 400 [[Thebes, Greece|Thebans]]; these Thebans mostly reportedly surrendered.

Themistocles was in command of the Greek Navy at Artemisium when he received news that the Persians had taken the pass at Thermopylae. Since the Greek strategy required both Thermopylae and Artemisium to be held, given their losses, it was decided to withdraw to [[Salamis Island|Salamis]]. The Persians overran [[Boeotia]] and then captured the evacuated Athens. The Greek fleet—seeking a decisive victory over the Persian armada—attacked and defeated the invaders at the [[Battle of Salamis]] in late 480 BC. Wary of being trapped in Europe, Xerxes withdrew with much of his army to Asia (losing most to starvation and disease), leaving [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] to attempt to complete the conquest of Greece. However, the following year saw a Greek army decisively defeat the Persians at the [[Battle of Plataea]], thereby ending the Persian invasion.

Both ancient and modern writers have used the Battle of Thermopylae as an example of the power of a patriotic army defending its native soil. The performance of the defenders is also used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as [[force multiplier]]s and has become a symbol of courage against overwhelming odds.

==Sources==
{{Main|Herodotus}}
The primary source for the Greco-Persian Wars is the Greek historian [[Herodotus]]. The Sicilian historian [[Diodorus Siculus]], writing in the 1st century BC in his ''[[Bibliotheca historica]]'', also provides an account of the Greco-Persian wars, partially derived from the earlier Greek historian [[Ephorus]]. This account is fairly consistent with Herodotus'.&lt;ref&gt;Diodorus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.28 XI, 28–34],&lt;/ref&gt; The Greco-Persian wars are also described in less detail by a number of other ancient historians including Plutarch, [[Ctesias of Cnidus]], and are referred to by other authors, as in [[Aeschylus]] in ''[[The Persians]]''.

Archaeological evidence, such as the [[Serpent Column]] (now in the [[Hippodrome of Constantinople]]), also supports some of Herodotus' specific claims.&lt;ref&gt;Note to Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.81 IX, 81]&lt;/ref&gt; George B. Grundy was the first modern historian to do a thorough topographical survey of the narrow pass at Thermopylae, and to the extent that modern accounts of the battle differ from Herodotus' they usually follow Grundy's.&lt;ref&gt;''The Great Persian War and its Preliminaries; A Study of the Evidence, Literary and Topographical'', George B. Grundy, John Murray, Albemarle Street, London, 1901. [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/009789346]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the military strategist [[Sir Basil Henry Liddell Hart]] defers to Grundy.&lt;ref&gt;Chapter II, ''Strategy'', Second Revised Edition, Frederick A. Praeger, New York, 1967&lt;/ref&gt;  Grundy also explored [[Plataea]] and wrote a treatise on that battle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Topography of the Battle of Plataea: The City of Plataea, the Field of Leuctra'', G.B.Grundy [http://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/000665049]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the Battle of Thermopylae itself, two principal sources, Herodotus' and [[Simonides]]' accounts, survive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cartledge|first1=Paul|title=Thermopylae : the battle that changed the world|date=2007|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn=9780330419185|page=215|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, Herodotus' account of the battle, in Book VII of his ''Histories'', is such an important source that Paul Cartledge wrote: "we either write a history of Thermopylae with [Herodotus], or not at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cartledge|first1=Paul|title=Thermopylae : the battle that changed the world|date=2007|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn=9780330419185|page=224|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also surviving is an epitome of the account of Ctesias, by the eighth-century Byzantine Photias, though this is "almost worse than useless",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cartledge|first1=Paul|title=Thermopylae : the battle that changed the world|date=2007|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn=9780330419185|page=231|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt; missing key events in the battle such as the betrayal of Ephialtes, and the account of [[Diodorus Siculus]] in his ''Universal History''. Diodorus' account seems to have been based on that of Ephorus and contains one significant deviation from Herodotus' account: a supposed night attack against the Persian camp, of which modern scholars have tended to be sceptical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bradford|first1=Ernle|title=Thermopylae : the battle for the West|date=2004|publisher=Da Capo Press|location=New York|isbn=9780306813603|page=137|edition=1st Da Capo Press pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cartledge|first1=Paul|title=Thermopylae : the battle that changed the world|date=2007|publisher=Pan|location=London|isbn=9780330419185|page=146|edition=1. pbk.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Greco-Persian Wars|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}
[[File:Map Greco-Persian Wars-en.svg|thumb|400px|right|A map of almost all the parts of the [[Ancient Greece|Greek world]] that partook in the Persian Wars]]
The Greek city-states of [[Athens]] and [[Eretria]] had encouraged the unsuccessful [[Ionian Revolt]] against the Persian Empire of [[Darius I]] in 499–494 BC. The Persian Empire was still relatively young and prone to revolts amongst its subject peoples.&lt;ref name = h47&gt;Holland, p. 47–55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="h203"/&gt; Darius, moreover, was a
usurper and had spent considerable time extinguishing revolts against his rule.&lt;ref name = h47/&gt;

The Ionian revolt threatened the integrity of his empire, and Darius thus vowed to punish those involved, especially the Athenians, "since he was sure that [the Ionians] would not go unpunished for their rebellion".&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+5.105 V, 105]&lt;/ref&gt; Darius also saw the opportunity to expand his empire into the fractious world of Ancient Greece.&lt;ref name = h171&gt;Holland, 171–178&lt;/ref&gt; A preliminary expedition under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] in 492 BC, to secure the land approaches to Greece, re-conquered [[Thrace]] and forced [[Macedon]] to become a client kingdom of Persia's.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.44.1 VI, 44]&lt;/ref&gt;

Darius sent emissaries to all the Greek city-states in 491 BC asking for a gift of "[[earth and water]]" as tokens of their submission to him.&lt;ref name = h178&gt;Holland, pp. 178–179&lt;/ref&gt; Having had a demonstration of his power the previous year, the majority of Greek cities duly obliged. In Athens, however, the ambassadors were put on trial and then executed by throwing them in a pit; in Sparta, they were simply thrown down a well.&lt;ref name = h178/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.133.1 VII, 133]&lt;/ref&gt; This meant that Sparta was also effectively at war with Persia.&lt;ref name = h178/&gt;

Darius thus put together an amphibious task force under [[Datis]] and [[Artaphernes (son of Artaphernes)|Artaphernes]] in 490 BC, which [[Siege of Naxos (490 BC)|attacked Naxos]], before receiving the submission of the other [[Cyclades|Cycladic Islands]]. The task force then moved on Eretria, which it besieged and destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.100.1 VI, 101]&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, it moved to attack Athens, landing at the bay of [[Marathon, Greece|Marathon]], where it was met by a heavily outnumbered Athenian army. At the ensuing [[Battle of Marathon]], the Athenians won a remarkable victory, which resulted in the withdrawal of the Persian army to Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+6.113 VI, 113]&lt;/ref&gt;

Darius, therefore, began raising a huge new army with which he meant to completely subjugate Greece; however, in 486 BC, his [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] subjects revolted, indefinitely postponing any Greek expedition.&lt;ref name = h203&gt;Holland, p. 203&lt;/ref&gt; Darius then died whilst preparing to march on Egypt, and the throne of Persia passed to his son Xerxes I.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 206–206&lt;/ref&gt; Xerxes crushed the Egyptian revolt and very quickly restarted the preparations for the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h208&gt;Holland, pp. 208–211&lt;/ref&gt; Since this was to be a full-scale invasion, it required long-term planning, stockpiling, and conscription.&lt;ref name = h208/&gt; Xerxes decided that the [[Hellespont]] would be bridged to allow his army to cross to Europe, and that a canal should be dug across the isthmus of [[Mount Athos]] (rounding which headland, a Persian fleet had been destroyed in 492 BC).&lt;ref name = h213/&gt; These were both feats of exceptional ambition, which would have been beyond any other contemporary state.&lt;ref name = h213&gt;Holland, pp. 213–214&lt;/ref&gt; By early 480 BC, the preparations were complete, and the army which Xerxes had mustered at [[Sardis]] marched towards Europe, crossing the Hellespont on two [[pontoon bridge]]s.&lt;ref name=VII35&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.35.1|title=VII, 35|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Herodotus, Xerxes' army was so large that, upon arriving at the banks of the Echeidorus River, his soldiers proceeded to drink it dry. In the face of such imposing numbers, many Greek cities capitulated to the Persian demand for a tribute of earth and water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Jeremy|year=2016|title="They Died the Spartan’s Death"|url=|journal=Thermopylae, theAlamo, and the Mirrors of Classical Analogy, Advances in the History of Rhetoric.|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Athenians had also been preparing for war with the Persians since the mid-480s BC, and in 482 BC the decision was taken, under the guidance of the Athenian politician [[Themistocles]], to build a massive fleet of [[trireme]]s that would be essential for the Greeks to fight the Persians.&lt;ref name = h217&gt;Holland, p. 217–223&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Athenians lacked the manpower to fight on both land and sea; therefore, combating the Persians would require an alliance of Greek city-states. In 481 BC, Xerxes sent ambassadors around Greece requesting "earth and water" but very deliberately omitting Athens and Sparta.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.32.1 VII, 32]&lt;/ref&gt; Support thus began to coalesce around these two leading states. A congress of city-states met at [[Corinth]] in late autumn of 481 BC,&lt;ref name=VII145&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.145.1 VII, 145]&lt;/ref&gt; and a confederate alliance of [[History of Greece|Greek city-states]] was formed. It had the power to send envoys to request assistance and dispatch troops from the member states to defensive points, after joint consultation. This was remarkable for the disjointed Greek world, especially since many of the city-states in attendance were still technically at war with each other.&lt;ref name = h226&gt;Holland, p. 226&lt;/ref&gt;

The "congress" met again in the spring of 480 BC. A [[Thessaly|Thessalian]] delegation suggested that the Greeks could muster in the narrow [[Vale of Tempe]], on the borders of Thessaly, and thereby block Xerxes' advance.&lt;ref name = h248&gt;Holland, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt; A force of 10,000 [[hoplite]]s was dispatched to the Vale of Tempe, through which they believed the Persian army would have to pass. However, once there, being warned by [[Alexander I of Macedon]] that the vale could be bypassed through Sarantoporo Pass and that Xerxes' army was overwhelming, the Greeks retreated.&lt;ref name=VII173&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.173.1 VII, 173]&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, they received the news that Xerxes had crossed the Hellespont.&lt;ref name = h248/&gt;

Themistocles, therefore, suggested a second strategy to the Greeks: the route to southern Greece (Boeotia, Attica, and the Peloponnesus) would require Xerxes' army to travel through the very narrow pass of [[Thermopylae]], which could easily be blocked by the Greek hoplites, despite the overwhelming numbers of Persians.&lt;ref name = h255&gt;Holland, pp. 255–257&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, to prevent the Persians from bypassing Thermopylae by sea, the Athenian and allied navies could block the straits of Artemisium. Congress adopted this dual-pronged strategy.&lt;ref name = h255&gt;Holland, pp. 255–257&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Peloponnesian cities made fall-back plans to defend the [[Isthmus of Corinth]], should it come to that, whilst the women and children of Athens had been evacuated ''en masse'' to the Peloponnesian city of [[Troezen]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.40.1 VIII, 40]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prelude==
[[File:Thermopylae &amp; Artemisium campaign map.png|thumb|350px|right|Map showing Greek and Persian advances to [[Thermopylae]] and [[Artemisium]]]]
The Persian army seems to have made slow progress through Thrace and Macedon. News of the imminent Persian approach eventually reached Greece in August thanks to a Greek spy.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 255–256&lt;/ref&gt; At this time of year the Spartans, ''de facto'' military leaders of the alliance, were celebrating the festival of [[Carneia]]. During the Carneia, military activity was forbidden by Spartan law; the Spartans had arrived too late at [[Battle of Marathon|the Battle of Marathon]] because of this requirement.&lt;ref name=VII206&gt;[[Herodotus]] [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:7.205 VII, 206]&lt;/ref&gt; It was also the time of the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]], and therefore the Olympic truce, and thus it would have been doubly sacrilegious for the whole Spartan army to march to war.&lt;ref name=VII206/&gt;&lt;ref name = h258&gt;Holland, pp. 258–259.&lt;/ref&gt; On this occasion, the [[ephor]]s decided the urgency was sufficiently great to justify an advance expedition to block the pass, under one of its kings, [[Leonidas I]]. Leonidas took with him the 300 men of the royal bodyguard, the ''Hippeis''.&lt;ref name=VII205/&gt; This expedition was to try to gather as many other Greek soldiers along the way as possible and to await the arrival of the main Spartan army.&lt;ref name = h258/&gt;

The legend of Thermopylae, as told by Herodotus, has it that the Spartans had consulted the [[Oracle at Delphi]] earlier in the year. The Oracle is said to have made the following [[prophecy]]:&lt;blockquote&gt;
''O ye men who dwell in the streets of broad Lacedaemon!'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Honor the festival of the Carneia!! Otherwise,'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Either your glorious town shall be sacked by the children of [[Perseus]],'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Or, in exchange, must all through the whole [[Laconia]]n country'' &lt;br /&gt;
''Mourn for the loss of a king, descendant of great [[Heracles]]''.&lt;ref name=VII242&gt;Rawlinson translation of Herodotus [http://www.greektexts.com/library/Herodotus/Polymnia/eng/242.html VII, 242]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Herodotus tells us that Leonidas, in line with the prophecy, was convinced he was going to certain death since his forces were not adequate for a victory, and so he selected only Spartans with living sons.&lt;ref name = VII205&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.205.1 VII, 205]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Spartan force was reinforced ''en route'' to Thermopylae by contingents from various cities and numbered more than 7,000 by the time it arrived at the pass.&lt;ref name = VII202/&gt; Leonidas chose to camp at, and defend, the "middle gate", the narrowest part of the pass of Thermopylae, where the [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocians]] had built a defensive wall some time before.&lt;ref name = VII176/&gt; News also reached Leonidas, from the nearby city of [[Trachis]], that there was a mountain track that could be used to outflank the pass of Thermopylae. Leonidas stationed 1,000 Phocians on the heights to prevent such a manoeuvre.&lt;ref name = VII217&gt;Herodotus [http://data.perseus.org/citations/urn:cts:greekLit:tlg0016.tlg001.perseus-eng1:7.217 VII, 217]&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, in mid-August, the Persian army was sighted across the [[Malian Gulf]] approaching Thermopylae.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, pp. 269–270&lt;/ref&gt; With the Persian army's arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war.&lt;ref name = VII207/&gt; Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the [[Isthmus of Corinth]] and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus.&lt;ref name = VII207/&gt; The [[Phocis (ancient region)|Phocians]] and [[Locris|Locrians]], whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas calmed the panic and agreed to defend Thermopylae.&lt;ref name=VII207&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.207.1 VII, 207]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Plutarch]], when one of the soldiers complained that, "Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun", Leonidas replied, "Won't it be nice, then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?"&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Plutarch/Moralia/Sayings_of_Spartans*/main.html Apophthegmata Laconica], section "Leonidas, son of Anaxandridas", saying 6, Vol. III of the Loeb Classical Library edition, 1931&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus reports a similar comment, but attributes it to [[Dienekes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/cla/hh/hh7220.htm|title=Herodotus Book 7: Polymnia, 226|publisher=Sacred-texts.com|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Xerxes sent a Persian emissary to negotiate with Leonidas. The Greeks were offered their freedom, the title "Friends of the Persian People", and the opportunity to re-settle on land better than that they possessed.&lt;ref name = h270&gt;Holland, pp. 270–271&lt;/ref&gt; When Leonidas refused these terms, the ambassador carried a written message by Xerxes, asking him to "Hand over your arms". Leonidas' famous response to the Persians was ''"[[Molon labe|Molṑn labé]]"'' ({{lang|grc|[[Molon labe|Μολὼν λαβέ]]}} - literally, "having come, take [them]", but usually translated as "come and take them").&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, section "Leonidas, son of Anaxandridas", saying 11&lt;/ref&gt; With the Persian embassy returning empty-handed, battle became inevitable. Xerxes delayed for four days, waiting for the Greeks to disperse, before sending troops to attack them.&lt;ref name="VII210"/&gt;

==Opposing forces==

The number of troops which Xerxes mustered for the second invasion of Greece has been the subject of endless dispute, most notably between ancient sources, which report very large numbers, and modern scholars, who surmise much smaller figures. Herodotus claimed that there were, in total, 2.6 million military personnel, accompanied by an equivalent number of support personnel.&lt;ref name=VII186&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.186 VII, 186]&lt;/ref&gt; The poet [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], who was a near-contemporary, talks of four million; [[Ctesias]] gave 800,000 as the total number of the army that was assembled by Xerxes.&lt;ref name = ctes&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livius.org/ct-cz/ctesias/photius_persica2.html|title=Photius' excerpt of Ctesias' Persica|publisher=Livius.org|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern scholars tend to reject the figures given by Herodotus and other ancient sources as unrealistic, resulting from miscalculations or exaggerations on the part of the victors.&lt;ref name = h237&gt;Holland, p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; Modern scholarly estimates are generally in the range 120,000–300,000.&lt;ref name="Holland, p. 394"&gt;Holland, p. 394.&lt;/ref&gt;{{cref|b}} These estimates usually come from studying the logistical capabilities of the Persians in that era, the sustainability of their respective bases of operations, and the overall manpower constraints affecting them. Whatever the real numbers were, however, it is clear that Xerxes was anxious to ensure a successful expedition by mustering an overwhelming numerical superiority by land and by sea.&lt;ref name=souza&gt;de Souza, p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;
The number of Persian troops present at Thermopylae is therefore as uncertain as the number for the total invasion force. For instance, it is unclear whether the whole Persian army marched as far as Thermopylae, or whether Xerxes left garrisons in Macedon and Thessaly.

Notes:
*The number of Peloponnesians
[[File:Hoplite 5th century.jpg|thumb|5th century [[hoplite]].]]
:Diodorus suggests that there were 1,000 [[Laconia|Lacedemonians]] and 3,000 other Peloponnesians, totalling 4,000. Herodotus agrees with this figure in one passage, quoting an inscription by [[Simonides]] saying there were 4,000 Peloponnesians.&lt;ref name = VII228&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.228.1 VII, 228]&lt;/ref&gt; However, elsewhere, in the passage summarized by the above table, Herodotus tallies 3,100 Peloponnesians at Thermopylae before the battle.&lt;ref name = VII202/&gt; Herodotus also reports that at Xerxes' public showing of the dead, "helots were also there for them to see",&lt;ref name = VIII25&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.25.1 VIII, 25]&lt;/ref&gt; but he does not say how many or in what capacity they served. Thus, the difference between his two figures can be squared by supposing (without proof) that there were 900 helots (three per Spartan) present at the battle.&lt;ref name = "Macan"&gt;Macan, note to Herodotus VIII, 25&lt;/ref&gt; If helots were present at the battle, there is no reason to doubt that they served in their traditional role as armed retainers to individual Spartans. Alternatively, Herodotus' "missing" 900 troops might have been [[Perioeci]], and could therefore correspond to Diodorus' 1,000 Lacedemonians.&lt;ref name = "Macan"/&gt;
*The number of Lacedemonians
:Further confusing the issue is Diodorus' ambiguity about whether his count of 1,000 Lacedemonians included the 300 Spartans. At one point he says: "Leonidas, when he received the appointment, announced that only one thousand men should follow him on the campaign".&lt;ref name=dsXI4/&gt; However, he then says: "There were, then, of the Lacedemonians one thousand, and with them three hundred Spartiates".&lt;ref name=dsXI4/&gt; It is therefore impossible to be clearer on this point.

[[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' account agrees with that of Herodotus (whom he probably read) except that he gives the number of Locrians, which Herodotus declined to estimate. Residing in the direct path of the Persian advance, they gave all the fighting men they had - according to Pausanias 6,000 men - which added to Herodotus' 5,200 would have given a force of 11,200.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+10.20.1 X, 20]&lt;/ref&gt;

Many modern historians, who usually consider Herodotus more reliable,&lt;ref name=Green&gt;Green, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; add the 1,000 Lacedemonians and the 900 helots to Herodotus' 5,200 to obtain 7,100 or about 7,000 men as a standard number, neglecting Diodorus' Melians and Pausanias' Locrians.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = russel&gt;Bury, pp. 271–282&lt;/ref&gt; However, this is only one approach, and many other combinations are plausible. Furthermore, the numbers changed later on in the battle when most of the army retreated and only approximately 3,000 men remained (300 Spartans, 700 Thespians, 400 Thebans, possibly up to 900 helots, and 1,000 Phocians stationed above the pass, less the casualties sustained in the previous days).&lt;ref name=Green/&gt;

==Strategic and tactical considerations==
[[File:Nicolo arena battleofthermopylae.svg|thumb|250px|A flow map of the battle]]
From a strategic point of view, by defending Thermopylae, the Greeks were making the best possible use of their forces.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; As long as they could prevent a further Persian advance into Greece, they had no need to seek a decisive battle and could, thus, remain on the defensive. Moreover, by defending two constricted passages (Thermopylae and Artemisium), the Greeks' inferior numbers became less of a factor.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; Conversely, for the Persians the problem of supplying such a large army meant they could not remain in the same place for very long.&lt;ref name = h285&gt;Holland, pp. 285–287&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians, therefore, had to retreat or advance, and advancing required forcing the pass of Thermopylae.&lt;ref name = h285/&gt;

Tactically, the pass at Thermopylae was ideally suited to the Greek style of warfare.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; A [[hoplite]] [[phalanx formation|phalanx]] could block the narrow pass with ease, with no risk of being outflanked by cavalry. Moreover, in the pass, the phalanx would have been very difficult to assault for the more lightly armed Persian infantry.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; The major weak point for the Greeks was the mountain track which led across the highland parallel to Thermopylae, that could allow their position to be outflanked. Although probably unsuitable for cavalry, this path could easily be traversed by the Persian infantry (many of whom were versed in [[mountain warfare]]).&lt;ref name = h288&gt;Holland, p 288&lt;/ref&gt; Leonidas was made aware of this path by local people from [[Trachis]], and he positioned a detachment of Phocian troops there in order to block this route.&lt;ref name = h262&gt;Holland, pp. 262–264&lt;/ref&gt;

===Topography of the battlefield===
[[File:Thermopylae map 480bc.png|thumb|250px|Map of Thermopylae area with modern shoreline and reconstructed shoreline of 480 BC.]]

It is often claimed that at the time, the pass of Thermopylae consisted of a track along the shore of the Malian Gulf so narrow that only one chariot could pass through at a time.&lt;ref name="VII176" /&gt; In fact, as noted below, the pass was 100 metres wide, probably wider than the Greeks could have held against the Persian masses. Herodotus reports that the Phocians had improved the defences of the pass by channelling the stream from the hot springs to create a marsh, and it was a causeway across this marsh which was only wide enough for a single chariot to traverse. In a later passage, describing a Gaulish attempt to force the pass, Herodotus states "The cavalry on both sides proved useless, as the ground at the Pass is not only narrow, but also smooth because of the natural rock, while most of it is slippery owing to its being covered with streams...the losses of the barbarians it was impossible to discover exactly. For the number of them that disappeared beneath the mud was great."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0160%3Abook%3D10%3Achapter%3D21&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also said that on the southern side of the track stood cliffs that overlooked the pass. However, a glance at any photograph of the pass shows there are no cliffs, only steep slopes covered in thorny bushes and trees. Although no obstacle to individuals, such terrain would not be passable by an army and its baggage train.{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}}

On the north side of the roadway was the [[Malian Gulf]], into which the land shelved gently. When at a later date, an army of Gauls led by [[Brennus (3rd century BC)|Brennus]] attempted to force the pass, the shallowness of the water gave the Greek fleet great difficulty getting close enough to the fighting to bombard the Gauls with ship-borne missile weapons.

Along the path itself was a series of three constrictions, or "gates" (''pylai''), and at the centre gate a wall that had been erected by the Phocians, in the previous century, to aid in their defence against [[Thessalian]] invasions.&lt;ref name="VII176"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.176.1 VII, 176]&lt;/ref&gt; The name "Hot Gates" comes from the [[hot spring]]s that were located there.&lt;ref name="VIII201"&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.201.1 VIII, 201]&lt;/ref&gt;

The terrain of the battlefield was nothing that [[Xerxes I|Xerxes]] and his forces were accustomed to. Although coming from a mountainous country, the Persians were not prepared for the real nature of the country they had invaded. The pure ruggedness of this area is caused by torrential downpours for four months of the year, combined with an intense summer season of scorching heat that cracks the ground. Vegetation is scarce and consists of low, thorny shrubs. The hillsides along the pass are covered in thick brush, with some plants reaching {{convert|10|ft|m}} high. With the sea on one side and steep, impassable hills on the other, King Leonidas and his men chose the perfect topographical position to battle the Persian invaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Battle For The West: Thermopylae |last=Bradford |first=Ernle |publisher=McGraw-Hill Book Company |year=1980 |isbn=0-07-007062-8 |location=New York |pages=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, the pass is not near the sea, but is several kilometres inland because of [[Sedimentation#Geology|sedimentation]] in the Malian Gulf.

On the fifth day after the Persian arrival at Thermopylae and the first day of the battle, Xerxes finally resolved to attack the Greeks. First, he ordered 5,000 archers to fire a barrage of arrows, but they were ineffective; they fired from at least 100 yards away, according to modern day scholars, and the Greeks' bronze shields and helmets deflected the arrows. After that, Xerxes sent a force of 10,000 [[Medes]] and [[Khuzistan|Cissians]] to take the defenders prisoner and bring them before him.&lt;ref name=VII210&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.210.1 VII, 210]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dsIX9"&gt;Diodorus Siculus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.6.1 XI, 6]&lt;/ref&gt; The Persians soon launched a [[frontal assault]], in waves of around 10,000 men, on the Greek position.&lt;ref name=VII210/&gt; The Greeks fought in front of the Phocian wall, at the narrowest part of the pass, which enabled them to use as few soldiers as possible.&lt;ref name=VII208&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.208.1 VII, 208]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = VII223/&gt; Details of the tactics are scant; Diodorus says, "the men stood shoulder to shoulder", and the Greeks were "superior in valour and in the great size of their shields."&lt;ref name=dsXI7&gt;Diodorus Siculus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Diod.+11.7.1 XI, 7]&lt;/ref&gt; This probably describes the standard Greek phalanx, in which the men formed a wall of overlapping shields and layered spear points protruding out from the sides of the shields, which would have been highly effective as long as it spanned the width of the pass.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; The weaker shields, and shorter spears and swords of the Persians prevented them from effectively engaging the Greek hoplites.&lt;ref name=dsXI7/&gt;&lt;ref name=VII211&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.211.1 VII, 211]&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus says that the units for each city were kept together; units were rotated in and out of the battle to prevent fatigue, which implies the Greeks had more men than necessary to block the pass.&lt;ref name=VII204&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.208.1 VII, 204]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greeks killed so many Medes that Xerxes is said to have stood up three times from the seat from which he was watching the battle.&lt;ref name=VII212&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.212.1 VII, 212]&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ctesias]], the first wave was "cut to ribbons", with only two or three Spartans killed in return.&lt;ref name = ctes/&gt;

According to Herodotus and Diodorus, the king, having taken the measure of the enemy, threw his best troops into a second assault the same day, the [[Persian Immortals|Immortals]], an elite corps of 10,000 men.&lt;ref name=dsXI7/&gt;&lt;ref name=VII211/&gt; However, the Immortals fared no better than the Medes, and failed to make any headway against the Greeks.&lt;ref name=VII211/&gt; The Spartans apparently used a tactic of feigning retreat, and then turning and killing the enemy troops when they ran after them.&lt;ref name=VII211/&gt;

===Second day===
[[File:Greek Phalanx.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Greek [[phalanx formation]] based on sources from the [[Perseus Project]]]]
On the second day, Xerxes again sent in the infantry to attack the pass, "supposing that their enemies, being so few, were now disabled by wounds and could no longer resist."&lt;ref name=VII212/&gt; However, the Persians had no more success on the second day than on the first.&lt;ref name=VII212/&gt; Xerxes at last stopped the assault and withdrew to his camp, "totally perplexed".&lt;ref name =ctes/&gt;

Later that day, however, as the Persian king was pondering what to do next, he received a windfall; a [[Trachis|Trachinian]] named [[Ephialtes of Trachis|Ephialtes]] informed him of the mountain path around Thermopylae and offered to guide the Persian army.&lt;ref name = VII213/&gt; Ephialtes was motivated by the desire for a reward.&lt;ref name = VII213&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.213.1 VII, 213]&lt;/ref&gt; For this act, the name "Ephialtes" received a lasting stigma; it came to mean "nightmare" in the Greek language and to symbolize the archetypal traitor in Greek culture.&lt;ref&gt;Tegopoulos, entry for Εφιάλτης&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battle of Thermopylae.pdf|thumb|The flank exposed by Ephialtes]]
Herodotus reports that Xerxes sent his commander [[Hydarnes]] that evening, with the men under his command, the Immortals, to encircle the Greeks via the path. However, he does not say who those men were.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.215.1 VII, 215]&lt;/ref&gt; The Immortals had been bloodied on the first day, so it is possible that Hydarnes may have been given overall command of an enhanced force including what was left of the Immortals; according to Diodorus, Hydarnes had a force of 20,000 for the mission.&lt;ref&gt;Green (2006), p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; The path led from east of the Persian camp along the ridge of Mt. Anopaea behind the cliffs that flanked the pass. It branched, with one path leading to Phocis and the other down to the Malian Gulf at Alpenus, the first town of [[Locris]].&lt;ref name=VII217/&gt;

===Third day===
[[File:Leónidas en las Termópilas, por Jacques-Louis David.jpg|thumb|305px|''Leonidas at Thermopylae'', by [[Jacques-Louis David]], 1814. This is a juxtaposition of various historical and legendary elements from the Battle of Thermopylae.]]

At daybreak on the third day, the Phocians guarding the path above Thermopylae became aware of the outflanking Persian column by the rustling of oak leaves. Herodotus says they jumped up and were greatly amazed.&lt;ref name=VII218&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.218.1 VII, 218]&lt;/ref&gt; Hydarnes was perhaps just as amazed to see them hastily arming themselves as they were to see him and his forces.&lt;ref name = h291&gt;Holland, p. 291–293&lt;/ref&gt; He feared they were Spartans but was informed by Ephialtes that they were not.&lt;ref name=VII218/&gt; The Phocians retreated to a nearby hill to make their stand (assuming the Persians had come to attack them).&lt;ref name=VII218/&gt; However, not wishing to be delayed, the Persians merely shot a volley of arrows at them, before bypassing them to continue with their [[encirclement]] of the main Greek force.&lt;ref name=VII218/&gt;

Learning from a runner that the Phocians had not held the path, Leonidas called a [[council of war]] at dawn.&lt;ref name = VII219/&gt; According to Diodorus, a Persian called Tyrrhastiadas, a Cymaean by birth, warned the Greeks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0084%3Abook%3D11%3Achapter%3D8%3Asection%3D5 |title=Diodorus Siculus, Library, Book XI, Chapter 8, section 5 |accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the Greeks argued for withdrawal, but Leonidas resolved to stay at the pass with the Spartans.&lt;ref name = VII219/&gt; Upon discovering that his army had been encircled, Leonidas told his allies that they could leave if they wanted to. While many of the Greeks took him up on his offer and fled, around two thousand soldiers stayed behind to fight and die. Knowing that the end was near, the Greeks marched into the open field and met the Persians head-on. Many of the Greek contingents then either chose to withdraw (without orders) or were ordered to leave by Leonidas (Herodotus admits that there is some doubt about which actually happened).&lt;ref name = VII219&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.219.1 VII, 219]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.220.1 VII, 220]&lt;/ref&gt; The contingent of 700 [[Thespiae|Thespians]], led by their general [[Demophilus (Thespiae)|Demophilus]], refused to leave and committed themselves to the fight.&lt;ref name=VII222&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.222.1 VII, 222]&lt;/ref&gt; Also present were the 400 Thebans and probably the [[helot]]s who had accompanied the Spartans.&lt;ref name = h291/&gt;

Leonidas' actions have been the subject of much discussion. It is commonly stated that the Spartans were obeying the laws of Sparta by not retreating, but it seems it was actually the failure to retreat from Thermopylae that gave rise to the notion that Spartans never retreated.&lt;ref name = L144&gt;Lazenby, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; It is also possible that, recalling the words of the Oracle, Leonidas was committed to sacrifice his life in order to save Sparta. However, since the prophecy was specific to him, this seems a poor reason to commit 1,500 other men to a fight to the death.&lt;ref name = L144/&gt;

[[File:Leonidas at Thermopylae.jpg|thumb|Statue of Spartan king [[Leonidas]] at the Thermopylae.]]
The most likely theory is that Leonidas chose to form a rearguard so that the other Greek contingents could get away.&lt;ref name = L144/&gt;&lt;ref name = h294/&gt; If all the troops had retreated, the open ground beyond the pass would have allowed the Persian cavalry to run the Greeks down. If they had all remained at the pass, they would have been encircled and would eventually have all been killed.&lt;ref name = h291/&gt; By covering the retreat and continuing to block the pass, Leonidas could save more than 3,000 men, who would be able to fight again.&lt;ref name = h294/&gt;

The Thebans have also been the subject of some discussion. Herodotus suggests they were brought to the battle as hostages to ensure the good behavior of Thebes.&lt;ref name = VII205/&gt; However, as Plutarch long ago pointed out, if they were hostages, why not send them away with the rest of the Greeks?&lt;ref name = L144/&gt; The likelihood is that these were the Theban "loyalists", who unlike the majority of their fellow citizens, objected to Persian domination.&lt;ref name = L144/&gt; They thus probably came to Thermopylae of their own free will and stayed to the end because they could not return to Thebes if the Persians conquered Boeotia.&lt;ref name = h291/&gt; The Thespians, resolved as they were not to submit to Xerxes, faced the destruction of their city if the Persians took Boeotia.&lt;ref name = L144/&gt;

However, this alone does not explain the fact that they remained; the remainder of Thespiae was successfully evacuated before the Persians arrived there.&lt;ref name = L144/&gt; It seems that the Thespians volunteered to remain as a simple act of self-sacrifice, all the more amazing since their contingent represented every single hoplite the city could muster.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, pp. 259–260&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to have been a particularly Thespian trait – on at least two other occasions in later history, a Thespian force would commit itself to a fight to the death.&lt;ref name = L144/&gt;

At dawn, Xerxes made [[libation]]s, pausing to allow the Immortals sufficient time to descend the mountain, and then began his advance.&lt;ref name=VII223&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.223.1 VII, 223]&lt;/ref&gt; A Persian force of 10,000 men, comprising light infantry and cavalry, charged at the front of the Greek formation. The Greeks this time sallied forth from the wall to meet the Persians in the wider part of the pass, in an attempt to slaughter as many Persians as they could.&lt;ref name=VII223/&gt; They fought with spears, until every spear was shattered, and then switched to ''[[xiphos|xiphē]]'' (short swords).&lt;ref name=VII224/&gt; In this struggle, Herodotus states that two of Xerxes' brothers fell: [[Abrocomes]] and [[Hyperanthes]].&lt;ref name=VII224/&gt; Leonidas also died in the assault, shot down by Persian archers, and the two sides fought over his body; the Greeks took possession.&lt;ref name=VII224&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.224.1 VII, 224]&lt;/ref&gt; As the Immortals approached, the Greeks withdrew and took a stand on a hill behind the wall.&lt;ref name=VII225/&gt; The Thebans "moved away from their companions, and with hands upraised, advanced toward the barbarians..." (Rawlinson translation), but a few were slain before their surrender was accepted.&lt;ref name=VII225/&gt; The king later had the Theban prisoners branded with the royal mark.&lt;ref name=VII233&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.233.1 VII 233]&lt;/ref&gt; Of the remaining defenders, Herodotus says: &lt;blockquote&gt; "Here they defended themselves to the last, those who still had swords using them, and the others resisting with their hands and teeth."&lt;ref name=VII225&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.225.1 VII, 225]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Tearing down part of the wall, Xerxes ordered the hill surrounded, and the Persians rained down arrows until every last Greek was dead.&lt;ref name=VII225/&gt; In 1939, archaeologist [[Spyridon Marinatos]], excavating at Thermopylae, found large numbers of Persian bronze arrowheads on [[Kolonos Hill]], which changed the identification of the hill on which the Greeks were thought to have died from a smaller one nearer the wall.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, p. 302&lt;/ref&gt;

The pass at Thermopylae was thus opened to the Persian army, according to Herodotus, at the cost to the Persians of up to 20,000 fatalities.&lt;ref name = VIII24&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.23.1 VIII, 24]&lt;/ref&gt; The Greek rearguard, meanwhile, was annihilated, with a probable loss of 2,000 men, including those killed on the first two days of battle.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 397&lt;/ref&gt; Herodotus says, at one point 4,000 Greeks died, but assuming the Phocians guarding the track were not killed during the battle (as Herodotus implies), this would be almost every Greek soldier present (by Herodotus' own estimates), and this number is probably too high.&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
{{Main|Second Persian invasion of Greece}}
[[File:Xerxes I tomb Persian soldier circa 480 BCE.jpg|thumb|upright|A Persian soldier at the time of the Second Persian invasion of Greece.]]
When the Persians recovered Leonidas' body, Xerxes, in a rage against Leonidas, ordered that the head be cut off and the body [[crucifixion|crucified]]. Herodotus observes this was very uncommon for the Persians, as they traditionally treated "valiant warriors" with great honour (the example of Pytheas, captured off [[Skiathos]] before the [[Battle of Artemisium]], strengthens this suggestion).&lt;ref name=VII225/&gt;&lt;ref name=VII181&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.181.1 VII, 181]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Xerxes was known for his rage. Legend has it that he had the very water of the [[Dardanelles|Hellespont]] whipped because it would not obey him.&lt;ref name=VII35/&gt;

After the Persians' departure, the Greeks collected their dead and buried them on the hill. After the Persian invasion was repulsed, a stone lion was erected at Thermopylae to commemorate Leonidas.&lt;ref name=VII238&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.238.1 VII, 238]&lt;/ref&gt; A full 40 years after the battle, Leonidas' bones were returned to Sparta, where he was buried again with full honours; funeral games were held every year in his memory.&lt;ref name="VII224"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+3.14 III, 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

With Thermopylae now opened to the Persian army, the continuation of the blockade at Artemisium by the Greek fleet became irrelevant. The simultaneous naval Battle of Artemisium had been a tactical stalemate, and the Greek navy was able to retreat in good order to the [[Saronic Gulf]], where they helped to ferry the remaining Athenian citizens to the island of [[Salamis Island|Salamis]].&lt;ref name = h294&gt;Holland, p. 294&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Thermopylae, the Persian army proceeded to sack and burn [[Plataea]] and [[Thespiae]], the Boeotian cities that had not submitted, before it marched on the now evacuated city of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.49.1 VIII, 50]&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the Greeks (for the most part Peloponnesians) preparing to defend the Isthmus of [[Corinth]], demolished the single road that led through it and built a wall across it.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.72.1 VIII, 71]&lt;/ref&gt; As at Thermopylae, making this an effective strategy required the Greek navy to stage a simultaneous blockade, barring the passage of the Persian navy across the [[Saronic Gulf]], so that troops could not be landed directly on the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name = h299&gt;Holland, pp. 299–303&lt;/ref&gt; However, instead of a mere blockade, Themistocles persuaded the Greeks to seek a decisive victory against the Persian fleet. Luring the Persian navy into the Straits of Salamis, the Greek fleet was able to destroy much of the Persian fleet in the [[Battle of Salamis]], which essentially ended the threat to the Peloponnese.&lt;ref name = h327&gt;Holland, pp. 327–334&lt;/ref&gt;

Fearing the Greeks might attack the bridges across the Hellespont and trap his army in Europe, Xerxes now retreated with much of the Persian army back to Asia,&lt;ref name = VIII97&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.97.1 VIII, 97]&lt;/ref&gt; though nearly all of them died of starvation and disease on the return voyage.&lt;ref name = VIII115&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.115.1 VIII, 115]&lt;/ref&gt; He left a hand-picked force, under [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], to complete the conquest the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 327–329&lt;/ref&gt; However, under pressure from the Athenians, the Peloponnesians eventually agreed to try to force Mardonius to battle, and they marched on Attica.&lt;ref name = h338/&gt; Mardonius retreated to Boeotia to lure the Greeks into open terrain, and the two sides eventually met near the city of Plataea.&lt;ref name = h338&gt;Holland, pp. 338–341&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Battle of Plataea]], the Greek army won a decisive victory, destroying much of the Persian army and ending the invasion of Greece.&lt;ref name = h338/&gt; Meanwhile, at the near-simultaneous naval [[Battle of Mycale]], they also destroyed much of the remaining Persian fleet, thereby reducing the threat of further invasions.&lt;ref&gt;Holland, p. 357–359&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Xerxes detail Hidush enhanced.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[Hindush|Hidush]]'' ([[Achaemenid conquest of the Indus Valley|Indian soldier of the Achaemenid army]]), circa 480 BCE. [[Xerxes I]] tomb. Herodotus explained that Indians participated to the Second Persian invasion of Greece.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Herodotus/7B*.html VII 64-66]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Thermopylae is arguably the most famous battle in European ancient history, repeatedly referenced in ancient, recent, and [[Battle of Thermopylae in popular culture|contemporary culture]]. In Western culture at least, it is the Greeks who are lauded for their performance in battle.&lt;ref name = hxviii&gt;Holland, p. ''xviii''.&lt;/ref&gt; However, within the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae was undoubtedly a defeat for the Greeks.&lt;ref name="Lazenby, p. 151"&gt;Lazenby, p. 151.&lt;/ref&gt; It seems clear that the Greek strategy was to hold off the Persians at Thermopylae and Artemisium;&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; whatever they may have intended, it was presumably not their desire to surrender all of Boeotia and Attica to the Persians.&lt;ref name = L248/&gt; The Greek position at Thermopylae, despite being massively outnumbered, was nearly impregnable.&lt;ref name = h294/&gt; If the position had been held for even a little longer, the Persians might have had to retreat for lack of food and water.&lt;ref name = h285/&gt; Thus, despite the heavy losses, forcing the pass was strategically a Persian victory,&lt;ref name = h294/&gt; but the successful retreat of the bulk of the Greek troops was in its own sense a victory as well. The battle itself had showed what a few free men, willing to do anything for victory against the invaders, could accomplish, and the defeat at Thermopylae had turned Leonidas and the men under his command into martyrs. That boosted the morale of all Greek soldiers in the second Persian invasion.&lt;ref name = h294/&gt;

It is sometimes stated that Thermopylae was a [[Pyrrhic victory]] for the Persians&lt;ref name="Tung &amp; Tung, p. 239"&gt;Tung &amp; Tung, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Marozzi, p. 74"&gt;Marozzi, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., one in which the victor is as damaged by the battle as the defeated party). However, there is no suggestion by Herodotus that the effect on the Persian forces was that. The idea ignores the fact that the Persians would, in the aftermath of Thermopylae, conquer the majority of Greece,&lt;ref name = Cawk105&gt;Cawkwell, pp. 105–106&lt;/ref&gt; and the fact that they were still fighting in Greece a year later.&lt;ref name = IX1&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+9.1.1 IX, 1]&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, the argument is sometimes advanced that the last stand at Thermopylae was a successful delaying action that gave the Greek navy time to prepare for the Battle of Salamis.{{cref|c}} However, compared to the probable time (about one month) between Thermopylae and Salamis, the time bought was negligible.&lt;ref name = hnet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6 |title=Greco-Persian Wars: Battle of Thermopylae |publisher=HistoryNet |accessdate=27 March 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090228234109/http://www.historynet.com/greco-persian-wars-battle-of-thermopylae.htm/6| archivedate= 28 February 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, this idea also neglects the fact that a Greek navy was fighting at Artemisium during the Battle of Thermopylae, incurring losses in the process.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.1.1 VIII, 1–19]&lt;/ref&gt; [[George Cawkwell]] suggests that the gap between Thermopylae and Salamis was caused by Xerxes' systematically reducing Greek opposition in Phocis and Boeotia, and not as a result of the Battle of Thermopylae; thus, as a delaying action, Thermopylae was insignificant compared to Xerxes' own procrastination.&lt;ref name = Cawk105/&gt; Far from labelling Thermopylae as a Pyrrhic victory, modern academic treatises on the Greco-Persian Wars tend to emphasise the success of Xerxes in breaching the formidable Greek position and the subsequent conquest of the majority of Greece. For instance, Cawkwell states: "he was successful on both land and sea, and the Great Invasion began with a brilliant success.
... Xerxes had every reason to congratulate himself",&lt;ref&gt;Cawkwell, p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; while Lazenby describes the Greek defeat as "disastrous".&lt;ref name="Lazenby, p. 151"/&gt;

The fame of Thermopylae is thus principally derived not from its effect on the outcome of the war but for the inspirational example it set.&lt;ref name = hnet/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lazenby, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; Thermopylae is famous because of the heroism of the doomed rearguard, who, despite facing certain death, remained at the pass.&lt;ref name="hxviii"/&gt; Ever since, the events of Thermopylae have been the source of effusive praise from many sources: "...the fairest sister-victories which the Sun has ever seen, yet they would never dare to compare their combined glory with the glorious defeat of King Leonidas and his men."&lt;ref&gt;Michel de Montaigne, quoted in Holland, p. ''xviii''.&lt;/ref&gt; A second reason is the example it set of free men, fighting for their country and their freedom:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So almost immediately, contemporary Greeks saw Thermopylae as a critical moral and culture lesson. In universal terms, a small, free people had willingly outfought huge numbers of imperial subjects who advanced under the lash. More specifically, the Western idea that soldiers themselves decide where, how, and against whom they will fight was contrasted against the Eastern notion of despotism and monarchy—freedom proving the stronger idea as the more courageous fighting of the Greeks at Thermopylae, and their later victories at Salamis and Plataea attested.&lt;ref name="hanson"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |title=Victor Hanson article |publisher=Victor Hanson article |date=11 October 2006 |accessdate=27 March 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319045718/http://www.victorhanson.com/articles/hanson101106.html |archivedate=19 March 2009 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; While this paradigm of "free men" outfighting "slaves" can be seen as a rather sweeping over-generalization (there are many counter-examples), it is nevertheless true that many commentators have used Thermopylae to illustrate this point.&lt;ref name = L248&gt;Lazenby, pp. 248–253&lt;/ref&gt;

Militarily, although the battle was actually not decisive in the context of the Persian invasion, Thermopylae is of some significance on the basis of the first two days of fighting. The performance of the defenders is used as an example of the advantages of training, equipment, and good use of terrain as [[force multiplier]]s.&lt;ref name=usarmy&gt;Eikenberry, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monuments===
There are several monuments around the battlefield of Thermopylae.

====Epitaph of Simonides====
[[File:Thermopiles memorial epitaph.jpg|right|300px|thumb|Epitaph with [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]]' epigram]]

A well-known [[epigram]], usually attributed to [[Simonides of Ceos|Simonides]], was engraved as an [[epitaph]] on a commemorative stone placed on top of the burial mound of the Spartans at Thermopylae. It is also the hill on which the last of them died.&lt;ref name="VII228" /&gt; The original stone has not survived, but in 1955, the epitaph was engraved on a new stone. The text from Herodotus is:&lt;ref name="VII228"/&gt;

:{{lang|grc|Ὦ ξεῖν', ἀγγέλλειν Λακεδαιμονίοις ὅτι τῇδε}}
:{{lang|grc|κείμεθα, τοῖς κείνων ῥήμασι πειθόμενοι}}.

:''Ō ksein', angellein Lakedaimoniois hoti tēide''
:''keimetha, tois keinōn rhēmasi peithomenoi.''

:Oh stranger, tell the Lacedaemonians that
:we lie here, obedient to their words.&lt;ref name="Ziogas"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ziogas | first = Ioannis | title = Sparse Spartan Verse: Filling Gaps in the Thermopylae Epigram | work = Ramus 43 (2) | publisher = Aureal Publications |date=9 November 2014| url = https://www.academia.edu/3387164/Sparse_Spartan_Verse_Filling_Gaps_in_the_Thermopylae_Epigram | accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The alternative ancient reading {{lang|grc|πειθόμενοι νομίμοις}} (''peithomenoi nomίmois'') for {{lang|grc|ῥήμασι πειθόμενοι}} (''rhēmasi peithomenoi'') substitutes "laws" or "orders" for "words." In other words, the "orders" are not personal but refer to official and binding phrases (the Ancient Greek term can also refer to a formal speech).&lt;ref&gt;Macan, note to Herodotus VII, 228&lt;/ref&gt;

The form of this ancient Greek poetry is an [[elegiac couplet]], commonly used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of [[Laconic phrase|Laconian brevity]], a Spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations of the meaning of the poem.&lt;ref name="Ziogas"/&gt; Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.

It was well known in ancient Greece that all the Spartans who had been sent to Thermopylae had been killed there (with the exception of [[Aristodemus of Sparta|Aristodemus]] and [[Pantites]]), and the epitaph exploits the conceit that there was nobody left to bring the news of their deeds back to Sparta. Greek epitaphs often appealed to the passing reader (always called 'stranger') for sympathy, but the epitaph for the dead Spartans at Thermopylae took this convention much further than usual, asking the reader to make a personal journey to Sparta to break the news that the Spartan expeditionary force had been wiped out. The stranger is also asked to stress that the Spartans died 'fulfilling their orders'.

The first line of the epigram was used as the title of the short story "[[Stranger, Bear Word to the Spartans We…]]" by German Nobel Prize laureate [[Heinrich Böll]]. A variant of the epigram is inscribed on the [[Polish Cemetery at Monte Cassino]].

[[John Ruskin]] expressed the importance of this ideal to [[western culture|Western civilization]] as follows:&lt;blockquote&gt;Also obedience in its highest form is not obedience to a constant and compulsory law, but a persuaded or voluntary yielded obedience to an issued command .... His name who leads the armies of Heaven is "Faithful and True"...&amp;nbsp;and all deeds which are done in alliance with these armies ... are essentially deeds of faith, which therefore ... is at once the source and the substance of all known deed, rightly so called ... as set forth in the last word of the noblest group of words ever, so far as I know, uttered by simple man concerning his practice, being the final testimony of the leaders of a great practical nation ... [the epitaph in Greek]&lt;ref name=rusk&gt;Ruskin, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Cicero]] recorded a [[Latin]] variation in his ''[[Tusculanae Disputationes]]'' (1.42.101):

:''Dic, hospes, Spartae nos te hic vidisse iacentes''
:''dum sanctis patriae legibus obsequimur.''

:Tell, stranger, to Sparta that you saw us lying here
:since we followed the sacred laws of the fatherland.&lt;ref name="Ziogas" /&gt;

====Leonidas monument====
Additionally, there is a modern monument at the site, called the "Leonidas Monument", in honour of the Spartan king. It features a bronze statue of Leonidas. A sign, under the statue, reads simply: "[[Molon labe|Μολὼν λαβέ]]" ("Come and take them!"—as in answer to Xerxes' demand that the Greeks give up their weapons). The [[metope (architecture)|metope]] below depicts battle scenes. The two marble statues on the left and the right of the monument represent, respectively, the river [[Eurotas River|Eurotas]] and Mount [[Taygetos]], famous landmarks of [[Sparta]].&lt;ref name="RingWatson2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|last2=Watson|first2=Noelle|last3=Schellinger|first3=Paul|title=Southern Europe: International Dictionary of Historic Places|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qcr9AQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA695|date=5 November 2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-25958-8|page=695}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thespian monument====
In 1997, a second monument was officially unveiled by the Greek government, dedicated to the 700 Thespians who fought with the Spartans. The monument is made of marble and features a bronze statue depicting the god [[Eros (mythology)|Eros]], to whom the ancient Thespians accorded particular [[Religion in ancient Greece|religious veneration]]. Under the statue, a sign reads: "In memory of the seven hundred Thespians."

A plate below the statue explains its symbolism:
* The headless male figure symbolizes the anonymous sacrifice of the 700 Thespians to their country.
* The outstretched chest symbolizes the struggle, the gallantry, the strength, the bravery and the courage.
* The open wing symbolizes the victory, the glory, the soul, the spirit and the freedom.
* The broken wing symbolizes the voluntary sacrifice and death.
* The naked body symbolizes Eros, the most important god of the ancient Thespians, a god of creation, beauty and life.

The monument to the Thespians is placed beside the one to the Spartans.

===Associated legends===
Herodotus' colorful account of the battle has provided history with many apocryphal incidents and conversations away from the main historical events. These accounts are obviously not verifiable, but they form an integral part of the legend of the battle and often demonstrate the [[laconic]] speech (and wit) of the Spartans to good effect.

For instance, [[Plutarch]] recounts, in his ''Sayings of Spartan Women'', upon his departure, Leonidas' wife [[Gorgo, Queen of Sparta|Gorgo]] asked what she should do if he did not return, to which Leonidas replied, "Marry a good man and have good children."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A2008.01.0197%3Achapter%3D51%3Asection%3D2 Plut. Apoph. 51.2] and Moralia, 240 E (6)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is reported that, upon arriving at Thermopylae, the Persians sent a mounted scout to reconnoitre. The Greeks allowed him to come up to the camp, observe them, and depart. Xerxes found the scout's reports of the size of the Greek force, and that the Spartans were indulging in [[calisthenics|callisthenics]] and combing their long hair, laughable. Seeking the counsel of [[Demaratus]], an exiled Spartan king in his retinue, Xerxes was told the Spartans were preparing for battle, and it was their custom to adorn their hair when they were about to risk their lives. Demaratus called them "the bravest men in Greece" and warned the Great King they intended to dispute the pass. He emphasized that he had tried to warn Xerxes earlier in the campaign, but the king had refused to believe him. He added that if Xerxes ever managed to subdue the Spartans, "there is no other nation in all the world which will venture to lift a hand in their defence."&lt;ref name=VII209&gt;Herodotus [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.209.1 VII, 209]&lt;/ref&gt;

Herodotus also describes Leonidas' reception of a Persian embassy. The ambassador told Leonidas that Xerxes would offer him the kingship of all Greece if he joined with Xerxes. Leonidas answered: "If you had any knowledge of the noble things of life, you would refrain from coveting others' possessions; but for me to die for Greece is better than to be the sole ruler over the people of my race."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Moralia, 225, saying 10&lt;/ref&gt; Then the ambassador asked him more forcefully to surrender their arms. To this Leonidas gave his famous answer: {{lang|grc|[[Molon labe|Μολὼν λαβέ]]}} (pronounced {{IPA-el|moˈlɔːn laˈbe}}) "Come and get them."&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch, Apophthegmata Laconica, Saying 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Such Laconic bravery doubtlessly helped to maintain morale. Herodotus writes that when [[Dienekes]], a Spartan soldier, was informed that Persian arrows would be so numerous as "to block out the sun", he retorted, unconcerned: "So much the better...then we shall fight our battle in the shade."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+7.226.1|title=Herodotus,  The Histories, Book 7, chapter 226, section 1|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the battle, Xerxes was curious as to what the Greeks had been trying to do (presumably because they had had so few men) and had some Arcadian deserters interrogated in his presence. The answer was: all the other men were participating in the [[Ancient Olympic Games|Olympic Games]]. When Xerxes asked what the prize was for the winner, the answer was: "an olive-wreath". Upon hearing this, [[Tigranes]], a Persian general, said: "Good heavens, [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]], what kind of men are these that you have pitted against us? It is not for riches that they contend but for honour!" (Godley translation) or otherwise, "Ye Gods, Mardonius, what men have you brought us to fight against? Men that fight not for gold, but for glory."&lt;ref name=VIII26&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Hdt.+8.26.1|title=Herodotus,'' The Histories'', Book 8, chapter 26, section 1|publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu|accessdate=26 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In popular culture===
{{main|Battle of Thermopylae in popular culture}}
The Battle of Thermopylae has remained a [[cultural icon]] of [[Western culture|western civilization]] ever since it was fought. The battle is revisited in countless [[adage]]s and works of popular culture, such as in films (e.g., ''[[The 300 Spartans]]'' (1962) and ''[[300 (film)|300]]'' (2007), based on the events during and close to the time of the battle), in literature, in song, in television programs, and in video games. The battle is also discussed in many [[Article (publishing)|articles]] and books on the theory and practice of warfare.

{{main|Sparta in popular culture}}
Prior to the battle, the [[Hellenes]] remembered the [[Dorians]], an ethnic distinction which applied to the [[Sparta]]ns, as the conquerors and displacers of the [[Ionians]] in the [[Peloponnesus]]. After the battle, Spartan culture became an inspiration and object of emulation, a phenomenon known as [[Laconophilia]].

'''Battle of the Bands''' is a [[Music competition|contest]] in which two or more [[Musical ensemble|bands]] compete for the [[title]] of "best band". The winner is determined by a [[voice vote]] of the audience or the band who brings the most people to support them. Traditionally, battles of bands are held at live music events and forums. Popular examples include the yearly [[Live and Unsigned]] contest in the [[United Kingdom]] and the annual SoundWave Music Competition. 
Nippon term "対バン (pronunciation: [taiban])" seems from battles of bands, however in most cases now it doesn't mean battles and just means 2-or-more-band live events.
==Format==
A Battle of the Bands is a [[Music competition|contest]] in which many [[Musical ensemble|bands]], usually [[Rock music|rock]] or [[Heavy metal music|metal]] bands, but often musical acts from a range of different styles, compete for the [[title]] of "best band". The winner is determined by a panel of [[judge]]s, the general response of the [[audience]], or a combination. The winning band usually receives a prize in addition to bragging rights. Prizes usually include cash, free recording time in a local recording studio, support or main slot at a local or large gig, a piece of new equipment, or a [[gift certificate]]. For instance, the band [[Phish]] won a battle of the bands competition in 1989 in their hometown of [[Burlington, Vermont]], and won recording time at a local studio, which they used to record their second album ''[[Lawn Boy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Phish ‘Lawn Boy’ Deluxe 2-LP Vinyl Available For Record Store Day |url=http://phish.com/news/phish-lawn-boy-deluxe-2-lp-vinyl-available-for-record-store-day/ |website=Phish |accessdate=23 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Battles of bands are sometimes held as part of a live music event; they are also commonly held at high schools and universities. The term "Battle of the Bands" is a [[trademark]] in Canada, held since 1998 by the Toronto promotions company Supernova Interactive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ic.gc.ca/app/opic-cipo/trdmrks/srch/vwTrdmrk.do;jsessionid=0000MAYFyL7A3r1id7YcHRYgcoV:1247nfca5?lang=eng&amp;fileNumber=0895127&amp;extension=0&amp;startingDocumentIndexOnPage=1 "Canadian Intellectual Property Office"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical incidents==
The simultaneous release of albums and singles in 1995 sparked a media-fuelled "[[The Battle of Britpop|Battle of Britpop]]" between northern England's working-class [[Oasis (band)|Oasis]] and southern England's middle-class [[Blur (band)|Blur]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Chris Roberts (author)|Chris Roberts]], Heavy Words Lightly Thrown: The Reason Behind Rhyme, Thorndike Press,2006 ({{ISBN|0-7862-8517-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; Also in the [[United Kingdom]], the largest annual music contest in a battle of the bands format is [[Live and Unsigned]], which has been operating since 2007. The contest regularly draws 10,000 participants, with the grand prize of a £50,000 recording deal.&lt;ref name="winnerseleven"&gt;{{cite news

One of the best known battle of the bands competitions in the United States was the [[Rock 'n' Roll Rumble]], held by the [[Boston]] rock radio station [[WBCN (FM)|WBCN]]. The competition was held by the station from 1979 until its closure in 2009, and was then subsequently operated by an independent group. Several winners and participants became nationally popular after appearing in the competition, including [[Mission of Burma]] (1979 participant), [['Til Tuesday]] (1983 winner), [[The Lemonheads]] (1988 participant), [[Letters to Cleo]], [[Morphine (band)|Morphine]], [[Powerman 5000]] (all 1992 participants), [[The Amazing Royal Crowns]] (1997 winner) and [[The Dresden Dolls]] (2003 winner).

==In popular culture==
A Battle of the Bands event forms the climax of a number of films, including ''[[Bandslam]]'', ''[[Blues Brothers 2000]]'', ''[[Up in Smoke]]'', ''[[School of Rock]]'', ''[[Freaky Friday (2003 film)|Freaky Friday]]'', and ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Bogus Journey]]''. In the 2012 horror thriller film ''[[House at the End of the Street]]'', starring [[Jennifer Lawrence]], there are scenes resembling Battle of the Bands.

In the mid-1960s, Battle of the Bands events became popular in Texas. The Catacombs, a popular [[Houston]] rock nightclub in what is now the [[Uptown Houston|Uptown]] area of Houston, hosted many well known groups of the era including [[Grateful Dead]], [[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]], [[Jeff Beck Group]], and [[The Mothers of Invention]]. [[Dallas]], [[Austin]], and [[San Antonio]] were also popular venues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scarletdukes.com/st/tmhou_hammondint.html |title=The Catacombs, Of Our Own - Houston Rock Clubs in the late-1960s/early-1970s| accessdate  = 2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1968, California band [[The Turtles]] released a concept album, ''[[The Turtles Present the Battle of the Bands]]'', with the band playing in different styles from [[Psychedelic music|psychedelic]] to [[surf music]] to [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]].

In the ''[[Take That]]'' musical, ''[[Never Forget (musical)|Never Forget]]'', the show centres on a tribute band working to win the "Battle of the Tribute Bands".

Third World Games have produced a ''Battle of the Bands'' card game, which takes a tongue-in-cheek look at the music business. The object is to recruit members into your band, equip them with instruments, win "gigs" and "hit singles" and earn enough "Superstar Points" to win.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thirdworldgames.com/html/botb/index.jsp Official Website for the game]&lt;/ref&gt; The game is also available for play on [[GameTable Online]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gametableonline.com/gameinfo.php?gid=4 GTO Info Page for the game] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072417/http://www.gametableonline.com/gameinfo.php?gid=4 |date=July 11, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a [[Battle of the Bands (video game)|''Battle of the Bands'' video game]] and [[Battle of the Bands (TV movie)|TV movie]]. In the [[music video game]] ''[[Guitar Hero World Tour]]'' and all games that followed, a "battle of the bands" mode is featured as an online gameplay mode.

The "battle of the bands" concept has had a heavy influence on [[reality television]]. Shows such as the [[Idol series]] and ''[[The X Factor (UK)|The X Factor]]'' borrow the basic concept of a "battle of the bands" except with individual singers instead of whole bands, combining the concept with a serial elimination format. There was a brief American series in the vein, ''[[The Next Great American Band]]'', that did use whole bands. The former South African competition '''''Rockspaaider''''' followed a battle of the bands format, where rock-bands from all over the country are given the chance to compete for the title "Rockspaaider" and a recording contract. The competition, along with the introduction of the Afrikaans music channel [[MK (channel)|MK]], resulted in the resurgence of the Afrikaans music industry, especially the rise of Afrikaans Rock.

In the 2003 film ''[[School of Rock]]'' Dewey Finn enters Battle of the Bands with his students. It happens in the musical and TV adaptation of the same name.

In the 2011 Australian film ''[[Swerve (film)|Swerve]]'', a battle of the marching bands serves as background to most of the scenes set in the small country town.

In the 2014 [[Animated cartoon|animated]] film [[My Little Pony: Equestria Girls – Rainbow Rocks|''My Little Pony: Equestria Girls - Rainbow Rocks'']], a trio of banished [[Siren (mythology)|sirens]] from [[Equestria]] arrive at Canterlot High School and quickly transform the school's upcoming musical showcase into a Battle of the Bands in order to feed on the negative energy created by pitting groups against one another.

The '''Blancpain GT Series''' is a [[sports car racing]] series organized by the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation]] (SRO) with the approval of the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA). It features [[grand tourer]] racing cars modified from production road cars complying with the FIA's GT3 regulations. The series is divided into two separate championships, the [[Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup]] and the [[Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup]]. Although the Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup is organised since 2011, the inaugural season of the Blancpain GT Series is [[2014 Blancpain GT Series|2014]], because in that year the [[FIA GT Series]] became the Blancpain Sprint Series, which is now the Blancpain GT World Challenge Europe. The series is primarily sponsored by Swiss watchmaker [[Blancpain]].

After developing their partnership, [[Blancpain]] and the [[Stéphane Ratel Organisation|SRO]] have decided that 2016 will see both the Sprint and Endurance Series further integrated into the Blancpain GT Series, putting the emphasis on the prestigious overall drivers' and manufacturers' titles causing the Sprint Series name to change from Blancpain Sprint Series to Blancpain GT Series Sprint Cup and the Endurance Series name to change from Blancpain Endurance Series to Blancpain GT Series Endurance Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=About Blancpain GT Series|url=http://www.blancpain-gt-series.com/about/blancpain-gt-series|publisher=Blancpain GT Series|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR''' ({{lang-ru|Съезд народных депутатов РСФСР}}) and since 1991 '''Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian Federation''' ({{lang-ru|Съезд народных депутатов Российской Федерации}}) was the supreme government institution in the [[Russian SFSR]] and in the [[Russian Federation]] from 16 May 1990 to 21 September 1993. Elected on 4 March 1990 for a period of five years, it was dissolved (without constitutional authority) by [[presidential decree]] during the [[Russian constitutional crisis of 1993]] and ended ''de facto'' when the [[Russian White House]] was attacked on 4 October 1993. The Congress played an important role some of the most important events in the [[history of Russia]] during this period, such as the declaration of independence of Russia from the [[USSR]] (December 1991), the rise of [[Boris Yeltsin]], and economic reforms.

==Main functions==
The Congress had the power to pass laws by majority, which must then be signed by the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR|President]] (with no right to veto until July 1991). The Congress held the ultimate power in the country (that is, power to decide on "any questions within jurisdiction of the Russian Federation") and some of the most-important powers (passage of and amendment of the [[Constitution]], approval of the [[Prime Minister of Russia]] and the holders of the highest public offices, selection of the members of the committee of constitutional supervision (judges of [[Constitutional Court]] since 1991), declaration of referendums, [[impeachment]] of the president, etc.) were exclusive powers of Congress, exercised solely by it.

==Composition==
The Congress officially consisted of 1068 deputies, most of whom were elected in the [[Russian legislative election, 1990|general election on 4 March 1990]], but the actual size varied due to several reelections and structural changes.
900 deputies were elected from the territorial regions, proportional to population;
168 more from the national-territorial regions: 64 from the 16 Autonomous Republic (four from each), 10 from the five autonomous regions (two from each), 10 from the 10 autonomous area (one from each), 84 from [[krai]]s, [[oblast]]s, and the cities of [[Moscow]] and [[Leningrad]].

A total of 1,059 deputies were elected by the beginning of the first session of the Congress on 16 May 1990.
1037 deputies were present on 21 September 1993; 938 on 4 October 1993.

Two thirds of the deputies had to be present for the Congress to meet the [[quorum]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Sessions==
Constitutionally the Congress was required to meet every year, but actually due to the turbulent events during these years it met from two to three times a year. The Congress gathered in the [[Grand Kremlin Palace]] (except Xth congress that gathered in [[Russian White House|White House]]) and held a total of ten sessions. Its last session was held after the presidential dissolution degree, and was interrupted by armed attack on the White House by forces loyal to the [[president of Russia]], [[Boris Yeltsin]].

==Supreme Soviet==
{{main|Supreme Soviet of Russia}}
The '''Supreme Soviet of RSFSR''' (later '''Supreme Soviet of Russian Federation''') was a [[legislative]] body elected by the Congress to govern between the Congressional sessions.
It consisted of 252 deputies, divided into the [[Soviet of the Republic (Supreme Soviet of Russia)|Council of the Republic]] (126 deputies) elected proportionately to the population size, and another 126 deputies from the [[Soviet of Nationalities (Supreme Soviet of Russia)|Council of Nationalities]], representing the [[federal subjects of Russia]].

===Functions===
The Supreme Soviet was entrusted with the power to pass laws, ratify treaties, assign cabinet members (until 1991) and judges, declare amnesty, and approve presidential decrees. The laws passed by Supreme Soviet were to be signed by the [[Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR|Chairman of the Presidium]] with no right to veto until July 10, 1991. Afterwards the president gained the right to a delaying veto, which could be bypassed by the Supreme Soviet through a simple majority vote. During its sessions the Supreme Soviet passed a total of 333 federal laws.

===Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet===
{{see also|Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian SFSR}}
The Chairman of the Supreme Soviet was elected by the Congress. He was the [[Head of State]] in [[Russian SFSR]] until the creation of the post of [[President of Russia]] on 10 July 1991. He signed treaties (without the right to veto), nominated candidates for the Head of Government, conducted diplomacy and signed international agreements.
From 10 July, the Chairman of the Presidium was demoted to the head of the legislative branch of government, a parliamentary [[Speaker (politics)|speaker]]. He was also the fourth in line of succession to the Presidency, after the [[Vice President]] and the [[President of the Council of Ministers]].

Chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of Russian SFSR:
* 29 May 1990 to 10 July 1991 – [[Boris Yeltsin]]
* 10 July 1991 to 29 October 1991 – [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]] (acting)
* 29 October 1991 to 4 October 1993 – [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]]

Boris Yeltsin ran for the post of Chairman as a [[CPSU]] member twice unsuccessfully, gaining 497 and 503 votes respectively, out of 531 required to be elected. The CPSU then nominated a more moderate candidate, the [[Prime Ministers of Russia|President of the Council of Ministers]], [[Alexander Vlasov (politician)|Alexander Vlasov]]. [[President of USSR]] [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] publicly spoke out against Yeltsin at the Congress session. After that, Yeltsin ran again on 29 May 1990 and gained 535 votes (50.52%), consequently becoming the leader of Russian SFSR.

On 17 March 1991 a [[Russian presidential referendum, 1991|national referendum]] was held in Russia in which 54% voted for the introduction of the post of President of RSFSR. On 12 June 1991, Boris Yeltsin won the election with 57% and became the first president. After he took office on 10 July, six election rounds in the Congress were unable to elect a new Chairman of the Presidium. On October 29, [[Ruslan Khasbulatov]] was elected with 559 votes (52.79%).

==Brief history==
* 27 October 1989 – Constitution of the RSFSR is modified (amended), Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR is created.
* 4 March 1990 – [[Russian legislative election, 1990|Nationwide election]] determines the composition of the Congress.
* 16 May 1990 – Congress starts the first session (opening of the I Congress of People's Deputies).
* 29 May 1990 – Boris Yeltsin is elected as Chairman of the Presidium by a narrow majority (50.52%)
* 12 June 1990 – The Congress passes the [[Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|declaration of sovereignty of Russia]]. This initiates the struggle for power in Moscow between the Russian and the Union governments.
* 1 December 1990 - The Democratic Russia bloc suffers its first split over the question of committing Soviet troops in the UN-mandated [[First Gulf War|war against Iraq]]. The supporters of Soviet involvement are overruled by the left wing, and resolution is passed against commitment of Soviet forces.
* 17 March 1991 – [[Russian presidential referendum, 1991|A nationwide referendum]] introduces the post of President of RSFSR. Constitution was subsequently amended by Congress on 24 May 1991 to provide fundamental legal framework for the Russian presidency.
* 12 June 1991 – Yeltsin is [[Russian presidential election, 1991|elected]] President of RSFSR with 57% votes. On 10 July 1991 he is sworn into office at Fifth &lt;nowiki&gt;[session of the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Congress of People's Deputies of the Russian SFSR.
* 17 July 1991 – The Congress fails to elect the new Chairman, consequently Vice-Chairman Ruslan Khasbulatov becomes the acting Chairman of the Presidium.
* 29 October 1991 – Ruslan Khasbulatov is elected as Chairman with 52.79% votes.
* 1 November 1991 – The Congress delegates extraordinary powers to President Yeltsin, expiring in 13 months.
* 10 November 1991 - The deputies fail to pass a resolution declaring martial law in [[Chechen-Ingush ASSR]], thus prolonging the [[First Chechen War|Chechen conflict]].
* 18 April 1992 - Sixth &lt;nowiki&gt;[session of the]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Congress approved overall course of [[Russian Constitution of 1978#List of amendments|ongoing constitutional reform]] and basic provisions of Constitutional Commission-backed draft Constitution of the Russian Federation.
* 21 April 1992 - the Congress made gradual revision of then-current Constitution of 1978, which had reflected some of decisions, alreadly passed by the Russian Supreme Soviet, such as:
** November 1991 adoption of the Declaration of Rights and Freedoms of Man and Citizen - completely new rights &amp; duties provisions was written in Chapter II of the 1978 Constitution
** 12 December 1991 independence of RSFSR from USSR (but no explicit decision for ratification of Belavezha Accords was adopted; moreover, USSR Constitution &amp; laws [[de jure|formally]] remains binding per art. 4 of the 1978 Russian Constitution, until abrogation of latter in December 1993)
** 25 December 1991 – Renaming of the Russian SFSR to Russian Federation - old name of the Republic was written out of Constitution (replaced by the "Russian Federation - Russia" in title, preamble, art. 1 and by the "Russian Federation" elsewhere in the Constitution).
* 10 December 1992 – First major clash between the President and the Congress takes place over the Congressional refusal to approve Yegor Gaidar as the Head of Government and to prolong the President’s extraordinary powers. A compromise is achieved and a referendum was scheduled to be held on March 12, 1993.
* 10 March 1993 – An extraordinary session of the Congress cancels the referendum and nullifies the extraordinary powers granted to the president in November 1991.
* 20 March 1993 – The president declares a “special regime”, unilaterally schedules a referendum of confidence, and refuses to obey the Congress until the referendum is held.
* 28 March 1993 – 617 out of 1033 deputies in the Congress vote to impeach Yeltsin. This is 60%, lower than the 2/3 required for a successful impeachment.
* 29 March 1993 – The Congress schedules a referendum on approval of president Yeltsin’s policies (especially economic policies) and early presidential and legislative elections.
* 23 April 1993 – In the [[Russian government referendum, 1993|nationwide referendum]] the population expresses support for Yeltsin and his policies.
* 5 June 1993 – The Constitutional Convention begins. The Congress delegates applaud Khasbulatov, while the presidential security grab one deputy and pull him out, pushing aside the Prosecutor General.
* 18 September 1993 – The president gathers representatives of executive and legislative power of the federal subjects, but they refuse his suggestion to proclaim a new supreme governing body – the Federal Assembly.
* 21 September 1993 – Presidential decree № 1400 declares the Congress to be dissolved and schedules elections for the Federal Assembly. This move infringes the "Law on the President" (passed at the Fourth R.S.F.S.R. Congress of People's Deputies on May 24, 1991), and leads to the Congress dismissing president Yeltsin and the power formally passes to Vice-President [[Alexander Rutskoy]].
* 22 September 1993 – Congress approves Rutskoy as the new Head of State and designates a new cabinet. [[Dual power]] leads to street fighting in Moscow.
* 4 October 1993 – Pro-presidential forces [[1993 Russian constitutional crisis|storm the White House]] and dissolve the Congress.

* 26 February 1994 – Prosecutor General agrees to amnesty despite Yeltsin’s protests.
* 9 March 1994 – Presidential administration writes a “black list” of 151 former deputies who defended the Congress. These deputies were deprived of their social privileges, until they were restored on 22 April by a presidential decree.
* 4 March 1995 – the most resistant of the former Congressmen celebrated the official end of their delegated powers.

==Political parties==
During the first session of the Congress, 86% were card-carrying members of the [[CPSU]]. This number declined steadily as more people resigned from the party, however new major parties were not quick enough to form, leaving a large percentage of the Congress non-partisan. CPSU was banned by president Yeltsin in November 1991 due to the attempted [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|August Coup]]. The party collapsed completely during the collapse of Soviet Union, and in Russia it was replaced by [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|CPRF]].

&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

==Deputy fractions and blocs==
During the first session of the Congress, 24 deputy fractions were registered, numbering 50 to 355 deputies. Dual membership was allowed, so the fraction membership numbered 200% of the entire Congress. Two major blocs quickly formed in opposition to each other – the Communist Bloc, and the Democratic Russia Bloc. The “Democratic Russia” and its allies were initially in the majority, which allowed Yeltsin to be elected as the Chairman of the Presidium. During the fifth session, dual membership in fractions was outlawed, “one deputy – one fraction” law was passed. However, dual membership still remained an issue and in April 1992 there were 30 deputies with membership in several fractions.

By 1993, a total of 14 fractions remained and 200-210 deputies still haven't declared membership in any fractions. The Democratic Russia Bloc collapsed, and resulted in formation of two new blocs – “Reform Coalition” and “Democratic Centre”. A new bloc called “Russian Unity” formed by the conservative communists and their sympathizers and centre-left “Creative Forces” bloc was formed by the moderate left. Together they constituted majority and voiced opposition to Yeltsin and many of his policies. However, as of March 1993, they still lacked supermajority required for impeachment.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9559">A '''crush fetish''' is a [[Sexual fetishism|fetish]] and a [[paraphilia]] in which one is [[sexually aroused]] when someone crushes objects, food, and sometimes small animals (frequently insects) with their body, usually under their foot, or when crushed oneself.&lt;ref&gt;G.A. Pearson. (1997). Digest Cultural Entomology. Fourth issue. [http://www.janushead.org/7-1/biles.pdf Crush Fetishists]&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''soft crush''' refers to the more common fetish surrounding videos involving inanimate objects (such as food) or small invertebrates (e.g. insects, snails, worms, arachnids) being crushed, while the term '''hard crush''' refers to such videos involving larger animals with vertebrae, and arguably more pain-susceptible animals (e.g. reptiles, birds, mammals).&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Mark Griffiths, (May 17, 2012). [http://drmarkgriffiths.wordpress.com/2012/05/17/trample-leaning-a-beginners-guide-to-crush-fetishism/ A Beginner's Guide To Crush Fetishism]&lt;/ref&gt; The preference could be barefoot, [[high-heels]], [[flip flops]], [[socks and sandals]], and so on, depending on the fetishist. Most soft crush fetishists prefer to distinguish themselves from hard crush fetishists, believing that crush films with larger animals give the entire group a bad label.&lt;ref&gt;Thoswal. (March 2014). [http://www.experienceproject.com/confessions.php?cid=976161 Hear A Crush Fetishist Out]&lt;/ref&gt;

There are currently no known laws forbidding the crushing of objects and insects, but the production or trade of crush erotica involving live vertebrates is condemned by animal rights activists and is illegal in many countries, including the [[United States]] and [[Great Britain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ehrfurcht.com/sexlex.php/crush-fetish.html|title=Crush fetish|website=www.ehrfurcht.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, interstate commerce in [hard] crush videos has been illegal since 2010,&lt;ref name="h111-5566"&gt;[http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5566 H.R. 5566: Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010.] www.govtrack.us&lt;/ref&gt; and many other countries also have banned them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= DeMello |first= Margo |date= September 2009 |title= Feet and Footwear: A Cultural Encyclopedia |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=5QdKSxajwP0C |publisher= Greenwood |accessdate= 2014-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crush films==
Crush films are videos of insects and objects being crushed by being stepped on.&lt;ref&gt;[http://volokh.com/posts/1216416918.shtml Third Circuit Rejects Proposed New "Depiction of Animal Cruelty" First Amendment Exception] The Volokh Conspiracy, July 18, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A.

(accessed 2006-05-04)&lt;/ref&gt; Vilencia, along with many other fetishists, has loved to see invertebrates crushed since a young age; he claims that when he was 2–3 years old, he repeatedly attempted to get people to step on him.&lt;ref&gt;Lex Appeal [http://lexappeal.org/post/601378279/episode-1-crush-videos-and-the-first-amendment ''Animal Cruelty, Crush Videos and the First Amendment''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===
The legality of crush films and the actual practice of crushing varies by region; however, many have been posted on web sites and are available for download via the Internet, making the control of their distribution difficult.

The production or trade of crush erotica involving [[vertebrate]]s is condemned by opponents of [[Cruelty to animals|animal cruelty]] and is illegal in many countries including the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Hearing before the subcommittee on crime, of the committee on the judiciary (United States) House of Representatives.

(accessed 2006-05-04)&lt;/ref&gt;

====United States====
In 1999, the United States Congress enacted a statute affecting the legality of crush films which criminalized the creation, sale, and possession of depictions of animal cruelty, though with an exception for "any depiction that has serious religious, political, scientific, educational, journalistic, historical, or artistic value."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/18/usc_sec_18_00000048----000-.html § 48. Depiction of animal cruelty]. United States Code: Title 18, Part I, Chapter 3, § 48. Cornell University Law School&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] invalidated the ban on the sale and possession of such films (if not otherwise obscene) as a violation of the Constitution's guarantee for [[Freedom of speech in the United States|freedom of speech]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://randazza.wordpress.com/2008/07/20/united-states-v-stevens-protecting-animals-is-not-a-reason-to-amputate-part-of-the-first-amendment/ United States v. Stevens - Protecting Animals no Justification for First Amendment Amputation], ''The Legal Satyricon'', 20-07-2008&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Supreme Court]] affirmed the Third Circuit's decision in ''[[United States v. Stevens]]'', finding the law unconstitutional because the law was so broad and vague that it included any portrayal of an animal in or being harmed such as by hunting or disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Justices Reject Ban on Videos of Animal Cruelty |author=Adam Liptak |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=April 20, 2010 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/04/21/us/21scotus.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 28, 2010, bill H.R. 5566, which prohibits [[interstate commerce]] in animal crush films, was passed by the House of Representatives and the Senate, and on December 9, the bill was signed by President Obama becoming the [[Animal Crush Video Prohibition Act of 2010]].&lt;ref name="h111-5566" /&gt;

====United Kingdom====
Although the majority of films are thought to originate in the United States, the first arrest in the UK was made in 2002 of Craig Chapman, Christine Besford, Sarah Cooke, and Theraza Smallwood.

'''The Dibble's Bridge coach crash''' was a fatal accident that occurred on 10 June 1925 on the B6265 road, at [[River Dibb|Dibble's Bridge]], below [[Grimwith Reservoir]] {{convert|1.6|mi|km}} east of [[Hebden, North Yorkshire|Hebden]], in the [[civil parish]] of [[Hartlington]] in [[Craven]], [[North Yorkshire]], England. Seven people were killed, and a number of others injured. 

==Accident==
The accident occurred when a coach carrying a party of members of the York Municipal Guild and their families on an outing to [[Bolton Abbey]] from [[York]] suffered brake failure as it travelled down a 1:6 (9.5°) (16.67%) gradient from Fancarl Top to the bottom of the valley downstream of [[Grimwith reservoir]]. It gained considerable speed and failing to negotiate the sharp bend at the bottom crashed through the parapet of Dibble's Bridge, landing on its roof. Many of the passengers were pinned beneath the vehicle, five being killed instantly, whilst two others died within half an hour. A number of other passengers were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Wheels of Industry|publisher=Commercial Motor|url=http://archive.commercialmotor.com/article/16th-june-1925/4/wheels-of-industry|accessdate=23 August 2014|date=16 June 1925}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Electric Factory Concerts''' is a [[Philadelphia]]-based [[Concert promoter|concert promotion firm]], affiliated with the [[Electric Factory]] venue in that city.  It was founded by Herbert Spivak, who ran the business with his brothers Jerry Spivak and Allen Spivak.  They later hired Larry Magid to become General Manager, and he also became a co-owner of the company.

Its first concert staging was on February 2, 1968, at the old Electric Factory and featured [[The Chambers Brothers]].&lt;ref name="aa2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/35670/40-years-of-rockin-philly|title=40 Years Of Rockin' Philly &amp;#124; AllAccess.com|publisher=allaccess.com|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It survived the closing of the original Electric Factory venue and went on to prosper.&lt;ref&gt;''Biography News, Volume 2''. Gale Research Company, 1975, p. 153.&lt;/ref&gt;  It became prominent in promoting concerts at all venues in the Philadelphia area,&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Billboard|publisher=Nielsen Business Media, Inc.|issn=0006-2510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MREEAAAAMBAJ|pages=1–67|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=1975-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; including many at the [[Philadelphia Spectrum]].&lt;ref name="A Philly Guide's Guide"&gt;{{cite book |first=Julie P. |last=Curson |title=A Guide's Guide to Philadelphia |year=1991 |page=256 |location=Philadelphia, PA, US |publisher=Curson House |edition=6th |isbn=0913694061 |oclc=894776363}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1975, Electric Factory Concerts bought the [[Tower Theater (Upper Darby, Pennsylvania)|Tower Theater]] from its owner Midnight Sun. About a year later, Midnight Sun commenced an anti-trust action against Electric Factory and its secret concert partner, Spectrum Corporation, in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania]]. The suit dragged on for several years and was eventually settled for approximately $1&amp;nbsp;million, as reported in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' and the Philadelphia newspapers. A later anti-trust suit by rock promoter [[Stephen Starr]] against Electric Factory Concerts was also settled for the same amount in 1990, which then financed Starr's rise as a star in the restaurant industry.

The firm gained national renown.&lt;ref name="aa2008"/&gt;  It played a role in staging 1985's [[Live Aid]]&lt;ref name="aa2008"/&gt; and 2005's [[Live 8 concert, Philadelphia]].

Electric Factory Concerts remains the dominant Philadelphia concert promoter, though the brand is now owned by [[Live Nation Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="Larry Magid Out At Live Nation"&gt;{{cite web |title=Larry Magid Out At Live Nation, But Does That Mean He’s Out Of The Concert Biz? |url= http://www.philebrity.com/2010/02/18/larry-magid-out-at-live-nation-but-does-that-mean-hes-out-of-the-concert-biz/ |date=2010-02-18 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100221141722/http://www.philebrity.com/2010/02/18/larry-magid-out-at-live-nation-but-does-that-mean-hes-out-of-the-concert-biz |archivedate=2010-02-21 |deadurl=yes |work=philebrity.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IATSE|The International Association of Theatrical Stage Employees]], Local 8 has called for a boycott of all Electric Factory Concert events, stating that the promoter "(undermines) the area standard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fiorillo|first=Victor|title=Stagehand Union Declares "War" On Electric Factory Concerts|url=http://blogs.phillymag.com/the_philly_post/2013/03/01/stagehands-union-strike-electric-factory-erykah-badu-show/|publisher=The Philly Post|accessdate=24 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Conformation show|Ch.]] Fiacre's First and Foremost''' (born 9 September 2007), also known as '''Fiona''', is a [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] bred to have low levels of [[uric acid]]. She is registered to the [[United Kennel Club]] Dalmatian Breed Club in America and was registered with the [[American Kennel Club]] in 2011, when LUA Dalmatians were granted entry into the AKC. She became the first low uric acid Dalmatian to compete at [[Crufts]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 2011.

==Background and early life==
Dr. Robert Schaible started a breeding program in 1973 to outcross an [[American Kennel Club]] (AKC) [[conformation show|champion]] [[Dalmatian (dog)|Dalmatian]] with a [[Pointer (dog breed)|Pointer]] to correct a [[genetic defect]] in the Dalmatian [[dog breed|breed]] that affects the metabolism of [[uric acid]]. This condition can lead to a variety of complications, including [[urate crystal arthropathy]], [[Bladder stone (animal)|bladder stones]], obstruction of the [[Urinary tract obstruction|urinary tract]] and potentially death.&lt;ref name=dogpress&gt;{{cite news |last=Mitchell |first=Marion |title=LUA Dalmatian Makes Breed History at Crufts |url=http://www.thedogpress.com/ShowShots/LUA-Dalmatian-Crufts-11022_Mitchell.asp |newspaper=The Dog Press |date=7 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703153209/http://www.thedogpress.com/ShowShots/LUA-Dalmatian-Crufts-11022_Mitchell.asp |archivedate=2011-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fiona was born on September 9, 2007, in [[Nevada]],&lt;ref name=mongrel/&gt;&lt;ref name=indeleading&gt;{{cite news|title=Leading article: Spot the mongrel|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/opinion/leading-articles/leading-article-spot-the-mongrel-2235208.html|newspaper=The Independent|date=8 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; her unique breeding name being "Fiacre's First and Foremost".&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt; She has liver spots.&lt;ref name=mongrel&gt;{{cite news|last=Elliott|first=Valerie|title=Fiona the mongrel and a spot of bother at Crufts: 'Impure' dalmatian angers traditionalists at the elite pedigree dog show|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1363354/Fiona-mongrel-spot-bother-Crufts-Impure-dalmatian-angers-traditionalists-elite-pedigree-dog-show.html?ito=feeds-newsxml|newspaper=The Daily Mail|date=6 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She is the 15th generation of the cross conducted by Dr. Schaible, which makes her 99.98% Dalmatian.

She has been tested for the mutated gene that causes high uric acid levels, and the results showed she carried the normal genes for uric acid levels. Dogs with a single normal gene will have low levels of uric acid, but their offspring can have either high or low levels of uric acid; however, dogs like Fiona who have two normal genes have low uric acid levels and all of their offspring will have low levels of uric acid, regardless of the dog to which it is bred.&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt;

==Show career==
She completed her championship in the UKC after four shows. By the time she was six months old, she placed Reserve Best in Show on three occasions, and won one Best in Show. She became the UKC top-ranked Dalmatian for 2008 and 2009, winning the [[Companion Group]] at the UKC's premier show, the first time a Dalmatian has achieved this. At the show in 2010, Fiona became a UKC "Total" dog, winning the conformation competition and receiving a qualifying score in a performance event.&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt;

In August 2010,&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt; she was moved to live with Julie Evans in [[Barmouth]], North [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=dailyposttails&gt;{{cite news|last=Trewyn|first=Hywel|title='Mongrel' Dalmatian sends tails wagging at Crufts|url=http://www.dailypost.co.uk/news/north-wales-news/2011/03/08/mongrel-dalmatian-sends-tails-wagging-at-crufts-55578-28295891/|newspaper=Daily Post|date=8 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Julie had been working to convince [[The Kennel Club]] (UK) to register low uric Dalmatians. Two Kennel Club judges assessed Fiona and confirmed she was a Dalmatian and eligible to compete at Kennel Club shows.&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt; At her first show in the UK at the British Utility Breeds Association (BUBA), she placed third in the Limit Bitch class out of 13 entries,&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt;&lt;ref name=buba2010&gt;{{cite web|title=BUBA 2010 Judged by Mr E Paterson|url=http://www.britishdalmatianclub.org.uk/shows/index.php?action=view_show&amp;show_id=342&amp;class_type=bitch#Limit+Bitch|publisher=British Dalmatian Club|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which qualified her to compete at the 2011 [[Crufts]] show. At three further shows, she placed Best of Breed twice and won the group once.&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt; As qualification for Crufts is earned in shows in the year prior to the event, Fiona placed Second Limit Bitch at the Boston and District Canine Society on January 9, 2011,&lt;ref name=bostonshow&gt;{{cite web|title=Boston 2011 Judged by Alan Beeston|url=http://www.britishdalmatianclub.org.uk/shows/index.php?action=view_show&amp;show_id=344&amp;class_type=bitch#Limit+Bitch|publisher=British Dalmatian Club|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; qualifying her for Crufts in 2012.&lt;ref name=dogpress/&gt;

Fiona's entry at Crufts has caused some uproar among traditionalists. Anne Harcraft, a dog breeder, said, "This is a dog that is not purebred. This is a mongrel. You can't cross a Dalmatian with a pointer and say it's a Dalmatian. This is unethical and I'd be disgusted if the dog won."&lt;ref name=mongrel /&gt; Jemima Harrison, the producer of ''[[Pedigree Dogs Exposed]]'', said of the criticism Fiona has received, "It is astonishing but true that the majority of breeders would rather have sick dogs than allow a single drop of foreign blood to taint their breeds."&lt;ref name=mongrel /&gt; The [[Utility Group]] competition, of which the Dalmatian breed is part, at Crufts 2011 took place on March 13, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Day Four – Sunday 13 March 2011|url=http://www.crufts.org.uk/whats-on/day4|work=Crufts|accessdate=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bookmaker]] [[William Hill (bookmaker)|William Hill]] gave odds of 16 to 1 for Fiona to win Best in Breed.&lt;ref name="William Hill"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ladds|first=Nic|title=You bet a mongrel will upset the odds at Crufts?|url=http://news.williamhill.com/a/tv-specials/you-bet-a-mongrel-will-upset-the-odds-at-crufts/|newspaper=William Hill|date=7 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fiona ultimately did not place, with best of breed going to Ch. Dalmark The Shaded Moon at Nospar JW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=DFS Crufts 2011 Results: Dalmatian |url=http://crufts.fossedata.co.uk/Breed.asp?ShowYear=2011&amp;GroupID=UTI&amp;ScheduleID=177 |work=Crufts |accessdate=13 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110318093146/http://crufts.fossedata.co.uk/Breed.asp?ShowYear=2011&amp;GroupID=UTI&amp;ScheduleID=177 |archivedate=18 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, Fiona returned to the United States and completed her championship with the [[American Kennel Club]] in 2012 with five major wins.

By French law,&lt;ref&gt;French rural code [http://legifrance.gouv.fr/affichCodeArticle.do;jsessionid=943EF0198AA70E691D551179EB5E5A83.tpdjo05v_3?idArticle=LEGIARTI000006584967&amp;cidTexte=LEGITEXT000006071367&amp;dateTexte=20091223 Code rural – Article L654-27-1]: "{{lang|fr|On entend par foie gras, le foie d'un canard ou d'une oie spécialement engraissé par gavage.}}" ("'Foie gras' is understood to mean the liver of a duck or a goose that has been especially fattened by gavage").&lt;/ref&gt; foie gras is defined as the liver of a duck or goose fattened by [[force-feeding]] corn with a [[feeding tube]], a process also known as gavage. In Spain&lt;ref&gt;The Perennial Plate: Episode 121: A Time for Foie. [http://www.theperennialplate.com/episodes/2013/06/episode-121-a-time-for-foie/]. June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and other countries, it is occasionally produced using natural feeding.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Talks: Dan Barber's foie gras parable. [http://www.ted.com/talks/dan_barber_s_surprising_foie_gras_parable.html]. July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ducks are force-fed twice a day for 12.5 days and geese three times a day for around 17 days. Ducks are typically slaughtered at 100 days and geese at 112 days.&lt;ref name="Viva" /&gt;

Foie gras is a popular and well-known [[delicacy]] in [[French cuisine]].  Its flavor is described as rich, buttery, and delicate, unlike that of an ordinary duck or goose liver. Foie gras is sold whole, or is prepared into [[mousse]], [[parfait]], or [[pâté]], and may also be served as an accompaniment to another food item, such as steak. French law states that "Foie gras belongs to the protected cultural and gastronomical heritage of France."&lt;ref&gt;French rural code [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/WAspad/UnArticleDeCode?commun=&amp;code=CRURALNL.rcv&amp;art=L654-27-1 L654-27-1]{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The technique of gavage dates as far back as [[25th century BC|2500 BC]], when the [[ancient Egyptians]] began keeping birds for food and deliberately fattened the birds through force-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reshafim.org.il/ad/egypt/timelines/topics/domesticated_animals.htm|title=Ancient Egypt: Farmed and domesticated animals|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though it is produced and consumed worldwide, particularly in other European nations, the United States, and China.&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=11118706|title=A Global Taste Test of Foie Gras and Truffles|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Foie gras controversy|Gavage-based foie gras production is controversial]], due mainly to the animal welfare concerns about force-feeding, intensive housing and husbandry, and enlarging the liver to 10 times its usual volume. A number of countries and jurisdictions have laws against force-feeding, and the production, import or sale of foie gras; even where it is legal, a number of retailers decline to stock it.

==History==
[[Image:Egyptiangeesefeeding.jpg|thumb|300px|A [[bas relief]] depiction of overfeeding geese]]

===Ancient times===
As early as 2500 BC, the ancient Egyptians learned that many birds could be fattened through forced overfeeding and began this practice. Whether they particularly sought the fattened livers of birds as a delicacy remains undetermined.&lt;ref name="McGee_1"&gt;{{Harv|McGee|2004|p=167}}: "''Foie gras is the "fat liver" of force-fed geese and ducks. It has been made and appreciated since Roman times and probably long before; the force-feeding of geese is clearly represented in Egyptian art from 2500 BC.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Toussaint-Samat_1"&gt;{{Harv|Toussaint-Samat|1994|p=425}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[necropolis]] of [[Saqqara]], in the tomb of [[Mereruka]], an important royal official, there is a [[bas relief]] scene wherein workers grasp geese around the necks in order to push food down their throats. At the side stand tables piled with more food pellets, and a flask for moistening the feed before giving it to the geese.&lt;ref name="Toussaint-Samat_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginor_1"&gt;{{Harv|Ginor|1999|p=2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200104/living.with.the.animals.htm|title=Saudi Aramco World : Living With the Animals|publisher=|access-date=29 December 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061229125957/http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/200104/living.with.the.animals.htm|archive-date=29 December 2006|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of goose fattening spread from Egypt to the Mediterranean.&lt;ref name="Alford_1"&gt;{{Harv|Alford|2001|p=36}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest reference to fattened geese is from the 5th century BC Greek poet [[Cratinus]], who wrote of geese-fatteners, yet Egypt maintained its reputation as the source for fattened geese. When the [[Sparta]]n king [[Agesilaus]] visited Egypt in 361 BC, he noted Egyptian farmers fattened geese and calves.&lt;ref name="Toussaint-Samat_1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginor_2"&gt;{{Harv|Ginor|1999|p=3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was not until the Roman period, however, that foie gras is mentioned as a distinct food, which the Romans named ''iecur ficatum'';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sagar|first1=Khan|title=About the history of foie gras|url=https://www.foiegrasgourmet.com/en/the-foie-gras-history|accessdate=27 February 2017|work=www.foiegrasgourmet.com|publisher=Foie Gras Gourmet|date=12 February 2015|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ginor_3"&gt;{{Harv|Ginor|1999|p=4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giacosa_1"&gt;{{Harv|Giacosa|1994|p=13}}.&lt;/ref&gt; ''iecur'' means [[liver]]&lt;ref name="Langslow_1"&gt;{{Harv|Langslow|2000|p=153}}: "''A second instance of the restriction of the sense of a Latin anatomical term to animals is ''iecur'' 'the liver' in Theodorus and Cassius. In both, the human liver is always ''hepar'', while ''iecur'' is used of an animal (...)''"&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ficatum'' derives from ''[[ficus]]'', meaning fig in [[Latin]].&lt;ref&gt;"Ficus,i" (...) Derivés: (...) ''ficatum'' n. (sc. iecur): d'abord terme de cuisine "foie garni de figues", cf.

A. Ernout, A. Meillet, ''Dictionnaire etymologique de la langue latine'', Éd. Klincksieck, Paris 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Elagabalus]] fed his dogs on foie gras during the four years of his reign.&lt;ref name="Toussaint-Samat_5"&gt;{{Harv|Toussaint-Samat|1994|p=426}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pliny the Elder]] (1st century AD) credits his contemporary, Roman gastronome [[Marcus Gavius Apicius]], with feeding dried figs to geese in order to enlarge their livers:

{{quote
|
"Apicius made the discovery, that we may employ the same artificial method of increasing the size of the liver of the sow, as of that of the goose; it consists in cramming them with dried figs, and when they are fat enough, they are drenched with wine mixed with honey, and immediately killed."

Hence, the term ''iecur ficatum'', fig-stuffed liver; feeding figs to enlarge a goose's liver may derive from Hellenistic Alexandria, since much of [[Roman luxury cuisine]] was of Greek inspiration.&lt;ref name="Faas_1"&gt;{{Harv|Faas|2002|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Ficatum'' was closely associated with animal liver and it became the [[Root (linguistics)|root word]] for "liver"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Yakov |last1=Malkiel |authorlink=Yakov Malkiel |year=1944 |title=The Etymology of Portuguese Iguaria |journal=Language |volume=20 |issue=3 |pages=108–30 |jstor=410151 |doi=10.2307/410151}}&lt;/ref&gt; in each of these languages: ''foie'' in French,&lt;ref name="Walter_1"&gt;{{Harv|Walter|2006|p=40}}: "''(...) for example, why it is not the word JECUR (a Latin word taken from the Greek) which has come down to us with the meaning of 'liver', but the Romance word ''ficato'', which has become the French ''foie''. The word ''ficato'' is formed on the Latin word FICUS 'fig', and would appear to have nothing to do with the 'liver' other than the Greeks, followed by the Romans, fattened their geese with figs to obtain particularly fleshy and tasty livers. The FICATUM JECUR or 'fig-fattened goose liver', which was very much sought after, must have become such a common expression that it was shortened to FICATUM (just as the modern French say ''frites'' as an abbreviation of ''pommes de terre frites''). To begin with the word FICATUM probably designated only edible animal livers, with its meaning then being extended to include the human organ.''"&lt;/ref&gt; ''hígado'' in Spanish, ''fígado'' in Portuguese, ''fegato'' in Italian, ''fetge'' in Catalan and Occitan and ''ficat'' in Romanian, all meaning "liver"; this etymology has been explained in different manners.&lt;ref name="Littré_1"&gt;{{Harv|Littré|1863|p=137}}: "''Feûte n'est pas mieux fait que ''foie''; seulement, il conserve le ''t'' du Latin; car on sait que ''foie'' vient de ''ficatum'' (foie d'une oie nourrie de figues, et, de là, foie en général). ''Foie'' en français, ''feûte'' en wallon, ''fetge'' en provençal, ''fégato'' en italien, ''hígado'' en espagnol, ''fígado'' en portugais, témoignent que la bouche romane déplaça l'accent du mot Latin, et, au lieu de ''ficátum'', qui est la prononciation régulière, dit, par anomalie, ''fícatum'' avec l'accent sur l'antépénultième.''"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etimo.it/?term=fegato&amp;find=Cerca Dizionario etimologico online: fégato].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postclassical Europe===
After the fall of the Roman empire, goose liver temporarily vanished from European cuisine. Some claim that Gallic farmers preserved the foie gras tradition until the rest of Europe rediscovered it centuries later, but the medieval French peasant's food animals were mainly pig and sheep.&lt;ref name="Ginor_5"&gt;{{Harv|Ginor|1999|p=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Others claim that the tradition was preserved by the Jews, who learned the method of enlarging a goose's liver during the Roman colonisation of [[Judea]]&lt;ref name="Ginor_6"&gt;{{Harv|Ginor|1999|p=9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; or earlier from Egyptians.&lt;ref name="Davidson_1"&gt;{{Harv|Davidson|1999|p=311}}: "''The enlarged liver has been counted a delicacy since classical times, when the force-feeding of the birds was practised in classical Rome. It is commonly said that the practice dates back even further, to ancient Egypt, and that knowledge of it was possibly acquired by the Jews during their period of 'bondage' there and transmitted by them to the classical civilizations.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The Jews carried this culinary knowledge as they migrated farther north and west to Europe.&lt;ref name="Ginor_6"/&gt;

The Judaic dietary law, [[Kashrut]], forbade [[lard]] as a cooking medium, and butter, too, was proscribed as an alternative since Kashrut also prohibited mixing meat and dairy products.&lt;ref name="Alford_1" /&gt; Jewish cuisine used [[olive oil]] in the Mediterranean, and [[sesame oil]] in [[Babylonia]], but neither cooking medium was readily available in Western and Central Europe, so poultry fat (known in Yiddish as ''[[schmaltz]]''), which could be abundantly produced by overfeeding geese, was substituted in their stead.&lt;ref name="Ginor_6" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Alford_2"&gt;{{Harv|Alford|2001|p=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="momentmag.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.momentmag.com/foie-gras-indelicate-delicacy/|title=Foie Gras: The Indelicate Delicacy|author=Eileen Lavine|work=Moment Magazine|date=2013-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The delicate taste of the goose's liver was soon appreciated; [[Hans Wilhelm Kirchhof]] of [[Kassel]] wrote in 1562 that the Jews raise fat geese and particularly love their livers. Some [[Rabbi]]s were concerned that eating forcibly overfed geese violated Jewish food restrictions. The Chatam Sofer, Rabbi [[Moses Sofer]], contended that it is not a forbidden food ([[treyf]]) as none of its limbs are damaged.{{Citation needed|date=May 2018}} This matter remained a debated topic in Jewish dietary law until the Jewish taste for goose liver declined in the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Ginor_6" /&gt; Another kashrut matter, still a problem today, is that even properly slaughtered and inspected meat must be drained of blood before being considered fit to eat. Usually, salting achieves that; however, as liver is regarded as "(almost) wholly blood", broiling is the only way of kashering. Properly broiling a foie gras while preserving its delicate taste is difficult, and therefore rarely practiced. Even so, there are restaurants in Israel that offer grilled goose foie gras.  Foie Gras also bears resemblance to the Jewish food staple, chopped liver.&lt;ref name="momentmag.com"/&gt;

[[Image:Scappi.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Bartolomeo Scappi]]
Appreciation of fattened goose liver spread to gastronomes outside the Jewish community, who could buy in the local Jewish [[ghetto]] of their cities. In 1570, [[Bartolomeo Scappi]], chef de cuisine to [[Pope Pius V]], published his cookbook ''Opera'', wherein he describes that "the liver of [a] domestic goose raised by the Jews is of extreme size and weighs [between] two and three pounds."&lt;ref name="Ginor_7"&gt;{{Harv|Ginor|1999|p=11}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1581, Marx Rumpolt of [[Mainz]], chef to several German nobles, published the massive cookbook ''Ein Neu Kochbuch'', describing that the Jews of [[Bohemia]] produced livers weighing more than three pounds; he lists recipes for it—including one for goose liver [[mousse]].&lt;ref name="Ginor_7"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Toussaint-Samat_6"&gt;{{Harv|Toussaint-Samat|1994|p=427}}.&lt;/ref&gt; János Keszei, chef to the court of [[Michael I Apafi|Michael Apafi]], the prince of [[Transylvania]], included foie gras recipes in his 1680 cookbook ''A New Book About Cooking'', instructing cooks to "envelop the goose liver in a calf's thin skin, bake it and prepare [a] green or [a] brown sauce to accompany it. I used goose liver fattened by Bohemian Jews, its weight was more than three pounds. You may also prepare a mush of it."

In the 21st century, France is by far the largest producer and consumer of foie gras, though it is produced and consumed in several other countries worldwide, particularly in some other European nations, the United States, and China.&lt;ref name="npr.org"/&gt;  Approximately 30,000 people are members of the French foie gras industry, with 90% of them residing in the Périgord ([[Dordogne]]), the [[Aquitaine]] [[région]]s in the southwest, and [[Alsace]] région in the east. The European Union recognizes the foie gras produced according to traditional farming methods (''label rouge'') in southwestern France with a geographical indication of provenance.

Hungary is the world's second-largest foie gras (''libamáj'') producer and the largest exporter. France is the principal market for Hungarian foie gras – mainly exported raw. Approximately 30,000 Hungarian goose farmers are dependent on the foie gras industry.&lt;ref name="Hungary"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cee-foodindustry.com/news/ng.asp?id=49055-hungary-facing-foie|title=Food Ingredients &amp; Food Science – Additives, Flavours, Starch|work=FoodNavigator.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; French food companies spice, process, and cook the foie gras so it may be sold as a French product in its domestic and export markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3346185.stm |work=BBC News  | title=Hungary foie gras farms under threat | date=12 January 2004 | accessdate=2 May 2010 | first=Nick | last=Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre 2000===
Some countries have produced foie gras only sporadically in the past.  For example, in 1996, Turkey had a peak year of production with 20 tonnes of foie gras valued at US$39,000 being exported.&lt;ref name="Turkey"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=International Journal of Poultry Science|volume=12|issue=9|pages=553–560|year=2013|author1=Wilson, R.T.|author2=Yilmaz.

===2005===
In 2005, France produced 18,450 tonnes of foie gras (78.5% of the world's estimated total production of 23,500 tonnes) of which 96% was duck liver and 4% goose liver. Total French consumption of foie gras in this year was 19,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name=xinhua/&gt;  In 2005, Hungary, the world's second-largest foie gras producer exported 1,920 tonnes&lt;ref name="Hungary" /&gt; and Bulgaria produced 1,500 tons of foie gras.&lt;ref name=xinhua/&gt;

The demand for foie gras in the Far East is such that China has become a sizeable producer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Foie Gras |url=http://www.esdaw.eu/foie-gras.html |website=European Society of Dog and Animal Welfare |accessdate=17 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Madagascar is a small but rapidly growing producer of high quality foie gras.&lt;ref&gt;Rakotomalala, M.

In 2015, it was reported that in France, sales of foie gras may be waning and an OpinionWay poll found that 47% of the French population supported a ban on force-feeding.&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2015"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|publisher=The Telegraph|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/france/11363488/First-foie-gras-trial-under-way-in-France.html|title=First foie gras trial under way in France|author=Samuel, H.|year=2015|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huffington2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/mimi-bekhechi/foie-gras-cruelty-charges-long-overdue_b_6955232.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|year=2015|title=Cruelty charges long overdue for foie gras farmers|author=Bekhechi, M.|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015-2016===
In 2016, it was reported that France produces an estimated 75% of the world's foie gras and southwestern France produces approximately 70% of that total.  In 2016, it can retail for upwards of $65 a pound.&lt;ref name="Houck"&gt;{{cite news|title=France places temporary ban on foie gras production|author=Houck, B.|date=May 12, 2016|accessdate=July 23, 2016|publisher=Eater|url=http://www.eater.com/2016/5/12/11662702/france-ban-foie-gras-production-bird-flu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2015, there were several outbreaks of the highly contagious [[Influenza A virus subtype H5N1|H5N1 bird flu]] in France, which escalated during 2016. This led to Algeria, China, Egypt, Japan, Morocco, South Korea, Thailand and Tunisia banning French poultry exports, including foie gras, and France to initiate increased bio-security protocols which will cost an estimated 220 million euros.  One of these measures was the halting of production in southwestern France from early April, 2016 for an anticipated period of three months to reduce the spread of the virus.  Exports of foie gras from France are expected to decrease from 4,560 tonnes in 2015 to 3,160 tonnes in 2016.&lt;ref name="Houck" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Samuel"&gt;{{cite news|author=Samuel, H.|date=June 29, 2016|accessdate=July 23, 2016|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2016/06/29/french-foie-gras-faces-soaring-prices-at-christmas-in-wake-of-bi/|title=French foie gras faces soaring prices at Christmas in wake of bird flu scare|publisher=The Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rousseau"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fear in France as bird flu spreads|author=Rousseau, O.|url=http://www.globalmeatnews.com/Safety-Legislation/Fear-in-France-as-bird-flu-spreads|accessdate=July 23, 2016|date= December 10, 2015|publisher=GlobalMeat news.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the largest producer is Hudson Valley Foie Gras, which uses approximately 350,000 ducks each year.&lt;ref name="DeSoucey2016" /&gt;

In France, foie gras exists in different, legally defined presentations, ordered by expense:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/texteconsolide/ADHQG.htm Decree 93-999 August 9, 1993] defining legal categories and terms for foie gras in France&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''foie gras entier'' (whole foie gras), made of one or two whole liver lobes; either cuit (''cooked''), mi-cuit (''semi-cooked''), or frais (''fresh'');
* ''foie gras'', made of pieces of livers reassembled together;
* ''bloc de foie gras'', a fully cooked, moulded block composed of 98% or more foie gras; if termed ''avec morceaux'' ("with pieces"), it must contain at least 50% foie gras pieces for goose, and 30% for duck.

Additionally, there is ''pâté de foie gras'', ''mousse de foie gras'' (either must contain 50% or more foie gras), ''parfait de foie gras'' (must contain 75% or more foie gras); and other preparations (no legal obligation established).

Fully cooked preparations are generally sold in either glass containers or metal cans for long-term preservation. Whole, fresh foie gras is usually unavailable in France outside the Christmas period, except in some producers' markets in the producing regions. Frozen whole foie gras sometimes is sold in French supermarkets.

Whole foie gras is readily available from gourmet retailers in Canada, the United States, Hungary, Argentina and regions with a sizeable market for the product. In US, raw foie gras is classified as Grade A, B or C. Grade A is typically the highest in fat and especially suited for low-temperature preparation, because the veins are relatively few and the resulting terrine will be more aesthetically appealing because it displays little blood. Grade B is accepted for higher temperature preparation, because the higher proportion of protein gives the liver more structure after being seared. Grade C livers are generally reserved for making sauces as well as other preparations where a higher proportion of blood-filled veins will not impair the appearance of the dish.{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Production methods==

===Species, breeds and sex used===

====Geese====
Traditionally, foie gras was produced from special breeds of geese. However, by 2004, geese accounted for less than 10% of the total global foie gras production&lt;ref name="Guémené"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The past, present and future of force-feeding and "foie gras" production|author1=Guémené D.  |author2=Guy, G.|journal=World's Poultry Science Journal|volume=60|issue=2|year=2004|pages=210–222|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=601276&amp;fileId=S0043933904000194|doi=10.1079/wps200414}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 2014 only 5% of total French production.&lt;ref name="CIFOG"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foie gras production|url=http://foiegras-factsandtruth.com/breeding/palmipeds|year=2014|publisher=CIFOG|accessdate=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goose breeds used in modern foie gras production are primarily the grey Landes goose (''Anser anser'')&lt;ref name="CIFOG" /&gt; and the [[Toulouse goose]].&lt;ref name="Ravo"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9802E0DB1639F937A1575AC0A96E958260 | work=The New York Times | title=A Cornucopia of Native Foie Gras; Partners' Efforts Produce Menu Delicacy in Abundance | first=Nick | last=Ravo | date=24 September 1998 | accessdate=2 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.patrimoine-biologique.midipyrenees.fr/fiche.asp?FK_cat_animal=1&amp;page=2 Toulouse Goose] Pyrenees Biological Academy (in French)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=February 2015}}

In 2016, Hungary was producing 80% of the world's goose foie gras, however, production rates are likely to drop in 2017 due to outbreaks of bird flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hungary's foie gras industry down with flu as millions of birds die|publisher=Reuters|author=Than, K.|date=January 25, 2017|accessdate=January 26, 2017|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/hungarys-foie-gras-industry-down-flu-millions-birds-141848197.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ducks====
In 2014, ducks accounted for 95% of foie gras production.&lt;ref name="CIFOG" /&gt;  The breeds primarily used are the [[Muscovy duck]] (''Cairina moschata'')&lt;ref name="CIFOG" /&gt; (also called the Barbary duck) and the hybrid cross of a male Muscovy duck and a female [[American Pekin duck|Pekin duck]] (''Anas platyrhynchos domestica'') called the [[Mulard]] duck.&lt;ref name="CIFOG" /&gt; This hybrid is sterile and is therefore sometimes referred to as a "mule" duck.  Mulards are estimated to account for about 35% of all foie gras consumed in the US.&lt;ref name="Skippon" /&gt; About 95% of duck foie gras production from France comes from force fed Mulards and the remaining 5% from the Muscovy duck.&lt;ref name="Marie" /&gt;
 
After hatching, the Mulard ducklings are sexed.  Males put on more weight than females, so the females are slaughtered, sometimes in an industrial [[maceration (food)|macerator]].  Up to 40 million female ducks may be killed in this way.  The remains of female ducklings are later used in cat food, fertilisers and in the pharmaceutical industry.&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/shocking-video-shows-hundreds-live-4468027|title=Shocking video shows hundreds of live ducklings 'thrown into mincer' on cruel 'foie gras farm'|publisher=The Mirror|year=2014|author=Hughes, I.|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=April 2015}}

===Physiological basis===
[[File:28-gavage-foie-gras-cages-individuelles-France-2012.jpg|thumb|220px|right|Individual cages are used in some farms producing foie gras.]]
The ideology behind foie gras production is the ability that some [[waterfowl]] have to expand their esophagus and to gain weight, particularly in the liver,{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} in preparation for migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/international/out17_en.pdf |title=EU Report }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(277&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, section 4&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many birds, geese and ducks lack a [[Crop (anatomy)|crop]].  In the wild, esophageal dilation allows them to swallow large foodstuffs, such as a whole fish, for later digestion. Wild geese may consume 300&amp;nbsp;grams of protein and another 800&amp;nbsp;grams of grasses per day. Farmed geese allowed to graze on carrots adapt to eating 100&amp;nbsp;grams of protein, but may consume up to 2500&amp;nbsp;grams of the carrots per day.  The increasing amount of feed given prior to force-feeding and during the force-feeding itself cause expansion of the lower part of the esophagus.&lt;ref name="Skippon" /&gt;

====Pre-force feeding phase====
The pre-force feeding phase consists of three stages.&lt;ref name="CIFOG" /&gt;
*The first stage ("start-up") lasts from 1 to 28 days-of-age (0–4 weeks).  During this stage, the young birds are housed in large, indoor groups (e.g. 2,100&lt;ref name="Marie" /&gt;) usually on straw.
*The second stage ("growth") lasts from 28 to 63 days-of-age (4–9 weeks). The birds are moved outside to feed on grasses ''ad libitum''.  The birds are given additional feed, but access to this is limited by time.  This stage aims to take advantage of the natural dilation capacity of the esophagus of some wildfowl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/international/out17_en.pdf |title=EU Report }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(277&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}} EU Scientific Report, p19&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The third stage ("pre-fattening") lasts from 63 to 90 days-of-age (9–13 weeks).  The birds are brought inside for gradually longer periods while introduced to a high starch diet.  This is a feeding transition where the food is distributed by meals, first in restricted amount and time and thereafter greatly increased.

====Force-feeding phase====
The next production phase, which the French call ''gavage'' or ''finition d'engraissement'', or "completion of fattening", involves forced daily ingestion of controlled amounts of feed for 12 to 15 days with ducks and for 15 to 18 days with geese. During this phase, ducks are usually fed twice daily while geese are fed up to three times daily. To facilitate handling of ducks during gavage, these birds are typically housed throughout this phase in individual cages or small group pens.

Typical foie gras production involves force-feeding birds more food than they would eat in the wild, and much more than they would voluntarily eat domestically.&lt;ref&gt;https://ec.europa.eu/food/sites/food/files/safety/docs/sci-com_scah_out17_en.pdf Welfare Aspects of the Production of Foie Gras in Ducks and Geese, p 29&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Foie gras - gavage in Rocamadour, France.jpg|thumb|Modern ''gavage'' feeding process]]
In modern production, the bird is typically fed a controlled amount of feed, depending on the stage of the fattening process, the bird's weight, and the amount of feed the bird last ingested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tours.inra.fr/sra/internet/images/equipes/comportement/foiefras/Diapositive4.jpg|title=tours.inra.fr|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the start of production, a bird might be fed a dry weight of {{convert|250|g|0}} of food per day and up to {{convert|1000|g}} (in dry weight) by the end of the process. The actual amount of food force-fed is much greater, because the birds are fed a mash with a composition of about 53% dry and 47% liquid (by weight).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1080/00071660120088489 |title=Force-feeding procedure and physiological indicators of stress in male mule ducks |year=2001 |last1=Guémené |first1=D. |last2=Guy |first2=G. |last3=Noirault |first3=J. |last4=Garreau-Mills |first4=M. |last5=Gouraud |first5=P. |last6=Faure |first6=J.M. |journal=British Poultry Science |volume=42 |issue=5 |pages=650–7 |pmid=11811918 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The feed is administered using a funnel fitted with a long tube (20–30&amp;nbsp;cm long), which forces the feed into the bird's esophagus.  If an [[auger (drill)|auger]] is used, the feeding takes about 45 to 60 seconds, however, modern systems usually use a tube fed by a pneumatic pump with an operation time of 2 to 3 seconds per duck. During feeding, efforts are made to avoid damaging the bird's esophagus, which could cause injury or death, although researchers have found evidence of inflammation of the walls of the proventriculus after the first session of force-feeding.&lt;ref&gt;Serviere, J, Bernadet, MD and Guy, G. 2003. Is nociception a sensory component associated to force-feeding? Neurophysiological approach in the mule duck. 2nd World Waterfowl Conference. Alexandria, Egypt&lt;/ref&gt; There is also indication of inflammation of the esophagus in the later stages of fattening.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.avma.org/reference/backgrounders/foie_gras_bgnd.asp|title=Foie Gras Production Backgrounder&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090425174224/http://www.avma.org/reference/backgrounders/foie_gras_bgnd.asp|archivedate=25 April 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several studies have also demonstrated that mortality rates can be significantly elevated during the gavage period.&lt;ref name="EU Report"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/international/out17_en.pdf|title=Animal welfare - Food Safety - European Commission|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Koehl, PF and Chinzi, D. 1996.

The feed, usually corn boiled with fat (to facilitate ingestion), deposits large amounts of fat in the liver, thereby producing the buttery consistency sought by some [[Gourmet#Person|gastronome]]s.

Ducks reared for foie gras are typically slaughtered at 100 days of age and geese at 112 days.&lt;ref name="Viva" /&gt;   At this time, the bird's liver is 6 to 10 times its ordinary size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/international/out17_en.pdf |title=EU Report }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(277&amp;nbsp;[[Kibibyte|KiB]])}}, p60&lt;/ref&gt; Storage of fat in the liver produces [[steatosis]] of the liver cells.

===Alternative production===
Fattened liver can be produced by alternative methods without gavage, and this is often referred to either as "fatty goose liver" or as foie gras (outside France), though it does not conform to the French legal definition. This method involves timing the slaughter to coincide with the winter migration, when livers are naturally fattened.&lt;ref name="Sousa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/markets/europe/article1265675.ece|title=Login|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers outside France do not always force-feed birds to produce fattened livers considered to be foie gras, instead allowing them to eat freely, termed ''ad libitum''. Interest in alternative production methods has grown recently due to [[foie gras controversy|ethical concerns]] in gavage-based foie gras production. Such livers are alternatively termed fatty goose liver, ethical foie gras, or humane foie gras.  The British supermarket chain [[Waitrose]] also provides a version of ethical foie gras which it calls (and has been trademarked) ''faux gras''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=The Independent|date=January 13, 2012|page=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is not to be confused with the American product by the same name, produced by Regal Vegan, which has the U.S. trademark for ''faux gras'', and is actually a vegan, nut-based spread.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.regalvegan.com/site/products/faux-gras/|title=FAUX GRAS™ « the Regal Vegan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term ''ethical foie gras'' or ''humane foie gras'' is also used for gavage-based foie gras production that is more concerned with the animal's welfare (using rubber hoses rather than steel pipes for feeding). Others have expressed skepticism at these claims of humane treatment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/25/dining/25foie.html |title=Foie Gras Makers Struggle to Please Critics and Chefs |first=Jliet |last=Glass |date=April 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; as earlier attempts to produce fattened livers without gavage have not produced satisfactory results.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.fao.org/ag/againfo/themes/animal-welfare/news-detail/en/c/20463/ |title=Welfare Aspects of the Production of Foie Gras in Ducks and Geese |year=1998 |chapter=Alternative Methods of Production |page=57 |author=Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More radical approaches have been studied. A duck or goose with a [[Ventromedial nucleus|ventromedian hypothalamic]] (VMH) lesion will tend not to feel satiated after eating, and will therefore eat more than a non-lesioned animal. By producing such lesions surgically, it is possible to increase the bird's food consumption when permitted to eat ''ad libitum'', by a factor of more than two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1051/rnd:19800413 |title=Effect of induced hypothalamic hyperphagia and forced-feeding on organ weight and tissular development in Landes geese |year=1980 |last1=Felix |first1=Bernadette |last2=Auffray |first2=P. |last3=Marcilloux |first3=J.

==Preparations==
[[Image:Foie-gras.jpg|thumb|Foie gras with shallots and figs]]
Generally, French preparations of foie gras are made over low heat, as fat melts faster from the traditional goose foie gras than the duck foie gras produced in most other parts of the world. American and other New World preparations, typically employing duck foie gras, have more recipes and dish preparations for serving foie gras hot, rather than cool or cold.

In Hungary, goose foie gras traditionally is fried in goose fat, which is then poured over the foie gras and left to cool; it is also eaten warm, after being fried or roasted, with some chefs smoking the foie gras over a cherry wood fire.

In other parts of the world foie gras is served in dishes such as foie gras [[sushi]] rolls, in various forms of pasta or alongside [[steak tartare]] or atop a [[steak]] as a garnish.

===Cold preparations===
Traditional low-heat cooking methods result in [[Terrine (food)|terrine]]s, ''[[pâté]]s'', [[parfait]]s, [[foam (culinary)|foam]]s and [[mousse]]s of foie gras, often flavored with [[tuber (genus)|truffle]], mushrooms or [[brandy]] such as [[cognac]] or [[Armagnac (drink)|armagnac]]. These slow-cooked forms of ''foie gras'' are cooled and served at or below room temperature.

In a very traditional form of terrine, ''au torchon'' ("in a towel"), a whole lobe of foie is molded, wrapped in a towel and slow-cooked in a ''[[bain-marie]]''. For added flavor (from the [[Maillard reaction]]), the liver may be seared briefly over a fire of [[grape vine]] clippings (''sarments'') before slow-cooking in a bain-marie; afterwards, it is pressed served cold, in slices.

Raw foie gras is also cured in salt ("''cru au sel''"), served slightly chilled.&lt;ref name="Au Pied de Cochon"&gt;Au Pied de Cochon. Menu. Montreal. 15 June. 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

A pastry containing fatty goose liver and other ingredients is known as the "[[Strasbourg|Strasburg]] pie" since Strasbourg was a major producer of foie gras.&lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia'', ed. Daniel Coit Gilman, Harry Thurston Peck and Frank Moore. (New York: Dodd, Mead &amp; Company, 1903): Vol. XIII, 778.&lt;/ref&gt; The pie is mentioned in [[William Makepeace Thackeray]]'s novel ''Vanity Fair'' as being popular with the diplomatic corps.&lt;ref&gt;William Makepeace Thackeray, ''Vanity Fair'', Ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hot preparations===
{{nutritionalvalue | name=Pâté de foie gras, canned | kJ=1933 | fat=43.84 g | carbs=4.67 g | fiber=0.0 g | protein=11.40 g | niacin_mg=2.51 | thiamin_mg=0.088 | riboflavin_mg=0.299 | sodium_mg=697 | right=1}}
Given the increased internationalization of cuisines and food supply, ''foie gras'' is increasingly found in hot preparations not only in the United States, but in France and elsewhere. Duck foie gras ("''foie gras de canard''") has slightly lower fat content and is generally more suitable in texture to cooking at high temperature than is goose foie gras ("''foie gras d'oie''"), but chefs have been able to cook goose ''foie gras'' employing similar techniques developed for duck, albeit with more care.

Raw foie gras can be roasted, sauteed, pan-seared (''poêlé'') or (with care and attention), grilled. As foie gras has high fat content, contact with heat needs to be brief and therefore at high temperature, lest it burn or melt. Optimal structural integrity for searing requires the foie gras to be cut to a thickness between 15 and 25&amp;nbsp;mm (½ – 1&amp;nbsp;inch), resulting in a rare, uncooked center. Some chefs prefer not to devein the foie gras, as the veins can help preserve the integrity of the fatty liver. It is increasingly common to sear the ''foie gras'' on one side only, leaving the other side uncooked. Practitioners of [[molecular gastronomy]] such as [[Heston Blumenthal]] of [[The Fat Duck]] restaurant first flash-freeze foie gras in [[liquid nitrogen]] as part of the preparation process.&lt;ref name=cryo&gt;{{cite news

Hot foie gras requires minimal spices; typically black pepper, paprika (in Hungary) and salt. Chefs have used [[fleur de sel]] as a gourmet seasoning for hot foie gras to add an "important textural accent" with its crunch.&lt;ref name=sel&gt;''Nation's Restaurant News'', 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consumption===

==Animal welfare==
[[Image:Mulard duck being force fed corn in order to fatten its liver for foie gras production.jpg|thumb|250px|Gavage feeding]]
Gavage-based foie gras production is [[Foie gras controversy|controversial]] due to the animal welfare consequences of the force-feeding procedure, intensive housing and husbandry, an enlarged liver and the potential for being detrimental to human health.  Some countries find foie gras to be "morally objectionable".&lt;ref name="DeSoucey"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/0003122410372226|journal=American Sociological Review|year=2010|volume=75|issue=3|pages=432–455|title=Gastronationalism food traditions and authenticity politics in the European Union|author=DeSoucey, M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{which|date=January 2016}} One EU committee report noted that up to 1998, there was only a small number of scientific studies on the welfare of birds used for foie gras production, however, the Committee found sufficient evidence to conclude that "force-feeding, as currently practised, is detrimental to the welfare of the birds."&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;  The industry repeatedly faces accusations of torture and cruelty.&lt;ref name="DeSoucey2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=DeSoucey, M.|year=2016|title=Contested Tastes: Foie Gras and the Politics of Food|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suitability of breeds and species===
The production of foie gras occurs on the argument that migrating wildfowl seasonally eat such that their liver naturally enlarges.  However, the bird used predominantly in foie gras production is a hybrid of a male Muscovy duck and a female Pekin duck.   It has been noted that the Muscovy duck is non-migratory,&lt;ref name="Hoffmann, 1992a"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hoffmann, E.|year=1992|title=A natural history of Cairina moschata, the wild Muscovy duck.|journal= 9th International Symposium of Waterfowl|pages=217–219}}&lt;/ref&gt; and both the Pekin and the mulard hybrid cannot fly.&lt;ref name="Hoffmann, 1992b"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hoffmann, E.|year=1992|title=Hybrid progeny from Muscovy and domestic ducks|journal= 9th International Symposium of Waterfowl|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic ducks (including the Pekin) are derived from the [[mallard]] duck, which is sometimes migratory and sometimes not. Therefore, although the domestic goose might well be adapted to store food before migration, it is less likely that the Mulard hybrid duck has the same potential.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;

===Force-feeding procedure===

====Fear====
Geese and ducks show [[avoidance behaviour]] (indicating aversion) of the person who feeds them and the feeding procedure.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;  Although an EU committee in 1998 reported seeing this aversion, they noted that at the time, there was no "conclusive" scientific evidence on the aversive nature of force-feeding.&lt;ref name="EU"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ec.europa.eu/food/animal/welfare/international/out17_en.pdf |title=Report of the EU Scientific Committee on Animal Health and Animal Welfare on Welfare Aspects of the Production of Foie Gras in Ducks and Geese }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(277&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The AVMA (Animal Welfare Division) when considering foie gras production stated "The relatively new Mulard breed used in foie gras production seems to be more prone than its parent breeds to fear of people".&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;

====Injury====
An EU committee in 1998&lt;ref name="EU"/&gt; reported that there was usually clear evidence of tissue damage in the oesophagus of birds which had been gavage fed, although one 1972 study cited by the report observed no alteration of the oesophageal tissue. More recent scientific studies have shown that the esophagus of birds can be injured or inflamed by gavage feeding.&lt;ref name="Skippon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kozák"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Foie gras production: pros and cons in the light of animal protection.|
author=Kozák, J.|journal=Journal of Animal Welfare, Ethology and Housing Systems|year=2011|volume=7|issue=3|pages=200–209}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Servière"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Neurogenic inflammation in the upper digestive tract of the mule duck: effect of a chemical algogen and force-feeding|journal=British Poultry Science|volume=52|issue=6|year=2011|doi=10.1080/00071668.2011.640660|pmid=22221246|authors=Servière, J., Carriere, M., Duvaux-Ponter, C. Guy, G. and Roussel, S.|pages=792–799}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Stress====
After measuring a range of physiological parameters in male Mulard ducks, it was concluded in one study that the acute stress caused by force feeding is similar at the beginning and end of the commercial production of foie gras.&lt;ref name="Flaments"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=British Poultry Science|volume=53|issue=4|year=2012|title=Corticosterone, cortisol, triglycerides, aspartate aminotransferase and uric acid plasma concentrations during foie gras production in male mule ducks (Anas platyrhynchos × Cairina moschata)|doi=10.1080/00071668.2012.711468|pmid=23130574|author=Flamenta, A., Delleura, V., Poulipoulisa, A. and Marliera, D.|pages=408–413}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A similar study on Muscovy ducks found that gavage feeding was related to an increase in panting behaviour and serum corticosterone levels, indicating increased stress attributable to this feeding method.&lt;ref name="Mohammed"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Advanced Veterinary Research|volume=4|issue=4|year=2014|title=Force feeding as a stress factor on Muscovy ducks|author=Mohammed, A.A.A., Abdel-Rahman, M. and Darwish, M.H.A.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Housing and husbandry===
In France, at the end of 2015, individual cages were prohibited to improve animal welfare.  They will be replaced by cages which house 4 to 5 birds.&lt;ref name="Marie" /&gt;

====Behavioural restriction====
During the force-feeding period, the birds are kept in individual cages, with wire or plastic mesh floors, or sometimes in small groups on slatted floors. Individual caging restricts movements and behaviours by preventing the birds from standing erect, turning around, or flapping their wings. Birds cannot carry out other natural waterfowl behaviours, such as bathing and swimming.&lt;ref name="Skippon"/&gt;  Furthermore, ducks and geese are social animals and individual cages prevent such interactions.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;

During the force feeding period, when the birds are not being fed, they are sometimes kept in near darkness; this prevents normal investigatory behaviour and results in poor welfare.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;

====Injury====
Lesions can occur on the [[sternum]] of the birds due to [[necrosis]] of the skin.  This is observed more frequently in birds reared in cages rather than on the floor. The prevalence is higher in Mulard ducks (40–70%) compared to under 6% in Muscovy ducks.  This is due to the larger  pectoralis profundus major and minor muscles in Muscovy ducks compared to Mulards.&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;  The relatively new Mulard breed used in foie gras production seems more prone to developing lesions in the area of the sternum when kept in small cages, and to bone breakage during transport and slaughter.&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;

Where ducks are fattened in group pens, it has been suggested that the increased effort required to capture and restrain ducks in pens might cause them to experience more stress during force feeding. Injuries and fatalities during transport and slaughter occur in all types of poultry production, however, fattened ducks are more susceptible to conditions such as heat stress.

===Enlarged liver===
Foie gras production results in the bird's liver being swollen.  In some species of ducks, liver size changes seasonally, increasing by as much as 30 to 50%, with more pronounced changes in females. However, foie gras production enlarges the livers up to 10 times their normal size.&lt;ref name="Skippon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AVMA" /&gt;  This impairs liver function due to obstructing blood flow, and expands the abdomen making it difficult for the birds to breathe.&lt;ref name="AVMA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.avma.org/KB/Resources/LiteratureReviews/Pages/Foie-Gras-Production-Backgrounder.aspx#references|title=Welfare Implications of Foie Gras Production|year=2014|publisher=American Veterinary Medical Association|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Death occurs if the force-feeding is continued.&lt;ref name="Viva"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viva.org.uk/sites/default/files/2014_mini_foiegras_factsheet_1.pdf|title=Torture in a tin: Viva! foie-gras fact sheet|publisher=Viva!|year=2014|accessdate=February 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214203009/http://www.viva.org.uk/sites/default/files/2014_mini_foiegras_factsheet_1.pdf|archivedate=14 February 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EU" /&gt;

===Mortality rates===
The mortality rate in force-fed birds varies from 2% to 4%, compared with approximately 0.2% in age-matched, non-force-fed drakes.&lt;ref name="Skippon"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The animal health and welfare consequences of foie gras production.|author=Skippon, W.|journal=Canadian Veterinary Journal|year=2013|volume=54|issue=4|pages=403–404|pmc=3595949|pmid=24082171}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mortality rates do not differ between the force-feeding period and the previous rearing phase, with both being approximately 2.5%.&lt;ref name="Marie"&gt;{{cite web|title=Genetics and selection of ducks in France|author=Marie-Etancelin, C., Chapuis, H., Brun, J.M., Larzul, C., Mialon-Richard, M.M. and Rouvier, R.|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/267324850|accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
{{Further|Foie gras controversy}}
The polarising and controversial nature of foie gras production was identified in a paper that juxtaposed the views of "foie gras production as the apotheosis of murderous meat production, and those who consider it to be a co-production between humans and animals".&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The naturecultures of foie gras: techniques of the body and a contested ethics of care.|author1=Heath, D.  |author2=Meneley, A,|journal=Food, Culture and Society|volume=13|issue=3|year=2010|pages=421–452|doi=10.2752/175174410x12699432701024}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Animal rights and welfare advocates such as [[PETA]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goveg.com/feat/foie/|title=How to Go Vegan|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vegetarians' International Voice for Animals|Viva!]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.viva.org.uk/campaigns/foiegras/index.html|title=Viva! – Vegetarians International Voice for Animals&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130119003317/http://www.viva.org.uk/campaigns/foiegras/index.html|archivedate=19 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[the Humane Society of the United States]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hsus.org/farm/camp/ffa/foie_gras.html|title=Foie Gras&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=|accessdate=24 September 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622145557/http://www.hsus.org/farm/camp/ffa/foie_gras.html|archivedate=22 June 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; contend that foie gras production methods, and force-feeding in particular, constitute cruel and inhumane treatment of animals.

An [[Ipsos MORI]] poll found that 63% of the UK population would like to see a complete ban on the sale of foie gras in the UK.&lt;ref name="Milne"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/emma-milne/foie-gras-ban_b_2048704.html|publisher=The Huffington Post|title=Sixty-three per cent of the British public wants foie gras banned|author=Milne, E.|year=2012|accessdate=May 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April–May 2013, an investigator from [[Mercy for Animals]] recorded undercover video at Hudson Valley Foie Gras farm in New York state. The video showed workers forcefully pushing tubes down ducks' throats. One worker said of the force-feeding process: "Sometimes the duck doesn't get up and it dies. There have been times that 20 ducks were killed." Hudson Valley operations manager Marcus Henley replied that the farm's mortality statistics are not above average for the poultry industry.&lt;ref name=Tepper2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Tepper|first=Rachel|title=Undercover Foie Gras Footage Shot At Hudson Valley Foie Gras Alleges Cruel Practices (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/06/12/undercover-foie-gras-video-hudson-valley_n_3429492.html|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=Huffington Post|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Hudson Valley provides foie gras to Amazon.com, Mercy for Animals began a campaign urging Amazon to stop selling foie gras, a move that has already been made by [[Costco]], [[Safeway Inc.|Safeway]], and [[Target Corporation|Target]].&lt;ref name=Zara2013&gt;{{cite news|last=Zara|first=Christopher|title=Amazon Urged To Ban Foie Gras: Animal-Rights Group Calls Retailer A Lame Duck Over Controversial Food|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/amazon-urged-ban-foie-gras-animal-rights-group-calls-retailer-lame-duck-over-controversial-food|accessdate=3 April 2014|newspaper=International Business Times|date=12 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2013, the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' published a report based on the video they obtained depicting cruelty towards ducks in a farm owned by French firm Ernest Soulard, which is a supplier to celebrity chef [[Gordon Ramsay]]'s restaurants. The restaurant chain suspended purchasing from the supplier following the exposé.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/video-cruelty-chef-gordon-ramsays-2688593|title=VIDEO: Cruelty of chef Gordon Ramsay's foie gras supplier exposed in shocking footage|author=Andy Lines|date=8 November 2013|work=mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Animal research ===
The process of force-feeding can make animals sick by stressing the liver. If the stress is prolonged, excess protein may build up and clump together as amyloids, consumption of which has been found to induce [[amyloidosis]] in laboratory mice. It has been hypothesized this may be a route of transmission in humans too and so be a risk for people with inflammatory complaints such as [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/j.molmed.2010.08.004|title=Prion-like aggregates: Infectious agents in human disease|year=2010|last1=Westermark|first1=Gunilla T.|last2=Westermark|first2=Per|journal=Trends in Molecular Medicine|volume=16|issue=11|pages=501–7|pmid=20870462 |type=Review |quote=AA amyloidosis can theoretically be transmitted to humans by the same route; thus, such food might constitute a hazard for individuals with chronic inflammatory disorders such as RA.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legislation and bans ===
{{further|Foie gras controversy#Statutory and voluntary bans}}
A number of countries and regions have laws against force-feeding or the sale or importation of foie gras, and even where it is legal some retailers have ceased to sell it.&lt;ref name="AmazonUKban"&gt;{{cite web|publisher=The Bugle|url=http://issuu.com/thebugle/docs/nov_2013/10|date=November 2013|title=Amazon bans foie gras|accessdate=March 13, 2015 |registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FortnumMason"&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/dec/18/fortnum-mason-foie-gras-protest|title=Fortnum and Mason faces celebrity battle over its sale of 'cruel' foie gras |journal=The Guardian |date=18 December 2011 |accessdate=March 14, 2015|last1=Doward |first1=Jamie |last2=Owen |first2=Jemima }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="harveynichols"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/business/6930411.stm|title=Harvey Nichols bans 'cruel' pate|publisher=BBC|date=3 August 2007|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, foie gras production was banned in [[Brussels]] - the capital of Belgium, which is one of the few remaining countries that produces foie gras.&lt;ref name="Feedblix"&gt;{{cite web|title=Foie Gras production banned in Brussels|url=http://feedblix.com/foie-gras-production-banned-brussels/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170321052928/http://feedblix.com/foie-gras-production-banned-brussels/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 21, 2017|accessdate=March 26, 2017|publisher=Feedblix|date=March 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humane Foie Gras==

A more humane version of foie gras was pioneered in the Spanish region of [[Extremadura]], whereby the bird is tricked into preparing for migration rather than force-fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/jan/18/the-farmer-who-makes-ethical-foie-gras|title=The farmer who makes 'ethical' foie gras|journal=The Guardian|first=Dan|last=Barber|date=18 January 2015|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gerald Patrick "Gerry" Hemming, Jr.''' (March 1, 1937 – January 28, 2008) was a former [[U.S. Marine]], [[mercenary]] and [[Central Intelligence Agency]] operative associated with attacks on [[Cuba]] in the 1960s.

==Early background==
One of eleven children, Hemming was born in [[Los Angeles, California]] on March 1, 1937. He attended [[El Monte Union High School]] in California before joining the [[United States Marine Corps]] in 1954.

Hemming left the Marines in October 1958 and the following year traveled to [[Cuba]] where he gave help to [[Fidel Castro]] and his revolutionary forces. In January 1959 Hemming met [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] at the [[Atsugi Naval Air Station]] in Japan. Hemming complained that Oswald boasted too much about his inside knowledge. For instance, upon their first meeting; Oswald tried to impress Hemming by showing off how much he knew about Hemming's background and mission - somebody in an intelligence capacity had briefed Lee Harvey Oswald, and Oswald sort of teased Hemming with this information. So, Hemming did not particularly enjoy the company of Oswald from the start.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

Like many young Americans, including [[Frank Sturgis]], [[David Ferrie]] and Harry Dean, Hemming joined an American effort to overthrow the [[Batista]] regime through the efforts of [[Fidel Castro]]. When Castro proved to be a Communist, and subjected some Americans to firing squads, most Americans "switched sides" and this included Gerry Patrick Hemming.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}} who, in 1961, established [[Interpen]] as a means to attack and weaken the Castro regime. Other members of Interpen reportedly included Loran Hall, Roy Hargraves, William Seymour, Lawrence Howard, Steve Wilson, Howard K. Davis, Edwin Collins, James Arthur Lewis, Dennis Harber, Bill Dempsey, Dick Whatley, Ramigo Arce, Ronald Augustinovich, Joe Garman, Edmund Kolby, Ralph Schlafter, Manuel Aguilar and Oscar Del Pinto.{{citation needed|date=March 2009}}

==Interpen==
Hemming was a leader of [[Interpen]], or ''Intercontinental Penetration Force'', a group of anti-Castro guerrillas who trained at [[No Name Key]] in the early 1960s.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

Declassified FBI files show that the agency had an informer within Interpen.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} His code name was MM T-1. In one document dated June 16, 1961, it said that MM T-1 had "been connected with Cuban revolutionary activities for the past three years". One document dated May 12, 1961, claims that Allen Lushane of [[Miami, Florida|Miami]] "had made a trip to [[Texas]] to recruit Americans for some future military action against the Government of Cuba". The document adds that the "first training camp was established by Gerald Patrick Hemming with Dick Watley and Ed Colby running the camp." In an interview that he gave to [[John M. Newman]] on January 6, 1995, Hemming claimed that the FBI informer was Steve Wilson.

This group of experienced soldiers were involved in training members of the anti-Castro groups funded by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] in [[Florida]] in the early 1960s. When the government began to crack down on raids from Florida in 1962, Interpen set up a new training camp in [[New Orleans, Louisiana]].{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} When this work came to an end in 1964 Hemming was employed in the construction industry in Miami.

==Hemming and Lee Harvey Oswald==
According to [[Victor Marchetti]], he was also [[Lee Harvey Oswald]]'s case officer at then-secret [[NAF Atsugi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Spotlight'' (August 14, 1978 issue)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gerry Hemming has granted long interviews with several writers working on the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]]. These include [[Anthony Summers]] (''Conspiracy''), [[Noel Twyman]] (''Bloody Treason'') and [[John M. Newman]] (''Oswald and the CIA''). Some researchers believe that a combination of Interpen members and anti-Castro Cubans were involved in the assassination of John F. Kennedy. This included Hemming, James Arthur Lewis, Roy Hargraves, Edwin Collins, Steve Wilson, [[David Sanchez Morales]], Herminio Diaz Garcia, Tony Cuesta, [[Eugenio Martinez]], [[Virgilio Gonzalez]], Felipe Vidal Santiago and [[William "Rip" Robertson]].

==Arms trading==
Gerry Hemming was arrested on August 23, 1976 for the illegal transfer of a silencer and drug smuggling. It seems that this was the point that he began talking about his past work with the CIA. He told one reporter: "All of a sudden they're accusing me of conspiracy to import marijuana and cocaine. Hey, what about all the other things I've been into for the last 15 years, lets talk about them. Let's talk about the [[Martin Luther King]] thing, let's talk about Don Freed, [[Le Coubre]], nigger-killers in bed with the Mafia, the Mafia in bed with the FBI, and the goddamn CIA in bed with all of them. Let's talk about all the people I dirtied up for them over the years."

==1978 conviction and acquittal==
Hemming was convicted by a Miami jury of conspiracy to import marijuana. In 1978 he was sentenced to six months in prison by U.S. District Judge [[William Hoeveler]]. Hemming was released on appeal bond and the conviction was later overturned.

In August, 1978, [[Victor Marchetti]] published an article about the assassination of [[John F. Kennedy]] in the [[Liberty Lobby]] newspaper, ''[[The Spotlight]]''. In the article Marchetti argued that the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (HSCA) had obtained a 1966 CIA memo that revealed Hemming, [[E. Howard Hunt]], and [[Frank Sturgis]] had been involved in the plot to kill Kennedy. Marchetti's article also included a story that [[Marita Lorenz]] had provided information on this plot.

On April 14, 1980, Hemming was arrested and charged with drug trafficking. He was held on $200,000 bond in [[Palm Beach County, Florida]]. He claimed that he had not smuggled [[Quaaludes]], but was establishing his bona fides with drug traffickers so he could penetrate their networks. Hemming told Alan J. Weberman that he was working for [[Mitchell Werbell III]] and [[Lucien Conein]]. Hemming was sentenced to 35 years in prison with a minimum mandatory sentence of three years but the conviction was later overturned on appeal.

Hunt decided to take legal action against the [[Liberty Lobby]]. In December, 1981, he was awarded $650,000 in damages. Liberty Lobby appealed to the United States Court of Appeals. It was claimed that Hunt's attorney, [[Ellis Rubin]], had offered a clearly erroneous instruction as to the law of defamation. The three-judge panel agreed and the case was retried. This time [[Mark Lane (author)|Mark Lane]] defended the [[Liberty Lobby]] against Hunt's action.

Lane eventually discovered Marchetti’s sources. The main source was [[William Corson]]. It also emerged that Marchetti had also consulted [[James Angleton]] and [[Alan J. Weberman]] before publishing the article. As a result of obtaining depositions from [[David Atlee Phillips]], [[Richard Helms]], [[G. Gordon Liddy]], [[Stansfield Turner]], and [[Marita Lorenz]], plus a skillful cross-examination by Lane of [[E. Howard Hunt]], the jury decided in January, 1985, that Marchetti had not been guilty of libel when he suggested that John F. Kennedy had been assassinated by people working for the CIA. Lane states that during a later meeting they had, Hemming corroborated the details of the assassination which were outlined during the trial.

'''Graz Opera''' ([[German language|German]]: '''Oper Graz''') is an Austria [[opera house]] and opera company based in [[Graz]].  The orchestra of the opera house also performs concerts as the Graz Philharmonic Orchestra (''Grazer Philharmonisches Orchester'').

Opera had been performed in Graz since the 17th century, originally in a converted coach house on the [[Habsburg]] royal estates. The National Theatre (Schauspielhaus Graz), constructed in 1776, saw many early performances of [[Mozart]]'s operas, although today (after many reconstructions) it is devoted to the performances of plays.&lt;ref&gt;Grazer Opera. [http://www.theater-graz.com/oper/haus.php Kurze Geschichte der Grazer Oper (Brief History of Graz Opera)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029235846/http://www.theater-graz.com/oper/haus.php |date=2011-10-29 }} {{icon de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's first dedicated opera house and the immediate predecessor of the Graz Opera was the Thalia Theatre, adapted in 1864 from an old circus hall. Plans for a new theatre suitable to the growing size and importance of the city and intended to be a "new home for German art" were first proposed in 1887.&lt;ref&gt;Stråth (1999) pp. 236 and 240&lt;/ref&gt;

Designed by [[Ferdinand Fellner]] and [[Herman Helmer]] in the [[neo-baroque]] style, the Graz Opera was inaugurated in 1899 with a performance of Schiller's play ''[[William Tell (play)|William Tell]]'', followed a few days later by Wagner's opera ''[[Lohengrin (opera)|Lohengrin]]''. The building suffered damage during World War II bombings but was repaired and re-opened after the war. Between 1983 and 1985, it underwent a $15 million renovation which saw the installation of modern equipment and facilities without significantly changing the original exterior and interior of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Paul Hofmann | title=Even Graz Can Cut Loose | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/12/15/travel/even-graz-can-cut-loose.html | work=New York Times | date=1985-12-15 | accessdate=2011-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current ''Intendantin'' of the company is Nora Schmid, since 1 January 2015, in succession to Elisabeth Sobotka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Oper Graz: Schweizerin Schmid wird neue Intendantin | url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/klassik/1387108/Oper-Graz_Schweizerin-Schmid-wird-neue-Intendantin?from=suche.intern.portal | work=Die Presse | date=2013-04-10 | accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Past general music directors (GMD) of the company have included Niksa Bareza (1981-1990),  [[Philippe Jordan]] (2001-2004), [[Johannes Fritzsch]] (2006-2013), and [[Dirk Kaftan]] (2013-2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Dirk Kaftan neuer Chefdirigent der Grazer Oper | url=http://steiermark.orf.at/news/stories/2571692/ | work=ORF (Steiermark) | date=2013-02-15 | accessdate=2013-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the autumn of 2016, [[Oksana Lyniv]] made her first guest-conducting appearance with the company, in a production of ''[[La traviata]]''.  In February 2017, the company announced the appointment of Lyniv as its next GMD, effective with the 2017-2018 season.  Lyniv is the first female conductor to be named GMD of Graz Opera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author= | title=Oksana Lyniv wird neue Chefdirigentin der Grazer Oper | url=http://diepresse.com/home/kultur/klassik/5163783/Oksana-Lyniv-wird-neue-Chefdirigentin-der-Grazer-Oper | work=Die Presse | date=2017-02-02 | accessdate=2017-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:London theatres C16—C17, after Redwood.png|thumb|The Hope Theatre is labelled in the bottom centre of this London street map. [[:File:London theatres C16—C17, after Redwood.png|Enlarge]]]]
The '''Hope Theatre''' was one of the theatres built in and around [[London]] for the presentation of plays in [[English Renaissance theatre]], comparable to the [[Globe Theatre|Globe]], the [[Curtain Theatre|Curtain]], the [[The Swan (theatre)|Swan]], and other famous theatres of the era.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, pp. 231-2.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hope was built in 1613&amp;ndash;14 by [[Philip Henslowe]] and a partner, Jacob Meade, on the site of the old Beargarden on the [[Bankside]] in [[Southwark]], on the south side of the [[River Thames]] &amp;mdash; at that time, outside the legal bounds of the [[City of London]]. Henslowe had had a financial interest in the [[Beargarden]] (the ring for [[bear-baiting]] and similar "animal sports") since 1594; on 29 August 1613 he contracted with the carpenter Gilbert Katherens to tear down the Beargarden, and to build a theatre in its place, for a fee of £360. (After the Hope was built, it was often still called the "Beargarden" in common parlance and in the extant documentary record.)

Construction was slow, taking over a year. The Hope may have been delayed because the Globe was being rebuilt at the same time &amp;mdash; it had burned down on 29 June 1613 &amp;mdash; and two such large jobs, done simultaneously, may have taxed the personnel and resources of the "construction industry" of Southwark, such as it was at the time. (The Hope was located just to the northwest of the Globe, so that the two projects could have competed directly for men and materiel.) Also, the Hope was likely a more complex construction job, since it was designed as a dual-purpose facility from the start. The contract calls for a:

:''Plaiehouse fitt &amp; convenient in all thinges, bothe for players to playe in, and for the game''
:''of Beares and Bulls to be bayted in the same, and also a fitt and convenient Tyre house and'' 
:''a stage to be carryed and taken awaie, and to stande vppon tressels....''

So, the Hope would have required facilities for keeping animals that the Globe did not need.

Because Henslowe's original contract with Katherens survives, we know something about the specifics of the construction of the Hope, more so than for other theatres of the period. The contract states that the Hope must be built according to the pattern of the Swan, with two staircases on the outside, and the "heavens" built over the stage, without posts or supports on the stage to disrupt the audience's view &amp;mdash; a somewhat different concept from current ideas about the theatres of the period. (The Hope's stage had to be removable, to make room for the "Beares and Bulls.")

The Hope was completed and opened to the public in October 1614. On 31 October, [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[Bartholomew Fair (play)|Bartholomew Fair]]'' was acted in the Hope by the [[Lady Elizabeth's Men]]. In the printed text of his play, Jonson describes the Hope as being "as dirty as Smithfield and stinking every whit" &amp;mdash; [[Smithfield, London|Smithfield]] being the district of London dominated by the livestock market and slaughterhouses.

On Henslowe's death in 1616, his son-in-law [[Edward Alleyn]] inherited Henslowe's share in the Hope, which Alleyn then leased to Meade. The Hope remained an active facility for the coming decades. In its early years the Hope was used more for playing than animal baiting &amp;mdash; the days devoted to dramas outnumbered those devoted to animal sports by three to one. Lady Elizabeth's Men were joined by [[Prince Charles's Men]] around 1615; when the Lady Elizabeth's company left to tour the provinces in 1616, Prince's Charles's Men remained for another three years. Yet the mix of the two activities was never easy, and the actors grew more unhappy with the arrangements at the Hope as time went on. The actors left for the [[Cockpit Theatre]] in 1619, and the Hope was thereafter used for bear and bull baiting, [[Boxing|prizefighting]], fencing contests, and similar entertainments. 

The Corporation of London outlawed both play-acting and bear-baiting at the start of the [[English Civil War]] in 1642. Animal sports were suppressed by the Puritan regime in 1656. The last seven surviving bears were shot to death by a company of soldiers; the dogs and the cocks kept there were also killed.&lt;ref&gt;Durston, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt; (The [[Commonwealth of England|Commonwealth]] commander [[Thomas Pride]] was responsible for this action; in 1680 &amp;mdash; 24 years after the bears' deaths, and 22 years after Pride's &amp;mdash; an anonymous satirist composed Pride's confessional ''Last Speech...being touched in Conscience for his inhuman Murder of the Bears in the Beargarden''.)&lt;ref&gt;McMains, p. 223 n. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

By one (questionable) account, the Hope Theatre was "pulled down to make tenements, by Thomas Walker, a petticoat maker in Canon Street," on Tuesday, 25 March 1656.&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript addition to the 1631 edition of [[John Stow|Stow]] and Howes's ''Chronicle'', quoted in Halliday, p. 232, and Wheatley, Vol. 2, pp. 229-30. The addition contains errors. It states that the Hope was built in 1610. Thomas Walker was the master of [[The Clink]] Prison.&lt;/ref&gt; Yet the practice of animal sports resumed at the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660; if the Hope had been torn down, a replacement facility was soon established. The Diary of [[Samuel Pepys]] records a visit Pepys and his wife made to the Beargarden on 14 August 1666.&lt;ref&gt;Halliday, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt; The last word of animal sports at the facility dates from 12 April 1682.  By 1714, a development called Bear Garden Square had been built on the site of the old Hope.

'''Job fraud''' refers to fraudulent or deceptive activity or representation on the part of an [[employee]] or prospective employee toward an employer. It is not to be confused with ''[[employment fraud]]'', where an employer scams job seekers or fails to pay wages for work performed. There are several types of job frauds that employees or potential employees commit against employers. While some may be illegal under jurisdictional laws, others do not violate law but may be held by the employer against the employee or applicant.

== Résumé fraud ==
'''Résumé fraud''' or ''application fraud'' refers to any act that involves intentionally providing fictitious, exaggerated, or otherwise misleading information on a [[application for employment|job application]] or [[résumé]] in hopes of persuading a potential employer to hire an applicant for a job for which they may be unqualified or less qualified than other applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Combat Resume Fraud |url=http://www.inquestscreening.com/preemployment_background_Screeening_Combat_Resume_Fraud.asp |publisher=Inquest Pre Employment Screening |accessdate=2007-07-26 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070302165400/http://www.inquestscreening.com/preemployment_background_Screeening_Combat_Resume_Fraud.asp |archivedate=2007-03-02 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Depending on the nature of the offense, the type of job, and the jurisdiction where it occurs, such an act may or may not be a violation of [[criminal law]].{{cn|date=April 2018}} In any case, knowingly providing inaccurate information to an employer or potential employer, if discovered by the employer, is almost always grounds for [[Termination of employment|immediate dismissal]] from the job or else denial of that job.

=== Effects ===

Almost half (48%) of organizations with fewer than 100 staff experienced problems with [[Vetting|vetted]] employees.

39% of UK organizations have experienced a situation where their vetting procedures have allowed an employee to be hired who was later found to have lied or misrepresented themselves in their application. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onrec.com/content2/newsimages/SurveyPowerchex.pdf |title=Powerchex Annual Pre-employment Survey |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927120928/http://www.onrec.com/content2/newsimages/SurveyPowerchex.pdf |archivedate=September 27, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Demographics ===
Younger, more junior people are more likely to have a discrepancy on their CV. Someone in a junior administrative position is 23% more likely to have a discrepancy on their CV than in a managerial role. An applicant aged under 20 is 26% more likely to have a discrepancy than a 51- to 60-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dofonline.co.uk/personnel/personnel-2007/drop-in-financial-job-applicant-frauds01807.html dofonline]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081255/http://dofonline.co.uk/personnel/personnel-2007/drop-in-financial-job-applicant-frauds01807.html |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither men nor women are statistically more likely to have a discrepancy on their CV (X-squared = 0.56, df = 1, p-value = 0.46): 24% of applications submitted by women have a discrepancy compared to 26% of those for men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Jordan Lead Codices''', (or the '''Jordanian Codices'''), are a collection of [[codex|codices]] allegedly found in a cave in Jordan and first publicized in March 2011. A number of scholars and a November 2012 regional [[BBC News]] investigation have pronounced them fakes. In December 2016, a radioactivity test performed at the University of Surrey's Ion Beam Centre confirmed the old age of the lead used, but not the inscriptions. As of 2017, both the Israeli antiquities authority and the Jordanian archaeological department regard them as forgeries.

==Initial press reports and comments==
On 3 March 2011 ''[[The Jewish Chronicle]]'' ran an interview with a metallurgist named Robert Feather, who it stated was trying to authenticate a collection of 20 metal books which could be linked to the [[Kabbalah]]. These items were in the possession of an Israeli [[Bedouin]] farmer named Hassan Saeda, who claimed that they had been found by his great-grandfather in a cave a century ago. It added that a piece of leather from the find had already been carbon dated to 2,000 years ago. The article reported that the [[Israel Antiquities Authority]] (IAA) considered them inauthentic and worthless, saying the books are a "mixture of incompatible periods and styles without any connection or logic. Such forged motifs can be found in their thousands in the antiquities markets of Jordan and elsewhere in the Middle East". It added that Professor [[André Lemaire]], an [[epigraphy|epigrapher]] and director of studies at the [[École pratique des hautes études]], said the inscriptions he has seen make no sense and that it was "a question apparently of sophisticated fakes".&lt;ref name=rocker&gt;{{cite news |first=Simon |last=Rocker |url=http://www.thejc.com/judaism/judaism-features/46028/heavy-metal-secrets-a-mid-east-cave |title=Heavy metal secrets from a Mid-East Cave |work=Jewish Chronicle |date=3 March 2011 |accessdate=2 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March 2011 David Elkington issued a press release stating that a hoard of ancient books made of lead and copper, together with other artefacts, probably dating from the 1st century AD, had been found in Jordan, and that they might predate the writings of [[Paul the Apostle|St. Paul]] and that "leading academics" believed they might be as important as the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]].&lt;ref name=Elkington&gt;David Elkington, [https://www.scribd.com/doc/51540533/Lead-Plates-Press-Release Secret hoard of ancient sealed books found in Jordan]. Retrieved 2 April 2011.
&lt;/ref&gt; Elkington also stated that the items were discovered 5 years previously in a cave by a Jordanian Bedouin and smuggled into Israel, where they were at risk of sale on the black market or of destruction.&lt;ref name=Elkington/&gt; The BBC, the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and other media outlets quickly picked up the story.

Elkington stated that the find consisted of "up to 70 ring-bound books (codices) made of lead and copper. Many of them are sealed on all sides. Scrolls, tablets and other artefacts, including an incense bowl, were also found at the same site. Some of the lead pages are written in a form of archaic Hebrew script with ancient messianic symbols. Some of the writing appears to be in a form of code." In the press release he stated that his team included biblical scholars [[Margaret Barker]] and [[Philip R. Davies]].&lt;ref name=Elkington/&gt;

The [[BBC]] version of the story stated that the codices had been found in a cave in [[Jordan]] sometime between 2005 and 2007.&lt;ref name=pigott&gt;

''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' added that metallurgical analysis on the books, and carbon dating on a piece of leather found with the collection, suggested that the books could be about 2,000 years old, although it also questioned whether the find was authentic.&lt;ref name=blomfield&gt;Adrian Blomfield, [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/jordan/8414393/Jordan-vows-to-recover-artefacts-as-important-as-Dead-Sea-Scrolls.html "Jordan vows to recover artefacts as important as Dead Sea Scrolls"], Telegraph, 29 March 2011

Chris Lehmann, [https://news.yahoo.com/s/yblog_thelookout/20110330/ts_yblog_thelookout/could-lead-codices-prove-the-major-discovery-of-christian-history "Could lead codices prove ‘the major discovery of Christian history’?"], Yahoo News, 30 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Elkington, described as a "scholar of ancient religious archaeology who is heading a British team trying to get the lead books safely into a Jordanian museum", claimed that they could be "the major discovery of Christian history", and the director of the Jordan's Department of Antiquities, Ziad al-Saad, said that the books might have been made by followers of Jesus in the few decades immediately following his crucifixion.&lt;ref name=pigott/&gt;

The BBC article said that the books consist of between 5-15 leaves or plates each, about the size of a credit card, made of lead and copper, and bound together with lead rings on one side. Many of the books are also sealed with rings on the remaining three sides. Elkington reported that "In the upper square [of one of the book covers] we have the seven-branch menorah", and the text is said to be in archaic [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] script ([[Paleo Hebrew]]), and some in "code".&lt;ref name=pigott/&gt;

Davies noted the presence of a cross, tomb, and city of [[Jerusalem]] depicted in the books.&lt;ref name=pigott/&gt;

A news report described Barker as believing that if the artefacts are genuine, they could be Christian texts from as early as 33 AD.&lt;ref name=derby&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-derbyshire-12881931 |title=Derby expert examines 'ancient Christian books' |work=BBC News |date=30 March 2011 |accessdate=6 April 2011}}
&lt;/ref&gt; A BBC report stated that a line has been translated from the text as "I shall walk uprightly".&lt;ref name=pigott/&gt;

The press release&lt;ref name=Elkington/&gt; and the BBC report on 29 March 2011 indicated that the Jordanian government would make a claim for the ownership of the collection under the [[treasure-trove]] statutes of Jordanian law.

A number of experts urged scepticism until further investigation could be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;Larry Hurtado, [http://larryhurtado.wordpress.com/2011/03/29/more-on-the-lead-codices/ "More on the Lead Codices"], Larry Hurtado's Blog, 29 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.

On 31 March 2011, a letter was published online by [[Daniel C. Peterson]] which had been written in 2010 by Elkington. The letter was to Oxford academic Peter Thonemann, sending images of a "copper tablet" and asking for information regarding the Greek text inscribed on it. Thonemann replied that the item was a modern forgery, created during the last 50 years in Jordan, because the text copied a truncated tombstone inscription (AD 108/9) from the Archaeological Museum of [[Amman]].&lt;ref&gt;According to Thonemann, the inscription read, "without grief, farewell! Abgar also known as Eision."''TLS'' (8 April 2011), 15.&lt;/ref&gt; Thonemann said that he "would stake [his] career" on his belief that the material had been faked.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Peterson, 1 April 2011.

In his letter to Thonemann in 2010, Elkington said that he had been told that the codices were from Egypt, not that the material was from Jordan as stated in his press release.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Davila, ''Paleojudaica'', [http://paleojudaica.blogspot.com/2011_03_27_archive.html#7454369078247746754 HEBREW-INSCRIBED-METAL-CODICES WATCH: A FAKE]. Retrieved 2 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 2 April 2011, historian [[William J. Hamblin]] called into question the Jesus image on the tablet, stating it looked a great deal like images of Helios also found on ancient coins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hamblinofjerusalem.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/jordan-metal-plates-2-portrait-of-jesus |last=Hamblin |first=William |title=Jordan Metal Plates 2: Portrait of Jesus? |date=2 April 2011 |access-date=10 December 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110407013411/http://hamblinofjerusalem.wordpress.com/2011/04/02/jordan-metal-plates-2-portrait-of-jesus/ |archive-date=7 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2011, ''[[The Mail on Sunday]]'' published an interview with Hassan Saeda, whom it described as a Bedouin trucker, aged 37, including extra images from the material and a story of how they came into his possession. The paper made a claim that a face on one plate "could be" the face of Jesus, but gave no authority for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Nick |last=Pryer |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1372741/Hidden-cave-First-portrait-Jesus-1-70-ancient-books.html |title=Is this the first ever portrait of Jesus?

On 4 April 2011, [[Philip R.

There was no indication of whether Hassan Saeda was meant here.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thememriblog.org/blog_personal/en/36219.htm Jordanian Official: Ancient Manuscripts Discovered In Jordan Sold On Black Market To Israel Dealer], 4 April 2011.

[http://www.robert-deutsch.com/ Robert Deutsch] weighed in on 5 April, arguing that the tablets lacked patina and corrosion and, along with others, he noted that all the iconography and script appeared to come directly from coins dating to multiple periods ([[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], [[Hasmonean coinage|Hasmonean]], and [[Bar Kokhba revolt|Bar Kokhba]]) in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Deutsch|first=Robert|title=A Follow up by Robert Deutsch on the ‘Lead Codices’|url=http://zwingliusredivivus.wordpress.com/2011/04/05/a-follow-up-by-robert-deutsch-on-the-lead-codices/|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 April 2011 Peter Thonemann repeated his statements about a letter from Elkington in 2010 in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Thonemann, [http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/the_tls/article7173961.ece "The Messiah codex decoded"], Times Literary Supplement, 6 April 2011: "There are various reasons why we bother to fund research in the arts and humanities and this episode could have been one of them."&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 April ''[[The Jordan Times]]'' published an article describing the codices as a collection of 2,000-year-old manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor Luck, [http://www.jordantimes.com/?news=36138 Authorities confident old Christian manuscript smuggled to Israel, Jordan Times].

On 9 April Prof. [[James R. Davila|Jim Davila]] published the following summary on his PaleoJudaica blog:

:The Greek is lifted nonsensically from an inscription published in 1958. The forger couldn't tell the difference between the Greek letters alpha and lambda. The Hebrew script is taken from the same inscription. The Hebrew text is in "code," i.e., is gibberish. The "Jesus" face is taken from a well-known mosaic. The charioteer is taken from a fake coin.

Retrieved 27 April 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Further details appeared in ''The Jordan Times'', with further claims.&lt;ref&gt;Jim Davila, [http://paleojudaica.blogspot.com/2011_04_24_archive.html#3257234323615319033 More on the new Jordanian codices], 29 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the July 2011 issue of ''[[Palestine Exploration Quarterly]]'', [[Philip R. Davies]] published an editorial surveying some of the information surrounding the tablets, urging caution and the need for further investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Davies|first=Philip|title=Mysterious Books from Jordan|year=2011|journal=Palestine Exploration Quarterly|volume=143|issue=2|pages=79–84|publisher=Maney Publishing|doi=10.1179/003103211X12971861557115|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/maney/peq/2011/00000143/00000002/art00001|accessdate=31 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2012 updates===
On 26 November 2012, BBC News conducted a short investigation about the authenticity of the codices. This was conducted as a short 13 minute segment of ''Inside Out West'' (26/11/12) &lt;ref name="youtube.com"&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XylH2Y8n2dM], 26 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; accompanied by a written BBC News article entitled "Jordan Codices 'expert' David Elkington's claims queried".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20492489], 26 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The programme initially focused on the codices' authenticity with Peter Thonemann again affirming that "I'm as certain as it is possible to be that this entire body of codices are modern fakes. I would stake my academic reputation on it" adding that "all of the codices that have appeared in the media in the past year or so are products of the same modern workshop — they’ve all sorts of similarities in style, fabric, and content. It seems absolutely clear that every single one of these documents is a modern fake".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; A spokesman for the Israeli Antiquities Authority (IAA) noted, "They were shown to experts on the period; all the experts absolutely doubted their authenticity." Author and metals expert Robert Feather was also sceptical.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

The BBC ''[[Inside Out (2002 TV programme)|Inside Out]]'' programme shifted focus onto whether David Elkington was the right person to be testing the authenticity of the codices, analysing the true intentions, history and qualifications of the "self styled" academic. It emerged that David Elkington is not an academic and has "No recognised qualifications in the field" although previously using the title of Professor.&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;
It also emerged that Elkington is "using the codices to raise money to support him in his work"&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt; from supporters including [[Princess Elizabeth of Yugoslavia]] who has donated tens of thousands of pounds to Elkington. It also stated that Elkington plans to release a book and create a film based upon the codices and that "over the years he’s taken thousands of pounds as investment to make a film based on his theories".&lt;ref name="youtube.com"/&gt;

===2015 updates===

In March 2015 the start of the Centre for the Study of the Jordanian Lead Books, a limited not-for-profit company, was announced under the aegis of [[Richard Chartres]], Bishop of London.&lt;ref name="economist2015"/&gt;  The board is chaired by [[Margaret Barker]]  and includes two politicians, Sir [[Tony Baldry]] and [[Tom Spencer (politician)|Tom Spencer]].  Other people involved include Professor Robert Hayward, of Durham University and Professor Ziad Al Saad as co-chairs of the “evaluation panel” and Professor [[Philip R. Davies|Philip Davies]] of the University of Sheffield, Matthew Hood, Professor Bernhard Lang, Professor Yuri Stoyanov, and Samuel Zinner as other members of the evaluation panel.&lt;ref name="economist2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=A chink of light|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/erasmus/2015/03/religious-archaeology|accessdate=28 March 2017|work=The Economist|date=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CT2015"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Margaret|title=Jordan lead books' authenticity to be tested|url=https://www.churchtimes.co.uk/articles/2015/20-march/news/uk/jordan-lead-books-authenticity-to-be-tested|accessdate=26 March 2017|work=Church Times|date=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="centre-aboutus"&gt;{{cite web|title=About us|url=http://www.leadbookcentre.com/about-us.php|website=The Centre for the Study of the Jordanian Lead Books|accessdate=26 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The centre disclaims any connection to David Elkington though his wife, Jennifer Elkington was a board member for one day.&lt;ref name="centre-aboutus"/&gt;&lt;ref name="companieshouse"&gt;{{cite web|title=THE CENTRE FOR THE STUDY OF THE JORDANIAN LEAD BOOKS LIMITED - Officers (free information from Companies House)|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09705928/officers|website=Companies House|accessdate=28 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2017 updates===
On 9 March 2017, the Jordanian department of antiquities issued a statement criticizing David Elkington's activity in the country after the Ion Beam Centre's results. The department said that the information Elkington was promoting on local media and at local universities was inaccurate and lacked objectivity, and that there was no evidence to support the codices' authenticity. The Jordan Times reported that {{Quote|text=The department described the findings of David Elkington as baseless, stressing that the cave was not found and the pictures he has have nothing to do with the cave that was visited, which indicates that his insistence on the originality of the codices is groundless and not credible. Jamhawi [the antiquities department director] said that modern technology can be used to create confusion since it can use old materials and draw on it to make almost unrecognizable fake antiquities.&lt;ref name="JT2017"&gt;{{cite news|title=Antiquities agency chief says Jordan Codices fake|url=http://www.jordantimes.com/news/local/antiquities-agency-chief-says-jordan-codices-fake|accessdate=10 March 2017|language=English|work=Jordan Times|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The Elkingtons still maintain that the codices are credible and are 2000 years old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://royanews.tv/news/118619/1489065469|title=الآثار تنفي صحة ما يتم تداوله حول 'دساتير الأردن الرصاصية'|language=Arabic|work=[[Ro'ya TV]]|accessdate=9 March 2017|date=9 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JT2017"/&gt;

[[File:ModernEgypt, Khedivial Opera House, BAP 25803.jpg|thumb|240px|The Khedivial Opera House.]]
The '''Khedivial Opera House''' or '''Royal Opera House''' ({{lang-ar|دار الأوبرا الخديوية }} / [[ALA-LC]]: ''Dār Awbirā al-Khudaywī'') was an opera house in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]], the oldest opera house in all of Africa. It was inaugurated on 1 November 1869 and burned down on 28 October  1971.

The opera house was built on the orders of the [[Khedive]] [[Isma'il Pasha|Ismail]] to celebrate the opening of the [[Suez Canal]].  The architects [[Pietro Avoscani]] (from [[Livorno]]) and Rossi&lt;!--need first name--&gt; designed the building.  It seated approximately 850 people and was made mostly of wood.  It was located between the districts of [[Azbakeya]] and Ismailyya&lt;!--Do we have an article on this place?--&gt; in Egypt's capital city.

[[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s opera ''[[Rigoletto]]'' was the first opera performed at the opera house on 1 November 1869.  Ismail planned a grander exhibition for his new theatre.  After months of delay due to the outbreak of the [[Franco-Prussian War]], Verdi's new opera, ''[[Aida]]'', received its world premiere at the Khedivial Opera House on 24 December 1871.

In the early morning hours of 28 October 1971, the opera house burned to the ground.  The all-wooden building was quickly consumed, and only two statues made by [http://www.fineart.gov.eg/eng/cv/cv.asp?IDS=323 Mohamed Hassan] survived.  

After the original opera house was destroyed, Cairo was without an opera house for nearly two decades until the opening of the new [[Cairo Opera House]] in 1988.

The site of the Khedivial Opera House has been rebuilt into a multi-story concrete car garage. The square (to the south of Al Ataba metro station) overlooking the building's location, is still called Opera Square (Meidan El Opera)

Dame [[Margot Fonteyn]], DBE (18 May 1919 – 21 February 1991), stage name of Margaret Evelyn de Arias, was an English ballerina. She spent her entire career as a dancer with the [[Royal Ballet]], eventually being appointed Prima Ballerina Assoluta of the company by Queen Elizabeth. She joined the [[Vic-Wells Ballet School]] at the age of 14 and from 1935 was the prima ballerina of the company, which would later be called the Sadler's Wells Ballet and the Royal Ballet. In 1959, though still tied to the Royal Ballet, she was allowed to perform as a freelance dancer to enable her work as a guest dancer with various international companies. Though she officially retired in 1979, she occasionally appeared as a dancer through the late-1980s.{{sfn|Percival|2008}}

==Stage==
Unless otherwise stated, performances occurred at the [[Royal Opera House]] in [[Covent Garden]], London. The list is incomplete.

This article lists individual current and past [[Road protest in the United Kingdom|Road protests in the United Kingdom]] and in Ireland.

==Current protests==

===Bristol [[MetroBus (Bristol)|Metrobus]] [[M32 motorway|M32]] bus only bridge and junction===
On 1 February 2015 the protest group 'Rising Up' occupied land at Stapleton Allotments and Smallholdings, the planned site for a new motorway bus junction as part of the Bristol Metrobus North Fringe to Hengrove Project (NFHP). Building the junction and associated roads will result in a loss of [[Green Belt]] land, loss of long-held allotments (albeit with new laid plots being provided), and loss of smallholdings on some of the best soils in the country. The protesters claim that the junction is unnecessary and that buses could be routed via a suitably modified Junction 1 of the M32 at much less cost and with no loss of valuable growing land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2015/feb/02/bristol-bus-protesters-trees-european-green-capital-2015|title=Bristol bus protesters take to the trees|first=Steven|last=Morris|date=2 February 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-bristol-31088052 | work=BBC News | title=Bristol tree-top protest against Metrobus scheme | date=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Access Scheme, Kilkenny, Ireland===
[[Kilkenny Central Access Scheme]] (CAS), previously Kilkenny Inner Relief Road Scheme, is sections of new road, improvement of existing roads and junctions, and a new River Nore bridge crossing, with provisions for footpaths and cycle lanes throughout. CAS comprises 4.5 kilometers of single carriageway road that is 7.3 metres wide.

The proposed route dissects the medieval core of the old Irishtown of [[Kilkenny]], one of the most historic quarters of the city.

The campaign group called "Complete [[Kilkenny]] Ring Road as a priority over the CAS" or CKRR is holding demonstrations to gain further support for a call to rethink the CAS and demand to complete the outer ring road around [[Kilkenny]]. Several of Kilkenny’s leading figures in the areas of tourism, heritage and archaeology – as well as local residents – have come out strongly against the imminent demolition of a number of historic buildings and the altering of one of the city’s oldest streetscapes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===A14 Ellington to Fen Ditton===

===A57/A628 Mottram in Longdendale, Hollingworth and Tintwistle Bypass===
{{main|Longdendale Bypass}}
The Highways Agency (HA) have planned to provide a section of bypass (also known as the [[Longdendale Bypass]]) to tackle congestions problems in [[Mottram in Longdendale|Mottram]], [[Hollingworth]], and [[Tintwistle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Whaplode and Moulton bypass===
In May 2007, the Spalding Guardian reported again that campaigners were calling for a bypass around the Lincolnshire villages of [[Whaplode]] and [[Moulton, Lincolnshire|Moulton]] to be made a top priority.  This call followed another fatal collision on the [[A151 road]] in Moulton.  Measures which have already been taken on the road, including lower [[speed limit]]s and [[speed camera]]s, haven't stopped the increasing death toll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

 |accessdate=2008-01-21
}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current campaign to have a bypass built started in 2002.  In June 2004 the campaign group ''WRATH''' (Whaplode Residents Against Traffic Horror) was launched to lobby for the bypass.  In January 2005 ''WRATH'' submitted a proposed route for the bypass to Lincolnshire County Council.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In July 2007, ''WRATH'' organised a three-mile (5&amp;nbsp;km) protest march through the villages to publicise their campaign.  A Lincolnshire county councillor was reported to have said that there were twenty one other villages in Lincolnshire saying they had a need for a bypass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====M74 Extension====
{{see also|M74 motorway}}

[[Transport Scotland]] planned for some time to extend the [[A74(M) and M74 motorways|M74]] by five miles to link it to the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=M74 Completion |url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/headlineprojectpage.aspx?pageID=311 |publisher=Transport Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt; The M74 Extension, also known as 'M74 Completion' and 'M74 Northern Extension', extended the M74 northwards by {{convert|5|mi|km}} through the south-eastern suburbs of [[Dalmarnock]], [[Polmadie]], [[Rutherglen, Glasgow|Rutherglen]], [[Govanhill]] and the [[Gorbals]] to meet the M8 near the [[Kingston Bridge, Glasgow|Kingston Bridge]] in Glasgow on an elevated embankment. The Scottish Executive reported that the scheme will lead to a wealthier and fairer, healthier, safer and stronger, and greener future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/headlineprojectpage.aspx?pageID=707|title=M74 - Benefits|publisher=Transport Scotland|accessdate=2008-01-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214143209/http://www.transportscotland.gov.uk/headlineprojectpage.aspx?pageID=707|archivedate=14 December 2007|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, JAM74, a coalition of community, environmental and sustainable transport groups, believed the scheme will be detrimental.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jam74.org/?page_id=22|title=Resources|publisher=Jam74|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2003, the Green and Socialist MSPs joined local campaigners to stop the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3018157.stm|title=Parties unite to fight M74 plans|date=2003-05-11|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[public inquiry]] for the scheme ran from December 2003 until March 2004 and the report, not published until March 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20050327/ai_n13482480 |title=M74 verdict: not the end of the road |work=Sunday Herald |date=2005-03-27 |author=Rob Edwards |accessdate=2008-08-20 }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; recommended against the building of the road, saying that it would "be very likely to have very serious undesirable results".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/library5/transport/m74r-00.asp/|title=REPORT OF PUBLIC LOCAL INQUIRY INTO OBJECTIONS|publisher=The Scottish Government|date=2005-03-24|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transport secretary at the time, [[Nicol Stephen]], simultaneously announced that insufficient weight had been given to the economic benefits that the scheme would bring and that they would proceed with the scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/News/Releases/2005/03/24181414|title=M74 link gets go ahead|publisher=Scottish Government|date=2005-03-24|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Friends of the Earth Scotland]] said that it was "probably the worst environmental decision ever taken by the Scottish Executive" and that they would challenge the decision in court&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/4379553.stm|title=Legal threat after M74 decision|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2005-03-24|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; but then withdrew it in June 2006 on legal advice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/glasgow_and_west/5125214.stm|title=Motorway court action abandoned|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2006-06-28|accessdate=2008-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2004, the EU ruled that land on which the road was to be built should be classified as hazardous due to [[Shawfield#Toxic legacy|chromium dumps]] buried underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/scotland/3666448.stm|title=Euro ruling doubt over M74 plans|work=[[BBC News]]|date=2004-09-17|accessdate=2008-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction work started in 2008, and the road opened on 28 June 2011. The extension involved the demolition of the [[Rosebery Park]] football ground.

[[File:Airport Oslo Gardermoen - Meeting point.jpg|240px|right|thumb|A signed meeting point at the airport Oslo Gardermoen]]
A '''meeting point''', '''meeting place''', or '''assembly point''' is a geographically defined place where people meet. Such a meeting point is often a [[landmark]] which has become popular and is a convenient place for both [[tourist]]s and [[citizen]]s to meet. Examples of meeting points include public areas and facilities such as squares, statues, parks, amusement parks, railway stations, airports, etc. or officially designated and signed points in such public facilities. There is often a public sign designating an official meeting point in public facilities (see illustrations).

Especially when called an ''assembly point'', a meeting point is a designated (safe) place where people can gather or must report to during an [[emergency]] or a fire drill etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordshire.gov.uk/cms/content/fire-drill-routine-schools]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[sociology]], a meeting point is a place where a group of people meet on a regular basis, for example a group of regulars or people with a special interest or background. These meeting points are in designated private rooms, in a part of a park, or in a [[café]]. Sites like [http://meetways.com/ meetways.com] can help people find a meeting point between two addresses.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Stenmarck.JPG|right|thumb|200px|Martin Stenmarck.]] --&gt;
'''[[Melodifestivalen]] 2005''' was the selection for the 45th song to represent Sweden at the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It was the 44th time that this system of picking a song had been used. Five semifinals had taken place to select the ten songs for the final, in [[Gothenburg]], [[Linköping]], [[Skellefteå]], [[Växjö]] and a Second Chance round in [[Stockholm]]. The final was broadcast on [[SVT1]] and [[Sveriges Radio]]'s P4 network. [[Nanne Grönvall]]'s defeat was met with consternation by many people, who felt that a gap of over 150,000 votes should be enough for victory. There were even calls for SVT to scrap the jury system altogether and simply let the televotes decide the winner. For a comparison, it was noted that Grönvall had received more votes than Lena Philipsson, the popular 2004 winner. However, SVT said that there was nothing they could do about the result. Four finalists topped the Swedish charts. [[Alcazar (group)|Alcazar]] and ''Alcastar'' got to number one the week before the final, [[Jimmy Jansson]] got to the number one some weeks after that with ''Vi kan gunga'', [[Martin Stenmarck]]'s winner ''Las Vegas'' hit the top spot the week after that, while Nanne Grönvall and ''Håll om mig'' topped the charts the week after that.

==Semifinals==
The '''semifinals for Melodifestivalen 2005''' began on 12 February 2005. Ten songs from these semifinals qualified for the final on March 12, 2005. This was the fourth year that a semifinal format had been used for the competition.

The '''Parachute Music Festival''' was a [[Christian music festival]] held annually in various venues in New Zealand between 1992 - 2014 with the event being held at [[Mystery Creek Events Centre]], [[Hamilton, New Zealand]] from 2004. It was previously held at [[Totara Springs]] in [[Matamata]] and [[El Rancho, Waikanae|El Rancho]], [[Waikanae]] The festival was run by [[Parachute Music]] and usually lasted for three nights and four days. It was held the weekend before [[Auckland Anniversary Day]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://ripitup.co.nz/topic/parachute-music-festival/684] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308114204/http://ripitup.co.nz/topic/parachute-music-festival/684 |date=March 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in late January. 'Parachute' was one of the largest Christian music festivals outside of the United States and it was one of the largest multi-day festivals in the Southern Hemisphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.infonews.co.nz/news.cfm?id=31333 |title=Parachute lends a hand to NZ Women's Refuge|publisher=Infonews.co.nz|date= |accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20130223023401/http://www.stuff.co.nz/nelson-mail/entertainment/2830835/Inspirational-rock-spirit]&lt;/ref&gt; Primarily featuring musicians and guest speakers, the festival was also the longest running festival of any kind in New Zealand.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"&gt;{{cite web|author=Siena Yates|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/8161711/Christian-festival-hits-helpful-note |title=Christian festival hits helpful note|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date=2013-01-10|accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
[[File:LunchVillagecrowd.JPG|thumb|The Lunch crowd in the Village food stall area.]]

The Parachute Music Festival attracted around 25,000 people each year. The largest crowd came in 2007, with 27,813 attendees. Most people who attend stay on-site in tents and caravans, and a large village area supplies food, amenities and band merchandise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/parachute-music-festival/news/headlines.cfm?c_id=1500869 |title=Parachute Music Festival |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year artists apply to play at Parachute which gives an opportunity for musicians to have their music heard by a large audience at a popular event. Bands applying must have a pastoral reference, that is a reference from a church leader, to ensure that the core members of any act are committed Christians. In some cases individual members of a band will not be Christian but Parachute see this as a good way to involve people in the festival community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parachutefestival.com/info/faqs|title=FAQ’s &amp;#124; Parachute Music Festival 2014|publisher=Parachutefestival.com|date=|accessdate=2015-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706160638/http://www.parachutefestival.com/info/faqs/|archive-date=2015-07-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many local bands from New Zealand apply, Parachute receive applications from all over the world. Parachute Music also invite a number of headline artists each year to perform at the festival. Around 100 bands from many different genres play at Parachute each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amplifier.co.nz/news/75264/parachute-festival-applications-open.html|title=Parachute Festival Applications Open|publisher=Amplifier.co.nz|date=|accessdate=2015-07-05|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160110190927/http://www.amplifier.co.nz/news/75264/parachute-festival-applications-open.html|archive-date=2016-01-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival is aimed at a wide demographic ranging from families to teenagers. It is classified as a non-denominational Christian event, with enforced bans on drugs or alcohol and unmarried couples being discouraged from tenting together. However, a large percentage of non-Christian people do attend. Because Parachute is a [[non-denominational]] Christian festival, events such as Catholic Mass and Anglican Eucharist take place over the weekend.

The Festival is covered by most New Zealand media and is a well known event of the New Zealand summer. It has also been supported by and has been in partnerships with a number of businesses and organisations - Some examples are [[Coca-Cola]], [[Sanitarium Health Food Company|Sanitarium]], [[V (drink)|V]], [[Pepsi]], [[Vodafone New Zealand|Vodafone]] and The [[NZ Police]].

Parachute is often in partnerships with charities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.challengeweekly.co.nz/national/1998-justice-at-p12-parachute-festival-2012.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130209160317/http://challengeweekly.co.nz/national/1998-justice-at-p12-parachute-festival-2012.html |archivedate=2013-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as, [[World Vision]]. Parachute Music have been working with World Vision since 2006 to sponsor a village in Rwanda called Tubehoneza. Over the last six festivals, festival-goers have donated $303,000 to the area. This money has been used to build five water tanks, three classrooms, a maternity unit and a health centre for Tubehoneza. Also through the festival 1,900 children have been sponsored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://festival.parachutemusic.com/causes/world-vision] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111023131052/http://festival.parachutemusic.com/causes/world-vision |date=October 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parachutefestival.com/causes/tubehoneza] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208124545/http://www.parachutefestival.com/causes/tubehoneza |date=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1992, the first 'Parachute Music Festival' was staged at El Rancho Christian Holiday Camp, [[Waikanae]]. In 1995, the festival moved north to a larger venue at Totara Springs Christian Centre, [[Matamata]]. The most recent move was in 2004 to the [[Mystery Creek Events Centre]], just outside [[Hamilton, New Zealand|Hamilton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parachutemusic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=76|title=Parachute Music|date=|accessdate=2015-07-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218194128/http://www.parachutemusic.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=12&amp;Itemid=76|archivedate=2012-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The festival has remained at Mystery Creek and in 2008, Parachute Music signed a contract with Mystery Creek Events Centre that kept the festival at the venue for five more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Louise Risk &amp; Maryanne Twentyman|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/entertainment/6286569/Music-festival-competition-fierce |title=Music festival competition fierce|publisher=Stuff.co.nz|date= |accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of 2012, Parachute Music renewed this contract with Mystery Creek ensuring that Parachute would again take place at the events centre for the next five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mysterycreek.co.nz/five-year-contract-signed-parachute-music-festival/ |title=Parachute Music Festival organisers sign a five-year contract with Mystery Creek Events Centre |publisher=Mysterycreek.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706134537/http://www.mysterycreek.co.nz/five-year-contract-signed-parachute-music-festival/ |archivedate=2015-07-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Parachute Festival celebrated its 20th birthday with a large party at Mainstage and a fireworks display.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boomboom.co.nz/ParachuteMusicCaseStudy/tabid/33086/Default.aspx |title=Parachute Music 20th Birthday Fireworks |publisher=Boomboom.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150113063046/http://boomboom.co.nz/ParachuteMusicCaseStudy/tabid/33086/Default.aspx |archivedate=2015-01-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parachute saw that families were unable to attend the festival due to a tough financial climate and introduced the 'Pay What You Can Afford' initiative for the 2012 festival where punters were able to pay for a family pass and choose from a price as low as $1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ripitup.co.nz/contentitem/news-parachute-festival-offers-pay-what-you-can-afford-family-passes/2959] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120921142954/http://ripitup.co.nz/contentitem/news-parachute-festival-offers-pay-what-you-can-afford-family-passes/2959 |date=September 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar programme under the same name was introduced for the 2013 festival where people were able to donate money to a 'Pay What You Can Afford' account and for every $200 raised, a family were able to attend the festival for free.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=1246 |title=Givealittle - Home |publisher=Fundraise.givealittle.co.nz |date= |accessdate=2015-07-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140720193909/http://fundraise.givealittle.co.nz/?p=1246 |archivedate=2014-07-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mystery Creek Events Centre began a long-term major redevelopment in 2012, so limited gate access and venue space is available for the festival. For the first time in the festival's history, ticket numbers were capped off at 17,500 weekend passes and 1,500 day passes. After launching a festival app for Android and Apple devices in 2012,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifefm.co.nz/index.php/music-news/item/197-parachute-2012-app] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130208035403/http://www.lifefm.co.nz/index.php/music-news/item/197-parachute-2012-app |date=February 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Parachute Festival will also launch technology where one can buy items at festival by scanning a festival wristband instead of paying with cash or cards in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.parachutemusic.com/events/parachute-2013] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120718192535/http://www.parachutemusic.com/events/parachute-2013 |date=July 18, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, Parachute also restructured the festival to run as a 'three-day' event, rather than a four-day event which it has done in the past. This means that nothing will be programmed after midnight on Sunday but festival-goers will still be able to leave at their leisure on Monday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nzmusic.org.nz/news/artist/parachute-festival-2013-important-announcements/ |title=Parachute Festival 2013 Important Announcements|publisher=Nzmusic.org.nz|date=2012-07-17|accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2013, Parachute became New Zealand's longest running festival, having been running its festival annually for 23 years.&lt;ref name="stuff.co.nz"/&gt;

On March 27, 2014 Parachute Music released a statement on its Facebook and its website announcing that Parachute Music Festival would no longer be running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parachutefestival.com/ |title=Parachute Music Festival 2014|publisher=Parachutefestival.com|date= |accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The closing set at the final Parachute was performed by local metalcore/hardcore band East of Eden.

In 2015 the multi-day [[Festival One]] will replace Parachute Festival in Mystery Creek, (and the single-day [[Cloud Festival]] in [[Auckland]]). These events feature many of the same artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifefm.co.nz/music/item/382-festival-one-2015 |title=Festival One 2015 Announced|publisher=Lifefm.co.nz|date= |accessdate=2015-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popular local bands have played Parachute as 'local Headliners.' In past festivals the line up has included the likes of [[Mumsdollar]], [[Steriogram]], [[The Lads]], [[Brooke Fraser]], [[juliagrace]], [[Kingston (band)|Kingston]], [[Ruby Frost]], [[Late 80's Mercedes]], The Glory Sea, and many others. Often Australian bands are put on the 'local Headliner' list.

In mid-2012, Parachute Music ran a competition to find a local band that would open the 2013 festival. A judging panel chose five bands that had entered and the decision was left to be made by public vote. The winner of this competition was hardcore band Saving Grace, from [[Gisborne, New Zealand|Gisborne]]. Saving Grace will be the first to play on Parachute's Mainstage for the 23rd festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parachutemusic.com/news/local-news/1071-the-opener |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907060004/http://www.parachutemusic.com/news/local-news/1071-the-opener |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 September 2012 |title=Parachute Music |work=parachutemusic.com |accessdate=5 July 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Parachute introduced the 'Rewired Dance Parties' to the Palladium stage.

=== Cancellations ===
* [[Hawk Nelson]] were scheduled to play in 2007 and 2008 but double bookings prevented them from making it.
* [[Flyleaf (band)|Flyleaf]] were scheduled to play in 2011 but due to a band member's pregnancy, they had to pull out of the festival. [[Elemeno P]] replaced Flyleaf which caused some controversy over Elemeno P not being 'Christian' enough.&lt;ref name="TVNZ_4007983"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://tvnz.co.nz/entertainment-news/elemeno-p-not-christian-enough-parachute-4007983 |title=Elemeno P not Christian enough for Parachute? |date=26 January 2011 |work=[[One News (New Zealand)|One News]] |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Former stages===
[[File:ParachuteMainstage.jpg|thumb|Parachute Festival's Mainstage in 2007]]

Parachute Festival's mainstage is often given a new look and in 2009, Parachute Music used a completely new mainstage for the festival. The mainstage used from 2009-2011 was New Zealand's largest concert stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.camelspace.com/product_detail.php?product=parachute#photos|title=Camelspace Products &amp; Services|work=camelspace.com|accessdate=5 July 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811143138/http://camelspace.com/product_detail.php?product=parachute#photos|archive-date=2015-08-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2012 festival saw a refreshed version of the former mainstage used at previous festivals. The mainstage currently used is a trailer that converts into a large stage and it is called 'Sam.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/waikato-times/news/8210173/Hundreds-of-lights-shine-at-Parachute |title=Hundreds of lights shine at Parachute|work=Stuff|accessdate=5 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the past the festival has had up to nine stages running at one time. Notable former stages include:
* Debut Stage - In 2010 the Debut Stage was replaced and changed to The Apollo.
* The Dome - In 2010 The Dome was demolished by Mystery Creek Events Centre.
* Massive - This stage hosted mostly dance crews, R&amp;B and hip-hop artists. Massive was integrated into the Palladium stage programme in 2012, and then returned on 2014.
* The Hangar/White Elephant - This stage was the home to acoustic performances and was integrated into the Deluxe stage programme in 2012.
* The Cage - This stage was run when the festival was hosted in Matamata.

Various other stages have appeared at festival in the past.

At the 2000 and 2001 Parachute Festivals, there was also a separate 'festival within a festival' dedicated to electronic and dance music in its various forms. This N'Dorphin Village was created by members of Dance Generation and featured continuous DJing and live electronica acts, along with urban dance culture elements such as break dancing performances and live Hip Hop.

'''''Presence''''' is the third full-length [[play (theatre)|play]] by Scottish playwright [[David Harrower]].  It portrays a fictionalised account of [[the Beatles]]' first residency in Hamburg.

==Plot==
[[Pete Best]], [[George Harrison]] and [[Paul McCartney]] share a room as they play the Indra Club ([[John Lennon]] and [[Stuart Sutcliffe]] are [[Unseen character|off-stage characters]]).  Pete, newly joined to the group, is shown as an outsider, the diffident George, the youngest of the group, contrasts to the domineering Paul.  The play ends as George is arrested for being out after the curfew imposed on minors in Hamburg (in real life he had lied to the German authorities about his age in order to be allowed to stay in Hamburg).  The group play to dwindling audiences until Paul, angry at the band's lack of success and at being told that club owner [[Bruno Koschmider]] was in the [[Panzer division]], begins sending up [[Nazism]] – wearing jackboots and crying “Sieg Heil” – which attracts a young audience to the club.  That the Beatles are reported actually to have done this, coupled with Harrower's desire to write about the dynamics of a [[Musical ensemble|band]] were the origins of the play.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2001/apr/18/artsfeatures Brian Logan meets playwright David Harrower]&lt;/ref&gt;  The play alludes to events that followed this – Pete and Paul raised a small fire in their room – by having an older German woman, whose knowledge of the Nazi past counterpoints the young men's ignorance, set fire to a jacket hanging on the wall.

==Stage history==
The play's première was at London's [[Royal Court Theatre|Royal Court]], at the smaller 60-seat Theatre Upstairs, on 19 April 2001.  The director was James Kerr,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/presence/?tab=0 Royal Court production page]&lt;/ref&gt; the designer was Rae Smith, the assistant director was [[Nina Raine]], company voice work was by [[Patsy Rodenburg]].

The cast was:

George – [[Ralf Little]]&lt;br&gt;Paul – [[William Ash (actor)|William Ash]]&lt;br&gt;Pete – [[Michael Legge (actor)|Michael Legge]]&lt;br&gt;Marian – [[Sarah Woodward]]&lt;br&gt;Elke – [[Christine Tremarco]]

The production received mixed to good reviews.&lt;ref&gt;[https://variety.com/2001/legit/reviews/presence-1200468225/ Variety review]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/1304749.stm Reviews round-up]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalcourttheatre.com/whats-on/presence/?tab=4 Royal Court reviews page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sacatepéquez''' ({{IPA-es|sakateˈpekes}}) was a city in [[Guatemala]] from November 21, 1542 until July 29, 1773 when it was destroyed by the [[Santa Marta earthquake]]. Sacatepéquez means ''grasshill'' and gave its name to the [[departments of Guatemala|department]] of [[Sacatepéquez (department)|Sacatepéquez]].

Sacatepéquez and [[Antigua Guatemala]] were the two municipalities belonging to the department of [[Chimaltenango (department)|Chimaltenango]].

On September 12, 1839, the department of Sacatepéquez was created, getting its name from the former city. [[Antigua Guatemala]] was made the capital.

'''Sanford Ballard Dole''' (April 23, 1844 – June 9, 1926) was a [[lawyer]] and [[jurist]] in the [[Hawaiian Islands]] as a [[Kingdom of Hawaii|kingdom]], [[Provisional Government of Hawaii|protectorate]], [[Republic of Hawaii|republic]] and [[Territory of Hawaii|territory]].  A descendant of the American missionary community to Hawaii, Dole advocated the [[westernization]] of Hawaiian government and culture. After the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii|overthrow of the monarchy]], he served as the [[Republic of Hawaii#Politics|President of the Republic of Hawaii]] until his government secured Hawaii's [[Annexation of Hawaii|annexation]] by the [[United States]].

==Early years==
Dole was born April 23, 1844 in [[Honolulu]] to [[Protestant]] [[Christian]] [[missionary|missionaries]]  from [[Maine]] in the [[United States]]. His father was [[Daniel Dole]] (1808–1878), principal at [[Punahou School]] and his mother was Emily Hoyt Ballard (1808–1844).   His mother died from complications within a few days of his birth. Dole was named after his uncle, Sandford K. Ballard, who was a classmate of his father's at [[Bowdoin College]] (and brother of his mother) who died in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nehemiah Cleaveland |author2=Alpheus Spring Packard |title=History of Bowdoin college: With biographical sketches of its graduates, from 1806 to 1879, inclusive |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pK4WAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA487 |year=1882 |publisher=J. R. Osgood &amp; Company |page=487}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was nursed by a [[native Hawaiian]], and his father married Charlotte Close Knapp in 1846. In 1855 the family moved to [[Koloa, Hawaii|Kōloa]] on the island of [[Kauai|Kaua{{okina}}i]], where they operated another school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Portraits of American Protestant missionaries to Hawaii |author= Hawaiian Mission Children's Society |url= https://archive.org/details/portraitsofameri00hawarich |year=1901 |location=Honolulu |publisher=Hawaiian gazette company |page= 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dole attended Punahou school for one year, and then [[Williams College]] in 1866–1867. He worked in a law office in [[Boston]] for another year, and although he never attended law school, he received an honorary [[LL.D.]] degree from Williams in 1897.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Williams College |title=General catalogue of the officers and graduates of Williams college, 1905 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YRJBAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA178 |year=1905 |publisher=The College |page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In December 1880 he was commissioned as a [[Notary Public]] in [[Honolulu]].
Dole won the 1884 and 1886 elections to the [[legislature of the Hawaiian Kingdom]] as a representative from Kaua{{okina}}i.&lt;ref name="off"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole,%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |title= Dole, Sanford Ballard office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 9, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120306203149/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASHb5a9/8f7a506f.dir/Dole%2C%20Sanford%20Ballard.jpg |archivedate= March 6, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bayonet Constitution==
In June 1887 local businessmen, [[sugar cane|sugar]] planters and politicians backed by the [[Honolulu Rifles]] forced the dismissal of the cabinet of controversial [[Walter M. Gibson]] and forced the adoption of the [[1887 Constitution of the Kingdom of Hawaii]]. The new documents limited voting rights exclusively to only the literate males of the following populations: Hawaiian, European, and American descent...while imposing income and wealth requirements to be eligible to vote for the House of Nobles, thus, effectively consolidating power among only the elite residents of the island.  In addition, the new Constitution minimized the power of the Monarch in favor of more influential governance by the cabinet. Dole and other lawyers of American descent drafted this document, which became known as the "Bayonet Constitution".&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;{{cite book |author=David W. Forbes |title=Hawaiian national bibliography, 1780-1900 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jAuzOipG26YC&amp;pg=PA232 |year=2003 |publisher=University of Hawaii Press |isbn=978-0-8248-2636-9 |pages=232–233}}&lt;/ref&gt;

King [[Kalākaua]] appointed Dole a justice of the [[Supreme Court of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] on December 28, 1887, and to a commission to revise judiciary laws on January 24, 1888. After Kalākaua's death, his sister [[Liliuokalani|Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani]] appointed him to her [[Privy Council]] on August 31, 1891.&lt;ref name="off"/&gt;

==End of the monarchy==

The monarchy ended on January 17, 1893 after the [[Overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaii]] organized by many of the same actors involved in the 1887 revolt. Although Dole declined to officially be part of the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] on January 16, he helped draft their declaration.&lt;ref name="kingdom3"&gt;{{cite book |title=Hawaiian Kingdom 1874-1893, the Kalakaua Dynasty |author= [[Ralph Simpson Kuykendall]] |url= http://www.ulukau.org/elib/cgi-bin/library?c=kingdom3&amp;l=en |volume=3 |publisher= University of Hawaii Press |year= 1967 |isbn= 978-0-87022-433-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|589}}

Dole was named president of the [[Provisional Government of Hawaii]] that was formed after the coup, and was recognized within 48 hours by all nations with diplomatic ties to the Kingdom of Hawaii, including the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;http://morganreport.org/mediawiki/index.php?title=DIPLOMATIC_RECOGNITION_OF_THE_PROVISIONAL_GOVERNMENT&lt;/ref&gt;
His cabinet (called the "executive council") included  [[James A. King]] as minister of the interior,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH01b6/64ba22f9.dir/King,%20James%20A.jpg |title= King, James A. office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 10, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120320235831/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH01b6/64ba22f9.dir/King,%20James%20A.jpg |archivedate= March 20, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dole acted as minister of foreign affairs himself until February 15, 1894.&lt;ref name="off"/&gt;
Later [[Samuel Mills Damon]] would serve as minister of finance.&lt;ref name="finance"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH5cb6.dir/doc.pdf |title= Minister of finance office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 10, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120403155718/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH5cb6.dir/doc.pdf |archivedate= April 3, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[Grover Cleveland]]'s election as President of the United States, the Provisional Government's hopes of annexation were derailed for a time. Indeed, Cleveland tried to directly help reinstate the monarchy, after an investigation led by [[James Henderson Blount]]. The [[Blount Report]] of July 17, 1893, commissioned by President Cleveland, concluded that the [[Committee of Safety (Hawaii)|Committee of Safety]] conspired with U.S. ambassador [[John L. Stevens]] to land the [[United States Marine Corps]], to forcibly remove Queen Lili{{okina}}uokalani from power, and declare a Provisional Government of Hawaii consisting of members from the Committee of Safety.

On November 16, 1893, [[Albert Willis]] presented the Queen with Cleveland's request that she grant amnesty to the Revolutionists in return for reinstatement. . Willis was to try to regain the throne for Liliuokalani on the condition that she give amnesty to the insurrectionists. She told him no, stating that the revolutionaries should be Punished and their properties and lands taken away from them.  Willis said--and she later denied--that she suggested that they ought to be  beheaded.  Liliuokalani's position lost her the goodwill of the Cleveland administration, which thereupon recognized the Republic of Hawaii on July 4, 1894.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Warren Zimmermann|title=First Great Triumph: How Five Americans Made Their Country a World Power|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_TPg3gNPWqQC&amp;pg=PA290|year=2004|publisher=Farrar, Straus and Giroux|page=290}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The [[Morgan Report]] of February 26, 1894, concluded that the overthrow was locally based, motivated by a history of corruption of the monarchy, and that American troops only served to protect American property and citizens and had no role in the end of the Hawaiian Monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Andrade Jr., Ernest |title=Unconquerable Rebel: Robert W. Wilcox and Hawaiian Politics, 1880-1903 |publisher=University Press of Colorado |year=1996 |isbn=0-87081-417-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Provisional Government held a constitutional convention and on July 4, 1894, established the [[Republic of Hawaii]].
[[File:President Dole and his Cabinet.jpg|thumb|President Dole and the Cabinet of the Republic]]

==President of the republic==
[[Lorrin A. Thurston]] declined the presidency of the republic, and Dole was chosen to lead the government instead.  Dole would serve as the first and only president from 1894 to 1898. Dole in turn appointed Thurston to lead a lobbying effort in [[Washington, DC]] and secure Hawai{{okina}}i's annexation.
Dole was successful as a diplomat – every nation that recognized the Kingdom of Hawaii also recognized the republic.

Dole's government weathered several attempts to restore the monarchy, including an attempted armed rebellion, the January 24, 1895 [[1895 Counter-Revolution in Hawaii|counter-revolution]].
Leader [[Robert William Wilcox]] and the other conspirators were captured and sentenced to death, but had their sentences reduced or commuted by Dole. The Queen abdicated and, under duress, swore allegiance to the Republic of Hawaii in February. While under arrest, she wrote, "I hereby do fully and unequivocally admit and declare that the Government of the Republic of Hawaii is the only lawful Government of the Hawaiian Islands, and that the late Hawaiian monarchy is finally and forever ended, and no longer of any legal or actual validity, force or effect whatsoever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Sanford B. Dole and Harold M. Sewall (PPWD-8-3-009).jpg|thumb|right|Dole, on left, continued as Governor of the new [[Territory of Hawaii]] after the [[Hawaiian Organic Act]] of 1900.]]

==Governor and federal judge==
In March 1899 [[Henry Ernest Cooper]], who had been chairman of the Committee of Safety in 1893, became attorney general.&lt;ref name="atty"/&gt;
[[William McKinley|President William McKinley]] appointed Dole to become the first [[Territory of Hawaii#Organic Act|territorial governor]] after U.S. annexation of Hawaii, and the [[Hawaiian Organic Act]] organized its government. Dole assumed the office on June 14, 1900 but resigned November 23, 1903 to accept an appointment by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] as judge for the  [[United States District Court for the District of Hawaii|US District Court]] after the death of [[Morris M. Estee]]. He served in that post until December 16, 1915, and was replaced by [[Horace Worth Vaughan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book  |editor= Elizabeth H.

He also served on commissions for Honolulu parks, and the public archives.&lt;ref name="off"/&gt;
He died after a series of strokes on June 9, 1926. His ashes were interred in the cemetery of [[Kawaiahao Church|Kawaiaha{{okina}}o Church]].&lt;ref name="cem"&gt;{{cite web |title= Mission Houses Cemetery, Honolulu, Hawaii |author= William Disbro |date= November 6, 2001  |url= http://files.usgwarchives.net/hi/honolulu/cemeteries/mission.txt |accessdate= September 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family and legacy==
[[File:Sanford B. Dole and family-restored.jpg|thumb|Dole with family members.]]
His cousin [[Edmund Pearson Dole]] (1850–1928) came to Hawaii to practice as a lawyer in 1895, and became [[Attorney General of Hawaii]] from 1900 to 1903.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH016e/e1eb7f48.dir/Dole,%20Edmund%20Pearson.jpg |title= Dole, Edmund Pearson office record |work= state archives digital collections |publisher= state of Hawaii |accessdate= September 3, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20120403155901/http://archives1.dags.hawaii.gov/gsdl/collect/governme/index/assoc/HASH016e/e1eb7f48.dir/Dole%2C%20Edmund%20Pearson.jpg |archivedate= April 3, 2012 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Sanford Dole was the cousin once removed of [[James Dole]] who came to Hawaii in 1899 and founded the [[Hawaiian Pineapple Company]] on [[Oahu]], which later became the [[Dole Food Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= James Drummond Dole "The Pineapple King" |date= April 2008 |publisher= Roxbury Latin School |work= Jamaica Plain Historical Society |url= http://www.jphs.org/people/2005/4/14/james-drummond-dole-the-pineapple-king.html |accessdate= September 9, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
James' father [[Charles Fletcher Dole]] also came to Hawaii in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Patriot Dole |newspaper= The Friend |location= Honolulu |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m-HkAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA9-PA3 |date= March 1906 |volume= LXVI |number=3 |page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dole Middle School]], located in [[Kalihi|Kalihi Valley]] on the island of [[Oahu|O{{okina}}ahu]], was named after him in April 1956, about a century after his father founded the school in Kōloa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Sanford Ballard Dole |date= April 23, 1956 |work= Dole Middle School web site |url= http://www.dolemiddle.k12.hi.us/GDole.html |accessdate= September 9, 2010 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110307080516/http://www.dolemiddle.k12.hi.us/GDole.html |archivedate= March 7, 2011 |df=  }} (Dedication speech)&lt;/ref&gt;
In the film ''[[Princess Kaiulani (film)|Princess Kaiulani]]'', his role was played by [[Will Patton]].

In Hawaiian, the pale and hair-like [[Spanish moss]] is called ''ʻumiʻumi-o-Dole'', meaning "Dole's beard".

[[File:Sejm cross.JPG|thumb|right|The Sejm cross]]
'''The Sejm cross''' is a [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] [[crucifix]] in the building of the [[Sejm of the Republic of Poland]], the lower house of the [[National Assembly (Poland)|Polish parliament]].

The Sejm cross hangs above the door on the left-hand side of the rostrum in the Sejm Plenary Hall. It was hung there by a [[Solidarity Electoral Action]] (AWS) MP [[Tomasz Wójcik]] and his colleague in the night between October 19 and 20 1997, shortly after the AWS and the [[Freedom Union (Poland)|Freedom Union]] signed a coalition agreement. The cross was a gift from the mother of Fr. [[Jerzy Popieluszko]], priest and martyr murdered by the [[Służba Bezpieczeństwa]] ([[Communism in Poland|communist]] [[political police]]) in 1984.

The [[spokesman]] of the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] (SLD) protested against the presence of the cross in the Sejm, saying that it was hung there in order to provoke a brawl. Other opponents called it a violation of the [[Constitution of the Republic of Poland|Constitution]] (which came into effect two days before the act) which states that the Republic of Poland is neutral in religious matters. Nobody disputed the fact that the hanging of the cross was illegal - Wójcik got into the Sejm chamber without any approval and other MPs had never discussed about that topic before. Nonetheless the cross has been hanging in the chamber ever since - even when the [[Democratic Left Alliance]] won the elections in 2001.

In 2011 the Chancellery of the Sejm commissioned and published &lt;ref&gt;[http://orka.sejm.gov.pl/WydBAS.nsf/0/0DC22C91A8C6184AC12579CD00398EBD/$file/ZP_32_1.pdf Legal opinions on the request of the Palikot Movement Parliamentary Club regarding the removal of the Latin cross located in the Plenary Hall of the Sejm (in Polish, "Zeszyty Prawnicze Biura Analiz Sejmowych" No 4/2011, p. 53-112)]&lt;/ref&gt; four legal opinions concerning the presence of the cross in the Sejm Plenary Hall.

'''Teatro Real''' (Royal Theatre) or simply ''El Real,'' as it is known colloquially, is a major [[opera house]] located in [[Madrid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.timeout.com/madrid/music/venue/13686/teatro-real| title=Teatro Real (Timeout Madrid)| accessdate=2009-01-31| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090905063729/http://www.timeout.com/madrid/music/venue/13686/teatro-real| archivedate=2009-09-05| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Teatro Real, Madrid's premier opera house"&gt;{{cite web |author= | publisher=gomadrid.com | url=http://www.gomadrid.com/sights/teatro-real.html| title=Teatro Real, Madrid's premier opera house  | accessdate=2009-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded in 1818 and inaugurated on 19 November 1850, it closed in 1925 and reopened in 1997 with a capacity of 1,746 seats. Today, the Teatro Real opera is one of the great theaters of Europe and its seasons are home productions involving leading figures of the international singing, musical direction, stage direction and dance. The theater also offers guided tours in several languages, including the auditorium, stage, workshops and rehearsal rooms.

==History==
Founded by King [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]] in 1818, and after thirty-two years of planning and construction, a Royal Order on 7 May 1850 decreed the immediate completion of the "Teatro de Oriente" and the building works were finished within five months. The Opera House, located just in front of the [[Palacio Real]], the official residence of the Queen who ordered the construction of the theatre, [[Isabella II of Spain|Isabel II]], was finally inaugurated on 19 November 1850, with [[Gaetano Donizetti|Donizetti's]] ''[[La Favorite]]''.&lt;ref name="Teatro Real, Madrid's premier opera house"/&gt;  In 1863, [[Giuseppe Verdi]] visited the theatre for the Spanish premiere of his ''[[La Forza del Destino]]''. In 1925, the ''[[Ballets Russes]]'' of [[Sergei Diaghilev|Diaghilev]] performed in the theatre with the presence of [[Vaslav Nijinsky|Nijinsky]] and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]].&lt;ref name="Teatro Real, Madrid's premier opera house"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/histesp/monumentos/192.htm | title=Ficha Teatro Real de Madrid | language=spanish | accessdate=2009-01-31 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081014162800/http://www.artehistoria.jcyl.es/histesp/monumentos/192.htm | archivedate=2008-10-14 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cultural Institutions: Teatro Real"&gt;{{cite web |author= | publisher=esMADRID.com | url=http://www.esmadrid.com/en/portal.do?IDM=440&amp;NM=3&amp;TR=C&amp;IDR=653 | title=Cultural Institutions: Teatro Real  | accessdate=2009-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1867 it housed the [[Madrid Royal Conservatory]] until 1925 when a Royal Order of 6 December called for eviction owing to the damage that the construction of the [[Metro de Madrid]] had caused to the building. Despite its closure, the government always contemplated the possibility of restoring it, ordering numerous projects, such as the architect Urdanpilleta Flórez, who raised a pharaonic remodeling of the building. However, financial difficulties prevented the completion of these projects and led to a simple restoration, sponsored by the [[Juan March Institute]], and carried out first by the architect Manuel Gonzalez Valcárcel, and later by architects Miguel Verdú Belmonte and Francisco Rodriguez Partearroyo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=RswXAQAAIAAJ&amp;dq=teatro+real+de+madrid%22+Miguel+Verd%C3%BA%22&amp;q=%22Miguel+Verd%C3%BA%22 | title=El Teatro Real| isbn=9788477825203| author1=Herrero| first1=Maira| last2=Partearroyo| first2=Francisco Rodríguez de| last3=Mora| first3=Domi| year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/?id=hzlysxzdNKQC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=%22Francisco+Rodriguez+Partearroyo%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Francisco%20Rodriguez%20Partearroyo%22&amp;f=false | title=El Teatro Real de Madrid: teatro de la ópera| isbn=9788489365728| year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre reopened in 1966 as a concert hall as well as the main concert venue for the [[Spanish National Orchestra]] and the [[RTVE Symphony Orchestra]]. The reopening was celebrated with a concert of the Spanish National Orchestra conducted by [[Rafael Frühbeck de Burgos]], and the [[Orfeón Donostiarra]]. In 1969, the 14th ''[[Eurovision Song Contest]]'' was held at the theatre, featuring an onstage metal sculpture created by surrealist Spanish artist [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref name="Teatro Real, Madrid's premier opera house"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cultural Institutions: Teatro Real"/&gt;

==Remodeling== 
[[File:Teatro Real Madrid royal box.jpg|thumb|left|220px|the royal box of the theatre.]]
In the 1990s, the house was remodeled to host [[opera]] again. The building was completed in late 1995, then the process of technical, administrative, artistic and functional organization began which led to the opening of the theatre in 1997. The remodeling was based on the old classical style of opera house with only basic modernization leaving many seats without a view of the stage. A considerable percentage of seats have a limited or zero view of the stage and a live stream of operas and ballets is projected on the upper side walls of the house so that the entire audience can follow the performance regardless of their view of the stage.

The first opera program performed for the reopening was [[Manuel de Falla]]’s ''[[El sombrero de tres picos]]'' and ''[[La vida breve]]'', which was immediately followed by the world premiere of Spanish composer [[Antón García Abril]]'s ''Divinas Palabras'' (actually commissioned to open the house) with [[Plácido Domingo]] in the cast.&lt;ref name="Cultural Institutions: Teatro Real"/&gt; The company staged the first modern revival of [[Vicente Martín y Soler]]'s ''[[Il burbero di buon cuore]]'' in 2007, and the world premiere of [[Philip Glass]]' opera ''[[The perfect American]]'' in 2013.

==Productions==
The theatre stages around seventeen opera titles (both own productions and co-productions with other major opera houses in Europe and South America) per year, as well as two or three major ballets and several recitals, from September to July.&lt;ref name="Teatro Real, Madrid's premier opera house"/&gt;

The most popular operas at the Teatro Real have included [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Rigoletto]]'' (given 387 performances),  followed by ''[[Aida (opera)|Aida]]'' with 361 and ''[[Il trovatore]]'' with 342.  Two works by [[Meyerbeer]] ''[[L'Africaine]]'' (with 268) and ''[[Les Huguenots]]'' (with 243) have been shown to draw audiences, although the former work has not been performed since the 1920s, being no longer considered mainstream repertory. Donizetti's ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'' has been given some 218 performances since its debut in the house in 1919.

===Bicentenary===
The Teatro Real has been celebrating its bicentenary with a special programme beginning in 2016. One of the operas featured was Bellini's ''[[I Puritani]]'', a co-production with the [[Municipal Theatre of Santiago|Teatro Municipal of Santiago]], Chile. A performance of this work was streamed in July 2016 via the Teatro Real's [[Facebook page]],&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.abc.es/cultura/musica/abci-opera-puritani-retransmitira-directo-facebook-201607121530_noticia.html | title=La ópera "I puritani" se retransmitirá en directo en Facebook | work=[[ABC (newspaper)|''ABC'']] | accessdate=17 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example of the theatre extending its reach by digital services.  The event was also relayed to a number of venues and was a national [[trending topic]] on Twitter. The same production has been performed by the company (including orchestra and chorus) on August 2017 at the [[Savonlinna Opera Festival]].

For the 2017/18 Season (20 years from the reopening), some of the most popular opera titles on the Theatre's history have been scheduled: [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'', [[Puccini]]'s ''[[La bohème]]'', [[Donizetti]]'s ''[[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' or [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Aida]]'', alongside with other rare operas, as [[Zimmermann]]'s ''[[Die Soldaten]] or [[Britten]]'s ''[[Gloriana]]''.

==Company==
The orchestra of the Teatro Real is the [[Orquesta Sinfónica de Madrid]]. The current artistic manager is [[Joan Matabosch]], former director of [[Liceu|Gran Teatre del Liceu]] in [[Barcelona]].
From 2015, the Music Director is the British conductor [[Ivor Bolton]], and [[Pablo Heras-Casado]] is Principal Guest Conductor.

==Tours of the building==
The Opera House offers daily different types of guided tours, lasting between 50 and 90 minutes and given in various languages. This gives the public the opportunity to learn about the building, including the stage area, the workshops and the rehearsal spaces.&lt;ref name=tours&gt;[http://www.teatro-real.com/es/el-teatro/visitas-guiadas/  Guided tours information on the company's website (in Spanish)] Retrieved 1 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Simon and the [[Spanish Harlem Orchestra]] performed ''The Capeman'' at the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]] with some of the original cast and other well-known artists. Simon also devoted a section of his two-night performances at the Beacon Theatre to ''The Capeman''. The NY Public Theater presented a concert production of the musical in the Summer of 2010 at Central Park's Delacorte Theater, directed by [[Diane Paulus]].

==Production==
Paul Simon began working on ''The Capeman'' in 1988. The early development was aided by Simon's friend Carlos Ortiz, who helped Simon locate and translate source material. Simon and Ortiz met with people who had known Agron in prison, and visited Esmeralda Agron in Puerto Rico. In the first minutes of their meeting, Agron described a dream of her son entering heaven, which would become the song "Esmeralda's Dream."&lt;ref name=dubner&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen J.|last=Dubner|title=The Pop Perfectionist on a Crowded Stage|url=http://www.stephenjdubner.com/journalism/110997.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times Magazine]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=November 9, 1997|accessdate=October 16, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514150353/http://www.stephenjdubner.com/journalism/110997.html|archive-date=2011-05-14|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ortiz also introduced Simon to several Latin musicians, and before long Simon had written "Born in Puerto Rico," one of the show's centerpiece songs.&lt;ref name=dubner/&gt;

Simon enlisted the help of [[Derek Walcott]], a Nobel Prize-winning author and poet from the West Indies. Their working relationship was awkward at first: Simon had become unused to this type of creative collaboration, and Walcott initially disliked the show's main character. Simon insisted that the music be written first, with the lyrics set to the songs.&lt;ref name=dubner/&gt; Eventually the two completed the play, with music composed by Simon and lyrics "about 50–50 Simon-Walcott."&lt;ref name=dubner/&gt;

Simon assembled a band and spent almost five years and $1 million recording the songs. This was an unorthodox approach to constructing a Broadway show. Typically a show's writer would deliver a script and score to a director, who would assemble and create the final production. Simon wanted to retain full artistic control over the show through its entire production.&lt;ref name=dubner/&gt; Simon soon encountered resistance for refusing to play by the usual rules of the Broadway industry.

Simon was often cited as being disdainful of Broadway,&lt;ref name="nytreview"/&gt; and said in interviews that he hoped to reinvigorate what he saw as a stale musical form.&lt;ref name="chill"/&gt; Broadway music, he said, had "ended up in a weird cul de sac – probably because it was never energized by rock and roll."&lt;ref name="facing"&gt;
{{cite news |first=J.D.|last=Considine|title=Facing the music |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1997-11-16/features/1997320197_1_agron-paul-simon-capeman/2 |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=Baltimore, Maryland|date= November 16, 1997|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The theatre producer [[Rocco Landesman]] later responded to Simon's statements: "The idea that you can at a strike rewrite an art form is a little presumptuous. I can't say the people in the theater community were rooting for Paul Simon after all the things he said about Broadway."&lt;ref name="chill"/&gt;

In 2011, Simon admitted that his inexperience had been a problem, saying
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's not that easy to write for the theater for the first time...You really need a guide. For people coming out of popular music, writing songs that further the plot is different from writing whatever is on your mind. It's a different discipline.&lt;ref name=spiderman/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Simon assembled a team of producers and financiers, including [[James L. Nederlander]] and [[Brad Grey]]. The team raised and contributed several million dollars, but none had experience producing a Broadway show.&lt;ref name=dubner/&gt;

Eventually, the production cost an estimated $11 million, at the time a very high budget for a Broadway show.&lt;ref name="nytreview"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben|last=Brantley|url=http://theater.nytimes.com/mem/theater/treview.html?_r=2&amp;res=9A01EFDF143AF933A05752C0A96E958260 |title=The Lure of Gang Violence To a Latin Beat |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=January 30, 1998 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the high budget was due to Simon's insistence that his musicians participate in all rehearsals with the actors, not a typical practice in Broadway productions.&lt;ref name=prog/&gt;

In another unorthodox move, Simon hired the director as the last member of the creative team. Simon first offered the job to [[Mark Morris (choreographer)|Mark Morris]], who agreed to be the show's choreographer instead. Simon hired set designer [[Bob Crowley]] (who would be nominated for Tony Award for his sets in ''The Capeman''), and cast [[Ruben Blades]] and [[Marc Anthony]] in the title roles. Only after these decisions did he hire [[Susana Tubert]] as the director.&lt;ref name=dubner/&gt;

During the last 18 months before its opening, three different directors worked on the musical: Tubert, [[Eric Simonson]], and Mark Morris, the choreographer, who was the final credited director.&lt;ref name="chill"/&gt; The show's eventual release date was delayed by last-minute editing and restructuring. Derek Walcott, the show's book writer, effectively walked out of the production after resisting rewrites.&lt;ref name="chill"/&gt; Blades, in particular, had very strong opinions about Walcott's book: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;I admire him deeply, he is a [[Nobel Prize|Nobel Laureate]], but there are cultural nuances that are lost in the translation that Walcott was simply unable to catch. I also had my struggles with Simon, telling him that a particular line or two would have never come out of a Latino's mouth if the play is to be believable.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

Significant work was done by director [[Jerry Zaks]], hired in an "unofficial capacity" to help Morris. Zaks said, "I've done about as much as I can with what's there."&lt;ref name="nytreview"/&gt;

The production gave preview performances in New York while the rewriting was taking place. This put the cast in the difficult position of performing the original version of the show each night, while in the afternoons they learned and rehearsed rewritten versions.&lt;ref name=spiderman&gt;{{cite news|first=Edna|last=Gundersen|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/entertainment/post/2011/04/paul-simon-feels-spider-man-producers-pain/|title=Paul Simon feels 'Spider-Man' producers' pain|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|publisher=[[Gannett Company]]|location=Mclean, Virginia|date=April 8, 2011|accessdate=April 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show opened at the [[Marquis Theatre]] on January 29, 1998, and suffered from very poor reviews from the mainstream press.&lt;ref name=crix/&gt; Within a week, the show's producers discussed their strategy for saving the production,&lt;ref name=crix/&gt; and vowed to keep the show open at least until the [[Tony Award]] nominations in May.&lt;ref name=muderous&gt;{{cite news |first=J.

The show closed after only 68 performances on March 28.&lt;ref name=close/&gt; After the show's closing was announced, Paul Simon issued a statement: "What I enjoyed the most, apart from the creative process, was the intensity with which the audience, in particular the Latino audience, responded to the play."&lt;ref name="close"&gt;{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Lyman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/06/movies/after-rocky-run-capeman-to-close.html?fta=y |title=After Rocky Run, 'Capeman' to Close |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=March 6, 1998 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Initial mainstream press reviews of ''The Capeman'' were overwhelmingly negative, though most had some praise for Simon's music.&lt;ref name="crix"&gt;{{cite news |first=Greg|last=Evans |title=Gang of crix knife 'Capeman' |url=http://stage.variety.com/article/VR1117467304.html?categoryid=15&amp;cs=1 |newspaper=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California| date=February 1, 1998 |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120722104052/http://stage.variety.com/article/VR1117467304.html?categoryid=15&amp;cs=1 |archivedate=July 22, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ben Brantley, reviewer for the ''[[New York Times]]'', wrote a very negative review, calling the show a "sad, benumbed spectacle" which was "unparalleled in its wholesale squandering of illustrious talents".&lt;ref name=nytreview/&gt; He praised Simon's ''[[Songs From The Capeman]]'' album, but said that the translation to stage was lacking: "Everything in the music melts together; practically nothing that's said, done and shown on the stage seems to connect with anything else."&lt;ref name=nytreview/&gt; Brantley admired Anthony and Blades' talents, but criticized the writing of their character, saying that Anthony "has been given no proper role to play".&lt;ref name=nytreview/&gt; He wrote that the historical footage of Agron stole the show, especially young Sal's media statements that his mother could watch him burn. "Nothing that Mr. Anthony or Mr. Blades does in ''The Capeman'' begins to approach the disturbing complexity of that image."&lt;ref name=nytreview/&gt;
However, ''The Capeman'' was included in the ''New York Times'' year-end Top Ten list for music in theater.

There was a minority that appreciated the play, but these were generally outside the mainstream. An article in ''[[The Progressive]]'' suggests cultural factors that led to the bad reviews, citing mainstream backlash against Simon's disparagement of the Broadway system, and discomfort with racial and ethnic themes in the Broadway core audience. The article points out that reviews were generally positive among two groups: out-of-town critics and non-white New York critics.&lt;ref name=prog&gt;{{cite news |first=Margaret|last=Spillane|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1295/is_n6_v62/ai_20645737/pg_3/?tag=content;col1|title=The Capeman |newspaper=[[The Progressive]] |publisher=Progressive Publishing|location=Madison, Wisconsin|date=June 1998|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recordings==
[[Image:Capeman cast album.jpg|thumb|"Cover" for digital release of ''The Capeman (Original Broadway Cast Recording)'']]
{{main|Songs from The Capeman}}
In 1997 (before the show's premiere), Simon released a studio album called ''Songs from The Capeman'', featuring 13 songs from the show performed by Simon with appearances from some of the original cast. Compared to Simon's other studio recordings, the album was not a success, peaking at position 42 of the Billboard 200 chart, the lowest of his career. Soon after, Puerto Rican singer [[Danny Rivera]] included a Spanish-language version of "Born in Puerto Rico" as part of his live recording, ''En Vivo desde [[Carnegie Hall]]''. In the recording, Rivera can be heard acknowledging Simon's presence in the audience, and thanking him for the song on behalf of all Puerto Ricans.

An original cast soundtrack recording was produced featuring 21 tracks, but its release was postponed after the show's failure. The record was eventually released in 2006 at the [[iTunes Store]] as ''The Capeman (Original Broadway Cast Recording)''. All vocals on this release were performed by the original cast, with an appearance by Paul Simon on "Trailways Bus."

==''The Capeman'' after Broadway==
''The Capeman'' was not performed in its original form after its 68-show original Broadway run. Shortly after the show's closure there were discussions of a ''Songs of The Capeman'' national concert tour, but these plans were abandoned.
&lt;ref name=chill&gt;{{cite news |first=Rick|last=Lyman|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/03/07/theater/after-capeman-a-chill-in-a-thriving-broadway-season.html?fta=y |title=After 'Capeman,' A Chill in a Thriving Broadway Season |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=March 7, 1998|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just days after the show's Broadway premier, ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' journalist Greg Evans suggested that the doomed show would work well as a concert of songs. He wrote,
"Years from now, when some savvy producer is scouting old theater material for a scaled-down concert staging, ''The Capeman'' should be first on his list."&lt;ref name=variety&gt;
{{cite magazine |first=Greg|last=Evans|url=http://www.allbusiness.com/crime-law-enforcement-corrections/criminal-offenses-crimes/9752452-1.html |title=The Capeman |magazine=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]]|location=Los Angeles, California|date=February 2, 1998 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Joseph Melillo, director of the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], produced a stage show called ''Songs from the Capeman'' using Paul Simon's ''Capeman'' music without the narrative dramatic elements of the show. Melillo said, "I wanted to help Paul, to get this demon out of him and onto the stage, where we could say, 'Look everyone, this is great music.'"&lt;ref name="stalks"&gt;
{{cite news |first=Larry|last=Rohter|title=Paul Simon’s 'Capeman' Stalks Another Chance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/08/12/theater/12capeman.html?_r=1 |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date=August 11, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Melillo's production featured the [[Spanish Harlem Orchestra]] led by [[Oscar Hernández (musician)|Oscar Hernández]], original music director for the Broadway ''Capeman''.&lt;ref name="revisited"&gt;{{cite news |first=Ben |last=Ratliff |url=http://theater.nytimes.com/2008/04/03/arts/music/03simo.html?fta=y |title='The Capeman' Revisited, Far From Broadway Lights|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|publisher=New York Times Company|location=New York City|date= April 3, 2008|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Simon appeared to sing "Trailways Bus," one of the songs from the show, and finished the evening with a performance of his 1980 Latin-themed single "[[Late in the Evening]]."&lt;ref name="revisited"/&gt;

[[Image:Capeman delacourte.JPG|thumb|Poster for the 2010 production of ''The Capeman'' in Central Park]]
In August 2010 a heavily revised production of ''The Capeman'' ran three shows at Central Park's [[Delacorte Theater]], directed by [[Diane Paulus]]. The production featured [[Obie Bermúdez]] as The Umbrella Man&lt;ref name=hearing&gt;{{cite news| first=Ed|last=Morales| title='The Capeman' gets a new hearing | url=http://www.nydailynews.com/latino/2010/08/04/2010-08-04_untitled__capeman0.html| newspaper=[[New York Daily News]]|publisher=[[Tronc]]|location=New York City|date=August 4, 2010|accessdate=August 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a musical number by [[Danny Rivera]]. This version was substantially stripped down, with a running time of only about 90 minutes (compared to the original production's three hours). The new version increased the focus on Agron's mother,&lt;ref name=stalks/&gt; dropped some characters and subplots,&lt;ref name=diva&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last=Gans|title=DIVA TALK: Catching Up With Capeman Star Luba Mason|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/141991-DIVA-TALK-Catching-Up-With-Capeman-Star-Luba-Mason| newspaper=[[Playbill]]| location=New York City|date=August 13, 2010| accessdate=August 17, 2010| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100816055830/http://www.playbill.com/news/article/141991-DIVA-TALK-Catching-Up-With-Capeman-Star-Luba-Mason| archivedate=August 16, 2010| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; used more choreography, and had no sets.

[[Image:The Devils Charter.gif|thumb|right|200px|[[Title page]] of ''The Devil's Charter''.]]
'''''The Devil's Charter''''' is an early [[English literature#Jacobean literature|Jacobean]] era stage play, a [[tragedy]] written by [[Barnabe Barnes]]. The play recounts the story of [[Pope Alexander VI]].

==Date, performance, publication==
''The Devil's Charter'' dates from [[1607 in literature|1607]]; it was acted by the [[King's Men (playing company)|King's Men]] at Court before King [[James I of England|James I]] on [[Candlemas]] (2 February) of that year. The play was entered into the [[Stationers' Register]] on 16 October 1607, and published before the end of the year, in a [[book size|quarto]] printed by [[George Eld]] for the bookseller John Wright. Barnes dedicated the play to Sir William Pope and to [[William Herbert, 3rd Earl of Pembroke]]. The 1607 quarto is the sole edition of the play prior to the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edmund Kerchever Chambers|E. K. Chambers]], ''The Elizabethan Stage,'' 4 Volumes, Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1923; Vol. 3, pp. 214&amp;ndash;15.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Plot synopsis ==
The play opens with a dumbshow prologue that shows Roderigo making a deal with the devil to become Pope Alexander VI. Lodowick convinces Charles of France to go to war against Italy on religious grounds. Two gentlemen lambast the pope’s corruption. Gismond and Barbarossa intercept some slander against the pope and Gismond and are upset, promising to find and punish the writer. The Pope soliloquizes about how he made this deal with the devil for the betterment of his sons, Candy and Caesar. He divides Italy and the surrounding territories between them and gives them each a swath to rule. Caesar and the Pope pontificate about ruling well and fighting wars in the name of religion. Candy leaves to go deal with the ambassador come to make a marriage with the Lady Saunce. Lucretia prepares to murder her husband Gismond for keeping her shut away. They trade barbs about jealousy and virtue. She ties him up, makes him sign a statement that he slandered her, her father the pope, her brothers Caesar and Candy, and also Sforza, and then stabs him a BUNCH. She then stages it to look like he killed himself out of regret over locking her up and retires to bed. A servant and Barbarossa discover the body and she feigns shock and grief. She makes a scene and threatens to kill herself as well. The Chorus tells us that King Charles is marching on Italy with about 20000 troops.

Alexander, Caesar, and Candy prepare for battle against King Charles. Alexander and Charles parley and can’t come to an agreement—Charles wants to conquer Rome, and Alexander won’t yield the Castell Angelo. Charles’s companions call Alexander the antichrist and call on Charles to remove him from the throne. Charles and Alexander reach an accord. The Chorus tells us that after this, Charles dies, territory changes hands a couple times, and the rest of the play really only concerns the Pope and Caesar.

The Pope sends a messenger with a ruby to Astor bidding him to come visit. Astor is the Pope’s captive for sexual reasons. Astor is insulted by this request. The Pope comes out of a casement to beg/woo Astor to come to him. Astor resists and resists and then excuses himself for mass. The Pope tells his servant to make sure Astor visits after mass because he cannot breathe without him. Caesar hires Frescobaldi, a ruffian, to do some nefarious work. Frescobaldi recites his qualifications, his mettle in battle, etc. Candy suspects that his sister Lucretia murdered her husband Gismond and calls her in for questioning. Frescobaldi sets up his post to do his dirty work. Baglioni stumbles across him and the two become friends. Frescobaldi dismisses Baglioni and gets back to work. Caesar and Frescobaldi trip and stab Candy. Frescobaldi hauls Candy’s body up to toss it over the bridge, and Caesar pushes Frescobaldi after. Caesar crows about how no one will suspect his crimes since he’s a cardinal. He plots to frame Sforza for the murder and to kill his sister Lucretia next. 

The Pope conjures devils to find out who murdered Candy and Gismond, and is horrified when he finds out Caesar and Lucretia are responsible. He vows that they (and Astor) must die. The Pope accuses Caesar of murdering Candy, and Caesar accuses the Pope of incest, murder, sodomy, lust, etc. They both agree to conceal the other’s sins in order to keep the status quo. Lucretia puts on poisoned makeup and dies. Caesar lays siege to Countess Katharine of Furli, Sforza’s daughter. She refuses to yield and he reveals that he has kidnapped her two sons. She still refuses to yield even to save their lives and Caesar orders their execution. They fight in battle and Katharine is captured. Caesar reveals that her sons are alive and her fortune is intact, and orders the three of them sent to Rome. Barbarossa is instructed to govern Furli without restriction and give the people their liberty. The Pope arranges for Astor and his brother Philippo to be drugged to sleep, then places an asp on both their chests and they die. Other lords suspect foul play.

Caesar discharges his army with good pay and then hires Baglioni to kill Rozzi, an apothecary. Bernardo arrives to collect some powders and poisons from Rozzi. Rozzi sets down his bottles to read a letter. Baglioni drinks from the bottles while he waits to shoot Rozzi. The bottle are poisoned. Bernardo leaves with the potions. Baglioni shoots Rozzi. The Pope and Caesar discuss their plans to poison Cardinal Caraffa at a banquet that night. The Devil arrives at the banquet and plays switcheroo with the poisoned bottles. The Pope and Caesar poison themselves. Caesar stabs Bernardo for the mix up. The Cardinals depart to save themselves. The devils Belchar, Astaroth, and Varca plan to hurry the Pope to hell. The Pope tries to repent and has difficulty accessing his conscience. He retires to his study and finds the Devil there waiting for him. The Pope tries to exorcise the Devil and cannot. They look over the contract he made in exchange for becoming Pope, and because of some tricky math, it is for eleven years and seven days, though the Pope thought it was for eighteen years and eight days. They argue over the terms and the Devil tells the Pope to prepare for eternal torment. The Devil shows the Pope the ghosts of stabbed Candy and poisoned Lucretia—the Pope is poisoned in retribution for poisoning Lucretia, while Caesar will be stabbed in retribution for stabbing Candy. A bunch of devils arrive to take the Pope down to hell. Two Cardinals find his corpse and order Rome’s bells to be run in Thanksgiving for being delivered from this wicked pope.

==Special features==
The play is notable among scholars of [[English Renaissance theatre]] for its unusually full stage directions, which reveal much about the dramatic style of the leading company of the age &amp;mdash; and for the fact that those stage directions specify the play's characters carrying their props onto the stage with them. Since the characters are historical personages ([[Charles VIII of France]], [[Lodovico Sforza]], [[Cesare Borgia]], and [[Francesco Guicciardini]] among others), the effect can be odd and striking; at the start of Act I, scene v, [[Lucrezia Borgia]] enters carrying a chair, "which she planteth upon the stage."&lt;ref&gt;[[F. E. Halliday]],  ''A Shakespeare Companion 1564&amp;ndash;1964,'' Baltimore, Penguin, 1964; p. 135.&lt;/ref&gt; Characters murder other characters, then drag the bodies offstage.

The text of ''The Devil's Charter'' is rich with intellectual, historical, and contemporary Jacobean references.&lt;ref&gt;Tanya Pollard, ''Drugs and Theater in Early Modern England,'' Oxford, Oxford University Press, 2005; pp. 81-100 and ff.&lt;/ref&gt; It is not accidental that this anti-Catholic play was written and produced in the aftermath of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605; Protestant propagandists found the story of the Borgia family a useful resource. The story was dramatized again by [[Nathaniel Lee]] in his ''Caesar Borgia'' ([[1679 in literature|1679]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pauline Kews, "Otway, Lee, and the Restoration History Play," in: ''A Companion to Restoration Drama.'' Susan J. Owen, ed. London, Blackwell, 2001; pp. 370-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The devil==
The Devil in the play's title is literal rather than metaphorical; Alexander conjures up [[Astaroth]] to aid him in his climb to power. (Barnes's play reflects the influences of earlier devil plays, notably [[Christopher Marlowe|Marlowe]]'s ''[[The Tragical History of Doctor Faustus|Doctor Faustus]]''.) The diabolism of the plot provides opportunities for sensationalism, with multiple ghosts, and stage spectacle, as in the conjuring scene IV,i. (The stage directions there give the King's Men some latitude in special effects: Alexander conjures up an infernal king with a red face, who is "riding upon a lion, or dragon.") At the start of V,v, Astaroth calls up two fellow devils, Belchar and Varca; they converse and dance. In the next and concluding scene, Astaroth, wearing the papal robes, surprises Alexander; the pope learns that the devil has planted tricky arithmetic in their written contract, and that his reign is over years sooner than he expected. Amid thunder and lightning, a horde of devils drag Alexander to Hell.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="233166">This article is a chronological listing of allegations of meetings between members of [[al-Qaeda]] and members of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s government, as well as other information relevant to [[conspiracy theories]] involving [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda]].

In 2003, American terrorism analyst [[Evan Kohlmann|Evan Kohlman]] said in an interview:

&lt;blockquote&gt;While there have been a number of promising intelligence leads hinting at possible meetings between al-Qaeda members and elements of the former Baghdad regime, nothing has been yet shown demonstrating that these potential contacts were historically any more significant than the same level of communication maintained between Osama bin Laden and ruling elements in a number of Iraq's Persian Gulf neighbors, including Saudi Arabia, Iran, Yemen, Qatar, and Kuwait.&lt;ref name="commondreams20030803"&gt;{{cite web| last = Canellos| first = Peter S.| author2 = Bryan Bender| title = Questions Grow Over Iraq Links to Qaeda| publisher = CommonDreams.org| date = 3 August 2003| url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0803-04.htm| accessdate = 6 December 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061122072436/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0803-04.htm| archivedate = 22 November 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 2006, a report of postwar findings by the [[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] concluded that:

{{quote|Postwar findings have identified only one meeting between representatives of al-Qa'ida and Saddam Hussein's regime reported in prewar intelligence assessments. Postwar findings have identified two occasions, not reported prior to the war, in which Saddam Hussein rebuffed meeting requests from an al-Qa'ida operative. The Intelligence Community has not found any other evidence of meetings between al'Qa'ida and Iraq.&lt;ref name="senate_report_2006_p105"&gt;{{Cite web|title=Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on Postwar Findings About Iraq's WMD Programs and Links to Terrorism and How They Compare With Prewar Assessments |publisher=[[United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence]] |pages=105 |date=8 September 2006 |url=http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=6 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060921074629/http://intelligence.senate.gov/phaseiiaccuracy.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The same report also concluded that:

{{quote|Saddam Hussein was distrustful of al-Qaeda and viewed Islamic extremists as a threat to his regime, refusing all requests from al-Qaeda to provide material or operational support.&lt;ref name="senate_report_2006_p105" /&gt;}}

The result of the publication of the Senate report was the belief that the entire connection between Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda was an official deception based on [[Cherry picking (fallacy)|cherry picking]] specific intelligence data that bolstered the case for war with Iraq regardless of its reliability. One instance of this reaction was reported in a [[BBC]] news article, which stated:

{{quote|Opposition Democrats are accusing the White House of deliberate deception. They say the revelation undermines the basis on which the US went to war in Iraq.&lt;ref name="bbc20060909"&gt;{{cite news| title = Saddam 'had no link to al-Qaeda'|publisher=BBC News | date = 9 September 2006| url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/5328592.stm| accessdate =6 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== 1988 ===
* According to the sworn testimony of [[al-Qaeda]] member Mohamed Rashed Daoud Al-'Owhali in 2001, [[Osama bin Laden]] delivered a lecture in Pakistan in 1988. During this lecture he spoke against [[Saddam Hussein]] and the [[Ba'ath party]] by warning his listeners about Saddam's expansionist ambitions in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="al_owhali_testimony"&gt;{{cite web | title = USA v.

=== 1990 ===

==== March ====
*During an interview with [[Peter Bergen]], Khaled Batarfi, an old friend of [[Osama bin Laden]], said that bin Laden had already predicted Saddam's invasion of Kuwait and had begun preparations for war against Saddam. According to Batarfi, Bin Laden had said, "We should train our people, our young and increase our army and prepare for the day when eventually we are attacked. This guy [Saddam] can never be trusted."  Batarfi himself went on to say about bin Laden: "He doesn't believe [Saddam] is a Muslim. So he never liked him nor trusted him."&lt;ref name="peter_bergen_111_112"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bergen | first = Peter | title = The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader | publisher=Free Press | date = 8 August 2006 | location = New York City | pages = 111–112 | isbn = 0-7432-7892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== 2 August ====
*Saddam Hussein's army invades Kuwait. In response to the perceived threat to Saudi Arabia, Osama bin Laden offers to bring an army of [[jihadist]] fighters to protect the kingdom against Saddam. The [[House of Saud|Saudi royal family]]'s decision to seek help from American troops rather than from bin Laden's jihadists is considered a turning point in bin Laden's life. The presence of American troops in the Arabian peninsula after the end of the [[Gulf War]] became, for bin Laden, a key piece of evidence that the U.S. was at war with [[Islam]]. Prince [[Turki bin Faisal Al Saud]], the former head of the Saudi intelligence agency [[Al Mukhabarat Al A'amah]], noted of bin Laden: "I saw radical changes in his personality as he changed from a calm, peaceful and gentle man interested in helping Muslims into a person who believed that he would be able to amass and command an army to liberate Kuwait. It revealed his arrogance."&lt;ref name="peter_bergen_112"&gt;{{cite book | last = Bergen | first = Peter | title = The Osama bin Laden I Know: An Oral History of al Qaeda's Leader | publisher=Free Press | date = 8 August 2006 | location = New York City | pages = 112 | isbn = 0-7432-7892-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*While bin Laden continued to oppose Saddam's Baathist government, he was also vocal in criticizing the [[Iraq sanctions|U.N. sanctions against Iraq]].&lt;ref name="rohan_gunaratna_book"&gt;{{cite book | last = Gunaratna | first = Rohan | title = Inside Al Qaeda: Global Network of Terror | publisher=Berkley Trade | date = 3 June 2003 | location = New York, NY | pages = 37 | isbn = 978-0-425-19114-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Bin Laden's bodyguard recalls that his intentions included not only the liberation of Kuwait but also "rescuing the Iraqi people from the domination of the Ba'th Party&amp;nbsp;... Sheikh Osama bin Laden was dreaming of this."&lt;ref name="peter_bergen_112" /&gt;

== Inter-war period ==

=== 1992 ===
* According to information that was first made public in the [[Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda link allegations#2003 Feith memo|Feith memo]], a meeting was arranged by [[Hassan al-Turabi]] between members of the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]] and members of al-Qaeda, allegedly with the goal of creating a common strategy for deposing pro-Western Arab governments. The American author [[Lawrence Wright]] comments in his [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning book ''[[The Looming Tower]]'' that:

{{quote|The Iraqi delegation met with Bin Laden, even flattered him, claiming that he was the prophesied [[Mahdi]] the savior of Islam. They wanted him to stop backing anti-Saddam insurgents, Bin Laden agreed. But in return he asked for weapons and training camps inside Iraq. That same year, [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]] traveled to Bagdad where he met Saddam Hussein in person. But there is no evidence that Iraq ever supplied al-Qaeda with weapons or camps, and soon bin Laden resumed his support of Iraqi dissidents."&lt;ref name="wright_tower_295_296"&gt;{{cite book | last = Wright | first = Lawrence | title = The Looming Tower | publisher=Knopf | year = 2006 | pages = 295–296 | isbn = 978-0-375-41486-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== 1993 ===
*The [[1993 World Trade Center bombing]] occurred on 26 February. One of the conspirators was [[Abdul Rahman Yasin]], an American of Iraqi descent born in [[Bloomington, Indiana]]. After the attack he fled to Iraq where he allegedly moved in with a relative and received support from the Iraqi government.&lt;ref name="usatoday20030927"&gt;{{cite news| last = Diamond| first = John| title = U.S.: Iraq sheltered suspect in '93 WTC attack|work=USA Today | date = 27 September 2003| url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/world/iraq/2003-09-17-iraq-wtc_x.htm| accessdate =6 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Web Editor | title =   Abdul Rahman Yasin  | publisher=National Counterterrorism Center (NCTC) | url =  http://www.nctc.gov/site/profiles/yasin.htm |  accessdate  =22 November 2007 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071109063701/http://www.nctc.gov/site/profiles/yasin.htm| archivedate = 9 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Iraqi government claimed they imprisoned Yasin in 1994, where he remained until at least 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/05/31/60minutes/main510795.shtml 60 Minutes: The Man Who Got Away, Says '93 WTC Bombers Originally Targeted Jewish Neighborhoods – CBS News] at www.cbsnews.com&lt;/ref&gt; Iraq made an offer to the Clinton Administration to trade Yasin in 1998, but the Clinton administration rejected the offer.&lt;ref name="commondreams20040303"&gt;{{cite web| last = Strobel| first = Warren P.| author2 = Jonathan S.

Bush|Bush Administration]] in 2003 but this offer was also spurned.&lt;ref name="commondreams20031106"&gt;{{cite web| last = Risen| first = James| title = Iraq Said to Have Tried to Reach Last-Minute Deal to Avert War| publisher = CommonDreams.org| date = 6 November 2003| url = http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1106-02.htm| accessdate = 7 December 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061122062511/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/1106-02.htm| archivedate = 22 November 2006| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous intelligence official claimed that Iraq required the U.S. to sign a statement discussing Yasin's whereabouts that was at odds with the U.S. "version of the facts."  Former Iraqi foreign minister [[Tariq Aziz]], however, claimed that the offers were made without conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = | title = US 'refused Iraq's terror suspect offer|publisher=BBC | date = 20 June 2002| url =  http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2022991.stm | accessdate =22 November 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The same Intelligence official stated that the Iraqi's wanted the US to "sign a lengthy document that included information about Yasin's whereabouts since 1993, and how they had tried to turn him over.  "We refused to sign," said the official, "Because we believe their version was inaccurate."  The US, he said, offered to sign a simple receipt acknowledging that the Iraqis had turned Yasin over to us. But they did not respond."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=CBS|title=Transcript: The Yasin Interview|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-18560_162-510847.html|accessdate =24 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Neil Herman, who headed the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) investigation into the 1993 World Trade Center attack, noted that despite Yasin's presence in Baghdad, there was no evidence of Iraqi support for the attack. "We looked at that rather extensively," he told CNN terrorism analyst [[Peter Bergen]]. "There were no ties to the Iraqi government." Bergen writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In sum, by the mid-'90s, the [[Joint Terrorism Task Force]] in New York, the F.B.I., the [[United States Attorney|U.S. Attorney]]'s office in the [[United States District Court for the Southern District of New York|Southern District of New York]], the [[Central Intelligence Agency|C.I.A.]], the [[United States National Security Council|N.S.C.]], and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] had all found no evidence implicating the Iraqi government in the first Trade Center attack.&lt;ref name="washmonthly200312"&gt;{{cite web| last = Bergen| first = Peter| title = Armchair Provocateur – Laurie Mylroie: The Neocons' favorite conspiracy theorist.| publisher = Washington Monthly| date = December 2003| url = http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0312.bergen.html| accessdate = 7 December 2006| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20081101154056/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0312.bergen.html| archivedate = 1 November 2008| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*During the [[9/11 Commission]] Hearings, former U.S. [[counter-terrorism]] chief [[Richard A. Clarke]] was asked about whether Yasin going to Iraq established a connection between Saddam Hussein and the 1993 World Trade Center attack. His response was unequivocating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;But the investigation, both the CIA investigation and the FBI investigation, made it very clear in '95 and '96 as they got more information, that the Iraqi government was in no way involved in the attack. And the fact that one of the 12 people involved in the attack was Iraqi hardly seems to me as evidence that the Iraqi government was involved in the attack. The attack was al-Qaida; not Iraq. The Iraqi government because, obviously, of the hostility between us and them, didn't cooperate in turning him over and gave him sanctuary, as it did give sanctuary to other terrorists. But the allegation that has been made that the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center was done by the Iraqi government I think is absolutely without foundation.&lt;ref name="wapo20040324"&gt;{{cite news| title = Wednesday's 9/11 Commission Hearings| format=transcript|work=Washington Post | date =24 March 2004| url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A20349-2004Mar24.html| accessdate =7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1994 ===
*[[Farouk Hijazi]], former head of the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]], allegedly meets with [[Osama bin Laden]] in Sudan. Former [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) counter-terrorism official [[Vincent Cannistraro]] claimed that bin Laden rejected Hijazi's overtures, and concluded that bin Laden did not want to be "exploited" by Iraq's [[Secularity|secular]] administration.&lt;ref name="newsweek20031119"&gt;{{cite web|last=Isikoff |first=Michael |author2=Mark Hosenball |title=Case Decidedly Not Closed |work=Newsweek |date=19 November 2003 |url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586/ |accessdate=6 December 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061109194327/http://msnbc.msn.com/id/3540586/ |archivedate=9 November 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''[[The Guardian]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;Most analysts believe, however, that the ideological differences between the Iraqis and the terrorists were insurmountable. It is thought that bin Laden rejected any kind of alliance, preferring to pursue his own policy of global [[jihad]], or holy war.&lt;ref name="guardian20030427"&gt;{{cite news| last = Bright| first = Martin|author2=Jason Burke | title = Saddam 'held talks on alliance with al-Qaeda'|work=The Guardian |location=UK | date = 27 April 2003| url = https://www.theguardian.com/alqaida/story/0,12469,944589,00.html| accessdate =6 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1995 ===

==== 19 February, Sudan ====
*A handwritten note that is a part of the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom documents]] collection (released by the U.S. government in 2006) suggests that a representative of Saddam's government met with bin Laden in Sudan on 19 February 1995. According to the note, bin laden suggested "carrying out joint operations against foreign forces" in Saudi Arabia.
*An [[ABC News]] article, which reported on the document, notes that eight months after the date of this document, al Qaeda staged an attack in [[Riyadh]]. Neither ABC nor any other source has offered information suggesting that Iraq participated in planning these attacks, and the Iraqi government has never been accused of such participation{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}, and ABC notes that the militants who attacked the facility "later confessed on Saudi TV to having been trained by Osama bin Laden."  The ABC article further notes that "the document does not establish that the two parties did in fact enter into an operational relationship," and also that the contacts may have "been approved personally by Saddam Hussein."  The ABC article also cautions that "this document is handwritten and has no official seal."&lt;ref name="abc20060323"&gt;{{cite web| title = Did Russian Ambassador Give Saddam the U.S. War Plan?| publisher=ABC News| date = 23 March 2006| url = http://abcnews.go.com/International/IraqCoverage/story?id=1734490&amp;page=1| accessdate =7 December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*CNN terrorism expert Peter Bergen commented, "The results of this meeting were&amp;nbsp;... nothing. Two subsequent attacks against American forces in Saudi Arabia – a car bombing that year and the [[Khobar Towers]] attack in 1996 – were carried out, respectively, by locals who said they were influenced by Mr. bin Laden and by the Saudi branch of [[Hezbollah]], a [[Shia Islam|Shiite]] group aided by [[Iran]]ian government officials."&lt;ref name="nytimes20060328"&gt;{{cite news| last = Bergen| first = Peter| title = Enemy of Our Enemy| work=op-ed| publisher=NY Times| date = 28 March 2006| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/28/opinion/28bergen.html?ex=1165640400&amp;en=fdde05968a5e2c68&amp;ei=5070| accessdate =7 December 2006 }} Registration required.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that a "joint intelligence task force" concluded that the document "appeared authentic". The document, which asserts that bin Laden "was approached by our side," states that bin Laden previously "had some reservations about being labeled an Iraqi operative," but was willing to meet in Sudan. At the meeting, bin Laden requested that sermons of an anti-Saudi cleric be rebroadcast in Iraq. That request, the document states, was approved by Baghdad. The document also states that Iraqi intelligence officers began "seeking other channels through which to handle the relationship, in light of [bin Laden's departure from Sudan]". The Iraqi document states that "cooperation between the two organizations should be allowed to develop freely through discussion and agreement."&lt;ref name="nytimes20040625"&gt;{{cite news|last=Shanker  |first=Thom |title=The Reach of War: The Intelligence; Iraqis, Seeking Foes of Saudis, Contacted bin Laden, File Says |newspaper=New York Times |date=25 June 2004 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/06/25/world/reach-war-intelligence-iraqis-seeking-foes-saudis-contacted-bin-laden-file-says.html |accessdate =8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== September, Sudan ====
*[[Brigadier]] Salim al-Ahmed, a top explosives expert of the Iraqi Intelligence Service (IIS), allegedly met with bin Laden in [[Khartoum]], Sudan, in September–October 1995.&lt;ref name="telegraph_phillips_20062004"&gt;{{cite news | last = Phillips | first = Melanie | title = There was a link between Saddam and al-Qa'eda | work=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] | date = 20 June 2004 | url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/comment/personal-view/3607455/There-was-a-link-between-Saddam-and-al-Qaeda.html | accessdate =18 November 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the 9/11 Commission Report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;At least one of these reports dates the meeting to 1994, but other evidence indicates the meeting may have occurred in February 1995.&lt;ref name="911_report_p468"&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 468 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* A second meeting between the IIS and bin Laden is alleged to have taken place in Sudan, in July 1996. At this meeting, Mani' Abd Rashid al-Tikriti, a director of the IIS, was allegedly present.&lt;ref name="telegraph_phillips_20062004" /&gt; According to the 9/11 Commission report, however, the veracity of the second meeting is in doubt due to the [[anachronism]] of events:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The information is puzzling, since bin Ladin left Sudan for Afghanistan in May 1996, and there is no evidence he ventured back there (or anywhere else) for a visit. In examining the source material, the reports note that the information was received 'third hand,' passed from the foreign government service that 'does not meet directly with the ultimate source of the information, but obtains the information from him through two unidentified intermediaries, one of whom merely delivers the information to the Service.'" The same source also claims al-Ahmed was seen near bin Laden's farm in December 1995.&lt;ref name="911_report_p468" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Starting in 1995, Salman Pak, Iraq ====
* Several Iraqi defectors report that hundreds of foreign terrorists were being trained in [[Aircraft hijacking|airplane hijacking]] techniques "without weapons" using a real airplane (variously reported as a [[Boeing 707]] and a [[Tupolev Tu-154]]) as a [[Theatrical property|prop]] at [[Salman Pak facility|Salman Pak]], an Iraqi military facility just south of Baghdad, between 1995 and 2000. The training program was allegedly run by the [[Iraqi Intelligence Service]], i.e., the Mukhabarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/interviews/khodada.html |title=Frontline: Gunning for Saddam: Interviews: Sabah Khodada |publisher=PBS |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allegation has also been reported by the following defectors:
** Sabah Khalifa Khodada Alami (former Iraqi army captain), who provided details of the layout of the camp as early as 1998
** "Abu Zeinab" al-Ghurairy (former Iraqi sergeant who claimed to be a general), who corroborated Khodada's details in 2000
** [[Khidir Hamza]], a scientist who worked on Iraq's nuclear program&lt;ref name="pbs_hamza"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/gunning/interviews/hamza.html |title=Frontline: Gunning for Saddam: Interviews: Khidir Hamza |publisher=PBS |date=8 November 2001 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Abdul Rahman al-Shamari, a Mukhabarat agent in U.S. custody
** "Abu Mohammed", a former colonel in [[Fedayeen Saddam]]&lt;ref name="dailytimes_abumohammed"&gt;{{cite web | last = Roberts | first = Gwynne | title = Baghdad Trained Al Qaeda Fighters in Chemical Warfare | work=Daily Times | date = 15 July 2002 | url = http://www.dailytimes.com.pk/default.asp?page=story_15-7-2002_pg4_ | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The credibility of Khodada and Abu Zeinab is often questioned, however, due to their association with the [[Iraqi National Congress]], an organization that has been accused of deliberately supplying false information to the U.S. government in order to build support for administration change.&lt;ref name="landay_wells"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Landay |first1=Jonathan S. |last2=Wells |first2=Tish |title=Global Misinformation Campaign was Used to Build Case for War |work=CommonDreams.org |date=16 March 2004 |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-02.htm |accessdate=2 December 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131117010917/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines04/0316-02.htm |archivedate=17 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to Helen Kennedy of the ''[[New York Daily News]]''

&lt;blockquote&gt;The INC's agenda was to get us into a war. The really damaging stories all came from those guys, not the CIA. They did a really sophisticated job of getting it out there.&lt;ref name=helen_kennedy&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/4/mccollam-list.asp |publisher=Columbia Journalism Review |date=July–August 2004 |title=The List |first=Douglas |last=McCollam |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040703025203/http://www.cjr.org/issues/2004/4/mccollam-list.asp |archivedate=2004-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One of the defectors, al-Ghurairy, has been described as "a complete fake – a low-ranking former soldier whom [[Ahmed Chalabi]]'s aides had coached to deceive the media."&lt;ref name="motherjones_fairweather"&gt;{{cite web | last = Fairweather | first = Jack | title = Heroes in Error | work=[[Mother Jones (magazine)|Mother Jones]] | date = March–April 2006 | url = http://motherjones.com/politics/2006/03/heroes-error | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another defector who interviewed al-Ghurairy noted, "He is an opportunist, cheap and manipulative. He has poetic interests and has a vivid imagination in making up stories."&lt;ref name="informationclearinghouse_dwyer"&gt;{{cite web | last = Dwyer | first = Jim | title = Defectors' Reports on Iraq Arms Were Embellished, Exile Asserts | work=Information Clearing House | date = 9 July 2004 | url = http://www.informationclearinghouse.info/article6455.htm | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inconsistencies in the stories of the defectors led U.S. officials, journalists, and investigators to conclude that the Salman Pak story was inaccurate. One senior U.S. official said that they had found "nothing to substantiate" the claim that al-Qaeda trained at Salman Pak other than the testimony of several INC defectors.&lt;ref name="landay_wells" /&gt;
* Saddam's government had even denied that an airplane existed 25 kilometers southeast of Baghdad. The Iraqi ambassador to the U.N., Mohammed Aldouri, told ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' in the fall of 2001,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I am lucky that I know the area, this Salman Pak. This is a very beautiful area with gardens, with trees. It is not possible to do such a program there, because there's no place for planes.&lt;ref name="nationalreview_carson"&gt;{{cite web | last = Carson | first = Christopher S. | title = An Unapologetic Apology | work=National Review | date = 2 June 2004 | url = http://old.nationalreview.com/comment/carson200406020845.asp | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* The chief of the [[Iraq Survey Group]], [[Charles Duelfer]], however, expressed a different opinion about Salman Pak in 2001: "We always just called them the terrorist camps. We reported them at the time, but they've obviously taken on new significance.".&lt;ref name="usatoday_eisler"&gt;{{cite news | last = Eisler | first = Peter | title = U.S. Officials Question Link Between 9/11 and Iraq |work=USA Today | date = 2 December 2001 | url = https://www.usatoday.com/news/sept11/2001/12/03/1acover.htm | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the Iraqis told the [[United Nations Special Commission]] (UNSCOM) that the Salman Pak facility was used by police for counter-terrorist training.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}} "Of course we automatically took out the word 'counter'," Duelfer explained.{{Citation needed|date=December 2010}}  Furthermore, after the [[Iraq War|invasion of Iraq]], the camp was captured by [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marines]] "after it was discussed by Egyptian and Sudanese fighters caught elsewhere in Iraq."&lt;ref name="sptimes"&gt;{{cite news | title = Jet Shell Reinforces Suspicions About Terrorist Training |agency=Associated Press   | date = 7 April 2003 | url = http://www.sptimes.com/2003/04/07/Worldandnation/Jet_shell_reinforces_.shtml | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalreview_murdock"&gt;{{cite web | last = Murdock | first = Deroy | title = At Salman Pak | work=National Review | date = 7 April 2003 | url = http://www.nationalreview.com/articles/206485/salman-pak/deroy-murdock | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brigadier General Vincent Brooks described the capture, saying,

&lt;blockquote&gt;The nature of the work being done by some of those people that we captured, their inferences to the type of training that they received, all of these things give us the impression that there was terrorist training that was conducted at Salman Pak.&lt;ref name="sptimes" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The independent Iraqi weekly ''Al-Yawm Al-Aakher'' interviewed a former Iraqi officer who also claimed that Salman Pak was being used to train foreign terrorists.&lt;ref name="memri"&gt;{{cite web | title = Iraqi Daily: Saddam Ordered Training of Al-Qa'ida Members | work=The Middle East Media Research Institute (MEMRI) | date = 17 October 2003 | url = http://www.memri.org/report/en/0/0/0/0/0/0/974.htm | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The investigative journalist Seymour Hersh, however, expresses an opposite stance in noting that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Salman Pak was overrun by American troops on 6 April [2003]. Apparently, neither the camp nor the former biological facility has yielded evidence to substantiate the claims made before the war [that the camp was used for terrorist training].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hersh |first=Seymour M. |url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030512fa_fact |title=Selective Intelligence |publisher=The New Yorker |work=The New Yorker |date=7 January 2009 |accessdate=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030508020931/http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/?030512fa_fact |archivedate=2003-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A similar view is also held by Douglas MacCollam, a journalist for the ''[[Columbia Journalism Review]]'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;There still remain claims and counterclaims about what was going on at Salman Pak. But the consensus view now is that the camp was what Iraq told UN weapons inspectors it was – a counterterrorism training camp for army commandos.&lt;ref name=helen_kennedy /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* In the Senate Intelligence Committee's 2006 report, the DIA stated that it found "no credible reports that non-Iraqis were trained to conduct or support transnational terrorist operations at Salman Pak after 1991." Explaining the origins for the false allegations, the DIA concluded that [[Operation Desert Storm]] had brought attention to the training base at Salman Pak, so

&lt;blockquote&gt;Fabricators and unestablished sources who reported hearsay or third-hand information created a large volume of human intelligence reporting. This type of reporting surged after September 2001.&lt;ref name="baltimorechronicle_parry"&gt;{{cite web | last = Parry | first = Robert | title = How Neocon Favorites Duped U.S. | work=The Baltimore Chronicle &amp; Sentinel | date = 1 November 2006 | url = http://baltimorechronicle.com/2006/110106Parry.shtml | accessdate =2 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Circa 1995, Iraq ====
* An al-Qaeda operative using the alias Abu Abdullah al-Iraqi allegedly requests help in chemical weapons training from Saddam. The request was supposedly approved and trainers from Unit 999, an Iraqi secret-police organization organized by [[Uday Hussein]], were dispatched to camps in Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="newyorker_goldberg_10022003"&gt;{{cite web | last = Goldberg | first = Jeffery | title = The Unknown: The C.I.A. and the Pentagon take another look at Al Qaeda and Iraq |work=The New Yorker | date = 10 February 2003 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/02/10/030210fa_fact | accessdate =18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two U.S. counter-terrorism officials told ''[[Newsweek]]'' that they believe the information about al-Iraqi came exclusively from the captured al-Qaeda operative [[Ibn al-Shaykh al-Libi]], who has since recanted, and whose credibility was impugned by both the CIA and the [[Defense Intelligence Agency]] (DIA).&lt;ref name="newsweek_deadlink"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/9991919/site/newsweek/ |title=Al-Libi's Tall Tales |work=Newsweek National News |publisher=MSNBC |accessdate=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051126201544/http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/9991919/site/newsweek/ |archivedate=2005-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A DIA report in February 2002 concluded:

&lt;blockquote&gt;This is the first report from Ibn al-Shaykh in which he claims Iraq assisted al-Qaida's CBRN [Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear] efforts. However, he lacks specific details on the Iraqis involved, the CBRN materials associated with the assistance, and the location where training occurred. It is possible he does not know any further details; it is more likely this individual is intentionally misleading the debriefers. Ibn al-Shaykh has been undergoing debriefs for several weeks and may be describing scenarios to the debriefers that he knows will retain their interest.&lt;ref name="levin_DIA"&gt;{{cite web | last = Turner | first = Kathleen, P. | title = DIA letter regarding al-Libi | publisher = Defense Intelligence Agency | date = 26 October 2005 | url = http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2005/DIAletter.102605.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate = 18 November 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20051124115650/http://levin.senate.gov/newsroom/supporting/2005/DIAletter.102605.pdf | archivedate = 24 November 2005 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* A CIA report in January 2003 voiced similar concerns, also noting that al-Libi was "not in a position to know" the things he had told interrogators.&lt;ref name="newsweek_deadlink" /&gt; The CIA recalled all of its intelligence reports that were based on al-Libi's testimony in February 2004.
* It was revealed in December 2005 that al-Libi lied about this, and other, information regarding Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda in order to avoid harsh treatment by his [[Egypt]]ian captors, to whom he had been transferred under the controversial American policy of [[extraordinary rendition]].&lt;ref name=newyorktimes_jehl_09122005&gt;{{cite news | first=Douglas | last=Jehl | title=Qaeda-Iraq Link U.S. Cited Is Tied to Coercion Claim | date=9 December 2005 |work=New York Times | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/09/politics/09intel.html | accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1997 ===
* On 7 December 1997, in a meeting between U.S. and [[Taliban]] officials, the Taliban's acting Minister of Mines and Industry, Armad Jan, tells the U.S. [[Assistant Secretary of State for South and Central Asian Affairs]], [[Karl Inderfurth]], that the Taliban "had frustrated Iranian and Iraqi efforts to contact" bin Laden.&lt;ref name="washington_times_12092003"&gt;{{cite web | title = Memo shows Iraq, Iran tried to contact bin Laden |work=The Washington Times | date = 12 September 2003 | url = http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2003/sep/12/20030912-012437-3992r | accessdate =18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Inderfurth, however, disagreed with this claim, and told ''[[The Washington Times]]'', "I never saw any evidence in anything I was doing where there were any Iraqi connections."&lt;ref name="washington_times_12092003" /&gt;  The same article also reported that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Inderfurth said he did not believe the Taliban claim was credible at the time, and that he had no recollection of Taliban officials mentioning Iraqi or Iranian attempts to meet bin Laden in the following 19 meetings he would attend with the de facto Afghan regime for the next four years.&lt;ref name="washington_times_12092003" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== Circa 1998, Baghdad ====
[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], Al-Qaeda second-in-command, allegedly meets [[Taha Yasin Ramadan]], Iraqi vice-president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Who's who in Iraq | date=6 August 2002 |work=BBC News   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2174293.stm | accessdate=5 August 2008 | first=Paul | last=Reynolds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Circa 1998, Washington D.C. ====
[[Daniel Benjamin]], head of the [[United States National Security Council|U.S. National Security Council]]'s counterterrorism division, heads an exercise aimed at a critical analysis of the CIA's contention that Iraq and al Qaeda would not team up. "This was a red-team effort," he said. "We looked at this as an opportunity to disprove the conventional wisdom, and basically we came to the conclusion that the CIA had this one right."   He further stated that

&lt;blockquote&gt;No one disputes that there have been contacts over the years. In that part of the America-hating universe, contacts happen. But that's still a long way from suggesting that they were really working together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0803-04.htm |title=Questions Grow Over Iraq Links to Qaeda |publisher=Commondreams.org |accessdate=7 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061122072436/http://www.commondreams.org/headlines03/0803-04.htm |archivedate=22 November 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== 23 February, Afghanistan ====
Osama bin Laden issues a [[Fatwā|fatwa]] urging jihad against all Americans. In his fatwa, bin Laden states

&lt;blockquote&gt;The ruling to kill the Americans and their allies – civilians and military – is an individual duty for every Muslim who can do it in any country in which it is possible to do it, in order to liberate the al-Aqsa Mosque and the holy mosque [Mecca] from their grip, and in order for their armies to move out of all the lands of Islam, defeated and unable to threaten any Muslim.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He also states that one of his reasons for the fatwa is the "Americans' continuing aggression against the Iraqi people."  Bin Laden mentions aggression against Iraq four times in the fatwa. A more important reason is the perceived American aggression against Muslims, which is mentioned seven times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/terrorism/international/fatwa_1998.html |title=Online NewsHour: Al Qaeda's 1998 Fatwa | publisher=[[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] |date=23 February 1998 | accessdate=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== March, Baghdad ====
*According to Inigo Gilmore of London's ''Telegraph'', the Iraqi Intelligence Service, i.e., the Mukhabarat, arranged for an envoy from bin Laden to travel from Sudan to Baghdad to meet with Iraqi officials. Gilmore's claim is based on three stapled pages that he claims to have found in the Mukhabarat headquarters in early 2003, which he smuggled out of the building while it was guarded by American troops. Gilmore stated that the CIA had already been through the building for intelligence "but they seem to have missed this particular document."&lt;ref name="bbc_27april"&gt;{{cite news | title=Iraq files 'show al-Qaeda link' | date=27 April 2003 |work=BBC News   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2979405.stm | accessdate=25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the handwritten documents, the Al-Qaeda envoy stayed at the al-Mansour Melia, a first class hotel. A letter with this document states that the envoy was a trusted confidant of bin Laden. It also reads

&lt;blockquote&gt;According to the above, we suggest permission to call the Khartoum station [Iraq's intelligence office in Sudan] to facilitate the travel arrangements for the above-mentioned person to Iraq. And that our body carry all the travel and hotel costs inside Iraq to gain the knowledge of the message from bin Laden and to convey to his envoy an oral message from us to bin Laden.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The letter refers to al-Qaeda's leader as an opponent of the Saudi Arabian regime and says that the message to be conveyed to bin Laden through the envoy "would relate to the future of our relationship with him, bin Laden, and to achieve a direct meeting with him." The meeting was allegedly extended by a week and the document "recommends contacts with bin Laden."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F04%2F27%2Fwalq27.xml |title=The proof that Saddam worked with bin Laden – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=7 July 2009 | location=London |first=Peter |last=Oborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Based on these documents the ''Telegraph'' stated that these "Iraqi intelligence documents discovered in Baghdad by The Telegraph have provided the first evidence of a direct link between Osama bin Laden's al-Qa'eda terrorist network and Saddam Hussein's regime."
*According to the ''Observer'', however, these Baghdad talks "are thought to have ended disastrously for the Iraqis, as bin Laden rejected any kind of alliance, preferring to pursue his own policy of global jihad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/alqaida/story/0,12469,944589,00.html |title=Saddam 'held talks on alliance with al-Qaeda', Special reports, Guardian Unlimited |work=Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=7 July 2009  | date=27 April 2003 | first=Martin | last=Bright}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== August, Khartoum ====
* U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]] orders eighty [[Tomahawk (missile)|Tomahawk missiles]] fired at targets in Afghanistan and Sudan, including the [[Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory]]. The Clinton Administration claimed the factory was actually a [[chemical weapons]] plant operated by al-Qaeda.
*Clinton's [[United States Secretary of Defense|Secretary of Defense]] [[William Cohen]] would testify to the [[9/11 Commission]] in 2004 that intelligence officials suspected "indirect links between the facility and bin Laden and the Iraqi chemical weapons program." He also noted that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The direct physical evidence from the scene obtained at that time convinced the U.S. intelligence community that their suspicions were correct about the facility's chemical weapons role and that there was a risk of chemical agents getting into the hands of al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name="fas_cohen_statement"&gt;{{cite web | last = Cohen | first = William S. | title = Statement of William S.

Officials later acknowledged, however, that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the evidence that prompted President Clinton to order the missile strike on the Shifa plant was not as solid as first portrayed. Indeed, officials later said that there was no proof that the plant had been manufacturing or storing nerve gas, as initially suspected by the Americans, or had been linked to Osama bin Laden, who was a resident of Khartoum in the 1980s.&lt;ref name=nyt_lacey&gt;{{cite news | title=Look at the Place!

*The [[Bureau of Intelligence and Research]] of the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] wrote a report in 1999 questioning the attack on the factory, in which it suggested that the connection to bin Laden was not accurate. James Risen reported in the ''New York Times''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Now, the analysts renewed their doubts and told Assistant Secretary of State [[Phyllis E. Oakley|Phyllis Oakley]] that the C.I.A.'s evidence on which the attack was based was inadequate. Ms. Oakley asked them to double-check; perhaps there was some intelligence they had not yet seen. The answer came back quickly: There was no additional evidence. Ms. Oakley called a meeting of key aides and a consensus emerged: Contrary to what the Administration was saying, the case tying Al Shifa to Mr. bin Laden or to chemical weapons was weak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/sudbous.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000831005711/http://www.library.cornell.edu/colldev/mideast/sudbous.htm |archivedate=2000-08-31 |title=To Bomb Sudan Plant, or Not: A Year Later, Debates Rankle}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

So far, the U.S. has refused the invitation to investigate and also to officially apologize for the attacks, suggesting that some still privately suspect that chemical weapons activity existed there.&lt;ref name=nyt_lacey /&gt;

==== August, Pakistan ====
Stephen Hayes of the ''[[Weekly Standard]]'' reported that this month, according to a "Summary of Evidence" released by the [[The Pentagon|Pentagon]] in March 2005 concerning a detainee held at the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], that this former [[infantry]]man of the [[Iraqi Army]] who became an al-Qaeda agent traveled to Pakistan with a member of Iraqi intelligence "for the purpose of blowing up the Pakistan, United States and British Embassies with chemical mortars."&lt;ref name="weeklystandard_hayes"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hayes | first = Stephen F. | last2 = Joscelyn | first2 = Thomas | title = The Mother of All Connections | work=The Weekly Standard | date = 18 July 2005 | url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/804yqqnr.asp | accessdate =25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Associated Press]] report of the same document, however, includes the caveat

&lt;blockquote&gt;There is no indication the Iraqi's purported terror-related activities were on behalf of Saddam Hussein's government, other than the brief mention of him [the detainee] traveling to Pakistan with a member of the Iraqi intelligence.&amp;nbsp;...

*After reading the indictment, [[Richard A. Clarke]] sent a memo via email to the [[National Security Advisor (United States)|U.S. National Security Advisor]] [[Sandy Berger]] in which he stated that the Al-Shifa pharmaceutical factory was "probably a direct result of the Iraq-Al Qaida agreement."&lt;ref name="911_report_p128"&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 128 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2001, however, based on several reviews of the evidence prompted by the Bush Administration, Clarke changed his view. To date, no evidence of such an "understanding" or "agreement" has ever materialized. Clarke notes in his book ''[[Against All Enemies]]'' that many of the contacts cited by supporters of the invasion as proof of Iraq and al-Qaeda cooperation "actually proved that al Qaeda and Iraq had not succeeded in establishing a ''[[modus vivendi]]''."&lt;ref name="richard_a_clarke"&gt;{{cite book | last = Clarke | first = Richard A. | title = Against All Enemies: Inside America's War on Terror | publisher=Free Press | date = 14 September 2004 | pages = 269 | isbn = 978-0-7432-6045-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== December ====
After President Clinton ordered a four-day bombing campaign of Iraq, known as [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]], the Arabic language daily newspaper ''[[Al-Quds Al-Arabi]]'' speculated in an editorial that

&lt;blockquote&gt;President Saddam Hussein, whose country was subjected to a four-day air strike, will look for support in taking revenge on the United States and Britain by cooperating with Saudi oppositionist Osama bin Laden, whom the United States considers to be the most wanted person in the world.&lt;ref name="weeklystandard_joscelyn"&gt;{{cite web | last = Joscelyn | first = Thomas | title = The Four-Day War | work=The Weekly Standard | date = 19 July 2005 | url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/850ikvwv.asp?pg=2 | accessdate =25 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Saddam Hussayn and Usama bin Ladin have sealed a pact. Faruk Hidjazi, the former Director of the Iraqi Secret Services and now the country's Ambassador to Turkey, held a secret meeting with the extremist leader on 21&amp;nbsp;December.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The newspaper had quotes from Hijazi, without specifying the source of the quotes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |date=9 July 2004 |title=Report of the Select Committee on Intelligence on the U. S.

=== 1999 ===

==== January ====
''[[Newsweek]] ''magazine reported that Saddam Hussein is joining forces with al-Qaeda to launch joint terror strikes against the US and the UK.&lt;ref name="newsweek_133_2_34"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dickey | first = Christopher | last2 = Vistica | first2 = Gregory L. | last3 = Watson | first3 = Russell | title = Saddam + Bin Laden? | journal=Newsweek | volume = 133 | issue = 2 | pages = 34–36 | publisher=The Newsweek Daily Beast Company | location = New York, New York | date = 11 January 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An Arab intelligence officer, reported to know Saddam personally, told ''Newsweek:'' "very soon, you will be witnessing large-scale terrorist activity by the Iraqis."&lt;ref name="newsweek_133_2_34" /&gt; The planned attacks were said to be Saddam's revenge for the "continuing aggression" posed by the [[Iraqi no-fly zones|no-fly zones]] that showed the countries were still at war since [[Bombing of Iraq (December 1998)|Operation Desert Fox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emergency.com/1999/bnldn99a.htm |title=Update: Summary of Recent EmergencyNet News Reports on Osama Bin Laden and the Al-Qaeda Organization – 1&amp;nbsp;Jan&amp;nbsp;99 to 5 Jan 99 |publisher=Emergency.com |accessdate=7 July 2009| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071219042854/http://www.emergency.com/1999/bnldn99a.htm| archivedate = 19 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The planned attacks never materialized, and at the time officials questioned the validity of the claim.

The same ''Newsweek'' article also said

&lt;blockquote&gt;Saddam may think he's too good for such an association [with bin Laden]. Jerold Post, a political psychologist and government consultant who has profiled Saddam, says he thinks of himself as a world leader like Castro or Tito, not a thug. 'I'm skeptical that Saddam would resort to terrorism,' says a well informed administration official.&lt;ref name="newsweek_133_2_34" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== 14 January ====
*[[ABC News]] reports that a few months after the [[1998 United States embassy bombings|embassy bombings in Africa]], and the [[Operation Infinite Reach|U.S. retaliation against Sudan and Afghanistan]], bin Laden "reaches out to his friends in Iraq and Sudan." The report states

&lt;blockquote&gt;ABC News has learned that in December, an Iraqi intelligence chief, named Farouk Hijazi, now Iraq's ambassador to Turkey, made a secret trip to Afghanistan to meet with bin Laden. Three intelligence agencies tell ABC News they cannot be certain what was discussed, but almost certainly, they say, bin Laden has been told he would be welcome in Baghdad.&lt;ref name="reasonsforwarwithiraq_jan1999"&gt;{{cite web | title = ABC News:  Iraqi intelligence chief met with bin Laden in December 1998  | work=ReasonsforWarWithIraq.com | date = 14 January 1999 | url = http://www.reasons-for-war-with-iraq.info/abcnews_1-14-99.html | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This story is repeated by [[CNN]] on 13 February. The article reports that "Iraqi President Saddam Hussein has offered asylum to bin Laden, who openly supports Iraq against the Western powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/13/afghan.binladen/ |publisher=CNN |title=Bin Laden reportedly leaves Afghanistan, whereabouts unknown |date=13 February 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010428203227/http://www.cnn.com/WORLD/meast/9902/13/afghan.binladen/ |archivedate=2001-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the [[9/11 Commission]] report, in February 1999 [[Richard A. Clarke|Richard Clarke]] was nervous about [flying a [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] mission over Afghanistan to build a baseline of intelligence] because he continued to fear that Bin Laden might leave for someplace less accessible, such as Baghdad.&lt;ref name="911_report_p134"&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 134 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote to Deputy National Security Advisor Donald Kerrick that one reliable source reported that Bin Laden had met Iraqi officials, who may have offered him asylum. Other intelligence sources said that some Taliban leaders, though not [[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Mohammed Omar]], had urged Bin Laden to go to Iraq. If Bin Laden actually moved to Iraq, wrote Clarke, his network would be at Saddam Hussein's service, and it would be 'virtually impossible' to find him. Better to get Bin Laden in Afghanistan, Clarke declared.&lt;ref name="911_report_p134" /&gt;
*In 2003, however, former CIA counterterrorism official Vincent Cannistraro told ''[[Newsweek]]'' during an interview that bin Laden rejected Hijazi's overtures, concluding that he did not want to be "exploited" by Iraq's secular regime.&lt;ref name="newsweek20031119" /&gt; Hijazi, arrested in April 2003, reportedly "cut a deal [with American officials who] are using him to reactivate the old Iraqi intelligence network."&lt;ref name="newyorker_hirsch_2003"&gt;{{cite web | last = Hirsch | first = Seymour M. | title = Will the counter-insurgency plan in Iraq repeat the mistakes of Vietnam? | work=The New Yorker | date = 15 September 2003 | url = http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2003/12/15/031215fa_fact | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A similar opinion was expressed by ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', which reported

&lt;blockquote&gt;Indeed, intelligence agencies tracked contacts between Iraqi agents and Al Qaeda agents in the '90s in Sudan and Afghanistan, where bin Laden is believed to have met with Farouk Hijazi, head of Iraqi intelligence. But current and former intelligence specialists caution that such meetings occur just as often between enemies as friends. Spies frequently make contact with rogue groups to size up their intentions, gauge their strength, or try to infiltrate their ranks, they said.&lt;ref name="bostonglobe_canellos"&gt;{{cite web | last = Canellos | first = Peter S. | last2 = Bender | first2 = Bryan | title = Questions Grow Over Iraq Links to Qaeda | work=Boston Globe | date = 3 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==== 31 January ====
A 2005 article in ''The Weekly Standard'' claimed that the [[Russia]]n [[State media|state-owned]] [[news agency]] ''[[RIA Novosti]]'' reported in 1999 that

&lt;blockquote&gt;hundreds of Afghan Arabs are undergoing sabotage training in Southern Iraq and are preparing for armed actions on the Iraqi-Kuwaiti border. They have declared as their goal a fight against the interests of the United States in the region.&lt;ref name="weeklystandard_joscelyn" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the same article, ''The Weekly Standard'' claimed that the Kuwaiti government detained some al Qaeda members at the border but notes that the Kuwaiti government did not respond to requests for more information about these alleged detainees.

==== May, Iraq ====
*According to documents summarized by the [[U.S. Joint Forces Command]]'s [[Iraqi Perspectives Project]], [[Uday Hussein]] ordered the Saddam Fedayeen to prepare for "special operations, assassinations, and bombings, for the centers and traitor symbols in London, Iran and the self-ruled areas &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[Kurdistan]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;". The special operation was referred to as 'Blessed July,' which was described by defense analyst Kevin Woods as "a regime-directed wave of 'martyrdom' operations against targets in the West."
*Woods claims that plans for 'Blessed July' "were well under way at the time of the coalition invasion." He also notes that the Fedayeen was racked by corruption.  "In the years preceding the coalition invasion," he says, "Iraq's leaders had become enamored of the belief that the spirit of the Fedayeen's 'Arab warriors' would allow them to overcome the Americans' advantages. In the end, however, the Fedayeen fighters proved totally unprepared for the kind of war they were asked to fight, and they died by the thousands."&lt;ref name="foreignaffairs_woods"&gt;{{cite web | last = Woods | first = Kevin | last2 = Lacey | first2 = James | last3 = Murray | first3 = Williamson | title = Saddam's Delusions: The View From the Inside | work=Foreign Affairs | date = May–June 2006 | url = http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/61701/kevin-woods-james-lacey-and-williamson-murray/saddams-delusions-the-view-from-the-inside | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Saddam Hussein allegedly cuts off all contact with al-Qaeda, according to Khalil Ibrahim Abdallah, a former Iraqi intelligence officer in U.S. custody.&lt;ref name="newsweek20031119" /&gt;

*[[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], the al-Qaeda second-in-command, allegedly visits Iraq under a pseudonym to attend the ninth Popular Islamic Congress, according to the Iraqi politician [[Iyad Allawi]].&lt;ref name="adnki_dead"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Terrorism&amp;loid=8.0.169852178&amp;par=0 |title=IRAQ: FORMER PM REVEALS SECRET SERVICE DATA ON BIRTH OF AL-QAEDA IN IRAQ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050525065233/http://www.adnki.com/index_2Level.php?cat=Terrorism&amp;loid=8.0.169852178&amp;par=0 |archivedate=2005-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Farouk Hijazi allegedly orchestrated the visit.
*According to [[Stephen F.

==== Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia ====
*An Iraqi national with connections to the Iraqi embassy, and possibly a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] in the [[Fedayeen Saddam]], Ahmad Hikmat Shakir al-Azzawi, supposedly helped arrange a top-level al-Qaeda meeting attended by two of the 9/11 hijackers, [[Khalid al-Midhar]] and [[Nawaf al-Hazmi]], and by [[Walid bin 'Attash|Tawfiq bin Attash]], who was responsible for the [[USS Cole bombing]].&lt;ref name="911_report_p159"&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 159 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =29 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two unidentified Iraqi men are arrested in Germany on suspicion of spying.&lt;ref name="nci_20010301"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nci.org/iraq/iraq-frg-ap3101.htm |title=Germany Arrests Two Iraqis Suspected of Spying |location=Heidelberg; Iraq; Baghdad; Berlin; Karlsruhe; Wiesbaden; Germany; Israel; Egypt; Kuwait |publisher=Nci.org |date=1 March 2001 |accessdate=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010722235905/http://www.nci.org/iraq/iraq-frg-ap3101.htm |archivedate=2001-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnews_March01201"&gt;{{cite news |title=Germany arrests two 'Iraqi spies' |date=1 March 2001 |work=BBC News   | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/1196283.stm | accessdate=5 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''The Weekly Standard'', an Arabic newspaper in Paris called ''Al-Watan al-Arabi'' reported

&lt;blockquote&gt;The arrests came in the wake of reports that Iraq was reorganizing the external branches of its intelligence service and that it had drawn up a plan to strike at US interests around the world through a network of alliances with extremist fundamentalist parties.&lt;ref name="weeklystandard_morrissey_Aug242005"&gt;{{cite web | last = Morrissey | first = Edward | title = Rethinking Prague | work=The Weekly Standard | date = 24 August 2005 | url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/005/981wymiq.asp | accessdate =30 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The same article also reported that

&lt;blockquote&gt;The most serious report contained information that Iraq and Osama bin Ladin were working together. German authorities were surprised by the arrest of the two Iraqi agents and the discovery of Iraqi intelligence activities in several German cities. German authorities, acting on CIA recommendations, had been focused on monitoring the activities of Islamic groups linked to bin Ladin. They discovered the two Iraqi agents by chance and uncovered what they considered to be serious indications of cooperation between Iraq and bin Ladin. The matter was considered so important that a special team of CIA and FBI agents was sent to Germany to interrogate the two Iraqi spies.&lt;ref name="weeklystandard_morrissey_Aug242005" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This report and the interrogation records of the detained Iraqi agents were not discussed in the 9/11 Commission Report, and do not seem to be mentioned in other media sources. It is not known whether the arrests revealed any cooperation between the men and either Iraqi intelligence or al Qaeda.

==== 8 April, Prague, Czech Republic ====
*The Czech counterintelligence service claimed that Mohamed Atta al-Sayed, 9/11 hijacker, met with Ahmad Samir al-Ani, the [[Consulate general|consul]] at the Iraqi Embassy in [[Prague]], in a cafe in Prague. This claim is generally considered to be false (see [[Mohamed Atta's alleged Prague connection]]). According to columnist [[Robert Novak]], Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld "confirmed published reports that there is no evidence placing the presumed leader of the terrorist attacks in the Czech capital."&lt;ref name="novak_chicagost_2002"&gt;{{cite web | last = Novak | first = Robert | title = On Atta, Prague and Iraq Why some still insist hijacker met with Saddam's spy when there's no evidence supporting it  |work=Chicago Sun-Times | date = 13 May 2002 | url = http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-1444344.html | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the January 2003 CIA report ''Iraqi Support for Terrorism'', "the most reliable reporting to date casts doubt on this possibility" that such a meeting occurred.&lt;ref&gt;States News Service, 15 April 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

*Director of Central Intelligence George Tenet released "the most complete public assessment by the agency on the issue" in a statement to the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Senate Armed Services Committee]] in July 2004, stating that the CIA was "increasingly skeptical" any such meeting took place.&lt;ref name="jehl_sfgate_2004"&gt;{{cite news | last = Jehl | first = Douglas | title = CIA doubts hijacker met with Iraq agent | work=San Francisco Chronicle | date = 9 July 2004 | url = http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?file=/chronicle/archive/2004/07/09/MNG267J1N51.DTL | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*John McLaughlin, who at the time was the Deputy Director of the CIA, described the extent of the Agency's investigation into the claim

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, on something like the Atta meeting in Prague, we went over that every which way from Sunday. We looked at it from every conceivable angle. We peeled open the source, examined the chain of acquisition. We looked at photographs. We looked at timetables. We looked at who was where and when. It is wrong to say that we didn't look at it. In fact, we looked at it with extraordinary care and intensity and fidelity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/darkside/interviews/mclaughlin.html |title=FRONTLINE: The Dark Side: Interviews: John McLaughlin, PBS |publisher=PBS |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The source for the claim that the meeting did occur was based on a contact that the Czech intelligence had within the Iraqi embassy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Edward Jay Epstein |url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110007584 |title=The Wall Street Journal Online – Featured Article |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |date=22 November 2005 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was described in the ''[[Boston Globe]]'' as "a single informant from Prague's Arab community who saw Atta's picture in the news after the 11&amp;nbsp;September attacks, and who later told his handlers that he had seen him meeting with Ani. Some officials have called the source unreliable."&lt;ref name="whitmore_bostonglobe_2004"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/world/europe/articles/2004/09/19/a_911_legacy_confusion_over_a_name_czechs_find_error_in_tracking_atta/ | work=The Boston Globe | title=A 9/11 legacy: confusion over a name Czechs find error in tracking Atta | date=19 September 2004 | first1=Brian | last1=Whitmore}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The claim was officially stated by Czech Prime Minister [[Miloš Zeman]] and Interior Minister Stanislav Gross,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edwardjayepstein.com/2002question/prague.htm |title=Atta, Prague, Iraq |publisher=Edwardjayepstein.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the ''[[New York Times]]'' reported that Czech officials later backed away from the claim, first privately, and then later publicly after the ''[[New York Times]]'' conducted "extensive interviews with leading Czech figures."&lt;ref&gt;https://query.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40816FB34590C728EDDA90994DA404482 – link does not contain full article but the full text available via Lexis/Nexis confirms the quotes in the article&lt;/ref&gt; When rumors of the Czech officials privately backing away from the claims first appeared in the Western media, according to ''[[The Prague Post]]'', Hynek Kmonicek, the Czech envoy to the UN stated "The meeting took place." One senior Czech official who requested anonymity speculated that the media reports dismissing the meeting were the result of a "guided leak."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.praguepost.com/archivescontent/un-envoy-confirms-terrorist-meeting.html The Prague Post Online]&lt;/ref&gt;
*On 15 March 2002 David Ignatius wrote in the ''Washington Post''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Even the Czechs, who initially put out the reports about Atta's meeting with al-Ani, have gradually backed away. The Czech interior minister, Stanislav Gross, said in October that the two had met in April 2001. That version was altered slightly by Czech Prime Minister Miloš Zeman when he told CNN in November, 'Atta contacted some Iraqi agent, not to prepare the terrorist attack on [the twin towers] but to prepare [a] terrorist attack on just the building of Radio Free Europe' in Prague. Then, in December, Czech President [[Václav Havel]] retreated further, saying there was only 'a 70 percent' chance Atta met with al-Ani.&lt;ref name="ignatius_washpost_2002"&gt;{{cite web | last = Ignatius | first = David | title = Dubious Iraqi Link | work=The Washington Post | date = 15 March 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Havel, however, later "moved to quash the report once and for all"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2002/10/22/wirq22.xml |title=Havel rebuts report linking Iraq to Sept 11 – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=7 July 2009 | location=London |first=Peter |last=Oborne}}&lt;/ref&gt; by making the statement publicly to the White House, as reported in the ''New York Times''. According to the report, "Czech officials also say they have no hard evidence that Mr. Ani was involved in terrorist activities, although the government did order his ouster in late April 2001."
*The ''New York Times'' report was described as "a fabrication" by Ladislav Spacek, a spokesman for Czech president Václav Havel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hri.org/news/balkans/rferl/2002/02-10-22.rferl.html#39 |title=RFE/RL Newsline, 02-10-22 |publisher=Hri.org |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; But Spacek also "said Mr. Havel was still certain there was no factual basis behind the report that Mr. Atta met an Iraqi diplomat."&lt;ref&gt;Peter S. Green, "Havel Denies Telephoning U.S. On Iraq Meeting," ''New York Times'' (23 October 2002) p. A11&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''Times'' story was a potential embarrassment to Czech prime minister Milos Zeman after "extensive interviews with Czech and other Western intelligence officials, politicians and people close to the Czech intelligence community revealed that Mr. Zeman had prematurely disclosed an unverified report." According to an article in the ''[[Washington Post]]'' more recently, the Czechs backed off of the claim: "After months of further investigation, Czech officials determined last year that they could no longer confirm that a meeting took place, telling the Bush administration that al-Ani might have met with someone other than Atta."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jeffooi.com/MT3/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1532 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040826041153/http://www.jeffooi.com/MT3/mt-comments.cgi?entry_id=1532 |archivedate=2004-08-26 |title=Comments: Uranium: Bush bull-shitted}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=January 2014}} This perception seems confirmed by an associate of al-Ani's who suggested to a reporter that the Czech informant had mistaken another man for Atta. The associate said, "I have sat with the two of them at least twice. The double is an Iraqi who has met with the consul. If someone saw a photo of Atta he might easily mistake the two."&lt;ref name="wirq18.xml"&gt;{{cite news|last=Green |first=Peter |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml;jsessionid=5N4KDX1ALIPAJQFIQMGCM54AVCBQUJVC?xml=/news/2001/12/18/wirq18.xml |title=Iraq link to Sept 11 attack and anthrax is ruled out – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |date=18 December 2001 |accessdate=7 July 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' on 29 September 2004 also reported that a man from Pakistan named Mohammed Atta (spelling his name with two "m's" rather than one) flew to the Czech Republic in 2000, confusing the intelligence agency, who thought it was the same Mohamed Atta{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}. In September 2004, Jiří Ruzek, the former head of the [[Security Information Service]], told the Czech newspaper ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]'', "This information was verified, and it was confirmed that it was a case of the same name. That is all that I recall of it."{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}  Opposition leaders in the Czech Republic have publicly called this a failure on the part of Czech intelligence, and it is not clear that any Czech officials still stand by the story.&lt;ref name="whitmore_bostonglobe_2004" /&gt; In hopes of resolving the issue, Czech officials hoped to be given access to information from the U.S. investigation but that cooperation was not forthcoming.&lt;ref name="epstein_slate_2003"&gt;{{cite web | last = Epstein | first = Edward Jay | title = Prague Revisited: The evidence of an Iraq/al-Qaida connection hasn't gone away | work=Slate | date = 19 November 2003 | url = http://www.slate.com/id/2091354 | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the Czech police chief, [[Jiří Kolář]], said, "there were no documents showing that Atta visited Prague at any time" in 2001.&lt;ref name="wirq18.xml" /&gt; Even further doubt was cast on rumors of such a meeting in December 2003 when Al-Ani, who is in U.S. custody, reportedly denied having ever met Atta.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/13/international/Europe/13INQU.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050912001423/http://www.nytimes.com/glogin?URI=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/12/13/international/europe/13INQU.html&amp;OP=7e5de72aQ2F@DQ7B6@0cPEQ25ccgQ5D@Q5D__Q2F@Q5EQ5D@Q5EQ2F@Q262gQ7BQ252Q3FgQ26c2Q3FQ22@Q7BsQ25cQ3DQ7B@Q5EQ2F7Q24l-(Q7EgYQ22|archivedate=12 September 2005]&lt;/ref&gt; According to ''Newsweek'', it was "a denial that officials tend to believe given that they have not unearthed a scintilla of evidence that Atta was even in Prague at the time of the alleged rendezvous."&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;
*It is also notable that Atta's own religious and political convictions made him violently opposed to the Saddam regime. According to the 9/11 Commission Report

&lt;blockquote&gt;In his interactions with other students, Atta voiced virulently anti-Semitic and anti-American opinions, ranging from condemnations of what he described as a global Jewish movement centered in New York City that supposedly controlled the financial world and the media, to polemics against governments of the Arab world. To him, Saddam Hussein was an American stooge set up to give Washington an excuse to intervene in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="911_report_p161"&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 161 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The 9/11 Commission also addressed the question of an alleged Prague connection and listed many of the reasons above that such a meeting could not have taken place. The report notes that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the FBI has gathered intelligence indicating that Atta was in Virginia Beach on 4 April (as evidenced by a bank surveillance camera photo), and in Coral Springs, Florida on 11 April, where he and [[Marwan al-Shehhi|Shehhi]] leased an apartment. On 6, 9, 10, and 11&amp;nbsp;April, Atta's cellular telephone was used numerous times to call various lodging establishments in Florida from cell sites within Florida. We cannot confirm that he placed those calls. But there are no U.S. records indicating that Atta departed the country during this period."  Combining FBI and Czech intelligence investigations, "[n]o evidence has been found that Atta was in the Czech Republic in April 2001.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Commission still could not "absolutely rule out the possibility" that Atta was in Prague on 9 April traveling under an alias, but it concluded that

&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no reason for such a meeting, especially considering the risk it would pose to the operation. By April 2001, all four pilots had completed most of their training, and the muscle hijackers were about to begin entering the United States. The available evidence does not support the original Czech report of an Atta-Ani meeting.&lt;ref name="911_report_p229"&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 229 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who was a proponent of the theory that Atta had met al-Ani in Prague, acknowledged in an interview on 29 March 2006

&lt;blockquote&gt;We had one report early on from another intelligence service that suggested that the lead hijacker, Mohamed Atta, had met with Iraqi intelligence officials in Prague, Czechoslovakia. And that reporting waxed and waned where the degree of confidence in it, and so forth, has been pretty well knocked down now at this stage, that that meeting ever took place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2006/03/20060329-2.html |title=Interview of the Vice President by Tony Snow |publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  &lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to [[David Rose (journalist)|David Rose]], a reporter for ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'', [[Marwan al-Shehhi]] and [[Ziad Jarrah]], two of the 9/11 hijackers, supposedly met with an unidentified Mukhabarat officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/news/article-2395416-details/Saddam+and+al+Qaeda/article.do;jsessionid=gztqFCNR2QS04R38 |title=Saddam and al Qaeda, News, This is London |publisher=This is London |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rose claims he was told this story by members of the [[Iraqi National Congress]].

*A man known as Abu Wael, who worked with the [[Ansar al-Islam]] organization in northern Iraq, allegedly worked with al-Qaeda members from Afghanistan to set up a backup base.

*The 9/11 Commission reported

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are indications that by then (2001) the Iraqi regime tolerated and may even have helped Ansar al-Islam against the common Kurdish enemy.&lt;ref name="911_report_p61"&gt;{{cite book | title = The 9/11 Commission Report | date = 22 July 2004 | pages = 61 | url = http://govinfo.library.unt.edu/911/report/911Report.pdf | format = PDF | accessdate =18 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Furthermore, al-Shamari, sitting in a Kurdish prison, has said that Saddam Hussein supported Ansar al Islam because he wanted to "foment unrest in the pro-American Kurdish area of Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Jonathan |last=Schanzer | title = Iraqi prisoner details Saddam-al-Qaida link | work=The Weekly Standard | date = 2004-04-01 | url = http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/003/768rwsbj.asp?page=2 | accessdate =2013-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Intelligence agencies have, however, disputed such claims of support. According to [[Con Coughlin]] in the ''Telegraph'',

&lt;blockquote&gt;While the White House has attempted to link the group directly to Hussein's intelligence agents, both the CIA and MI6 insist that all their intelligence suggests the group operates in [an] area over which Saddam has no control.&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=%2Fnews%2F2003%2F02%2F02%2Fwirq202.xml |title=Powell will struggle to link Saddam with al-Qa'eda terrorism – Telegraph |publisher=Telegraph |accessdate=7 July 2009 | location=London |first=Peter |last=Oborne}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Spenser Ackerman wrote in November 2003 that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Far from being "harbored" by Saddam, Ansar al Islam operated out of northeastern Iraq, an area under Kurdish control that was being protected from Saddam's incursions by U.S. warplanes. Indeed, some of its members fought against Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war.&lt;ref name="ackerman_washingtonmonthly"&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington Monthly Online |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0311.ackerman.html |title="The Weakest Link" by Spencer Ackerman |publisher=Washingtonmonthly.com |accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*Additionally, Mullah Krekar, the leader of Ansar al-Islam, calls himself "Saddam's sworn enemy" and "scoffs" at the notion that his friend Abu Wael works with the Mukhabarat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insightnewstv.com/d80/ |title=Mullah Krekar Interview, Ansar al-Islam, Iraq |publisher=Insight News TV |accessdate=7 July 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015080217/http://www.insightnewstv.com/d80/ |archivedate=15 October 2004 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Abu Wael is described as a "former Iraqi army officer" and it is suggested that, while he may still have been working for Saddam, it was as a spy, gathering intelligence on Ansar al-Islam rather than cooperating with them.&lt;ref name="muir_bbc"&gt;{{cite news | last = Muir | first = Jim | title = 'Al-Qaeda' influence grows in Iraq |work=BBC News  | date = 24 July 2002 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/2149499.stm | accessdate =3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Jason Burke notes

&lt;blockquote&gt;Saddam may well have infiltrated the Ansar-ul-Islam with a view to monitoring the developments of the group (indeed it would be odd if he had not) but that appears to be about as far as his involvement with the group, and incidentally with al-Qaeda, goes.&lt;ref name="burke_guardian"&gt;{{cite news | last = Burke | first = Jason | title = The missing link? | work=The Guardian | date = 9 February 2003 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/feb/09/alqaida.afghanistan | accessdate =3 March 2011 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ackerman likewise notes that the "far more likely explanation" of Abu Wael's contact with Ansar al-Islam, "is that the dictator had placed an agent in the group not to aid them, as Powell implied to the Security Council, but to keep tabs on a potential threat to his own regime."&lt;ref name="burke_guardian" /&gt;  Additionally, while Mullah Krekar has expressed admiration for bin Laden, he has denied any actual links to al-Qaeda, stating, "I have never met with him, nor do I have any contacts [with him]."&lt;ref name="globalsecurity_ansar"&gt;{{cite web | first = | title = Ansar al Islam (Supporters of Islam) | work=GlobalSecurity.org | url = http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/para/ansar_al_islam.htm | accessdate =3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Belgian think tank International Crisis Group called the group "nothing more than a minor irritant in local Kurdish politics" and suggested that the alleged ties to bin Laden were the product of propaganda by the secular Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK).&lt;ref name="torontostar"&gt;{{cite news | last = Siddiqui | first = Haroon | title = Terrorists Sprouting Under Nose of American Troops? | work=Toronto Star | date = 2003-08-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ansar al-Islam was officially identified as a terrorist group by the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury on 20 February 2003, just one month before the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]], and just weeks after Powell's presentation to the United Nations,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2003/17823.htm Designation of Ansar al-Islam] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006002612/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2003/17823.htm |date=6 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and it was not until March 2004 that it was officially added to the U.S. list of Foreign Terrorist Organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/30649.htm Foreign Terrorist Organizations: Designation of Ansar al-Islam (Al), Redesignation of Three Others] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061004163705/http://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2004/30649.htm |date=4 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Ansar al-Islam's "weapons of mass destruction" research was exaggerated, according to journalist and terrorism expert [[Jason Burke]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;As one of the first journalists to enter the research facilities at the Darunta camp in eastern Afghanistan in 2001, I was struck by how crude they were. The Ansar al-Islam terrorist group's alleged chemical weapons factory in northern Iraq, which I inspected the day after its capture in 2003, was even more rudimentary.&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke, "Al-Qaeda," ''Foreign Policy'' (May–June 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*The state-run Iraqi newspaper ''Al-Nasiriya'' allegedly publishes an opinion piece written by Naeem Abd Muhalhal. The piece is said to praise Osama bin Laden and includes the following, which [[James Woolsey]] has interpreted (in testimony before Judge Baer) as a "vague" foreshadowing of the 9/11 attacks

&lt;blockquote&gt;bin Laden 'continues to smile and still thinks seriously, with the seriousness of the Bedouin of the desert about the way he will try to bomb the Pentagon after he destroys the White House.'&lt;ref name="wsj_2009_dead"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003069 |title=Featured Article |publisher=Opinionjournal.com |accessdate=7 July 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030407084402/http://www.opinionjournal.com/editorial/feature.html?id=110003069 |archivedate=2003-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The opinion piece also claims that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Bin Ladin is insisting very convincingly that he will strike America on the arm that is already hurting&lt;ref name="wsj_2009_dead" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

and that the U.S.

&lt;blockquote&gt;will curse the memory of Frank Sinatra every time he hears his songs.&lt;ref name="wsj_2009_dead" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*On the floor of the [[United States Senate]], Senator [[Ernest Hollings]] interpreted this as foreknowledge

&lt;blockquote&gt;In other words, the World Trade Towers. Here, over a year ahead of time in the open press in Iraq, they are writing that this man is planning not only to bomb the White House, but where they are already hurting, the World Trade Towers.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Senator Hollings read the opinion piece into the U.S. Congressional Record.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Congressional Record: Proceedings and Debates of the 107th Congress Second Session: Vol.148 Part 12|publisher=Government Printing Office|page=16678|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=et1MelF41-QC&amp;dq|accessdate=19 December 2015|chapter=Congressional Record – Senate (September 12, 2002)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Judge Baer also interprets this opinion piece as an allusion to the once-bombed [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].

The article also reported that

&lt;blockquote&gt;Saddam has remained out of the public eye in his network of bunkers since the military alert at the end of August and moved his two wives, Sajida and Samira, away from the presidential palaces in Baghdad to Tikrit, his home town {{convert|100|mi|km}} to the north.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While the article reports that the "US is understood to have found no hard evidence linking Baghdad directly to the kamikaze attacks," it also cites Western intelligence officials as saying that

&lt;blockquote&gt;the Iraqi leader had been providing al-Qaeda, Osama bin Laden's terrorist network, with funding, logistical back-up and advanced weapons training. His operations reached a 'frantic pace' in the past few months.&lt;ref name="berry_telegraph_2001" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

*In another article published on the same day, 23 September 2001, ''The Telegraph'' reported that

{{quote|Iraq is one of the only countries that has not sent a message of sympathy or condolence to the US in the wake of the attacks. The state-run media seems to be gloating over America's catastrophe.

*The Duelfer Report noted Saddam's reaction to the 9/11 attacks, concluding that it was a result of his paranoia

&lt;blockquote&gt;Isolated internally by his paranoia over personal security, and externally by his misreading of international events, Saddam missed a major opportunity to reduce tensions with the United States following the 11&amp;nbsp;September 2001 terrorist attacks. By failing to condemn the attacks and express sympathy to the American people, Saddam reinforced US suspicions about his connections to Al Qa'ida and certified Iraq's credentials as a rogue state. He told his ministers that after all the hardships the Iraqi people had suffered under sanctions he could not extend official condolences to the United States, the government most responsible for blocking sanctions relief. From a practical standpoint, Saddam probably also believed—mistakenly—that his behavior toward the United States was of little consequence, as sanctions were on the verge of collapse.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The internal debate among Iraqi officials, according to the Duelfer Report, suggested that these officials were wary of Iraq being wrongly associated with al-Qaeda

&lt;blockquote&gt;Some ministers recognized that the United States intended to take direct unilateral action, if it perceived that its national security was endangered, and argued that the best course of action was to 'step forward and have a talk with the Americans.' Also concerned with the assertion of a connection between Iraq and its 'terrorist allies,' they felt they must 'clarify' to the Americans that 'we are not with the terrorists'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/reports/general-reports-1/iraq_wmd_2004 |title=Comprehensive Report of the Special Advisor to the DCI on Iraq's WMD |date=30 September 2004 |website=CIA.gov |accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In November 2001, a month after the [[11 September attacks]], [[Mubarak al-Duri]] was contacted by the Sudanese intelligence who informed him that the [[FBI]] had sent Jack Cloonan and several other agents, to speak with a number of people known to have ties to Bin Laden. Al Duri and another Iraqi colleague agreed to meet with Cloonan in a [[safe house]] overseen by the intelligence service. They were asked whether there was any possible connection between [[Saddam Hussein]] and [[al-Qaeda]], and laughed stating that Bin Laden hated the dictator, who he believed was a "Scotch-drinking, woman-chasing apostate."&lt;ref name="silverstein_LAtimes_2005"&gt;{{cite news | last = Silverstein | first = Ken | title = Official Pariah Sudan Valuable to America's War on Terrorism |work=Los Angeles Times | date = 29 April 2005 | url = http://articles.latimes.com/2005/apr/29/world/fg-sudan29 | accessdate =20 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His account, which has since been repudiated by himself, the Defense Intelligence Agency and the CIA as being fabricated under duress (see below), nevertheless provides much of the basis for United States claims of the threat from Hussein's continued regime, including Secretary of State Colin Powell's speech to the UN the next year.

The DIA report suggested that al-Libi had been "intentionally misleading" his interrogators. The DIA report also cast significant doubt on the possibility of a Saddam Hussein-al-Qaeda conspiracy: "Saddam's regime is intensely secular and is wary of Islamic revolutionary movements.

Abu Zubaydah said that he was not aware of a relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida. He also said, however, that any relationship would be highly compartmented and went on to name al-Qaida members who he thought had good contacts with the Iraqis. For instance, Abu Zubaydah indicated that he had heard that an important al-Qaida associate, [[Abu Mus'ab al-Zarqawi]], and others had good relationships with Iraqi Intelligence. REDACTED. During the debriefings, Abu Zubaydah offered his opinion that it would be extremely unlikely for bin Ladin to have agreed to ally with Iraq, due to his desire to keep the organization on track with its mission and maintain its operational independence. In Iraqi Support for Terrorism, Abu Zubaydah's information is reflected as: Abu Zubaydah opined that it would have been 'extremely unlikely' for bin Laden to have agreed to "ally" with Iraq, but he acknowledged it was possible there were al-Qaida-Iraq communications or emissaries to which he was not privy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=John Pike |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/intell/library/congress/2004_rpt/iraq-wmd-intell_chapter12-l.htm |title=Report On The U.S. Intelligence Community'S Prewar Intelligence Assessments On Iraq |publisher=Globalsecurity.org |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  There have, however, been questions raised about the [[Abu Zubaydah#Controversy regarding the importance of Zubaydah's confessions|importance of Zubaydah's confessions]].

Jason Burke, author of ''Al Qaeda: The True Story of Radical Islam'', wrote that "Stories that an injured leg had been amputated in Baghdad as al-Zarqawi was cared for by Saddam Hussein's personal physicians proved false."&lt;ref&gt;Jason Burke, ''Al Qaeda: The True Story of Radical Islam'' London: [[I.B. Tauris]], 2004) {{ISBN|1-85043-666-5}} p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote that "What Powell did not say was that al-Zarqawi&amp;nbsp;... had operated independently of bin Laden, running his own training camp in the west of Afghanistan near Herat. It was a small operation and al-Zarqawi was not considered a significant player, by militants or Western and Middle Eastern intelligence services, at the time. It is likely that al-Zarqawi had some contact with bin Laden but never took the [[bay'at]] and never made any formal allegiance with the Saudi or his close associates. Instead he was one of the thousands of foreign activists living and working in Afghanistan during the late 1990s.&amp;nbsp;... al-Zarqawi was a rival, not an ally, of the Saudi." (p.&amp;nbsp;270). An Israeli intelligence official noted that when bin Laden first met Zarqawi, "it was loathing at first sight."  Mary Ann Weaver wrote, "According to several different accounts of the meeting, bin Laden distrusted and disliked al-Zarqawi immediately. He suspected that the group of Jordanian prisoners with whom al-Zarqawi had been granted amnesty earlier in the year had been infiltrated by Jordanian intelligence&amp;nbsp;... Bin Laden also disliked al-Zarqawi's swagger and the green tattoos on his left hand, which he reportedly considered un-Islamic. Had Saif al-Adel-now bin Laden's military chief-not intervened, history might be written very differently&amp;nbsp;... As an Egyptian who had attempted to overthrow his own country's army-backed regime, al-Adel saw merit in al-Zarqawi's views. Thus, after a good deal of debate within al-Qaeda, it was agreed that al-Zarqawi would be given $5,000 or so in 'seed money' to set up his own training camp outside the western Afghan city of Herat, near the Iranian border. It was about as far away as he could be from bin Laden. Saif al-Adel was designated the middleman."&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ann Weaver, "Inventing al-Zarqawi," ''Atlantic Monthly'' (July/August 2006) p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;  Counterterrorism experts told the ''Washington Post'' that while "Zarqawi accepted al-Qaeda money to set up his own training camp in Afghanistan,&amp;nbsp;... he ran it independently. While bin Laden was preparing the 11 Sept. hijacking plot, Zarqawi was focused elsewhere, scheming to topple the Jordanian monarchy and attack Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Craig Whitlock, "Death Could Shake Al-Qaeda In Iraq and Around the World," ''Washington Post'' (10 June 2006) p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Weaver writes in the ''Atlantic Monthly'' that bin Laden found Zarqawi "aggressively ambitious, abrasive, and overbearing" and that he found his hatred of Shiites divisive (bin Laden's mother is a Shiite). Weaver reports that "At least five times, in 2000 and 2001, bin Laden called al-Zarqawi to come to Kandahar and pay ''bayat'' – take an oath of allegiance—to him. Each time, al-Zarqawi refused. Under no circumstances did he want to become involved in the battle between the Northern Alliance and the Taliban. He also did not believe that either bin Laden or the Taliban was serious enough about jihad. When the United States launched its air war inside Afghanistan, on 7 October 2001, al-Zarqawi joined forces with al-Qaeda and the Taliban for the first time. He and his Jund al-Sham fought in and around Herat and Kandahar."(p.&amp;nbsp;96)  When Zarqawi finally did take the oath in October 2004, it was "only after eight months of often stormy negotiations." (p.&amp;nbsp;98). Gary Gambill writes, "While Zarqawi's network – by this time known as al-Tawhid wal-Jihad (Monotheism and Holy War) – was not completely independent of al-Qaeda, it was clearly autonomous. Zarqawi's men 'refused to march under the banner of another individual or group,' recalls Nu'man bin-Uthman, a Libyan Islamist leader now living in London who was in contact with Zarqawi at the time. During or shortly before the American-led invasion of Iraq in March 2003, Zarqawi returned to Iran, where he met with bin Laden's military chief, Muhammad Ibrahim Makawi (Saif al-Adel), who asked him to coordinate the entry of al-Qaeda operatives into Iraq through Syria. Zarqawi readily agreed and by the fall of 2003 a steady flow of Arab Islamists were infiltrating Iraq via Syria. Consequently, Zarqawi came to be recognized as the regional "emir" of Islamist terrorists in Iraq – without (until last month) having sworn fealty to bin Laden."&lt;ref name=autogenerated11&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;issue_id=3179&amp;article_id=2369019 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051225233801/http://www.jamestown.org/publications_details.php?volume_id=400&amp;issue_id=3179&amp;article_id=2369019 |archivedate=2005-12-25 |title=ABU MUSAB AL-ZARQAWI: A BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCH |first=Gary |last=Gambill}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative newsmagazine the ''Weekly Standard'', which has generally trumpeted alleged ties between Saddam and al-Qaeda, published an article concluding that Zarqawi was not tied to either. On the alleged bin Laden connection, Nixon Center terrorism experts Robert S. Leiken and Stephen Brooke wrote:''Though he met with bin Laden in Afghanistan several times, the Jordanian never joined al Qaeda. Militants have explained that Tawhid was "especially for Jordanians who did not want to join al Qaeda." A confessed Tawhid member even told his interrogators that Zarqawi was "against al Qaeda." Shortly after 9/11, a fleeing Ramzi bin al-Shibh, one of the main plotters of the attacks, appealed to Tawhid operatives for a forged visa. He could not come up with ready cash.

He also noted that "if Zarqawi's ties to al Qaeda were loose, his ties to Saddam were practically non-existent."  He argues that Saddam did not "harbor" Ansar al Islam, since they "operated out of northeastern Iraq, an area under Kurdish control that was being protected from Saddam's incursions by U.S. warplanes. Indeed, some of its members fought against Saddam during the Iran-Iraq war. Powell asserted that Saddam dispatched an agent to Ansar to forge an alliance with the Kurdish terrorists. If true, the far more likely explanation, however, is that the dictator had placed an agent in the group not to aid them, as Powell implied to the Security Council, but to keep tabs on a potential threat to his own regime."&lt;ref name=autogenerated9&gt;{{cite web|author=Washington Monthly Online |url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2003/0311.ackerman.html |title="The Weakest Link" by Spencer Ackerman |publisher=Washingtonmonthly.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  While U.S. officials now know that reports of al-Zarqawi's leg being amputated are incorrect, one official still believes that al-Zarqawi may have received medical treatment in Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/06/15/bush.alqaeda/ |title= Bush stands by al Qaeda, Saddam link – 15&amp;nbsp;Jun 2004 |publisher=CNN  |date= 15 June 2004|accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A CIA report in late 2004 concluded that there was no evidence Saddam's government was involved or even aware of this medical treatment, and found "no conclusive evidence the Saddam Hussein regime had harbored Zarqawi.

Their ideology further developed there. Of course, they accused the government, the army, and the police of heresy. This is the most dangerous group.

Counterterrorism scholar [[Loretta Napoleoni]] quotes former Jordanian parliamentarian Layth Shubaylat, who was personally acquainted with both Zarqawi and Saddam Hussein: "'First of all, I don't think the two ideologies go together, I'm sure the former Iraqi leadership saw no interest in contacting al-Zarqawi or al-Qaeda operatives.

From now on we (IIS) are not giving them this opportunity and are not on speaking terms with them."  Additionally, the claim that Abu Sayyaf is "affiliated" with al-Qaeda is controversial. Tufts professor Gary Leupp noted that the connections between the groups seem "highly tenuous" and that there had been no contact between the groups since the early 1990s:
:''What do we really know about Abu-Sayyaf's al-Qaeda connection? A brother-in-law of Osamu bin Laden, who has two Filipino wives, reportedly dispensed money to Abu Sayyaf in the early 1990s. He also, according to the first substantial CNN report on the Filipino action ("Live from the Philippines," 25 January), funded the Moro Islamic Liberation Front (MILF), which signed a ceasefire with the Arroyo government last August. Some Abu Sayyaf leaders, living and dead, may have participated in the Mujahadeen's anti-Soviet campaign in Afghanistan the 1980s. But as Arroyo notes, there does not seem to be a close al-Qaeda link to Abu Sayyaf at present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/leupp2.html |title=Gary Leupp: The Philippines As Second Front in US's Global War |publisher=Counterpunch.org |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article continued, "Officials said Rumsfeld's statement [26 September, that the U.S. government has "bulletproof" confirmation of links between Iraq and al-Qaida members, including "solid evidence" that members of the terrorist network maintain a presence in Iraq] was based in part on intercepted telephone calls, in which an al-Qaida member who apparently was passing through Baghdad was overheard calling friends or relatives, intelligence officials said.

* '''January''': The CIA releases a special Report to Congress entitled ''Iraqi Support for Terrorism''. The report states "We have reporting from reliable clandestine and press sources that (deleted) direct meetings between senior Iraqi representatives and top al-Qaida operatives took place from the early 1990s to the present." (Page 326)  The report concludes that "In contrast to the patron-client pattern between Iraq and its Palestinian surrogates, the relationship between Iraq and al-Qaida appears to more closely resemble that of two independent actors trying to exploit each other – their mutual suspicion suborned by al-Qaida's interest in Iraqi assistance, and Baghdad's interest in al-Qaida's anti-U.S. attacks…. The Intelligence Community has no credible information that Baghdad had foreknowledge of the 11 September attacks or any other al-Qaida strike."

The report also states "A variety of reporting indicates that senior al-Qa'ida leaders and Iraqi officials have discussed safehaven in Iraq. It is not clear whether the Iraqi regime made a new offer of safehaven to al-Qa'ida after 11 September 2001, but&amp;nbsp;... more than a dozen al-Qa'ida affiliated extremists converged on Baghdad in the spring and summer of 2002.

The senior Administration official told me that Tenet tends to agree with the Counterterrorist Center.

According to several intelligence officials I spoke to, the relationship between bin Laden and Saddam's regime was brokered in the early nineteen-nineties by the then de-facto leader of Sudan, the pan-Islamist radical Hassan al-Tourabi. Tourabi, sources say, persuaded the ostensibly secular Saddam to add to the Iraqi flag the words "Allahu Akbar," as a concession to Muslim radicals.

I learned of another possible connection [between Saddam and al-Qaeda] early last year, while I was interviewing Al Qaeda operatives in a Kurdish prison in Sulaimaniya. There, a man whom Kurdish intelligence officials identified as a captured Iraqi agent told me that in 1992 he served as a bodyguard to Ayman al-Zawahiri, bin Laden's deputy, when Zawahiri secretly visited Baghdad.}}

And the President had to actually admit the other day that there was no such connection.

::Ambassador Bremer: But Senator, let me just correct the record on something you said about the President. If I understood what the President said was, he said that there was not a connection between Saddam Hussein and 11 September.

::Senator Feingold: Right.

::Ambassador Bremer: He did not say that there was no connection between terrorism and Saddam.

::Senator Feingold: No, I agree with that.

::Ambassador Bremer: I just want to correct the record.

::Senator Feingold: What I am indicating is that the American people in polling believed, at the time of the invasion of Iraq, that Saddam Hussein was involved in 9/11. So what I am suggesting is, the sloppiness in this regard is unfair to the American people. And I think there was a deliberate attempt to make the American people believe that somehow there was this connection.

* '''16 June''':   U.S. attorney [[Patrick J. Fitzgerald]], who oversaw the government's case against al Qaeda members accused of bombing U.S. embassies in Africa in 1998, testifies to the 9/11 Commission. He told the Commission that a [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] indictment that mentioned ties between Iraq and al-Qaeda had been superseded by a later indictment which dropped the language because it could not be confirmed by investigators. In his testimony he states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;And the question of relationship between Iraq and al Qaeda is an interesting one. I don't have information post-2001 when I got involved in a trial, and I don't have information post-11 September. I can tell you what led to that inclusion in that sealed indictment in May and then when we superseded, which meant we broadened the charges in the Fall, we dropped that language. We understood there was a very, very intimate relationship between al Qaeda and the Sudan. They worked hand in hand. We understood there was a working relationship with Iran and Hezbollah, and they shared training. We also understood that there had been antipathy between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein because Saddam Hussein was not viewed as being religious. We did understand from people, including al-Fadl—and my recollection is that he would have described this most likely in public at the trial that we had, but I can't tell you that for sure; that was a few years ago—that at a certain point they decided that they wouldn't work against each other and that we believed a fellow in al Qaeda named Mondu Saleem, Abu Harzai the Iraqi, tried to reach a, sort of, understanding where they wouldn't work against each other. Sort of, the enemy of my enemy is my friend. And that there were indications that within Sudan when al Qaeda was there—which al Qaeda left in the summer of '96 or spring '96—there were efforts to work on joint—you know, acquiring weapons. Clearly, al Qaeda worked with the Sudan in getting those weapons in the national defense force there and the intelligence service. There were indications that al-Fadl had heard from others that Iran was involved. And they also had heard that Iraq was involved. The clearest account from al-Fadl as a Sudanese was that he had dealt directly with the Sudanese intelligence service, so we had firsthand knowledge of that. We corroborated the relationship with Iran to a lesser extent but to a solid extent. And then we had information from al-Fadl, who we believe was truthful, learning from others that there were also was efforts to try to work with Iraq. That was the basis for what we put in that indictment. Clearly, we put Sudan in the first order at that time as being the partner of al Qaeda. We understood the relationship with Iran but Iraq, we understood, went from a position where they were working against each other to a standing down against each other. And we understood they were going to explore the possibility of working on weapons together. That's my piece of what I know. I don't represent to know everything else, so I can't tell you, well, what we've learned since then. But there was that relationship that went from opposing each other to not opposing each other to possibly working with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mccarthy|first1=Andrew|title=Iraq &amp; Al Qaeda|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/81109/iraq-al-qaeda-andrew-c-mccarthy|accessdate=19 December 2015|publisher=National Review|date=17 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cheney has said he probably has intelligence the commission does not have, and 'the vice president was right when he said that,' Lehman said on NBC's '[[Meet the Press]].' Lehman said the news media were 'outrageously irresponsible' to portray the staff report as contradicting what the administration said.

* '''30 July''', [[Center for Policing Terrorism]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Formed in December 2001 out of a conglomeration of Kurdish Islamist groups, [Ansar al-Islam] is closely allied with and receives both ideological and strategic inspiration from al Qaeda. A number of Ansar members trained at al Qaeda camps in Afghanistan, and the group provided safe haven to al Qaeda and affiliated terrorist groups until its operations were disrupted during Operation Iraqi Freedom (OIF)&amp;nbsp;... In August 2002, Dr. Rohan Gunaratna, who has described Ansar as a 'very important' group within the larger framework of bin Laden's World Islamic Front for Jihad Against the Jews and Crusaders stated, '[Ansar] has received limited support from Iraq, and I stress limited.'  According to Dr. Gunaratna, Ansar received support from Iraqi agents with the specific intention of infiltrating the anti-PUK group and not to strengthen the Islamist group; Ansar remains an anti-Saddam and an anti-Western group. Some commentators would draw a different conclusion with respect to the nature of Ansar's relationship with Saddam, especially in the period immediately prior to OIF. According various reports, as well as claims made by US and PUK officials prior to OIF, the Iraqi regime helped to smuggle weapons to Ansar from Afghanistan. According to another report, PUK explosives experts believe that the Iraqi military intelligence supplied Ansar with TNT, which was in addition to other weaponry that was supplied to Ansar from areas under Baathist control. Another indication of links between al Qaeda and Saddam Hussein's regime, which the Bush administration cited, are the activities of Abu Musab Zarqawi, who is believed to have run one of Ansar's terrorist training camps in northern Iraq prior to OIF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cpt-mi.org/Ansar%20al-Islam%20Final.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060104075810/http://www.cpt-mi.org/Ansar%20al-Islam%20Final.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=4 January 2006 |title=Microsoft Word – Ansar al-Islam Final.rtf |format=PDF |accessdate=7 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In this document, Dr. Gunaratna noted that Saddam's relationship with Ansar was one of spying and infiltration rather than cooperation:

&lt;/blockquote&gt;Qassem Hussein, another Iraqi intelligence officer now in Kurdish custody, has stated that Abu Wael is the true leader within Ansar. However, Rohan Gunaratna believes that Qassem Hussein is likely to be a penetration agent with hidden loyalties to Saddam. As Ansar was anti-PUK and the PUK was supported by the U.S. Saddam was very interested to use Ansar against the PUK. Therefore, Qassem may have been providing Abu Wael with a cover story.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dr. Gunaratna concluded in his own study of the relationship between Iraq and al-Qaeda that "there is no conclusive evidence of Iraqi assistance to Al Qaeda&amp;nbsp;... The documentation and interviews indicated that Al Qaeda regarded Saddam, a secular leader, as an infidel" and warned in February 2003 that "an invasion of Iraq would give a new lease on life to existing and emerging terrorist groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalpolicy.org/security/issues/iraq/attack/2003/0219alliance.htm |title=Iraq and Al Qaeda: No Evidence of Alliance – UN Security Council – Global Policy Forum |publisher=Globalpolicy.org |date=19 February 2003 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hudayfa Azzam, Arabs who fought in Afghanistan began going to Iraq after the 11 September attacks because they wanted to flee Afghanistan and take advantage of a situation which was still stable in Iraq. The AFP quoted Hudayfa as saying, "[al Qaeda] infiltrated into Iraq with the help of Kurdish mujahideen from Afghanistan, across mountains in Iran," and when the possibility of a US-led invasion became clearer "Saddam Hussein's regime welcomed them with open arms and young Al Qaeda members entered Iraq in large numbers, setting up an organisation to confront the occupation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aina.org/news/20040830013931.jsp |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041222023420/http://www.aina.org/news/20040830013931.jsp |archivedate=2004-12-22 |title=Iraq Fertile Ground for Jihad: Azzam}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Azzam made it clear that the cooperation was caused by the imminent U.S. occupation. According to AFP:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Iraq is attracting Islamic militants from across the world determined to join the 'holy war' against the US-led occupation," the son of Osama bin Laden's mentor Abdullah Azzam told AFP in an interview. "Hundreds of Muslims from all over Arab and non-Arab countries go to Iraq to help the resistance end the occupation, spurred by the conviction that jihad is a duty against the occupier," said Hudayfa Azzam&amp;nbsp;...  "The Iraqi resistance was the fruit of the American occupation" and buyoed by the "fatwa (religious decree) which considers jihad a duty when a Muslim country is occupied," he said.&lt;ref&gt;AFP, 29 August 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Among other things, the al-Qaeda leader clarifies the relationship between Zarqawi's group and the new Iraq: "contrary to what the Americans continuously claimed, al-Qaeda did not have any connection with Saddam whatsoever. American attempts to connect Saddam to al-Qaeda were in order to create excuses and legitimate causes to invade Iraq.

And, of course, there is no question that he is in Iraq now-orchestrating many of the deadly suicide bombings and attacks on American soldiers. But before the American-led invasion, Saddam's government may never have known he was there. The reason: he used an alias and was there under what one U.S. intelligence official calls a 'false cover.' No evidence has been found showing senior Iraqi officials were even aware of his presence."

"Without mentioning him by name, President Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney, Colin L.

* '''9 December''': Doug Jehl continues to report in the ''New York Times'' on the questionable nature of al-Libi's statements regarding ties between Saddam hussein and Al Qaeda, stating that "current and former government officials" had described to him "A classified Defense Intelligence Agency report issued in February 2002 ([[#2002|see above]]) that expressed skepticism about Mr. Libi's credibility on questions related to Iraq and Al Qaeda&amp;nbsp;... based in part on the knowledge that he was no longer in American custody when he made the detailed statements, and that he might have been subjected to harsh treatment.&amp;nbsp;... They said the C.I.A.'s decision to withdraw the intelligence based on Mr. Libi's claims had been made because of his later assertions, beginning in January 2004, that he had fabricated them to obtain better treatment from his captors.&amp;nbsp;... American officials had not previously acknowledged either that Mr. Libi made the false statements in foreign custody or that Mr. Libi contended that his statements had been coerced."

Another intelligence official "rejected" the anecdotal evidence. ''Newsweek'' concluded that the briefing "helped keep the tale alive" even though it had been rejected by intelligence experts.

The papers offer insight into the history of the movement, organizational structure, tensions among leadership and the lessons learned. One of the papers examines the lessons learned from jihad in [[Syria]]; the al-Qaeda writer concluded that one of the lessons learned from that experience is the influence of secular Baathist thinking distorts the message of jihad.

"Terrorism is coming," the Iraqi leader is translated as saying.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I told the Americans a long time before 2 August [1990, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait and the U.S./Iraqi relationship changed dramatically] and told the British as well, I think Hamed was there keeping the meeting minutes with one of them, that in the future there will be terrorism with weapons of mass destruction. What prevents this technology from developing and people from smuggling it? All of this, before the stories of smuggling, before that, in 1989. I told them, 'In the future, what would prevent that we see a booby-trapped car causing a nuclear explosion in Washington or a germ or a chemical one?'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Saddam later adds, "This is coming, this story is coming but not from Iraq."

As ABC News interpreted it, Saddam was saying Iraq itself would not launch a WMD terror attack on the U.S. "I disagree completely, because Saddam also says in other tapes that the war is ongoing," Tierney said on ''Hannity &amp; Colmes.'' "And when I was there [in Iraq] as an inspector, what struck me is that these people were still in the fight. There was no change of heart like you had in Germany after World War II. They were still in the fight.

York also points out: "Tierney said he believes other tapes, which have not yet been heard, will eventually reveal that Iraq was behind the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center and the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing. Tierney also said that he believes Iraq orchestrated the 2001 anthrax attacks, with Saddam Hussein using American scientist Steven Hatfill as a 'proxy' to carry out the mission."&lt;ref name=autogenerated18 /&gt;  Reporter Sherrie Gossett wrote that the excerpts of the tapes presented at the Intelligence Summit were "vague, cryptic, nonsensical, insignificant" and notes that "the most-hyped excerpts are also subject to wide-ranging interpretations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digital-dope.blogspot.com/2006/02/about-those-saddam-tapes_22.html |title=:digital dope:: About those "Saddam Tapes" |publisher=Digital-dope.blogspot.com |date=22 February 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A spokeswoman for [[John Negroponte]], the Directorate of National Intelligence, noted that "Intelligence community analysts from the CIA and the DIA reviewed the translations and found that while fascinating from a historical perspective, the tapes do not reveal anything that changes their postwar analysis of Iraq's weapons programs, nor do they change the findings contained in the comprehensive Iraq Survey Group report."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nysun.com/article/27684?page_no=3 |title=Furor Erupts Over Recordings of Saddam – 16&amp;nbsp;February 2006 – The New York Sun |publisher=Nysun.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ABC News reporter Brian Ross commented that people on both sides of this controversy will use these tapes to support their side.

''Pillar tells Rose, "Iraq did provide other kinds of sponsorship to terrorist groups, some of the Palestinian groups that aren't so active anymore. They were also an active sponsor of the Mujahedin-e Khalq, an Iranian group, which killed Americans way back in the – in the '70s, but more recently has been focusing its aim at the clerical regime in Iran. But in terms of it having provided support or sustenance or strength, or having anything close to an alliance with al Qaeda, it simply wasn't there."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Well, what was found – and this has been the pretty consistent story all along with regard to intelligence coverage of that topic – is there were various data points that were relevant to that issue, even some encounters or meetings held years ago in Sudan, other kinds of coincidences or two different names appearing in the same place. What it all added up to in the view of the judgment – in the judgment of the intelligence analysts working those particular issues was that you had two entities, one the Saddam regime and the other al-Qaeda, that were kind of feeling each other out, trying to stay aware of what they were doing, what each other was doing, but no indication of anything that could be described as a patron-client relationship or a sponsor-client relationship or an alliance. There were some of these coincidences and contacts, but that's hardly anything out of the ordinary and not something that adds up to state sponsorship.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

:Pillar later gave an interview to [[Voice of America]], confirming that the Administration distorted intelligence findings to try to claim the opposite:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The main thing that happened there, particularly with reference to this issue of, was there a relationship between the Saddam regime and al-Qaida – was a selective use of bits and pieces of reporting to try to build the case that in this case there was some kind of alliance without really reflecting the analytic judgment of the intelligence community that there was not."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.payvand.com/news/06/feb/1158.html |title=Controversy Deepens Over Iraq Prewar Intelligence |publisher=Payvand.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* '''23 February''': [[Abdel Bari Atwan]] publishes a book titled ''The Secret History of Al-Qa'ida''. In it, he writes:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like Zarqawi, many Arabs fleeing American retaliation in Afghanistan after 9/11 found refuge with Ansar al-Islam. But then came an unexpected development. According to Dr [[Muhammad al-Masari]], a Saudi specialist on Al-Qaeda's ideology, Saddam established contact with the 'Afghan Arabs' as early as 2001, believing he would be targeted by the US once the Taliban was routed. In this version, disputed by other commentators, Saddam funded Al-Qaeda operatives to move into Iraq with the proviso that they would not undermine his regime. Sources close to the Ba'ath regime have told me that Saddam also used to send messengers to buy small plots of land from farmers in Sunni areas. In the middle of the night soldiers would bury arms and money caches for later use by the resistance. According to Masari, Saddam saw that Islam would be key to a cohesive resistance in the event of invasion. Iraqi army commanders were ordered to become practising Muslims and to adopt the language and spirit of the jihadis. On arrival in Iraq, Al-Qaeda operatives were put in touch with these commanders, who later facilitated the distribution of arms and money from Saddam's caches. Most commentators agree that Al-Qaeda was present in Iraq before the US invasion. The question is for how long and to what extent. What is known is that Zarqawi took a direct role in Al-Qaeda's infiltration. In March 2003 – it is not clear whether this was before or after the invasion began – he met Al-Qaeda's military strategist, an Egyptian called Muhammad Ibrahim Makkawi, and agreed to assist Al-Qaeda operatives entering Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middle-east-online.com/english/?id=15900 |title=Total war: Inside the new Al-Qaeda  |publisher=Middle East Online |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

These documents have been hailed by some supporters of the invasion as a possible "[[smoking gun]]" connecting Saddam's Iraq to al-Qaeda terrorists and Representative Hoekstra has been calling for their release to the public; those released so far, however, fail to provide evidence of any such connection. According to Steven Aftergood of the Federation of American Scientists, the release of the documents "looks like an effort to discover a retrospective justification for the war in Iraq."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/17/nation/na-ushussein17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150125194140/http://articles.latimes.com/2006/mar/17/nation/na-ushussein17 |archivedate=2015-01-25 |deadurl=no |title=U.S. Reveals Once-Secret Files From Hussein Regime |date=March 17, 2006 |first=Greg |last=Miller}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Pentagon cautions that the government "has made no determination regarding the authenticity of the documents, validity or factual accuracy of the information contained therein, or the quality of any translations, when available." One of the documents, which seems to have been trumpeted by Stephen Hayes earlier in the year as proof that "thousands" of al-Qaeda terrorists were trained in Iraq between 1999 and 2002 to fight in Afghanistan, is according to the Pentagon simply an investigation of a rumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents-docex/Iraq/ISGQ-2003-00004500-1.pdf |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060318155051/http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents-docex/Iraq/ISGQ-2003-00004500-1.pdf |archivedate=2006-03-18 |title=Triage Description}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Pentagon synopsis of the document reads: "Fedayeen Saddam received news of a rumor that 3,000 volunteers from Iraq and Saudi Arabia had traveled to Afghanistan to fight with the Mujahideen against the US. This letter is a request to investigate the rumor to determine whether it is true."&lt;ref name=autogenerated17 /&gt; Also present in the collection is Iraqi Intelligence correspondence from 2002 concerning suspected al-Qaeda members in Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://fmso.leavenworth.army.mil/documents-docex/Iraq/ISGZ-2004-019920.pdf| title= Iraqi Intelligence Correspondence from 2002| format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; The document includes names and photographs of suspected al-Qaeda members, including Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The Pentagon summary of the document indicates that Iraqi intelligence suspected these people to be members of al-Qaeda but provides no indication that they trained or supported them. Indeed, an [[Associated Press]] translation of the document suggests that the letter warned Iraqi agents to "be on the lookout" for Zarqawi and other al Qaeda agents; AP reports that "Attached were three responses in which agents said there was no evidence al-Zarqawi or the other man were in Iraq."&lt;ref name=autogenerated16 /&gt;  A third document, dated 15 September 2001, describes what an Afghan informant told Iraqi intelligence about statements made by Afghan consul Ahmed Dahastani. According to ABC news, the informant stated that Dahastani told him:

&lt;blockquote&gt;That OBL and the Taliban are in contact with Iraq and that a group of Taliban and bin Laden group members visited Iraq. That the U.S. has proof the Iraqi government and 'bin Laden's group' agreed to cooperate to attack targets inside America. That in case the Taliban and bin Laden's group turn out to be involved in 'these destructive operations,' the U.S. may strike Iraq and Afghanistan. That the Afghan consul heard about the issue of Iraq's relationship with 'bin Laden's group' while he was in Iran.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While stating that "the controversial claim that Osama bin Laden was cooperating with Saddam Hussein is an ongoing matter of intense debate&amp;nbsp;... [and that] the assertions contained in this document clearly support the claim," ABC questioned the sourcing of the document and concluded that "without further corroboration, this document is of limited evidentiary value."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/International/IraqCoverage/story?id=1734490&amp;page=1 |title=ABC News: Did Russian Ambassador Give Saddam the U.S. War Plan? |publisher=Abcnews.go.com |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Los Angeles Times'' notes that "the documents do not appear to offer any new evidence of illicit activity by Hussein, or hint at preparations for the insurgency that followed the invasion."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Hayden explained that he was not comfortable with Feith's analysis: "I got three great kids, but if you tell me go out and find all the bad things they've done, Hayden, I can build you a pretty good dossier, and you'd think they were pretty bad people, because that was I was looking for and that's what I'd build up.

The notebook is part of the [[Operation Iraqi Freedom documents]].

According to the translation by Robinson's team, Rahman states the following: "And he ([[Mohammed Omar|Mullah Omar]]) desires to get closer relations with Iraq and that Iraq may help us in reducing our problems. Now we are facing America and Russia. He requested the possibility of Iraq intervening to build a friendship with Russia since Russia is no more the number one enemy. And we request Iraq's help from a brotherly point of view.

We want practical steps concerning this issue and especially the relationship with the Taliban and (not clear, but could be Iraq)&amp;nbsp;... Concerning the relations between the Taliban and Iraq I was informed that they are going to start those relations in a secret manner and they are waiting for the answer and I will inform them that you will answer them through the embassy  (translator's note: could be through the Iraqi embassy of Kabul, if they had one, or Islamabad in Pakistan)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Robison |first=Ray |url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199757,00.html |title=Documents Support Saddam-Taliban Connection – International News, News of the World, Middle East News, Europe News |publisher=Fox News |date=16 June 2006 |accessdate=7 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this meeting, Rahman tells the vice president, "I met Mullah Omar the leader of Afghanistan and he welcomed the establishment of Islamic relations with Iraq and we foresee to tell them about our needs and they would like to have contacts with Russia but they feel that the Russians (unclear) with Afghanistan, they go to America (RR: probably means that the Russians side with the US against the Taliban). And they (RR: probably the Taliban) say that now we do not feel that Russia is our enemy and we do not know why they support the Northern Alliance (RR: non-Pashtun Afghani militant groups seeking to topple the Taliban). They (RR: probably the Taliban) want Iraq to intervene with Russia. According to the translation conducted by Ray Robinson's team, Rahman and Ramadan are quoted as saying:

{{quote|Fazlur Rahman: What is happening in Afghanistan is a violation of the human rights of this country, where Usama bin Laden is one person and the fate of millions cannot be tied to him. (Translator's note: Probably at that time the U.S. is forcing sanctions or pressures on Afghanistan because it is providing sanctuary to bin Laden)

Vice President: Can you blockade a country (RR: probably Afghanistan) because of the presence of one man (RR: probably referring to [[Osama bin Laden|UBL]])? This time she (America) got the resolution from the Security Council and it is number 77 (or 771) (RR: probably [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 771|Security Council Resolution 771]] in 1992 concerning Bosnia) relative to Iraq (RR: probably is making a comparison between 771 and a new resolution on Iraq most likely UNSCR 1284 passed Dec 1999 about WMD and humanitarian efforts). And it is the first time that the parliament of a country (U.S. Congress) speaks after a resolution (unclear) and comes out through the Security Council. It is ignorant to send memos and complain to the Security Council because it is a tool in the hands of America the master of oppression and if we do that it does not mean that we are boycotting the diplomatic process. Also the monetary fund (Translator's note: probably the International Monetary Fund) is in the hand of America and she helps according to her interests. My personal stand is with his (RR: probably UBL) call to fight America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,199052,00.html Terror Links to Saddam's Inner Circle] FOXNews.com&lt;/ref&gt;}}

* '''6 July''': An apparent training manual for Arab operatives working inside Afghanistan that was recovered in an Iraqi government computer file and written before the 11 September 2001 is translated by [[Fox news]]. One of the instructions states, "In rest areas a brother should not show his military ID." The training manual also instructs Arab operatives inside Afghanistan to dress like Afghan tribesmen, to avoid being followed ("Routine is the enemy of security"), to always be armed, and "to behave as if enemies would strike at any moment." The manual also cautions Arabs to "beware of rapid and spontaneous friendships with Afghans who speak Arabic," and "always make sure about the identity of your neighbors and classify them as regular people, opponents or allies." In his analysis of the document, Ray Robinson states: "The document also appears to be a professional military intelligence letter of instruction. These men have military IDs. The instruction references an intelligence manual. The letter mentions 'trusted' Afghans, so we know they are working in cooperation with forces in Afghanistan. It is highly unlikely that any military would send a semi-permanent contingent with families into Afghanistan for cooperation or training unless the Afghan organization was stable and in control. It therefore seems likely that these soldiers are working closely with the Taliban."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,202277,00.html – Iraq How-to Manual Directed Arab Military Operatives In Afghanistan] FOXNews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Postwar Findings" volume of the study concluded that there was no evidence of any Iraqi support of al-Qaeda, al-Zarqawi, or Ansar al-Islam. The "Iraqi National Congress" volume concluded that "false information" from INC-affiliated sources was used to justify key claims in the prewar intelligence debate and that this information was "widely distributed in intelligence products" prior to the war. It also concluded that the INC "attempted to influence US policy on Iraq by providing false information through defectors directed at convincing the United States that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction and had links to terrorists."  The Senate report noted that in October 2002, "the DIA cautioned that the INC was penetrated by hostile intelligence services and would use the relationship to promote its own agenda."

* '''14 September''': Washington, D.C. – In a speech to the [[Brookings Institution]], the Kurdish Deputy Prime Minister of Iraq, [[Barham Salih]], who was imprisoned in Saddam's Iraq, contradicted the Senate Report, asserting that "The alliance between the Baathists and jihadists which sustains Al Qaeda in Iraq is not new, contrary to what you may have been told. I know this at firsthand. Some of my friends were murdered by jihadists, by Al Qaeda-affiliated operatives who had been sheltered and assisted by Saddam's regime."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nysun.com/article/39631 Iraqi Official Testifies to Links Between Saddam and Al Qaeda] – 14 September 2006 – The New York Sun&lt;/ref&gt; He was referring to [[Ansar al-Islam]], an organization that the Senate Committee concluded that Saddam's government spied on, but did not support. Salih claims to have presented the CIA with evidence in 2002 of an assassination attempt against him by Ansar al-Islam that was funded by Saddam's Republican Guard. Salih acknowledges of his claim that "we could not prove this in a court of law, but this is intelligence." The Senate Report concluded that prewar interactions between Saddam Hussein's government and Ansar al-Islam were attempts by Saddam to spy on the group rather than to support or work with them. "Postwar information reveals that Baghdad viewed Ansar al-Islam as a threat to the regime and that the IIS attempted to collect intelligence on the group."

'''VIN cloning'''  or car cloning, is a practice of using a [[vehicle identification number]] (VIN) from a legally registered car to hide the identity of a stolen or salvaged vehicle.&lt;ref name=FBI1&gt;{{cite web|title=Steering Clear of Car Cloning|url=https://www.fbi.gov/news/stories/2009/march/cloning_032409|website=The Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procedure involves replacing the serial plate of a stolen or salvage repaired vehicle with a plate containing the number of a validly registered vehicle of similar make, model and year from another state, province or country.

The use of this practice by organized theft rings is partially responsible for the creation of national databases such as the [[Vehicle history report#National Motor Vehicle Title Information System|National Motor Vehicle Title Information System]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is the purpose of NMVTIS?|url=http://www.vehiclehistory.gov/nmvtis_faq.html#purpose|website=National Motor Vehicle Title Information System|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the United States and the [[Personal Property Securities Register]] in Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don't Be a victim|url=http://www.carsafe.com.au/images/stories/pdfs/NMVTRC%20Legit%20DL%20Bro%207.pdf|website=Carsafe|publisher=National Motor Vehicle Theft Reduction Council|accessdate=5 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The problem with VIN cloning is potentially very large with the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] reporting one case in Tampa, Florida, in which more than 1,000 cloned cars were sold to buyers in twenty states and several countries, with estimated losses of more than $27 million to consumers, auto insurers, and other victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Couvertier|first1=Dave|title=Car-cloning Subjects Being Sought|url=https://www.fbi.gov/tampa/press-releases/2009/ta032509.htm|website=Federal Bureau of Investigation|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  If the purchaser of a cloned vehicle has its true pedigree discovered, the car will be confiscated, and owner would still be responsible for any outstanding loans. 

In some states in the United States, the car dealership may be held responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Important Consumer Advice about Vehicle Cloning|url=http://www.flhsmv.gov/safetytips/Cloning.htm|website=Florida Department of Highway Safety and Motor Vehicles|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The owner of the legitimately registered vehicle the number belongs to, could potentially be accused of a variety of offenses – from parking tickets to serious criminal activity like organized crime. The victim could spend a great amount of time and money trying to prove that were not the owner of the cloned vehicle.

Originally the brainchild of Keith Feinstein, '''Videotopia''' is a travelling [[science museum]] exhibition documenting the history of [[video game]]s.  It is based on a larger collection of video game machines, now housed at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref name="rochester"/&gt;

==Collection==
It includes a wide range of commercial video arcade machines and game consoles, and also interactive [[multimedia]] kiosks containing information about the history of the games' development and their impact on popular culture. By 1996, the exhibit had had 20,000 attendees.&lt;ref name="NGen21"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first= |title=Videogame Expo Goes Nationwide|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=21 |publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=September 1996|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, Feinstein's collection included 300 machines, and the touring exhibit had 75 of them.&lt;ref name="forbes"/&gt; By 2009 the touring exhibition included 100 machines, and the collection amounted to 15,000 items relating to video games.&lt;ref name="rochester"&gt;Laura Keeney. "Play on, player". Rochester City Newspaper, July 8, 2009. http://www.rochestercitynewspaper.com/entertainment/family/2009/07/REVIEW-Videotopia/&lt;/ref&gt;

Videotopia was operated by Feinstein's longtime curatorial partner Jeff Anderson, who maintained the exhibit's vast game collection, based in [[New Jersey]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}  Later Jon-Paul Dyson took over and the collection moved to the International Center for the History of Electronic Games at [[The Strong]] in [[Rochester, New York]].&lt;ref name="rochester"/&gt;

Videotopia has been featured at numerous science museums in the U.S., such as the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], as well as overseas and in selected performances of [[Video Games Live]].  Videotopia has been featured on television on [[CBS]]: [[The Early Show|This Morning]], the [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]], [[CNN]], [[CNBC]], and many local television news programs{{citation needed|date=February 2012}} and written about in ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine,&lt;ref name="forbes"&gt;Don Steinberg, "Giving Pac-Man his due", Forbes, March 23, 1998 https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1998/0323/6106184a.html&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[USA Today]]'', [[Technology Review]], TICKET,{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} and ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]''.&lt;ref name="NGen21"/&gt;

== History ==	
The history of laws and cultural [[Taboo|taboos]] have a current effect on how new sexual assault [[Law|laws]] are drafted, how the laws are applied by [[law enforcement]] and how [[police]] decide whether to [[arrest]] a suspected perpetrator. The history of sexual assault [[Prosecutor|prosecutions]] influences whether or not current cases are taken to [[court]]. Judges and [[Jury|juries]] make decisions to [[Conviction|convict]] based upon their past knowledge on the topic of sexual assault.&lt;ref name = Tracy&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tracy|first=Carol Lee|last2=Fromson|first2=Terry L.|last3=Long|first3=Jennifer Gentile|last4=AEquitas|first4=Charlene Whitman|date=June 5, 2012|title=Rape and Sexual Assault in the Legal System, Presented to the National Research Council of the National Academies Panel on Measuring Rape and Sexual Assault in the Bureau of Justice Statistics Household Surveys Committee on National Statistics|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=National Academies Workshop on Measuring Rape and Sexual Assault in Bureau of Justice Statistics Surveys}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Media ==
The imagery of women being sexually victimized in advertisements, pornography, films and music videos has been shown to increase support for violence toward women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In a study published in 2008, it was found that in nearly 2,000 print advertisements of 58 magazines popular in the United States, 50% of ads depicted women as [[Sexual objectification|sex objects]], appearing as a victim in about 10% of advertisements. The main magazines featuring sexual objectification of women were of the fashion and adolescent topics. These advertisements often portrayed women in various positions and expressions that were derived from pornography. The study also stated that women in the United States feel that rape is "trivialized in American culture" and concluded that "media imagery that presents women as both sex object and as victims" has possibly contributed to this trivialization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A 2016 study regarding the objectification of women in the media found that men's magazines, [[reality television]] and pornography brought upon more thoughts of objectification, which in turn led to more support of violence toward women. In the study's results, it is stated "the relationship between objectifying media exposure and attitudes supportive of violence against women was fully mediated by notions of women as sex objects".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Effects of Violence Against Women ==
Violence against women can lead to immediate physical injuries and longer-term mental and physical health conditions. In addition to negatively impacting mental and physical health, violence against women can interfere with life at work, home, and school. In some cases, violence results in death.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/effects-violence-against-women|title=Health effects of violence|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Children exposed to violence are also at risk for developing mental and physical health problems. Depending on their age, children may react differently to exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/relationships-and-safety/domestic-violence/effects-domestic-violence-children|title=Domestic violence and children|website=womenshealth.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of violence==

=== Domestic violence ===
{{Main|Domestic violence in the United States}}
According to the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] and the [[National Institute of Justice]], about 1 in every 4 women suffer from at least one physical assault experience from a partner during adulthood.&lt;ref name="VAWA2005"&gt;[http://nnedv.org/docs/Policy/VAWA2005FactSheet.pdf ''The Violence Against Women Act of 2005, Summary of Provisions.''] National Network to End Domestic Violence. Retrieved 2011-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2007 report found that in about 64% of female homicides were perpetrated by a partner or family member.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.amnestyusa.org/us/violence-against-women-is-a-u-s-problem-too/|title=Violence Against Women Is A U.S. Problem, Too|last=|first=|date=2011-06-11|work=[[Amnesty International]]|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intimate partner abuse may also include other types behavior considered abusive. These are instances in which one partner seeks to control finances, force isolation from friends and family and dominate the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://statusofwomendata.org/explore-the-data/violence-safety/violence-and-safety-full-section/|title=Violence and Safety Full Section - Women in the States|work=Women in the States|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women who have been identified as being at a higher risk for domestic and sexual abuse are older women, those living in rural communities, disabled women and immigrants. Addressing and preventing such violence may be difficult because some women do not have nearby access to victim services. A women may also have language barriers, economic and psychological dependence on the perpetrator.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In some instances of violence, a woman and her children may not be able to procure housing apart from the perpetrator. Between 22-57%  and of these women become [[Homelessness|homeless]]. Due to housing regulations that practice a 'no tolerance' policy requiring eviction of all household members when even one person is convicted of any crime, battered women can then be homeless as a result. This practice essentially creates a disincentive for reporting violence in the home. Some women who have experienced violence in the home risk the loss of their jobs related to their need for medical treatment, counselling, finding new housing and legal protection.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Rape ===
{{Main|Rape in the United States}}
The percentage of women who have been raped in the United States is between 15% and 20%, with various studies disagreeing with each other. (''National Violence Against Women'' survey in 1995, 17.6% rate;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles/172837.pdf Prevalence, Incidence, and Consequences of Violence Against Women: Findings From the National Violence Against Women Survey].

About 500 women were raped per day in the United States in 2008.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; About 21.8% of rapes of female victims in the United States are [[Gang rape|gang rapes]].&lt;ref name="Horvath, Miranda 2013, page 15"&gt;Horvath, Miranda et al. ''Handbook on the Study of Multiple Perpetrator Rape''. Routledge 2013, page 15.&lt;/ref&gt; 

A March 2013 report from the [[United States Department of Justice]]’s [[Bureau of Justice Statistics]], from 1995 to 2010, the estimated annual rate of female rape or [[sexual assault]] had declined by 58%, from 5.0 victimizations per 1,000 females age 12 or older to 2.1 per 1,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/government/criminal-justice/female-victims-sexual-violence-1994-2010|title=Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010}} JournalistsResource.org, retrieved March 24, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Berzofsky|first1=Marcus|last2=Krebs|first2=Christopher|last3=Langton|first3=Lynn|last4=Planty|first4=Michael|last5=Smiley-McDonald|first5=Hope|date=March 7, 2013|title=Female Victims of Sexual Violence, 1994-2010|url=http://www.bjs.gov/index.cfm?ty=pbdetail&amp;iid=4594|journal=Bureau of Justice Statistics}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a study in 2013 regarding rape in the United States found that cases remain underreported.&lt;ref name="National Research Council 2013"&gt;National Research Council. ''Estimating the Incidence of Rape and Sexual Assault.'' Washington, DC: The National Academies Press, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Law enforcement in the United States also manipulates rape statistics to "create the illusion of success in fighting violent crime" according to a 2014 study.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Yung, C. R. (2014). How to Lie with Rape Statistics: America's Hidden Rape Crisis. Iowa Law Review, 99(1197).&lt;/ref&gt; When investigated, defendants are rarely convicted.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Sexual assault ===
[[File:A country comparison of rape and sexual assault rate trends, per 100000 people, 2003 - 2011, United Nations.png|thumb|250x250px|Annual rape and all forms of [[Sexual assault|sexual assaults]] per 100,000 people]]
Sexual assault differs significantly from other crimes of [[assault]]. For [[sexual assault]], the severity of the crime has been determined by establishing the victim's [[moral character]], [[behavior]], signs of resistance and verbal expressions of non-consensual participation. The crime of battery, another type of assault, is determined by the perpetrators actions and intent. The victim's response to this type of assault does not determine whether a crime has taken place or not. The victim does not have to demonstrate that they resisted, gave consent or have a history of being punched.&lt;ref name="Tracy" /&gt; In addition, the question of assault occurring after consent is given complicates the understanding of violence and injury - even if sex is consensual. Changes in the laws regarding some sexual acts may "lead to the glorification of sexual violence".&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, C. (2000) ‘Sex is Not a Sport: Consent and Violence in Criminal Law’, ''Boston College Law Review'', 42, 239–290.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Objectification ====
A 2015 study by the [[University of Nebraska]] found that college women in the United States who were victims of sexual violence or partner violence began to [[Self-objectification|self-objectificate]] themselves and felt body shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=26 March 2015|title=Violence Against Women; Studies from University of Nebraska Yield New Information about Violence Against Women (Violence Against Women through the Lens of Objectification Theory)|url=|journal=Women's Health Weekly|volume=|pages=274|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

What she produces is an addition to the capital, while his labors disappear in mere consumption}}

Since the [[European colonization of the Americas|days of European colonization]], Europeans who arrived sought to control Native American populations in order to acquire more capital and resources from the newly discovered land. This resulted in policies of genocide and removal targeting Native American women and girls in order to procure land for settlements.&lt;ref name="Volscho, Thomas W 2010" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=American Holocaust: The Conquest of the New World|last=Stannard|first=David E.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=1993|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Records have shown that Native American girls as young as eleven years-old had [[Hysterectomy|hysterectomies]] operations performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vincenti Carpio|first=Myla|date=2004|title=The Lost Generation: American Indian Women and Sterilization Abuse|url=|journal=[[Social Justice (journal)|Social Justice]]|volume=31|issue=4|pages=40-53|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding African Americans, the origin of their population control was from the [[slavery in the United States]].&lt;ref name="Volscho, Thomas W 2010" /&gt; During the period of slave trade in the United States, African slaves were used as a [[mode of production]], with slave women being forced into pregnancy to increase the slave labor force.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Racism: From Slavery to Advanced Capitalism|last=Wilson|first=Carter A.|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|year=1996|isbn=|location=[[Thousand Oaks, California]]|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This history of controlling African American populations motivated the future sterilization of African American women.&lt;ref name="Volscho, Thomas W 2010" /&gt;

In 1927, [[Supreme Court of the United States]] endorsed eugenics programs in the country. The ruling pushed the eugenics movement further and resulted in more forced sterilizations of women.&lt;ref name="Kuhl2"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UGYfRv3DWuQC&amp;pg=PA70|title=The Nazi Connection: Eugenics, American Racism, and German National Socialism|author=Kühl, Stefan|date=14 February 2002|isbn=978-0-19-534878-1|page=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Involuntary euthanasia]] was also supported by American eugenists and practiced in rare instances, with the most promoted method of euthanasia being [[Gas chamber|gas chambers]], though it never gained footing in the United States and sterilization became preference.&lt;ref name="Kuhl2" /&gt;

[[Supreme Court Justice]] [[Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr.|Oliver Wendell Holmes]] penned:&lt;ref name="Kuhl2" /&gt;

Out of these, more than 90% were assaulted by a non-tribal member. These women report not being safe, and being pushed, shoved, or beaten. Many describe 'psychological aggression' and control. These counts may be underestimated. Native tribal courts are not able to prosecute non-tribal members for sexual assault and rape. Non-Native American men are responsible for most of the assaults against Native American women.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.hcn.org/articles/tribal-affairs-why-native-american-women-still-have-the-highest-rates-of-rape-and-assault|title=Why Native American women still have the highest rates of rape and assault|access-date=2018-05-14|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological aggression has been experienced by 66.4% by their partner. In the US, greater than 1.5 million American Indian and Alaska Native women have suffered violence during their life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Over 39% of American Indian and Alaska Native women have experienced violence in the past year. Of these, 14% percent were sexually abused,  9% were assaulted by their intimate partner, 12% were stalked and 25% experienced psychological aggression by their intimate partner. In the past year, over 730,000 American Indian and Alaska Native women experienced violence.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Native American women and Alaska Native women, along with black women, have high murder rates when compared with other ethnicities.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrosky|first=Emiko|last2=Blair|first2=Janet M.|last3=Betz|first3=Carter J.|last4=Fowler|first4=Katherine A.|last5=Jack|first5=Shane P.D.|last6=Lyons|first6=Bridget H.|date=2017-07-21|title=Racial and Ethnic Differences in Homicides of Adult Women and the Role of Intimate Partner Violence — United States, 2003–2014|url=https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/66/wr/mm6628a1.htm?s_cid=mm6628a1_w|journal=MMWR.

Intimate partner violence accounts for 47% of those murdered. Current intimate partners commit 81% of the murders and 12% are committed by a past intimate partner. Jealousy, arguments and preceding violent acts occur before the murder 66% of the time. Human trafficking of Native American Women and Alaska Native women is thought to also occur, but studies and statistics are lacking.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.indianz.com/News/2017/07/24/report-confirms-native-women-suffer-from.asp|title=Report confirms Native women suffer from high rate of homicide in United States|last=|first=|date=July 24, 2017|website=|publisher=Indianz.com, by Ho-Chunk Inc. and the Winnebago Tribe|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When compared to other ethnicities, Native American women experience sexual assault and rape rates that are 2.5 higher. Though the Violence Against Women Act was reauthorized in 2013, most tribes struggle to fund jails, courts, jails, law enforcement, judges, and prevention programs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Statistics are lacking for violence against Native American women who reside on reservations. Data is unknown because no agency collects such  information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.futureswithoutviolence.org/userfiles/file/Violence%20Against%20AI%20AN%20Women%20Fact%20Sheet.pdf|title=The Facts on Violence Against American Indian/Alaskan Native Women|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Futures Without Violence|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=16 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immigrants ===
Immigrants to the US have great difficulties when they try to leave violent relationships. If a perpetrator controls the immigration status, they can then use the threat of deportation to prevent the battered woman from contacting authorities and assistance agencies. Some legislation passed by the US Congress allowed immigrant victims to leave situations of domestic violence. Other proposed policies not yet in effect are designed to stop deportation of immigrants who have experienced domestic violence, sexual assault, and human trafficking.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

{{Main|Violence Against Women Act}}
[[File:Vice President Biden Speaks on Reauthorizing the Violence Against Women Act.webm|thumb|Then-[[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Joe Biden]], who originally drafted VAWA, speaking about the Act]]
On September 13, 1994, President [[Bill Clinton]] signed into law the Violence Against Women Act (VAWA), which was drafted by [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[Joe Biden]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[Delaware|DE]]) and co-written by Democrat [[Louise Slaughter]]. The Act granted $1.6 billion of funding for investigating and prosecuting violent crimes directed towards women, making compensation from those convicted automatic and mandatory. VAWA was accepted by [[U.S. Congress|Congress]] with bipartisan support, though House [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] attempted to cut down on funding in 1995.&lt;ref name="wp-funding"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs|title=House GOP Budget Cutters Try to Limit Domestic Violence Programs|last=Cooper|first=Kenneth|date=July 15, 1995|work=[[Washington Post]]|accessdate=April 19, 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120724235532/http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/18605326.html?dids=18605326:18605326&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jul+15%2C+1995&amp;author=Kenneth+J.+Cooper&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+%28pre-1997+Fulltext%29&amp;desc=House+GOP+Budget+Cutters+Try+to+Limit+Domestic+Violence+Programs|archivedate=July 24, 2012|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; VAWA created the [[Office on Violence Against Women]], part of the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]].

In 2005, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] expressed that "VAWA is one of the most effective pieces of legislation enacted to end domestic violence, dating violence, sexual assault, and stalking. It has dramatically improved the law enforcement response to violence against women and has provided critical services necessary to support women in their struggle to overcome abusive situations".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|title=ACLU Letter to the Senate Judiciary Committee Regarding the Violence Against Women Act of 2005, S. 1197|date=July 27, 2005|publisher=ACLU|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222130005/https://www.aclu.org/letter/aclu-letter-senate-judiciary-committee-regarding-violence-against-women-act-2005-s-1197|archivedate=December 22, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the [[United Nations]] [[Special Rapporteur on Violence Against Women|Special Rapporteur on Violence against Women]], [[Rashida Manjoo]], reported progress in regards to violence towards women in the United States, though she also made recommendations regarding African and Native Americans, immigrants, military personnel and those who are imprisoned.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
