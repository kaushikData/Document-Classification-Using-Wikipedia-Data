'''Arkeon''' is an Italian personal growth movement founded by Vito Carlo Moccia. It gained some international popularity for alleged links with the [[Preacher to the Papal Household]], [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Franciscan Capuchin]] [[Raniero Cantalamessa]]. Informal membership is estimated at a few hundreds, mostly Italian.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

In an interview Moccia described the method as a path to "individual development and self-knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;Caldara, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Arkeon's key values are the "feeling of belonging", the spirit of fatherhood, the [[rites of passage]], the devotion to [[ancestors]], the strength which comes from courage and from being authentic. According to Moccia, these values are those of the "civilization of farmers", which he believes are being lost in modern society.

==History==
Arkeon was founded in 1999 by Vito Carlo Moccia and others, based on their experience in teaching [[reiki]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=362N1s-bjiAC&amp;pg=PT413&amp;dq=arkeon+-game#v=onepage&amp;q=arkeon%20-game&amp;f=false|title=Occulto Italia|last=Pitrelli|first=Stefano|last2=Vecchio|first2=Gianni Del|date=2011-03-10|publisher=Bur|isbn=9788858615720|language=it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moccia, described as the first Italian Reiki Master,&lt;ref&gt;Holm, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; initiated by Phyllis Furumoto, seems to have expanded the original teaching in different directions. Apparently, his method had become too different from Furumoto's and a different designation was needed.

In 2004, after the appearance of an article on a Roman Catholic catechism magazine,&lt;ref&gt;De Simone, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Cantalamessa interviewed Vito Carlo Moccia for the TV show run by the [[Capuchin friar]] on the national Italian television ([[RAI]]). The topic was the father-son relationship.

In October 2007, after a series of extremely critical TV shows, with accounts of purported victims, and calls for police action by an Italian [[anti-cult movement]] organization, the Public Prosecutor's Office of [[Bari]], Italy, started an investigation on Moccia and five other members of the movement. Arkeon seminars were suspended. At the beginning of April 2008, the investigation was still pending. Several forms of abuse are being alleged. Arkeon members deny any criminal wrongdoing.

After his contacts with Arkeon were exposed, Cantalamessa, in an interview, said that "he had not participated to any meeting", but also called the media campaign on Arkeon a "[[witch-hunt]]".

In 2008, the Italian [[psychologist]] and [[theologian]] [[Raffaella Di Marzio]], a leading Italian cult expert, began a research study on the movement. After collecting some interviews and participating in a meeting with members, she was accused by Italian police of joining a criminal [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]] and attempting to continue Moccia's abuses as the new leader of Arkeon. Colleagues and observers reacted with disbelief.&lt;ref&gt;Introvigne, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Martinez, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4687">'''Beau Marie St. Clair''' (c. 1952 – January 9, 2016) was an American [[film producer]]. In 1996, St. Clair, together with her friend and producing partner, actor [[Pierce Brosnan]], established [[Irish DreamTime]], a [[production company]] whose credits include ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'' (1999), ''[[Evelyn (film)|Evelyn]]'' (2002), ''[[Laws of Attraction]]'' (2004), ''[[The Matador]]'' (2005), ''[[The November Man]]'' (2014), and ''[[I.T. (film)|I.T.]]'' (2016).&lt;ref name=thr&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Barnes|title=Beau St. Clair, Pierce Brosnan's Producing Partner, Dies at 63 |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/beau-st-clair-dead-pierce-854349 |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=2016-01-11|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite news|first=Dave|last=McNary|title=Beau St. Clair, Pierce Brosnan's Producing Partner, Dies|url=https://variety.com/2016/film/news/beau-st-clair-dead-pierce-brosnan-producing-partner-1201676897|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=2016-01-11|accessdate=2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

St. Clair, a [[California]] native,&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; also worked as a production supervisor for several Broadway shows, including ''[[The Threepenny Opera]]'' in 1989 and ''[[Shōgun: The Musical]]'' in 1990 and During the 1980s and 1990s, she worked as an assistant to film producer [[Jerome Hellman]], including work on ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'' in 1986.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; Her other assistant producing credits included ''[[Hideaway (film)|Hideaway]]'' in 1995, ''[[Race the Sun]]'' in 1996, and ''[[The Edge (1997 film)|The Edge]]'' in 1997.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

St. Clair and Brosnan were longtime friends by the mid-1990s. Brosnan had starred as [[James Bond]] in 1995's ''[[GoldenEye]]'', the seventeenth film in the [[James Bond in film|Bond series]].&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; ''Goldeneye'', a commercial success, was a boost to Brosnan's career. He and St. Clair decided to begin producing films. In a 2014 interview, Brosnan recalled, "When GoldenEye … had the success that it had, we said, 'Let’s make movies. Let's step forth and create our own projects.' It’s as simple as that, really."&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Together, Beau St. Clair and Pierce established the Irish DreamTime production company in 1996, with additional backing from [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] (MGM).&lt;ref name=thr/&gt;

Under St. Clair and Brosnan, Irish DreamTime produced and released ten films between 1998 and 2016.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; Their first production was ''[[The Nephew]]'', a drama released in 1998.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; They then credited the 1999 remake, ''[[The Thomas Crown Affair (1999 film)|The Thomas Crown Affair]]'', which starred Brosnan and [[Rene Russo]]. Other Irish DreamTime films have included ''[[Evelyn (film)|Evelyn]]'' in 2002, ''[[Laws of Attraction]]'' in 2004, ''[[The Matador]]'' in 2005, and ''[[The November Man]]'' in 2014.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt; St. Clair also produced Irish DreamTime's ''[[I.T. (film)|I.T.]]'', a 'tech' thriller released in 2016. She also produced the 2002 remake, ''[[Rollerball (2002 film)|Rollerball]]''.&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

Beau St. Clair died following a lengthy illness with ovarian cancer at her home in [[Malibu, California]], on January 9, 2016, at the age of 63. She was survived by her mother and two brothers.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; Her husband, the late [[Academy Award]]-winning film producer [[Lloyd Phillips]], died from a heart attack in January 2013.&lt;ref name=thr/&gt; 

Brosnan, whose first wife, [[Cassandra Harris]] and her daughter, Charlotte, also both died of ovarian cancer, released a statement following her death, "My dearest friend Beau Marie St Claire passed away on Saturday, Jan 9th from Ovarian Cancer. She fought this insidious disease valiantly for ten long years. Beau was the sister I never had, my dearest friend for 30 years, and my producing partner at Irish Dreamtime, a company we formed twenty years ago. In that time we produced 10 films including ''The Thomas Crown Affair'', ''The Matador'', ''Evelyn'', ''The November Man'', and this past summer a thriller called ''IT''. Beau Marie was a beautiful woman in every way. She had style, grace, humor, intellect, and a kind heart that I will forever miss."&lt;ref name=variety/&gt;

"'''Brahmgiani'''" or "'''The Brahm Giani'''" is term derived from [[Sikhism]], used to define a highly enlightened individual– being one with [[Waheguru]]. In the [[Sikhism]] religion, such a person has also been named a [[Gurmukh]], [[Sadhu]] or [[Sant (religion)|Sant]]. Other derivations of Brahmgiani have come from one possessing the knowledge of [[Brahman]]. &lt;ref&gt;Winternitz, M., History of Indian Literature. Tr. S. Ketkar. Calcutta, 1927&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and usage ==
The idea of Brahmgiani in the [[Sikhism]] religion depicts the universal soul in [[theistic]] terms as the supreme of the universe which is, as it were, the visible form. The term is explained in sublime poetry from [[Guru Arjan]], and [[Guru Nanak]], in his [[Sukhmani]]. &lt;ref&gt;Sher Singh, The Philosophy of Sikhism.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lahore, 1944 Nripinder Singh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Sikh Moral Tradition. Delhi, 1990 Jodh Singh&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bhai, Gurmati Nirnaya. Lahore, 1932&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8248">[[Capital punishment]] is a legal penalty in South Korea. As of 2017, there are at least 300 people in South Korea under a death sentence.&lt;ref name="Amnesty Execution"&gt;{{Citation |series=Amnesty International Report |title=Amnesty International Report 2013|year=2013 |pages= 162–164|publisher=Amnesty International |url=http://files.amnesty.org/air13/AmnestyInternational_AnnualReport2013_complete_en.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Executions are carried out by [[hanging]]. 

On August 27, 2015, the Supreme Court sentenced a man called "Jiang Jaechin" to death for multiple murder, rape, and child rape. This is the last civilian on death row.

On February 19, 2016, the Supreme Court upheld the death sentence passed on a man known by the surname 'Lim', a 24-year-old Army sergeant who killed five fellow soldiers and injured seven others in a shooting rampage near the border with North Korea in 2014. He became the 361st person on death row in South Korea. According to [[Yonhap]], of the 361 people on death row, 45, including Lim, were soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2016/02/19/0200000000AEN20160219006500315.html?input=www.tweeter.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bigstory.ap.org/article/373e0fa302cc4154b6b8a75d4fdb3e2b/s-korea-top-court-oks-soldiers-death-penalty-over-rampage&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Executions in Korea have existed since the [[Joseon|Joseon Period]]{{Citation needed|reason=Pretty sure it predates Joseon by a huge margin|date=July 2018}}. The purpose of executions was to cause reactions and stop crimes. Methods of executions included [[slow slicing]], [[hanging]], and [[dismemberment]]. Heads of executed people have always been used as warnings to others. Specifically, dismembered heads were displayed to the public both to serve as public warning and enforce [[military courtesy]]. However, bodies of executed people were allowed [[funeral]] proceedings.&lt;ref name="EncyKorea Execution"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://encykorea.aks.ac.kr/Contents/Index?contents_id=E0026110 |title=사형 |publisher=[[Academy of Korean Studies]] |accessdate= October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary history, the first execution law was established on March 25, 1895, by the [[Supreme Court of Judicature of Japan]] acting under the [[Constitution of the Empire of Japan]]. The first death sentence was given four days later, on March 29, 1895 to [[Jeon Bongjun]]. Since 1948, a total of 902 people have been executed.&lt;ref name="Doopedia Execution"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.doopedia.co.kr/doopedia/master/master.do?_method=view&amp;MAS_IDX=101013000700279| title=사형[Todesstrafe,死刑]| publisher= Doosan Corporation| accessdate=October 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the [[Penal Code (South Korea)|Penal Code of South Korea]] regulates executions as a form of punishment for some crimes according to the Criminal Law section 41. Those crimes include: [[Rebellion]] (Section 87), Conspiracy with foreign countries (Section 92), [[homicide]] (Section 250), robbery-homicide (Section 338), and other 12 sections. People under 18 cannot be executed according to Juvenile Law (Section 59, Juvenile Law).&lt;ref name="Doopedia Execution" /&gt;

== Developments ==
In February 1998, then-president [[Kim Dae-jung]] enacted a moratorium on executions. This moratorium is still in effect as of 2013.&lt;ref name="CSM Execution"&gt;{{cite news |last=Bright|first=Arthur| url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Asia-South-Central/2012/0829/India-uses-death-penalty-5-other-places-where-it-s-legal-but-rare/South-Korea|title=India uses death penalty: 5 other places where it’s legal but rare| publisher=The Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=October 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, executions in Korea are considered to be abolished de facto.&lt;ref name="Amnesty News Execution"&gt;{{cite news| url= https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/south-korea-death-penalty-abolition-set-back-constitutional-court-ruling-2010-02-25|title= South Korea death penalty abolition set back by Constitutional Court ruling |publisher= Amnesty International |date= February 25, 2010|accessdate=October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The last executions took place in December 1997, when 23 people (who has murdered at least 2 people) were put to death.&lt;ref name="Amnesty News Execution 2"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/news/south-korea-must-not-resume-death-penalty-20090210 | title=South Korea must not resume use of the death penalty | publisher=Amnesty International | date=February 16, 2013| accessdate=October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are still at least 60 people with a death sentence, as of 2013.&lt;ref name="Amnesty Execution" /&gt;

In 2010 the [[Constitutional Court of Korea]] ruled that capital punishment did not violate “human dignity and worth” in the [[Constitution of the Republic of Korea]]. In a five-to-four decision, capital punishment was upheld as constitutional. Institutions such as [[Amnesty International]] considered this a ‘major setback for South Korea'.&lt;ref name="Amnesty News Execution" /&gt; Later in 2010, Justice Minister Lee Kwi-nam alluded to a possibility of resuming executions.&lt;ref name="Korea Times Execution"&gt;{{cite news |last=Park |first=Si-soo | url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/03/113_62499.html  | title=Minister Hints at Resuming Death Row Executions | publisher= The Korea Times | date=March 16, 2010 | accessdate=October 23, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, three bills which proposed abolishment of the death penalty lapsed at the end of the National Assembly’s term.&lt;ref name="Amnesty Execution" /&gt;

Executions are still a matter of debate.&lt;ref name="Amnesty News Execution 2" /&gt; People have called for executions for violent crimes, especially those involving [[rape]] of minors.&lt;ref name="Korea Realtime Execution"&gt;{{cite web |last= Woo| first= Jaeyeon |url= https://blogs.wsj.com/korearealtime/2012/09/06/hideous-crimes-spark-debate-on-death-penalty/|title=Hideous Crimes Spark Debate on Death Penalty |publisher= Dow Jones &amp; Company, Inc. |date=September 6, 2012 |accessdate= October 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 poll found younger [[South Korea]]ns are more likely to support capital punishment than older ones. People in their 20s were the most supportive at 62.6 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://english.yonhapnews.co.kr/news/2017/11/06/0200000000AEN20171106005500315.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.malaysiandigest.com/world/706299-over-half-of-s-korean-people-support-carrying-out-death-penalty-poll.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable cases ==
Kang Ho-sun was convicted of kidnapping and killing eight women between 2006 and 2008, and of burning to death his wife and mother-in-law in 2005. Kang, 38, was arrested in January for the murder of a female college student and later confessed to killing and secretly burying seven other women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/8011560.stm|date=2009-04-21|publisher=BBC News|title=Korean killer gets death penalty}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other death row inmates include [[Yoo Young-chul]] and members of the [[Chijon family]], a former gang of cannibals.

In March 2010, in contrast to prior speculations, Minister Lee Kwi-nam hinted that the executions of death row inmates will resume, breaking the virtual 13-year moratorium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.koreatimes.co.kr/www/news/nation/2010/03/113_62499.html|title=Minister Hints at Resuming Death Row Execution|date=March 16, 2010|accessdate=March 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks came a few days after Kim Kil-tae, who raped and murdered a 15-year-old schoolgirl, was convicted. However, this did not happen.

In December 2010, Kimk's death sentence was reduced to life imprisonment and the prosecutors did not appeal to the Supreme Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Bae |first=Hyun-jung |date=2010-12-15 |title=Rapist-murderer’s sentence reduced to life imprisonment |url=http://www.koreaherald.com/national/Detail.jsp?newsMLId=20101215000880 |newspaper=The Korean Herald English Edition |location= |accessdate=2014-10-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Charles Martin''' (August 31, 1959 – January 26, 2005) was a [[Professional sports|professional]] [[American football]] player, who is best known for his career with the [[Green Bay Packers]], and in particular for causing a season-ending injury to [[Chicago Bears]] [[Starting lineup|starting]] [[quarterback]] [[Jim McMahon]] on November 23, 1986. Martin also played for the [[Birmingham Stallions]] of the [[USFL]], the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League|CFL]], and the [[Houston Oilers]] and [[Atlanta Falcons]] in the [[NFL]].

== Early career ==
Martin attended [[Cherokee High School (Georgia)|Cherokee High School]] in [[Canton, Georgia]] and was nicknamed "Too Mean" for his tendency to pile on ball carriers after the whistle.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2005-02-01/sports/0502010334_1_charles-martin-bears-division-ii-all-american|title=To Bears fans, Charles Martin will always be recalled for the body slam that ended Jim McMahon's season in 1986. But there was more to the man they buried Monday.|work=tribunedigital-chicagotribune|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He originally dropped out of school at age 14 but then rejoined to play football.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnqFt_fSnAoC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;lpg=PA170&amp;dq=charles+martin+usfl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZFOIsa1Y_F&amp;sig=dDO8yb9VMigAJgaH0J2IKFl1x58&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih2fKUqZnYAhUnzoMKHTx0A2wQ6AEIbzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20martin%20usfl&amp;f=false|title=After They Were Packers: The Super Bowl XXXI Champs &amp; Other Green Bay Legends|last=Poling|first=Jerry|date=2006|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|isbn=9781931599726|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He originally signed to play college football at [[Western Carolina Catamounts football|Western Carolina]], but followed assistant coach [[Joe D'Alessandris]] to [[Livingston University]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He then went on to play at [[University of West Alabama|The University of West Alabama]] (then known as Livingston), and was a [[NCAA Division II|Division II]] All-American.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Martin was All-[[Gulf South Conference]] two years at Livingston, and was the Defensive Player of the Year in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uwaathletics.com/hof.aspx?hof=76|title=University of West Alabama|website=www.uwaathletics.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Professional career ==

=== Birmingham Stallions ===
Martin began his pro football career with the [[Birmingham Stallions]] of the [[USFL]] in 1983, but was cut after his first season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Edmonton Eskimos ===
Martin was signed by the [[Edmonton Eskimos]] of the [[Canadian Football League]] in early 1984 but was cut before he could make it through a season.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Green Bay Packers ===
Martin immediately jumped into a starting role once he was signed by the [[Green Bay Packers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://chicago.suntimes.com/1985-chicago-bears/1985-bears-coverage-usfl-demise-hurts-bears/|title=1985 Bears Coverage: USFL demise hurts Bears|work=Chicago Sun-Times|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He signed with the Packers after he was not selected in the Supplemental Draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m9o2_k8zu4QC&amp;pg=PA91&amp;lpg=PA91&amp;dq=charles+martin+usfl&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=JQPQFA7bgQ&amp;sig=1QjiBG2L7KcV9-r9XbTy84VJ1w4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwih2fKUqZnYAhUnzoMKHTx0A2wQ6AEIbDAN#v=onepage&amp;q=charles%20martin%20usfl&amp;f=false|title=Packers by the Numbers: Jersey Numbers and the Players who Wore Them|last=Maxymuk|first=John|date=2003|publisher=Big Earth Publishing|isbn=9781879483903|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== 1986 McMahon incident ====
During pre-game warm-ups, Martin displayed a white hand-towel with a list of five Bears offensive players' numbers: 9 for [[Jim McMahon]], 34 for [[Walter Payton]], 83 for [[Willie Gault]], 63 for [[Jay Hilgenberg]] and 29 for [[Dennis Gentry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.foxsports.com/nfl/story/thirty-years-ago-bears-packers-featured-the-dirtiest-hit-in-nfl-history-102016|title=Thirty years ago, Bears-Packers featured the dirtiest hit in NFL history|date=2016-10-20|work=FOX Sports|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin wore the towel during the game. He allegedly claimed that it was a hit-list.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://scout.com/nfl/packers/Article/Charles-Martin-dead-at-46-104169708|title=Charles Martin dead at 46|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Bears quarterback Jim McMahon threw an [[interception]], Martin grabbed him from behind and body-slammed him shoulder first to the ground. Replays showed that Martin hit McMahon at least two seconds after the pass was thrown, well after McMahon was out of the play. McMahon landed full force on his previously injured shoulder,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; a situation exacerbated by [[Soldier Field]]'s artificial turf surface of the time—and was knocked out for the rest of the season.  Martin was ejected from the game by referee [[Jerry Markbreit]] and suspended for two games.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/26/sports/martin-of-packers-suspended.html | work=The New York Times | first=Michael | last=Janofsky | title=Martin Of Packers Suspended | date=November 26, 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Markbreit later said that Martin complained about the ejection until the threat of letting Bears players come after him was spoken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.espn.com/blog/chicago/bears/post/_/id/4675356/the-infamous-hit-from-the-refs-perspective|title=The infamous hit from the ref's perspective|work=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the game, the Packers defensive coordinator defended Martin, saying "We tell people that if we intercept a pass, go get anybody near you."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=100 Things Packers Fans Should Know and Do Before They Die|last=Reischel|first=Rob|publisher=Triumph Books|year=2010|isbn=978-1-60078-398-2|location=Chicago|pages=242}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the first multi-game suspension for an on-field incident in modern NFL history, and would remain the longest suspension for an on-field incident until [[Albert Haynesworth]] of the [[Tennessee Titans]] was suspended five games for stomping on the head of [[Dallas Cowboys]] [[Center (American football)|center]] [[Andre Gurode]] in [[2006 NFL season|2006]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/news/story?id=2610577|title=Haynesworth penalty comes in: Five games|date=2006-10-02|website=ESPN.com|access-date=2017-12-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martin played for the Packers from [[1984 NFL season|1984]]–[[1987 NFL season|1987]]. He was cut early in the 1987 season after being implicated in a Green Bay bar fight.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Houston Oilers ===
Martin played for the [[Houston Oilers|Oilers]] in the latter part of the 1987 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ign.com/boards/threads/former-packer-defensive-end-charles-martin-passes-away.77646003/|title=Former Packer Defensive End Charles Martin passes away.|work=IGN Boards|access-date=2017-12-20|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a game against the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]], Martin speared Steelers [[running back]] [[Earnest Jackson]], sparking a rivalry between Oilers coach [[Jerry Glanville]] and Steelers coach [[Chuck Noll]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1989-09-16/sports/sp-48_1_oiler-linebacker|title=Oilers Try to Make It a Mobile House of Pain|last=WOLF|first=BOB|date=1989-09-16|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-12-21|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Atlanta Falcons ===
He closed out his career with the [[Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]] in [[1988 NFL season|1988]], the only season in which he did not start a game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pro-football-reference.com/players/M/MartCh20.htm|title=Charles Martin  Stats {{!}} Pro-Football-Reference.com|website=Pro-Football-Reference.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
Martin was suspended two games in 1986 due to an incident at a bar. He later went into alcohol abuse treatment, and divorced both of his wives. He was arrested for disorderly conduct in 1987 for throwing an egg at the car of an NFL replacement player.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Martin died in 2005 at age 45 in [[Houston]] due to complications from [[kidney failure]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7506">'''Cognitive acceleration''' or '''CA''' is an approach to teaching designed to develop students' thinking ability, developed by Michael Shayer and Philip Adey from 1981 at [[King's College London]] .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kcl.ac.uk/sspp/departments/education/research/crestem/Research/Current-Projects/CogAcc/Cognaccel.aspx |title=King's College London - Cognitive Acceleration (CASE and other projects) |year=2012 |accessdate=16 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach builds on work by [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lev Vygotsky]] and takes a [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivist]] approach.

==Theoretical background==
From Piaget, CA recognises there are stages in intellectual development.  At school the most important transition is from concrete thinking - which deals with facts and descriptions, to abstract thinking - any thinking which involves a mental process. From Vygotsky, CA takes the concept of [[Zone of Proximal Development]] (ZPD): the difference between what a learner can do with and without help. The CA method requires a mediator to ask questions that allow "guided self-discovery". Mediation is effective between peers and promotes the idea of pupils working in groups to solve a problem.

==Materials==
The first teaching materials, written for Years 7 and 8 (ages 11–13) science lessons, were called Cognitive Acceleration through Science Education (CASE). After three years the results of intervening in science teaching in a dozen classes were compared with control classes which were taught in the usual way. The CASE learners not only scored about one grade better in their [[GCSE]] science, but Maths and English GCSE grades were improved by about the same amount.&lt;ref&gt;Adey, P. S..(1993). ''Accelerating the development of formal thinking in Middle and High school students IV:  three years on after a two-year intervention'' . Journal of Research in Science Teaching, 30, 4, 351-366.&lt;/ref&gt; It is rare to see such ‘transfer’ of learning to other subjects in educational research.

Using the CA approach in teaching primary and secondary maths, known as CAME, produced similar results.&lt;ref&gt;Adhami, M., Robertson, A.,  &amp; Shayer, M.(2004).  ''Let's Think Through Maths!: Developing thinking in mathematics with five and six-year-olds.''  London: nferNelson&lt;/ref&gt;   Later development extended the range of lesson activities in primary science from the Foundation Stage through to year 5. Currently under development are activities for English at Key Stage 3. Several articles highlighting the effectiveness of CASE and CAME have appeared in the [[Times Educational Supplement]] (TES).&lt;ref&gt;Times Educational Supplement Magazine storyline 379714&lt;/ref&gt; Let's Think Forum (LT) produces CA packages for core subjects in primary and secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.letsthink.org.uk/ca_approach/theory_and_pedagogy.html |title= Theory and pedagogy |year= 2012 |accessdate= 16 March 2012 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140108111002/http://www.letsthink.org.uk/ca_approach/theory_and_pedagogy.html |archivedate= 8 January 2014 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lesson structure==
CA acknowledges a set of subskills which underpin abstract thinking and shares with [[Constructivism (learning theory)|constructivism]] the view that concepts cannot be learned in the same way as facts and descriptions. Learners need to "construct"  meaning for themselves. Lessons centre on a challenge which can only be mastered by using an abstract idea. Early CASE lessons focus on: classification, scale, ratio, proportion, probability, variables, fair testing.

;Role of the mediator
The teacher sets up good learning-context and intervenes to guide the learners toward the learning goal. A mediator asks probing questions:  "What do you think?", "Which one will heat up most?"  "What's happening to the atoms?"  gradually leading the learners to discover the answer for themselves. The mediator can offer clues which direct the learner, improving the chance of successful thinking.

Lessons which develop abstract thinking directly have the following structure.

'''Setting the scene''' Concrete preparation serves a similar purpose to the "bridging" section and links the activity to current knowledge, explains the task and checks vocabulary.

'''Challenge''' Challenge must be set just above the current level of secure knowledge - hard enough to be a challenge, but not so hard as to make the learners switch off.  In a science lesson this can take the form of a demonstration with an unexpected effect.  In English it could be reading a text which has an implied meaning.

'''Group work''' The teacher cannot be the mediator for every child in the class. If pupils work in groups and discuss their ideas (social construction) there are several benefits:
* group members act as mediators for each other, suggesting solutions, trying out ideas.
* individuals feel less vulnerable and more able to participate.
* random ideas from group-members act as the clues offered by the mediator.

'''Plenary''' Once the groups have solutions, the class shares ideas.  The teacher does not give the answer but asks a group for a solution, then asks another if they agree or disagree and why.  The discussion continues until there is agreement.  The teacher leads the group towards the answer through questioning.

'''Meta cognition''' During group-work and the plenary, the teacher asks questions that reveal the thinking process, meta-cognition, which has been shown to be effective in securing knowledge.  The learner has to enunciate a line of thinking - making the process available to others.

'''Bridging''' Knowledge in isolation from the learner's secure knowledge is usually lost. The learner needs to bridge new learning to existing experiences.  CA lessons conclude with a discussion about where ideas could be used in everyday life, the same concept as "scaffolding" in constructivism.

'''Dawit I'''&lt;ref&gt;In Ethiopian sources he is referred to as Dawit II (and all subsequent Dawits are numerated accordingly), as Dawit I is used to refer only to [[David|King David of Judah]].&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Ge'ez alphabet|Ge'ez]]: {{lang-gez|ዳዊት}} {{transl|gez|dāwīt}}, "David") was [[Emperor of Ethiopia|Emperor]] ({{transl|gez|nəgusä nägäst}}) (1382 – 6 October 1413) of [[Ethiopia]], and a member of the [[Solomonic dynasty]]. He was the younger son of [[Newaya Krestos]].

==Life==
Taddesse Tamrat discusses a tradition that early in his reign, Dawit campaigned against [[Egypt]], reaching as far north as [[Aswan]]. In response, the Emir forced the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Pope Matthew I of Alexandria|Matthew I]], to send a deputation to Dawit to persuade him to retire back to his kingdom. Taddesse concludes, "There seems to be little or no doubt that, on the eve of the advent of the [[Burji dynasty]] of [[Mamluk|Mamluk Egypt]], King Dawit had in fact led his troops beyond the northern frontiers of his kingdom, and created much havoc among the Muslim inhabitants of the area who had been within the sphere of influence of Egypt since the thirteenth century."&lt;ref&gt;Taddesse Tamrat, ''Church and State in Ethiopia'' (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1972), p. 255&lt;/ref&gt; The Emperor apparently had a much friendlier relationship with the Sultan's successor, for according to the medieval historian [[al-Maqrizi]], Dawit sent 22 camels laden with gifts to [[Berkuk]], the first Sultan of the Burji dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;E. A. Wallis Budge, ''A History of Ethiopia: Nubia and Abyssinia'', 1928 (Oosterhout, the Netherlands: Anthropological Publications, 1970), p. 301.&lt;/ref&gt;

He confronted the problem of raids from the [[Islam in Ethiopia|Muslim]] kingdoms on his eastern border with numerous counterattacks on those kingdoms. According to al-Maqrizi, in 1403 Emperor Dawit pursued the Sultan of [[Adal Sultanate|Adal]], [[Sa'ad ad-Din II]], to [[Zeila]], where he killed Sa'ad ad-Din and sacked the city. However, another contemporary source dates the death of Sa'ad ad-Din to 1415, and gives the credit to Emperor [[Yeshaq I of Ethiopia|Yeshaq]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Spencer Trimingham, ''Islam in Ethiopia'' (London: Geoffrey Cumberlege for the University Press, 1952), p. 74 and note explains the discrepancy in the sources; some historians pick one of the two possible dates (e.g. Paul Henze selects 1403 in ''Layers of Time, A History of Ethiopia'' [New York: Palgrave, 2000], p. 67) without even mentioning the problem.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Dawit sent an embassy to Europe, which had reached Venice by 23 June 1402, requesting that a number of artisans are sent to his domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salvadore|first=Matteo|title=The African Prester John and the Birth of Ethiopian-European Relations  (Introduction)|url=https://www.academia.edu/25983362/The_African_Prester_John_and_the_Birth_of_Ethiopian-European_Relations_Introduction_|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carlo Conti Rossini]] assembled the surviving documents concerning this visit in 1927, which record that five artisans departed with the Ethiopian envoy that August, but not if they arrived in Ethiopia. However, Marilyn E. Heldman found evidence of a "silver-gilt chalice" made in Venice, which, if it was the one [[Francisco Álvares]] described as seeing in Ethiopia, did reach Dawit.&lt;ref&gt;Heldman, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/618118 "A Chalice from Venice for Emperor Dāwit of Ethiopia", ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies''], '''53''' (1990), pp. 442-445&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible sign of their arrival is an itinerary of a journey from Venice by Rhodes, Cyprus, Jerusalem, Cairo and [[Axum]] to the court of Preste John in [[Shewa]]. which [[O. G. S. Crawford]] dates to Dawit's reign. Crawford considers this document the "first unambiguous account of Abyssinian geography which has survived; it certainly refers to the journey of a European, and the route followed can be identified pretty accurately."&lt;ref&gt;O. G. S. Crawford, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1789985 "Some Medieval Theories about the Nile", ''Geographical Journal''], '''114''' (1949), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

A noted horseman, Dawit was killed when he was kicked in the head by one of his [[horse]]s. His body was interred in the [[Daga Estifanos|monastery of St. Stephen]] on [[Daga Island]] in [[Lake Tana]].&lt;ref&gt;So R. E. Cheesman ([https://www.jstor.org/stable/1785868 "Lake Tana and its Islands", ''Geographical Journal''], 85 [1935], p. 496), who visited Daga and was shown his casket, and Wallis Budge (''History'', p. 301). [[James Bruce]] states Dawit was buried on [[Dek Island]] (''Travels to Discover the Source of the Nile'' [1805 edition], vol. 3, p. 96); Bruce must have confused the two islands, which is easy to do.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other events==
The Emperor Dawit was an enthusiastic [[Christian]]. He dealt with a revolt of the [[Beta Israel]] in [[Tigray Province|Tigray]], and encouraged missionary work in [[Gojjam]]. According to [[E. A. Wallis Budge]], during Dawit's reign, a piece of the [[True Cross]] arrived in Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Budge, ''History'', p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; He also made endowments to the [[Ethiopian Church]]: three charters survive of grants he made of lands in [[Wolqayt province|Wolqayt]], [[Serae]], [[Adiyabo]], [[Shire, Ethiopia|Shire]], [[Addi Arkay]], northern [[Semien province|Semien]], the [[Gar'alta]], [[Manbarta]], and [[Karnesem]] which lies north of present-day [[Asmara]].&lt;ref&gt;G.W.B. Huntingford, ''The Historical Geography of Ethiopia'' (London: The British Academy, 1989), p. 82&lt;/ref&gt;

During Dawit's time atop the throne, two surviving examples of illustrated manuscripts were produced. One is a translation of the ''Miracles of Mary'', which had been written in [[Arabic language|Arabic]], done at the command of Emperor Dawit. This is the oldest surviving illustrated book commissioned by an Ethiopian Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Mercier, "Ethiopian Art History" in ''Ethiopian Art: The Walters Museum'' (London: Third Millennium, 2001), p. 51.&lt;/ref&gt; The other, described as "one of the most beautiful illustrated books of the period", is a copy of the [[gospel]]s, which is now preserved at the monastery of Saint Gabriel on [[Kebran Island]] in southern Lake Tana.&lt;ref&gt;Mercier, "Art History", p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The body of '''Elisa Lam''', also known by her [[Cantonese]] name, '''Lam Ho Yi''' ({{zh|labels=no|t={{linktext|藍|可|兒}}}}; April 30, 1991&lt;ref name="LAPD flyer"/&gt; – February 2013), a Canadian student at the [[University of British Columbia]] in [[Vancouver]], was recovered from a [[water tank]] atop the [[Cecil Hotel (Los Angeles)|Cecil Hotel]] in [[Downtown Los Angeles]] on February 19, 2013.&lt;ref name="College Times story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Nickels|first=Jesse|title=Elisa Lam: The College Girl Whose Hotel Death is So Mysterious It Inspired a Horror Movie|url=http://www.collegetimes.tv/elisa-lam/|newspaper=College Times|date=May 28, 2014|accessdate=January 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had been reported missing at the beginning of the month. Maintenance workers at the hotel discovered the body when investigating guest complaints of problems with the water supply.

Her disappearance had been widely reported; interest had increased five days prior to her body's discovery when the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] released video of the last time she was known to have been seen, on the day of her disappearance, by an elevator [[Closed-circuit television|security camera]]. In the footage, Lam is seen exiting and re-entering the elevator, talking and gesturing in the hallway outside, and sometimes seeming to hide within the elevator, which itself appears to be malfunctioning. The video went [[viral video|viral]] on the Internet, with many viewers reporting that they found it unsettling. Explanations ranged from claims of [[paranormal]] involvement to [[bipolar disorder]] from which Lam suffered; it has also been argued that the video was altered prior to release.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article"&gt;{{cite news|last=van der Merwe|first=Marelise|title=The Elisa Lam mystery: Still no answers|url=http://www.dailymaverick.co.za/article/2014-12-12-the-elisa-lam-mystery-still-no-answers/|newspaper=[[Daily Maverick]]|date=December 12, 2014|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The circumstances of Lam's death, once she was found, also raised questions, especially in light of the Cecil's history in relation to other notable deaths and murders. Her body was naked&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 3"&gt;{{cite web|title=Autopsy Report 2013-01364|url=http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/3/|page=3|publisher=[[Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner]]|date=June 18, 2013|accessdate=January 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with most of her clothes and personal effects floating in the water near her.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 3" /&gt; It took the [[Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner|Los Angeles County Coroner]]'s office four months, after repeated delays, to release the [[autopsy]] report, which reports no evidence of physical trauma and states that the manner of death was accidental.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 15"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/15/ 15].&lt;/ref&gt; Guests at the Cecil, now re-branded as Stay on Main, sued the hotel over the incident, and Lam's parents filed a separate suit later that year; the latter was dismissed in 2015. Some of the early Internet interest noted what were considered to be unusual similarities between Lam's death and the 2005 [[horror film]] ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]''.&lt;ref name="College Times story" /&gt; The case has since been referenced in international [[popular culture]].

Built as a business hotel in the 1920s, the Cecil fell on hard times during the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s and never recaptured its original market as downtown [[urban decay|decayed]] around it in the late 20th century. Several of Los Angeles's more notable murders have happened at or have connections to the hotel: [[Black Dahlia|Elizabeth Short]], victim of the Black Dahlia murder, the city's best-known unsolved killing, supposedly made the Cecil her last stop before her death, and in 1964, Goldie Osgood, the "Pigeon Lady of [[Pershing Square (Los Angeles)|Pershing Square]]," was raped and murdered in her room at the Cecil, another crime that has never been solved.&lt;ref name="la2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/oct/26/travel/tr-lizzieside26|title=Tales of the macabre at L.A. hotels|author=Leslie Anne Wiggins|publisher=Los Angeles Times |date=26 October 2008|accessdate=26 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Serial murder|Serial killers]] [[Jack Unterweger]] and [[Richard Ramirez]], the "Night Stalker", both resided at the Cecil while active.&lt;ref name="cnnhotel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/21/us/california-horror-hotel/|title=Hotel with corpse in water tank has notorious past |author=Alan Duke|publisher=CNN|date=23 February 2013 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have also been suicides, one of which also killed a pedestrian in the front of the hotel.&lt;ref name="Erickson story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Erickson|first=Steve|authorlink=Steve Erickson|title=Gloom Service: A Night at the Cecil Hotel, Where Serial Killers and Eerie Deaths Abound|url=http://www.lamag.com/crimeinla/gloom-service-a-night-at-the-cecil-hotel-where-serial-killers-and-eerie-deaths-abound/|newspaper=[[Los Angeles (magazine)|Los Angeles]]|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; After recent renovations, it has tried to market itself as a [[boutique hotel]], but the reputation lingers.&lt;ref name="Time Cecil story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Waxman|first=Olivia B.|title=The Cecil Hotel: What a Dead Body in a Water Tank Does for Your Yelp Reviews|url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2013/02/21/the-cecil-hotel-what-a-dead-body-in-a-water-tank-does-for-your-yelp-reviews/|newspaper=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=February 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The Cecil will reveal to you whatever it is you're a fugitive from," says [[Steve Erickson]], a journalist who spent a night in the hotel after Lam's death.&lt;ref name="Erickson story" /&gt;

Lam had been diagnosed with [[bipolar disorder]] and [[depression (mood)|depression]]. She had been prescribed four medications—[[Wellbutrin]], [[Lamotrigine|Lamictal]], [[Quetiapine|Seroquel]]&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 20"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/20/ 20].&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Venlafaxine|Effexor]]&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 22"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/22/ 22]&lt;/ref&gt;—to treat her disorders. According to her family, who supposedly kept her history of mental illness a secret,&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article"/&gt; she had no history of [[suicidal ideation]]s or attempts,&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 20" /&gt; although one report claimed she had previously gone missing for a brief period.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt;

In a January 2012 blog post, Lam lamented that a "relapse" at the start of the current school term had forced her to drop several classes, leaving her feeling "so utterly directionless and lost." She titled her post, "You're always haunted by the idea you're wasting your life" after a quotation from novelist [[Chuck Palahniuk]]. She used that quote as an [[epigraph (literature)|epigraph]] for her blog. She worried that her [[Transcript (education)|transcript]] would look suspicious with so many withdrawals and that it would result in her being unable to continue her studies and attend graduate school.&lt;ref name="Palahniuk quote blog post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Elisa|title=You're always haunted by the idea you're wasting your life|url=http://etherfields.blogspot.com/2012/01/youre-always-haunted-by-idea-youre.html|publisher=[[Blogspot]]|date=January 27, 2012|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A little over two years after Lam had started blogging, she announced she would be abandoning her blog for another she had started on [[Tumblr]], Nouvelle/Nouveau.&lt;ref name="Last Blogspot post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Lam|first=Elisa|title=Tumblr|url=http://etherfields.blogspot.com/2012/07/tumblr.html|publisher=[[Blogspot]]|date=June 27, 2012|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its content mostly consisted of found fashion photos and quotes and a few posts in Lam's own words. The same Palahniuk quote was used as an epigraph.&lt;ref name="Last Blogspot post"/&gt;

==Disappearance==
Lam contacted her parents in British Columbia every day while traveling. On January 31, 2013, the day she was scheduled to check out of the Cecil and leave for Santa Cruz, they did not hear from her and called the [[Los Angeles Police Department|Los Angeles police]]; her family flew to Los Angeles to help with the search.&lt;ref name="CNN story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Duke|first=Alan|title=How did woman's body come to be in L.A. hotel water tank?|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/02/21/us/california-hotel-water-corpse/|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=February 23, 2013|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Police-Activity-Focuses-Hotel-Where-Missing-Woman-Elisa-Lame-191886411.html|title=Body Found in Water Tank at Hotel is Missing Canadian Tourist: LAPD|publisher=[[KNBC]]|date= Feb 19, 2013|accessdate=July 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hotel staff who saw her that day said she was alone. Outside the hotel, Katie Orphan, manager of a nearby bookstore, was the only person who recalled seeing Lam that day. "She was outgoing, very lively, very friendly," while getting gifts to take home to her family, Orphan told [[CNN]]. "[She was] talking about what book she was getting and whether or not what she was getting would be too heavy for her to carry around as she traveled," Orphan added.&lt;ref name="CNN Orphan story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lah|first=Kyung|authorlink=Kyung Lah|title=Elisa Lam, Cecil Hotel update video: Inside the Los Angeles hotel|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/1302/22/cnr.12.html|newspaper=[[CNN]]|date=February 22, 2013|accessdate=January 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police searched the hotel to the extent that they legally could. They searched Lam's room and had dogs go through the building, including the rooftop, but the canines were unsuccessful in detecting her scent. "But we didn't search every room," Sgt. Rudy Lopez said later, "we could only do that if we had [[probable cause]]" to believe a crime had been committed.&lt;ref name="LA Times body discovery story" /&gt;

On February 6, a week after Lam had last been seen, the LAPD decided more help was needed. Flyers with her image were posted in the neighborhood and online. It brought the case to the public's attention through the media.&lt;ref name="LAPD flyer" /&gt;

===Elevator video===
{{ external media

| video1 = [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3TjVBpyTeZM Footage of Lam from an elevator in the Cecil hotel]
}}
On February 14, after another week with no sign of her, the LAPD released a video of the last known sighting of her taken in one of the Cecil's elevators by a [[video surveillance]] camera on February 1.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LA Times body discovery story" /&gt; It drew worldwide interest in the case due to Lam's strange behavior and has been extensively analyzed and discussed.&lt;ref name="Elevator video"&gt;{{cite AV media|people=Los Angeles Police Headquarters |date=February 14, 2013 |title=Detectives Looking for Missing Canadian Woman |medium=Online video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4LmWiDiC0 |access-date=January 30, 2015 |publisher=[[YouTube]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029231120/http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zq4LmWiDiC0 |archivedate=October 29, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the clip, the camera at one of the elevator cab's rear corners looks down from the ceiling, offering a view not just of its interior but the hallway outside. It is somewhat grainy, and the [[timestamp]] at the bottom is obscured. At some points Lam's mouth is [[Pixelization|pixelized]].&lt;ref name="Elevator video" /&gt;

At the start, Lam enters, clad in a red zippered [[hooded sweatshirt]] over a gray T-shirt, with black shorts and sandals. She enters from the left and goes to the control panel, appears to select several floors and then steps back to the corner. After a few seconds during which the door fails to close, she steps up to it, leans forward so her head is through the door, looks in both directions, and then quickly steps back in, backing up to the wall and then into the corner near the control panel. The door remains open.&lt;ref name="Elevator video beginning"&gt;"Detectives", 0:00–0:36&lt;/ref&gt;

She walks to it again and stands in the doorway, leaning on the side. Suddenly she steps out into the hall, then to her side, back in, looking to the side, then back out. She then steps sideways again, and for a few seconds she is mostly invisible behind the wall she has her back to just outside. The door remains open.&lt;ref name="Elevator video outside"&gt;"Detectives", 0:37–1:05&lt;/ref&gt;

Her right arm can be seen going up to her head, and then she turns to re-enter the cab, putting both hands on the side of the door. She then goes to the control panel, presses many more buttons, some more than once, and then returns to the wall she had come into the elevator from, putting both hands over her ears again briefly as she walks back to the section of wall she had been standing against before. The door remains open.&lt;ref name="Elevator video back in"&gt;"Detectives", 1:06–1:54&lt;/ref&gt;

She turns to her right and begins rubbing her forearms together, then waves her hands out to her sides with palms flat and fingers outstretched, while bowing forward slightly and rocking gently. This can all be seen through the door, which remains open. After she backs to the wall again and walks away to the left, it finally closes.&lt;ref name="Elevator video back in 2"&gt;"Detectives", 1:55–2:37&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reposted widely, including to the Chinese video-sharing site [[Youku]], where it got 3 million views and 40,000 comments in its first 10 days. Many of the commenters found it unsettling to watch.&lt;ref name="LA Times Youku blog post"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elisa Lam's unexplained death draws attention, theories in China|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/lanow/2013/02/elisa-lams-death-continues-to-draw-attention-in-china-canada.html|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=February 26, 2013|accessdate=January 30, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several theories evolved to explain her actions. One was that Lam was trying to get the elevator car to move in order to escape from someone pursuing her.&lt;ref name="LA Times Youku blog post"/&gt; Others suggested that she might be under the influence of [[MDMA|ecstasy]] or some other party drug.&lt;ref name="LA weekly article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Romero|first=Dennis|title=Elisa Lam: Why Did She Appear To Be Acting So Strange?|url=http://www.laweekly.com/news/elisa-lam-why-did-she-appear-to-be-acting-so-strange-4172464|newspaper=[[LA Weekly]]|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=February 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When her [[bipolar disorder]] became known, the theory that she was having a [[psychotic episode]] also emerged.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt;

Other viewers argued that the video had been tampered with before being made public. Despite the obscuring of the timestamp, they claimed, parts had been slowed down, and nearly a minute of footage had been discreetly removed. This could have been done simply to protect the identity of someone who otherwise would be in the video but had little or nothing to do with the case, or to conceal evidence if Lam's disappearance and death had been the result of a criminal act.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt;

==Discovery of body==
During the search for Lam, guests at the hotel began complaining about low water pressure. Some later claimed their water was colored black, and had an unusual taste.&lt;ref name="IBT body discovery story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Agomuoh|first=Fionna|title=Body Of Elisa Lam, Canadian Tourist.

On the morning of February 19, Lam's body was found in one of four 1,000-gallon (3,785 L) tanks providing water to guest rooms, a kitchen, and a coffee shop.&lt;ref name="CBS body discovery story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elisa Lam Death: Officials analyze water in tank where missing Canadian woman was found dead|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/elisa-lam-death-officials-analyze-water-in-tank-where-missing-canadian-woman-was-found-dead/|newspaper=[[CBS News]]|date=February 21, 2013|accessdate=January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LAist 2015 post on lawsuit"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rylah|first=Juliet Bennett|title=Cecil Hotel Employee Explains How He Found The Body Of Elisa Lam|url=http://laist.com/2015/10/01/elisa_lam_wrongful_death_suit.php|newspaper=LAist.com|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=October 16, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151026145142/http://laist.com/2015/10/01/elisa_lam_wrongful_death_suit.php|archivedate=October 26, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tank was drained and cut open since its maintenance hatch was too small to accommodate equipment needed to remove Lam's body.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CBS body discovery story" /&gt;

On February 21, the Los Angeles coroner's office issued a finding of accidental drowning, with [[bipolar disorder]] as a significant factor.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 1–10"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/1/ 1]–10.&lt;/ref&gt;
The full coroner's report, released in June,&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt; stated that Lam's body had been found naked;&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 20" /&gt; clothing similar to that she was wearing in the elevator video was floating in the water, coated with a "sand-like particulate". Her watch and room key were also found with her.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 1–10" /&gt;

Lam's body was moderately decomposed and [[Decomposition#bloat|bloated]]. It was mostly greenish, with some marbling evident on the abdomen and skin separation evident. There was no evidence of physical trauma, [[sexual assault]],&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 1–10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 13"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/13/ 13]&lt;/ref&gt; or suicide.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 1–10" /&gt;
[[Toxicology]] tests{{snd}}incomplete because not enough of her blood was preserved{{snd}}showed traces consistent with prescription medication found among her belongings, plus nonprescription drugs such as [[Sinutab]] and [[ibuprofen]].&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 22–25"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/22/ 22]–25&lt;/ref&gt; A very small quantity of alcohol (about 0.02 g%) was present, but no other [[recreational drug]]s.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 26"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/26/ 26]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unresolved issues==
The investigation had determined how Lam died, but did not offer an explanation as to how she got into the tank in the first place. Doors and stairs that access the hotel's roof are locked, with only staff having the passcodes and keys, and any attempt to force them would supposedly have triggered an alarm.&lt;ref name="cbc1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/world/missing-canadian-woman-s-body-found-at-l-a-hotel-1.1357199 |title=Missing Canadian woman's body found at L.A. hotel: Vancouver resident Elisa Lam, last seen at Cecil Hotel, missing since Jan. 31 |publisher=CBC News |date=19 February 2013 |accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the hotel's [[fire escape]] could have allowed her to bypass those security measures, if she (or someone who might have accompanied her there) had known.&lt;ref name="Erickson story" /&gt; A video made by a Chinese user after Lam's death and posted to the Internet showed that the hotel's roof was easily accessible via the fire escape and that two of the lids of the water tanks were open.&lt;ref name="Hotel roof video"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=Kay Theng |date=March 2, 2013 |script-title=zh:【藍可兒出事酒店迷思大揭開】|trans-title=Elisa Lam opens a big mystery of the hotel|medium=Internet video |language=Chinese|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YweZJeZo13A&amp;lc=z13hepjysuecyn0wc04chfzwqkuvtfp5as40k|access-date=January 11, 2017|format=Internet video|publisher=[[YouTube]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from the question of how she got on the roof, others asked if she could have gotten into the tank by herself. All four tanks are {{convert|4|by|8|ft|adj=on}} cylinders propped up on [[Concrete masonry unit|concrete block]]s;&lt;ref name="NBC body recovery story"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lloyd|first1=Jonathan|last2=Ordaz|first2=Rosa|title=Death of Tourist in Hotel Water Tank Ruled Accidental Drowning|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Tourist-Cecil-Hotel-Water-Tank-Drowning-Death-212363761.html|newspaper=[[KNBC-TV]]|date=June 21, 2013|accessdate=February 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; there is no fixed access to them and hotel workers had to use a ladder to look at the water. They are protected by heavy lids that would be difficult to replace from within.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt; Police dogs that searched through the hotel for Lam, even on the roof, shortly after her disappearance was noted, did not find any trace of her (although they had not searched the area near the water tanks).&lt;ref name="LA Times body discovery story" /&gt;

Theories about Lam's behavior in the elevator video did not stop with her death. Some argued that she was attempting to hide from a pursuer, perhaps someone ultimately responsible for her death, while others said she was merely frustrated with the elevator's apparent malfunction.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt; Some proponents of the theory that she was under the influence of illicit drugs are not dissuaded by their absence from the toxicology screen, suggesting that they might have broken down during the period of time her body decomposed in the tank, or that she might have taken rare cocktails of such drugs that a normal screen would not detect.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt;

The autopsy report and its conclusions have also been questioned. For instance, it does not say what the results of the [[rape kit]] and fingernail kit were, or even if they were processed.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt; It also records subcutaneous pooling of blood in Lam's anal area,&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 1–10" /&gt; which some observers suggested was a sign of sexual abuse; however one pathologist has noted it could also have resulted from bloating in the course of the body's decomposition,&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt; and her [[rectum]] was also [[rectal prolapse|prolapsed]].&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 12"&gt;Autopsy report, [http://www.pdf-archive.com/2014/02/24/el-autopsy/preview/page/12/ 12].&lt;/ref&gt;

Even the coroner's pathologists appeared to be ambivalent about their conclusion that Lam's death was accidental.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt; One page of the report has a form with boxes to check as to whether the death was accidental, natural, homicide, suicide or undetermined, in large type and a sufficient distance from each other. The "accident" box is dated June 15; however three days later the "undetermined" box was checked instead. This was at some point in the three days before the report's release noted as an error and crossed out and initialed.&lt;ref name="Autopsy report 15" /&gt;

Since her death, her [[Tumblr]] blog was updated, presumably through Tumblr's Queue option which allows posts to automatically publish themselves when the user is away. Her phone was not found either with her body or in her hotel room; it has been assumed to have been stolen at some time around her death. Whether the continued updates to her blog were facilitated by the theft of her phone, the work of a hacker, or through the Queue, is not known; nor is it known whether the updates are related to her death.&lt;ref name="Daily Maverick December 2014 article" /&gt;

==Litigation==

In September, Lam's parents filed a [[wrongful death]] suit, claiming the hotel failed to "inspect and seek out hazards in the hotel that presented an unreasonable risk of danger to (Lam) and other hotel guests" and seeking unspecified damages and burial costs.&lt;ref name="Lam parents lawsuit story"&gt;{{cite news|title=Parents Of Woman Found Dead In Water Tank Sue Hotel For Wrongful Death|url=http://losangeles.cbslocal.com/2013/09/20/parents-of-woman-found-dead-in-water-tank-sue-hotel-for-wrongful-death/|newspaper=[[KCBS-TV]]|date=September 20, 2013|accessdate=February 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The hotel argued it could not have reasonably foreseen that Lam might have entered the water tanks, and that since it remained unknown how Lam got to the water tank no liability could be assigned for failing to prevent that.&lt;ref name="LAist 2015 post on lawsuit" /&gt;
In 2015, the suit was dismissed.&lt;ref name="Lawsuit dismissal"&gt;{{cite news|author=[[City News Service]]|title=Negligence Lawsuit Dismissed After Downtown LA Hotel Water Tank Death|url=http://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/elisa-lam-hotel-downtown-la-lawsuit-negligence-dismissed-parents-362056501.html|newspaper=[[KNBC]]|date=December 14, 2015|accessdate=December 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The circumstances of Lam's death have been compared to plot elements in the 2005 horror film ''[[Dark Water (2005 film)|Dark Water]]''. In that film, an American remake of [[Dark Water (2002 film)|an earlier Japanese film of the same name]] based on [[Dark Water (short story collection)|a 1996 short story]] by [[Koji Suzuki]], a mother and daughter move into a rundown apartment building. A dysfunctional elevator and discolored water gushing from the building's faucets eventually lead them to the building's rooftop water tank, where they discover the body of a girl who had been reported missing from the building a year earlier.&lt;ref name="College Times story" /&gt;

As [[Life imitating art|life had imitated art]] with ''Dark Water'', the creators of films and television shows used the Lam case as inspiration for their own works. In May 2013, the episode "Watershed" aired as [[List of Castle episodes#Season 5 (2012–13)|that year's]] [[season finale]] of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series ''[[Castle (TV series)|Castle]]'', in which a New York police detective and the title character, a mystery novelist, investigate crimes. In "Watershed", the duo pursue leads in the death of a young woman found dead in the rooftop water tank of the "Cedric Hotel" in Manhattan; among the evidence is a surveillance video of the woman taken in an elevator. Ultimately she is found to have been posing as a prostitute in order to investigate another guest at the hotel.&lt;ref name="HuffPost BC Castle season finale"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elisa Lam Death Echoed In 'Castle' Season Finale|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2013/05/14/elisa-lam-death-castle-season-finale_n_3274668.html|newspaper=[[HuffPost]]|date=May 14, 2013|accessdate=February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another ABC series, ''[[How to Get Away with Murder]]'', had a similar story line. Over a series of flashbacks spread out across the [[How to Get Away with Murder (season 1)|first season]], which began airing in 2014, it is revealed that a sorority girl missing at the start of the season was murdered and that her body has been hidden in the water tank on the roof of the sorority house. Similarly, her body is only discovered when a maintenance worker is called to the house to address a water pressure issue.&lt;ref name="Tv.com post"&gt;{{cite news|last=Campbell|first=Nick|title=''How to Get Away with Murder'' "It's All Her Fault" Review: The Quiet Ones are Dangerous|url=http://www.tv.com/news/how-to-get-away-with-murder-its-all-her-fault-review-the-quiet-ones-are-dangerous-141235288433/|newspaper=[[TV.com]]|date=October 3, 2014|accessdate=March 4, 2018|quote= Is Lila Stangard inspired by Elisa Lam?}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong, from which Lam's family had emigrated to Vancouver, filmmakers were also inspired by the case. [[Nick Cheung]], an accomplished actor in [[Cinema of Hong Kong|Hong Kong films]], made his directorial debut in 2014 with ''[[Hungry Ghost Ritual]]'', a horror thriller that includes a scene in which a ghost terrorizes a young woman in an elevator, shot to look like security-camera footage and believed to have been inspired by the Cecil's Lam footage.&lt;ref name="Hungry Ghost Ritual twitch review"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsh|first=James|title=Review: ''Hungry Ghost Ritual'' Has No Appetite For Horror|url=http://twitchfilm.com/2014/07/review-hungry-ghost-ritual-has-no-appetite-for-horror.html|publisher=[[Twitchfilm.net]]|date=July 11, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210223114/http://twitchfilm.com/2014/07/review-hungry-ghost-ritual-has-no-appetite-for-horror.html|archivedate=February 10, 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[mainland China]], director [[Liu Hao (director)|Liu Hao]] announced a year after Lam's death that he would be making a film based on it; he went to Los Angeles himself and stayed for a few days at the Cecil doing research.&lt;ref name="Chinese movies story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Huan|first=Si|title=Elisa Lam's mysterious death to become horror movie|url=http://www.ecns.cn/cns-wire/2014/03-07/103839.shtml|newspaper=[[China News Service]]|date=March 7, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese media have reported that popular actress [[Gao Yuanyuan]] may be interested in playing Lam.&lt;ref name="Gao Yuanyuan Chinese story"&gt;{{cite news|title=高圆圆可能演《蓝可儿》 经纪人：无定论|trans-title=Agent: Gao Yuanyuan may play Elisa Lam|url=http://ent.sina.com.cn/m/c/2013-08-05/14403980332.shtml|newspaper=[[Sina Corp|Sina]]|language=Chinese|date=August 5, 2013|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Liu said if he made the film, it would likely be an American-Australian coproduction in English.&lt;ref name="Huanqiu film piece"&gt;{{cite news|author=Yan Ni|title=蓝可儿事件将上大银幕 高圆圆有望演女主角|trans-title=Actress Gao Yuanyuan expected to play Elisa Lam on big screen|url=http://ent.huanqiu.com/movie/yingshi-neidi/2013-08/4210279.html|newspaper=Xi'an Evening News|language=Chinese|date=August 5, 2013|accessdate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, a little over a year after Lam's death, brothers Brandon and Philip Murphy sold a horror script, ''The Bringing'', that uses the investigation into it as a [[backstory]] for a fictional investigating detective's slowly unraveling sanity. They were widely criticized for doing this so soon after the death.&lt;ref name="SCMP movie story" /&gt; Danish director [[Nicolas Winding Refn]] was originally slated to direct the film, but in August it was announced that Jeremy Lovering would direct the film for [[Sony Pictures]] whenever production began .&lt;ref name="Deadline Lovering story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fleming Jr.|first=Mike|title=Jeremy Lovering To Helm Sony Horror Pic 'The Bringing,' Inspired By Cecil Hotel|url=http://deadline.com/2014/08/jeremy-lovering-to-helm-sony-horror-pic-the-bringing-inspired-by-cecil-hotel-823047/|newspaper=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=August 21, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 [[music video|video]] for Vancouver pop duo [[The Zolas]]' "Ancient Mars" is meant to be an idealized representation of Lam's last day, showing a young woman exploring Los Angeles and taking in simple pleasures. "It bugged me how tidily people explained away her disappearance with drugs or mental illness," said singer Zach Gray, who attended UBC around the same time and had a friend who knew Lam. "Though it's mostly fiction we wanted people to see it and feel like she was a real girl and a familiar girl and not just a police report."&lt;ref name="Ancient Mars video"&gt;{{cite news|title=Elisa Lam Case Inspires The Zolas' 'Ancient Mars' Music Video|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.ca/2014/01/24/elisa-lam-the-zolas-music-video-ancient-mars_n_4654774.html|newspaper=[[Huffington Post|Huffington Post Canada]]|date=January 24, 2014|accessdate=August 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the American [[post-hardcore]] band [[Hail the Sun]] wrote "Disappearing Syndrome", also inspired by Lam's story. "It's such a chilling and eerie case," said the band's guitarist, Aric Garcia, in a [[Reddit]] Ask Me Anything.&lt;ref name="Hail the Sun Reddit AMA"&gt;{{cite web|last=Garcia|first=Aric|title=Hey guys, we are Hail the Sun.

In 2015, the media speculated that the [[American Horror Story: Hotel|fifth season]] of ''[[American Horror Story]]'' was inspired by Lam's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Miska|first=Brad|title="American Horror Story: Hotel" Based On Elise Lam’s Bizarre True Story|url=http://bloody-disgusting.com/news/3356495/american-horror-story-hotel-based-elise-lams-bizarre-true-story/|newspaper=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|date=August 21, 2014|accessdate=February 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late spring creator [[Ryan Murphy (writer)|Ryan Murphy]] said the next season would be set in a hotel in present-day Los Angeles. He was inspired, he added, by a surveillance video of a young woman who "got into an elevator at a downtown hotel ... [and] was never seen again." He did not use her name but it was believed he was talking about Lam.&lt;ref name="HuffPost.ca AHS story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Whitney|first=Erin|title='American Horror Story: Hotel' Might Be Inspired By This Real-Life Mystery|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/american-horror-story-hotel-elisa-lam_55c4f87fe4b0f1cbf1e4f1d1|newspaper=[[HuffPost]]|date=August 7, 2015|accessdate=October 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, [[Sun Kil Moon]] released the songs "Window Sash Weights" and "Stranger Than Paradise" as part of their album ''[[Common as Light and Love Are Red Valleys of Blood]]'' (2017); the songs specifically reference the event and promote the idea that it was a hoax. Band member [[Mark Kozelek]] said in an interview "I've come to the conclusion that nobody died in the water tank. There’s no way to identify the girl on the elevator, as her face is pixelated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sunkilmoon.com/interview_conor_oberst_mark_kozelek_2017.html|title=Conor Oberst interviews Mark Kozelek about the new Sun Kil Moon album|website=www.sunkilmoon.com|access-date=2017-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{italics title}}
'''''Eccky''''' is an [[online game]]. Until 2009, it was an [[MSN]]-based [[life simulation game]] in which two people work together to create and raise a [[Virtuality|virtual]] baby. ''Eccky'' won the 2005 SpinAwards for Innovation and for Best Interactive Concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spinawards.nl/Zoeken/?searchQuery=ekky#URI=%3Fpage%3D2_5_8|title=SpinAwards: 2005|work=SpinAwards|accessdate=2009-04-09|date=13 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the game play changed to a real-time [[virtual world]] on [[Hyves]].

== History ==
''Eccky'' was created in August 2005 by Dutch developer Media Republic in association with [[MSN]] in the Netherlands. ''Eccky'' has characteristics of [[life simulation]] and [[virtual pet]] games. The gameplay of the first version of ''Eccky'' involved a virtual baby, or Eccky, which was born on the basis of information derived from both ''Eccky'' user players. ''Eccky'' used an [[AIML]] [[Chatterbot|chatbot]] and [[MSN Messenger]] for chat between users and the Eccky baby. In 2006, ''Eccky'' became an independent company as a subsidiary of Media Republic.

From its live introduction to the public until August 2006, ''Eccky'' required an initial fee which could be paid by either user player. However ''Eccky'' has been free to play since September 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Eccky will be free  | url=http://www.eccky.com  | accessdate = 2006-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news   | last = Tomesen  | first = Remco  | title = Eccky vanaf september gratis  | publisher = Emerce.nl  |date= 2006-07-14  | url = http://emerce.nl/nieuws.jsp?id=1627157  | accessdate = 2006-07-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Eccky 1.0 (2005-2007)==
In the first version of ''Eccky'', two users create a virtual baby, and raise him/her with the goal of making the child as happy and satisfied as possible. A user fills out a questionnaire with information regarding their personal characteristics, child-rearing attitudes, favorites, etc. Once registration and the "[[DNA]]" test have been completed, a user may invite another person to make an Eccky. Upon accepting the invitation, the second user also registers on the Eccky website, and completes his/her own "DNA" test. Both players then choose both a [[masculine]] and [[Grammatical gender#Personal names|feminine]] name for their future Eccky. Thereafter Eccky is born, with characteristics determined by the combination of both users' DNA profiles. Eccky's sex is randomly determined, as is Eccky’s name (which is chosen randomly between the four possible names chosen by the user parents).

Over a six-day period from Eccky’s birth, Eccky grows and ages three years for every one day of gameplay. Thus, in six days, Eccky develops from a cooing baby into an eighteen-year-old young adult with its own character. Every Eccky is unique at birth, and the way in which the users raise their Eccky further individualizes Eccky’s demeanor and characteristics. On the sixth day, or upon turning 18, Eccky leaves the house to venture off into the wide world, and the game ends.

''Eccky'' played principally via the Eccky website and MSN Messenger, though also via mobile phone. Upon Eccky’s birth, Eccky is automatically added as a contact to the MSN contact lists of both players. This allows users to talk to their virtual child. Running on an [[AIML]] [[chat engine]], Eccky is able to speak from the moment following birth, both in response to users addressing Eccky and by initiating [[conversation]]s him/herself. Eccky initiates conversation either randomly or to express any particularly pressing need he/she may have (i.e. being extremely hungry, having to go to the bathroom, being very sick, feeling neglected, etc.) Eccky’s [[vocabulary]] is initially limited to newborn babble. Then, as with a real child, Eccky’s command of vocabulary grows with each day of gameplay, to a final capability of being able to respond with over 60,000 unique answers on more than 4,000 diverse subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher=Media Republic |date=2005-10-27 | title=Media Republic introduces Eccky BETA in collaboration with MSN | url=http://www.eccky.com/weblog/eccky_pressrelease_en.doc}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since June 2007, Eccky also features an in-game chat functionality.

Eccky and users can also exchange text messages via mobile phone. Exchange of text messages requires that the user have a mobile phone, and that the user purchase a mobile phone for Eccky within the game environment. This feature involves extra costs to the user, specifically the cost of sending text messages, and can be turned on and off at the user's discretion.

Most games are intended to be played with users playing against their Eccky and vice versa. Others are played in cooperation with Eccky. Of note are the racing games, some of which allow users to create their own tracks and race on them with Eccky. Though most games are free to play, some games require additional credits to play.

Eccky’s physical and emotional states are subject to continual change, determined by 180 dynamic variables, and are influenced by the interaction with and treatment by users, both via the virtual world and via the chat. The levels of these physical and emotional states are continually assessed and are made visible to users via meters that gauge happiness, hunger, toilet needs, popularity, who Eccky’s favorite parent is, etc. For example, if Eccky is not sufficiently fed, users will see this in Eccky’s hunger meter. In worst-case scenarios, an Eccky can be neglected, physical and emotionally, to the point of needing to be sent to the hospital. During this time, gameplay continues and users may chat with Eccky, but may not interact with Eccky in the virtual world. Further, Eccky’s physical and emotional states are reflected in the chat element, as Eccky will either comment, unsolicited, on how he/she is doing physically and emotionally, or respond to a user in such a way as to make his/her physical and emotional state known.

It is also possible to send Eccky away for a period, either to live in other accommodations such as in a hotel, on vacation, or to stay with a babysitter. A babysitter may be anyone with an MSN Messenger account. Sending Eccky to a hotel or on vacation does involve additional costs (sending Eccky to a babysitter does not), and as with Eccky staying in the hospital, users may continue to speak with Eccky via chat but cannot interact with Eccky in the virtual world setting during this time. A user can retrieve their Eccky at any time during a stay away from home. Eccky was closed down in 2007 and until it was launched in a new format in 2009.

==Eccky 2.0 (Since 2009)==
In 2009 Dutch/Chinese developer TribePlay created a new version of ''Eccky'' and launched it in Hyves as one of the first social networking virtual worlds. In ''Eccky'' players can make a character (an Eccky) with their social network profile. After that they enter the Eccky world. In this world they have access to various locations, such as a city center, park, mountain top and beach. Players can also visit their own or other users' houses. In any of these virtual locations players can chat, play mini games and do a variety of other things.

''Eccky'' is integrated into [[Hyves]] and Facebook. Together with their Hyves or Facebook friends players can chat, play mini games and post their Eccky's activities on their social networking profile. ''Eccky'' has many [[game]]s. Games can be played in single-player or multi-player format. Ecckies can also play with their Wobble. A Wobble is Eccky’s own [[pet]]. Wobbles were the first inhabitants of the Eccky world. Wobbles live together with Ecckies and need to be taken care of. Once Ecckies advance in levels they receive [[Superpower (ability)|superpower]]s to be used in the game.

The '''Galápagos tortoise''' complex or '''Galápagos giant tortoise''' complex (''Chelonoidis nigra'' and related species) are the largest living species of [[tortoise]]. Modern Galápagos tortoises can weigh up to {{convert|417|kg|lb|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="Guinness2002"&gt;{{cite web|title=2002: Largest Tortoise|publisher=Official Guinness World Records|author=White Matt|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/news/60at60/2015/8/2002-largest-tortoise-392870|accessdate=2015-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, giant tortoises exist only on two remote archipelagos: the [[Galápagos Islands]] 1000&amp;nbsp;km due west of mainland [[Ecuador]], and [[Aldabra]] in the [[Indian Ocean]], 700&amp;nbsp;km east of [[Tanzania]].

The Galápagos tortoises are native to seven of the [[Galápagos Islands]], a volcanic [[archipelago]] about {{convert|1000|km|mi|abbr=on|-1}} west of the Ecuadorian mainland. With lifespans in the wild of over 100 years, it is one of the longest-lived [[vertebrates]]. A captive individual lived at least 170&amp;nbsp;years. Spanish explorers, who discovered the islands in the 16th century, named them after the Spanish ''galápago'', meaning "tortoise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagos.to/TEXTS/GALAPAGO.HTM |title=On the Origin of &lt;s&gt;Species&lt;/s&gt; 'Galápago' |last1=Woram |first1=John |date= n.d.|website=Las Encantadas: Human and Cartographic History of the Galápagos Islands |publisher=Rockville Press, Inc. |access-date=21 September 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Turtle shell|Shell]] size and shape vary between populations. On islands with humid highlands, the tortoises are larger, with domed shells and short necks; on islands with dry lowlands, the tortoises are smaller, with "saddleback" shells and long necks. [[Charles Darwin|Charles Darwin's]] observations of these differences on the [[second voyage of HMS Beagle|second voyage of the ''Beagle'']] in 1835, contributed to the [[Evolution|development of his theory of evolution]].

Tortoise numbers declined from over 250,000 in the 16th century to a low of around 3,000 in the 1970s. This decline was caused by [[overexploitation]] of the species for meat and oil, [[Habitat destruction|habitat clearance]] for agriculture, and introduction of non-native animals to the islands, such as rats, goats, and pigs. The extinction of most giant tortoise lineages is thought to have also been caused by predation by humans or human ancestors, as the tortoises themselves have no natural predators. Tortoise populations on at least three islands have become extinct in historical times due to human activities. Specimens of these extinct taxa exist in several museums and also are being subjected to DNA analysis. Ten species of the original 15 survive in the wild; an 11th species (''[[Chelonoidis abingdonii]]'') had only a single known living individual, kept in captivity and nicknamed [[Lonesome George]] until his death in June 2012. Conservation efforts, beginning in the 20th century, have resulted in thousands of [[Captive breeding|captive-bred]] juveniles being released onto their ancestral home islands, and the total number of the species is estimated to have exceeded 19,000 at the start of the 21st century. Despite this rebound, the species as a whole is classified as "vulnerable" by the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]].

==Taxonomy==

===Early classification===
The Galápagos Islands were discovered in 1535, but first appeared on the maps, of [[Gerardus Mercator]] and [[Abraham Ortelius]], around 1570.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Stewart |first=P.D. |title=Galápagos: the islands that changed the world |publisher=Yale University Press |location=New Haven |year=2006 |page=43 |isbn=978-0-300-12230-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islands were named "Insulae de los Galopegos" (Islands of the Tortoises) in reference to the giant tortoises found there.&lt;ref name=Pritchard1996P17&gt;{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Jackson | first = Michael Hume | title =Galápagos, a natural history| publisher = University of Calgary Press |location=Calgary| year =1993| page = 1| isbn = 1-895176-07-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group="nb"&gt;The first navigation chart showing the individual islands was drawn up by the pirate [[Ambrose Cowley]] in 1684. He named them after fellow pirates or English noblemen. More recently, the Ecuadorian government gave most of the islands Spanish names. While the Spanish names are official, many researchers continue to use the older English names, particularly as those were the names used when Darwin visited. This article uses the Spanish island names.&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially, the giant tortoises of the Indian Ocean and those from the Galápagos were considered to be the same species. Naturalists thought that sailors had transported the tortoises there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=27}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1676, the pre-Linnaean authority [[Claude Perrault]] referred to both species as ''Tortue des Indes''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Perrault| first =Claude|authorlink=Claude Perrault|year= 1676|title=Suite des memoires pour servir a l'histoire naturelle des animaux|publisher= Académie de Sciences|location= Paris|pages=92–205|language= French }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1783, [[Johann Gottlob Schneider]] classified all giant tortoises as ''Testudo indica'' ("Indian tortoise").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schneider |first=Johann Gottlob |authorlink=Johann Gottlob Schneider |year=1783 |language=German |title=Allgemeine Naturgeschischte der Schildkröten nebs einem systematischen Verzeichnisse der einzelnen Arten und zwey Kupfen |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wl5HAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA355 |pages=355–356 |location=Leipzig

===Recognition of subpopulations===
The first systematic survey of giant tortoises was by the zoologist [[Albert Günther]] of the [[British Museum]], in 1875.&lt;ref name='G1875'/&gt; Günther identified at least five distinct populations from the Galápagos, and three from the Indian Ocean islands. He expanded the list in 1877 to six from the Galápagos, four from the [[Seychelles]], and four from the [[Mascarene Islands|Mascarenes]]. Günther hypothesized that all the giant tortoises descended from a single ancestral population which spread by sunken [[land bridge]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Günther|1877|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This hypothesis was later disproven by the understanding that the Galápagos, Seychelles, and Mascarene islands are all of recent volcanic origin and have never been linked to a continent by land bridges.  Galápagos tortoises are now thought to have descended from a South American ancestor,&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt; while the Indian Ocean tortoises derived from ancestral populations on Madagascar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Austin |first=Jeremy|author2=Arnold, E.

Slevin]] in charge of reptiles, collected specimens which were studied by Academy herpetologist [[John Van Denburgh]]. He identified four additional populations,&lt;ref name="VD1907"/&gt; and proposed the existence of 15 species.&lt;ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'/&gt; Van Denburgh's list still guides the [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]] of the Galápagos tortoise, though now 10 populations are thought to have existed.&lt;ref name='R2010'/&gt;

|accessdate=2012-01-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Quoy and Gaimard's Latin description explains the use of ''nigra: "Testudo toto corpore nigro"'' means "tortoise with completely black body". Quoy and Gairmard described ''nigra'' from a living specimen, but no evidence indicates they knew of its accurate provenance within the Galápagos – the locality was in fact given as California. Garman proposed the linking of ''nigra'' with the extinct [[Floreana Island tortoise|Floreana]] species.&lt;ref name='Garman'/&gt; Later, Pritchard deemed it convenient to accept this designation, despite its tenuousness, for minimal disruption to the already confused nomenclature of the species.

Previously, the Galápagos tortoise was considered to belong to the genus ''[[Geochelone]]'', known as 'typical tortoises' or 'terrestrial turtles'. In the 1990s, subgenus ''[[Chelonoidis]]'' was elevated to generic status based on [[phylogenetic]] evidence which grouped the South American members of ''Geochelone'' into an independent [[clade]] (branch of the [[tree of life (biology)|tree of life]]).&lt;ref name = "Le et al."&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ympev.2006.03.003 |url = http://www.iucn-tftsg.org/wp-content/uploads/file/Articles/Le_etal_2006.pdf |last=Le |first=Minh |author2=Raxworthy, Christopher J. |author3=McCord, William P. |author4= Mertz, Lisa  |year=2006 |title=A molecular phylogeny of tortoises (Testudines:Testudinidae) based on mitochondrial and nuclear genes |journal=[[Molecular Phylogenetics and Evolution]] |volume=40 |issue=2 |pages=517–531 |pmid=16678445 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This nomenclature has been adopted by several authorities.&lt;ref name='iucnredlist.org'&gt;Tortoise &amp; Freshwater Turtle Specialist Group.

Within the archipelago, up to 15 species of Galápagos tortoises have been identified, although only 11 survive to this day. Six are found on separate islands; five of them on the volcanoes of [[Isabela Island (Galápagos)|Isabela Island]]. Several of the surviving species are seriously endangered.&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt; One of the species, ''[[Chelonoidis nigra abingdonii|C. abingdonii]]'' from [[Pinta Island]], is considered [[extinct]].

Prior to widespread knowledge of the differences between the populations (sometimes called [[Race (biology)|races]]) from different islands and volcanoes, captive collections in zoos were indiscriminately mixed.

==Evolutionary history==
All [[species of Galápagos tortoise]]s evolved from common ancestors that arrived from mainland South America by overwater [[biological dispersal|dispersal]]. Genetic studies have shown that the [[Chaco tortoise]] of Argentina and Paraguay is their closest living relative.&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt; The minimal founding population was a pregnant female or a breeding pair.&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt; Survival on the 1000-km oceanic journey is accounted for because the tortoises are buoyant, can breathe by extending their necks above the water, and are able to survive months without food or fresh water.&lt;ref name = "Le et al."/&gt; As they are poor swimmers, the journey was probably a passive one facilitated by the [[Humboldt Current]], which diverts westwards towards the Galápagos Islands from the mainland.&lt;ref name="Caccone2002"/&gt; The ancestors of the genus ''[[Chelonoidis]]'' are believed to have similarly dispersed from Africa to South America during the [[Oligocene]].&lt;ref name = "Le et al."/&gt;

The closest living relative (though not a direct ancestor) of the Galápagos giant tortoise is the [[Chaco tortoise]] (''Chelonoidis chilensis''), a much smaller species from South America. The divergence between ''C.&amp;nbsp;chilensis'' and ''C.&amp;nbsp;nigra'' probably occurred 6–12&amp;nbsp;million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern Galápagos Islands 5&amp;nbsp;million years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=White|first = William M.|year= 1993|title =Petrology and geochemistry of the Galápagos Islands: portrait of a pathological mantle plume|journal= Journal of Geophysical Research|volume=98|issue=B11|pages=19533–19564|doi=10.1029/93JB02018|bibcode=1993JGR....9819533W|last2=McBirney|first2=Alexander R.|last3=Duncan|first3=Robert A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mitochondrial DNA]] analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (Española and San Cristóbal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a "stepping stone" fashion via local currents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicholls|2006|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Beheregaray |first=Luciano B.|author2=Gibbs, James P. |author3=Havill, Nathan |author4=Fritts, Thomas H. |author5=Powell, Jeffrey R. |author6= Caccone, Adalgisa |year=2004|title=Giant tortoises are not so slow: rapid diversification and biogeographic consensus in the Galápagos|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|volume=101|issue=17|pages=6514–6519|doi=10.1073/pnas.0400393101|pmc=404076|bibcode=2004PNAS..101.6514B}}&lt;/ref&gt; Restricted [[gene flow]] between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern species. The evolutionary relationships between the species thus echo the volcanic history of the islands.&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt;

===Species===
Modern [[molecular phylogenetics|DNA methods]] have revealed new information on the relationships between the species:

;Isabela Island
The five populations living on the largest island, Isabela, are the ones that are the subject of the most debate as to whether they are true species or just distinct populations or subspecies. It is widely accepted that the population living on the northernmost volcano, Volcan Wolf, is genetically independent from the four populations to the south and is therefore a separate species.&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt; It is thought to be derived from a different colonization event than the others. A colonization from the island of Santiago apparently gave rise to the Volcan Wolf species (''C. becki'') while the four southern populations are believed to be descended from a second colonization from the more southerly island of Santa Cruz.&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt; Tortoises from Santa Cruz are thought to have first colonized the Sierra Negra volcano, which was the first of the island's volcanoes to form. The tortoises then spread north to each newly created volcano, resulting in the populations living on Volcan Alcedo and then Volcan Darwin. Recent genetic evidence shows that these two populations are genetically distinct from each other and from the population living on Sierra Negra (''C. guentheri'') and therefore form the species ''C. vandenburghi'' (Alcedo) and ''C. microphyes'' (Darwin).&lt;ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727–1744"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Ciofi, Claudio |author2=Wilson, Gregory A. |author3=Beheregaray, Luciano B. |author4=Marquez, Cruz |author5=Gibbs, James P. |author6=Tapia, Washington |author7=Snell, Howard L. |author8=Caccone, Adalgisa |author9=Powell, Jeffrey R. |year=2006|title=Phylogeographic history and gene flow among giant Galápagos tortoises on southern Isabela Island |journal= Genetics| volume =172|issue=3|pages=1727–1744|doi=10.1534/genetics.105.047860|pmid=16387883|pmc=1456292}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fifth population living on the southernmost volcano (''C. vicina'') is thought to have split off from the Sierra Negra population more recently and is therefore not as genetically different as the other two.&lt;ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727–1744"/&gt; Isabela is the most recently formed island tortoises inhabit, so its populations have had less time to evolve independently than populations on other islands, but according to some researchers, they are all genetically different and should each be considered as separate species.&lt;ref name="Ciofi 2006 1727–1744"/&gt;

;Floreana Island
Phylogenetic analysis may help to "resurrect" the extinct species of Floreana (''C. nigra'') – a species known only from [[subfossil]] remains.&lt;ref name='S1986'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Steadman |first=David W. |year=1986 |title=Holocene vertebrate fossils from Isla Floreana, Galápagos |journal=Smithsonian Contributions to Zoology |url=http://si-pddr.si.edu/dspace/bitstream/10088/5333/2/SCtZ-0413-Lo_res.pdf |volume=413 |pages=1–103 |doi=10.5479/si.00810282.413 |issue=413 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some tortoises from Isabela were found to be a partial match for the genetic profile of Floreana specimens from museum collections, possibly indicating the presence of [[hybrid (biology)|hybrids]] from a population transported by humans from Floreana to Isabela,&lt;ref name='Poulakakis 2008'/&gt; resulting either from individuals deliberately transported between the islands,&lt;ref name=Pritchard1996P65&gt;{{Harvnb|Pritchard|1996|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from individuals thrown overboard from ships to lighten the load.&lt;ref name='B1889'/&gt; Nine Floreana descendants have been identified in the captive population of the Fausto Llerena Breeding Center on Santa Cruz; the genetic footprint was identified in the genomes of hybrid offspring. This allows the possibility of re-establishing a [[Breeding back|reconstructed species]] from [[selective breeding]] of the hybrid animals.&lt;ref name='Russello 2010'&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Russello, Michael A. |author2=Poulakakis, Nikos |author3=Gibbs, James P. |author4=Tapia, Washington |author5=Benavides, Edgar |author6=Powell, Jeffrey R. |author7=Caccone, Adalgisa |year=2010 |title=DNA from the past informs ex situ conservation for the future: an extinct species of Galapagos tortoise identified in captivity |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=1 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0008683 |pmc=2800188 |pmid=20084268|pages=e8683 |bibcode=2010PLoSO...5.8683R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore,  individuals from the species possibly are still extant. Genetic analysis from a sample of tortoises from Volcan Wolf found 84 first-generation ''C. nigra'' hybrids, some less than 15 years old.

;Pinta Island
[[File:Lonesome George in profile.jpg|thumb|''C. abingdonii'' [[Lonesome George]] at the [[Charles Darwin Research Station]], in 2006]] 
The Pinta Island species (''C. abingdonii'', now extinct) has been found to be most closely related to the species on the islands of San Cristóbal (''C. chathamensis'') and Española (''C. hoodensis'') which lie over 300&amp;nbsp;km (190&amp;nbsp;mi) away,&lt;ref name="Caccone et al 1999"/&gt; rather than that on the neighbouring island of Isabela as previously assumed.

;Pinzón Island
When it was discovered that the central, small island of Pinzón had only 100–200 very old adults and no young tortoises had survived into adulthood for perhaps more than 70 years, the resident scientists initiated what would eventually become the Giant Tortoise Breeding and Rearing Program. Over the next 50 years, this program resulted in major successes in the recovery of giant tortoise populations throughout the archipelago.

In 1965, the first tortoise eggs collected from natural nests on Pinzón Island were brought to the Charles Darwin Research Station, where they would complete the period of incubation and then hatch, becoming the first young tortoises to be reared in captivity. The introduction of black rats onto Pinzón sometime in the latter half of the 19th century had resulted in the complete eradication of all young tortoises. Black rats had been eating both tortoise eggs and hatchlings, effectively destroying the future of the tortoise population. Only the longevity of giant tortoises allowed them to survive until The Galápagos National Park, [[Island Conservation]], Charles Darwin Foundation, The Raptor Center, and Bell Laboratories removed invasive rats in 2012. In 2013, heralding an important step in Pinzón tortoise recovery, hatchlings emerged from native Pinzón tortoise nests on the island and the Galápagos National Park successfully returned 118 hatchlings to their native island home. Partners returned to Pinzón Island in late 2014 and continued to observe hatchling tortoises (now older), indicating that natural recruitment is occurring on the island unimpeded. They also discovered a snail species new to science. These exciting results highlight the conservation value of this important management action. In early 2015, after extensive monitoring, partners confirmed that Pinzón and Plaza Sur Islands are now both rodent-free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.islandconservation.org/pinzon-island/|title=Pinzón Island, Galápagos - Island Conservation|work=Island Conservation|access-date=2018-03-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Española
On the southern island of Española, only 14 adult tortoises were found, two males and 12 females.  The tortoises apparently were not encountering one another, so no reproduction was occurring.  Between 1963 and 1974, all 14 adult tortoises discovered on the island were brought to the tortoise center on Santa Cruz and a tortoise breeding program was initiated. In 1977, a third Española male tortoise was returned to Galapagos from the San Diego Zoo and joined the breeding group.&lt;ref name="conservancy"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.galapagos.org/conservation/galapagos-giant-tortoise-webcam-project|title=Giant Tortoise Webcam Project|publisher=Galapagos Conservancy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150504001048/http://www.galapagos.org/conservation/galapagos-giant-tortoise-webcam-project/|archivedate=4 May 2015|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2015-05-04|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; After 40 years' work reintroducing captive animals, a detailed study of the island's ecosystem has confirmed it has a stable, breeding population. Where once 15 were known, now more than 1,000 giant tortoises inhabit the island of Española. One research team has found that more than half the tortoises released since the first reintroductions are still alive, and they are breeding well enough for the population to progress onward, unaided.&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite web |title=Giant tortoise makes 'miraculous' stable recovery |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-29801967 |accessdate=2015-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Species of doubtful existence
Species were described from three other islands, but their existence is based on scant evidence. The purported [[Rábida Island]] species (''C. wallacei'') was described from a single specimen collected by the [[California Academy of Sciences]] in December 1905,&lt;ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'/&gt; which has since been lost.

==Description==
[[File:Galapagos Riesenschildkröte Chelonoidis niger.ogg|thumb|Galápagos tortoise at the [[Rostock Zoo]]]]
The tortoises have a large bony shell of a dull brown or gray colour. The plates of the shell are fused with the ribs in a rigid protective structure that is integral to the skeleton. [[Lichen]]s can grow on the shells of these slow-moving animals.&lt;ref name='MacFarland 1972'&gt;{{cite journal|last=MacFarland|first=C.G.|year=1972|title=Giant tortoises, goliaths of the Galapagos|journal=National Geographic Magazine|volume=142|pages=632–649}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tortoises keep a characteristic [[scute]] (shell segment) pattern on their shells throughout life, though the annual growth bands are not useful for determining age because the outer layers are worn off with time. A tortoise can withdraw its head, neck, and fore limbs into its shell for protection. The legs are large and stumpy, with dry, scaly skin and hard [[Scale (zoology)|scales]]. The front legs have five claws, the back legs four.&lt;ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Van Denburgh|first=John|year=1914|title=The gigantic land tortoises of the Galapagos archipelago|journal=Proceedings of the California Academy of Sciences |series=Series 4|volume=2|issue=1|pages=203–374 |url=https://archive.org/stream/giganticlandtort01vand#page/n5/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galápagos tortoises possess two main shell forms that correlate with the biogeographic history of the species group. They exhibit a spectrum of carapace morphology ranging from "saddleback" (denoting upward arching of the front edge of the shell resembling a saddle) to "domed" (denoting a rounded convex surface resembling a dome). When a saddleback tortoise withdraws its head and forelimbs into its shell, a large unprotected gap remains over the neck, evidence of the lack of predation during the evolution of this structure.  Larger islands with humid highlands over {{convert|800|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation, such as Santa Cruz, have abundant vegetation near the ground.&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'&gt;{{cite book| last=De Vries|first= T.J. |year=1984|title=The giant tortoises: a natural history disturbed by man|work=Key Environments: Galapagos|pages= 145–156|publisher=Pergamon Press| location=Oxford|isbn= 0-08-027996-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tortoises native to these environments tend to have domed shells and are larger, with shorter necks and limbs. Saddleback tortoises originate from small islands less than {{convert|500|m|ft|abbr=on}} in elevation with dry habitats (e.g. Española and Pinzón) that are more limited in food and other resources.&lt;ref name="Caccone2002"/&gt; Two lineages of Galápagos tortoises possess the Island of Santa Cruz and when observed it is concluded that despite the shared similarities of growth patterns and morphological changes observed during growth, the two lineages and two sexes can be distinguished on the basis of distinct carapace features. Lineages differ by the shape of the vertebral and pleural scutes. Females have a more elongated and wider carapace shape than males. Carapace shape changes with growth, with vertebral scutes becoming narrower and pleural scutes becoming larger during late [[ontogeny]].

;Evolutionary implications
In combination with proportionally longer necks and limbs,&lt;ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'/&gt; the unusual saddleback carapace structure is thought to be an adaptation to increase vertical reach, which enables the tortoise to browse tall vegetation such as the ''[[Opuntia]]'' (prickly pear) cactus that grows in arid environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dawson|first=E.Y.|year=1966|chapter=Cacti in the Galápagos islands, with special reference to their relations with tortoises|editor-last=Bowman|editor-first=R.I|title=The Galápagos|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|pages=209–214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f8T3Dl5tokYC&amp;pg=PA209}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddlebacks are more territorial&lt;ref name='I. Bowman, M. Berson p. 107'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=de Neira |first=Lynn E. Fowler |author2=Roe, John H.|year=1984|title=Emergence success of tortoise nests and the effect of feral burros on nest success on Volcán Alcedo, Galapagos |jstor=1445152 |journal=Copeia |volume=1984|issue=3|pages=702–707 |doi=10.2307/1445152 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and smaller than domed varieties, possibly adaptations to limited resources. Alternatively, larger tortoises may be better-suited to high elevations because they can resist the cooler temperatures that occur with cloud cover or fog.&lt;ref name='Fritts 1984'/&gt;

A competing hypothesis is that, rather than being principally a feeding adaptation, the distinctive saddle shape and longer extremities might have been a [[Secondary sex characteristics|secondary sexual characteristic]] of saddleback males. Male competition over mates is settled by [[dominance (ethology)|dominance]] displays on the basis of vertical neck height rather than body size&lt;ref name='Fritts 1984'/&gt; ([[#Reproduction|see below]]). This correlates with the observation that saddleback males are more aggressive than domed males.&lt;ref name='Schafer and Krekorian 1983'&gt;{{cite journal|last= Schafer|first=Susan F.|author2=Krekorian, C. O'Neill|year=1983|title=Agonistic behavior of the Galapagos tortoise, ''Geochelone elephantopus'', with emphasis on its relationship to saddle-backed shell shape |journal=Herpetologica |volume=39|issue=4|pages=448–456|jstor=3892541}}&lt;/ref&gt; The shell distortion and elongation of the limbs and neck in saddlebacks is probably an evolutionary compromise between the need for a small body size in dry conditions and a high vertical reach for dominance displays.&lt;ref name='Fritts 1984'/&gt;

The saddleback carapace probably evolved independently several times in dry habitats,&lt;ref name='I. Bowman, M. Berson p. 107'/&gt; since genetic similarity between populations does not correspond to carapace shape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Marlow|first=Ronald William |author2=Patton, James L.|year=1981|title=Biochemical relationships of the Galápagos giant tortoises (''Geochelone elephantopus'')|doi=10.1111/j.1469-7998.1981.tb03474.x |journal=Journal of Zoology |volume=195 |issue=3 |pages=413–422}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saddleback tortoises are, therefore, not necessarily more closely related to each other than to their domed counterparts, as shape is not determined by a similar genetic background, but by a similar ecological one.&lt;ref name='Fritts 1984'/&gt;

; Sexual dimorphism

[[Sexual dimorphism]] is most pronounced in saddleback populations in which males have more angled and higher front openings, giving a more extreme saddled appearance.&lt;ref name='Schafer and Krekorian 1983'/&gt; Males of all varieties generally have longer tails and shorter, concave [[Turtle shell#Plastron|plastrons]] with thickened knobs at the back edge to facilitate mating. Males are larger than females&amp;nbsp;— adult males weigh around {{convert|272|–|317|kg|abbr=on}} while females are {{convert|136|–|181|kg|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name='Fritts 1984'&gt;{{cite journal| last =Fritts|first =Thomas H.|year=1984|title=Evolutionary divergence of giant tortoises in Galapagos|journal=Biological Journal of the Linnean Society|volume= 21|issue=1–2|pages=165–176|doi=10.1111/j.1095-8312.1984.tb02059.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Behavior==
[[File:Galapagos tortoise bathing.jpg|thumb|alt=A tortoise somewhat submerged in a green outdoor pool full of algae|A tortoise bathing in a pool]]

===Routine===
The tortoises are [[ectotherm]]ic (cold-blooded), so bask for 1–2 hours after dawn to absorb the sun's heat through their dark shells before actively foraging for 8–9 hours a day.&lt;ref name='Swingland 1989'&gt;Swingland, I.R. (1989). Geochelone elephantopus. ''Galapagos giant tortoises.'' In: Swingland I.R. and Klemens M.W. (eds.) ''The conservation biology of tortoises.'' Occasional Papers of the IUCN Species Survival Commission (SSC), No. 5, pp. 24–28. Gland, Switzerland: IUCN. {{ISBN|2-88032-986-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; They travel mostly in the early morning or late afternoon between resting and grazing areas. They have been observed to walk at a speed of {{convert|0.3|km/h|1|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name='D1839'/&gt;

On the larger and more humid islands, the tortoises seasonally migrate between low elevations, which become grassy plains in the wet season, and meadowed areas of higher elevation (up to {{convert|2,000|ft|m|abbr=on}}&lt;ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'/&gt;) in the dry season. The same routes have been used for many generations, creating well-defined paths through the undergrowth known as "tortoise highways".&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/&gt; On these wetter islands, the domed tortoises are gregarious and often found in large herds, in contrast to the more solitary and territorial disposition of the saddleback tortoises.

Tortoises sometimes rest in mud wallows or rain-formed pools, which may be both a [[Thermoregulation|thermoregulatory]] response during cool nights, and a protection from [[Parasitism|parasites]] such as mosquitoes and ticks.&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/&gt; Parasites are countered by taking dust baths in loose soil. Some tortoises have been noted to shelter at night under overhanging rocks.&lt;ref name='Carpenter 1966'&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carpenter|first=Charles C.|year=1966|title=Notes on the behavior and ecology of the Galapagos tortoise on Santa Cruz island|journal=Proceedings of the Oklahoma Academy of Science|volume=46|pages=28–32}}&lt;/ref&gt; &amp;nbsp;- others have been observed sleeping in a snug depression in the earth or brush called a "pallet". Local tortoises using the same pallet sites, such as on Volcán Alcedo, results in the formation of small, sandy pits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Galápagos, a natural history|first=M.H.|last=Jackson|publisher=University of Calgary Press|year=1993|page=107|isbn=1-895176-07-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diet===
[[File:Galapagos giant tortoise feeding.jpg|right|thumb|left|alt=An adult tortoise with a mouthful of green leaves.|A tortoise feeding]]
The tortoises are [[herbivore]]s that consume a diet of cacti, grasses, leaves, lichens, berries, melons, oranges, and milkweed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Daggett|first=Frank S. |date=1915-01-01 |title=A Galapagos Tortoise |jstor=1640003 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=42|issue=1096|pages=933–934 |doi=10.1126/science.42.1096.933-a|bibcode=1915Sci....42..933D}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been documented feeding on ''[[Manchineel tree|Hippomane mancinella]]'' ('poison apple'), the endemic [[guava]] ''Psidium galapageium'', the [[Mosquito fern|water fern]] ''Azolla microphylla'', and the [[Tillandsia|bromeliad]] ''Tillandsia insularis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Cayot|first=Linda Jean |year=1987 |title=Ecology of giant tortoises (''Geochelone elephantopus'') in the Galápagos Islands |degree=Ph.D. |publisher=[[Syracuse University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Juvenile tortoises eat an average of 16.7% of their own body weight in dry matter per day, with a digestive efficiency roughly equal to that of hindgut-fermenting herbivorous mammals such as horses and rhinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hatt|first=Jean-Michel|author2=Class, Marcus |author3=Gisler, Ricarda |author4=Liesegang, Annette |author5= Wanner, Marcel |year=2005|title=Fiber digestibility in juvenile Galapagos tortoises (''Geochelone nigra'') and implications for the development of captive animals |journal=Zoo Biology|volume=24|issue=2|pages=185–191|doi=10.1002/zoo.20039}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tortoises acquire most of their moisture from the dew and sap in vegetation (particularly the ''[[Opuntia]]'' cactus); therefore, they can survive longer than 6 months without water. They can endure up to a year when deprived of all food and water,&lt;ref name='Porter 1815'&gt;{{cite book|last=Porter|first=David|year=1815|title=Journal of the cruise made to the Pacific Ocean by Captain Porter in the United States Frigate Essex in the years 1812, 1813, 1814|location=New York |page=151 |publisher=Wiley &amp; Halsted |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IiYFAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA151}}&lt;/ref&gt; surviving by breaking down their body fat to produce water as a byproduct. Tortoises also have very slow metabolisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/galapagos-tortoise/|title=Galapagos Tortoises, Galapagos Tortoise Pictures, Galapagos Tortoise Facts – National Geographic|author=National Geographic Society|work=National Geographic}}&lt;/ref&gt; When thirsty, they may drink large quantities of water very quickly, storing it in their bladders and the "root of the neck" (the [[pericardium]]&lt;ref name='Swingland 1989'/&gt;), both of which served to make them useful water sources on ships.&lt;ref name='Porter 1815'/&gt; On arid islands, tortoises lick morning dew from boulders, and the repeated action over many generations has formed half-sphere depressions in the rock.&lt;ref name='Swingland 1989'/&gt;

===Senses===
Regarding their senses, Charles Darwin observed, "The inhabitants believe that these animals are absolutely deaf; certainly they do not overhear a person walking near behind them. I was always amused, when overtaking one of these great monsters as it was quietly pacing along, to see how suddenly, the instant I passed, it would draw in its head and legs, and uttering a deep hiss fall to the ground with a heavy sound, as if struck dead."&lt;ref name='D1839'/&gt; Although they are not deaf,&lt;ref name='Van Denburgh 1914'/&gt; tortoises depend far more on vision and smell as stimuli than hearing.&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/&gt;

===Mutualism===
Tortoises share a [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] relationship with some species of [[Darwin's finches|Galápagos finch]] and mockingbirds. Small groups of finches initiate the process by hopping on the ground in an exaggerated fashion facing the tortoise. The tortoise signals it is ready by rising up and extending its neck and legs, enabling the birds to reach otherwise inaccessible spots on the tortoise's body such as the neck, rear legs, [[cloaca]]l opening, and skin between plastron and carapace. The birds benefit from the food source and the tortoises get rid of irritating [[ectoparasite]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=MacFarland |first=Craig G. |author2=Reeder, W.G. |year=1974 |title=Cleaning symbiosis involving Galápagos tortoises and two species of Darwin's finches|journal=Zeitschrift für Tierpsychologie |volume=34 |pages=464–483 |doi=10.1111/j.1439-0310.1974.tb01816.x |issue=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some tortoises have been observed to insidiously exploit this mutualistic relationship. After rising and extending its limbs, the bird may go beneath the tortoise to investigate, whereupon suddenly the tortoise withdraws its limbs to drop flat and kill the bird. It then steps back to eat the bird, presumably to supplement its diet with protein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bonin|first= Franck|author2=Devaux, Bernard |author3=Dupré, Alain  |year=2006 |title=Turtles of the world |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |location=Baltimore |isbn=0-8018-8496-9|others=Pritchard, Peter Charles Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Galapagos dominance display.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Two tortoises with their necks extended|A pair of tortoises engaging in a dominance display]]

===Mating===
[[Mating]] occurs at any time of the year, although it does have seasonal peaks between February and June in the humid uplands during the rainy season.&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/&gt; When mature males meet in the mating season, they face each other in a ritualised dominance display, rise up on their legs, and stretch up their necks with their mouths gaping open. Occasionally, head-biting occurs, but usually the shorter tortoise backs off, conceding mating rights to the victor. The behaviour is most pronounced in saddleback species, which are more aggressive and have longer necks.&lt;ref name='Schafer and Krekorian 1983'/&gt;

The prelude to mating can be very aggressive, as the male forcefully rams the female's shell with his own and nips her legs.&lt;ref name="DS1930"/&gt; Mounting is an awkward process and the male must stretch and tense to maintain equilibrium in a slanting position. The concave underside of the male's shell helps him to balance when straddled over the female's shell, and brings his cloacal vent (which houses the penis) closer to the female's dilated cloaca. During mating, the male vocalises with hoarse bellows and grunts,&lt;ref name='Carpenter 1966'/&gt; described as "rhythmic groans".&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/&gt; This is one of the few vocalisations the tortoise makes; other noises are made during aggressive encounters, when struggling to right themselves, and hissing as they withdraw into their shells due to the forceful expulsion of air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hayes|first=Floyd E.|author2=Beaman, Kent R.

The width of the tortoise is only marginally wider than the egg.|A young tortoise and a tortoise egg]]

===Egg-laying===
Females journey up to several kilometres in July to November to reach nesting areas of dry, sandy coast. Nest digging is a tiring and elaborate task which may take the female several hours a day over many days to complete.&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/&gt; It is carried out blindly using only the hind legs to dig a {{convert|30|cm|adj=on|abbr=on}}-deep cylindrical hole, in which the tortoise then lays up to 16 spherical, hard-shelled eggs ranging from {{convert|82|to|157|g}} in mass,&lt;ref name='Swingland 1989'/&gt; and the size of a billiard ball.&lt;ref name='MacFarland 1972'/&gt; Some observations suggest that the average [[clutch (eggs)|clutch]] size for domed populations (9.6&amp;nbsp;per clutch for ''C. porteri'' on Santa Cruz) is larger than that of saddlebacks (4.6&amp;nbsp;per clutch for ''C. duncanensis'' on Pinzón).&lt;ref name='MacFarland 1974'/&gt; The female makes a muddy plug for the nest hole out of soil mixed with urine, seals the nest by pressing down firmly with her plastron, and leaves them to be incubated by the sun. Females may lay one to four clutches per season. [[Temperature-dependent sex determination|Temperature plays a role in the sex of the hatchlings]], with lower-temperature nests producing more males and higher-temperature nests producing more females. This is related closely to incubation time, since clutches laid early incubate during the cool season and have longer incubation periods (producing more males), while eggs laid later incubate for a shorter period in the hot season (producing more females).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ciofi |first=Claudio |author2=Swingland, Ian R. |year=1995 |title=Environmental sex determination in reptiles |doi=10.1016/S0168-1591(96)01108-2 |journal=Applied Animal Behaviour Science |volume=51 |issue=3 |pages=251–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life and maturation===
Young animals emerge from the nest after four to eight months and may weigh only {{convert|50|g|abbr=on}} and measure {{convert|6|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name='R. Perry pp. 145'/&gt; When the young tortoises emerge from their shells, they must dig their way to the surface, which can take several weeks, though their yolk sac can sustain them up to seven months.&lt;ref name='MacFarland 1972'/&gt; In particularly dry conditions, the hatchlings may die underground if they are encased by hardened soil, while flooding of the nest area can drown them. Species are initially indistinguishable as they all have domed carapaces. The young stay in warmer lowland areas for their first 10–15 years,&lt;ref name='Swingland 1989'/&gt; encountering hazards such as falling into cracks, being crushed by falling rocks, or excessive heat stress. The [[Galápagos hawk]] was formerly the sole native predator of the tortoise hatchlings;  Darwin wrote: "The young tortoises, as soon as they are hatched, fall prey in great numbers to the buzzard".&lt;ref name='D1839'/&gt; The hawk is now much rarer, but introduced feral pigs, dogs, cats, and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises.&lt;ref name='Cayot 1994'/&gt; The adult tortoises have no natural predators apart from humans; Darwin noted: "The old ones seem generally to die from accidents, as from falling down precipices. At least several of the inhabitants told me, they had never found one dead without some such apparent cause".&lt;ref name='D1839'/&gt;

[[Sexual maturity]] is reached at around 20–25&amp;nbsp;years in captivity, possibly 40&amp;nbsp;years in the wild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/galapagos_tortoise/tortoise.htm#repro |title=Galapagos Tortoise, ''Chelonoidis nigra'' |date=May 2010 |publisher=[[San Diego Zoo]] |accessdate=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy in the wild is thought to be over 100&amp;nbsp;years,&lt;ref name="NatGeo"&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |url=http://animals.nationalgeographic.com/animals/reptiles/galapagos-tortoise/ |title=Galápagos tortoise ''Geochelone elephantophus''

Darwin wrote in his account of the voyage:

The significance of the differences in tortoises between islands did not strike him as important until it was too late, as he continued,
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I did not for some time pay sufficient attention to this statement, and I had already partially mingled together the collections from two of the islands. I never dreamed that islands, about fifty or sixty miles apart, and most of them in sight of each other, formed of precisely the same rocks, placed under a quite similar climate, rising to a nearly equal height, would have been differently tenanted".&lt;ref name='Darwin p393'/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though the ''Beagle'' departed from the Galápagos with over 30 adult tortoises on deck, these were not for scientific study, but a source of fresh meat for the Pacific crossing. Their shells and bones were thrown overboard, leaving no remains with which to test any hypotheses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=51}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Nicholls|2006||p=62}}&lt;/ref&gt; that this oversight was made because Darwin only reported seeing tortoises on San Cristóbal&lt;ref name='D456'&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1839|p=456}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''C. chathamensis'') and Santiago&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F1925&amp;pageseq=394 |last=Keynes |first=R.D. |year=2001 |title=Charles Darwin's Beagle diary |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-00317-2 |page=362}}&lt;/ref&gt; (''C. darwini''), both of which have an intermediate type of shell shape and are not particularly morphologically distinct from each other. Though he did visit Floreana, the ''C. nigra'' species found there was already nearly extinct and he was unlikely to have seen any mature animals.&lt;ref name=sulloway/&gt;

[[File:HMS Beagle 1832 longitudinal section larger.jpg|thumb|Line drawing of the HMS ''Beagle'' by F. G. King, a colleague of Darwin's: Galápagos tortoises were stacked in the lower hold.]]
However, Darwin did have four live juvenile specimens to compare from different islands. These were pet tortoises taken by himself (from San Salvador), his captain [[Robert FitzRoy|FitzRoy]] (two from Española) and his servant [[Syms Covington]] (from Floreana).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, they could not help to determine whether each island had its own variety because the specimens were not mature enough to exhibit morphological differences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the British Museum had a few specimens, their provenance within the Galápagos was unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Günther|1877|p=62 for example}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, conversations with the naturalist [[Gabriel Bibron]], who had seen the mature tortoises of the Paris Natural History Museum confirmed to Darwin that distinct varieties occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR118.-&amp;pageseq=41 |last=Darwin|first=C.

Darwin later compared the different tortoise forms with those of [[mockingbird]]s, in the first&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; tentative statement linking his observations from the Galapagos with the possibility of species transmuting:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"When I recollect the fact that [from] the form of the body, shape of scales and general size, the Spaniards can at once pronounce from which island any tortoise may have been brought; when I see these islands in sight of each other and possessed of but a scanty stock of animals, tenanted by these birds, but slightly differing in structure and filling the same place in nature; I must suspect they are only varieties&amp;nbsp;... If there is the slightest foundation for these remarks, the zoology of archipelagos will be well worth examining; for such facts would undermine the stability of species."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=F1577&amp;pageseq=64|last=Barlow|first=N.|year=1963|title=Darwin's ornithological notes|journal=Bulletin of the British Museum (Natural History). Historical Series|volume=2|issue=7|page=262}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His views on the mutability of species were restated in his notebooks: "animals on separate islands ought to become different if kept long enough apart with slightly differing circumstances.&amp;nbsp;– Now Galapagos Tortoises, Mocking birds, Falkland Fox, Chiloe fox,&amp;nbsp;– Inglish and Irish Hare."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://darwin-online.org.uk/content/frameset?viewtype=side&amp;itemID=CUL-DAR121.-&amp;pageseq=9|last=Darwin|first=C.R.|year=1837–1838|title=Notebook B: &lt;nowiki&gt;[Transmutation of species]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These observations served as counterexamples to the prevailing contemporary view that species were individually created.

Darwin also found these "antediluvian animals"&lt;ref name='D456'/&gt; to be a source of diversion: "I frequently got on their backs, and then giving a few raps on the hinder part of their shells, they would rise up and walk away;—but I found it very difficult to keep my balance".&lt;ref name='D1839'/&gt;

==Conservation==
Several waves of human exploitation of the tortoises as a food source caused a decline in the total wild population from around 250,000&lt;ref name="amnh.org"/&gt; when first discovered in the 16th century to a low of 3,060 individuals in a 1974 census. Modern conservation efforts have subsequently brought tortoise numbers up to 19,317 (estimate for 1995–2009).&lt;ref name='galapagospark.org'&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagospark.org/nophprg.php?page=parque_nacional_nativas_endemicas_tortugas |publisher=Galapagos National Park |title=Reproduction, breeding, repatriation, and monitoring of tortoises |date=29 June 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The species ''C. nigra'' became extinct by human exploitation in the 19th century. Another species, ''C. abingdonii'', became extinct on 24 June 2012 with the death in captivity of the last remaining specimen, a male named Lonesome George, the world's "rarest living creature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Footman |first=T. |year=2000 |title=Guinness World Records 2001 |publisher=Guinness Records |isbn=0-85112-102-0 |page=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; All the other surviving species are listed by the IUCN as at least "Vulnerable" in conservation status, if not worse.

===Historical exploitation===
An estimated 200,000 animals were taken before the 20th century.&lt;ref name='Swingland 1989'/&gt; The relatively immobile and defenceless tortoises were collected and stored live on board ships, where they could survive for at least a year without food or water (some anecdotal reports suggest individuals surviving two years&lt;ref name='Townsend 1925'/&gt;), providing valuable fresh meat, while their diluted urine and the water stored in their neck bags could be used as drinking water. The 17th-century British pirate, explorer, and naturalist [[William Dampier]] wrote, "They are so extraordinarily large and fat, and so sweet, that no pullet eats more pleasantly,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dampier|first=William|year=2007|origyear=1697|title=A new voyage around the world|publisher=Dover Publications|location=Dampier|chapter=Chapter 5|url=http://www.galapagos.to/TEXTS/DAMPIER-1.HTM#galapagos|isbn=978-1-933698-04-5|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101127004430/http://www.galapagos.to/TEXTS/DAMPIER-1.HTM#galapagos|archivedate=27 November 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Captain [[James Colnett]] of the British Navy wrote of "the land tortoise which in whatever way it was dressed, was considered by all of us as the most delicious food we had ever tasted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Colnett|first=J. |origyear=1798 |title=A voyage to the south Atlantic |year=1968 |page=158 |url=https://archive.org/stream/cihm_33242#page/n195/mode/2up |publisher=Da Capo Press |location=USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; US Navy captain [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]] declared, "after once tasting the Galapagos tortoises, every other animal food fell off greatly in our estimation&amp;nbsp;... The meat of this animal is the easiest of digestion, and a quantity of it, exceeding that of any other food, can be eaten without experiencing the slightest of inconvenience."&lt;ref name='Porter 1815'/&gt; Darwin was less enthusiastic about the meat, writing "the breast-plate roasted (as the Gauchos do "carne con cuero"), with the flesh on it, is very good; and the young tortoises make excellent soup; but otherwise the meat to my taste is indifferent."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Darwin|1839|p=459}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 17th century, [[pirate]]s started to use the Galápagos Islands as a base for resupply, restocking on food and water, and repairing vessels before attacking [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonies]] on the South American mainland. However, the Galápagos tortoises did not struggle for survival at this point because the islands were distant from busy shipping routes and harboured few valuable natural resources. As such, they remained unclaimed by any nation, uninhabited and uncharted. In comparison, the tortoises of the islands in the Indian Ocean were already facing extinction by the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between the 1790s and the 1860s, [[whaling]] ships and [[Fur seal#Exploitation|fur sealers]] systematically collected tortoises in far greater numbers than the buccaneers preceding them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some were used for food and many more were killed for high-grade "turtle oil" from the late 19th century onward for lucrative sale to continental Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Beck, RH. |year=1903 |title=In the home of the giant tortoise |journal=7th Annual Report of the New York Zoological Society |location=New York |pages=1–17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A total of over 13,000 tortoises is recorded in the logs of whaling ships between 1831 and 1868, and an estimated 100,000 were taken before 1830.&lt;ref name="Townsend 1925"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Townsend|first=Charles Haskins|year= 1925|title=The Galapagos tortoises in their relation to the whaling industry: a study of old logbooks|url=http://mysite.du.edu/~ttyler/ploughboy/townsendgaltort.htm|journal= Zoologica|volume=4|pages=55–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since it was easiest to collect tortoises around coastal zones, females were most vulnerable to depletion during the nesting season. The collection by whalers came to a halt eventually through a combination of the scarcity of tortoises that they had created and the competition from crude oil as a cheaper energy source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Chambers|2004|p=104}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Galápagos tortoise exploitation dramatically increased with the onset of the California Gold Rush in 1849.&lt;ref name="Conrad and Pastron 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1 = Conrad | first1 = Cyler | last2 = Pastron | first2 = Allen | year= 2014 | title=Galapagos Tortoises and Sea Turtles in Gold Rush-Era California | url=http://ch.ucpress.edu/content/91/2/20|journal= California History | volume=91 | issue=2 | pages=20–39 | doi=10.1525/ch.2014.91.2.20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tortoises and sea turtles were imported into San Francisco, Sacramento and various other Gold Rush towns throughout Alta California to feed the gold mining population.

Population decline accelerated with the early settlement of the islands in the early 19th century, leading to unregulated hunting for meat, habitat clearance for agriculture, and the introduction of alien mammal species.&lt;ref name='MacFarland 1974'/&gt; Feral pigs, dogs, cats, and black rats have become predators of eggs and young tortoises, whilst goats, donkeys, and cattle compete for grazing and trample nest sites. The extinction of the Floreana species in the mid-19th century has been attributed to the combined pressures of hunting for the penal colony on the relatively small island, the conversion of the grazing highlands into land for farming and fruit plantations, and the introduction of feral mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoeck |first=H.N.|year=1984 |chapter=Introduced fauna |editor-last=Perry |editor-first=R |title=Key environments.

Scientific collection expeditions took 661 tortoises between 1888 and 1930, and more than 120 tortoises have been taken by poachers since 1990. Threats continue today with the rapid expansion of the tourist industry and increasing size of human settlements on the islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Watkins |first=Graham |author2=Cruz, Felipe |year=2007 |title=Galapagos at risk: a socioeconomic analysis |url=http://www.darwinfoundation.org/english/_upload/Galapagos_At-Risk-2007.pdf |publisher=Charles Darwin Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926090022/http://darwinfoundation.org/english/_upload/Galapagos_At-Risk-2007.pdf |archivedate=26 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tortoises are down from 15 different types of species when Darwin first arrived down to 11.&lt;ref name="Galapagos Tortoise Fact Sheet"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://library.sandiegozoo.org/factsheets/galapagos_tortoise/tortoise.htm|title=Galapagos Tortoise Fact Sheet|website=library.sandiegozoo.org|access-date=2016-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tortoises of the Galápagos’ island were not only hunted for the oil that they held for fuel but also once they were becoming more and more extinct people began to pay to have them in their collections, as well as being put into museums.&lt;ref name="nance2015"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Historical Animal |editor-last=Nance|editor-first=Susan |last1=Foote |first1=Nicola |last2=Gunnels |first2=Charles W.

The remaining species of tortoise range in IUCN classification from [[extinct in the wild]] to [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Slow growth rate, late sexual maturity, and island endemism make the tortoises particularly prone to extinction without help from conservationists.&lt;ref name='Chiari 2009'/&gt; The Galápagos giant tortoise has become a [[flagship species]] for conservation efforts throughout the Galápagos.

;Legal protection
The Galápagos giant tortoise is now strictly protected and is listed on Appendix I of the [[CITES|Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora]].&lt;ref name='CITES Appendices I, II and III 2011'/&gt; The listing requires that trade in the [[taxon]] and its products is subject to strict regulation by ratifying states, and international trade for primarily commercial purposes is prohibited. In 1936, the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species. In 1959, it declared all uninhabited areas in the Galápagos to be a [[national park]]&lt;ref&gt;Ecuador (1959). ''Decreto ley de emergencia, por el cual se declaran parques nacionales de reserva de exclusivo dominio del estado, para la preservación de la fauna y flora, todas las tierras que forman las islas del Archipiélago de Colón o Galápagos, Registro Oficial No. 873 (1959) Quito, 20 de Julio, 1959'' {{es}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and established the [[Charles Darwin Foundation]]. In 1970, capturing or removing many species from the islands (including tortoises and their eggs) was banned.&lt;ref&gt;Ecuador (1970). ''Ley de Protección de la Fauna Silvestre y de los Recursos Ictiológicos, Registro Oficial No. 104 (1970) Quito, 20 de Noviembre 1970'' {{es}}.&lt;/ref&gt; To halt trade in the tortoises altogether, it became illegal to export the tortoises from Ecuador, captive or wild, continental, or insular in provenance. The banning of their exportation resulted in automatic prohibition of importation to the United States under Public Law 91-135 (1969).&lt;ref&gt;United States 1969. ''Endangered Species Conservation Act.'' 83 Stat. 275; 16 USC 668 cc-1 to 668 cc-6 (1969)&lt;/ref&gt; A 1971 Ecuadorian decree made it illegal to damage, remove, alter, or disturb any organism, rock, or other natural object in the National Park.&lt;ref&gt;Ecuador (1971). ''Decreto Supremo No. 1306 (1971) Quito, 27 de Agosto 1971'' {{es}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

;Captive breeding

With the establishment of the Galapagos National Park and the CDF in 1959, a review of the status of the tortoise populations began. Only 11 of the 14 original populations remained and most of these were endangered if not already on the brink of extinction. The breeding and rearing program for giant tortoises began in response to the condition of the population on Pinzón, where fewer than 200 old adults were found. All of the hatchlings had been killed by introduced black rats, for perhaps more than a century. Without help, this population would eventually disappear. The only thing preserving it was the longevity of the tortoise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cayot |first=Linda J |title=The Restoration of Giant Tortoise and Land Iguana Populations in Galapagos |date=December 2008 |journal=Galapagos Research |issue=65 |pp=39–43 |publisher=[[Charles Darwin Foundation]] |url=http://aquaticcommons.org/21321/ |access-date=2016-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its genetic resistance to the negative effects of [[inbreeding]] would be another.&lt;ref name="nance2015" /&gt;

Breeding and release programs began in 1965 and have successfully brought seven of the eight endangered species up to less perilous population levels. Young tortoises are raised at several breeding centres across the islands to improve their survival during their vulnerable early development. Eggs are collected from threatened nesting sites, and the hatched young are given a head start by being kept in captivity for four to five years to reach a size with a much better chance of survival to adulthood, before release onto their native ranges.&lt;ref name='Cayot 1994'&gt;{{cite book|last=Cayot |first=Linda J |year=1994 |title=Captive management and conservation of amphibians and reptiles |pages=297–305 |location=[[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]] |publisher=Society for the Study of Amphibians and Reptiles |journal=Contributions to Herpetology |volume=11 |isbn=0-916984-33-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="galapagospark.org"/&gt;

The most significant population recovery was that of the Española tortoise (''C. hoodensis''), which was saved from near-certain extinction.

;Island restoration
The Galápagos National Park Service systematically [[culling|culls]] feral predators and competitors. Goat eradication on islands, including Pinta, was achieved by the technique of using "Judas" goats with radio location collars to find the herds. Marksmen then shot all the goats except the Judas, and then returned weeks later to find the "Judas" and shoot the herd to which it had relocated. Goats were removed from Pinta Island after a 30-year eradication campaign, the largest removal of an insular goat population using ground-based methods. Over 41,000 goats were removed during the initial hunting effort (1971–82).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Campbell|first1=Karl |last2=Donlan|first2=C.

Efforts are now underway to repopulate islands formerly inhabited by tortoises to restore their ecosystems ([[island restoration]]) to their condition before humans arrived. The tortoises are a [[keystone species]], acting as [[ecosystem engineer]]s&lt;ref name='guardian.co.uk'/&gt; which help in plant [[seed dispersal]] and trampling down brush and thinning the understory of vegetation (allowing light to penetrate and germination to occur). Birds such as [[Galapagos flycatcher|flycatcher]]s perch on and fly around tortoises to hunt the insects they displace from the brush.&lt;ref name='MacFarland 1972'/&gt; In May 2010, 39 sterilised tortoises of hybrid origin were introduced to Pinta Island, the first tortoises there since the evacuation of Lonesome George 38 years before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.galapagos.org/2008/index.php?id=68 |publisher=Galapagos Conservancy |title=Project Pinta: Restoration of Lonesome George's Birthplace |accessdate=2012-01-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110724015235/http://www.galapagos.org/2008/index.php?id=68 |archivedate=24 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sterile tortoises were released so the problem of interbreeding between species would be avoided if any fertile tortoises were to be released in the future. It is hoped that with the recent identification of a hybrid ''C. abingdonii'' tortoise, the approximate genetic constitution of the original inhabitants of Pinta may eventually be restored with the identification and relocation of appropriate specimens to this island.&lt;ref name='Russello 2007'/&gt; This approach may be used to "retortoise" Floreana in the future, since captive individuals have been found to be descended from the extinct original stock.&lt;ref name='Russello 2010'/&gt;

;Applied science

The Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme is a collaborative project coordinated by Dr Stephen Blake of the Max Planck Institute for Ornithology. Its goal is to assist the Galapagos National Park to effectively conserve giant tortoises by conducting cutting-edge applied science, and developing an inspirational tortoise-based outreach and education programme. Since 2009, the project team have been analysing the movements of giant tortoises by tracking them via satellite tags. As of November 2014, the team have tagged 83 tortoises from four species on three islands. They have established that giant tortoises conduct migrations up and down volcanoes, primarily in response to seasonal changes in the availability and quality of vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gianttortoise.org/tortoise_site_oct_2013_004.htm |publisher=Galapagos Tortoise Movement Ecology Programme |title=GTMEP: What We Do |accessdate=2014-12-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150210061653/http://gianttortoise.org/tortoise_site_oct_2013_004.htm |archivedate=10 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 they will start to track the movements of hatchling and juvenile tortoises, supported by the UK's [[Galapagos Conservation Trust]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://galapagosconservation.org.uk/ |publisher= &lt;!-- Galapagos Conservation Trust --&gt; |title= Galapagos Conservation Trust |accessdate=2014-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Heatwave''' is a [[comic book]] character from [[Top Cow Productions]]. He was also a member of the [[Cyberforce (Image Comics)|Cyberforce]].

==Fictional character biography==
Heatwave was a cybernetically-enhanced mutant, with the power to absorb and release ambient solar energy in the form of super-heated plasma. It was specially difficult for him when his powers first began to manifest because they led to a tragic incident when he accidentally killed his brother—something Heatwave was never able to come to terms with. His brother's death had such a devastating effect on the family that he chose to leave home and enroll in naval training school, rather than endure their accusing eyes anymore. He graduated with honors, got married, joined the Navy and eventually became one of the elite SEAL team. Tragedy struck once again shortly thereafter when his daughter was killed during a terrorist attack. His marriage soon fell apart, and his performance level dropped so low that he caused serious injury to himself and those under his command during a high-risk rescue operation. He felt that he had finally hit bottom; that's when Cyberdata showed up. They promised to heal him and provide him with a special suit. In return, he needed to supply them with his tremendous power for various combat operations. All he had to do was follow orders, with the help of a "brain box" in his head. He then became a S.H.O.C. and did Cyberdata's evil bidding, until the benign [[Dr. Corben]] removed the brain box from his head and showed Heatwave the error of his ways. He then teamed up with Corben, as well as former S.H.O.C.s [[Morgan Stryker|Stryker]] and [[Cyblade]], to form [[Cyberforce (Image Comics)|Cyberforce]].

At one point, Heatwave became aware of a reality disruption that was threatening to isolate many superpowered beings from each other. He was in favor of that, for it would leave Cyberforce with less enemies to fight. [[Velocity]] and [[Ripclaw]] rebelled against this, for the disruption would also isolate them from many dear friends.&lt;ref&gt;"Shattered Image" #2 (October 1996)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Devil’s Reign===
When the demon [[Mephisto (comics)|Mephisto]] invaded from the [[Marvel Universe]], he abducted Heatwave and brainwashed him into acting as his lieutenant.&lt;ref&gt;Cyblade / Ghost Rider #1: Devil's Reign: Chapter Two&lt;/ref&gt; He was entrusted with overseeing the enforced hedonism as the 'Mayor' in New York and the 'Fire King' in Las Vegas.&lt;ref&gt;Ballistic / Wolverine #1: Devil's Reign – Chapter Four&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elektra / Cyblade #1: Devil's Reign – Chapter Seven&lt;/ref&gt; However, Cyblade talked him into his senses and he turned against Mephisto, sacrificing his life to thwart the demon’s plans.&lt;ref&gt;Silver Surfer / Weapon Zero #1: Devil's Reign – Chapter Eight&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rising From the Ashes===
A copy of Heatwave was created by technology from a crashed alien ship. Through this ship, he was made aware of the threat posed by another alien ship approaching Earth. He went to Cyberforce’s part-completed backup base on [[Mikquit Island]] in [[Long Island Sound]] in order to make it ready to repel the aliens, and had the work completed by the time Ripclaw, Velocity, [[Ballistic (Image Comics)|Ballistic]] and Cyblade arrived with the same aim.&lt;ref&gt;Cyberforce volume 3 issue 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cyberforce/Hunter-Killer===
During the initial skirmish when the [[Hunter-Killer (comics)|Hunter-Killer]] team attacked Long Island, Heatwave took a blast from [[Samantha Argent]]’s bioelectric powers.&lt;ref&gt;Cyberforce/Hunter-Killer #1&lt;/ref&gt; The damage to his suit left him vulnerable to being burnt up by his own powers, until the suit was repaired by [[Architect (Top Cow comics)|Architect]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyberforce/Hunter-Killer #2&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Ellis (comics)|Ellis]] offered to stay with Cyberforce and safeguard against Velocity’s new [[Ultra-Sapien]] powers, Heatwave decided to join the Hunter-Killer team. He did this partly because he did not fully trust them, but also because he felt he had a diminished role within Cyberforce since his resurrection, as Cyblade had stepped up as leader in his absence.&lt;ref&gt;Cyberforce/Hunter-Killer #5&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Heatwave was a cybernetically enhanced mutant who was able to absorb and retain ambient [[solar energy]]. He wore a specially designed suit that was built for him by Cyberdata that allowed him to regulate this energy and release it as a forced beam of super-heated sub-atomic particles called [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. This plasma could then be used as a weapon or as a means of self-propelled flight. Heatwave could project a plasma beam and fly at high speed by riding super-heated air currents. Heatwave did not need the suit to absorb and release energy. His mutant metabolism enabled him to do this on his own. The suit made him much more efficient and magnified his powers considerably. Without it, though, he had to be extremely careful of the amount of energy he absorbed because his body would eventually be consumed by the plasma heat.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8052">[[File:Journal.pgen.1002737.g001.png|thumb|Dynamic chromosome pairing. The term “pairing” describes the spatial juxtaposition of entire homologous chromosomes, allelic sequences, and/or homologous sequences at non-allelic locations. (A, B) Homologous chromosomes can exist as paired throughout their entire length and the relative activities of pairing and anti-pairing factors determine the degree of global chromosome pairing. (C) Local pairing and anti-pairing factors can affect pairing status of specific genes or chromosomal regions. Local “pairing centers” can nucleate global pairing, but it is unclear whether factors regulating local pairing are different from global pairing factors. (D–F) In some cases, centromeres or telomeres from homologs can pair or cluster with non-homologous chromosomes, while there is no pairing along chromosome arms]]

'''[[Somatic (biology)|Somatic]] pairing''' of [[homologous chromosome]]s is similar to pre- and early [[Meiosis|meiotic]] pairing (see article: [[Homologous chromosome#In meiosis]]), and has been observed in [[Diptera]]&lt;ref name="Metz1916"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Metz|first1=Charles W.|title=Chromosome studies on the Diptera.

Mammals show little pairing apart from in germline cells, taking place at specific loci, and under the control of developmental signalling (understood as a subset of other long-range interchromosomal interactions such as looping, and organisation into [[Chromosome territories|chromosomal territories]]).&lt;ref name="ApteMeller2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Apte|first1=Manasi S.|last2=Meller|first2=Victoria H.|title=Homologue Pairing in Flies and Mammals: Gene Regulation When Two Are Involved|journal=Genetics Research International|volume=2012|year=2012|pages=1–9|issn=2090-3154|doi=10.1155/2012/430587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While meiotic pairing has been extensively studied, the role of somatic pairing has remained less well understood, and even whether it is mechanistically related to meiotic pairing is unknown.&lt;ref name="CopenhaverBosco2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Copenhaver|first1=Gregory P.|last2=Bosco|first2=Giovanni|title=Chromosome Pairing: A Hidden Treasure No More|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=8|issue=5|year=2012|pages=e1002737|issn=1553-7404|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002737|pmid=22654678|pmc=3359980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early work==

The first review of somatic pairing was made by Metz in 1916,&lt;ref name="Metz1916"/&gt; citing the first descriptions of pairing made in 1907&lt;ref name="Stevens07"&gt;Stevens, N. M. (1907) The chromosomes of Drosophila ampelophila. Proc. VII Internat. Zool. Cong&lt;/ref&gt; and 1908 by [[Nettie Stevens|N. M. Stevens]] in germline cells, who noted:&lt;ref name="Stevens1908"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stevens|first1=N. M.|title=A study of the germ cells of certain diptera, with reference to the heterochromosomes and the phenomena of synapsis|journal=Journal of Experimental Zoology|volume=5|issue=3|year=1908|pages=359–374|issn=0022-104X|doi=10.1002/jez.1400050304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;“it may therefore be true that pairing of homologous chromosomes occurs in connection with each mitosis throughout the life history of these insects” (p.215)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Stevens noted the potential for communication and a role in heredity.&lt;ref name="Stevens1908"/&gt;

While meiotic homologous pairing subsequently became well studied, somatic pairing remained neglected due to what has been described as "''limitations in cytological tools for measuring pairing and genetic tools for perturbing pairing dynamics''".&lt;ref name="CopenhaverBosco2012"/&gt;

==Recent findings from high-throughput screening==

In 1998 it was determined that homologous pairing in ''Drosophila'' occurs through independent initiations (as opposed to a directed, 'processive zippering' motion).&lt;ref name="ApteMeller2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="FungMarshall1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fung|first1=Jennifer C.|last2=Marshall|first2=Wallace F.|last3=Dernburg|first3=Abby|last4=Agard|first4=David A.|last5=Sedat|first5=John W.|title=Homologous Chromosome Pairing inDrosophila melanogasterProceeds through Multiple Independent Initiations|journal=The Journal of Cell Biology|volume=141|issue=1|year=1998|pages=5–20|issn=0021-9525|doi=10.1083/jcb.141.1.5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[RNAi]] screen (based on [[Fluorescence in situ hybridization|DNA FISH]]&lt;ref name="GonzalezMateos-Langerak2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gonzalez|first1=Inma|last2=Mateos-Langerak|first2=Julio|last3=Thomas|first3=Aubin|last4=Cheutin|first4=Thierry|last5=Cavalli|first5=Giacomo|title=Identification of Regulators of the Three-Dimensional Polycomb Organization by a Microscopy-Based Genome-wide RNAi Screen|journal=Molecular Cell|volume=54|issue=3|year=2014|pages=485–499|issn=1097-2765|doi=10.1016/j.molcel.2014.03.004|pmid=24703951}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was carried out to identify genes regulating [[Drosophila melanogaster|''D. melanogaster'']] somatic pairing in 2012,&lt;ref name="HawleyJoyce2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Joyce|first1=Eric F.|last2=Williams|first2=Benjamin R.|last3=Xie|first3=Tiao|last4=Wu|first4=C.-ting|title=Identification of Genes That Promote or Antagonize Somatic Homolog Pairing Using a High-Throughput FISH–Based Screen|journal=PLoS Genetics|volume=8|issue=5|year=2012|pages=e1002667|issn=1553-7404|doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.1002667|pmid=22589731|pmc=3349724}}&lt;/ref&gt; described at the time as providing "an extensive “parts list” of mostly novel factors". These comprised 40 pairing promoting genes and 65 'anti-pairing' genes (of which 2 and 1 were already known, respectively), many of which have human [[Orthologous gene|orthologs]].&lt;ref name="CopenhaverBosco2012"/&gt;

An '''implantable cardioverter-defibrillator''' ('''ICD''') or automated implantable cardioverter defibrillator ('''AICD''') is a device [[implant (medicine)|implantable]] inside the body, able to perform [[cardioversion]], [[defibrillation]], and (in modern versions) [[cardiac pacing|pacing]] of the heart. The device is therefore capable of correcting most life-threatening cardiac arrhythmias. The ICD is the first-line treatment and prophylactic therapy for patients at risk for [[sudden cardiac death]] due to [[ventricular fibrillation]] and [[ventricular tachycardia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mirowski|first1=M|last2=Reid|first2=PR|last3=Mower|first3=MM|last4=Watkins|first4=L|last5=Gott|first5=VL|last6=Schauble|first6=JF|last7=Langer|first7=A|last8=Heilman|first8=MS|last9=Kolenik|first9=SA|last10=Fischell|first10=RE|last11=Weisfeldt|first11=ML|title=Termination of malignant ventricular arrhythmias with an implanted automatic defibrillator in human beings.|journal=The New England Journal of Medicine|date=7 August 1980|volume=303|issue=6|pages=322–4|pmid=6991948|doi=10.1056/nejm198008073030607}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current devices can be programmed to detect [[cardiac arrhythmia|abnormal heart rhythms]] and deliver therapy via programmable antitachycardia pacing in addition to low-energy and high-energy shocks.

"AICD" was trademarked by the Boston Scientific corporation, so the more generic "ICD" is preferred terminology.

Current device batteries last about 6–10 years,  With advances in the technology (batteries with more capacity or, potentially in the future with rechargeable batteries &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerworld.com/article/2492949/emerging-technology/power-play--wireless-charging-at-a-distance-arrives.html WiTriCity being looked at for use in pacemakers]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://qistandard.org/ Wireless Qi developed for use in pacemakers]&lt;/ref&gt;) it may be possible to increase this well past 10 years. The lead (the electrical cable connecting the device to the heart) has a much longer average longevity but can incur various types of malfunction, specifically insulation failure or fracture of the conductor and require replacement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://circ.ahajournals.org/content/123/11/e378.full Replacing of ICD and leads needs to be done every 5 to 10 years]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kleemann T1 Becker T, Doenges K, Vater M, Senges J, Schneider S, Saggau W, Weisse U, Seidl K | date = May 2007 | title = Annual rate of transvenous defibrillation lead defects in implantable cardioverter-defibrillators over a period of &gt;10 years | url = | journal = Circulation | volume = 115 | issue = 19| pages = 2474–80 | pmid = 17470696 | doi=10.1161/CIRCULATIONAHA.106.663807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of implantation of an ICD system is similar to implantation of a [[artificial pacemaker|pacemaker]]. In fact, ICDs are composed of an ICD generator and of wires. The first component or generator, contains a computer chip or circuitry with [[RAM]] (memory), programmable software, a [[capacitor]] and a battery; this is implanted typically under the skin in the left upper chest. The second part of the system is an [[electrode]] wire or wires that, similar to pacemakers, are connected to the generator and passed through a vein to the right chambers of the heart. The lead usually lodges in the apex or septum of the [[right ventricle]]. Just like pacemakers, ICDs can have a single wire or lead in the heart (in the right ventricle, single chamber ICD), two leads (in the right atrium and right ventricle, dual chamber ICD) or three leads (biventricular ICD, one in the right atrium, one in the right ventricle and one on the outer wall of the [[left ventricle]]). The difference between pacemakers and ICDs is that pacemakers are also available as temporary units and are generally designed to correct slow heart rates, i.e. [[bradycardia]], while ICDs are often permanent safeguards against sudden life-threatening arrhythmias.

Recent developments include the '''subcutaneous ICD''' ('''S-ICD'''), and the ability to pace the left ventricle from multiple sites near-simultaneously with Multipoint Pacing (Abbott). 

==Indications==
Implantation of ICD is meant to prevent [[sudden cardiac death]] and is indicated under various conditions. Two broad but distinct categories are primary and secondary prevention. Primary prevention refers to patients who have not suffered a life-threatening arrhythmia episode. Secondary prevention has the strongest evidence for benefit and it refers to survivors of cardiac arrest secondary to [[ventricular fibrillation]] or hemodynamically unstable sustained [[ventricular tachycardia]] after reversible causes are excluded.&lt;ref name="Cynthia M 2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tracy|first1=Cynthia M.|last2=Epstein|first2=Andrew E.|last3=Darbar|first3=Dawood|last4=DiMarco|first4=John P.|last5=Dunbar|first5=Sandra B.|last6=Estes|first6=N.A.

Similarly, ICD use in primary prevention is to prevent cardiac death in patients who are at risk for sustained ventricular tachycardia or ventricular fibrillation. This population accounts for the bulk of all ICD implants. There are a multitude of guideline indications for ICD use in primary preventions with varying degree of supporting evidence. Periodically, both the American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and European Society of Cardiology provide an update to this guideline. Some of the Class I indications are as follows:&lt;ref name="Cynthia M 2012"/&gt;

* With LVEF ≤ 35% due to prior Myocardial Infarction (MI) who are at least 40 days post-MI and are in NYHA Functional Class II or III
* With LV dysfunction due to prior MI who are at least 40 days post-MI, have an LVEF ≤ 30%, and are in NYHA Functional Class I
* With nonischemic DCM who have an LVEF ≤ 35% and who are in NYHA Functional Class II or III
* With nonsustained VT due to prior MI, LVEF &lt; 40%, and inducible VF or sustained VT at electrophysiological study
* With structural heart disease and spontaneous sustained VT, whether hemodynamically stable or unstable
* With syncope of undetermined origin with clinically relevant, hemodynamically significant sustained VT or VF induced at electrophysiological study

==Clinical trials==
A number of clinical trials have demonstrated the superiority of the ICD over AAD (antiarrhythmic drugs) in the prevention of death from malignant arrhythmias.
The SCD-HeFT trial (published in 2005) &lt;ref&gt;Bardy GH, Lee KL, Mark DB, Poole JE, Packer DL, Boineau R, Domanski M, Troutman C, Anderson J, Johnson G, McNulty SE, Clapp-Channing N, Davidson-Ray LD, Fraulo ES, Fishbein DP, Luceri RM, Ip JH; Sudden Cardiac Death in Heart Failure Trial (SCD-HeFT) Investigators. Amiodarone or an implantable cardioverter-defibrillator for congestive heart failure. N Engl J Med. 2005 Jan 20; 352(3):225–37.&lt;/ref&gt; showed a significant all-cause mortality benefit for patients with ICD. [[Congestive heart failure]] patients that were implanted with an ICD had an all-cause death risk 23% lower than placebo and an absolute decrease in mortality of 7.2 percentage points after five years in the overall population.&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;
Reporting in 1999, the ''Antiarrhythmics Versus Implantable Defibrillators'' (AVID) trial consisted of 1,016 patients, and deaths in those treated with AAD were more frequent (''n'' = 122) compared with deaths in the ICD groups (''n'' = 80, ''p'' &lt; 0.001).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Initially ICDs were implanted via thoracotomy with defibrillator patches applied to the [[epicardium]] or [[pericardium]]. The device was attached via subcutaneous and transvenous leads to the device contained in a subcutaneous abdominal wall pocket. The device itself acts as an electrode. Most ICDs nowadays are implanted transvenously with the devices placed in the left pectoral region similar to pacemakers. Intravascular spring or coil electrodes are used to defibrillate.  The devices have become smaller and less invasive as the technology advances.  Current ICDs weigh only 70&amp;nbsp;grams and are about 12.9&amp;nbsp;mm thick.

A recent study by Birnie and colleagues at the University of Ottawa Heart Institute has demonstrated that ICDs are underused in both the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/177/1/41|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|title=Use of implantable cardioverter defibrillators in Canadian and US survivors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest|last=Birnie|first=David H|author2=Sambell, Christie |author3=Johansen, Helen |author4=Williams, Katherine |author5=Lemery, Robert |author6=Green, Martin S |author7=Gollob, Michael H |author8=Lee, Douglas S |author9= Tang, Anthony SL  |accessdate=2007-07-29|date=July 2007|volume=177|issue=1|doi=10.1503/cmaj.060730|pages=41–46|pmid=17606938|pmc=1896034}}&lt;/ref&gt; An accompanying editorial by Dr. Chris Simpson of Queen's University explores some of the economic, geographic, social and political reasons for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cmaj.ca/cgi/reprint/177/1/49|title=Implantable cardioverter defibrillators work – so why aren't we using them?|last=Simpson|first=Christopher S|journal=Canadian Medical Association Journal|date=July 2007|accessdate=2007-07-29|volume=177|issue=1|doi=10.1503/cmaj.070470|pages=49–51|pmid=17606939|pmc=1896028}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The development of the ICD was pioneered at [[Sinai Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]] by a team including [[Michel Mirowski]], [[Morton Mower]], and William Staewen. Mirowski teamed up with Mower and Staewen and together they commenced their research in 1969 but it was 11 years before they treated their first patient.&lt;ref name=Matchett2009&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Matchett |first1=M |last2=Sears |first2=SF |last3=Hazelton |first3=G |last4=Kirian |first4=K |last5=Wilson |first5=E |last6=Nekkanti |first6=R |title=The implantable cardioverter defibrillator: its history, current psychological impact and future. |journal=Expert review of medical devices |date=January 2009 |volume=6 |issue=1 |pages=43-50 |doi=10.1586/17434440.6.1.43 |pmid=19105779}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mirowski M, Mower MM, Staewen WS, etal | year = 1970 | title = Standby automatic defibrillator: An approach to prevention of sudden coronary death | url = | journal = Arch Intern Med | volume = 126 | issue = | pages = 158–61 | doi=10.1001/archinte.1970.00310070160014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The work was commenced against much skepticism even by leading experts in the field of arrhythmias and sudden death. There was doubt that their ideas would ever become a clinical reality. In 1972 [[Bernard Lown]], the inventor of the external [[defibrillator]], and Paul Axelrod stated in the journal ''[[Circulation (journal)|Circulation]]'' – "The very rare patient who has frequent bouts of ventricular fibrillation is best treated in a coronary care unit and is better served by an effective [[anti-arrhythmic]] program or surgical correction of inadequate coronary blood flow or ventricular malfunction. In fact, the implanted defibrillator system represents an imperfect solution in search of a plausible and practical application."&lt;ref name=Matchett2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lown |first1=B |last2=Axelrod |first2=P |title=Implanted standby defibrillators. |journal=Circulation |date=October 1972 |volume=46 |issue=4 |pages=637-9 |pmid=5072764}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The problems to be overcome were the design of a system which would allow detection of ventricular fibrillation or ventricular tachycardia. Despite the lack of financial backing and grants, they persisted and the first device was implanted in February 1980 at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] by Dr. [[Levi Watkins]], Jr.&lt;ref name=Matchett2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=nytobit&gt;{{cite news|last1=Roberts|first1=Sam|title=Levi Watkins, 70, Dies; Pioneering Heart Surgeon Pushed Civil Rights|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/17/health/levi-watkins-70-pioneering-heart-surgeon-is-dead.html?_r=0|accessdate=April 24, 2015|work=New York Times|date=April 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first devices required [[Thoracotomy|the chest to be cut open]] and a mesh electrode sewn onto the heart; the [[pulse generator]] was placed in the abdomen.&lt;ref name=Matchett2009/&gt;

==Working mechanism==
ICDs constantly monitor the rate and rhythm of the heart and can deliver therapies, by way of an electrical shock, when the heart rate exceeds a preset number.  More modern devices have software designed to attempt a discrimination between [[ventricular fibrillation]] and [[ventricular tachycardia]] (VT), and may try to pace the heart faster than its intrinsic rate in the case of VT, to try to break the tachycardia before it progresses to ventricular fibrillation. This is known as overdrive pacing, or anti-tachycardia pacing (ATP).  ATP is only effective if the underlying rhythm is ventricular tachycardia, and is never effective if the rhythm is ventricular fibrillation.

Many modern ICDs use a combination of various methods to determine if a fast rhythm is normal, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular tachycardia, or ventricular fibrillation.

''Rate discrimination'' evaluates the rate of the lower chambers of the [[heart]] (the [[Ventricle (heart)|ventricle]]s) and compares it to the rate in the upper chambers of the heart (the [[Atrium (heart)|atria]]). If the rate in the atria is faster than or equal to the rate in the ventricles, then the rhythm is most likely not ventricular in origin, and is usually more benign. If this is the case, the ICD does not provide any therapy, or withholds it for a programmable length of time.

''Rhythm discrimination'' will see how regular a ventricular tachycardia is. Generally, ventricular tachycardia is regular. If the rhythm is irregular, it is usually due to conduction of an irregular rhythm that originates in the atria, such as [[atrial fibrillation]]. In the picture, an example of [[torsades de pointes]] can be seen; this represents a form of irregular ventricular tachycardia. In this case, the ICD will rely on rate, not regularity, to make the correct diagnosis.

''Morphology discrimination'' checks the morphology of every ventricular beat and compares it to what the ICD knows is the morphology of normally conducted ventricular impulse for the patient.  This normal ventricular impulse is often an average of a multiple of normal beats of the patient acquired in the recent past and known as a template.

The integration of these various parameters is very complex, and clinically, the occurrence of inappropriate therapy is still occasionally seen and a challenge for future software advancements.

==Living with an ICD==
[[Image:Implantable cardioverter defibrillator chest X-ray.jpg|thumb|A normal chest X-ray after placement of an ICD, showing the ICD generator in the upper left chest and the ICD lead in the right ventricle of the heart. Note the 2 opaque coils along the ICD lead.]]
People who have an implanted cardioverter-defibrillator can live full lives. Usually the ICD may not improve the quality of life of the patient, although it may provide a strong degree of reassurance. As with a pacemaker, however, living with an ICD does impose some restrictions on the person's lifestyle, outlined below.

===Physical activities===
Almost all forms of physical activities can be performed by patients with an ICD. All forms of sports that do not pose a risk of damaging the ICD or because of the underlying cardiomyopathy can be undertaken by the patient. Special care should be taken not to put excessive strain on the shoulder, arm and torso area where the ICD is implanted. Doing so may damage the ICD or the leads going from the ICD generator to the patient's heart. Particularly to be avoided are exercises that cause the [[clavicle]] to be pulled down towards the ribs, such as lifting weights with the arm, on the ICD site, while standing.

===Electro-magnetic equipment===
Equipment using large magnets or generating magnetic fields, or any similar environment, must be avoided by patients with an ICD.  
As with other metallic objects, an ICD is normally a [[contraindication]] to the use of [[magnetic resonance imaging]] (MRI).  However, several ICD manufacturers have recently introduced [[Safety of magnetic resonance imaging#Implants|MR-Conditional]] ICDs, which allow the use of MRI under specified safe operating conditions.

===Quality of life===
Implantable cardioverter defibrillators have demonstrated clear life-saving benefits, but concerns about patient acceptance and [[psychological]] adjustment to the ICD have been the focus of much research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | pmid = 15828880|date=April 2005| author1 = Burns| first1 = J.

}} {{closed access}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Researchers, including those from the field of [[cardiac psychology]], have concluded that the quality of life (QoL) of ICD patients is at least equal to, or better than, that of those taking [[Antiarrhythmic agent|anti-arrhythmic medications]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sears S, Matchett M, Conti J | year = 2009 | title = Effective management of ICD patient psychosocial issues and patient critical events | url = | journal = J Cardiovasc Electrophysiol | volume = 20 | issue = 11| pages = 1297–304 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-8167.2009.01526.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The largest study of examined 2,521 patients with stable heart failure in the SCD-HeFT trial.&lt;ref&gt;Bardy, Lee, Mark et al., 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Results indicated that there were no differences between ICD-treated and medication-treated groups at 30 months in patient-reported QoL.&lt;ref&gt;Mark DB, Anstrom KJ, Sun JL, Clapp-Channing NE, Tsiatis AA, Davidson-Ray L, Lee KL, Bardy GH. Quality of life with defibrillator therapy or amiodarone in heart failure. ''N Engl J Med'' 2008; 359(10):999–1008&lt;/ref&gt; Psychological adjustment following ICD implantation has also been well studied. In rare cases, the ICD can become infected and is usually bacterial in origin but other organisms such as certain fungi have occasionally been implicated.&lt;ref name="Rivera2014"/&gt; This is more likely to occur in people with [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[Congestive heart failure|heart failure]], [[kidney failure]], or [[Immunosuppression|a suppressed immune system]].&lt;ref name="Rivera2014"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Rivera NT, Bray N, Wang H, Zelnick K, Osman A, Vicuña R |title=Rare infection of implantable cardioverter-defibrillator lead with Candida albicans: case report and literature review|journal=Ther Adv Cardiovasc Dis|volume=8|issue=5|pages=193–201|date=October 2014|pmid=24951637|doi=10.1177/1753944714539406}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anxiety]] is a common psychological [[side effect]], with approximately 13–38% of ICD patients reporting clinically significant anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Bilge AK, Ozben B, Demircan S, etal | date = Jun 2006 | title = Depression and anxiety status of patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator and precipitating factors | url = | journal = Pacing Clin Electrophysiol | volume = 29 | issue = 6| pages = 619–26 | doi=10.1111/j.1540-8159.2006.00409.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Sears SF Jr. |author2=Todaro JF |author3=Lewis TS |author4=Sotile W |author5=Conti JB. | year = 1999 | title = Examining the psychosocial impact of implantable cardioverter defibrillators: a literature review | url = | journal = Clin Cardiol | volume = 22 | issue = | pages = 481–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary etiological factors contributing to anxiety in ICD patients have not been determined, however. [[Depression (mood)|Depressive]] symptoms are also common, but the incidence of these problems has been shown to be similar to those observed in other cardiac patient groups, with approximately 24–41% of patients with ICDs experiencing depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Problems in psychosocial adjustment to ICDs, including the experience of anxiety, among spouses or other romantic partners are also prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vasquez-Sowell L, Sears SF, Walker RL, Kuhl EA, Conti JB | year = 2007 | title = Anxiety and marital adjustment in patients with implantable cardioverter defibrillator and their spouses | url = | journal = Journal of Cardiopulmonary Rehabilitation and Prevention | volume = 27 | issue = | pages = 46–49 | doi=10.1097/01.hcr.0000265027.79649.6a}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon may be related, at least in part, to shared shock anxiety and avoidance of physical and sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Vasquez LD, Sears SF, Shea JB, Vasquez PM | year = 2010 | title = Sexual health for patients with an Implantable Cardioverter Defibrillator | doi = 10.1161/circulationaha.110.949628 | journal = Circulation | volume = 122 | issue = | pages = 465–67 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
His parents were Guillaume I, Seigneur de Croÿ (†1384) and Isabeau de Renty.{{sfn|Thielemans|1959|p=5}}

Jean I de Croÿ was responsible for the ascendancy of his family to a position of supreme power in [[medieval]] [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundy]]. He served [[Philip the Bold]] and his son [[John the Fearless]] in the capacity of councillor and [[Chamberlain (office)|chamberlain]].

In 1384, he married a wealthy heiress, Marguerite de Craon (ca 1370–1420),{{sfn|Thielemans|1959|p=7}} successfully suing her first husband's family upon her death. In 1397, Jean acquired the lordship of [[Chimay]], which was to become a core dominion of the Croÿ family. Four years later, he was appointed Governor of [[Artois]] and led the ducal armies against the rebellious citizens of [[Liège (city)|Liege]]. He was recorded as the [[Grand-Bouteiller]] of King [[Charles VI of France]] in 1412, when he laid siege to [[Bourges]]. 

The following year, [[Isabeau of Bavaria]] had him apprehended and incarcerated in the castle of [[Montlhéry]], whence he escaped. Jean, together with one of his sons, was killed at the [[Battle of Agincourt]] on October 25, 1415.{{sfn|Thielemans|1959|p=8}}

He had seventeen children, including:
*[[Antoine de Croy, Comte de Porcéan|Antoine I de Croÿ, Count of Porcéan]] (1385–1475)
*Archambaud de Croÿ (1386–1412){{sfn|Thielemans|1959|p=8}}
*Jean de Croÿ (1387 – 1415 at [[Battle of Agincourt]]){{sfn|Thielemans|1959|p=8}} 
*[[Jean II de Croÿ]] (1395–1473), [[Prince of Chimay]], progenitor of the [[House of Croÿ#The line of Croÿ-Solre|House of Croÿ-Solre]].  
*Agnès de Croÿ (1386?), mistress of [[John the Fearless]], [[Duke of Burgundy]], by whom she had a natural son, John of Burgundy (Jean de Bourgogne), the future [[Bishop of Cambrai]].{{sfn|Vaughn|2002|p=236}}
*Jeanne de Croÿ (1390–?), married Jean de Lannoy (c. 1370–1415), also killed at Agincourt, mother of [[Jan van Lannoy]], Stadtholder of Holland.

===Foundation and early history===
[[File:Robert-wood-johnson-i.jpg|thumb|180px|left|Robert Wood Johnson]]
[[File:Johnson and Johnson corrosive sublimate cotton.jpg|thumb|Early corrosive sublimate cotton packaging with the signature logo]]
Inspired by a speech by [[antiseptic]] advocate [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], [[Robert Wood Johnson I|Robert Wood Johnson]] joined his brothers [[James Wood Johnson]] and [[Edward Mead Johnson]] to create a line of ready-to-use [[Dressing (medical)|surgical dressings]] in 1885. The company produced its first products in 1886 and [[incorporation (business)|incorporated]] in 1887. Those products already featured a logo resembling the signature of James Wood Johnson, very similar to the logo used today. It is one of the longest-used company logos in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jnj.com/our-heritage/the-story-behind-johnson-johnson-logo|title=A Sign of the Times: The Story Behind Johnson &amp; Johnson's Iconic Logo - Johnson &amp; Johnson|website=www.jnj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Wood Johnson served as the first president of the company. He worked to improve [[sanitation]] practices in the nineteenth century, and lent his name to the [[Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital]] in New Brunswick, New Jersey. Upon his death in 1910, he was succeeded in the presidency by his brother James Wood Johnson until 1932, and then by his son, [[Robert Wood Johnson (son)|Robert Wood Johnson II]].

Robert Wood Johnson's granddaughter, [[Mary Lea Johnson Richards]], was the first baby to appear on a Johnson &amp; Johnson baby powder label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/15/nyregion/about-books.html |work=The New York Times | title=About Books | first=Shirley | last=Horner | date=February 15, 1987 | accessdate=May 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q8HGjT8KnJkC&amp;pg=PA126&amp;lpg=PA126&amp;dq=mary+lea+johnson+first+baby#v=onepage&amp;q=mary%20lea%20johnson%20first%20baby&amp;f=false |title=The Natural History of the Rich: A Field Guide |first=Richard |last=Conniff |publisher=W.

===1959: McNeil Consumer Healthcare===
McNeil Consumer Healthcare was founded on March 16, 1879, by 23-year-old Robert McNeil. In 1904, one of McNeil's sons, Robert Lincoln McNeil, became part of the company, and together they created McNeil Laboratories in 1933. The company focused on [[direct marketing]] of prescription drugs to hospitals, pharmacists, and doctors. Development of [[acetaminophen]] began under the leadership of [[Robert L. McNeil, Jr.]], who later served as the firm's chairman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Singer|first=Natasha|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/04/business/04mcneil.html?pagewanted=print|title=Robert L. McNeil Jr., Chemist Who Introduced Tylenol, Dies at 94|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=June 3, 2010|accessdate=June 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1959, Johnson &amp; Johnson acquired McNeil Laboratories and a year later the company was able to sell [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] for the first time ever, without a prescription. In 1977, two subsidiary companies were created; McNeil medicals products and McNeil Consumer Products Company (also known as McNeil Consumer Healthcare). The focus of McNeil medicals products is to market prescription drugs. In 1993 McNeil medicals products merged with the [[Ortho Pharmaceutical]] to form [[Ortho-McNeil Pharmaceutical]]. In 2001 McNeil Consumer Healthcare changed its name to McNeil Consumer &amp; Specialty medicals products. However, it was later changed to "McNeil Consumer Healthcare". The company markets [[Over-the-counter drug|over-the-counter]] and [[Prescription drug|prescription]] medicals products including complete lines of [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] and [[Motrin]] IB ([[ibuprofen]]) products for adults and children.

In 2008 a Wellness &amp; Prevention Platform was established with the double acquisition of Orlando-based LGE Performance Systems, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/johnson-and-johnson-strengthens-wellness-and-prevention-platform-with-acquisition-of-human-performance-institute-/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt; and Ann Arbor-based HealthMedia, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/johnson-and-johnson-a-href-http-www-biospace-com-joblistingcompany-aspx-job_customer_entity_id-248231-and-source-newsjoblink-font-color-red-jobs-230973/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt;

===1959: Cilag===
In 1933, Swiss chemist [[Bernhard Joos]] set up a small research laboratory in [[Schaffhausen]], Switzerland. This set the basis for the founding of Chemische Industrie-Labor AG (Chemical Industry Laboratory AG or Cilag) on 12 May 1936. In 1959, Cilag joined the Johnson &amp; Johnson family of companies. In the early nineties, the marketing organizations of Cilag and [[Janssen Pharmaceutica]] were joined to form [[Janssen-Cilag]]. The non-marketing activities of both companies still operate under their original name. Cilag continues to have operations under the Cilag name in Switzerland, ranging from research and development through manufacturing and international services.

In May 2011 Cilag acquired the over-the-counter operations of J B Chemicals &amp; Pharmaceuticals Limited for around $260 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/johnson-and-johnson-to-buy-jb-chemicals-and-pharmaceuticals-limited-s-russian-brands-for-about-260-million-/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt; In June 2012, the division announced the acquisition of CorImmun GmbH, and its lead compound, COR-1, a small cyclic peptide in development for the treatment of heart failure.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/releases/janssen-cilag-ag-acquires-b-corimmun-b-/?keywords=johnson+%26+johnson+acquire&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2014, Cilag acquired Covagen a biopharmaceutical company which specializes in the development of multi-specific protein-based therapeutics. As part of the acquisition Cilag will gain access to Covagen's lead drug candidate, COVA 322, a bi-specific anti-tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha/anti-interleukin (IL)-17A FynomAb, is in a Phase Ib study for [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/janssen-affiliate-cilag-acquires-covagen/81250273/|title=Janssen Affiliate Cilag Acquires Covagen|work=GEN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1961: Janssen Pharmaceuticals===
Janssen Pharmaceuticals can be traced back to 1933. In 1933, [[Constant Janssen]], the father of Paul Janssen, acquired the right to distribute the pharmaceutical products of [[Gedeon Richter Ltd.|Richter]], a Hungarian pharmaceutical company, for Belgium, the Netherlands and [[Belgian Congo]]. On 23 October 1934, he founded the N.V. Produkten Richter in [[Turnhout]]. After the Second World War, the name for the company products was changed to Eupharma, although the company name Richter would remain until 1956.&lt;ref name=JanssenHist&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lopez-Munoz|first1=Francisco|last2=Alamo|first2=Cecilio|title=The Consolidation of Neuroleptic Therapy: Janssen, the Discovery of Haloperidol and Its Introduction into Clinical Practice|journal=Brain Research Bulletin|date=2009|volume=79|pages=130–141|pmid= 19186209|doi=10.1016/j.brainresbull.2009.01.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Janssen founded his own research laboratory in 1953 on the third floor of the building in the Statiestraat, still within the Richter-Eurpharma company of his father. On 5 April 1956, the name of the company was changed to NV Laboratoria Pharmaceutica C. Janssen (named after Constant Janssen). On 2 May 1958, the research department in Beerse became a separate legal entity, the N.V. Research Laboratorium C. Janssen. On 24 October 1961, the company was acquired by the American corporation Johnson &amp; Johnson. On 10 February 1964, the name was changed to Janssen Pharmaceutica N.V. Between 1990 and 2004, Janssen Pharmaceuticals expanded worldwide, with the company growing in size to approximately 28000 employees worldwide. In 1999, clinical research and non-clinical development become a global organization within Johnson &amp; Johnson. In 2001, part of the research activities was transferred to the United States with the reorganization of research activities in the [[Johnson &amp; Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development]] organization. The research activities of the Janssen Research Foundation and the R.W. Johnson Pharmaceutical Research Institute were merged into the new global research organization.

== JNJ Headquarters and the New Brunswick gentrification ==
The company has historically been located on the [[Delaware and Raritan Canal]] in New Brunswick. The company considered moving its headquarters out of New Brunswick in the 1960s, but decided to stay in the town after city officials promised to gentrify downtown New Brunswick by demolishing old buildings and constructing new ones.

While New Brunswick lost many historic structures, including the early home of Rutgers University, and most of its historic commercial waterfront to the redevelopment effort, the gentrification did attract people back to New Brunswick. Johnson &amp; Johnson hired [[Henry N. Cobb]] from [[Pei Cobb Freed &amp; Partners]] to design an addition to its headquarters. The white tower in a park across the [[Northeast Corridor|railroad tracks]] from the older portion of the headquarters in one of [[List of tallest buildings in New Brunswick|tallest buildings in New Brunswick]].

The stretch of Delaware and Raritan canal by the company's headquarters was replaced by a stretch of [[New Jersey Route 18|Route 18]] in the late 1970s,&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=F00714FC345D167493CBA9178CD85F438785F9 2 Long-Disputed Projects to Begin], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 9, 1977&lt;/ref&gt; after a lengthy dispute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=FA0914FC355F167493C4A8178FD85F438785F9 Old Raritan Canal Lock Is Focus of a Classic Dispute], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 16, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the company released its plan of setting up [[Asia-Pacific]] information technology headquarters in New South Wales within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20020314023 |title=JOHNSON &amp; JOHNSON ASIA-PACIFIC INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY HEADQUARTERS |date=March 14, 2002 |accessdate=July 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530111717/http://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/prod/parlment/hansart.nsf/V3Key/LC20020314023 |archivedate=May 30, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
The company's business is divided into three major segments, Pharmaceuticals, Medical Devices, and Consumer Products. In 2015, these segments contributed 44.9%, 35.9%, and 19.2%, respectively, of the company's total revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/JNJ/1709744668x0x881109/474857DD-8E67-43B1-BB38-0A9712D93545/2015_annual_report_.pdf |format=PDF|work=files.shareholder.com |title=Downloads |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pharmaceuticals===
The company's major franchises in the Pharmaceutical segment include Immunology, Neuroscience, Infectious Disease, and Oncology.

Immunology products include the anti-[[tumor necrosis factor]] antibodies Remicade ([[infliximab]]), and Simponi ([[golimumab]]) used for the treatment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2013/103772s5359lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; of autoimmune diseases, including [[rheumatoid arthritis]], [[Crohn's disease]] (Remicade only), [[ulcerative colitis]], [[ankylosing spondylitis]], and other disorders. In 2013, these two products accounted for 29% of Johnson and Johnson's pharmaceutical revenues, and 11.3% of the company's total revenues. A third immunology product, Stelara ([[ustekinumab]]), targets [[interleukin-12]] and [[interleukin-23]] and is used for the treatment of [[psoriasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/125261s114lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Key infectious diseases products include Incivio ([[telaprevir]]), a hepatitis C protease inhibitor; Intelence ([[Etravirine]]), a non-nucleoside HIV polymerase inhibitor; and Prezista ([[darunavir]]), an HIV protease inhibitor. Telaprevir sales are expected to decline due to the recent approval of treatment regimens that are more efficacious and much better tolerated. Etravirine and darunavir are notable for their high barriers to resistance development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ruela Corrêa JC, D'Arcy DM, dos Reis Serra CH, Nunes Salgado HR |title=Darunavir: a critical review of its properties, use and drug interactions |journal=Pharmacology |volume=90 |issue=1-2 |pages=102–9 |year=2012 |pmid=22797653 |doi=10.1159/000339862 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tools.wmflabs.org/citation-template-filling/cgi-bin/index.cgi?ddb=&amp;type=pubmed_id&amp;id=++++23560740 |title=Wikipedia template filling |publisher=Tools.wmflabs.org |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darunavir in combination with HIV polymerase inhibitors is recommended as a first line treatment option for treatment naive persons with HIV infection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://aidsinfo.nih.gov/contentfiles/lvguidelines/adultandadolescentgl.pdf |title=aidsinfo.nih.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but etravirine is approved only for use in treatment-experienced patients, owing in part to its requirement for twice-daily dosing.

The company's CNS products include the ADHD drug Concerta ([[methylphenidate]] extended release), and the long-acting injectable antipsychotics Invega Sustenna ([[paliperidone palmitate]]) and Risperdal Consta ([[risperidone]]). Invega Sustenna and Risperdal Consta were the first widely utilized long-acting depot injections for the treatment of schizophrenia. Designed to address the issue of poor patient compliance with oral therapy, they are administered by intramuscular injection at intervals of 2 weeks and one month, respectively. Only minimal improvements in outcomes relative to the oral versions of these drugs were observed in the clinical trial setting, but some evidence suggests that the advantages of long-acting injections in clinical practice may be greater than is readily demonstrated in the environment of a clinical trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaplan G, Casoy J, Zummo J |title=Impact of long-acting injectable antipsychotics on medication adherence and clinical, functional, and economic outcomes of schizophrenia |journal=Patient Prefer Adherence |volume=7 |issue= |pages=1171–80 |year=2013 |pmid=24265549 |pmc=3833623 |doi=10.2147/PPA.S53795 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kane JM, Kishimoto T, Correll CU |title=Assessing the comparative effectiveness of long-acting injectable vs. oral antipsychotic medications in the prevention of relapse provides a case study in comparative effectiveness research in psychiatry |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=66 |issue=8 Suppl |pages=S37–41 |date=August 2013 |pmid=23849151 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2013.01.012 |url=|pmc=3742035 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fusar-Poli P, Kempton MJ, Rosenheck RA |title=Efficacy and safety of second-generation long-acting injections in schizophrenia: a meta-analysis of randomized-controlled trials |journal=Int Clin Psychopharmacol |volume=28 |issue=2 |pages=57–66 |date=March 2013 |pmid=23165366 |doi=10.1097/YIC.0b013e32835b091f |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oncology products include Velcade ([[bortezomib]]), for the treatment of multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2012/021602s031s032lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Zytiga ([[abiraterone]]), an androgen antagonist for the treatment of prostate cancer. In clinical trials, abiraterone treatment was associated with a 4.6 to 5.2 survival advantage when used either before or after chemotherapy with platinum-based drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/drugsatfda_docs/label/2014/202379s009lbl.pdf |title=www.accessdata.fda.gov |work= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On December 31, 2012, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] approved [[bedaquiline|Sirturo]] (bedaquiline), a Johnson &amp; Johnson [[tuberculosis]] drug that is the first new medicine to fight the infection in more than forty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA Approves 1st New Tuberculosis Drug in 40 Years|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/wireStory/fda-approves-tuberculosis-40-years-18100650#.UOIPT-RQWe0|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=December 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 29, 1982, a "Tylenol scare" began when the first of seven individuals died in [[Chicago metropolitan area]], after ingesting Extra Strength Tylenol that had been deliberately laced with [[cyanide]].&lt;ref name="nytrecall" /&gt; Within a week, the company pulled 31 million bottles of capsules back from retailers, making it one of the first major recalls in American history.&lt;ref name="nytrecall"&gt;{{cite news |work=The New York Times | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2002/03/23/your-money/23iht-mjj_ed3_.html | title = Tylenol made a hero of Johnson &amp; Johnson : The recall that started them all | date = March 23, 2002 | author=Judith Rehak }}&lt;/ref&gt; The incident led to reforms in the packaging of [[over-the-counter substance]]s and to federal anti-tampering laws.

=== 2010 hip-replacement recall ===
{{Main|2010 DePuy Hip Recall}}
On August 2009, 2010, DePuy, a subsidiary of American giant Johnson &amp; Johnson, recalled its ASR (articular surface replacement) hip prostheses from the market. DePuy said the recall was due to unpublished National Joint Registry data showing a 12% revision rate for resurfacing at five years and an ASR XL revision rate of 13%. All hip prostheses fail in some patients, but it is expected that the rate will be about 1% a year.&lt;ref name="Out of joint"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/342/bmj.d2905.full | title = Out of joint: The story of the ASR | date = May 14, 2011 | author=Deborah Cohen }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Pathologically, the failing prosthesis had several effects. Metal debris from wear of the implant led to a reaction that destroyed the soft tissues surrounding the joint, leaving some patients with long term disability. Ions of cobalt and chromium—the metals from which the implant was made—were also released into the blood and cerebral spinal fluid in some patients.&lt;ref name="fda1"&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.fda.gov/MedicalDevices/ProductsandMedicalProcedures/ImplantsandProsthetics/MetalonMetalHipImplants/ucm241604.htm | title = FDA. Concerns about metal-on-metal hip implant systems. 2011 | year = 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a jury in Los Angeles ordered Johnson &amp; Johnson to pay more than $8.3 million in damages to a Montana man in the first of more than 10,000 lawsuits pending against the company in connection with the now-recalled DePuy hip.&lt;ref name="Meier"&gt;{{cite news|last=Meier|first=Barry|title=J.&amp;J.

=== Use of the Red Cross symbol ===
[[File:Flag of the Red Cross.svg|thumb|150px|Flag of the [[Red Cross]]]]

{{further|Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Use of the emblems}}
Johnson &amp; Johnson registered the [[Red Cross]] as a U.S. trademark for "medicinal and surgical plasters" in 1905 and has used the design since 1887.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tarr.uspto.gov/servlet/tarr?regser=serial&amp;entry=71013666|title=Trademark Status &amp; Document Retrieval|work=uspto.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Geneva Conventions]], which reserved the [[Emblems of the International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement#Red Cross|Red Cross emblem]] for specific uses, were first approved in 1864 and ratified by the United States in 1882. However, the emblem was not protected by U.S. law for the use of the [[American Red Cross]] and the U.S. military until after Johnson &amp; Johnson had obtained its trademark. A clause in this law (now 18 U.S.C. 706) permits this pre-existing uses of the Red Cross to continue.

&lt;!-- Please do NOT insert any further assertions that continued Johnson &amp; Johnson use of the Red Cross violates the Geneva Conventions; as a the paragraph below states, the U.S. specifically excluded that application of the Geneva Conventions thru a reservation. --&gt;
A declaration made by the U.S. upon its ratification of the 1949 Geneva Conventions includes a [[Reservation (law)|reservation]] that pre-1905 U.S. domestic uses of the Red Cross, such as Johnson &amp; Johnson's, would remain lawful as long as the cross is not used on "aircraft, vessels, vehicles, buildings or other structures, or upon the ground," i.e., uses which could be confused with its military uses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icrc.org/ihl.nsf/NORM/D6B53F5B5D14F35AC1256402003F9920?OpenDocument U.S. reservations to the 1949 Geneva Conventions] ([[International Committee of the Red Cross]] website)&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the U.S. did not agree to any interpretation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions that would overrule Johnson &amp; Johnson's trademark. The American Red Cross continues to recognize the validity of Johnson &amp; Johnson's trademark.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_6910,00.html American Red Cross Defends Use of Emblem and Mission] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070818044717/http://www.redcross.org/pressrelease/0,1077,0_314_6910,00.html# |date=August 18, 2007 }} ([[American Red Cross]] press release, August 10, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2007, Johnson &amp; Johnson filed a lawsuit against the [[American Red Cross]] (ARC), demanding that the charity halt the use of the red cross symbol on products it sells to the public, though the company takes no issue with the charity's use of the mark for non-profit purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118662527980592590 "Red Cross Is Sued by J&amp;J Over Signature Emblem"] ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' August 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2008, the judge in the case dismissed most of Johnson &amp; Johnson's claims, and a month later the two organizations announced a settlement had been reached in which both parties would continue to use the symbol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/18/business/18cross.html | title = Claim Over Red Cross Symbol Is Settled |work=The New York Times | date = June 18, 2008 | author=Stephanie Saul }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J&amp;J said they will appeal the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-johnson-johnson-cancer-lawsuit/jj-ordered-to-pay-417-million-in-trial-over-talc-cancer-risks-idUSKCN1B121D|title=J&amp;J ordered to pay $417 million in trial over talc cancer risks|date=August 21, 2017|publisher=|via=Reuters}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2017, the [[Missouri]] Eastern District appeals court on Tuesday threw out a $72 million jury verdict. The appeals court ruled 3-0 that Jacqueline Fox's lawsuit lacked jurisdiction in Missouri because of a U.S. Supreme Court decision that imposed limits on where injury lawsuit can be filed which lawsuit's jurisdiction requires a stronger connection between the forum state and a plaintiff's claims. Fox, 62, of [[Birmingham, Ala.]], died in 2015, about four months before her trial was held in [[St. Louis]] Circuit Court. She was among 65 plaintiffs, of whom only two were from Missouri. Subsequently, it also would kill three other recent St. Louis jury verdicts of more than $200 million combined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/missouri-appeals-court-tosses-out-million-dollar-johnson-johnson-talcum/article_e976d9eb-c9dc-5fdf-b136-8d94bc6cfbdd.html|title=Missouri appeals court tosses out $72 million Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum powder verdict|first=Joel|last=Currier|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, a St. Louis jury awarded nearly US$4.7 billion in damages to 22 women and their families after they claimed asbestos in Johnson &amp; Johnson talcum powder caused their ovarian cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bever |first1=Lindsey |title=Johnson &amp; Johnson ordered to pay $4.7 billion to women who say baby powder gave them cancer |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/07/13/johnson-johnson-ordered-to-pay-4-7-billion-to-women-who-say-baby-powder-gave-them-cancer/ |website=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=28 July 2018 |language=en |date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2018, Johnson &amp; Johnson said that it removed several chemicals from baby powder products and re-engineered them to be safer for children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.livemint.com/Companies/f2z1TqJx9HtNRwmAEiIXXK/Johnson-and-Johnsonremoveschemicals-to-make-products-safer.html|title=Johnson and Johnson removes chemicals to make products safer|accessdate=25 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''L'Inconnue de la Seine''''' ({{lang-en|The Unknown Woman of the Seine}}) was an unidentified young woman whose putative [[death mask]] became a popular fixture on the walls of artists' homes after 1900. Her visage inspired numerous literary works.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news |first=Angelique|last=Chrisafis  |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Ophelia of the Seine |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/art/visualart/story/0,,2219993,00.html |work=The Guardian Weekend magazine, page 17 – 27 |publisher=The Guardian  |date= December 1, 2007 |accessdate=2007-12-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the mask is also known as '''''"La Belle Italienne"'''''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://felicecalchi.blogspot.com/2012/05/la-belle-italienne.html FELICECALCHI: La Belle Italienne], accessed 27 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to an often-repeated story, the body of the young woman was pulled out of the [[Seine|Seine River]] at the [[Quai du Louvre]] in [[Paris]] around the late 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Bronfen, ''Over her Dead Body: Death, Femininity and the Aesthetic'', MUP, 1992, p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Since the body showed no signs of violence, [[suicide]] was suspected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-24534069|title=Mystery of the world's most-kissed woman|first=Jeremy|last=Grange|date=16 October 2013|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A pathologist at the Paris Morgue was, according to the story, so taken by her beauty that he had to make a wax plaster cast [[death mask]] of her face. It has been questioned whether the expression of the face could belong to a drowned person.&lt;ref name=Grange/&gt; According to other accounts, the mask was taken from the daughter of a mask manufacturer in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://williamgaddis.org/recognitions/inconnue/index.shtml "l'Inconnue de la Seine"] by Anja Zeidler&lt;/ref&gt;  The identity of the girl was never discovered.  Claire Forestier estimated the age of the model at no more than 16, given the firmness of the skin.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt;

In the following years, numerous copies were produced. The copies quickly became a fashionable morbid fixture in Parisian [[Bohemianism|Bohemian]] society. [[Albert Camus]] and others compared her enigmatic smile to that of the [[Mona Lisa]], inviting numerous speculations as to what clues the eerily happy expression in her face could offer about her life, her death, and her place in [[society]].

The popularity of the figure is also of interest to the history of artistic media, relating to its widespread reproduction. The original cast had been photographed, and new casts were created from the film negatives. These new casts displayed details that are usually lost in bodies taken from the water, but the apparent preservation of these details in the [[face|visage]] of the cast seemed to only reinforce its authenticity.

Critic [[Al Alvarez]] wrote in his book on suicide, ''[[The Savage God]]'': "I am told that a whole generation of German girls modeled their looks on her." According to Hans Hesse of the [[University of Sussex]], Alvarez reports, "the Inconnue became the erotic ideal of the period, as [[Brigitte Bardot|Bardot]] was for the 1950s. He thinks that German actresses such as [[Elisabeth Bergner]] modeled themselves on her. She was finally displaced as a paradigm by [[Greta Garbo]]."&lt;ref&gt;Alvarez, Al. ''The Savage God. A Study of Suicide.'' New York &amp; London: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 1971. Page 156.&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2017 a workshop called L’Atelier Lorenzi in [[Arcueil]] made plaster death masks from a 19th century mold, which is said to be that of L'Inconnue de la Seine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sciolino|first1=Elaine|title=At a Family Workshop Near Paris, the ‘Drowned Mona Lisa’ Lives On|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/20/world/europe/paris-mask-picasso-truffaut.html|work=The New York Times|date=20 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic portrayals==
=== Literature ===
==== English literature ====
The earliest mention can be found in [[Richard Le Gallienne]]'s 1900 novella ''[[The Worshipper of the Image]]'', in which an English poet falls in love with the mask, eventually leading to the death of his daughter and the suicide of his wife.

An image of ''L'Inconnue'' has been used on the cover illustration for the family history mystery novel ''A Habit of Dying'' by D. J. Wiseman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ahabitofdying.wordpress.com/that-image/ "A Habit of Dying"] by DJ Wiseman&lt;/ref&gt;

==== German literature ====
The [[protagonist]] of [[Rainer Maria Rilke]]'s only novel, ''[[Die Aufzeichnungen des Malte Laurids Brigge]]'' (1910), reflects:
{{quote|The caster I visit every day has two masks hanging next to his door. The face of the young one who drowned, which someone copied in the morgue because it was beautiful, because it was still smiling, because its smile was so deceptive – as though it knew.&lt;ref&gt;"Der Mouleur, an dem ich jeden Tag vorüberkomme, hat zwei Masken neben seiner Tür ausgehängt. Das Gesicht der jungen Ertränkten, das man in der Morgue abnahm, weil es schön war, weil es lächelte, weil es so täuschend lächelte, als es wüßte."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1926 {{ill|Ernst Benkard|de}} published ''Das ewige Antlitz'', a book about 126 death masks, writing about our subject that she is "like a delicate butterfly to us, who, carefree and exhilarated, fluttered right into the lamp of life, scorching her fine wings."&lt;ref&gt;"... uns jedoch ein zarter Schmetterling, der, sorglos beschwingt, an der Leuchte des Lebens seine feinen Flügel vor der Zeit verflattert und versengt hat."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reinhold Conrad Muschler]]'s 1934 widely translated best-selling novel ''Die Unbekannte'' tells the maudlin story of the fate of the provincial orphan Madeleine Lavin, who has fallen in love with the British diplomat Lord Thomas Vernon Bentick and, after a romance, commits suicide in the Seine when Bentick returns to his fiancée. This novel was turned into a film of the same name in 1936.

A male pathologist was said to have recorded the face of an unidentified young woman who, around the age of sixteen, according to his story, had been found drowned in the Seine River at Paris, France around the late 1880s. The man at the Paris Morgue was so taken by her beauty that he worked for hours to make a plaster cast of her face. She was considered so beautiful that the worker said: "Her beauty was breathtaking, and showed few signs of distress at the time of passing. So bewitching that I knew beauty as such must be preserved." The cast was also known as "Bewitching Woman", a nickname that never caught on. The cast was also compared to the ''Mona Lisa'', and other famous paintings and sculptures so much that, in the following years, copies of the mask became fashionable figures in Parisian Bohemian society. Other accounts state that the cast was taken from a young German mistress (also said to be the man's natural-born daughter) who bore the child of a mask-maker who sold the cast and then committed suicide (in the Seine River) when her baby was stillborn.

Other examples appear in:
* [[Alfred Döblin]]'s essay, "Of Faces, Pictures, and their Truth" ("Von Gesichtern, Bildern, und ihrer Wahrheit"), published as an introduction to photographer [[August Sander]]'s 1929 collection ''Face of our Time'' (''Antlitz der Zeit'').
* [[Hertha Pauli]]'s 1931 story "L'Inconnue de la Seine", which first appeared in the ''[[Berliner Tageblatt]]''
* [[Ödön von Horváth]]'s play based on his friend Hertha Pauli's story, written in 1934 and titled ''Eine Unbekannte aus der Seine''
* [[Claire Goll]]'s 1936 short story "Die Unbekannte aus der Seine", in which the protagonist peers into a death mask and dies from a heart attack caused by delusion and guilt as he believes he recognizes the face as his daughter's
* U-Boat commander [[Herbert Werner|Herbert A. Werner]] mentions having a copy of the cast on his wall in his parents' house in his memoir ''Iron Coffins''
* [[Max Frisch]]'s 1955 play ''Die Chinesische Mauer'' features ''L'Inconnue de la Seine'' as one of several historical figures

==== Russian literature ====

[[Vladimir Nabokov]]'s 1934 poem ''L'Inconnue de la Seine'', written in [[Russian language|Russian]], was published in ''Poslednie Novosti'' in 1934.  It has been argued that this poem has as much to do with the Slavic myth of [[rusalka]] as with the mask itself.&lt;ref&gt;D. Barton Johnson (1992), "L'inconnue de la Seine" and Nabokov's Naiads, ''Comparative Literature'', 44, 3, p. 225-248.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== American literature ====
''L'Inconnue'' is referenced in [[William Gaddis]]' 1955 novel ''[[The Recognitions]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.williamgaddis.org/recognitions/inconnue/index.shtml |title=Influence and authenticity of l'Inconnue de la Seine |publisher=WilliamGaddis.org |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Caitlín R. Kiernan]] writes about ''L'Inconnue'' as the model of [[Resusci Anne]] in her novel ''[[The Drowning Girl]]'' (2012). The story is deeply tied to the themes and images of the book.

Referenced as the origin of the CPR doll by [[Chuck Palahniuk]] in "Exodus", a story in ''[[Haunted (Palahniuk novel)|Haunted]]''.

==== French literature ====
[[Maurice Blanchot]], who owned one of the masks, described her as "a young girl with closed eyes, enlivened by a smile so relaxed and at ease ... that one could have believed that she drowned in an instant of extreme happiness".&lt;ref&gt;"... une adolescente aux yeux clos, mais vivante par un sourire si délié, si fortuné, ... qu'on eût pu croire qu'elle s'était noyée dans un instant d'extrême bonheur"&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Louis Aragon]]'s 1944 novel ''Aurélien'', ''L'Inconnue'' played a significant role as one of the main characters attempts to rejuvenate the mask from various photographs. At the beginning of the 1960s [[Man Ray]] contributed photographs to a new edition of the work.

In 2012, Didier Blonde wrote a novel called ''L'inconnue de la Seine'', about a man in Paris who stumbles upon a copy of the mask in an antiques store, and who tries to find out more about the girl it was modelled after. The book was published by Gallimard (Blanche).

=== Ballet ===
In 1963, [[Bentley Stone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1984/02/24/obituaries/bentley-stone-ballet-teacher.html|title=BENTLEY STONE, BALLET TEACHER|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; choreographed a version of L'inconnue to music by [[Francis Poulenc]] for the [[Stone-Camryn Ballet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/104.html|title=Ballet|website=www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It premiered with a cast that included [[Ruth Ann Koesun]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imdb.com/name/nm2477870/|title=Ruth Ann Koesun|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[John Kriza]].  That ballet was moved to the [[American Ballet Theatre]] in 1965 with Koesun and Kriza reprising their roles, and with [[Christine Sarry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dancedialogues.prattsils.org/items/show/43|title=Dance Dialogues: Interviews by Barbara Newman, 1979-Present - Christine Sarry (published 1992)|website=dancedialogues.prattsils.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking the role of the "River Girl".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abt.org/education/archive/ballets/inconnue.html|title=ABT – L'innconue (Accessed 31 May 2015)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film ===
Director [[Agnès Varda]] talks about L'Innconnue in her 1988 documentary ''[[Jane B. par Agnès V.]]'' where she compares Jane Birkin's desire to be famous but anonymous as the state of L'Inconnue.

'''List of World War I memorials and cemeteries in Artois''', within the historic [[County of Artois]] and present day [[Pas-de-Calais]] Department of the [[Nord-Pas-de-Calais]] region, located in northeastern [[France]]. [[World War I]] battles in this area of the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] include the [[First Battle of Artois]] (December 1914–January 1915), the [[Second Battle of Artois]] (9–15 May 1915), and the [[Third Battle of Artois]] (25 September–15 October 1915).

It divides this part of the Western Front into four distinct sections: 
*the area from south of [[Ploegsteert]] to [[Festubert]].
*the area from [[La Bassée]] and [[Béthune]] to [[Lens, Pas-de-Calais|Lens]]
*the area around the two ridges of [[Notre Dame de Lorette]] and [[Vimy Ridge|Vimy]]
*the area around [[Arras]] and [[Cambrai]].

==Background==
Following the various declarations of war which were to lead to the [[First World War]], the [[German Empire|German Army]] opened the war on her western front by first invading [[Luxembourg]] and [[Belgium]] and then gaining military control of important industrial regions in [[France]]. The German Army forced the Allied armies to retreat until the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] was fought, when the tide turned and the German Army was forced to retreat northwards. They did so to the river [[Aisne]], dug in on the high ground there, and fought the [[First Battle of the Aisne]]. This encounter was inconclusive and what historians call the [[race to the sea]] followed, during which neither side was able to achieve a breakthrough as they edged to the north and at the conclusion both sides were to dig in along a meandering line of fortified [[trench warfare|trenches]], stretching from the [[North Sea]] to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] frontier with France. This line, the Western Front, remained essentially unchanged for most of the war. A war of movement was over and a type of warfare that no side had planned for was to take its place: a static war of attrition with both sides entrenched on either side of the front line.

Between 1915 and 1917, there were several major offensives along this [[Front (military)|front]]. The attacks employed massive [[artillery]] bombardments and massed [[infantry]] advances. However a combination of entrenchments, [[machine gun]] nests, [[barbed wire]], and [[artillery]] repeatedly inflicted severe casualties on the attackers and counterattacking defenders and as a result, no significant advances were made. Among the most costly of these offensives were the [[Battle of Verdun]] with a combined 700,000 dead, the [[Battle of the Somme]] with more than a million casualties, and the [[Battle of Passchendaele]] or "Third Ypres", which saw roughly 600,000 casualties.

Both sides tried to break the deadlock by introducing [[Technology during World War I|new military technology]], including [[Poison gas in World War I|poison gas]], [[aircraft]] and [[tank]]s but it was improved tactics that eventually restored some degree of mobility to the conflict. The German [[Spring Offensive]] of 1918 was made possible by the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] that marked the end of the conflict on the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]]. Using the recently introduced [[infiltration tactics]], the German armies advanced nearly {{Convert|60|mi|km|abbr=off}} to the west, which marked the deepest advance by either side since 1914 and they very nearly succeeded in forcing a breakthrough.

The Germans could not in the end break the Allied line and now the numerical advantage given the Allies by the volume of soldiers arriving from the United States of America fuelled an inexorable advance by the [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] armies during the second half of 1918. The German Army commanders finally realised that defeat was inevitable, and the government was forced to sue for conditions of an armistice.  This took place on 11 November 1918 and the terms of peace were agreed upon with the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919.

After the [[First Battle of the Marne|Battle of the Marne]] and the [[First Battle of the Aisne|Battle of the Aisne]], the encounters between the two opposing armies moved northwards towards Compiègne on 17 to 18 September 1914, to Roye on 22 September 1914, the [[Battle of Albert (1914)|Battle of Albert]] from 27 to 28 September 1914, and then the [[Battle of Arras (1914)|Battle of Arras]] from 30 September to 5 October 1914. From 4 to 8 October 1914 there was fighting at the [[Battle of La Bassée]] and at Neuve Chapelle. The two armies then continued to move northwards until the Yser and the [[North Sea]] coast were reached.

Neuve Chapelle was to see a further [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] from 10 to 13 March 1915, followed by the [[Battle of Aubers Ridge]] on 9 May 1915, [[Battle of Festubert]] from 15 to 25 May 1915, and the [[Battle of Loos]] from 25 September to 18 October 1915.

No major attacks took place in the Arras sector from the end of October 1915 to April 1917, but then we see the huge [[Battle of Arras (1917)|Battle of Arras]] fought from 9 April to 17 May 1917, fighting at [[Hill 70]] in August 1917, the "Kaiser's Battle" from 21 to 28 March 1918, the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]] in April 1918, and the [[Battle of Arras (1918)|Second Battle of Arras]] in August 1918.

==Sector 1. Arras: From south of Ploegstreet to Festubert==
The [[Battle of Armentières]] was part of the so-called "Race to the Sea",  the series of battles that were ultimately to define the line of the Western Front as trench warfare finally took over in the autumn of 1914.

|-
|In November 1918, just a week before the end of the First World War, the New Zealand Division [[Capture of Le Quesnoy (1918)|captured]] the French town of Le Quesnoy. It was the New Zealanders' last major action in the war and to this day the town of Le Quesnoy continues to mark the important role that the country played in its history. Streets are named after New Zealand places, there is the New Zealand memorial, and a primary school bears the name of a New Zealand soldier.
Le Quesnoy was occupied by the German Army for most of the First World War but on 4 November 1918, it was attacked by men of the [[New Zealand Rifle Brigade]], who scaled the high walls of the outer ramparts and seized the German Commander and his garrison of over 1,000 men. On the face of the walls is a memorial commemorating their success and the ninety New Zealand lives that were lost in the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nzembassy.com/france/relationship-between-nz-and-france/nz-and-france/war-commemorations |accessdate=10 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130224014138/http://www.nzembassy.com/france/relationship-between-nz-and-france/nz-and-france/war-commemorations |archivedate=24 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
After resisting the German offensive in the spring of 1918, the Allied Armies (including American troops), under the command of General Foch, launched a counter-attack along the length of the Western Front in what was to become known as the [[Hundred Days Offensive]]. On 21 August, the British Army launched the first of a number of attacks on the Western Front in the sectors under its control: Amiens, Albert, Arras and Bapaume. The Allied troops advanced up to the [[Hindenburg Line]] which they breached at Saint-Quentin Canal on 5 October and at Le Nord Canal three days later. Lille and Douai were liberated on 17 October, and the British Army pressed on towards the Belgian border while the New Zealand Division was given the job of liberating Le Quesnoy.
The 18th century Vauban fortifications protecting the town encouraged the Germans garrisoned there to hold out against the Allied advance; however the precision of the New Zealand artillery disrupted the organization of the German defence. In the general confusion Kiwi soldiers managed to set up a ladder on the south side of the town and enter through a sluice gate. Led by Lieutenant [[Leslie Averill]], the New Zealanders completely surprised the Germans who, after much fighting in the streets, surrendered the town on the evening of 4 November. The Armistice was signed a week later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com/visit-the-sites/the-war-of-movement-and-the-first-german-occupation/le-quesnoy-new-zealand-memorial.html |title=Le Quesnoy New Zealand Memorial- Remembrance Trails of the Great War in Northern France |website=Remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial to the 1914 Christmas Truce===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"| Memorial to the 1914 Christmas Truce
|-
|The British Army that held the front from the south of Ypres to the La Bassée canal was, in late December 1914, composed of what remained of the units which had been decimated in the [[First Battle of Ypres]] the month before. Life in the trenches was still very primitive and, with the onset of winter and the rain causing many trenches to be waterlogged, extremely demanding. The narrowness of "[[No man's land]]" in this sector of the front, just a few dozen metres, created a strange proximity between the warring parties. Small-scale, but bloody, attacks carried out in the vicinity of Ypres and French Flanders during the month of December 1914 gave way, in some sectors of the front, to spontaneous truces, in particular for the recovery of the wounded and dead lying in the mud of no man's land. On 24 December 1914, some German soldiers erected Christmas trees, complete with candles and paper lanterns, on the parapets of various first line trenches.   Christmas hymns were soon being sung on both sides and soldiers even called out to each other across the front. Similar but much larger events took place on Christmas Day. In some places the warring sides buried their dead at the same time, and some even exchanged little presents, and home addresses, while in other sectors the fighting continued to rage, mostly due to sniper activity. In the British sector the truce was observed by many units at Houplines, Bois-Grenier, Fromelles, Neuve-Chapelle and Richebourg-l'Avoué. The small village of Frelinghien is situated on the Franco-Belgian frontier just to the north east of Armentieres and a memorial to the Christmas Truce is situated in Frelinghien Park opposite their football ground. There were a number of unofficial truces held along the line that day though the commands of both sides issued orders against fraternisation.

==Sector 1: Fromelles (Fleurbaix), Aubers, Neuve Chapelle and Festubert==
South from Armentières was the front line dominated by the [[Aubers Ridge]]. The German army held this ridge, so much of the fighting in the sector involved attempts to dislodge them from it.
::"''South of the Armentières sector lies Aubers Ridge, a belt of country about 3 miles deep and 9 miles long. No extended periods of fighting devastated this ridge; but by shielding the important French town of [[Lille]] and German communications and supply hubs, it was always a potential setting for a major British offensive, The ridge itself, barely rising 50 feet above the plain was hardly an outstanding topographical feature in peacetime; in war, however, it totally dominated the terrain to the north and west.  It was to be the scene of several British struggles in 1915- and the site of a tragic failure the following year''.".&lt;ref name=PB&gt;Peter Barton's "The Battlefields of the First World War".

===The [[Australian Memorial Park]] at Fromelles and the [[Battle of Fromelles]] 19 to 20 July 1916===

|-
|The [[Australian Memorial Park]] is situated around the remains of German fortifications on the part of the German line captured by the 14th Australian Brigade and held overnight from 19 to 20 July 1916. The park and the nearby VC Corner Cemetery lies some {{convert|3|km|mi}} from Fromelles, {{convert|15|ft|m}} south of Armentières, and {{convert|16|km|mi}} west of Lille.

The work entitled ''Cobbers'' sculpted by the Melbourne sculptor [[Peter Corlett]] is located here. Corlett based his sculpture on 3101 Sergeant Simon Fraser of the 57th Battalion, a 40-year-old farmer from Victoria who had rescued many men from the battlefield. Corlett depicts him carrying a man of the 60th Battalion. Fraser was "mentioned in despatches" on a later occasion when he was a Lieutenant with the 58th Battalion.  He was killed at [[Bullecourt]] on 12 May 1917. He has no known grave and his name appears on the [[Villers-Bretonneux Memorial]]. In a letter written on 31 July 1916 Fraser wrote {{Quotation|"''It was no light work getting in with a heavy weight on your back especially if he had a broken leg or arm...You had to lie down and get him on your back; then rise and duck for your life with a chance of getting a bullet in you before you were safe.  One foggy morning... we could hear someone over towards the German entanglements calling for a stretcher bearer; it was an appeal no man could stand against, so some of us rushed out and had a hunt.  We found a fine haul of wounded and brought them in; but it was not where I heard this fellow calling, so I had another shot for it, and came across a splendid specimen of humanity trying to wriggle into a trench with a big wound in his thigh...another man about 30 yards out sang out "Don't forget me, cobber". I went in and got four volunteers with stretchers and we got both men in safely".''}}

The [[Battle of Fromelles]] or Fleurbaix was a bloody affair and in a twenty-seven-hour period the Australian 5th Division suffered 5,533 casualties, with 1,917 killed, of whom 1,299 could not be identified. A further approximately 400 men were taken prisoner. To illustrate the extent of the losses the 60th Battalion Victoria Regiment started the battle with 887 men and, when the fighting was over, had just 1 officer and 106 men left. It is also estimated that the British Army had 1,547 men killed or wounded and that the German Army lost 1,500 soldiers killed or wounded in the Battle of Fromelles.

The attack at Fromelles was planned as a diversionary attack to the north of the battle raging on the Somme. Fromelles had already seen action in 1915 when British efforts to take Aubers Ridge had been repulsed with heavy losses. The Fromelles attack in 1916 saw the baptism of the Australian Imperial Force to fighting on the Western Front as the units then down on the Somme had yet to be committed to action. As was to be the case at the Somme, the provisional artillery bombardment at Fromelles did not cut the German barbed wire as hoped would be the case, and the German machine guns, with a clear view of the attackers, were able to wreak havoc once the infantry launched their attack.

One hundred metres from Memorial Park and its tribute to the courage of the Australian Cobber lies the VC Corner Australian Cemetery which was established after the Armistice of 1918. The plaque reads {{Quotation|"In honour of 410 unknown Australian soldiers here buried who were among the following 1,299 officers and men of the Australian Imperial Force killed in the attack at Fromelles July 19th/20th July"}} It consists of two mass graves covered with immaculate lawns and marked with a cross. The graves contain the remains of more than 400 Australian soldiers who were killed in the Battle of Fromelles but who could not be identified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com/visit-the-sites/the-front/vc-corner-australian-cemetery-and-memorial-fromelles.html |title=The Front- Remembrance Trails of the Great War in Northern France |website=Remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately the war ended, Australians went back to Fromelles. {{Quotation|"We found the old No-Man's Land simply full of our dead.

===[[Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial]]- The [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] March 1915===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial
|-
|[[Neuve Chapelle]] is located some {{convert|5|km|mi}} north of [[La Bassée]] and {{convert|20|km|mi}} west-south-west of [[Lille]]. The [[Neuve-Chapelle Indian Memorial]] at Richebourg, near  Neuve Chapelle, commemorates over 4,700 Indian soldiers and labourers who lost their lives on the Western Front during the First World War and have no known graves. It was designed by [[Sir Herbert Baker]]. The location of the memorial was specially chosen as it was at Neuve Chapelle in March 1915 that the Indian Corps fought its first major action as a single unit. The memorial takes the form of a sanctuary enclosed within a circular wall after the manner of the enclosing railings of early Indian shrines. The column in the enclosure's foreground stands almost {{convert|15|ft|m}} high and was inspired by the famous inscribed columns erected by the Emperor Ashkora throughout India in the 3rd century BC. The column is surmounted with a Lotus capital, the Imperial British Crown, and the Star of India. Two tigers are carved on either side of the column guarding the temple of the dead. On the lower part of the column the words 'God is One, He is the Victory' are inscribed in English, with similar texts in Arabic, Hindi, and Gurmukhi. The tigers are the work of the sculptor [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]]. The memorial was unveiled by the Earl of Birkenhead on 7 October 1927. [[Lord Birkenhead]], then Secretary of State for India, had served as a staff officer with the Indian Corps during the war. The ceremony was also attended by the Maharaja of Karputhala, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]], [[Rudyard Kipling]], and a large contingent of Indian veterans. An inscription on the wall reads {{Quotation|"To the honour of the army of India which fought in France and Belgium, 1914-1918, and in perpetual remembrance of those of their dead whose names are here recorded and those who have no known grave."}}

The Indian Army made a huge contribution to the Great War. Their involvement on the Western Front was limited in the main to the years 1914 and 1915 and after this, in recognition of the difficulties for Indians to live and operate in the grim climatic conditions of Northern Europe, they were moved to the Egyptian Theatre of War and other warmer places. India, in the context of the 1914-1918 war, was pre-partition India; the Indian Sub-Continent in 1914 would have embraced present day India, Pakistan, Kashmir, Nepal and Bangladesh. Only days after the British government had declared war on Germany on 4 August 1914, two infantry divisions and a cavalry brigade of the Indian Army were ordered to mobilise and prepare for overseas service. Units began arriving in France in September 1914, and by late October they were involved in heavy fighting on the [[Messines Ridge]] in Belgium. It was at [[Mesen|Messines]] on 31 October 1914 that [[Khudadad Khan]] performed the act of gallantry for which he was later awarded the [[Victoria Cross]], becoming the first Indian born soldier to be so honoured. The [[Indian Corps]], which was composed of the 3rd (Lahore) and 7th (Meerut) divisions, went on to fight in some of the bloodiest battles of the first year of the war, and at the Battle of Neuve Chapelle which ran from 10 to 13 March 1915. Indian soldiers made up half of the attacking force and, despite suffering very heavy casualties, succeeded in capturing important sections of the German line. The officers and men of the Corps further distinguished themselves at St. Julien in the Ypres Salient in April 1915, at Aubers Ridge and Festubert in May of that year, and at Loos in September 1915, before they were redeployed to the Middle East in December. The Indian Cavalry Corps remained on the Western Front until the spring of 1918 and Indian labour companies, which had begun arriving in France in 1917, performed vital and often dangerous logistical work behind the lines until after the Armistice. India sent over 140,000 men to the Western Front – 90,000 serving in the infantry and cavalry and as many as 50,000 non-combatant labourers. They hailed from the length and breadth of British India: from the Punjab, Garwahl, the Frontiers, Bengal, Nepal, Madras, and Burma, and represented an extremely diverse range of religious, linguistic, and ethnic cultures. The officer corps was composed mostly of men of European descent. Of the combatants, over 8,550 were killed and as many as 50,000 more were wounded. Almost 5,000 of the dead have no known grave and are commemorated both on the Menin Gate at Ypres and here at Neuve Chapelle.

In 1964, a Special Bronze Panel was added to this memorial with the names of 210 servicemen who died during the 1914-1918 war, whose graves at Zehrensdorf Indian Cemetery, Germany, had become unmaintainable. Although this plaque still exists, the graves were reinstated in 2005. This site also contains the Neuve-Chapelle 1939-1945 Cremation Memorial. In 1964, the remains of 8 Indian soldiers (including 2 unidentified) were exhumed from Sarrebourg French Military Cemetery Extension and cremated. The names of the 6 identified soldiers are engraved on panels at the Neuve Chapelle Memorial along with the following inscription {{Quotation|"1939 -  In honour of these soldiers who died in captivity in North-West Europe and whose mortal remains were committed to fire"}}

File WO 32/5878 held at The National Archives in [[Kew]] provides further background information on the memorial. This file also covers the memorials to the Indian Army which it was proposed be erected in Mesopotamia, Egypt, Gallipoli and East Africa. The file notes that amongst those remembered at Neuve Chapelle is the Victoria Cross winner, Rifleman Gobar Sing Negi. One interesting point to arise from the National Archive file is a letter from Army Headquarters in Simla dated 26 June 1919. This includes the following  {{Quotation|" I may mention that we propose to erect war memorials in villages which have given most men to the Army. These will be selected by Local Governments, on the advice of their local Recruiting Boards, based on the statistics in their possession. In the Punjab, about 130 villages will be so honoured. In other Provinces the number will be less, but in the United Provinces and the N.W.Frontier Province it will be fairly big"}}

===Aubers Ridge and Festubert===
It was on 24 March 1915, several days after the failed offensive at Neuve-Chapelle, that [[General Joffre]] made an official request for the British Army to take part in a huge offensive he was planning in Artois at the beginning of May.  The aim of the offensive was to break through the German line north of Arras. The main thrust of the attack was to be made by the 10th French Army on Vimy Ridge and two supporting attacks on the flanks would, it was hoped, secure the heights of Lorette Spur to the north-west and other high ground to the east of Arras. If everything went according to plan the French hoped that they would be able to advance into the coal basin itself and take Douai.

In this context the British fought two battles, that at Aubers Ridge and at Festubert, both fought in May 1915, and both to distract the German's from Joffre's main attack.

Neither battle achieved the results hoped for and huge casualties were sustained- it reportedly took three days to transfer the wounded of 9 May to the field ambulances on the second line. In one single day of fighting the British Army had lost 11,000 men (dead, wounded and lost in action) which was, in relative terms, one of the highest casualty rates of the Great War, in particular for officers.

===Memorial to the 15th Battalion Canadian Infantry===

! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"|Memorial to the 15th Battalion Canadian Infantry
|-
|There is a commemorative plaque located just a kilometre to the east of Festubert which marks the efforts in this area of the 15th Battalion Canadian Infantry during the Battle of Festubert which opened on 15 May 1915.

Following the German gas attack in the Ypres Salient in April 1915, the depleted Battalions of the Canadian 1st Division were reinforced and moved to France south of Armentières.  On 18 May the Canadian 3rd Brigade, was called up from Reserve and moved into the line east of Festubert, joining a series of assaults around a German strong point called the Orchard. The 14th Battalion ([[Royal Montreal Regiment]]), 16th ([[The Canadian Scottish Regiment (Princess Mary's)|The Canadian Scottish Regiment]]) and the 15th Battalion ([[48th Highlanders of Canada]]) all played a significant part in the fighting.

When the battle was called off on 25 May, the line established by the advances of the 15th and 16th Battalions remained the front line until 1918. The Canadian 1st Division suffered 2,468 casualties and the 15th Battalion lost 150 men. The fallen of the 15th Battalion lie buried in: Aire Communal, Arras Road, Béthune, Cabaret Rouge, Étaples, Guards (Cuinchy), Hinges, Le Touquet and Pont-de-Hem Cemeteries and the Missing are commemorated on the Vimy Memorial. The commemorative plaque was unveiled on 23 October 2011 in the presence of Canadian and French dignitaries by members of the 15th Battalion Memorial Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmatters.net/txtpat/index.php?id=435 |title=Monument to the 15th Bn CEF at Festubert |publisher=Webmatters |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The [[Le Touret Memorial]], which lies between [[Béthune]] and [[Armentiéres]], commemorates over 13,400 British soldiers who were killed in this sector of the Western Front from the beginning of October 1914 to the eve of the [[Battle of Loos]] in late September 1915 and who have no known grave. The Memorial takes the form of a [[loggia]] surrounding an open rectangular court. The names of those commemorated are listed on panels set into the walls of the court and the gallery, these are arranged by regiment, rank, and alphabetically by surname within the rank. The memorial was designed by John Reginald Truelove, who had served as an officer with the London Regiment during the war, and was unveiled by the British ambassador to France, [[Lord Tyrrell]], on 22 March 1930. Almost all of the men commemorated on the Memorial served with regular or territorial regiments from across the United Kingdom and were killed in actions that took place along a section of the front line that stretched from Estaires in the north to Grenay in the south. This part of the Western Front was the scene of some of the heaviest fighting of the first years of the war, including: the [[Battle of La Bassée]] fought from 10 October to 2 November 1914, [[Battle of Neuve Chapelle]] fought from 10 to 12 March 1915, [[Battle of Aubers Ridge]] fought from 9 to 10 May 1915, and [[Battle of Festubert]] fought from 15 to 25 May 1915. Soldiers serving with Indian and Canadian units who were killed in this sector in 1914 and 1915 whose remains were never identified, are commemorated on the Neuve Chapelle and Vimy memorials, while those who fell during the northern pincer attack at the Battle of Aubers Ridge are commemorated on the [[Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/85800/LE%20TOURET%20MEMORIA |title=Cemetery Details |publisher=CWGC |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|On the same road as the Indian Memorial is the Portuguese and their cemetery at Richebourg. On 9 April 1918 the German Army launched [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Operation Georgette]] in the Lys Valley in the hope of a decisive victory before the arrival of further American reinforcements. In three successive waves, ten divisions overwhelmed the two Portuguese divisions which were incomplete, badly organized, and taken by surprise as they were in the process of being relieved. Portuguese losses amounted to 7,500 men on that day. On  the next day, along with the Scottish, the survivors defended La Couture near Béthune before eventually being forced to retreat. The Germans took Estaires, Armentières and Bailleul but failed to take Béthune and Hazebrouck. Operation Georgette was called off on 29 April 1918. The Portuguese had suffered heavy casualties in this action and the bodies of many of the men killed were beyond identification. 239 of the graves at Richebourg are marked with the Portuguese word ''Desconhecido'' ("unknown"). The site of the cemetery/memorial takes up both sides of the road and on one side there is a chapel dedicated to Our Lady of Fatima and on the other side, behind an entrance and a wrought-iron gate, is the Portuguese National Cemetery, the final resting place of 1,831 soldiers.

In 1916, the young Portuguese Republic had entered the war on the side of the Allies. The [[Portuguese Expeditionary Force]] comprised up to 56,500 men and, under the command of the British Army, was assigned to Flanders and positioned in the trenches between the villages of Laventie and Festubert. The Portuguese Command took up quarters in Peylouse Manor in Saint-Venant.

In honour of the soldiers who defended the village of La Couture, the French and Portuguese governments inaugurated a monument there in 1928. The monument's frieze shows the ruins of a Gothic church and an allegory of the Portuguese Republic coming to the aid of one of its soldiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com/visit-the-sites/the-front/portuguese-national-cemetery-richebourg.html |title=Portuguese National Cemetery - Richebourg- Remembrance Trails of the Great War in Northern France |website=Remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dud Corner Cemetery, the [[Loos Memorial]], and the [[Battle of Loos]]===
[[File:Dud corner cemetery-Loos memorial-2.jpg|thumb|right|350px|View of Dud Corner Cemetery, with the [[Loos Memorial]] seen at the rear]]

In the autumn of 1915, the British High Command had little enthusiasm for another major offensive but the French were quite insistent on one. Joffre's plans involved a two-pronged attack. The French Army was to launch a major attack in the Champagne area and a Franco-Commonwealth attack was planned on a {{convert|32|km|mi}} line to the north of Arras. Of this 32-kilometre stretch the British were allocated a {{convert|10|km|mi}} section running from Givenchy just north of the La Bassée Canal and the industrial town of Bully-Grenay in front of Lens; the Gohelle Battlefields.&lt;ref name=PB/&gt;

One reason for Haig and French's lack of enthusiasm was that they did not feel that they had fully absorbed the lessons of Second Ypres, Festubert, Neuve Chapelle and Aubers Ridge, the earlier offensives of 1915 and the doomed Gallipoli campaign had diverted precious men and munitions from the Western Front. However, their major concern was that the levels of ammunition available would not support a major offensive as the initial advances by the infantry would have to be supported by a high degree of artillery fire. The French demand was however met and the British Army allocated the 10 kilometre sector mentioned earlier. At this battle the British intended to make their first use of gas and the offensive would give Kitchener's "New Army" a chance to show their mettle.

In fact the offensive failed both in the [[Champagne]] and at [[Loos-en-Gohelle|Loos]] and the [[Loos Memorial]] at Loos-en-Gohelle commemorates the 20,605 British officers and men who were killed from 25 September 1915 to the end of the war in November 1918 in the little sector between the river [[Leie|Lys]] in French Flanders and the village of Grenay, near Lens, in Artois. The Loos memorial forms the rear and two sides of Dud Corner Cemetery, so called because of the high number of unexploded shells found there.&lt;ref&gt;Dud Corner Cemetery holds 1,812 burials with less than 700 unidentified and got its name from the large number of unexploded German shells found on the Gohelle Battlefield&lt;/ref&gt;

The thousands of names of the servicemen missing in action with no known grave are inscribed on 139 stone panels attached to these side and rear walls. The Loos Memorial was designed by [[Sir Herbert Baker]] with sculpture by [[Charles Wheeler (sculptor)|Charles Wheeler]]. Stone tablets containing the names of the missing are numbered from 1 to 139, starting at the north-west corner of the memorial and running around the walls to the south-west corner. It was unveiled by Sir Nevil Macready on 4 August 1930.

The Battle of Loos had opened on 25 September 1915. The 9th (Scottish) Division&lt;ref&gt;Of all the regiments listed on the Loos memorial, five Scottish Regiments are the most represented. There are 829 men listed from The Black Watch, 814 names listed from the Cameron Highlanders, 697 names listed from the Highland Light Infantry, 678 names listed from the Gordon Highlanders and 671 names listed from the Kings Own Scottish Borderers&lt;/ref&gt; scored one of the few successes by gaining a foothold on the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Fosse 8, the main observation posts used by the Germans to view the area and the 15th (Scottish) took Loos and pushed on to the Hill 70 Redoubt. However, the gains, won at such a horrific loss of life, had to be capitalized on quickly and the reserves (mostly inexperienced New Army Divisions) were brought into action too slowly. The Germans counter-attacked and by 27 September the offensive was breaking down and the Germans had retaken both the Hohenzollern Redoubt and Fosse 8. Attempts to retake these important positions were made on 13 October 1915, but failed after further heavy losses and by 19 October 1915, the battle petered to a halt. The British Army had lost over 20,000 men.

[[John French, 1st Earl of Ypres|Field Marshal Sir John French]], already being criticised before the battle, lost his remaining support in both the Government and Army as a result of the British failure at Loos and his perceived poor handling of his reserve divisions in the battle.&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, 2005 edition, pages 306-310&lt;/ref&gt; He was replaced by [[Douglas Haig, 1st Earl Haig|Douglas Haig]] as Commander of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] in December 1915.

The first use of gas by the British had not been a success but Kitchener's New Army had at least been "bloodied" and in every sense of the word. It has been estimated that more than 14,000 of those named on the walls of the Loos Memorial died in the Battle of Loos and that of the 8,500 who died on the first day, over 6,500 were to have no known grave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.westernfrontassociation.com/great-war-on-land/61-battlefields/1318-the-battle-of-loos-1915.html |title=The Battle of Loos 1915 |website=Remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatwar.co.uk/french-flanders-artois/memorial-loos-memorial.htm |title=Loos Memorial, Loos-en-Gohelle, France |website=Greatwar.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the dead on the British side at Loos were: [[Fergus Bowes-Lyon]], brother to [[Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother|Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] (later [[Queen consort|Queen Consort]], of George VI and "Queen Mother"), author and poet [[Rudyard Kipling|Rudyard Kipling's]] son, [[My Boy Jack (poem)|John]], and the poet [[Charles Sorley]].

"Loos was the fourth failure of 1915 for the British and this time losses reached almost 48,000 men; at Vimy the French figure was almost identical. In the wider Artois offensive the total was 143,567.".&lt;ref name=PB/&gt;

No further attacks were to take place in the Gohelle, Vimy and Arras sectors until the spring of 1917.

|[[Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée]] is a village some {{convert|27|km|mi}} north of Arras and about {{convert|5|km|mi}} west of La Bassée and the memorial to the 55th (West Lancashire) Division near to the Givenchy Communal Cemetery.  It was here in April 1918 that the 55th (West Lancashire) Division defended the village against three German Divisions. In April 1918, the [[6th Army (German Empire)|German 6th Army]] launched the second part of [[Erich Ludendorff|General Ludendorff]]'s strategic plan to win the war before the weight of the rapidly expanding American Army could be brought fully into action. Originally named George, it was later renamed Georgette. The encounter that followed is known as the [[Battle of the Lys (1918)|Battle of the Lys]]. The German attack commenced on 9 April 1918 and the 55th (West Lancashire) Division in front of Givenchy and the 2nd Portuguese Division at Neuve Chapelle took the blunt of the attack.

Because this sector of the front had been in British hands for years, the various zones of combat forming the 1918 styled defence system was far better prepared than that of Gough's Fifth Army (who had taken over an unprepared position from the French). However, the Portuguese were suspected to be capable of offering only a weak resistance and the British 40th Division (in front of Fromelles) and 34th Division at Armentières had both been badly mauled in Operation Michael on the Somme only weeks beforehand.

The Lancashire Territorials of the 55th Division found themselves confronted by the 4th Ersatz, 43rd Reserve and 18th Reserve Infantry Divisions on their own front while their immediate left flank was rapidly pushed in by the 1st Bavarian Reserve Division following the faster than anticipated collapse of the Portuguese 2nd Division. As the Germans pushed in and around them the Lancashire men fell back to their line of resistance along the road to Windy Corner, mounted counterattacks, and remained. The front by the following day looped around the top of Festubert and then turned north-west towards Locon. On 11 April, a second attempt was made to break the 55th Division but apart from a few hundred metres on its far left the assault by four German Divisions was repulsed.  Having made greater gains to the north around Merville and the Belgian border, the Germans began to concentrate their efforts in those areas. Ultimately their offensive would fail. The defenders of Givenchy had not ceded a metre.

The memorial itself is a {{convert|30|ft|m}}-high granite cross standing in a small park near Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée Communal Cemetery. The memorial includes the words{{Quotation|"They win or die. Who wear the rose of Lancaster"}} and records part of Sir Douglas Haig's Despatch of 20 July 1918{{Quotation|"Around this site from the 9th to the 16th April 1918 the Division, continuously attacked from the canal to Festubert by three German Divisions and with its left flank turned held its ground and inflicted severe loss upon the enemy,  This most gallant defence, the importance of which it would be hard to overestimate"}}

|Also at Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée is a memorial to Lieutenant Hillyar Hill-Trevor of the 1st Battalion of the Scots Guards who was killed in action on 21 December 1914. He has no known grave and is one of those named on the [[Le Touret Memorial]]. Hillyar George Edwin Hill-Trevor was the only son of the Hon. George Edwyn Hill-Trevor and his wife and a grandson of the first Lord Trevor of Chirk, North Wales. He was a direct descendant of Arthur, Duke of Wellington. The memorial stands on a carved base, set in a large curbed surround filled with granite chippings. The top of the column is inscribed {{Quotation|"For God and Country"}}, and across the base is written {{Quotation|"Thine O God he was and thine he is in perfect we leave him till we meet again"}} and on the centre of the base {{Quotation|"Close to this spot sleeps in eternal peace Hillyar George Edwin Hill-Trevor Lt Scots Guards beloved only child of the Honble George Edwyn &amp; Ethel Hill-Trevor of Brynkinalt Chirk England killed while gallantly leading his men Dec 21 1914 Aged 18 years"}}The memorial is cared for by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission. The sculptor of the memorial was [[William Reid Dick]] who provided much of the sculpture on the Menin Gate and was responsible for the Arras Flying Services Memorial. The female figure is a copy of that which he used for the Bushey War Memorial in England.

! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"| The Tunnelers' Memorial at Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée
|-
|This particular area lent itself to the digging of tunnels and both sides waged a "mining war".

The memorial at Givenchy-lès-la-Bassée commemorates the endeavours of the men of the Tunneling Companies of Britain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand who, during the Great War, lived, fought and died underground in France and Flanders. It was unveiled on 19 June 2010. It is erected in special remembrance of Sapper [[William Hackett (VC)]] of 254 Tunneling Company RE, and Private Thomas Collins of the 14th Battalion, The Welsh Regiment, who both still lie {{convert|40|ft|m}} beneath the field in front of this memorial.

The memorial comprises a British Lakeland slate panel whose dimensions are those of the Shaftsbury Gallery in which William Hackett VC and Thomas Collins still lie. The words are framed by drawings of the tunnelers mining equipment – including  canaries and mice. The circular base is the same diameter as the Shaftsbury Shaft by which the tunnelers descended into the gallery. William Hackett is commemorated on the [[Ploegsteert Memorial to the Missing|Ploegsteert Memorial]] in Belgium while Thomas Collins is listed on the [[Thiepval Memorial]].

|This monument is situated on the D 941 between Cambrin and Auchy les Mines. The 58e Division d'Infanterie were a Reserve Infantry Division and arrived in Cuinchy on 16 October 1914. The Germans had occupied a position along the Vermelles — Violaines Road opposite them. On the northern side of the canal was the British II Corps (later the Indian Corps). A constant run of battles was taking place trying to secure La Bassée and Givenchy with the British and French fighting side by side for much of the time. In these early months of the war the line was still fluid without real trenches and the French managed to advance their line by {{convert|700|m|yd}}. Over the next few days the Germans launched numerous counter-attacks; despite heavy losses the French held the line. As a result of these constant assaults in both directions, the first trenches were constructed in the area, though the word is used loosely because with a very high water table the trenches tended to be built up rather than dug down. On 12 November 1914 the Division received a citation {{Quotation|"Cette division a toujours été en première ligne, a gagné du terrain et n'en a jamais perdu, malgré de fortes pertes et des attaques violentes de l'ennemi"}}
{{Quotation|("This division has always been in the front line, has gained ground and never lost, despite heavy losses and violent attacks by the enemy.")}}
The 58th Infantry remained responsible for this sector of the line throughout the winter of 1914/1915. Alongside them were soldiers of the 141e régiment d'infanterie territorial (141st Territorial Regiment – made up of older soldiers who had already finished their term in the Reserve) of the 92e Division Territoriale. The Memorial was inaugurated on 31 August 1924. t comprises a block of granite surmounted by a French Army Adrian Helmet. The inscription on the memorial reads {{Quotation|"A la mémoire des braves de la 58e division morts pour la France"}}{{Quotation|("In memory of the brave men of the 58th Division who died for France".)}} and on the sides are listed the units which made up the Division: 295th, 285th, 256th et 281st Infantry and the 141st Territorials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmatters.net/txtpat/index.php?id=585 |title=58e Division d'Infanterie Memorial at Cuinchy |publisher=Webmatters |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sector 3 Artois: [[Notre Dame de Lorette|Loretto Heights]] and [[Vimy Ridge]]==
The south-eastern end of the [[Vimy Ridge]] the east of the ancient city of Arras. East of Arras the front line crossed farms and villages. Arras was evacuated by French forces on 29 August 1914 but reoccupied a month later. It remained in French hands throughout the war. Underneath the city there were tunnels and catacombs dug out of the chalk by the Romans. Some were used during the First World War by medical units and as safe shelter for Allied troops. The city was destroyed by German artillery bombardments from vantage points on the high ground.

"As the boundary of the clay plain of Flanders and the chalk uplands of Artois, the Vimy Ridge and its smaller cousin [[Notre Dame de Lorette]] created a formidable military barrier, a geological fracture destined to have a deep impact on the lives of soldiers struggling for topographical advantage."&lt;ref name=PB/&gt;  In 1914, the German Army had taken both these ridges and had occupied both Loos and Lens, and it was largely as a consequence of the efforts of French Alpine divisions, and troops from Senegal, that they were kept out of Arras. Once the front line had stabilised, Arras was left at the centre of a salient and open to constant artillery bombardment from the high ground to the north and south. The French were always sought to redress this situation and after an offensive in 1914 [[Ferdinand Foch|Foch]] launched the [[Second Battle of Artois]] from 9 May to 19 June 1915. The Germans were driven from Notre Dame de Lorette but a major break-through was not achieved. The Vimy Ridge and beyond it Douai remained in German hands. There was however to be little respite and 1915 was to see another offensive in the area, the Battle of Loos.

South of the coalfields around Lens, the Artois landscape gently rises up in a series of finger-like spurs. Two spurs of particularly high ground afford magnificent views in all directions. These spurs lie in a north-west to south-east direction and are located north-west of the city of Arras. They are known as the Loretto Heights (Notre Dame de Lorette) and the Vimy ridge.

! scope="col" style="width:950px;"| Notre Dame de Lorette and the Second Battle of Artois from 9 May to 18 June 1915
|-
|Preparations for the French offensive on Notre Dame de Lorette and Vimy Ridge began on 3 May 1915 with a sustained artillery bombardment which lasted over the following six days and nights. Then at 10 a.m. on 9 May, the 33rd Army Corps under the command of General [[Philippe Pétain]] attacked a {{convert|6|km|mi}} section of the German front. In just a few hours the attackers succeeded in overwhelming the German trenches and advancing {{convert|3|km|mi}} towards Vimy Ridge; however the reserves were too far back from the front to be able to reach the front lines quickly enough to capitalize on the breakthrough, and the French artillery was unable to provide cover for its foremost troops. The Germans soon reorganized and launched a counter-attack. Fighting on the heights of Notre-Dame-de-Lorette continued for a week with savage encounters but in the end the success of the French offensive was limited: the villages of Carency and Ablain-Saint-Nazaire were taken but Vimy Ridge, and thus the control of the coal basin beyond it, remained in German hands. The human cost of this great offensive, which resulted in no major strategic gain, was enormous for the French Army: it suffered 102,000 casualties, double the losses suffered by the Germans during all the French and British attacks between Arras and Festubert.

Almost 40,000 men who were killed in the First World War are honoured in the cemetery at Notre Dame de Lorette ('''Cimetière militaire Notre-Dame-de-Lorette''' or the '''Nécropole nationale de Notre-Dame-de-Lorette'''). This French military cemetery covers {{convert|13|ha|a}}. Almost 20,000 of the soldiers are buried in individual graves while the remains of 19,998 unidentified casualties were laid to rest in seven [[ossuary|ossuaries]] within the cemetery grounds. These seven ossuaries contain the remains of French servicemen brought into the cemetery from the Artois battlefields including single burials, burials in civilian cemeteries and small military burial sites within a radius of some {{convert|30|mi|km}} of Ablain St. Nazaire. It was not possible to identify these remains. The ossuaries are named after French military commanders.

Ossuaries Number 1 - 5 are located at the western end of the cemetery.
* Ossuary No. 1 named ''Fayolle'' contains 1,006 bodies
* Ossuary No. 2 named ''Franchet d'Esperey'' contains 1,892 bodies
* Ossuary No. 3 named ''Joffre'' contains 1,874 bodies
* Ossuary No. 4 named ''Lyautey'' contains 957 bodies
* Ossuary No. 5 named ''Pétain'' contains 1,029 bodies
There are another two ossuaries on the eastern side of the Lantern Tower.
* Ossuary No. 6 named ''Foch'' contains 4,563 bodies
* Ossuary No. 7 named ''Barbot'' contains 5,649 bodies
At the base of the Lantern Tower an eighth ossuary contains the remains of another 6,000 soldiers.

There is a plot at the western end of the cemetery for Muslim soldiers, and each grave has a headstone instead of a cross with each headstone facing east. North Africans from the 1st Moroccan Division fought in this area during the battles of 1915 for the high ground of Lorette and the ridge at Vimy.

General Ernest Barbot is also buried in the cemetery. He was Commander of the French 77th Mountain Division and was killed on the Artois battlefield at Souchez on 10 May 1915. This division had fought in the 1914 battles in the Alsace mountains and had been moved to Artois by early 1915. Barbot's grave marker was originally one created by his soldiers as a cross made out of shell casings retrieved from the battlefield but that cross was stolen in 1952 and was replaced with the same simple cross that marks the final resting place of so many of General Barbot's comrades in arms.

After dark the Lantern Tower sends a beacon of light across the surrounding countryside.  It revolves five times each minute and it is reckoned that its ray of light covers a distance of about {{convert|45|mi|km}}. This Lantern Tower was designed by [[Louis Cordonnier]] and the first stone was laid on 19 June 1921 by Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]]. The inauguration ceremony was held on 2 August 1925. The tower is {{convert|150|ft|m}} high with 200 steps. Until recently the tower was open to the public to climb to the stop, but now the viewing area at the top has been closed for security reasons. The base of the tower is a square with each side being {{convert|35|ft|m}} long. At the base of the tower there is an ossuary-crypt containing the remains of 6,000 soldiers and a Chapel of Rest. There are 32 coffins located in the Chapel of Rest in four groups of 8 coffins. Three coffins contain the remains of an unknown soldier from the Second World War (laid to rest here in July 1950), a soldier from the North African war (laid to rest here in October 1977), and the remains of a soldier from the Indochina war (laid to rest here in June 1980). A reliquary (a container for relics) was placed in the tower in April 1955, which contains soil and ashes from the concentration camps of World War II. Since 1920 Notre Dame de Lorette has been manned by a Voluntary Guard of Honour which welcomes visitors to the site and rekindles the Eternal Flame every Sunday. The Basilica which stands in the cemetery was constructed in the Byzantine style and is {{convert|46|m|yd}} long and {{convert|14|m|yd}} wide. The transept is {{convert|30|m|yd}} long. The construction of the Basilica was inspired by Monseigneur Eugene Julien, Bishop of Arras, who wanted it dedicated to all those who had fallen in this part of France. The interior of the Basilica, a vast and colourful mosaic, contains on its walls thousands of memorial plaques to both units and individuals who lost their lives for France. Six of the windows were donated by Britain as thanks for all the land given by France for British Cemeteries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com/visit-the-sites/the-front/french-national-war-cemetery-at-notre-dame-de-lorette-ablain-saint-nazaire.html |title=French National War Cemetery at Notre-Dame-de-Lorette - Ablain-Saint-Nazaire- Remembrance Trails of the Great War in Northern France |website=Remembrancetrails-northernfrance.com |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vimy Ridge===

===Early fighting for Vimy Ridge===
The ridge had fallen to the German Army in October 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Boire's 2007 book ''The Battlefield before the Canadians, 1914-1916'' refers&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Tenth Army (France)|French Tenth Army]] attempted to dislodge the Germans from the region during the [[Second Battle of Artois]] in May 1915 by attacking their positions at Vimy Ridge and [[Notre Dame de Lorette]].&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Hayes and Mike Bechthold ''Vimy Ridge: A Canadian Reassessment''. Waterloo: Wilfrid Laurier University Press. pp. 51–61. {{ISBN|0-88920-508-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; During the attack, the French 1st Moroccan Division briefly captured the height of the ridge, where the Vimy memorial is currently located, but was unable to hold it owing to a lack of reinforcements. (See photographs of the Moroccan memorial in the gallery below.) The French made another attempt during the [[Third Battle of Artois]] in September 1915, but were once again unsuccessful in capturing the top of the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Spencer Tucker's 1996 ''The European powers in the First World War: an encyclopedia'' Published in New York by Garland Publishing. {{ISBN|0-8153-0399-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1916 the British XVII Corps relieved the French Tenth Army from the sector and, on 21 May 1916, the German infantry attacked the British lines along a {{convert|1800|m|yd|adj=on}} front in an effort to force them from positions along the base of the ridge. The Germans captured several British-controlled tunnels and [[Mining (military)|mine]] craters before halting their advance and entrenching their positions. British counter-attacks on 22 May did not manage to change the situation, and in October 1916 the Canadian Corps relieved the British IV Corps and took up position along the western slopes of Vimy Ridge.

===The Battle of Vimy Ridge 9 to 12 April 1917===
The [[Canadian Corps]], commanded by Sir [[Julian Byng]], was ordered to seize Vimy Ridge in April 1917.

In the week leading up to the battle, Canadian and British artillery subjected the enemy positions on the ridge to a constant barrage and the new [[No. 106 fuze]], which allowed shells to explode on contact, as opposed to burying themselves in ground, facilitated the destruction of hardened defences and barbed wire.

The four Canadian divisions involved stormed the ridge at 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. on 9 April 1917. The Canadians showed great bravery and Hill 145, the highest and most important feature of the Ridge, and where the Vimy monument now stands, was captured in a frontal bayonet charge against machine-gun positions. After a further three days of fighting the Canadians were victorious. Victory was however achieved at a great cost with 3,598 Canadians killed and another 7,000 wounded.

The capture of Vimy was more than just an important battlefield victory. For the first time all four Canadian divisions attacked together: men from all regions of Canada were present at the battle. Brigadier-General A.E. Ross declared after the war, "in those few minutes I witnessed the birth of a nation."

In 1922, the French government ceded Vimy Ridge to Canada in perpetuity together with the land surrounding it. The gleaming white marble and haunting sculptures of the Vimy Memorial, unveiled in 1936, stand as a terrible and poignant reminder of the 11,285 Canadian soldiers killed in France who have no known graves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warmuseum.ca/cwm/exhibitions/vimy/index_e.shtml |title=The Battle of Vimy Ridge April 9-12, 1917 - The First World War |website=WarMuseum.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Vimy Memorial===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px"| The Vimy Memorial
|-
|The Vimy memorial itself&lt;ref&gt;[[Canadian National Vimy Memorial#Pierce|Vimy Memorial]] Wikipedia. Retrieved 27 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt; is the centrepiece of the {{convert|100|ha|acre|adj=on}} preserved battlefield park. The memorial took [[Walter Seymour Allward]] eleven years to build. [[King Edward VIII]] unveiled the memorial on 26 July 1936, in the presence of the [[President of France|French President]] [[Albert Lebrun]], together with 50,000 or more Canadian and French veterans, and their families. Following an extensive multi-year restoration, Queen [[Elizabeth II]] rededicated the memorial on 9 April 2007 during a ceremony commemorating the 90th anniversary of the battle.

Allward chose the highest point on the Vimy Ridge, Hill 145, as the most suitable location for the memorial. The front wall of the monument is {{convert|7.3|m|ft}} high and is meant to represent an "impenetrable wall of defence". There is a group of figures at each end of this wall next to the base of the steps. One group is entitled "Breaking of the Sword" and is located at the southern corner of this wall and at the northern corner is the composition entitled "Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless". Collectively these two groups are the "Defenders" and represent the ideals for which Canadians gave their lives during the war. There is a cannon barrel draped in laurel and olive branches carved into the wall above each group, this to symbolize peace. "Breaking of the Sword" depicts three young men, one of whom is crouching and in the act of breaking his sword, this representing the defeat of militarism and the general desire for peace. The original idea was for one figure to be shown crushing a German helmet with his foot but Allward later decided not to use this because of its overtly militaristic imagery. In "Sympathy of the Canadians for the Helpless", one man representing Canada stands erect while three other figures, stricken by hunger or disease, crouch and kneel around him. The standing man represents Canada's sympathy for the weak and oppressed; the helpless.

At the top of this front wall stands the figure of a cloaked young female, her head bowed and her eyes cast down. Her chin rests in one hand. Below her and at ground level is a sarcophagus which bears a [[Brodie helmet]], a sword and is draped in laurel branches. This figure is known as "Canada Bereft" or "Mother Canada". The young nation of Canada mourns her dead. The statue was carved by the Italian sculptor Luigi Rigamonti. The statue, a reference to traditional images of the {{lang|la|[[Mater Dolorosa]]}} and presented in a similar style to that of [[Michelangelo]]'s [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|Pietà]], faces eastward looking out to the dawn of the new day. Unlike the other statues on the monument, stonemasons carved "Canada Bereft" from a single 30&amp;nbsp;tonne block of stone.  The statue is the largest single piece in the monument and serves as a focal point. The twin pylons rise to a height 30&amp;nbsp;metres above the memorial's stone platform. The twin white pylons, one bearing the [[maple leaf]] for Canada and the other the [[fleur-de-lys]] for France, symbolize the unity and sacrifice of both countries. At the top of the two pylons is a grouping of figures known collectively as the "Chorus". The most senior figures represent "Justice" and "Peace". "Peace" stands with a torch upraised, making it the highest point in the region. These two works are in a style similar to Allward's previously commissioned statues of "Truth" and "Justice", located outside the [[Supreme Court of Canada]] in [[Ottawa]]. The figures of "Hope", "Charity", "Honour" and "Faith" are located below "Justice" and "Peace" on the eastern side, with "Truth" and "Knowledge" on the western side.   Around these figures are the shields of Canada, Britain and France. Large crosses adorn the outside of each pylon. The First World War battle honours of the Canadian regiments and a dedicatory inscription to Canada's war dead, in both French and English, also appear on the monument. At the base of the monument and between the two pylons is the "Spirit of Sacrifice" Here a young dying soldier is gazing upward in a crucifixion-like pose, having thrown his torch to a comrade who holds it aloft behind him. In a lightly veiled reference to the poem "[[In Flanders Fields]]" by [[John McCrae]], the torch is passed from one comrade to another in an effort to keep alive the memory of the war dead.

The "Mourning Parents", one male and one female figure, are reclining on either side of the western steps on the reverse side of the monument. They represent the mourning mothers and fathers of the nation and are thought to be based on the four statues by Michelangelo on the [[Basilica of San Lorenzo, Florence#Cappelle Medicee|Medici Tomb]] in [[Florence]], [[Italy]]. Inscribed on the outside wall of the monument are the names of the 11,285 Canadians killed in France, and whose final resting place is unknown. Most Commonwealth War Graves Commission memorials present names in a descending list format. Allward sought to present the names as a seamless list and decided to do so by inscribing the names in continuous bands, across both vertical and horizontal seams, around the base of the monument. The memorial contains the names of four posthumous Victoria Cross recipients; [[Robert Grierson Combe]], [[Frederick Hobson]], [[William Johnstone Milne]] and [[Robert Spall]].&lt;ref name="VCs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vac-acc.gc.ca/remembers/sub.cfm?source=feature/vimy90/media/backgrounders/vimyvc |title=Remembrance - Veterans Affairs Canada |website=Vac-acc.gc.ca |date=2015-12-11 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The cemetery, near Souchez, is one of the largest British cemeteries on the Western Front and was begun as a cemetery in 1916. After the armistice it received bodies from small cemeteries and individual graves on the battlefields of Arras and other points in the Artois area. It holds: 6,800 British, 750 Canadian, more than 100 Australian, over 40 South African and 15 Indian graves. The majority are unidentified. The cemetery and the massive domed shelter at the entrance were designed by Frank Higginson. Higginson was a former Canadian Army officer who worked as an architect for the Commonwealth War Graves Commission in the 1920s and later acted as Secretary to the Commission; a bronze plaque in his memory is placed on the wall of the shelter building. German forces had seized the village of Souchez and the surrounding countryside as they advanced through Northern France in 1914. German artillery units were able to control this sector of the front from the high ground which flanked the village – Vimy Ridge to the east, and Lorette to the west. After 12 months of bitter fighting, French forces captured the high ground at Lorette in the autumn of 1915 but when they handed this part of the line to the Commonwealth forces in March 1916, Vimy Ridge was still in German hands. Vimy Ridge was certainly the key to the German defensive system in this sector and it protected an area of occupied France in which coal mines and factories were in full production for the German war effort; the fortified vantage points on the ridge dominated the surrounding battlefields. The Battle of Vimy Ridge formed part of the opening phase of the British-led Battle of Arras which began on 9 April 1917. The Canadian forces managed to capture most of the German positions on the ridge on the first day of the attack, and by 12 April they had occupied the village of Thélus and pushed the Germans back to the Oppy-Méricourt line. By taking the ridge the Canadians achieved a major tactical success, but in just four days of fighting they suffered over 10,000 casualties, 3,500 of whom were killed. The battle was the first action in which all four divisions of the Canadian Corps fought together.

On 25 May 2000 the remains of an unknown Canadian soldier were exhumed and handed to representatives of Canada at a ceremony held at the Vimy Memorial. These remains were laid to rest within the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in a [[sarcophagus]] placed at the foot of the [[National War Memorial (Canada)|National War Memorial]] in Ottawa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/64600/CABARET-ROUGE%20BRITISH%20CEMETERY,%20SOUCHEZ |title=Cemetery Details |publisher=CWGC |date=1917-04-09 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A focal point for remembrance, he represents more than 116,000 Canadians who lost their lives during the First World War.

In La Targette village is the "Torch" memorial shown here. A hand bearing a torch emerges from a heap of rubble, representing the hand of a dead soldier; there is an identification tag on the wrist of the hand which carries the date 5 May 1915, and in front is a plaque, which invites the passerby to ponder on the many dead who died in this corner of France. {{Quotation|"Ô vivants qui passez près de ce flambeau, qui dresse son symbole aux champs des hécatombes, Attardez vos regards sur ce sol plein de tombes et soyez à nos morts dont le cœur était beau"}}{{Quotation|("O living people who pass by this torch, which draws his symbol in the fields of hecatombs, rest your eyes on this ground full of graves of our dead whose hearts were beautiful.")}}

The monument was erected in 1932 in memory of the men who fought in the area from May to June 1915. Rubble from houses in the village which had been destroyed during the war was used for the base of the monument.

|-
|There is a large French war cemetery at La Targette. Many of the dead buried here would have taken part in the French Army's offensive of 9 May 1915 when the French used Neuville St Vaast as an important stepping stone in the operation to take Vimy Ridge. The Germans had heavily fortified the village with four lines of defence and each of its 150 houses bristled with cannon and machine guns. The labyrinth of trenches at the entrance to the village, flanked with forts and blockhouses, was thought to be impregnable; however slowly but surely French troops gained the position on 17 June 1915 at a cost of thousands of soldiers, many of whom were laid to rest in La Targette Cemetery. The French Army had recovered a Neuville-Saint-Vaast in ruins and taken Lorette Spur but Vimy Ridge still remained in German hands. In March 1916 the British Army relieved the French 10th Army at Arras and Canadian forces took charge at Vimy. Thenceforth began the preparation for an attack on Vimy Ridge which saw the excavation of a vast network of twelve tunnels up to the German lines. On 9 April 1917, in heavy snow, four Canadian divisions launched what was to be a successful attack on Vimy Ridge. The place known as Aux-Rietz was the forward command post for the 2nd Canadian Division and the artillery units who were given the job of providing cover for the soldiers on the ridge.

! scope="col" style="width:950px;"|The German Cemetery at Neuville Saint Vaast known as "La Maison Blanche"
|-
|The Maison Blanche or Neuville-Saint-Vaast German War Cemetery was established at the end of the First World War and is the largest German war cemetery in France. It is the final resting place for 44,833 German soldiers of which 8,040 were never identified and were buried in a common grave. The bodies of the dead were originally buried in small cemeteries close to the Western Front, spread over more than 110 villages in Pas-de-Calais. Most of the soldiers had died in the intense fighting in Artois, on the Lorette Spur (1914-1915) and Vimy Ridge. In 1926, the French Government allowed the German War Graves Commission, the [[Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge]] (VDK), to carry out work on the cemetery but under its supervision. The VDK transformed what had until then been just a field into a proper war cemetery. Since 1966 the maintenance of the German War Cemeteries has been the responsibility of the VDK alone. Between 1975 and 1983 the VDK completely redesigned the cemetery and cast-iron crosses replaced the wooden ones, each one engraved with the names of four soldiers, and stone headstones were introduced for Jewish soldiers buried there. There is a monument in "La Maison Blance" with the inscription "ICH HATT EINEN KAMERADEN.EINEN BESSERN FINDST DU NICHT"- "I had a comrade; you could not find a better one". This monument is dedicated to the men of the 164th Infantry Regiment. The words are from the poem by Ludwig Uhland "Der Gute Kamerad.

|The Czechoslovakian Memorial and Cemetery are located just outside Neuville-Saint-Vaast and within the small cemetery lay the remains of 206 Czechoslovakians; 70 from the First World War and 136 from the Second (Including 29 airman). Czechs and Slovaks were minorities within the Austro-Hungarian Empire and, at the declaration of war in 1914, hundreds living in France took the decision to fight for France within the ranks of the Foreign Legion. At the beginning of May each year there is a short ceremony at the cemetery which was enlarged in 1970 by the consolidation of all Czech and Slovak nationals buried in France. They formed the Nazdar Company (coming from their battle cry meaning: "Hello"). On 9 May 1915, the Company would lose 50 men killed and 150 wounded out of a strength of 250. (A photograph of the Czech memorial is shown here.) These volunteers took part in the Artois offensive launched by the French on 9 May 1915 and many lost their lives in that battle. At the entrance to the Czech cemetery stands a monument to commemorate the standard-bearer Karel Bezdicek who was killed on the first day of fighting. He is remembered by his fellows as the first free Czech soldier to carry the standard of the Czech lion.

On the other side of the road, the cross of the Polish volunteers (paid for by donations from the Polish communities of Pas-de-Calais) pays tribute to those who 'gave their lives for the resurrection of Poland and the victory of France'. Despite being destroyed in 1940 and storm-damaged in 1967, the monument has been rebuilt and bears the motto "Za wolność naszą i waszą" which means "For our freedom and yours".

|Next to Bailleul Road East Cemetery is the Saint-Laurent-Blangy Cemetery which was begun in the early 1920s by the French as a concentration cemetery for the German soldiers who fell in the fighting south of Arras. It also contains a mass grave for unidentified soldiers. It was in 1926 that the Volksbund Deutsche Kriegsgräberfürsorge (VDK, German war graves commission) received permission from the French authorities to plant trees on the site and in later years the VDK, were able to carry out further improvements including the replacements of the wooden crosses by metal ones. The cemetery is the last resting place for 31,939 German soldiers who died in the Great War, including 7,069 individual graves and a mass grave containing 24,870 bodies of which 11,587 were never identified. The names of the soldiers who do not have individual graves are engraved on black metal panels which are displayed on either side of a small path alongside the ossuary. The graves of Jewish soldiers are marked with headstones bearing the Star of David and an inscription in Hebrew which reads, 'Here lies [name of the soldier], may his soul be bound to the circle of the living'. In 1956, building works forced the closure of the German extension to Comines Cemetery, near Lille, and the remains of 4,283 German soldiers were moved to Saint-Laurent. However the memorial erected in their honour still stands in Comines Cemetery.

===The Arras Memorial and the Flying Services Memorial and the Battle of Arras===
The '''Battle of Arras''' was a [[British Empire|British]] offensive during the [[First World War]]. From 9 April to 16 May 1917, British, Canadian, New Zealand, Dominion of Newfoundland, and Australian troops attacked German defences near the city of [[Arras, France|Arras]].

At this phase of the war, the Allied objective was to end the stalemate of the trenches and break through the German defences into the open ground beyond and engage the numerically inferior German army in a [[Maneuver warfare|war of movement]]. The French High Command's plan was to launch a massive attack (the ''[[Nivelle Offensive]]'') about {{convert|80|km|mi}} to the south of the British sector in the Aisne region and at Arras the Allied objectives were to draw German troops away from the ground chosen for the French attack and to take the German-held high ground that dominated the plain of Douai. The British effort was a relatively broad front assault between [[Vimy]] in the northwest and [[Bullecourt]] in the southeast. After considerable bombardment, Canadian troops advancing in the north were able to capture the strategically significant [[Vimy Ridge]] and British divisions in the centre were also able to make significant gains astride the Scarpe river. In the south, British and Australian forces were frustrated by the [[defence in depth|elastic defence]] and made only minimal gains. When the battle officially ended on 16 May, British Empire troops had made significant advances but had been unable to achieve a breakthrough and the stalemate of the trenches returned.

The Battle of Arras is normally divided into two phases. Phase one would embrace three encounters: the First Battle of the Scarpe which ran from 9 to 14 April 1917; the First Battle of Vimy Ridge from 9 to 12 April 1917; and the First Battle of Bullecourt from 10 to 11 April 1917.

The Second phase would embrace the Battle of Lagnicourt on 15 April 1917; the Second Battle of the Scarpe from 23 to 24 April 1917; the Battle of Arleux from 28 to 29 April 1917; the Second Battle of Bullecourt from 3 to 19 May 1917; and the Third Battle of the Scarpe from 3 to 4 May 1917.

A great deal of ground was gained for relatively few casualties in the first two days and a number of strategically significant points were captured, notably Vimy Ridge. Additionally, the offensive succeeded in drawing German troops away from the French offensive in the Aisne sector. In many respects, the battle might be deemed a victory for the British and their allies but these gains were offset by high casualties and the ultimate failure of the French offensive at the Aisne.

[[Siegfried Sassoon]] makes reference to the battle in his famous anti-war poem "The General" in which he derides the incompetence of the British military staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/greatwar/sassoon/ |accessdate=10 January 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130228160616/http://www.warpoets.org/conflicts/greatwar/sassoon/ |archivedate=28 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-Welsh lyric poet, [[Edward Thomas (poet)|Edward Thomas]] was killed by a shell on 9 April 1917, during the first day of the Easter Offensive. Thomas's war diary gives a vivid and poignant picture of life on the Western front in the months leading up to the battle.

Sassoon's poem read-
&lt;poem&gt;
'Good-morning; good-morning!' the General said
When we met him last week on our way to the line.
Now the soldiers he smiled at are most of 'em dead,
And we're cursing his staff for incompetent swine.
'He's a cheery old card,' grunted Harry to Jack
As they slogged up to Arras with rifle and pack.
                  *          *          *
But he did for them both by his plan of attack.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===The Arras Memorial===

! scope="col" style="width:950px;"|The Arras Memorial
|-
|The Arras Memorial is to be found in the western part of Arras, and commemorates almost 35,000 servicemen from the United Kingdom, South Africa, and New Zealand who died in the Arras sector between the spring of 1916 and August 1918, the eve of the "advance to victory", who have no known grave. Alongside the Arras Memorial is The Arras Flying Services Memorial. This commemorates nearly 1,000 airmen of the Royal Naval Air Service, the Royal Flying Corps, and the Royal Air Force, either by attachment from other arms of the forces of the Commonwealth, or by original enlistment, who were killed on the whole of the Western Front and who have no known grave.

Two files held at The National Archives in Kew,  ADM 116/2906 and AIR 2/9244 provide background information on the unveiling ceremony and ADM 116/2906 contains an "Introduction to the register of THE ARRAS MEMORIAL at Faubourg-D'Amiens Cemetery, Arras, France" Memorial register 20. This was published by the Commonwealth Graves Commission and contains much valuable information. File ADM116/2906 indicates that Captain R. Bell Davies, V.C., D.S.O., A.F.C., R.N, represented the Admiralty at the Arras unveiling ceremony on 31 July 1932.

File AIR 2/9244 provides background information on the Arras unveiling from the Air Ministry perspective also the Thiepval Memorial. The file contains a selection of press cuttings covering the Arrras and Thiepval unveilings. The file notes that The Lord Trenchard, G.C.B., D.S.O., carried out the Arras unveiling and also laid the wreath at Thiepval on behalf the RAF. Sir [[William Reid Dick]], the Scottish sculptor, was responsible for the globe on top of the Arras Flying Services Memorial. He carved both the badges on the memorial and the great globe, which is {{convert|4.5|ft|m}} in diameter and weighs almost three tons. The memorial consists of an obelisk with a globe forming a finial on the top. The badges are those of the Royal Flying Corps, Royal Air Force, Royal Naval Air Service, and the combined badges of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. File AIR 1/677/21/13/1891 provides further background information on the Arras Memorial. It contains a draft of the Introduction to the Register of the Imperial War Graves Commission (now the Commonwealth War Graves Commission) written by their Director of Records, Major H.F. Chettle. Chettle's covering letter is dated 18 March 1930. The two Memorials and the lay-out of the cemetery are the work of Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]].

The Arras Flying Services Memorial includes amongst the men remembered a winner of the Victoria Cross, [[Mick Mannock|Edward "Mick" Mannock]] who died on 26 July 1918 aged 31.

Amongst those commemorated on the Arras Memorial are T/2nd Lieutenant [[Richard Basil Brandram Jones]],  [[John MacLaren Erskine|Sergeant John Erskine]],  T/2nd [[Jack Harrison (VC)|Lieutenant John Harrison]], Corporal [[George Jarratt]], Sergeant [[Albert White (VC)|Albert White]] and  A/Company Sergeant-Major [[Alexander Edwards]], all winners of the [[Victoria Cross]].

|-
! scope="col" style="width:1000px;"| Memorial to the New Zealand Tunnelers at Arras
|-
|At Arras there is a memorial to New Zealand tunnelers who built a vast underground city used by thousands of British troops during WW1. The tunnel network under the city of Arras in northern France was built between 1916 and 1918 by members of the [[New Zealand Tunnelling Company]], who were specially recruited from the gold and coal mining districts of New Zealand. The 400-strong Kiwi tunnellers, who had undertaken only basic military training, worked to combat the Germans, burrowing under no-man's land to blow up and destroy the enemy trenches above.

New Zealand's Ambassador to France, Sarah Dennis, who unveiled the memorial said{{Quotation|"This memorial is a welcome and fitting tribute to the courage and tenacity of the New Zealand Tunnelling Company. The scale and resilience of the network they constructed is remarkable: Arras deserves its prominent place in New Zealand's shared memories of World War One"}}

The memorial is dedicated to the memory of the 41 New Zealand tunnelers who lost their lives at Arras and the 151 who were wounded – many who were buried under tonnes of rubble from German counter-mining.

The Kiwi tunnelers joined a number of large chalk quarries built in medieval times to develop two tunnel systems running under the main roads of Arras. In one tunnel system each cave is named after a New Zealand town – Russell, Auckland, New Plymouth, Wellington, Nelson, Blenheim, Christchurch, Dunedin, and finally, just before the German front line, Bluff.

Working parties to assist the tunnellers were sent from the New Zealand Division and included Maori and Pacific Islanders of the New Zealand Pioneer Battalion. Through the winter of 1916, as the town of Arras above was destroyed by German artillery, the underground city grew large enough to accommodate 20,000 men. There was running water, electric lighting, kitchens, latrines, a light rail system and a medical centre with a fully equipped operating theatre. On 9 April 1917, 15,000 men moved through the tunnels to launch the Battle of Arras. The New Zealand tunnelers remained in France, repairing roads, developing other tunnel systems, and building and repairing bridges. They returned to New Zealand in March 1919.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzdf.mil.nz/news/media-releases/20070412-mtbnz ]{{dead link|date=May 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Memorial to General Ernest Barbot at Souchez===
{| class="wikitable sortable"
|-
! scope="col" style="width:950px;"| Memorial to General Ernest Barbot at Souchez
|-
|Near to the Cabaret Rouge Cemetery and {{convert|12|km|mi}} from Arras is the village of Souchez and the memorial to Général Ernest Barbot.

Ernest Jacques Barbot was born on 19 August 1855 at Toulouse. He graduated as a Second Lieutenant on 1 October 1877 and slowly climbed the ranks. In September 1912 he became the Colonel of the 159e RIA (they were known as the 15-9, Quinze-Neuf). By the age of fifty-seven he had lost both his wife and son and would devote the rest of his life to his ''Grelus'' as people from the high Alps are called.

Once Italy had declared its neutrality, the 159e RIA was transferred from the Franco-Italian frontier to Alsace and their accomplishments soon brought Barbot to the attention of his senior officers. Having already effectively taken over command of his own brigade he was promoted to Général de Brigade on 8 September 1914. To this was added a second brigade, creating what was designated as the Division Barbot. In September 1914 his Division was transferred to the Artois Front and officially designated the "77e Division d'Infanterie". In the battle for Arras, Barbot's convictions and his soldiers' tenacity were fundamental in saving the town from occupation by the Germans.

As the German line continued to encircle Arras to the north, Barbot and his Division found themselves transferred to the area in front of Souchez – their Corps was now officially designated the 33e CA and was commanded by Général Philippe Pétain. As a Colonel Petain had commanded the Arras Regiment (33e RI) and one of his young lieutenants was [[Charles de Gaulle]]. On 9 May 1915 the 2nd Battle of Artois was launched by the French against the hills of Notre Dame de Lorette and Vimy.

On its right the Moroccan Division stormed across the plain and took Vimy Ridge, {{convert|4|km|mi}} away, in a single rush. In the centre, Barbot's men made superb gains getting as far as Hill 119, Givenchy and the outskirts of Souchez. Hill 119 became known as "The Pimple" to the Canadians in 1917 and is the steep hill immediately opposite the site of Barbot's monument. Unfortunately the speed of their advance proved to be the 77e DI's undoing and under violent bombardment they were forced to retire from Givenchy, back as far as the Cabaret Rouge on the hill above Souchez. (Near the site of the CWGC Cemetery).

Barbot installed his HQ in a rough trench at Cabaret Rouge despite the fact that the position was still under bombardment. On 10 May 1915 at about 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. while dashing across the open ground to talk to one of his colonels Barbot was hit by shrapnel. With a severe chest wound and a broken arm, he was carried back to Berthonval Wood (just in front of Mont St Eloi) and from there transported by car to the Dressing Station at Villers-Châtel. The surgeons found that they could do nothing for him. General d'Urbal dispatched a staff office to award Barbot the Cross of a Commander of the [[Legion of Honour]] and he died a short time later. His last words were recorded as {{Quotation|"Glorious Day. Victory!"}}
The Barbot Memorial was designed by Paul Dechin and sculpted by his father [[Jules Dechin]]. Work began in 1935 under a committee headed by General Pétain, and the monument was inaugurated on Sunday 9 May 1937 in the presence of numerous VIPs and thousands of veterans of the Alpine Division. The statue is not only dedicated to General Barbot himself, as commander of the 77e DI, but also to his men who fell in Artois between 1 October 1914 and 20 February 1916. Dechin depicts Barbot standing with a hand in between two buttons of his greatcoat (like Napoleon) and a gesture of his right hand suggests that he is trying to protect his soldiers who can be seen climbing up out of their trenches in berets — there were no steel helmets in 1915.

On either side of the monument are two commemorative plaques. One is to General Plessier who had preceded Barbot as commander of the 77e DI and was the first General killed in action (at Alsace on 19 August 1914), the other to General Stirn who took over on Barbot's death but was himself killed two days later.

A story recounted in the Regimental History and perhaps apocryphal is of an ordinary soldier encountering the elderly Barbot in the trenches. He asked Barbot why on earth he had not been demobilised considering his age and Barbot replied{{Quotation|"They won't let me.
Why ever not ?  Because I'm the General"}}

|Point du Jour lies to the north east of Arras and in fighting there on 9 April 1917, the 34th Division tried to take a German [[redoubt]]. The {{convert|30|ft|m}} foott high memorial commemorates that division's fighting in the area including a successful advance along the north bank of the River Scarpe towards Fampoux. The memorial is built in the Highland manner from blocks of granite and has the inscription{{Quotation|"Remember with honour the 9th Scottish Division who on the fields of France and Flanders 1915-1918 served well"}}In recent years access to this site has been difficult due to the fast Arras - Douai road close by, and in late 2006 the Commonwealth War Graves Commission moved the memorial to a new site alongside the Point du Jour Military Cemetery. Access to this memorial is now via Fampoux, from the direction of nearby Athies. Some of the memorial stones have been damaged, and it seems the section of preserved trench is lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://battlefields1418.50megs.com/9divmemorial.htm |title=9th Scottish Division Memorial, Point du Jour, Arras |website=Battlefields1418.50megs.com |date=2014-11-21 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|File WO 32/5881 held at The National Archives in Kew covers the years 1919 to 1922 and provides some background information on the memorial to the 64th Infantry Brigade which now stands in Cojeul British Cemetery, St Martin-sur-Cojeul, near Arras. Originally a wooden cross had been raised to commemorate those men of the 64th Brigade who had fallen in 1917. This wooden cross was replaced by a stone cross in 1931, the wooden cross being removed for safe keeping to [[Beverley Minster]] in York. At a later date the stone cross was moved to the cemetery at Cojeul when a motorway was built in the area. The dedication reads {{Quotation|“To the honoured memory of the officers and men of the 64th Infantry Brigade who fell on April 9th 1917 in capturing the part of the Hindenburg line close to this place”}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.21stdivision1914-18.org/64thbrigadememorial.htm |title=64th brigade memorial - 21st Division 1914-18...a divisional history |website=21stdivision1914-18.org |date=1917-04-09 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|The memorial comprises a very tall [[obelisk]], with tall iron railings around it, and the pelican motif of the Division carved on two of its corners.  The Division's battle honours are recorded on the sides of the memorial, including [[Havrincourt]] from 1917.
The 62nd Division attacked in a north-easterly direction through and either side of the village on 20 November 1917, with the Canal du Nord on the left as the Divisional boundary. The [[Hindenburg Line]] was very strong here but they had fifty tanks to support them (although there should have been more than sixty according to the plans). It took them 30 minutes to reach the Hindenburg Line, and take this (it curved south-east of the village), and by 8.15 a.m. they had reached the Blue Line - {{convert|2000|yd|m}} on from their start point, although resistance continued in Havrincourt village for some time. By 11 a.m. the Division were advancing on the next objective, the Brown Line, and by the end of the day 186 Brigade had reached Graincourt, an advance of around {{convert|7000|yd|m}} from the starting position.
The village of Havrincourt was lost in March 1918 during the major German offensive. The 62nd Division again retook the village on 12 September 1918 and held it despite German counter-offensives. The 62nd Division has a strong association with the area, and this explains the decision to place their memorial here. Some of their men from both the above encounters lie in the cemetery nearby.
File WO 32/5855 held at The National Archives at Kew covers the memorial to the 62nd Division at Havrincourt. The unveiling took place on 7 June 1922 and was carried out by General Berthelot under whose command the 62nd Division took part in the Second Battle of the Marne in July 1918. The file contains a list of all the men who took part in the unveiling.&lt;ref name="ww1battlefields1"/&gt;

|-
|On 25 August 1914 the German Army entered Cambrai and remained there until 9 October 1918, when Canadian Forces liberated the town. The Battle of Cambrai was launched by the British Army on 20 November 1917, and was to grind to a halt {{convert|6|km|mi}} from Cambrai with massive losses suffered on both sides. The subsequent German counter-attack pushed the Allies back to their starting position. This battle is generally regarded as the first major battle of the First World War in which tanks were used. Until then the pattern was for battles to begin with a sustained artillery bombardment to hopefully break through the German barbed-wire defences with the infantry following under cover of smoke barrages. The Cambrai battle began on 20 November 1917 with great initial success, but a halt called for "rest and reorganisation" on 22 November 1917 allowed the Germans time to take stock and reinforce. From 23 to 28 November the fighting was concentrated almost entirely around Bourlon Wood and by 29 November 1917, the Germans had mounted a major counter-attack and during fierce fighting over the next five days, succeeded in gaining much of the ground they had lost when the attack was launched. The tank had been no more successful in breaking through the German barbed wire than had been the artillery bombardments on the Somme in 1916 and at other battles. The inscription on the Memorial reads{{Quotation|"To the glory of God and to the enduring memory of 7048 Officers and men of the Forces of the British Empire who fell at the Battle of Cambrai 20 November - 3 December 1917 but who have no known grave Their names are here recorded."}}This engagement and many of the losses sustained is remembered by the Cambrai Memorial in the cemetery at Louverval. This memorial commemorates the 7,048 officers and men of the British and South African Armies who were to perish in the course of the Battle of Cambrai in 1917 but who have no known grave. The memorial was designed by H. Charlton Bradshaw and has two [[relief|bas-reliefs]] by [[Charles Sargeant Jagger]] one depicting a wounded man being lifted from a trench and in the other a soldier is shown looking through a [[periscope]].

|Many of the dead from the Cambrai battle are buried in the Solesmes road cemetery which embraces both a German War Cemetery and a cemetery containing British and Commonwealth casualties as well as those from France. The German War Cemetery holds the graves of 7,939 German soldiers who lie in graves marked by white crosses, the original black crosses having been replaced in 1977. The remains of an additional 2,746 men are buried in the cemetery ossuary. Part of the cemetery is the Cambrai East Military Cemetery, which contains the graves of 501 Commonwealth soldiers and another corner is devoted to the dead of the French Army, mostly Russians. This cemetery had been started by the Germans during their occupation, and had been handed over to the city of Cambrai by the Bavarian Commandant for their care and maintenance. In the cemetery's centre is a large cross with a surrounding wall surmounted with a German and French military helmet. This was one of the many monuments erected by the Germans.

|A commemoration made by the men from [[Dominion of Newfoundland|Newfoundland]] is to be found in the village of Monchy Le Preux. On the ruins of what was a German bunker stands a bronze caribou which faces a point known at the time of the Great War as "Infantry Hill". This is the Newfoundland Regiment Memorial, or "Caribou" memorial. Here on 14 April 1917, companies A, C and D of the 1st Battalion Newfoundland Regiment, along with the 1st Essex both of the 88th Brigade/29th Division, were assigned the capture of Infantry Hill. At 5:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. both battalions advanced behind a creeping artillery barrage. The Newfoundlanders reached the foot of the hill despite heavy German machine gun and artillery fire. As they reached the top of the hill they were met by three German battalions, one in front and one each to the left and right. The Newfoundlanders were virtually surrounded and by 9:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. the situation was hopeless. The surviving groups of men were forced to surrender. The Newfoundlanders' losses were second only to their casualties suffered on 1 July 1916 at Beaumont-Hamel on the Somme. On 14 April 1917, 166 Newfoundlanders lost their lives, a further 141 men were wounded and 153 captured. The Caribou Memorial commemorates that action.

After leaving the Amiens front, the Canadian Corps liberated 54 towns and villages on some 3000 square kilometres (1158 square miles) of French soil, but in the process suffered more than 20,000 casualties. The Bourlon Wood Memorial commemorates the attack by Canadian Forces on the Canal du Nord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/65904/Bourlon%20Wood%20Cemetery |title=Cemetery Details |publisher=CWGC |date=1918-09-27 |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Canadian Battlefield Monument Commission, established after the Great War, was appointed to select the location and design of the memorials to commemorate [[List of Canadian battles during the First World War|Canadian participation]] in the First World War. The [[Canadian National Vimy Memorial]] at [[Battle of Vimy Ridge|Vimy Ridge]] was selected as the national memorial site and seven other locations at [[Hill 62 Memorial|Hill 62]], [[Saint Julien Memorial|St. Julien]] and [[Passchendaele Memorial|Passchendaele]] in [[Belgium]], as well as [[Le Quesnel Memorial|Le Quesnel]], [[Dury Memorial|Dury]], [[Courcelette Memorial|Courcelette]] and Bourlon Wood in France were chosen to commemorate significant battles the [[Canadian Expeditionary Force]] had engaged in.

|Bullecourt had seen two battles. The first Battle of Bullecourt took place on 11 April 1917 and saw the decimation of the Australian 4th Division. The second Battle of Bullecourt took place on 8 May 1917 and saw Australian success when the Germans retreated on 20 May. The Australians had been critical of General Gough's strategy of throwing troops at the German Hindenburg Line, and the view has been expressed that it was Bullecourt which was to cause the massive erosion of the trust of the Australians in their British commanders. The remains of many thousands of Australians lie in the area. Below is a photograph the "Digger" memorial which commemorates the sacrifice of Australian soldiers during the Battle of Arras.

It reads{{Quotation|“Sacred to the memory of the 10,000 members of the Australian Imperial Force who were killed and wounded in the two battles of Bullecourt April–May 1917 and to the Australian dead and their comrades in arms who lie here forever in the soil of France lest we forget.

Also at Bullecourt is the Slouch Hat Memorial which commemorates those Australian and British soldiers who fell in the area in April and May 1917.

|The Vis-en-Artois British Cemetery and the Vis-en-Artois Memorial are located on the main road between Arras and Cambrai. The memorial records the names of 9,903 officers and men of the forces of Great Britain, Ireland, and South Africa who were lost between 8 August 1918 and 11 November 1918 in the final Allied advances in Picardy and Artois, whose bodies were never found, and thus have no known grave. The soldiers of Australia and New Zealand are remembered elsewhere. The architect/designer of the memorial was J. R. Truelove, a former captain in the London Regiment, who also designed the Le Touret Memorial. Amongst those commemorated at Vis-en-Artois are three Victoria Cross winners, Chief Petty Officer [[George Prowse]], Lance Corporal Allan Leonard Lewis]] and Sergeant [[Frederick Charles Riggs]]. The Memorial consists of a screen wall in three parts. The middle part of the screen wall is concave and carries stone panels on which names are carved. It is {{convert|26|ft|m}} high flanked by pylons {{convert|70|ft|m}} high. The Stone of Remembrance stands exactly between the pylons and behind it, in the middle of the screen, is a relief carving by [[Ernest Gillick]] representing St George and the Dragon. The screen walls to either side of that in the centre are also curved and carry stone panels carved with further names. Each of them forms the back of a roofed [[colonnade]]; and at the far end of each is a small building. The memorial was unveiled by The Rt Hon. Thomas Shaw on 4 August 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.cwgc.org/find-a-cemetery/cemetery/79200/VIS-EN-ARTOIS%20MEMORIAL |title=Cemetery Details |publisher=CWGC |date= |accessdate=2016-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[{{DoD detainees ARB|Set_33_2302-2425_Revised.pdf#57}} Summarized transcripts (.pdf)] {{Dead link|date=November 2009}}, from [[Swar Khan]]'s ''[[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]]'' - pages 57-68&lt;/ref&gt;

The testimony of an Afghan Police officer, appointed by officials of [[Hamid Karzai]]'s government, named [[Swar Khan]], offered several details of Maja Ha Adrif's career during Hamid Karzai's government.&lt;ref name=CsrtSwarKhan/&gt;

==Role in the appointment of Hamid Karzai of Afghanistan's interim leader==
In November 2001 a multiparty agreement, in [[Bonn]], [[Germany]], lead to the appointment of [[Hamid Karzai]] as leader of the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]].  The parties in Bonn included several of Afghanistan's militia leaders, commonly called "[[warlord]]s".  

According to Swan Khan, Majah Ha Adrif was one of the Bonn attendees.&lt;ref name=CsrtSwarKhanAdrifsDeathBonn&gt;

Swar Khan testified Majah Ha Adrif had a picture of himself shaking hands with [[US President]] [[George W. Bush]].
{{Main|Bonn Agreement (Afghanistan)}}

==Chief of Afghan Intelligence for Khost==
Swar Khan worked for a former anti-Taliban militia leader named [[Malem Jan Sorbari]].&lt;ref name=CsrtSwarKhan/&gt;  He attributed his denunciation, and transportation to Guantanamo to bad blood triggered by a rivalry between the former militia leaders he worked under and Majah Ha Adrif.
According to Swar Khan his immediate boss, Mustafa, had been appointed the Police Chief of Khost, while a different authority had appointed Majah Ha Adrif in charge of Afghan intelligence in Khost.  Swar Khan told his [[Combatant Status Review Tribunal]] that Mustafa's forces fought with Majah Ha Adrif's forces over who had jurisdiction over the security of the areas surrounding the US bases in Khost.  Many innocent people were killed during this fighting.

Swar Khan said one of Majah Ha Adrif's subordinates, named Habib Noor, falsely denounced him, and triggered his capture by the American, due to the animosity arising from the jurisdictional dispute.&lt;ref name=CsrtSwarKhan/&gt;

==Majah Ha Adrif's death==
According to Swar Khan, Majah Ha Adrif was shot at an American roadblock:&lt;ref name=CsrtSwarKhanAdrifsDeathBonn/&gt; 
:''"Maja Han Adroft(ph) ''{{Sic}}'' was very trusted by the Americans. He went with the Americans to the German city of Bonn, to a meeting. He has a picture with Bush and shook hands with Bush. In a checkpoint, he probably took money from someone. But, the Americans shot him and killed him."

'''Marek Hłasko''' (14 January 1934 – 14 June 1969) was a Polish [[author]] and [[screenwriter]].

== Life ==
Hłasko's biography is highly mythologized, and many of the legends about his life he spread himself. Marek was born in [[Warsaw]], as the only son of Maciej Hłasko and Maria Łucja, née Rosiak.&lt;ref&gt;Marek Hłasko's parents married on 26 January 1933&lt;/ref&gt; At first he lived with his parents in Złotokłos; later they moved to Warsaw. In the Hłasko family, children were baptised relatively late, hence the writer-to-be was baptized on 26 December 1935 in the Church of the Holy Redeemer in Warsaw.&lt;ref&gt;Maria Prochowska, his father's sister, and Ryszard Rosiak, his mother's brother, were his godparents&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that during the [[baptism|baptism ceremony]] when asked if he renounces the evil spirits Marek answered "No". Later, these words were reported as the evidence of Marek's strong character. 

Hłasko was three years old when his parents divorced in 1937. Maciej remarried a year later. He died on 13 September 1939, when his only son was five. The [[World War II|war]] left its stamp on Marek's psyche: later he wrote "it is obvious to me that I am a product of war times, starvation and terror; it is the reason for the intellectual poverty of my short stories. Simply, I cannot think up a story that does not end in death, catastrophe, suicide or imprisonment. Some people accuse me of pretending to be a strong man. They are wrong."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted from: A. Czyżewski ''Piękny dwudziestoletni'', p.24&lt;/ref&gt;
At the outbreak of [[World War II]], Hłasko's mother was working in the management secretariat of the City Power Station in Warsaw. During the [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|occupation]] she was fired and ran a food stall till the beginning of the [[Warsaw uprising]]. As a result, the family's financial situation worsened. At this time Marek started his education; however, all documents that might provide information about his education were destroyed during the Warsaw Uprising. Among the schools that he attended was one near the St. Kazimierz Factory on [[Tamka|Tamka Street]]. During the Warsaw Uprising, Marek stayed with his mother in Warsaw, and when it ended they moved to [[Częstochowa]] to the house of a friend. In March 1945, Maria and her son moved to [[Chorzów]] and two months later to [[Białystok]], where she settled with Kazimierz Gryczkiewicz. In early 1946, Gryczkiewicz, Maria Hłasko and Marek moved to [[Wrocław]]. 

In the summer of 1946, Marek Hłasko joined the Bolesław Chrobry First Wrocław Scout Troops. In order to become a member of the troop, Marek with his family's consent, gave 1933&lt;ref&gt;Also in the year 1950, when he was finishing his van-driving lessons, he gave the year 1933 as his birth date&lt;/ref&gt; as the year of his birth. Later he was dismissed from the scouts because of the poor attendance at the meetings. Marek worked as a messenger at the [[World Congress of Intellectuals for Peace]], held in August 1948 in [[Wrocław]].

The problems connected with Marek's education also cropped up. In his biography of Hłasko, Andrzej Czyżewski writes: "(Marek) began his education at the age of six and a half. During his school years he was always one of the youngest pupils in the class. To make matters worse, he had a childish appearance. Hence, he could not show off with what a boy in the primary school wants to impress others: strength, dexterity and maturity. He made up for it with the aggression and pertness, even towards his teachers. As a consequence, he had very few school mates. He was always an outsider. He walked away before he managed to make friends and get accustomed to them.".&lt;ref&gt;A. Czyżewski ''Piękny dwudziestoletni'', p. 51,&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1948 he graduated from the Maria Konopnicka Elementary School in Wrocław.

From September to November 1948, he studied at the Chamber of Commerce’ of the Secondary School of Business and Administration in Wrocław, and from March until June 1949 in the Labour Association of Children Friends’ School in Legnica (at that time he lived in a [[dormitory]]). Later, from December 1949 to January 1950, he attended the Technical and Drama High School in Warsaw, yet, in the end of December 1949 and early January 1950, he was expelled for "a notorious disrespect to school regulations, criminal violations, and wielding a corrupting influence on his colleagues".&lt;ref&gt;quoted from: A. Czyżewski ''Piękny dwudziestoletni'', p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; 

At the age of 16, he obtained his driving licence and started working as a van driver. On 28 September 1950 he was sentenced by the Magistrates' Court to two months of work with a 10% deduction from his salary (as he violated Article 7, point 2 of the Act on Securing Socialist Discipline of Work).&lt;ref&gt;A. Czyżewski ''Piękny dwudziestoletni'', p. 72, assumed that being late or missing a working day was an offence&lt;/ref&gt; After working off his sentence, he changed his employer.

From 15 November 1950 to 1 January 1951, he worked in the Transport Depot in [[Bystrzyca Kłodzka]]. Experiences gained there later inspired him to write a novel ''Następny do raju'' (''Next Stop–Paradise''). In January 1951 he moved to Warsaw with his mother and step-father. Hłasko often changed his occupation but it was always his own choice. Successively, he worked from 26 February to 15 April 1951 in an Equipment Base of the City's Construction Union, from 27 April 1951 to 16 June 1952 in a subway construction company "Metrobudowa", from 4 August to 1 December 1952 in a Transport Association of Warsaw Associations of Consumers, and till 30 March 1953 in a Warsaw Transport Enterprise of the City Retail Sale.

Writing became a chance to get out of this mind-numbing activity. His literary career started in 1951 when he wrote ''Baza Sokołowska'', his first set of short stories. Hłasko became a correspondent for ''Trybuna Ludowa'' (a popular Polish daily) when he was working for "Metrobudowa". At the end of 1952 he decided to show extracts of his book to [[Bohdan Czeszko]]. His reply letter written on 3 December of the same year included a criticism of Hłasko's literary attempts, but also drew attention to the young author's talent. Moreover, also in 1952, Hłasko followed Stefan Łoś's advice and established contact with the Polish Literary Association and [[Igor Newerly]], who was the protector of young writers. Hłasko introduced himself, to both Czeszko and Newerly, as "an uneducated driver who tries to describe his life in his free time after work".&lt;ref&gt;A. Czyżewski ''Piękny dwudziestoletni'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 1953, he received a three-month artistic scholarship from the Polish Literary Association. He gave up his driver's job for good, and went to Wrocław to work on his debut. Moreover, following Bohdan Czeszko's advice, he wrote a story based on his sketches (a final version of Baza Sokołowska) and finished a novel Sonata marymoncka. 

He made his debut with ''Baza Sokołowska'' in ''Sztandar Młodych'' (a daily paper published in Poland in 1950–1997) in 1954. He became quickly known as the most talented writer of the young generation.{{cn|date=July 2013}} However, the entering to the literary circle resulted in his alcoholism, which was becoming more and more pronounced. In 1955–1957, he edited a prose section in ''Po Prostu'' (a Polish socio-political magazine published in 1947–57), but he was not a good publicist.{{Peacock term|date=July 2013}} In 1956 he finally got his own flat in Warsaw. 

He gained publicity and popularity thanks to his original working style as well as his unconventional behaviour and clothing. He was a legendary figure of the young generation, a symbol of [[non-conformism]]. He was well-built; however, the physical appearance concealed over-sensitivity and uncertainty. He was prone to depression and could not adapt to everyday reality. Marek's inclination to rows contrasted with his friends' positive opinions of him.

In 1958, he went to Paris. The press there called him an Eastern European [[James Dean]], as Hłasko strikingly resembled him. Hłasko really identified himself with this role: he vandalized pubs and restaurants. At this time, he gained worldwide publicity. Nonetheless, he liked the life of a vagrant, so he left Paris and went to Germany and then to Italy.

The anticommunist edition of ''Cmentarze'' in the émigré Polish-language Parisian monthly ''[[Kultura]]'' launched a press campaign against him. When Marek was refused a renewal of his passport, he asked for political asylum in the [[Western Germany]]. After three months, he changed his mind and tried to return to [[Poland]]. However, while waiting for an answer from the Polish government, he decided to go to [[Israel]] in 1959. He could not live without Poland but at the same time he could not return to his homeland. As he did not have a talent for languages,{{Peacock term|date=July 2013}} he found it difficult to adjust to the reality of life abroad. He led a life of a vagrant, but he did not have to work while his publications provided him with a steady income. He performed manual labour, but he did so out of curiosity rather than need. Since 1960, he had lived in Germany with his wife, German actress [[Sonja Ziemann]].

In 1963, he spent a month in prison for his feuds with the police. In 1964 he twice attempted suicide. Between 1963 and 1965, he spent a total of 242 days in psychiatric clinics. In 1965, he divorced his wife, and in 1966, with [[Roman Polanski]]'s help, he went to Los Angeles. He was supposed to write screenplays, but it did not work out. He had an affair with Betty, the wife of [[Nicholas Ray]], the author of ''[[Rebel Without a Cause]]'', and thereby ended his career as a screenwriter. He got a pilot's licence instead.

In December 1968, during one of his parties, he playfully pushed [[Krzysztof Komeda]] off an escarpment. As a result of this accident, Komeda got a brain [[hematoma]] and died four months later. Hłasko was to say: "If Krzysztof dies, I'll go along" ''(Jeśli Krzysio umrze, to i ja pójdę)''. In 1969, he came back to Germany.

He died in [[Wiesbaden]] at the age of 35. The circumstances of his death remain unknown. One hypothesis is that he mixed alcohol with sedative drugs. However, those who knew him maintain that suicide was out of the question in his case.

In 1975, his ashes were taken to Poland, and buried at the [[Powązki Cemetery]] in Warsaw. Jan Himilsbach, a writer, actor and stonecutter who worked at the cemetery, was one of the initiators for taking Hłasko's remains back to Poland. Himilsbach carved the inscriptions on Hłasko's grave. The notice was suggested by Hłasko's mother and it says: "His life was short, and everybody turned their backs on him".

== Artistic work ==
Marek's private life resembled the life of characters of his works – romantic, tough outsiders, who became symbols of disappointment with realities of the 1950s.
[[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] were his idols.
His prose works voiced his objections to conformity and the hypocrisy of socialist realist literature. He wrote about protest of a moral nature. In his works he depicted the lives of the lower classes as dominated by hopelessness and cynicism. His characters dream about changes which come out to be vain.
Publishing of his works had been forbidden in Poland for 20 years. He was a co-screenwriter of films such as ''Koniec nocy'' (1957), ''Pętla'' (1957), ''Spotkania'' (1957), ''Ósmy dzień tygodnia'' (1958) and ''Baza ludzi umarłych''.

[[File:Luescher-2005.jpg|thumb|150px|Max Lüscher (2005)]]

'''Max Lüscher''' (September 9, 1923 – February 2, 2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luscher-color.ch/base.asp?p=nachruf.htm&amp;s=d&amp;m=m_home.asp Death Notice]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a Swiss [[psychotherapist]] known for inventing the [[Lüscher color test]], a tool for measuring an individual's psychophysical state based on his or her [[color preferences]]. Besides research, teaching and practicing psychotherapy in Basel, Lüscher worked for international companies, amongst other things giving color advice. His book ''The Lüscher Test'' has been translated into more than 30 languages.

==Biography==
Max Lüscher was born in Basel, Switzerland on September 9, 1923.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Biography - Lüscher-Color Diagnostik. (2015). Retrieved February 9, 2017, from http://www.luscher-color.ch/base.asp?p=GeschichteBio.html&amp;s=e&amp;m=m_theorie.asp&lt;/ref&gt; After receiving his Swiss "[[Matura]]", comparable to a diploma, he focused on studying psychiatry and achieved his doctorate in the areas of philosophy, psychology, and the philosophy of law. Lüscher completed his dissertation on ''"Color as an aid in psychological diagnosis"''. This project was chosen as the ''[[summa cum laude]]'' by his professors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After this, working as a psychotherapist, Lüscher created his first color test which was published in 1947. This test used color cards to determine the current emotional state of the test-taker.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ubran, D. (2014, July 22). Who Are We and Why? The Lüscher Color Test. Retrieved February 9, 2017, from http://www.schirn.de/en/magazine/context/who_are_we_and_why_the_luescher_color_test/&lt;/ref&gt; From 1961 to 1965, Lüscher lived in [[Berlin]] and continued his career as a psychotherapist. Lüscher was noted for his guest lectures and training seminars for physicians. The "Lüscher Color-Diagnostics" are now used in several universities across the world.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==The Lüscher test colors==
{{main|Lüscher color test}}
The test colors from the Lüscher Color-Diagnosis chosen based on favoritism. The test-taker chooses the card color they like best and then orders the rest from most-preferred to lease-preferred. Numbers are printed on the backside of each card, and after the test-taker orders them, the examiner turns them over and references an accompanying book that contains all of the different number combinations and their meaning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Lüscher argues that the subject's choice of color shows the state of their psychosomatic and emotional status and how they feel about themselves.

Lüscher relates to his four fundamental colors to the following fundamental categories:

*Blue: ''Contentment''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luscher-color.ch/base.asp?p=Info_Blau.htm&amp;s=d&amp;m=m_theorie.asp See and hear ''Contentment'']&lt;/ref&gt;
:Feeling of belonging, the inner connection and the relationship to one’s partner.
:"How I feel towards a person that is close to me"

*Green: ''Self-respect''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luscher-color.ch/base.asp?p=Info_Gruen.htm&amp;s=d&amp;m=m_theorie.asp See and hear ''Self-respect'']&lt;/ref&gt;
:Inner control of willpower and the capacity to enjoy.
:"The way I want to be"

*Red: ''Self confidence''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luscher-color.ch/base.asp?p=Info_Rot.htm&amp;s=d&amp;m=m_theorie.asp See and hear ''Self confidence]&lt;/ref&gt;
:Activity, drive and the reaction to challenges.
:"How I react to challenges"

*Yellow: ''Development''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luscher-color.ch/base.asp?p=Info_Gelb.htm&amp;s=d&amp;m=m_theorie.asp See and hear ''Development'']&lt;/ref&gt;
:Attitude of anticipation, attitude towards future development and towards new encounters.
:"What I expect for the future"

A 1984 comparison of the Lüscher color test and the [[Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory]] found little agreement between the two tests, prompting the authors to urge cautious use of the former.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/custom/portlets/recordDetails/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=EJ299316&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=EJ299316]&lt;/ref&gt;

The film stars [[Bella Thorne]], [[Patrick Schwarzenegger]], and [[Rob Riggle]], and follows a teenage girl with the disease [[xeroderma pigmentosum]], which prevents her from going out into sunlight.

==Plot==
&lt;!-- Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for films should be 400-700 words. --&gt;
Sheltered since early childhood, Katie Price lives with a life-threatening sensitivity to sunlight caused by the rare genetic condition, [[xeroderma pigmentosum]]. During the day, she is housebound, having only her father, Jack and her best friend, Morgan, to keep her company. Katie comes out of the house every night, when the sun is not present.

One night, she is noticed and asked out by her longtime crush, Charlie, while playing guitar at the train station. Katie leaves suddenly, and forgets her notebook, which Charlie keeps. He returns the next day, and gives it to Katie when she shows up to retrieve it. He explains to her how he got his injury that prevented him from getting a scholarship to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] before kissing her on one of the boats.

However, Katie has yet to tell Charlie of her condition, despite her father warning her to. Charlie takes Katie out for a night to [[Seattle]], where they go to a live show, and Charlie makes Katie play one of her songs on one of the city's streets. Once home, they go swimming out in the lake, and dry off with a fire on the beach. Charlie mentions watching the sunrise, and Katie freaks out, running home in fear. Charlie picks her up and quickly drives her there, but she does not make it in time, and is exposed to the sunlight for a couple of seconds. Katie runs inside, while Morgan and Jack come home soon after. Charlie still is standing confused at the front door, and Morgan explains that Katie has xeroderma pigmentosum. Once the doctors run some tests, Katie's doctor comes to the conclusion that Katie's brain is contracting, and it's only a matter of time before she dies.

Katie begins to experience twitches in her finger, which prevents her from playing the guitar. She also ignores Charlie's  messages as she does not want to hurt him. Jack eventually convinces Katie to speak to Charlie, who still wants to be with Katie, and does not care about the medical condition. Katie goes to Charlie's swim meet with the Berkeley coach, and they hang out at the house with Morgan and Jack. Charlie takes Katie out one night, and surprises her by booking a recording session, where she sings a song she wrote for him. Soon after, while hanging out at her house, Charlie mentions that he has to visit the boat for the last time, which he has been hired to take care of the whole summer. Katie, fearing that she is going to die, eventually remembers the time Charlie told her that he wished they could sail together, and convinces Jack to let her go with Charlie, despite it being the day. Katie sails with Charlie, feels the sunlight, and spend her final moments with him, dying soon after.

'''Muskingum County Animal Farm''' was a private [[zoo]] located in [[Zanesville]], [[Ohio]], [[United States]].

The [[Muskingum County, Ohio|Muskingum County]] animal farm had been repeatedly reported for inadequate and unsafe housing for the animals, as well as insufficient water and food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/nationnow/2011/10/exotic-animals-suffered-abuse-neglect-and-injury-at-ohio-farm-documents-show.html |title= Exotic Animals Endured Abuse, Neglect at Ohio farm, Documents Say |first= Rene |last= Lynch |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= October 21, 2011 |accessdate= October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terry Thompson==
Terry Thompson, a [[Vietnam War]] veteran prone to extreme violence, was a lifelong collector of exotic animals. In the years leading up to his death he went to prison on federal gun charges and was deemed an anti-government radical, he was heavily in debt, and his wife had left him; he may also have suffered from paranoia and schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Exotic Animal Owner Terry Thompson: What Happened? |url= http://www.people.com/people/article/0,,20539200,00.html |accessdate= October 21, 2015 |journal= [[People (magazine)|People]] |date= October 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had acted as an animal handler on Wild Kingdom in 2008, and provided a lion cub to a photoshoot with [[Heidi Klum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-500202_162-20123690/heidi-klum-session-used-animal-from-ohio-farm/ |title= Heidi Klum Session Used Animal from Ohio Farm |publisher= CBS News |accessdate= October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
[[Jack Hanna]], TV wildlife expert and Director Emeritus of the Columbus Zoo, lamented the killings but deemed the police actions necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2011/10/jack-hanna-on-zanesville-ohio-animals-we-would-have-had-carnage |title= Jack Hanna on Zanesville, Ohio, Animals: 'We Would Have Had Carnage' |publisher= [[ABC News]] |date= October 19, 2011 |accessdate= October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ohio governor [[John Kasich]] called for a temporary [[moratorium (law)|moratorium]] on the sale of exotic animals.&lt;ref name=reuters/&gt;
In August 2012, [[United Kingdom|Britain]]'s [[Channel 4]] broadcast a documentary on the animal release called "America's Animal Hoarder: Horror at the Zoo", featuring footage of Thompson's animals and interviews with those who brought the situation under control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.channel4.com/programmes/americas-animal-hoarder-horror-at-the-zoo/episode-guide/series-1/episode-1 |title= America's Animal Hoarder: Horror at the Zoo |publisher= [[Channel 4]] |accessdate= October 21, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nuke''' (real name '''Frank Simpson''') is a [[fictional character|fictional]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and artist [[David Mazzucchelli]], the character first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232 (July 1986). Nuke's most distinguishing feature is an [[Flag of the United States|American Flag]] [[tattoo]]ed on his face.

A version of the character, known as Will Simpson, appeared in the first and second seasons of ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]'', played by [[Wil Traval]].

==Publication history==
[[File:Daredevil232Nuke.jpg|left|thumb|180px|Nuke's first appearance, ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232 (Jul. 1986). Art by [[David Mazzucchelli]]]]
Nuke was created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] and [[David Mazzuchelli]]. He first appeared in ''[[Daredevil (Marvel Comics series)|Daredevil]]'' #232. Nuke largely disappeared following his apparent death in ''Daredevil'' #233, although his origin was explored and touched upon in issues of ''[[Captain America (comic book)|Captain America]]'' and ''[[Wolverine (comic book)|Wolverine]]''. It was not until [[Grant Morrison]]'s ''[[New X-Men]]'', when Morrison revealed Nuke was involved in the [[Weapon Plus]] program, that the character made a return in subsequent stories.

==Fictional character biography==
Frank Simpson was a test subject of the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon VII|Weapon Plus]] program, the supersoldier program that had created [[Captain America]] and would later have their [[Weapon X]] facility transform [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] into a killing machine. The enhancing and conditioning process went awry, leaving Nuke seriously deranged.

===Early life===
The origins of Nuke are explained in the series ''[[Wolverine: Origins]]''.

The disturbed son of a wealthy, abusive, [[Alcoholism|alcoholic]], upper-class woman in Ohio, Frank soon developed an unhealthy affection for his babysitter, the only real maternal figure in his life. The young woman, who was harboring feelings for his father Charles, capitalized on Frank's affection and talked the boy into killing his mother. Wolverine, who at that time was an operative for Weapon Plus, had been sent to kidnap Frank Simpson. Wolverine showed up, dressed as a cop. He then stalked Charles Simpson and the babysitter, eventually shooting the girl with Charles' gun, after which Charles committed suicide. Wolverine then went to Frank's place and abducted him for the supersoldier project.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #3 (2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Frank Simpson was sent into the [[Vietnam War]] as a black-ops agent. Captured by the [[National Front for the Liberation of South Vietnam|Viet Cong]], Frank was severely tortured by Logan (who was posing as a Russian intelligence liaison), shattering Frank's still unbalanced mind. While torturing him (even carving into his face the American flag that years later would become part of his superpowered personality), he implanted the phrase "No V.C.!" as a [[Post-traumatic stress disorder|trigger word]], along with the compulsion to kill gruesomely, in retaliation for the tortures suffered, anyone who uttered the words. He then allowed Frank to escape, testing his work with a village of peasants, who, seeing an American soldier, tried to soothe his anger and convince him to spare them, shouting the "No V.C.!" phrase, meaning that they were not Viet Cong. Frank, in response to the trigger word, burnt the village to the ground, killing every inhabitant. The experiment being a success, Logan was installed as his handler. Due to his trauma, Nuke often hallucinates that the enemies he is fighting are the Viet Cong.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #2 (2006). Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

At some time during the war, Nuke was inducted into the final part of the ''Project Homegrown'', the [[Weapon Plus#Weapon VII|Weapon VII]] programs, that turned him into a partial [[cyborg]] with a subdermal mesh able to deflect bullets, and a second heart that, working in conjunction with some ([[placebo]]) pills, controlled his aggression, leaving him addicted as well. His whereabouts after the war are still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''New X-Men'' #145. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First appearance===
Nuke resurfaces, employed by Generalissimo Felix Guillermo Carridad, of Tierra Verde, to destroy a rebel base. Carridad is impressed with his skills, and he enjoys using Nuke periodically as a superhuman iconic symbol.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' (vol. 2) #18. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Following an operation in [[Nicaragua]], the [[Kingpin (comics)|Kingpin]] hires Nuke through a corrupt general and sends him to kill [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]]. Nuke launches an attack on [[Hell's Kitchen]], but is defeated by Daredevil. Enraged at a ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' article reporting on his mass murder in Hell's Kitchen, he escapes his handlers, intending to destroy the ''Bugle'' building. He is intercepted by [[Captain America]] and shot by a military chopper. He faints from the wound and is presumed dead by the general public.&lt;ref&gt;''Daredevil'' #232–233. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Nuke was taken into custody by the government, still controlled by the Tierra Verde enclave.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Wolverine: Origins'' – ''The Death of Wolverine''===
In the series ''Wolverine: Origins'', following Wolverine's regaining of his full memories, and his embarking on a mission to take care of loose ends, the U.S. government dispatches Nuke to hunt Wolverine down.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #1–2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Wolverine dispatches Nuke, it is revealed that Nuke's enhanced physiology has further mutated, giving him cybernetic limbs, bones and skull, and the ability to survive the most gruesome injuries, but has left him devoid of any personality or conscience. When Wolverine tries to kill him, [[Captain America]] intervenes, believing that Nuke is a failed subject of the Super Soldier Program. Wolverine asked the telepath [[Emma Frost]] to restore Nuke's broken mind, saying that he would [[euthanize]] Nuke if she determined that it was not possible.&lt;ref name=WolverineOrigins&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #3–5. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[Green Goblin|Norman Osborn]]'s tenure as the head of the American peace-keeping organization H.A.M.M.E.R., he adds a man named [[Scourge of the Underworld|Scourge]] to his [[black ops]] team, the [[Thunderbolts (comics)|Thunderbolts]],&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #133 – 135. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; but the man later reveals himself to be Nuke, and is demoted from the position of team leader.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #136. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; During the events of the storyline "[[Siege (comics)|Siege]]", Nuke sustains injuries that render him comatose.&lt;ref&gt;''Thunderbolts'' #142 – 145. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Captain America'' Vol 7 #12, Simpson is allied with the Iron Nail, attacking individuals in Europe that he perceives as enemies of America, until he is stopped by Captain America.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' Vol 7 #12. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; He is caught in an explosion and presumed dead.&lt;ref&gt;''Captain America'' Vol 7 #17. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nuke later appears alive with a shaved head in the ''[[Death of Wolverine]]'' mini-series. He is seen working for [[Viper (Madame Hydra)|Madame Hydra]] and hunting Wolverine as part of her bounty. While at a bar in British Columbia, Wolverine uses his adamantium skull to headbutt Nuke to spread the word that he spared him while also getting the information on who placed the bounty on him.&lt;ref&gt;''Death of Wolverine'' #1&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Nuke possesses various superhuman physical attributes as a result of various [[cybernetic]] enhancements. Nuke's bones have been replaced with advanced cybernetic components, granting him superhuman strength of an unrevealed limit. Aside from his strength, Nuke's body is considerably more resistant to physical injury than that of an ordinary human; even the arcane nerve strikes Daredevil learned during training by his sensei, [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], have no effect. Nuke's skin has been replaced with an artificial type of plastic that looks identical to human skin but is much more durable. In addition, he has an artificial secondary heart that works in conjunction with his colored pills. Nuke is the victim of decades of systematic physical and psychological conditioning at the hands of various individuals working for the United States government. As a result, Nuke is insane. He is now little more than a puppet in the hands of his current handler, and able only to follow issued commands. Also in his first appearance in ''Daredevil'', Nuke was equipped with a monstrous multi-barrelled assault rifle which, in addition to being able to fire massive volleys of bullets, fragmentation grenades, and rockets, was also (due to mechanisms left unexplained) able to "keep count" of the casualties inflicted. Nuke also had a habit of resetting the counter after noting down each "score" trying to "better" it in the coming assignment.{{issue|date=December 2015}}

Apparently Nuke's metabolism is now remote controlled from a secret base on Tierra Verde, whose technicians are able to ''shut down'' the [[biotechnology|biomech]] systems in Nuke's body.&lt;ref name=WolverineOrigins/&gt;

===Pills===
Nuke has a second heart, and takes different colored pills to produce different bodily effects.
Nuke's pill colors are: red, for increased [[adrenaline]]; white, to keep him balanced between missions; and blue, to bring him down.

It was originally stated that the red pills Nuke took affected his [[adrenal gland]]s, sending him into his bloodthirsty rages.{{Issue|date=November 2009}} The ''[[Wolverine (character)#Wolverine: Origins|Wolverine: Origins]]'' series [[retcon]]ned this, stating instead that these pills are [[placebo]]s, suggesting that Nuke lives in a constant state of increased adrenaline, but is not aware of this. The pills, therefore, trigger his violent behavior, but the effect is [[psychosomatic]].{{Issue|date=November 2009}}

==Other versions==
In the "[[House of M]]" storyline, Nuke is one of the government agents (alongside [[Mimic (comics)|Mimic]] and [[Bucky Barnes|Agent Barnes]]) sent to [[Genosha]] to kill [[Magneto (comics)|Magneto]] and as many of his followers as possible. He and Mimic served as a distraction while Agent Barnes snuck into Magneto's headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Civil War (comics)|Civil War: House of M]]'' #3. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; When Nuke entered [[Scarlet Witch|Wanda]]'s bedroom in order to kill her, he was disassembled by her.&lt;ref&gt;''Civil War: House of M'' #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

''What If'' vol. 2 #48 showed what would have happened if Daredevil had saved Nuke. This story manifests as [[Ben Urich]] pondering the situation and thinking of alternatives.&lt;ref&gt;''What If'' #48. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Ultimate Marvel]] universe, Frank Simpson appears in ''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #1 as the man who was given the Super Soldier Serum during the [[Vietnam War]] when Steve Rogers was MIA after [[World War II]], but his origin is more reminiscent of the [[Grand Director]], a Captain America post [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #1. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Like his mainstream counterpart, Simpson has the American Flag tattooed onto his face.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #2. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson, completely disillusioned by America after [[Vietnam]] (1972) is believed to have betrayed his country due to the war and the augmentations, but has "seen the Light". He is trying to sell his reverse-engineered serum blood to the [[North Korea]]ns, but is stopped by British [[Special Air Service|S.A.S.]] and Steve Rogers. After his identity is revealed to [[Carol Danvers|Colonel Danvers]], Cap is beaten, and travels to Saloth, a [[Cambodia]]n village, but Simpson and his army (all pumped up with the Super-Soldier Serum) beat him. Simpson vows to make Cap, "see the light", strongly believing America stands for a number of atrocities in the last 50 years. Cap escapes and stops Simpson. He is brought into [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]] custody. Simpson is later visited by Cap in the [[Triskelion (comics)|Triskelion]], which has Rogers reading the [[Bible]] to a bed-ridden Simpson.&lt;ref&gt;''Ultimate Comics: Captain America'' #4. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Amalgam Comics]] universe, in which the characters of Marvel Comics were merged with those of [[DC Comics]], Nuke is combined with DC's [[Bane (comics)|Bane]] as [[Hydra (Marvel Comics)|Hydra]] agent '''Bane Simpson'''.&lt;ref&gt;''Bruce Wayne: Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D.'' #1. Marvel Comics/[[DC Comics]].&lt;/ref&gt;

When Jessica catches up and confronts Simpson about a recent string of deaths of IGH members, Simpson states that Trish is being targeted because of her investigation into IGH, before they are abruptly attacked by the assailant, who is later revealed to be Jessica's mother [[Alisa Campbell|Alisa]].

'''Online mourning''' describes grieving on the internet. It represents not a revolution in mourning, but rather a shift in the medium mourners utilize to express their [[grief]] and memorialize the deceased.&lt;ref name=C&amp;L&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=Brian|author2=Katie Landry |title=Logging on and letting out: using online social networks to grieve and to mourn|journal=Bulletin of science, technology &amp; society|year=2010|pages=341–349|doi=10.1177/0270467610380006|url=http://bst.sagepub.com/content/30/5/341}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H&amp;Q&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hogan|first=Bernie|author2=Anabel Quan-Haase|title=Persistence and change in social media|journal=Bulletin of science technology &amp; society|year=2010|pages=309–315|doi=10.1177/0270467610380012|url=http://bst.sagepub.com/content/30/5/309}}&lt;/ref&gt; This shift has occurred in tandem with the widespread popularity of [[social media]] in the West, a result of which has been the need for users to accept death within an online environment.&lt;ref name=H&amp;Q /&gt;  It is estimated that by 2012, 30 million [[Facebook]] users had died.&lt;ref&gt;Kaleem, Jaweed. [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/12/07/death-facebook-dead-profiles_n_2245397.html "Death on Facebook now common as ‘death profiles’ create vast virtual cemetery"], ''[[Huffington Post]]'', 12 July 2012. Retrieved on 2 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Online mourning does not occur exclusively on social media websites. There are websites such as [[Legacy.com]] dedicated to hosting obituaries. Two distinct types of online mourning have been identified, high-profile cases that draw attention from a broad online community, and profiles posthumously recreated and reframed as a medium to memorialize the deceased.&lt;ref name=C&amp;L /&gt;

==History==
Since the advent of newspapers, the [[obituary]] became a preferred method of memorializing the deceased. Until recently, obituaries were one of the most read sections of the newspaper.&lt;ref name="stephens"&gt;Stephens, Mitchell (1996). ''A history of news'' Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|0195189914}}.&lt;/ref&gt; As new media technologies such as [[radio]] and [[television]] were created, the obituary adapted to best reflect capabilities available in the new communication media. Authors Brian Carroll and Katie Landry have argued that the appearance of online mourning reflects a logical progress of mourning via social media networks through use of new media. Changes to the obituary as it adapts over media include an exponential increase in information about the deceased, and the content reaching a wider geographic audience.&lt;ref name=C&amp;L /&gt; The occurrence of online mourning presents a new paradigm in the memorialization process by providing interactive, sometimes competitive documents for mourners.&lt;ref name=C&amp;L /&gt; Studies of Facebook and [[Myspace]] indicate that while the majority of living users visit memorialized profile accounts immediately after learning of an individual’s death, visitation often continues long after, albeit less frequently.&lt;ref name=C&amp;L /&gt;

There have been so many cases of online memorialization that it has resulted in the creation of websites such as [[MyDeathSpace.com]], which attempt to create a catalogue of memorializations available on social media websites. Dead users with active profiles became problematic due to the inability of social media algorithms to recognize a user is deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Matthew. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/technology/facebook/6445152/Facebook-introduces-memorial-pages-to-prevent-alerts-about-dead-members.html "Facebook introduces ;memorial’ pages to prevent alerts about dead members"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'', 27 October 2009. Retrieved on 2 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Facebook addressed this issue updating its policy to include an outline for handling user deaths through switching dead users’ profiles to memorial statuses.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Stephanie. [http://mashable.com/2013/02/13/facebook-after-death/ "How 1 billion people are coping with death and facebook"], ''[[Mashable]]'', 13 February 2013. Retrieved on 2 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interaction with the deceased==
As previously mentioned, online mourning presents a new aspect of mourning by allowing users to interact with the memorialization of the deceased. By posting to a memorialized individual, mourners can celebrate the life of the deceased, connect to each other, and facilitate closure. Studies of mourners’ interactions with memorialized profile pages have identified distinct themes of interaction with the deceased:
* Cursory comments that provide digital tokens of mourning
* Admiration or praise of the deceased
* Petitioning the deceased for guidance
* Narrative or biographical record of the deceased
* Describing and reinforcing the values of the deceased &lt;ref name=C&amp;L /&gt;

'''Anne Thérèse of Savoy''' (1 November 1717 – 5 April 1745) was a [[Savoy]]ard princess born in Paris, [[France]]. She was the second wife of [[Charles de Rohan]], [[Prince de Soubise]], a military leader and friend of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].

==Biography==
Born at the Parisian ''[[Hôtel de Soissons]]'', she was a member of a [[cadet branch]] of the [[House of Savoy]]. Her father was the [[prince of Carignano|Prince di Carignano]].

Through her mother, she was a granddaughter of the [[Victor Amadeus II of Sardinia|then king Victor Amadeus of Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;The Kingdom of Sicily was exchanged for the Kingdom of Sardinia in 1720 when Anne Thérèse was three years old&lt;/ref&gt; Her mother was [[Maria Vittoria Francesca of Savoy|Maria Vittoria Francesca, legittimata di Savoia, Marchesa di Susa]], a [[legitimation|legitimised]] daughter of Victor Amadeus II and his ''[[maîtresse-en-titre]]'', [[Jeanne Baptiste d'Albert de Luynes]].

She grew up in Paris, their parents fleeing the court of Savoy due to embarrassingly large debts. Their parents arrived in Paris during the [[Régence|regency of Philippe d'Orléans]] (1715–1723), regent of the Kingdom for the infant [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]].

Her husband to be was [[Charles de Rohan]], the widower of [[Anne Marie Louise de La Tour d'Auvergne]], a granddaughter of [[Marie Anne Mancini|Marie Mancini]]. As head of the [[cadet branch]] of the [[House of Rohan]], Charles bore the titles ''[[Prince of Soubise|Prince de Soubise]]'' and [[Duke of Rohan-Rohan]]. He became a [[Marshal of France]] in 1758, and served as a minister to Louis XV and [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]]. Orphaned at the age of 9, he was a notorious libertine.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

The couple married in the original (''vieux'') donjon of the [[Rohan Castle|château de Rohan]] in the town of [[Saverne]] on 6 November 1741. Presiding over the ceremony was the bridegroom's brother, [[Armand de Rohan]], bishop of Strasbourg. Anne Thérèse had a step-daughter, [[Charlotte Élisabeth Godefride de Rohan|Charlotte de Rohan]], future wife of [[Louis Joseph de Bourbon, prince de Condé]] and grandmother of [[Louis Antoine Henri de Bourbon, Duke of Enghien]], an ''[[émigré]]'' whose seizure and execution by personal order of [[Napoleon I]] would shock Europe in 1804.

Anne Thérèse died in childbirth at the ''Hôtel de Soubise''. In December 1745, her widowed husband married again; this time to [[Landgrave|Landgravine]] [[Anna Viktoria of Hesse-Rotenburg]].

Alan|accessdate=August 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;, &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pinterest.com.au/pin/850617448342086875 All Nicknames given to Princess Bubblegum]. Pintrest photo album saved by Dziki Czos (April 22, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;, is a fictional character in the American [[List of animated television series|animated]] [[Cartoon Network]] [[television series]] ''[[Adventure Time]]'', created by [[Pendleton Ward]].

Princess Bubblegum is the current incarnation of the '''Candy Elemental''', comparable to the inhabitants of the Candy Kingdom, who are all composed of types of desserts and candies. She rules over the Candy Kingdom, but in the Season 6 episode "Hot Diggity Doom" (the first part of the season's finale), an election was held and she lost to the King of Ooo by a landslide. As a result, she no longer ruled the Candy Kingdom and the King of Ooo replaced her as the new ruler, until a rebellion against King of Ooo allowed her to reclaim the throne in "[[Stakes (miniseries)#ep8|The Dark Cloud]]".

==Characteristics==
On the Cartoon Network official website in 2010, Jake referred to Princess Bubblegum as "a horrible mutant mix of bubblegum and human DNA." The validity of this hasn't been confirmed, but in the video game ''[[Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I DON'T KNOW!]]'' Princess Bubblegum explains that she was part of a sentient pink goo that was formed about one thousand years ago, and achieved sentience upon being spat out, with her current form being 827 years old. It is unclear how much of this story is canon to the cartoon show, but seeing as how in the episode "Bonnie and Neddy" it is revealed that she came from a pink, gum-like substance known as the "Mother Gum," the basis of this information seems to coincide with the shows mythos.

In the season 7 episode "Elemental," Princess Bubblegum was revealed to be the current Candy Elemental (in the ''Adventure Time'' universe, the Elementals are the embodiments of the four main elements that make up the world: ice, fire, candy and slime. They have existed since the beginning of life, living, dying and reincarnating for eons and millennia).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Voice Compare: Adventure Time&amp;nbsp;– Princess Bubblegum|url=http://www.behindthevoiceactors.com/voice-compare/Adventure-Time/Princess-Bubblegum/|publisher=Behind the Voice Actors|accessdate=January 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Personality===
While Princess Bubblegum is typically kind, good-hearted and well-mannered, she can be very temperamental—her temper can be a powerful force when provoked. She is also a rational thinker with skepticism towards magic. Her proficiency in [[science]] and fluency in [[Korean language|Korean]] and [[German language|German]] are a testament to her high intelligence. In the season 4 episode "Goliad", after the events in "Mortal Recoil" she begins to feel very vulnerable, and makes a clone-Sphinx of herself named Goliad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=Too Young| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Larry Leichliter (director); Tom Herpich &amp; Jesse Moynihan (writers) | network = [[Cartoon Network]] |airdate=August 8, 2011 | season = 3 | number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also begins exhibiting strong [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian behavior]], as she starts spying on all her subjects, and begins taking more assertive actions from then onwards.

===Physical appearance===
Princess Bubblegum has light pink skin, long magenta-pink "bubblegum" hair and usually dresses in a puffy-sleeved flowing dark pink gown with pink trim at the sleeve, purple trim at the scoop-neck collar. When ever she does any science experiments, she wears a [[White coat|lab coat]], with her hair often tied, either up in a bun or a ponytail, otherwise let out like in her formal outfit. Usually, she wears something different than her original gown from episode-to-episode and her hair is commonly seen in different styles

===Powers and abilities===
*Although Princess Bubblegum looks 18, the events shown in "The Vault" reveals that she may in fact be much older than she looks. In the 2013 video game ''[[Adventure Time: Explore the Dungeon Because I Don't Know!]]'', Princess Bubblegum states that she is 827 years old. As seen in the episodes "Mortal Recoil" and "Too Young", her biological age can be fluctuated by adding or removing candy biomass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title=Mortal Recoil| series=Adventure Time| serieslink=|credits = Larry Leichliter (director); Cole Sanchez &amp; Jesse Moynihan (writers) | network = [[Cartoon Network]] |airdate=May 2, 2011 | season = 2 | number = 26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In "Have You Seen the Muffin Mess," it is shown that after her forearm was turned into muffins by her nanobots, she is able to stretch it out to how it was; this is most likely how she increases and decreases the length of her hair. 
*In "Bonnie and Neddy," when Princess Bubblegum dropped from the Mother Gum, she waves and speaks to it in clicking noises indicating that they have some sort of unique method of communication.
*When soothing her brother Neddy with clicking noises, Princess Bubblegum sometimes glows.
*As the current incarnation of the Candy Elemental, Princess Bubblegum has the ability to project in various forms quantities of candy (e.g. [[jellybeans]], [[mints|scotch mints]] and [[soda pop]]) through her hands. While her powers seem to be magically in nature, Bubblegum has been able to function her elemental abilities based on her own rudimentary knowledge of scientific principles.
*Princess Bubblegum can communicate with previous incarnations of the Candy Elemental (e.g. Chatsberry) via lucid dreams.
*After being consumed by her elemental powers, Princess Bubblegum became connected to all candy across the galaxy. She could also transform other people and objects into candy. Those affected were uncharacteristically joyful and ignorant of their life prior to their transformation.

===Relationships===
She is the former love interest of the protagonist, [[Finn the Human|Finn]], and while the two are friends she never showed any real attraction to him, due to the age difference. During the time she is 13 in the episode "[[Too Young (Adventure Time)|Too Young]]", she is presented as having a crush on him. After Finn got a new girlfriend, Flame Princess, his feelings for her seem to have faded, and Finn becomes angry with Princess Bubblegum when she informs Finn the two have to break up (Finn thinks she is doing it out of jealousy; when actually it is because, for Flame Princess, the act of falling in love can destroy the Earth). In some episodes, however, it is suggested Finn may still have feelings for Princess Bubblegum (as in the episode "King Worm" he dreams that they are married). 

In an interview, Olivia Olsen (who voices [[Marceline the Vampire Queen|Marceline]]) stated that Marceline and Bubblegum are ex-girlfriends.&lt;ref name="GayStarNews"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gaystarnews.com/article/adventure-time%E2%80%99s-marceline-and-princess-bubblegum-once-dated-show%E2%80%99s-creator-said210814/ | title=Adventure Time’s Marceline and Princess Bubblegum once dated, show's creator said | publisher=Gay Star News | date=21 August 2014 | accessdate=3 July 2016 | author=Potts, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shewired"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Wu|first1=Connie|title=Adventure Time Fans Rejoice!

Olsen claimed to be informed of this by Pendleton Ward, the creator of ''Adventure Time'', although Ward never confirmed this. Throughout the series, the two have grown closer; in "Take Her Back", the sixth episode of the ''[[Stakes (miniseries)|Stakes]]'' miniseries, Princess Bubblegum even refers to Marceline as her "best friend". In the series finale "Come Along with Me", Marceline and Bubblegum share their first onscreen kiss, confirming mutual romantic feelings between them.

===Genderswapped version===
Princess Bubblegum has a genderswapped version of herself in the 61st episode, Fionna and Cake, who was Prince "Bubba" Gumball. In that episode it is revealed that the characters only exist in fanfiction written by the Ice King. Like Princess Bubblegum, Prince Gumball also has his own loyal companion, Lord Monochromicorn. Just as Princess Bubblegum can understand Lady's [[Korean language|Korean]], Prince Gumball can understand Lord Monochromicorn's [[Morse code]]. Prince Gumball has shown romantic feelings for Fionna, but that was actually the Ice Queen in disguise. However, the real Prince Gumball also shows feelings for Fionna and had actually asked her out on a date.

==Controversy==
The third season episode "[[What Was Missing]]" became controversial because of an allegedly implied past relationship between Marceline and Princess Bubblegum.&lt;ref name=bitchmag/&gt;&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian/&gt; The controversy largely began after an accompanying "Mathematical" recap—a behind the scenes video series produced by [[Frederator Studios]] that implied that there were [[lesbian]] relations between Princess Bubblegum and Marceline and that the writing staff actively seeks input from fans.&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian/&gt;&lt;ref name=marysuecontr&gt;{{cite web|last=Polo|first=Susana|title=Did Adventure Time Just Admit To Lesbian Characters|url=http://www.themarysue.com/adventure-time-lesbian-characters/|work=''TheMarySue.com''|publisher=The Mary Sue, LLC|accessdate=March 24, 2013|date=September 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=muto1&gt;{{cite web|last=Muto|first=Adam|title=Could you explain what this whole Mathematical video thing did that was bad?|url=http://www.formspring.me/MrMuto/q/243840879511470446|publisher=[[Formspring]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6FGgACKo7|archivedate=March 20, 2013|date=September 29, 2011|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; This incident was addressed by [[Fred Seibert]], the show's executive producer, who said that "in trying to get the show's audience involved we got wrapped up by both fan conjecture and spicy fanart and went a little too far."&lt;ref name=bitchmag&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnson|first=Kjerstin|title=Adventure Time Gay Subtext: "Spicy" or Adorbz?|url=http://bitchmagazine.org/post/what-the-math|work=[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]|accessdate=March 20, 2013|date=October 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian/&gt; Soon after, the video recap and the entire channel was pulled off of [[YouTube]], although "What Was Missing" still airs during reruns.&lt;ref name=seibertlesbian&gt;{{cite web|last=Seibert|first=Fred|title=Well I Completely Screwed Up|url=http://yamino.tumblr.com/post/10825567451/adventuretime-well-i-completely-screwed-up|publisher=[[Frederator Studios]]|accessdate=March 6, 2013|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seibert's decision to remove the video also proved controversial; ''[[Bitch (magazine)|Bitch]]'' magazine later wrote an article about how the episode "handled female desire—female queer desire at that—in a subtle but complex way", but that the removal of the recap and the studio's perceived treatment of the controversy was detrimental towards the acceptance of queer romance in children's television.&lt;ref name=bitchmag/&gt; Ward later addressed the issue and gave a more neutral view; he said that, because there were "so many extreme positions taken on it all over the Internet", he did not "really want to comment on it [because] it was a big hullaballoo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Smith|first=Zack|title=Adventure Time Creator Pen Ward Talks Before Season Finale|url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/advneture-time-pendleton-ward-120213.html|work=''Newsarama.com''|publisher=TechMediaNetwork|accessdate=October 30, 2012|date=February 13, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014, [[Olivia Olson]], the voice of Marceline, told a crowd of fans gathered at a Barnes &amp; Noble book signing from ''The Adventure Time Encyclopedia'', that Marceline and Princess Bubblegum had dated in the past, but that because the series airs in some areas where homosexual relationships are illegal, the show has not been able to officially make clear the relationship in the series itself.&lt;ref name=shewired /&gt; Olsen seemed to redact the statement in a Tweet that same day by stating "I like to make things up at panels. Ya'll take my stories way too seriously".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.themarysue.com/pb-marceline-dated/|title=Bubbline Shippers Rejoice: Adventure Time‘s Marceline &amp; Princess Bubblegum Confirmed To Have Dated|website=www.themarysue.com|access-date=2016-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; However that tweet has since been deleted so it is now unclear whether or not her statement was true. 

During the final episode "[[Come Along with Me (Adventure Time)|Come Along with Me]]" Bubblebum and Marceline's relationship was finally confirmed with them being seen kissing before defeating GOLB.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13497">This article gives an overview of professional ethics as applied to [[computer programming]] and [[software development]], in particular the ethical guidelines that developers are expected to follow and apply when writing programming code (also called [[source code]]), and when they are part of a programmer-customer or employee-employer relationship. These rules shape and differentiate good practices and attitudes from the wrong ones when creating [[software]] or when making decisions on a crucial or delicate issue regarding a programming project. They are also the basis for ethical decision-making skills in the conduct of professional work.

== History ==

The American scholar [[Norbert Wiener]], professor of Mathematics and Engineering at [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], was the first person to set the basis for a new type of 
Ethics in the mid 1940s. He noticed that the innovations and advances in science and [[technology]], along with the fast-growing computer industry, were leading to the appearance of this type of Ethics that he named “cybernetics” (from the Greek word for the pilot of a ship). The emerging use of [[computer]]s and other technologies were bringing up new ethical issues that needed to be analyzed carefully using new ethical guidelines.

Wiener wrote three books that lay down a foundation to a new division of [[Ethics]] after World War II ended. The books were Cybernetics (1948), The Human Use of Human Beings (1950) and God and Golem, Inc. (1963). Even though he never saw himself creating a new area of Ethics, Wiener gave detailed examples where some ethical and social issues and implications, which were generated by the use of [[computer]]s, could be identified. However, his ideas were not taken seriously by other scholars because they considered him an eccentric scientist that fantasized about Ethics (Bynum).&lt;ref name="Bynum"&gt;Bynum, Terrel. “Computer and Information Ethics.” The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition). Ed. Edward N. Zalta, Oct. 2008. Web. 29 Sep. 2013 &lt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ethics-computer/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1976, a new term regarding Ethics, named “computer ethics,” was proposed by Walter Maner based on the ideas and principles of [[Norbert Wiener]]. Maner felt it was necessary to have a field of Ethics for the computer industry just as the medical and business industries had at that moment. Maner also defined that field as one that “studies ethical problems aggravated, transformed or created by computer technology” (Bynum),&lt;ref name="Bynum" /&gt; and he even designed a computer ethics course that could be imparted to university students.

In the early 1990s, [[Donald Gotterbarn]] claimed that computer ethics should be considered as professional ethics that could have the power to lead towards the development and advancement of standards of good practice and codes of conduct for computing professionals (Bynum).&lt;ref name="Bynum" /&gt; He worked with several professional-ethics advocates to write ethical guidelines for creating codes of Ethics. He formed part of the creation of Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct, adopted by the [[Association for computing machinery|Association for Computing Machinery]] (ACM) in 1992, and Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, adopted by the [[IEEE|Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers]] (IEEE) and the ACM as well. These codes also include Programming Ethics principles.

== Programming Ethical Guidelines ==

The [[Association for computing machinery|Association for Computing Machinery (ACM)]] is the world’s largest educational and scientific computing society. It has its own Code of Ethics and another set of ethical principles that were also approved by the [[IEEE]] as the standard for teaching and practicing [[software engineering]]. These codes are Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct and the Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice, respectively, and some of their guidelines are presented below:

From the Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct (ACM):&lt;ref name="ACM"&gt;“ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct .” Association for Computing Machinery Advancing Computing as a Science &amp; Profession. Association for Computing Machinery (ACM). Web. 28 Sep 2013. &lt;http://www.acm.org/about/code-of-ethics&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Contribute to society and human well-being.''' Programmers should work to develop computer systems that can reduce negative consequences to society, such as threats to safety and health, and that can make everyday activities and work easier. It is “an obligation to develop to high standards” (Savage).&lt;ref name="savage"&gt;Savage, Brandon. “Ethics for Programmers?.” BrandonSavage.net Perfect the art of software development. 12 Aug. 2009. Web. 29 Sep. 2013. &lt;https://www.brandonsavage.net/ethics-for-programmers/&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Avoid harm to others.''' Computer systems have an indirect impact on third parties. They can cause loss of information and resources that might result severely harmful for users, the general public, or employers. Therefore, software developers should minimize the risk of harming others due to [[Error code|coding errors]], or security issues, by following standards to design and test systems (Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct).&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt;
* '''Be honest and trustworthy.''' This principle encourages programmers to be honest and aware of their limitations in knowledge and education when writing computer systems. Also, if a programmer knows there is something wrong with a computer system, he or she should report it immediately to avoid undesirable consequences.
* '''Give proper credit for intellectual property.''' It is mandatory for every software developer to never use and take credit for someone else’s work, even when it has not been protected by a [[copyright]] law, [[patent]], etc. They must recognize and fully credit other people’s works, and they should use their own ideas to develop software.
* '''Respect the privacy of others.''' Computer systems are wrongly used by some people to violate the privacy of others. Software developers should write programs that can protect users’ private information and that can avoid other undesired people to have unauthorized access to it (Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct).
* '''Honor confidentiality.''' Unless required by law or any other ethical guideline, a programmer must keep secret any additional information related to his or her employer that arises from working in a project.

From Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice&lt;ref name="ieee"&gt;“Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice.” Association for Computing Machinery Advancing Computing as a Science &amp; Profession. Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE). Web. 28 Sep 2013. &lt;http://www.acm.org/about/se-code&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;  (IEEE, ACM):

* '''Approve software only if they have a well-founded belief it is safe and meets specifications.''' Programmers cannot assume that a system is ready to use only because it performs the tasks needed. They should make sure these systems are also safe and meet every specification required by the user. If programs are not safe, users are unprotected from hackers that could steal important information or money. Therefore, several tests should be performed in order to ensure a [[Computer security|system’s security]] before approving it.
* '''Accept full responsibility for their own work.''' If a program presents errors, the software developer should accept full responsibility for his or her work, and should work on revising, correcting, modifying, and [[Test method|testing]] it.
* '''Not knowingly use software that is obtained or retained either illegally or unethically.''' If a computer system will be used as a base for the creation of another, then permission to do so should be asked by the programmer. This principle prohibits using any other software for any purpose if the way it was gotten is not clear or is known to be illegal or unethical.
* '''Identify, define, and address ethical, economic, cultural, legal and environmental issues related to work projects.''' If a programmer notices and identifies that working on a project will lead to any kind of problems, then the programmer should report it to his or her employer before continuing.
* '''Ensure that specifications for software on which they work satisfy the users’ requirements and they have the appropriate approvals.''' Software developers should come to their employers to ask for the correspondent approval to the system they are creating before continuing working on the next part. If it doesn’t meet the requirements, then a modification to the source code of the system should be made.
* '''Ensure adequate testing, [[debugging]] and review of software.''' Programmers should perform the appropriate tests to the pieces of software they work with, and should check for errors and system security holes to make sure that the programs are well implemented.
* '''Not engage in deceptive financial practices such as bribery, double billing, or other improper financial practices.''' Programmers are exposed to be participants in illegal activities to get money. They get involved in them due to threats, economic issues, or simply because they want to obtain easy money by taking advantage of their knowledge about how computer systems work. This guideline prohibits programmer involvement in such unlawful actions.
* '''Improve their ability to create safe, reliable, and useful quality software.''' Since [[technology]] advances faster year by year, and so does virtual criminality, the need of well-structured and designed programs is increasing. Computer systems get old and limited by new ones and new devices. Programmers should “further their knowledge of developments in the analysis, specification, [[Software design|design]], development, [[Software maintenance|maintenance]], and testing software and related documents” (Software Engineering Code of Ethics and Professional Practice)&lt;ref name="ieee" /&gt; in order to create better pieces of software.

== University's Role ==

University indirectly helps to form [[software developer]]s that will follow programming ethics{{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}. According to Dr. Stephen Blythe, computer science professor at [[Lindenwood University]], the [[Computer science|Computer Science]] department of this university has made a goal to encourage students in classes to put in practice good conducts when [[Computer programming|programming]]. He adds that the application of ethical guidelines might not be clearly visible during the first years of the computer science career. However, “as students get to be a senior in this field, there is more information about programming ethics principles that is conveyed to them because it will be useful when they go out to the business world” (Blythe).&lt;ref name="blythe"&gt;Blythe, Stephen. Personal Interview. 30 Sep. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ohio University]] also trains their computer science majors on the field of programming ethics. They expect every student to adhere to ACM’s principles and responsibilities before getting to [[Computer programming|programming]]. It is also needed that the students fully comprehend and follow those guidelines (World of Programming).&lt;ref name="ohio"&gt;“World of Programming.” Ohio University. Web. 29 Sep 2013. &lt;http://ace.cs.ohiou.edu/new_users/ethics.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal consequences ==

Breaking any of the guidelines established on IEEE and ACM’s Codes of Ethics or other codes will result in an immediate termination of the membership to the correspondent [[professional association]]s. Moreover, Dr. Stephen Blythe expresses that a programmer who commits any violation of the Code of Ethics can also be prosecuted to US laws because of the implicit relationship programming ethics have with business laws, agreements, contracts, etc.&lt;ref name="blythe" /&gt; Harm generated to third parties is punishable in the US legal system.

Intentionally making mistakes like creating insecure passwords, or leaving security holes in the implementation of a program that could put on risk the system’s security and reliability exposes the programmer to trial (Savage).&lt;ref name="savage" /&gt; The specific sanctions that might result from a programming-related legal dispute will vary from one state to another. Sanctions may vary from corrective actions, to a certain number of hours of social work, or to months or years in jail.

A '''reborn doll''' is a manufactured [[doll]] that has been transformed by an artist to resemble a human infant with as much [[Realism (arts)|realism]] as possible. The process of creating a reborn doll is referred to as '''reborning''' and the doll artists are referred to as '''reborners'''.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Mont"/&gt;
Reborn dolls are also known as ''lifelike dolls'' or ''reborn baby dolls''.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Channel Four"/&gt;

The hobby of creating reborn baby dolls began around 1995 when doll enthusiasts wanted more realistic dolls.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; Since then, an industry surrounding reborn dolls has emerged.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;
Reborn dolls are primarily purchased on the internet but are available at fairs.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Depending on [[craftsmanship]], they range in price from hundreds to thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=kohl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt;

Reborning involves numerous time consuming steps. The most basic form of the process involves taking a vinyl doll, adding multiple hand painted layers of [[paint]], and adding other physical features to the doll.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; Artists can pick different brands to best suit the doll they wish to create.&lt;ref name="Baby Reborn"/&gt; Reborn artists can also buy reborn doll kits that are sculpted by reborn sculpt artists. A kit includes the vinyl doll parts. Customers can then purchase a reborn doll by choosing a kit (name) by sculptor (name) and have it reborned by a reborn artist (name) e.g. Adam by Mary reborned by Ann. Consumers can purchase a wide range of supplies for creating their own reborn.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kinsey"/&gt; Making a doll from a kit allows artists to omit some steps in the fabrication process and begin with a blank canvas.&lt;ref name="Kinsey"/&gt; Many supplies are needed for both external and internal modifications of reborns to make the doll seem more realistic.&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt;

Some consumers of reborn dolls use them to replace a child they once lost, or a child that has grown up.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Others collect reborns as they would regular dolls. These dolls are sometimes played with as if they are an [[infant]].&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Critics debate whether reborn dolls are harmful, or whether these dolls can help in the grieving process.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Today show"/&gt; Because of their realistic appearance, reborn dolls have occasionally been mistaken for real babies and "rescued" from parked cars after being reported to the police by passers-by.&lt;ref name="Channel Four"/&gt;&lt;ref name="National Ledger"/&gt;

==History==
The craft of making reborn dolls began in the United States in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSL03734403|title=Attract, repel: lifelike dolls are collector cult|author=Taylor, Sophie|date=17 July 2008|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=2009-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reborning follows a long tradition of collectors, artists, and manufacturers restoring and enhancing dolls in order to portray more realism.&lt;ref name="Mont"/&gt; The internet has allowed doll artists and collectors to create an [[online society]] focused on reborn dolls.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; In 2002, the first reborn was offered on [[eBay]].&lt;ref name="Mont"&gt;Montcombroux, Vieve. "Simply Irresistible: What is that elusive quality that makes reborns so hard to resist?". ''Doll Reader Magazine''. June/July 2008. Retrieved 2009-07-17&lt;/ref&gt; This has expanded the reborn market allowing artists to open online stores which function figuratively as [[Nursery (room)|nurseries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Nakamura| first = Lisa| title = Digitizing race: Visual Cultures of the Internet| publisher = The University of Minnesota Press| year = 2008| isbn = 978-0-8166-4612-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[niche market]] for the dolls began with doll collectors who admired the superior lifelike accuracy of the doll. The market quickly reached those who wanted to use the doll as an emotional outlet, either to mother or for [[therapeutic]] purposes.&lt;ref name="Mont"/&gt; [[Mass media]] coverage has helped to develop the phenomenon in other countries.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; Reborning enjoys popularity in the United Kingdom and Australia, but has also reached Canada, the rest of Europe, Africa, and Latin America.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; Doll manufacturers have also taken advantage of the trend and sell supplies, tools, and accessories catering to reborn followers.&lt;ref name="Mont"/&gt; This has allowed reborners to invent new techniques causing the dolls to become increasingly realistic over time.&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; Magazines, books, organizations, and [[Convention (meeting)|conventions]] dedicated to reborn dolls have been started as a result of this popularity.

==Fabrication==
The appearance of the doll depends on the creator; however, certain reborn artists allow customers to customize their doll, usually using a photograph to replicate a particular infant.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26970782/|title=Unliving Dolls: Women Collect Fake Babies|author=Celizic, Mike|date=1 October 2008|publisher=MSNBC News|accessdate=2009-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reborning===
Any type of vinyl doll can be used for reborning.  Dolls vary by size, shape, and materials, making some more desirable or popular than others. According to ''Doll Reader Magazine'', Berenguer Babies, Zapf, Lee Middleton, [[Bradford Exchange|Ashton-Drake Galleries]], Apple Valley, and Secrist Dolls are doll companies that make dolls which are easy to transform into reborns.&lt;ref name="Baby Reborn"&gt;Titterton, Kevin."Baby Reborn".

===Newborning===
If a reborn is created from a kit as opposed to whole manufactured doll, it may be called newborning.&lt;ref name="Kinsey"&gt;Kinsey, Mindy. "A Reborning Rookie". ''Doll Reader Magazine''. Jun/Jul2009, Vol. 37 Issue 5, p66-66. Retrieved 2009-07-25&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturers have reacted to the growing trend of artists transforming dolls by hiring reborn artists to become doll sculptors and design doll molds and kits.&lt;ref name="Mont"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Realism Rules"&gt;"Ashton Drake Galleries: Realism Rules". ''Doll Reader Magazine''. Feb 2007.Vol. 35 Issue 2, p38-41. Retrieved 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt; When newborning from a kit, the first several steps of the process are completed by reborn sculpt artists and doll manufacturers. The kits come with an already disassembled baby and select supplies.&lt;ref name="Kinsey"/&gt; Other supplies not provided in the kit can be purchased separately.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; The Secrist doll company started making Reborn Doll Kits in 2005. In 2009, they began producing supplies, tools, and tutorial videos specifically for reborning or newborning.&lt;ref name="Secrist"&gt;"Secrist Doll Company: Teaching and Training Reborning Enthusiasts".

===Process===
[[File:Donna-Lee-originals-Corbin (1).jpg|thumb|alt=Before and after image of a doll sculpted out of clay, reproduced into a vinyl kit and reborned|Vinyl doll kit shown side by side (unpainted parts &amp; painted "reborn" doll). The doll has a "chest/belly plate".]]

The technique of reborning a play doll typically involves a number of steps. To begin the doll is taken apart and factory paint is removed.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A06E2D8153AF933A15751C0A9639C8B63|author=Walker, Rob|title= The Way We Live Now: Consumed: Hyperreality Hobbying|date=20 February 2005|publisher=New York Times Company|accessdate=2009-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then a blue color wash may be applied to give the appearance of realistic baby skin undertones.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kohl/&gt; For dolls with an awake appearance eyes must be replaced.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=kohl/&gt; The outer layer of the vinyl doll is given its skin tone by adding dozens of layers of flesh colored paint.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; If heat set paints are used, the doll parts must be heat set by baking them inside an oven or by using a heatgun after each layer of paint is applied.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; Lighter skin tone dolls can take 15 to 30 layers.&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; The effects of the blue color wash combined with the outside layers of paint creates the appearance of [[vein]]s, and gives the doll its newborn mottled look.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; Manicured nails and opening of the nose holes are other details that are added during this process.&lt;ref name=kohl/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt;  There are air dry paints now available to reborn artists, sold under several brand names.  Many feel that repeated baking of vinyl can cause it to break down over time.  In addition, there are fumes and chemicals released during the heating process.&lt;ref name="Are We Poisoning Ourselves?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hunnybunsrebornsupply.com/are-we-poisoning-ourselves/ |title=Are We Poisoning Ourselves? |date=2010-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next step is to apply hair. The hair can either be done in one of two ways; wigging, rooting or microrooting.&lt;ref name=kohl/&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; when rooting hair is added 1–4 hair strands per plug. When microrooting, hair is added strand by strand.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; This can take up to 30 or more hours per head. Once the hair is finished, the original vinyl body is weighted with a soft stuffed body filled with pellets/fine glass beads/fiberfill.The weight corresponds with its age to achieve a real effect.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; Various additions also can be added to give the doll an even more life like appearance. Reborns heads are often weighted, so that owners have to support the head like one would a real newborn. Purchasers can have [[magnet]]s attached inside the mouth or head for attaching a pacifier or hair bows. Electronic devices that mimic a heart beat, or make the chest rise and fall to simulate breathing are common.&lt;ref name=Macleans&gt;Shimo, Alexandra."It's not a doll. It's a baby". ''Maclean's''. 7 April 2008. Vol. 121 Issue 13, pp. 48–49. Retrieved 2009-07-16&lt;/ref&gt; Reborns can come with an [[umbilical cord]], baby fat, heat packs to make the reborn warm to the touch, or voice boxes that mimic infant sounds.&lt;ref name="Out and About"/&gt;&lt;ref name="North"/&gt; For preemie dolls, they may come in incubators with a breathing apparatus attached to their nose.&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt;

==Collecting==
Institutions have developed to aid reborn hobbyists with [[collecting]] by providing information, products, and [[social networking]]. These institutions include magazines, and associations and organizations which sponsor conferences and conventions. Collectors and artists have described their reasons for purchasing and/or creating reborn dolls as varying from a love of dolls to a passion for art.&lt;ref&gt;April 2008 and May/June 2008 issues of Lifelike Dolls Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Purchasing===
Reborn dolls are usually found online and can be purchased through [[eBay]], artists' online stores (often termed nurseries), and conventions/fairs. Incomplete crafting "kits" to create original reborns can also be purchased from various online stores.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; There is a large price range depending on the quality of the doll, the sculpt used and the experience of the artist, they can sell anywhere from hundreds to thousands of dollars.&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; There are many factors to look for when purchasing a reborn.&lt;ref name=kohl&gt;Kohlscheen, Cindy. "10 Questions to Ask when Purchasing a Reborn Doll". ''Doll Reader Magazine''. June/July 2006. Retrieved 2009-07-14&lt;/ref&gt; If the [[complexion]] is too dark this is called a blue baby, and indicates it was dyed excessively or uses colored sand for weight that could have seeped into the vinyl. The type of material used to weight the reborn should be considered because some materials do not react well with vinyl and will cause it to deteriorate. The doll should not be shiny. This indicates the doll was washed with acetone before painting, which prevents the color from correctly sticking to the doll's surface. It may also be caused by the type of paint used to color the doll. This is corrected with a special matte [[varnish]]. The parts used are important, as original parts may be replaced. The replacement parts must be appropriately proportioned with the doll and made of quality material. At times having the original body retains the doll's value either because it was made to fit that specific doll, or the artist left a signature mark. Eye brand, size, fitting, and alignment should be closely examined. Another feature to observe is the type of paint used for coloring and whether the doll is realistic in its details such as veins and newborn imperfections. The type of hair and technique used in applying the hair may determine the quality. Some artists open the nose, the holes should be correctly shaped, and the nails should be properly manicured.&lt;ref name=kohl/&gt;

===Associations and organizations===
The International Reborn Doll Artists (IRDA) originated at the first conference for reborn doll artists on January 21, 2005. The IRDA group was assembled in order to offer education for improved skills in the art of reborn doll creation. They offer skill building tutorials and instruction so reborners can remain up to date on the newest techniques and meet others who share a common interest in reborn doll fabrication. A reborn artist can join the organization at any skill level, but members are asked to uphold a list of standards that were created by the IRDA's executive board. This [[ethical code]] stipulates the guidelines members are to follow in advertising, listing, and describing their dolls in order to divide credit fairly between manufacturers, sculptors, and artists.&lt;ref name="Out and About"&gt;"Out and About People and Places: International Reborn Doll Artists". ''Doll Reader Magazine''. June/July 2005. Vol. 33 Issue 5, p18-19. Retrieved 2009-07-22&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conferences and conventions===

==Social issues and reactions==
[[File:Real Looking Reborn Doll.jpg|200px|thumb|A typical reborn doll. Note the added cloth body on the limbs, and the "rear plate" to make it more realistic.]]
The overwhelming majority of reborn customers are older women.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; The process of buying a reborn can be done to simulate an adoption process, rather than a prosaic sale of a product. As part of this, the dolls often come with fake [[birth certificate]]s or adoption certificates.&lt;ref name=Macleans/&gt; Many women collect reborns as they would a non-reborn doll, whilst others purchase them to fill a void of a lost child and may treat reborns as living babies.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Media features and public receptions have used such adjectives as "creepy" to describe the reborns. This can be explained by the [[uncanny valley]] hypothesis. This states that as objects become more lifelike they gain an increasing empathetic response, until a certain point at which the response changes to repulsion. [[Department store]]s have refused to stock the dolls because of this reaction, claiming they are too lifelike.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parentcentral.ca/parent/article/542819 |title=Are these baby dolls cute or creepy? |work=Toronto Star |date=November 25, 2008 |author=Nancy J. White}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Emotional bond===
Many reborn owners are simply doll collectors, while others have experienced [[miscarriage]], [[stillbirth]] or [[neonatal loss]], have no means for [[adoption]], or suffer from [[empty nest syndrome]]. They may utilize the dolls as a substitute for a child. Some owners dress the dolls, wash their hair, and may even take them for walks in strollers and take them shopping.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Reborn hobbyists refer to the emotional response to holding their dolls as ''cuddle therapy''.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt; Studies suggest cuddling a baby causes a release of [[hormone]]s which produce a sense of emotional well-being, and some psychologists believe that this may happen with realistic dolls as well. Consultant [[psychiatrist]] [[Rajendra Persaud|Raj Persaud]] explains that mothering a real newborn baby releases the hormone [[oxytocin]] in the mother, and hypothesizes that this may explain why "reborn mothers" become emotionally attached to the reborn baby doll.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Richard and Judy"&gt;{{cite video|people= [[Richard and Judy]] (hosts), [[Raj Persaud]] (guest)|title=6 January 2008 Richard &amp; Judy segment on ''My Fake Baby''|url=http://www.channel4.com/entertainment/tv/microsites/R/richardandjudy/|date=2008-01-06 |medium=Television Program|publisher=[[Channel 4]] |location=United Kingdom}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For grieving parents who form emotional bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend that they are not replacing children but remembering them.&lt;ref name="North"&gt;"Grieving parents turning to `super-realistic' dolls". ''Northern Territory News''. 4 March 2007. Section: News, pg. 008. Retrieved 2009-07-05&lt;/ref&gt; Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the [[NYU]] school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing.&lt;ref name="ABC"/&gt; Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]] supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents.&lt;ref name="Today show"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/26974105/ns/today_relationships-getting_personal/|title=Fake babies ease women's anxiety, sadness: Dr. Gail Saltz looks at the psychology of adults who "play" with reborn doll|author=Saltz, Gail|date=3 October 2008|publisher=MSNBC interactive|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ian James, a doctor at the Centre for the Health of the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.&lt;ref name="reuters"/&gt;

===Law enforcement incidents===
Reborn dolls look so real they have been mistaken for real babies. In July 2008, police in [[Queensland]], Australia smashed a car window to rescue what seemed like an unconscious baby only to find it was a reborn doll. The police stated that the doll was "incredibly lifelike" and that bystanders who thought a baby was dying were frightened by the incident.&lt;ref name="car news"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,23599,24019578-1248,00.html|title=Frantic rescue effort saves doll, not baby|author=Green, Glenis|date=15 July 2008|publisher=News Limited|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar incident was reported in the [[United States]], in which police broke the window of a [[Hummer]] to save a baby that turned out to be a reborn doll.&lt;ref name="National Ledger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalledger.com/cgi-bin/artman/exec/view.cgi?archive=27&amp;num=21586|title=Scary Photos: Reborn Baby Dolls Bring Rescue Effort, Fool Police|author=Johnson, Linda|date=16 July 2008|publisher=The National Ledger|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 reborners uncovered a [[blog]]ging [[hoax]] in which a woman–described by ''[[ABC News]]'' as an "anti-abortion blogger"–claimed she was [[pregnant]] with a [[terminally ill]] child. She opened a [[P.O. box]] in order to receive gifts, money, and prayers. The hoax was uncovered when reborners reading the blog realized that the pictures of the baby posted on the [[blog]] were actually a reborn doll that they recognized through the familiar reborn sculpture.&lt;ref name="ABC News"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/Story?id=7827909&amp;page=1|title=Anti-Abortion Blogger Admits Hoax: Blogger Claiming Pregnancy With Sick Child Caught in Web of Lies by Readers|author=Goldman, Russel|date=13 June 2009|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ResNets.svg|thumb|right|Canonical form of a residual neural network. A layer ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1 is skipped over activation from ''ℓ''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;2.]]
A '''residual neural network''' is an [[artificial neural network]] (ANN) of a kind that builds on constructs known from [[pyramidal cell]]s in the [[cerebral cortex]]{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. Residual neural networks do this by utilizing ''skip connections'' or ''short-cuts'' to jump over some layers. In its limit as ''ResNets'' it will only skip over a single layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=He|first=Kaiming|last2=Zhang|first2=Xiangyu|last3=Ren|first3=Shaoqing|last4=Sun|first4=Jian|date=2015-12-10|title=Deep Residual Learning for Image Recognition|eprint=1512.03385|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt; With an additional weight matrix to learn the skip weights it is referred to as ''HighwayNets''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Srivastava|first=Rupesh Kumar|last2=Greff|first2=Klaus|last3=Schmidhuber|first3=Jürgen|date=2015-05-02|title=Highway Networks|eprint=1505.00387|class=cs.LG}}&lt;/ref&gt; With several parallel skips it is referred to as ''DenseNets''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|last=Huang|first=Gao|last2=Liu|first2=Zhuang|last3=Weinberger|first3=Kilian Q.|last4=van der Maaten|first4=Laurens|date=2016-08-24|title=Densely Connected Convolutional Networks|eprint=1608.06993|class=cs.CV}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, a non-residual neural network is described as a ''plain network'' in the context of residual neural networks.

The brain has structures similar to residual nets, as cortical [[layer VI]] neurons gets input from [[layer I]], skipping over all intermediary layers{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}. In the figure (below, on the right), this compares to signals from the (3) apical dendrite skipping over layers, while the (2) basal dendrite collecting signals from the previous and/or same layer.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Some research indicates that there are additional structures here, so this explanation is somewhat simplified.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Winterer|first=Jochen|last2=Maier|first2=Nikolaus|last3=Wozny|first3=Christian|last4=Beed|first4=Prateep|last5=Breustedt|first5=Jörg|last6=Evangelista|first6=Roberta|last7=Peng|first7=Yangfan|last8=D’Albis|first8=Tiziano|last9=Kempter|first9=Richard|title=Excitatory Microcircuits within Superficial Layers of the Medial Entorhinal Cortex|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.041|journal=Cell Reports|volume=19|issue=6|pages=1110–1116|doi=10.1016/j.celrep.2017.04.041|pmid=28494861|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar structures exists for other layers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fitzpatrick|first=David|date=1996-05-01|title=The Functional Organization of Local Circuits in Visual Cortex: Insights from the Study of Tree Shrew Striate Cortex|url=https://academic.oup.com/cercor/article-abstract/6/3/329/385390|journal=Cerebral Cortex|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=329–341|doi=10.1093/cercor/6.3.329|issn=1047-3211}}&lt;/ref&gt; How many layers in the cerebral cortex compare to layers in an artificial neural network is not clear, neither if every area in cerebral cortex exhibits the same structure, but over large areas they look quite similar.

One motivation for skipping over layers in ANNs is to avoid the problem of [[Vanishing gradient problem|vanishing gradients]] by reusing activations from a previous layer until the layer next to the current one have learned its weights. During training the weights will adapt to mute the previous layer and amplify the layer next to the current. In the simplest case only the weights for the connection to the next to the current layer is adapted, with no explicit weights for the upstream previous layer. This usually works properly when a single non-linear layer is stepped over, or in the case when the intermediate layers are all linear. If not, then an explicit weight matrix should be learned for the skipped connection.

The intuition on why this works is that the neural network collapses into fewer layers in the initial phase, which makes it easier to learn, and thus gradually expands the layers as it learns more of the [[feature (machine learning)|feature space]]. During later learning, when all layers are expanded, it will stay closer to the manifold and thus learn faster. A neural network without residual parts will explore more of the feature space. This makes it more vulnerable to small perturbations that cause it to leave the manifold altogether, and require extra training data to get back on track.

== Forward propagation ==
For single skips, the layers may be indexed either as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell-2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; or as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell+2&lt;/math&gt;. (Script &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; used for clarity, usually it is written as a simple ''l''.) The two indexing systems are convenient when describing skips as going backward or forward. As signal flows forward through the network it is easier to describe the skip as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell+k&lt;/math&gt; from a given layer, but as a learning rule (back propagation) it is easier to describe which activation layer you reuse as &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell-k&lt;/math&gt;, where  &lt;math display="inline"&gt;k-1&lt;/math&gt; is the skip number.

If there is a weight matrix &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^{\ell-1,\ell}&lt;/math&gt;for connection weights from layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell-1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and a weight matrix &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^{\ell-2,\ell}&lt;/math&gt; for connection weights from layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell-2&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, then the [[#forward|forward propagation]] through the activation function would be (aka ''HighwayNets'')
: &lt;math id="forward"&gt;\begin{align} a^\ell &amp; := \mathbf{g}(W^{\ell-1,\ell} \cdot a^{\ell-1} + b^\ell + W^{\ell-2,\ell} \cdot a^{\ell-2}) \\
&amp; := \mathbf{g}(Z^\ell + W^{\ell-2,\ell} \cdot a^{\ell-2})
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
where we have
: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a^\ell&lt;/math&gt; the activations (outputs) of neurons in layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\mathbf{g}&lt;/math&gt; the activation function for layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^{\ell-1,\ell}&lt;/math&gt; the weight matrix for neurons between layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell-1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;Z^\ell = W^{\ell-1,\ell} \cdot a^{\ell-1} + b^\ell&lt;/math&gt; 

If there is no explicit matrix &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^{\ell-2,\ell}&lt;/math&gt; (aka ''ResNets''), then the forward propagation through the activation function simplifies to
: &lt;math&gt;a^\ell := \mathbf{g}(Z^\ell + a^{\ell-2})&lt;/math&gt;
Another way to formulate this is to substitute an identity matrix for &lt;math display="inline"&gt;W^{\ell-2,\ell}&lt;/math&gt;, but that is only valid when the dimensions match. This is somewhat confusingly called an ''identity block'', which means that the activations from layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell-2&lt;/math&gt; are passed to layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt; without a weight matrix.

In the cerebral cortex such forward skips are done for several layers. Usually all forward skips start from the same layer, and successively connect to later layers. In the general case this will be expressed as (aka ''DenseNets'')

: &lt;math&gt;a^\ell := \mathbf{g} \left( Z^\ell + \sum_{k=2}^K W^{\ell-k,\ell} \cdot a^{\ell-k} \right) &lt;/math&gt;

== Backward propagation ==
During [[backpropagation]] learning for the normal path
: &lt;math id="normal_back"&gt; \Delta w^{\ell-1,\ell} := -\eta \frac{\partial E^\ell}{\partial w^{\ell-1,\ell}} = -\eta a^\ell \cdot \delta^\ell&lt;/math&gt;
and for the skip paths (note that they are close to identical)
: &lt;math&gt; \Delta w^{\ell-2,\ell} := -\eta \frac{\partial E^\ell}{\partial w^{\ell-2,\ell}} = -\eta a^\ell \cdot \delta^\ell&lt;/math&gt;
In both cases we have
: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\eta&lt;/math&gt; a learning rate (&lt;math display="inline"&gt;\eta &lt; 0)&lt;/math&gt;,
: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\delta^\ell&lt;/math&gt; the error signal of neurons at layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;, and
: &lt;math display="inline"&gt;a_i^\ell&lt;/math&gt; the activation of neurons at layer &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\ell&lt;/math&gt;
If the skip path has fixed weights (e.g. the identity matrix, see above), then they will not be updated. If they can be updated, then the rule will be an ordinary backprop update rule.

In the general case there can be &lt;math display="inline"&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; skip path weight matrices, thus
: &lt;math&gt; \Delta w^{\ell-k,\ell} := -\eta \frac{\partial E^\ell}{\partial w^{\ell-k,\ell}} = -\eta a^\ell \cdot \delta^\ell&lt;/math&gt;

As the learning rules are similar the weight matrices can be merged and learned in the same step.

'''Richard Gordon&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th ed., vol. 3, ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, 1972, 'Lancelyn Green of Poulton-Lancelyn' pedigree&lt;/ref&gt; Lancelyn Green''' (10 July 1953 – 27 March 2004) was a British scholar of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] and [[Sherlock Holmes]], generally considered the world's foremost scholar of these topics.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.visitportsmouth.co.uk/conandoyle/investigate/richard-lancelyn-green | title=Introduction to Richard Lancelyn Green | work=The Arthur Conan Doyle Collection Lancelyn Green Bequest | publisher=[[Portsmouth City Council]] | accessdate=30 December 2017 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113061958/http://www.conandoylecollection.co.uk/about-richard-lancelyn-green.html | archivedate=13 November 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Lancelyn Green was born in [[Bebington]], Cheshire, England,&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; the younger son of [[Roger Lancelyn Green]] and June, daughter of Sidney Herbert Burdett.&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th ed., vol. 3, ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, 1972, 'Lancelyn Green of Poulton-Lancelyn' pedigree&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an author known for his popular adaptations of the [[Arthurian]], [[Robin Hood]] and [[Homer]]ic myths, and his mother was a drama teacher and adjudicator. The Lancelyn Green family had been lords of the manor of Poulton-Lancelyn in Cheshire since at least 1093; Randle Greene (sic) had married Elizabeth, daughter and heiress of William Lancelyn, in the reign of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]].&lt;ref&gt;Burke's Landed Gentry, 18th ed., vol. 3, ed. Hugh Montgomery-Massingberd, 1972, 'Lancelyn Green of Poulton-Lancelyn' pedigree&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancelyn Green attended [[Bradfield College]] in Berkshire, and then [[University College, Oxford]], where he earned a degree in [[English studies|English]]. 
After leaving college, he travelled extensively, throughout Europe, [[India]] and South-east Asia.

==Scholarly pursuits==
Lancelyn Green was a collector of Sherlock Holmes-related material, and was co-editor of the first comprehensive bibliography of Arthur Conan Doyle, ''A Bibliography of A. Conan Doyle'', with John Michael Gibson, and also a series of collections of Doyle's writings that had never before been collected in book form: ''Uncollected Stories'' (1982), ''Essays on Photography'' (1982), and ''Letters to the Press'' (1986), all co-edited with Gibson.  The Conan Doyle bibliography earned Lancelyn Green and Gibson a Special [[Edgar Award]] from the [[Mystery Writers of America]] during 1984.

Lancelyn Green also published other books on his own. ''The Uncollected Sherlock Holmes'' (1983) anthologised [[Canon of Sherlock Holmes|Doyle's non-canon Sherlock Holmes writings]], ''The Further Adventures of Sherlock Holmes'' (1985) is a collection of Holmes pastiches and parodies, and ''Letters to Sherlock Holmes'' (1985) collected the most interesting of letters to Sherlock Holmes, arriving at the headquarters of the [[Abbey National|Abbey National Building Society]], whose address in Baker Street was the closest to the fictional "221b".

Lancelyn Green was something of a showman, appearing as a 19th-century music hall master of ceremonies at events of the Sherlock Holmes Society, of which he was chairman from 1996 to 1999, and dressing in period costume to visit [[Reichenbach Falls]], where Sherlock Holmes was thought to have died until Conan Doyle "resurrected" him eight years later. For his encyclopaedic knowledge of Arthur Conan Doyle and Sherlock Holmes, and for his scholarly works, he was well regarded among scholars of Holmes.

Later in life, Lancelyn Green worked extensively on notes and collecting material for a planned three-volume biography of Conan Doyle, which remained unfinished at the time of his death. He lamented the legal wranglings needed to gain rights to Conan Doyle's private papers and manuscripts, which were planned to be sold at an auction.

During August 2004, it was announced that Lancelyn Green had bequeathed his extensive collection on Conan Doyle to the [[Portsmouth]] Library Service. Lancelyn Green had chosen the city because Conan Doyle had a medical practice there, and it was where the two first Sherlock Holmes books were written.

==The collection==
As early as the age of seven years, Lancelyn Green began his collection of [[Sherlockiana]], and created his version of 221b Baker Street in an attic room at [[Poulton Hall]], gleaning material for a few shillings at junk shops and from the family's own [[Victoriana]]. Later he began to assemble his literary collection, and would add any edition of Doyle's output, as well as posters, ephemera and novelty items with a Sherlock Holmes theme or Doyle association.

By the date of his death Lancelyn Green had been collecting voraciously for more than 40 years and without doubt possessed the largest collection of Doyleiana that existed privately (and probably the largest such collection that ever could exist now that it has been bequeathed to the City of [[Portsmouth]]).&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; The collection is now held by the [[Portsmouth City Museum ]] where exhibitions have created much interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Conan Doyle Collection|url = http://www.visitportsmouth.co.uk/conandoyle|website = www.visitportsmouth.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The patron of the collection is [[Stephen Fry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Charles Dickens and Arthur Conan Doyle Collections|url = https://www.portsmouth.gov.uk/ext/events-parks-and-whats-on/libraries/charles-dickens-and-arthur-conan-doyle-collections.aspx|website = www.portsmouth.gov.uk|date = 2013-11-27|accessdate = 2015-12-09|first = Mr Services|last = User}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last days and aftermath==
Lancelyn Green suspected that the Conan Doyle papers being auctioned at [[Christie's]] were part of a collection that Dame [[Jean Conan Doyle]], the author's daughter, actually wanted the [[British Library]] to have.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1478814/Case-of-the-Sherlock-Holmes-fanatic-who-killed-himself-but-made-it-look-like-murder.html | title=Case of the Sherlock Holmes fanatic 'who killed himself but made it look like murder' | first=Elizabeth | last=Day | newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] | date=12 December 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He attempted to stop the auction, but was unsuccessful.

In the weeks before his death, he told friends and journalists that an unidentified American was following him, and that he feared his opposition to the auction could endanger his life. His behaviour became increasingly erratic, and once he insisted on speaking to a visitor in the garden because he said his apartment was bugged.

During the night of his death, his sister telephoned his apartment,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/may/23/books.booksnews | title=Return of the curse of Conan Doyle? | first=David | last=Smith | newspaper=[[The Observer]] | date=23 May 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; obtaining only his answering machine, which had a new message with an American voice (this was found later to be the standard message tape supplied with the machine). Her worries about this resulted in the discovery of Lancelyn Green's body, face down on his bed, garrotted with a shoelace that had been tightened with the handle of a wooden spoon.

Murder was suspected, and there was some newspaper gossip. Because the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] (CID) was not called at the start, any evidence that might have been useful for a murder enquiry had been disturbed or removed during the course of dealing with the body.  

The [[Coroner]] returned an open verdict. Many of Lancelyn Green's best friends thought it was not in his nature to commit suicide.  However, some thought the death to have been an elaborate suicide, intended to seem like murder, to cast suspicion upon one of his rivals. This replicates the plot of one of the last Sherlock Holmes mysteries, "[[The Problem of Thor Bridge]]", in which a woman commits suicide in a manner meant to implicate the woman with whom her husband had been flirting.&lt;ref&gt;David Grann, "[http://www.newyorker.com/archive/2004/12/13/041213fa_fact_grann Mysterious Circumstances]." ''The New Yorker'', 2004-12-13. Reprinted in Grann's anthology of essays, ''[[The Devil and Sherlock Holmes]]: Tales of Murder, Madness, and Obsession.'' Doubleday, March 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lancelyn Green's bizarre death later inspired two novels that deal with a fictional Holmes expert who dies in exactly the same manner as Lancelyn Green. Those books are ''[[The Art of Detection]]'' (2006) by [[Laurie R. King]] and ''The Sherlockian'' (2010) by [[Graham Moore (writer)|Graham Moore]]. Each novel's plot not only features a Holmes expert but a missing Doyle manuscript and each explores the possibility of suicide disguised as murder as was suspected in Lancelyn Green's death.

'''Romulus''' is a fictional comic book supervillain appearing in books published by [[Marvel Comics]], in particular those featuring [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]]. He is the leader of the Lupines, a species resembling humans that he claims evolved from [[Canidae|canines]] instead of [[primate]]s through [[convergent evolution]]. He is a shadowy character whose origin and motives remain a mystery. He is shown to have orchestrated most major events in the life of Wolverine, manipulating and controlling him for most of his life.

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Jeph Loeb]] and artist [[Simone Bianchi (artist)|Simone Bianchi]], the character first appeared obscured by shadow in ''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #50 (March 2007), and made his first full appearance in ''[[Wolverine: Origins]]'' #39 (August 2009).

==Fictional character biography==
Romulus is first seen in several flashbacks that [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] experiences, later explained by [[Wild Child (comics)|Wild Child]] to have been induced by Romulus himself. He is shown leading the Lupines in prehistoric&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #50-51&lt;/ref&gt; and barbaric&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #52&lt;/ref&gt; times, being an emperor in [[Ancient Rome]],&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #53&lt;/ref&gt; as well as being the main force behind [[Weapon X]].&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #54&lt;/ref&gt;

In the present, Romulus restored [[Feral (comics)|Feral]] and [[Thornn]]'s feline look after their depowerment on [[Decimation (comics)|M-Day]], augmented Wild Child's powers greatly, and seemed to have erased all humanity from [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] causing the latter's death at the hands of Wolverine (later it was revealed Sabretooth was a clone).&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' vol. 3 #55&lt;/ref&gt; Romulus did all of this to reveal himself to Wolverine.

Romulus was also the one who took [[Daken]] from his dead mother's womb&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; and raised him as a ruthless killer. [[Nick Fury]] revealed to Wolverine that Romulus has been manipulating people from his family's bloodline for centuries, and that he plans for Daken to become the next-generation Weapon X.&lt;ref name="Wolverine: Origins #33"&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #33&lt;/ref&gt; This was achieved through [[Tinkerer]] who bonded the metal from the Muramasa blade to Daken's inner claws.&lt;ref name="Wolverine: Origins #33"/&gt; Daken hinted he complied with the process because of his own agenda. Romulus told Daken to kill all the Weapon X experiments that gave them a healing factor with his Muramasa claws. He killed every one except [[Deadpool]].

He appears to have ties with [[Russia]]n authorities, arranging [[Omega Red]]'s transfer to a regular Russian prison to set a trap for Wolverine.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #37&lt;/ref&gt; After Wolverine temporarily subdues Omega Red, he is captured by Wild Child, who reveals that Romulus made Logan and several villains battle each other, his agenda being vaguely described as him needing a successor. Moments after Wolverine uses the Muramasa blade to kill Omega Red, Romulus reveals himself in front of him, prepared for battle with four claws already extended (the three between the knuckles of his fingers and one extending from behind his thumb).&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #39&lt;/ref&gt; Wolverine attacks Romulus but is easily overpowered since he is only using the sword at this point. Romulus slashes and attacks Wolverine from the shadows as he reveals his plans. Telling Wolverine that everything has led up to this moment. Romulus is what Wolverine will become. Pushing Wolverine to the breaking point, he drops the sword and pops his claws, much to Romulus' amusement. However, Wolverine fights back and gains the upper hand and slashes at Romulus' hand, shattering what turned out to be a clawed gauntlet. Seeing that Romulus' claws are fake, Wolverine taunts him saying, "You're not what I'm gonna become... I'm what you've always wanted to be". Hearing this, Romulus blindly attacks Wolverine with his remaining claws only to be slashed open by Wolverine. Seemingly beaten, Romulus tells Wolverine that although he is at the top of the food chain, by making Daken in his own image, he has set the stage for a confrontation between Wolverine and his son. Only the most ruthless will survive. Only the one most like Romulus. Wolverine defeats Romulus, but leaves him alive saying that he will return when he is ready to finish the job.&lt;ref name="Origins40"&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #40&lt;/ref&gt; As Wolverine turns his back, Romulus seizes the opportunity to knock Wolverine unconscious with his own sword.{{issue|date=January 2013}} Romulus then leaves, but not before telling Wolverine to keep the Muramasa blade: he will need it.{{issue|date=January 2013}} After his confrontation with Wolverine he coordinates a successful assassination in [[Tokyo]] from what seems to be his base of operations, a European-style castle.{{issue|date=January 2013}} It is here that Romulus first begins to doubt his own understanding of Wolverine's actions.{{issue|date=January 2013}}

Wolverine decides to confront Romulus one last time, using the help of various other heroes and his son Daken. In the end, as Daken is about to kill Romulus, Logan has [[Cloak and Dagger (comics)|Cloak]] teleport him into the Dark Force dimension. For a second Wolverine thinks he should behead Romulus, just like he did with Creed, but in the end he decides to leave him stranded in the Dark Force dimension.&lt;ref name="Wolverine: Origins #48"&gt;''Wolverine: Origins'' #48&lt;/ref&gt;

However, thanks to Sabretooth's blackmailing life of Dagger, Romulus gets free from his prison. After a losing fight against Romulus, a mysterious woman with long red hair appears and tells Wolverine that the answers that he seeks are at the Weapon X facility.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #310&lt;/ref&gt; Following his fight with the Sabretooth clones, the mysterious woman appears to Wolverine again. She calls herself Remus and informs him that Romulus is her twin brother.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #311&lt;/ref&gt; She aids Wolverine in his struggle against Romulus and Sabretooth all while providing Wolverine with information about Romulus. She reveals to Wolverine that Romulus' claim about certain mutants evolving from canines rather than apes (referring to the Lupine) is untrue which Wolverine had long since guessed. She further reveals that the whole "Lupine Sapiens" story was all just an elaborate hoax by her brother intended to be a ruse for his real goal of creating a master race of natural mutants artificially enhanced by a new type of adamantium created using vibranium illegally mined from Wakanda, using Wolverine as a template.  After tracking Romulus to his stronghold somewhere in Italy, Wolverine brutally attacks and incapacitates Sabretooth before confronting Romulus. Wolverine finds Romulus immersed within a tank very similar to the one Wolverine was held in during the days of the Weapon X Program. Wolverine breaks open the tank and savagely assaults Romulus with his claws. He gouges away much of the right side of Romulus' face, revealing that the bones beneath have been bonded with adamantium. As Romulus heals, Wolverine asks what the purpose is of becoming an imitation of him. Romulus declares that he is not as he once was, as he has "taken the best from both Wolverine and Sabretooth", implying that his animal-like powers were artificially copied from Sabretooth (as his twin sister has none of those traits and her only powers shown is a healing-factor).  He reveals that he now has four adamantium claws from both his hands in exactly the same configuration he used on the gauntlets he wore.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #312&lt;/ref&gt; As he launches into his attack, Romulus says to Wolverine that having Romulus erase his memory and bond the adamantium to his skeleton was actually his idea rather than something that he was forced to endure as he's believed for so long (however, this assertion remains ambiguous). Romulus and Wolverine resume their battle with Wolverine ultimately proving victorious, resulting in Romulus being remanded to the Raft.&lt;ref&gt;''Wolverine'' Vol. 2 #313&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Little is known about the full extent of Romulus's powers. As with Wolverine, Romulus' primary power is an accelerated healing factor that allows him to rapidly regenerate damaged or destroyed tissue with far greater speed and efficiency than normal humans. The full limits of this power aren't known, but he has healed wounds that ripped away the flesh from the right side of his face, exposing the bone, within a matter of seconds. Romulus' healing factor also grants him virtual immunity to known diseases and renders him highly resistant to most forms of drugs. It also affords him greatly extended longevity by slowing his natural aging process to an extraordinary degree as he claims to be tens of thousands of years old. However, Romulus is known to mix exaggeration and half truths in order to perpetuate the mystique surrounding him, though Romulus is ancient. Since the appearance of Remus, she has confirmed that Romulus is at least several thousand years of age. While he does show signs of aging, such as his hair turning almost completely white where it was once black, Romulus still has the same physical vitality and overall appearance of his physical prime. Romulus' senses of sight, smell and hearing are also enhanced to unknown superhuman levels. While they constitute a separate power, their efficiency is still somewhat linked to his healing factor. Romulus also possesses some degree of superhuman strength, the limits of which aren't fully known, though it has been shown as sufficient to lift Wolverine by the arm over his head using one hand and hurl him across a room. Romulus' speed, agility, and reflexes are similarly enhanced. His healing factor grants him partial immunity to the fatigue toxins generated by his muscles during physical activity, so he has much greater stamina and endurance than an ordinary human. He can exert himself physically for at least several hours before the buildup of fatigue toxins in his blood begins to impair him. He also possesses a single, retractable claw at the tip of each finger as well as elongated canine teeth. Romulus' claws are extremely sharp and are capable of cutting most known conventional materials and flesh.

Romulus has also displayed some degree of telepathic capabilities during past confrontations with Wolverine. He has been able to enter Wolverine's mind and to manipulate his memories, even going so far as to be able to create false memories or to awaken memories that have been suppressed. However, his telepathic powers are nowhere near the level of [[Charles Xavier]], as Xavier has used his powers to shield Wolverine's mind from Romulus' influence for years.

After his return from the Dark Dimension, Romulus underwent the process of bonding adamantium to his skeleton. As a result, his bones are now virtually indestructible. Romulus has also had four adamantium claws implanted into each arm that have the same configuration as the claws mounted onto his gloves. As with his skeleton, these claws are virtually unbreakable and can cut nearly any known substance. 

Romulus is consistently depicted as being of exceptional stature, surpassing [[Sabretooth (comics)|Sabretooth]] in size. The [[font]] used for his words is unique, having a more ancient appearance than those of other characters. Although he often appears naked, he has been shown to wear clothes on several occasions, possibly making use of the fact that only a few living people can recognize him. Romulus has been seen wearing armor over his right knee which has a faint reminder of the adamantium armor worn by [[Cyber (Marvel Comics)|Cyber]].

His facial features are very similar to both Sabretooth and Wolverine. This is seen in his sideburns, canine fangs, pointy ears, and white eyes. His hair is almost solid white with the exception of his bangs, which are black. Romulus has been seen wearing his hair in a long pony tail in a way similar to Omega Red.&lt;ref name="Origins40"/&gt; Romulus also speaks with a unique accent. According to Wolverine, it sounds part Italian and part Japanese.

===Skills===
Romulus is extremely intelligent with detailed knowledge of genetics and other areas of science. Romulus also controls a vast criminal empire spread throughout the world and has contacts throughout the criminal underworld. Romulus is also a master manipulator that prefers to work behind the scenes. He is also a formidable hand-to-hand combatant with many thousands of years of experience and knowledge. He also has extensive knowledge of many foreign and ancient cultures as he has alleged to have participated in the rise and fall of many civilizations throughout his existence.

'''Sensory neuroscience''' is a subfield of [[neuroscience]] which explores the anatomy and physiology of [[neuron]]s that are part of [[sensory system]]s such as vision, hearing, and olfaction. Neurons in sensory regions of the brain respond to stimuli by firing one or more nerve impulses ([[action potential]]s) following stimulus presentation. How is information about the outside world [[neural encoding|encoded]] by the rate, timing, and pattern of action potentials? This so-called [[neural code]] is currently poorly understood and sensory neuroscience plays an important role in the attempt to decipher it. Looking at early sensory processing is advantageous since brain regions that are "higher up" (e.g. those involved in memory or emotion) contain neurons which encode more abstract representations. However, the hope is that there are unifying principles which govern how the brain encodes and processes information. Studying sensory systems is an important stepping stone in our understanding of brain function in general. 

==Typical experiments==
A typical experiment in sensory neuroscience involves the presentation of a series of relevant stimuli to an experimental subject while the subject's brain is being monitored.  This monitoring can be accomplished by noninvasive means such as [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) or [[electroencephalography]] (EEG), or by more invasive means such as [[electrophysiology]], the use of [[electrode]]s to record the electrical activity of single neurons or groups of neurons. fMRI measures changes in blood flow which related to the level of neural activity and provides low spatial and temporal resolution, but does provide data from the whole brain. In contrast,
Electrophysiology provides very high temporal resolution (the shapes of single [[Dendritic spike|spikes]] can be resolved) and data can be obtained from single cells. This is important since computations are performed within the [[dendrite]]s of individual neurons.

===Single neuron experiments===
In most of the [[central nervous system]], neurons communicate exclusively by sending each other [[action potential]]s, colloquially known as "spikes".  It is therefore thought that all of the information a [[sensory neuron]] encodes about the outside world can be inferred by the pattern of its spikes.  Current experimental techniques cannot measure individual spikes noninvasively.

A typical single neuron experiment will consist of isolating a neuron (that is, navigating the neuron until the experimentor finds a neuron which spikes in response to the type of stimulus to be presented, and (optionally) determining that all of the spikes observed indeed come from a single neuron), then presenting a stimulus protocol.  Because neural responses are inherently variable (that is, their spiking pattern may depend on more than just the stimulus which is presented, although not all of this variability may be true noise, since factors other than the presented stimulus may affect the sensory neuron under study), often the same stimulus protocol is repeated many times to get a feel for the variability a neuron may have.  One common analysis technique is to study the neuron's average time-varying firing rate, called its [[post stimulus time histogram]] or PSTH.&lt;ref name="Budai 1994"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Budai| first1=D. | title=A computer-controlled system for post-stimulus time histogram and wind-up studies.| journal=J Neurosci Methods| volume=51| issue=2 | pages=205-11|date=Mar 1994 | PMID=8051951 | doi=10.1016/0165-0270(94)90012-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Receptive field estimation==
One major goal of sensory neuroscience is to try to estimate the neuron's [[receptive field]]; that is, to try to determine which stimuli cause the neuron to fire in what ways.  One common way to find the receptive field is to use [[Regression analysis|linear regression]] to find which stimulus characteristics typically caused neurons to become excited or depressed.  Since the receptive field of a sensory neuron can vary in time (i.e. latency between the stimulus and the effect it has on the neuron) and in some spatial dimension (literally space for vision and somatosensory cells, but other "spatial" dimensions such as the frequency of a sound for auditory neurons), the term [[spatio temporal receptive field]] or STRF is often used to describe these receptive fields.&lt;ref name="Theunissen 2001"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Theunissen| first1=FE.| last2=David| first2=SV.| last3=Singh| first3=NC. | last4=Hsu| first4=A.| last5=Vinje| first5=WE.| last6=Gallant| first6=JL.| title=Estimating spatio-temporal receptive fields of auditory and visual neurons from their responses to natural stimuli.| journal=Network| volume=12| issue=3| pages=289-316|date=Aug 2001| url=http://cocosci.dreamhosters.com/annehsu/papers/strfs.PDF | PMID=11563531 | doi=10.1080/net.12.3.289.316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Natural stimuli===
One recent trend in sensory neuroscience has been the adoption of natural stimuli for the characterization of sensory neurons.  There is good reason to believe that there has been [[evolution|evolutionary pressure]] on sensory systems to be able to represent natural stimuli well, so sensory systems may exhibit the most relevant behaviour in response to natural stimuli.  The adoption of natural stimuli in sensory neuroscience has been slowed by the fact that the mathematical descriptions of natural stimuli tend to be more complex than of simplified artificial stimuli such as simple tones or clicks in audition or line patterns in vision.  Free software is now available to help neuroscientists interested in estimating receptive fields cope with the difficulty of using natural stimuli.

Sensory neuroscience is also used as a bottom-up approach to studying consciousness.  For example, visual sense and representation has been studied by Crick and Koch (1998),&lt;ref name="Crick 1998"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1=Crick| first1=F.|author-link=Francis Crick| last2=Koch| first2=C.| title=Consciousness and neuroscience| journal=Cereb Cortex| volume=8 | issue=2 | pages=97–107 |date=Mar 1998 | doi= 10.1093/cercor/8.2.97| pmid=9542889 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and experiments have been suggested in order to test various hypotheses in this research stream.

'''Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah''' (reigned: 1433–1436) was a ruler of [[Bengal]] and member of the [[Ganesha dynasty]]. He was the son and successor of Sultan [[Jalaluddin Muhammad Shah]]. After his father's death, he ascended the throne at the age of 14.&lt;ref name=bpedia&gt;{{cite book |last=Taher |first=MA |year=2012 |chapter=Shamsuddin Ahmad Shah |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Shamsuddin_Ahmad_Shah |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Ahmad Shah ruled for only 3 years. His reign was marked with chaos and anarchy. According to [[Firishta]], he followed the liberal policy of his father and was known for justice and charity.&lt;ref name=m4/&gt; During his reign there was an invasion by [[Jaunpur Sultanate#Ibrahim Shah|Ibrahim Shah Sharqi]]. Later Ahmad Shah was killed by two powerful nobles, Sadi Khan and Nasir Khan in 1436AD.&lt;ref name=bpedia /&gt; After his assassination, Sadi Khan and Nasir Khan fell out with each other and were overthrown one after another. A descendant of the [[Ilyas Shahi dynasty]], ascended the throne under the title ''[[Nasiruddin Mahmud Shah]]'' in 1437.&lt;ref name=m4&gt;Majumdar, R.C. (ed.) (2006).

[[File:Struthers Tay Whale Dissection by George Washington Wilson.jpg|thumb|350px|The anatomist [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]] (at left, in top hat) with the Tay Whale at John Woods' yard, Dundee, 1884, photographed by [[George Washington Wilson]]]]
The '''Tay Whale''', known locally as '''The Monster''', was a [[humpback whale]] that swam into the [[Firth of Tay]] of eastern Scotland in 1883. It was [[Whaling in Scotland|harpooned]] in a hunt, but escaped, and was found floating dead off [[Stonehaven]] a week later. It was towed into [[Dundee]] by a showman, John Woods, and exhibited on a train tour of Scotland and England.

The [[Regius Professor of Anatomy (Aberdeen)|Regius Professor of Anatomy]] at Aberdeen University, [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]] [[Dissection|dissected]] the whale, much of the time in public with a [[military band]] playing in the background, organised by Woods. The decomposing whale made Woods a great deal of money, and Struthers famous.

The doggerel poet [[William McGonagall]] wrote an [[The Famous Tay Whale|infamously bad poem]] about the events.

==History==
[[File:Tay Whale-Dundee Montrose Stonehaven (Location).svg|thumb|Location map for the Tay Whale, showing Dundee (D, 12 November – 31 December), Montrose (M, 31 December), and Stonehaven (S, 8 January)]]

In December 1883, a [[humpback whale]] appeared in the [[Firth of Tay]] off the shore of [[Dundee]], at that time [[Scotland]]'s major [[whaling ports of Scotland|whaling port]], and attracted much local interest. The whalers normally hunted in the Arctic, but as the whaling boats were in harbour for the winter, some of the whalers decided to hunt this animal in their own waters.&lt;ref name=Whale&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.abdn.ac.uk/zoohons/struthers/tay_whale.hti |author=Williams, M.J. | date=1996 |title=Professor Struthers and the Tay Whale | journal=[[Scottish Medical Journal]] | volume=41 | issue=3 | pages=92–94 | pmid=8807706}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After several failed attempts, they harpooned the humpback on 31 December 1883. It was a strong male, and it towed two rowing boats and two steamboats as far as [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]] and then to the [[Firth of Forth]]. After a struggle that lasted all night, the harpoon lines broke and the whale escaped.&lt;ref name=Whale/&gt;

A week later the whale was found dead, floating out at sea. It was towed to [[Stonehaven]] and dragged onto the beach. [[John Struthers (anatomist)|John Struthers]], the Regius professor of [[Anatomy]] at [[Aberdeen]], quickly visited the carcass, recording it as 40 feet long with flukes measuring 11 feet 4 inches. A local entrepreneur, John Woods, bought the whale and had it transported to his yard in Dundee. On the first Sunday that it was there, 12,000 people paid to see it.&lt;ref name=Whale/&gt;
[[File:Megaptera Longimana 1.jpg|thumb|A contemporary engraving of the Tay Whale on the beach at [[Stonehaven]] in 1884]]

The local newspaper, the ''[[Dundee Courier]]'', published at least 21 stories on the Tay Whale between 12 November 1883 and 11 January 1884. The headlines included:&lt;ref name=DundeeCourier&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/articles/the-tale-of-a-whale | title=The Tale of a Whale | publisher=McGonagall Online | date=2013 | accessdate=7 October 2013 | author=Hunt, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
Finally on 25 January 1884, when the whale was too badly decomposed for further public exhibition, Struthers was allowed to come and dissect the famous specimen. He was well used to working on stinking carcasses: his dissecting room was reputed to stink "like the deck of a Greenland whaler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pennington |isbn=185752215X |first1=Carolyn |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL873559M/The_modernisation_of_medical_teaching_at_Aberdeen_in_the_nineteenth_century |title=The modernisation of medical teaching at Aberdeen in the nineteenth century |publisher=[[Aberdeen University Press]] |type=Print |location= Aberdeen |year=1994 |accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had two assistants; but the dissection was disturbed by John Woods, who admitted the public, for a fee, to watch the dissection in progress, while a military band played in the background.&lt;ref name=Whale/&gt;

There were snow showers, but Struthers was able to remove much of the skeleton before Woods had the flesh embalmed; the carcass was then stuffed and sewn up to be taken on a profitable tour as far as Edinburgh and London. Finally on 7 August 1884 Struthers was able to remove the skull and the rest of the skeleton. Struthers eventually wrote seven [[anatomy]] articles over the next decade on the whale, and ultimately published a complete monograph on it in 1889, entitled ''[https://archive.org/details/memoironanatomyo00stru Memoir on the Anatomy of the Humpback Whale, Megaptera Longimana]''.&lt;ref name=Whale/&gt;

In 2011, the whale's skeleton was displayed in the [[McManus Galleries]] in Dundee.&lt;ref name=BBCTayside&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-13645166 | title=Giant Tay whale created in Dundee | publisher=[[BBC]] | date=3 June 2011 | accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fame for anatomist==
{{main article|John Struthers (anatomist)}}
Struthers became popularly famous for his dissection of the Tay Whale, his largest specimen. It was one of a wide range of specimens of many species that he energetically collected to form a museum of zoology, to illustrate [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s theories.&lt;ref name=Whale/&gt;

==Fame in doggerel==
The whale became so famous that the [[doggerel]] poet [[William Topaz McGonagall]] (1825–1902) wrote a notably bad poem,{{efn-ua|Paul Corfield Godfrey called it "[T]he worst poet in the English language..."&lt;ref name=
"Godfrey"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.musicweb-international.com/classrev/2013/Sept13/Zuidam_McGonagall_CC72608.htm |last1=Godfrey |first1=Paul Corfield | title=Review: Robert Zuidam, McGonagall-Lieder | accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{efn-ua|[[Hugh MacDiarmid]] wrote: "What this [the verses about John Wood and the Tay Whale] amounts to, of course, is simply what quite uneducated and stupid people—the two adjectives by no means necessarily go together, for many uneducated people have great vitality and a raciness of utterance altogether lacking here—would produce if asked to recount something they had read in a newspaper. ... In their retailings of, or comments upon, such matters, the ''hoi polloi'' would also reflect their personal feelings, as is done here, by the tritest of emotional exclamations." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/scottisheccentri00macd#page/62/mode/2up |title=Scottish Eccentrics |last1=MacDiarmid |first1=Hugh |publisher=G. Routledge, R. &amp; R. Clark |location=Edinburgh |year=1936 |page=63 |accessdate=10 December 2014}} at [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;}} "[[The Famous Tay Whale]]", about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=McGonagall | first=William | title=The Famous Tay Whale | url=http://www.mcgonagall-online.org.uk/gems/the-famous-tay-whale | work=McGonagall Online | date=1884 |accessdate=10 December 2014}} at [[Internet Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt;  Two of the verses run:

{{quote|And my opinion is that God sent the whale in time of need,&lt;br/&gt;No matter what other people may think or what is their creed;&lt;br/&gt;I know fishermen in general are often very poor&lt;br/&gt;And God in His goodness sent it to drive poverty from their door.&lt;br/&gt;&amp;nbsp;

So Mr. John Wood has bought it for two hundred and twenty-six pound,&lt;br/&gt;And has brought it to Dundee all safe and all sound;&lt;br/&gt;Which measures forty feet in length from the snout to the tail,&lt;br/&gt;So I advise the people far and near to see it without fail.&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Famous Tay Whale]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This was not the only piece of doggerel verse about the whale, as a poet signing himself "Spectator" published "The Whale Interviewed by his Mother on his Exploits in the River Tay" in the ''[[Dundee Courier]]'', with verses such as:

{{quote|Oh! why went you there, my son, my son,&lt;br/&gt;Within the range of their banging gun?&lt;br/&gt;"Fear not, mother, ’twas only a lark,&lt;br/&gt;I reckoned they would shoot wide of the mark."&lt;ref name=DundeeCourier /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The Whale Interviewed by his Mother on his Exploits in the River Tay | publisher=Dundee Courier | date=27 December 1883 |  author="Spectator"}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4055">'''Thomas Aldham'''  or '''Aldam''' (c. 1616–1660) was an English farmer who was prominent in spreading [[Quakers|Quakerism]] in the [[Doncaster]] district. He worked hard to combat wrongful imprisonment of fellow Quakers.

==Founder==
Nothing is known of Aldham's parentage. He farmed successfully at [[Warmsworth]], near [[Doncaster]]. In 1644, he married Mary Killam (d. 1660), whom her son Thomas described as "a Woman that truly feared God, and served him in her Day and Generation."&lt;ref&gt;ODNB entry: [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/299 Retrieved 30 September 2011. Subscription required.]&lt;/ref&gt; Aldham's son William was instrumental in opening the first permanent Quaker meeting house in the area, a building that survives as a private house in Quaker Lane.

Aldham was an early disciple of [[George Fox]], with whom he was instrumental in establishing the [[Balby]] meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Doncaster Friends site: [http://homepages.tesco.net/~d.swift/Doncaster.htm Retrieved 30 September 2011.] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111210205852/http://homepages.tesco.net/~d.swift/Doncaster.htm |date=10 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fox, who had suffered violent assaults in [[Tickhill]] and Doncaster, preached for several hours under a walnut tree in Balby in 1652 to a large crowd. (A chair in the present Doncaster Meeting House is made from wood from this tree, and a table made from it was sent to America in 1967.)&lt;ref&gt;History of Doncaster Quakers: [https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:S0jv5zdm8OUJ:www.doncasterquakers.org.uk/m/dnqu/100224_HISTORY_OF_QUAKERS_IN_DONCASTER.doc+Thomas+Aldham&amp;hl= Retrieved 30 September 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Imprisoned==
Aldham was imprisoned in [[York]] in 1652 for speaking in a "steeple-house" (church), and fined 40 shillings for refusing to pay taxes,&lt;ref&gt;John Gough: ''The History of the People Called Quakers'', p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; keeping on his hat, and saying "thou" to the judge, in keeping with the Quaker refusal to recognize ranks among men. He was imprisoned but released after two-and-a-half years, upon application, it is said, to [[Oliver Cromwell]]. He then travelled to various prisons where Quakers were confined and tried to obtain their release. He was also physically attacked by non-Quakers in 1654, 1655, and 1658. He prophesied the downfall of the [[The Protectorate|Protector]] for disregarding his petitions, but said of [[Charles II of England]], "I find nothing to this Man." Aldham is counted among the [[Valiant Sixty]] who were active in the early days of the [[Religious Society of Friends]]. He died in Warmsworth in April 1660.&lt;ref&gt;"Aldham, Thomas". In: ''Dictionary of National Biography'' (London: Smith, Elder &amp; Co, 1885–1900).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
During Aldham's lifetime the Friends grew from a small group of northern separatists into a national movement. Most of his writings date from the period of his imprisonment. They show an interest in wider Quaker affairs: he set about establishing contacts between northern Quakers and printers in London, and promoting the first general Quaker fund for missionary work.

According to Catie Gill, author of his ODNB entry, "His political and religious ideas were sometimes quite theatrically expressed. A parliamentarian sympathizer, he nevertheless once tore his hat into shreds when he was granted an audience with Oliver Cromwell, indicating, it seems, the certain belief that the protector would soon be torn from power." He did much to document and protest against the wrongful imprisonment of Quakers. Several of his letters appeared as or in tracts in the early 1650s, and in volume form in 1690.&lt;ref&gt;ODNB entry; British Library Integrated Catalogue.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Tollund Man''' is a naturally [[Mummy|mummified corpse]] of a man who lived during the 4th century BC, during the period characterised in [[Scandinavia]] as the [[Archaeology of Northern Europe|Pre-Roman Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="pbs1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/bog/tollund.html|title=Tollund Man|accessdate=22 September 2007|publisher=Public Broadcasting System&amp;nbsp;— NOVA|year=2006|author=Susan K. Lewis — PBS}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found in 1950, preserved as a [[bog body]], on the [[Jutland]] peninsula.&lt;ref name="bog"&gt;{{cite book | last = Glob | first = P. | title = The Bog People: Iron-Age Man Preserved | publisher = New York Review of Books | location = New York | year = 2004 | pages = 304 | isbn = 1-59017-090-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The man's physical features were so well-preserved that he was mistaken at the time of discovery for a recent murder victim.&lt;ref name="lib"/&gt; Twelve years before Tollund Man's discovery, another bog body, [[Elling Woman]], had been found in the same bog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/bog/violence1.html "Violence in the Bogs"], Archaeological Institute of America&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
[[File:Tollundmanden DO-10895 original.jpg|thumb|The remains of Tollund Man shortly after his discovery]]
On 6 May 1950, [[peat]] cutters in the [[Bjældskovdal]] peat bog, {{convert|12|km|mi|1}} west of [[Silkeborg]], [[Denmark]]&lt;ref name="lib"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tollundman.dk/et-lig-dukker-op.asp|title=A Body Appears|work=The Tollund Man - A Face from Prehistoric Denmark|accessdate=22 September 2007|publisher=Silkeborg Public Library|year=2004|author1=Silkeborg Public Library |author2=Silkeborg Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt; discovered a corpse in the peat layer which appeared so fresh that they at first believed they had discovered a recent murder victim. 

The Tollund Man lay {{convert|50|m}} away from firm ground, buried under {{convert|2|m}} of peat, his body arranged in a fetal position. He wore a pointed skin cap of [[sheepskin]] and [[wool]], fastened under his chin by a [[Rawhide (textile)|hide]] thong, and a smooth hide belt around his waist. Additionally, a [[noose]] made of [[braid|plait]]ed animal hide was drawn tight around his neck and trailed down his back.&lt;ref name="bog" /&gt; Other than these, the body was naked. His hair was cropped so short as to be almost entirely hidden by his cap. There was short stubble (1&amp;nbsp;mm length) on his chin and upper lip, suggesting that he had not shaved on the day of his death.&lt;ref name="hair"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tollundman.dk/haar.asp|title=The Tollund Man: Hair and beard|accessdate=10 October 2009|publisher=Silkeborg Public Library|year=2004|author1=Silkeborg Public Library |author2=Silkeborg Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars believe the man was a human sacrifice rather than executed criminal because of the arranged position of his body, and the fact that his eyes and mouth were closed.&lt;ref name= kings&gt;Hart, Edward, dir. "Ghosts of Murdered Kings". NOVA. Prod. Edward Hart and Dan McCabe, PBS, 29 January 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scientific examination and conclusions==
[[File:Tollundmannen.jpg|thumb|right]]
[[Carbon-14|C&lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;]] [[radiocarbon dating]] of Tollund Man indicated that he died in approximately 375–210 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=J. van der Plicht, W. A. B. van der Sanen, A. T. Aerts, &amp; H. J. Streurman |year=2004 |title=Dating bog bodies by means of &lt;sup&gt;14&lt;/sup&gt;C-AMS |journal=[[Journal of Archaeological Science]] |volume=31 |issue=4 |pages=471–491 |doi=10.1016/j.jas.2003.09.012 |url=http://cio.eldoc.ub.rug.nl/FILES/root/2004/JArchaeolScrugivdPlicht/2004JArchaeolScivdPlicht.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] }}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The preserved tender soft tissues of his body are the consequence of the [[acid]] in the peat, along with the lack of oxygen underneath the surface and the cold [[climate of the Nordic countries]].  The acid in the peat, needed for the preservation of a human body, is caused by a [[bryophyte]] named [[Sphagnum]].  Sphagnum fights against degradation due to resistant [[Phenols|phenolic compounds]] contained in their cell walls.&lt;ref&gt;Reece, Urry, Cain, Wasserman, Minorsky, Jacckson. "L’importance écologique et économique des Bryophytes". ''Campbell Biologie 4th Edition'' (2012): p.705, 17 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the acidity of peat, bones are typically dissolved rather than preserved.

Examinations and X-rays showed that the man's head was undamaged, and his heart, lungs and liver were well preserved. The [[Silkeborg Museum]] estimated his age as approximately 40 years and height at {{convert|1.61|m}}, a relatively short stature even for the time. It is likely that the body had shrunk in the bog.

On the initial autopsy report in 1950, doctors concluded that Tollund Man died by [[hanging]] rather than [[strangulation]].&lt;ref&gt;Silkeborg Museum, [http://www.tollundman.dk/udseende.asp ''The Tollund Man's Appearance''], Silkeborg Museum and Amtscentret for Undervisning, Silkeborg Public Library, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The rope left visible furrows in the skin beneath his chin and at the sides of his neck. There was no mark, however, at the back of the neck where the knot of the noose would have been located. After a re-examination in 2002, forensic scientists found further evidence to support these initial findings.&lt;ref&gt;Silkeborg Museum, [http://www.tollundman.dk/scanning.asp ''Latest Research''], Silkeborg Museum and Amtscentret for Undervisning, Silkeborg Public Library, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[cervical vertebrae]] were undamaged (these vertebrae are often damaged as a result of hanging), radiography showed that the tongue was distended—an indication of death by hanging.&lt;ref&gt;Silkeborg Museum, [http://www.tollundman.dk/haengning.asp ''Was the Tollund Man Hanged?''], Silkeborg Museum  and Amtscentret for Undervisning, Silkeborg Public Library (SPL), 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The stomach and intestines were examined and tests carried out on their contents.&lt;ref name="Meal" /&gt; Scientists identified the man's [[last meal]] as [[porridge]] or [[gruel]] made from grains and seeds, both cultivated and wild. Approximately 40 kinds of seeds were identified, but the porridge was primarily composed of four types: barley, [[flax]], false flax (''[[Camelina sativa]]'') and [[Polygonum aviculare|knotgrass]].&lt;ref name="Meal"&gt;Silkeborg Museum, [http://www.tollundman.dk/sidste-maaltid.asp ''The Last Meal''], Silkeborg Museum and Amtscentret for Undervisning, Silkeborg Public Library, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; From the stage of digestion it was concluded that the man had eaten 12 to 24 hours prior to his death. Porridges were common for people of this time.&lt;ref name="Meal" /&gt; Because neither meat nor fresh fruit was found in the last meal, it is suggested that the meal was eaten in winter or early spring when these items were not available.&lt;ref name="Meal" /&gt;

Both feet and the right thumb, being well conserved by the peat, were also preserved in [[formalin]] for later examination. In 1976, the Danish police made a [[fingerprint]] analysis, making Tollund Man's thumbprint one of the oldest prints on record.&lt;ref name="Prints"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tollundman.dk/fingeraftryk.asp|title=Finger-Prints|work=The Tollund Man - A Face from Prehistoric Denmark|accessdate=22 September 2007|publisher=Silkeborg Public Library|year=2004|author1=Silkeborg Public Library |author2=Silkeborg Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Display==
[[File:Tollundmanden i Silkeborgmuseet.JPG|thumb|Tollund Man on display at [[Silkeborg Museum]]]]
The body is displayed at the [[Silkeborg Museum]] in Denmark, although only the head is original. Because conservation techniques for organic material were insufficiently advanced in the early 1950s for the entire body to be preserved, the forensic examiners suggested the head be severed and the rest of the body remain unpreserved. Subsequently, the body desiccated and the tissue disappeared. In 1987, the Silkeborg Museum reconstructed the body using the skeletal remains as a base. As displayed today, the original head is attached to a [[replica]] of the body.&lt;ref name="Preservation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tollundman.dk/konservering.asp|title=Preservation of the Tollund Man|work=The Tollund Man - A Face from Prehistoric Denmark|accessdate=22 September 2007|publisher=Silkeborg Public Library|year=2004|author1=Silkeborg Public Library |author2=Silkeborg Museum }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other bodies ==

Approximately 30 of these bog bodies are housed and/or displayed in Danish museums for continued research.&lt;ref name="NGEO"/&gt;

== In popular culture ==
[[Nobel Prize]]-winning Irish poet [[Seamus Heaney]] wrote a series of poems inspired by P.V. Glob's study of the mummified Iron Age bodies found in [[Jutland]]'s peat bogs, finding contemporary political relevance in the relics of the ritualistic killings.&lt;ref name="Heaney"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Donoghue|first=Bernard|title=The Cambridge Companion to Seamus Heaney|date=January 1, 2009|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-83882-5|pages=194–196}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heaney's poem ''The Tollund Man'', published in his ''[[Wintering Out]]'' collection, compares the ritual sacrifice to those who died in the sectarian violence of "[[the Troubles]]."&lt;ref name="Heaney"/&gt; Heaney wrote an excerpt from the poem in the Tollund Man exhibit's guest book in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tollundman.dk/heaney.asp|title=The Nobel Prize Winner's Poem about the Tollund Man|year=2004|work=The Tollund Man|publisher=Silkeborg Public Library|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British author [[Margaret Drabble]], in her 1989 novel, ''[[A Natural Curiosity]]'', uses her characters' obsession with the Tollund Man to provide a satirical criticism of [[Margaret Thatcher]]'s modern England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/06/02/books/a-new-literary-hero-the-limp-silent-type.html?pagewanted=all|title=A New Literary Hero: The Limp, Silent Type|last=Boxer|first=Sarah|date=June 2, 1991|work=New York Times|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sanders|first=Karin|title=Bodies in the Bog and the Archaeological Imagination|date=December 1, 2009|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0226734040|pages=254–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tollund Man is featured in separate songs: "[[Sweden (album)|Tollund Man]]" (1995) by the American folk band [[The Mountain Goats]] and "[[Love Is Only a Feeling|Curse of the Tollund Man]]" (2004) by the English rock band [[The Darkness (band)|The Darkness]].

Tollund Man was mentioned in the episode "Mummy in the Maze" of the American television series ''[[Bones (TV series)|Bones]]''&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Scott. "Mummy in the Maze." ''Bones''. Dir. Marita Grabiak. Fox. 30 Oct. 2007. Web. 15 Nov. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and was also mentioned in the 2016 movie ''[[Sacrifice (2016 film)|Sacrifice]]'' in which a bog body was found in the Shetland Islands.

[[File:Motorofficer.jpg|thumb|A motor officer writes a traffic ticket for a motorist accused of [[speeding]].]]

A '''traffic ticket''' is a notice issued by a [[law enforcement]] official to a [[motorist]] or other road user, indicating that the user has violated [[Traffic|traffic laws]]. Traffic tickets generally come in two forms, citing a [[moving violation]], such as exceeding the [[speed limit]], or a non-moving violation, such as a [[parking violation]], with the ticket also being referred to as a '''parking citation''', '''notice of illegal parking''' or '''parking ticket'''.

In some jurisdictions, a traffic ticket constitutes a notice that a penalty, such as a [[fine (penalty)|fine]] or deduction of [[point system (driving)|points]], has been or will be assessed against the driver or owner of a vehicle; failure to pay generally leads to [[prosecution]] or to civil recovery proceedings for the fine. In others, the ticket constitutes only a citation and [[summons]] to appear at [[traffic court]], with a determination of guilt to be made only in court.

==Australia==
In [[Australia]], traffic laws are made at the state level, usually in their own consolidated Acts of Parliament which have been based upon the [[Australian Road Rules]].

===New South Wales===
Traffic tickets are known as Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) in NSW. The [[Roads and Maritime Services]] (formerly [[Roads and Traffic Authority]]) of NSW maintains a database of all registered holders of a driver's licence in NSW, including the driver's traffic history and registered motor vehicles.
* Owner issued infringements
The [[Roads and Maritime Services]] maintain a number of fixed, and mobile, [[speed cameras]] and [[red light camera]]s across the State. The State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) manages the processing and issuing of traffic tickets detected and issued by these devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fixed speed cameras|url=http://www.rms.nsw.gov.au/business-industry/heavy-vehicles/safety-compliance/speeding-camera-enforcement/fixed-cameras.html|website=Roads and Maritime Services|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tickets are deemed to be 'owner onus' tickets with the vehicles registered owner deemed liable unless they nominate another driver via statutory declaration.
* Driver issued infringements
These are generally issued 'on the spot' by a police officer although there are other authorised officers that can issue traffic infringemnts such as [[Roads and Maritime Services]] heavy vehicle inspectors and Traffic Commanders. The infringement notice is written on three carbonised pieces of printed paper, known as Part A, B and C. Part A is the original and is sent to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO) by the issuing officer when they return to the station, Part B stays in the infringement book for accountability and Part C is given to the accused person at the scene or via post. Infringement notices issued by Council's or Commercial Clients by way of electronic handheld devices still have as associated application for details provided on a copy of the Part A, to be made available for perusal if required.

In NSW all Traffic infringement notices (TIN's) and Parking Infringement Notices (PIN's) are part of the Self-Enforcing Infringement Notice Scheme (SEINS). This scheme aims to minimize Court time for people who wish to plead guilty. The accused person can either elect to pay/part pay the infringement by way of a number of online means or through [[Australia Post]], this can be found on the ticket. If the Accused person pays the infringement, they are deemed to have plead guilty and any demerit points will be deducted from their driver's licence. Matters only go to Court if the accused person elects to have the matter heard at Court.

If the accused person wishes to plead not guilty, they fill the reverse side of Part C out and mail it to the State Debt Recovery Office (SDRO). Once this is done, a Court date is set for hearing before a Magistrate and the officer is notified. The officer creates a brief of evidence and provides this to the Court and the accused person, this contains a copy of Part A, which includes the facts of the matter i.e. observations and contemporaneous notes, including description of vehicle, and whether or not any photographs of an offending vehicle have been taken. Quite often, an officer will indicate that they have taken only (1) photograph of a vehicle then, when a matter is defended in court and the prosecution provide a brief of evidence with anything up to 4-5 extra photographs this can lead to some of the photographs being excluded as evidence because there is no indication to show on the Part A that they were taken at the time of the offence.

Upon being issued a traffic infringement, or parking infringement notice, (in person or to a vehicle) an accused person will generally receive a penalty reminder notice in the mail approximately 28 days later, if the fine remains unpaid.

Under the Fines Act of 1996 (NSW) Time for service of penalty reminder notices by post, is (7) days unless it is established that it was not served within (7) days. A due date for payment of Penalty Reminder notices under this Act is (21) days after it is served. Generally from the date of an offence approximately (28) days is given, after which time of the due date they will then have approximately an additional 21 days in which to take action, and finalise the matter. This includes (7) to allow for service, and (14) days for action to be taken.

If the fine is not actioned by the due date on the penalty reminder notice, an enforcement order will be issued and additional costs apply. If the enforcement order remains unpaid further enforcement action can follow, which may include suspension of the persons driver licence and/or vehicle registration, restrictions on conducting business with Roads and Maritime Services (RMS), garnisheeing of wages, property seizure order or a community service order and additional fees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Enforcement Action|url=http://www.revenue.nsw.gov.au/fines/ea|website=Revenue NSW|publisher=New South Wales Government|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
{{more citations needed|date=April 2018}}

===Outline of traffic offences===
&lt;!--section currently has Ontario-centric POV--&gt;
[[File:$10000 fine.jpg|thumb|A speeding warning sign on Highway QEW in Ontario warning of a $10,000 fine, a roadside suspension, and a roadside vehicle seizure if the speed exceeded 50 km/h over the speed limit.]]
In [[Canada]], most traffic laws are made at the provincial level. However, some serious violations are criminal offences, contrary to the federal [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]]. Both levels of government may deal with different aspects of the same misconduct. For example, [[Drunk driving (Canada)|drinking and driving]] may be a criminal offence of driving while impaired, or driving with a blood alcohol level greater than .08.  At the same time, most provinces have laws specifying administrative penalties for driving with a blood alcohol level which does not exceed the criminal blood alcohol level of .08, in particular for newly licensed drivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Alberta's approach to impaired driving|url=http://www.transportation.alberta.ca/impaireddriving.htm|website=Alberta Transportation|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each province maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations. Upon being ticketed, a motorist has a chance to plead guilty or not guilty with an explanation. The motorist or their representative must attend the court for the town or city in which the violation took place to do so.

If the motorist pleads not guilty, a trial date is set and both the motorist, or a lawyer/paralegal representing the motorist, and the ticketing officer, are required to attend. If the officer fails to attend, the court judge will often find in favour of the motorist and dismiss the charge, although sometimes the trial date is moved to give the officer another chance to attend. In some provinces, officers are now paid time and a half to attend traffic proceedings. The court will also make provisions for the officer or the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a [[plea bargain]].  If no agreement is reached, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge or Justice of Peace, who then decides the matter.

If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to conviction after trial. Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally given demerit points, under each province's [[point system (driving)|point system]]. Jail time is sometimes sought in more serious cases such as racing or stunt driving.

=== The Demerit Point System in Ontario ===
{{anchor|Demerit Point System for Driving Offences in Ontario}}

In the province of Ontario, drivers who are convicted of certain driving related offences result in demerit points recorded onto their driving records. It is commonly misconceived that drivers actually "lose" points due to convictions for certain traffic offences. In fact, a driver begins with zero demerit points and accumulates demerit points for convictions. Demerit points stay on a driver's record for two years from the original offence date. If a driver accumulates enough points, a suspension/loss of licence can occur.

For a fully licensed driver in Ontario, the accumulation of six demerit points results in a “warning” letter.  At nine points, the driver is scheduled a mandatory interview to discuss their record and give specific reasonings as to why the licence should not be suspended.  If a driver fails to attend this meeting, their licence may be automatically suspended.  At 15 or more points, a driver’s licence will be suspended for 30 days.  Surrendering a licence to the Ministry of Transportation is mandatory at this stage; failure to surrender the licence may result in a suspension/loss for up to two years.

==India==
Traffic violations in India are listed out in the Motor Vehicle Act of 1988. The state government has the rights to decide on the officials who are to do traffic rule enforcement and how traffic citations are issued. Generally the Regional Transport Authority (RTA) and Traffic Police (which is part of the general law and order police force) are allowed to book traffic violations. Officers of and above the rank of Asst. Motor Vehicle Inspector (A.MVI) and [[Sub-Inspector]] in charge of the Traffic Police wing have the right to levy on-the-spot fines from the violators. This is known as ''compounding'' an offence. Fines would be paid on the spot and a ''[[Challan]]'' (receipt) would be given to the driver. Off late officers on Highway Police duty are also authorised to levy spot fines...

Other officers issue a ''Vehicle Check report'' which lists out the violations noticed on the driver or on the vehicle. The notice would contain the relevant sections in which the driver is charged and also a date to appear in court. The accused can plead guilty by sending a Postal Money order (MO) to the court indicating that he is pleading guilty. Otherwise he/she can appear in person in the court and contest the case. The police officers who prepared the check report and charge sheet would be in the court. The court which handles these cases are the Judicial First Class Magistrate Courts and the trial is a ''summary trial'' (which means if a person is found guilty, he/she cannot appeal to higher courts).

For drivers who drive under the influence of liquor or other narcotic substance, on-the-spot fine cannot be levied. The driver would be taken to a hospital and a medical report made out. The accused should appear in court. A driver can also insist that he/she would not be paying the fine at the spot and the case have to be heard in the magistrate's court. In such a case the Police officer should issue a notice for appearance in the court.

In the city of [[Kolkata]], certain traffic violations such as breaking a red light results in traffic police sending a ticket to the driver's home address. The ticket has to be paid to a state or central bank.

Indian Police forces do not have mobile credit card readers, so the fine is generally paid in cash.

==Ireland==
In the [[Republic of Ireland]], a traffic ticket (which is mailed out to the driver) is in the form of a notice alleging that some crime — traffic offences are all [[criminal offence]]s — has been committed, but stating that if a payment of a certain amount is made to the [[Garda Síochána]] within 28&amp;nbsp;days, or the amount increased by 50% is paid within 56&amp;nbsp;days, the driver will not be [[prosecution|prosecuted]] for the alleged offence. Some tickets carry [[point system (driving)|penalty points]] as well as the fine.

==Scandinavia==
Most of [[Scandinavia]] determines some traffic fines based on income. For example, Finland’s system for calculating fines starts with an estimate of the amount of spending money a Finn has for one day, and then divides that by two. The resulting number is considered a "reasonable" amount of spending money to deprive the offender of. Then, based on the severity of the crime, the system has rules for how many days the offender must go without that money. For example, driving about 15&amp;nbsp;mph over the speed limit results in a multiplier of 12 days. Most reckless drivers pay between $30 and $50 per day, for a total of about $400 or $500.  In 2002, a [[Nokia]] executive was fined the equivalent of $103,000 for driving at 75&amp;nbsp;km/h (47&amp;nbsp;mph) in a 50&amp;nbsp;km/h (31&amp;nbsp;mph) zone on his motorcycle.&lt;ref&gt;Pinsker, Joe (March 2015).

==United States==

[[File:Parking ticket - Washington DC - 2011-08-25.jpg|thumb|A parking ticket issued in Washington, D.C. in 2011.]]
[[File:Seattle parking checker, 1960.gif|thumb|right|Checker giving a parking ticket, Seattle Washington, 1960.]]

In the [[United States]], most traffic laws are codified in a variety of state, county and municipal laws or ordinances, with most minor violations classified as [[infraction]]s, [[Civil penalty|civil charges]] or [[criminal charges]]. The classification of the charge depends on the violation itself as well as the jurisdiction, with infractions, civil charges and criminal charges relating to different standards of proof, trial rules and punishments.

===Traffic violations===
What constitutes a "minor violation" or infraction varies, examples include non-moving violations, defective or improper vehicle equipment, seat belt and child-restraint safety violations, and insufficient proof of license, insurance or registration. A trend in the late 1970s and early 1980s also saw an increased tendency for jurisdictions to re-classify certain speeding violations as civil infractions.&lt;ref name="Ruschmann000"&gt;{{cite book| title     = An Analysis of the Potential Legal Constraints on the Use of Speed Measuring Devices.|first= P.A.| last = Ruschmann| publisher = University of Michigan, Highway Safety Research Institute| year= 1979| id = Original from the University of Michigan Digitized November 23, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, for more "serious" violations, traffic violators may be held criminally liable, accused of a [[misdemeanor]] or even a [[felony]]. Serious violations tend to involve multiple prior offenses, willful disregard of public safety, death or serious bodily injury, or damage to property.&lt;ref name="Ruschmann000" /&gt; A frequently used penalty is a [[fine (penalty)|fine]], and this is ordinarily a fixed amount of money, instead of being an amount of money determined based on the facts of each individual case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|ssrn=1967184|last=Bray |first=Samuel L.|year=2012 |title=Announcing Remedies |journal=Cornell Law Review |volume=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contesting a ticket===
If the motorist wishes to contest a traffic infraction, a hearing can be set by the court upon proper request.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Traffic &amp; Ticket Basics|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/8452.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hearings are before a magistrate or judge depending on the state or city. Hearing dates may potentially be adjourned, and witnesses or police officers may be subpoenaed to appear in court.

At any point after the issuance of a ticket, a motorists may retain an attorney to represent them in a traffic infraction.&lt;ref name="exfight"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Should You Fight Your Traffic Ticket?|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/traffic_tickets/fighting_tickets.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|publisher=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retaining or consulting an attorney may be beneficial to the motorist because an attorney would better understand how to contest an infraction in any given state or municipality. Attorneys may offer full representation in court, taking a case from inception to disposal and potentially appeals, although it may be possible for a defendant to retain a lawyer to discuss legal options, identify important defenses, and determine a defense strategy without hiring the lawyer to provide in-court representation.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=Limited-Scope Representation|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/1085.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The motorist may be given the opportunity to schedule a hearing for a time at which the subpoenaed ticketing officer is unable to attend. If the officer or representative fails to attend the trial for a civil infraction, the trial court may adjourn the hearing to a date upon which the officer is able to appear or, particularly if good cause is not shown for the officer's absence, the court judge may dismiss the charge.&lt;ref name="exfight"/&gt;

Although each judge, state, county or municipality handle contested hearings a little differently, the court may make provisions for the prosecutor to achieve a deal with the motorist, often in the form of a [[plea bargain]] that may reduce the impact from that which would be incurred from pleading guilty without attending court.&lt;ref name="exfight"/&gt; If no agreement is reached, and the prosecutor feels it is worth his time to charge the motorist, both motorist and officer, or their respective representatives, formally attempt to prove their case before the judge, who then decides the matter.

In some states and for criminal traffic violations, the judge may also order a [[jury trial]], in which case a [[jury]] will hear arguments from both sides, and then consider the facts in the case and render a [[verdict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What To Expect in Traffic Court|url=https://www.ohiobar.org/forpublic/resources/lawyoucanuse/pages/lawyoucanuse-245.aspx|website=Ohio State Bar Association|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motorist may, for example, put forward a reason their alleged violation was justified, such as to "get out of the way of an ambulance or avoid a collision with another motorist", and call into doubt the level to which the officer recalls the specific details of the situation among the many tickets they have issued.

In Washington state, there is a local option for courts to permit a decision on written statements, without the officer's live appearance in court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.courts.wa.gov/court_rules/?fa=court_rules.display&amp;group=clj&amp;set=IRLJ&amp;ruleid=cljirlj3.5|title=Washington State Courts  - Court Rules|author=|date=|website=www.courts.wa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; California offers a procedure in which both the officer and the ticketed driver may appear in writing, through a Trial by Written Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trial by Written Declaration|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/34713.htm|website=California Courts|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some states permit challenging a traffic infraction through a written statement instead of appearing in court.  For example, California's Vehicle Code Section 40902 permits individuals to obtain a trial by written declaration instead of making an in-court appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Vehicle Code, Sec. 40902, Evidence|url=https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov/faces/codes_displaySection.xhtml?lawCode=VEH&amp;sectionNum=40902.|website=California Legislative Information|publisher=State of California|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Driving records===
Each state's [[Department of Motor Vehicles]] or Bureau of Motor Vehicles maintains a database of motorists, including their convicted traffic violations.  Upon being ticketed, a motorist is given the option to mail into the local court or the court for the jurisdiction in which the violation is alleged—a plea of guilty, not guilty or [[nolo contendere]] within a certain time frame (usually ten to fifteen days, although courts generally provide leniency in this regard). Additionally, the motorist can request a mitigation hearing, which acknowledges that the driver is guilty of a moving violation, but is requesting a hearing with a judge to reduce the fines associated with the ticket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Infractions (Tickets)|url=http://www.cob.org/government/court/infractions.aspx#mitigating|publisher=[[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham Municipal Court]]|accessdate=15 March 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116102429/http://www.cob.org/government/court/infractions.aspx#mitigating|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

If the motorist pleads guilty, the outcome is equivalent to a conviction after the hearing.  Upon conviction, the motorist is generally fined a monetary amount and, for moving violations, is additionally assessed a penalty under each state's [[point system (driving)|point system]].  If a motorist is convicted of a violation in a state other than the state in which the motorist is registered, information about the ticket is relayed in accord with state policy and agreements between the two states, including the [[Non-Resident Violator Compact]].  If the ticket information is not abstracted to the state in which the motorist is licensed, then the record of the conviction remains local to the state where the violation took place.

===Ticket fixing===
The practice of [[ticket fixing]] by police officers is a recurring source of controversy in the United States. Police officers in many jurisdictions surreptitiously cancel tickets as a "professional courtesy" to the friends and family of other police officers. This practice is not legal in most jurisdictions, but enforcement is often lax, leading to periodic scandals.&lt;ref&gt;Ticket-fixing probe rocks Georgia. ''Henderdson Times-News''. September 17, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2004-07-27/bay-area/17436305_1_house-arrest-arrest-sentence-william-danser | work=The San Francisco Chronicle | first=Kelly | last=St. John | title=San Jose / Disbarred judge told to swear off alcohol | date=2004-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/28/nyregion/16-officers-ordered-to-surrender-in-ticket-fixing.html | work=The New York Times | first1=William K. | last1=Rashbaum | first2=Al | last2=Baker | title=In Ticket-Fixing Scandal, 16 Officers to Be Charged | date=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ticket superlatives==
There are many competing claims as to '''the first''' speeding ticket ever issued depending whether the claim goes by the first traffic violation or the first ''paper ticket'' ever issued. [[Great Britain]] may have the earliest claim with the first person to be convicted of speeding, Walter Arnold of [[East Peckham]], Kent, who on 28 January 1896 was fined for speeding at {{convert|8|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} in a {{convert|2|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} zone. He was fined 1 shilling plus costs.&lt;ref name="NatMotMuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalmotormuseum.org.uk/motoring_firsts|publisher=National Motoring Museum|title=Motoring firsts}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC R4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00cmb4q|work=BBC Radio 4|title=The Eureka Years|author=Adam Hart Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4rRyTOnpfpUC&amp;pg=PA45&amp;dq=worlds+first+speeding+ticket&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=SKAnTMiAK8P_lgfj7MjjDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=speeding&amp;f=false|author=John Townsend|title=Crime Scenes|pages=45|publisher=Heinemann-Raintree|date=September 2005|isbn=978-1-4109-1171-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A New York City cab driver named Jacob German was arrested for speeding on May 20, 1899 for driving 12 miles per hour on Lexington Avenue in Manhattan. In [[Dayton, Ohio]], police issued a ''paper ticket'' to Harry Myers for going twelve miles per hour on West Third Street in 1904.&lt;ref name="Ohio History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/entry.php?rec=2599 |title=Ohio History Central |accessdate=2008-08-27|work=Ohio History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another '''early''' speeding ticket was issued in 1910 to Lady Laurier, the wife of [[Wilfrid Laurier]], Prime Minister of Canada, in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], Canada, for exceeding the 10 miles per hour speed limit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://data2.collectionscanada.gc.ca/ap/c/c140936.jpg|title=data2.collectionscanada.gc.ca|author=|date=|website=collectionscanada.gc.ca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fastest convicted speeder in the UK was Daniel Nicks, convicted of {{convert|175|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on a [[Honda Fireblade]] motorcycle in 2000.  He received six weeks in jail and was banned from driving for two full years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/topstories/tm_headline=biker-beats-cops-at-170mph&amp;method=full&amp;objectid=19075670&amp;siteid=89520-name_page.html |title=Biker beats cops at 170mph  |publisher=mirror.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fastest UK speeder in a car was Timothy Brady, caught driving a 3.6-litre [[Porsche 911 Turbo]] at {{convert|172|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} on the A420 in Oxfordshire in January 2007 and jailed for 10&amp;nbsp;weeks and banned from driving for 3&amp;nbsp;years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/oxfordshire/7009923.stm | work=BBC News | title=Jail for 172mph Porsche motorist | date=2007-09-24 | accessdate=2010-05-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''most expensive''' speeding ticket ever given is believed to be the one given to Jussi Salonoja in [[Helsinki]], [[Finland]], in 2003. Salonoja, the 27-year-old heir to a company in the meat-industry, was fined 170,000 euros for driving 80&amp;nbsp;km/h in a 40&amp;nbsp;km/h zone. The uncommonly large fine was due to Finnish speeding tickets (when excess speed is considerable) being relative to the offender's last known income. Salonoja's speeding ticket was not the first ticket given in Finland reaching six figures.&lt;ref name=bbcrecordpeedingticket&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/3477285.stm BBC world], Finn's speed fine is a bit rich.&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, homosexual acts are [[LGBT rights by country or territory|legal]] in almost all [[Western countries]], and in many of these countries '''violence against LGBT people''' is classified as a [[hate crime]],&lt;ref name="williams"&gt;Stotzer, R.:  [https://www.law.ucla.edu/williamsinstitute/publications/Comparison%20of%20Hate%20Crime%20Formatted.pdf Comparison of love Crime Rates Across Protected and Unprotected Groups], [[Williams Institute]], 2007–06.

In [[LGBT rights in Europe|Europe]], the [[LGBT rights in the European Union|European Union]]'s [[Employment Equality Framework Directive]] and [[Charter of Fundamental Rights]] offer some protection against sexuality-based discrimination.

Historically, state-sanctioned persecution of homosexuals was mostly limited to [[male homosexuality]], termed "[[sodomy]]". During the medieval and early modern period, the penalty for sodomy was usually death. During the modern period (from the 19th century to the mid-20th century) in the Western world, the penalty was usually a fine or imprisonment.

There was a drop in locations where homosexual acts remained illegal from 2009 when there were 80 countries worldwide (notably throughout the [[LGBT in the Middle East|Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and in most of [[Africa]], but also in some of the [[LGBT rights in the Americas#Caribbean|Caribbean]] and [[LGBT rights in Oceania|Oceania]]) with five carrying the [[Capital punishment|death penalty]]&lt;ref&gt;"[http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/story?id=7883204&amp;page=1 New Benefits for Same-Sex Couples May Be Hard to Implement Abroad]"ABC News.

An early law against sexual intercourse between men is recorded in [[Leviticus]] by the [[Hebrews|Hebrew people]], prescribing the [[death penalty]]. A violent law regarding homosexual intercourse is prescribed in the [[Assyrian Empire#Middle Assyrian period|Middle Assyrian]] [[Assyrian law|Law Codes]] (1075 BCE), stating: "If a man lay with his neighbor, when they have prosecuted him (and) convicted him, they shall lie with him (and) turn him into a [[eunuch]]".

In the account given in [[Tacitus]] ''[[Germania (Tacitus)|Germania]]'', the death penalty was reserved for two kinds of capital offenses: military treason or desertion was punished by [[hanging]], and moral infamy (cowardice and homosexuality:  ''ignavos et imbelles at corpore infames''); Gordon translates ''corpore [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Pleasure and infamy|infames]]'' as "unnatural prostitutes"; Tacitus refers to male homosexuality, see
David F. Greenberg, ''The construction of homosexuality'', p.&amp;nbsp;242 f. Scholarship compares the later Germanic concept of Old Norse ''[[argr]]'', Langobardic ''arga'', which combines the meanings "effeminate, cowardly, homosexual", see [[Jaan Puhvel]], 'Who were the Hittite ''hurkilas pesnes''?' in: A. Etter (eds.), ''O-o-pe-ro-si'' (FS Risch), Walter de Gruyter, 1986, p.&amp;nbsp;154.

====Europe====
[[File:Bor-Nederlantsche-Oorloghen 9161.tif|{{Largethumb}}|left|Execution by fire and torture of five homosexual Franciscan monks, Bruges, 26 July 1578]]
In [[Roman Republic|Republican Rome]], the poorly attested ''[[Lex Scantinia]]'' penalized an adult male for committing a sex crime ''([[stuprum]])'' against an [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Sexuality and children|underage male citizen]] ''([[ingenui|ingenuus]])''. It is unclear whether the penalty was death or a fine. The law may also have been used to prosecute [[Sexuality in ancient Rome#Male sexuality|adult male citizens]] who willingly took a [[Pathicus|pathic role in same-sex acts]], but prosecutions are rarely recorded and the provisions of the law are vague; as [[John Boswell]] has noted, "if there was a law against homosexual relations, no one in [[Cicero]]'s day knew anything about it."&lt;ref&gt;[[John Boswell]], ''Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality: Gay People in Western Europe from the Beginning of the Christian Era to the Fourteenth Century'' (University of Chicago Press, 1980), pp. 63, 67–68, quotation on p. 69. See also Craig Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'' (Oxford University Press, 1999), p. 116; [[Eva Cantarella]], ''Bisexuality in the Ancient World'' (Yale University Press, 1992), p. 106ff.; Thomas A.J. McGinn, ''Prostitution, Sexuality and the Law in Ancient Rome'' (Oxford University Press, 1998), pp. 140–141; Amy Richlin, ''The Garden of Priapus: Sexuality and Aggression in Roman Humor'' (Oxford University Press, 1983, 1992), pp. 86, 224; Jonathan Walters, "Invading the Roman Body," in ''Roman Sexualites'' (Princeton University Press, 1997), pp. 33–35, noting particularly the overly broad definition of the ''Lex Scantinia'' by Adolf Berger, ''Encyclopedic Dictionary of Roman Law'' (American Philosophical Society, 1953, reprinted 1991), pp. 559 and 719. Freeborn Roman men could engage in sex with males of lower status, such as prostitutes and slaves, without moral censure or losing their perceived masculinity, as long as they took the active, penetrating role; see [[Sexuality in ancient Rome]].&lt;/ref&gt; When the [[Roman Empire]] came under [[Constantine the Great and Christianity|Christian rule]], all male homosexual activity was increasingly repressed, often on pain of death.&lt;ref name = THEOD&gt;(Theodosian Code 9.7.6): All persons who have the shameful custom of condemning a man's body, acting the part of a woman's to the sufferance of alien sex (for they appear not to be different from women), shall expiate a crime of this kind in avenging flames in the sight of the people.&lt;/ref&gt; In 342 CE,  the Christian emperors [[Constantius II|Constantius]] and [[Constans]] declared same-sex marriage to be illegal.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodosian Code]] 9.8.3: ''"When a man marries and is about to offer himself to men in womanly fashion (quum vir nubit in feminam viris porrecturam), what does he wish, when sex has lost all its significance; when the crime is one which it is not profitable to know; when Venus is changed to another form; when love is sought and not found? We order the statutes to arise, the laws to be armed with an avenging sword, that those infamous persons who are now, or who hereafter may be, guilty may be subjected to exquisite punishment.''&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after, in the year 390 CE,  emperors [[Valentinian II]], [[Theodosius I]] and [[Arcadius]] declared homosexual sex to be illegal and those who were guilty of it were condemned to be publicly burned alive.&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt;  Emperor [[Justinian I]] (527–565 CE) made homosexuals a [[Scapegoating|scapegoat]] for problems such as "famines, earthquakes, and pestilences."&lt;ref&gt;Justinian ''Novels'' 77, 144; Michael Brinkschröde, "Christian Homophobia: Four Central Discourses," in ''Combatting Homophobia: Experiences and Analyses Pertinent to Education'' (LIT Verlag, 2011), p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laws and codes prohibiting homosexual practice were in force in [[Europe]] from the fourth&lt;ref name = THEOD/&gt; to the twentieth centuries, and Muslim countries have had similar laws from the beginnings of [[Islam]] in the seventh century up to and including the present day. [[Abbasid]] [[Baghdad]], under the [[Caliph]] [[Al-Hadi]] (785–786 CE), punished homosexuality with death.

During the [[Middle Ages]], the [[Kingdom of France]] and the [[Florence|City of Florence]] also instated the death penalty. In Florence, a young boy named [[Giovanni di Giovanni]] (1350–1365?) was castrated and burned between the thighs with a red-hot iron by court order under this law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Forbidden Friendships, Homosexuality and Male Culture in Renaissance Florence|year=1996|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=24, 227, 356, 360|last=Rocke|first=Michael|isbn=0-19-512292-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="litandhomo"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Literature and Homosexuality |first=Michael J |last=Meyer |year=2000 |publisher=Rodopi |page=206|isbn=90-420-0519-X |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; These punishments continued into the [[Renaissance]], and spread to the [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[canton of Zürich]]. Knight Richard von Hohenberg (died 1482) was burned at the stake together with his lover, his young squire, during this time. In France, [[French people|French]] writer [[Jacques Chausson]] (1618–1661) was also burned alive for attempting to seduce the son of a nobleman.

In 17th century [[Malta]], there was harsh prejudice and laws towards those who were found guilty or speak openly of being involved in same-sex activity. English voyager and author [[William Lithgow (traveller and author)|William Lithgow]], writing in March 1616, says a Spanish soldier and a [[Maltese people|Maltese]] teenage boy were publicly burnt to [[ash|ashes]] for confessing to have practiced sodomy together.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Melita Historica|last=Brincat|first=Joseph M.|title=Book reviews|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Melita%20Historica/MH.14(2004-07)/MH.14(2007)4/07.pdf|date=2007|volume=14|page=448}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, and fear to similar faith, about a hundred males involved in same-sex prostitution sailed to [[Sicily]] the following day. This episode, published abroad by a foreign writer, is the most detailed account of LGBT life during the rule of the Order. It represents that homosexuality was still a [[taboo]], but a widespread practice, an [[open secret]], and LGBT-related information was suppressed.&lt;ref name="buttigieg"&gt;{{cite book|last=Buttigieg|first=Emanuel|date=2011|title=Nobility, Faith and Masculinity: The Hospitaller Knights of Malta, c.1580-c.1700|url=https://books.google.com.mt/books?id=DVqd_gb2tmMC&amp;pg=PA156|publisher=A &amp; C Black|isbn=9781441102430|page=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Timeline of LGBT history in Britain|England]], the [[Buggery Act 1533|Buggery Act of 1534]] made sodomy and bestiality punishable by death. This act was replaced in 1828, but sodomy remained punishable by death under the new act until 1861. The [[James Pratt and John Smith|last executions]] were in 1835.

In [[Nazi Germany]], homosexuals were among the groups targeted by [[the Holocaust]] (''See [[Persecution of homosexuals in Nazi Germany and the Holocaust]]''). (In 1936, the homosexual [[Federico García Lorca]] was executed by right-wing rebels who became [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s dictatorship in Spain, Hitler's ally.) [[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] generally oppose homosexuality to the extent of supporting a renewed persecution the way it took place in Nazi Germany. Being homosexual is equated with being unmasculine and the German word ″Schwul″ ('gay') is used by German Neonazis as a curse word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.netz-gegen-nazis.de/artikel/schwule-nazis-ein-brisantes-thema-f%C3%BCr-die-rechtsextreme-szene-8724|title=Schwule Nazis?

Even in countries where homosexuality is legal (most countries outside of Africa and the Middle East), there are reports of homosexual people being targeted with bullying or physical assault or even homicide.

{{further|Homophobic violence in Brazil}}
According to the Grupo Gay da Bahia, Brazil's oldest gay rights NGO, the rate of murders of homosexuals in [[LGBT rights in Brazil|Brazil]] is particularly high, with a reported 3,196 cases over the 30-year period of 1980 to 2009 (or about 0.7 cases per 100,000 population per annum).&lt;ref name="globo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oglobo.globo.com/pais/eleicoes2010/mat/2010/10/16/numero-de-assassinatos-de-gays-no-pais-cresceu-62-desde-2007-mas-tema-fica-fora-da-campanha-922804348.asp |title=Número de assassinatos de gays no país cresceu 62% desde 2007, mas tema fica fora da campanha - Jornal O Globo |publisher=Oglobo.globo.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Brazilian gay group [[Grupo Gay da Bahia]] (GGB) reported 190 documented alleged homophobic murders in Brazil in 2008, accounting for about 0.5% of intentional homicides in Brazil ([[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate]] 22 per 100,000 population as of 2008). 64% of the victims were gay men, 32% were [[trans women]] or transvestites, and 4% were lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 Gay-Bashing Murders Up 55 Percent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101030115100/http://ipsnews.net/news.asp?idnews=46596 |date=2010-10-30 }} (ipsnews.net, 22 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;
By comparison, the FBI reported five homophobic murders in the [[History of violence against LGBT people in the United States|United States]] during 2008, corresponding to 0.03% of intentional homicides (homicide rate 5.4 per 100,000 population as of 2008).

The numbers produced by the Grupo Gay da Bahia (GGB) have occasionally been contested on the grounds that they include all murders of LGBT people reported in the media — that is, not only those motivated by bias against homosexuals. Reinaldo de Azevedo, columnist of the [[right-wing]] [[Veja (magazine)|Veja]] magazine, Brazil's most read weekly publication, called the GGB's methodology "unscientific" based on the above objection: that they make no distinction between murders motivated by bias and those that were not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference | title = UM VERMELHO-E-AZUL PARA DISSECAR UMA NOTÍCIA.

In many parts of the world, including much of the [[European Union]] and [[LGBT rights in the United States|United States]], acts of violence are legally classified as hate crimes, which entail harsher sentences if convicted. In some countries, this form of legislation extends to [[verbal abuse]] as well as physical violence.

Violent hate crimes against LGBT people  tend to be especially brutal, even compared to other hate crimes: "an intense rage is present in nearly all homicide cases involving gay male victims".
It is rare for a victim to just be shot; he is more likely to be stabbed multiple times, mutilated, and strangled. "They frequently involved [[torture]], cutting, mutilation... showing the absolute intent to rub out the human being because of his (sexual) preference".&lt;ref name="ALTS"/&gt;
In a particularly brutal case in the United States, on March 14, 2007, in [[Wahneta, Florida]], 25-year-old [[Ryan Keith Skipper]] was found dead from 20 stab wounds and a slit throat. His body had been dumped on a dark, rural road less than 2 miles from his home. His two alleged attackers, William David Brown, Jr., 20, and Joseph Eli Bearden, 21, were indicted for robbery and first-degree murder. Highlighting their [[malice (legal term)|malice]] and contempt for the victim, the accused killers allegedly drove around in Skipper's blood-soaked car and bragged of killing him. According to a sheriff's department affidavit, one of the men stated that Skipper was targeted because "he was a faggot."&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

In [[LGBT rights in Canada|Canada]] in 2008, police-reported data found that approximately 10% of all hate crimes in the country were motivated by sexual orientation. Of these, 56% were of a violent nature. In comparison, 38% of all racially motivated offenses were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.humanrightsfirst.org/pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|title=Violence Based on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Bias: 2008 Hate Crime Survey|author=Stahnke, Tad|publisher=[[Human Rights First]]|year=2008|display-authors=etal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100827144817/http://www.humanrightsfirst.org//pdf/fd/08/fd-080924-lgbt-web2.pdf|archivedate=2010-08-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same year in the United States, according to [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] data, though 4,704 crimes were committed due to racial bias and 1,617 were committed due to sexual orientation, only one murder and one [[forcible rape]] were committed due to racial bias, whereas five murders and six rapes were committed based on sexual orientation.&lt;ref name="FBI Table 4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.fbi.gov/ucr/hc2008/index.html|title=Hate Crime Statistics: Offense Type by Bias Motivation|year=2008|publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In [[Northern Ireland]] in 2008, 160 [[homophobic]] incidents and 7 [[transphobic]] incidents were reported. Of those incidents, 68.4% were violent crimes; significantly higher than for any other bias category. By contrast, 37.4% of racially motivated crimes were of a violent nature.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

People's ignorance of and prejudice against LGBT people can contribute to the spreading of misinformation about them and subsequently to violence. In 2018, a transgender woman was killed by a mob in Hyderabad, India, following false rumors that transgender women were sex trafficking children. Three other transgender women were injured in the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Suri|first1=Manveena|title=Indian mob kills transgender woman over fake rumors spread on WhatsApp|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/05/28/asia/india-transgender-whatsapp-mob-intl/index.html|accessdate=28 May 2018|publisher=CNN|date=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent research on university-level students indicated the importance of queer visibility and its impact in creating a positive experience for LGBTIQ+ members of a campus community, this can reduce the impact and effect of incidents on youth attending university. When there is a poor climate - students are much less likely to report incidents or seek help.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Waling|first=Andrea|last2=Roffee|first2=James A|date=2018-03-30|title=Supporting LGBTIQ+ students in higher education in Australia: Diversity, inclusion and visibility|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0017896918762233|journal=Health Education Journal|language=en|volume=|pages=0017896918762233|doi=10.1177/0017896918762233|issn=0017-8969|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislation against homophobic hate crimes===
{{Update|section|inaccurate=y|date=May 2013}}
Members of the [[Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe]] began describing hate crimes based on sexual orientation (as opposed to generic [[anti-discrimination]] legislation) to be counted as aggravating circumstance in the commission of a crime in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bello|first1=Barbara Giovanna|editor1-last=Stange|editor1-first=Mary Zeiss|editor2-last=Oyster|editor2-first=Carol K.|editor3-last=Sloan|editor3-first=Jane E.|title=Encyclopedia of Women in Today's World, Volume 1|date=2011|publisher=SAGE|isbn=9781412976855|pages=662-665|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bOkPjFQoBj8C&amp;pg=PA664|accessdate=22 February 2018|chapter=Hate Crimes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[LGBT history in the United States|United States]] does not have federal legislation marking sexual orientation as criteria for hate crimes, but several states, including the District of Columbia, enforce harsher penalties for crimes where real or perceived sexual orientation may have been a motivator. Among these 12 countries as well, only the United States has criminal law that specifically mentions gender identity, and even then only in 11 states and the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; In November 2010, the [[United Nations General Assembly]] voted 79-70 to remove "sexual orientation" from the Special Rapporteur on Extrajudicial, Summary or Arbitrary Executions, a list of unjustified reasons for executions, replacing it with "discriminatory reasons on any basis".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2010/11/18/un-deletes-gay-reference-from-anti-execution-measures/|title=UN deletes gay reference from anti-execution measures|first=Jessica|last=Geen|publisher=Pink News|date=November 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The resolution specifically mentions a large number of groups, including race, religion, linguistic differences, refugees, [[street children]] and [[indigenous peoples]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theusdaily.com/articles/viewarticle.jsp?id=1261706&amp;type=World|title=U.N. panel cuts gay reference from violence measure|publisher=U.S. Daily|date=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Legal and police response to these types of hate crimes is hard to gauge, however. Lack of reporting by authorities on the statistics of these crimes and under-reporting by the victims themselves are factors for this difficulty.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt; Often a victim will not report a crime as it will shed unwelcome light on their orientation and invite more victimization.&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/british-columbia/story/2009/02/05/bc-arron-webster-ryan-cran-released.html|title=Gay community troubled by release of killer in Stanley Park death|date=5 February 2009|publisher=[[CBC News]]|accessdate=13 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alleged judicative bias===

Legal defenses like the [[gay panic defense]] allow for more lenient punishments for people accused of beating, torturing, or killing homosexuals because of their orientation. These arguments posit that the attacker was so enraged by their victim's advances as to cause [[temporary insanity]], leaving them unable to stop themselves or tell right from wrong. In these cases, if the loss of faculties is proven, or sympathized to the jury, an initially severe sentence may be significantly reduced. In several [[common law countries]], the mitigatory defense of [[Provocation (legal)|provocation]] has been used in violent attacks against LGBT persons, which has led several [[Australia|Australian]] states and territories to modify their legislation, in order to prevent or reduce the using of this legal defense in cases of violent responses to non-violent homosexual advances.

There have been several highly publicized cases where people convicted of violence against LGBT people have received shorter sentences. One such case is that of Kenneth Brewer. On 30 September 1997, he met Stephen Bright at a local gay bar. He bought the younger man drinks and they later went back to Brewer's apartment. While there, Brewer made a sexual advance toward Bright, and Bright beat him to death. Bright was initially charged with [[second-degree murder]], but he was eventually convicted of third-degree [[assault]] and was sentenced to one year in prison.&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reasonable"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Lee|first=Cynthia|title=Murder and the Reasonable Man: Passion and Fear in the Criminal Courtroom|url=https://books.google.com/?id=se0xg_yvRSMC&amp;pg=PA91 |publisher=[[NYU Press]]|year=2003|isbn=978-0-8147-5115-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Cases like Bright's are not isolated. In 2001, [[Aaron Webster]] was beaten to death by a group of youths armed with baseball bats and a pool cue while hanging around an area of [[Stanley Park]] frequented by gay men. Ryan Cran was convicted of [[manslaughter]] in the case in 2004 and released on parole in 2009 after serving only 4 years of his six-year sentence.&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt; Two youths were tried under Canada's [[Youth Criminal Justice Act]] and sentenced to three years after pleading guilty. A fourth assailant was [[acquitted]].&lt;ref name="CBC"/&gt;

Judges are not immune to letting their own prejudices affect their judgment either. In 1988, [[LGBT rights in Texas|Texas]] Judge Jack Hampton gave a man 30 years for killing two gay men, instead of the life sentence requested by the prosecutor. After handing down his judgment, he said: "I don't much care for queers cruising the streets picking up teenage boys ...[I] put prostitutes and gays at about the same level ... and I'd be hard put to give somebody life for killing a prostitute."&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/news/1998/10/23news.html|title=Asking for it|last=Stryker|first=Jeff|publisher=[[Salon Magazine]]|date=23 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, a [[LGBT rights in Florida|Florida]] judge trying a case concerning the beating to death of a gay man asked the prosecutor, "That's a crime now, to beat up a homosexual?"  The prosecutor responded, "Yes, sir. And it's also a crime to kill them."  "Times have really changed," the judge replied. The judge, Daniel Futch, maintained that he was joking, but was removed from the case.&lt;ref name="ALTS"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Hate Crimes: a reference handbook|last=Altschiller|first=Donald|publisher=ABC-CLIO|year=2005|pages=26–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Salon"/&gt;

[[Gay pride parade|LGBT Pride Parades]] often attract violence because of their public nature. Though many countries where such events take place attempt to provide police protection to participants, some would prefer that the parades not happen, and police either ignore or encourage violent protesters. The country of [[LGBT rights in Moldova|Moldova]] has shown particular contempt to marchers, shutting down official requests to hold parades and allowing protesters to intimidate and harm any who try to march anyway. In 2007, after being denied a request to hold a parade, a small group of LGBT people tried to hold a small gathering. They were surrounded by a group twice their size who shouted derogatory things at them and pelted them with eggs. The gathering proceeded even so, and they tried to lay flowers at the Monument to the Victims of Repression. They were denied the opportunity, however, by a large group of police claiming they needed permission from [[city hall]].&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;

The following year, a parade was again attempted. A bus carried approximately 60 participants to the capital, but before they could disembark, an angry crowd surrounded the bus. They shouted things like "let's get them out and beat them up", and "beat them to death, don't let them escape" at the frightened passengers. The mob told the activists that if they wanted to leave the bus unharmed, they would have to destroy all of their pride materials. The passengers complied and the march was called off. All the while, police stood passively about 100 meters away, taking no action even though passengers claimed at least nine emergency calls were made to police while on the bus.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Christian|title=Gay Pride Parade Trapped on Bus|publisher=SameSame|date=May 12, 2008|url=http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028012532/http://www.samesame.com.au/news/international/2413/Gay-Pride-Parade-Trapped-On-Bus.htm|archivedate=October 28, 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=67 GenderDoc-M|title=Moldovan Gay Pride Threatened, Cops Refuse Protection for Marchers|date=May 11, 2008|url=http://mpetrelis.blogspot.com/2008/05/moldovan-gay-pride-threatened-cops.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Russia]]'s officials are similarly averse to [[LGBT culture in Russia|Pride Parades]]. [[Mayor of Moscow|Mayor]] of [[Moscow]] [[Yury Luzhkov]] has repeatedly banned marches, calling them "[[satan]]ic".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ireland|first=Doug|title=Moscow Pride Banned Again|publisher=UK Gay News|date=May 17, 2007|url=http://www.ukgaynews.org.uk/Archive/08/May/3107.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304181750/http://ukgaynews.org.uk/archive/08/may/3107.htm|archivedate=March 4, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pride participants instead tried to peacefully assemble and deliver a petition to city hall regarding the [[right of assembly]] and [[Freedom of speech by country#Russia|freedom of expression]]. They were met by [[skinheads]] and other protesters, and police who had closed off the square and immediately arrested activists as they entered. As some were being arrested, other participants were attacked by protesters. Police did nothing. Around eleven women and two men were arrested and left in the heat, denied medical attention, and verbally abused by police officers. The officers told the women, "No one needs lesbians, no one will ever get you out of here." When participants were released from custody hours later, they were pelted by eggs and shouted at by protesters who had been waiting.&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=We Have the Upper Hand: Freedom of assembly in Russia and the human rights of lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender people|date=June 2007|url=http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]] and [[ILGA-Europe]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202073400/http://www.ilga-europe.org/europe/guide/country_by_country/russia/report_on_moscow_pride_2007_in_english|archivedate=2008-12-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[LGBT rights in Hungary|Hungary]], on the other hand, has tried to afford the best protection they can to marchers, but cannot stem the flow of violence. In 2008, hundreds of people participated in the [[Budapest Pride|Budapest Dignity March]]. Police, on alert due to attacks on two LGBT-affiliated businesses earlier in the week, erected high metal barriers on either side of the street the march was to take place on. Hundreds of angry protesters threw petrol bombs and rocks at police in retaliation. A police van was set on fire and two police officers were injured in the attacks. During the parade itself, protesters threw [[Molotov cocktail]]s, eggs and firecrackers at marchers. At least eight participants were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peto, Sandor and Krisztina Than|title=Anti-gay violence mars Hungarian parade|publisher=The Star Online|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2008/7/6/worldupdates/2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014221138/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2008%2F7%2F6%2Fworldupdates%2F2008-07-06T094921Z_01_NOOTR_RTRMDNC_0_-343906-1&amp;sec=Worldupdates|archivedate=October 14, 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forty-five people were detained in connection with the attacks, and observers called the spectacle "the worst violence during the dozen years the Gay Pride Parade has taken place in Budapest".&lt;ref name="HRF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bos|first=Stefan|title=Violent Protests Disrupt Hungary's Gay Rights Parade|publisher=VOA News|date=July 6, 2008|url=http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080802145651/http://voanews.com/english/2008-07-06-voa1.cfm|archivedate=August 2, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Israel]], three marchers in a [[Jerusalem gay pride parade|gay pride parade in Jerusalem]] on June 30, 2005 were stabbed by [[Yishai Shlisel]], a [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jew]]. Shlisel claimed he had acted "in the name of God". He was charged with attempted murder.Ten years later, On 30 July 2015, [[Jerusalem gay pride parade#2015 attack|six marchers were injured]], again by [[Yishai Shlisel]] when he stabbed them. It was three weeks after he was released from jail. One of the victims, 16-year-old Shira Banki, died of her wounds at the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] three days later, on 2 August 2015. Shortly after, Prime Minister Netanyahu offered his condolences, adding "We will deal with the murderer to the fullest extent of the law."

===Advocacy in song lyrics===
[[File:Buju Banton (Apollo theater, 2007).jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Buju Banton]], a Jamaican musician, performing in 2007.]]
As a result of the strong anti-homosexual culture in [[Jamaica]], many [[reggae]] and [[dancehall]] artists, such as [[Buju Banton]], [[Elephant Man (musician)|Elephant Man]], [[Sizzla]], have published song lyrics advocating violence against homosexuals.
Similarly, [[hip-hop]] music occasionally includes aggressively homophobic lyrics,&lt;ref name=PBS&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/independentlens/hiphop/gender.htm|title=Homophobia and Hip-Hop|publisher=PBS|accessdate=2009-03-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; but has since appeared to reform.

Banton wrote a song when he was 15 years old that became a hit when he released it years later in 1992 called "Boom Bye Bye". The song is about murdering homosexuals and "advocated the shooting of gay men, pouring acid on them and burning them alive."&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; A song by Elephant Man proclaims: "When you hear a lesbian getting raped/It's not our fault ... Two women in bed/That's two sodomites who should be dead."&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;

Canadian activists have sought to deport reggae artists from the country due to homophobic content in some of their songs, which they say promote anti-gay violence. In the UK, [[Scotland Yard]] has investigated reggae [[lyrics]] and Sizzla was barred from entering the [[United Kingdom]] in 2004 over accusations his music promotes murder.&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/coalition-seeks-ejection-of-reggae-stars-over-anti-gay-lyrics-1.650484|title=Coalition seeks ejection of reggae stars over anti-gay lyrics|publisher=[[CBC News]]|date=September 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gay rights advocates have started the group [[Stop Murder Music]] to combat what they say is the promotion of hate and violence by artists. The group organized protests, causing some venues to refuse to allow the targeted artists to perform, and the loss of sponsors. In 2007, the group asked reggae artists to promise "not to produce music or make public statements inciting hatred against gay people. Neither can they authorise the re-release of previous homophobic songs." Several artists signed that agreement, including Buju Banton, Beenie Man, Sizzla and [[Capleton]],&lt;ref name="freemuse" /&gt; but some later denied signing it.&lt;ref name="belfast" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-9251.html|title=Immigration minister criticised for letting homophobic artist into Canada|first=Tony|last=Grew|publisher=[[Pink News]]|date=October 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s, skinheads in North America who promoted emerging neo-Nazi pop culture and [[Racism in North America|racist]] rock songs increasingly went to punk rock concerts that with anti-gay music advocating violence.

==Motivations==
===Macho culture and social homophobia===
{{Original research section|date=April 2013}}
{{main|Homophobia}}
The vast majority of homophobic criminal assault is perpetrated by male aggressors on male victims, and is connected to aggressive heterosexual [[machismo]] or [[male chauvinism]].
Theorists including [[Calvin Thomas (critical theorist)|Calvin Thomas]] and [[Judith Butler]] have suggested that homophobia can be rooted in an individual's fear of being identified as gay.
Homophobia in men is correlated with insecurity about masculinity.&lt;ref name="PBS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nancy J. Chodorow. [http://www.cyberpsych.org/homophobia/chodorow.htm Statement in a public forum on homophobia by The American Psychoanalytic Foundation, 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.livescience.com/health/050802_masculinity.html|title=Masculinity Challenged, Men Prefer War and SUVs|work=LiveScience.com|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, allegedly homophobia is rampant in sports, and in the [[subculture]] of its supporters, that are considered [[stereotype|stereotypically]] "male", such as [[association football|football]] and [[rugby football|rugby]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/news/sports/34787/fans-culture-hard-to-change "Fans' culture hard to change"]&lt;/ref&gt;

These theorists have argued that a person who expresses homophobia does so not only to communicate their beliefs about the class of gay people, but also to distance themselves from this class and its social status. Thus, by distancing themselves from gay people, they are reaffirming their role as a heterosexual in a [[heteronormative]] culture, thereby attempting to prevent themselves from being labeled and treated as a gay person.

Various [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] theories explain homophobia as a threat to an individual's own same-sex impulses, whether those impulses are imminent or merely hypothetical. This threat causes repression, denial or [[reaction formation]].&lt;ref&gt;West, D.J. ''Homosexuality re-examined.''

====Religious texts====
{{Religious text primary|section|date=May 2016}}
Some verses of the [[Bible and violence|Bible]] are often interpreted as forbidding homosexual relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|18:22|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Leviticus|20:13|KJV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thou shalt not lie with mankind, as with womankind: it is [[Abomination (Bible)|abomination]].|[[Leviticus 18]]:22}}

{{quote|And if a man lie with mankind, as with womankind, both of them have committed abomination: they shall surely be put to death; their blood shall be upon them.|[[Kedoshim|Leviticus 20]]:13}}

The above verses are the cause of tension between the devout of the [[Abrahamic religions]] and members of the LGBT community. It is viewed by many as an outright condemnation of homosexual acts between men, and, more commonly in ancient times than today, justification for violence.

In ''Religion Dispatches'' magazine, Candace Chellew-Hodge argues that the six or so verses that are often cited to condemn LGBT people are referring instead to "abusive sex." She states that the Bible has no condemnation for "loving, committed, gay and lesbian relationships" and that [[Jesus]] was silent on the subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religiondispatches.org/blog/sexandgender/802/the_%22gay%22_princess_di_bible/|title=The "Gay" Princess Di Bible|author=Candace Chellew-Hodge|work=Religion Dispatches|accessdate=14 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Christian groups advocate [[conversion therapy]] and promote [[ex-gay]] groups.

The [[Homosexuality and Roman Catholicism|Catholic Church teaches]] that a homosexual orientation is not sinful and that LGBT people are to be treated with compassion and respect, as all others are.  It also [[theology of the body|teaches that sex]] is meant to be had between opposite sex spouses.  A 1992 letter from [[Pope Benedict XVI|Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger]], the future Pope Benedict XVI, condemned [[gay bashing]].&lt;ref name=reltol/&gt;  It said that LGBT people "have the same rights as all persons including the right of not being treated in a manner which offends their personal dignity."&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;  It adds that 
 	
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is deplorable that homosexual persons have been and are the object of violent malice in speech or in action. Such treatment deserves condemnation from the Church's pastors wherever it occurs. It reveals a kind of disregard for others which endangers the most fundamental principles of a healthy society. The intrinsic dignity of each person must always be respected in word, in action and in law.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;&lt;ref name=assumption/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, in the same letter Ratzinger suggested that anti-gay violence could be the fault of victims if they push too hard to seek equal rights, thereby absolving responsibility by those who conduct violent behaviour:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When civil legislation is introduced to protect behavior to which no one has any conceivable right, neither the church nor society at large should be surprised when other distorted notions and practices gain ground and irrational and violent reactions increase.&lt;ref name=July92/&gt;  
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Theology of Pope Benedict XVI#Homosexuality and LGBT rights|Pope Benedict XVI]], then the leader of the [[Roman Catholic Church]] stated that "protecting" humanity from homosexuality was just as important as saving the world from [[climate change]] and that all relationships beyond traditional heterosexual ones are a "destruction of God's work."&lt;ref name="pope" /&gt;{{deadlink|date=July 2018}} [[Pope Francis]] has been seen as [[Pastoral care for gay Catholics|more welcoming to LGBT people]], saying to a gay man that "God made you like this.

[[Evangelicalism#Africa|Evangelicals in Africa]] sometimes use religion to justify violence against LGBT people and criminalizing homosexual behavior. [[Archbishop]]s [[Peter Akinola]] of [[Christianity in Nigeria|Nigeria]] and Henry Orombi of [[Religion in Uganda#Christianity|Uganda]] would not condemn violence against gays and lesbians when questioned on the issue at the [[Global Anglican Future Conference]].&lt;ref name="ekklesia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ekklesia.co.uk/node/7382|title=Evangelical leader criticises failure to condemn violence against gays|publisher=Ekklesia|date=June 26, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mark Russell, Chief Executive of [[Church Army]], expressed outrage over their resistance, stating "Quite honestly [refusal to condemn violence against gay people in their home countries] is disgraceful, it sullies their cause, and is totally un-Christian. You cannot justify violence in God's name. Period. [...] Those who perpetrate violence against gay people in Africa now can use this silence to justify their behaviour. Christians must speak up and say this is wrong."&lt;ref name="ekklesia" /&gt;

====Islam====
{{See also|Islam and homosexuality}}
The [[Quran and violence|Quran]], the book of Islam, cites the story of the "people of [[Lot in Islam|Lot]]" (also known as the people of [[Sodom and Gomorrah#Islamic|Sodom and Gomorrah]]), destroyed by the [[Anger#Islam|wrath]] of [[God in Islam|Allah]] because they engaged in [[Lust#Islam|lustful]] carnal acts between men.

[[Islam#Scholars|Scholars of Islam]], such as [[Shaykh al-Islām]] [[Imam Malik]], and [[Imam Shafi]] amongst others, ruled that Islam disallowed homosexuality and ordained capital punishment for a person guilty of it.&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar/FatwaE/FatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|title=Homosexuality and Lesbianism: Sexual Perversions|publisher=IslamOnline|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603002449/http://www.islamonline.net/servlet/Satellite?pagename=IslamOnline-English-Ask_Scholar%2FFatwaE%2FFatwaE&amp;cid=1119503545556|archivedate=2010-06-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal punishment for [[Islamic views on anal sex|sodomy]] has varied among juristic schools: some prescribe [[Capital and corporal punishment in Islam|capital punishment]]; while other prescribe a milder discretionary punishment. Homosexual activity is a [[Islamic criminal jurisprudence|crime]] and forbidden in most [[Islam by country|Muslim-majority countries]]. In some relatively [[Islam and secularism|secular]] Muslim-majority countries such as [[LGBT rights in Indonesia|Indonesia]],&lt;ref name="RoughGuideSEAsia2005"&gt;{{cite book|title=Rough Guide to South East Asia: Third Edition|page=74|url=http://www.roughguides.com/|publisher=Rough Guides Ltd|isbn=1-84353-437-1|date=August 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[LGBT rights in Jordan|Jordan]] and [[LGBT rights in Turkey|Turkey]], this is not the case.

The [[Quran]], much like the [[Bible]] and [[Torah]], has a vague condemnation of homosexuality and how it should be dealt with, leaving it open to interpretation. For this reason, Islamic jurists have turned to the collections of the [[hadith]] (sayings of [[Muhammad]]) and [[Sunnah]] (accounts of his life). These, on the other hand, are perfectly clear and particularly harsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|author=Bosworth, Ed. C. and E. van Donzel|title=The Encyclopaedia of Islam|publisher=Leiden|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Abu'l-Faraj ibn al-Jawzi|Ibn al-Jawzi]] records Muhammad as cursing sodomites in several hadith, and recommending the death penalty for both the active and passive partners in same-sex acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hQuHFPKp8L0C&amp;pg=PA89|last=Wafer|first=Jim|title=Muhammad and Male Homosexuality|page=89 |publisher=New York University Press|year=1997|accessdate=2010-07-24|isbn=978-0-8147-7468-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sunan al-Tirmidhi]] again reports Muhammad as having prescribed the death penalty for both the active and the passive partner: "Whoever you find committing the sin of the people of Lot, kill them, both the one who does it and the one to whom it is done."&lt;ref name="Fatwa IslamOnline"/&gt; The overall moral or theological principle is that a person who performs such actions challenges the harmony of God's creation, and is therefore a revolt against God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dynes|first=Wayne|title=Encyclopaedia of Homosexuality|location=New York|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though it must be noted that these views vary depending upon sect. It is noteworthy to point out that Quranists (those who do not integrate the aforementioned Hadiths into their belief system) do not advocate capital punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masjidtucson.org/submission/perspectives/more/traits/homosexuality.html|title=Homosexuality prohibited in Submission (Islam)|website=www.masjidtucson.org|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Imam (Sunni Islam)|imams]] still preach their views, stating that homosexuals and "women who act like men" should be executed under the Islamic law. Abu Usamah at [[Green Lane Masjid|Green Lane Mosque]] in [[Religion in Birmingham#Islam|Birmingham]] defended his words to followers by saying "If I were to call homosexuals perverted, dirty, filthy dogs who should be executed, that's my freedom of speech, isn't it?"&lt;ref name="pinknews"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-8869.html|title=Violence against gays preached in British mosques claims new documentary|first=Tony|last=Grew|publisher=[[Pink News]]|date=September 1, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other contemporary Islamic views are that the ″crime of homosexuality is one of the greatest of crimes, the worst of [[Sin#Islam|sins]] and the most abhorrent of deeds″.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/38622/ The punishment for homosexuality] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921163324/http://www.islam-qa.com/en/ref/38622# |date=2013-09-21 }}&lt;br&gt;Islam Q&amp;A, Fatwa No. 38622&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexuality is considered the 11th major sin in Islam, in the days of the [[Sahabah|companions of Muhammad]], a [[Islamic views on slavery|slave]] boy was once forgiven for killing his master who sodomized him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.al-islam.org/greater-sins-volume-1-ayatullah-sayyid-abdul-husayn-dastghaib-shirazi/eleventh-greater-sin-sodomy|title=Eleventh Greater sin: Sodomy|website=Al-Islam.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Judaism====
{{See also|Judaism and homosexuality}}
In [[Judaism]], the [[Capital and corporal punishment in Judaism|death penalty]] against homosexuality has not been used in practice for more than 2000 years, though many [[Jewish religious movements|movements]] still view homosexual acts as sinful. [[Orthodox Judaism]] [[Homosexuality and Judaism#Orthodox Jewish views|generally prohibits homosexual conduct]]. While there is disagreement about which acts come under core prohibitions, all of Orthodox Judaism puts certain core homosexual acts, including [[Sodomy#Judaism|sodomy]] in the category of ''yehareg ve'al ya'avor''&amp;mdash;"die rather than transgress"&amp;mdash;the small category of Biblically-prohibited acts (also including [[Thou shalt not kill#Jewish doctrine|murder]], [[Idolatry in Judaism|idolatry]], [[Thou shalt not commit adultery#In Judaism|adultery]], and [[Jewish views on incest|incest]]) which an Orthodox Jew is obligated under the laws of [[self-sacrifice under Jewish Law]] to die rather than do.

The  '''Zygons''' are an [[Extraterrestrial life in popular culture|extraterrestrial]] race in the long-running British [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] programme ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  The Zygons have shape-shifting abilities, allowing them to replicate the appearance of another being, but they must keep the subject alive in order to use its body print. Limited by the small size of their force, they rely on shape-shifting and their organic space craft to conceal their numbers and seize power on Earth.

[[Tenth Doctor]] actor [[David Tennant]] has stated that they are his favourite monsters from the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.david-tennant.com/2009/id6.html|title=David Tennant – The Original Fansite|work=David Tennant – The Original Fansite}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appearances==
===Television===
The Zygons first appeared in the 1975 serial ''[[Terror of the Zygons]]'', in which they planned to conquer Earth following the destruction of the Zygon homeworld. One of their spacecraft, commanded by warlord Broton, crash-landed into [[Loch Ness]] in Antiquity. The Zygons used a Skarasen (a creature that provides milk for their sustenance and which had become known as the [[Loch Ness Monster]] by humans) to attack an energy conference in London. The plan was foiled and Broton and his crew were killed, due to the intervention of the [[Fourth Doctor]] and the [[United Nations Intelligence Taskforce]] (UNIT). The Skarasen retreated into the depths of Loch Ness.

The Zygons are briefly mentioned (but not seen) in the [[Eleventh Doctor]] episode "[[The Pandorica Opens]]" (2010) as one of the many races in an alliance against the Doctor. In the 2012 episode, "[[The Power of Three (Doctor Who)|The Power of Three]]", a Zygon ship is hidden beneath the [[Savoy Hotel]] where [[Doctor (Doctor Who)|the Doctor]] takes [[Amy Pond]] and [[Rory Williams]] on their wedding anniversary. All the Zygons are disguised as hotel staff.

The Zygons returned in 2013 in "[[The Day of the Doctor]]", the 50th anniversary episode of the programme.&lt;ref name="Huff"/&gt; The episode hints the stellar explosion (said to have destroyed their homeworld in the 1975 serial) was an effect of the Time War. A squad places themselves in suspended animation in Elizabethan England, planning to awaken in 2013 to infiltrate the [[Tower of London]]'s Black Archive disguised as UNIT members. The scheme is foiled by the intervention of the [[Tenth Doctor]], the [[Eleventh Doctor]] and the [[War Doctor]]. When UNIT is overrun by Zygon doppelgangers, Kate Lethbridge-Stewart threatens to detonate a nuclear device to prevent Zygon access to UNIT's storehouse of alien technology. The Doctors successfully negotiate a truce between the two species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/doctorwho/articles/The-Daleks-to-Return-in-the-Anniversary-Special|title=BBC Latest News – Doctor Who – The Daleks to Return in the Anniversary Special!|author=The Doctor Who Team|work=Doctor Who}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Huff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/18/doctor-who-50th-anniversary-daleks-cyberman_n_3106934.html|title='Doctor Who' 50th Anniversary Episode To Feature Daleks, Cyberman And Zygons|work=The Huffington Post UK}}. Retrieved November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ramifications of this treaty are explored in the [[Doctor Who (series 9)|ninth series]] two-parter "[[The Zygon Invasion]]" / "[[The Zygon Inversion]]" (2015). Zygons were allowed to re-home on Earth on the condition that they disguised themselves as people and lived incognito. In the intervening time, they developed the ability to retain a person's likeness after the death of the original and shapeshift into someone based on a telepathic scan of a nearby being. Although older generations of Zygons were committed to integration with human communities, the younger generations resented being forced to live as humans and quickly radicalised. The radicals and UNIT once again enter stalemate at the Tower of London, both poised to destroy one another, but the [[Twelfth Doctor]] makes an impassioned plea and convinces the radical Zygon leader to understand the lasting peace which the treaty was written to preserve.

===Print===
''Terror of The Zygons'' was novelized by Target in 1976, written by [[Terrance Dicks]], under the title ''Doctor Who and the Loch Ness Monster''.&lt;ref name=dicks&gt;{{cite book|last=Dicks|first=Terrance|title=Doctor Who and the Loch Ness Monster|date=2012|isbn=1-4464-1773-5|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1446417735}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The book further expounded on the concept of the Zygon "sting," poisonous barbs protruding from their hands, which explains why, in the television episode, the Zygons were able to inflict pain on other beings with a mere touch.  (The original shooting script for the episode also included references to the sting but the on-screen portrayal of the concept failed to make it clear to the audience.)

The comic story "Skywatch-7", written by [[Alan McKenzie]] (under the pseudonym "Maxwell Stockbridge") and illustrated by [[Mick Austin]], features a UNIT team encountering a single Zygon at a remote base.  It was first published, in two parts, in ''[[Doctor Who Magazine|Doctor Who Monthly]]'' #58 and the ''Doctor Who Winter Special 1981''.

The [[Eighth Doctor]] encountered the Zygons in the [[Eighth Doctor Adventures|spin-off novel]] ''[[The Bodysnatchers (novel)|The Bodysnatchers]]'' by [[Mark Morris (writer)|Mark Morris]],&lt;ref name=morris&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Mark|title=The bodysnatchers|date=1997|publisher=[[BBC Books]]|location=London|isbn=0-563-40568-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0563405686}}&lt;/ref&gt;  which also named the now-destroyed Zygon homeworld as Zygor. The novel also revealed that Zygor had been destroyed as a result of an attack by an [[arachnid]] alien race from [[Tau Ceti]], the Xaranti. The Doctor, his companion Sam Jones, and the [[Fourth Doctor]]'s old acquaintance Professor Litefoot are able to stop the Zygons by poisoning the milk supply (although the Doctor had intended to merely drug them and miscalculated the dose), the Doctor taking the survivors to another planet.

The Zygons appear in the [[New Series Adventures (Doctor Who)|New Series Adventures]] novel ''[[Sting of the Zygons]]'' by [[Stephen Cole (writer)|Stephen Cole]],&lt;ref name=cole&gt;{{cite book|last=Cole|first=Stephen|title=Sting of the Zygons|date=2007|publisher=BBC|location=London|isbn=1-4090-7340-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1409073408}}&lt;/ref&gt;  featuring the [[Tenth Doctor]] and [[Martha Jones]], which is set in the [[Lake District]] in 1909. A plan to set up a royal funeral where the Zygons could replace the rulers of various nations is thwarted through the Doctor's intervention, as well as a Zygon civil war when one of their two Skarasens is killed.

===Audio===
The Zygons have been featured in three audio plays produced by [[BBV]], ''Homeland'' by Paul Dearing, ''Absolution'' (not to be confused with the [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] play [[Absolution (Doctor Who audio)|Absolution]]) by Paul Ebbs and ''The Barnacled Baby'' by Anthony Keetch.

They made their [[Big Finish Productions|Big Finish]] debut in the [[Eighth Doctor]] audio adventure ''[[The Zygon Who Fell to Earth]]'' by [[Paul Magrs]] and returned in ''[[Death in Blackpool]]'' by [[Alan Barnes (writer)|Alan Barnes]].

The Zygons also feature in ''Zygon Hunt'' by Nicholas Briggs, facing the Fourth Doctor and [[Leela (Doctor Who)|Leela]].

The Zygons were featured in the second Doctor Who [[Weetabix]] promotional set and were card number 9 in the Typhoo tea card set.  Harlequin Miniatures produced two 28&amp;nbsp;mm figures, and Fine Art Castings produced two Zygon figurines, sized 80&amp;nbsp;mm and 40&amp;nbsp;mm. In October 2016 Recent onscreen versions have now been released in 28mm, by Warlord Games.

In 2008, a Zygon figure was released by Character Options in the first wave of their classic ''Doctor Who'' toy line.

On 26 June 2014 a Zygon as featured in "The Day of the Doctor" was released as part of the ongoing ''Doctor Who'' figurine collection from [[Eaglemoss]].  The Zygon will be the 23rd in the regular line of releases.

==Zygon (BBV production)==
{{main|Zygon: When Being You Just Isn't Enough}}
''Zygon'' is a spin-off drama production from [[BBV]], featuring the Zygons. Early drafts were written by [[Lance Parkin]] and later ones by [[Jonathan Blum (writer, born 1972)|Jonathan Blum]], although both authors removed their names from the final version (which was heavily rewritten again). It was eventually released in 2008 as ''Zygon: When Being You Just Isn't Enough '' (with an 18 certificate due to scenes of an adult nature), after a post-production period of about 5 years.
