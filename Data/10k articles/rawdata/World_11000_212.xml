The '''Attorney General of Kenya''' is the head of the Kenyan State Law Office and the principal legal adviser to the government of [[Kenya]] and ''ex officio'' [[Member of Parliament]] and [[Cabinet (government)|Cabinet]]. The current attorney general, [[Paul Kihara Kariuki]], was nominated by the President Uhuru Kenyatta on 13 February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.attorney-general.go.ke/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=60:the-hon-attorney-general-&amp;catid=37:management-profile&amp;Itemid=56 |title=Management Profile: The Hon Attorney General |publisher=Attorney-general.go.ke |date=2011-08-29 |accessdate=2013-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; His nomination was approved by the National Assembly on the 28th of March 2018, after the requisite vetting process.

[[File:ADC englisch RGB.gif|thumb|300px|Logo Austrian Development Cooperation]]

'''Austrian Development Cooperation''' is a program of the government of [[Austria]] that supports countries in [[Africa]], [[Asia]], South-Eastern and Eastern Europe and the Caribbean. 
==Austrian official development assistance (ODA)==

===Actors===
Development cooperation in Austria is a task for the whole of government, which is why alongside the Federal Ministry of Finance and the [[Federal Ministry for Europe, Integration and Foreign Affairs]] other federal ministries, the federal states and municipalities and the Oesterreichische Entwicklungsbank (Austrian Development Bank) also contribute to official development assistance (ODA). Austria reports these contributions to the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD). Its [[Development Assistance Committee]] (DAC) then decides which payments are actually eligible to count as ODA.

The legal basis for Austrian Development Cooperation is the Federal Development Cooperation Act (DCA)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entwicklung.at/uploads/media/development_cooperation_law_01.pdf Development Cooperation Act (DCA)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150522173618/http://www.entwicklung.at/uploads/media/development_cooperation_law_01.pdf |date=May 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; adopted in 2002 and amended in 2003. It contains a specific list of objectives that prescribes development-policy criteria for the whole of the federal administration. The central development-policy positions and strategic framework are defined in the Three-Year-Programme on Austrian Development Policy,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.entwicklung.at/en/publications/programmes/ Three-Year-Programme on Austrian Development Policy]&lt;/ref&gt; which is updated annually under the auspices of FMEIA. Above all, it provides the [[Austrian Development Agency]] (ADA) with the basis for implementing bilateral programmes and projects.

The '''Battle of Geyve''' ({{lang-tr|Geyve Muharebesi}}) was a small but decisive engagement fought during the [[Turkish War of Independence]]. Unlike other battles of the war, forces of the [[Grand National Assembly of Turkey|Grand National Assembly]] directly fought forces of the [[Ottoman Empire|Constantinople government]], which was under [[Allies of World War I|Allied occupation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://forum.memurlar.net/konu/1831001/ Hilafet Ordusu]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Beijing Jiaotong Tai''' (Chinese: 北京交通台) (also known as "Beijing Jiaotong Guangbo" or "Beijing Traffic Radio") is Beijing's traffic station at 103.9 FM.  It is one of the [[radio station]]s of the [[Beijing Renmin Guangbo Diantai]] group.  This particular channel mostly broadcasts commercials in Mandarin and traffic reports.  The format of this channel can be compared to the traffic channels provided by [[XM Radio]] and [[Sirius Satellite Radio]], the commercial all-traffic station [[CHMJ]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]], or the "Highway Advisory radio stations" (the low power AM stations near points along [[Interstate highways]] in the [[United States]]).

The station has one million listeners and its staff view 80% of Beijing's roads from its headquarters at the [[Beijing Traffic Management Bureau]] headquarters.&lt;ref name="cd1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Liu Baijia| title=Road ahead looking clearer for Beijing's motorists| journal=China Daily| year=2008| volume=April| issue=26| url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2008-04/26/content_6645779.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has a network of retired volunteers with apartments at key junctions who are able to draw attention to major traffic problems.

The station also sponsors the largest leisure driving club in China, with 100 staff answering to club chief Chen Ming. The club offers members [[breakdown recovery]] services within the city's [[5th Ring Road (Beijing)|Fifth Ring Road]], as well as organizing long-distance driving tours.&lt;ref name="nyt1"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Ted Conover| title=Capitalist Roaders | volume=July| issue=2| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/02/magazine/02china.html?pagewanted=all | journal=The New York Times | date=2006-07-02 | accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warszawa: Świat Książki, 2008, p.104-108&lt;/ref&gt;

On the dial shared are two belt, the upper blue displaying a sun between two silver horseshoes bars, the lower silver belt shows a pitch black horse.
There is a jewel in the crown of the helmet. Pelmets blue, with the right gold, silver conquered the left.

The earliest mention of the Coat of arms is July 27, 1791 when attributed to Theodore of Rosko-Bogdanowiczowi by Leopold II.,&lt;ref&gt;Juliusz Karol Ostrowski: Księga herbowa rodów polskich. T. 2. Warszawa: Główny skład księgarnia antykwarska B. Bolcewicza, 1897-1906, p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a merchant living in Szionda rewarded for his supply of the [[Austria]]n army. He came from a family of lesser nobility descended from an ancestor was Deoda (Leopold) Bogdanovich.&lt;ref&gt;Sławomir Górzyński: Nobilitacje w Galicji w latach 1772-1918. DiG, 1999, p.72.&lt;/ref&gt;
This shield was however an emblem of its own, so its use is restricted to Theodors branch of the clan.

The '''Campaign for World Government''' was established in 1937 by prominent feminists and peace activists [[Rosika Schwimmer]] and [[Lola Maverick Lloyd]]. It was the first [[World Federalist Movement|World Federalist]] Organization in the 20th century.

In 1937, disenchanted with the [[League of Nations]] and its perceived weaknesses, they announced the Campaign's mission to promote a federal [[world government]] directly representing the interests of the world's people, as opposed to the interests of states.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nypl.org/sites/default/files/archivalcollections/pdf/cwg.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; While the specific methods promoted for achieving this goal shifted over the next several decades, the Campaign adhered to the concept of a populist global federalism throughout its existence.

The Campaign's early platform was outlined in 1937 in their pamphlet "Chaos, War or a New World Order?" which called for the creation of a World Constitutional Convention. At this convention, it was hoped, a framework for a Federation of Nations would be formed, and democratic elections to the federation would be scheduled. Schwimmer and Lloyd included a tentative plan for this novel federal body, including full membership for all countries, direct representation, and several organs of government. Among the plan's elements were a new international date system, the abolition of all military bodies, the peaceful transfer of people out of population-dense regions, and a combined global free-trade and command economy.

Over time, as Schwimmer and Lloyd recognized the increasing unlikelihood of national governments voluntarily forming a world government, their plan shifted emphasis to the peaceful popular demand for the election of such a body. Following this shift, the Campaign began to focus on national consciousness-raising and international conferences of other like-minded groups.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2740">The '''Central Bank of London Ltd.''' was a British [[Joint-stock company|joint stock]] [[bank]], based in [[London]], [[England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Monetary History of the United Kingdom: 1870-1982|last1=Capie|first1=Forrest|last2=Webber|first2=Alan|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=9781136601835|page=539}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Formation and Operations ===
The bank was established in 1863 as the 'East London Bank', with its offices located in [[Cornhill, London|Cornhill]] in the [[City of London]]. Its early business was closely related to the East End trades, and so branches were soon opened at [[Southwark]], [[Shoreditch]] and [[Whitechapel]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tTErDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT200&amp;lpg=PT200&amp;dq=Central+Bank+of+London+Ltd.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TgE3dLKcbn&amp;sig=KgiNCdhESPYrcMD6ksMIb4bPdXA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjlt5u9muvVAhXMLMAKHbzRDjAQ6AEISzAF#v=onepage&amp;q=Central%20Bank%20of%20London%20Ltd.&amp;f=false|title=British Banking: A Guide to Historical Records|last=Orbell|first=John|date=2017-07-05|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351954679|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deposits had reached £495,000 by 1865, and by 1870 the bank was renamed the 'Central Bank of London'. In the mid 1870s further branches opened in [[Mile End]], [[Blackfriars, London|Blackfriars]], [[Tottenham Court Road]], [[Newgate Street, London|Newgate Street]] and [[Clerkenwell]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Deposits grew to £1 million in 1877 and further branches were opened at [[Shaftesbury Avenue]] and [[Bethnal Green]] during the 1880s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1889 the bank acquired the failing [[Bethnal Green Bank]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Fate ===
Still relatively small when compared to other competing London banks, the bank was acquired by the [[Midland Bank|Birmingham and Midland Bank]] (established in 1836), which was looking for a London operation to serve its expansion. At the point of acquisition the bank's deposits had peaked at £1.6 million, with paid-up capital at £156,000 and ten open branches.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The amalgamated bank was renamed the 'London and Midland Bank', occupying the Central Bank's headquarters in Cornhill. This bank eventually became the 'Midland Bank' and then was finally acquired by [[HSBC]] in 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.about.hsbc.co.uk/hsbc-in-the-uk/history-timeline|title=History timeline - About HSBC {{!}} HSBC UK|website=www.about.hsbc.co.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2017-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9349">The '''China-Pakistan border''' is 438km (272m) and runs west-east from the tripoint with [[Afghanistan]] to the disputed tripoint with [[India]] in the vicinity of the [[Siachen Glacier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |url= https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pk.html|title=CIA World Factbook - Pakistan |date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It traverses the [[Karakorum Mountains]], one of the world's tallest mountain ranges.

[[File:K2 2006b.jpg|thumb|right|[[K2]], the world's second-tallest mountain, lies on the border]]

==History==
The modern border dates from the period of the [[British Raj|Raj]] when Britain controlled India, including what is now Pakistan. In 1899 the British, via its envoy to China Sir [[Claude MacDonald]], proposed what became known as the [[MacDonald Line]] to the Chinese government, however the Chinese never responded to the proposal and thus the border was never formalised.&lt;ref name="IBS64"&gt;{{cite |url= http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS085.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 85 – China-Pakistan Boundary|date=15 November 1968|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the following decades a variety of maps were issues by all sides in the dispute, showing wildly varying boundaries.&lt;ref name="IBS64"&gt;{{cite |url= http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS085.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 85 – China-Pakistan Boundary|date=15 November 1968|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; India and Pakistan inherited the dispute upon independence in 1947, further complicated by their [[Kashmir conflict|dispute]] over ownership of [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. The issue came to the fore in the early 1960s, at a time of intense tension in the region due to ongoing failure to solve the Indo-Pakistani dispute over Kashmir, a much greater Chinese presence in [[Tibet]], and the [[Sino-Indian War]] of 1962 in which China had seized control of the Indian-claimed [[Aksai Chin]] region. In 1961 China and Pakistan agreed in principle to demarcate their common border; negotiations commenced the following year, with the final [[Sino-Pakistan Agreement]] being signed in 1963.&lt;ref name="IBS64"&gt;{{cite |url= http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS085.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 85 – China-Pakistan Boundary|date=15 November 1968|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both sides made concessions in the treaty, including Pakistani giving China the area known around the Shaksgam Valley known as the [[Trans-Karakoram Tract]].&lt;ref name="IBS64"&gt;{{cite |url= http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS085.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 85 – China-Pakistan Boundary|date=15 November 1968|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the treaty a series of maps and aerial surveys of the border area were made and boundary pillars were installed.&lt;ref name="IBS64"&gt;{{cite |url= http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS085.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 85 – China-Pakistan Boundary|date=15 November 1968|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The 1963 Sino-Pakistani agreement delimited the boundary as follows&lt;ref name="IBS64"&gt;{{cite |url= http://fall.fsulawrc.com/collection/LimitsinSeas/IBS085.pdf|title=International Boundary Study No. 85 – China-Pakistan Boundary|date=15 November 1968|access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;:

"Article Two
… (1) Commencing from its northwestern extremity at height 5,630 metres (a peak, the
reference co-ordinates of which are approximately Longitude 74° 34' E and Latitude 37°
03' N), the boundary line runs generally eastward and then southeastward strictly along the
main watershed between the tributaries of the Tashkurgan River of the Tarim River system
on the one hand and the tributaries of the Hunza River of the Indus River system on the other hand, passing through the Kilik Daban (Dawan), the Mintaka Daban (Pass), the Kharchanai Daban (named on the Chinese map only), the Kutejilga Daban (named on the
Chinese map only), and the Parpik Pass (named on the Pakistan map only), and reaches
the Khunjerab (Yutr) Daban (Pass).

(2) After passing through the Khunjerab (Yutr) Daban (Pass), the boundary line runs
generally southward along the above-mentioned main watershed up to a mountaintop south
of the Daban (Pass), where it leaves the main watershed to follow the crest of a spur lying
generally in a south-easterly direction, which is the watershed between the Akjilga River (a
nameless corresponding river on the Pakistan map) on the one hand, and the
Taghdumbash (Oprang River) and the Keliman Su (Oprang Jilga) on the other hand.
According to the map of the Chinese side, the boundary line, after leaving the southeastern
extremity of this spur, runs along a small section of the middle line of the bed of the Keliman
Su to reach its confluence with the Kelechin River. According to the map of the Pakistan
side, the boundary line, after leaving the southeastern extremity of this spur, reaches the
sharp bend of the Shaksgam or Mustagh River.

(3) From the aforesaid point, the boundary line runs up the Kelechin River (Shaksgam or
Muztagh River) along the middle line of its bed to its confluence (reference co-ordinates
approximately Longitude 76° 02' E. and Latitude 36° 26' N.) with the Sorbulak Daria
(Shimshal River or Braldu River).

(4) From the confluence of the aforesaid two rivers, the boundary line, according to the
map of the Chinese side, ascends the crest of a spur and runs along it to join the
Karakoram Range main watershed at a mountain-top (reference co-ordinates
approximately Longitude 75° 54' E. and Latitude 36° 15' N.), which on this map is shown
as belonging to the Shorbulak Mountain. According to the map of the Pakistan side, the
boundary line from the confluence of the above-mentioned two rivers ascends the crest of a
corresponding spur and runs along it; passing through Height 6,520 metres (21,300 feet)
till it joins the Karakoram Range main watershed at a peak (reference co-ordinates
approximately Longitude 75° 57' E. and Latitude 36° 03' N.).

(5) Thence, the boundary line, running generally southward and then eastward, strictly
follows the Karakoram Range main watershed which separates the Tarim River drainage
system from the Indus River drainage system, passing through the East Mustagh Pass
(Muztagh Pass), the top of the Chogri Peak (K2), the top of the Broad Peak, the top of the
Gasherbrum Mountain (8068) Indirakoli Pass (named on the Chinese map only) and the
top of the Teram Kangri Peak, and reaches its southeastern extremity at the Karakoram
Pass."

==Disputed status==
[[File:Kashmir region 2004.jpg|thumb|right|Map of Kashmir showing the territories disputed between India, Pakistan and China]]
The border is not recognised by India, which claims the whole of [[Jammu and Kashmir]] state, a claim which negates any Sino-Pakistani border and indeed would give India a common border with Afghanistan. India refuses to recognise the legality of the 1963 Sino-Pakistan treaty or the cession of the Trans-Karakorum Tract (Shaksgam Valley) to China, a position further complicated by the fact that large sections of the rest of the China-India boundary are also disputed.&lt;ref name=GlobalSecurity&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/india-china_conflicts.htm |title=India-China Border Dispute |publisher=GlobalSecurity.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1984 India occupied the [[Siachen glacier]] in Kashmir, thereby altering the de facto China-Inda-Pakistan tripoint.&lt;ref name="They shall not pass"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/siachen-while-the-battle-continues-to-rage-no-settlement-is-in-sight/1/306971.html|title=Siachen: While the battle continues to rage, no settlement is in sight|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timescrest.com/opinion/bullish-on-siachen-9572|title=Bullish on Siachen|author=Praveen Dass|work=The Crest Edition|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222021918/http://www.timescrest.com/opinion/bullish-on-siachen-9572|archivedate=22 February 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 6 of the 1963 Sino-Pakistan treaty provides for a renegotiation of the China-Pakistan boundary if the Kashmir dispute is resolved. However, with Indian relations still cool with China, and poor-to-hostile with Pakistan, it is unlikely the boundary dispute will be resolved soon.

==Border crossings==
The [[Khunjerab Pass]] is the only modern day border crossing between China and Pakistan, accessed via the [[Karakorum Highway]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite |url= http://caravanistan.com:80/border-crossings/pakistan|title=Caravanistan - Pakistan border crossings |access-date=24 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically the [[Mintaka Pass]] and [[Kilik Pass]] have also been used; however those crossings do not have vehicle access and are closed.

The '''Clock Tower of [[Ulcinj]]''' ({{sq|Sahat Kulla}}, [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]]: ''Saat Kulesi''), was built in [[Ulcinj]], [[Montenegro]] in 1754 during the [[Ottoman Empire]] rule over the city, with the help of donations made by the citizens of [[Ulcinj]]. The name comes from the [[Turkish (language)|Turkish]] ''Saat Kulesi'' which literally means "Clock Tower" in English. The main purposes of the tower were calling people to their jobs, reminding them of their duties and making them aware of the time. Its location was carefully chosen, as it can be seen or its clock heard from every part of the town. It has a rectangular base, and it was made of a nicely irregular cut stone. The Sahat Kulla is located near the [[Namazgjahu Mosque]] and [[Kryepazari Mosque]].
For a long time there used to be a man in [[Ulcinj]] whose title was ''muvekit'', and his duty was to take care of the correctness of the clock on the Tower.

Criticism of globalization is skepticism of the claimed benefits of [[globalization]]. Many of these views are held by the [[anti-globalization movement]]. Globalization has created much global and internal unrest in many countries. While the dynamics of capitalism is changing and each country is unique in its political makeup, globalization is a set-in-stone "program" that is difficult to implement without political unrest. Globalization can be partly responsible for the current global economic crisis. Case studies of Thailand and the Arab nations' view of globalization show that globalization is a threat to culture and religion, and it harms indigenous people groups while multinational corporations profit from it. Although globalization has promised an improved standard of living and economic development, it has been heavily criticized for its production of negative effects. Globalization is not simply an economic project, but it also heavily influences the country environmentally, politically, and socially as well.

== Economic impacts ==

=== Limitations on growth ===
The founder of Local Futures (formerly the [[International Society for Ecology and Culture]]), [[Helena Norberg-Hodge]], has suggested that globalization does not work for all the economies that it affects and that it does not always deliver the [[economic growth]] that is expected of it.

Globalization has been described as an "uneven process" in Africa due to the global integration of some groups happening alongside the marginalization or exclusion of others. Therefore, the worldwide trade will have the restrictions on the growth of economy.

=== Global Economic Crisis ===
The [[Financial crisis of 2007–2008|Global Economic Crisis]], the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression, can be partially attributed to neoliberal globalization. Although globalization promised an improved standard of living, it has actually worsened the financial situation of many homes and has made the financial crisis global through the influences of international financial institutions such as the World Bank. Globalization limits development and civilization to a path that only leads to a Western and capitalistic system. Because of the political and structural differences in countries, the implementation of globalization has been detrimental for many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/socialsciences/docview/347845517/9BB999FBD07F4417PQ/5?accountid=14496|title=Interrupting Inevitability: Globalization and Resistance|last=Skonieczny|first=A.|date=2010|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political impacts ==

=== Globalization as American hegemony ===
John Gray described globalization as a post-Cold War American triumphalism, and stated “global laissez faire is an American project.” Globalization is a project in which American ideals and values are executed and implemented into other countries. However, this effort has been criticized, mainly by the examination of America today. In America, there are high levels of economic and social inequalities as the gap between the rich and poor are great. Furthermore, America has the highest rates of incarceration, and anxiety due to economic uncertainty is great. The criticism that follows is that the implementation of the American system into other countries may reproduce these negative effects.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/socialsciences/docview/232589518/9BB999FBD07F4417PQ/10?accountid=14496|title=Globalization – facing the inevitable?|last=Baruah|first=S.|date=2000|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Power of transnational corporations ===
Globalization has fueled the rise of [[transnational corporation]]s, and their power has vaulted to the point where they can now rival many nation states. Of the world's one hundred largest economies, forty-two of them are corporations.[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed]]''] Many of these transnational corporations now hold sway over many nation states, as their fates are intertwined with the nations that they are located in.

Also, transnational corporations could offer massive influence regarding the [[Third World]], and bring about more pressure to help increase worker salaries and working conditions in sweatshops. However, these corporations are often transnational specifically to take advantage of different labor laws, which they can keep implemented with their influence and exploit for their gain. On account of doing the business globally, transnational corporations have the huge influence in many nation states.

In the process of implementing globalization in developing countries, the creation of winners and losers are often predetermined. Multinational corporations often benefit from globalization while poor, indigenous locals are negatively affected. The power of transnational companies inflicts a major threat for indigenous tribes. Transnational companies have exploited local family land for their businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osland|first=Joyces|date=June 2003|title=The Pros and Cons of Globalization|url=|journal=Journal of Management Inquiry|volume=12|pages=137–154|via=Maynooth university library}}&lt;/ref&gt; Globalization can be seen as a new form of colonization or imperialism, as economic inequality and the rise in unemployment have followed with its implementation. Globalization has been criticized for benefiting those who are already large and in power at the risk and growing vulnerability of the countries’ indigenous population. Furthermore, globalization is non-democratic, as it is enforced through top-down methods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/socialsciences/docview/231910154/9BB999FBD07F4417PQ/19?accountid=14496|title=The world bank and crimes of globalization|last=Friedrichs|first=|date=2002|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sovereignty ===
Globalization requires a country to give up its sovereignty for the sake of executing Western ideals in its country. As a result, sovereignty only belongs to a select few: those whose views and ideals are being implemented. In the name of free markets and with the promise of an improved standard of living, countries give up their political and social powers to international organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Thus, globalization causes the greater empowerment of these international organizations and the diminishing influence of local state institutions.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/socialsciences/docview/213144638/9BB999FBD07F4417PQ/2?accountid=14496|title=Contextualizing Globalization: Comments on Du Boff and Herman|last=Tabb|first=W. K.|date=1997|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Environmental impacts ==

=== Damage from transnational corporations ===
International trade in petroleum products has expanded significantly over the past decades through globalization so that the [[environmental issues in Nigeria|environmental problems in Nigeria]] have been deteriorated. As the international trade in petroleum products keeps increasing, there is also corresponding increase in activities in the petroleum industry to meet the requirement of the ever increasing demand for petroleum products. As a result, it gives rise to the environmental pollution. The petroleum is toxic to almost all forms of life and its extraction fuels climate change including [[air pollution]], [[water pollution]], [[noise pollution]], [[land degradation]] and [[erosion]].

=== Infectious diseases ===
Infection is the invasion of an organism's body tissues by disease-causing agents, their multiplication, and the reaction of host tissues to these organisms and the toxins they produce. Infectious diseases, also known as transmissible diseases or communicable diseases, kill more people worldwide than any other single cause. Infectious diseases are caused by germs, such as bacteria, viruses, parasites or fungi. Germs are tiny living things that are found everywhere in air, soil and water. One can get infected by touching, eating, drinking or breathing something that contains germs. Infectious diseases, such as SARS and Ebola, have traveled across the world due to increased world trade and tourism.

=== Invasive organisms ===
As International commerce develops new trade routes, markets and products Globalization facilitates the spread of [[invasive species]]. The modern technology offer the opportunity that human and commodities can move around the world. On account of the development of new source, larger and faster ships and increased air transport, the commercial trade propels rising annual and cumulative rates of invasion.

=== Case study of Thailand’s Pak Mun River ===
In the late 1970s and 1980s, [[hydropower]] dam projects were conducted in order to recreate Thailand’s economy into an export-oriented economy. The projects were funded by loans from the World Bank and was part of globalization efforts. The local villagers whom the project would directly affect were not notified, and the World Bank disregarded their concerns. As a result of the building of the dams, villages that heavily depended on the river lost their livelihood and their means of economic gains (i.e., fishing). The projects contaminated the river, which made the river unfit for villagers to drink, bathe, and do laundry without experiencing negative health conditions such as rashes. Furthermore, the projects resulted in the extinction of 40 edible plant species, 45 mushroom species, and 10 bamboo species, all of which the income of the local markets were dependent on, some of which were important for medical usage. Furthermore, the decline in fish population exterminated fishermen’s ways of life, as 169 different fish species were affected and 56 species became extinct. The globalization efforts in Thailand resulted in environmental impacts that affected the social and economic welfare of indigenous populations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Agriculture ===
With the centralization of agriculture throughout the world, food must go exceptionally long distances to reach consumers. As a result, transportation of goods increases, an industry which is a major contributor to global greenhouse gas emissions.[''[[wikipedia:Citation needed|citation/facts needed]]'']

== Social impacts ==

=== Growing inequality ===
The [[Governor of the Bank of England]], [[Mark Carney]], put forward globalization as a factor of an increase in the inequality of outcomes in societies.

Globalization has been one of the main causes of the increase in inequality in many countries in the [[Organization of Economic Cooperation and Development]]. These countries, including the United States, Canada, and Argentina, have faced [[Great Divergence (inequality)|an increase in inequality]] by between one-half to one-third between the 1970s and the late 1990s.

=== Loss of languages ===
Acceleration in [[language death]] has been attributed to globalization, and is predicted to continue. &lt;ref&gt;Reference Needed&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prejudice ===
Professor [[Conor Gearty]], of the [[London School of Economics]], has suggested that global [[freedom of movement]], brought on by globalization, has increased the scope for prejudice within societies. &lt;ref&gt;Reference Needed&lt;/ref&gt;

== Psychological impacts ==

=== Identity ===
The collision between global and local cultures have created challenges in adapting to and reconciling the two. Globalization and the introduction of the Western culture in different countries have shown to produce bicultural identities, identity confusion, and self-selected cultures.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/socialsciences/docview/614375322/9BB999FBD07F4417PQ/11?accountid=14496|title=The psychology of globalization|last=Arnett|first=J. J.|date=2002|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bicultural identity]] is defined as one adapting to the global culture while simultaneously being familiar with local traditions. As a result, two identities are formed: global identity and local identity. One’s global identity allows for him/her to participate and succeed globally by being able to relate to those outside of his/her local sphere. One’s local identity allows him/her to still be relevant to family and friends nearby. Often, those experiencing globalization in their country are seen to develop a ''hybrid identity'', an identity in which merges their global and local identities. This can also be seen with immigrants.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

However, adapting to both cultures may be difficult, especially if the distance between the two cultures is great. In these cases, globalization may cause identity confusion, preventing the proper development of identity and self [[Erikson's stages of psychosocial development|(Erikson’s theory of identity formation)]]. Similarly, globalization may create a crisis in which John Berry calls “[[Social exclusion|marginalization]],” in which one is unable to identify with local culture due to the heavy exposure of globalization and Western influences; however he/she is also excluded from the global culture as well.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The implementation of globalization requires a certain degree of culture shedding, as global culture alters and disrupts the preexisting local culture. This also leads to identity confusion, primarily in adolescents.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Cultural impacts ==
{{Globalize |date=November 2016}}

=== Urban and adolescent issues ===
Many times, in countries where globalization is introduced, problems that arise among adolescents are often blamed to the intrusion of [[Western culture]] and ideals through globalization. Adolescents are most vulnerable and receptive to the introduction of new cultures. [[Developing country|Developing countries]] where Western values and technology have been introduced are more aware of current events taking place in other countries, and adolescents and youths can be seen copying [[Fashion in the United States|American fashion]] and [[Music of the United States|music styles]]. Therefore, [[Western media]] is blamed for the rise in [[premarital sex]] and [[Teenage pregnancy|teenage pregnancies]] that follow when globalization is introduced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Globalization claims to have improved countries’ global status. However, companies attempting to compete globally have exploited workers, and global competition has been achieved through poor working conditions. Furthermore, due to global influences, [[Juvenile delinquency|juvenile crimes]] have increased because of the disruption of traditional [[Norm (social)|norms]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Arab and Muslim countries ===
The Arab and Islamic countries see globalization as an attempt to instill Western superiority and a threat to the preservation of their cultural identity. Although differing views of globalization exist among Arab nations, a large percentage of Muslims see it to be [[Imperialism|imperialistic]] and a cultural invasion that attempts to destroy their heritage and cultural beliefs.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/socialsciences/docview/203690756/9BB999FBD07F4417PQ/20?accountid=14496|title=The Arabs, Islam and Globalization|last=Najjar|first=F.|date=2005|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the differing opinions of globalization, almost all acknowledge and believe that globalization is simply [[Americanism (ideology)|Americanism]]— the implementation of American cultures and ideals into other countries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Globalization is especially threatening to Arab nations because Islam is not simply a religious practice, but it dominates laws and social norms such as marriages and spending habits. Since globalization is seen to be a way of [[Secularization|secularizing]] a nation, Muslims also see it as a cultural and religious invasion, requiring the separation of religion and daily life. Radicalists see it as a perversion of pure Islamic doctrine, as globalization is seen to merge the domain of Islam ([[Divisions of the world in Islam#Dar al-Islam .28House of Islam.29|Dar al-Islam]]) and the domain of infidelity ([[Dar al-Kufr|Dar-al-Kufr]]).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The Western influence on media is also unwelcome. The Western control of media is viewed as a way to brainwash young Muslims to strip them of their nationality and cultural heritage. They also oppose the creation of a new, global, hegemonic culture, referencing the [[Quran]] (49:13) which states that God has purposefully divided mankind into different nations and tribes. Arab intellectuals have stated that globalization rids the earth of human cultural diversity and civilizations’ peculiarities, which many see as barbaric. Authors and publishers have expressed fear of Western ideals penetrating their nations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

[[File:Eggenberg Coa.jpg|thumb|Coat of arms of Johann Anton von Eggenberg (1610–1649) as Duke of Krumlov]]
The '''Duchy of Krumlov''' (''Krumau'' in German) was a titular [[duchy]] in the southern part of the [[Kingdom of Bohemia]], comprising the town of [[Český Krumlov]] and its surrounding territories, now in the [[Czech Republic]].

In 1628, it was given to [[Hans Ulrich von Eggenberg]] by [[Ferdinand II, Holy Roman Emperor|King Ferdinand II]] when he bestowed upon Hans Ulrich the title of Duke of Krumlov. The Bohemian possessions of the Eggenbergs later went to Hans Ulrich's son, Johann Anton von Eggenberg (1610–1649).

In 1649, the title passed to Johann Anton's son, Johann Christian von Eggenberg. He married Marie Ernestine of Schwarzenberg, who was a member of the noble [[House of Schwarzenberg]]. Upon the death of Johann Christian, the male line of the [[House of Eggenberg]] came to an end. 

The death of Marie Ernestine in 1719 caused the Bohemian possessions of the Eggenbergs to pass to her closest relatives in the Schwarzenberg family. As a result, the Duchy of Krumlov was obtained by Prince Adam Francis Charles of Schwarzenberg in 1723, and the title of Duke of Krumlov is reserved for the head of the House of Schwarzenberg.

The '''flag of the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea]]''' was a historical flag of Cambodia from 1979 to 1993, used during the [[Cambodian–Vietnamese War]].

The flag that became the official flag of the People's Republic of Kampuchea had been previously adopted by the [[Kampuchean United Front for National Salvation]] (KUFNS), who had revived the flag of the [[Khmer Issarak]] in the days of anti-French resistance, declaring it the flag of the PRK.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Slocomb, ''The People's Republic of Kampuchea, 1979-1989: The revolution after Pol Pot'' {{ISBN|978-974-9575-34-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==State of Cambodia==
In 1989, [[Hun Sen]] renamed the country as the [[People's Republic of Kampuchea#Transition: State of Cambodia (1989 - 1993)|State of Cambodia]] and changed the flag: instead of just fully red, it was half red above and half blue below, reviving the blue color of preceding [[Cambodian flags]]. It had a yellow five-towered [[Angkor Wat]] silhouette in the center like the first. In some versions the Angkor Wat of the State of Cambodia flag displayed the architectural details of the Angkorian structure outlined in black.

Although the flags of the People's Republic of Kampuchea, and later the flag of the State of Cambodia, became the official flags within Cambodia after the ousting of the [[Khmer Rouge]] government of Democratic Kampuchea, the [[flag of Democratic Kampuchea]] would still be used by the [[Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea]] and in the [[United Nations]]. As the PRK failed to gain widespread international recognition most states kept diplomatic ties with the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Vickery, ''Cambodia 1975-1982'', Silkworm Books 2000, {{ISBN|978-974-7100-81-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Symbolism ==
Red symbolizes blood and [[revolution]]. The five-towered Angkor Wat silhouette refers to the unity of [[soldiers]], [[merchant|traders]], [[workers]], [[peasants]] and [[intellectuals]] of [[Kampuchea]].

'''Gibraltar Limestone''' consists of greyish-white or pale-gray compact, and sometime finely crystalline, medium to thick bedded limestones and [[dolomite]]s that locally contain chert seams. This [[Formation (stratigraphy)|formation]] comprises about three quarters of the [[Rock of Gibraltar]] near the southernmost tip of the [[Iberian peninsula]]. Geologists have found various poorly preserved and badly eroded and rolled [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] [[fossil]]s within it. The fossils found in the Gibraltar Limestone include various [[brachiopod]]s, [[coral]]s, echinoid fragments, [[gastropod]]s, [[pelecypod]]s, and [[stromatolite]]s. These fossils indicate an Early Jurassic age (Lower Lias) for the deposition of the Gibraltar Limestone.&lt;ref&gt;Rose, E. P. F., and M. S. Rosenbaum (1991). ''A Field Guide to the Geology of Gibraltar''. Gibraltar: The Gibraltar Museum. p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kalabari''' are a tribe of the [[Ijaw people]] living in the western [[Niger Delta]] region of [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/sokari/kalabari.html|title=Spirits in Steel: The Kalabari|publisher=[[American Museum of Natural History]]|accessdate=2009-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, they were known as the Awome. The name Kalabari was derived from their ancestor Perebo Kalabari who was a son of Mein Owei. Their original settlement was spelt as Calabar by the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] which was pronounced Kalabari. This settlement (town) was abandoned as the people moved to other fishing settlements. Portuguese settlers continued to maintain the name Calabari which became surrounded by Efik people of Duke town. When the British came the word Calabari was pronounced as Calabar (Kalaba) instead of Kalabari. At this time the original Ijoid Kalabaris had moved to a new location which became the new Calabar territory since the old Calabar is occupied by different people. Old Calabar became an Efik town with time which has the name Calabar.

[[Elem Kalabari]] (New Calabar) became a large kingdom that has about 35 settlements including Bakana, Abonnema, Buguma, Tombia and others.&lt;ref&gt;G. I. Jones. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G_Q0IBdHSP8C&amp;pg=PR21&amp;lpg=PR21&amp;dq=niger+delta+trading+states+jones&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=WmuvNvdVZ3&amp;sig=5uZR8Li85lMnFvw_Mwi4LgWQYlI&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=4BumSaiqJaDOMqSw2b8K&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ct=result The trading states of the oil rivers: a study of political development in Eastern Nigeria]''. LIT Verlag Berlin-Hamburg-Münster, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Kalabari people are [[Ijaw languages|Ijaw speaking]] settlers who came from the [[Bini people|Bini]] fringes of Ijaw land from the lineage of a man called Mein Owei. The people were originally fishermen before the coming of the Portuguese to the West African coastline.

The Kalabari, like most Nigerian coastline tribes, were wealthy as a result of their interactions with the Europeans. There are some Ijaw who consider the Kalabari as a different ethnic group and vice versa.

The '''Lithuanian Red''' ({{lang-lt|Lietuvos žalieji}}) is a breed of cattle that was formed by crossing [[Danish Red cattle]] with the local [[Lithuania]]n cattle. In 1951 the cross was recognized as a new breed. It currently accounts for about 33% of the entire cattle population in Lithuania.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zum.lt/agroweb/cattlered.htm Cattle:            Lithuanian           Red - Lithuanian       Agricultural Library]&lt;/ref&gt; The young stock of the Lithuanian Red breed are noted for their rapid growth rate, good food conversion and high carcass quality. When intensively fattened, [[Cattle#Terminology|steer]]s weigh roughly 413 kilograms (911 pounds) as yearlings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ansi.okstate.edu/breeds/cattle/lithuanianred/index.htm  Lithuanian Red - Oklahoma State University]&lt;/ref&gt;  Management is performed by the Lithuanian Red Cattle Improvement Association according to the National Red Cattle Improvement Selection Program. The Lithuanian Red Herd book was established in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miceikiene|first1=Ilona|title=Lithuanian Red|url=http://www.nordgen.org/husdyrdb/visrase.php?id=11&amp;langid=1|website=Nordic Baltic Farm Animal Database|accessdate=October 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Maltese passport''' ({{lang-mt|passaport Malti}}) is a [[passport]] that is issued to citizens of [[Malta]]. Every Maltese citizen is also a [[Citizenship of the European Union|citizen of the European Union]]. The [[passport]], along with the [[Maltese identity card|national identity card]] allows for free rights of movement and residence in any of the states of the [[European Economic Area]], as well as [[Switzerland]].

==Physical appearance==
Maltese passports share the common design standards of [[Passports of the European Union|European Union passports]]. The cover is burgundy with the [[coat of arms of Malta]] emblazoned in the centre. The words "UNJONI EWROPEA" (English: European Union) and "MALTA" are inscribed above the coat of arms, with "PASSAPORT" (English: Passport) and the international [[biometric passport]] symbol below.

== Investment-based citizenship scheme ==
In January 2014 Malta started granting citizenship for a €650,000 contribution plus investments, contingent on residence and criminal background requirements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-03-11/passport-king-christian-kalin-helps-nations-sell-citizenship|title=Passport King Christian Kalin Helps Nations Sell Citizenship – Bloomberg Business|author=Clenfield, Jason |date=11 March 2015|work=Bloomberg.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; under the so-called "Individual Investor Programme"&lt;ref&gt;[http://iip.gov.mt/ Individual Investor Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Henley &amp; Partners]] was originally appointed as sole agent for the sale of Maltese passport, but the [[Maltese government|Muscat government]] later opened the scheme to Maltese firms too. The procedure is managed formally by the governmental agency [[Identity Malta]].&lt;ref name=ToM&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171006/local/passport-buyers-origins-to-remain-a-secret.659705 Times of Malta]&lt;/ref&gt;
The number and background of persons granted Maltese citizenship based on investment is unknown, as the Maltese government does not publish such data. Malta's Data Protection Commissioner confirmed that the publication of the number of passport buyers and their country of origin “may prejudice relations with a number of the countries of origin” and that revealing the agencies that handled their application “could reasonably be expected to prejudice commercial interests and, ultimately, the competitiveness of approved agents as it would reveal commercially-sensitive information”.&lt;ref name=ToM/&gt;
The list of persons who were naturalised Maltese in the year 2015&lt;ref&gt;[https://gov.mt/en/Government/Government%20Gazette/Government%20Notices/Documents/naturalised%20persons.pdf list of persons who were naturalised Maltese in the year 2015]&lt;/ref&gt; includes over 900 names (listed by first name) without indication of previous/second citizenships and of reasons for naturalisation.  This was criticised as not transparent enough.&lt;ref name=politico&gt;[https://www.politico.eu/article/malta-cash-for-passports-program-individual-investor-programme/ Politico Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the names are typical Arab, Russian, and Chinese names. 
Most "investors" are understood to be interested in acquiring Maltese citizenship only as a tool to exploit EU citizenship rights and reside elsewhere in the Union, including the UK. &lt;ref name=politico/&gt; The [[European Parliament]] had objected to the programme as a sell-out of [[EU citizenship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/news/en/press-room/20140110IPR32392/eu-citizenship-should-not-be-for-sale-at-any-price-says-european-parliament European Parliament]&lt;/ref&gt;
The income from Malta's passport sale amounted to €163.5 million in 2016. Of this, 70% is deposited in the so-called National Development and Social Fund (NDSF), which was set up in July 2016. The use of the fund by the government is not regulated.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20171106/opinion/Passports-without-a-soul-Michael-Briguglio.662386 Times of Malta, 6 November 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

Visa requirements for Maltese citizens are administrative entry restrictions by the authorities of other states placed on citizens of Malta. As of 20 October 2018, Maltese citizens had visa-free or visa on arrival access to 183 countries and territories, ranking the Maltese passport 7th in the world (tied with Australian and Greek passports) according to the [[Henley Passport Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Ranking - Passport Index 2018|url=https://www.henleyglobal.com/files/download/HPI2018/PI%202018%20INFOGRAPHS%20GLOBAL%20180518.pdf|publisher=Henley &amp; Partners|accessdate=22 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Arton Capital's Passport Index ranked the Maltese passport 5th in the world in terms of travel freedom, with a visa-free score of 161 (tied with Australian, Icelandic, Malaysian, and New Zealand passports), as of 20 October 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.passportindex.org/byRank.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltese citizens can live and work in any country within the [[European Economic Area]] (consisting of the states of the European Union and the [[European Free Trade Association]]) as a result of the right of free movement and residence granted in Article 21 of the [[Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF|format=PDF|title=Treaty on the Function of the European Union (consolidated version)|publisher=Eur-lex.europa.eu|accessdate=2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mao Renfeng''' ({{zh|t=毛人鳳|w='''Mao Jen-feng'''}}; 5 January 1898 – 11 December 1956) was a Republic of China general and [[spymaster]] who headed the [[Bureau of Investigation and Statistics]] (also known as the Counterintelligence Bureau and after 1955 the Intelligence Bureau) from 1946 until his death, succeeding his childhood friend [[Dai Li]] who died in a plane crash in 1946. Between 1946 and 1949, his spy agency played a prominent role in the [[Chinese Civil War]]. In 1949 he along with the rest of the [[Nationalist government]] fled to [[Taiwan]] where he died 7 years later.

His son Robert Yu-Lang Mao is currently the chairman of [[Hewlett-Packard]] China.&lt;ref name="nextmedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/international/art/20130828/18397670|title=共產黨仇敵毛人鳳之子 毛渝南任惠普中國董事長 &amp;#124; 蘋果日報 &amp;#124; 兩岸國際 &amp;#124; 20130828|website=hk.apple.nextmedia.com|accessdate=2017-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{update|date=November 2010}}

As recently as the early 1980s, the '''[[Comoros]] had no national media'''. State-run Radio Comoros, transmitting from [[Ngazidja]], was not strong enough to send clear signals to the republic's other two islands.

In 1984 France agreed to provide Radio Comoros with funding for an FM (frequency modulation) transmitter strong enough to broadcast to all three islands, and in 1985 made a commitment to fund a national newspaper after a United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization ([[UNESCO]]) study revealed that the Comoros was the only UN member lacking print and electronic media. A state-owned newspaper, [[Al-Watwan]], began operations in July 1985, first as a monthly and soon afterward as a weekly. There are now a number of publications, either daily, such as La Gazette des Comores, or weekly, such as L'Archipel, an independent weekly which began publishing in 1988 and now appears intermittently. Al Balad, a daily published by CGH, is now defunct. 

A news agency, Agence Comores Presse, is based in Moroni.

In addition to national broadcasts on FM in Comorian, Swahili and French, Radio Comoros in 1993 broadcast internationally on the shortwave band in Swahili, Arabic, and French, but shortwave services have now been suspended. There are a number independent commercial FM radio stations in the country, [[Radio Tropique FM]], one of the first, began broadcasting in 1991, although it and its director, political activist [[Ali Bakar Cassim]], have occasionally been the object of government ire.

The ORTC (Office de Radio et Télévision des Comores), whose studios were funded by the Chinese government, now broadcasts both radio and television both free to air nationally and by cable and satellite in France.

In 1989 the Comoros had an estimated 61,000 radios and 200 television sets.

==Freedom of Speech==
Representatives of the independent media have occasionally been rounded up along with other critics of the government during the republic's recurrent bouts of political crisis. However, freedom of speech is generally respected and outlets such as Radio Tropique FM and [[L'Archipel]], which is noted for its satirical column, "Winking Eye", continue to provide independent political commentary.

'''Pecotox Air''' is an [[airline]] based in [[Chişinău]], [[Moldova]]. It started operations in November 2001 and operated charter services.
