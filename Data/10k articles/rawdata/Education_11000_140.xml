[[File:2018 UK higher education strike placards .jpg|thumb|2018 UK higher education strike placards]]

The [[University and College Union]] (UCU), a trade union representing 110,000 staff at UK universities,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/1685/About-UCU|title=About UCU|website=www.ucu.org.uk|language=en-gb|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; began a strike on 22 February 2018 as part of an [[industrial action]] against 64 universities, represented by [[Universities UK]] (UUK). The dispute concerned proposed changes to the [[Universities Superannuation Scheme]] (USS).&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9242/UCU-announces-14-strike-dates-at-61-universities-in-pensions-row |title=UCU announces 14 strike dates at 61 universities in pensions row |website=www.ucu.org.uk |language=en-gb|access-date=12 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305150446/https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9242/UCU-announces-14-strike-dates-at-61-universities-in-pensions-row |archivedate=5 March 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first wave of strike action escalated over fourteen strike days between 22 February to 20 March, and took place at sixty-four universities across the UK.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43140729 |title=University strike: What's it all about? |last=Burns |first=Judith |date=21 February 2018 |work=BBC News|access-date=12 March 2018 |language=en-GB |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227005517/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43140729 |archivedate=27 February 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was the longest-ever strike in UK higher-education history.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.wired.co.uk/ |title=WIRED UK - Future Science, Culture &amp; Technology News and Reviews |website=www.wired.co.uk|access-date=20 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226094835/http://www.wired.co.uk/ |archivedate=26 February 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimated 42,000 staff&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; went on strike with 575,000 teaching hours being lost.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/pensions-strike-forces-uk-universities-reset-examinations|title=Pensions strike forces UK universities to reset examinations|date=2018-03-28|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 28 March, over 700 external examiners had also recorded their resignations in a UCU document.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/university-strikes-pensions-dispute-lecturers-students-ucu-college-union-uuk-a8278486.html|title=New university strike dates announced|date=2018-03-28|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-03-28|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 28 March 2018, more than a million students were estimated to have been affected,&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; with 126,000 students signing petitions calling for fee refunds.&lt;ref name=":101"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334|title=University talks resume after Twitter row|last=Burns|first=Judith|date=6 March 2018|work=BBC News|language=en-GB|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312192658/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334|archivedate=12 March 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=12 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students also occupied campus buildings in support of striking staff at more than a dozen universities.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334|title=University strike talks resume after Twitter skirmishes|last=Burns|first=Judith|date=6 March 2018|work=BBC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305225924/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334|archivedate=5 March 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=6 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The action has been called "something of a milestone" for "impending service sector strikes of the 21st century".&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Thomas Hale, '[https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/02/22/2198956/the-strange-economics-of-the-university-strikes/ The strange economics of the university strikes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309054440/https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/02/22/2198956/the-strange-economics-of-the-university-strikes/|date=9 March 2018}}', ''Financial Times'' (22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Times (newspaper)|The Times]]'' described the strikes as "the worst industrial action at universities in modern times".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/university-lecturers-to-strike-as-students-sit-summer-exams-2jmmxlsbx |title=University lecturers to strike as students sit summer exams |last=Correspondent |first=Nicola Woolcock, Education CorrespondentNicola Woolcock, Education |date=9 March 2018 |work=The Times|access-date=12 March 2018 |language=en |issn=0140-0460}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background to the strike==
[[File:Non-staff costs as a proportion of universities' total expenditure UK average 2006-15, according to Higher Education Statistics Agency.svg|thumb|Non-staff costs as a proportion of universities' total expenditure: UK average 2006-15, rising from around 42% to around 45%, according to the [[Higher Education Statistics Agency]].]]

Over the period, total spending per student rises by around £2000; vice-chancellors' remuneration rises by £21873; professors' pay falls by £7544; and average pay across all academic staff falls by £4304.]]
The United Kingdom has 130 universities.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Staff at 68 universities founded before 1992 are members of the USS pension scheme.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; (Most academic staff at institutions which became universities ''after'' 1992 are members of the Teachers' Pension Scheme, which is unaffected by this dispute.)&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In January 2018, UCU members at 61 universities (initially) balloted in favour of action over the proposed pension changes.&lt;ref name="auto8" /&gt;

As reporting, both in the UK and abroad, noted, the strikes took place in the context of other tensions over higher education and pension provision in the UK, as follows.&lt;ref name="auto2"&gt;'[https://www.ft.com/content/4671a4c0-163d-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44 Striking dons add to UK students’ resentments] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225072257/https://www.ft.com/content/4671a4c0-163d-11e8-9376-4a6390addb44 |date=25 February 2018 }}', ''The Financial Times'' (20 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Adams, '[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/16/theresa-may-details-tuition-fee-overhaul Theresa May to reveal details of tuition fee overhaul on Monday] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227001156/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/16/theresa-may-details-tuition-fee-overhaul |date=27 February 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'' (16 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Borger, '[www.fr.de/wissen/grossbritannien-professoren-wollen-universitaeten-lahmlegen-a-1452510 Professoren wollen Universitäten lahmlegen]', ''Frankfurther Rundschau'', 74.44 (21 February 2018), p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Zylbersztajn, '[http://www.taz.de/Professoren-Streik-in-Grossbritannien/!5484269/ Stillstand an den Unis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180222211945/http://taz.de/Professoren-Streik-in-Grossbritannien/!5484269/ |date=22 February 2018 }}', ''Taz'' (22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Steven Parfitt, '[https://jacobinmag.com/2018/02/britain-university-strike-pensions Lecturers on Strike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312173520/https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/02/britain-university-strike-pensions |date=12 March 2018 }}', ''Jacobin'' (21 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

===National UK higher education policy===

* Debates about [[Tuition fees in the United Kingdom|tuition fee]] levels and the mechanisms for paying them. In particular, on 19 February, the UK Prime Minister [[Theresa May]] had announced an official review of UK higher education funding.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Coughlan, '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43106736 Theresa May's university review will not scrap fees] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226002838/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43106736 |date=26 February 2018 }}', BBC News (19 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The increasingly corporate and privatised character of higher education institutions. For example, universities, whose capital expenditure had traditionally been funded to a significant extent by government funding, were increasingly participating in private capital markets, with new levels of concern for their credit ratings and with uncertain consequences for their finances and governance.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hale, '[https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/03/06/2199103/universities-and-the-allure-of-capital-markets/ Universities and the allure of capital markets] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307090725/https://ftalphaville.ft.com/2018/03/06/2199103/universities-and-the-allure-of-capital-markets/ |date=7 March 2018 }}', ''Financial Times'' (6 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
* The creation of the [[Office for Students]] on 1 January 2018, whose powers came into force 1 April 2018. For example, on 28 February 2018, the OFS said that "universities that fail to mitigate the impact of the strikes would open themselves up to regulatory intervention".&lt;ref&gt;Harry Yorke, 'Universities told they face fines if strikes harm students', ''The Daily Telegraph'' (27 February 2018), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pensions===
====The USS pension scheme====

The USS scheme was created in 1974 to provide sector-wide pensions for UK university staff (focusing on academic staff).&lt;ref name="Logan1985"&gt;Douglas Logan, ''The Birth of a Pension Scheme. A History of the Universities Superannuation Scheme'' (Liverpool University Press 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; Its terms changed little until 2011, when major reforms were implemented, followed by further changes in 2014-15.&lt;ref name="Platanakis2015"&gt;Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Asset–Liability Modelling and Pension Schemes: The Application of Robust Optimization to USS', ''The European Journal of Finance'' (2015), 1-29, [[Digital object identifier|doi]]:[https://doi.org/10.1080%2F1351847X.2015.1071714 10.1080/1351847X.2015.1071714].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Platanakis2018"&gt;Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Pension Schemes, Taxation and Stakeholder Wealth: The USS Rule Changes', ICMA Centre, Discussion Paper Number: ICM-2017-08 (23 January 2018): https://ssrn.com/abstract=3039364; {{DOI|10.2139/ssrn.3039364}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TimesGrove2015"&gt;Jack Grove, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/new-uss-pension-reform-plans-to-be-put-to-union-vote/2017987.article New USS Pension Reform Plans to be Put to Union Vote] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215143632/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/new-uss-pension-reform-plans-to-be-put-to-union-vote/2017987.article |date=15 February 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (15 January 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; These changes left scheme members markedly worse off: one academic study concluded that the reduced wealth of post-2011 entrants was equivalent to an 11% drop in their total compensation or a 13% drop in their salaries.&lt;ref name="Platanakis2016"&gt;Emmanouil Platanakis and Charles Sutcliffe, 'Pension Scheme Redesign and Wealth Redistribution Between the Members and Sponsor: The USS Rule Change in October 2011', ''Insurance: Mathematics and Economics'', 69 (2016), 14–28. {{DOI|10.1016/j.insmatheco.2016.04.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|25}}

By 2017, the USS scheme had over 400,000 members.&lt;ref name="Economist2017"&gt;'[https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21725794-their-position-independent-institutions-funded-public-cash-awkward-one-universities Universities’ main pension pot faces the biggest deficit of any British fund] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180215204047/https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21725794-their-position-independent-institutions-funded-public-cash-awkward-one-universities |date=15 February 2018 }}', ''The Economist'' (3 August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wider UK pensions====

* The UK [[Pensions Act 2004]] had placed stringent requirements on private-sector pensions to ensure that their liabilities could be met even if all their member organisations collapsed at once—which in the context of USS would entail the whole University system going bust, an event deemed unlikely by many. Over 2006-17, the proportion of UK private-sector defined-benefit schemes open to new joiners declined from 43% to 14%.&lt;ref name="ucu.org.uk"&gt;'[https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/9556/Backing-for-defined-benefit-pension-scheme-bucks-trend-Financial-Times---27-Sep-2018/pdf/Backing_for_defined_benefit_pension_scheme_bucks_trend___Financial_Times.pdf Backing for defined benefit pension scheme bucks trend]', ''The Financial Times'' (5 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; In the analysis of [[Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury|Mervyn King]] and [[John Kay (economist)|John Kay]], 'The 2004 Pensions Act is a prime, but by no means unique, example of well-intentioned but inept financial regulation. Over-prescriptive, it has led to the demise of the defined benefit schemes that it was designed to protect. If proposed changes to the USS are implemented, there will be no defined benefit schemes of any significant size outside the public sector open to new members'.&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation.com"&gt;Mervyn King and John Kay, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/uss-crisis-can-pension-system-be-reformed USS crisis: can the pension system be reformed?]', ''Times Higher Education'' (6 September 2018), https://www.johnkay.com/2018/09/06/uss-crisis-can-the-pension-system-be-reformed/.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similar or even more dramatic proposed pension cuts for universities' non-academic staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/DB-Derisking/Southampton-uni-s-DB-closure-proposal-poorly-timed-experts-say?ct=true |title=Southampton uni's DB closure proposal poorly timed, experts say |last=Imeson |first=Sophia |date=16 January 2018 |work=Pensions Expert|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319085008/http://www.pensions-expert.com/DB-Derisking/Southampton-uni-s-DB-closure-proposal-poorly-timed-experts-say?ct=true|archive-date=19 March 2018|dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in January 2018, [[University of Southampton|Southampton University]] began consultations on closing its defined-benefits pension scheme for non-academic staff,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.professionalpensions.com/professional-pensions/news/3024438/southampton-uni-support-staff-face-two-thirds-pension-cut |title=Southampton Uni support staff 'face two-thirds pension cut' |last=Phillips |first=James |date=15 January 2018 |work=Professional Pensions|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180115162756/https://www.professionalpensions.com/professional-pensions/news/3024438/southampton-uni-support-staff-face-two-thirds-pension-cut|archive-date=15 January 2018|dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in March 2018, [[Staffordshire University]] began consultations on moving support staff from the defined-benefit local government scheme to a local defined-contribution scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/hundreds-university-staff-braced-pension-1329336 |title=Hundreds of university staff braced for pension changes |last=McInnes |first=Kathie |date=12 March 2018 |work=The Sentinel|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319213536/https://www.stokesentinel.co.uk/news/stoke-on-trent-news/hundreds-university-staff-braced-pension-1329336|archive-date=19 March 2018|dead-url=no |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Worsening outlooks for pension provision across the UK, in the context of rising remuneration for fund managers and increasing integration of pension funds into speculative financial markets.&lt;ref&gt;E.g. Christine Berry, '[https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/uss-tip-iceberg-pensions-system-hot-mess/ USS is the tip of the iceberg. Our pensions system is a hot mess] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316071735/https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/uss-tip-iceberg-pensions-system-hot-mess/ |date=16 March 2018 }}', ''OpenDemocracy'' (1 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; For example, it was noted that pay for USS's chief executive rose from £484,000 in 2017 to £566,000 in 2018, while two staff members earned over £1m, and running costs stood at £125m per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Sean Coughlan, '[www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43157711 University pension boss's £82,000 pay rise]', ''BBC News'' (22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pay and conditions===

* Public concern about rapidly rising pay for University senior management, particularly [[Vice-chancellor]]s.&lt;ref name="auto3"&gt;Phoebe Braithwaite, '[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/university-pensions-ucu-uss-academics-strike The university pensions strike is a last resort for STEM academics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180307043115/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/university-pensions-ucu-uss-academics-strike |date=7 March 2018 }}', ''Wired'' (23 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, on 26 February, the Channel 4 investigative journalism programme ''Dispatches'' broadcast an exposé of vice-chancellors' expenses claims.&lt;ref&gt;Jamie Doward, '[https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/24/vice-chancellors-expenses-scandal-channel-4-dispatches-universities Revealed: British university vice-chancellors’ five-star expenses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226114015/https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/feb/24/vice-chancellors-expenses-scandal-channel-4-dispatches-universities |date=26 February 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'' (24 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Concern among university staff about falling real-terms pay for most staff.&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; Moreover, the pay projections assumed in USS's 2017 valuation and used to argue for reducing pensions assumed an increase in general pay growth: rather than assuming pay would keep up with inflation (as measured by the [[consumer price index]]), USS assumed pay growth one percent above inflation (as measured, more generously, by the [[retail price index]]).&lt;ref&gt;D. Spiegelhalter and others, '[https://www.ft.com/content/810aa034-9c79-11e7-8cd4-932067fbf946 Examining the Numbers on Pension Valuation]', ''The Financial Times'' (19 September 2017); available at https://www.dannydorling.org/?p=6109 and http://www.dannydorling.org/wp-content/files/dannydorling_publication_id6103.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt; On 16 April 2018, staff were actually offered a payrise of 1.7%, below both CPI inflation (then 2.7%) and RPI (then 3.6%).&lt;ref&gt;Jack Grove, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-university-staff-offered-17-cent-pay-rise-2018-19 UK university staff offered 1.7 per cent pay rise for 2018-19]', ''Times Higher Education'' (16 April 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Growing numbers of academic staff were on [[Precarity|precarious]] short-term or zero-hours contracts – 54% in 2016 according to figures from UCU (disputed by employers).&lt;ref name="auto3"/&gt; In March, UCU argued on the basis of data from a [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|freedom of information]] request that an average of 27% UK university teaching hours were delivered by such staff.&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Inge, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-rely-casual-staff-half-teaching UK universities rely on casual staff ‘for up to half of teaching’] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321192832/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-universities-rely-casual-staff-half-teaching |date=21 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (6 March 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; The issue of casualisation became increasingly prominent in UCU members' understanding of the strikes as they developed.&lt;ref name="auto4"&gt;Sophie Inge, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/genie-out-bottle-casualisation-after-pension-strikes ‘Genie out of the bottle’ on casualisation after pension strikes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321192830/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/genie-out-bottle-casualisation-after-pension-strikes |date=21 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (21 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Casualisation of university staff more widely was also reflected in a strike by cleaners, porters, and receptionists seeking to get their work insourced at the [[University of London]], called during the first wave of UCU strikes for 25–26 April.&lt;ref&gt;Sanjana Varghese, '[https://londonstudent.coop/news/2018/03/16/cleaners-announce-biggest-ever-strike-for-outsourced-workers-in-higher-education/ Cleaners announce biggest ever strike for outsourced workers in Higher Education] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143304/https://londonstudent.coop/news/2018/03/16/cleaners-announce-biggest-ever-strike-for-outsourced-workers-in-higher-education/ |date=22 March 2018 }}', ''London Student'' (16 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;
* Similar concerns were reflected by strike action around the same time more widely in UK professional classes: junior doctors undertook [[Junior doctors contract dispute in England, 2015|their first strikes]] in the history of the [[National Health Service (England)]] in 2015-16, while barristers began strike action on 1 April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://economist.com/news/britain/21741202-barristers-lecturers-and-doctors-are-among-those-feeling-pinch-british-professionals-revolt British professionals revolt as austerity hits the middle class]', ''The Economist'' (26 April 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ballot concerning joint higher education trade union national pay claim====
Concern about pay and conditions, particularly in relation to high senior pay and expenditure on new buildings in the face of declining staff pay, the gender pay gap, precarious contracts and casualisation, and workloads were all expressed as part of the wider context of the pensions dispute, but also formed the basis of ballots for industrial action across all UK higher education unions: [[UNISON]], [[Unite the Union|Unite]], [[Educational Institute of Scotland|EIS]], [[GMB (trade union)|GMB]] and UCU. Citing long-term real-terms declining pay, the unions submitted a pay claim seeking a 7.5 per cent pay increase or £1,500, whichever was greater; a £10 minimum wage to make all higher education institutions "[[living wage]]" employers; and gender pay equality by 2020.&lt;ref name="HE_Pay_claim_submitted 2018"&gt;'[http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/9311/UCUBANHE29/pdf/HE_Pay_claim_submitted.pdf University and College Union Higher Education Branch Action Note]', UCUBAN/HE29 (21 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2018, the [[Universities and Colleges Employers Association]] proposed a 1.7% pay increase for 2018-19, raising the offer to 2% (and 2.8% for the lowest paid) in May. These figures were both below inflation, which in March 2018 stood at 2.7%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jack Grove, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-university-staff-offered-17-cent-pay-rise-2018-19 UK university staff offered 1.7 per cent pay rise for 2018-19]', ''Times Higher Education'' (16 April  2018 ).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellie Bothwell, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-university-staff-offered-2-cent-pay-rise UK university staff offered 2 per cent pay rise]', ''Times Higher Education'' (11 May 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The ballots commenced in September 2018, running alongside the ongoing pensions dispute.&lt;ref name="Anna McKie 2018"&gt;Anna McKie, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uk-university-staff-vote-strike-action-pay-dispute UK university staff to vote on strike action in pay dispute]', ''Times Higher Education'' (29 June 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Although the majority of Union members voting voted to take industrial action, however, the turnout only passed the 50% of members required by the [[Trade Union Act 2016]] at seven universities (alongside which three Northern Irish universities, unaffected by the legislation, also voted to strike).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;'[https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9724/Trade-union-laws-frustrate-national-support-for-strike-action-on-pay Trade union laws frustrate national support for strike action on pay]' (22 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Negotiations regarding pension proposals==

===Prior to industrial action===

In July 2017, USS reported a technical deficit (i.e. a gap between the fund's assets and its liabilities) of £17.5&amp;nbsp;billion, reported as the largest [[UK pensions#Underfunding|such shortfall]] in the UK at that time.&lt;ref name="Economist2017"/&gt; USS's deficit evaluation was based on suggestions that although the fund's [[assets]] had grown (reaching £60&amp;nbsp;billion, a one-fifth increase on the previous year), its [[Liability (financial accounting)|liabilities]] had also grown (reaching £78&amp;nbsp;billion, a one-third increase over the previous year).&lt;ref name="FT2017"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.ft.com/content/914d9cba-7232-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c |title=University pension fund deficit soars to £17.5bn |last=Gordon |first=Sarah |date=28 July 2017 |website=[[Financial Times]] |accessdate=29 July 2017 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170729214315/https://www.ft.com/content/914d9cba-7232-11e7-aca6-c6bd07df1a3c |archivedate=29 July 2017 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following negotiations regarding the calculation of the deficit, the USS Joint Negotiating Committee accepted a technical deficit of £6.1&amp;nbsp;billion in November 2017.

The key change proposed by UUK was to close USS's [[Defined benefit pension plan|defined benefit scheme]] (possibly temporarily), replacing it with a [[Defined contribution plan|defined contribution scheme]].&lt;ref name="auto5"&gt;Ben Chu, '[www.independent.co.uk/voices/university-lecturers-strike-economics-pensions-a8227421.html If you look at the economics, it's completely reasonable for university lecturers to strike over pension changes]', ''The Independent'' (25 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, the USS Joint Negotiating Committee therefore made the following proposals, to be introduced after 1 April 2019:&lt;ref&gt;'[https://web.archive.org/web/20180203011521/https://www.uss.co.uk/how-uss-is-run/valuation/2017-valuation-updates/proposed-changes-to-future-uss-benefits Proposed changes to future USS benefits]'.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Closing of the defined benefits section of the scheme (though mentioning the possibility of reintroducing it), with all future benefits (apart from death in service and ill health retirement benefits) being transferred to the defined contribution scheme.
* Contributions would remain 8% for members and 18% for employers (of which 13.25% contributes directly to pensions, the rest being used for management and running costs, etc.).
* Members would be enabled to pay only 4% while still receiving the usual employer contribution, while the option of paying an extra 1%, matched by the employer, would be removed.
* Members' 8% (or 4%) would include a contribution to partly finance death in service and ill health retirement benefits.
The closure of defined benefits was presented as a red line by UCU, which argued in favour of finding ways to sustain defined benefits, or to introduce a [[collective defined contribution scheme]]&lt;ref name="auto5"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christine Berry, '[https://www.opendemocracy.net/neweconomics/uss-tip-iceberg-pensions-system-hot-mess/ USS is the tip of the iceberg.

====Arguments for the changes====
USS argued that market conditions had simply proven less favourable than previous valuations had assumed, with the chief executive, Bill Galvin, arguing that 'the unavoidable fact is that market conditions have changed since 2014. Real interest rates have fallen since 2014, relative to inflation, and asset prices have soared ... We are now having to pay more – to get less in return – than we expected in the past'. Moreover, USS emphasised that its room for manoeuvre was constrained by [[the Pensions Regulator]].&lt;ref&gt;Bill Galvin, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-we-cant-ignore-reality-our-deficit-says-pensions-boss USS strike: we can’t ignore reality of our deficit, says pensions boss] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180322143304/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-we-cant-ignore-reality-our-deficit-says-pensions-boss |date=22 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (19 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, the deficit could have been resolved through higher contribution rates. However, UUK argued that defined benefit schemes were becoming prohibitively expensive.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/striking-lecturer-slow-death-public-education |title=Why I'm a striking lecturer: I want to stop the slow death of public education {{!}} Becky Gardiner|last=Gardiner|first=Becky|date=12 March 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=12 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312110529/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/12/striking-lecturer-slow-death-public-education|archivedate=12 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said they had a legal duty to put in place a credible plan to reduce the deficit by the summer of 2018. Otherwise, pension contributions from employers and staff would have to sharply increase, potentially resulting in redundancies and cuts to other areas of teaching, research and student support.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"&gt;Alistair Jarvis, '[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/universities-uk-chief-alistair-jarvis-unions-pension-demands-will-cost-1bn-a-year-fb8v05jhs Universities UK chief Alistair Jarvis: union’s pension demands will cost £1bn a year]', ''The Sunday Times'' (18 March 2018), accessed from {{cite web|url=http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/blog/Pages/uss-pensions-update.aspx|title=Archived copy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180320052813/http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/blog/Pages/uss-pensions-update.aspx|archivedate=20 March 2018|deadurl=no|accessdate=21 March 2018|df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; UUK stated the defined contributions proposal would compare well with private-sector competitors, with employer contributions double the private sector average.&lt;ref name=":500" /&gt;

USS had a legal responsibility to satisfy the UK pensions regulator that the scheme was sound, and the regulator was requiring change.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

====Arguments against the changes====
UCU stated that UUK's proposal would "leave a typical lecturer almost £10,000 a year worse off in retirement than under the current set-up",&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/university-pension-strike-listening |title=The university pension strike will only end when we're listened to {{!}} Sally Hunt|last=Hunt|first=Sally|date=5 March 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=12 March 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180311132107/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/mar/05/university-pension-strike-listening|archivedate=11 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with younger staff the worst affected, with some losing up to half their anticipated pensions.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Critics of the changes offered the following main arguments against implementing the changes to the scheme promoted by UUK.
* UUK's assessment of the health of the higher education sector after a 2015/16 report by [[Higher Education Funding Council for England|the Higher Education Funding Council for England (HEFCE)]] found the sector was financially sound.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hefce.ac.uk/analysis/HEinEngland/finhealth/ |title=Financial health overview - Higher Education Funding Council for England |last=England |first=Higher Education Funding Council for |website=www.hefce.ac.uk |language=en|access-date=12 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312105935/http://www.hefce.ac.uk/analysis/HEinEngland/finhealth/ |archivedate=12 March 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independent analyses undertaken by [[University of Warwick]] economist Dennis Leech and [[University College London|UCL]] academic Sean Wallis argued that UUK used a "flawed valuation model".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;
* The proposed USS changes were shaped by the demand of the UK pensions regulator that USS should be made less risky to employers than USS's actuaries had wished. It was argued, however, that in view of the exceptional economic circumstances associated with the Bank of England's [[quantitative easing]] from 2009, the regulator was placing unrealistic expectations on UK pensions nationally.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;David Bailey and John Clancy, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-regulator-blame-pensions-crisis USS strike: regulator is to blame for pensions crisis]', ''Times Higher Education'' (13 March 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timeshighereducation.com"/&gt;
* Concern also grew, on the basis of research by [[Michael Otsuka]] from the [[London School of Economics]], that UUK's negotiating position was disproportionately influenced by the views of Oxford and Cambridge Universities, whose constituent colleges made separate submissions to consultations.&lt;ref name="auto7"&gt;Richard Adams, '[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/21/universities-strike-blamed-on-vote-by-oxbridge-colleges Universities strike blamed on vote by Oxbridge colleges] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227001146/https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/feb/21/universities-strike-blamed-on-vote-by-oxbridge-colleges |date=27 February 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'' (21 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/oxbridge-universities-higher-education-strike-pensions-cuts-more-say-ucu-a8223011.html |title=Oxbridge universities 'given greater say than other institutions' on pensions cuts driving higher education strike |last=Baynes |first=Chris |date=22 February 2018 |work=The Independent|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304081549/http://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/education-news/oxbridge-universities-higher-education-strike-pensions-cuts-more-say-ucu-a8223011.html|archive-date=4 March 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":300" /&gt;
* Current employees were annually paying £2.1bn into the USS fund, while it was annually paying out £1.8bn to pensioners. To cover the current annual cost of pensions from investment returns, the fund required a net annual return of 3%.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Hesketh, '[https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/22/the-solution-to-university-pensions-better-fund-managers The solution to university pensions? Better fund managers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227003931/https://www.theguardian.com/higher-education-network/2018/feb/22/the-solution-to-university-pensions-better-fund-managers |date=27 February 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'', 22 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the assumptions used in the July 2017 valuation was that the fund would stop accepting contributions — the sort of situation that would normally arise if the companies in a pension scheme went bust, which was an unlikely real-world situation for the UK higher education sector.&lt;ref name="LeechBlog"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/dennisleech/entry/is_the_uss_1_2/ |title=Is the USS really in crisis?, 23/11/17, Dennis Leech's blog |website=blogs.warwick.ac.uk|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; USS's analyses showed that, assuming the most likely circumstances rather than the most challenging circumstances (technically referred to as the "best estimate"), the pension scheme was sustainable in the long-term. In contrast to technical deficits based on stringently conservative assumptions, this more probable valuation showed the fund in credit by £8.3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref name="LeechBlog" /&gt;
* At the inception of USS, employer contributions were 16% of salary, rising to 18.55% in 1983. However, from January 1997 to September 2009 they were decreased to 14% (before rising to 16% from October 2009 to 2016 and 18% thereafter). It was suggested that staff were bearing the consequences of an earlier lack of investment by employers.&lt;ref name="Logan1985"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper2014"&gt;Susan Cooper, '[https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~scooper/USS/2014-11%20Pensions.pdf A Pensions Proposal: Constant Contributions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228041225/https://users.physics.ox.ac.uk/~scooper/USS/2014-11%20Pensions.pdf |date=28 February 2018 }}' (p. 1).&lt;/ref&gt;

===UCU ballots for industrial action (29 January)===
On 29 January, UCU announced that 88% of UCU members had voted to back strike action and 93% backed action short of a strike.&lt;ref name="auto8"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9242/UCU-announces-14-strike-dates-at-61-universities-in-pensions-row |title=UCU announces 14 strike dates at 61 universities in pensions row |website=www.ucu.org.uk |language=en-gb|access-date=6 February 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180202232646/https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9242/UCU-announces-14-strike-dates-at-61-universities-in-pensions-row |archivedate=2 February 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The turnout was 58%,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; meeting the 50% minimum set by the [[Trade Union Act 2016]].

Shortly after, on 13 February, the trade union [[UNISON]], many of whose members in the Higher Education sector were also USS members, began a consultative ballot on striking alongside UCU.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2018/02/uss-letter/ HE members to be consulted over proposed pension changes]' (13 February 2019).&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 February, UNISON wrote to vice-chancellors in support of UCU's position.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2018/02/uss-letter/ UNISON writes to vice chancellors over university pensions dispute]' (20 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:International Women's Day and Leeds UCU signs, 2018.jpg|thumb|International Women's Day and Leeds UCU signs, 2018]]
Strikes commenced on 23 February, whereupon UUK agreed to meet UCU for further negotiations on 27 February. Leaked emails suggested they would not negotiate on UCU's key issue, retaining defined benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Camilla Turner, '[{{cite web |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/02/24/lecturers-poised-escalate-disruption-leaked-letter-reveals-university/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180226205324/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/2018/02/24/lecturers-poised-escalate-disruption-leaked-letter-reveals-university/ |archivedate=26 February 2018 |df=}} Lecturers' strike: universities refusing to bow on pension reforms, leaked letter reveals', ''The Sunday Telegraph'' (24 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting led to an agreement to undergo conciliation through [[Acas]], the UK's national industrial dispute conciliation body.

A spokesperson for Universities UK said: "Both sides are currently engaged in serious and constructive talks at [[Acas]].

===UCU's proposal (27 February)===

UCU tabled an alternative proposal at the first round of talks with UUK which UCU stated would involve universities accepting some increased risk and small increased contributions from employers and scheme members.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; UUK's response was that they would need time to cost the union's proposal which it feared would require "very substantial increases in contributions". However, some vice-chancellors voiced support for UCU's plan.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

UCU's proposal, along with suggestions for longer-term strategies, was:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9364/Further-talks-agreed-in-universities-pensions-dispute |title='Further talks agreed in universities pensions dispute' (27 February 2018) |access-date=28 February 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228201401/https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9364/Further-talks-agreed-in-universities-pensions-dispute |archive-date=28 February 2018 |dead-url=no |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Universities should accept a slightly riskier but probably more lucrative investment strategy, leading to a deficit of £5.1bn rather than £6.1bn, a level accepted by the majority of institutions when it was proposed by USS in September 2017.
* Retaining defined benefits on salaries up to £55,550.
* Reducing the annual accrual rate reduced from 1/75th to 1/80th.
* Increasing contributions by 2.7% for employers and 1.4% for members (i.e. 4.1% split 65/35 between employers and employees).
The parties held inconclusive talks on 5 March, scheduling the next talks for 7 March.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; However, a bizarre Twitter spasm from UUK on the night of 5 March insisted that the group was available for talks on 6 March, and this led to talks at noon on 6 March.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Burns, '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334 University strike talks resume after Twitter skirmishes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312192658/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334 |date=12 March 2018 }}', ''BBC News'' (6 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Talks continued on 7 March, inconclusively. On 8 March, UCU's Higher Education Committee agreed that it would call further strikes if necessary after the Easter vacation, between April and June.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Wright, '[https://www.ft.com/content/57a6f7b6-22fb-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11 UK universities could be hit by new strikes amid pension dispute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180309054353/https://www.ft.com/content/57a6f7b6-22fb-11e8-ae48-60d3531b7d11 |date=9 March 2018 }}', ''Financial Times'' (8 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joint UUK and UCU proposal (12 March)===
[[File:Placard from March 13 2018 UCU protest, Leeds.jpg|thumb|Placard from 13 March 2018 UCU protest, Leeds.]]
On the evening of Monday 12 March UCU and UUK issued a joint agreement, arrived at through ACAS, to be put to their respective members.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43380857 |title=Deal offered in university pensions row |last=Coughlan |first=Sean |date=13 March 2018 |work=BBC News|access-date=13 March 2018 |language=en-GB |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313001707/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43380857 |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement was specifically for a three-year "transitional benefit arrangement" lasting from 1 April 2019, maintaining defined benefits up to a salary threshold of £42,000, reducing the accrual rate to 1/85, but raising contributions to 19.3% of salaries for employers and 8.7% for members. The next valuation was to be informed by an "independent expert group", 'aiming to promote greater transparency and understanding' of the methodologies, assumptions, and viability of the scheme. Indexation and revaluation was to be measured using CPI and capped at up to 2.5% p.a. (meaning that if inflation, measured by CPI, rose above 2.5%, the pension would lose value in real terms). UCU was to suspend industrial action and "encourage" branches to re-schedule any classes disrupted by the strike. The agreement stated that "there is commitment between both sides to engage in meaningful discussions as soon as possible to explore risk sharing alternatives for the future from 2020, in particular Collective Defined Contributions".&lt;ref&gt;University and College Union and Universities UK, '[https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/9300/Agreement-reached-between-UCU-and-UUK-under-the-auspices-of-ACAS/pdf/UCU_UUK_agreement_at_ACAS_12_March_Final.pdf Agreement reached between UCU and UUK under the auspices of ACAS] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312190956/https://www.ucu.org.uk/media/9300/Agreement-reached-between-UCU-and-UUK-under-the-auspices-of-ACAS/pdf/UCU_UUK_agreement_at_ACAS_12_March_Final.pdf |date=12 March 2018 }}' (12 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/13/striking-university-staff-irate-over-pensions-deal-ucu |title=University strikes to continue after staff reject pension offer |last=Weale |first=Sally |date=13 March 2018 |website=the Guardian |language=en|access-date=14 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313190115/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/13/striking-university-staff-irate-over-pensions-deal-ucu |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Vice-chancellors were to inform UUK whether they would back this deal by the end of day on Wednesday 14 March while UCU representatives consulted with their members on whether to reject the deal or not the next day.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

===Acas agreement withdrawn by UCU (13 March)===
[[File:Picket at University of Edinburgh.jpg|alt=UCU meeting at University of Edinburgh|thumb|293x293px|UCU meeting at the [[University of Edinburgh]]]]
Local branch meetings were held on Tuesday 13 March to consider the ACAS agreement. These meetings informed a meeting of elected and branch representatives the same day. This agreement was rejected by UCU's membership on the grounds that it failed to address members' concerns.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9401/University-strikes-remain-on-as-UCU-rejects-proposals?list=1676 University strikes remain on as UCU rejects proposals] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313164953/https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9401/University-strikes-remain-on-as-UCU-rejects-proposals?list=1676 |date=13 March 2018 }}' (13 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sean Coughlan, '[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43388912 University strikers reject pension deal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316130245/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43388912 |date=16 March 2018 }}', ''BBC News'' (13 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9401/University-strikes-remain-on-as-UCU-rejects-proposals?list=1676 |title=University strikes remain on as UCU rejects proposals |website=www.ucu.org.uk |language=en-gb|access-date=14 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313164953/https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9401/University-strikes-remain-on-as-UCU-rejects-proposals?list=1676 |archivedate=13 March 2018 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many UCU members used the Twitter hashtag #NoCapitulation to express their disapproval of the agreement,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/13/striking-university-staff-irate-over-pensions-deal-ucu |title=University strikes to continue after staff reject pension offer |last=Weale |first=Sally |date=13 March 2018 |work=The Guardian|access-date=18 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318013105/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/13/striking-university-staff-irate-over-pensions-deal-ucu|archive-date=18 March 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; helping to co-ordinate a strong response to the proposals.&lt;ref name="auto9"&gt;Nicole Kobie, '[https://www.wired.co.uk/article/no-capitulation-uk-university-pension-protest-twitter #NoCapitulation: How one hashtag saved the UK university strike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321050532/http://www.wired.co.uk/article/no-capitulation-uk-university-pension-protest-twitter |date=21 March 2018 }}', ''Wired'' (18 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43388912|title=University strikers reject pension deal|last=Coughlan|first=Sean|date=13 March 2018|work=BBC News|language=en-GB|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180313200220/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43388912|archivedate=13 March 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=14 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UCU general secretary [[Sally Hunt]] said that preparations for strikes during the exam period would be made, while urgently seeking further talks.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See further '[https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9404/How-we-got-to-yesterday-and-whats-next How we got to yesterday and what's next]' (14 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A UUK spokesperson said: &lt;blockquote&gt;It is hugely disappointing that students' education will be further disrupted through continued strike action. We have engaged extensively with UCU negotiators to find a mutually acceptable way forward.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/UCU-rejects-proposals-jointly-agreed-at-ACAS.aspx |title=UCU rejects proposals jointly agreed at ACAS |website=www.universitiesuk.ac.uk |language=en-GB |access-date=14 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315133330/http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/UCU-rejects-proposals-jointly-agreed-at-ACAS.aspx |archivedate=15 March 2018 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In some places, the decision was followed the next day by rallies.&lt;ref name="auto10"&gt;Kristian Johnson, '[https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/news/leeds-news/five-things-learned-latest-ucu-14410973 Five things we learned from the latest UCU rally through Leeds city centre] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180318060411/https://www.leeds-live.co.uk/news/leeds-news/five-things-learned-latest-ucu-14410973 |date=18 March 2018 }}', ''LeedsLive'' (14 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developments 14–23 March===

As of 14 March, UUK's consultation with its members remained ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;'[http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/planning-more-talks-with-UCU.aspx Universities UK planning more talks with UCU to end pensions dispute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316023228/http://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/planning-more-talks-with-UCU.aspx |date=16 March 2018 }}' (14 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A statutory 64-day consultation by USS on pension changes had been due to commence on 19 March, but as of 15 March, USS were declaring an unspecified delay to the commencement of consultations.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.ussconsultation2018.co.uk/members/info Employer consultation in relation to proposed changes to Universities Superannuation Scheme ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316151911/https://www.ussconsultation2018.co.uk/members/info |date=16 March 2018 }}' (accessed 15 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 March, UCU called on members employed as external examiners to resign until the dispute was resolved.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Havergal, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/call-external-examiners-quit-uk-pensions-dispute Call for external examiners to quit in UK pensions dispute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316214248/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/call-external-examiners-quit-uk-pensions-dispute |date=16 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (16 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; By 23 March over 600 resignations had occurred.&lt;ref name="auto12"&gt;Sophie Inge, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/hundreds-external-examiners-resign-uk-pensions-dispute Hundreds of external examiners resign in UK pensions dispute]', ''Times Higher Education'' (23 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 March, UUK announced that it would convene an "independent panel", featuring an independent chair and involving academics and pension professionals, to "consider issues of methodology, assumptions and monitoring, aiming to promote greater transparency and understanding of the USS valuation". The panel would invite UCU "to play a full role in providing evidence to the panel" and would also liaise with USS and the pensions regulator.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/Panel-of-independent-experts-to-review-processes-for-arriving-at-pension-deficit.aspx Panel of independent experts to review processes for arriving at pension deficit]' (18 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto6"/&gt; UCU's response was that "UCU will of course look at any proposals UUK makes but our members have made it quite clear that what is needed is a much improved offer".&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9412/UCU-responds-to-UUK-valuation-review UCU responds to UUK valuation review]' (18 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 March, UCU sanctioned fourteen further strike days to fall in the April to June 2018 exam period should the talks fail to come to a resolution.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

On 23 March, UNISON announced that its consultative ballot of its USS members had returned 91% support for industrial action, and that it would begin a formal ballot for strike action in April.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.unison.org.uk/news/2018/03/he-pension/ University members asked to strike to defend USS pension scheme]' (23 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Talya Misiri, '[https://www.pensionsage.com/pa/Enough-is-enough-Unison-urges-USS-members-to-join-industrial-action.php ‘Enough is enough’ Unison urges USS members to join industrial action]', ''PensionsAge'' (23 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;'[https://morningstaronline.co.uk/article/unison-strike-ballot-over-university-pensions Unison strike ballot over university pensions]', ''Morning Star'' (24 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

===UUK makes a new offer (23 March)===

On 23 March, UCU announced a new offer from UUK. This proposed the creation of a formal "Joint Expert Panel" to reconsider how valuations should be undertaken, leaving open the possibility of maintaining the status quo not only for the statutory period up to April 2019, but possibly beyond. The panel would
&lt;blockquote&gt;take into account the unique nature of the HE sector, inter-generational fairness and equality considerations, the need to strike a fair balance between ensuring stability and risk. Recognising that staff highly value Defined Benefit provision, the work of the group will reflect the clear wish of staff to have a guaranteed pension comparable with current provision whilst meeting the affordability challenges for all parties, within the current regulatory framework.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9422/New-offer-sent-to-UCU-members-in-USS-pensions-dispute?list=1676 New offer sent to UCU members in USS pensions dispute]' (23 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Financial Times'' noted that this would be "a far more comprehensive review of the current structure and valuation of the Universities Superannuation Scheme" than previously considered, but also noted that "the new agreement avoids any mention of increases in contributions by either employers or employees to plug the hole in the scheme".&lt;ref name="ft.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/5d991390-2ebb-11e8-a34a-7e7563b0b0f4|title=Subscribe to read|website=Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; UCU was due to consult members' representatives at a formal meeting on 28 March.&lt;ref name="ft.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Max Jenner, '[https://oxfordstudent.com/2018/03/23/uuk-tables-new-proposal-for-ucu/ NewsUUK tables new proposal for UCU]', ''Oxford Student'' (23 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on 26 March, the UK's Joint Negotiating Committee for Higher Education Staff began its round of negotiations for pay in the sector for 2018/19, with unions demanding a large pay uplift.&lt;ref name="HE_Pay_claim_submitted 2018"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===New strike dates announced as UCU members balloted on proposal (28 March)===
UCU announced that members would be electronically balloted on the new offer in April to decide on the proposal for the Joint Expert Panel.&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/28/uk-university-staff-to-vote-on-latest-pensions-offer|title=UK university staff to vote on latest pensions offer|last=Adams|first=Richard|date=2018-03-28|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; UUK pledged to maintain the current contributions and retirement benefits until at least April 2019 while the review by the panel of experts took place.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

At the same time, UCU gave formal notice of a five-day strike action, aimed at disrupting the exams and assessments period, at some universities for 16 April to 20 April 2018, potentially to be called off  if there was progress in the negotiations.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; 13 universities including Manchester, Cardiff, Oxford, St Andrews, Leeds and Southampton would be affected by this next round of strikes with the prospect of industrial action at the other 52 universities to take place later in April and continuing into July if no agreement was reached.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; However, staff would not take part in additional strike action if UCU members vote to accept the UUK proposal.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

As of 28 March, nearly 700 external examiners had recorded their resignations in a UCU document.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; ''The Guardian'' reported that "students at the end of their courses could find themselves unable to graduate if crucial exams cannot be invigilated, marked or assessed" as a worst-case scenario.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;

Debate followed among UCU members as to whether to accept the proposals or not.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Parfitt, '[https://www.jacobinmag.com/2018/03/universities-uk-strike-contract-vote-education Deal or No Deal?]', ''Jacobin'' (3 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; As of 4 April, some branches had decided to recommend that their members reject the proposals as they stood,&lt;ref&gt;Richard Adams, '[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/apr/04/university-staff-vote-on-pensions-offer-without-a-deal-in-sight University staff vote on pensions offer – without a deal in sight]', ''The Guardian'' (4 April 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Inge, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/under-pressure-ucu-leader-urges-members-accept-pensions-deal Under-pressure UCU leader urges members to accept pensions deal]', ''Times Higher Education'' (4 April 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and prominent discontent with the proposals continued to be registered in the run-up to the ballot closing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/union-unrest-opens-new-front-uk-university-pensions-dispute|title=Union unrest opens new front in UK university pensions dispute|date=2018-04-09|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|access-date=2018-04-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 May, UUK and UCU announced that the Joint Expert Panel would be chaired by Joanne Segars.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.universitiesuk.ac.uk/news/Pages/UCU-and-UUK-announce-appointment-of-Chair-for-USS-Joint-Expert-Panel.aspx UCU and UUK announce appointment of Chair for USS Joint Expert Panel]', 18 May 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9490/UCU-and-UUK-announce-appointment-of-Chair-for-USS-Joint-Expert-Panel UCU and UUK announce appointment of Chair for USS Joint Expert Panel]' (18 May 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; On 21 May UCU announced three nominations to the panel.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.ucu.org.uk/article/9493/UCU-announces-nominations-to-USS-joint-expert-panel= UCU announces nominations to USS joint expert pane]' (221 May 201).&lt;/ref&gt; Other members were later determined as Ronnie Bowie, Sally Bridgeland, and Chris Curry (appointed by UUK) and Catherine Donnelly, Saul Jacka, and Deborah Mabbett (appointed by UCU).&lt;ref&gt;The Joint Expert Panel on the Universities Superannuation Scheme commissioned by the University and College Union and Universities UK, '[https://web.archive.org/web/20180913161622/http://www.ussjep.org.uk/files/2018/09/report-of-the-joint-expert-panel.pdf Report of the Joint Expert Panel]' (September 2018), pp. 70-71.&lt;/ref&gt; The Joint Expert Panel was scheduled to report in September.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/uss-announces-increases-higher-education-pension-contributions|title=USS announces increases in higher education pension contributions|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1–3 June, a tumultuous UCU congress included calls for the general secretary, Sally Hunt, to resign over what was perceived to be undemocratic practice within the Union's prosecution of the dispute. Much of the congress's proceedings had to be aborted, and a new congress was proposed for the future.&lt;ref&gt;Chris Havergal, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/sally-hunt-clings-ucu-leader-congress-curtailed Sally Hunt clings on as UCU leader as congress curtailed]', ''Times Higher Education'' (1 June 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; (On October 18, a recalled congress saw the withdrawal of motions to call for resignation, but a motion of censure was passed complaining at a lack of transparency and accountability in Hunt's representation of UCU members during the dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Grove, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/ucus-sally-hunt-censured-over-handling-pensions-strike UCU’s Sally Hunt censured over handling of pensions strike]', ''Times Higher Education'' (18 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;)

On 6 June, UCU commenced a consultative ballot to determine whether to conduct a formal ballot for industrial action in relation to the UK Joint Negotiating Committee for Higher Education Staff's negotiations over 2018-19 pay. The ballot closed on 27 June 2018, with 82% of participating members voting to reject the offer from the University and Colleges Employers’ Association of a minimum pay rise of 2 per cent, rising to 2.8 per cent for the lowest paid.&lt;ref name="Anna McKie 2018"/&gt; UCU formally declared a trade dispute on 24 July 2018.&lt;ref name="HE national negotiations 2018-19"&gt;'[https://web.archive.org/web/20180911184449/https://www.ucu.org.uk/he2018?utm_source=lyr-ucu-members&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_campaign=members&amp;utm_term=he-full-jnches&amp;utm_content=Pay+and+equality+ballot+now+open HE national negotiations 2018-19]' (accessed 11 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== USS plans contribution increases (25 July) ===
While the Joint Expert Panel deliberated, USS announced that, given that the legal deadline for addressing the fund's deficit had passed, it would, in accordance with statutory procedure, act already to raise both staff and employer contributions, following a statutory consultation period, to maintain the scheme's benefits. The proposed rises (as a percentage of salary) were to be phased in over a year:

|-
|October 2019
|10.4%
|22.5%
|-
|April 2020

|}
These plans were announced against a backdrop of USS's annual report calculations of the deficit falling, due to changing assumptions about factors such as returns on corporate bonds and mortality. On different measures, the 2018 annual report showed a 2014 deficit of 12.6bn falling to a 2018 deficit of 12.1bn; or a £17.5bn deficit falling to £8.4 billion deficit.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;

On 21 August, UCU served statutory notice of its intention to ballot members for industrial action regarding the 2018-19 national pay dispute. The ballot opened on 30 August.&lt;ref name="HE national negotiations 2018-19"/&gt;

On 13 September, the Joint Expert Panel that had been convened to re-examine the valuation of the USS scheme issued its first report.&lt;ref&gt;The Joint Expert Panel on the Universities Superannuation Scheme commissioned by the University and College Union and Universities UK, '[https://web.archive.org/web/20180913161622/http://www.ussjep.org.uk/files/2018/09/report-of-the-joint-expert-panel.pdf Report of the Joint Expert Panel]' (September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ucu.org.uk"/&gt; The Panel's press release recommended a number of adjustments to the methodology and data used in the 2017 valuation of the USS scheme, and stated that "it is the Panel’s belief, based on independent actuarial analysis, that the full implementation of these adjustments could mean total required contributions estimated at 29.2% to fund current benefits [...] This compares to the current rate of 26% (18% of salary paid by employers, 8% by employees) and the rate of 36.6% from April 2020 which is proposed by USS, based on the valuation as it stands".&lt;ref&gt;'[https://web.archive.org/web/20180913141628/http://www.ussjep.org.uk/report-of-the-joint-expert-panel/ USS Joint Expert Panel]' (13 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; It was suggested that this proposal might entail raising employees' contributions to 9.1% of salary, and employers' by 2.1%, taking their contribution to 20.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Grove, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/pay-extra-1-salary-save-uss-pension-benefits-says-panel Pay extra 1% of salary to save USS pension benefits, says panel]', ''Times Higher Education'' (13 September 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 15, Sam Marsh, of the University of Sheffield, reported in detail on his own analysis of data obtained from USS after a long period of requesting the information. He found that the methodologies by which USS's 'test 1' measures the pension scheme's viability were flawed, and that by maintaining previous investment strategies, USS would have the surplus it would require to meet its future liabilities. UUK asked the USS trustee to investigate Marsh's arguments.&lt;ref&gt;Josephine Cumbo, '[https://www.ft.com/content/3778c62c-d142-11e8-a9f2-7574db66bcd5 University pension fund accused of exaggerating shortfall]', ''The Financial Times'' (16 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sam Marsh, '[https://medium.com/ussbriefs/a-flawed-valuation-the-laypersons-guide-to-my-findings-on-uss-s-test-1-b9e0c53f5d67 A flawed valuation: the layperson’s guide to my findings on USS’s ‘Test 1’]' (15 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Callard, Jo Grady, Nick Hardy,  Jaya John John, Nicky Priaulx, and Ruth Stirton, '[https://medium.com/ussbriefs/there-must-be-something-missing-here-sam-marsh-exposes-new-problems-in-the-uss-valuation-351c90b1ab30 Sam Marsh exposes new problems in the USS valuation', ''USSbriefs'', 59 (16 October 2018).]&lt;/ref&gt; Marsh's commentary had also attracted prominent support from [[Michael Otsuka]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Otsuka, '[https://web.archive.org/web/20181018204618/https://medium.com/@mikeotsuka/usss-valuation-rests-on-a-large-and-demonstrable-mistake-691103c94ca6 USS’s valuation rests on a large and demonstrable mistake]' (13 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; USS defended its position the next day, accepting that Marsh's reanalysis was 'not wrong in isolation', but arguing that de-risking was necessary anyway.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://web.archive.org/web/20181019200234/https://www.uss.co.uk/how-uss-is-run/valuation/2017-valuation-updates/claims-of-a-large-and-demonstable-error Claims of a ‘large and demonstrable error’ in the valuation]', (16 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Grove, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/universities-superannuation-scheme-rejects-valuation-error-claim Universities Superannuation Scheme rejects valuation error claim]', ''Times Higher Education'' (17 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 22, UCU announced the results of the ballot on striking over pay. Although the majority of Union members who voted elected to take industrial action, the turnout only passed the 50% of members required by the [[Trade Union Act 2016]] at seven universities (alongside which three Northern Irish universities, unaffected by the legislation, also voted to strike).&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Likewise, on October 29, Unison reported that although a majority of voting members had supported strike action, the vote was frustrated by insufficient turnout.&lt;ref&gt;'[https://web.archive.org/web/20181031130100/https://www.unison.org.uk/news/article/2018/10/he-ballot-result/ Higher education ballot result]' (29 October 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Responses to the strikes==
[[File:UCU Higher Education Strike rally.jpg|alt=UCU Higher Education Strike rally, George Square, Glasgow.|thumb|Crowds gather at a UCU strike rally in George Square, Glasgow.]]

=== Changes in UK law ===
The strike brought to the attention of unions and the UK government a potential ambiguity in UK legislation: migrant workers on [[Visa policy of the United Kingdom|Tier 2 and 5 visas]] have an annual 20-day limit on unpaid absence from work. As some universities had seen local strike action during 2017-18 in addition to the 14 days of national strike action, fears arose that staff members who were on strike for more than 20 days in a year might have their visas revoked, and that this might in turn impinge on their legal rights to take industrial action.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/opinion/curtailing-overseas-scholars-right-strike-undermines-their-academic-citizenship|title=Curtailing overseas scholars’ right to strike undermines their academic citizenship|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 12 July, the [[Home Secretary|home secretary]] [[Sajid Javid]] declared that it was "not the government’s policy to prevent migrant workers from engaging in legal strike action" and that he would introduce changes to the rules and guidelines on immigration to be explicit that strike action did not count as "unpaid absence".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/javid-foreign-staff-can-strike-without-risking-right-remain|title=Javid: foreign staff can strike without risking right to remain|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.parliament.uk/business/publications/written-questions-answers-statements/written-statement/Commons/2018-07-12/HCWS848|title=Immigration:Written statement - HCWS848|last=Javid|first=Sajid|date=12 July 2018|website=parliament.uk|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ballot for the strike, UCU achieved an unusually high turnout and strong support for industrial action, and membership grew by about 15,000 between the beginning of 2018 and 12 April.&lt;ref name="auto13"&gt;Jack Grove, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/features/uss-strike-and-the-winter-of-academics-discontent The USS strike and the winter of academics’ discontent]', ''Times Higher Education'' (12 April 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the strikes commenced, academics at Oxford and Cambridge began using those universities' democratic structures to change the universities' position on pension reform.&lt;ref name="auto7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Richard Adams, '[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/02/uk-universities-threaten-punish-striking-staff-cancelled-lectures Universities threaten to punish striking staff over cancelled lectures] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316183535/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/02/uk-universities-threaten-punish-striking-staff-cancelled-lectures |date=16 March 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'' (2 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford staff's attempts to use the university's supreme governing body, [[Congregation (university)|Congregation]], to effect a change of policy failed due to procedural problems on 5 March, but the next day Oxford's vice-chancellor [[Louise Richardson]] declared that the University would nonetheless heed the wishes of staff to "reverse its response to the UUK survey".&lt;ref&gt;Richard Adams, '[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/07/oxford-university-backs-down-in-pensions-dispute Oxford University backs down in pensions dispute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316183526/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/mar/07/oxford-university-backs-down-in-pensions-dispute |date=16 March 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'' (7 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

As the strikes developed, university staff increasingly called into question the governance structures of UUK, individual universities, and USS, along with the marketisation of the UK higher education sector and its increasingly precarious workforce.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Phelps, '[https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/uk-lecturers-strike-university-pensions-austerity-student-solidarity Britain: Universities on Strike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151314/https://www.dissentmagazine.org/online_articles/uk-lecturers-strike-university-pensions-austerity-student-solidarity |date=19 March 2018 }}', ''Dissent'' (15 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Watermeyer, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-academics-and-football-fans-are-fed-dehumanising-conditions USS strike: academics (and football fans) are fed up with ‘dehumanising’ conditions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180321193041/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-academics-and-football-fans-are-fed-dehumanising-conditions |date=21 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (20 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Celine Tan, '[http://slsablog.co.uk/blog/blog-posts/uss-strikes-defending-the-collective-public-goods-mandate-of-the-uk-universities/ USS Strikes: Defending the Collective Public Goods Mandate of the UK Universities]', ''SLSA Blog'' (16 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; By 13 April, over 12,000 people had signed a petition calling for UUK to be made subject to the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000]].&lt;ref name="auto13" /&gt;

Staff also made extensive use of social media (see below).

===Universities===

Universities were represented in the dispute by UUK.

However, some vice-chancellors expressed support for UCU's position before the strike. [[Anthony Forster (academic)|Anthony Forster]], vice-chancellor at the [[University of Essex]], described a staff consultation process that led Essex to support retaining defined benefits via increased pension contributions.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Forster, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/universities-must-pay-more-protect-pensions Universities must pay more to protect pensions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180310201015/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/universities-must-pay-more-protect-pensions |date=10 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (19 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Warwick]]'s [[Stuart Croft (academic)|Stuart Croft]] publicly stated that "I am sure that I am not alone in being mystified at this [proposed] change",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://blogs.warwick.ac.uk/execteam/entry/which_way_forward/ |title=Which way forward for USS?, 28/11/17, VC blog |website=blogs.warwick.ac.uk|access-date=6 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argued, in line with the position of the Liberal Democrats, that the UK government should underwrite USS pensions.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart Croft, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-it-time-nationalise-university-pensions USS strike: is it time to nationalise university pensions?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180316041053/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-it-time-nationalise-university-pensions |date=16 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (26 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the strike began, other vice chancellors voiced concern about UUK's position, and by the second day of strike action, 18 were being reported as calling for renewed negotiations, or as supporting UCU's position.&lt;ref&gt;Todd Gillespie and Catherine Lally, '[https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/14919 Stephen Toope joins calls for renewed talks to end strikes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225181649/https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/14919 |date=25 February 2018 }}', ''Varsity'' (23 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Some joined staff on picket lines, among them [[Anton Muscatelli]] (Glasgow), [[Keith Burnett]] (Sheffield) and [[Robert Allison (academic)|Robert Allison]] (Loughborough).&lt;ref&gt;Sophie Inge, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/pensions-strike-poisons-relations-uk-campuses Pensions strike ‘poisons relations’ on UK campuses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204748/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/pensions-strike-poisons-relations-uk-campuses |date=12 March 2018 }}', ''Times Higher Education'' (8 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to ''The Times'' of 16 March, the vice-chancellor of Cambridge University, [[Stephen Toope]], expressed sympathy with the concerns of staff and students about not only pensions, but also marketisation of UK universities,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Toope, '[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/edition/comment/british-retaliation-against-russia-s-actions-p5hmpj8jh The future of UK universities]', ''The Times'' (16 March 2018), accessed from {{cite web |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/the-future-of-uk-universities-vice-chancellors-blog |title=Archived copy |accessdate=21 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151339/https://www.cam.ac.uk/news/the-future-of-uk-universities-vice-chancellors-blog |archivedate=19 March 2018 |df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rosemary Bennett, '[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/turning-universities-into-businesses-caused-strikes-hzrxsv2q6 Turning universities into businesses ‘caused strikes’, says Cambridge vice-chancellor Stephen Toope]', ''The Times'' (16 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Louis Ashworth, '[https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/15179 Toope attacks ‘fundamental error’ of university marketisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151252/https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/15179 |date=19 March 2018 }}', ''Varsity'' (16 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and held a wide-ranging public meeting with around 550 staff and students in [[Great St Mary's Church]], scheduling a further such meeting for 26 April.&lt;ref&gt;Noella Chye &amp; Jack Conway, '[https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/15184 Hundreds of students gather to quiz Toope on pensions, divestment, and Prevent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180319151315/https://www.varsity.co.uk/news/15184 |date=19 March 2018 }}', ''Varsity'' (16 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, many universities demanded that staff reschedule teaching that had not been delivered during the strike, noting their right to deduct pay for [[partial performance]] if staff did not.

====Polls====
A [[Yougov]] poll of 738 undergraduate students conducted for UCU between 13 and 20 February 2018 found that nationally, 61% of students said they supported the strikes, with 19% opposed and the remainder unsure. At striking institutions, support was 66%, with 18% opposed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Sally Weale and Alexandra Topping, '[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions University lecturers begin strike action over pensions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227014405/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/22/lecturers-begin-14-day-strike-over-pensions |date=27 February 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'' (22 February 2018); 'UCU Pension Strike', {{cite web |url=http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/9234/YouGov-USS-strike-action-poll/spreadsheet/UK12225972_Pension_strike_UCU.xlsx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=16 March 2018 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180228044350/http://www.ucu.org.uk/media/9234/YouGov-USS-strike-action-poll/spreadsheet/UK12225972_Pension_strike_UCU.xlsx |archivedate=28 February 2018 |df=}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2018, a poll of 1,500 students for ''[[Times Higher Education]]'' magazine found over half (51.8%) would support their lecturer in a walk-out and just under a third (29.3%) would not.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/students-split-over-support-uss-pensions-strike-poll-reveals|title=Students split over support for USS pensions strike, poll reveals|date=15 February 2018|work=Times Higher Education (THE)|language=en|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180225075404/https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/students-split-over-support-uss-pensions-strike-poll-reveals|archivedate=25 February 2018|deadurl=no|access-date=12 March 2018|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support for the national strike was evenly balanced, with 38.4% in favour and 38.4% against.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

By 8 March, extensive student support for the strikes was still being reported, observing that students were joining with staff in solidarity against the marketisation of UK higher education.&lt;ref name="auto11"/&gt;

====Compensation====

Students, who in [[England]] had since 2012 paid fees covering most of the cost of their education, responded by demanding compensation from their universities, explicitly in support of the striking staff: by 20 February, 70,000 had signed letters and petitions of this kind,&lt;ref&gt;Sally Weale, '[https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/20/70000-students-call-for-compensation-over-ucu-lecturer-strike 70,000 students call for compensation over UCU lecturer strike] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180227003554/https://www.theguardian.com/education/2018/feb/20/70000-students-call-for-compensation-over-ucu-lecturer-strike |date=27 February 2018 }}', ''The Guardian'' (20 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; rising to around 126,000 by 5 March.&lt;ref name=":400"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334 |title=University strike talks suspended without agreement |last=Burns |first=Judith |date=5 March 2018 |work=BBC news|access-date=5 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305225924/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-43295334|archive-date=5 March 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 4 March 2018, it was reported that [[King's College London]] had become the first university to offer to use money not spent on striking staff's salaries to compensate students.&lt;ref&gt;Sian Griffiths, '[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/kings-college-london-students-offered-refund-over-lecturers-strike-bmf0czbc6 King’s College London offers student refunds over lecturers’ strike]', ''The Sunday Times'' (4 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sylvie Dumont, '[https://thetab.com/uk/kings/2018/03/04/breaking-kcl-is-offering-refunds-to-students-for-the-ucu-strikes-20744 King’s College London is offering refunds to students for the lecturer strikes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180305062922/https://thetab.com/uk/kings/2018/03/04/breaking-kcl-is-offering-refunds-to-students-for-the-ucu-strikes-20744 |date=5 March 2018 }}', ''The Tab'' (4 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Liow, a third year law student at the university, told the [[BBC]] that if universities did not refund students part of their fees, they would be profiting from the dispute, as they would gain the money not paid to striking university staff:&lt;blockquote&gt;I don't want a consumerist education service.

===Politicians===

On 29 November 2017, [[Carol Monaghan]] (Scottish National Party) tabled an [[Early Day Motion]] in the [[House of Commons]] entitled "Defending Academic Pensions", noting "with concern the proposal by Universities UK to close the defined benefit portion of the Universities Superannuation Scheme (USS) to all future service". The motion was sponsored by [[Caroline Lucas]] (Green Party), [[Martyn Day (politician)|Martyn Day]] and [[Pete Wishart]] (SNP), and [[Jim Cunningham (British politician)|Jim Cunningham]], and [[Mary Glindon]] (Labour).

Jane Deith, '[https://www.channel4.com/news/university-staff-strike-over-pensions University staff strike over pensions] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180304081457/https://www.channel4.com/news/university-staff-strike-over-pensions|date=4 March 2018}}', ''Channel 4 News'' (22 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and supportive editorials from newspapers including the ''Observer''&lt;ref&gt;'[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/observer-view-on-the-shambolic-way-universities-are-run?CMP=share_btn_fb The Observer view on the shambolic way universities are run] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180301044621/https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/feb/25/observer-view-on-the-shambolic-way-universities-are-run?CMP=share_btn_fb |date=1 March 2018 }}', ''The Observer'' (25 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Financial Times'', which opined that "the universities must increase their pensions offer, and lecturers should give a fair hearing to any new proposals. Failing that, students should be compensated by the colleges".&lt;ref name="auto2" /&gt; Support for UUK, meanwhile, was offered in ''The Times'', with [[Daniel Finkelstein]], for example, arguing that "the pension fund is a pot of money shared between current and past staff. All that the trustees and the regulator are trying to do is to make sure it is fairly shared out. They are ensuring the money hasn't all been given away while there are people with future claims against it".&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Finkelstein, '[https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/lecturers-can-t-expect-us-to-pay-their-pensions-nsq30t2fw Lecturers can’t expect us to pay their pensions]', ''The Times'' (27 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of commentators expressed exasperation at a tendency in the media, and on social media, to refer to the strike as a "lecturers' strike", when it involved a wide range of staff, academic and non-academic.&lt;ref&gt;Fiona Whelan, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-why-arent-more-administrative-staff-picket-lines USS strike: why aren’t more administrative staff on picket lines?]', ''Times Higher Education'' (28 February 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Social media====
UCU members made extensive use of social media during the dispute. They were used to disseminate activists' research on the changes to pensions.&lt;ref&gt;Sherrill Stroschein, '[https://www.timeshighereducation.com/blog/uss-strike-social-media-has-collapsed-case-pension-cuts USS strike: social media has collapsed the case for pension cuts]', ''Times Higher Education'' (12 March 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Social media were also used to satirise universities' senior management: for example, the hashtag #FindMyProvost was used to mock vice-chancellors who did not engage with staff.&lt;ref name="auto9"/&gt; They were also a powerful organising tool. A prominent example was the Twitter hashtag '''''#NoCapitulation''''', which emerged as the unifying message university staff rallied behind twenty hours after the Acas agreement of 12 March.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Dr Ed Rooksby, a tutor at [[Ruskin College]] Oxford said "The leadership saw this wave of hostility coming towards them and backed down," he says. "I'm sure there wouldn't have been as much momentum without Twitter, and without someone coming up with that hashtag."&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; Dr. Jo Grady, a senior lecturer in employment relations at [[University of Sheffield|Sheffield University]], stated her belief that Twitter had helped people connect "outside of traditional union frameworks" and that this was ironic as their employers were the ones who encouraged staff to use social media as a tool for self-promotion.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''A-Train'''''|A列車で行こう|Ē Ressha de Ikō|lit. ''Let's Take the A-Train''}} is a series of [[vehicle simulation game|train simulation]] [[video game]]s that were originally developed and published by [[Japan]]ese [[Video game developer|game developer]] [[Artdink]] in Japan. The first game in the series was published in 1985.&lt;ref name="1UP"/&gt; The first release in the [[United States]] was ''Take the A-Train II'', published in 1988 by the Seika Corporation under the title ''Railroad Empire''. However, the most well known U.S. release is ''Take the A-Train III'', published in 1992 by [[Maxis]] as simply ''A-Train''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train (original)==
The first iteration of the A-Train series was released in December 1985 for the [[FM-7]], [[NEC PC-8801]], [[NEC PC-9801]], [[Sharp X1|X1 Turbo]], [[Sharp MZ|MZ-2500]], [[Nintendo Entertainment System|Famicom]] and [[MSX]]2. A [[Windows 95]]/[[Windows 98|98]] port followed in April 2000.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train II==
The second iteration of the A-Train series was released in July 1988 for the NEC PC-9801 and [[Sharp X68000]]. In the USA, it was released under the name ''Railroad Empire''.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train III==
[[Image:Maxis a-train on mac1.jpg|thumb|left|The "New Town" scenario in A-Train 1.0 for Macintosh]]
'''''Take the A-Train III''''' (known internationally as '''''A-Train''''') is the third game in the A-Train series. It was originally developed and published by [[Japan]]ese [[Video game developer|game developer]] [[Artdink]] for Japan, and was later published by [[Maxis]] for the [[United States]]. It was originally released in December 1990 for the NEC PC-9801, [[FM Towns Marty]], [[Sharp X68000]], and [[TurboGrafx-16|PC Engine]] (TurboGrafx-16). The US version was released in October 1992 on DOS and Amiga.&lt;ref&gt;http://hol.abime.net/3339&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Japanese version was re-released in March 2000 for [[Windows 95]] and [[Windows 98|98]]. Artdink ported the A-Train III along with the editor to Windows 95, and published both titles as a package as the 3rd ARTDINK BEST CHOICE title in Japan.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The game puts players in command of a [[Rail transport|railway]] company. There are no rival companies; the player controls the only one in the [[city]] and the game is resultingly fairly open-ended. A-Train III is the first game in the series to make use of [[Isometric graphics in video games and pixel art|near-isometric]] [[Axonometric projection#Three types of axonometric projections|dimetric projection]] to present the city, similar to Maxis's later ''[[SimCity 2000]]''.&lt;ref name="pcmuseum"&gt;[http://www.pcmuseum.ca/details.asp?id=40218&amp;type=software A-Train], Personal Computer Museum&lt;/ref&gt; There are two types of transport that the player's company can take: passengers or building materials. The former is more likely to be profitable, but building materials allow the city to grow. Wherever the building materials are delivered, they can be taken and used to construct buildings for the city. These start with [[house]]s, but eventually, as an area grows, roads, and shops and other buildings are built. These can provide extra revenue for a passenger service, but also allowing the city to develop and grow can be seen as a goal in itself.  As well as the buildings built by the computer, in response to the materials being present, the player can construct their own buildings, such as [[ski resort]]s and [[hotel]]s, and make profits from them if the conditions are right.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

'''''A.III. Map Construction''''', known internationally as '''''A-Train Construction Set''''', is an editor that can change existing saved games, or to build landscapes from scratch. It comes with 6 sample maps.  Maxis also published A-Train Construction Set with A-Train as a single package in Europe, without the Ocean Software label.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

The game was tremendously popular in [[Japan]],&lt;ref name="1UP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.1up.com/do/newsStory?cId=3172863|title=Take the A-Train To Your DS|work=1UP News|publisher=1UP.com|accessdate=2009-03-14|date=2009-02-18|author=Kevin Gifford}}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus motivating Maxis to license it for [[United States|US]] distribution as ''A-Train'', available for DOS, Macintosh and Amiga platforms. It was released in October 1992, though it sold poorly.  Even the release of an add-on pack for the game failed to stir up any real support amongst the gaming community. The game was the first major failure from Maxis.{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}

''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s reviewer stated in 1992 that while he enjoyed the financial and management aspects of ''A-Train'', "many people will miss out on a fine program because of a steeply graded learning curve".&lt;ref name="trevena199209"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=98 | title=Leavin' On That Noonday Train To Chiba | work=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1992 | accessdate=3 July 2014 | author=Trevena, Stanley | pages=38–42}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The game was reviewed in 1992 in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]'' #187 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in "The Role of Computers" column.

The editors wrote, "Fascinating, absorbing and now quite cheap, ''A-Train'' is worth a place in any games collection — and don't be put off by the subject matter. It's brilliant fun."&lt;ref name=pcgameruktop50&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[PC Gamer UK]] | title=The ''PC Gamer'' Top 50 PC Games of All Time |date=April 1994 | issue=5 | pages=43–56 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==MD A-Train==
{{nihongo|A Ressha de Ikou MD|Ａ列車で行こうＭＤ||"MD A-Train"}} is a [[simulation game|simulation]] game involving the construction of a [[Rail transport|railroad]] in order to boost the city's [[Public transport|mass transit]] system.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} The game was released to an exclusively [[Japan]]ese market; with no release ever being attempted for the North American or European markets.

The player must use the [[resource]]s at hand to build a [[Rail transport|railroad]] connecting the two ends of a map in each scenario. A train can be controlled throughout the day (05:00-17:00) while building new tracks and stations. Nighttime activities (17:00-05:00) involve changing train schedules to better suit the needs of the player's growing mass transportation hub. New [[Real estate development|developments]] will spring up around the tracks and stations. This permits the player to increase the amount of money that can earn; resulting in the increased ability to build railroad tracks and stations for the growing city. Five scenarios offer a tutorial mode for first-time players, an extremely hard scenario for veterans, and three more scenarios for players in between the two extremes in difficulty levels. Players can play using speeds that range from slow to normal to fast.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==A-Train IV==
Released in December 1993 for the NEC PC-9801, [[FM Towns Marty]], [[Windows 3.1x|Windows 3.1]] and [[Windows 95]].

They scored it 28 out of 40 (average 7 out of 10).&lt;ref name="EGM"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: A-Train |journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=80|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=March 1996|page=30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like Desmond and Sushi-X, ''[[GamePro]]'' felt the game "just doesn't roll with the same FunFactor of other sim games."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=A Train|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=91|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=April 1996|page=88}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' said it was "a quality management title.

==A-Train HX==
{{nihongo|'''''A-Train HX'''''|A列車で行こうHX|A Ressha de Ikou HX}} is a [[Train simulator|railroad simulation]] for the [[Xbox 360]] and Windows.  It was released on December 21, 2006, supporting [[High-definition television#High-definition display resolutions|high definition graphics]] (720p resolution) and [[Xbox Live]] support for uploading and downloading maps and leaderboards. It is also the first title published by [[Artdink]] under the ''A-Train'' name on the Japanese market.

The gameplay is similar to ''A-Train 7'', but it has a full 3D view that was previously used in A-Train The 21st Century. However, it comes with map editor as a standard feature. Custom maps can be shared through Xbox Live. Additional Xbox Live features includes leaderboards which contain "Total Capital", "Population" and "Time to 1 Trillion Yen" categories for each map. The Xbox Live features can be used with an Xbox Live Silver account.

Artdink offered over 150 types of trains for sale in [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], based on real-life Japanese trains. The game itself comes with the following trains designed by Artdink: AR3 (Commuter), AR4 (Express), AR5 (LimitedExpress), AR7 (LimitedExpress), ARX (LimitedExpress), U-Shape (Subway), DC4 (Cargo), EC6 (CargoExpress), 186Exp (SuperExpress), Linear (SuperExpress). Before the release of Taiwan version, publisher TTIME Technology held a paper train model contest for winning the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ttime.com.tw/game/a8/a8-1215.htm 鐵道紙模型比賽圓滿落幕！]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Academic Competition''' (more commonly called by students '''ACE''', '''AC''', or "A-Team") is a program sponsored by the [[Winston-Salem/Forsyth County Schools|Winston-Salem/Forsyth County School District]]. Academic Competition features high school students from the 10 schools across the county in weekly competition. The program was first created in 1989 to promote a higher level of learning among students as well as provide a means of interaction between the different schools' intellectual elite.  Mount Tabor High School won the inaugural competition in 1989, defeating regular season champion R.J. Reynolds High School in the tournament finals.

==Rules==
The rules of Academic Competition, which may seem complex at first, are quite simple to understand. Academic teams are made up of four members. A match consists of five rounds, each with of four sets of questions. The order of the rounds is always the same:
*'''English Round''', containing questions on classic literature and, occasionally, grammar.
*'''Mathematics Round''', containing questions covering geometry, algebra, calculus, and statistics.
*'''Science Round''', containing questions covering biology, anatomy, chemistry, physics, and environmental sciences.
*'''Social Studies Round''', containing questions covering world history, United States history, minority firsts, United States government, geography, and current events.
*'''General Knowledge Round''', containing a wide variety of topics including music, current events, religion, art, and North Carolina.

A set of questions begins with a ''toss-up''. This question is read aloud by a designated mediator. If a student thinks that he or she knows the answer to the question, that student can buzz in and state their guess. If the answer is correct, they win five points and get the first ''directed'' question. If it is incorrect, and the student buzzed in after the moderator had finished reading the question, then the team is not penalized and the other team has a chance to guess. If neither team gets the answer, then the correct answer is read and a new toss-up question is given. A student can buzz in at any time, even before the moderator has finished reading the question. This is called an ''interruption''. If the interruption is correct, the team earns five points as they would normally. However, if the interruption is incorrect, the team is deducted five points and the other team has a chance to guess.

After a toss-up has been correctly answered, the game moves into the directed phase. Here, students are asked specific questions with either two, 
three, four, or six parts. The students have thirty seconds to talk to each other before the team captain must give the team's answers. Points are awarded depending upon how many parts of the question were answered correctly. If all parts are correct, twelve points are given. Semi-correct responses are awarded points based on the number of parts. In a two-part question, each part is worth six points (6 + 6 = 12). In a three-part question, each part is worth four points (4 + 4 + 4 = 12). In a four-part question, each part is worth three points (3 + 3 + 3 + 3 = 12). In a six-part question, each part is worth two points (2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 2 = 12). If the team answers no part of the question correctly, no points are awarded. The correct answers for any/all missed parts are then read. Following this, the opposing team has a directed question of their own. The second question is often harder, yet similar in subject. For instance, if the first team was asked a four-part question asking who said four different quotes, the second team would also be asked a four-part question asking for the speakers of quotes, but their quotes might be more obscure. When the second team has finished, the set of questions is over. The process then repeats again with another toss-up question. After four of these sets of questions, the round is over. The match concludes at the end of the General Knowledge round. The winner of the match is the team with the higher total score, which includes the scores from all five rounds. If the teams tie, the match concludes with a "sudden death toss-up" in which the match is won by the first team to buzz in with the correct answer.

There are a few other rules that apply.
*'''Substitutions''' may be made before any toss-up. When a coach announces a substitution, the match pauses as players from the audience exchange places with those in the match, ring in, and give their names (players who start a round do this at the beginning of the round). There is no limit to the number of players that can be swapped. All four, including the captain, are eligible to be replaced. While a substitution can be made before any question in the round, it can only be used once per team per round.
*Coaches or team captains may '''challenge''' the answer of a question if they believe it to be untrue. When a challenge is called, the coaches of both teams discuss the answer with the judge. Reference and text books may be used for the purpose of proving an answer correct/incorrect. If both coaches agree, points may be awarded to the team that they would have normally won. If they can not come to a consensus, play continues and the score remains the same. A team can only challenge a question for which their answer was counted incorrect; teams cannot challenge a question that their opponents were given credit for. Challenges also can only occur immediately after the question. An answer can not be debated after the game has moved on. However, if a previous challenge is denied, the coach may submit a written challenge after the match and provide additional evidence. Should this evidence prove sufficient, the points in question are awarded after the end of the match, even if it changes the outcome of the round or match. Occasionally, this process does change the outcome, such as in West v. Reynolds in 2006 and East v. Tabor in 2004.

[[Image:2007 A46.PNG|thumb|240px|According to [[Confucius]], "I hear and I forget; I see and I remember; I do and I understand."]]

'''Action learning''' is an approach to solving real-life problems. It involves taking action and reflecting upon the results. This helps improve the problem-solving process as well as simplify the solutions developed by the team&lt;ref&gt;Reynolds, M. (2011) “Reflective Practice: Origins and Interpretations.” ''Action Learning: Research and Practice'', 8(1), 5-13&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Revans, R. W. (1998) ''ABC of action learning''. London: Lemos and Crane&lt;/ref&gt;. 

The theory of action learning and its epistemological position were originally developed by Reg Revans (1982), who applied the method to support organizational and business development initiatives and improve on problem solving efforts.

The action learning process includes:

# a real problem that is important, critical, and usually complex,
# a diverse problem-solving team or "set",
# a process that promotes curiosity, inquiry, and reflection,
# a requirement that talk be converted into action and, ultimately, a solution, and
# a commitment to learning. 

In most forms of action learning, a coach is included and is responsible for promoting and facilitating learning, as well as encouraging the team to be self-managing. 

Since action learning has proven to be very effective in developing a number of individual leadership and team problem-solving skills&lt;ref&gt;Michael Marquardt , Ng Choon Seng , and Helen Goodson. (2010). "Team Development via Action Learning," ''Advances in Developing Human Resources'', SAGE Publications, pp. 241-255&lt;/ref&gt;, it has become a component in corporate and organizational leadership development programs. This strategy is different from the "one size fits all" curriculum that is characteristic of many training and development programs.

==Revans' formula==
[[Reginald Revans]] is the originator of action learning.&lt;ref&gt;Boshyk, Y. and Dilworth, R.L. (eds) (2010). ''Action Learning: History and Evolution''. Basingstoke, U.K.: Palgrave&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Denise O’Leary, Paul Coughlan, Clare Rigg and David Coghlan. (2017). "Turning to case studies as a mechanism for learning in action learning." ''Action Learning: Research and Practice'', 14, 1, (3)&lt;/ref&gt; Revans' formative influences included his experience training as a physicist at the University of Cambridge.  In his encounters with this talented group of scientists – several went on to win Nobel prizes – he noted the importance of each scientist describing their own ignorance, sharing experiences, and communally reflecting to learn.&lt;ref&gt;Trehan, Kiran and Pedler, Mike. Cultivating foresight and innovation in action learning: reflecting ourselves; reflection with others. ''Action Learning: Research and Practice''. Vol. 8, No. 1, 1-4. March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; He used these experiences to further develop the method in the 1940s while working for the [[National Coal Board|Coal Board]] in United Kingdom. Here, he encouraged managers to meet together in small groups, to share their experiences and ask each other questions about what they saw and heard. The approach increased [[productivity]] by over 30%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ils.salford.ac.uk/library/resources/special/revans.pdf|title=The Library  - The Library  - University of Salford, Manchester|first=University of Salford|last=Manchester|date=January 2003|website=www.ils.Salford.ac.uk|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in hospitals, he concluded that the conventional instructional methods were largely ineffective.
&lt;blockquote&gt;People had to be aware of their lack of relevant knowledge and be prepared to explore the area of their ignorance with suitable questions and help from other people in similar positions.&lt;/blockquote&gt;{{Cite quote|date=May 2017}}

Later, Revans made this more precise in the opening chapter of his book (Revans, 1980) which describes the formula:

&lt;math&gt;L = P + Q&lt;/math&gt;

where '''L''' is [[learning]], '''P''' is programming and '''Q''' is [[question]]ing to create insight into what people see, hear or feel.

'''Q''' uses :
* "closed" questions:
** who?
** what?
* "objective" questions:
** how much or how many?
* "relative" questions:
** where
** when
* "open questions
** why?
** how?

Although Q is the cornerstone of the method, the more relaxed formulation has enabled action learning to become widely accepted in many countries all over the world. In Revans' book there are examples from the United States, Canada, Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and Asia-Pacific.

International Management Centres, the action learning professional association where Revans was inaugural president, have proposed extension to this formula with the addition of ''R'' for "reflection". This has also been proposed by Michael Marquardt:

L = P + Q + R .&lt;ref&gt;Marquardt, M., Leonard, H. S., Freedman, A., &amp; Hill, C. (2009). ''Action learning for developing leaders and organizations: Principles, strategies, and cases''. Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this expanded equation, ''R'' refers to reflection.  This additional element emphasizes the point that "great questions" should evoke thoughtful reflections while considering the current problem, the desired goal, designing strategies, developing action or implementation plans, or executing action steps that are components of the implementation plan.

The proven power{{citation needed|date=January 2015}} of the action learning process originates in its theoretical underpinnings (Waddill &amp; Marquardt, 2003).  Waddill and Marquardt demonstrate the link between adult learning theory and Marquardt's action learning approach in their article entitled "Adult Learning Orientations and Action Learning".

==Use in organizations==
Today, action learning is practised by a wide community of businesses, governments, non-profits, and educational institutions.

Writers on the subject have included Mike Pedler, Alan Mumford and Richard Hale in the United Kingdom &amp; Australia, Yury Boshyk in Canada, Garry Luxmore in Australia. Ng Choon Seng in Singapore, Ira Cohen and Kevin Hao in China, and Michael Marquardt, Skipton Leonard, Arthur Freedman, Robert Kramer, and Joe Raelin, and Dr. Verna Willis (a pioneer in action learning and co-author with Robert L. Dilworth, as well as an award recipient with the Annual Global Forum on Action Learning in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;http://globalforum-actionlearning.com/index.php/gobal-forum-lex-dilworth-award/global-forum-award-recipients/2009-award-recipeints&lt;/ref&gt;

Action learning is being applied using the Action Learning Question Method (Hale) to support organisational development (OD) capability development across central government in the UK Civil Service supported by OD specialists Mayvin (Hale &amp; Saville, 2014). As such this is combining action learning with organisational development as reported at the 2014 Ashridge Action Learning Conference and Action Learning: Research and Practice, October, 2014.

An action learning approach has been recognized as a valuable means of supporting the Continuing Professional Development of professionals in emerging professions.  The Action Learning Question approach has been applied with, for instance the emerging professional field of global outsourcing as reported by Hale ('Actual Professional Development', Training Journal,2012).  This supports the idea that powerful learning can occur at the boundaries of organizations as proposed by Wenger in his work on 'Communities of Practice'.

Organizations may also use action learning in the virtual environment (Waddill, Action E-Learning, Human Resource Development International, 2006).  This is a cost effective solution that enables the widespread use of action learning at all levels of an organization.  Action e-Learning (AEL) – as defined and implemented by Waddill (2004) – provides a viable alternative for organizations interested in adapting the action learning process for online delivery with groups where the members are not co-located.

==ARL, MiL and WIAL models==
As with other educational processes, practitioners have built on Revans' pioneering work and have adapted some tenets to accommodate their needs. One such branch of action learning is [[Action Reflection Learning]] (ARL), which originated in Sweden among educators and consultants under the guidance of Lennart Rohlin of the MiL Institute in the 1970s. With the so-called “MiL model”, ARL gained momentum with the work of LIM, Leadership in International Management, under the leadership of Ernie Turner in the USA. The WIAL (World Institute for Action Learning) Model was developed by Michael Marquardt, Skipton Leonard, Bea Carson and Arthur Freedman.

The main differences between Revans’ approach to action learning and the ‘MiL Model’ in the ‘80s are :
# the role of a project team advisor (later called Learning Coach), which Revans had reservations about;
# the use of team projects rather than individual challenges;
# the duration of the sessions, which is more flexible in ARL designs.

The MiL Model evolved organically as practitioners responded to diverse needs and restrictions. In an experiential learning mode, MiL practitioners varied the number and duration of the sessions, the type of project selected, the role of the Learning Coach and the style of his/her interventions.

ARL evolved organically through the choices and savvy intuitions of practitioners, who informally exchanged their experiences with each other. It became a somewhat shared practice, which incorporated elements of design and intervention that the practitioners adopted because of their efficacy. In 2004, Isabel Rimanoczy researched and codified the ARL methodology, identifying 16 elements and 10 underlying principles.

The WIAL Model incorporates six elements: (1) problem or challenge, (2) group of 4-8 members, (3) reflective inquiry, (4) development and implementation of strategies and actions, (5)individual, group and organizational learning, and (6)an action learning coach. The model starts with 2 simple ground rules that ensure that statements follow and are related to questions and provide the authority for the coach to promote learning. Team members may develop additional ground rules, norms, and roles as they deem necessary or advantageous. Addressing Revans' concern that a coach's over-involvement in the problem-solving process will engender dependency, WIAL coaches only ask questions that encourage team members to reflect on the team's behavior (what is working, can be improved, or done differently) in efforts to improve learning and, ultimately, performance.

=="Unlearning" as a prerequisite for "learning"==
Robert Kramer (2007a, 2007b, 2008) pioneered the use of action learning for officials in the U.S. government, and at the European Commission in Brussels and Luxembourg. He also introduced action learning to scientists at the European Environment Agency in Copenhagen and to officials of the Estonian government at the State Chancellery (Prime Minister's Office) in Tallinn, Estonia.

The process of learning more creative ways of thinking, feeling, and being is achieved in action learning by reflecting on what is working now and as well as on actions that can be improved. Action learning is consistent with the principles of positive psychology (Seligman and Csikszentmihalyi, 2000) and appreciative inquiry (Cooperrider and Whitney, 2001) by encouraging team/set members to build on strengths and learn from life's challenges. In action learning, there is no need to unlearn what has worked in the past. Reflecting on what has not worked helps team/set members unlearn what doesn't work and invent better ways of acting going forward.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

Unlike other writers in the field of action learning, Kramer applies the theory of art, creativity and "unlearning" of the psychologist [[Otto Rank]] to his practice of action learning.  Rank was the first to see therapy as a learning and unlearning experience.  The therapeutic relationship allows the patient to: (1) learn more creative ways of thinking, feeling and being in the here-and-now; and (2) unlearn self-destructive ways of thinking, feeling and being in the here-and-now.  Patterns of self-destruction ("neurosis") represent a failure of creativity, not, as Freud assumed, a retreat from sexuality.

In action learning questions allow group members to "step out of the frame of the prevailing ideology", as Otto Rank wrote in ''Art and Artist'' (1932/1989, p.&amp;nbsp;70), reflect on their assumptions and beliefs, and reframe their choices. The process of "stepping out" of a frame, out of a form of knowing – a prevailing ideology – is analogous to the work of artists as they struggle to give birth to fresh ways of seeing the world, perspectives that allow them to see aspects of the world that no artists, including themselves, have ever seen before.

The most creative artists, such as Rembrandt, Michelangelo and Leonardo, know how to separate even from their own greatest public successes, from earlier artistic incarnations of themselves. Their “greatness consists precisely in this reaching out beyond themselves, beyond the ideology which they have themselves fostered,” according to ''Art and Artist'' (Rank, 1932/1989, p.&amp;nbsp;368). Through the lens of Otto Rank’s work on understanding art and artists, action learning can be seen as the never-completed process of learning how to “step out of the frame” of the ruling mindset, whether one’s own or the culture’s – in other words, of learning how to unlearn.

Comparing the process of unlearning to the “breaking out” process of birth, Otto Rank was the first psychologist to suggest that a continual capacity to separate from “internal mental objects” – from internalized institutions, beliefs and assumptions; from the restrictions of culture, social conformity and received wisdom – is the sine qua non-for lifelong creativity.

Unlearning necessarily involves separation from one’s self-concept, as it has been culturally conditioned to conform to familial, group, occupational or organizational allegiances. According to Rank (1932/1989), unlearning or breaking out of our shell from the inside is “a separation [that] is so hard, not only because it involves persons and ideas that one reveres, but because the victory is always, at bottom, and in some form, won over a part of one’s ego” (p.&amp;nbsp;375).

In the organizational context, learning how to unlearn is vital because what we assume to be true has merged into our identity. We refer to the identity of an individual as a “mindset.” We refer to the identity of an organizational group as a “culture.” Action learners learn how to question, probe and separate from, both kinds of identity—i.e., their “individual” selves and their “social” selves. By opening themselves to critical inquiry, they begin to learn how to emancipate themselves from what they "know" – they learn how to unlearn. 

There is also an emerging, radical approach to unlearning in the areas of critical action learning (CAR). According to [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269775428_Unlearning_critical_action_learning_and_wicked_problems Pedler and Hsu (2014)], Chokr's (2009) concept of unlearning has an important implication for critical action learning because it questions the predominant cultural tendency that see learning as an unquestionable good. [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269775428_Unlearning_critical_action_learning_and_wicked_problems Peder and Hsu (2014)] further connect the idea of unlearning to some ancient forms of wisdom such as Taoism (Hsu, 2013).

==Role of facilitator, coach and questions==
An ongoing challenge of action learning has been to take productive action as well as to take the time necessary to capture the learning that result from reflecting on the results of taking action. Usually, the urgency of the problem or task decreases or eliminates the reflective time necessary for learning. As a consequence, more and more organizations have recognized the critical importance of an action learning coach or facilitator in the process, someone who has the authority and responsibility of creating time and space for the group to learn at the individual, group and organizational level.

There is controversy, however, about the need for an action learning coach.  Reg Revans was sceptical about the use of learning coaches and, in general, of interventionist approaches. He believed the action learning set or group could practice action learning on its own. He also had a major concern that too much process facilitation would lead a group to become dependent on a coach or facilitator. Nevertheless, later in his development of the action learning method, Revans experimented with including a role that he described as a "supernumerary" that had many similarities to that of a facilitator or coach (Revans, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;9). Revans, like many other action learning practitioners, noted that without someone dedicated to managing basic process norms as well as championing individual, team, and organizational learning, action learning often devolved into lots of action without much learning.

Pedler distills Revans' thinking about the key role of the action learning facilitator as follows:

(i) The initiator or “accoucheur”: "No organisation is likely to embrace action learning unless there is some person within it ready to fight on its behalf. ......This useful intermediary we may call the accoucheur - the managerial midwife who sees that their organisation gives birth to a new idea... ". (Revans, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;101)

(ii) The set facilitator or “combiner”:
“there may be a need when it (the set) is first formed for some supernumerary ...
brought into speed the integration of the set ....” but “Such a combiner ....... must contrive that it (the set) achieves independence of them at the earliest possible moment...”  (Revans, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;9).

(iii) The facilitator of organizational learning or the “learning community” organiser:
“The most precious asset of any organization is the one most readily overlooked: its capacity to build upon its lived experience, to learn from its challenges and to turn in a better performance by inviting all and sundry to work out for themselves what that performance ought to be.” (Revans, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;120)

Hale (2003a, 2003b, 2004) suggested that the facilitator role developed by Revans (2011) be incorporated into any standards for action learning facilitation accreditation. Hale also suggests the action learning faciltator role includes the functions of mobiliser, learning set adviser, and learning catalyst (Hale, 2012). To increase the reflective, learning aspect of action learning, many groups now adopt the practice or norm of focusing on questions rather than statements while working on the problem and developing strategies and actions.  Questions focus discussion and encourage the group to listen, to become a cohesive team more quickly, and to generate creative, out-of-the-box thinking.

Self-managed action learning (Bourner et al., 2002; O'Hara et al., 2004) is a variant of action learning that dispenses with the need for a facilitator of the action learning set. Shurville and Rospigliosi (2009) have explored using virtual action learning to promote self-management by the team. Deborah Waddill (2003) has developed guidelines for virtual action learning teams, what she calls action e-learning.

There are a number of problems, however, with pure self-managed teams (i.e., with no coach). Wellins, Byham, &amp; Wilson (1991) have noted that self-managing teams (such as task forces) seldom take the time to reflect on what they are doing or make efforts to identify key lessons learned from the process. Without reflection, team members are likely to import organizational or sub-unit cultural norms and familiar problem solving practices into the problem-solving process without explicitly testing their validity and utility. Team members employ assumptions, mental models, and beliefs about methods or processes that are seldom openly challenged, much less tested. As a result, teams often apply traditional problem solving methods to non-traditional, urgent, critical, and discontinuous problems. In addition, team members often "leap" from the initial problem statement to some form of brainstorming that they assume will produce a viable solution. These suggested solutions typically provoke objections, doubts, concerns, or reservations from other team members who advocate their own preferred solutions. The conflicts that ensue are generally both unproductive and time-consuming. As a result, self-managed teams, tend to split or fragment rather than develop and evolve into a cohesive, high-performing team.

Because of these typical characteristics of self-managing teams, many theorists and practitioners (c.f., Marquardt, Leonard, Freedman, and Hill, 2009) have argued that real and effective self-management in action learning requires coaches with the authority to intervene whenever they perceive an opportunity to promote learning or improve team performance. Without this team role, there is no assurance that the team will make the time needed for the periodic, systemic, and strategic inquiry and reflection that is necessary for effective individual, team, and organizational learning.

==Events, forums and conferences==
A number of organizations sponsor events focusing on the implementation and improvement of action learning. These include ''The Journal of Action Learning: Research &amp; Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=[Homepage] |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/toc/calr20/current |journal=Action Learning: Research and Practice |volume=14 |issue=2  |access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the World Institute of Action Learning Global Forum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wial.org|title=World Institute for Action Learning - Only Certifying Body for Action Learning|author=|date=|website=WIAL|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; International Foundation for Action Learning events,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ifal.org.uk|title=International Foundation for Action Learning – IFAL|author=|date=|website=www.IFAL.org.uk|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Global Forum on Executive Development and Business Driven Action Learning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.globalforum-actionlearning.com|title=Global Forum - Action Learning (homepage) |publisher=Global Executive Learning |access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Action Learning, Action Research Association World Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alara.net.au|title=Welcome to ALARA |publisher=ALARA|access-date=28 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; LinkedIn interest groups devoted to action learning include WIAL Network, Action Learning Forum, International Foundation for Action Learning, Global Forum on Business Driven Action Learning and Executive Development, Learning Thru Action, and Action Research and Learning in Organizations.

'''Arden University''' is a private, [[For-profit education|for-profit]] university in the United Kingdom. It offers a variety of undergraduate and post-graduate programmes with both [[blended learning|blended]] and online [[distance learning]] delivery options. Its head office is in [[Coventry]] with study centres in [[Birmingham]], [[Manchester]], and London. Originally established as Resource Development International (RDI) in 1990, it was later bought by [[Capella Education]] and awarded university status by the British government in 2015. Since August 2016 it has been owned by [[Global University Systems]].

==History==
Resource Development International (RDI), the forerunner of Arden University, was established in 1990 by the [[Coventry]]-based entrepreneur John Holden. RDI originally provided distance learning programmes for commercial and industrial clients and established several subsidiary operations in the USA, Europe, Africa, and the Far East. By 2010, it had closed most of its foreign subsidiaries and had expanded to include distance learning degrees validated by several UK universities. Its motto was "Learning without Boundaries". In 2011, Holden sold the company and its remaining subsidiaries to the US-based [[Capella Education]] and went on to develop an online business school based in Coventry.&lt;ref&gt;[[s.n.]] (3 October 2014).

[[File:Resource Development International logo in 2015.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|left|RDI's logo in 2015]]
RDI was granted taught degree awarding powers in April 2014 and the following year was awarded university status. It relaunched as Arden University in August 2015. Arden was the first distance learning university to launch in the UK since the founding of the [[Open University]] in 1969 and the third of three for-profit universities created under the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] government's drive to increase competition in the UK university sector. The previous two were the [[University of Law]] in 2012 and [[BPP University]] in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Morgan, John (5 August 2015).

From January 2016, the previous externally validated degree programmes under RDI were gradually phased out and replaced by Arden's own degree programmes. In November 2017 Arden University had an enrollment of 5,700 students, of whom 2,500 were enrolled in the university's own programmes. Approximately 44% of its students were based outside the UK.&lt;ref name = "QAA" /&gt;

'''''Astronomy Cast''''' is an educational [[nonprofit]] [[podcast]] discussing various topics in the field of [[astronomy]]. The specific subject matter of each episode shifts from week to week, ranging from planets and stars to cosmology and mythbusting. The show is co-hosted by the editor of the space and astronomy news site [[Universe Today]] [[Fraser Cain]] and [[Southern Illinois University Edwardsville]] astronomy professor [[Pamela L. Gay|Dr. Pamela L. Gay]] and premiered on September 10, 2006. Each show usually has a length of approximately 30 minutes and all shows, past and present, are accessible for download through the [http://www.astronomycast.com/archive/ Astronomy Cast archive].

The [http://www.astronomycast.com/ Astronomy Cast official website] also hosts the blog [http://www.astronomycast.com/LIVE/ Astronomy Cast LIVE], which covers select astronomy meetings using various bloggers, including Fraser Cain, Dr. Pamela L. Gay, and [[Phil Plait]] as well as recent astronomy-related news and events. A public [[Internet forum|forum]], the [https://web.archive.org/web/20080526084000/http://www.bautforum.com/astronomy-cast/ Astronomy Cast Forum], where registered members and site visitors may share and exchange valuable information can also be found on the website and is created under [http://www.bautforum.com/ Bad Astronomer and Universe Today Forum].

This podcast has been continuously featured by [[iTunes]] in the ''[[Science]] &amp; [[Medicine]]'' section for its high popularity as well as its excellent listener rating of 5 out of 5 possible stars and is currently ranked #6 &lt;ref name="rank"&gt;[http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewTop?id=21078&amp;popId=3 iTunes Store - Natural Sciences Podcasts Category - Top Podcasts (Opens in iTunes If Available)]&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Natural Sciences]] podcasts category. The renown of this series has grown rapidly in the past few months and the total number of its listeners stands around 30,000.

==Mission==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Astronomy Cast takes a fact based journey through the cosmos as it offers listeners weekly discussions on astronomical topics ranging from planets to cosmology. Hosted by Fraser Cain (Universe Today) and Dr. Pamela L. Gay (SIUE), this show brings the questions of an avid astronomy lover direct to an astronomer. Together Fraser and Pamela explore what is known and being discovered about the universe around us.'' &lt;ref name="Mission"&gt;[http://www.astronomycast.com/about/ Astronomy Cast - About Us]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Format==
Labeled as ''"a fact-based journey through the cosmos"'' that aims to help the listeners understand ''"not only what we know, but how we know what we know"'', the show offers a large amount of information in the form of a mutual conversation between the two co-hosts, with more resources and show notes available on the show's website to aid the listeners in their attempt to understand the material covered. Several "enhanced" podcast episodes accompanied by pictures have also been released, but this experiment was terminated due to the large file size associated with the pictures and small number of downloads compared to the regular format. (These are still available for download.)

There are also episodes in which listeners' questions are answered. Initially the question shows were produced irregularly (ten shows as of September 2008), but as the number of questions received increased a question show will be released weekly when possible. The hosts have also experimented with ''student questions shows'' where they have sent recording equipment to schools who have requested it. The students have then recorded questions to ask the hosts, which are then answered and edited into a special show available separately on the Astronomy Cast website.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronomycast.com/category/listeners/student-questions/&lt;/ref&gt; As of June 2008 two shows have been done in this format, and this ongoing project has been sponsored by [[National Aeronautic and Space Administration|NASA]]'s [[Gamma-ray Large Area Space Telescope]].

Astronomy Cast has covered a wide variety of topics ranging from the planets in our solar system to the end of the universe, from the big bang to black holes. All previous episodes can be downloaded from the Astronomy Cast website archive in [[MP3]] format or through major pod-catching [[software]] such as [[Apple Inc.]]'s [[iTunes]] for [[iPods]] and other portable media players.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.astronomycast.com/archive/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Audience==
The listeners of Astronomy Cast vary widely in demographics, but the vast majority is between the ages of 18 and 53 according to a conducted survey. It is believed that the lack of young listeners is caused by the fact that Astronomy Cast may prove slightly too advanced for a younger audience and that the shortage of older listeners is due to the generation's relative infamiliarity with technology and portable devices.&lt;ref name="Survey"&gt;[http://www.capjournal.org/issues/01/01_24.php Astronomy Cast: Evaluation of a podcast audience's content needs and listening habits]&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although Astronomy Cast is aimed at both the male and female audiences, only about 9% of the listeners are female.&lt;ref name="Survey" /&gt;

==Milestones==
On August 4, 2008 the 100th Astronomy Cast podcast was produced. As of December 2016, Astronomy Cast has produced over 400 podcasts. 

Astronomy Cast was nominated for the Technology/Science section of the 2008 [[People's Choice Podcast Awards]] &lt;ref name="People's Choice Podcast Awards 2008"&gt;{{Citation|title=People's Choice Podcast Awards |url=http://www.podcastawards.com/ |accessdate=2008-10-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140527093834/http://www.podcastawards.com/ |archivedate=May 27, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14434">The '''Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program''', or '''CELPIP''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɛ|l|p|ɪ|p}}), is an English [[language assessment]] tool which measures [[listening]], [[Reading (process)|reading]], [[writing]], and [[speaking]] skills. The test is administered by Paragon Testing Enterprises.,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.paragontesting.ca/english-language-tests/|title = English Language Tests|date = |accessdate = 2015-09-23|website = www.paragontesting.ca|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; a subsidiary of the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC). Paragon is the only Canadian company delivering [[Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] (IRCC) designated English proficiency tests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.celpiptest.ca/celpip-preparation-program/|title=CELPIP Preparation Program - CELPIPTest.ca|website=CELPIPTest.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CELPIP test is offered in two versions, CELPIP-General, and CELPIP-General LS.

CELPIP-General is suitable for people who need proof of English-language skills when applying for permanent resident status in [[Canada]] under the [[Federal Skilled Worker Program]] (FSWP), [[Federal Skilled Trades Program]] (FSTP), [[Canadian experience class|Canadian Experience Class]] (CEC), [[Start-up Visa Program]], and various [[Provincial Nominee Programs]], or for [[employment]]. [[Department of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship|Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada]] has two approved English language tests: CELPIP-General and [[International English Language Testing System|IELTS]] General Training Test: International English Language Testing System.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Where can I take a third-party language test for my immigration application?|url = http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=125&amp;t=6|website = www.cic.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Do I need a language test to immigrate to Canada?|url = http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?q=638&amp;t=6|website = www.cic.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-10-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CELPIP-General LS is suitable for people who need proof of listening and speaking proficiency for [[Canadian citizenship]]. The CELPIP-General LS Test is accepted by IRCC as one of only two designated English language tests for Canadian citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Acceptable language proof to apply for citizenship wizard|url = http://www.cic.gc.ca/english/citizenship/language-step-6.asp|website = www.cic.gc.ca|accessdate = 2015-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2015, with the acquisition of the [[Canadian Academic English Language Assessment|Canadian Academic English Language]] (CAEL) Assessment, Paragon Testing Enterprises retired the CELPIP-Academic Test.

== CELPIP Test Types ==
[[File:CELPIP General Logo.jpg|CELPIP-General logo|border|right]]

=== CELPIP-General ===
The CELPIP-General Test assesses a general level of English-language proficiency. The CELPIP-General Test is accepted as proof of English language proficiency for those applying for [[Permanent residency in Canada|Canadian Permanent Residency]] and to the [[Association of Saskatchewan Realtors|Association of Saskatchewan REALTORS (ASR)]].

The forms of identification that are acceptable for CELPIP-General test registrations are: 
* a [[Passport]] Booklet
* [[Refugee]] Protection Claimant Document*
* [[Travel document|Travel Document]]*
&lt;nowiki&gt;*&lt;/nowiki&gt;Refugee Protection Claimant Documents and Travel Documents must be preapproved by Paragon Testing Enterprises.

=== CELPIP-General LS ===
[[File:CELPIP-General LS logo.jpg|CELPIP-General LS logo|border|right|204x204px]]The CELPIP-General LS Test assesses a general level of English-language proficiency. The CELPIP-General LS Test is accepted by Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) as a measure of listening and speaking proficiency for those applying for Canadian citizenship.

In June 2015, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) implemented the remaining changes to the Citizenship Act. One important change is that applicants between the ages of 14 and 64 must now meet basic language requirements in listening and speaking in English or French. For minors who are between the ages of 14 and 17, registrations for the CELPIP-General LS Test are accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.celpiptest.ca/2015/07/registration-for-minors/|title=Registration for Test Takers Under 18|date=2015-07-30|website=CELPIPTest.ca|language=en-US|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Comenius Foundation for  Child Development''', or   '''Comenius Foundation''' for short (Polish: ''Fundacja Rozwoju Dzieci im. Komeńskiego'', or ''Fundacja Komeńskiego''), is a children's welfare [[non-governmental organisation]] based in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], established in September 2003.  The Foundation's goal is to provide equal educational opportunities to children aged 3–5 years, particularly in rural areas of high unemployment, in response to a dramatic decline in [[preschool education]] services in Poland.  Only 38% of children aged 3–5 attended [[kindergarten|pre-school]], which means that some 750,000 children in this age group is left out of pre-school care.  In rural areas the attendance figure is below 10%. This is the lowest result in the whole [[European Union]].

The Foundation  organises and conducts training for teachers, school and kindergarten headmasters, teachers and local educational authorities.

The Foundation's "Where There Are No Pre-schools" programme aims at helping rural communities  to develop new models for early-childhood education, based on local financial resources.  A pilot scheme was set up in 28  rural [[gmina|communities]], where 75  Early Childhood Education Centres  have been set up, with over 800 children.  Educational activities are  provided by teachers  trained by the Comenius Foundation to use the project approach in the classroom. The local authorities cover the costs of the teachers' salaries and the premises, whereas the Foundation is responsible for financing the teacher training, monitoring the quality of teaching and setting up local libraries. An external evaluation of the programme, commissioned by the Foundation, will enable modification while the programme is being implemented.

'''Cultural Detective''' is designed to improve conditions and [[productivity]] in an [[international]] or [[multicultural]] environment. As an [[intercultural competence]] tool, it is designed to lessen [[stereotyping]] and improve [[dialogue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://business.in.com/article/thunderbird/cultural-detective-avoid-crosscultural-trial-by-fire/17962/1|title=Avoid cross-cultural trial by fire|author=Kris Bibler|date=Oct 4, 2010|work=Business India}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural Detective, while it is a registered trademark of a single business entity{{which|date=October 2016}}, it is also a project involving around 130 professionals from various places in the world.

The approach has been used on a proprietary basis by multinationals and NGOs in various locations around the world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/hr/story/tools-to-develop-your-employees-intercultural-skills-25406.html|title=Tools to develop your employees' intercultural skills|date=November 17, 2005|author=Eleonore Breukel|website=Expatica.com|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709053051/http://www.expatica.com/hr/story/tools-to-develop-your-employees-intercultural-skills-25406.html|archivedate=July 9, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; since 1989, and has been publicly available since 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|date=May 2006|url=http://www.culturaldetective.com/humancapital.html|title=Product launch: Developing cross-cultural competence|author=Dr. Madhukar Shukla|publisher=Human Capital Magazine|location=India|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130212034306/http://www.culturaldetective.com/humancapital.html|archivedate=February 12, 2013|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes a series of culture- and topic-specific{{clarify|date=October 2016}} available via [[site license]] or online download. A [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UegICR2zMdk video] describes the core process.{{clarify|date=October 2016}}

Cultural Detective focuses on developing three capacities in its participants: 
# Know yourself as an individual and as a being made of influences of multiple cultures – Understand your (own) Subjective Culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|year=2009|url=http://www.culturaldetective.com/toolkitcurran.pdf|title=Cultural Detective: A tool for global diversity and inclusion practices|author=Kathleen Curran|work=Linkage Diversity Toolbox|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425021436/http://www.culturaldetective.com/toolkitcurran.pdf|archivedate=April 25, 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Get to know others as individuals and as beings made of influences of multiple cultures – Acquire Cultural Literacy.
# Fully include, utilize and appreciate everyone involved, with their similarities and differences as assets. Make sure systems and processes support interpersonal skills – Be a Cultural Bridge.

These capacities are developed through the Worksheet,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatriateconnect.com/news/building-cultural-bridges-how-to-attain-a-cultural-education|title=Building cultural bridges-How to attain a cultural education|author=Karen Huchendorf|work=ExpatriateCONNECT}}&lt;/ref&gt; used to analyze the series' 1000+ critical incidents involving people from various cultures, industries and professional functions. The Worksheet is used for real-time [[conflict resolution]] and [[team-building]], as well as an individual's journal to analyze one's own life experiences. There is also discussion of values, both from various cultures and from examination of one's own set of values.

== Theoretical underpinnings ==
The Cultural Detective method is theoretically grounded yet practical, allowing for success because it focuses on the differences that make a difference in real situations. Theoretical concepts inherent in the method include: 
# [[Culture]] is a Lens that colors nearly everything we see, say and do, and the decisions we make. It largely dictates how we make meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcc.gatech.edu/~herrington/classes/4406f2000/barnlund.html|title=Communication in a Global Village|author=Dean Barnlund|work=Georgia Tech}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Culture is an ever-changing dynamic not a static entity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://cap.sagepub.com/content/7/3/283.short|title=Culture As Patterns: An Alternative Approach to the Problem of Reification|authors=G Adams &amp; HR Markus|journal=Culture and Psychology|volume=7|number=3|pages=283–296|doi=10.1177/1354067X0173002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6338">'''Daisy B. Ba-ad''' is a playwright, stage director, composer, [[motivational speaker]] and [[life coach]] based in [[Cebu City]], Philippines. She is a Masscom graduate of [[St. Theresa's College, Cebu City]] given a special award for Outstanding Performance in Theater Arts. She is known to be at the forefront of keeping [[Cebuano theater|Cebuano Theater]] alive.  Trained under professional directors Laurice Guillen, [[Gina Alajar]], Leo Martinez and New York acting coach [[Eric Morris (actor)|Eric Morris]], she is currently artistic and training director of Out of the Box Training and Productions. She also designed and mentored the Photographic/Commercial Modeling program of [https://web.archive.org/web/20081018184102/http://www.ftv.com.ph/modelschool/ftv_modelschool_mentors_baad.html Fashion TV Model School] based in the city.

Her most popular original Cebuano musical entitled ''Tall Tales Kuno!'', grant awardee of the [[National Commission for Culture and the Arts (Philippines)]] under their program for Artistic Excellence, has been staged by various organizations in Cebu. Her most recent directorial work is an original musical in English written by Jude Gitamondoc entitled [[Siddhartha (musical)|Siddhartha: A Musical Journey to Enlightenment]] produced by Buddha's Light International Association - Cebu Chapter. Its successful run at the Waterfront Pacific Ballroom, on June 6, 2007, and at the main theater of the [[Cultural Center of the Philippines]], on November 3 and 4, 2007, has paved the way for the production to be brought to Taiwan touring the cities of Taipei and Kaoshiung. Plans are underway for the Siddhartha musical to be toured in Europe, the USA, Australia and Beijing China.

Her latest directorial job was Zephryin Namuncura: The Musical, written by Jude Gitamondoc, for Don Bosco Cebu in celebration of the beatification of [[Ceferino Namuncura]]. Ba-ad is also known to have successfully used theater games in training programs she has designed for corporate groups. Her clients include Aboitiz Group of Companies, Arts Council of Cebu, Ayala Land, [[ABS-CBN]] Television Cebu, Cebu Holdings Inc., and [[Jollibee]] Foods Corp.

==Background==
Daisy Ba-ad was born in Cebu City, Philippines on March 31, 1961, and is the second to the youngest in a family of nine. Her parents Melda and Domingo Ba-ad already saw the potential in her as a child. She was dubbed as the entertainer of the family at the age of four because of her ability to dance and sing upon request.

Her first exposure to theater began in kindergarten where she played support and lead roles. Her high school days were focused on developing her skills in oration, declamation, acting, singing and song composition. She was awarded a Department Medal upon graduation.

As a freshman in college taking up Mass Communications, she was voted to direct the freshman's entry to the school's Drama Festival with [[Wilfrido Ma. Guerrero]]’s [http://upreplib.tripod.com/chaperon.htm ''Wanted: Chaperon'']. They won five out of six awards including best director and best production - a first in the school's history that the freshman year would win over higher years and winning most of the awards at the same time. 

Daisy became more active in college as she moved on to writing poetry and short skits for class or for official school activities and directed them. She became known as the [[Barbra Streisand]] of the school with her lip synchronization acts of Streisand's Minute Waltz, I'm Five, Jingle Bells and the like. 

She also won declamation and songwriting competitions during her college days. In fact, for two successive years, she brought home the grand prize for the English and Tagalog categories of the Declamation Contest included in Inter-School Annual Literary-Musical Festival in the city. She was later given a scholarship to the Philippine Educational Theater Association's [http://www.petatheater.com/ (PETA)] Integrated Arts Workshop in Manila. She was also offered to be the moderator of the high school drama club while in her sophomore year in college. This event gave her the opportunity to start designing training modules and writing full length plays.

She was the chair of STC Bantawan theater group all throughout college and popularized the "dula-tula" form of Philippine theater in Cebu City.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11974">'''Dual-coding theory''', a theory of cognition, was hypothesized by [[Allan Paivio]] of the University of Western Ontario in 1971. In developing this theory, Paivio used the idea that the formation of mental images [[picture superiority effect|aids]] in learning (Reed, 2010). According to Paivio, there are two ways a person could expand on learned material: verbal associations and visual imagery. Dual-coding theory postulates that both visual and verbal information is used to represent information (Sternberg, 2003). Visual and verbal information are processed differently and along distinct channels in the human mind, creating separate representations for information processed in each channel. The mental codes corresponding to these representations are used to organize incoming information that can be acted upon, stored, and retrieved for subsequent use. Both visual and verbal codes can be used when recalling information (Sternberg, 2003). For example, say a person has stored the stimulus concept "dog" as both the word 'dog' and as the image of a dog. When asked to recall the stimulus, the person can retrieve either the word or the image individually, or both simultaneously. If the word is recalled, the image of the dog is not lost and can still be retrieved at a later point in time. The ability to code a stimulus two different ways increases the chance of remembering that item compared to if the stimulus was only coded one way.

There has been controversy to the limitations of the dual-coding theory. Dual-coding theory does not take into account the possibility of cognition being mediated by something other than words and images. Not enough research has been done to determine if words and images are the only way we remember items, and the theory would not hold true if another form of codes were discovered (Pylyshyn, 1973). Another limitation of the dual-coding theory is that it is only valid for tests on which people are asked to focus on identifying how concepts are related (Reed, 2010). If associations between a word and an image cannot be formed, it is much harder to remember and recall the word at a later point in time. While this limits the effectiveness of the dual-coding theory, it is still valid over a wide range of circumstances and can be used to improve memory (Reed, 2010).

==Types of codes==

'''Analogue codes''' are used to mentally represent images. Analogue codes retain the main perceptual features of whatever is being represented, so the images we form in our minds are highly similar to the physical stimuli. They are a near-exact representation of the physical stimuli we observe in our environment, such as trees and rivers (Sternberg, 2003).

'''Symbolic codes''' are used to form mental representations of words. They represent something conceptually, and sometimes, arbitrarily, as opposed to perceptually. Similar to the way a watch may represent information in the form of numbers to display the time, symbolic codes represent information in our mind in the form of arbitrary symbols, like words and combinations of words, to represent several ideas. Each symbol (x, y, 1, 2, etc.) can arbitrarily represent something other than itself. For instance, the letter x is often used to represent more than just the concept of an x, the 24th letter of the alphabet. It can be used to represent a variable x in mathematics, or a multiplication symbol in an equation. Concepts like multiplication can be represented symbolically by an "x" because we arbitrarily assign it a deeper concept. Only when we use it to represent this deeper concept does the letter "x" carry this type of meaning.

== Support ==

===Evidence from psychological research===
Many researchers have agreed that only words and images are used in mental representation (Pylyshyn, 1973). Supporting evidence shows that memory for some verbal information is enhanced if a relevant visual is also presented or if the learner can imagine a visual image to go with the verbal information. Likewise, visual information can often be enhanced when paired with relevant verbal information, whether real-world or imagined (Anderson &amp; Bower, 1973). This theory has been applied to the use of multimedia presentations. Because multimedia presentations require both spatial and verbal working memory, individuals dually code information presented and are more likely to recall the information when tested at a later date (Brunye, Taylor, &amp; Rapp, 2008). Moreover, studies that have been conducted on abstract and concrete words have also found that the participants remembered concrete words better than the abstract words (Hargis &amp; Gickling, 1978; Sadoski, 2005; Yui, Ng, &amp; Perera-W.A., 2017). 

Paivio found that participants when shown a rapid sequence of pictures as well as a rapid sequence of words and later asked to recall the words and pictures, in any order, were better at recalling images. Participants, however, more readily recalled the sequential order of the words, rather than the sequence of pictures. These results supported Paivio's hypothesis that verbal information is processed differently from visual information and that verbal information was superior to visual information when sequential order was also required for the memory task (Paivio, 1969). Lee Brooks conducted an experiment that provided additional support for two systems for memory. He had participants perform either a visual task, where they had to view a picture and answer questions about the picture, or a verbal task, where they listened to a sentence and were then asked to answer questions pertaining to the sentence. To respond to the questions, participants were asked to either respond verbally, visually, or manually. Through this experiment, Brooks found that interference occurred when a visual perception was mixed with manipulation of the visual task, and verbal responses interfere with a task involving a verbal statement to be manually manipulated. This supported the idea of two codes used to mentally represent information (Sternberg 2003).

[[Working memory]] as proposed by [[Alan Baddeley]] includes a two-part processing system with a visuospatial sketchpad and a phonological loop which essentially maps to Paivio's theory.

Dual-coding theories complement a dual-route theory of [[Reading (activity)|reading]]. When people read written information, dual-route theory contends that the readers access [[Orthography|orthographic]] and [[Phonology|phonological]] information to recognize [[Word (linguistics)|words]] in the [[writing]].

Paivio's work has implications for literacy, visual [[mnemonics]], idea generation, [[Human Performance Technology|HPT]], human factors, interface design, as well as the development of educational materials among others. It also has implications for, and counterparts in, [[cognitive sciences]] and computational cognitive modeling (in the form of dual process cognitive models and so on; e.g., Anderson, 2005; Just et al., 2004, Sun, 2002). It also has had implications for cognitive robotics.

Two different methods have been used to identify the regions involved in visual perception and visual imagery. First, [[functional magnetic resonance imaging]] (fMRI) is used to measure [[cerebral blood flow]], which allows researchers to identify the amount of glucose and oxygen being consumed by a specific part of the brain, with an increase in blood flow providing a measure of brain activity. Second, an [[event related potential]] (ERP) can be used to show the amount of electrical brain activity that is occurring due to a particular stimulus. Researchers have used both methods to determine which areas of the brain are active with different stimuli, and results have supported the dual-coding theory. Other research has been done with [[positron emission tomography]] (PET) scans and fMRI to show that participants had improved memory for spoken words and sentences when paired with an image, imagined or real, and showed increased brain activation to process abstract words not easily paired with an image.

==Alternative theory==

Dual-coding theory is not accepted by everyone. [[John Robert Anderson (psychologist)|John Anderson]] and [[Gordon H. Bower|Gordon Bower]] proposed an alternative method – the propositional theory – of how knowledge is mentally represented. The propositional theory claims that mental representations are stored as propositions rather than as images. Here, proposition is defined as the meaning that underlies the relationship between concepts (Sternberg, 2003). This theory states that images occur as a result of other cognitive processes because knowledge is not represented in the form of images, words, or symbols.

The [[common coding theory]] has also been proposed as an alternative to dual coding theory. The common coding theory looks at how things we see and hear are connected to our motor actions. It claims that there is a common code that is shared between perceiving something and the respective motor action.

==History==
[[File:Hundert Jahre Bilder aus der Stadt Zürich - Das Polytechnikum 1865.jpg|thumb|upright|left|''Polytechnikum'' in 1865]]
[[File:ETH Zentrum.jpg|thumb|upright|left|ETH Zürich Zentrum]]
ETH was founded on 7 February 1854 by the Swiss Confederation and began giving its first lectures on 16 October 1855 as a polytechnic institute (''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'') at various sites throughout the city of Zurich.&lt;ref name=hist45-55&gt;{{cite web |title=1848–1855: The polytechnical realisation of a long-held dream |url=https://www.ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/portrait/history/epochs/1848-1855.html |publisher=ETH Zürich |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially composed of six faculties: [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[mechanical engineering]], [[chemistry]], [[forestry]], and an integrated department for the fields of [[mathematics]], natural sciences, literature, and social and [[political science]]s.

It is locally still known as ''Polytechnikum'', or simply as ''Poly'', derived from the original name ''eidgenössische polytechnische Schule'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/ |title=ETHistory 1855-2005 |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=2005 |website=ETHistory  |accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which translates to "'''federal polytechnic school'''".

ETH is a ''federal'' institute (i.e., under direct administration by the Swiss government), whereas the [[University of Zürich]] is a ''[[cantons of Switzerland|cantonal]]'' institution. The decision for a new federal university was heavily disputed at the time; the liberals pressed for a "federal university", while the conservative forces wanted all universities to remain under cantonal control, worried that the liberals would gain more political power than they already had.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethistory.ethz.ch/besichtigungen/epochen/debatte1/index_EN |title=1848-1855: Polytechnical realization of an old dream |publisher=ETH Zurich |date=31 March 2005 |website=ETHistory |accessdate=2018-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the beginning, both universities were co-located in the buildings of the University of Zürich.

From 1905 to 1908, under the presidency of [[Jérôme Franel]], the course program of ETH was restructured to that of a real university and ETH was granted the right to award doctorates. In 1909 the first doctorates were awarded. In 1911, it was given its current name, ''Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule''. In 1924, another reorganization structured the university in 12 departments. However, it now has 16 departments.

ETH Zurich, the EPFL, and four associated research institutes form the "''ETH Domain''" with the aim of collaborating on scientific projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ethrat.ch/en/eth-domain/overview |title=ETH Domain |publisher=ETH Board |location=Zurich and Berne, Switzerland |date= |accessdate=2015-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ETH Zurich is ranked among the top universities in the world. Typically, popular [[College and university rankings|rankings]] place the institution as the best university in continental Europe and ETH Zurich is consistently ranked among the top 1-5 universities in Europe, and among the top 3-10 best universities of the world.

Historically, ETH Zurich has achieved its reputation particularly in the fields of [[chemistry]], [[mathematics]] and [[physics]]. There are [[List of Nobel laureates by university affiliation|32 Nobel Laureates]] who are associated with ETH. The most recent Nobel Laureate is [[Richard F. Heck]] who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize]] in chemistry in 2010. Albert Einstein is perhaps its most famous alumnus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ALBERT EINSTEIN (1879 – 1955) |url=http://www.zuerich.com/en/Visitor/Information/facts/famous-zurich-residents/albert-einstein.html|journal=Zuerich}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, the [[QS World University Rankings]] placed ETH Zurich at 7th overall in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QS World University Rankings |url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/world-university-rankings/2019 |website=Top Universities |publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds |accessdate=16 June 2018 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, ETH was ranked 5th in the world in Engineering, Science and Technology, just behind the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], [[Cambridge University]] and [[National University of Singapore]]. In 2015, ETH also ranked 6th in the world in Natural Sciences, and in 2016 ranked 1st in the world for Earth &amp; Marine Sciences for the second consecutive year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=QS World University Rankings by Subject 2016 - Earth &amp; Marine Sciences|url=http://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/university-subject-rankings/2016/earth-marine-sciences#sorting=rank+region=+country=+faculty=+stars=false+search=|website=Top Universities|publisher=QS Quacquarelli Symonds|accessdate=14 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Times Higher Education World University Ranking]]s ranked ETH Zurich 9th overall in the world and 8th in the world in the field of Engineering &amp; Technology, just behind the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[Stanford University]], [[California Institute of Technology]], [[Princeton University]], [[Cambridge University]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.timeshighereducation.com/world-university-rankings|title=ETH Zurich – Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich|work=Times Higher Education|accessdate=19 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a comparison of Swiss universities by [http://rankingswissup.ch/ swissUP Ranking] and in rankings published by [http://www.che.de CHE] comparing the universities of German-speaking countries, ETH Zurich traditionally is ranked first in natural sciences, computer science and engineering sciences.

In the survey [http://www.excellenceranking.org CHE ExcellenceRanking] on the quality of Western European graduate school programmes in the fields biology, chemistry, physics and mathematics, ETH was assessed as one of the three institutions to have excellent graduate programmes in all considered fields, the other two being the [[Imperial College London]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. ETH Zurich had a total budget of 1.885 billion CHF&lt;ref name=AR2017/&gt; in the year 2017.

==Admission and education==
{{ETH Institutes}}
[[File:ETH Dome.jpg|thumb|left|Students and locals in ETH front courtyard]]
For Swiss students, ETH is not selective in its undergraduate admission procedures. Like every public university in Switzerland, ETH is obliged to grant admission to every Swiss resident who took the ''[[Matura]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to the first semester with a Swiss matriculation certificate ("Matura") | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/swiss-matriculation.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Applicants from foreign countries are required to take either the ''reduced entrance exam'' or the ''comprehensive entrance exam'' although some applicants from several European countries are exempted from this rule. An applicant can be admitted to ETH even without any verifiable educational records by passing the ''comprehensive entrance exam''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Admission to first semester without Swiss matriculation certificate |work= ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As at all universities in Switzerland, the academic year is divided into two semesters. Examinations are often held during examination sessions which are immediately before the beginning of the next semester (only a few select courses offer an exam immediately after the semester ends). After the first year of study, bachelor students must pass a block examination of all courses taken in the first year, called the ''Basisprüfung''. If the weighted average score is not sufficient, a student is required to retake the entire ''Basisprüfung'' which usually means having to re-sit the whole first year. About 50% of the students fail the ''Basisprüfung'' on the first try and many of them choose to drop out of the course instead of repeating the ''Basisprüfung''.
The structure of examinations in higher academic years is similar to the ''Basisprüfung'' (Basis examination), but with a higher success rate.
The regular time to reach graduation is six semesters for the [[Bachelor of Science]] degree and three or four further semesters for the [[Master of Science]] degree. The final semester is dedicated to writing a thesis.

Education at ETH Zurich generally focuses more on theoretical aspects than application and most degree programs contain a high amount of [[mathematics|mathematical training]]. The main language of instruction in undergraduate (Bachelor) studies is German and for admission a proof of sufficient knowledge of the German language is required for Bachelor students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =  | first =  | title = Language requirements | work=ETH Zurich | url = https://www.ethz.ch/en/studies/registration-application/bachelor/other-certificates/language-requirements.html | publisher =  | date =  | accessdate = 4 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most Master's programmes and doctoral studies are in English.

==Campus==
{{refimprove|section|date=February 2018}}&lt;!--only the last sentence has a citation--&gt;
[[File:ETH-Hoenggerberg-2008.jpg|thumb|320px|ETH Hönggerberg with the new HIT building]]
ETH Zurich has two campuses. The main building was constructed 1858–1864 outside and right above the eastern border of the town, but nowadays it is located right in the heart of the city. As the town and university grew, the ETH spread into the surrounding vineyards and later quarters. As a result, the ''Zentrum'' campus consists of various buildings and institutions throughout Zürich and firmly integrates the ETH in the city. The main building stands directly across the street from the [[University Hospital of Zurich]] and the [[University of Zurich]].

Because this geographic situation substantially hindered the expansion of ETH, a new campus was built from 1964 to 1976 on the ''Hönggerberg'' on a northern hill in the outskirts of the city. The last major expansion project of this new campus was completed in 2003; since then, the ''Hönggerberg'' location houses the departments of [[architecture]], [[civil engineering]], [[biology]], [[chemistry]], [[materials science]] and [[physics]].

===Main building===
[[File:ETH Zürich Hauptgebäude, Ansicht von der Polyterasse 2011-08-06 ShiftN.jpg|thumb|Main building as seen from ''Polyterrasse'']]
[[File:ETH Zürich im Abendlicht.jpg|thumb|ETH Zurich at night.]]
The main building of ETH was built from 1858 to 1864 under [[Gustav Zeuner]]; the architect, however, was [[Gottfried Semper]], who was a professor of architecture at ETH at the time and one of the most important architectural writers and theorists of the age. Semper worked in a [[Neoclassical architecture|neoclassical style]] that was unique to him; and the namesake and architect of the [[Semperoper]] in Dresden. It emphasized bold and clear massings with a detailing, such as the rusticated ground level and giant order above, that derived in part from the work of [[Andrea Palladio]] and [[Donato Bramante]]. During the construction of the University of Zürich, the south wing of the building was allocated to the University until its own new main building was constructed (1912–1914). At about the same time, Semper's ETH building was enlarged and received its impressive [[cupola]].

===Science City===
In the year of ETH Zurich's 150th anniversary, an extensive project called "Science City" for the Hönggerberg Campus was started with the goal to transform the campus into an attractive district based on the principle of sustainability.
[[File:ETH Hönggerberg Frontansicht.JPG|540px|center|thumb|ETH Hönggerberg from the south, looking at the five "fingers" of the HCI and behind the high HPP building.]]

In September 2014 a new project to connect Science City by train was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adf-innovation.com/publikationen/by_rail_2014_S26-27.pdf |title=Tunnelbahnhof für "Science City" |website=www.adf-innovation.com |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics====
The ETH Laboratory of Ion Beam Physics (LIB) is a physics laboratory located in Science City. It specializes in [[accelerator mass spectrometry]] (AMS) and the use of [[ion beam]] based techniques with applications in [[archeology]], [[earth sciences]], [[life sciences]], [[Materials science|material sciences]] and [[physics|fundamental physics]]. An example of such application is the tracing of isotopes and the detection of rare [[Radionuclide|radionuclides]] with [[radiocarbon dating]] and the use of techniques such as [[Rutherford backscattering spectrometry]] or [[elastic recoil detection]].&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{Cite web

==Student life==
ETH students were found to be the busiest students of all institutions of higher education in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.students.ch/page_news_article.php?typ=157&amp;id=2382 "Willkommen auf Students.ch"] {{De icon}}{{Failed verification|date=December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The undergraduates' tight curriculum consists of as much as twice the number of lectures as comparable courses of other Swiss universities.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

ETH has well over 100 student associations. Most notable is the [[VSETH]] (''Verband der Studierenden an der ETH'') which comprises all department associations. The associations regularly organize events with varying size and popularity. Events of the neighboring University of Zürich are well-attended by ETH students and vice versa. The VSETH organizes events of greater public attention, such as the ''Polyball'', the ''Polyparty'' (does not exist any more) and the ''Erstsemestrigenfest'', the first two housed in the main building of ETH. Sometimes, the annual ''Erstsemestrigenfest'' takes place at extraordinary locations, for example the [[Zürich Airport]]. All freshmen enjoy special treatment at that event.

Some of the notable associations that are not affiliated with a specific department are the ETH Entrepreneur Club and ETH Model United Nations. Both organisations enjoy high international standings and are regularly awarded for excellence in their field.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} ETH Juniors is another student run organisation.

==Traditions==
The annual [[Polyball]]  is the most prestigious public event at ETH, with a long tradition since the 1880s. The end of November, the ''Polyball'' welcomes around 10,000 dancers, music-lovers and partygoers in the extensively decorated main building of ETH. The ''Polyball'' is the biggest decorated ball in Europe.

The amicable rivalry between ETH and the neighbouring University of Zürich has been cultivated since 1951 (Uni-Poly). There has been an annual [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] match between teams from the two institutions on the river [[Limmat]].

There are many regular symposia and conferences at ETH, most notably the annual ''Wolfgang Pauli Lectures'', in honor of former ETH Professor [[Wolfgang Pauli]]. Distinct lecturers, among them 24 [[List of Nobel laureates|Nobel Laureate]]s, have held lectures of the various fields of [[natural science]]s at this conference since 1962.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6434">:''The phrase "early acceptance" can also refer to a form of [[Scholarly peer review#Result-blind peer review|academic publication peer review]].''

'''Early decision''' or '''early acceptance''' is a common policy used in [[college]] admissions in the [[United States]] for admitting [[freshman|freshmen]] to [[undergraduate]] programs. It is used to indicate to the [[university]] or [[college]] that the candidate considers that institution to be his or her top choice. Candidates applying early decision typically submit their applications by the end of October of their [[high school senior|senior year of high school]] and receive a decision in mid-December.  In contrast, students applying "regular decision" typically must submit their applications by January 1 and receive their admissions decision by April 1.

Some colleges offer either an early decision program or an [[early action]] one.  Others accept applications in a relatively long window known as [[rolling admission]].  Early decision differs from [[early action]] in that it constitutes a binding commitment to enroll; that is, if offered admission under an early decision program, and the financial aid offered by the school, if requested, is acceptable, the candidate must withdraw all other applications to other institutions and enroll at that institution.  Early action is not binding, so a student admitted to a school early action could choose not to enroll in that school. Furthermore, early decision programs require applicants to file only one early decision application, while, depending on the institution, early action programs may be restrictive or non-restrictive and allow candidates to apply to more than one early action institution.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bigfuture.collegeboard.org/get-in/applying-101/the-facts-about-applying-early-is-it-right-for-you The Facts About Applying Early: Is It Right For You?]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case of certain colleges with established competitor institutions, such as schools in the [[Ivy League]], some college counselors speculate that early decision can serve to mitigate the problem of students failing to matriculate to a particular school in favor of a 'superior' one. For example, one college might only admit a candidate deemed qualified for another, 'superior' college under early decision, for in regular decision, should that student be admitted to the 'superior' competitor, that student would be unlikely to attend the college that would've originally admitted them in early decision.

== Possible outcomes of early decision ==
Typically, a candidate who has applied early decision can receive one of three outcomes in December. He or she may be admitted, in which case they are bound to attend the school which admitted them; rejected, in which case they will not be able to attend the school; or ''deferred'', in which case they will be reconsidered for admission with the second round of early decision applications or with the regular decision pool and notified later with their final decision. Generally when an applicant is deferred he or she is released from their binding early decision agreement.

== Advantages of early decision ==
Admission rates for "early" applicants tend to be higher than the overall admission rates for the institution; this is particularly true of the most selective colleges. This is usually attributed to three factors: first, candidates who apply "early" can only present colleges with their transcripts until the end of junior year of high school and therefore must be particularly strong applicants with very persuasive transcripts;{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}} second, candidates who apply "early" have dedicated themselves to an institution and are more likely to match the institution's admission standards; third, student athletes sometimes apply "early" to their top choice school to demonstrate their commitment to a college varsity coach who, in turn, can push their applications in the admissions process. Some advisors suggest that early decision is the best choice for students who have clearly settled on one particular college.&lt;ref name=twsL12&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages of early decision ==
[[Controversy]] surrounds early decision. Critics of the program think that binding an applicant, typically seventeen or eighteen years old, to a single institution is unnecessarily restrictive. Furthermore, candidates for [[Student financial aid (United States)|financial aid]] are, if admitted under early decision, unable to compare financial aid offers from different colleges.&lt;ref name=twsL12/&gt; It was in answer to these criticisms that, starting in 2004, [[Yale]] and [[Stanford University|Stanford]] switched from early decision to single-choice early action. [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and the [[University of Virginia]] announced in the Fall of 2006 that they would no longer offer Early Action or Early Decision programs, which they claim favor the affluent, and moved to a single deadline instead.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6059932&amp;ft=1&amp;f=3 NPR: Harvard Ending Early Admissions Process]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S15/86/07G08/index.xml?section=topstories Princeton: Princeton to end early admissions]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[University of Florida]] followed suit the following year. However, the University of Virginia, followed by both Harvard and Princeton reinstated their single-choice, early action program to promote diversity and provide opportunities for students looking for such an option in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/main/news/archive/S29/85/15K32/index.xml?section=topstories]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2011/02/early-action-returns/]&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''efterskole''' (literally ''"afterschool"'', plural '''efterskoler''') is a unique type of [[Denmark|Danish]] independent residential school for young people between the age of 14 to 18. At an efterskole, students can choose to spend one, two or three years finishing their [[primary education]], and currently some 28,500 students attend one of approximately 260 such schools throughout Denmark. The schools are open to students from abroad.

An efterskole usually offers a variety of "study lines", focusing on specific themes, such as general sports, [[soccer]], sailing, golf, cooking, media, animation, theatre, music, dance, etc. Those particular lines offers practice and training on a professional level. Some schools are also focussing on helping pupils with [[dyslexia]], or other educational issues.

== Idea and organization ==

=== Common educational purpose ===
Each efterskole is a self-governing independent institution, and they all deal with both the educational and personal development of the students. They embrace a common educational focus on [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] values, general education and democratic [[citizenship]].

=== Freedom of the efterskoler ===
Compared to public schools, efterskoler have substantial freedom in terms of e.g. choice of subjects, teaching methods and educational approach. These vary in accordance with individual schools political, religious or [[Pedagogy|pedagogical]] orientation. The freedom of the efterskoler is assured by substantial [[State subsidy|state subsidies]] to both schools and students.{{explain|reason=How does state subsidies assure freedom? What does it mean?|date=September 2018}}

==History==
The first efterskoler were founded in the 1860s. The schools were closely related to the Danish [[Folk High School]] and the educational ideas of [[Christen Mikkelsen Kold|Christen Kold]] (1816-1870) and [[N. F. S. Grundtvig]] (1783–1872) who wanted schools to impart enlightenment values rather than formal [[vocational training]].&lt;ref&gt;Efterskoleforeningen&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Danish efterskoler came to play an important role for the Danish-oriented residents of the Danish-German borderland of [[Schleswig]] when Germany introduced a law for language schools in 1888. To secure qualified teaching in Danish language and culture, the residents were forced to send their children to efterskoler in Denmark. The first efterskole in the region of [[Southern Jutland]] was built in 1919. The attendance rate – from the [[Danish minority of Southern Schleswig]] especially – increased dramatically during the [[History of Germany#Weimar Republic|1920s]], when Germany experienced political extremism and economic meltdown. After [[World War II]] in 1945, the attendance rate from the region increased once again. [[North Schleswig Germans|The German minority of the region]] also has a dedicated efterskole in [[Tinglev]], founded in 1951. After a general declining attendance rate from the 1950s onwards in the region and countrywide, a renewed interest in efterskoler took hold in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.graenseforeningen.dk/leksikon/e/all/12744|title=Efterskoler i Sønderjylland|website=Grænsen.dk|publisher=Grænseforeningen|author=Elsemarie Dam-Jensen|year=2011|language=Danish|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After a period of stagnation and sometimes decreasing number of students in modern times, efterskoler have seen an increase in popularity in the last two decades or so, now with an increased focus on the natural sciences and international affairs. Currently two out of three students at efterskoler attend the [[10th grade]]; the rest attend 8th or 9th grade.

In the first decade of the 2000s, the cost of attending an efterskole rose by 75%, and this development has been a matter of concern in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.b.dk/nationalt/paa-efterskole-paa-oekonomi-eller-businessclass|title=På efterskole på økonomi- eller businessclass?

'''Elisha Scott Loomis''' (September 18, 1852 – December 11, 1940) was an American teacher, mathematician, [[Genealogy|genealogist]], writer and engineer.&lt;ref&gt;The National Cyclopaedia of American Biography. Volume 15,  page 186. James t. White &amp; Co. 1916 May be downloaded from: https://archive.org/details/nationalcyclopae15newy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.loomis.8k.com/page3.html Obituary of Elisha S.

==Ancestry and early life ==
Elisha Scott Loomis, of English-Scottish and Pennsylvania Dutch ancestry, was born in a log-cabin in Wadsworth, Ohio, which at that time was a village in Medina County. He was the eldest son of Charles W. Loomis, a descendent of the pioneer [[Loomis Homestead|Joseph Loomis]] of Windsor, Connecticut.

His mother was Sarah Oberholtzer, descendent of pioneer Jacob Oberholtzer, of Montgomery County, Pennsylvania.
When Loomis was 12 his father died. By that time he had six younger brothers and a sister, and for seven years from the age of 13 he helped his mother make ends meet by working as a farm labourer during summertime. Four months each winter he attended district schools, working for his board while doing so. During his schooldays he wished to learn algebra, and as his district school teacher knew no algebra, he walked several miles to a neighbouring town where he bought Ray's Elementary Algebra.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Joseph. Elementary algebra 1850. May be downloaded from https://archive.org/details/abu8350.0001.001.umich.edu&lt;/ref&gt; He proceeded to master the material without any support except encouragement of his mother, who had had too little schooling to learn to write.

Loomis proved to be a sufficiently apt scholar to become a teacher himself in 1873. He taught during the summer and managed not only to save enough money to help his mother support her family, but also for himself to attend and assist at Baldwin University at Berea, Ohio, during the winter. His industry and thrift enabled him to buy a home, in Shreve, Ohio, where he established his mother and brothers the fall of 1876. This was partly possible because of his abstemious habits, eschewing both tobacco and strong drink. He joined the [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] church early in his adult life, but later converted to [[Methodism]].

After he attained his B.S. degree in mid-1880, Loomis married a teacher from Loudonville, Ohio, Miss Letitia E. Shire.

==Further education and career==
While teaching, Loomis continued his own studies and earned postgraduate degrees. While in Berea, studied civil engineering and became the village engineer. He attained his B.S. at Baldwin University in 1880 under Professor Aaron Schuyler, and then his A.M. in 1886 and Ph.D. in 1888 from Wooster University, Ohio. In 1900 the Cleveland Law School awarded him the LL.B. degree, and he was admitted to the State Bar, June, 1900.

From 1880 to 1885 he served as principal, first at the Burbank Academy in Burbank, Ohio, then at the Richfield Township High School, in Summit County, Ohio. In 1885, he accepted the chair of mathematics in Baldwin University, succeeding Professor Aaron Schuyler, where he served for ten years.

In 1895, he accepted the post of head of the Mathematics Department at West High School, Cleveland, Ohio, where he taught for 29 years, not retiring until 1923 as required by law for Ohio state teachers. In writing his own obituary  he estimated that in his 50 years as a teacher he had ploughed "habit-formation grooves in the plastic brains" of over 4000 boys and girls and young men and women and said that  he prized the title of "Teacher" more than any other honour.

==Written works==
His written works included his thesis for his Ph.D. degree in metaphysics: "Theism the Result of Completed Investigation", a genealogy of "The Loomis Family in America", and "The Genealogy of Jacob Oberholtzer and His Descendants"'. He also wrote "The Teaching of Mathematics in High Schools", and "Original Investigation Or How to Attack an Exercise in Geometry". Possibly his best-known work however, is "The [[Pythagorean theorem|Pythagorean Theorem]]", in which he collected, classified, and discussed 344 proofs. The book is still a work of reference.&lt;ref&gt;Loomis, Elisha Scott, The Pythagorean Proposition: Its Demonstration Analyzed and Classified and Bibliography of Sources for Data of the Four Kinds of ‘Proofs’, National Council of Teachers of Mathematics,Washington, DC, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;
Also he prepared in manuscript, ready for publication, books and articles estimated to number over one hundred, but it is not clear how many of them ever were printed. Titles that he mentioned include: "Recollections and Reflections of a Log-Cabin Boy", "This and That, from 50 Years of Experience as a Teacher", a genealogy of his family, a biography of Dr. Aaron Schuyler, and many articles on educational, mathematical and genealogical subjects.

He held that true teaching, worth-while education and right living consist in ethical and moral habit formation to control one's social contributions throughout life; and that service should guide one's action rather than profits.

At the time of his death he had a son, Elatus G. Loomis of Cleveland, Ohio, a daughter, Mrs. R. L. Lechner of [[Buenos Aires]], and three grandchildren.

'''English studies''' (usually called simply '''English''') is an academic discipline taught in [[primary education|primary]], [[secondary education|secondary]], and post-secondary education in [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]]; it is not to be confused with [[English as a second or foreign language|English taught as a foreign language]], which is a distinct discipline. English includes: the study of [[English literature|literature]] written in the [[English language]] (especially [[novel]]s, [[short story|short stories]], and [[poetry]]), the majority of which comes from Britain, the United States, and Ireland (although English-language literature from any country may be studied, and local or national literature is usually emphasized in any given country); English [[composition (language)|composition]], including writing [[essay]]s, short stories, and poetry; English [[language arts]], including the study of [[grammar]], [[linguistic prescription|usage]], and [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]]; and English [[sociolinguistics]], including [[discourse analysis]] of written and spoken texts in the English language, the [[history of the English language]], [[English language learning and teaching]], and the study of [[World English]]es. English [[linguistics]] ([[syntax]], [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], [[phonetics]], [[phonology]], etc.) is usually treated as a distinct discipline, taught in a department of linguistics.

The disciplinary divide between a dominant literature or usage orientation is one motivation for the division of the North American [[Modern Language Association]] (MLA) into two subgroups. At universities in non-English-speaking countries, the same department often covers all aspects of English studies, including linguistics: this is reflected, for example, in the structure and activities of the [[European Society for the Study of English]] (ESSE).

It is common for departments of English to offer courses and scholarship in the areas of the English language, literature (including [[literary criticism]] and [[literary theory]]), [[public speaking]] and [[speechwriter|speech-writing]], [[rhetoric]], [[composition studies]], [[creative writing]], [[philology]] and [[etymology]], [[journalism]], poetry, [[publishing]], [[literacy]], [[area studies]] (especially [[American studies]]), the [[philosophy of language]], [[theater]] and [[playwright|play-writing]], [[screenwriting]], [[communication studies]], [[technical communication]], [[cultural studies]], [[critical theory]], [[gender studies]], [[ethnic studies]], [[disability studies]], [[digital media]] and [[electronic publishing]], [[film studies]] and other [[media studies]], and various courses in the [[liberal arts]] and [[humanities]], among others. In most English-speaking countries, the study at all educational levels of texts produced in non-English languages takes place in other departments, such as departments of foreign language or of [[comparative literature]].

==English major==
The '''English Major''' (alternatively "English concentration," "B.A. in English") is a term in the United States and a few other countries for an [[undergraduate]] [[university]] degree focused around the consumption, analysis, and production of texts in the [[English language]]. The term may also be used to describe a student who is pursuing such a degree.

Students who major in English reflect upon, analyse, and interpret [[literature]] and [[film]], presenting their analyses in clear, cogent [[writing]]. Although help-wanted postings rarely solicit English majors specifically, a degree in English hones [[critical thinking]] skills essential to a number of career fields, including [[writing]], [[editing]], [[publishing]], [[teaching]], [[research]], [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[law]], and [[finance]].

===History===
The history of English studies at the modern university in Europe and America begins in the second half of the nineteenth century. Initially, English studies comprised a motley array of content: the practice of oratory, the study of rhetoric and grammar, the composition of poetry, and the appreciation of literature (mostly by authors from England, since American literature and language study was only added in the twentieth century).&lt;ref&gt;For a survey of these developments, see Gerald Graff, ''Professing Literature. An Institutional History'' (Chicago: U of Chicago P, 1987).&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany and several other European countries, English [[philology]], a strongly positivistic and historically interested practice of reading pre-modern texts, became the preferred scholarly paradigm, but English-speaking countries distanced themselves from philological paradigms soon after World War I.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "''Englische Philologie'' vs. English Studies: A Foundational Conflict," in: ''Das Potential europäischer Philologien: Geschichte, Leistung, Funktion'', ed. Christoph König (Göttingen: Wallstein, 2009), pp. 34-44.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of this process, English departments tended to refocus their work on various forms of writing instruction (creative, professional, critical) and the interpreting of literary texts, and teacher education in English recovered from the neglect it had suffered because of more science-oriented paradigms.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce McComiskey, ed., ''English Studies. An Introduction to the Discipline'' (Urbana, IL: NCTE, 2006), esp. pp. 44-48, "The New English Studies."&lt;/ref&gt; Today, English departments in native-speaking countries re-evaluate their roles as sole guardians of the discipline because English is less and less native speakers' unique 'property' and has to be shared with the millions of speakers and writers from other countries for whom English is an essential means of communication and artistic expression.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, the [http://www.english.tamu.edu/english-without-borders?destination=node%2F76 English Without Borders] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204032833/http://www.english.tamu.edu/english-without-borders?destination=node%2F76 |date=2014-02-04 }} project at Texas A&amp;M University&lt;/ref&gt;

English literature became an object of study in French universities as part of foreign (comparative) literature in the nineteenth century. A chair of foreign literature was established at the College de France in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vorachek|first=Laura|date=2017|title=Journalism and the Periodical Press in Nineteenth-Century Britain ed. by Joanne Shattock (review)|url=https://muse.jhu.edu/article/682977|journal=Victorian Periodicals Review|language=en|volume=50|issue=4|pages=829–833|doi=10.1353/vpr.2017.0059|issn=1712-526X}}&lt;/ref&gt; English was first taught independently from other languages and literature in the University of Lille and in the University of Lyons and only afterwards in the Sorbonne. These three universities were the first major centres of English studies in France. The first lecturer and later professor of English studies would seem to have been Auguste Angellier. After spending several years teaching French in England in the 1860s and 1870s, he became a lecturer in English studies in the University of Lille in 1881 and a professor of English in 1893. In France nowadays, literature, civilisation, linguistics and the spoken and written language are all important in English studies in universities.&lt;ref&gt;Imelda Bonel-Elliott (2000), “English Studies in France” in: Engler, Balz and Haas, Renate, ''European English Studies: Contributions Towards a History of the Discipline''. Leicester: The English Association for ESSE, pp. 69-88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The English major rose to prominence in [[United States|American]] colleges during the first half of the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nces.ed.gov/pubs93/93442.pdf|title=120 Years of American Education: A Statistical Portrait|last=National Center for Education Statistics|first=|date=January 1993|website=National Center for Education Statistics|access-date=September 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It provided an opportunity for students to develop skills in analytical reading with the aim of improving their writing, as well as exercises in rhetoric and persuasive expression that had been traditionally only taught in [[classical studies]] and available to the very few due to language barriers and a shortage of professors who could actively engage students in the humanities. Outside the United States (originating in [[Scotland]] and then rippling out into the English-speaking world) the English major became popular in the latter half of the 19th century during a time when religious beliefs were shaken in the face of scientific discoveries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chass.utoronto.ca/~ian/arnold.htm "Literature and Science" (Matthew Arnold [1882&amp;#93;)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Literature]] was thought to act as a replacement for [[religion]] in the retention and advancement of culture, and the English Major thus provided students with the chance to draw [[moral]], [[ethical]], and [[philosophical]] qualities and meanings of older studies from a richer and broader source of literature than that of the ancient [[ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Latin]] classics.

Since 2000, there have been more and more questions about the specific function of English departments at the contemporary U.S. college and university.{{By whom|date=February 2018}} The absence of a clearly defined disciplinary identity and the increasingly utilitarian goals in U.S. society present a challenge to those academic units still mostly focusing on the printed book and the traditional division in historical periods and national literatures, and neglecting allegedly non-theoretical areas such as professional writing, composition, and multimodal communication.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Utz, "The Trouble with English," ''Chronicle of Higher Education'', 13 January 2013 (http://chronicle.com/blogs/conversation/2013/01/03/the-trouble-with-english/); and "Quo vadis, English Studies," ''Philologie im Netz'' 69 (2014): 93-100 (http://web.fu-berlin.de/phin/phin69/p69t8.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Skills acquired ===

In the past an [[academic degree]] in English usually meant an intensive study of [[United Kingdom|British]] and [[United States|American]] literary masterpieces. Now, however, an English Major encompasses a much broader range of topics which stretch over multiple disciplines. While the requirements for an English Major vary from university to university, most English departments emphasize three core skills: analyzing literature, a process which requires [[logic]] and reflective analysis; creativity and imagination with regards to the production of good writing; and an understanding of different [[cultures]], [[civilizations]], and literary styles from various time periods. The skills gained from studying English include acquiring tools that will never lose value, understanding the ever-changing media, to explain your own world, and more.&lt;ref name="Yale"&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Major in English?|url=http://english.yale.edu/undergraduate/why-major-english|website=Yale University|accessdate=23 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prospective English Majors can expect to take college courses in [[academic writing]], [[creative writing]], [[literary theory]], [[British literature|British]] and [[United States|American]] literature, multicultural literature, several literary genres (such as [[poetry]], [[drama]], and [[film studies]]), and a number of elective multidisciplinary topics such as [[history]], courses in the [[social sciences]], and studies in a foreign language. To the end of studying these disciplines, candidates for a Major in English attain skills in professional writing with relations to [[rhetoric]], [[literary analysis]], an appreciation for the diversity of cultures, and an ability to clearly and persuasively express their ideas in writing.

=== Examples of courses ===

Most English courses fall into the broader categories of either Literature-based studies, which focus on classical authors and time periods, or Rhetorical studies, which concentrate on communication skills in preparation for specialization in a variety of professional fields. While specific graduation requirements vary from university to university, students can expect to study some of the following courses.

'''Courses in [[Writing]] and [[Composition (language)|Composition]]''': such as Academic and Professional Writing, which stress analytical writing and train students to produce clear, cohesive arguments.

'''Courses in [[British Literature]]''': Courses may focus on time periods, authors, genres, or literary movements. Examples include [[Shakespeare]]'s Tragedies, History and Theory of British Drama, Medieval English Literature, and the Victorian Novel.

'''Courses in [[American Literature]]''': Depending upon the university, these courses can either be broken down by time period, such as Nineteenth Century [[Gothic Fiction]]; authors, such as classes on [[Nathaniel Hawthorne|Hawthorne]], [[Ernest Hemingway|Hemingway]], or [[Robert Frost|Frost]]; or Literary schools and movements, such as [[Naturalism (literature)|Naturalism]] or [[Transcendentalism]].

'''Courses in Multicultural Literature''': The value of bringing a range of cultural and multidisciplinary perspectives to the study of [[English literature]] is being increasingly recognized in a number of universities. Examples include Multi-cultural Literatures in Medieval England, Latina Narratives, and Studies in Jewish Literature.

'''Rhetorical courses''': Focus on techniques of persuasive arguing in the written form, as well as skills which involve the analysis of written texts.

=== Career opportunities ===

A major in English opens a variety of career opportunities for college graduates entering the job market. Since students who graduate with an English degree are trained to ask probing questions about large bodies of texts and then to formulate, analyze, and answer those questions in coherent, persuasive [[prose]]—skills vital to any number of careers—English majors have much to choose from after graduation. The most obvious career choices for English majors are writing, publishing, journalism, and teaching. However, other less intuitive job options include positions in [[advertising]], [[public relations]], [[acting]], [[law]], [[business]], [[marketing]], [[information assurance]], and directing.

'''Every Child Counts''' is the name given to a series of public school [[education reform]]s in [[Kwara]], Nigeria. In a bid to resuscitate public education in its state, the Kwara State Government under the leadership of Governor [[Bukola Saraki]] introduced a package of extensive reforms in the education sector. These reforms are also called the Education Charter for Kwara State, and were designed to put "children at the heart of education"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kwara State Education Charter|publisher=Kwara State Ministry of Education Science &amp; Technology|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the state.

==History==
[[File:Pupils at a public elementary school in Kwara State.jpg|thumb|Pupils at a public elementary school in Kwara]]
Prior to the introduction of the reforms, public education was in dire straits in Kwara, as in many states in Nigeria. The quality of instruction in public schools was abysmally low.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Education in Kwara State: enacting a miraculous turn-round|url=http://www.kwarastate.gov.ng/collection-of-articles/education-in-kwara-enacting-a-miraculous-turn-round.html|publisher=Official Website Kwara State Government|accessdate=5 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Enrollment in public schools dwindled, as parents (including the very poor) only took their wards to public schools when they could not afford the fee-paying private schools. Beginning from 2007, however, efforts were taken by the Kwara State Government to reverse the slide.

With strong political support from the state governor, the Kwara State Commissioner for Education, Science and Technology, Bolaji Abdullahi, introduced some interventions that would redefine the education landscape in the state. To incentivize and track learning in public schools, the state government decided that a benchmark ought to be created to measure the progress of children in public schools. The state also recognized that in order to have greater involvement and buy-in from the parents and guardians of the school children, there was a need for an accountability mechanism to help them monitor the progress of their children.

To determine the capacity of teachers to impart knowledge on their pupils, a test based on grade 4 curriculum was administered to the politically powerful primary school teachers in Kwara public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ani|first=Lawrence|title=Making Every Child Count|newspaper=Thisday|date=9 April 2011|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the teachers failed the test. As a result, massive training was held for all the teachers and teaching manuals were developed to guide the teachers. After discovering that most pupils lack basic literacy and numeracy skills, the state government also decided to reduce the number of subjects taught to students to ensure that more emphasis is placed on the ability of the pupils to read and write as well as undertake basic sums. Benchmarks were created for the evaluation of the new curriculum which focuses on literacy and numeracy. These were distributed to the teachers and the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ani|first=Lawrence|title=Making Every Child Count|newspaper=Thisday|date=9 April 2011|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Four pillars of reform==
[[File:Lesson manuals for teachers.jpg|thumb|Lesson manuals for teachers]]
The Kwara State Every Child Counts education reform is aimed at providing quality education in public schools in the state. As enunciated by the state government, the reform revolves around answering the following questions: 
* When we put children in schools, what do you expect them to be able to do?
* How well are children learning in schools?
* How do we ensure that children learn effectively in our schools?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kwara State Education Charter|publisher=Kwara State Ministry of Education Science &amp; Technology|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on a review of the situation on the ground and to ensure that proper learning is taking place in its public schools, the state government build the reform around four pillars. These are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Education Strategic Plan 2009–2018.|publisher=Kwara State Ministry of Education, Science and Technology.|pages=2|date=May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
:1.''Teaching quality improvement''
This is to ensure regular, structured assessment for teachers complemented by [[professional development]] courses for them to improve their skills. It is also designed to ensure that the curriculum continually remains relevant and is tailored to match the needs of local children.
:2.''Inspectorate development''
Setting and maintaining a high standard of education is at the core of Every Child Counts. A clear set of quality assurance standards will be devised for every school, both public and private. Schools will be supported to develop systems to assess their own quality as well as evaluate their own needs.
:3.''The College of Education turn-around''
Improve the capacity of Colleges of Education to produce the right quality of teachers needed. Update the curriculum of the College of in line with the current demands of teaching in primary schools.
:4.''Institution building''
Execute series of capacity building activities at the ministry of Education, Science and Technology, the state Universal Basic Education and the Teaching Service Commission. Strengthen the State Education Management Information System (EMIS) to enable the state to collate, retrieve, deploy and employ data on education in the state.

==Impact==
Every Child Counts prioritises the educational needs of children. Its focus is on the ability of children to, at the minimum, be able to read and write and be able to do basic arithmetic. The retraining of teachers and the introduction of the teaching manuals for all teachers ensure that teachers are capable of taking charge of the classroom and delivering quality education to the children. The introduction of a detailed benchmark for monitoring the performance of the children, allows parents the opportunity to be a part of the learning process taking place and to engage their children. The bold step taken by Kwara State to revitalise public education is endorsed as best practice by the federal authorities and the donor community in Nigeria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adio|first=Waziri|title=Lessons from Kwara|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/lessons-from-kwara-state/87670/|publisher=Thisday Live|accessdate=12 April 2011|date=11 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1967, the two publications amalgamated. Prior to the amalgamation, it appeared every week for 240 issues, the first 72 being numbered 1 to 72, and from then on volume 7 to 20, each volume having 12 issues. It initially sold for 1s 6d, eventually rising to 2s 6d. Readers could buy binders for each volume.

Topics covered included maths, science, history, geography and French language, and each issue included a short story. It was noted for its illustrations, which were by some of the top book illustrators of the day, [[Angus McBride]] being the foremost and also including [[Janet and Anne Grahame Johnstone]]. Later issues included one or two photos.

The publication generally didn't include free gifts. However, one exception to this was a set of four reproductions of famous paintings issued around 1964. These were approximately 11&amp;nbsp;cm × 16&amp;nbsp;cm and came complete with frames folded out of cardboard. The paintings were:
*"Mares and Foals" by [[George Stubbs]]
*"[[The Hay Wain]]" by [[John Constable]]
*"[[The Fighting Temeraire]]" by [[J. M. W. Turner]]
*"The Grand Canal" by [[Canaletto]].

They were issued one per week. The frames included tabs through which pins could be pushed to fix the picture on a wall. It was possible to hang them up either in "portrait" or "landscape" format. All four pictures were in "landscape" format, so maybe a further issue was planned which never materialized.

The '''Frankfurt University of Music and Performing Arts''' ({{lang-de|'''Hochschule für Musik und Darstellende Kunst Frankfurt am Main'''}}) is a state [[Hochschule]] for Music, Theater and Dance in [[Frankfurt]] and is the only one of its kind in the Federal State of [[Hesse]]. It was founded in 1938.

At present around 900 students are taught by about sixty five professors and 320 other teaching staff. The study programs include Performance in all instruments and voice, the teaching of music, composition, conducting and church music. There are also programs in musical theater, drama and dance. The university offers doctoral studies in [[musicology]] and [[music education]].

== History ==
Frankfurt had an institute for the teaching of music since 1878. The [[Hoch Conservatory]] flourished and had a worldwide reputation in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Through teachers like the pianist [[Clara Schumann]] and composers [[Joachim Raff]], [[Bernhard Sekles]] and [[Engelbert Humperdinck (composer)|Engelbert Humperdinck]], the Hoch Conservatory attracted students from around the world, including the composers [[Hans Pfitzner]], [[Edward MacDowell]], [[Percy Grainger]], [[Paul Hindemith]] and [[Ernst Toch]], and the conductors [[Otto Klemperer]] and [[Hans Rosbaud]].

In April 1933, when the [[Nazi Party|National Socialists]] came to power in Germany, the director Bernhard Sekles, [[Mátyás Seiber]], head of the world's first jazz department, and twelve other members of the teaching staff who were Jewish or foreign, were removed from their positions.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cahn, ''Das Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main (1878-1978)'', Frankfurt am Main: Kramer, 1979, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the Hoch Conservatory was degraded to a Music School (''Musikschule des Dr Hoch's Konservatorium'').&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cahn, ''Das Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main (1878-1978)'', Frankfurt am Main: Kramer, 1979, p. 325&lt;/ref&gt; In 1938 the "Hochschule für Musik" was established. In 1940 its name was the "Staatliche Hochschule für Musik - Dr Hoch's Konservatorium", but in 1942 the subtitle "Dr Hoch's Konservatorium" was dropped, leaving the full name as "Staatliche Hochschule für Musik".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cahn, ''Das Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main (1878-1978)'', Frankfurt am Main: Kramer, 1979, p. 327&lt;/ref&gt; In his testament [[Joseph Hoch]], benefactor of the Conservatory, had stipulated that the name "Dr Hoch's Konservatorium" should never be changed.&lt;ref&gt;See "Verfassung" at [http://www.dr-hochs.de/wir.htm dr-hochs.de] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017053233/http://www.dr-hochs.de/wir.htm |date=2008-10-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cahn, ''Das Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main (1878-1978)'', Frankfurt am Main: Kramer, 1979, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Hochschule'' thus became a new and separate institution, distancing itself from the Conservatory its history.

In the closing stages of the [[Second World War]], both institutions closed down. After the war both were reopened, and they now work together in a three-tier system of the Hochschule, the Hoch Conservatory and the Music School. [[Helmut Walcha]], who had taught the organ at the Hoch Conservatory from 1933 to 1938, initiated the  reopening of the Hochschule in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Cahn, ''Das Hoch'sche Konservatorium in Frankfurt am Main (1878-1978)'', Frankfurt am Main: Kramer, 1979, p. 308 and 332&lt;/ref&gt; The first department to be  reopened was that of church music, followed by the department of school music and, in 1949, the [[seminar]] for the teaching of music.
[[File:Big-band-hfmubk-ffm005.jpg|thumb|The Big Band of the Hochschule with Allen Jacobson]]
In the summer of 1950, the violinist [[Walther Davisson]], who had studied and taught at the Hoch Conservatory, became artistic director of both the Hochschule and the Hoch Conservatory. Under his directorship the Department of Performance was, step by step, restarted in instrumental and vocal training. During this post-war period, teaching was still taking place in private homes and in the partly renovated Conservatory building - which was still in ruins. (It was unfortunately pulled down later.) Not until 1956 did the Hochschule have its own building: it was given the Radio-House of the [[Hessischer Rundfunk]], built in 1933.

The development of the Hochschule continued through the 1950s and 60s: including the establishing of the Opera School and Opera-Choir School (1954 and 1958), the Drama School (1960) and the Dance School (1961). In the 1960s the Studio for New Music and the Studio for Early Music were initiated. Later, departments of jazz and popular music were opened and in 1982 the Department of Musicology was established. From 1989 the Hochschule was given the right to offer graduate studies in the teaching of music and musicology.

In 1990-93 the Hochschule's new main building and library were finished. The Historical Performance Practice and Contemporary Music Institutes were founded in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Information about the history of the Hochschule since 1950 comes from the Website of the Hochschule: http://www.hfmdk-frankfurt.de/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5218">'''Geeta S. Iyengar''' (born December 1944, in [[Pune]], [[Maharashtra]], [[India]]), the eldest daughter of Yogacharya [[B. K. S. Iyengar]], is a [[yoga]] teacher credited with advancing yoga for [[women's health]].

==Life and work==

Geeta Iyengar, eldest daughter of the founder of the worldwide Iyengar [[yoga]] method, Yogacharya [[B. K. S. Iyengar]], has been described as "the world's leading female yoga teacher".&lt;ref name=Mungen&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/print/2001/jun/08/news/cl-8045|title=Mastering the Meeting of Mind and Body| work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | first=Donna |last=Mungen |date=8 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iyengar studied yoga with her father from an early age.  After graduating from high school in 1961, she began substituting for her father when he was away on international teaching tours.&lt;ref name=Mungen /&gt; Since her father's retirement in 1984,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.beliefnet.com/Health/2004/11/Iyengar-Yoga-Food-For-The-Spirit.aspx?p=1 |title=Iyengar Yoga: 'Food for the Spirit'| work=[[Beliefnet]] | first=Mark Bruce |last=Rosin |date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; she has been co-director, with her brother Prashant S. Iyengar (b. 1949),  of the Ramamani Iyengar Memorial Yoga Institute (RIMYI)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Short Biography | url=http://www.bksiyengar.com/modules/guruji/geeta.htm |accessdate=6 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as undertaking her own international teaching tours.

== Teaching ==

Iyengar has adapted yoga to the specific requirements of women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.yoga-international.org/article/In+Loving+Gratitude/1213713/131242/article.html|title=In Loving Gratitude| work=[[Yoga International]] | first=Anna|last=Dubrovsky |date=Winter 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific [[asana]]s, [[pranayama]] and sequences are given for different stages in a woman's life including [[menstruation]], [[pregnancy]], postpartum, and [[menopause]]. Like her father, Iyengar explains how yoga is used as a method to unify body and mind, and strengthen the respiratory system, circulatory system, nervous system, muscles, epidermis, and the mind.&lt;ref&gt;Iyengar, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to teaching at RIMYI, Iyengar periodically tours worldwide to carry on the [[Iyengar Yoga]] lineage. She is a well-known figure in yoga around the world, in areas such as:

The '''Institute of Promotional Marketing''' is a [[marketing]] organization in the [[United Kingdom]].

Originally set up in 1933 as the British Sales Promotion Association, it was known by various names until it was awarded Institute status in 1979 as the Institute of Sales Promotion. In the UK, "[[Institute]]" is a legally protected term which is only granted to organisations that can demonstrate achievement in areas such as education, development and research.

The organisation continued to be known as the ISP until June 2010, when it changed to the Institute of Promotional Marketing.

The IPM provides professional diplomas and certificates, best-practice guidelines and legal and copy clearance advice for the promotional marketing industry in the UK. It also represents the interests of promotional marketing practitioners with regulators, government officials and politicians, both in the UK and in the European Union.

The decision to change the organisation's name from the Institute of Sales Promotion to the Institute of Promotional Marketing was the result of many years' debate. It was eventually decided that the term "sales promotion" was restrictive, because, strictly speaking, it refers to a relatively small number of techniques traditionally used only with the retail environment. While Institute members may still run some promotions that use these sales promotions techniques, the majority of the work they do involves other promotional marketing techniques.

'''Medical intern''' is a term used in some countries to describe a [[physician]] in training who has completed [[medical school]] and has a [[medical degree]], but does not yet have a full license to practice [[medicine]] unsupervised.  In other countries medical education generally ends with a period of practical training similar to internship, but the way the overall program of academic and practical medical training is structured differs in each case, as does the terminology used (see [[medical education]] and [[medical school]] for further details).

==Australia==
In Australia, medical graduates must complete one year in an accredited hospital post prior to receiving full registration; this year of conditional registration is known as the intern year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.amc.org.au/index.php/ar/psa |title=National Internship Framework |publisher=[[Australian Medical Council]] |date=5 June 2014 |accessdate= 5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; An internship is completed not necessarily in a hospital at the same state as the graduate's medical school. This indeed depends on personal factors as well as professional career aspirations.

==Brazil==
In Brazil, medical school consists of six years or twelve semesters; the final two years (or one and a half year, depending on the University in question) are said to be the internship. During this time, students will undergo extensive hospital hours and do basic hospital work while supervised by both residents and staff. Usually, this period is divided among Internal Medicine, Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics, Pediatrics, Emergency Medicine, Family Medicine and a final elective period in which the student may choose an area to in which to gain further experience. Upon conclusion of internship, the student graduates to a doctor, and may then work unsupervised or enter a residency program in order to gain a specialty.

==Chile==
After High School, medical course in Chile consists in 7 years, having 5 years as a medical student and 2 years as an intern to obtain the degree of ''Médico Cirujano'' (the equivalent of General Practitioner in the USA). Internships should at least include the 4 basic specialties (Internal Medicine, General Surgery, Gynecology and Obstetrics and Pediatrics) throughout this period. After completing the internship, the new physician may work in primary care, hospitals or apply to residencies for a specialty.

==DR Congo==
DR Congo has a 2 years internship program for public health schools. {{citation needed|date=September 2015}} Many hospitals employ Doctors prior to their full registration with the medical council (CNOM).{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Ecuador==
After finishing high school, students have the possibility to apply to medical school. Medical school generally consist of 8 years of medical school and one year of internship, through which the student rotate through different surgical and clinical specialties. After this, the student gets the title of Medical Doctor (according to US degrees).
Additionally, there is one compulsory year of community medicine in order to obtain the medical register and licence from the Public Health Ministry (MSP). After this, the MD has the possibility to do residency or apply to a specialty.

==Egypt==
One year of Internship or Clerkship Training in a University or Teaching Hospital is done after graduating from medicine school. During this year, the graduate must complete two month rotations in each General Surgery, Internal Medicine, Paediatrics and Obstetrics/Gynaecology. They also must complete one month rotations of their choice in each a sub-specialty of Surgery, sub-specialty of Internal Medicine, Anesthesiology and ER medicine. Once the graduate has completed their Internship they are awarded licence to practise.

==Germany==
The regulation in Germany from 1988 to 2004 provided for medical doctors who wanted legal qualification or license to serve as “Arzt im Praktikum” (physician in internship) for 18 months. In 2004 this regulation was abolished. Since then doctors of medicine, who have successfully finished their medical studies, have received legal qualification immediately and the status of assistant doctor when taking up a medical occupation. However, they cannot enter private practice or work unsupervised until receiving their „Facharzt“ (full board certification) in their chosen specialty.

==Ghana==
The housemanship (internship period) is a two - year period after graduating from medical school during which newly qualified doctors, practice under supervision in designated hospitals in the country. This involves six (6) month rotations each in Medicine, Surgery, Obstetrics and Gynaecology and Paediatrics in no particular order. Alternatively, a houseman may opt for a rotation in Anaesthesia or Psychiatry in place of one of the traditional four rotation areas.  During this period the houseman (intern) is given provisional registration status with the Ghana Medical and Dental Council and would only be granted full registration status after successfully completing the housemanship. They then assume the rank of Medical Officer (M.O.).

==India==
{{Main|Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship}}
After four and half years of medical school (degree of MBBS) every doctor in India has to go through a one-year [[Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship|compulsory rotatory internship]] in various specialities to get permanent registration in [[Medical Council of India]] as a physician. Only after getting permanently registered with MCI, one is licensed to practice medicine as a primary care doctor throughout the India. &lt;br&gt;
Dental sciences students too undergo compulsory internships for one year without which degree requirements are not considered full and professional license to practise is not entrusted to an individual.

==Iran==
In Iran, [[internship]] is an 18-month period at the end of the 7 year medical education which should be done in the university hospitals. Then, medical students can graduate and work independently as a Medical Doctor (MD) or participate in National Comprehensive Residency Exam and continue to study in desired specialty. If they decide to work as a General Practitioner, they should first do their compulsory service for a period, regarding their national service or their individual status, in underserved areas recognized by Iranian Ministry of Health, as part of the commitments to the ministry. Medical [[Internship]] offers a schedule that rotates through all the major and minor specialties, including [[emergency medicine]], [[internal medicine]], [[obstetrics &amp; gynecology]], [[pediatrics]], [[surgery]], [[dermatology]], [[ophthalmology]], [[otorhinolaryngology]], [[infectious diseases]], and [[psychiatry]].

==Iraq==
In Iraq, after graduation from a 6 years medical program, graduates start their internship in hospitals. The medical intern must finish a period of 3 months in each of the specialities of [[internal medicine]], [[obstetrics and gynaecology]], [[surgery]], [[psychiatry]] and [[pediatrics]]. Also, they work for variable periods of time in some of the subspecialties as assigned]. Each speciality is given in particular courses of 3 months, after completion of internship doctors are eligible to practice independently. 
According to the above definition of internship, interns have a degree but they are not fully licensed to practice medicine unsupervised.

==Ireland==
In order to register fully with the [[Irish Medical Council]], graduates are required to complete twelve months of training in an approved public hospital.  Internship comprises at least one surgical rotation and at least one medical rotation. A minimum of two months and a maximum of three months may be spent in another speciality, including [[emergency medicine]], [[general practice]], [[obstetrics &amp; gynaecology]], [[paediatrics]], [[psychiatry]], [[anaesthesia]] and [[radiology]].

After completion of the internship, doctors obtain a certificate of satisfactory service. Upon receipt of the certificate, the Medical Council will entitle the provisionally registered doctor to apply for full registration in the General Register of Medical Practitioners, subject to payment of a fee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.medicalcouncil.ie/Registration/Internship-Registration/ |title=Internship registration |publisher=[[Medical Council (Ireland)]] |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
In Israel, medical graduates must complete one year in an accredited hospital prior to receiving full registration; this year of conditional registration is known as the intern year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.health.gov.il/English/Services/MedicalAndHealthProfessions/GeneralMedicine/Pages/stage.aspx |title=Internship in Medicine in Israel |publisher=State of Israel Ministry of Health |accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After completing this mandatory year, the graduate can go into a specialty program, or practice general medicine.
There are two kinds of internships:
* "Direct internship" is done in either [[internal medicine]], [[pediatrics]] or [[surgery]].  Interns spend 6 consecutive months (the second half of the year) in their chosen specialty, and 2 months surgery, 2 months in pediatrics, and 1 month in emergency medicine.
* "Rotating internship" offers a schedule that rotates through all the major specialties, including 3 months of [[internal medicine]], 2 months of [[pediatrics]], 2 months of [[surgery]], 1 month of [[emergency medicine]], 1 month of [[anesthesiology|anesthesiology and intensive care]], and 2 elective months.

Regardless of the chosen program, every intern gets a month off.

Some applicants prefer the rotating program because it generally is not as strenuous as a straight internship.  However, a straight year can provide better preparation for the second year of residency.

==Jordan==
In Jordan, after finishing medical school (6 years), medical students receive the M.D. degree but may only practice medicine after working in a hospital for 12 months. After completion of this year of hospital work, the student will be licensed to work as a GP.

==Lebanon==
In Lebanon, universities like the American University of Beirut (AUB), the University of Balamand (UOB), or the Lebanese American University (LAU), follow the curriculum similar to that of universities in the US. But other universities, that follow the French (European) system like Universite Saint Joseph (USJ) follow the French curriculum, this excludes for example Pre-medical studies (BS in science), instead the student is directly enrolled in a 7-year program during which he studies science and medicine.

==Malaysia==
Every medical graduate, from a Malaysian public or private university, or from an overseas-approved university/college, will have to apply for temporary registration with the [[Malaysian Medical Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmc.gov.my/v1/|title=Malaysian Medical Council|work=www.mmc.gov.my|accessdate=6 July 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150706133421/http://www.mmc.gov.my/v1/|archivedate=6 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the council has approved their application, they are listed as 'Approved for Consideration'. This Approval is required for them to apply for the position of Medical Graduate Officer (Pegawai Perubatan Siswazah) from the government, to be accepted into the government service.

Once the application has been accepted by the government ( through the process of an interview, and government servant compulsory course), the Council will register them as a Medical Graduate Officer with a Temporary Registration Number, which allows them to serve as house officers (called H.O. for short), working in major government hospitals only (ones with adequate consultants of each specialties/departments).

Upon the completion of rotations in:
*Internal medicine
*Surgery
*Paediatrics
*Orthopaedics,
*Obstetrics and Gynecology
*A choice of Emergency Medicine, Anaesthesiology, Psychiatry, Family Medicine;

for 4 months in each rotation (making a total of 24 months of housemanship), they will then be registered by the Malaysian Medical Council as “Fully Registered”.

The government service is compulsory for every medical graduate in order to obtain full registration with the Malaysian Medical Council, in order for them to practice independently.

There are cases where the period of 24 months of housemanship is extended due to incompetency and health reasons, which is under the jurisdiction of the Council. A fully registered doctor (called medical officer, MO) are then free to choose to work in the government sector or the private sector.

Consultants in this country, largely, refers to a doctor with completed specialty and subspecialty training and a Master or PhD degree, approved by the Council.

==Mexico==
In order to become a physician in Mexico, one must study 12 years of elementary and high school before entering [[medical school]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facmed.unam.mx/marco/index.php?dir_ver=16 Curriculum of Medical School at UNAM, México] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111002030446/http://www.facmed.unam.mx/marco/index.php?dir_ver=16 |date=2011-10-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Medical education includes:
 
* 5 years of medical school (10 semesters) that include basic sciences and clinical rotations.
* one year of [[rotating internship|rotating]] [[medical internship|internship]], in which the main objective is to become gradually responsible to manage clinical attention without supervision. Clinical areas included are: pediatrics, surgery, internal medicine, obstetrics and gynecology, emergency department, communitary medicine. 
* one year of [[social service]], whether the medical school one attends is private or public.

After completing medical school, the medical student is able to obtain a license to work as a general physician. If it is of interest of this general physician to train in a specific field such as pediatrics, internal medicine, orthopedic surgery, etc., he/she must complete a residency program of 3 to 7 years (it depends of the chosen field) to obtain a license to work as a specialist in such field.

==Nepal==
{{Main|Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship}}
After four and half years of medical school (degree of MBBS) every doctor in Nepal has to go through a one-year [[Compulsory Rotatory Residential Internship|compulsory rotatory internship]] in various specialities to get permanent registration in [[Nepal Medical Council]] as a physician.Internship should be completed from their own Medical college as recommended by NMC.Only after getting permanently registered with NMC, one is licensed to practice medicine as a primary care doctor throughout the Nepal.

==The Netherlands==
Netherlands historically had a 4-year preclinical phase completed by a master-equivalent pre-doctoral degree ([[doctorandus]]) followed by a two-year internship phase, with similar responsibilities to that of a US intern. The two-year training would lead to an M.D. degree with license for independent practice upon successful completion. With the introduction of the Bachelor/Master system as prescribed by the [[Bologna Process]], the medical education curriculum has been modified in all of the 8 medical schools in the country to consist of a three-year bachelor and a three-year master program. The bachelor phase is usually almost exclusively preclinical while the master will include internships, skills trainings and refresher courses, as well as a research internship. The "master" is awarded with an M.D. degree.

==Nigeria==
The internship program (Housemanship) is one-year period in most of the Hospitals in Nigeria. After internship program which is done under the supervision of qualified licensed doctors; each house officer is now required to do a compulsory one - year program in NYSC (National Youth Service Corp) where posted. During this period a provisional license must have been issued to house-officer by Nigeria Medical &amp; Dental Council in order for them to practice, temporarily with little or no supervision. Residency program is available for any medical doctor who wishes to continue in their medical career. This involves writing a postgraduate examination termed "primaries" in any faculty of choice.

==Peru==
In Peru, the medical intern is the seventh year medical student who must to complete the specialities of [[internal medicine]], [[obstetrics and gynaecology]], [[surgery]] and [[pediatrics]]. In some universities, mental health is also included in the 7th year curriculum. In some hospitals this period is paid.
[[Universidad Peruana Cayetano Heredia]] has internship and externship. Where the latter acts as an apprentice of the former, thus the medical student has two years of medical practice.

==Slovenia==
In Slovenia, medical graduates (after 6-year med school) must complete a six-month paid internship at a chosen medical institution. During the internship they must rotate through departments of internal medicine, surgery, pediatrics, OB/GYN, ENT, ophthalmology, emergency medicine and anesthesiology, with emphasys being given to emergencies in each department. Completing the internship is a condition for taking the professional medical exam, passing which gives doctor a license to practice medicine in Slovenia and apply for a specialization.

==South Africa==

An '''Internship''' is a compulsory (statutory) requirement that recently qualified doctors who are registered with the HPCSA work in designated hospitals under medical supervision for two years. They may work independently within this context in specified medical disciplines and for periods of time designated by the HPCSA. They are employed by the institution and this option is generally only available to South Africans.  Foreign qualified doctors that have recently qualified and do not have the required medical experience to register with the HPCSA may be requested by the HPCSA to do their internship in order to qualify for full registration. They either do this back in their country or in South Africa.

In South Africa, an '''elective''' for medical students is where a student arranges to visit a hospital for a short period (3 – 6 months) of time to gain experience in a different medical context,  where they will work under supervision and be mentored by experienced doctors.  It is primarily a learning experience, they cannot work independently and are required to register with HPCSA if they are foreign student.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hpcsa.co.za/PBOccupational/Registration |title=Professional Boards: registration |publisher=Health Professions Council of South Africa |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
The [[Healthcare in Sweden|Swedish]] equivalent to an internship is the ''allmäntjänstgöring'' ("general practice"), which is a requirement for obtaining a medical license. Its duration is stated as at least 18 months, but usually lasts a bit longer, 21 months in most cases. The students have to fulfill at least 9 months practice in medicine and surgery (at least 3 months of each, but mostly 6+6 months), 3 months psychiatry and 6 months as a GP.  After the ''allmäntjänstgöring'', the students have to complete a test from the National Board of Health and Welfare ("Socialstyrelsen"), to receive their medical license. Then follows specialisation practice ("specialisttjänstgöring"), the equivalent of residency.

==United Kingdom==
The [[United Kingdom|British]] equivalent of an intern is the Foundation Year 1 (F1, FY1) doctor, who is on the first year of their two-year [[Foundation Programme]], and has provisional registration with the [[General Medical Council]]. Before the introduction of the Foundation Programme in 2005, the equivalent post was called a "[[Foundation house officer|House officer]]" (also known as 'Junior House Officer' and latterly Pre-Registration House Officer or PRHO). Despite its technical obsolescence, the term "House Officer" is still used by many clinicians. (The term "[[Senior House Officer]]" or SHO is still used to refer to a tier of doctors which may include both those who are in the second year of Foundation Programme, and those who have begun a specialty training programme). The [[Foundation Programme]] is a 2 year long training period in which competencies are developed and documented.

==United States==
A medical [[internship]] typically lasts one year (a loose term) and usually begins on July 1. Internships come in two variations: transitional and specialty track. After a physician has completed an internship and Step&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[USMLE]] or Level&amp;nbsp;3 of the [[COMLEX-USA]], they can practice as a [[general practitioner]]. However, the majority of physicians complete a specialty track [[medical residency]] over two to seven years, depending on the specialty. The [[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] ([[ACGME]]) officially dropped the term "intern" in 1975, instead referring to individuals in their first year of graduate [[medical education]] as "[[Residency (medicine)|residents]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acgme.org/acgmeweb/Portals/0/PFAssets/ProgramRequirements/ab_ACGMEglossary.pdf |title=Glossary of terms July 1, 2013 |publisher=[[Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education]] |accessdate=5 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Venezuela==
In Venezuela there are two different types of medical internship. One is a two-year postgraduate internship and the other is a one-year compulsory pre graduation internship.
* Postgraduate internship: Is an elective two year postgraduate internship done in type III or IV hospitals. It is required for obtaining a medical license (the other option is a one-year rural setting work). The intern must complete for four month each of the specialities of internal medicine, obstetrics, a surgery block (general surgery and orthopedics surgery) and pediatrics. Also there is an six months externship in a city setting outpatient clinic.
* Pre graduation internship: In Venezuela there are 2 different types medical studies conducting to a medical degree. The program conducting to the degree of  "Médico cirujano"&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Médico#Denominaciones]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=February 2018}} during the final year or one and a half year, depending on the university program, has a compulsory internship program under the supervision of qualified licensed doctors at a type III or IV hospital. During this time, students will undergo basic hospital work. The intern must complete for eight weeks each of the specialities of internal medicine, obstetrics and gynaecology, general surgery, orthopedics surgery and pediatrics. Also there is an eight-week externship done in a rural outpatient clinic.

A '''lap book''', '''kakbook''', '''layer book''', '''flap book''', or '''shutter book''' is a type of single-subject [[book]] created by a student, generally as a supplement to a [[curriculum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hsunlimited.com/fullnews/15 |last= Rogers |first= Annette |title= Lap Books for Learning |publisher= Home Schooling Unlimited |accessdate= 2007-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lap book generally consists of a [[paperboard]] folder such as a file folder with small pieces of folded paper glued inside. These folded papers may contain facts, [[diagram]]s, [[illustration]]s, etc. related to the subject. Lap books can be adapted for any subject and grade level. Teachers and parents who use lap books with students say that they enhance creativity and critical thinking while integrating subjects such as science, language, history, geography, and mathematics, depending on the subject of the lap book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lapbookladies.com/what_is_a_lb.htm |title= What is a Lap Book? |publisher= Lap Book Ladies |year= 2005 |accessdate=2007-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Leadership High School''' is a public [[charter school|charter high school]] located in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. Founded in 1997, Leadership or "LHS" was California's first start-up charter high school. The school provides a college-preparatory curriculum and focuses on leadership development and social justice. 

During the school's first two years, it operated out of Golden Gate University. It then moved to the Excelsior District and occupied an elementary school facility owned by San Francisco Unified School District. In January 2007, the school was forced to move from that location, because the building was determined to not be earthquake-safe. Between January 2007 and June 2008, the school shared a facility with Philip and Sala Burton High School. Between August 2008 and spring 2015, the school shared a facility with James Denman Middle School, exclusively occupying the top floor of the building. As of Spring 2015, Leadership is again occupying its original Excelsior District site, after SFUSD completed a modernization project there. The current address of the school is 350 Seneca Avenue, San Francisco, CA.

The school enrolls approximately 270 students. By 2012, there were over  500 graduates,  with over 95% going on to college. &lt;ref&gt;"Fifteen year of success."[https://leadershiphigh.org/Fifteen-years-of-success.html School website] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121228030736/https://leadershiphigh.org/Fifteen-years-of-success.html |date=2012-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

(This school is not related to "Leadership Public Schools," a network of 4 charter high schools in the San Francisco Bay Area.)
  
The school has had four leaders in its history. As of 2012, the school is led by Executive Director Elizabeth Rood and Principal Anita Sufi &lt;ref&gt;"2011 - 2012 Faculty and Staff"[https://leadershiphigh.org/Faculty-and-Staff.html School web site] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20121221002132/https://leadershiphigh.org/Faculty-and-Staff.html |date=2012-12-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;   

==Coalition of Essential Schools (CES)==
In 1997 Leadership became a [[Coalition of Essential Schools]] National Affiliate School.

According to [[US News and World Report]], 99% of Leadership's student body is "of color," with 73% of the student body coming from an economically disadvantaged household, determined by student eligibility for California's [[Reduced-price meal]] program. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.usnews.com/education/best-high-schools/california/districts/san-francisco-unified-school-district/leadership-high-3264/student-body&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4867">'''Pre-tertiary-education accreditation''' is a type of [[quality assurance]] process used in the [[United States]] under which services and operations of [[K–12|pre-tertiary schools and educational institutions or programs]] are evaluated by an external body to determine if applicable standards are met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.advanc-ed.org/what-accreditation|title=What is accreditation?|publisher=[[AdvancED]]|accessdate=2010-09-05|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100907071332/http://www.advanc-ed.org/what-accreditation|archivedate=2010-09-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The initial focus of [[education accreditation]] was on [[secondary school]]s. For example, the [[North Central Association of Colleges and Schools]] was organized in 1895 with the objective of "the establishment of close relations between the colleges and secondary schools."&lt;ref name=NChistory&gt;[http://www.northcentralassociation.org/HISTORY%20OF%20THE%20NORTH%20CENTRAL%20ASSOCIATION.htm History of the North Central Association]&lt;/ref&gt; Better [[Articulation (education)|articulation]] between the two levels of education was a particular focus. In pursuit of that objective, the association undertook a thorough examination of education quality at both the secondary and college level. That examination process led to the establishment of an accreditation process for [[secondary school]]s. Accreditation of colleges and universities followed later.&lt;ref name=NChistory/&gt; The North Central Commission carried out the functions of post-secondary accreditation and accreditation of pre-college education through a unified organization until 2000, when its Commission on Schools (later NAC CASI and now merged into [[AdvancED]]) and its Commission on Institutions of Higher Education (now the [[Higher Learning Commission]]) were formed as independent corporations that began independent operation on January 1, 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20011015202644/http://www.ncahigherlearningcommission.org/resources/nca_sep_incorporation/index.html SEPARATE INCORPORATION OF THE COMMISSIONS OF THE NORTH CENTRAL ASSOCIATION], NCA Higher Learning Commission website; archived October 15, 2001 and [https://web.archive.org/web/20040612163235/http://www.ncahigherlearningcommission.org/resources/exchanges/Exch_Nov_00.pdf Initiating the New Corporation: The Higher Learning Commission], NCA ''Exchanges'' Newsletter, November 2000; archived June 12, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federal context==
In the [[United States]], educational accreditation has long been established as a [[peer review]] process coordinated by accreditation commissions and member institutions.{{fact|date=June 2013}} With the creation of the U.S. Department of Education and under the terms of the [[Higher Education Act of 1965]], as amended, the [[U.S. Secretary of Education]] is required by law to publish a list of [[nationally recognized accrediting agencies in the United States|nationally recognized accrediting agencies]] for higher education. There is no similar federal government list of recognised accreditation agencies for primary and secondary schools. [[State school|Public school]]s must adhere to criteria set by the [[U.S. state|state]] governments, and there is wide variation among the individual states in the requirements applied to non-public primary and secondary schools.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/pubs/RegPrivSchl/index.html State Regulation of Private Schools] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019084954/http://www2.ed.gov/pubs/RegPrivSchl/index.html |date=2010-10-19 }}, June 2000. U.S. Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; There are six [[Regional accreditation|regional accreditors]] in the United States that have historically accredited (and therefore include among their membership) most [[elementary school]]s, [[junior high school]]s, [[middle school]]s, [[high school]]s, as well as nearly all public and private institutions of [[higher education]] that are academic in nature.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

==Biography==
Princess Donna was born on January 23, 1982.&lt;ref name=iafd/&gt; She became interested in photography and the politics of sex and gender equality as a teen, and studied both at [[New York University]] and its [[Tisch School of the Arts]].&lt;ref name="sfbg"/&gt; While going to school she began working as a stripper, and says she later took her name "Donna" from another stripper she knew. She also started [[Bondage rigger|rigging]] and performing for New York BDSM pornography producer [[Insex]].

Immediately after graduation in 2004 she was hired as webmaster/director at a division of [[Kink.com]] and moved to [[San Francisco]] to direct, perform and develop ideas for new websites full-time. She took over directorship of Kink.com's ''Wired Pussy'', a pornographic website focusing on [[erotic electrostimulation]] of female [[Bottom (BDSM)|submissives]] by female [[Top (BDSM)|dominants]].  In addition to directing, she served as the principal dominant on the site, though other female dominants make guest appearances. In 2008 it was reported that she had directed and appeared in about 300 scenes for ''Wired Pussy''.&lt;ref name=Taormino1&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-04-22/columns/the-princess-and-the-submissive/ "The Princess and the Submissive"], ''[[Village Voice]]'', April 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of her first performances were as a submissive for Insex.com, but she did not perform male/female intercourse on camera until 2008: "The Training of O was the first site that combined enough serious BDSM with boy/girl sex to make me curious about trying it."  In 2008, Princess Donna developed a new site, ''PublicDisgrace.com'', which focused on the fetish of public humiliation of female submissives, and also featured male-female intercourse.&lt;ref name=AVN/&gt;

As of late 2012 she directed ''Public Disgrace'', ''Bound Gang Bangs'', and ''Ultimate Surrender''. Princess Donna is also a regular "character" on the reality-based queer serial pornographic website ''The Crash Pad Series''.

She left Kink in late 2014.

===Documentaries===
Along with [[Lorelei Lee (actress)|Lorelei Lee]], Princess Donna was the subject of Brian Lilla's 2007 independent film ''A Tale of Two Bondage Models'', which appeared at the 2008 [[Tribeca Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=Tribeca/&gt; She also appears in ''[[Graphic Sexual Horror]],'' a 2009 documentary about [[Insex]]. She appears, along with adult performers [[Lorelei Lee (actress)|Lorelei Lee]] and Isis Love, in the 2012 documentary ''Public Sex, Private Lives'' by Simone Jude, where she is interviewed about the lifestyle and workday of people who practice BDSM, and how it is becoming less taboo.&lt;ref name="Public Sex, Private Lives" /&gt;&lt;ref name="New Documentary That Will Challenge Everything You Know About Porn" /&gt;&lt;ref name="A Documentary on Porn Performers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Documentary on Kink.com Stars Seeks Kickstarter Crowdfunding" /&gt;

==Views on sexuality==
Princess Donna identifies her sexual identity as "[[queer]]," according to a 2008 interview in the ''[[Village Voice]]''. She said: "My sexuality lies outside the dominant culture of vanilla [[heteronormativity]]. I'm everything but straight. I like girls, I like boys, I like [[transgender]] boys and girls."&lt;ref name=Taormino2&gt;[http://www.villagevoice.com/2008-05-27/columns/the-training-of-o-turns-the-tables-on-a-well-known-domme/ "The Training of O Turns the Tables on a Well Known Domme"], ''[[Village Voice]]'', May 27, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

She has expressed a [[feminist]] perspective on her work: "I grew up in a ''[[The Silence of the Lambs (film)|Silence of the Lambs]]'' culture, a culture where rape and killing women are very common themes for movies and TV shows. Society isn't afraid of sex and violence; they are afraid of women owning their own bodies and controlling their own sexuality—which is what happens in BDSM."&lt;ref name=Taormino1/&gt;

== Personal life ==

==History==

===History of professional degrees in Europe===
The first doctorates were awarded in the mid twelfth century to recognise teachers (doctors) in mediaeval universities, either in civil law at the [[University of Bologna]]&lt;ref name=cathen&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/05072b.htm|title=Doctor|author=Pace, E. |date=1909|work=Catholic Encyclopaedia|via=New Advent|publisher=Robert Appleton Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in theology at the [[University of Paris]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|
|title=Changing doctoral degrees: an international perspective|author=Keith Allan Noble|publisher=Society for Research into Higher Education|date=1994 |page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Changing_doctoral_degrees.html?id=R4OdAAAAMAAJ&amp;redir_esc=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were followed shortly afterwards by doctorates in canon law, and then in the thirteenth century by doctorates in medicine, grammar, logic and philosophy. These mediaeval doctorates remained, however, essentially teaching qualifications, with their major importance being the ''ius ubique docendi'' – the right to teach anywhere.&lt;ref name=cathen/&gt; 

====History of professional degrees in the United Kingdom====

The first university medical school to be established in the United Kingdom was at the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1726, followed in 1744 by the [[University of Glasgow]]. In 1817 Glasgow became the first British university to offer a separate degree in surgery, the Master of Surgery. However, other Scottish universities – [[University of St Andrews|St Andrews]] and the two universities in Aberdeen – also offered medical degrees, often ''in absentia'' and without examination, despite not having medical schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=afYzWG1FLroC&amp;pg=PA251&amp;lpg=PA251&amp;f=false#v=onepage|work=The History of Medical Education: An International Symposium|author=L. R. C. Agnew|editor=Charles Donald O'Malley|publisher=University of California Press|date=1970|title=Scottish Medical Education|pages=251–262}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England, the two universities (Oxford and Cambridge) were only sporadically interested in medical teaching, which was mainly carried out in the London hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=afYzWG1FLroC&amp;pg=PA235&amp;lpg=PA235&amp;f=false#v=onepage |work= The History of Medical Education: An International Symposium |author= F.N.L. Poynter |editor= Charles Donald O'Malley |publisher=University of California Press |date=1970 |title= "Medical Education in England from 1600" |pages= 235–250}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not until the establishment of the [[University of London]] in 1836, however, that students at the hospital medical schools could earn degrees. Following the passing of the [[Medical Act 1858]] and the establishment of the [[General Medical Council]], Scottish graduates gained the right to practice in England and degrees in both medicine and surgery became the norm. The Scottish practice of awarding the [[Doctor of Medicine]] (MD) as a first degree was abolished by the university commissioners appointed under the [[Ancient university governance in Scotland#The Universities (Scotland) Acts|Universities (Scotland) Act 1858]], it being replaced by the Bachelor of Medicine and [[Master of Surgery]] (MS), with the MD becoming a higher degree as in England. The commissioners under the [[Ancient university governance in Scotland#The Universities (Scotland) Acts|Universities (Scotland) Act 1889]] completed the reform by replacing the MS with the Bachelor of Surgery, the MS joining the MD as a higher degree and the initial professional qualification taking on its modern form as the double [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FDpAAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR16#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=General Report of the Commissioners Under the Universities (Scotland) Act, 1889|page=xvi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first university in England to offer training in theology for those intending to become priests in the [[Church of England]] was the [[University of Durham]] in 1833, following the lead of colleges such as [[St Bees Theological College]] and [[St David's College, Lampeter]]. The Licence in Theology could be taken as either a one year graduate course, following on from a BA, or a three year undergraduate course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nineteenth-century Anglican Theological Training: The Redbrick Challenge|page=24|author=David A.

Anglican [[theological college]]s partnered with local universities to offer professional degrees in theology and ministry during the twentieth century. Since 2014, however, the [[Common Award]] degrees, validated by Durham, have offered a more unified training across the theological colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/clergy-office-holders/ministry/ministerial-education-and-development/common-awards-in-theology,-ministry-and-mission/about-the-common-awards.aspx|title=About the Common Awards|publisher=The Church of England|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160313123022/https://www.churchofengland.org/clergy-office-holders/ministry/ministerial-education-and-development/common-awards-in-theology,-ministry-and-mission/about-the-common-awards.aspx|archive-date=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some colleges continue to offer other degrees in addition to the Common Awards, such as the Cambridge Bachelor of Theology at the [[Cambridge Theological Federation]]

Legal studies in England were mainly confined to the Inns of Court until the late nineteenth century. The only undergraduate course was at Cambridge and concentrated on Roman [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] rather than English [[common law]]; in terms of employment that the bishops accepted it as equivalent to a BA for ordination was more useful than the legal training it provided, and it was generally seen as an easy option for those who couldn't cope with the mathematics on the BA course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VoMPRz8nYQEC&amp;pg=187#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=A History of the University of Cambridge:, Volume 3; Volumes 1750-1870|pages=187–190|author=Peter Searby|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cambridge reformed its course in 1858, and London established an undergraduate course a few years later. However, it has only been since the 1960s that law schools have taken on a leading role in training lawyers and truly established professional degrees.&lt;ref name=Langbein1996&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.law.yale.edu/system/files/documents/pdf/Faculty/Langbein_Scholarly_and_Professional_Objectives_in_Legal_Education.pdf|author=John H. Langbein|title=Scholarly and Professional Objectives in Legal Education: American Trends and English Comparisons|work= Pressing Problems in the Law, Volume 2: What are Law Schools For?|publisher= Oxford University Press|date= 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the latter part of the twentieth century, many chartered bodies introduced educational requirements for their [[Chartered (professional)|chartered professional]] statuses, most notably the [[Engineering Council]] requirements for [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]]. This led to the accreditation of degrees by the relevant professional bodies and, in the case of engineering, to the [[Washington Accord]] – an international agreement between engineering regulatory bodies to recognise professional degrees accredited in each country – signed originally in 1989 by the UK, US, Australia, Canada, Ireland and New Zealand, and since expanded to include many other countries.&lt;ref name="Washington Accord"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieagreements.org/Washington-Accord/|title=The Washington Accord|publisher=International Engineering Alliance|accessdate=6 October 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009140626/http://www.ieagreements.org/Washington-Accord/|archivedate=9 October 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twenty-first century, the standard professional degree for many science and engineering fields was raised from bachelor's to master's level, including for qualification as a [[Chartered Physicist]] (from 2001), [[Chartered Scientist]] (from 2004) and Chartered Engineer (from 2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iop.org/about/royal_charter/file_38390.pdf| title=Charter and Bylaws|accessdate=26 June 2016|publisher=Institute of Physics|pages=9–10|

===History of professional degrees in North America===
The M.B. or Bachelor of Medicine was the first medical degree to be granted in the United States and Canada. The first medical schools that granted the M.B. degree were at the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine|University of Pennsylvania]] and [[Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons|Columbia University]]. Columbia University was the first American university to grant the M.D. degree in 1770, although, as in England, this followed the M.B. (which was the qualifying degree) and required completion of a thesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1750435/pdf/bullnyacadmed00232-0053.pdf|title= The Kissam Family: Its Importance in New York Medicine|author=Paul Cushman, Jr.|page=691| volume= 45|issue=7|date=July 1969|journal=[[Bulletin of the New York Academy of Medicine]]|pmc=1750435|pmid=4895796}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ps.columbia.edu/about-ps/history-college-physicians-and-surgeons|title=History of the College of Physicians and Surgeons|publisher=Columbia University|accessdate=7 October 2016|quote=King's College organized a medical faculty in 1767 and was the first institution in the North American Colonies to confer the degree of Doctor of Medicine. The first graduates in medicine from the College were Robert Tucker and Samuel Kissarn, who received the degree of Bachelor of Medicine in May 1769, and that of Doctor of Medicine in May 1770 and May 1771, respectively.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/about_columbia/history.html |title=History &amp;#124; Columbia University in the City of New York |publisher=Columbia.edu |date= |accessdate=2013-07-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Professional societies started licensing doctors from the 1760s, and in the early nineteenth century started setting up their own medical schools, known as  proprietary medical colleges, the first being the medical college of the Medical Society of the County of New York, which opened March 12, 1807. These eliminated the general education and long lecture terms of the university schools, making them much more popular. Without effective regulation, abuses arose, and national conventions in 1846 and 1847 led to the establishment of the [[American Medical Association]]. This new body set the first nationwide standards for M.D. degrees, requiring that students had a liberal education in arts and sciences as part of their degree, that they had served an apprenticeship before starting the course, and that the course lasted three years.&lt;ref name=Medline&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/article/001936.htm|title=Doctor of medicine profession (MD)|work=Medical Encyclopedia|publisher=MedlinePlus|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The M.D. was thus the first entry-level professional degree to be awarded as a purely trade school 'doctor'-degree in the United States, before the first European-style doctorate, the Ph.D., was awarded by an American Institution in 1861,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guides.library.yale.edu/c.php?g=296074&amp;p=1976335|title=Yale History Timeline: 1860 - 1869|accessdate=7 October 2016|publisher=Yale University Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the M.D. was not established as a post-baccalaureate degree until much later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdBXMiac6l0C&amp;pg=PA304#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=In 1891 the program leading to an M.D. was three years in length and required no college preparation|title=Stand, Columbia: A History of Columbia University|author=Robert McCaughey|publisher=Columbia University Press|date=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The President of [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Arthur Twining Hadley]], stated in the early 20th century that: "However convenient it might be to insist on the possession of a bachelor's degree by all pupils in the schools of law or medicine, I feel that it would be a violation of our duty to these professions to hedge ourselves about by any such artificial limitations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1632910|journal=Science| title=On the Granting of the M.D. Degree
|author=Edwin Linton
|volume= 22| issue= 574 |date=29 December 1905 |pages= 875–876|doi=10.1126/science.22.574.875}}&lt;/ref&gt; This changed (for medicine) after [[Abraham Flexner]]'s damning [[Flexner report|report]] into the state of medical education in 1910: by 1930 almost all medical schools required a previous liberal arts degree before starting the M.D. course.&lt;ref name=Medline/&gt;

Law degrees were introduced in the US by the [[William &amp; Mary Law School|College of William &amp; Mary]] in 1792, with its "Batchellor of Law" (sic) (L.B.) degree. This was followed by the "Graduate of Law" at the [[University of Virginia School of Law|University of Virginia]] in 1829, which became the first American LL.B. in 1840. The J.D. was introduced by the [[University of Chicago Law School|University of Chicago]] in 1902, with the same curriculum as the LL.B. but requiring a previous B.A. or B.S. for entry. The J.D. spread, but encountered opposition, and [[Harvard Law School|Harvard]], which imposed graduate entry as a requirement for its LL.B. course in 1909, and [[Yale Law School|Yale]] used the name for their post-LL.B. degree, elsewhere called the LL.M. By the 1930s, when most law schools had shifted to graduate entry, the standard degree was once again the LL.B. The second shift to the J.D., again without a change of curriculum, came in the 1960s, with all [[American Bar Association]]-accredited professional degrees adopting the nomenclature by 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mobar.org/uploadedFiles/Home/Publications/Precedent/2013/Winter/doctors.pdf|title=HOW DID LAWYERS BECOME "DOCTORS"? FROM THE LL.B. TO THE J.D.|author=David Perry|publisher=New York State Bar Association|date=June 2012|work=New York State Bar Association Journal|volume= 84|issue= 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late twentieth and early twenty-first century, other professions, particularly in clinical fields, transitioned their professional degrees to doctorates, following the example of the M.D. and J.D. In the 1990s there was also some debate in the architectural community about renaming the professional degree in architecture a "doctorate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Joanna Lombard|url=http://arc.miami.edu/ACSA.AM.85.137.pdf |title=LL.B. to J.D. and the Professional Degree in Architecture|journal=Proceedings of the 85th ACSA Annual Meeting, Architecture: Material and Imagined and Technology Conference|date=1997|pages=585–591}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of professional doctorates raised concerns about the standards of the new degrees, particularly in cases such as Physical Therapy, where the standard set by the [[American Physical Therapy Association]] for the doctorate is the same as that for the master's degree. Critics have claimed that these degrees should not be called doctorates, pointing out that a Ph.D. takes an average of twelve years from the start of college, compared to five and a half to eight years for professional doctorates, while defenders of the new professional doctorates have said the point of comparison should be the M.D. and J.D., not the Ph.D.&lt;ref name=creep&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.csun.edu/pubrels/clips/June07/06-18-07M.pdf |title=Credential Creep |work=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=2007-06-27 |accessdate=2012-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional degrees by country==

===United States===
Among the professional degrees in the United States, one particular form was the graduate-entry first-professional degree, often denominated as a doctorate. The [[United States Department of Education|U.S. Department of Education]] defines these as: "A first-professional degree was an award that required completion of a program that met all of the following criteria: (1) completion of the academic requirements to begin practice in the profession; (2) at least 2 years of college work prior to entering the program; and (3) a total of at least 6 academic years of college work to complete the degree program, including prior required college work plus the length of the professional program itself."&lt;ref name="NCES Glossary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryPopup.aspx?idlink=235|website=National Center for Education Statistics|title= First-professional |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the term "first-professional" was discontinued by the Department of Education as of 2010-11, when new post-baccalaureate award categories were introduced.&lt;ref name="IPEDS reclassification"&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140727091222/http://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/factsheets/fct_ipeds_new_award_levels.asp|archive-date=27 July 2014|publisher=Integrated Postsecondary Education Data System|url= https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/factsheets/fct_ipeds_new_award_levels.asp|title= MAPPING OLD POST-BACCALAUREATE AWARD LEVELS WITH NEW AWARD LEVELS}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this, first-professional degrees were awarded in the following fields:&lt;ref name="NCES Glossary"/&gt;

&lt;!--This is a list of degrees formerly recognised by IPEDS as first professional degrees NOT a list of current professional doctorates--&gt;
*Chiropractic (D.C.) 
*Dentistry (D.D.S., D.M.D.) 
*Law (LL.B., J.D.)
*Medicine (M.B., M.D.) 
*Optometry (O.D.) 
*Osteopathic Medicine (D.O.) 
*Pharmacy (Pharm.D.)
*Podiatry (D.P.M.)
*Theology (M.Div, S.T.B., B.D.)
*Veterinary Medicine (D.V.M., V.M.D.)
&lt;!--This is a list of degrees formerly recognised by IPEDS as first professional degrees NOT a list of current professional doctorates--&gt;

Since 2011, the classification "doctor's degree - professional practice" has been used for "[a] doctor's degree that is conferred upon completion of a program providing the knowledge and skills for the recognition, credential, or license required for professional practice." As with the "first professional degree", this classification also requires that the total time in higher education is at least six years, although the requirement for at least two years of college-level study prior to entering the program was removed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryPopup.aspx?idlink=942|website=National Center for Education Statistics|title= Doctor's degree-professional practice |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Education does not define which fields professional doctorates may be awarded in, unlike with the "first professional degree". Besides professional doctorates, other professional degrees can exist that use the title of bachelor or master, e.g. B.Arch. and M.Arch. in architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naab.org/architecture-programs/|title=Architecture Programs|publisher=National Architecture Accreditation Board|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, first professional degrees in theology, which did not use the title of doctor, were reclassified as master's degrees in 2011 - including the B.D.&lt;ref name="IPEDS reclassification"/&gt;

A distinction is drawn in the US between professional doctorates and "doctor's degree - research/scholarship", with the latter being "[a] Ph.D. or other doctor's degree that requires advanced work beyond the master's level, including the preparation and defense of a dissertation based on original research, or the planning and execution of an original project demonstrating substantial artistic or scholarly achievement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryPopup.aspx?idlink=941|website=National Center for Education Statistics|title= Doctor's degree-research/scholarship |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Internationally, US professional doctorates (which, unlike research doctorates, are not defined as requiring work beyond the master's level) are not generally considered to be doctoral level qualifications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_policy_phd_and_equivalent_degrees.pdf |title=PhD and Equivalent Doctoral Degrees: The ERC Policy |publisher= European Research Council|quote=First-professional degrees will not be considered in themselves as PhD-equivalent, even if recipients carry the title "Doctor".|accessdate=2013-05-25|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106105821/http://erc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/document/file/erc_policy_phd_and_equivalent_degrees.pdf|archive-date=2013-11-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://internacional.ipvc.pt/sites/default/files/Reconhecimento%2520de%2520qualifica%25C3%25A7oes_EN.pdf|title=Recognition of Qualifications|page=49|accessdate=18 September 2016|publisher=NARIC Portugal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207230115/http://internacional.ipvc.pt/sites/default/files/Reconhecimento%20de%20qualifica%C3%A7oes_EN.pdf|archivedate=7 February 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.epnuffic.nl/en/publications/find-a-publication/education-system-united-states.pdf|publisher=NUFFIC|page=3|title=The  American education system described  and compared  with the  Dutch system|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eua.be/eua/jsp/en/upload/Review%2520of%2520Professional%2520Doctorates_Ireland2006.1164040107604.pdf|publisher=National Qualifications Authority of Ireland |page=3|title=Review of Professional Doctorates|date=October 2006|quote=The ‘1st professional degree’ is a  first degree, not a graduate degree even though it incorporates the word ‘doctor’ in the title|accessdate=18 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/ISCEDMappings/Documents/North%20America%20and%20Western%20Europe/USA_ISCED_mapping.xls|title=ISCED 1997 Mappings - United States|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uis.unesco.org/Education/ISCEDMappings/Documents/ISCED%202011%20Mappings/ISCED_2011_Mapping_EN_USA.xlsx|title=ISCED 2011 Mappings - United States|publisher=[[UNESCO]]|accessdate=5 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The classification of "Doctor's degree - other" also exists for doctorates that do not meet the definition of either professional doctorates or research doctorates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://surveys.nces.ed.gov/ipeds/VisGlossaryPopup.aspx?idlink=943|website=National Center for Education Statistics|title= Doctor's degree-other |accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professional fields offer degrees beyond the professional doctorate or other degree required for qualification, sometimes termed post-professional degrees. Higher professional degrees may also be offered in fields that do not have specific academic requirements for entry, such as Fine Arts. These degrees may be at master's or doctorate levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncarb.org/Experience-Through-Internships/IDP2-Experience-Settings/IDP2-Supplemental-Experience-Elective/Post-Professional-Degrees-Overview/Post-Professional-Degree-Programs.aspx|title=Advanced Degree Programs|publisher=[[National Council of Architectural Registration Boards]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jefferson.edu/university/health-professions/departments/occupational-therapy/degrees-programs/doctorate-programs/post-professional.html|title=Post-Professional Doctorate|publisher=[[Thomas Jefferson University]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gradschool.cornell.edu/requirements/academic-requirements/professional-degrees|title=Professional Degrees|publisher=[[Cornell University]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Professional degrees in the United Kingdom===

Professional degrees in the UK are accredited by professional, statutory and regulatory bodies, which work with the [[Quality Assurance Agency]] on defining benchmark statements for their subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/partners/professional-bodies|title=Professional, statutory and regulatory bodies (PSRBs)|publisher=Quality Assurance Agency|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific benchmark statements have also been produced for professional qualifications in Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/assuring-standards-and-quality/the-quality-code/subject-benchmark-statements/professions-in-scotland|title=Professions in Scotland|publisher=Quality Assurance Agency|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many professional degrees span teaching at bachelor's and master's level, leading to a master's level award. This includes older degrees that retain the names of bachelor's degrees for historic reasons, e.g. the [[Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery]] (MBBS, MBChB, etc.), [[Bachelor of Dental Surgery]] (BDS) and [[Bachelor of Veterinary Science]] (BVS), and newer integrated master's degrees such as the [[Master of Engineering]] (MEng) or [[Master of Pharmacy]] (MPharm).&lt;ref name="QAA Master's"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2977#.V_nHc2UXZSA|title=Master's Degree Characteristics Statement|date=September 2015|accessdate=8 October 2016|publisher=Quality Assurance Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=targetjobs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://targetjobs.co.uk/career-sectors/engineering/282495-becoming-a-chartered-or-incorporated-engineer-after-starting-a-graduate-job|title=Becoming a chartered or incorporated engineer after starting a graduate job|publisher=Target Jobs|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some subjects, qualification can be via separate bachelor's and master's degrees, e.g. a [[Bachelor of Engineering]] (BEng) followed by a [[Master of Science]] (MSc) in Engineering,&lt;ref name=targetjobs/&gt; or a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) or [[Bachelor of Science]] (BSc) in Architecture followed by a year of professional experience, then a two-year [[Master of Architecture]] (MArch).&lt;ref name=RIBA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.architecture.com/Files/RIBAProfessionalServices/Education/CareersInArchitecture/ThinkArchitecture.pdf|title=Think Architecture|publisher=[[Royal Institute of British Architecture]]|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some subjects the normal professional degree is a bachelor's degree, e.g. the [[Bachelor of Laws]] (LLB) or BA in Law (for both [[solicitors]] and [[barristers]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sra.org.uk/students/courses/qualifying-law-degree-providers.page|title=Qualifying law degree providers|publisher=Solicitors Regulation Authority|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a BSc in Surveying.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rics.org/uk/join/student/from-student-to-surveyor/school-student/|title=School student|date=17 Apr 2012|publisher=[[Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors]]|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some professional bodies also offer different levels of professional recognition, e.g. a master's degree is needed for [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineers]] or [[Chartered Scientist]]s but a bachelor's degree for [[Incorporated Engineer]]s and a bachelor's or [[foundation degree]] for [[Registered Scientist]]s.&lt;ref name=targetjobs/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsc.org/careers/cpd/practising-scientists/|publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]]|title=Professional recognition for practising scientists|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is common for professional qualification in the UK to require professional experience in addition to academic qualification. For Architecture, the standard route has a year of experience between the bachelor's and master's stages and a further year after the master's before the final examination;&lt;ref name=RIBA/&gt; becoming a Chartered Engineer requires post-degree [[Initial Professional Development]] that typically takes four to six years;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://targetpostgrad.com/subjects/built-environment/getting-from-masters-to-chartered-engineer-status|title=Getting from masters to chartered engineer status|accessdate=9 October 2016|publisher=TARGETpostgrad}}&lt;/ref&gt; becoming a [[General Practitioner]] requires five years of study beyond the MBBS, while qualifying as a [[Consultant (medicine)|Consultant]] takes seven to nine more years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131024103014/http://bma.org.uk/-/media/Files/Word%20files/News%20views%20analysis/pressbriefing_medical%20training%20uk.doc|url=http://bma.org.uk/-/media/Files/Word%20files/News%20views%20analysis/pressbriefing_medical%20training%20uk.doc|archive-date=24 October 2013|title=Medical training in the UK|publisher=[[British Medical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to initial professional degrees, some professional master's degrees and most professional doctorates, e.g. the [[Master of Business Administration]] (MBA), [[Doctor of Education]] (EdD) and [[Doctor of Engineering]] (EngD), are offered for those already established in professions. UK professional doctorates are research degrees at the same level as PhDs, normally including teaching at doctoral level but still assessed by a doctoral research thesis or equivalent.&lt;ref name="QAA Master's"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qaa.ac.uk/publications/information-and-guidance/publication?PubID=2975#.V_nHa2UXZSA|title=Doctoral Degree Characteristics Statement|date=September 2015|accessdate=8 October 2016|publisher=Quality Assurance Agency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some professional degrees are designed specifically for trainees or members within a particular organisation, rather than being available via general enrolment. Examples of these include the [[Church of England]]'s [[Common Award]]s with [[Durham University]] and the [[Association of Chartered Certified Accountants]]' BSc in Applied Accounting with [[Oxford Brookes University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.churchofengland.org/clergy-office-holders/ministry/ministerial-education-and-development/common-awards-in-theology,-ministry-and-mission.aspx|title=About the Common Awards|publisher=Church of England|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accaglobal.com/gb/en/student/exam-entry-and-administration/oxford-brookes-bsc-hons-in-applied-accounting.html|publisher=Association of Chartered Certified Accountants|title=DEGREE IN APPLIED ACCOUNTING|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, individual countries specify rules for recognising foreign qualifications; in the US, for example, this is carried out by the [[Educational Commission for Foreign Medical Graduates]] (ECFMG) and in the UK by the [[General Medical Council]] (GMC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ecfmg.org/forms/certfact.pdf|title=Certification Factsheet|publisher=ECFMG|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmc-uk.org/doctors/registration_applications/acceptable_primary_medical_qualification.asp|title=Acceptable overseas medical qualifications|publisher=GMC|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Australian Medical Council]], US ECFMG, UK GMC, [[Medical Council of Canada]], Danish Health and Medicines Authority and Korean Institute of Medical Education and Evaluation jointly sponsor the [[World Directory of Medical Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wdoms.org/sponsors/|title=Sponsors|publisher=World Federation for Medical Education and the Foundation for Advancement of International Medical Education and Research|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At least one state in the US, [[Wisconsin]], permits foreign graduates to use the title "MD" if licensed to practice in the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/_WMS/legislation/_files/pdf/compendium/practice97-112.pdf |archive-date=16 February 2008|title=Practice, Organization and Interprofessional Issues|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080216111845/http://wisconsinmedicalsociety.org/_WMS/legislation/_files/pdf/compendium/practice97-112.pdf |work= Wisconsin Medical Society Policy Compendium 2007|page=108|id=PHY-007 Use of the MD Title}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In engineering===
{{see also|Regulation and licensure in engineering}}

In engineering, the [[Washington Accord]] (1989) recognised that the academic training (i.e. professional degrees) for full professional status ([[Professional Engineer]], [[Chartered Engineer (UK)|Chartered Engineer]], [[European Engineer]] etc.) is equivalent in the signatory countries.&lt;ref name="Washington Accord"/&gt; Similarly the [[Sydney Accord]] (2001) recognises similar academic training between signatories for [[Engineering Technologist]]s, [[Incorporated Engineer]]s, etc. and the [[Dublin Accord]] (2002) for [[Engineering Technician]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieagreements.org/sydney/|title=Sydney Accord|publisher=International Engineering Alliance|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ieagreements.org/Dublin/|title=Dublin Accord|publisher=International Engineering Alliance|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For computing and information technology, the [[Seoul Accord]] (2008) recognises similar academic training on accredited courses for computing and information technology professionals in the signatory countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seoulaccord.org/about.php?id=91|title=About the Seoul Accord|publisher=Seoul Accord Secretariat|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Qatar Foundation for Education, Science and Community Development''' ({{lang-ar|مؤسسة قطر}}) is a semi-private [[charter]]ed, [[non-profit organization]] in [[Qatar]], founded in 1995 by then-[[List of emirs of Qatar|emir]] Sheikh [[Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani]] and his second wife [[Moza bint Nasser]]. In addition to private funding, it is government-supported and in some ways government-funded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/hrrpt/2010/nea/154471.htm |title=2010 Human Rights Report: Qatar |publisher=US Department of State |date=2011-04-08 |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qatar Foundation (QF), chaired by [[Sheikha]] Moza bint Nasser, has spearheaded Qatar's endeavors to establish itself as a leader in education, science, and cultural development on both a regional and global scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ocnus.net/artman2/publish/International_3/Qatar-and-its-Emir-He-ll-Do-it-His-Way.shtml |title=Qatar and its emir: He'll do it his way |publisher=The Economist |date=27 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; QF has stated an aim "to support Qatar on its journey from a carbon economy to a knowledge economy by unlocking human potential."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qf.org.qa/discover-qf/about-qf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121102034036/http://www.qf.org.qa/discover-qf/about-qf|archive-date=2012-11-02|title=About Qatar Foundation |publisher=Qatar Foundation |date= |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's initiatives are oriented towards education, science and research, and community development. It has solicited a number of international universities to establish campuses in Qatar as part of its goal to develop a youth population with the necessary expertise to maintain a [[knowledge economy]]. Its main science and research agenda is developing Qatar's technological capacity by researching new technologies which can be successfully commercialized. In addition to diversifying the economy, this strategy also helps satisfy Qatar's aim of becoming a research and development hub.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qf-research-division.org/about.html |title=About us|publisher=Qatar Foundation Research &amp; Development|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation's social development programs aim to preserve Qatar's culture, "foster a progressive society" and to confront pressing social issues.&lt;ref name="qftele"/&gt;

[[Joint venture]] partnerships in the areas of [[design]], [[information and communication technologies]], policy studies, and [[event management]] also contribute to fulfilling the objectives of Qatar Foundation. Several small Qatari firms have thrived under the auspices of the Foundation; one example being Pragmatech, a subsidiary of United Development Company which has established a reputation for its text processing, document summarizing and referencing software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mondediplo.com/2011/09/11oil |title=From oil to business tourism |publisher=Le Monde Diplomatique |date=11 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==

=== K–12 education===
In primary and secondary education, Qatar Foundation has several initiatives. Examples include establishing five [[Qatar Academy]] branches,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qf.org.qa/news/qatar-academy-msheireb-opens-doors|title=Qatar Academy Msheireb Opens Its Doors|publisher=Qatar Foundation|date=17 September 2014|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; opening Awsaj Academy, a school for children with learning difficulties,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.albawaba.com/business/pr/qatar-foundation%E2%80%99s-awsaj-academy-students-win-prestigious-awards-pioneering-research-716|title=Qatar Foundation’s Awsaj Academy students win prestigious awards for pioneering research|publisher=Al Bawaba|date=7 July 2015|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and opening Qatar Leadership Academy in collaboration with the [[Qatar Armed Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://qla.edu.qa/en/about/history.html|title=History|publisher=Qatar Leadership Academy|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the foundation launched the Academic Bridge Program, a post-[[secondary school]] program that helps students transition from high school to university.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeninsulaqatar.com/doha-today/campus-plus/332473/academic-bridge-program-hosts-international-college-fair|title=Academic Bridge Program hosts international college fair|publisher=The Peninsula|date=15 April 2015|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major reform of the K–12 education system was embarked upon by Qatar Foundation in 2003, resulting in the formation of the [[RAND|RAND-Qatar Policy Institute]] and the subsequent publishing of the institute's assessment and recommendations in ''Education for a New Era: Design and Implementation of K-12 Education Reform in Qatar''. As a response to declining standardized test scores, Qatar Foundation terminated its partnership with the RAND Corporation in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dohanews.co/rand-and-qatar-foundation-officially-part-ways-after-10-years/|title=Rand and Qatar Foundation officially part ways after 10 years|publisher=Doha News|author=Shabina S.

===Higher education===
In [[higher education]], Qatar Foundation established branch campuses of eight international universities at the main campus just outside Doha:
* 1998 – [[Virginia Commonwealth University]], with programs in art and design.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.vcu.edu/article/VCU_School_of_the_Arts_in_Qatar_Celebrates_10th_Anniversary|title=VCU School of the Arts in Qatar Celebrates 10th Anniversary|publisher=VCU News|author=Tom Gresham|date=14 November 2008|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2002 – [[Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar|Weill Cornell Medicine-Qatar]] opened, offering a two-year pre-medical program and a four-year medical program leading to an MD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://weill.cornell.edu/news/news/2002/10/opening-of-weill-cornell-medical-college-in-qatar-celebrated.html|title=Opening of Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar Celebrated|publisher=Weill Cornell Medical College|date=12 October 2002|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* 2003 – [[Texas A&amp;M University at Qatar]] opened, offering programs in chemical, electrical, petroleum, and [[mechanical engineering]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.texastribune.org/2012/05/25/after-10-years-qatar-m-looking-forward-10-more/|title=After 10 Years in Qatar, A&amp;M Looking Forward to 10 More|publisher=The Texas Tribune|author=Reeve Hamilton|date=25 May 2012|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These centers sit alongside the Qatar Faculty of Islamic Studies which began its first graduate classes in the 2007–2008 academic year. An international center for Islamic thinking and dialogue, it aims to produce scholars who are grounded in Islamic faith, practice and civilization. It offers master's degrees in [[Islamic finance]], contemporary Islamic studies and Islamic public policy.

Roughly half of these universities' students are Qatari,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stSsFxDTl4QC&amp;pg=PA239|title=The Report: Qatar 2008|publisher=Oxford Business Group|year=2008|page=239}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it is claimed that around 90 different nationalities in total are represented by the students, faculty and staff at the Foundation campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qf.org.qa/news/siblings-embrace-qatar-foundations-vision|title=Siblings Embrace Qatar Foundation’s Vision|format=Press release|publisher=Qatar Foundation|date=20 September 2015|accessdate=29 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Foundation has managed to make an impact within its first decade or so in operation. Scholars at the centers such as Weill Cornell Medical College have made contributions to studies on genetics and AIDS, and the peer-reviewed periodical Academic Medicine published a study on Weill Cornell Medical College’s Medical Ethics and Humanities course for premedical students.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellibs.com/book/9783642050800/genetic-disorders-among-arab-populations |title=Genetic Disorders Among Arab Populations |author=Teebi, Ahmad |publisher=Springer  |year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The course, first offered in 2003, is designed to prepare students for the medical school curriculum, and the report pointed to challenges such as cross-cultural tensions that could emerge when introducing themes from Western medical ethics and humanities into an Islamic context like Qatar. "The authors outline the response to this challenge and strategies to broaden student inquiry without engaging in indoctrination," it said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ellibs.com/book/9783642050800/genetic-disorders-among-arab-populations |title=The Globalization of Education in Medical Ethics and Humanities: Evolving Pedagogy at Weill Cornell Medical College in Qatar |authors=del Pozo, Pablo Rodríguez, and Fins, Joseph |work=Academic Medicine  |date=February 2005 |volume=80 |issue=2 |pages=135–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Queen Sofía Spanish Institute''' is an organization in [[New York City]] founded to promote the [[Spanish language]] and the culture of [[Spain]]. Its office is located at 575 Madison Avenue, New York City following the sale of the 684 [[Park Avenue (Manhattan)|Park Avenue]] in 2016.

== '''History''' ==

The Spanish Institute was founded in 1954. From this time, the Institute served as a hub for American-Spanish cultural affairs. 

Since the sale of the building, the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute is reorganizing its activities with other Spanish and Latin Centric organizations by cosponsoring of lectures, symposiums and meetings to discuss economic, political and social issues.  The institute was named in honor of [[Queen Sofía of Spain]], the Patroness of this non for profit corporation.

The president and CEO is David Askren and the Executive Director since September, 2017 is Patrice Degnan Erquicia.

=='''Background'''==

Queen Sofía Spanish Institute has maintained a strong commitment to the fine arts by exhibiting major masters and newly emerging artists from Spain, Latin America and Europe. Exhibitions on themes related to Spanish art and the Spanish tradition in the Americas are offered throughout the year at the Institute's two galleries. The Institute most recent cultural endeavor was an exhibition entitled ''Balenciaga:Spanish Master''. This was the first exhibition to consider the impact of Spain’s culture, history and art on one of its greatest twentieth century sons, the legendary designer [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]] (1895–1972). Conceived of by our Chairman, [[Oscar de la Renta]], and curated by [[Hamish Bowles]], the exhibition drew on Balenciaga clothing and supporting historical and regional Spanish dress from museum and private collections in the United States, Canada, France and Spain. The exhibition and its accompanying catalogue focused on the influence of Balenciaga’s native country on the designer’s creative process and work, considered the influences on his designs of the country’s great artists, from [[Zurbarán]] and [[Goya]] to [[Picasso]] and [[Miró]]; significant Spanish works of art and decorative arts supported the curatorial thesis of the exhibition to create a compelling, lively, and dramatic vision of Spain in all its glory, and the work of its most masterful designer. The exhibition took place from November 17, 2010 to February 19, 2011.

Another exhibition from this past year was ''Re-imagining Don Quixote'', an exhibition of the Arion Press handcrafted edition of [[Edith Grossman]]’s translated ''[[Don Quixote]]'', illustrated by the acclaimed contemporary artist [[William T. Wiley]] and designed by Arion Press Founder [[Andrew Hoyem]]. The exhibition was in conjunction with America's Society and [[Arion Press]]. Also in 2010, an exhibition entitled ''Treasures along the Route of Santiago'' featured photographs and sculptures of critical [[World Monument Fund]] projects across Spain along Camino de Santiago.

Throughout the years, past exhibitions have included ''Madrid Fashion Week'', ''Tile Design in Valencia'', ''From Goya to Sorolla: Queen Sofia Spanish Institute salutes the [[Hispanic Society of America]] on its 100th Anniversary'', ''Children's Drawings of the Spanish Civil War'', an exhibition that marked the 50th anniversary of the Spanish Civil War in Collaboration with the Consulate General of Spain in New York, and many more.

The role of Inmaculada de Habsburg Lorena over the 32 years of her leadership as President and CEO of the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute and the Board of Directors has been formidable.The dedication and cultural awareness that these distinguished individuals provides and many of whom continue to sponsor has made Spain and Latin American culture more of a presence in the United States.

==Cultural events==

In addition to the array of cultural exhibitions that the Queen Sofia Spanish Institute sponsored, and many of these events were held at the institutions building  there were lectures, book presentations, musical recitals, and other events. During the eight year Chairman role led by [[Oscar de la Renta]] , he generously presented  the NY Botanical Gardens summer exhibition entitled ''Spanish Paradise:Gardens of the Alhambra.'' In  2011, [[Claudia Roden]] presented her Spanish food cookbook entitled ''The Food of Spain.'' Following her lecture was a catered reception in collaboration with the Culinary Historians of New York. Other past events have included a concert celebrating the end of Spanish presidency in the European Union, a lecture entitled ''A New Light on Picasso'', a celebration of the Hudson Review's Spanish Issue, and many more.

==Gala Gold Medalists==

Since 1978, Queen Sofía Spanish Institute's Gold Medal has been awarded annually to Americans and Spaniards in recognition of their contributions to the betterment of relations between the United States and Spain.This event brings together an array of international and American leaders and benefactors for a festive night of celebration. The Gala is a major source of funds for the activities of the Institute. Last year's 2010 Gala Gold medalists included [[Diane von Fürstenberg]] and the Spanish National Soccer Team. Other recent medalists include H.E. The Duchess of Alba in 2008, [[Penélope Cruz]] and President [[Bill Clinton]] in 2007, Mayor [[Michael R. Bloomberg]] in 2006, and Dr. [[Henry Kissinger]] in 2005. In 2003, a 15th Anniversary Commemorative Medal was awarded to His Majesty [[King Juan Carlos I]] and Her Majesty [[Queen Sofia of Spain]]. Other well-known past medalists include fashion designer [[Carolina Herrera (fashion designer)|Carolina Herrera]] in 1997 and the Institute's past chairman and fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]] in 1993. The winners of the 2013 Queen Sofia Spanish Institute Gold Medal Awards celebrated at the Waldorf Astoria, in New York City  on November 19, 2013 was Antonio Banderas and Hillary Rodham Clinton.

==Translation Prize==

With the aim of elevating awareness and engendering appreciation of Spanish literature in the United States, this triennial $10,000 prize has been created by the Cultural Committee and Board of Directors of Queen Sofía Spanish Institute to honor the best English-language translation of a work of fiction written in Spanish by a Spanish author a The inaugural award, celebrating the best translation published between 2006 and 2008, was given in 2010 to [[Edith Grossman]] for her 2008 translation of Antonio Muñoz Molina's ''A Manuscript of Ashes''. 

This prize celebrates the work and dedication of the translator and the $10,000. prize is awarded directly to the winner.

The first initiative in place after the Institutes recent changes include the selection of a brilliant reading committee composed of published writers, scholars, translators and academics to select the best translation of a work of fiction written in Spanish, between 2010 and 2017. The panel is now reviewing nominations and nominees will be selected in the first quarter of 2018, and then the committee will read the works in Spanish and English and the winner will be selected in late summer and the award will be presented in the fall of 2018. The Queen Sofia Spanish Institute is honored to have such strong intellectuals leading this important cultural committee.

The Committee members include:

''Christopher Maurer'' is the Chair of this Reading Committee and is the Chair of Romance Studies at Boston University.

''Sue Byrne''   is the Chair of the Department of World Languages and Culture in the University of Nevada, Las Vegas.Prior to joining UNLV, in 2016 she held appointments at Yale University (2008-2016).

}}'''''R v Jones''''', [1986] 2 S.C.R. 284 is an early leading [[Supreme Court of Canada]] decision on the [[freedom of religion]] under [[Section Two of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 2(a)]] of the ''[[Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms]]'' and the right to [[security of person]] under [[Section Seven of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms|section 7]].

==Background==
Thomas Jones was a pastor in a [[Fundamentalist Christianity|fundamentalist]] church who did not want his three children educated in school and instead was teaching them himself in the basement of the church. The [[Alberta]] ''Schools Act'' requires all parents to send their children to school unless the parent can show that they are going to an accredited [[private school]] or the government has approved the [[homeschooling|home-school]] curriculum. Jones was charged with [[truancy]] under the ''Schools Act''.

Jones argued that the rule requiring government approval to educate his children involves "his acknowledging that the government, rather than God, has the final authority over the education of his children"&lt;ref&gt;para. 19&lt;/ref&gt; and so contravenes his right to freedom of religion under section 2(a) and his right to have control over how his children are educated which is protected under section 7.

==Reasons of the court==
Justice [[Gérard La Forest]], for the majority, held that the Act did not violate the Charter. He found that the degree of control that the Act imposed on Jones' children was far from absolute. It was a reasonable requirement and was supported by a compelling interest that it could be justified in a free and democratic society. The certification procedure was in no way manifestly unfair or contravened any principles of [[fundamental justice]] and so did not invoke section 7. While the Supreme Court ruled that although Thomas Jones did have to license the school, the provincial government had to provide [[reasonable accommodation]] for religious belief. The court ruled that the province must "'delicately and sensitively weigh the competing interests so as to respect as much as possible the religious convictions as guaranteed by the Charter,"

'''Richard Stanley Peters''' (31 October 1919 – 30 December 2011) was an English philosopher.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://announcements.thetimes.co.uk/obituaries/timesonline-uk/obituary-preview.aspx?n=richard-stanley-peters&amp;pid=155320736&amp;referrer=2282 |title=Richard Stanley Peters Obituary: View Richard Peters's Obituary by The Times |publisher=Announcements.thetimes.co.uk |date=30 December 2011 |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; His work belongs mainly to the areas of political theory, philosophical [[psychology]], and [[philosophy of education]].

==Biography==
Peters was born in 1919 in [[Mussoorie]], [[British Raj|India]]. He spent his childhood with his grandmother in England. He was a pupil at [[Sidcot School]], [[Winscombe]], [[Somerset]], 1933–1938. As a young man, his private tutor was  Eric Blair (the writer [[George Orwell]]). In the [[Second World War]], as a [[conscientious objector]], he served in the [[Friends Ambulance Unit]] and with Friends Relief Service from 1940 to 1944. From his marriage (1942) there were one son and two daughters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ioe.ac.uk/services/693.html |title=PE – Richard Stanley Peters – Institute of Education, University of London |publisher=Ioe.ac.uk |date=19 January 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==
Peters studied at [[The Queen's College, Oxford]], and received the Bachelor of Arts in 1942. In 1944 he began teaching at Sidcot Grammar School. He became a part-time lecturer at [[Birkbeck College]], [[University of London]], where he also studied philosophy and psychology, receiving his [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in 1949. From then to 1958 he was a full-time lecturer, moving on to be a [[Reader (academic rank)|reader]] in philosophy until 1962. In 1961 he had a one-year guest professorship for education at [[Harvard University]]. In the following year he went to [[Australian National University]]. From 1962 until retirement in 1983 Peters was Professor of the Philosophy of Education at the Institute of Education (founded 1947) [[University of London]]. In 1971 he was Dean of the Institute. Under his guidance the Institute grew fast and considerably influenced the development of the philosophy of education in England. At the Institute Peters collaborated with Paul H. Hirst, who later became Professor of Education at [[King's College, London]], and then professor at [[University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=12449&amp;12449_0=13056 |accessdate=17 May 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927205706/http://ioewebserver.ioe.ac.uk/ioe/cms/get.asp?cid=12449&amp;12449_0=13056 |archivedate=27 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence on the philosophy of education==
Peters is known particularly for his work in the philosophy of education. However, his early writings were occupied with [[psychology]], more exactly with a philosophical view of psychological issues. Thus his research was in the areas motivation, emotions, personality as well as social behaviour and the relationship between reason and longing.&lt;ref&gt;Hirst, P.H.: ''Richard Peters' contribution to the philosophy of education''. In: D.E. Cooper (Ed.): ''Education, values and mind. Essays for R.S. Peters''. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London 1986, pp. 8–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most important work by Peters is ''Ethics and Education''.&lt;ref&gt;R.S. Peters: ''Ethics and Education''. 5th Edition, George Allen &amp; Unwin Ltd., London 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; With this and his subsequent publications he significantly influenced the development of the philosophy of education in Britain and world-wide. The influence was a result of his examination of the concept of education in the sense of analytic philosophy, a central tool being term analysis. Peters explored two substantial aspects of the philosophy of education: the normative and the cognitive.

'''Safe Passage''' or '''Camino Seguro''' is a [[non-profit organization]] that provides school enrollment and after-school support for poor children whose families scavenge the Guatemala City Garbage Dump in [[Guatemala City]]. Safe Passage was founded in 1999 by the late Hanley Denning. The organization assists over 550 children.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safepassage.org Safe Passage] Official website&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Safe Passage was founded in 1999 by the late Hanley Denning, a teacher from [[Maine]] who traveled to Guatemala to learn Spanish. While she was there, the woman with whom she was lodging told her that she wanted her to see the Guatemala City Garbage Dump. After seeing this, Hanley called home and asked her parents to sell her car, computer, and other belongings so that she could start a program to help the people of the dump. With around $5,000, she started a drop-in program in a church outside of the dump. Approximately 40 children showed up in the first week. People gave her a hard time at first, because others had tried to help them but given up. She persevered and about six months later gained people's confidence. Denning was killed on January 18, 2007, aged 36, when a bus with no brakes collided head-on with the car she was riding in. Her driver, a Guatemala native, was also killed. Two volunteers riding in the back seat of the car were injured. She was known by some as "El Angel del Basurero" or "The Angel of the Garbage Dump".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowdoin.edu/news/archives/1bowdoincampus/003849.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt; One of Safe Passage's most recent additions is the Early Childhood Education, program also known as the Escuelita, which hosts children from ages two through six, enhancing their health and school readiness, and ensuring the well-being of these children while their parents work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://safepassage.org/our-stories/programs/educational_reinforcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission==
Safe Passage works to "combat poverty through education". The families of Safe Passage children scavenge through the Guatemala City Dump for items to resell. The organization works to enroll these children in the public schools. The public schools are technically free, but students must provide their own books, supplies, and uniforms, at a cost that is prohibitive for these poor people. The school day in Guatemala runs a half-day, so Safe Passage runs a support program for the other half of the day. Students come to Safe Passage for the half of the day that they are not in school. There they are separated by class level and do activities that reinforce what they are learning school. They receive a snack and lunch. If students miss less than three days of school a month and less than three days at the program, their family receives a food bag, with the equivalent of what money the child would likely have earned if not in school. {{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Fundraising==
Safe Passage relies on child sponsorships to keep the program running, and many fundraisers have been held across the country. In November  2006, a fund raiser "Unmasking the Truth" was held at the [[Children's Museum of Maine]], and an event called "La Fiesta" was held in [[Michigan]].  A school-supply drive in Maine was organized in December 2006. Many high schools have also held fund raisers for Safe Passage. Events include bottle and coin drives, school dances, badminton tournaments, bake sales, and presentations. In 2005, a 5k roadrace was organized in [[Cumberland, Maine]], to benefit Safe Passage. The third annual was held on April 28, 2007. Over $22,000 has already been raised through this race.{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}

==Volunteering==
Many support teams go to Safe Passage during the school breaks.  For example, this year a group of Bowdoin students traveled to Guatemala for their alternative spring break.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowdoin.edu/news/archives/1bowdoincampus/009388.shtml "After a Life-changing Spring Break, Students Share Their Perspectives".]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bowdoin.edu/news/campusnews/ Bowdoin College&amp;mdash;Campus News.] 2012-04-16.  Retrieved 2012-05-28.&lt;/ref&gt; There are also opportunities to travel to Guatemala as a long-term volunteer.  These people stay for a minimum of five weeks, and many of them tend to stay longer.  They can live with a host family, stay in a hostel, or live in their own apartment, in [[Antigua]]. The volunteers are picked up every day by a bus that takes them to Safe Passage in Guatemala City. Long-term volunteers work in the classroom, assisting teachers and students in the classroom. Volunteers also work in the offices located in Yarmouth.
Another way to volunteer is becoming an Ambassador for Safe Passage. Ambassadors raise awareness and money for Safe Passage through different activities. Becoming an Ambassador is a great way to continue your support of Safe Passage after going to Guatemala as a part of a support team.

==Hanley Denning==
Hanley Graham Denning (March 9, 1970 – January 18, 2007) was the founder of Safe Passage. Born in [[Yarmouth, Maine]], Denning graduated from Cumberland Center's Greely High School in 1988 and began attending [[Bowdoin College]] in [[Brunswick, Maine|Brunswick]]. She graduated from Bowdoin in 1992 with a degree in Psychology. After graduating from Bowdoin, she received her master's degree in Education at [[Wheelock College]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://glenarborsun.com/death-of-a-hero-yet-her-vision-lives-on Profile of Hanley Denning]&lt;/ref&gt; After graduating from Wheelock, she began her career as a social worker in [[North Carolina]]. Many of Denning's students were Spanish-speaking, leaving her frustrated because she had difficulty understanding them.

In 1997,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.safepassage.org/history&lt;/ref&gt; with the hopes of being able to improve her Spanish, Denning traveled to Guatemala to volunteer and visited a [[Guatemala City]] garbage dump. At the dump, children were digging through the piles of trash looking for anything they could eat, sell, or use for shelter. None of these kids were going to school because they could not afford the uniforms, supplies, and other miscellaneous costs. Denning sold her car and laptop and used the money to open Safe Passage in a nearby church.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bancroftandcompany.com/weekly-column/hanley-dennings-life-brief-but-very-bright.html Safe Passage opens in a church]&lt;/ref&gt; Eventually, Safe Passage moved to a safer location. In 2007, First Lady [[Laura Bush]] visited Safe Passage and recognized Denning's efforts.

On January 18, 2007, aged 36, Denning was killed in a car accident when the vehicle in which she was riding outside [[Guatemala City]] was hit head-on by a bus with no brakes. Denning received commendations from the United States Senate and Maine State senate for her work with the children and families of the Guatemala City garbage dump.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safepassage.org/history Posthumous commendations for Hanley Denning]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Recycled Life'' documentary film==
The Academy-Award nominated short documentary ''[[Recycled Life]]'' by [[Leslie Iwerks]] and Mike Glad focuses on the lives of those who work in the Guatemala City garbage dump. Denning appeared briefly as herself in the film, and the DVD includes a special video tribute to her. The documentary was shown on [[HBO]] in late 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.recycledlifedoc.com ''Recycled Life'' documentary film]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>The page included uncited claims about students in self-directed education programs. It also stated that there isn't research on outcomes for students in SDE programs, described a narrow definition of SOLE, and implied that play is a distraction rather than a productive part of a child's development (see the work of Peter Gray and David Lancy). I removed the unsubstantiated claims and explained how the definition of SOLEs has expanded. The spelling of "organized" is still mismatched.</comment>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8170">A '''Self Organized Learning Environment''' ('''SOLE''') is a program designed to support self-directed education. [[Sugata Mitra]], an education scientist, first popularized the term in 1999, referencing an approach he developed following his [[Sugata Mitra#Hole in the Wall|Hole in the Wall]] experiments.&lt;ref name="TT SM"&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education.html | title=Sugata Mitra: The child-driven education | website=TEDGlobal 2010 | date=July 2013 | accessdate=December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.ted.com/talks/sugata_mitra_the_child_driven_education/transcript?language=en | title=Sugata Mitra: The child-driven education (transcript) | website=TEDGlobal 2010 | date=July 2013 | accessdate=December 15, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitra's experiments demonstrated that groups of kids could learn to navigate computers and the internet by themselves, and "[r]esearch since then has continued to support his startling conclusion that groups of children, with access to the Internet, can learn almost anything by themselves."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/about/|title=About {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starting in 2014, he's worked with and through the [[School in the Cloud]] project to support the development of SOLEs around the world, adding "Granny" mentors and Big Questions as key components of such programs.

==Initial Experiments &amp; Project SOLE==
One of the things that was learned through the program is that children are often smarter than given credit for. Rather than providing lectures or spoon-feeding information to the students, it is better to ask "engaging, provocative questions" and let them work out the answers. It was also determined to be good to let the students self-direct in the areas that are of interest to them, with the idea that students will then often stretch to comprehend information that might have otherwise been too difficult for them.&lt;ref name="IATEFL" /&gt;

Other findings were that the educational experience is enhanced through collaboration and teamwork, that speech-to-text software is an effective tool for learning to speak a new language, and that tests asking students to solve real-life problems are more effective at prompting students to apply and demonstrate their learning than standard tests.&lt;ref name="IATEFL"&gt;{{cite magazine |url=https://www.academia.edu/7475327/Classrooms_in_the_cloud_or_castles_in_the_air |title=Classrooms in the clouds or castles in the air | magazine=Voices | publisher=International Association of Teachers of English as a Foreign Language (IATEFL)|date=July–August 2014 | number=239 | via=academia.edu |author=Michał Paradowski |pages=8–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first student in India to use the program was Gouri Chindarkar (born about 1996) from Sangli in Maharashtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Sunny-Leone-Neha-Singh-on-BBCs-100-most-influential-women-list/articleshow/55559311.cms|title=Sunny Leone, Neha Singh on BBC’s 100 most influential women list - Times of India|newspaper=The Times of India|access-date=2016-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indianewsbulletin.com/bbc-2016-100-women-list-sunny-leone-mallika-srinivasan-neha-singh-saalumarada-thimmakka-gourichindarkar|title=BBC 100 Women 2016 List: Sunny Leone and 4 Indian women in inspirational and influential list|website=India News Bulletin|access-date=2016-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; She learned about the program through a mentor, an American woman named Ann Thomas, who met with her at 6:30 in the morning. She used a computer for the first time, and her schoolwork delivered in English; her native language is [[Marathi language|Marathi]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37405969|title=100 Women 2016: The girl who learnt in the cloud|date=2016-11-22|newspaper=BBC News|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gouri Chindarkar has since studied Computing Engineering at the [[Kankavli|Kankavali]] campus of [[Mumbai University]] and she was selected as one of the BBC's [[100 Women (BBC)|100 Women in 2016]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Project SOLE was begun in 10 locations in [[Hyderabad]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], with an 11th one in [[Sindhudurg district|Sindhudurg]] rural area of [[Maharashtra]] over a period of 2 years, 2008 to 2009. It is not clear to what extent the learning is effective over the long-term.&lt;ref name="IATEFL" /&gt;

== The School In The Cloud ==
In their own words, "The School in the Cloud platform was originally launched at the 2014 TED conference to help accelerate this research by helping educators — be they teachers, parents or community leaders — to run their own SOLEs and to contribute to the global experiment by sharing their experiences with others. It is now managed by SOLE Central at Newcastle University, a global hub for SOLE research and practice directed by Sugata Mitra."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/about/|title=About {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are currently experimenting to refine and increase access to education programs that blend the SOLE approach of encouraging student groups to self-direct online learning with lessons from the [[Philosophy for Children|Philosophy For Children]] (P4C) project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theschoolinthecloud.org/blogpost/3430/|title=A philosophical approach to SOLE {{!}} School in the Cloud|website=www.theschoolinthecloud.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptation Within Institutionalized Education==
Though Mitra's initial experiments focused on children living in unstable environments and in poverty, his findings inspired educators in a wide variety of environments to adapt his work. Teachers in both traditional and progressive environments have found ways to incorporate the SOLE approach in their work, whether for the span of a lesson or a semester. One prominent education blog suggests, "Consider it a tool for introducing and generating interest in a new topic, as well as broadening your students’ understanding of a familiar topic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.edutopia.org/blog/getting-started-self-organized-learning-environments-jacquelyn-omalley|title=Getting Started With Self-Organized Learning Environments {{!}} Edutopia|work=Edutopia|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the SOLE is just one element in a larger inquiry or project-based learning cycle.

==Adaptation Beyond Institutionalized Education==
For some, the initial SOLE projects showed the immense potential for learning in settings where students leverage technology and social learning to explore their interests with minimal interference. The US nonprofit Black Mountain SOLE opened a community center "inspired by the idea that human curiosity is the best motivation for learning" and identifying as an adaptation from earlier SOLE projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://blackmountainsole.org/about-us/|title=About Us - Blackmountainsole|work=Blackmountainsole|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Agile Learning Centers]] and a number of the projects that are part of the Alliance for Self-Directed Education also consider themselves to either be or be inspired by SOLEs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://self-directed.org/|title=Alliance for Self-Directed Education {{!}} Home Page|work=Alliance for Self-Directed Education|access-date=2018-10-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Components ==
Unizin is a cloud-scale service operator and integrator focused on improving learner experiences with digital teaching and learning resources.  It provides services to support the Digital Education offerings of its members and subscribers including services for Content, Learning Environments, and Analytics.&lt;ref name="unizin.org"/&gt;

=== Content ===
According to Unizin.org, member instructors “will be able to share their own teaching content, and gain access to a repository of shared digital content from campus colleagues and others at member institutions." In July 2015, Unizin acquired the software and trademark for [[Courseload]], an eText reader and collaborative tool. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unizin.org/2015/07/unizin-acquires-courseload-software/|title=Unizin Acquires Courseload Software - Unizin|website=Unizin.org|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unizin's former COO, Robin Littleworth said in a blog post that Courseload will form the foundation for Unizin's Content Relay. "The Content Relay is aimed at making two problems easier to address," said Littleworth. "Creating and supporting simple and sustainable workflows around 1) the deposit and distribution of faculty/institutionally generated content; and 2) the discovery of content that can be used in classes, labs, and experiential learning settings (e.g., repositories, OER, institutionally licensed content, publisher paid content, etc.)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://unizin.org/2015/07/courseload-and-content-relay-unizins-next-steps/]  {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906082042/http://unizin.org/2015/07/courseload-and-content-relay-unizins-next-steps/ |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unizin also makes content discoverable and portable, providing higher education institutions with an exit strategy should they choose to switch service providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.wisc.edu/1962.aspx|title=Office of the CIO - UW-Madison Information Technology|website=Cio.wisc.edu|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Platform ===
Unizin announced that [[Instructure#Canvas|Canvas]] by [[Instructure]] would serve as the [[learning management system]] (LMS) for its members, though members could continue to run other LMSs in parallel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2014/06/12/unizin-common-infrastructure-means-commercial-software#sthash.hZMKxZ9o.dpbs|title=For Unizin, common infrastructure means commercial software|website=Insidehighered.com|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Members chose Canvas in part because it meets IMS Global open standards; also much of the LMS is open source software.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;  The Unizin consortium has not announced details of additional platforms that may be part of the Unizin service.

=== Analytics ===
The Unizin Data Platform (UDP) offers data products and services for learning analytics, application development, research, and business intelligence. By operating on common platforms, Unizin members can leverage analytics of learner outcomes both within and across institutions, as well as save time and effort with data management tasks.  Unizin further states that analytics will not only help improve learning, but also be available for research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unizin.org|title=Unizin|website=Unizin|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UDP collects and standardizes data from a variety of sources using the Unizin Common Data Model (UCDM) and gives researchers and analysts access to data marts, real-time event processing, and APIs. The UCDM is the standard for representing data from across the teaching and learning ecosystem and normalizes data from across a range of systems and tools. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unizin.org/solutions/data/data-management/udp/|title=Unizin Data Platform - Unizin|website=Unizin.org|accessdate=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==

}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are no predefined victory or failure conditions, and the game does not end. Players define their own end goals for the game, and try achieve them using strategy and tactics. Typically, the main goal is to build a successful business amidst competition.

''Virtonomics'' is a multiplayer game, and players mainly interact with other players as well as with a computer-controlled opponent. It is turn-based game, and each turn lasts a fixed length of time. Generally, turns are a day long, and for a regular player, the game required 15 to 60 minutes a day. In 2014, the developers released a "fast realm", a [[game server]] where turns were an hour long; this was designed for players in short-term business training.

Currently Virtonomics has six realms: Vera, Olga, Mary, Lien, Fast and Anna.

In the game, players may engage in agriculture, exploitation of natural resources, manufacturing, retail, [[foreign exchange market]] trade, finance, personnel management, marketing, logistics, scientific research and other business processes.&lt;ref name="Bellotti2014"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Serious games and the development of an entrepreneurial mindset in higher education engineering students|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1875952114000214|first1=F|last1=Bellotti|first2=R|last2=Berta|first3=A|last3=De Gloria|first4=E|last4=Lavagnino|first5=A|last5=Antonaci|first6=F|last6=Dagnino|first7=M|last7=Ott|first8=M|last8=Romero|first9=M|last9=Usart|first10=I.S.|last10=Mayer|date=2014|volume=5|issue=4|journal=[[Entertainment Computing]]|doi=10.1016/j.entcom.2014.07.003|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|accessdate=2014-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
''Virtonomics'' is developed by GamerFlot Trading Ltd. A prototype of ''Virtonomics'' called ''Money Mania'' was released in 2004, and it ran as a non-commercial project for a few years. On 11 December 2006, ''Money Mania'' was renamed ''Virtonomics'', and released in the Russian language. The game was named by ''[[Game World Navigator]]'' as the best economic online game of 2007.&lt;ref name="InternetRU2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internet.ru/news/2008-01-18223|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008150820/http://www.internet.ru/news/2008-01-18223|date=2008-01-29|archivedate=2009-10-08|script-title=ru:Экономическая онлайн-игра "Виртономика" названа лучшей игрой 2007 года|trans-title=Economic online game "Virtonomica" named best game of 2007|publisher=[[Mail.Ru]]|language=Russian|accessdate=2010-03-07|title=Archived copy|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BusinessPress2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_21961_aId_441881.html |script-title=ru:"ВИРТОНОМИКА" – ЛУЧШАЯ БРАУЗЕРНАЯ ИГРА!|trans-title="Virtonomics" - the best browser game!|publisher=[[Alliance Media National Business Partnership]]|language=Russian|work=[[Business Press (Alliance Media)]]|date= |accessdate=2010-03-07|archivedate=2014-07-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140718202507/http://businesspress.ru/newspaper/article_mId_21961_aId_441881.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Chinarova2006"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Catherine|last=Chinarova|page=91|title=Бизнесмен играющий|trans-title=Business Gaming|date=2006|volume=36|issue=24|accessdate=2016-01-05|url=http://b-mag.ru/PDFs/Regions/2006/2006_12_SAMARA_24.pdf|deadurl=no|archivedate=2016-01-02|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102221534/http://b-mag.ru/PDFs/Regions/2006/2006_12_SAMARA_24.pdf|language=Russian|work=[[Бизнес-журнал]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game entered the global market in 2009 with a [[freemium]] model, and was translated to several other languages.
