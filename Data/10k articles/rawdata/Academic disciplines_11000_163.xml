      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2612">'''Alternative technology''' is a term used to refer to technologies that are more [[environmentally friendly]] than the functionally equivalent technologies dominant in current practice.

The term was coined by [[Peter Harper (alternative technologist)|Peter Harper]], one of the founders of the [[Centre for Alternative Technology]], [[North Wales]] (a.k.a. ''The Quarry''), in [[Undercurrents (magazine)]] in the 1970s.

Some "alternative technologies" have in the past or may in the future become widely adopted, after which they might no longer be considered "alternative."  For example, the use of wind turbines to produce electricity.

==Alternative technologies==
Alternative technologies include the following:
* [[Anaerobic digestion]]
* [[Composting]]
* [[Fuel cell]]s 
* Fuels for automobiles (besides [[gasoline]] and [[Diesel fuel|diesel]])
** [[Alcohol fuel|Alcohol]] (either [[ethanol]] or [[methanol]])
** [[Biodiesel]]
** [[Vegetable oil]]
** [[Biomass to liquid]]
* [[Greywater]]
* [[Photovoltaic module|Solar panel]]s
** Silicon-based
** [[Photosynthetic]] "[[Gratzel cell]]s" ([[Titanium dioxide]])
* [[Landfill gas]] extraction from landfills
* [[Mechanical biological treatment]]
* [[Recycling]]
* [[Wind generator]]s

'''Ana Vásquez-Bronfman''' (18 December 1931 – 18 November 2009) was a [[List of Chilean Jews|Chilean Jewish]] sociologist and writer. Exiled from the country during the dictatorship in 1973, she relocated to Paris, where she worked as a professor and researcher at the [[National Center for Scientific Research]]. Much of her literary work centered on the cultural heritage of Jews in predominantly Catholic [[Latin America]], the effects of military dictatorship on human rights and racial prejudices and exile. Her research evaluated the psycho-sociology of children and women's sexuality. She won a National Book prize in Chile for her fiction and a bronze medal from the French National Center for Scientific Research for her scholarship.

==Early life==
Ana Luisa Bronfman Weinstein was born on 18 December,{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} 1931 in [[Santiago]], Chile to Ida Weinstein Rudoy and Samuel Bronfman.&lt;!-- There is a source, but we need a better one. [https://www.geni.com/people/Ida-Weinstein-Rudoy/4674370165040071872] --&gt; Her mother's family were immigrants from Ukraine{{sfn|''The New Economy''|2012}} and her father's family were immigrants from the [[Russian Empire]]. Nicha, as she was called by acquaintances,{{sfn|Olivares Palma|2010}} was influenced and shaped by being the child of [[History of the Jews in Chile|Jewish immigrants]] in the predominantly Catholic country.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} Studying psychology with a minor in French, Bronfman graduated from the [[University of Chile]].{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} She married Oscar Vásquez Pedemonte and the couple had seven children.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}

==Career==
From 1967 to 1973, Vásquez-Bronfman taught at the University of Chile, as a professor in the School of Sociology.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}}{{sfn|Martin|1994|p=423}} When the [[1973 Chilean coup d'état]] occurred, she went into exile, fleeing to France in 1974.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} She wrote six novels, as well as several short stories, focusing her studies on exile. Working as a therapist with [[political prisoner]]s and victims of torture, her works explored the effects of politics on human rights.{{sfn|Howe|2011|pp=41–42}} She studied at the [[Paris-Sorbonne University|Sorbonne]], earning her PhD in psychology and upon her graduation became a researcher at the French [[National Center for Scientific Research]] from 1984 through 1998.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}}{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}}

Vásquez-Bronfman' first novels, ''Les bisons, les bonzes et le dépotoir'' (''The Bison, the Leaders, and the Rubbish'', 1977, translated into Spanish as ''Los búfalos, los jerarcas y la huesera'', 1987),{{sfn|Julien|1978}}{{sfn|Martin|1994|p=425}} ''Abel Rodríguez y sus hermanos'' (''Abel Rodríguez and his Brothers'', 1981), and ''Sebasto's Angels'' (co-written with her son Cacho Vásquez, 1985) each explored a military dictatorship through fiction.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}{{sfn|Howe|2011|p=42}} ''Les bisons, les bonzes et le dépotoir'' tells the tale of one hundred leftist refugees who had taken refuge in the French Embassy in Santiago. Ideologically linked, but differing in almost every other aspect, the book explored the limits on communication. It was selected as a book of the month by ''[[Le Monde diplomatique]]'' in 1978.{{sfn|Julien|1978}} ''Abel Rodríguez y sus hermanos'' deals with the fracturing of the family, and thus the nation, dividing Chilean society as brothers take opposing sides in the political climate.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1278}}{{sfn|Howe|2011|pp=42–44}} The novel explores both psychological and physical torture, [[forced disappearance]], and government cover-ups.{{sfn|Howe|2011|pp=58–59}}

''Sebasto's Angels'' evaluates the impact of living in dual cultural realities for second-generation immigrants with the added dimension of being exiles. The book was Vásquez-Bronfman's first novel in which the setting moved from Chile to France and her son, Óscar, known as "Cacho", who was a guitarist and singer of a [[Latin rock]] band, lends the story a more youthful focus. Vásquez deals with the pain and guilt of exile, while her son focuses on his anger, rejection politics, and his desire to live in the present moment.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}}{{sfn|Pélage|2012|pp=96–97}} It explores the stages of exile, isolation, indifference, and ultimately a loss of identification with one's place of origin, recognizing that one cannot live based on the hypothetical idea that at a future point you may be able to return.{{sfn|Pélage|2012|pp=98–99}} In her book ''Mi amiga Chantal'' (''My Friend Chantal'', 1991), Vásquez-Bronfman explores being a double exile in a fictional-autobiographical exploration of community and personal development.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1278}}{{sfn|Pélage|2012|p=100}}{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}

Vásquez-Bronfman's 1999 short story ''The Sign of the Star'', retold the story of a seven-year-old child bullied by his classmates for being Jewish. She tied themes of the [[Holocaust]], such as [[Jewish quarter (diaspora)|ghettoization]] and cremation, to the isolation the child feels when his classmates forbade others to talk with him. Drawing on her own history of being a Jew in a Catholic country, she evaluated [[Antisemitism]] from both a cultural and racial perspective.{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} That same year, her ''Los mundos de Circe'' (''The World of Circe'', 1999) was awarded the Chilean National Book and Reading Council prize for best narrative.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|1999}}{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}} The work explored shifting relationships of couples, which arise over the course of a partnership, dealing with trust given partially or fully, beauty and ugliness, and the risks that are inherent in love.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}}

Vásquez-Bronfman returned to the theme of her Jewishness in ''Las jaulas invisible'' (''The Invisible Cages'', 2002), evaluating women, their sexuality, and migration on the road to becoming [[mestizo]]. Set in the first half of the twentieth century, the novel tells the tale of modern daughters descended of immigrants to Chile and indigenous migrants who have moved from the countryside to the city and explores how all of them are marginalized and reshaped by their experiences.{{sfn|Cánovas Emhart|Scherman Filer|2007}}{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}} She took these themes further in a collaborative anthology, ''Crímenes de mujeres'' (''Crimes of Women'', 2004), which she edited, along with Virginia Vidal. The title referred to both crimes committed and suffered by women and evaluated the complexity of victimization, perpetration, and institutionalized power.{{sfn|Promis|2005}}

Her academic works focused on child psychology and she often evaluated the [[psychosocial]] development of children through organizations and public institutions,{{sfn|Maiz-Peña|2003|p=1276}} publishing several books on the topic.{{sfn|Scemama|2017}} After her retirement from the National Center for Scientific Research in 1998, she received the center's bronze medal for research and was awarded an [[Honorary Degree]] for her research on women's sexuality.{{sfn|Des Femmes|2017}}{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}} This last work ''Amor y sexualidad en las personas mayores: Trasgresiones y secretos'' (Love and Sexuality in the Elderly: Transgressions and Secrets, 2006) contrasted and compared the sexual experiences of twenty individuals as they aged. Subjects were from France and Spain and were an equal representation of male and female subjects. Divided into three sections, the first part of the study dealt with the socialization practices associated with sex—fears, initiation rituals, taboos—and the differences between men and women's sexuality. The second section evaluated sexuality as practiced in adulthood and the final portion analyzed the differences the group experienced in their sexuality as they aged. The research shows how childhood influences continue to be manifested in aging populations.{{sfn|Vidal Martí|2007|pp=131–132}}

==Death and legacy==
Vásquez-Bronfman died on 18 November 2009 in [[Paris]], France.{{sfn|''El Mercurio''|2009}} In February 2010, colleagues and friends gathered to celebrate her memory.{{sfn|Olivares Palma|2010}} Her works have been translated into Dutch, French and German.{{sfn|Editorial Gedisa|2006}} In 2017, a literary prize for young women, known as the Ana Vasquez-Bronfman Prize, was launched to assist young writers in publishing their works.{{sfn|Scemama|2017}}

[[File:Mensural notation Hail Mary 1.png|thumb|alt=Mensural Notation|An example of mensural notation]]

'''''Ars cantus mensurabilis''''' (Latin for ''the art of the measurable song'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academic.cengage.com/music/book_content/049557273X_wrightSimms_DEMO/assets/ITOW/7273X_10a_ITOW_Franco.pdf|title=Info|website=academic.cengage.com|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a music theory treatise from the mid-13th century, c. 1250&amp;ndash;1280 (Medieval Period) written by German music theorist [[Franco of Cologne]] &lt;ref&gt;Grout, Donald. J et. al ''A History of Western Music (8th edition)'' p. 105/106 (New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The treatise was written shortly after ''[[De Mensurabili Musica]]'', a treatise by [[Johannes de Garlandia (music theorist)|Johannes de Garlandia]], which summarised a set of 6 [[rhythmic mode]]s in use at the time.&lt;ref&gt;^ Christensen, Thomas. ''The Cambridge History of Western Music Theory'', (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 2002), p. 628&lt;/ref&gt; In music written in rhythmic modes, the duration of a note could be determined only in context. ''Ars cantus mensurabilis'' was the first treatise to suggest that individual notes could have their own durations independent of context. This new rhythmic system was the foundation for [[mensural notation]] system and the [[ars nova]] style.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2465">'''Automotive Skills Limited''' is an English [[registered charity]] and one of 25 [[Sector Skills Councils]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20021201141235/http://sscalliance.org/] (SSC), responsible for the retail motor industry, awarded a licensed by the then secretary of state at the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]], the Rt Hon [[Charles Clarke]] MP, in February 2004 [https://web.archive.org/web/20070204154022/http://www.automotiveskills.org.uk/auto/docs/Licence%20Release.pdf].

==History==
The SSC suffered a fraud at the hands of its finance manager, which was discovered in 2006 [http://www.lynnnews.co.uk/news?articleid=2939241]. Subsequently, Automotive Skills' SSC license was transferred to the Institute of the Motor Industry in September 2007 [https://web.archive.org/web/20071008141043/http://www.motor.org.uk/news/articles/imi-will-focus-on-five-big-wins-as-the-new-sector-skills-council-331.html][https://web.archive.org/web/20071114073914/http://www.motortrader.com/25831/IMI-named-as-government-sector.ehtml].  The Institute uses the Automotive Skills brand, although the separate charity still exists [http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/showcharity.asp?remchar=&amp;chyno=1015461].

The SSC had a contract with the Sector Skills Development Agency (SSDA)[http://www.ssda.org.uk/], which was replaced by the [[UK Commission for Employment and Skills]] (UKCES)[http://www.ukces.org.uk/] on 1 April 2008.  One role of the UKCES will be to manage the performance of the [[Sector Skills Councils]], advising Ministers on their re-licensing [https://web.archive.org/web/20080531122927/http://www.ukces.org.uk/default.aspx?page=1].

The members of Automotive Skills Limited appointed liquidators PJ Clark and PD Williams of corporate restructuring organisation MCR [http://www.mcr.uk.com/], on 24 July 2008 [http://www.gazettes-online.co.uk/issues/58787/pages/11884].

==Structure==
It was headquartered in [[Brickendon]] in [[Hertfordshire]].

'''Brewer–Dobson circulation''' is a [[Model (abstract)|model]] of atmospheric circulation, proposed by [[Alan West Brewer|Alan Brewer]] in 1949 and [[Gordon Dobson]] in 1956, which attempts to explain why tropical air has less [[ozone]] than polar air, even though the tropical [[stratosphere]] is where most atmospheric ozone is produced. It is a simple circulation model that posits the existence of a slow [[Air current|current]] in the winter [[Sphere|hemisphere]] which redistributes air from the tropics to the extratropics.

== Description ==

=== Discovery ===

CRISPR/Cpf1 was found by searching a published database of bacterial genetic sequences for promising bits of DNA. Its identification through [[bioinformatics]] as a CRISPR system protein, its naming, and a [[hidden Markov model]] (HMM) for its detection were provided in 2012 in a release of the [[TIGRFAMs]] database of [[protein families]]. Cpf1 appears in many bacterial species. The ultimate Cpf1 endonuclease that was developed into a tool for genome editing was taken from one of the first 16 species known to harbor it.&lt;ref name=nat&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Alternative CRISPR system could improve genome editing|url = http://www.nature.com/doifinder/10.1038/nature.2015.18432|journal = Nature|pages = 17-17|volume = 526|issue = 7571|doi = 10.1038/nature.2015.18432|first = Heidi|last = Ledford|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two candidate enzymes from ''[[Acidaminococcus]]'' and ''Lachnospiraceae'' display efficient genome-editing activity in human cells.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A smaller version of Cas9 from the bacterium ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' is a potential alternative to Cpf1.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt;

=== Classification ===

CRISPR-Cas systems are separated into two classes. Class 1 uses several Cas proteins together with the CRISPR RNAs (crRNA) to build a functional endonuclease. Class 2 CRISPR systems use a single Cas protein with a crRNA. Cpf1 has been recently identified as a Class II, Type V CRISPR/Cas systems containing a 1,300 amino acid protein.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Makarova, Kira S., et al. "An updated evolutionary classification of CRISPR-Cas systems." Nature Reviews Microbiology (2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Structure ==

The Cpf1 locus contains a mixed alpha/beta domain, a RuvC-I followed by a helical region, a RuvC-II and a [[zinc finger]]-like domain.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gootenberg|first2=Jonathan S.|last3=Abudayyeh|first3=Omar O.|last4=Slaymaker|first4=Ian M.|last5=Makarova|first5=Kira S.|last6=Essletzbichler|first6=Patrick|last7=Volz|first7=Sara E.|last8=Joung|first8=Julia|last9=van der Oost|first9=John|date=October 2015|title=Cpf1 Is a Single RNA-Guided Endonuclease of a Class 2 CRISPR-Cas System|journal=Cell|volume=163|issue=3|pages=759–771|doi=10.1016/j.cell.2015.09.038|last1=Zetsche|first1=Bernd|last10=Regev|first10=Aviv|last11=Koonin|first11=Eugene V.|last12=Zhang|first12=Feng|pmid=26422227|pmc=4638220}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Cpf1 protein has a [[Crossover junction endodeoxyribonuclease|RuvC]]-like endonuclease domain that is similar to the RuvC domain of Cas9. Furthermore, Cpf1 does not have a HNH endonuclease domain, and the N-terminal of Cpf1 does not have the alpha-helical recognition lobe of Cas9.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Cpf1 CRISPR-Cas domain architecture shows that Cpf1 is functionally unique, being classified as Class 2, type V CRISPR system. The Cpf1 loci encode [[Cas1]], Cas2 and Cas4 proteins more similar to types I and III than from type II systems. Database searches suggest the abundance of Cpf1-family proteins in many bacterial species.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Functional Cpf1 doesn’t need the [[Trans-activating crRNA|tracrRNA]], therefore, only crRNA is required. This benefits genome editing because Cpf1 is not only smaller than Cas9, but also it has a smaller [[Subgenomic mRNA|sgRNA]] molecule (proximately half as many [[nucleotide]]s as Cas9).&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://epigenie.com/cpf1-takes-crispr-bigger-by-going-smaller/|title=Cpf1 Moves in on Cas9 for Next-Gen CRISPR Genome Editing|website=epigenie.com|access-date=2016-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After identification of PAM, Cpf1 introduces a sticky-end-like DNA double- stranded break of 4 or 5 nucleotides overhang.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Mechanism ==

The CRISPR/Cpf1 system consist of a Cpf1 enzyme and a guide RNA that finds and positions the complex at the correct spot on the double helix to cleave target DNA. CRISPR/Cpf1 systems activity has three stages:&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt; 
* Adaptation: Cas1 and Cas2 proteins facilitate the adaptation of small fragments of DNA into the CRISPR array. . 
* Formation of crRNAs: processing of pre-cr-RNAs producing of mature crRNAs to guide the Cas protein.
* Interference: the Cpf1 is bound to a crRNA to form a binary complex to identify and cleave a target DNA sequence.

=== Cas9 vs. Cpf1===

Cas9 requires two [[RNA]] molecules to cut DNA while Cpf1 needs one. The proteins also cut DNA at different places, offering researchers more options when selecting an editing site. Cas9 cuts both strands in a DNA molecule at the same position, leaving behind [[Sticky and blunt ends#Blunt ends|blunt ends]]. Cpf1 leaves one strand longer than the other, creating [[Sticky and blunt ends#Overhangs and sticky ends|sticky ends]]. The sticky ends aid in the incorporation of new sequences of DNA, making Cpf1 more efficient at gene introductions than Cas9.&lt;ref name="nat" /&gt; Although the CRISPR/Cas9 system can efficiently disable genes, it is challenging to insert genes or generate a knock-in.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Cpf1 lacks [[tracrRNA]], utilizes a T-rich PAM and cleaves DNA via a staggered DNA DSB.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In summary, important differences between Cpf1 and Cas9 systems are that Cpf1:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yamano | first1 = T. | last2 = Nishimasu | first2 = H. | last3 = Zetsche | first3 = B. | last4 = Hirano | first4 = H. | last5 = Slaymaker | first5 = I.

* Recognizes different PAMs, enabling new targeting possibilities.
* Creates 4-5 nt long sticky ends, instead of blunt ends produced by Cas9, enhancing the efficiency of genetic insertions and specificity during [[Non-homologous end joining|NHEJ]] or HDR.
* Cuts target DNA further away from PAM, further away from the Cas9 cutting site, enabling new possibilities for cleaving the DNA.

Multiple aspects influence target efficiency and specificity when using CRISPR, including guide RNA design. Many design models for guide RNA have been suggested, with tools to facilitate optimized design. These include SgRNA designer, CRISPR MultiTargeter, SSFinder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graham|first=Daniel B.|last2=Root|first2=David E.|date=2015-01-01|title=Resources for the design of CRISPR gene editing experiments|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/s13059-015-0823-x|journal=Genome Biology|volume=16|pages=260|doi=10.1186/s13059-015-0823-x|issn=1474-760X|pmc=4661947|pmid=26612492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Camelford water pollution incident''' involved the accidental contamination of the drinking water supply to the town of [[Camelford]], [[Cornwall]], in July 1988. Twenty [[tonne]]s of [[aluminium sulphate]] was inadvertently added to the water supply, raising the concentration to 3,000 times the admissible level. As the aluminium sulphate broke down it produced several tonnes of [[sulphuric acid]] which "stripped a cocktail of chemicals from the pipe networks as well as lead and copper piping in people’s homes."&lt;ref name="cross"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Boiling water: Will a new inquiry on the Camelford poisoning get any nearer to the truth?|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=22 August 2001|first=Doug|last=Cross|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irwin"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.irwinmitchell.com/ClientStories/Pages/Camelford-Water-Pollution-Case.aspx|title=Camelford Water Pollution Case|work=IrwinMitchell LLP|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many people who came into contact with the contaminated water experienced a range of short-term health effects,&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Still thirsting for justice|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/1999/jun/09/guardiansocietysupplement14|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=9 June 1999|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many victims suffered long-term effects whose implications remained unclear {{As of|2012|lc=on}}. There has been no rigorous examination or monitoring of the health of the victims since the incident, which is Britain's worst mass poisoning event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisissomerset.co.uk/real-possibility-Camelford-mass-water-poisoning/story-15517393-detail/story.html|title='Very real possibility' that Camelford mass water poisoning contributed to Somerset woman's death &amp;#124; This is Somerset|work=thisissomerset.co.uk|date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="times200406"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/health/article707311.ece|title=Alzheimer's linked to aluminium pollution in tap water|last1=Hawkes|first1=Nigel|work=[[The Times]]|date=20 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Inquests on people who died many years later found very high levels of aluminium in the brain. [[Barbara Clayton|Dame Barbara Clayton]] led a [[Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution]] enquiry into the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Professor Dame Barbara Clayton Honorary Fellow|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2011.01903.x/abstract|journal = Nutrition Bulletin|date = 2011-06-01|issn = 1467-3010|pages = 283–283|volume = 36|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1467-3010.2011.01903.x|language = en|first = Alan|last = Malcolm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after the contamination the authorities said that the water was safe to drink, possibly with juice to cover the unpleasant taste. In an inquest in 2012 into the death of one of the victims, the [[coroner]] stated that [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable.&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"/&gt; In the aftermath of the contamination the public were reassured that there was no risk to health. There were allegations of a [[cover-up]] and West Somerset Coroner Michael Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=The West Briton|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following an investigation by the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment, [[Michael Meacher]], the former Environment Minister, claimed that "various associated bodies tried to bury the inquiry from the start." Meacher told one newspaper: "This has become a tug of war between the truth and an attempt to silence the truth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford: The truth will out|work=[[The Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=26 January 2007|page=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Ministers accused of Camelford cover-up|first=Ben|last=Russell|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=17 August 2001|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An April 2013 report by the Lowermoor subgroup of the Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment concluded that exposure to the chemicals was unlikely to cause "delayed or persistent harm" and was also unlikely to cause future ill health.&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"&gt;https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-england-cornwall-22200035&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"&gt;http://cot.food.gov.uk/pdfs/lwpiapp811.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2013 the government admitted that there had been a "manifest failure to give prompt appropriate advice and information to affected consumers" and offered an unreserved apology.&lt;ref name="BBC-24164253"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Camelford water poisoning: Unreserved government apology | work = [[BBC News]] | date = 19 September 2013 | accessdate = 8 May 2016 | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-24164253 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
On 6 July 1988, John Stephens, a relief tanker driver working for ISC Chemicals, a [[Bristol]]-based subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto Zinc]], arrived at [[Lowermoor Water Treatment Works]] on [[Bodmin Moor]] and found it unmanned.&lt;ref name="wells2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver relives day of water poisoning|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=2 November 2010|first=Jeff|last=Wells|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being unfamiliar with the location, he had been given a key by another driver and told simply that "once inside the gate, the aluminium sulphate tank is on the left". However, the key fitted almost every lock used by the [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] (SWWA). After twenty minutes looking for the correct tank he tried the key on a manhole cover and when it unlocked believed he had accessed the correct tank.&lt;ref name=wells2010/&gt; He poured the load of 20 tonnes of [[aluminium sulphate]], used to remove solid particles from raw water, into the tank, which actually held treated water prior to distribution to the consumers in Camelford. This immediately contaminated the water supply to 20,000 local people and up to 10,000 tourists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/127270.stm|title=Public inquiry calls mark Camelford anniversary|work=[[BBC News]]|date=6 July 1998|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="indyscandal"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Lean|first1=Geoffrey|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/poisoned-the-camelford-scandal-474373.html|title=Poisoned: The Camelford scandal|work=[[The Independent]]|date=16 April 2006|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum recorded aluminium concentration was 620 milligrams per litre compared with the maximum concentration admissible at the time by the European Community of 0.2 milligrams per litre.&lt;ref name="rowland"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Rowland|first1=A|last2=Grainger|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=RS|last4=Hicks|first4=N|last5=Hughes|first5=A|title=Water contamination in north Cornwall: a retrospective cohort study into the acute and short-term effects of the aluminium sulphate incident in July 1988|year=1990|journal=Journal of the Royal Society of Health|issue=110|pages=166–172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
For several days the water authority insisted the water was safe, and should be mixed with orange juice to disguise the taste of the as yet unknown contaminant. One customer who telephoned the authority the day after the contamination was told "there had been some acidity, but the water was perfectly safe to drink," and was no more harmful than lemon juice.&lt;ref name="boggan"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Day that left a bitter taste in the mouth|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|first=Steve|last=Boggan|pages=7|date=24 September 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 July 1988 the authority sent a circular letter to all customers "asserting that the water from the treatment works was of the right [[alkalinity]] and was safe to use and drink."&lt;ref name="timeslaw"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Exemplary damages in public nuisance (AB v South West Water Services Ltd [1993] QB 507)|work=The Times|location=London|date=8 May 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within two days, the authority suspected the source of the contamination was the erroneous delivery, which was confirmed on 12 July when the driver was asked to return to the treatment works. However, it was not until ten days later on 22 July that the authority's chairman Keith Court authorised a public notice, containing the first mention of the aluminium sulphate, to be published in the sports section of a local newspaper, the ''[[Western Morning News]]''.&lt;ref name="greenwood2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water bosses too slow to go public over poisoning|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=9 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stephens stated that after the site meeting where he confirmed he had delivered the chemical to the wrong tank he was told by the authority "not to mention it to anyone else".&lt;ref name="cornish"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Driver was told to "tell no one" about poisoning|work=[[Cornish Guardian]]|location=Truro|date=3 November 2010|page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWWA district manager, John Lewis, said they had realised within 48 hours that aluminium sulphate was the likely cause of the contamination, but Lewis said he had been instructed by Leslie Nicks, the head of operations, not to tell the public.&lt;ref name="telegraph2010"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Staff 'silenced' over poisoned water|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=3 November 2010|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="express"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water company's staff 'told to keep poisoning quiet'|work=[[Express and Echo]]|location=Exeter|date=3 November 2010|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Douglas Cross, a [[biologist|consultant biologist]] based in Camelford, tested the water and found that it contained "not only aluminium sulphate but other noxious substances, too. As the acidic liquid travelled from the plant into people's homes, it corroded the copper pipes and their soldered joints, made of zinc and lead."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt; Official advice to boil the water before drinking was, according to Cross, "dangerous advice because it concentrates the contaminants. They kept flushing the pipes out for months after the incident. This will have stirred up debris in the bends and only have lengthened the amount of time the water was coming through the taps with all sorts of metals in it."
60,000 [[salmon]] and [[trout]] were killed in the [[River Camel|Camel]] and [[River Allen, Cornwall|Allen]] rivers during the flushing out process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|location=London|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=978-0-415-21771-2|title=The Environment: Principles and Applications|first=Chris|last=Park|pages=408}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jury"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Claimants consider 11th-hour pollution compensation offer|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=6 May 1994|first=Louise|last=Jury}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contamination was compounded by the failure of the authority to carry out the required six-monthly cleaning of the tank, which had not been cleaned for three years leading to a build up of sludge.&lt;ref name="gerrard"&gt;{{Cite news|title=What's happened to the children?|work=[[The Observer]]|location=London|date =14 July 1996|first=Nicci|last=Gerrard|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the contamination, Michael Waring at the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] (DH) wrote to every doctor in Cornwall saying that, "although he had no detailed information on what was exactly in the water or how much people might have drunk, he could assure them that no lasting ill effects would result."&lt;ref name="meacher"&gt;{{Cite news|title=A wash out: Lessons must be learned from the notorious Camelford water contamination incident|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=26 April 2006|first=Michael|last=Meacher|pages=8|authorlink=Michael Meacher}}&lt;/ref&gt; GK Matthews, a senior toxicologist at the DH, suggested a team of medical experts should be sent to the area immediately but a month later said he had been "overruled".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt; The [[National Union of Public Employees]] said that the procedure by which the driver had access to the site was common through the region and that they believed this was connected with reduced staffing levels and [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|privatisation plans]]. They added that they were concerned about the three-week delay in reporting what had happened, and that SWWA district manager John Lewis had been "instructed at a very high level to say nothing". Lewis (not a member of the union) had been dismissed; the union said "To single him out is unfair".&lt;ref name=dennis /&gt;

==Reports and inquiries==
In August 1988 a highly critical report by Dr John Lawrence, a senior [[Imperial Chemical Industries|ICI]] scientist and non-executive member of the water authority, blamed lax procedures. He also criticised communication failures which kept information from the public.&lt;ref name="dennis" /&gt;

===Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report===
The Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group (LIHAG) was set up in January 1989 to provide expert advice to the [[District Health Authority#Authorities in South Western Region|Cornwall and Isles of Scilly District Health Authority]] on the health implications for the population of the Camelford area.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/written_answers/1989/jul/20/lowermoor-incident-group|journal=[[Hansard]]|date=20 July 1989|title=House of Commons Hansard Debates for 20 July 1989 (cc298-9W)|volume=157|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989 the LIHAG reported that there was no convincing evidence of a harmful build-up of aluminium and that there was no increase in ill health from poisoned water. A further enquiry by the same group in 1991 acknowledged the affair had caused "real suffering" in the community.&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="skytimeline" /&gt; However, Dame Barbara Clayton concluded that this was because of sensational reporting of the incident. She stated that "In our judgment it is likely that these symptoms would have occurred in the normal course of events," and the symptoms were wrongly attributed to the contamination because of "inaccurate and exaggerated" claims of health damage by scientists and the news media.&lt;ref name="rumbelow"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford spill damaged brains, says doctor|work=The Times|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first=Helen|last=Rumbelow|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Clayton report was released in July 1989, it caused "outrage in Camelford and wide disbelief in the scientific community."&lt;ref name="vidal"&gt;{{Cite news|title=New inquiry into water poisoning: Minister promises to look again at Camelford|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|first=John|last=Vidal|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; One section was later amended to read "alarming statements by ''pseudo-''scientists" rather than "...by ''some'' scientists".&lt;ref name=vidal /&gt;

===COT Lowermoor Subgroup report===
In June 2000 [[Environment minister]] [[Michael Meacher]] announced that there would not be an independent public inquiry, and declared "All the facts are fully known and there is no reason to believe that a public inquiry could add to that."&lt;ref name="Guardian-refused"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry refused|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jun/13/geoffreygibbs?INTCMP=ILCNETTXT3487|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=13 June 2000|first=Geoffrey|last=Gibbs}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2000 the [[Environmental Law Centre]] [http://www.elc.org.uk/pages/home.htm]&lt;!--external inline link can be deleted if &amp; when ELC article has been created--&gt; prepared a petition to the [[European Parliament]] calling for a Brussels-based inquiry.&lt;ref name= harris /&gt; On 14 August 2001 the government announced that an investigation – although not a full public inquiry – into the incident would take place.&lt;ref name="graves"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford health inquiry starts: Campaigners denied public hearing into contamination but minister backs 'quick' investigation|first=David|last=Graves|work=[[Daily Telegraph]]|location=London|date=15 August 2001|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation was to be undertaken by the newly formed Lowermoor Subgroup (LSG) consisting of scientific and health experts and local resident representatives, chaired by Frank Woods, a professor of medicine at the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref name=graves /&gt; Woods was also the head of the government's Committee on Toxicity of Chemicals in Food, Consumer Products and the Environment (COT), of which the Lowermoor team was a subgroup.&lt;ref name="woodcock"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Now Camelford waits for justice over 'poisoning'|work=[[Birmingham Post]]|location=Birmingham|date=15 August 2001|first=Andrew|last=Woodcock|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its remit was to advise on whether the incident had caused, or was expected to cause, long-term harm to human health and examine whether the existing programme of monitoring and research into the human health effects was sufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/19298.php|title=Draft Report Published into Lowermoor Water Contamination Incident, UK|work=Medical News Today|date=26 January 2005|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2005 draft report====

A draft report, published on 26 January 2005, was inconclusive, saying that the long-term health effects on the population were still unknown and that there was insufficient scientific information available to determine whether the health problems being experienced were caused by the contamination.&lt;ref name="brown2"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Camelford inquiry seeks new studies|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=27 January 2005|first=Paul|last=Brown|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Woods called for further studies and said: "We will be putting the strongest possible case to the minister. I believe carrying out that work is important, it is not something which should be dropped and pushed aside."&lt;ref name=brown2 /&gt;

The following year, Meacher made several criticisms of the group:
*the requirement to examine the DoH's handling of the incident was removed from the terms of reference
*no independent expert on aluminium toxicology was included in the working group
*an attempt was made to include Waring as medical adviser to the group, even though he was the author of the original letter stating that no lasting ill effects would result
*no objective testing of the exposed population was carried out
*too much reliance was placed on the water sample analysis from the South-West Water Authority, the compromised party
*the amount of sludge reported to have been in the contact tank at the time was ignored
*experts were drawn on who had potentially vested interests in the aluminium industry
*the DoH pre-released a highly misleading statement of the findings two days before the draft report was due to be made public
*the executive summary, prepared without the group's approval, and which effectively concluded that the illnesses reported bore no connection with the water poisoning, was "misleading and biased".&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

Two members of the LSG committee claimed in December 2007 that the DoH had known from the start that some people were at especially high risk from aluminium poisoning but deliberately suppressed this evidence to protect the government's plans for water privatisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Sturcke|first1=James|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2007/dec/13/water.pollution1|title=Coroner orders police to reopen Camelford pollution case|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=13 December 2007|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="yorkshire"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Police to investigate claims of water poisoning cover-up|url=http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/around-yorkshire/local-stories/police_to_investigate_claims_of_water_poisoning_cover_up_1_2484066|work=[[Yorkshire Post]]|location=Leeds|date=14 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====2013 final report====
The final report was published in April 2013, and concluded that it was unlikely that the exposure to chemicals could have caused long-term health problems. Key findings of the report include:

* there is no evidence that the combination of metals which occurred as a result of the incident could have caused delayed health effects
* there was an increase in childhood infections in the area, but this increase occurred before the pollution incident
* a study of cancer incidence and mortality showed that there was no increase in cancer incidence in the area after the pollution incident
* a dermatologist investigated skin and nail problems reported by individuals affected by the incident, and reported that the problems are similar to those experienced by the general population
* there is no evidence that the contaminants can cause joint or muscle pain and/or swelling, and these complaints are common in the general population
* a Camelford resident who died of severe cerebral amyloid angiopathy was found to have higher than normal aluminium concentrations in the brain during an autopsy. However samples from the brain of a patient with similar neuropathology but unknown aluminium exposure found similar higher than usual concentrations. Research commissioned by the coroner compared 60 postmortem brains and found no correlation between aluminium  or iron concentrations and the level of congophilic angiopathy or senile plaques&lt;ref name="bbc_2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cot_2013"/&gt;

==Health effects==

===Short-term===
A diverse array of short term health effects was reported by members of the public who either drank the contaminated water or came into contact with it while bathing.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dennis"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Johnson|first1=Dennis|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1988/oct/01/1|title=Official dismissed over contamination: Cornish manager made a scapegoat, says union|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=1 October 1988|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kent /&gt; These included:
*urinary complaints,
*[[desquamation|blistering and peeling]] of skin,
*hair turning blue or green,
*diarrhoea and vomiting, and
*[[arthralgia|joint pains]].

===Long-term===
A 1999 report in the ''[[British Medical Journal]]'' concluded that some victims had suffered "considerable damage" to their brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Altmann| first = Paul |author2=John Cunningham |author3=Usha Dhanesha |author4=Margaret Ballard |author5=James Thompson |author6=Frank Marsh | title = Disturbance of cerebral function in people exposed to drinking water contaminated with aluminium sulphate: retrospective study of the Camelford water incident|journal=BMJ|volume=319| issue = 7213|pages=807–811|date=25 September 1999|url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/319/7213/807| pmid = 10496822| pmc = 314205| doi=10.1136/bmj.319.7213.807}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted the [[#Lowermoor Incident Health Advisory Group report|1991 LIHAG report]] telling residents that their symptoms were due to anxiety. The study was led by a consultant [[nephrology|nephrologist]] at [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], [[Oxford]], and was the first large-scale clinical study of the affected residents. The report stated that their symptoms were similar to those of [[Alzheimer's disease]], which has also been linked with large quantities of aluminium accumulating in the brain.&lt;ref name=rumbelow /&gt; Rejecting the findings of the LIG, the report called for further research to determine the longer term prognosis for the affected individuals and led to fresh calls for a public inquiry into the pollution incident.&lt;ref name="court"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Brain damage found in pollution victims|work=[[The Scotsman]]|location=Edinburgh|date=24 September 1999|first=Chris|last=Court|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the study was carried out in 1991, its publication was delayed by the ongoing litigation between SWWA and the victims.&lt;ref name="laurance"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Contaminated water caused long-term brain damage in Camelford, say doctors study|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|date=24 September 1999|first1=Jeremy|last1=Laurance|first2=Cherry|last2=Norton|first3=Steve|last3=Boggan|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seven months after the contamination, one victim underwent a bone biopsy which "found a ring of aluminium like the rings you see in trees" that could not have resulted from normal aluminium absorption.&lt;ref name=boggan /&gt;&lt;ref name=meacher /&gt;

===Later deaths of victims===
The husband of [[#Carol Cross|Carol Cross]], who died of a rare form of dementia in 2004, said in 2006 that he believed that his wife and twenty other people had died as a result of the disaster, and that more cases were emerging.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt;

Victim Sarah Sillifant, who was in her twenties when she was exposed, hanged herself in 2005 after suffering dementia and other symptoms similar to those experienced by Carol Cross.&lt;ref name="indyscandal" /&gt; In June 2007, Irene Neal, who lived in Rock, near Camelford at the time of the incident, died aged 91. A post-mortem found an "unacceptable amount of aluminium in the brain".

====Carol Cross====
In 2006 a post-mortem [[inquest]] into the death of Carol Cross at age 58, who was exposed to the contaminated drinking water aged 44, showed that her brain contained 23 micrograms of aluminium per gram of brain, compared to the normal brain levels of 0–2 micrograms per gram. Her death was caused by a form of early-onset [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|beta amyloid angiopathy]], a cerebro-vascular disease usually associated with Alzheimer's, which could be connected to the abnormally high level of aluminium in her brain.&lt;ref name="savill"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's symptoms in toxic water woman's brain|work=Daily Telegraph|location=London|date=16 December 2005|first=Richard|last=Savill|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="liverpool"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water link to Alzheimer's|work=[[Liverpool Daily Post|Daily Post]]|location=Liverpool)|date=16 December 2005|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Rose, the West Somerset Coroner, said of the findings: "Further research will be needed before the significance of the elevated brain aluminium concentration in this case can be clarified. A scientific report on the case has been submitted for publication."&lt;ref name=liverpool /&gt; Daniel Perl, of New York's [[Mount Sinai School of Medicine]] said: "If additional similar cases were to appear among the 20,000 exposed individuals then the implications of this incident would become extremely important. Only time will tell. At the very least, increased efforts towards surveillance of individuals exposed in Camelford is certainly warranted."&lt;ref name="hawkes"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Alzheimer's linked to aluminium pollution in tap water|work=The Times|location=London|date=20 April 2006|first=Nigel|last=Hawkes|pages=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose had adjourned the inquests for Cross and Neal pending further studies, but in 2008 said the Government had refused "to either finance or assist" research to test the hypothesis of a link between exposure to aluminium and [[Cerebral amyloid angiopathy|congophilic amyloid angiopathy]]. He said this research was necessary to determine the consequences of the deceased having such a high level of aluminium. He later sought support from [[Somerset County Council]] so that the work could go ahead and once more adjourned the inquest into the death of Carol Cross, although Neal's inquest went ahead.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Inquests: Camelford coroner attacks lack of state cash|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|first=Steven|last=Morris|pages=8|date=6 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009 Rose announced that the inquest into Cross's death would resume in November 2010.&lt;ref name="greenwood"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner to quiz ex-water chief|work=Western Morning News|location=Plymouth|date=31 July 2009|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|pages=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rose said that "ongoing medical research would not be completed until late summer" 2010. He explained "This research is necessary to prove whether or not the high level of aluminium in Mrs Cross's brain causing her death through beta amyloid angiopathy (a form of cerebrovascular disease) on February 19, 2004, could be attributed to the aluminium sulphate placed in the public water supply at Lowermoor treatment works on July 6, 1988. This is the last adjournment I am able to agree and the inquest will commence on Monday November 1, 2010 at Taunton."&lt;ref name=greenwood /&gt;

When the inquest was reconvened Dr. Chris Exley, a reader in [[bioinorganic chemistry]] at [[Keele University]], said "The brain aluminium concentration was so high that it is highly likely that it contributed to her brain pathology, probably being responsible for the aggressive form and very early onset of the disease." [[Neuropathology|Neuropathologist]] Prof. Margaret Esiri, from the [[John Radcliffe Hospital]], said "I have never seen a case such as this at this age. I have seen one case in a woman who died aged 81 but the literature shows only a handful of cases worldwide."&lt;ref name="greenwood4"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Experts: Highly likely that polluted water caused death|work=[[Western Daily Press]]|location=Bristol|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of their evidence the inquest was again adjourned to allow South West Water Authority time to seek its own expert evidence.&lt;ref name="greenwood5"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Poison in water 'led to death'|work=[[Western Morning News]]|location=Plymouth|date=10 November 2010|first=Andy|last=Greenwood|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carol Cross's inquest was finally completed in March 2012. The coroner returned a [[narrative verdict]] recording the circumstances without attributing the cause, in which he said the water supply company, [[South West Water|South West Water Authority]] had been "gambling with as many as 20,000 lives" when they failed to inform the public about the poisoning for 16 days, a delay he called unacceptable. An expert said at the inquest that the levels of aluminium in her brain were "beyond belief".&lt;ref name="BBC-gambled"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-cornwall-17367243 |title=BBC News – Camelford water poisoning: Authority 'gambled with lives'|work=bbc.co.uk |date=14 March 2012|accessdate=14 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rose stated: "I found there was a deliberate policy to not advise the public of the true nature until some 16 days after the occurrence of the incident," and that "[T]he failure of the authority to visit every house after the incident to advise them to thoroughly flush their systems [w]as a serious dereliction of duty. I can say that the incident may either have contributed to or possibly caused Mrs Cross's death, but I do not have sufficient evidence to say so conclusively."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner attacks former water authority 'cover-up'|work=[[The West Briton]]|date=22 March 2012|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-30983330.html|location=Truro|accessdate=24 September 2012}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal actions against South West Water Authority==
In 1991 the South West Water Authority was fined £10,000 and ordered to pay £25,000 costs at [[Exeter]] Crown Court for supplying water likely to endanger public health. The authority paid at least £123,000 to settle almost 500 initial compensation claims and in 1997 a further 148 victims accepted out-of-court damages totalling almost £400,000, approved by a High Court judge sitting in [[Truro]]. The settlements ranged from £680 to £10,000.&lt;ref name=jury /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/1908534.stm|title=Camelford poisoning hearings begin|work=BBC News|date=3 April 2002|accessdate=17 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Water claims settled|work=[[The Independent]]|location=London|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-4650262.html|date=11 May 1994|accessdate=24 September 2011}}{{Subscription required|via=[[HighBeam Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some later claimed they were "railroaded" into accepting the out-of-court settlements after being told that their [[Legal aid#Legal aid in England and Wales|legal aid]] funding would be withdrawn if they continued with the lawsuit.&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt; The judge, Mr Justice Wright, said: "If the case had been contested, there would have been awesomely complex argument over how much [water] they consumed" and that they were "extraordinarily well advised to accept the offer."&lt;ref name="brown"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Residents accept pounds 400,000 from water company for pollution|work=[[The Guardian]]|location=London|date=11 May 1994|first=Paul|last=Brown}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cross later said: "The official medical claim from the health authority was that there was no known pathway for aluminium to be absorbed into the body. I would argue that this was a misrepresentation of scientific facts, however it was accepted by the judge [and he] instructed the jury that medical damages could not be awarded. The victims therefore received negligible compensation. This alone is adequate reason for a judicial review, since it resulted in a miscarriage of justice for the victims."&lt;ref name=cross /&gt;

==Allegations of a cover-up==
On 13 December 2007 Michael Rose announced that, in light of "a possible attempt to initially suppress the seriousness of the incident, I am asking the chief constable of Devon and Cornwall to hand me evidence gathered at the time of the original investigation," and for the chief constable to appoint a senior detective "to look into the allegations of a possible cover-up."&lt;ref name="bruxelles"&gt;{{Cite news|title=Coroner fears toxic water was covered up|work=The Times|location=London|date=14 December 2007|first=Simon|last=de Bruxelles|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of the incident the [[Water privatisation in England and Wales|water industry was about to be privatised]] by the Conservative government of the day; a letter written from a water official to [[Michael Howard]], then Minister of State for Water and Planning, emerged which stated that a police investigation into the poisoning incident was viewed as "very distracting" and that any subsequent prosecution of South West Water would also "be totally unhelpful to privatisation... and render the whole of the water industry unattractive to the City".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=A Lethal Cover-up|work=Daily Mail|location=London|date=15 December 2007|page=36|first=Sue|last=Reid}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Western Morning News]]'', using a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] request, uncovered a briefing note to the then Environment Minister, [[Nicholas Ridley, Baron Ridley of Liddesdale|Nicholas Ridley]], warning: "Those of the South West board with a commercial background are deeply concerned by the investigation."&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;
There was speculation in the news media that commercial concerns were given priority over public health.

The former North Cornwall [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Member of Parliament (MP) [[Paul Tyler, Baron Tyler|Paul Tyler]] also uncovered documents contradicting the water authority's claim that it had advised consumers not to drink the water, and that this advice had been given in a radio broadcast at 6{{nbsp}}am on 7 July 1988 and subsequently. The documents, relating to the prosecution of South West Water, alleged that this "was not the advice given to the public on the 6th, 7th, 8th, or indeed on the 12th," and added that the prosecution would say that the authority "misled Mr Healey (the head of the drinking water division at the Department of Environment)... There is evidence that a deliberate decision was made to conceal the truth from the public."&lt;ref name="bnet"&gt;Western Morning News, Was there a Camelford cover-up?, 14 December 2007. [http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 Available over the Internet] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20130505152742/http://western-morning-news.vlex.co.uk/vid/was-there-camelford-cover-up-77051283 |date=5 May 2013 }} by subscription&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler said "I can't think of any comparable accident or mistake anywhere in Britain, particularly one involving what was a government agency, where there was no attempt to investigate what went wrong and why."&lt;ref name="Guardian-justice" /&gt;

In 2001 Environment Minister Michael Meacher claimed that the Government feared what an unrestricted inquiry might find, and that "There was then a great deal of shenanigans about the terms of reference and fighting at all levels in order to limit the ambit of the committee to get the result they wanted. This inquiry was always potentially hugely damaging and hugely worrying to the establishment in terms of the way they handled the incident and clearly there are elements that want to shut it down." No named individuals were ever prosecuted.
The national water industry was sold, under the Conservative government, for £3.59 billion, with the sale of South West Water Authority raising around £300 million.&lt;ref name=bnet /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1570">In classical [[tragedies]], the '''catastasis''' (pl. ''catastases'') is the third part of an ancient [[drama]], in which the intrigue or action that was initiated in the [[epitasis]], is supported and heightened, until ready to be unravelled in the [[Catastrophe (drama)|catastrophe]]. It also refers to the [[Climax (narrative)|climax]] of a drama.&lt;ref&gt;{{1728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[rhetoric]], the '''catastasis''' is that part of a speech, usually the [[Exordium (rhetoric)|exordium]], in which the orator sets forth the subject matter to be discussed.&lt;ref&gt;''Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary'' (1913)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7683">A '''chemically defined medium''' is a [[growth medium]] suitable for the [[in vitro]] [[cell culture]] of [[human cells|human]] or [[animal cells]] in which all of the chemical components are known. Standard cell culture media are commonly supplemented with animal serum (such as fetal bovine serum, FBS) as a source of nutrients and other ill-defined factors. The technical disadvantages to using serum include its undefined nature, batch-to-batch variability in composition, and the risk of contamination.

There is a clear distinction between serum-free media and chemically defined media. Serum-free media may contain undefined animal-derived products such as serum albumin (purified from blood), hydrolysates, growth factors, hormones, carrier proteins, and attachment factors. These undefined animal-derived products will contain complex contaminants, such as the lipid content of albumin. In contrast, chemically defined media require that all of the components must be identified and have their exact concentrations known. Therefore, a chemically defined medium must be entirely free of animal-derived components and cannot contain either [[fetal bovine serum]], [[bovine serum albumin]] or [[human serum albumin]]. To achieve this, chemically defined media is commonly supplemented with recombinant versions of albumin and growth factors, usually derived from rice or ''E. coli'', or synthetic chemical such as the polymer [[polyvinyl alcohol]] which can reproduce some of the functions of BSA/HSA.

The constituents of a chemically defined media include: a basal media (such as DMEM, F12, or RPMI 1640, containing amino acids, vitamins, inorganic salts, buffers, antioxidants and energy sources), which is supplemented with recombinant albumin, chemically defined lipids, recombinant [[insulin]] and/or zinc, recombinant [[transferrin]] or iron, [[selenium]] and an antioxidant [[thiol]] such as [[2-mercaptoethanol]] or [[1-thioglycerol]]. Chemically defined media that are designed for the cultivation of cells in suspension additionally contain suitable [[Surfactant|surfactants]] such as [[Poloxamer|poloxamers]] in order to reduce shear stress caused by shaking and stirring.

==The advantages of chemically defined media==

* Avoidance of batch to batch variation of bovine serum or albumin, which causes inconsistency in growth-promoting properties. 
* Low protein content, which can hinder product purification. 
* Elimination of the risk of contaminants—viruses, mycoplasma, prions from animal-derived products which may be transmitted to the end product used by humans, e.g., bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) or mad cow disease. 
* Elimination of factors that may interfere with hormones or growth factors when studying their interaction with cells. 
* Removal of concerns regarding the limited availability of fetal bovine serum, with periods of world shortages. 
* Reduced cost: fetal calf serum can account for up to 85% of the over-all cost of the medium when calculated for large-scale cultures.  
* There are increasing concerns about animal suffering inflicted during serum collection that add an ethical imperative to move away from the use of serum wherever possible.

Chemically defined media also allows researchers who are studying in the field of cell physiology (especially extracellular) and or molecule–cell interactions to eliminate any variables that may arise due to the effects of unknown components in the medium. 

==Classes of media==
Animal culture media can be divided into six subsets based on the level of defined media (Jayme and Smith, 2000): From lowest definition to highest these are:

* Serum-containing media (commonly 10-20% FBS)
* Reduced-serum media (commonly 1-5% FBS)
* Serum-free media (synonymous with Defined media) 
* Protein-free media (no protein but contains undefined peptides from plant hydrolysates)
* Chemically-defined media (with only recombinant proteins and/or hormones)
* Protein-free, chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents, but can contain synthetic peptides/hormones)
* Peptide-free, protein-free chemically defined media (contains only low molecular weight constituents)

==Misuse of the term chemically defined media==
The term chemically defined media is often misused in the literature to refer to serum albumin-containing media. The term 'defined media' can also be used to describe this type of media. Media formulations containing the media supplement B27 (supplied by [[Invitrogen]]) are often erroneously referred to as chemically defined media (e.g. Yao et al., 2006) despite this product containing bovine serum albumin (Chen et al., 2008) using the above definitions this type of media is referred to as serum-free media. Peptide-free, protein-free, chemically defined media are rarely successfully formulated except for [[Chinese hamster ovary cell|CHO]] and insect cells.

==Other variants of serum-free/defined media include==
Animal protein-free media, containing human serum albumin, human transferrin, but potentially animal-derived insulin and lipids.

Xeno-free media, containing human serum albumin, human transferrin, human insulin, and chemically defined lipids.

[[Image:C albicans en.jpg|thumb|230px|right|Chlamydospores of the yeast ''[[Candida albicans]]'']]

Chlamydospores are usually dark-coloured, [[spherical]], and have a smooth (non-ornamented) surface. They are [[multicellular]], with cells connected by pores in the [[septum|septae]] between cells.

Chlamydospores are a result of [[asexual reproduction]] (in which case they are [[conidia]] called '''chlamydoconidia''') or sexual reproduction (rare).
[[Teliospore]]s are special kind of chlamydospores formed by [[Rust (fungus)|rusts]] and [[Smut (fungus)|smuts]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56806">In [[academia]], '''computational immunology''' is a [[field of science]] that encompasses high-throughput [[genomic]] and [[bioinformatics]] approaches to [[immunology]]. The field's main aim is to convert immunological data into computational problems, solve these problems using [[mathematical]] and computational approaches and then convert these results into immunologically meaningful interpretations.

== Introduction ==

The [[immune system]] is a complex system of the human body and understanding it is one of the most challenging topics in biology. Immunology research is important for understanding the mechanisms underlying the defense of human body and to develop drugs for immunological diseases and maintain health. Recent findings in genomic and proteomic technologies have transformed the immunology research drastically. Sequencing of the [[Human genome|human]] and other [[model organism]] [[genome]]s has produced increasingly large volumes of data relevant to immunology research and at the same time huge amounts of functional and clinical data are being reported in the scientific literature and stored in clinical records. Recent advances in [[bioinformatic]]s or [[computational biology]] were helpful to understand and organize these large scale data and gave rise to new area that is called '''''Computational immunology''''' or '''''immunoinformatics'''''.

Computational immunology is a branch of bioinformatics and it is based on similar concepts and tools, such as [[sequence alignment]] and [[protein structure]] prediction tools. [[Immunomics]] is a discipline like [[genomics]] and [[proteomics]]. It is a science, which specifically combines [[Immunology]] with [[computer science]], [[mathematics]], [[chemistry]], and [[biochemistry]] for large-scale analysis of immune system functions. It aims to study the complex [[protein–protein interaction]]s and networks and allows a better understanding of [[immune response]]s and their role during normal, diseased and reconstitution states. Computational immunology is a part of immunomics, which is focused on analyzing large scale experimental data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tong JC, Ren EC |title=Immunoinformatics: current trends and future directions |journal=Drug Discov.

== History ==

Computational immunology began over 90 years ago with the theoretic modeling of malaria epidemiology. At that time, the emphasis was on the use of mathematics to guide the study of disease transmission. Since then, the field has expanded to cover all other aspects of immune system processes and diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ross, R. |authorlink=Ronald Ross |title=An application of the theory of probabilities to the study of a priori pathometry.

== Immunological database ==

After the recent advances in sequencing and proteomics technology, there have been many fold increase in generation of molecular and immunological data. The data are so diverse that they can be categorized in different databases according to their use in the research. Until now there are total 31 different immunological databases noted in the [http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 Nucleic Acids Research (NAR) Database Collection], which are given in the following table, together with some more immune related databases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 Oxford Journals | Life Sciences | Nucleic Acids Research | Database Summary Paper Categories&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The information given in the table is taken from the database descriptions in [http://www.oxfordjournals.org/nar/database/cat/14 NAR Database Collection].

The gene products induced by IFN are responsible for the antiviral, antiproliferative and immunomodulatory properties of this cytokine. In order to obtain a more comprehensive understanding of the genes regulated by IFNs we have used different microarray formats to identify over 400 interferon stimulated genes (ISG). To facilitate the dissemination of this data we have compiled a database comprising the ISGs assigned into functional categories. The database is fully searchable and contains links to sequence and Unigene information. The database and the array data are accessible via the World Wide Web at (http://www.lerner.ccf.org/labs/williams/ ).

Immunoinformatics is using the basic bioinformatics tools such as ClustalW,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Thompson JD, Higgins DG, Gibson TJ |title=CLUSTAL W: improving the sensitivity of progressive multiple sequence alignment through sequence weighting, position-specific gap penalties and weight matrix choice |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=22 |issue=22 |pages=4673–80 |date=November 1994 |pmid=7984417 |pmc=308517 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=7984417 |doi=10.1093/nar/22.22.4673}}&lt;/ref&gt; BLAST,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Altschul SF, Madden TL, Schäffer AA |title=Gapped BLAST and PSI-BLAST: a new generation of protein database search programs |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=25 |issue=17 |pages=3389–402 |date=September 1997 |pmid=9254694 |pmc=146917 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9254694 |doi=10.1093/nar/25.17.3389|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and TreeView, as well as specialized immunoinformatics tools, such as EpiMatrix,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Elfaki|first=ME|title=Immunogenicity and immune modulatory effects of in silico predicted L. donovani candidate peptide vaccines|journal=Human Vaccines and Immunotheraputics|date=24 Aug 2012|pmid=22922767|doi=10.4161/hv.21881|volume=8|issue=12|pages=1769–74|pmc=3656064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=De Groot|first=AS|title=HIV vaccine development by computer assisted design: the GAIA vaccine|journal=Vaccine|date=March 2005|pmid=15755584|doi=10.1016/j.vaccine.2005.01.097|volume=23|issue=17–18|pages=2136–48|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMGT/V-QUEST for IG and TR sequence analysis, IMGT/ Collier-de-Perles and IMGT/StructuralQuery&lt;ref&gt;Kaas, Q. &amp; Lefranc, M.

There are also some computational models which focus on protein–protein interactions and networks. There are also tools which are used for T and B cell epitope mapping, proteasomal cleavage site prediction, and TAP– peptide prediction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montañez R, Navas-Delgado I, Medina MA, Aldana-Montes JF, Sánchez-Jiménez F |title=Information integration of protein-protein interactions as essential tools for immunomics |journal=Cell.

Computational immunology tools is the game between experimental data and mathematically designed computational tools.

== Applications ==

=== Allergies ===
[[Allergy|Allergies]], while a critical subject of immunology, also vary considerably among individuals and sometimes even among genetically similar individuals. The assessment of protein allergenic potential focuses on three main aspects: (i) immunogenicity; (ii) cross-reactivity; and (iii) clinical symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oehlschlager S, Reece P, Brown A |title=Food allergy—towards predictive testing for novel foods |journal=Food Addit Contam |volume=18 |issue=12 |pages=1099–107 |date=December 2001 |pmid=11761121 |doi=10.1080/02652030110050131 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immunogenicity is due to responses of an [[IgE]] [[antibody]]-producing B cell and/or of a [[T cell]] to a particular [[allergen]]. Therefore, immunogenicity studies focus mainly on identifying recognition sites of [[B-cells]] and T-cells for allergens. The three-dimensional structural properties of allergens control their allergenicity.

The use of immunoinformatics tools can be useful to predict protein allergenicity and will become increasingly important in the screening of novel foods before their wide-scale release for human use. Thus, there are major efforts under way to make reliable broad based allergy databases and combine these with well validated prediction tools in order to enable the identification of potential allergens in genetically modified drugs and foods. Though the developments are on primary stage, the World Health organization and Food and Agriculture Organization have proposed guidelines for evaluating allergenicity of genetically modified foods. According to the [[Codex alimentarius]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.codexalimentarius.org/ CODEX Alimentarius: Home&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a protein is potentially allergenic if it possesses an identity of ≥6 contiguous amino acids or ≥35% sequence similarity over an 80 amino acid window with a known allergen. Though there are rules, their inherent limitations have started to become apparent and exceptions to the rules have been well reported &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Li KB, Issac P, Krishnan A |title=Predicting allergenic proteins using wavelet transform |journal=Bioinformatics |volume=20 |issue=16 |pages=2572–8 |date=November 2004 |pmid=15117757 |doi=10.1093/bioinformatics/bth286 |url=http://bioinformatics.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15117757}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Infectious diseases and host responses ===

In the study of infectious diseases and host responses, the mathematical and computer models are a great help. These models were very useful in characterizing the behavior and spread of infectious disease, by understanding the dynamics of the pathogen in the host and the mechanisms of host factors which aid pathogen persistence. Examples include ''Plasmodium falciparum''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=van Noort SP, Nunes MC, Weedall GD, Hviid L, Gomes MG |title=Immune selection and within-host competition can structure the repertoire of variant surface antigens in ''Plasmodium falciparum''—a mathematical model |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=e9778 |year=2010 |pmid=20339540 |pmc=2842302 |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009778 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and nematode infection in ruminants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chan MS, Isham VS |title=A stochastic model of schistosomiasis immuno-epidemiology |journal=Math Biosci |volume=151 |issue=2 |pages=179–98 |date=August 1998 |pmid=9711049 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0025556498100147 |doi=10.1016/S0025-5564(98)10014-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much has been done in understanding immune responses to various pathogens by integrating genomics
and proteomics with bioinformatics strategies. Many exciting developments in large-scale screening of pathogens are currently taking place. [https://web.archive.org/web/20140801103537/http://www.niaid.nih.gov/Pages/default.aspx National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID)] has initiated an endeavor for systematic mapping of B and T cell epitopes of category A-C pathogens. These pathogens include ''Bacillus anthracis'' (anthrax), ''Clostridium botulinum'' toxin (botulism), ''Variola major'' (smallpox), ''Francisella tularensis'' (tularemia), viral hemorrhagic fevers, ''Burkholderia pseudomallei'', ''Staphylococcus enterotoxin'' B, yellow fever, influenza, rabies, Chikungunya virus etc. Rule-based systems have been reported for the automated extraction and curation of influenza A records.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Miotto O, Tan TW, Brusic V |title=Rule-based knowledge aggregation for large-scale protein sequence analysis of influenza A viruses |journal=BMC Bioinformatics |volume=9 |issue=Suppl 1 |pages=S7 |year=2008 |pmid=18315860 |pmc=2259408 |doi=10.1186/1471-2105-9-S1-S7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This development would lead to the development of an algorithm which would help to identify the conserved regions of pathogen sequences and in turn would be useful for vaccine development. This would be helpful in limiting the spread of infectious disease. Examples include a method for identification of vaccine targets from protein regions of conserved HLA binding&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olsen LR, Simon C, Kudahl UJ, Bagger FO, Winther O, Reinherz EL, Zhang GL, Brusic V |title=A computational method for identification of vaccine targets from protein regions of conserved human leukocyte antigen binding |journal=BMC Medical Genomics |volume=8(Suppl 4) |issue=S1 |pages= S1|year=2015 |pmid= 26679766|pmc=4682376 |doi=10.1186/1755-8794-8-S4-S1 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4682376/pdf/1755-8794-8-S4-S1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and computational assessment of cross-reactivity of broadly neutralizing antibodies against viral pathogens&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sun J, Kudahl UJ, Simon C, Cao Z, Reinherz EL, Brusic V |title=Large-Scale Analysis of B-Cell Epitopes on Influenza Virus Hemagglutinin – Implications for Cross-Reactivity of Neutralizing Antibodies |journal=Frontiers in Immunology |volume=5 |issue=38 |pages= 38|year=2014 |pmid= 24570677|pmc=3916768 |doi=10.3389/fimmu.2014.00038 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3916768/pdf/fimmu-05-00038.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;. These examples illustrate the power of immunoinformatics applications to help solve complex problems in public health. Immunoinformatics could accelerate the discovery process dramatically and potentially shorten the time required for vaccine development. Immunoinformatics tools have been used to design the vaccine against Dengue virus &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ali M, Pandey RK, Khatoon N, Narula A, Mishra A, Prajapati VK |title=Exploring dengue genome to construct a multi-epitope based subunit vaccine by utilizing immunoinformatics approach to battle against dengue infection |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=9232 |year=2017 |pmid=28835708 |pmc=5569093 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-09199-w |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-09199-w}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Leishmania &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Khatoon N, Pandey RK, Prajapati VK |title=Exploring Leishmania secretory proteins to design B and T cell multi-epitope subunit vaccine using immunoinformatics approach |journal=Scientific Reports |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=8285 |year=2017 |pmid=28811600 |pmc=5557753 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-08842-w |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-017-08842-w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immune system function ===

Using this technology it is possible to know the model behind immune system. It has been used to model T-cell-mediated suppression,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=León K, Peréz R, Lage A, Carneiro J |title=Modelling T-cell-mediated suppression dependent on interactions in multicellular conjugates |journal=[[Journal of Theoretical Biology|J.

There are also several models which are helpful in understanding the nature of specificity in immune network and immunogenicity.

For example, it was useful to examine the functional relationship between TAP peptide transport and HLA class I antigen presentation.&lt;ref name="model"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brusic V, van Endert P, Zeleznikow J, Daniel S, Hammer J, Petrovsky N |title=A neural network model approach to the study of human TAP transporter |journal=In Silico Biol. (Gedrukt) |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=109–21 |year=1999 |pmid=11471244 |url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/220500791
}}&lt;/ref&gt; TAP is a transmembrane protein responsible for the transport of antigenic peptides into the endoplasmic reticulum, where MHC them class I molecules can bind them and presented to T cells. As TAP does not bind all peptides equally, TAP-binding affinity could influence the ability of a particular peptide to gain access to the MHC class I pathway. Artificial neural network (ANN), a computer model was used to study peptide binding to human TAP and its relationship with MHC class I binding. The affinity of HLA-binding peptides for TAP was found to differ according to the HLA supertype concerned using this method. This research could have important implications for the design of peptide based immuno-therapeutic drugs and vaccines. It shows the power of the modeling approach to understand complex immune interactions.&lt;ref name="model"/&gt;

There exist also methods which integrate peptide prediction tools with computer simulations that can provide detailed information on the immune response dynamics specific to the given pathogen's peptides 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |authors=Rapin N, Lund O, Bernaschi M, Castiglione F. |title=Computational immunology meets bioinformatics: the use of prediction tools for molecular binding in the simulation of the immune system. |journal=PLoS ONE |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=e9862|date=2010  |doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0009862|pmid=20419125 |pmc=2855701 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.


  
=== Cancer Informatics ===

Cancer is the result of somatic mutations which provide cancer cells with a selective growth advantage. Recently it has been very important to determine the novel mutations. Genomics and proteomics techniques are used worldwide to identify mutations related to each specific cancer and their treatments. Computational tools are used to predict growth and surface antigens on cancerous cells. There are publications explaining a targeted approach for assessing mutations and cancer risk. Algorithm CanPredict was used to indicate how closely a specific gene resembles known cancer-causing genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kaminker JS, Zhang Y, Watanabe C, Zhang Z |title=CanPredict: a computational tool for predicting cancer-associated missense mutations |journal=Nucleic Acids Res. |volume=35 |issue=Web Server issue |pages=W595–8 |date=July 2007 |pmid=17537827 |pmc=1933186 |doi=10.1093/nar/gkm405 |url=http://nar.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=17537827}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer immunology has been given so much importance that the data related to it is growing rapidly.

{{Cosmology|early}}
The '''cosmic microwave background''' ('''CMB, CMBR''') is [[electromagnetic radiation]] as a remnant from an early stage of the universe in [[Big Bang]] cosmology. In older literature, the CMB is also variously known as cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR) or "relic radiation". The CMB is a faint [[cosmic background radiation]] filling all space that is an important source of data on the early universe because it is the oldest electromagnetic radiation in the universe, dating to the [[epoch of recombination]]. With a traditional [[optical telescope]], the space between stars and galaxies (the ''background'') is completely dark. However, a sufficiently sensitive [[radio telescope]] shows a faint background noise, or glow, almost [[isotropic]], that is not associated with any star, galaxy, or other object. This glow is strongest in the [[microwave]] region of the radio spectrum. The accidental discovery of the CMB in 1964 by American radio astronomers [[Arno Penzias]] and [[Robert Woodrow Wilson|Robert Wilson]]&lt;ref name="Penzias&amp;Wilson"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Penzias |first=A.

The discovery of CMB is landmark evidence of the [[Big Bang]] origin of the universe. When the universe was young, before the formation of stars and planets, it was denser, much hotter, and filled with a uniform glow from a white-hot fog of hydrogen [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]]. As the universe expanded, both the plasma and the radiation filling it grew cooler. When the universe cooled enough, protons and electrons combined to form neutral hydrogen atoms. Unlike the uncombined protons and electrons, these newly conceived atoms could not absorb the thermal radiation, and so the universe became transparent instead of being an [[Opacity (optics)|opaque]] fog.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite serial |last=Kaku |first=M. |author-link=Michio Kaku |date=2014 |episode=First Second of the Big Bang |title=[[How the Universe Works]] |season=3 |number=4 |network=[[Science Channel|Discovery Science]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cosmologists]] refer to the time period when neutral atoms first formed as the ''[[Recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] epoch'', and the event shortly afterwards when [[photons]] started to travel freely through space rather than constantly being scattered by electrons and protons in [[plasma (physics)|plasma]] is referred to as photon [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]]. The photons that existed at the time of photon decoupling have been propagating ever since, though growing fainter and less [[photon energy|energetic]], since the [[Metric expansion of space|expansion of space]] causes their [[wavelength]] to increase over time (and wavelength is inversely proportional to energy according to [[Planck's relation]]). This is the source of the alternative term ''relic radiation''. The ''surface of last scattering'' refers to the set of points in space at the right distance from us so that we are now receiving photons originally emitted from those points at the time of photon decoupling.

Precise measurements of the CMB are critical to cosmology, since any proposed model of the universe must explain this radiation. The CMB has a thermal [[black body]] spectrum at a temperature of {{val|2.72548|0.00057|u=K}}.&lt;ref name=apj707_2_916&gt;{{Cite journal |last1=Fixsen |first1=D.

Alternatively, if [[spectral radiance]] is defined as dE&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt;/dλ, then the peak wavelength is 1.063&amp;nbsp;mm (282&amp;nbsp;GHz, 1.168 x 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; eV photons). The glow is very nearly uniform in all directions, but the tiny residual variations show a very specific pattern, the same as that expected of a fairly uniformly distributed hot [[gas]] that has expanded to the current size of the universe. In particular, the spectral radiance at different angles of observation in the sky contains small [[anisotropy|anisotropies]], or irregularities, which vary with the size of the region examined. They have been measured in detail, and match what would be expected if small thermal variations, generated by [[quantum fluctuations]] of matter in a very tiny space, had expanded to the size of the [[observable universe]] we see today. This is a very active field of study, with scientists seeking both better data (for example, the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck spacecraft]]) and better interpretations of the initial conditions of expansion. Although many different processes might produce the general form of a black body spectrum, no model other than the Big Bang has yet explained the fluctuations. As a result, most cosmologists consider the Big Bang model of the universe to be the best explanation for the CMB.

The high degree of uniformity throughout the [[observable universe]] and its faint but measured anisotropy lend strong support for the Big Bang model in general and the [[ΛCDM model|ΛCDM ("Lambda Cold Dark Matter") model]] in particular. Moreover, the fluctuations are [[coherence (physics)|coherent]] on angular scales that are larger than the apparent [[cosmological horizon]] at recombination. Either such coherence is acausally [[fine-tuned]], or [[cosmic inflation]] occurred.&lt;ref name="hep-ph/0309057"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dodelson |first=S. |year=2003 |title=Coherent Phase Argument for Inflation |journal=[[AIP Conference Proceedings]] |volume=689 |pages=184–196 |arxiv=hep-ph/0309057 |bibcode=2003AIPC..689..184D |doi=10.1063/1.1627736|citeseerx=10.1.1.344.3524 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Baumann |first=D. |date=2011 |title=The Physics of Inflation |url=http://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/db275/TEACHING/INFLATION/Lectures.pdf |publisher=[[University of Cambridge]] |accessdate=2015-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cosmic microwave background was first predicted in 1948 by [[Ralph Alpher]] and [[Robert Herman]].&lt;ref&gt;

This high estimate was due to a mis-estimate of the [[Hubble constant]] by Alfred Behr, which could not be replicated and was later abandoned for the earlier estimate. Although there were several previous estimates of the temperature of space, these suffered from two flaws. First, they were measurements of the [[effective temperature|''effective'' temperature]] of space and did not suggest that space was filled with a thermal [[Planck spectrum]]. Next, they depend on our being at a special spot at the edge of the [[Milky Way]] galaxy and they did not suggest the radiation is isotropic. The estimates would yield very different predictions if Earth happened to be located elsewhere in the universe.&lt;ref&gt;

The 1948 results of Alpher and Herman were discussed in many physics settings through about 1955, when both left the Applied Physics Laboratory at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. The mainstream astronomical community, however, was not intrigued at the time by cosmology. Alpher and Herman's prediction was rediscovered by [[Yakov Zel'dovich]] in the early 1960s, and independently predicted by [[Robert Dicke]] at the same time. The first published recognition of the CMB radiation as a detectable phenomenon appeared in a brief paper by [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] astrophysicists [[A. G. Doroshkevich]] and [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov|Igor Novikov]], in the spring of 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Penzias|first=A.

The interpretation of the cosmic microwave background was a controversial issue in the 1960s with some proponents of the [[steady state theory]] arguing that the microwave background was the result of [[integrated starlight|scattered starlight]] from distant galaxies.&lt;ref&gt;

The cosmic microwave background radiation and the [[Hubble's law|cosmological redshift]]-distance relation are together regarded as the best available evidence for the [[Big Bang]] theory.

The CMB essentially confirms the Big Bang theory. In the late 1940s Alpher and Herman reasoned that if there was a big bang, the expansion of the universe would have stretched and cooled the high-energy radiation of the very early universe into the microwave region of the [[electromagnetic spectrum]], and down to a temperature of about 5&amp;nbsp;K. They were slightly off with their estimate, but they had exactly the right idea. They predicted the CMB. It took another 15 years for Penzias and Wilson to stumble into discovering that the microwave background was actually there.&lt;ref name="Apeiron2_3_79"/&gt;

The CMB gives a snapshot of the [[universe]] when, according to standard cosmology, the temperature dropped enough to allow [[electron]]s and [[proton]]s to form [[hydrogen]] atoms, thereby making the universe nearly transparent to radiation because light was no longer being [[Thomson scattering|scattered]] off free electrons. When it originated some 380,000 years after the Big Bang—this time is generally known as the "time of last scattering" or the period of [[recombination (cosmology)|recombination]] or [[Decoupling (cosmology)|decoupling]]—the temperature of the universe was about 3000&amp;nbsp;K. This corresponds to an energy of about 0.26&amp;nbsp;[[electronvolt|eV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://physics.nist.gov/cgi-bin/cuu/Convert?exp=3&amp;num=3&amp;From=k&amp;To=ev&amp;Action=Convert+value+and+show+factor | title=Converted number: Conversion from K to eV}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is much less than the 13.6 eV ionization energy of hydrogen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv |eprint=astro-ph/9508159|last1=Fixsen|first1=D. J.|title=Formation of Structure in the Universe|year=1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since decoupling, the temperature of the background radiation has dropped by a factor of roughly 1,100&lt;ref name="FirstWMAP"/&gt; due to the expansion of the universe. As the universe expands, the CMB photons are [[redshift]]ed, causing them to decrease in energy. The temperature of this radiation stays [[inversely proportional]] to a parameter that describes the relative expansion of the universe over time, known as the [[scale factor (universe)|scale length]]. The temperature ''T''&lt;sub&gt;r&lt;/sub&gt; of the CMB as a function of redshift, ''z'', can be shown to be proportional to the temperature of the CMB as observed in the present day (2.725&amp;nbsp;K or 0.2348 meV):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=Noterdaeme, P. | author2=Petitjean, P. | author3=Srianand, R. | author4=Ledoux, C. | author5=López, S. | title=The evolution of the cosmic microwave background temperature.

===Primary anisotropy===
[[File:PowerSpectrumExt.svg|thumb|right|300px|The power spectrum of the cosmic microwave background radiation temperature anisotropy in terms of the angular scale (or [[multipole moment]]). The data shown comes from the [[WMAP]] (2006), [[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver|Acbar]] (2004) [[BOOMERanG experiment|Boomerang]] (2005), [[Cosmic Background Imager|CBI]] (2004), and [[Very Small Array|VSA]] (2004) instruments. Also shown is a theoretical model (solid line).]]
The [[anisotropy]], or directional dependency, of the cosmic microwave background is divided into two types: primary anisotropy, due to effects that occur at the last scattering surface and before; and secondary anisotropy, due to effects such as interactions of the background radiation with hot gas or gravitational potentials, which occur between the last scattering surface and the observer.

The structure of the cosmic microwave background anisotropies is principally determined by two effects: acoustic oscillations and [[diffusion damping]] (also called collisionless damping or [[Joseph Silk|Silk]] damping). The acoustic oscillations arise because of a conflict in the [[photon]]–[[baryon]] plasma in the early universe. The pressure of the photons tends to erase anisotropies, whereas the gravitational attraction of the baryons, moving at speeds much slower than light, makes them tend to collapse to form overdensities. These two effects compete to create acoustic oscillations, which give the microwave background its characteristic peak structure. The peaks correspond, roughly, to resonances in which the photons decouple when a particular mode is at its peak amplitude.

The peaks contain interesting physical signatures. The angular scale of the first peak determines the [[shape of the universe|curvature of the universe]] (but not the [[topology]] of the universe). The next peak—ratio of the odd peaks to the even peaks—determines the reduced baryon density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/baryons.html |title=Baryons and Inertia |author=Wayne Hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third peak can be used to get information about the dark-matter density.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://background.uchicago.edu/~whu/intermediate/driving.html |title=Radiation Driving Force |author=Wayne Hu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The locations of the peaks also give important information about the nature of the primordial density perturbations. There are two fundamental types of density perturbations called ''adiabatic'' and ''isocurvature''. A general density perturbation is a mixture of both, and different theories that purport to explain the primordial density perturbation spectrum predict different mixtures.
; Adiabatic density perturbations: In an adiabatic density perturbation, the fractional additional number density of each type of particle ([[baryon]]s, [[photon]]s ...) is the same. That is, if at one place there is a 1% higher number density of baryons than average, then at that place there is also a 1% higher number density of photons (and a 1% higher number density in neutrinos) than average. [[Cosmic inflation]] predicts that the primordial perturbations are adiabatic.
; Isocurvature density perturbations: In an isocurvature density perturbation, the sum (over different types of particle) of the fractional additional densities is zero. That is, a perturbation where at some spot there is 1% more energy in baryons than average, 1% more energy in photons than average, and 2% ''less'' energy in neutrinos than average, would be a pure isocurvature perturbation. [[Cosmic string]]s would produce mostly isocurvature primordial perturbations.

The CMB spectrum can distinguish between these two because these two types of perturbations produce different peak locations. Isocurvature density perturbations produce a series of peaks whose angular scales (''l'' values of the peaks) are roughly in the ratio 1:3:5:..., while adiabatic density perturbations produce peaks whose locations are in the ratio 1:2:3:...&lt;ref name="hu_white_1996"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hu |first=W.|last2=White|first2=M.|year=1996|title=Acoustic Signatures in the Cosmic Microwave Background|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal]]|volume=471|pages=30–51|doi=10.1086/177951|bibcode=1996ApJ...471...30H|arxiv = astro-ph/9602019 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Observations are consistent with the primordial density perturbations being entirely adiabatic, providing key support for inflation, and ruling out many models of structure formation involving, for example, cosmic strings.

Collisionless damping is caused by two effects, when the treatment of the primordial plasma as [[fluid]] begins to break down:
* the increasing [[mean free path]] of the photons as the primordial plasma becomes increasingly rarefied in an expanding universe,
* the finite depth of the last scattering surface (LSS), which causes the mean free path to increase rapidly during decoupling, even while some Compton scattering is still occurring.
These effects contribute about equally to the suppression of anisotropies at small scales and give rise to the characteristic exponential damping tail seen in the very small angular scale anisotropies.

The depth of the LSS refers to the fact that the decoupling of the photons and baryons does not happen instantaneously, but instead requires an appreciable fraction of the age of the universe up to that era. One method of quantifying how long this process took uses the ''photon visibility function'' (PVF). This function is defined so that, denoting the PVF by ''P''(''t''), the probability that a CMB photon last scattered between time ''t'' and {{nobr|''t'' + ''dt''}} is given by ''P''(''t'')&amp;thinsp;''dt''.

The maximum of the PVF (the time when it is most likely that a given CMB photon last scattered) is known quite precisely. The first-year [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe|WMAP]] results put the time at which ''P''(''t'') has a maximum as 372,000 years.&lt;ref name="WMAP_1_cosmo_params"&gt;{{cite journal|author=WMAP Collaboration|year=2003|title=First-Year Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe (WMAP) Observations: Determination of Cosmological Parameters|journal=[[Astrophysical Journal Supplement Series]]|volume=148|last2=Verde|issue=1|pages=175–194|first2=L.|doi=10.1086/377226|last3=Peiris|first3=H. V.|last4=Komatsu|first4=E.|last5=Nolta|first5=M. R.|last6=Bennett|first6=C. L.|last7=Halpern|first7=M.|last8=Hinshaw|first8=G.|last9=Jarosik|first9=N.|arxiv=astro-ph/0302209|bibcode=2003ApJS..148..175S| displayauthors = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is often taken as the "time" at which the CMB formed. However, to figure out how ''long'' it took the photons and baryons to decouple, we need a measure of the width of the PVF. The WMAP team finds that the PVF is greater than half of its maximal value (the "full width at half maximum", or FWHM) over an interval of 115,000 years. By this measure, decoupling took place over roughly 115,000 years, and when it was complete, the universe was roughly 487,000 years old.

===Late time anisotropy===
Since the CMB came into existence, it has apparently been modified by several subsequent physical processes, which are collectively referred to as late-time anisotropy, or secondary anisotropy. When the CMB photons became free to travel unimpeded, ordinary matter in the universe was mostly in the form of neutral hydrogen and helium atoms. However, observations of galaxies today seem to indicate that most of the volume of the [[intergalactic medium]] (IGM) consists of ionized material (since there are few absorption lines due to hydrogen atoms). This implies a period of [[reionization]] during which some of the material of the universe was broken into hydrogen ions.

The CMB photons are scattered by free charges such as electrons that are not bound in atoms. In an ionized universe, such charged particles have been liberated from neutral atoms by ionizing (ultraviolet) radiation. Today these free charges are at sufficiently low density in most of the volume of the universe that they do not measurably affect the CMB. However, if the IGM was ionized at very early times when the universe was still denser, then there are two main effects on the CMB:
# Small scale anisotropies are erased. (Just as when looking at an object through fog, details of the object appear fuzzy.)
# The physics of how photons are scattered by free electrons ([[Thomson scattering]]) induces polarization anisotropies on large angular scales. This broad angle polarization is correlated with the broad angle temperature perturbation.

Both of these effects have been observed by the WMAP spacecraft, providing evidence that the universe was ionized at very early times, at a [[redshift]] more than 17.{{clarify|date=January 2013}} The detailed provenance of this early ionizing radiation is still a matter of scientific debate. It may have included starlight from the very first population of stars ([[population III]] stars), supernovae when these first stars reached the end of their lives, or the ionizing radiation produced by the accretion disks of massive black holes.

The time following the emission of the cosmic microwave background—and before the observation of the first stars—is semi-humorously referred to by cosmologists as the [[Timeline of the Big Bang#Dark Ages|dark age]], and is a period which is under intense study by astronomers (see [[21 centimeter radiation]]).

Two other effects which occurred between reionization and our observations of the cosmic microwave background, and which appear to cause anisotropies, are the [[Sunyaev–Zel'dovich effect]], where a cloud of high-energy electrons scatters the radiation, transferring some of its energy to the CMB photons, and the [[Sachs–Wolfe effect]], which causes photons from the Cosmic Microwave Background to be gravitationally redshifted or blueshifted due to changing gravitational fields.

==Polarization==
[[Image:Gravitational lens-full.jpg|thumb|right|200px|This artist's impression shows how light from the early universe is deflected by the gravitational lensing effect of massive cosmic structures forming B-modes as it travels across the universe.]]
&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Cosmic inflation]] --&gt;
The cosmic microwave background is [[polarization (waves)|polarized]] at the level of a few microkelvin. There are two types of polarization, called E-modes and B-modes. This is in analogy to [[electrostatics]], in which the electric field (''E''-field) has a vanishing [[curl (mathematics)|curl]] and the magnetic field (''B''-field) has a vanishing [[divergence]]. The E-modes arise naturally from [[Thomson scattering]] in a heterogeneous plasma. The B-modes are not produced by standard scalar type perturbations. Instead they can be created by two mechanisms: the first one is by gravitational lensing of E-modes, which has been measured by the [[South Pole Telescope]] in 2013;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanson|first=D.|year=2013|title=Detection of B-mode polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background with data from the South Pole Telescope|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=111|issue=14|pages=141301|doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.141301|pmid=24138230|arxiv=1307.5830|url = http://www.nature.com/news/polarization-detected-in-big-bang-s-echo-1.13441 |bibcode = 2013PhRvL.111n1301H |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; the second one is from [[gravitational wave]]s arising from [[cosmic inflation]]. Detecting the B-modes is extremely difficult, particularly as the degree of foreground contamination is unknown, and the [[weak gravitational lensing]] signal mixes the relatively strong E-mode signal with the B-mode signal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lewis|first=A.|last2=Challinor|first2=A.|date=2006|title=Weak gravitational lensing of the CMB|journal=[[Physics Reports]]|volume=429|issue=1|pages=1–65|doi = 10.1016/j.physrep.2006.03.002|arxiv=astro-ph/0601594|bibcode = 2006PhR...429....1L }}&lt;/ref&gt;

E-modes were first seen in 2002 by the [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI).

==== Primordial gravitational waves ====
Primordial gravitational waves are [[gravitational waves]] that could be observed in the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background and having their origin in the [[early universe]]. Models of [[cosmic inflation]] predict that such gravitational waves should appear; thus, their detection supports the theory of inflation, and their strength can confirm and exclude different models of inflation. It is the result of three things: inflationary expansion of space itself, reheating after inflation, and turbulent fluid mixing of matter and radiation.

On 17 March 2014 it was announced that the [[BICEP and Keck Array|BICEP2]] instrument had detected the first type of B-modes, consistent with inflation and [[gravitational waves]] in the [[early universe]] at the level of {{nowrap|1=''r'' = {{val|0.20|+0.07|-0.05}}}}, which is the amount of power present in [[gravitational wave]]s compared to the amount of power present in other scalar density perturbations in the very early universe.

In October 2014, a measurement of the B-mode polarization at 150&amp;nbsp;GHz was published by the [[POLARBEAR]] experiment.&lt;ref name="pc1" /&gt; Compared to BICEP2, POLARBEAR focuses on a smaller patch of the sky and is less susceptible to dust effects.

==Microwave background observations==
{{main|List of cosmic microwave background experiments}}
Subsequent to the discovery of the CMB, hundreds of cosmic microwave background experiments have been conducted to measure and characterize the signatures of the radiation. The most famous experiment is probably the [[NASA]] Cosmic Background Explorer ([[Cosmic Background Explorer|COBE]]) satellite that orbited in 1989–1996 and which detected and quantified the large scale anisotropies at the limit of its detection capabilities. Inspired by the initial COBE results of an extremely isotropic and homogeneous background, a series of ground- and balloon-based experiments quantified CMB anisotropies on smaller angular scales over the next decade. The primary goal of these experiments was to measure the angular scale of the first acoustic peak, for which COBE did not have sufficient resolution. These measurements were able to rule out [[cosmic string]]s as the leading theory of cosmic structure formation, and suggested [[cosmic inflation]] was the right theory. During the 1990s, the first peak was measured with increasing sensitivity and by 2000 the [[BOOMERanG experiment]] reported that the highest power fluctuations occur at scales of approximately one degree. Together with other cosmological data, these results implied that the geometry of the universe is [[flat space|flat]]. A number of ground-based [[interferometer]]s provided measurements of the fluctuations with higher accuracy over the next three years, including the [[Very Small Array]], [[Degree Angular Scale Interferometer]] (DASI), and the [[Cosmic Background Imager]] (CBI). DASI made the first detection of the polarization of the CMB and the CBI provided the first E-mode polarization spectrum with compelling evidence that it is out of phase with the T-mode spectrum.

In June 2001, [[NASA]] launched a second CMB space mission, [[WMAP]], to make much more precise measurements of the large scale anisotropies over the full sky. [[WMAP]] used symmetric, rapid-multi-modulated scanning, rapid switching radiometers to minimize non-sky signal noise.&lt;ref name="FirstWMAP"/&gt; The first results from this mission, disclosed in 2003, were detailed measurements of the angular power spectrum at a scale of less than one degree, tightly constraining various cosmological parameters. The results are broadly consistent with those expected from [[cosmic inflation]] as well as various other competing theories, and are available in detail at NASA's data bank for Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) (see links below). Although WMAP provided very accurate measurements of the large scale angular fluctuations in the CMB (structures about as broad in the sky as the moon), it did not have the angular resolution to measure the smaller scale fluctuations which had been observed by former ground-based [[interferometer]]s.

A third space mission, the [[European Space Agency|ESA]] (European Space Agency) [[Planck Surveyor]], was launched in May 2009 and performed an even more detailed investigation until it was shut down in October 2013. Planck employed both [[HEMT]] radiometers and [[bolometer]] technology and measured the CMB at a smaller scale than WMAP. Its detectors were trialled in the Antarctic [[Viper telescope]] as ACBAR ([[Arcminute Cosmology Bolometer Array Receiver]]) experiment—which has produced the most precise measurements at small angular scales to date—and in the [[Archeops]] balloon telescope.

On 21 March 2013, the European-led research team behind the [[Planck (spacecraft)|Planck cosmology probe]] released the mission's all-sky map ([http://esacmt.esac.esa.int/science-e-media/img/61/51553_Planck_CMB_Mollweide_565.jpg 565x318 jpeg], [http://www.nasa.gov/images/content/735683main_pia16873-full_full.jpg 3600x1800 jpeg]) of the cosmic microwave background.&lt;ref name="NASA-20130321"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clavin |first1=Whitney |last2=Harrington |first2=J.D. |title=Planck Mission Brings Universe Into Sharp Focus |url=http://www.jpl.nasa.gov/news/news.php?release=2013-109&amp;rn=news.xml&amp;rst=3739 |date=21 March 2013|website=[[NASA]] |accessdate=21 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT-20130321g"&gt;{{cite web |author=Staff |title=Mapping the Early Universe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2013/03/21/science/space/0321-universe.html |date=21 March 2013 |website=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=23 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The map suggests the universe is slightly older than researchers expected.

Additional ground-based instruments such as the [[South Pole Telescope]] in Antarctica and the proposed [[Clover (telescope)|Clover]] Project, [[Atacama Cosmology Telescope]] and the [[QUIET telescope]] in Chile will provide additional data not available from satellite observations, possibly including the B-mode polarization.

==Data reduction and analysis==
Raw CMBR data, even from space vehicles such as WMAP or Planck, contain foreground effects that completely obscure the fine-scale structure of the cosmic microwave background. The fine-scale structure is superimposed on the raw CMBR data but is too small to be seen at the scale of the raw data. The most prominent of the foreground effects is the dipole anisotropy caused by the Sun's motion relative to the CMBR background. The dipole anisotropy and others due to Earth's annual motion relative to the Sun and numerous microwave sources in the galactic plane and elsewhere must be subtracted out to reveal the extremely tiny variations characterizing the fine-scale structure of the CMBR background.

The detailed analysis of CMBR data to produce maps, an angular power spectrum, and ultimately cosmological parameters is a complicated, computationally difficult problem. Although computing a power spectrum from a map is in principle a simple [[Fourier transform]], decomposing the map of the sky into [[spherical harmonics]], in practice it is hard to take the effects of noise and foreground sources into account. In particular, these foregrounds are dominated by galactic emissions such as [[Bremsstrahlung]], [[Synchrotron radiation#Synchrotron radiation in astronomy|synchrotron]], and [[dust#Dust in other contexts|dust]] that emit in the microwave band; in practice, the galaxy has to be removed, resulting in a CMB map that is not a full-sky map. In addition, point sources like galaxies and clusters represent another source of foreground which must be removed so as not to distort the short scale structure of the CMB power spectrum.

Constraints on many cosmological parameters can be obtained from their effects on the power spectrum, and results are often calculated using [[Markov Chain Monte Carlo]] sampling techniques.

===Microwave background radiation predictions and measurements===
* 1941 – [[Andrew McKellar]] detected the cosmic microwave background as the coldest component of the interstellar medium by using the excitation of CN doublet lines measured by W. S. Adams in a B star, finding an "effective temperature of space" (the average [[bolometer|bolometric]] temperature) of 2.3&amp;nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]]&lt;ref name="dao7"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16606">'''Cultural group selection''' is an explanatory model within [[cultural evolution]] of how cultural traits evolve according to the competitive advantage they bestow upon a group. This multidisciplinary approach to the question of human culture engages research from the fields of [[anthropology]], [[behavioural economics]], [[evolutionary biology]], [[evolutionary game theory]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]].

While cultural norms are often beneficial to the individuals who hold them, they need not be.&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, Jared. "The Worst Mistake in the History of the Human Race." Discover Magazine. May. 64-66. 1987.&lt;/ref&gt; Norms can spread by cultural group selection when they are practiced within successful groups, and norms are more likely to spread from groups that are successful. But, for cultural group selection to occur, there must exist, between groups, cultural differences that when transmitted across time affect the persistence or proliferation of the groups.&lt;ref name="campbell"&gt;Campbell, D.T. Variation and selective retention in sociocultural evolution. Social change in developing areas: A reinterpretation of evolutionary theory. Cambridge: Schenkman. 1965. 19-49.&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural norms that provide these advantages will, in turn, lead to the displacement, absorption or even extinction of other, less successful cultural groups.&lt;ref name="sol" &gt;Soltis, J., Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1995. Can group-functional behaviours evolve by cultural group selection? An empirical test. Current Anthropology 36 (3), 473–494.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[game theory|game theoretic]] models suggest that if individuals are able to migrate between groups (which is common in small-scale societies), differences between groups should be difficult to maintain.&lt;ref name="joe" &gt;Henrich, J. Cultural group selection, coevolutionary processes and large-scale cooperation. Journal of Economic Behavior &amp; Organization. Volume 53, Issue 1, January 2004, 3–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Research in psychology reveals that humans have a particular set of traits, which include [[imitation]], [[conformity]], and [[in-group bias]], that are capable of supporting the maintenance of these group differences over extended periods of time.

Cultural group selection gives a compelling explanation for how large-scale complex societies have formed. While altruistic behaviour such as [[kin selection]] and [[Reciprocity (social and political philosophy)|reciprocity]] can explain the behaviour of small social groups common in many species, it is unable to explain the large complex societies of unrelated, anonymous individuals that we see in the human species.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; However, one of the major distinctions between humans and other species is our reliance on [[Observational learning|social learning]] in acquiring behaviours.&lt;ref name="chimp"&gt;Horner, V. Whiten, A. Causal knowledge and imitation/emulation switching in chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) and children (Homo sapiens). Animal Cognition (2005) 8: 164–181&lt;/ref&gt; These instincts allow for the acquisition and persistence of culture.&lt;ref name="tomasello"&gt;Tomasello, M. The Human Adaptation for Culture. Annual Review of Anthropology, Vol. 28, (1999), pp. 509-529&lt;/ref&gt; Through cultural group selection, culturally specific cooperative behaviour can evolve to support large societies.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; For example, in a study that spanned a variety of cultures, testing behaviour in [[Ultimatum game|Ultimatum]], [[Dictator game|Dictator]], and [[Third-party punishment]] games, it was found that standards of fairness and inclination to punish were correlated with both participation in world religions and market integration.&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., et al. Markets, Religion, Community Size, and the Evolution of Fairness and Punishment. Science 327, 1480 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; This indicates how many of the behaviours necessary for complex societies are the result of cultural exposure rather than any evolution of our psychology.

== Human adaptations for culture ==
For cultural knowledge and behaviour to persist across multiple generations, humans need to have the capacity to acquire, retain, and transmit cultural information. While many species engage in social learning, humans consistently rely upon it for behavioural cues and information about the environment. In a study comparing human children and young chimpanzees, it was shown that, when given a demonstration on how to retrieve a reward from a box, chimps copy relevant behaviour, while ignoring irrelevant behaviour, to solve the task. Meanwhile, human children will faithfully imitate both relevant and irrelevant behaviour to solve the same task.&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; While this may seem like a negative quality, it is what allows for reliable, high-fidelity transmission of cultural information, and produces stable behavioural equilibria within cultural groups.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

[[Michael Tomasello]] suggests the following three adaptations are necessary for human culture:&lt;ref name="tomasello" /&gt;

=== Joint attention ===
At around 9–12 months infants begin engaging in [[joint attention]]. This involves following the gaze of an adult or using them as social reference points. Put simply, they become aware of the adult's attention and behaviour towards objects in the environment. In this sense, the child is beginning to understand people as goal-oriented intentional agents. This is vitally important for learning through imitation and, eventually, language acquisition.

=== Imitative learning ===
By about 1 year of age, children begin to learn by imitation. At this point, children are capable of discriminating intentional actions from unintentional ones, and will attempt to accurately copy those intentional actions to accomplish tasks they've seen adults do. Because of [[imitative learning]], children will copy those intentional acts which have no perceivable effect on the outcome,&lt;ref name="chimp" /&gt; as well as strange or unnatural actions when easier methods are available. For example, an [[Andrew Meltzoff]] study found that 14-month-old children will, after seeing an adult do it, bend at the waist and press a panel with their head to turn on a light, instead of using their hands.&lt;ref&gt;Meltzoff A. 1988. Infant imitation after a one-week delay: long term memory for novel acts and multiple stimuli. Dev. Psychol. 24:470-76&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tomasello, imitative learning is necessary for learning the symbolic conventions of language.

=== Linguistic symbols and cognitive representation ===
Through imitatively learning, the child comprehends that linguistic symbols are intended to focus attention to some specific aspect of the shared experience. In doing this, the child must be able to take the perspective of the speaker. Due to the intersubjectivity of linguistic symbols, language allows one to communicate various perspectives and shift attention to one aspect of the world over another. In learning a language, a child is inheriting a vast set of linguistic symbols that have been passed down many generations. What is inherited then is the methods of shifting attention and perspective that were historically of importance to the people of that culture.

== Mechanisms that maintain between-group variation ==
Without between-group variation, cultural group selection could not occur, as there would be no group differentiation to select for. While processes such as cultural drift, epidemics, and natural disasters increase between-group variation, migration and genetic mixing decrease between-group variation ''and'' increase within-group variation. Variation is only maintained when cultural groups have mechanisms that prevent the norms of outside groups from invading the cultural group. These ‘mechanisms’ are those uniquely human psychological traits and behaviours that encourage imitation, conformity, and in-group biases.

According to [[Joseph Henrich]], between-group variation is maintained by the following four mechanisms:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Conformist transmission ===
Conformist transmission refers to the psychological bias to preferentially imitate high frequency behaviors in the cultural group. This homogenizes the social group and reinforces widely held cultural norms. This explains why individuals within a social group hold the same beliefs and why these beliefs persist over time. While individuals will rely on copying high frequency behaviors under various conditions, this reliance increases when an individual is exposed to ambiguous environmental or social information.&lt;ref name="Boyd85"&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1985. Culture and the Evolutionary Process. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, IL.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, G., Fudenberg, D., 1993. Rules of thumb for social learning. Journal of Political Economy 101 (4),
612–643.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baron, R., Vandello, J., Brunsman, B., 1996. The forgotten variable in conformity research: impact of task
importance on social influence. Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 71 (5), 915–927.&lt;/ref&gt; Conformist transmission can maintain between-group variation by reducing within-group variation, but it also facilitates the rapid spread of novel ideas, which increases between-group variation.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt; Taken together, reduced within-group variation and increased between-group variation lead to the cultural divergence between groups that is the driving force of cultural group selection.

=== Prestige-biased and self-similarity transmission ===
Prestige-biased transmission is the tendency the copy those members of the group that are more successful. Preferentially copying successful members of the group allows individuals to avoid costly trial-and-error learning by imitating the better-than-average skills of the more prestigious cultural models. Individual can determine the rank of potential models by how much deference they are shown by the rest of the group. Deference is shown to high-prestige individuals to gain the opportunity to copy their successful models. We can see evidence for this bias in how new technologies, or economic practices spread to different groups according to how quick "opinion leaders" adopt them.&lt;ref&gt;Rogers, E.M., 1995. Diffusion of Innovations. Free Press, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[self-similarity]] transmission is the tendency to copy those individuals who are similar in language, appearance, social standing and other behavioral and cultural traits. In the context of prestige-biased transmission, self-similarity means that individuals will preferentially imitate those high-prestige individuals who are similar to them. From the perspective of an imitator, this trait is adaptive. By only imitating those high-prestige individuals who are similar, the imitator avoids adopting traits or behaviors that are not compatible with his or her knowledge or social environment.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, R., Richerson, P.J., 1987. The evolution of ethnic markers. Cultural Anthropology 2 (1), 27–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

These two social biases act together in reducing within-group variation. Additionally, prestige-biased transmission increases between-group variation by contributing to the spread of novel ideas.&lt;ref name="Boyd85" /&gt;

=== Punishment of non-conformists ===
Non-conformists threaten to increase within-group variation by introducing deviant behaviours to the group and must receive costly punishment to maintain a homogenous social group. As a consequence of being punished, non-conformists will be less successful than other members of the group. Prestige-biased transmission would suggest that non-conformist behaviors would, therefore, not spread through the population. Papers on the topic suggest that this kind of punishment is prevalent across many different societies.&lt;ref&gt;Sober, E., Wilson, D.S., 1998. Unto Others: The Evolution and Psychology of Unselfish Behavior. Harvard
University Press, Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, A.E., Prasnikar, V., Okuno-Fujiwara, M., Zamir, S., 1991. Bargaining and market behavior in Jerusalem, Ljubljana, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study, Pittsburgh and Tokyo: an experimental study. American Economic Review 81 (5), 1068–1095.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Henrich, J., Boyd, R., Bowles, S., Gintis, H., Camerer, C., Fehr, E., McElreath, R., 2001. In search of Homo economicus: experiments in 15 small-scale societies. American Economic Review 91, 73–78.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fehr, E., Gächter, S., 2002. Altruistic punishment in humans. Nature 415, 137–140.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Normative conformity ===
Normative conformity is the act of changing one’s visible behaviour, simply to appear to match the majority, and without actually internalizing the groups opinions. This differs from conformist transmission since normative conformity does not consider frequency of a behaviour as an indicator of worth. The [[Asch conformity experiments]] are a perfect example of how robust this effect is&lt;ref&gt;Asch, S.E., 1951. Effects of group pressure upon the modification and distortion of judgments. In: Guetzkow, H. (Ed.), Groups, Leadership and Men. Carnegie, Pittsburgh, pp. 177–190.&lt;/ref&gt; and its replication across many cultures shows that this behaviour is very common.&lt;ref&gt;Furnham, A., 1984. Studies of cross-cultural conformity: a brief and critical review. Psychologia: An International
Journal of Psychology in the Orient 27 (1), 65–72.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Neto, F., 1995. Conformity and independence revisited. Social Behavior and Personality 23 (3), 217–222.&lt;/ref&gt; Henrich suggests that normative conformity may have evolved to respond to the spread of punishing behaviour toward non-conformists.&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt; By appearing similar to the group, one can gain the advantages of in-group membership, while also avoiding punishment. A curious byproduct of normative conformity is that it can contribute to the conformity transmission of norms that the transmitter does not hold, because they were mistakenly attributed by the imitator.

== Mechanisms ==
As [[Donald T. Campbell]] says, for cultural group selection to occur, there must be cultural differences between groups which affect their persistence or proliferation.&lt;ref name="campbell" /&gt; This means groups are selected ''for'' or ''against'' according to their respective ''gains'' or ''losses'' relative to other groups.

Joseph Henrich describes the three mechanisms through which this process occurs:&lt;ref name="joe" /&gt;

=== Demographic swamping ===
Demographic swamping occurs when one or more cultural groups reproduces individuals faster than other groups in the region because of stable, culturally transmitted ideas or practices.  This is the slowest kind of cultural groups selection as it depends on natural selection of between-group cultural variation operating on a scale of millennia. It has been suggested that this is how early agriculturalist displaced hunter-gatherer societies.&lt;ref&gt;Cavalli-Sforza, L.L., Menozzi, P., Piazza, A., 1994. The History and Geography of Human Genes. Princeton
University Press, Princeton, NJ.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Young and Bettinger, 1992Young, D., Bettinger, R.L., 1992. The numic spread: a computer simulation. American Antiquity 57 (1), 85–99.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diamond, J.M., 1997. Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies. W.W. Norton &amp; Company, New York.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Direct intergroup competition ===
Direct intergroup competition is the process by which cultural groups compete with each other over resources by engaging in warfare and raiding. The cultural practices and behaviour that gives an advantage to one group over another will proliferate at the expense of those who cannot compete. There are many possible traits that could contribute to a group's success, such as technological development, social and political organization, economic development, nationalism, etc. According to Joseph Soltis, it would take 500–1000 years for group selection to happen this way.&lt;ref name="sol" /&gt;

=== Prestige-biased group selection ===
In prestige-biased group selection, when individuals have opportunities to copy people from nearby groups, they will preferentially imitate the members of groups that are more cooperative than their own. Since cooperative groups have a higher average payoff than non-cooperative groups, members of cooperative groups will be considered more prestigious and worthy of imitation.

| Field        = [[Psychiatry]] }}
'''Developmental disability''' is a diverse group of chronic conditions that are due to mental or physical impairments that arise before adulthood. Developmental disabilities cause individuals living with them many difficulties in certain areas of life, especially in "language, mobility, learning, self-help, and independent living".&lt;ref name =cdc&gt;Center for Disease Control and Prevention. (2013). [https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/dd Developmental disabilities.] Retrieved October 18, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  Developmental disabilities can be detected early on and persist throughout an individual's lifespan. Developmental disability that affects all areas of a child's development is sometimes referred to as [[global developmental delay]].

Most common developmental disabilities:

* [[Down syndrome]] is a condition in which people are born with an extra copy of chromosome 21. Normally, a person is born with two copies of chromosome 21. However, if they are born with Down syndrome, they have an extra copy of this chromosome. This extra copy affects the development of the body and brain, causing physical and mental challenges for the individual.
* [[Fragile X syndrome]] (FXS) is thought to cause [[autism]] and intellectual disability, usually among boys. 
* [[Pervasive developmental disorders]] (PDD) are a group of developmental disabilities that can cause significant social, communication and behavioral challenges.  
* [[Fetal alcohol spectrum disorder|Fetal alcohol spectrum disorders]] (FASD) are a group of conditions that can occur in a person whose mother drank alcohol during pregnancy. 
* [[Cerebral palsy]] (CP) is a group of disorders that affect a person’s ability to move and maintain balance and posture. CP is the most common motor disability in childhood.&lt;ref name =cdc/&gt;
* [[Intellectual disability]], also (sometimes proscriptively) known as mental retardation,&lt;!--see talk page: there is currently consensus to mention this synonym but need to distinguish it from general DD--&gt; is defined as an IQ below 70 along with limitations in adaptive functioning and onset before the age of 18 years.&lt;ref&gt;DSM-IV - Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 4th Edition, Text Revision, published by the American Psychiatric Association (APA, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The causes of developmental disabilities are varied and remain unknown in a large proportion of cases. Even in cases of known etiology the line between "cause" and "effect" is not always clear, leading to difficulty in categorizing causes.&lt;ref&gt;Improving health outcomes for children and youth with developmental disabilities, A literature review/Surrey Place Services 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetic factors have long been implicated in the causation of developmental disabilities. There is also a large environmental component to these conditions, and the relative contributions of [[nature versus nurture]] have been debated for decades.&lt;ref&gt;Finucane, B.(2012) Introduction to special issue on developmental disabilities. National Society of Genetic Counselors, Inc. 749-751.&lt;/ref&gt;

Current theories on causation focus on genetic factors, and over 1,000 known genetic conditions include developmental disabilities as a symptom.&lt;ref&gt;OMIM (Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man) (2012). Retrieved October 2013 from http://www.omim.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Developmental disabilities affect between 1 and 2% of the population in most western countries, although many government sources acknowledge that statistics are flawed in this area. The worldwide proportion of people with developmental disabilities is believed to be approximately 1.4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inclusion-international.org/en/|title=Enable, Scotland -|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is twice as common in males as in females, and some researchers have found that the prevalence of mild developmental disabilities is likely to be higher in areas of poverty and deprivation, and among people of certain ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archive.official-documents.co.uk/document/cm50/5086/5086.htm |title=Valuing People&amp;nbsp;— A New Strategy for Learning Disability for the 21st Century |page=16 |publisher=Secretary of State (UK) for Health |date=March 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis and quantification==
Developmental disabilities can be initially suspected when a child does not reach expected [[child development stages]]. Subsequently, a [[differential diagnosis]] may be used to diagnose an underlying disease, which may include a [[physical examination]] and [[genetic test]]s.

The degree of disability can be quantified by assigning a ''developmental age'' to a person, which is age of the group into which test scores place the person. This, in turn, can be used to calculate a ''{{visible anchor|developmental quotient}}'' (DQ) as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/medical/developmental%20quotient |title=Definition of DEVELOPMENTAL QUOTIENT |website=[[Merriam-Webster]] Dictionary |publisher= |accessdate=2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/developmental+quotient |title=developmental quotient (DQ) |publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]] |accessdate=2014-11-09}}, in turn citing Mosby's Medical Dictionary, 8th edition.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt; DQ = \frac{Developmental\ age}{Chronological\ age} * 100 &lt;/math&gt;

==Associated issues==

===Physical health issues===
There are many physical [[health]] factors associated with developmental disabilities. For some specific syndromes and diagnoses, these are inherent, such as poor heart function in people with Down syndrome. People with severe [[communication]] difficulties find it difficult to articulate their health needs, and without adequate support and education might not recognize [[illness|ill health]]. [[Epilepsy]], sensory problems (such as poor [[visual perception|vision]] and [[hearing (sense)|hearing]]), [[obesity]] and poor [[oral hygiene|dental health]] are over-represented in this population.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellectualdisability.info/mental_phys_health/health_guide_adlt.htm |title=Health Guidelines for Adults with an Intellectual Disability |publisher=St. George's University of London/Down's Syndrome Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Life expectancy]] among people with developmental disabilities as a group is estimated at 20 years below average, although this is improving with advancements in adaptive and medical technologies, and as people are leading healthier, more fulfilling lives,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nswcid.org.au/systemic/position/health.html |title=Health and People with Intellectual Disability |publisher=NSW Council for Intellectual Disability}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some conditions (such as [[Freeman-Sheldon syndrome]]) do not impact life expectancy.

===Mental health issues (dual diagnoses)===
[[Mental health]] issues, and [[mental illness|psychiatric illnesses]], are more likely to occur in people with developmental disabilities than in the general population. A number of factors are attributed to the high incidence rate of dual diagnoses:
* The high likelihood of encountering [[psychological trauma|traumatic]] events throughout their lifetime (such as abandonment by loved ones, [[abuse]], [[bullying]] and [[harassment]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martorell|first=A.|author2=Tsakanikos E.|title=Traumatic experiences and life events in people with intellectual disability|journal=Current Opinion in Psychiatry|year=2008|volume=21|issue=5|pages=445–448|doi=10.1097/YCO.0b013e328305e60e|pmid=18650684|url=http://journals.lww.com/co-psychiatry/Abstract/2008/09000/Traumatic_experiences_and_life_events_in_people.4.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The social and developmental restrictions placed upon people with developmental disabilities (such as lack of [[education]], [[poverty]], limited [[employment]] opportunities, limited opportunities for fulfilling relationships, boredom)
* Biological factors (such as brain injury, [[epilepsy]], illicit and prescribed drug and alcohol misuse)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chaplin|first=E. |author2=Gilvarry, C. |author3=Tsakanikos E.|title=Recreational substance use patterns in adults with intellectual disability and co-morbid psychopathology|journal=Research in Developmental Disabilities|year=2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=2981–6|doi=10.1016/j.ridd.2011.05.002|pmid=21640553|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0891422211001612}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Developmental factors (such as lack of understanding of [[social norms]] and appropriate behavior, inability of those around to allow/understand expressions of grief and other human [[emotions]])
* External monitoring factor: all people with developmental disabilities that are in a federal- or state-funded residence require the resident to have some form of behavioral monitoring for each person with developmental disability at the residence. With this information psychological diagnoses are more easily given than with the general population that has less consistent monitoring.
* Access to health care providers: in the United States, all people with developmental disabilities that are in a federal- or state-funded residence require the residence to have annual visits to various health care providers. With consistent visits to health care providers more people with developmental disabilities are likely to receive appropriate treatment than the general population that is not required to visit various health care providers.

These problems are exacerbated by difficulties in diagnosis of mental health issues, and in appropriate treatment and medication, as for physical health issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mind.org.uk/Information/Factsheets/Learning+disabilities/#Mental_health_problems|title=Learning Disabilities: Mental Health Problems |publisher=Mind (UK National Association for Mental Health)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.intellectualdisability.info/mental_phys_health/classification_ac.html |title=CLASSIFICATION AND ASSESSMENT OF PSYCHIATRIC DISORDERS IN ADULTS WITH LEARNING [INTELLECTUAL] DISABILITIES |author=Sally-Ann Cooper |publisher=St. George's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Abuse and vulnerability===
[[Abuse]] is a significant issue for people with developmental disabilities, and as a group they are regarded as [[vulnerability|vulnerable]] people in most jurisdictions. Common types of abuse include:
* [[Physical abuse]] (withholding food, hitting, punching, pushing, etc.)
* [[Neglect]] (withholding help when required, e.g., assistance with personal hygiene)
* [[Sexual abuse]] is associated with psychological disturbance. Sequeira, Howlin &amp; Hollins found that sexual abuse was associated with increased rates of mental illness and behavioural problems, including symptoms of post-traumatic stress. Psychological reactions to abuse were similar to those observed in the general population, but with the addition of stereotypical behaviour. The more serious the abuse, the more severe the symptoms that were reported.&lt;ref&gt;Psychological disturbance associated with sexual abuse in people with learning disabilities. Case-control study. / Sequeira, H; Howlin, P; Hollins, S.In: British Journal of Psychiatry, Vol. 183, No. NOV., 11.2003, p. 451–456.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/bjprcpsych/183/5/451.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Psychological or [[emotional abuse]] ([[verbal abuse]], [[shaming]] and belittling)
* Constraint and restrictive practices (turning off an electric wheelchair so a person cannot move)
* [[Financial abuse]] (charging unnecessary fees, holding onto pensions, wages, etc.)
* [[Legal abuse|Legal]] or civil abuse (restricted access to services)
* Systemic abuse (denied access to an appropriate service due to perceived support needs)
* Passive neglect (a caregiver's failure to provide adequate food, shelter)
Lack of education, lack of [[self-esteem]] and self-advocacy skills, lack of understanding of [[social norms]] and appropriate behavior and communication difficulties are strong contributing factors to the high incidence of abuse among this population.

In addition to abuse from people in positions of power, [[peer abuse]] is recognized as a significant, if misunderstood, problem. Rates of criminal offense among people with developmental disabilities are also disproportionately high, and it is widely acknowledged that criminal justice systems throughout the world are ill-equipped for the needs of people with developmental disabilities—as both perpetrators and victims of crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearc.org/faqs/sexualabuse.doc |title=Sexual Abuse FAQ |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ncfv-cnivf/publications/fvmentalhandicap-eng.php |title=Family Violence and People with a Mental Handicap |publisher=Public Health Agency of Canada |work=National Clearinghouse on Family Violence}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thearc.org/faqs/crimjustice.doc |title=Criminal Justice FAQ |publisher=The Arc of the United States |format=DOC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Failings in care have been identified in one in eight deaths of people with learning difficulties under NHS England.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-44001170 Failings in learning disability deaths, report finds] ''[[BBC]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Challenging behavior===
{{Main|Challenging behaviour}}
Some people with developmental disabilities exhibit challenging behavior, defined as "culturally abnormal behaviour(s) of such intensity, frequency or duration that the physical safety of the person or others is placed in serious jeopardy, or behaviour which is likely to seriously limit or deny access to the use of ordinary community facilities".&lt;ref&gt;Emerson, E. 1995. ''Challenging behaviour: analysis and intervention with people with learning difficulties''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; Common types of challenging behavior include self-injurious behavior (such as hitting, headbutting, biting), aggressive behavior (such as hitting others, shouting, screaming, spitting, kicking, swearing, hairpulling), inappropriate sexualized behavior (such as public masturbation or groping), behavior directed at property (such as throwing objects and stealing) and stereotyped behaviors (such as repetitive rocking, [[echolalia]] or elective incontinence). Such behaviors can be assessed to suggest areas of further improvement, using assessment tools such as the [[Nisonger Child Behavior Rating Form (NCBRF)]].

Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities may be caused by a number of factors, including biological (pain, medication, the need for sensory stimulation), social (boredom, seeking social interaction, the need for an element of control, lack of knowledge of community norms, insensitivity of staff and services to the person's wishes and needs), environmental (physical aspects such as noise and lighting, or gaining access to preferred objects or activities), psychological (feeling excluded, lonely, devalued, labelled, disempowered, living up to people's negative expectations) or simply a means of communication. A lot of the time, challenging behavior is learned and brings rewards and it is very often possible to teach people new behaviors to achieve the same aims. Challenging behavior in people with developmental disabilities can often be associated with specific mental health problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hemmings|first=C. |author2=Underwood, L. |author3=Tsakanikos E. |author4=Holt, G. |author5=Bouras, N. |title=Clinical predictors of challenging behaviour in intellectual disability|journal=Social Psychiatry and Psychiatric Epidemiology|year=2008|volume=43|issue=10|pages=824–830|doi=10.1007/s00127-008-0370-9|pmid=18488127|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/v18g5123g4gw6326/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experience and research suggests that what professionals call "challenging behavior" is often a reaction to the challenging environments that those providing services create around people with developmental disabilities. "Challenging behavior" in this context is a method of communicating dissatisfaction with the failure of those providing services to focus on what kind of life makes most sense to the person, and is often the only recourse a developmentally disabled person has against unsatisfactory services or treatment and the lack of opportunities made available to the person. This is especially the case where the services deliver lifestyles and ways of working that are centered on what suits the service provider and its staff, rather than what best suits the person.

In general, behavioral interventions or what has been termed [[applied behavior analysis]] has been found to be effective in reducing specific challenging behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Neef|first= N. A. |year=2001 |title=The Past and Future of Behavior Analysis in Developmental Disabilities: When Good News is Bad and Bad News is Good. ''The Behavior Analyst Today, 2 (4) ' |pages=336–343|url= http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, efforts have been placed on developing a developmental pathway model in the behavior analysis literature to prevent challenging behavior from occurring.&lt;ref&gt;Roane, H.S., Ringdahl, J.E., Vollmer, T.R.,  Whitmarsh, E.L. and  Marcus, B.A. (2007).  A Preliminary Description of the Occurrence of Proto-injurious Behavior in Typically Developing Children. ''Journal of Early and Intensive Behavior Intervention, 3(4),'' 334-347. [http://www.baojournal.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Societal attitudes==
Throughout history, people with developmental disabilities have been viewed as incapable and incompetent in their capacity for decision-making and development. Until the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe, care and asylum was provided by families and the Church (in monasteries and other religious communities), focusing on the provision of [[Maslow's hierarchy|basic physical needs]] such as food, shelter and clothing. Stereotypes such as the dimwitted [[village idiot]],  and potentially harmful characterizations (such as [[demonic possession]] for people with epilepsy) were prominent in social attitudes of the time.

Early in the twentieth century, the [[eugenics]] movement became popular throughout the world. This led to the [[forced sterilization]] and prohibition of marriage in most of the developed world and was later used by [[Hitler]] as rationale for the mass murder of mentally challenged individuals during the [[Holocaust]]. The eugenics movement was later thought to be seriously flawed and in violation of human rights and the practice of forced sterilization and prohibition from marriage was discontinued by most of the developed world by the mid 20th century.

The movement towards individualism in the 18th and 19th centuries, and the opportunities afforded by the [[Industrial Revolution]], led to housing and care using the asylum model. People were placed by, or removed from, their families (usually in infancy) and housed in large institutions (of up to 3,000 people, although some institutions were home to many more, such as the [[Philadelphia State Hospital]] in Pennsylvania which housed 7,000 people through the 1960s), many of which were self-sufficient through the labor of the residents. Some of these institutions provided a very basic level of education (such as differentiation between colors and basic word recognition and numeracy), but most continued to focus solely on the provision of basic needs. Conditions in such institutions varied widely, but the support provided was generally non-individualized, with aberrant behavior and low levels of economic productivity regarded as a burden to society. Heavy tranquilization and assembly line methods of support (such as "birdfeeding" and cattle herding){{clarify|date=November 2015}} were the norm, and the [[medical model of disability]] prevailed. Services were provided based on the relative ease to the provider, not based on the human needs of the individual.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Ignoring the prevailing attitude, [[Civitan International|Civitans]] adopted service to the developmentally disabled as a major organizational emphasis in 1952. Their earliest efforts included workshops for special education teachers and daycamps for disabled children, all at a time when such training and programs were almost nonexistent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Armbrester |first=Margaret E. |title=The Civitan Story |year=1992 |publisher=Ebsco Media |location=Birmingham, AL |pages=74–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the segregation of people with developmental disabilities wasn't widely questioned by academics or policy-makers until the 1969 publication of [[Wolf Wolfensberger]]'s seminal work "The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author=Wolf Wolfensberger |title=The Origin and Nature of Our Institutional Models |url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/lib/docs/1909.htm?page=print |date=January 10, 1969 |publisher=President's Committee on Mental Retardation, Washington, D.C. |work=Changing Patterns in Residential Services for the Mentally Retarded}}&lt;/ref&gt; drawing on some of the ideas proposed by SG Howe 100 years earlier. This book posited that society characterizes people with disabilities as [[deviant]], sub-human and burdens of charity, resulting in the adoption of that "deviant" role. Wolfensberger argued that this dehumanization, and the segregated institutions that result from it, ignored the potential productive contributions that all people can make to society. He pushed for a shift in policy and practice that recognized the human needs of "retardates" and provided the same basic human rights as for the rest of the population.

The publication of this book may be regarded as the first move towards the widespread adoption of the [[social model of disability]] in regard to these types of disabilities, and was the impetus for the development of government strategies for desegregation.{{Citation needed|date=September 2013}}Successful [[lawsuit]]s against governments and an increasing awareness of human rights and self-advocacy also contributed to this process, resulting in the passing in the U.S. of the [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act]] in 1980.

From the 1960s to the present, most U.S. states have moved towards the elimination of segregated institutions. Along with the work of Wolfensberger and others including Gunnar and Rosemary Dybwad,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/beyond-affliction/ba_shows.dir/revoluti.dir/highlights/subject/ng0002tx.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711075247/http://www.disabilitymuseum.org/beyond-affliction/ba_shows.dir/revoluti.dir/highlights/subject/ng0002tx.html |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; a number of scandalous revelations around the horrific conditions within state institutions created public outrage that led to change to a more community-based method of providing services.&lt;ref name=arcmass&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arcmass.org/StateHousePolicy/RegulationandPolicyDebates/FernaldSchoolClosingandRICCIClass/FernaldNews/WhyTheFernaldCenterShouldClose/ChristmasinPurgatoryWillowbrook/tabid/692/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711170039/http://www.arcmass.org/StateHousePolicy/RegulationandPolicyDebates/FernaldSchoolClosingandRICCIClass/FernaldNews/WhyTheFernaldCenterShouldClose/ChristmasinPurgatoryWillowbrook/tabid/692/Default.aspx |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
By the mid-1970s, most governments had committed to de-institutionalization, and had started preparing for the wholesale movement of people into the general community, in line with the principles of [[normalisation (people with disabilities)|normalization]]. In most countries, this was essentially complete by the late 1990s, although the debate over whether or not to close institutions persists in some states, including Massachusetts.&lt;ref name = arcmass/&gt;

Individuals with developmental disabilities are not fully integrated into society.{{citation needed|date=March 2011}} Person Centered Planning and Person Centered Approaches are seen as methods of addressing the continued labeling and exclusion of socially devalued people, such as people with a developmental disability label, encouraging a focus on the person as someone with capacities and gifts, as well as support needs.

==Services and support==
Today, support services are provided by government agencies, [[non-governmental organizations]] and by [[private sector]] providers. Support services address most aspects of life for people with developmental disabilities, and are usually theoretically based in community inclusion, using concepts such as [[social role valorization]] and increased self-determination (using models such as [[Person Centred Planning]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Kormann &amp; Petronko|year=2003|title= Crisis and Revolution in Developmental Disabilities: The Dilemma of Community Based Services. ''The Behavior Analyst Today,  3 (4,'' |pages=434–443 |url=http://www.baojournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Support services are funded through government block funding (paid directly to service providers by the government), through individualized funding packages (paid directly to the individual by the government, specifically for the purchase of services) or privately by the individual (although they may receive certain subsidies or discounts, paid by the government). There also are a number of non-profit agencies dedicated to enriching the lives of people living with developmental disabilities and erasing the barriers they have to being included in their community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.JARC.org|title=Home|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and training===
{{Main|Special education}}
Education and training opportunities for people with developmental disabilities have expanded greatly in recent times, with many governments mandating universal access to educational facilities, and more students moving out of [[special school]]s and into [[mainstreaming in education|mainstream]] classrooms with support.

[[Post-secondary education]] and [[vocational education|vocational training]] is also increasing for people with these types of disabilities, although many programs offer only segregated "access" courses in areas such as [[literacy]], [[numeracy]] and other basic skills. Legislation (such as the UK's [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995]]) requires educational institutions and training providers to make "reasonable adjustments" to curriculum and teaching methods in order to accommodate the learning needs of students with disabilities, wherever possible. There are also some vocational training centers that cater specifically to people with disabilities, providing the skills necessary to work in integrated settings, one of the largest being [[Dale Rogers Training Center]] in [[Oklahoma City]]. (See also [[Intensive interaction]])

===At-home and community support===
Many people with developmental disabilities live in the general community, either with family members, in supervised-group homes or in their own homes (that they rent or own, living alone or with [[flatmate]]s). At-home and community supports range from one-to-one assistance from a support worker with identified aspects of daily living (such as [[budgeting]], [[shopping]] or paying bills) to full 24-hour support (including assistance with household tasks, such as [[cooking]] and [[Housekeeping|cleaning]], and personal care such as showering, dressing and the administration of medication). The need for full 24-hour support is usually associated with difficulties recognizing safety issues (such as responding to a fire or using a telephone) or for people with potentially dangerous medical conditions (such as asthma or diabetes) who are unable to manage their conditions without assistance.

In the [[United States]], a support worker is known as a [[Direct Support Professional]] (DSP). The DSP works in assisting the individual with their ADLs and also acts as an [[advocate]] for the individual with a developmental disability, in communicating their needs, self-expression and [[objective (goal)|goals]].

Supports of this type also include assistance to identify and undertake new hobbies or to access community services (such as education), learning appropriate behavior or recognition of community norms, or with relationships and expanding circles of friends. Most programs offering at-home and community support are designed with the goal of increasing the individual's independence, although it is recognized that people with more severe disabilities may never be able to achieve full independence in some areas of daily life.

===Residential accommodation===

Some people with developmental disabilities live in residential accommodation (also known as '''group homes''') with other people with similar assessed needs. These homes are usually staffed around the clock, and usually house between 3 and 15 residents. The prevalence of this type of support is gradually decreasing, however, as residential accommodation is replaced by at-home and community support, which can offer increased choice and self-determination for individuals. Some U.S. states still provide institutional care, such as the [[Texas State Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dads.state.tx.us/services/stateschools/index.html Texas Department of Aging and Disability Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070206001450/http://www.dads.state.tx.us/services/stateschools/index.html |date=February 6, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The type of residential accommodation is usually determined by the level of developmental disability and mental health needs.&lt;ref&gt;Chaplin, E., Paschos, D. O’Hara, J., McCarthy, J., Holt, G.Bouras, N. Tsakanikos E. (2010). Mental ill-health and care pathways in adults with intellectual disability across different residential settings. Research in Developmental Disabilities, 31, 458-63&lt;/ref&gt;

===Employment support===
Employment support usually consists of two types of support:
* Support to access or participate in integrated employment, in a workplace in the general community. This may include specific programs to increase the skills needed for successful employment (work preparation), one-to-one or small group support for on-the-job training, or one-to-one or small group support after a transition period (such as advocacy when dealing with an employer or a bullying colleague, or assistance to complete an application for a promotion).
* The provision of specific employment opportunities within segregated '''business services'''. Although these are designed as "transitional" services (teaching work skills needed to move into integrated employment), many people remain in such services for the duration of their working life. The types of work performed in business services include mailing and packaging services, cleaning, gardening and landscaping, timberwork, metal fabrication, farming and sewing.

Workers with developmental disabilities have historically been paid less for their labor than those in the general workforce, although this is gradually changing with government initiatives, the enforcement of anti-discrimination legislation and changes in perceptions of capability in the general community.

In the United States, a variety of initiatives have been launched in the past decade to reduce unemployment among workers with disabilities—estimated by researchers at over 60%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Richard Burkhauser |author2=Mary Daly |title=United States Disability Policy in a Changing Environment |journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives  |volume=16 |issue=1 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of these initiatives are directed at employment in mainstream businesses. They include heightened placement efforts by the community agencies serving people with developmental disabilities, as well as by government agencies.

Additionally, state-level initiatives are being launched to increase employment among workers with disabilities. In California, the state senate in 2009 created the Senate Select Committee on Autism and Related Disorders. The Committee has been examining additions to existing community employment services, and also new employment approaches. Committee member Lou Vismara, chairman of the MIND Institute at [[University of California, Davis]], is pursuing the development of a planned community for persons with autism and related disorders in the [[Sacramento]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.disabilityrightsca.org/news/Sacramento_Bee-2009-09-18.htm |title=With Housing that Caters to All, We all Win |publisher=Sacramento Bee |date=2008-09-18 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another committee member, [[Michael S. Bernick|Michael Bernick]], the former director of the state labor department, has established a program at the California state university system, starting at [[California State University East Bay]], to support students with autism on the college level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2009/08/04/EDPN193F67.DTL |title=College for Autistics |publisher=San Francisco Chronicle |date=2009-08-04 |accessdate=2011-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Committee efforts include mutual support employment efforts, such as disability job networks, job boards, and identifying business lines that build on the strengths of persons with disabilities.

===Day services===
Non-vocational day services are usually known as '''day centers''', and are traditionally segregated services offering training in life skills (such as meal preparation and basic literacy), center-based activities (such as crafts, games and music classes) and external activities (such as day trips). Some more progressive day centers also support people to access vocational training opportunities (such as college courses), and offer individualized outreach services (planning and undertaking activities with the individual, with support offered one-to-one or in small groups).

Traditional day centers were based on the principles of [[occupational therapy]], and were created as [[respite care|respite]] for family members caring for their loved ones with disabilities. This is slowly changing, however, as programs offered become more skills-based and focused on increasing independence.

===Advocacy===
[[Advocacy]] is a burgeoning support field for people with developmental disabilities. Advocacy groups now exist in most jurisdictions, working collaboratively with people with disabilities for systemic change (such as changes in policy and legislation) and for changes for individuals (such as claiming welfare benefits or when responding to abuse). Most advocacy groups also work to support people, throughout the world, to increase their capacity for [[self-advocacy]], teaching the skills necessary for people to advocate for their own needs.

===Other types of support===
Other types of support for people with developmental disabilities may include:
* therapeutic services, such as speech therapy, occupational therapy, physical therapy, massage, aromatherapy, art, dance/movement or music therapy
* supported holidays
* short-stay respite services (for people who live with family members or other unpaid carers)
* transport services, such as dial-a-ride or free bus passes
* specialist behavior support services, such as high-security services for people with high-level, high-risk challenging behaviors
* specialist relationships and sex education

Programs are set up around the country in hopes to educate individuals with and without developmental disabilities. Studies have been done testing specific scenarios on how what is the most beneficial way to educate people. Interventions are a great way to educate people, but also the most time consuming. With the busy schedules that everybody has, it is found to be difficult to go about the intervention approach. Another scenario that was found to be not as beneficial, but more realistic in the time sense was Psychoeducational approach. They focus on informing people on what abuse is, how to spot abuse, and what to do when spotted. Individuals with developmental disabilities don't only need the support programs to keep them safe, but everybody in society needs to be aware of what is happening and how to help everybody prosper.&lt;ref&gt;Lund, Emily, and Marilyn Hammond. “Single-Session Intervention for Abuse Awareness Among
People with Developmental Disabilities.” Sexuality and Disability 32.1 (n.d.): 99-105. Proquest Central. Web. 24 Apr. 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Force-field analysis''' is a development in social science. It provides a framework for looking at the factors (''forces'') that influence a situation, originally social situations. It looks at forces that are either driving movement toward a goal (helping forces) or blocking movement toward a goal (hindering forces). The principle, developed by [[Kurt Lewin]], is a significant contribution to the fields of [[social science]], [[psychology]], [[social psychology]], [[community psychology]], [[Communication studies|communication]], [[organizational development]], [[process management]], and [[change management]].

==History==
Lewin, a social psychologist, believed the "field" to be a [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] psychological environment existing in an individual's (or in the collective group) mind at a certain point in time that can be mathematically described in a [[topological]] constellation of constructs. The "field" is very dynamic, changing with time and experience. When fully constructed, an individual's "field" (Lewin used the term "life space") describes that person's motives, values, needs, moods, goals, anxieties, and ideals. 

Lewin believed that changes of an individual's "life space" depend upon that individual's internalization of external stimuli (from the physical and social world) into the "life space". Although Lewin did not use the word "experiential" (see [[experiential learning]]), he nonetheless believed that interaction (experience) of the "life space" with "external stimuli" (at what he calls the "boundary zone") were important for development (or regression). For Lewin, development (or regression) of an individual occurs when their "life space" has a "boundary zone" experience with external stimuli. Note, it is not merely the experience that causes change in the "life space", but the acceptance (internalization) of external stimuli.

Lewin took these same principles and applied them to the analysis of [[group conflict]], [[learning]], [[adolescence]], [[hatred]], [[morale]], German society, etc. This approach allowed him to break down common misconceptions of these social phenomena, and to determine their basic elemental constructs. He used theory, mathematics, and common sense to define a force field, and hence to determine the causes of human and group behavior.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2300">The '''Glasgow Chronology''' is a proposed revision of the [[Egyptian chronology]] of [[ancient Egypt]]. It was first formulated between the years 1978 and 1982 by a working group following the Glasgow Conference of Society for Interdisciplinary Studies (SIS, a non-profit organization advocating serious academic analysis of the writings of [[Immanuel Velikovsky]] and other [[catastrophism|catastrophist]]s).&lt;ref name=Sweeney&gt;{{cite book|title=Empire of Thebes, or, Ages in chaos revisited|author=Emmet John Sweeney|pages=19|publisher=Algora Publishing|year=2007| isbn=9780875864808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This [[chronology]] placed the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt]] some five hundred years later than the [[conventional chronology of Egypt]].

==Chronology formation==
The Glasgow Chronology was initially presented at an SIS conference, held in 1978 in [[Glasgow]] and entitled "Ages in Chaos?". Flaws were pointed out in it almost immediately, and by the 1980s its original proponents had all abandoned it, in favour of other chronologies.&lt;ref name=Sweeney /&gt;

The Glasgow Chronology accepted all the character identifications proposed by [[Velikovsky]] in ''[[Ages in Chaos]]'' (1952). Thus [[Hatshepsut]], who visited the Divine Land, was equated with the [[Queen of Sheba]], who visited [[Solomon]] in [[Jerusalem]], whilst [[Thutmose III]], who followed Hatshepsut, was equated with [[Shishak]], who plundered the Jerusalem temple after the death of Solomon. Velikovsky therefore reduced the age of the [[Eighteenth Dynasty]] by five centuries. However, in his subsequently published ''Ramses II and his Time'' (1978), he brought the Nineteenth dynasty down by roughly seven centuries, thus opening a two-century gap between the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. Despite the Glasgow Chronology intent of reducing the age of the Nineteenth dynasty by five centuries and allowing it to naturally follow from the Eighteenth dynasty, its original proponents concluded that it was historically insupportable.

'''''Glittering Images: A Journey Through Art from Egypt to Star Wars''''' is a 2012 book by American cultural critic [[Camille Paglia]], in which the author discusses notable works of [[Applied arts|applied]] and [[Visual arts|visual art]] from ancient to modern times. Paglia wrote that she intended it to be a personalized "journey" through [[art history]], focusing on [[Western world|Western]] works. Paglia writes that she felt inspired to write given that she worries 21st century Americans are overexposed to visual stimulation by the "all-pervasive mass media" and must fight to keep their capacity for [[contemplation]].&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

The book features twenty-nine sections, with glossy full-color illustrations, each focused on a specific piece.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Artists detailed include [[Titian]], [[Manet]], [[Picasso]], and [[Jackson Pollock]] among others. After its October 16, 2012 release, the book received positive reviews from publications such as ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' and ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'',&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;&lt;ref name=inquirer&gt;{{cite news|last=Derakhshani|first=Tirdad|title=Camille Paglia hopes to reignite regular folks' interest in the arts|url=http://articles.philly.com/2012-10-17/entertainment/34500629_1_camille-paglia-sexual-personae-western-art|date=October 17, 2012|publisher=''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; while it also picked up more critical, negative reviews from publications such as ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]''.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt;

==Summary==
[[File:Charioteer of Delphi-2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia discusses the [[Charioteer of Delphi]], a notable [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] work.&lt;ref name=delphi/&gt;]]

While touching on the themes of Paglia's previous work, ''Glittering Images'' focuses on modern cultural [[ignorance]].&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt; Paglia wrote what she intended as a personalized "journey" through art history since she believes people today have become visually overexposed by the mass-media and disconnected from the past.&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; In it, she argues, "the eye is assaulted, coerced, desensitized."&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

Paglia discusses twenty-nine examples of visual artwork. Paglia begins by describing the [[ancient Egypt]]ian funerary images of [[Nefertari (18th dynasty)|Queen Nefertari]],&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; a royal whose name means "the most beautiful of them all". Paglia refers to how the civilization "dreamed of conquering the terrors of death", and she notes how "Egyptian painted figures float in an abstract space that is neither here nor there", describing the visual power of this "eternal present" depicted.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.3-5&lt;/ref&gt; She then turns to the [[Cycladic civilization|Cycladic]] statuettes carved by [[Bronze Age]] residents of several [[Aegean Sea]] islands, which feature "coolly geometric" designs unlike that of the voluptuous figures carved by earlier, [[Stone Age]] people (such as the '[[Venus of Willendorf]]') while still displaying [[vulva]]e markings and prominent breasts that convey femininity. These pieces of [[Cycladic art]] are cited as "daring explorations of form and structure" foreshadowing the future.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.11-13&lt;/ref&gt;

The author then describes the '[[Charioteer of Delphi]]', a work from the fifth century BC that she writes embodies well the [[Ancient Greece|ancient Greek]] ideals of "young male beauty" and the building of character through personal striving. She states how she finds the chariot racing athlete "grave and dignified" with his meditative expression, giving a "look that would become canonical for gods and heroes in the classic tradition".&lt;ref name=delphi&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.15-18&lt;/ref&gt; She goes on to write about the '[[Erechtheion#The Porch of the Caryatids|Porch of the Maidens]]' in the [[Erechtheion]] in [[Athens, Greece]], with columns carved into feminine shapes that she labels as "a remarkable display of female power" as "muscular strength" co-exists with womanly curves,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.21&lt;/ref&gt; and then the piece '[[Laocoön and His Sons]]', a violent scene carved in marble in which [[sea serpent]]s attempt to slay a man and his three sons that stridently addresses the problem of [[theodicy]].&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.27&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:KellsFol007vMadonnaChild V2.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Paglia praises the intricacy of the [[Book of Kells]], the section devoted to [[Virgin Mary]] pictured here.&lt;ref name=kells/&gt;]]

The book goes on next to the famous [[mosaic]] of [[Saint John Chrysostom]] in the [[Hagia Sophia]], a piece that Paglia writes as having an "implacable intensity of gaze" making it a great piece of [[Byzantine art]],&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.36-37&lt;/ref&gt; and additionally to the late eighth century Ireland's [[Book of Kells]], an "intricately decorated manuscript of the Gospels that is one of the most beautiful objects surviving from medieval Europe."&lt;ref name=kells&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.39&lt;/ref&gt; The eight piece included is [[Donatello]]'s '[[Mary Magdalene (Donatello)|Mary Magdalene]]', a work of the [[Italian Renaissance]] created in 1453 that showed the artist's ability to be "harsh and imposing".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.43&lt;/ref&gt; Paglia then discusses [[Titian]]'s '[[Venus with a Mirror]]'; she writes about the artistic changes it symbolizes as the strong brushwork and liberal use of paint allow for warm flesh tones, Titian creating "opulent nudes that thrust sexual display and fantasy" onto the viewer.&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.49&lt;/ref&gt;

Paglia next discusses [[Bronzino]]'s 'Portrait of Andrea Doria as Neptune', writing that as a work of the [[Mannerism]] movement it shows a "polished theatricality" arresting to the viewer,&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.53&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gian Lorenzo Bernini]]'s '[[Chair of Saint Peter]]' in the [[Vatican City]], a 17th-century work showing how [[Baroque art]] often "overwhelms the senses with flamboyant grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;''Glittering Images'', pp.59&lt;/ref&gt;

She takes a nuanced view of the lasting influence of [[pop art]], writing that, generally, the artistic movement "projects an innocent child’s view of the world."&lt;ref name="on-art"/&gt; She also argues that works by artists such as [[Andy Warhol]], whom she praises, conveyed powerful subtleties with their pieces. The book details '[[Marilyn Diptych]]', a 1962 silkscreen that replicates a photo of [[Marilyn Monroe]] over and over with image variations, and the work is lauded for strongly showing the "multiplicity of meanings" in the actress' life and legacy.&lt;ref name=WSJ1/&gt;

The book additionally cites [[Eleanor Antin]]'s [[conceptual art]] project '100 Boots'. Paglia praises the work, writing that "boots, like their creator, are outsiders, eternal migrants questing for knowledge and experience."&lt;ref name=roth/&gt;

==Reception==
Writer John Adams of ''[[The New York Times Book Review]]'' published a critical review of the book, viewing it as being "so agenda driven and so riddled with polemic asides that its potential to persuade is forever being compromised." Adams noted that the book avoided discussions of [[Giotto]], [[Michelangelo]], [[El Greco]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Johannes Vermeer|Vermeer]], and [[Vincent van Gogh|van Gogh]], which he criticized. He supported how Paglia "encourages us to read more closely and to look more imaginatively" at the world of [[art history]], though concluded that her praise of [[George Lucas]] was assessing art "by its reach rather than its depth", and thus Paglia "has journeyed to the wrong continent, and what she has found glittering there is fool's gold."&lt;ref name="on-art"&gt;{{cite news|last=Adams|first=John|title=Paglia on Art|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/02/books/review/glittering-images-by-camille-paglia.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|date=November 30, 2012|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=July 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalist Gary Rosen of ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'', however, praised the book's "impressive range" and accessibility for a general audience. He argued that "[f]or the most part, Ms. Paglia chooses well, from works both celebrated and obscure", and he stated that the author "is especially good at the difficult trick of providing context for the newcomer to art history without being tedious for a more experienced reader."&lt;ref name=WSJ1&gt;{{cite news|last=Rosen|first=Gary|title=The Pagan Aesthetic|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10000872396390443675404578058504002593338|publisher=''[[The Wall Street Journal]]''|accessdate=July 17, 2014|date=October 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, ''[[The Philadelphia Inquirer]]'' ran a supportive article that labeled the book a "magisterial, poetically composed, and masterly study".&lt;ref name=inquirer/&gt;

The ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' published a supportive review by [[Michael S. Roth]], an author and the president of [[Wesleyan University]]. He wrote, "Artists, questing outsiders, are still with us, still finding their way, making their way. Perhaps some of them will be inspired by the glittering images Camille Paglia offers here."&lt;ref name=roth&gt;{{cite news|author=[[Michael S.

Early systematic human [[dissection]]s were carried out by the [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] physicians [[Herophilos|Herophilus of Chalcedon]] and [[Erasistratus of Chios]] in the early part of the third century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Von Staden |first1=H |title=The discovery of the body: human dissection and its cultural contexts in ancient Greece |journal=The Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=223–41 |year=1992 |pmid=1285450 |pmc=2589595}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first physician known to have made [[Autopsy|postmortem]] [[dissection]]s was the [[Arab]]ian physician [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]] (1091–1161).  [[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821–1902) is generally recognized to be the father of microscopic pathology.  Most early pathologists were also practicing [[physician]]s or [[surgeon]]s.also see Egyptian mummification as pre modern necropsy might suggest as early embalming and post mortem organ removal.

==Origins of pathology==
Early understanding of the origins of diseases constitutes the earliest application of the [[scientific method]] to the field of [[medicine]], a development which occurred in the [[Middle East]] during the [[Islamic Golden Age]]&lt;ref&gt;Toby E. Huff (2003), ''The Rise of Early Modern Science: Islam, China, and the West'', p. 54, 246-247, 216-218. [[Cambridge University Press]], {{ISBN|0-521-52994-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Western Europe]] during the [[Italian Renaissance]].&lt;ref name="Histpath"&gt;[http://www.usc.edu/hsc/dental/PTHL312abc/312a/01/Reader/reader_set.html] History of Pathology, at the USC School of Dentistry&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] physician [[Hippocrates]], the founder of scientific medicine, was the first to deal with the anatomy and the pathology of human spine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.lww.com/spinejournal/pages/articleviewer.aspx?year=1999&amp;issue=07010&amp;article=00018&amp;type=abstract Hippocrates: The Father of Spine Surgery : Spine]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Galen]] developed an interest in anatomy from his studies of [[Herophilus]] and [[Erasistratus]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nlm.nih.gov/hmd/greek/greek_galen.html Greek Medicine - Galen]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of studying disease through the methodical dissection and examination of diseased bodies, organs, and tissues may seem obvious today, but there are few if any recorded examples of true [[autopsies]] performed prior to the [[2nd millennium|second millennium]]. Though the pathology of [[Infectious disease|contagion]] was understood by [[Islamic medicine|Muslim physicians]] since the time of [[Avicenna]] (980–1037) who described it in ''[[The Canon of Medicine]]'' (c. 1020),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookrags.com/history/islam-science-technology-health/sub12.html Medicine And Health], "Rise and Spread of Islam 622-1500: Science, Technology, Health", ''World Eras'', [[Thomson Gale]].&lt;/ref&gt; the first physician known to have made [[Autopsy|postmortem]] [[dissection]]s was the [[Arab]]ian physician [[Ibn Zuhr|Avenzoar]] (1091–1161) who proved that the skin disease [[scabies]] was caused by a [[parasite]], followed by [[Ibn al-Nafis]] (b. 1213) who used dissection to discover [[pulmonary circulation]] in 1242.&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Islamic+medicine Islamic medicine], ''[[Hutchinson Encyclopedia]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 15th century, anatomic dissection was repeatedly used by the Italian physician [[Antonio Benivieni]] (1443-1502) to determine cause of death.&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt; Antonio Benivieni is also credited with having introduced necropsy to the medical field.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin's Pathology, Fifth Edition.  2008.   Ed. R. Rubin and D.S. Strayer&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps the most famous early gross pathologist was [[Giovanni Battista Morgagni|Giovanni Morgagni]] (1682-1771). His [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], ''De Sedibus et Causis Morborum per Anatomem Indagatis'', published in 1761, describes the findings of over 600 partial and complete autopsies, organised anatomically and methodically correlated with the symptoms exhibited by the patients prior to their demise. Although the study of normal anatomy was already well advanced at this date, ''De Sedibus'' was one of the first treatises specifically devoted to the correlation of diseased anatomy with clinical illness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pacs.unica.it/biblio/lesson6.htm] A History of Medicine from the Biblioteca Centrale dell'Area Biomedica&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morgagni |first1=GB |title=Founders of Modern Medicine: Giovanni Battista Morgagni. (1682-1771) |journal=Medical library and historical journal |volume=1 |issue=4 |pages=270–7 |year=1903 |pmid=18340813 |pmc=1698114}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the late 1800s, an exhaustive body of literature had been produced on the gross anatomical findings characteristic of known diseases. The extent of gross pathology research in this period can be epitomized by the work of the Viennese pathologist (originally from Hradec Kralove in the Czech Rep.) [[Carl Rokitansky]] (1804-1878), who is said to have performed 20,000 autopsies, and supervised an additional 60,000, in his lifetime.&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/981.html] Karl von Rokitansky at Whonamedit.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins of microscopic pathology==
[[Rudolf Virchow]] (1821-1902) is generally recognized to be the father of microscopic pathology. While the compound [[microscope]] had been invented approximately 150 years prior, Virchow was one of the first prominent physicians to emphasize the study of manifestations of disease which were visible only at the cellular level.&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/912.html] Rudolf Virchow at Whonamedit.com&lt;/ref&gt; A student of Virchow's, [[Julius Cohnheim]] (1839-1884) combined [[histology]] techniques with experimental manipulations to study [[inflammation]], making him one of the earliest [[experimental pathology|experimental pathologists]].&lt;ref name="Histpath"/&gt; Cohnheim also pioneered the use of the [[frozen section procedure]]; a version of this technique is widely employed by modern pathologists to render diagnoses and provide other clinical information intraoperatively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=660&amp;letter=C&amp;search=Julius%20Cohnheim] Jewish Encyclopedia entry on Julius Cohnheim&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern experimental pathology==
As new research techniques, such as [[electron microscopy]], [[immunohistochemistry]], and [[molecular biology]] have expanded the means by which biomedical scientists can study disease, the definition and boundaries of investigative pathology have become less distinct. In the broadest sense, nearly all research which links manifestations of disease to identifiable processes in cells, tissues, or organs can be considered [[experimental pathology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asip.org/about/about.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-04-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512043556/http://www.asip.org/about/about.htm |archivedate=2008-05-12 |df= }} Mission of the American Society for Investigative Pathology&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Issue advocacy ads''' (also known as '''interest advocacy ads''' or '''issue only ads''') are communications intended to bring awareness to a certain problem.  Groups that sponsor this form of communication are known by several names including: [[Advocacy group|interest advocacy group, issue advocacy group, issue only group, or special interest group]].  The problems these groups raise awareness of can be either a social or political issue.

==Interest versus express advocacy==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
The bright-line test doesn't cover forms of communication that are indirect or debatable.  Consider this message to voters:

*''If you like candidate X, you need to know he did Y.''

In a communication like this, there is no mention about voting, however, the plain intention is to cast doubt on voters that supported candidate X.  

Campaigning like this is typically called [[negative campaigning]], making attack ads, or making thinly veiled promotional ads on the behalf of the candidate.

===Interest advocacy===
Interest advocacy is the act of making generalized communication regarding a public issue or problem without advocating voters to take a specific action at the election booth.&lt;ref name="moritz"&gt;[http://moritzlaw.osu.edu/electionlaw/ebook/part3/campaign_finance_fed_glossary.html by Michelle Robinson, Section 3.1 - Campaign finance, Subsection 3.1.1 Federal law, Glossary of term, Michael E. Moritz College of Law, Ohio State University, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

Identification of a pure "issue only ads" made by interest advocacy groups is difficult.  Groups that sponsored messages needed to make it clear, to a voter with [[reasonable person|reasonable intelligence]], that the voter should cast their ballot in a manner the group wanted.

Keeping an advertisement issue important to only groups like [[501(c)(3)]] non-profits. They were subject to limits or absolute prohibitions on engaging in political activities. Organizations can participate in nonpartisan voter education efforts, including registration and "get-out-the-vote" drives and issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="Elacqua"&gt;[http://www.hbtlj.org/v08p1/v08p1elacquaar.pdf Eyes wide shut: The ambiguous "political activity" prohibition and its effects on 501(c)(3) organizations, Houston Business and Tax Journal, by Amelia Elacqua, 2008, p. 118, 119 and 141, referenced February 16, 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Express advocacy===
{{refimprove section|date=March 2016}}
Express advocacy is largely used in connection with a debate in the US regarding when issue advocacy turns into [[political campaign|campaigning]]. 

Many groups that made what appeared to most to be campaign advertisements claimed that their communications to voters were really issue advocacy and not express advocacy. To help understand the difference, examine these two communications to voters: 

*''Select John Smith.''
*''Vote no! on Proposition 99.''

In both examples the message's intention is clear. Using a standard that looks for specific words or phrases in a communication is called conducting a [[bright-line]] test. Bright-line is a standard if there is no mistake.  One or more of the "[[Eight Magic Words]]" or their {{clarify|reason=definition?|text=equivalents|date=March 2016}} is present or not present.  

Express advocacy is associated with [[independent expenditure]]s.

===History===
In the 1970s, changes to regulations permitted non-candidate organizations to make [[independent expenditure]]s and use their money in election season. They could neither give it directly to a candidate nor make advertisement on a candidates behalf.  Typical expenditures were described as being "party building" and [[get out the vote]] campaigns. Organizations, especially non-profits were supposed to do it on a [[nonpartisan]] basis. However, groups tended to focus efforts on signing up and getting the type of voters to the polls that were most likely to hold similar views.

The only barrier stopping a group from campaigning directly for their favorite candidate or cause was something called the "reasonable person" test: if a reasonable person, viewing the communication, comes to the conclusion the sponsor wants them to vote in one way, it is express advocacy, not interest advocacy.&lt;ref name="BlueRibbon"&gt;[http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm Governor’s Blue-Ribbon Commission on campaign finance reform for State of Wisconsin, Final Report, Section 5. Level the playing field, Promoting freedom of speech, paragraph 3-6, Chairman Donald F. Kettl, May 1997] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111209063419/http://www.lafollette.wisc.edu/campaign_reform/final.htm |date=2011-12-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

One problem with the reasonable person test is it is not definitive or a [[bright-line rule]].  There was no clear line that clearly stated if you cross this point you are on the wrong side. In an attempt to help the situation, in 1976 a footnote was included in a US Supreme Court ruling provided eight examples.&lt;ref name="BuckleyValeo"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Buckley v. Valeo |last=Smith |first=Craig R. |title=Free Speech on Trial: Communication Perspectives on Landmark Supreme Court Decisions |editor=Parker, Richard A. (ed.) |year=2003 |publisher=University of Alabama Press |location=Tuscaloosa, AL |isbn=0-8173-1301-X |pages=203&amp;ndash;217}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

However, rather than using them as examples, many found it easier to just leave out the "magic words" and claim their communications to voters were fine. By 1996, interest advocacy groups were spending millions of dollars on campaigns claiming their advertisements were "issue only" since they left out the "magic words."

By 2000, voters were inundated with $500 million worth of this type of advertisement.&lt;ref name="GWU"&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~smpa/faculty/documents/Swift_Boat_Article_FALR_000.pdf Swift boat Vets in 2004: Press coverage of an independent campaign, First Amendment Law Review, University of North Carolina School of Law, Vol. 4, 2005, by Albert L. May, July 29, 2004]&lt;/ref&gt; Owing to the "shame issue ads," scandals, and the amount of spending, Congress held a congressional investigation.  It reinvigorated campaign finance reform, and led to the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act]] in 2002, which is more commonly known as McCain-Feingold.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|75}}

In 2003, in ''[[McConnell v. Federal Election Commission]]'', the Court detailed the difference between interest versus express advocacy. It ruled looking for [[Eight Magic Words|"magic words"]] as "functionally meaningless" since an advertiser can communicate its intention to voters without them.&lt;ref name="GWU" /&gt;{{RP|15}} Therefore, instead of looking for words, the Court again ruled that if a communication to voters had  "no reasonable interpretation other than as an appeal to vote for, or against, a specific candidate," it is "the functional equivalent of express advocacy."&lt;ref name="GSUlaw"&gt;[http://ssrn.com/abstract=1878727 Has the tide turned in favor of disclosure? Revealing money in politics after Citizens United and Doe v. Reed, by Ciara Torres-Spelliscy, Georgia State University Law Review, Vol. 27, No. 4, 2011, July 4, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;{{RP|1092}}

In the [[United States presidential election, 2004]], "issue only" ads continued and some famous ones were made by a group called [[Swift Vets and POWs for Truth|Swift Boat]].  They claimed their advertisements were issue only ads, not express advocacy. According to at least one analyst, voters voted exactly how the sponsors intended and the advertisements "torpedoed" [[Massachusetts]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[John Kerry presidential campaign, 2004]].&lt;ref name="HuffPost"&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/07/29/wyly-brothers-republican-campaign-donations_n_664550.html "Wyly Brothers Gave Millions To Over 200 Republican Candidates"], ''The Huffington Post'', Marcus Baram, July 30, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, a [[political action committee]] [[Progress of America]], ran an advertisement that showed the horrors of terrorism and stated that [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Al-Qaeda]] want to kill American citizens. At the end, ot asked, "Would you trust Kerry against these killers?" "George Bush did not start this War, but he will end it." The "magic words" are missing.  

In 2007, the US [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in ''[[Federal Election Commission v. Wisconsin Right to Life, Inc.]]'' ruled that issue ads may not be banned from the months preceding a primary or general election. The test to tell the difference between interest and express advocacy remained the [[reasonable person]] test.

However, that is said to have created a difficulty. A test that requires someone to consider how a [[reasonable person]] views a communication to voters requires someone to decide. The only definitive answer comes from a judge and that takes time. Election commissions are not judges, but they can issue [[advisory opinion]] on the matter. That led to a concern that in federal elections, that officials at the [[Federal Election Commission]] and state-level commissions would have to do work. Anyone cautious, wanting to make sure the communication to voters, was interest and not express advocacy would contact it for an opinion.  Communications to voters covers a wide range of areas including advertisements, e-mails, signs, and even speeches on the pulpit might want to ask someone.  

To resolve this issue, the [[US Supreme Court]] looked back at a prior ruling. In 1976, in ''[[Buckley v. Valeo]]'', the Supreme Court held that one thing of key importance was protecting free speech. 

In 2010, ''[[Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission]]''  determined, among other things, that it would be basically not possible for the federal government to be in the business of determining what does and does not constitute issue advocacy or express advocacy.

==Disclosure requirements==
In 2010, ''Citizens United'' "expressly rejected the contention that election-law disclosure requirements are limited to express
advocacy or its functional equivalent." While it and a subsequent case affected certain spending limitations, it did not permit those making the spending from evading disclosure requirements by claiming they were performing issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1091-1092}}

Also in 2010 in a case known as ''[[Doe v. Reed]]'', the Supreme Court rejected an appeal to keep signatures upon a referendum from voters, based upon a claim it violated the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].

Lower courts are already applying these new standards to uphold a gamut of state disclosure laws ranging from ballot measures to candidate elections, and from express advocacy to issue advocacy.&lt;ref name="GSUlaw" /&gt;{{RP|1103}}

'''Iterative design''' is a [[design]] methodology based on a cyclic process of [[prototyping]], [[Product testing|testing]], analyzing, and refining a product or process.  Based on the results of testing the most recent iteration of a design, changes and refinements are made.  This process is intended to ultimately improve the quality and functionality of a design.  In iterative design, interaction with the designed system is used as a form of research for informing and evolving a project, as successive versions, or iterations of a design are implemented.

==Iterative design process==
The iterative design process may be applied throughout the [[new product development]] process.  However, changes are easiest and less expensive to implement in the earliest stages of development.  The first step in the iterative design process is to develop a [[prototype]].  The prototype should be evaluated by a [[focus group]] or a group not associated with the product in order to deliver non-biased opinions.  Information from the focus group should be synthesized and incorporated into the next iteration of the design.  The process should be repeated until user issues have been reduced to an acceptable level.

===Application: Human computer interfaces===
Iterative design is commonly used in the development of human computer interfaces.  This allows designers to identify any usability issues that may arise in the user interface before it is put into wide use.  Even the best usability experts cannot design perfect user interfaces in a single attempt, so a usability engineering lifecycle should be built around the concept of iteration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Iterative User Interface Design | year = 1993 | author = Nielsen, J. | journal = IEEE Computer  vol.26 no.11 pp 32-41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical steps of iterative design in user interfaces are as follows:

# Complete an initial interface design
# Present the design to several test users
# Note any problems had by the test user
# Refine interface to account for/fix the problems
# Repeat steps 2-4 until user interface problems are resolved

Iterative design in user interfaces can be implemented in many ways.  One common method of using iterative design in computer software is [[software testing]].  While this includes testing the product for functionality outside of the user interface, important feedback on the interface can be gained from subject testing early versions of a program.  This allows software companies to release a better quality product to the public, and prevents the need of product modification following its release.

Iterative design in online (website) interfaces is a more continual process, as website modification, after it has been released to the user, is far more viable than in software design.  Often websites use their users as test subjects for interface design, making modifications based on recommendations from visitors to their sites.

==Iterative design use==
Iterative design is a way of confronting the reality of unpredictable user needs and behaviors that can lead to sweeping and fundamental changes in a design. User testing will often show that even carefully evaluated ideas will be inadequate when confronted with a user test. Thus, it is important that the flexibility of the iterative design’s implementation approach extends as far into the system as possible. Designers must further recognize that user testing results may suggest radical change that requires the designers to be prepared to completely abandon old ideas in favor of new ideas that are more equipped to suit user needs. Iterative design applies in many fields, from making knives to rockets. As an example consider the design of an [[electronic circuit]] that must perform a certain task, and must ultimately fit in a small space on a [[circuit board]]. It is useful to split these independent tasks into two smaller and simpler tasks, the functionality task, and the space and weight task. A [[breadboard]] is a useful way of implementing the electronic circuit on an interim basis, without having to worry about space and weight.

Once the circuit works, improvements or incremental changes may be applied to the breadboard to increase or improve functionality over the original design.  When the design is finalized, one can set about designing a proper circuit board meeting the space and weight criteria.  Compacting the circuit on the circuit board requires that the wires and components be juggled around without changing their electrical characteristics.  This juggling follows simpler rules than the design of the circuit itself, and is often [[Place and route|automated]]. As far as possible [[Commercial off-the-shelf|off the shelf]] components are used, but where necessary for space or performance reasons, custom made components may be developed.

Several instances of iterative design are as follows:

*'''Wiki''': A [[wiki]] is a natural repository for iterative design.  The 'Page History' facility allows tracking back to prior versions.  Modifications are mostly incremental, and leave substantial parts of the text unchanged.
*'''Common law''': The principle of [[legal precedent]] builds on past experience.  This makes law a form of iterative design where there should be a clear [[audit trail]] of the development of legal thought.
*'''Evolution''': There is a parallel between iterative and the theory of [[natural Selection]].  Both involve a trial and error process in which the most suitable design advances to the next generation, while less suitable designs perish by the wayside.  Subsequent versions of a product should also get progressively better as its producers learn what works and what doesn't in a process of refinement and [[Continual improvement process|continual improvement]].

==Fast prototyping tools==
One approach to iterative design is to use the highest level of abstraction for developing an early generation product. The principle here is that rapid development may not produce efficient code, but obtaining feedback is more important that technology optimization. Examples of this approach include use of non-functional code, object databases, or low code platforms - these allow quick testing of designs before issues of optimization are addressed.

==Benefits==
When properly applied, iterative design will ensure a product or process is the best solution possible.  When applied early in the development stage, significant cost savings are possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title=Cost/Benefit Analysis for incorporating human factors in the software lifecycle | date = April 1988 | author = Marilyn Mantei; Toby Teorey  | journal = Publications of the ACM  vol.31 no.4 pp 428-439}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other benefits to iterative design include:
# Serious misunderstandings are made evident early in the lifecycle, when it's possible to react to them.
# It enables and encourages user feedback, so as to elicit the system's real requirements.
# Where the work is contracted, Iterative Design provides an incremental method for more effectively involving the client in the complexities that often surround the design process.
# The development team is forced to focus on those issues that are most critical to the project, and team members are shielded from those issues that distract and divert them from the project's real risks.
# Continual testing enables an objective assessment of the project's status.
# Inconsistencies among requirements, designs, and implementations are detected early.
# The workload of the team, especially the testing team, is spread out more evenly throughout the lifecycle.
# This approach enables the team to leverage lessons learned, and therefore to continually improve the process.
# Stakeholders in the project can be given concrete evidence of the project's status throughout the lifecycle.

==Marshmallow Challenge==
[[File:Marshmallow_Challenge.jpg|thumb|Marshmallow challenge winning work.]]
The Marshmallow Challenge is an instructive design challenge. It involves the task of constructing the highest possible free-standing structure with a marshmallow on top. The structure must be completed within 18 minutes using only 20 sticks of spaghetti, one yard of tape, and one yard of string.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marshmallowchallenge.com/Welcome.html |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=The Marshmallow Challenge |date= |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bpwrap1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpwrap.com/2010/04/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |location=CA |publisher=BPWrap |date=2010-04-22 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Observation and studies of participants show that kindergartners are regularly able to build higher structures, in comparison to groups of business school graduates. This is explained by the tendency for children to at once stick the marshmallow on top of a simple structure, test the prototype, and continue to improve upon it. Whereas, business school students tend to spend time vying for power, planning, and finally producing a structure to which the marshmallow is added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jerz |first=Dennis G. |url=http://jerz.setonhill.edu/weblog/2010/05/the_marshmallow_challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge - Jerz's Literacy Weblog |publisher=Jerz.setonhill.edu |date=2010-05-10 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The challenge was invented by Peter Skillman of [[Palm, Inc.]] and popularized by Tom Wujec of [[Autodesk]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cameron |first=Chris |url=http://www.readwriteweb.com/start/2010/04/marshmallows-and-spaghetti-how-kindergartners-think-like-lean-startups.php |title=Marshmallows and Spaghetti: How Kindergartners Think Like Lean Startups |publisher=Readwriteweb.com |date=2010-04-23 |accessdate=2010-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://engineeringrevision.com/302/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Engineeringrevision.com |date=2010-05-02 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.selfishprogramming.com/2010/04/28/the-marshmallow-challenge/ |title=The Marshmallow Challenge |publisher=Selfish Programming |date= |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713002340/http://www.ideasforideas.com/content/marshmallow-challenge|date=July 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ucalgary.ca/science/node/1578 |title=Marshmallow challenge &amp;#124; Faculty of Science &amp;#124; University of Calgary |publisher=Ucalgary.ca |date=2010-12-13 |accessdate=2013-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Original Design Challenge|title=Peter Skillman Marshmallow Design Challenge|date=2014-01-27|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1p5sBzMtB3Q|accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Masculism''' or '''masculinism''' may variously refer to advocacy of the rights or needs of [[Man|men]] and [[boy]]s; and the adherence to or promotion of attributes (opinions, values, attitudes, habits) regarded as typical of men and boys.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Christensen|first=Ferrell|editor=Ted Honderich|title=The Oxford Companion to Philosophy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4ii8AAAAIAAJ|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-866132-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news|publisher=''[[Reason magazine|Reason]]''|title=Man Troubles: Making Sense of the Men's Movement|author=[[Cathy Young]]|date=July 1994|url=http://reason.com/archives/1994/07/01/man-troubles|quote=Masculism (mas'kye liz*'em), n. 1. the belief that equality between the sexes requires the recognition and redress of prejudice and discrimination against men as well as women. 2. the movement organized around this belief. References Warren Farrell, Jack Kammer, and others activists in the men's movement.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Definition and scope==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' (OED) defines ''masculism'', or synonymously ''masculinism'', as the "advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=masculism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculism, n. †1. The possession of masculine physical traits by a woman. Obs. rare. 2. = masculinism n.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="oedMasculinism"&gt;{{cite web|title=masculinism, n|work=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|edition=3rd |year=2000|accessdate=2015-02-17|quote=masculinism, n. Advocacy of the rights of men; adherence to or promotion of opinions, values, etc., regarded as typical of men; (more generally) anti-feminism, machismo.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, philosopher Ferrell Christensen differentiates "masculism" from "masculinism", defining the latter as promoting the attributes of manliness.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; 
Political scientist Georgia Duerst-Lahti also distinguishes the two terms, with masculism expressing the ethos of the early gender-egalitarian [[men's movement]], while masculinism refers to the ideology of [[patriarchy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last = Duerst-Lahti | first = Georgia | contribution = Gender Ideology: masculinism and femininalism |pages=159&amp;ndash;192 |editor1-last=Goertz |editor1-first=Gary |editor2-last=Mazur |editor2-first=Amy G. |title=Politics, gender, and concepts: theory and methodology |year=2008 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521723428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dupuis-Déri2009"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dupuis-Déri|first1=Francis|title=Le " masculinisme ": une histoire politique du mot (en Anglais et en Français)| trans-title = “Masculinism”: a political history of the term (in English and French) |journal=Recherches Féministes |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=97&amp;ndash;123 |url =https://doi.org/10.7202/039213ar |date=2009 |doi=10.7202/039213ar | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Christensen differentiates between "progressive masculism" and an "extremist version". The former welcomes many of the societal changes promoted by feminists, while believing that some measures reducing sexism against women have increased it against men.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; Nicholas Davidson, in his book ''The Failure of Feminism'', describes an extremist version of masculism which he termed "virism": "What ails society is 'effeminacy'. The improvement of society requires that the influence of female values be decreased and the influence of male values increased…."&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Davidson1988"&gt;Christensen, Ferrell (2005), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=WbkSDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA562 Masculism]", in {{cite book | editor-last = Honderich | editor-first = Ted | title = The Oxford companion to philosophy |pages=562&amp;ndash;563 | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford New York | isbn = 9780199264797 }}
* ''Citing'': {{cite book | last = Davidson | first = Nicholas | title = The failure of feminism |page=274 | publisher = Prometheus Books | location = Buffalo, New York | year = 1988 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=pf8pAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA274 | isbn = 9780879754082 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Gender theory|Gender theories]], which have frequently focused on woman-based or feminist approaches, have come to examine oppression in a masculist society also from the perspectives of men, many of whom are also subjected by that society.&lt;ref name="HoogensenSolheim2006"&gt;Hoogensen, Gunhild; Solheim, Bruce Olav (2006), "[https://books.google.com/?id=ZPThCTMVsZQC&amp;pg=PA21 Women in theory and practice]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Hoogensen | editor-first1 = Gunhild | editor-last2 = Solheim | editor-first2 = Bruce Olav |title=Women in power: world leaders since 1960|year=2006|page=21|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=9780275981907}}&lt;/ref&gt; From a feminist perspective to philosophy, masculinism seeks to value and include only male views, and claim "that anything that cannot be reduced or translated in men's experience should be excluded from the subject-matter of philosophy.&lt;ref name="BunninYu2008"/&gt;

Many masculists oppose co-educational schooling, believing that single-sex schools better promote the well-being of boys.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"&gt;

Data from the U.S. in 1994 reported that men suffer 94% of workplace fatalities. Masculist [[Warren Farrell]] has argued that men do a disproportionate share of dirty, physically demanding, and hazardous jobs.&lt;ref name=reason/&gt;

===Violence and suicide===

Masculists cite higher rates of suicide in men than women.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Masculists express concern about violence against men being depicted as humorous, in the media and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=MYTH&gt;{{cite book | last = Farrell | first = Warren | author-link = Warren Farrell | title = [[The Myth of Male Power|The myth of male power: why men are the disposable sex]] | publisher = [[Berkley Books]] | location = New York | year = 2001 | isbn = 9780425181447 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Custody===
{{main|Fathers' rights movement}}
According to [[David Benatar]], head of philosophy at the [[University of Cape Town]], "Custody law is perhaps the best-known area of men's rights activism", as it is more likely in most parts of the world for the mother to obtain custody of children in case of divorce. He argues: "When the man is the primary care-giver his chances of winning custody are lower than when the woman is the primary care-giver. Even when the case is not contested by the mother, he's still not as likely to get custody as when the woman's claim is uncontested".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = de Castella | first = Tom | title = Just who are men's rights activists? | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17907534 | work = [[BBC News Online#Features|BBC News Magazine]] | date = May 2, 2012 | access-date = May 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== South African masculist evangelical movements ==
In the wake of the abolition of apartheid, South Africa has seen a resurgence of masculist Christian evangelical groups, led by two complementary men's and women's movements, the Mighty Men movement and the Worthy Women movement.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nadar | first1 = Sarojini | last2 = Potgieter | first2 = Cheryl | title = Liberated through submission?: The Worthy Woman's Conference as a case study of for''men''ism | journal = Journal of Feminist Studies in Religion | volume = 26 | issue = 2 | pages = 141&amp;ndash;151 | publisher = [[Project MUSE]] | date = Fall 2010 | url = https://muse.jhu.edu/article/394797 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Mighty Men movement harkens back to the Victorian idea of Muscular Christianity&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Muscular Christianity in contemporary South Africa: The case of the Mighty Men Conference | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 71 | issue = 3 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;9 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = July 2015 | url = https://hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/2945/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the movement does not lead discussions about institutionalized racism.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Dube | first = Siphiwe | title = Race, whiteness and transformation in the Promise Keepers America and the Mighty Men Conference: A comparative analysis | journal = HTS [[Theological Studies/Teologiese Studies]] | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;8 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2016 | url = http://www.hts.org.za/index.php/HTS/article/view/3476/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist scholars argue that the movement's lack of attention to women's rights and their historical struggle with racial equality makes it a threat to women and to the stability of the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Scholar Miranda Pillay argues that the Mighty Men movement appeal lies in its resistance to gender equality as incompatible with Christian values, and in raising patriarchy to a "hyper-normative status," beyond challenge by other claims to power.&lt;ref&gt;Pillay, Miranda (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 Mighty Men, Mighty Families: A pro-family Christian movement to (re)enforce patriarchal control?]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 61&amp;ndash;77 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Worthy Women movement is a women's auxiliary to Mighty Men in advocating ''men''ism, a belief in the inherent superiority of men over women.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter" /&gt; Their leader is Gretha Wiid. She blames South Africa's disorder on the liberation of women, and aims to restore the nation through its families, making women again subservient to their men.&lt;ref&gt;Nortjé-Meyer, Lilly (2015), "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=yMTSCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA86 A movement seeking to embody support of patriarchal structures and patterns in church and society: Gertha Wiid's Worthy Women movement]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = Conradie | editor-first1 = Ernst M. | editor-last2=Pillay| editor-first2=Miranda| title = Ecclesial reform and deform movements in the South African context | pages = 86&amp;ndash;93 | publisher = African SUN MeDIA | location = Stellenbosch, South Africa | isbn = 9781920689766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her success is attributed to her balancing claims that God created the gender hierarchy, but that women are no less valuable than men,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nortjé-Meyer | first = Lilly | title = A critical analysis of Gretha Wiid’s sex ideology and her biblical hermeneutics | journal = Verbum et Ecclesia | volume = 32 | issue = 1 | pages = 1&amp;ndash;7 | publisher = AOSIS OpenJournals | date = November 2011 | url = http://verbumetecclesia.org.za/index.php/VE/article/view/472/html | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that restoration of traditional gender roles relieves existential anxiety in post-apartheid South Africa.&lt;ref name="Nadar_Potgieter"/&gt;

===Feminism===
Some masculinists have been described as explicitly antifeminist by feminist activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; According to Blais and Dupuis-Déri, "the contents of [masculinist] websites and the testimony of feminists that we questioned confirm that masculinists are generally critical of even moderate feminists and feminists at the head of official feminist organizations."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Some masculinist activism has involved disruption of events organized by feminists and lawsuits against feminist academics, journalists, or activists.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Furthermore, masculinist actions are sometimes extreme; father's rights activists have bombed family courts in Australia and have issued bomb threats in the UK, although it is ambiguous whether there was public and organized militant group involvement.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; They have also engaged in "tire-slashing, the mailing of excrement-filled packages, threats against politicians and their children."&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt; Spokesmen for these groups have also spoken out against public awareness campaigns to prevent sexual assault, arguing that they portray a negative image of men, and one masculinist group harassed administrators of dozens of battered women's shelters and women's centers.&lt;ref name="Blais, Melissa 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Martin | first1 = Janet M. | last2 = Borrelli | first2 = Maryanne | title = The other elites: Women, politics, and power in the Executive Branch | publisher = Lynne Rienner Publishers | location = Boulder, Colorado | year = 2001 | isbn = 9781555879716 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Philosopher Ferrell Christensen states that if masculism and feminism refer to the belief that men/women are systematically discriminated against, and that this discrimination should be eliminated, there is not necessarily a conflict between feminism and masculism, and some assert that they are both.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt; However, many believe that one sex is more discriminated against, and thus use one label and reject the other.&lt;ref name="Honderich1995"/&gt;

== Design of material handling systems ==
[[File:TG-usine-après.JPG|thumb|Material flow diagram between activities in a layout]]

Material handling is integral to the design of most production systems since the efficient flow of material between the activities of a production system is heavily dependent on the arrangement (or ''layout'') of the activities. If two activities are adjacent to each other, then material might easily be handed from one activity to another. If activities are in sequence, a conveyor can move the material at low cost. If activities are separated, more expensive industrial trucks or overhead conveyors are required for transport. The high cost of using an industrial truck for material transport is due to both the labor costs of the operator and the negative impact on the performance of a production system (e.g., increased [[work in process]]) when multiple units of material are combined into a single transfer batch in order to reduce the number of trips required for transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Factory Physics|last = Hopp|first = W.J.|publisher = Waveland|year = 2011|location = Long Grove, IL|pages = 318–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The unit load concept ===
[[File:Unit Load Size.png|thumb|Production batch can be split into a smaller transfer batch containing several unit loads, each of which can contain multiple parts]]

A unit load is either a single unit of an item, or multiple units so arranged or restricted that they can be handled as a single unit and maintain their integrity. Although granular, liquid, and gaseous materials can be transported in bulk, they can also be contained into unit loads using bags, drums, and cylinders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Basics of Material Handling|last = Kulwiec|first = R.A.|publisher = MHI|year = 1981|location = Charlotte, NC|pages = 10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Advantages of unit loads are that more items can be handled at the same time (thereby reducing the number of trips required, and potentially reducing handling costs, loading and unloading times, and product damage) and that it enables the use of standardized material handling equipment. Disadvantages of unit loads include the negative impact of batching on production system performance, and the cost of returning empty containers/pallets to their point of origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Manufacturing Facilities: Location, Planning, and Design|last = Sule|first = D.R.|publisher = PWS|year = 1994|location = Boston|pages = 249}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Pallet wrapper.jpg|thumb|Stretch-wrapping machine used to form a unit load]]

=== In-process handling ===
Unit loads can be used both for in-process handling and for distribution (receiving, storing, and shipping). Unit load design involves determining the type, size, weight, and configuration of the load; the equipment and method used to handle the load; and the methods of forming (or building) and breaking down the load. For in-process handling, unit loads should not be larger than the [[batch production|production batch]] size of parts in process. Large production batches (used to increase the utilization of bottleneck activities) can be split into smaller ''transfer batches'' for handling purposes, where each transfer batch contains one or more unit loads, and small unit loads can be combined into a larger transfer batch to allow more efficient transport.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Modeling and Analysis of Manufacturing Systems|last = Askin|first = R.G.|publisher = Wiley|year = 1993|location = New York|pages = 292}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distribution ===
[[File:ALMACEN CAYCO carpetilla.jpg|thumb|Narrow-aisle lift truck used in distribution]]
Selecting a unit load size for distribution can be difficult because containers/pallets are usually available only in standard sizes and configurations; truck trailers, rail boxcars, and airplane cargo bays are limited in width, length, and height; and the number of feasible container/pallet sizes for a load may be limited due to the existing warehouse layout and storage rack configurations and customer package/carton size and retail store shelf restrictions. Also, the practical size of a unit load may be limited by the equipment and aisle space available and the need for safe material handling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.ise.ncsu.edu/kay/Material_Handling_Equipment.pdf|title = Material Handling Equipment|date = 2012|accessdate = 2014-10-02|publisher = |last = Kay|first = M.G.|pages = 5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of material handling ==

=== Manual handling ===
[[File:Niosh-lifting-equation-illustration.gif|thumb|NIOSH Lifting Equation applied to loading punch press stock task]]

Manual handling refers to the use of a worker’s hands to move individual containers by lifting, lowering, filling, emptying, or carrying them. It can expose workers to physical conditions that can lead to injuries that represent a large percentage of the over half a million cases of musculoskeletal disorders reported in the U.S. each year, and often involve strains and sprains to the lower back, shoulders, and upper limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/docs/2007-131/pdfs/2007-131.pdf|title = Ergonomic Guidelines for Manual Material Handling|date = 2007|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = California Department of Industrial Relations}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ergonomic improvements can be used to modify manual handling tasks to reduce injury. These improvements can include reconfiguring the task and using positioning equipment like lift/tilt/turn tables, hoists, balancers, and manipulators to reduce reaching and bending. The NIOSH (National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health) 1991 Revised Lifting Equation&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Applications Manual for the Revised NIOSH Lifting Equation|last = Waters|first = T.R.|publisher = Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|year = 1994|location = Cincinnati, OH|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to evaluate manual lifting tasks. Under ideal circumstances, the maximum recommended weight for manual lifting to avoid back injuries is 51&amp;nbsp;lb (23.13&amp;nbsp;kg). Using the exact conditions of the lift (height, distance lifted, weight, position of weight relative to body, asymmetrical lifts, and objects that are difficult to grasp), six multipliers are used to reduce the maximum recommended weight for less than ideal lifting tasks.

=== Automated handling ===
[[File:FANUC R2000iB AtWork.jpg|thumb|Industrial robot]]
Whenever technically and economically feasible, equipment can be used to reduce and sometimes replace the need to manually handle material. Most existing material handling equipment is only ''semi-automated'' because a human operator is needed for tasks like loading/unloading and driving that are difficult and/or too costly to fully automate. However, ongoing advances in sensing, machine intelligence, and robotics have made it possible to fully automate an increasing number of handling tasks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=dexarticle&gt;{{cite web |last1=Knight |first1=Will |title=This is the most dexterous robot ever created |url=https://www.technologyreview.com/s/610587/robots-get-closer-to-human-like-dexterity/ |website=MIT Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hodson |first1=Richard |title=How robots are grasping the art of gripping |journal=Nature |date=10 May 2018 |volume=557 |issue=7704 |url=https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-05093-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=dexnet&gt;[https://berkeleyautomation.github.io/dex-net/ Mahler, Jeffrey, et al. "Dexterity Network Home Page"]&lt;/ref&gt; A rough guide to determine how much can be spent for automated equipment that would replace one material handler is to consider that, with benefits, the median moving machine operator costs a company $45,432 per year.&lt;ref&gt;$31,530 median wage divided by 0.694, where wages represent 69.4% and benefits 30.6% of total labor cost ({{Cite web|url = http://www.bls.gov/news.release/ecec.nr0.htm|title = Employer Costs for Employee Compensation|date = December 2014|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = BLS}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Assuming a real interest rate of 1.7%&lt;ref&gt;Average U.S. rate from 2005-2009 ({{Cite web|url = http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FR.INR.RINR|title = Real interest rate|date = |accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = The World Bank}}).&lt;/ref&gt; and a service life of 5 years&lt;ref&gt;Average service life of Custom Software ({{Cite web|url = https://www.bea.gov/national/FA2004/Tablecandtext.pdf|title = BEA Depreciation Estimates|date = 2004|accessdate = 2015-05-15|publisher = BEA}}), conservative assumption since software is a major component of automated equipment and has the shortest service life compared to other components.&lt;/ref&gt; for the equipment with no salvage value,&lt;ref&gt;Conservative assumption that simplifies the analysis since any positive salvage value would
increase the purchase cost estimate.&lt;/ref&gt; a company should be willing to pay up to

&lt;math&gt;\$45\,432\left (\frac{1-1.017^{-5}}{0.017} \right )=\$45\,432(4.75)=\$219\,019
&lt;/math&gt;

to purchase automated equipment to replace one worker.&lt;ref&gt;Amount willing to pay is the present value of an [[Present value|annuity immediate]].&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases, automated equipment is not as flexible as a human operator, both with respect to not being able to do a particular task as well as a human and not being able to be as easily redeployed to do other tasks as needs change.

'''Metabolic network reconstruction and simulation''' allows for an in-depth insight into the molecular mechanisms of a particular organism. In particular, these models correlate the [[genome]] with molecular [[physiology]].&lt;ref name=Franke_2005&gt;{{cite journal|last=Franke|author2=Siezen, Teusink|title=Reconstructing the metabolic network of a bacterium from its genome.|journal=Trends in Microbiology|year=2005|volume=13|issue=11|pages=550–558|pmid=16169729|doi=10.1016/j.tim.2005.09.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reconstruction breaks down [[metabolic]] pathways (such as [[glycolysis]] and the [[citric acid cycle]]) into their respective reactions and enzymes, and analyzes them within the perspective of the entire network. In simplified terms, a reconstruction collects all of the relevant metabolic information of an organism and compiles it in a mathematical model.  Validation and analysis of reconstructions can allow identification of key features of metabolism such as growth yield, resource distribution, network robustness, and gene essentiality. This knowledge can then be applied to create novel [[biotechnology]].

In general, the process to build a reconstruction is as follows:
# Draft a reconstruction
# Refine the model
# Convert model into a mathematical/computational representation
# Evaluate and debug model through experimentation

==Genome-scale metabolic reconstruction==
A metabolic reconstruction provides a highly mathematical, structured platform on which to understand the systems biology of metabolic pathways within an organism.&lt;ref name=Thiele_2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thiele|first=Ines|author2=Bernhard Ø Palsson|title=A protocol for generating a high-quality genome-scale metabolic reconstruction|journal=Nature Protocols|date=January 2010|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93–121|doi=10.1038/nprot.2009.203|pmid=20057383|pmc=3125167}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The integration of biochemical metabolic pathways with rapidly available, annotated genome sequences has developed what are called genome-scale metabolic models. Simply put, these models correspond metabolic genes with metabolic pathways. In general, the more information about physiology, biochemistry and genetics is available for the target organism, the better the predictive capacity of the reconstructed models. Mechanically speaking, the process of reconstructing prokaryotic and eukaryotic [[metabolic network]]s is essentially the same. Having said this, eukaryote reconstructions are typically more challenging because of the size of genomes, coverage of knowledge, and the multitude of cellular compartments.&lt;ref name="Thiele_2010"/&gt; The first genome-scale metabolic model was generated in 1995 for ''Haemophilus influenzae''.&lt;ref name=Venter_Influenzae&gt;{{cite journal|title=Whole-genome random sequencing and assembly of Haemophilus influenzae Rd|journal=Science|year=1995|volume=269|issue=1995|pages=496–512|pmid=7542800|doi=10.1126/science.7542800|author1=Fleischmann|first1=R.

==Drafting a reconstruction==

===Resources===
Because the timescale for the development of reconstructions is so recent, most reconstructions have been built manually. However, now, there are quite a few resources that allow for the semi-automatic assembly of these reconstructions that are utilized due to the time and effort necessary for a reconstruction. An initial fast reconstruction can be developed automatically using resources like PathoLogic or ERGO in combination with encyclopedias like MetaCyc, and then manually updated by using resources like PathwayTools. These semi-automatic methods allow for a fast draft to be created while allowing the fine tune adjustments required once new experimental data is found. It is only in this manner that the field of metabolic reconstructions will keep up with the ever-increasing numbers of annotated genomes.

====Databases====
* '''Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes ([http://www.kegg.jp/ KEGG])''': a bioinformatics database containing information on genes, proteins, reactions, and pathways. The ‘KEGG Organisms’ section, which is divided into [[eukaryotes]] and [[prokaryotes]], encompasses many organisms for which gene and [[DNA]] information can be searched by typing in the enzyme of choice.
* '''BioCyc, EcoCyc, and MetaCyc''': [http://biocyc.org/ BioCyc] Is a collection of 3,000 pathway/genome databases (as of Oct 2013), with each database dedicated to one organism. For example, [http://ecocyc.org/ EcoCyc] is a highly detailed [[bioinformatics]] database on the genome and metabolic reconstruction of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'', including thorough descriptions of ''E. coli'' signaling pathways and regulatory network. The EcoCyc database can serve as a paradigm and model for any reconstruction. Additionally, [http://biocyc.org/metacyc/index.shtml MetaCyc], an encyclopedia of experimentally defined metabolic pathways and enzymes, contains 2,100 metabolic pathways and 11,400 metabolic reactions (Oct 2013).

====Tools for literature====
* '''PUBMED''': This is an online library developed by the [[National Center for Biotechnology Information]], which contains a massive collection of medical journals. Using the link provided by ENZYME, the search can be directed towards the organism of interest, thus recovering literature on the enzyme and its use inside of the organism.

===Methodology to draft a reconstruction===
[[File:Metabolic Network Reconstruction Process.pdf|thumb|This is a visual representation of the metabolic network reconstruction process.]]

A reconstruction is built by compiling data from the resources above.  Database tools such as KEGG and BioCyc can be used in conjunction with each other to find all the metabolic genes in the organism of interest.  These genes will be compared to closely related organisms that have already developed reconstructions to find homologous genes and reactions. These homologous genes and reactions are carried over from the known reconstructions to form the draft reconstruction of the organism of interest. Tools such as ERGO, Pathway Tools and Model SEED can compile data into pathways to form a network of metabolic and non-metabolic pathways. These networks are then verified and refined before being made into a mathematical simulation.&lt;ref name="Thiele_2010"/&gt;

The predictive aspect of a metabolic reconstruction hinges on the ability to predict the biochemical reaction catalyzed by a protein using that protein's amino acid sequence as an input, and to infer the structure of a metabolic network based on the predicted set of reactions. A network of enzymes and metabolites is drafted to relate sequences and function.  When an uncharacterized protein is found in the genome, its amino acid sequence is first compared to those of previously characterized proteins to search for homology.  When a homologous protein is found, the proteins are considered to have a common ancestor and their functions are inferred as being similar.  However, the quality of a reconstruction model is dependent on its ability to accurately infer phenotype directly from sequence, so this rough estimation of protein function will not be sufficient.  A number of algorithms and bioinformatics resources have been developed for refinement of sequence homology-based assignments of protein functions:
* '''[http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/cgi-bin/index.cgi InParanoid]''':  Identifies eukaryotic orthologs by looking only at [[in-paralog]]s.
* '''[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/cdd CDD]''':  Resource for the annotation of functional units in proteins. Its collection of domain models utilizes 3D structure to provide insights into sequence/structure/function relationships.
* '''[http://www.ebi.ac.uk/interpro/ InterPro]''':  Provides functional analysis of proteins by classifying them into families and predicting domains and important sites.
* '''[http://string.embl.de/ STRING]''':  Database of known and predicted protein interactions.

Once proteins have been established, more information about the enzyme structure, reactions catalyzed, substrates and products, mechanisms, and more can be acquired from databases such as [http://www.kegg.jp/ KEGG], [http://www.metacyc.org/ MetaCyc] and [http://www.chem.qmul.ac.uk/iubmb/enzyme/ NC-IUBMB].  Accurate metabolic reconstructions require additional information about the reversibility and preferred physiological direction of an enzyme-catalyzed reaction which can come from databases such as [http://www.brenda-enzymes.org/ BRENDA] or [http://www.metacyc.org/ MetaCyc] database.&lt;ref name="Ivanova_2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ivanova|first=N.|author2=A. Lykidis|title=Metabolic Reconstruction|journal=Encyclopedia of Microbiology, 3rd Ed.|year=2009|pages=607–621|doi=10.1016/B978-012373944-5.00010-9|isbn=9780123739445}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Model refinement==
An initial metabolic reconstruction of a genome is typically far from perfect due to the high variability and diversity of microorganisms.  Often, metabolic pathway databases such as KEGG and MetaCyc will have "holes", meaning that there is a conversion from a substrate to a product (i.e., an enzymatic activity) for which there is no known protein in the genome that encodes the enzyme that facilitates the catalysis.  What can also happen in semi-automatically drafted reconstructions is that some pathways are falsely predicted and don't actually occur in the predicted manner.&lt;ref name="Ivanova_2009" /&gt;  Because of this, a systematic verification is made in order to make sure no inconsistencies are present and that all the entries listed are correct and accurate.&lt;ref name="Franke_2005" /&gt;  Furthermore, previous literature can be researched in order to support any information obtained from one of the many metabolic reaction and genome databases. This provides an added level of assurance for the reconstruction that the enzyme and the reaction it catalyzes do actually occur in the organism.

[[Enzyme promiscuity]] and spontaneous chemical reactions can damage metabolites. This [[Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|metabolite damage, and its repair or pre-emption]], create energy costs that need to be incorporated into models. It is likely that many genes of unknown function encode proteins that repair or pre-empt metabolite damage, but most genome-scale metabolic reconstructions only include a fraction of all genes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Linster|first = Carole L.|last2 = Van Schaftingen|first2 = Emile|last3 = Hanson|first3 = Andrew D.|date = 2013-02-01|title = Metabolite damage and its repair or pre-emption|journal = Nature Chemical Biology|volume = 9|issue = 2|pages = 72–80|doi = 10.1038/nchembio.1141|issn = 1552-4469|pmid = 23334546}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Hanson|first = Andrew D.|last2 = Henry|first2 = Christopher S.|last3 = Fiehn|first3 = Oliver|last4 = de Crécy-Lagard|first4 = Valérie|date = 2015-11-19|title = Metabolite Damage and Metabolite Damage Control in Plants|journal = Annual Review of Plant Biology|doi = 10.1146/annurev-arplant-043015-111648|issn = 1545-2123|pmid = 26667673|volume=67|pages=131–52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Any new reaction not present in the databases needs to be added to the reconstruction. This is an iterative process that cycles between the experimental phase and the coding phase. As new information is found about the target organism, the model will be adjusted to predict the metabolic and phenotypical output of the cell. The presence or absence of certain reactions of the metabolism will affect the amount of [[reactants]]/products that are present for other reactions within the particular pathway. This is because products in one reaction go on to become the reactants for another reaction, i.e. products of one reaction can combine with other proteins or compounds to form new proteins/compounds in the presence of different enzymes or [[catalysts]].&lt;ref name = "Franke_2005" /&gt;

Francke ''et al.'' &lt;ref name="Franke_2005"/&gt; provide an excellent example as to why the verification step of the project needs to be performed in significant detail. During a metabolic network reconstruction of ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'', the model showed that [[succinyl-CoA]] was one of the reactants for a reaction that was a part of the biosynthesis of [[methionine]]. However, an understanding of the physiology of the organism would have revealed that due to an incomplete tricarboxylic acid pathway, ''Lactobacillus plantarum'' does not actually produce succinyl-CoA, and the correct reactant for that part of the reaction was [[acetyl-CoA]].

Therefore, systematic verification of the initial reconstruction will bring to light several inconsistencies that can adversely affect the final interpretation of the reconstruction, which is to accurately comprehend the molecular mechanisms of the organism. Furthermore, the [[simulation]] step also ensures that all the reactions present in the reconstruction are properly balanced. To sum up, a reconstruction that is fully accurate can lead to greater insight about understanding the functioning of the organism of interest.&lt;ref name = "Franke_2005" /&gt;

==Metabolic network simulation==
A metabolic network can be broken down into a stoichiometric matrix where the rows represent the compounds of the reactions, while the columns of the matrix correspond to the reactions themselves. [[Stoichiometry]] is a quantitative relationship between [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrates]] of a chemical reaction. In order to deduce what the metabolic network suggests, recent research has centered on a few approaches, such as extreme pathways, elementary mode analysis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Papin | first1 = JA | last2 = Stelling | first2 = J | last3 = Price | first3 = ND | last4 = Klamt | first4 = S | last5 = Schuster | first5 = S | last6 = Palsson | first6 = BO | date = Aug 2004 | title = Comparison of network-based pathway analysis methods | url = | journal = Trends Biotechnol | volume = 22 | issue = 8| pages = 400–5 | doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.06.010 | pmid=15283984}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[flux balance analysis]], and a number of other constraint-based modeling methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = N.E. | last2 = Nagarajan | first2 = H. | last3 = Palsson | year = 2012 | title =Constraining the metabolic genotype–phenotype relationship using a phylogeny of ''in silico'' methods | doi = 10.1038/nrmicro2737 | journal = Nature Reviews Microbiology | volume = 10 | issue = 4| pages = 291–305 | pmid=22367118 | pmc=3536058}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://cobramethods.wikidot.com/ CoBRA Methods - Constraint-based analysis&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extreme pathways===
Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name=Price_2003&gt;{{cite journal|last=Price|first=Nathan|author2=Jennifer Reed |author3=Jason Papin |author4=Sharon Wiback |author5=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Network-based analysis of metabolic regulation in the human red blood cell|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=November 2003|volume=225|issue=2|pages=185–194|pmid=14575652|doi=10.1016/s0022-5193(03)00237-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the Palsson lab, use a method of singular value decomposition (SVD) of extreme pathways in order to understand regulation of a human [[red blood cell]] metabolism. Extreme pathways are convex [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis vectors]] that consist of [[steady state]] functions of a metabolic network.&lt;ref name=Papin_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papin|first=Jason|author2=Nathan Price |author3=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Extreme Pathway Lengths and Reaction Participation in Genome-Scale Metabolic Networks|journal=Genome Research|date=December 2002|volume=12|issue=12|pages=1889–1900|pmid=12466293|doi=10.1101/gr.327702|pmc=187577}}&lt;/ref&gt; For any particular metabolic network, there is always a unique set of extreme pathways available.&lt;ref name=Papin_2004&gt;{{cite journal|last=Papin|first=Jason|author2=Nathan Price |author3=Bernhard O Palsson |title=Comparison of network-based pathway analysis methods|journal=Trends in Biotechnology|date=August 2004|volume=22|issue=8|pages=400–405|pmid=15283984|doi=10.1016/j.tibtech.2004.06.010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; define a [[constraint-based approach]], where through the help of [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraints]] like [[mass balance]] and maximum [[reaction rates]], it is possible to develop a ‘solution space’ where all the feasible options fall within. Then, using a kinetic model approach, a single solution that falls within the extreme pathway solution space can be determined.&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; Therefore, in their study, Price, Reed, and Papin,&lt;ref name = "Price_2003" /&gt; use both constraint and [[kinetic energy|kinetic]] approaches to understand the human red blood cell metabolism. In conclusion, using extreme pathways, the regulatory mechanisms of a metabolic network can be studied in further detail.

===Elementary mode analysis===
Elementary mode analysis closely matches the approach used by extreme pathways. Similar to extreme pathways, there is always a unique set of elementary modes available for a particular metabolic network.&lt;ref name = "Papin_2004" /&gt; These are the smallest sub-networks that allow a metabolic reconstruction network to function in steady state.&lt;ref name=Schuster_2000&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schuster|first=S|author2=Fell DA |author3=Dandekar T |title=A general definition of metabolic pathways useful for systematic organization and analysis of complex metabolic networks|journal=Nature Biotechnology|date=March 2000|volume=18|issue=3|pages=326–332|pmid=10700151|doi=10.1038/73786}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Stelling_2002&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stelling|first=J|author2=Klamt S |author3=Bettenbrock K |author4=Schuster S |author5=Gilles ED |title=Metabolic network structure determines key aspects of functionality and regulation.|journal=Nature|date=November 2002|volume=420|issue=6912|pages=190–193|pmid=12432396|doi=10.1038/nature01166|bibcode=2002Natur.420..190S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ullah_2015&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ullah|first=E|author2=Aeron S |author3=Hassoun S|title=gEFM: An Algorithm for Computing Elementary Flux Modes Using Graph Traversal.|journal=IEEE/ACM Transactions on Computational Biology and Bioinformatics|volume=13|issue=1|pages=122–34|date=2015|doi=10.1109/TCBB.2015.2430344|pmid=26886737}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stelling (2002),&lt;ref name = "Stelling_2002" /&gt; elementary modes can be used to understand cellular objectives for the overall metabolic network. Furthermore, elementary mode analysis takes into account [[Stoichiometry|stoichiometrics]] and [[thermodynamics]] when evaluating whether a particular metabolic route or network is feasible and likely for a set of proteins/enzymes.&lt;ref name = "Schuster_2000" /&gt;

===Minimal metabolic behaviors (MMBs)===
In 2009, Larhlimi and Bockmayr presented a new approach called "minimal metabolic behaviors" for the analysis of metabolic networks.&lt;ref name=Larhlimi_2009&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larhlimi|first=A|author2=Bockmayr, A.|title=A new constraint-based description of the steady-state flux cone of metabolic networks|journal=Discrete Applied Mathematics|year=2009|volume=157|issue=10|pages=2257–2266|doi=10.1016/j.dam.2008.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like elementary modes or extreme pathways, these are uniquely determined by the network, and yield a complete description of the flux cone. However, the new description is much more compact. In contrast with elementary modes and extreme pathways, which use an inner description based on generating vectors of the flux cone, MMBs are using an outer description of the flux cone. This approach is based on sets of non-negativity constraints. These can be identified with irreversible reactions, and thus have a direct biochemical interpretation. One can characterize a metabolic network by MMBs and the reversible metabolic space.

===Flux balance analysis===
{{main article|Flux balance analysis}}
A different technique to simulate the metabolic network is to perform [[flux balance analysis]]. This method uses [[linear programming]], but in contrast to elementary mode analysis and extreme pathways, only a single solution results in the end. Linear programming is usually used to obtain the maximum potential of the objective function that you are looking at, and therefore, when using flux balance analysis, a single solution is found to the optimization problem.&lt;ref name = "Stelling_2002" /&gt; In a flux balance analysis approach, exchange [[flux]]es are assigned to those metabolites that enter or leave the particular network only. Those metabolites that are consumed within the network are not assigned any exchange flux value. Also, the exchange fluxes along with the enzymes can have constraints ranging from a negative to positive value (ex: -10 to 10).

Furthermore, this particular approach can accurately define if the reaction stoichiometry is in line with predictions by providing fluxes for the balanced reactions. Also, flux balance analysis can highlight the most effective and efficient pathway through the network in order to achieve a particular objective function. In addition, [[gene knockout]] studies can be performed using flux balance analysis. The enzyme that correlates to the gene that needs to be removed is given a constraint value of 0. Then, the reaction that the particular enzyme catalyzes is completely removed from the analysis.

===Dynamic simulation and parameter estimation===
In order to perform a dynamic simulation with such a network it is necessary to construct an ordinary differential equation
system that describes the rates of change in each metabolite's concentration or amount. To this end, a rate law, i.e., a kinetic equation that determines the rate of reaction based on the concentrations of all reactants is required for each reaction. Software packages that include numerical integrators, such as [[COPASI]] or [http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsimulator SBMLsimulator], are then able to simulate the system dynamics given an initial condition. Often these rate laws contain kinetic parameters with uncertain values. In many cases it is desired to estimate these parameter values with respect to given time-series data of metabolite concentrations. The system is then supposed to reproduce the given data. For this purpose the distance between the given data set and the result of the simulation, i.e., the numerically or in few cases analytically obtained solution of the differential equation system is computed. The values of the parameters are then estimated to minimize this distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dräger|first=A|author2=Kronfeld M |author3=Ziller MJ |author4=Supper J |author5=Planatscher H |author6=Magnus JB |author7=Oldiges M |author8=Kohlbacher O |author9=Zell A  |title=Modeling metabolic networks in C. glutamicum: a comparison of rate laws in combination with various parameter optimization strategies|journal=BMC Systems Biology|date=January 2009|volume=3|issue=5|pmid=19144170|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-3-5|pmc=2661887|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; One step further, it may be desired to estimate the mathematical structure of the differential equation system because the real rate laws are not known for the reactions within the system under study. To this end, the program [http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/software/SBMLsqueezer SBMLsqueezer] allows automatic creation of appropriate rate laws for all reactions with the network.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dräger|first1=Andreas|last2=Hassis|first2=Nadine|last3=Supper|first3=Jochen|last4=Schröder|first4=Adrian|last5=Zell|first5=Andreas|title=SBMLsqueezer: A CellDesigner plug-in to generate kinetic rate equations for biochemical networks|journal=BMC Systems Biology|volume=2|issue=1|page=39|doi=10.1186/1752-0509-2-39|pmid=18447902|pmc=2412839|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synthetic accessibility===
Synthetic accessibility is a simple approach to network simulation whose goal is to predict which metabolic gene knockouts are lethal. The synthetic accessibility approach uses the topology of the metabolic network to calculate the sum of the minimum number of steps needed to traverse the metabolic network graph from the inputs, those metabolites available to the organism from the environment, to the outputs, metabolites needed by the organism to survive. To simulate a gene knockout, the reactions enabled by the gene are removed from the network and the synthetic accessibility metric is recalculated. An increase in the total number of steps is predicted to cause lethality. Wunderlich and Mirny showed this simple, parameter-free approach predicted knockout lethality in ''E. coli'' and ''S. cerevisiae'' as well as elementary mode analysis and flux balance analysis in a variety of media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wunderlich|first=Z|author2=Leonid Mirny|title=Using the topology of metabolic networks to predict viability of mutant strains|journal=Biophysical Journal|date=September 2006|volume=91|issue=6|pages=2304–11|pmid= 16782788|doi=10.1529/biophysj.105.080572|pmc=1557581|bibcode=2006BpJ....91.2304W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications of a reconstruction==

Information about the chemical reactions of metabolism and the genetic background of various metabolic properties (sequence to structure to function) can be utilized by genetic engineers to modify organisms to produce high value outputs whether those products be medically relevant like pharmaceuticals; high value chemical intermediates such as terpenoids and isoprenoids; or biotechnological outputs like biofuels.

Metabolic network reconstructions and models are used to understand how an organism or parasite functions inside of the host cell. For example, if the parasite serves to compromise the [[immune system]] by lysing [[macrophages]], then the goal of metabolic reconstruction/simulation would be to determine the metabolites that are essential to the organism's proliferation inside of macrophages. If the proliferation cycle is inhibited, then the parasite would not continue to evade the host's immune system. A reconstruction model serves as a first step to deciphering the complicated mechanisms surrounding disease. These models can also look at the minimal genes necessary for a cell to maintain virulence. The next step would be to use the predictions and postulates generated from a reconstruction model and apply it to discover novel biological functions such as [[drug-engineering]] and [[drug delivery]] techniques.

The '''metencephalon''' is the [[embryo]]nic part of the [[hindbrain]] that differentiates into the [[pons]] and the [[cerebellum]]. It contains a portion of the [[fourth ventricle]] and the [[trigeminal nerve]] (CN V), [[abducens nerve]] (CN VI), [[facial nerve]] (CN VII), and a portion of the [[vestibulocochlear nerve]] (CN VIII).

== Embryology ==
The metencephalon develops from the higher/rostral half of the [[embryon]]ic [[rhombencephalon]], and is differentiated from the [[myelencephalon]] in the embryo by approximately 5 weeks of age.  By the third month, the metencephalon differentiates into its two main structures, the pons and the cerebellum.

== Functions ==
The pons regulates breathing through particular nuclei that regulate the breathing center of the [[medulla oblongata]].  The [[cerebellum]] works to coordinate muscle movements, maintain posture, and integrate sensory information from the [[inner ear]] and [[proprioceptors]] in the muscles and joints.

== Development ==
At the early stages of brain development, the brain vesicles that are formed are imperative.&lt;ref name=Nakamura&gt;Nakamura, H., and Watanabe, Y. Isthmus organizer and regionalization of the mesencephalon and metencephalon. Int. J. Dev. Biol. 49: 231-235 (2005). doi: 10.1387/ijdb.041964hn.&lt;/ref&gt; Each brain region is characterized by its own specific architecture. These regions of the brain are determined by a combination of transcription factors and the signals that change their expression.&lt;ref name="Nakamura" /&gt;
 
The [[Isthmic Organizer|isthmus]] is the main organizing center for the tectum and the cerebellum.&lt;ref name=Matsunaga&gt;Matsunaga, E., Katahira, T., and Nakamura, H. [http://dev.biologists.org/content/129/22/5269.full "Role of Lmx1b and Wnt1 in mesencephalon and metencephalon development"]"Development" (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The tectum is the dorsal part of the metencephalon. The tectum includes the superior and inferior colliculli, which play a part in visual and audio processing. Two of the major genes that affect the metencephalon are Fgf8 and Wnt1, which are both expressed around the isthmus. Fgf8 is also known as Fibroblast Growth Factor 8. It is a protein that is widely thought to be the most important organizing signal. Its main function is to set up and maintain the barrier between the midbrain and hindbrain, specifically between the mesencephalon and metencephalon.&lt;ref name="Matsunaga" /&gt; It also plays a large role in deciding the structure of the mid- and hindbrain. Wnt1 is a proto-oncogene protein (Wingless-type MMTV integration site family, member 1). This gene was originally thought to play a role in the development of the midbrain and hindbrain, but studies have shown that this may not be the case.&lt;ref name="Matsunaga" /&gt; Wnt1 is thought to be behind the genetic disorder called Joubert Syndrome, a disorder that affects the cerebellum. 
 
Otx1 and Otx2  are genes that play important parts in the development of the brain, and studies have shown that their roles change throughout the brain’s development.&lt;ref name=Sakuri&gt;Sakuri, Y., Kurokawa, D., Kiyonari, H., Kajikawa, E., Suda, Y., and Aizawa, S.

'''Mexican art''' consists of various [[visual arts]] that developed over the geographical area now known as Mexico. The development of these arts roughly follows the [[history of Mexico]], divided into the prehispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n era, the colonial period, with the period after [[Mexican War of Independence]] further subdivided. Mexican art is usually filled most of the time with intricate patterns.&lt;ref name="jflam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican Art Over Three Millennia |first=Jack |last=ver Flam |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=October 9, 1990 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] for a period of about 3,000 years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion—most art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly [[casta]] paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the [[Academy of San Carlos]], but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.&lt;ref name="paz"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.301.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Mexican muralism|Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement]] led by artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]], who were commissioned by the post-[[Mexican Revolution]] government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture.

The strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage.

==Pre-Columbian art==
[[File:Cavepaintings-loltun.jpg|thumb|Painting cave in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]]]

It is believed that the American continent's oldest rock art, 7500 years old, is found in a cave on the peninsula of Baja California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html Descubierta en una cueva de México la pintura rupestre más antigua de América / EL MUNDO&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213061450/http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as [[Mesoamerica]], which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into [[Central America]],&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the [[Olmec]]s, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as [[Mesoamerican writing systems|hieroglyphic writing]], [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture ([[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]]) and [[jade]] work.&lt;ref name="pazp38"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were a forerunner of later cultures such as [[Teotihuacan]], north of Mexico City, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] in Oaxaca and the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] in southern Mexico, [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s and a mostly common cosmology.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4" /&gt;

While art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12" /&gt; [[Octavio Paz]] states that "Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology." He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as [[fretwork|stepped frets]] on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.&lt;ref name="pazp41"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tlatilco culture figurines.jpg|thumb|Female figurines from the [[Tlatilco culture]], 1250 to 800 BCE.]]
Art was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, [[amate]] paper and architecture.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9" /&gt; Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]] area around 1,500 BCE and spread to [[Veracruz]], the [[Valley of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Chiapas]] and the Pacific coast of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt; The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p6"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the middle pre-Classic, ceramic sculpture declined in the center of Mexico except in the [[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]] region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p67"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Messico, maya, piatto da calakmul, 600-800 ca..JPG|thumb|Painted ceramic plate from [[Calakmul]], 600 to 800 AD.]]
Mesoamerican painting is found in various expressions—from murals, to the creation of [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800&amp;nbsp;BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at [[Uaxactun]] and [[Tikal]], and in [[Teotihuacan]] with walls painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;

Paints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt; Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from [[Tequixquiac]] that dates between 10,000 and 8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56" /&gt; Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the [[Olmec#Colossal heads|giant Olmec stone heads]]. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the [[Aztec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CoyolxauhquiDisk cropped.JPG|thumb|A disk depicting the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]], 14th to 16th century, at the [[Templo Mayor]] museum.]]
The majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p15"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern [[Veracruz]] and the coastal area of [[Tabasco]] in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[La Venta]]. This practice spread to the [[Oaxaca]] area and the [[Valley of Mexico]], appearing in cities such as [[Monte Albán]], [[Cuicuilco]] and [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p18"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

These cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p2023"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Albán, Teotihuacan and [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from [[Yaxchilan]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing.&lt;ref name="pazp41" /&gt; The reason for this is that both sought to record history and the culture's interpretation of reality.(salvatvolp14) Manuscripts were written on paper or other book-like materials then bundled into [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]].&lt;ref name="eboone"&gt;Boone 2000, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of reading and writing was strictly designated to the highest priest classes, as this ability was a source of their power over society.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt;

The [[Mesoamerican writing systems|pictograms or glyphs of this writing system]] were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt; Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more is known about the Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eboone" /&gt; Important [[Aztec codices]] include the [[Borgia Group]] of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the [[Codex Borbonicus]], [[Codex Mendoza]], and the late [[Florentine Codex]], which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost.

===The early colonial era and indigenous artists and influences===

[[File:AtriumCrossAcolman1.JPG|thumb|right|An atrium cross in [[Acolman]]. During the early period of evangelization, an enclosed open chapels for large congregations of neophytes saw the creation and placement of decorated, anthropomorphized stone crosses with Jesus at their center.]]
Since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Mexican art has been an ongoing and complex interaction between the traditions of Europe and native perspectives.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;

'''Church construction'''  After the conquest, Spaniards' first efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called ''tequitqui'' ([[Nahuatl]] for “vassal”), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p34"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexorg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicanarchitecture.org/glossary/index.php?detail=121 |author=Charlote Ekland |title= Mexican Colonial Architecture |publisher=Mexican Architecture |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. "Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship."&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall 2003, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that so many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction.

The first monasteries built in and around Mexico City, such as the [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl|monasteries on the slopes of Popocatepetl]], had [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Plateresque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] elements, or some combination. They were relatively undecorated, with building efforts going more towards high walls and fortress features to ward off attacks.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p17"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of more elaborate churches with large quantities of religious artwork would define much of the artistic output of the colonial period. Most of the production was related to the teaching and reinforcement of Church doctrine, just as in Europe. Religious art set the rationale for Spanish domination over the indigenous. Today, colonial-era structures and other works exist all over the country, with a concentration in the central highlands around [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huanitzin.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego Huanutzin]], nephew and son-in-law of [[Moctezuma II]] to present to [[Pope Paul III]], dated 1539]]
[[File:The Florentine Codex- Aztec Feather Painters VI.tiff|thumb|left|Feather work artists as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]] (ca. 1576).]]
[[Mexican feather work|'''Feather work''']] was a highly valued skill of prehispanic central Mexico that continued into the early colonial era.  Spaniards were fascinated by this form of art, and indigenous feather workers (''amanteca'') produced religious images in this medium, mainly small "paintings", as well as religious vestments.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schrefler, "Visual Arts: Sixteenth Century" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Castello Yturbide, ''The Art of Featherwork in Mexico'', Mexico: Fomento Cultural Banamex 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous writings'''  Indians continued production of written manuscripts in the early colonial era, especially [[Aztec codices|codices in the Nahua area]] of central Mexico.  An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was [[Codex Mendoza]], named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the [[Florentine Codex]] directed by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].  Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the [[Huexotzinco Codex]] and Codex Osuna.

An important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint.  The early [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec empire, as well the [[Hernán Cortés]] and his cultural translator Doña Marina ([[Malinche]]).

'''Painting''' Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous.  An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Schrefler, "Visual Arts", p.1556.&lt;/ref&gt;

While colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement—the addition of native elements, which began with the ''tequitqui,'' continued. They were never the center of the works, but decorative motifs and filler, such as native foliage, pineapples, corn, and [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]].&lt;ref name="jcummings"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1311-diego-frida-and-the-mexican-school |title= Diego, Frida And The Mexican School |first=Joe |last=Cummings |date= January 1, 1999 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this can be seen on portals as well as large frescoes that often decorated the interior of churches and the walls of monastery areas closed to the public.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253322 |title=Colonial Art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest of Mexico's colonial artists were Spanish-born who came to Mexico in the middle of their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso López de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique—which did not encourage innovation.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p10"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Baroque===
{{See also|Architecture of Mexico}}
[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|right|thumb|18th-century painting of [[God the Father]] fashioning the image of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]]]
Baroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebastián López de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called ''Doubting Thomas'' from 1643. In this work, the [[Apostle Thomas]] is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads "the Word made flesh" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

One difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by [[Caravaggio]] in Italy, which became popular with artists in [[Seville]], from which many migrants came to New Spain came.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called ''estofado'', the application of paint over gold leaf.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

The most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], known through copies made from engravings and [[mezzotint]] techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]. His work can be seen in the [[sacristy]] of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the [[Puebla Cathedral]] in 1688. He used Rubens’ brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; [[Juan Rodríguez Juárez]] (1675–1728) and mulatto artist [[Juan Correa]] (1646–1716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, [[José de Ibarra]] (1685–1756) was also mixed-race. One of Mexico's finest painters, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] (1695–1768), was possibly mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700–85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown, eds. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church produced the most important works of the seventeenth century. Among the important painters were [[Baltasar de Echave Ibia]] and his son Baltasar Echave Rioja, also [[Luis Juárez (painter)|Luis Juárez]] and his son [[José Juárez]], [[Juan Correa]], [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], Rodrigo de la Piedra, Antonio de Santander, Polo Bernardino, Juan de Villalobos, Juan Salguero and Juan de Herrera. Juan Correa, worked from 1671 to 1716 and reached great prestige and reputation for the quality of its design and scale of some of his works. Among the best known: 'Apocalypse in the Cathedral of Mexico', 'Conversion of St. Mary Magdalene', now in the 'Pinacoteca Virreinal' and 'Santa Catarina and Adam and Eve casting out of paradise', the latter located in the [[Museo Nacional del Virreinato|National Museum of Viceroyalty]] of [[Tepotzotlán]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia Arte y cultura en la colonia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013144844/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial religious art was sponsored by Church authorities and private patrons. Sponsoring the rich ornamentation of churches was a way for the wealthy to gain prestige.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3" /&gt; In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Mexico City was one of the wealthiest in the world, mostly due to mining and agriculture, and was able to support a large art scene.&lt;ref name="dwarren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=David B. |date=April 2002 |title=The Magazine Antiques |journal=Art Journal |volume=161 |issue=4 |pages=120–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical and Secular Art===
[[File:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|thumb|right|Posthumous portrait of seventeenth-century nun and savante, Sor [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]] by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] 1750.]]

While most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops. Beginning in the late Baroque period, portrait painting of local nobility became a significant genre. Two notable painters of this type are brothers Nicolás and Juan Rodríguez Juárez. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Another type of secular colonial painting is called [[casta]] paintings referring to the depiction of racial hierarchy racially in eighteenth-century [[New Spain]]. Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[José de Ibarra]], [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]], [[Francisco Clapera]], and [[Luis de Mena]], but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mena's only known casta painting links the Virgin of Guadalupe and the casta system, as well as depictions of fruits and vegetables and scenes of everyday life in mideighteenth-century Mexico. It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218–246.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of these paintings stopped after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas", p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;María Concepción García Sáiz, ''Las castas mexicanas: un g´enero pictórico americano''. Milan: Olivetti, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew. ''Casta Paintings: Images of Race in Eighteenth-Century Mexico''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a ''salon de estrado'', to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called ''biombos'' The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;

The Crown promoted the establishment in Mexico of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style of art and architecture, which had become popular in Spain. This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was [[Manuel Tolsá]]. He first taught sculpture at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and then became its second director. Tolsá designed a number of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical buildings]] in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the [[Zócalo]]. As of 2011 it can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt;

Along with the construction of temples and houses artistic religious themes proliferated. In New Spain, as in the rest of the [[New World]], since the seventeenth century, particularly during the eighteenth century, the portrait became an important part of the artistic repertoire. In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it was expected that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145806/http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here he shows a Spanish (español) father, Mestiza (mixed Spanish-Indian) mother, and their Castiza daughter.]]

Some prominent painters of this period are: [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], [[Juan Correa (1646–1716)|Juan Correa]], [[José de Ibarra]], Joseph Mora, Nicolas Rodriguez Juarez, Francisco Martinez, [[Miguel Cabrera]], Andrés López and Nicolás Enríquez. Sebastian Zalcedo painted ca. 1780 a beautiful allegory of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Mexico)|Virgin of Guadalupe]] in oil on copper foil. In this century Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting ''[[La familia del Valle a los pies de la Virgen de Loreto (Josep Antonio de Ayala)|The family of the Valley at the foot of Our Lady of Loreto]]'' c. 1769. This devotional painting was commissioned to be done for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seis Siglos de Arte, Cien Grandes Maestros de Romero|editor-last=de Romero|editor-first=Soumaya Slim|editor-first2=Minerva Mogollan|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first3=Eva Maria|editor-last3=Ayala Canseco|publisher=Fundacion Carso / Museo Soumaya|year=2006|isbn=9789687794303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of colonial art says: ''"In the "Sponsorship of [[Saint Joseph]] on the Caroline College", [[Saint Joseph]] is seen as a major figure of the work, who carries on his left side the child [[Jesus]]. Two archangels flank him and maintain its long purple robe. At the top two little angels are observed with intent to crown the holy". "For centuries, the work was attributed to [[Manuel Caro]], but the meticulous restoration work allowed to find the signature of the original author. Miguel Cabrera"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunicacion.buap.mx/bol_mar08/boletin-d-13mar.html |title=Puebla, Pue. México, Jueves 13 de Marzo de 2008 |website=Comunicacion.buap.mx |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, artists increasingly included the Latin phrase ''[[pinxit]] Mexici'' (painted in Mexico) on works bound for the European market as a sign of pride in their artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Painted in Mexico, 1700–1790: Pinxit Mexici |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/pinxit-mexici |website=www.metmuseum.org |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |quote=This expression eloquently encapsulates the painters' pride in their own tradition and their connection to larger, transatlantic trends.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy of San Carlos===
[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], director of the [[Academy of San Carlos]] by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], director of painting at the Academy]]
The last colonial era art institution established was the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in 1783.&lt;ref name="statesponsored"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253329 |title=State sponsored art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects. The most important of these was the rise of the cult of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] as an American rather than European saint, representative of a distinct identity.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p13"&gt;Rosas, 1982, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the [[Spanish Crown]] to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil.&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt; The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes. These casts are on display in the Academy's central patio.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of San Carlos survived into post-independence Mexico.

==Independence to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, 1821–1911==

===Early Post-independence era the Mid Nineteenth Century===

Artists of the independence era in Mexico (1810–21) produced works showing the insurgency's heroes. A portrait of secular cleric [[José María Morelos]] in his military uniform was painted by an unknown artist. The portrait is typical of those from the late eighteenth century, with framing elements, a formal caption, and new elements being iconography of the emerging Mexican nationalism, including the eagle atop the nopal cactus, which became the central image for the Mexican flag.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Mexican Art and Architecture''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson 2013, pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; Morelos was the subject of a commissioned statue, with [[Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque]], who trained at the Academy of San Carlos and remained an important sculptor through the era of era independence.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico''. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos remained the center of academic painting and the most prestigious art institution in Mexico until the [[Mexican War of Independence]], during which it was closed.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |title= Academia de San Carlos |language= Spanish |accessdate= November 30, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |archivedate= April 9, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its association with the Spanish Crown and European painting tradition, the Academy was reopened by the new government after Mexico gained full independence in 1821. Its former Spanish faculty and students either died during the war or returned to Spain, but when it reopened it attracted the best art students of the country, and continued to emphasize classical European traditions until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253332 |title=Neoclassicism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy was renamed to the National Academy of San Carlos. The new government continued to favor Neoclassical as it considered the Baroque a symbol of colonialism. The Neoclassical style continued in favor through the reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] although President [[Benito Juárez]] supported it only reluctantly, considering its European focus a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

Despite Neoclassicism's association with European domination, it remained favored by the Mexican government after Independence and was used in major government commissions at the end of the century. However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist Manuel Vilar in 1851. In 1887, [[Porfirio Díaz]] commissioned the statue of the last Aztec emperor, [[Cuauhtémoc]], which can be seen on [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. Cuauhtémoc is depicted with a toga-like cloak with a feathered headdress similar to an Etruscan or Trojan warrior rather than an Aztec emperor. The base has elements reminiscent of Mitla and Roman architecture. This base contains bronze plates depicting scenes from the Spanish conquest, but focusing on the indigenous figures.&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit" /&gt;

There were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.&lt;ref name="pazp2"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, the Romantic style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was [[Bavaria]]n artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman [[Daniel Egerton]], who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German [[Carl Nebel]], who primarily created [[lithograph]]s of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.&lt;ref name="foreigntravel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253334 |title=Foreign Travelers |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VelorioJaraDF.JPG|thumb|right|''El Velorio'' by [[José María Jara]] 1889]]
A number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called ''[[Costumbrismo|costumbristas]]'', a word deriving from ''costumbre'' (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was [[Agustín Arrieta]] from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics. His scenes often involved everyday life such as women working in kitchen and depicted black and Afro-Mexican vendors.&lt;ref name="costumbristas"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253335 |title=Costumbristas |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Nineteenth Century to the Revolution===
[[File:NezahualcoyotlGardenTADF.JPG|thumb|180px|A bronze casting (1888–1889) of [[Nezahualcoyotl (tlatoani)|Nezahualcoyotl]], by [[Jesús F. Contreras]] at the Garden of the Triple Alliance, Filomeno Mata street, historical center of Mexico City.]]
[[File:SceneTortureCuautemocMonumentDF.jpg|thumb|[[Cuauhtemoc]]'s torture on a monument to him on the Paseo de la Reforma, by [[Gabriel Guerra]] (1847–1893).]]
In the mid-to late 19th century Latin American academies began to shift away from severe Neoclassicism to “academic realism”. Idealized and simplified depictions became more realistic, with emphasis on details. Scenes in this style were most often portraits of the upper classes, Biblical scenes, and battles—especially those from the Independence period. When the Academy of San Carlos was reopened after a short closure in 1843, its new Spanish and Italian faculty pushed this realist style. Despite government support and nationalist themes, native artists were generally shorted in favor of Europeans.&lt;ref name="realismbrit" /&gt;

One of the most important painters in Mexico in the mid 19th century was Catalan [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who painted landscapes but was best known for his depictions of the intellectual elite of Mexico City. Realist painters also attempted to portray Aztec culture and people by depicting settings inhabited by indigenous people, using live indigenous models and costumes based on those in Conquest era codices. One of these was [[Félix Parra]], whose depictions of the conquest empathized with the suffering of the indigenous. In 1869, José Obregón painted ''The Discovery of Pulque''; he based his depictions of architecture on [[Mixtec]] codices, but misrepresented temples as a setting for a throne.&lt;ref name="realismbrit"&gt;dead link {{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253336 |title=Realism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the 19th century after Independence is considered to have declined, especially during the late 19th century and early 20th, during the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876–1911).  Although during this time, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts were often limited to imitation of European styles,&lt;ref name="tburton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title= Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art |first=Tony |last=Burton |date= March 14, 2008 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of young artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Saturnino Herrán]], increased the focus on Mexican-themed works. This meant that following the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s, Mexican artists made huge strides is forging a robust artistic nationalism.

In this century there are examples of murals such as folkloric style created between 1855 and 1867 in La Barca, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030053129/http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights at this time: Pelegrín Clavé, [[Juan Cordero]], Felipe Santiago Gutiérrez and José Agustín Arrieta.
In Mexico, in 1846 he was hired to direct Pelegrín Clavé's reopening of the Academy of San Carlos, a body from which he promoted the historical and landscaping themes with a pro-European vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015220757/http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Pintura |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos continued to advocate classic, European-style training until 1913. In this year, the academy was partially integrated with [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM). Between 1929 and the 1950s, the academy’s architecture program was split off as a department of the university; the programs in painting, sculpture, and engraving were renamed the National School of Expressive Arts, now the [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]] (ENAP). Both moved to the south of the city in the mid-20th century, to [[Ciudad Universitaria]] and [[Xochimilco]] respectively, leaving only some graduate programs in fine arts in the original academy building in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center]]. ENAP remains one of the main centers for the training of Mexico’s artists.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

===Mexican muralism and Revolutionary art===
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 6 063.jpg|thumb|Detail of mural "Gente y paisaje de Michoacán" at the Palacio de Gobierno in [[Michoacán]] (1962)]]
{{Further|Mexican muralism}}

While a shift to more indigenous and Mexican themes appeared in the 19th century, the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920 had a dramatic effect on Mexican art.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt; The conflict resulted in the rise of the Partido Revolucionario Nacional (renamed the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]]), which took the country in a socialist direction. The government became an ally to many of the intellectuals and artists in Mexico City&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; and commissioned murals for public buildings to reinforce its political messages including those that emphasized Mexican rather than European themes. These were not created for popular or commercial tastes; however, they gained recognition not only in Mexico, but in the United States.&lt;ref name="pazp24"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This production of art in conjunction with government propaganda is known as the Mexican Modernist School or the Mexican Muralist Movement, and it redefined art in Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp298299"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavio Paz gives [[José Vasconcelos]] credit for initiating the Muralist movement in Mexico by commissioning the best-known painters in 1921 to decorate the walls of public buildings. The commissions were politically motivated—they aimed to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and redefine the Mexican people vis-à-vis their indigenous and Spanish past.&lt;ref name="pazp11"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these commissioned paintings were at [[San Ildefonso College|San Ildefonso]] done by Fernando Leal, [[Fermín Revueltas]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Diego Rivera]]. The first true fresco in the building was the work of [[Jean Charlot]]. However, technical errors were made in the construction of these murals: a number of them began to blister and were covered in wax for preservation.&lt;ref name="pazp12"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Montenegro]] painted the [[San Pedro y San Pablo College (Museum of Light)|former church and monastery of San Pedro y San Pablo]], but the mural in the church was painted in [[tempera]] and began to flake. In the monastery area, Montenegro painted the ''Feast of the Holy Cross,'' which depicts Vasconcelos as the protector of Muralists. Vasconcelos was later blanked out and a figure of a woman was painted over him.&lt;ref name="pazp1213"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first protagonist in the production of modern murals in Mexico was [[Dr. Atl]]. Dr Atl was born “Gerard Murillo” in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexico's folk art and handcrafts]]. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting.&lt;ref name="tburton" /&gt;

The muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and Fernando Leal. It is the most studied part of Mexico's art history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alee"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Anthony |date=Spring 1999 |title= Mexican murals and their meaning |journal=Art Journal |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were artists trained in classical European techniques and many of their early works are imitations of then-fashionable European paintings styles, some of which were adapted to Mexican themes.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp298299" /&gt; The political situation in Mexico from the 1920s to 1950s and the influence of Dr. Atl prompted these artists to break with European traditions, using bold indigenous images, lots of color, and depictions of human activity, especially of the masses, in contrast to the solemn and detached art of Europe.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;

Preferred mediums generally excluded traditional canvases and church porticos and instead were the large, then-undecorated walls of Mexico's government buildings. The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students.&lt;ref name="pazp24" /&gt;

These muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of [[pyroxilin]], a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of [[Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico). This four-year project went on to incorporate other contemporary indigenous themes, and it eventually encompassed 124 frescoes that extended three stories high and two city blocks long.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The [[Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market, Mexico City|Abelardo Rodriguez Market]] was painted in 1933 by students of Diego Rivera, one of whom was [[Isamu Noguchi]].&lt;ref name="pazp16"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure of this time period was [[Frida Kahlo]], the wife of Diego Rivera. While she painted canvases instead of murals, she is still considered part of the Mexican Modernist School as her work emphasized Mexican folk culture and colors.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dgoddard"&gt;{{cite news |title= enfoque ; Artistic update ; Mexican art featured at Blue Star and the Instituto de Mexico |first= Dan R. |last= Goddard |newspaper=Conexion |location=San Antonio, Texas |date=May 20, 2004 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's self-portraits during the 1930s and 40s were in stark contrast to the lavish murals artists like her husband were creating at the time. Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism. 

Her paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with “hopeful” blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it.

Although she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954.  Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meade |first=Teresa |title=The History of Modern Latin America |year=2016 |pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling Mexican art abroad===
Despite maintaining an active national art scene, Mexican artists after the muralist period had a difficult time breaking into the international art market. One reason for this is that in the Americas, Mexico City was replaced by New York as the center of the art community, especially for patronage.&lt;ref name="pazp25"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mexico, government sponsorship of art in the 20th century (dominated until 2000 by the PRI party) meant religious themes and criticism of the government were effectively censored. This was mostly passive, with the government giving grants to artists who conformed to their requirements.&lt;ref name="rgallop11" /&gt;

===Other Artistic Expressions 1920–1950===
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|300px|''Mexico de Hoy'' by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]]]
The first to break with the nationalistic and political tone of the muralist movement was [[Rufino Tamayo]]. For this reason he was first appreciated outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp2425"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamayo was a contemporary to Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco, and trained at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. Like them he explored Mexican identity in his work after the Mexican Revolution. However, he rejected the political Social Realism popularized by the three other artists and was rejected by the new establishment.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

He left for New York in 1926 where success allowed him to exhibit in his native Mexico. His lack of support for the post-Revolutionary government was controversial. Because of this he mostly remained in New York, continuing with his success there and later in Europe. His rivalry with the main three Mexican muralists continued both in Mexico and internationally through the 1950s. Even a belated honorific of “The Fourth Great One” was controversial.&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican Master |author= Carlos Suarez De Jesus |url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-07-05/culture/mexican-master/full |newspaper=Miami New Times |location=Miami |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Wolfgang Paalen]] published the extremely influential ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'' magazine in Mexico City, which focussed on a transitional movement between surrealism to abstract expressionism.

In 1953, [[Museo Experimental El Eco]] (in Mexico City) opened; it was created by [[Mathias Goeritz]].

===The Rupture Movement===

[[File:Murayl y tempusfugit.jpg|thumb|160px|A mural and clock sculpture by [[Manuel Felguerez]] at [[Universidad La Salle]], Campus central.]]
The first major movement after the muralists was the [[Generación de la Ruptura|Rupture Movement]], which began in the 1950s and 1960s with painters such as [[José Luis Cuevas]], Gilberto Navarro, [[Rafael Coronel]], Alfredo Casaneda, and sculptor [[Juan Soriano]]. They rejected social realism and nationalism and incorporated surrealism, visual paradoxes, and elements of Old World painting styles.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rfajardo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fajardo |first=Renee |date=September 10, 2003 |title= Miradas Del Arte Mexicano; A modern perspective on contemporary Mexican art |journal=La Voz Bilinguë |page=25 |location=Denver, Colorado }}&lt;/ref&gt; This break meant that later Mexican artists were generally not influenced by muralism or by Mexican folk art.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;

José Luis Cuevas created self-portraits in which he reconstructed scenes from famous paintings by Spanish artists such as [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and [[Picasso]]. Like Kahlo before him, he drew himself but instead of being centered, his image is often to the side, as an observer. The goal was to emphasize the transformation of received visual culture.&lt;ref name="trends1950"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253344 |title=Trends 1950–1970 |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure during this time period was Swiss-Mexican [[Gunther Gerzso]], but his work was a “hard-edged variant”{{cite quote|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Is this is a quotation from a critic, or "scare-quotes"?--&gt; of Abstract Expressionism, based on clearly defined geometric forms as well as colors, with an effect that makes them look like low relief. His work was a mix of European abstraction and Latin American influences, including Mesoamerican ones.&lt;ref name="trends1950" /&gt;&lt;ref name="violencia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Opinion invitada/ Gunther Gerzso/Gunther Gerzso: una violencia metaforica |first=Cuauhtemoc |last=Medina |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=April 3, 2000 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Invited opinion/Gunther Gerzo:metaphoric violence }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[watercolor]] field we can distinguish [[Edgardo Coghlan]] and [[Ignacio Barrios]] who were not aligned to a specific artistic movement but were not less important.

===The Olympics in Mexico City (1968); later===
"Designed by [[Mathias Goeritz]], a series of sculptures ... [lined] the "Route of Friendship" ([[Ruta de la Amistad]]) in celebration of the Olympics ... In contestation to the government-sanctioned artistic exhibition for the Olympics, a group of diverse, independent visual artists organize a counterpresentation entitled ''[[Salón Independiente]]'', or ''Independent Salon''; the exhibition signifies a key event in the resistance by artists of state-controlled cultural policies. This show of antigovernment efforts by artists would also be expressed in a mural in support of student movement's protests; the work became known as the ''Mural Efímero'' (or ''Ephemeral Mural'')" at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXV"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M.

Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Independent Salon was staged in 1970. In 1976 "[[Fernando Gambao]] spearheads the organization of an exposition of abstract art entitled ''El Geometrismo Mexicano Una Tendencia Actual''".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXVI"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXVI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"In an attempt to reassess ... post-1968 Mexican art, the Museum of Science and Art at UNAM" organized in 2007, the exhibition ''La Era de la Discrepancia. Arte y cultura visual en México 1968-1997''
&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXXIII"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXXIII}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990 the exhibition ''Mexico: Esplendor de Treinta Siglos'', started its world tour at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

===Neo-expressionism===
From the 1960s to the 1980s [[Neo-expressionist]] art was represented in Mexico by [[Manuel Felguerez]], Teresa Cito, Alejandro Pinatado, and [[Jan Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huella"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Felguerez: La huella de su arte |first=Leticia |last=Sanchez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=July 11, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Felguerez:The mark of his art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss-German artist, [[Mathias Goeritz]], in the 1950s created public sculptures including the ''Torres Satélite'' in [[Ciudad Satélite]]. In the 1960s, he became central to the development of abstract and other modern art along with [[José Luis Cuevas]] and [[Pedro Friedeberg]].&lt;ref name="rogallery"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rogallery.com/Goeritz_Mathias/goeritz-biography.html |title= Mathias Goeritz, German-Mexican (1915–1990) |publisher= RO Gallery |location=Mexico City |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neomexicanismo===
In the mid-1980s, the next major movement in Mexico was Neomexicanismo, a slightly surreal, somewhat kitsch and postmodern version of Social Realism that focused on popular culture rather than history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The name ''neomexicanismo'' was originally used by critics to belittle the movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Works were not necessarily murals: they used other mediums such as collage and often parodied and allegorized cultural icons, mass media, religion, and other aspects of Mexican culture. This generation of artists were interested in traditional Mexican values and exploring their roots—often questioning or subverting them. Another common theme was Mexican culture vis-à-vis globalization.&lt;ref name="artmod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mam.org.mx/exposiciones/actuales/376-ineomexicanismos-ficciones-identitarias-en-el-mexico-de-los-ochenta |title=¿Neomexicanismos?

===Postmodern===
Art from the 1990s to the present is roughly categorized as Postmodern, although this term has been used to describe works created before the 1990s. Major artists associated with this label include [[Betsabeé Romero]],&lt;ref name="nunes"&gt;{{cite news |title= ART IN REVIEW; Betsabee Romero |first=Ken |last=Johnson |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/arts/art-in-review-betsabee-romero.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |date=July 28, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Castillo]], [[Francisco Larios]],&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt; Martha Chapa and Diego Toledo.&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;

The success of Mexican artists is demonstrated by their inclusion in galleries in New York, London, and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name="rgallop10"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art collections and galleries===
In 1974 Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil (MACG), a gallery and museum, opened.

[[Museo Tamayo de Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1981. The [[Museo Nacional de Arte|National Museum of Art]] (MUNAL) opened in 1982.

[[Centro Cultural Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1986, now defunct. "In 1998 ... with the sudden death of its chief executive, [[Televisa]] closed ... [the gallery] for a time, as the turnover in the company coincided with a drastic drop in the company's profitability".

In 1994, the foundation behind [[Colección Jumex]] and its collection of contemporary art, was established; it's located in the industrial outskirts of Mexico City.&lt;ref name="Zaragozaxxx"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M.

[[Kurimanzutto]]—a private gallery was founded in 1999.&lt;ref name="rgallop11"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 the [[Museo Dolores Olmedo|Olmedo Museum]]&lt;ref name="Zaragoza51"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M.

In 1996 the [[Jacques Gelman|Gelman collection]] was donated to [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] (in New York); part of the Gelmans' collection is on display in the [[Cuernavaca#Museo Muros|Muros Museum]] in [[Cuernavaca]].

[[Museo Universitario Arte Contemporáneo]] (MUAC) opened in 2008.

Private art exhibition is concentrated  to major urban centers, in particular [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Léon]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Oaxaca City]] and [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="Zaragoza51"/&gt;

===Art criticism===
[[Octavio Mercado]] said in 2012 that the activity of art criticism still can be found in specialized magazines and nationally disseminated newspapers; furthermore, a new generation of art critics include [[Daniela Wolf]], [[Ana Elena Mallet]], [[Gabriella Gómez-Mont]], and [[Pablo Helguera]].
&lt;ref name="Zaragoza59"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M. Saragoza, Ana Paula Ambrosi, Silvia D. Zárate, Alex M. Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Prior to that, claims were made in 2004, that a deficit of native writing about Mexican art, symbolism, and trends, resulted in modern Mexican art shown abroad having been mislabeled or poorly described, as foreign institutions do not sufficiently understand or appreciate the political and social circumstances behind the pieces.&lt;ref name="rgallop13"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;)

==21st century==

[[File:Mexican Street Artist.jpg|thumb|Mexican artist creating an ephemeral work of [[street art]] in chalk on the streets of the Historical Center of Mexico City]]
Just like many other parts in the world, Mexico has adopted some modern techniques like with the existence of street artists depicting popular paintings from Mexico throughout history or original content.

===Modern Mexican visual artists===

==Popular arts and handcrafts==
{{Main|Mexican handcrafts and folk art}}
[[File:Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos votive 1920 1922.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ex-voto]] painting from the early 1920s honoring Our Lady of [[San Juan de los Lagos]].]]
[[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]], called ''artesanía'' in Mexico, is a complex category of items made by hand or in small workshops for utilitarian, decorative, or other purposes. These include ceramics, wall hangings, certain types of paintings, and textiles.&lt;ref name="mexpopart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |title= Mexican Popular Arts |accessdate= 2009-11-28 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005022/http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |archivedate= 2010-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the more formal arts, artesanía has both indigenous and European roots and is considered a valued part of Mexico's ethnic heritage.&lt;ref name="pomar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/interior/index.php?idNota=4038&amp;p=nota |title=Centenaria presencia de las artesanías |first=Maria Teresa |last=Pomar |date=Nov–Dec 1999 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=100 years of arts and crafts |accessdate=2009-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This linking among the arts and cultural identity was most strongly forged by the country's political, intellectual, and artistic elite in the first half of the 20th century, after the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], and [[Frida Kahlo]] used artesanía as inspiration for a number of their murals and other works.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Unlike the fine arts, artesanía is created by common people and those of indigenous heritage, who learn their craft through formal or informal apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The linking of artesanía and Mexican identity continues through television, movies, and tourism promotion.&lt;ref name="iturbe"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Iturbe |first1=Mercedes |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Folk Art Aesthetics and Poetry in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the artesanía produced in Mexico consists of ordinary things made for daily use. They are considered artistic because they contain decorative details or are painted in bright colors, or both.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The bold use of colors in crafts and other constructions extends back to pre-Hispanic times. These were joined by other colors introduced by European and Asian contact, always in bold tones.&lt;ref name="aprahamian1112"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |pages=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design motifs vary from purely indigenous to mostly European with other elements thrown in. Geometric designs connected to Mexico's pre-Hispanic past are prevalent, and items made by the country's remaining purely indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="aprahamian31"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs from nature are popular, possibly more so than geometric patterns in both pre-Hispanic and European designs. They are especially prevalent in wall-hangings and ceramics.&lt;ref name="aprahamian36"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best of Mexico's handcrafts is [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]] produced in [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It has a mix of Chinese, Arab, Spanish, and indigenous design influences.&lt;ref name="delpaso"&gt;{{cite book |last1= del Paso |first1=Fernando |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Form and Color in the Manual Arts of Mexico in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=245–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known folk paintings are the ''ex-voto'' or ''[[retablo]]'' [[Votive paintings of Mexico|votive paintings]]. These are small commemorative paintings or other artwork created by a believer, honoring the intervention of a saint or other figure. The untrained style of ex-voto painting was appropriated during the mid-20th century by Kahlo, who believed they were the most authentic expression of Latin American art.&lt;ref name="trends1970"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253345 |title=Trends 1970-present |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==
{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}
[[File:Francisco Villa.gif|right|thumb|Iconic image of [[Pancho Villa]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]], a publicity still taken by Mutual Film Corporation photographer John Davidson Wheelan, January 1914.&lt;ref name="John Mraz 2012, pp. 246-47"&gt;[[John Mraz]], ''Photographing the Mexican Revolution'', Austin: University of Texas Press 2012, pp. 246-47. Inv. #287647. Fondo Casasola. SINAFO-Fototeca Nacional de INAH.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Cinema in Mexico|Cinematography]] came to Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]] from the U.S. and France. It was initially used to document the battles of the war. Revolutionary general [[Pancho Villa]] himself starred in some silent films.  In 2003, [[HBO]] broadcast ''[[And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself]]'', with Antonio Banderas as Villa; the film focuses on the making of the film ''[[The Life of General Villa]]''.  Villa consciously used cinema to shape his public image.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Mistron. "The Role of Pancho Villa in the Mexican and American Cinema." ''Studies in Latin American Popular Culture'' 2:1-13 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sound film in Mexico was made in 1931, called ''Desde Santa''. The first Mexican film genre appeared between 1920 and 1940, called ''ranchero''.&lt;ref name="truax"&gt;{{cite news |title=El Cine Mexicano Vuelve a Brillar |first=Eileen |last=Truax |newspaper=La Opinion |location=Los Angeles |date=January 29, 2007 |pages=1A, 16A |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican Cinema Shines Again }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema]] is regarded as the 1940s and 1950s, two films from the mid to late 1930s, ''Allá en el Rancho Grande'' (1936) and ''Vamanos con Pancho Villa'' (1935), set the standard of this age thematically, aesthetically, and ideologically. These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to [[Carlos Monsiváis]], includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine ''[[charro]]s'' of ranchero films, [[femme fatale]]s (often played by [[María Félix]] and [[Dolores del Río]]), the indigenous peoples of [[Emilio Fernández]]’s films, and [[Cantinflas]]’s ''peladito'' (urban miscreant).&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;

Settings were often ranches, the battlefields of the Revolution, and [[cabaret]]s. Movies about the Mexican Revolution focused on the initial overthrow of the [[Porfirio Díaz]] government rather than the fighting among the various factions afterwards. They also tended to focus on rural themes as “Mexican”, even though the population was increasingly urban.&lt;ref name="strayer"&gt;Strayer, 2009 p.7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico had two advantages in filmmaking during this period. The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as [[María Félix]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Armendáriz]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Cantinflas]], and directors such as [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez]] and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]]. Many of these starts had success in the United States and at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=Christine |year=1994 |title= Cinema renaissance: Mexican films captivate world audiences |journal=Business Mexico |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the corner of La Brea and [[Hollywood Boulevard]], there is a sculpture of four women who represent the four pillars of the cinema industry, one of whom is Mexican actress [[Dolores del Rio]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Gabriel Figueroa is known for black-and-white camerawork that is generally stark and expressionist, with simple but sophisticated camera movement.&lt;ref name="roads"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Alex |date=November 1995 |title=Roads to the south: In praise of Mexican cinema |journal=Film Comment |volume=31 |issue=6 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second advantage was that Mexico was not heavily involved in the [[Second World War]], and therefore had a greater supply of celluloid for films, then also used for bombs.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

[[File:Bird of Paradise (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|A scene from ''Bird of Paradise'' (1932) with [[Dolores del Río]].]]
In the 1930s, the government became interested in the industry in order to promote cultural and political values. Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematográfico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt; While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

The Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from [[lucha libre]]. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; Director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with ''Reed: Insurgent Mexico'' (1971) followed by a biography of [[Frida Kahlo]] called ''Frida'' (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed ''Latino Bar'' (1991) and ''Dollar Mambo'' (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

In the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was Arturo Ripstein Jr.. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called ''Tiempo de morir'' in 1965 and who some consider the successor to [[Luis Buñuel]] who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include ''El Castillo de la pureza'' (1973), ''Lugar sin limites'' (1977) and ''La reina de la noche'' (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;
State censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

Another factor was that many Mexican film making facilities were taken over by Hollywood production companies in the 1980s, crowding out local production.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; The quality of films was so diminished that for some of these years,{{which|date=January 2012}} [[Ariel Award|Mexico's Ariel film award]] was suspended for lack of qualifying candidates.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Popular filmmaking decreased but the art sector grew, sometimes producing works outside the view of censors such as [[Jorge Fons]]’ 1989 film ''Rojo Amanecer'' on the [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 Tlatelolco massacre]]. The movie was banned by the government but received support in Mexico and abroad. The film was shown although not widely.{{elucidate|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Shown where? In Mexico? I thought it was banned. From whom did it receive support?--&gt; It was the beginning of more editorial freedom for filmmakers in Mexico.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, Mexican cinema began to make a comeback, mostly through co-production with foreign interests. One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|''Como Agua Para Chocolate'']] (''Like Water for Chocolate'').&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt; Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as ''Pueblo de Madera'', ''La Vida Conjugal'', and ''Angel de fuego''. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include ''Solo con tu Pareja'', ''La Invencion de Cronos'' along with ''Como Agua para Chocolate''.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Mexico's newest generation of successful directors includes [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. Films include ''[[Children of Men|Cuarón/Children of Men]]'' filmed in England and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth|El Laberinto del Fauno]]'', which was a Mexican/Spanish production. Film professionals in the early 21st century tend to be at least bilingual (Spanish and English) and are better able to participate in the global market for films than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

==Photography in Mexico==
[[File:MetlacBridgeKahlo.JPG|thumb|300px|An image of the Metlac Bridge, taken by [[Guillermo Kahlo]].]]
Photography came to Mexico in the form of [[daguerreotype]] about six months after its discovery, and it spread quickly. It was initially used for portraits of the wealthy (because of its high cost), and for shooting landscapes and pre-Hispanic ruins.&lt;ref name="monroy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/hitoria-de-la-fotografia-en-mexico.html |title= Historia de la Fotografía en México |first=Rebeca |last=Monroy Nasr |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of Mexican photography |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another relatively common type of early photographic portraits were those of recently deceased children, called ''little angels,'' which persisted into the first half of the 20th century. This custom derived from a Catholic tradition of celebrating a dead child's immediate acceptance into heaven, bypassing purgatory. This photography replaced the practice of making drawings and other depictions of them as this was considered a “happy occasion.”&lt;ref name="sleeping"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marino |first1=Daniela |date=Summer 1997 |title= Prayer for a sleeping child: Iconography of the funeral ritual of little angels in Mexico |journal= The Journal of American Culture |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=37–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.1997.2002_37.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal portraits were the most common form of commercial photography through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

Modern photography in Mexico did not begin as an art form, but rather as documentation, associated with periodicals and government projects. It dates to the [[Porfirio Díaz]] period of rule, or the ''Porfiriato'', from the late 19th century to 1910.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1086-the-legacy-of-agustin-victor-casasola-photographer-1874-1938 |title= The legacy of Agustin Victor Casasola (Photographer 1874–1938) |author=Rita Pomade |date=June 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn= 1028-9089 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp7"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece. This image was European-based with some indigenous elements for distinction.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp24"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylized images of the indigenous during the Porfirato were principally done by Ybañez y Sora in the [[costumbrista]] painting style, which was popular outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; The most important Porfirian era photographer was [[Guillermo Kahlo]], who worked with associate Hugo Brehme.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; Kahlo established his own studio in the first decade of the 1900s and was hired by businesses and the government to document architecture, interiors, landscapes, and factories.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp35"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo's style reflected the narratives of the period, solely focusing on major constructions and events, and avoiding the common populace.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp37"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; It avoided subjects that hinted at the political instability of the country at the time, such as [[strike action]]s.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp26"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; One major Kahlo project was the Photographic Inventory of Spanish Colonial Church Architecture in Mexico (1910), which consisted of twenty five albums sponsored by the federal government to document the remaining colonial architecture.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp25"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's photography was used to link Mexico's past to its progress with political and social power provided in symbols and ideals, as well to link the government's aspirations with its colonial and pre-Hispanic past.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp34"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decena trágica.JPG|thumb|300px|A scene from the [[Decena Trágica]], February 1913, from the [[Agustín Casasola]] archives.]]
Another pioneer of Mexican photography was [[Agustín Casasola|Agustín Victor Casasola]]. Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as [[Francisco Villa]]) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

His work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in [[Pachuca]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Kahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist—especially not Casasolas—who thought of himself as a historian in the [[Positivism|Positivist]] tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1825"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was [[Pictorialism]], in which images had a romantic or dream-like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American [[Edward Weston]] broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title= Edward Weston: Pictorialist Pioneer |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2003 |pages=62–65 s }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Weston and his Italian assistant [[Tina Modotti]] were in Mexico from 1923 to 1926, allying themselves with Mexican Realist photographers [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]] as well as muralists such as [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]]. These photographers' political and social aspirations matched those of the muralist movement and the new post-Revolution government.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1718"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariana Yampolsky]], originally from the U.S., became an important photographer in Mexico.  Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt; This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an “authentic” and distinct Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp910"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp27"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centro-fotografico-in-oaxaca-founded-by-toledo.jpg|thumb|[[Centro Fotográfico Álvarez Bravo]] at the [[Institute of Graphic Arts of Oaxaca]].]]

Manuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes.&lt;ref name="aalonso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico en imagenes |first=Alejandro |last=Alonso |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 13, 1997 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico in images }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These post-Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by [[Nacho López]] and [[Héctor García Cobos|Hector Garcia]], best known for their photography of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student uprising of 1968]].&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

During the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del [[INAH]], and the publication ''Luna Córnea''.&lt;ref name="grandes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los 13 grandes de la fotografía mexicana |first=Yanet |last=Aguilar Sosa |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sociedad/3014.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The 13 greats of Mexican photography }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} He has published a number of books including ''México Tenochtitlan'' and ''Tepito, Bravo el Barrio''. Eniac Martínez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a “shadowing and dark world”, focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents.&lt;ref name="grandes" /&gt; The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is [[Javier Orozco]] who specializes in interiors.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

However, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by Daniela Rossell featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lamé wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.&lt;ref name="rgallop47"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Moshe Idel''' ({{lang-he-n|משה אידל}}) is a Romanian born historian and philosopher of Jewish mysticism. He is Emeritus Max Cooper Professor in Jewish Thought at the [[Hebrew University]], Jerusalem, and a Senior Researcher at the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]].

==Life and scholarship==
{{Kabbalah}}
{{Jewish philosophy}}
Born in [[Târgu Neamț]], [[Romania]], in 1947, Idel was a precocious child, with a passion for reading which made him read all the books in the town, cooperative, then High school Library, in addition to buying more books with the money earned by singing at weddings.&lt;ref name="idee.ro"&gt;http://www.idee.ro/jewish_heritage_2/targu_neamt.html#C05&lt;/ref&gt;
Although the [[The Holocaust|Holocaust]] did not directly affect the Jewish population of Târgu Neamț, they were affected by the so-called [[World War II evacuation and expulsion|“population displacements”]]. In 1963 he immigrated with his family to Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Garb, Jonathan (2007). "Moshe Idel." ''Encyclopaedia Judaica''. 2nd ed. Macmillan Reference USA. Retrieved via ''Biography in Context'' database, 2016-12-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Enrolled at the [[Hebrew University]], he studied under [[Gershom Scholem]]. After earning his doctorate with a thesis on [[Abraham Abulafia]], he eventually succeeded [[Gershom Scholem|Scholem]] to the chair of Jewish Thought.  He has served as visiting Professor at the [[Jewish Theological Seminary of America]], [[UCLA]], [[Yale University|Yale]], [[Harvard]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], [[University of Pennsylvania]] and the [[Collège de France]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nyutikvah.org/fellows/moshe_idel.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Idel has undertaken a systematic revision of the history and analysis of [[Jewish mysticism]]. His explorations of the mythical, theurgical, mystical, and messianic dimensions of Judaism have been attentive to history, sociology, and anthropology, while rejecting a naïve historicist approach to Judaism.&lt;ref name="brill.com"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.brill.com/products/book/moshe-idel|title=Moshe Idel: Representing God|author=|date=6 October 2014|website=brill.com|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
His 1988 work, ''Kabbalah: New Perspectives'' ([[Yale University Press]]), is said to have revolutionised [[Kabbalah]] studies.&lt;ref name="Mopsik"&gt;[[Charles Mopsik]], ''Moshé Idel, lauréat du prix Israël'', Association Charles Mopsik, en ligne&lt;/ref&gt; His historical and phenomenological studies of rabbinic, philosophic, kabbalistic, and Hasidic texts have transformed the understanding of Jewish intellectual history and highlighted the close relationship between magic, mysticism, and liturgy.&lt;ref name="brill.com"/&gt;

==Awards==
In 1999, Idel was awarded the [[Israel Prize]] for excellent achievement in the field of Jewish philosophy, and in 2002 the [[The EMET Prize for Art, Science and Culture|EMET Prize]] for Jewish Thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hartman.org.il/Faculty_View.asp?faculty_id=39&amp;Cat_Id=333&amp;Cat_Type=About|title=Faculty - Shalom Hartman Institute|first=Shalom Hartman|last=Institute|date=|website=hartman.org.il|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, he received the [[Koret Jewish Book Award|Koret Award]] for Jewish philosophy for his book ''Absorbing Perfections''.&lt;ref name="idee.ro"/&gt; He has been conferred [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorates]] by the universities of [[Yale University|Yale]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Budapest University|Budapest]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[University of Haifa|Haifa]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.haifa.ac.il/~focus/2003-autumn/05hondocs.html|title=Focus Newspaper - Autumn 2003|author=|date=|website=research.haifa.ac.il|accessdate=16 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Babeș-Bolyai University|Cluj]],{{cn|date=September 2016}} [[Alexandru Ioan Cuza University|Iasi]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.agerpres.ro/english/2010/12/17/professor-moshe-idel-phd-doctor-honoris-causa-of-alexandru-ioan-cuza-university-of-iasi-12-56-17&lt;/ref&gt; and [[University of Bucharest|Bucharest]].{{cn|date=September 2016}}

'''N-philes''' are group of [[radical (chemistry)|radical]] molecules which are specifically attracted to the [[Carbon–nitrogen bond|C=N bonds]], defying often the selectivity rules of [[electrophilic]] attack. N-philes can often masquerade as electrophiles, where [[acyl]] radicals are excellent examples which interact with [[Pi electrons]] of aryl groups.

'''Necrofauna''' are species that were previously [[extinct]] and have been biologically revived or recreated by the process of [[de-extinction]].

Necrofauna are proxies or imitations of their former species and not identical replicas. Due to a number of technological, biological and environmental factors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/03/20/science/revive-restore-extinct-species-dna-mammoth-passenger-pigeon.html|title=We Might Soon Resurrect Extinct Species. Is It Worth the Cost?|last=Yin|first=Steph|date=2017-03-20|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are considered a new type organism altogether. [[De-extinction|Revive and Restore]], a nonprofit organization that supports pursuing de-extinction research with transparency to the public, describes the creation of necrofauna as a result of “transfer[ing] the [[gene]]s that define the extinct species into the [[genome]] of the related species, effectively converting it into a living version of the extinct creature."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://reviverestore.org/what-we-do/genetic-rescue/|title=What is Genetic Rescue? – Revive &amp; Restore|date=2013-09-27|work=Revive &amp; Restore|access-date=2017-06-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the existence of necrofauna is still largely [[Hypothesis|hypothetical]], a [[Pyrenean ibex]] was the first and only animal to have undergone the de-extinction process with moderate success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2009/02/090210-bucardo-clone_2.html|title=First Extinct-Animal Clone Created|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2017-06-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "unextinct" or revived animal was born, but then died several minutes later due to a lung defect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Piña-Aguilar|first=Raul E.|last2=Lopez-Saucedo|first2=Janet|last3=Sheffield|first3=Richard|last4=Ruiz-Galaz|first4=Lilia I.|last5=de J.

Necrofauna and the de-extinction movement are highly [[Controversy|controversial]] within [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] and scientific circles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Minteer|first=Ben|date=2014-05-15|title=Is it right to reverse extinction?|url=https://www.nature.com/news/is-it-right-to-reverse-extinction-1.15212|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=509|issue=7500|pages=261–261|doi=10.1038/509261a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many conservationists argue that creating necrofauna could potentially distract from the urgency of saving [[endangered species]] that are still alive. Concerns have also been raised pertaining to the possible damaging impacts [[ecology]] could face in the wake of introducing a new species into an environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=Alexandre|last2=Thévenin|first2=Charles|last3=Princé|first3=Karine|last4=Sarrazin|first4=François|last5=Clavel|first5=Joanne|date=2017-05-01|title=De-extinction and evolution|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1365-2435.12723/abstract|journal=Functional Ecology|language=en|volume=31|issue=5|pages=1021–1031|doi=10.1111/1365-2435.12723|issn=1365-2435}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The term ''necrofauna'' is a [[portmanteau]] consisting of two [[morphemes]]. The first morpheme, “necro,” comes from the Greek prefix [[wikt:necro-#Prefix|''necro'']], meaning death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=necro-|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/necr-|website=Merriam Webstar|publisher=Merriam Webster Incorporated|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; “[[Fauna]],” meanwhile, refers to the animals that inhabit a particular time period or environment and is derived from the Greek name [[Fauna (deity)|''Fauna'']], the Roman goddess of earth and fertility.

[[Alex Steffen]] is referred to as the first person to coin the [[neologism]] “necrofauna” in Jason Mark’s ''[[Earth Island Institute|Earth Island Journal]]'' article titled “Back From the Dead.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mark|first1=Jason|title=Back From the Dead|journal=Earth Island Journal|date=September 3, 2013|issue=Autumn 2013|url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/eij/article/back_from_the_dead/|accessdate=28 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word was used in the context of describing the phenomenon of "charismatic necrofauna," which expresses the possibility that only certain charismatic species may be chosen as candidates for de-extinction based on human preferences, or that such resurrection efforts could distract from helping less "charismatic" species that are currently endangered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13355">'''Organizational ecology''' (also '''organizational demography''' and the '''population ecology of organizations''') is a theoretical and empirical approach in the [[social sciences]] that is considered a sub-field of [[organizational studies]].  Organizational ecology utilizes insights from [[biology]], [[economics]],&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;[[Douma, Sytse]] and [[Hein Schreuder]], 2013. "Economic Approaches to Organizations". 5th edition. London: Pearson [http://catalogue.pearsoned.co.uk/educator/product/Economic-Approaches-to-Organisations/9780273735298.page] {{ISBN|0273735292}} • {{ISBN|9780273735298}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and [[sociology]], and employs statistical analysis to try to understand the conditions under which organizations emerge, grow, and die.

The ecology of organizations is divided into three levels, the community, the population, and the organization. The community level is the functionally integrated system of interacting populations. The population level is the set of organizations engaged in similar activities. The organization level focuses on the individual organizations (some research further divides organizations into individual member and sub-unit levels&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Hannan, M., &amp; Freeman, J. (1977). The population ecology of organizations. ''American Journal of Sociology 82''(5), 929-964.&lt;/ref&gt;).

What is generally referred to as organizational ecology in research is more accurately population ecology, focusing on the second level.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Baum, J., &amp; Shipilov, A. (2006). Ecological approaches to organizations. In S. Clegg, C. Hardy, T. Lawrence, &amp; W. Nord (Eds.) ''The Sage handbook of organization studies'' (pp. 55-110.) London: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development  ==

Wharton School researcher William Evan called the population level the ''organization-set'', and focused on the interrelations of individual organizations within the population as early as 1966.&lt;ref&gt;Evan, W. (1966). "The organization-set" in J. Thompson (ed.) ''Approaches to Organizational Design''. Pittsburgh, PA: University of Pittsburgh Press.&lt;/ref&gt; However, prior to the mid-1970s, the majority of organizational studies research focused on adaptive change in organizations (See also [[adaptive management]] and [[adaptive performance]]). The ecological approach moved focus to the environmental selection processes that affect organizations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1976, Eric Trist defined population ecology as "the study of the organizational field created by a number of organizations whose interrelations compose a system at the level of the whole field". He also advocated for organizational studies research to focus on populations and individual organizations as part of open rather than closed systems that have both bureaucratic (internal) regulation and ecological (community environment) regulation (see also [[Open and closed systems in social science]]).&lt;ref&gt;Trist, E. (1977). A Concept of Organizational Ecology. ''Australian Journal of Management 2''(2),  161-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first explicit formulation of a theory of population ecology, by [[Michael T. Hannan]] and the late [[John H. Freeman]] in their 1977 ''[[American Journal of Sociology]]'' piece "The population ecology of organizations" and later refined in their 1989 book ''[[Organizational Ecology]]'', examines the environment in which organizations compete and how a process like [[natural selection]] occurs.  This theory looks at the death of organizations (firm mortality), the birth of new organizations (organizational founding), as well as organizational growth and change.

Organizational ecology has over the years become one of the central fields in [[organizational studies]], and is known for its empirical, quantitative character. Ecological studies usually have a large-scale, longitudinal focus (datasets often span several decades, sometimes even centuries). The books ''The Demography of Corporations and Industries'' by Glenn Carroll and Michael Hannan (2000) and ''Logics of Organization Theory: Audiences, Codes, and Ecologies'' by Michael Hannan, Laszlo Polos, and Glenn Carroll (2007), provide the most comprehensive overview of the various theories and methods in organizational ecology.

== Key concerns ==
Organizational ecology focuses on how social (community) forces affect:
* rates of creation of new organizational forms
* rates of demise of organizations and organizational forms
* the rates of change in organizational forms.&lt;ref&gt;Singh, J., &amp; Lumsden, C. (1990). Theory and research in organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 16''(1), 161-195.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational mortality ===
Organizational ecology is concerned with the capacity of the environment to support organizations and the rate of growth and decline of organizations within the environment. Each of these forces is a part of what is called ''Organizational Mortality''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Inertia and change ====
This factor holds that organizations that are reliable and accountable are those that can survive (favored by selection). A negative by-product, however, of the need for reliability and accountability is a high degree of inertia and a resistance to change. A key prediction of organizational ecology is that the process of change itself is so disruptive that it will result in an elevated rate of mortality.

Theories about inertia and change are fundamental to the research program of organizational ecology, which seeks a better understanding of the broader changes in the organizational landscape. Given the limits on firm-level adaptation, most of these broader changes thus come from the entry and selective replacement of organizations. Hence organizational ecology has spent considerable effort on understanding the founding and mortality rates of organizations.

Hannan and Freeman define organizational inertia in terms of internal and external restraints. Internal restraints include investment and sunk costs; availability of information for decision makers; political restraints such as organizational culture; and organization history. External restraints include legal and fiscal barriers to market entry and exit; availability of information about the environment; external legitimacy; and collective rationality and strategy&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; (See also [[Bounded rationality]]).

==== Niche theory ====

Niche width distinguishes broadly between two types of organizations: generalists and specialists. Specialist organizations maximize their exploitation of the environment and accept the risk of experiencing a change in that environment. On the other hand, generalist organizations accept a lower level of exploitation in return for greater security.

Niche theory shows that specialization is generally favored in stable or certain environments. However, the main contribution of the niche theory is probably the finding that "generalism is not always optimal in uncertain environments". The exception is produced by environments which "place very different demands on the organization, and the duration of environmental states is short relative to the life of the organization".

Thus, the niche theory explains variations in industrial structure in different industries. The theory shows how different structures in different industries (generalist vs specialist organizations) are shaped by relevant environments.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Density dependence ====

Organizational ecology also predicts that the rates of founding and mortality are dependent on the number of organizations (density) in the market. The two central mechanisms here are legitimization (the recognition or taken-for-grantedness of that group of organizations) and [[competition]]. Legitimization generally increases (at a decreasing rate) with the number of organizations, but so does competition (at an increasing rate). The result is that legitimization processes will prevail at low numbers of organizations, while competition will at high numbers.

The founding rate will therefore first increase with the number of organizations (due to an increase in legitimization) but will decrease at high numbers of organizations (due to competition). The reverse holds for mortality rates. Thus, the relationship of density to founding rates has an inverted U shape and the relationship of density to mortality rates follows a U-shaped pattern.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, G. (1984). Organizational ecology. ''Annual Review of Sociology 10''(1), 71-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Age dependence ====

How an organization's risk of mortality relates to the age of that organization has also been extensively examined. Here, organizational ecologists have found a number of patterns:

* '''Liability of newness'''. Here, the risk of failure is high initially but declines as the organization ages.
* '''Liability of adolescence'''. The risk of mortality will be low at first as the organization is buffered from failure due to support by external constituents and initial endowments. But when these initial resources become depleted, the mortality hazard shoots up and then declines following the liability of newness pattern.
* '''Liabilities of aging'''. Here, the risk of failure increases with organizational age. This could be due to a ''liability of senescence'' (internal inefficiencies arising from the aging of the organization) or a ''liability of obsolescence'' (a growing external mismatch with the environment).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Evolutionary approaches to organizations ==
Organizational ecology can be usefully compared with evolutionary theories in economics (e.g. Nelson &amp; Winter, 1982).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Hannan and Freeman also note the influences of biological ecology and economic evolution on their population ecology model (specifically Elton, 1927; Durkheim, 1947; Hawley, 1950; and Hutchison, 1959).&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Main similarities between these strands of literature are: (1) the emphasis on organizational routines and the limits to organizational adaptability, (2) the population or system level of analysis and (3) the importance of environmental selection. Organizational ecology's perspective is more Darwinistic (see Hannan &amp; Freeman, 1989, pp 20–22), while Nelson &amp; Winter (1982, p.&amp;nbsp;11) provide a more Lamarckian perspective.  Another important difference concerns the question: What is selected by the environment-- 'organizational forms', as in organizational ecology, or 'routines' as in the evolutionary economics literature? Authors like Joel Baum and Arjen van Witteloostuijn have argued for the potential of cross-fertilization between these two research strands.

A social networks perspective on the evolution of large scale interfirm organizational networks was presented by Braha et al.&lt;ref&gt;Braha, Dan, Blake Stacey, and Yaneer Bar-Yam, 2011. [http://necsi.edu/affiliates/braha/Journal_Version_SON_Braha.pdf “Corporate competition: A self-organized network”,] ''Social Networks'' 33 (3): 219–230.&lt;/ref&gt; who propose micro-dynamic models that reproduce actual large-scale interfirm perceived competition networks. Several evolutionary mechanisms of organizational networks are identified: spatial locations of firms are positively correlated with the population density; interfirm competition is governed by cumulative advantage rules and geographic distance; and competition network formation and firm size dynamics are closely intertwined.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21523">In the [[power systems|power systems analysis]] field of [[electrical engineering]], a '''per-unit system'''  is the expression of system quantities as fractions of a defined base unit quantity. Calculations are simplified because quantities expressed as per-unit do not change when they are referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This can be a pronounced advantage in power system analysis where large numbers of transformers may be encountered. Moreover, similar types of apparatus will have the impedances lying within a narrow numerical range when expressed as a per-unit fraction of the equipment rating, even if the unit size varies widely. Conversion of per-unit quantities to volts, ohms, or amperes requires a knowledge of the base that the per-unit quantities were referenced to. The per-unit system is used in [[Power flow study|power flow]], [[short circuit]] evaluation, [[motor starting methods|motor starting]] studies etc.

The main idea of a per unit system is to absorb large differences in absolute values into base relationships. Thus, representations of elements in the system with per unit values become more uniform.

A per-unit system provides units for [[electric power|power]], [[voltage]], [[Current (electricity)|current]], [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], and [[admittance]]. With the exception of impedance and admittance, any two units are independent and can be selected as base values; power and voltage are typically chosen. All quantities are specified as multiples of selected base values.  For example, the base power might be the rated power of a [[transformer]], or perhaps an arbitrarily selected power which makes power quantities in the system more convenient.  The base voltage might be the nominal voltage of a [[Busbar|bus]].  Different types of quantities are labeled with the same symbol ('''pu'''); it should be clear whether the quantity is a voltage, current, or other unit of measurement.

==Purpose==

There are several reasons for using a per-unit system:
* Similar apparatus (generators, transformers, lines) will have similar per-unit impedances and losses expressed on their own rating, regardless of their absolute size. Because of this, per-unit data can be checked rapidly for gross errors. A per unit value out of normal range is worth looking into for potential errors.
* Manufacturers usually specify the impedance of apparatus in per unit values. 
* Use of the constant &lt;math&gt; \scriptstyle \sqrt{3} &lt;/math&gt; is reduced in three-phase calculations. 
* Per-unit quantities are the same on either side of a transformer, independent of voltage level
* By normalizing quantities to a common base, both hand and automatic calculations are simplified. 
* It improves numerical stability of automatic calculation methods.
* Per unit data representation yields important information about relative magnitudes.
The per-unit system was developed to make manual analysis of power systems easier.  Although power-system analysis is now done by computer, results are often expressed as per-unit values on a convenient system-wide base.

== Base quantities ==
Generally base values of power and voltage are chosen. The base power may be the rating of a single piece of apparatus such as a motor or generator. If a system is being studied, the base power is usually chosen as a convenient round number such as 10 MVA or 100 MVA. The base voltage is chosen as the nominal rated voltage of the system. All other base quantities are derived from these two base quantities. Once the base power and the base voltage are chosen, the base current and the base impedance are determined by the natural laws of electrical circuits. The base value should only be a magnitude, while the per-unit value is a phasor. The phase angles of complex power, voltage, current, impedance, etc., are not affected by the conversion to per unit values.

The purpose of using a per-unit system is to simplify conversion between different transformers. Hence, it is appropriate to illustrate the steps for finding per-unit values for voltage and impedance. First, let the base power (S_base) of each end of a transformer become the same. Once every S is set on the same base, the base voltage and base impedance for every transformer can easily be obtained. Then, the real numbers of impedances and voltages can be substituted into the per-unit calculation definition to get the answers for the per-unit system. If the per-unit values are known, the real values can be obtained by multiplying by the base values.

By convention, the following two rules are adopted for base quantities:

* The base power value is the same for the entire power system of concern.
* The ratio of the voltage bases on either side of a transformer is selected to be the same as the ratio of the transformer voltage ratings.

With these two rules, a per-unit impedance remains unchanged when referred from one side of a transformer to the other. This allows the ideal transformer to be eliminated from a transformer model.

==Relationship between units==

The relationship between units in a per-unit system depends on whether the system is [[single-phase]] or [[three-phase]].

===Single-phase===

Assuming that the independent base values are power and voltage, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;P_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;V_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, the base value for power may be given in terms of [[Reactive power|reactive]] or [[apparent power]], in which case we have, respectively,

: &lt;math&gt;Q_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

or

: &lt;math&gt;S_{\text{base}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

The rest of the units can be derived from power and voltage using the equations &lt;math&gt;S = IV&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt; \underline{V} = \underline{I} \underline{Z}&lt;/math&gt; ([[Ohm's law]]), &lt;math&gt;Z&lt;/math&gt; being represented by &lt;math&gt; \underline{Z} = R + j X = Z\cos(\phi) + j Z\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt;.  We have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{I_{\text{base}}V_{\text{base}}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

===Three-phase===

Power and voltage are specified in the same way as single-phase systems.  However, due to differences in what these terms usually represent in three-phase systems, the relationships for the derived units are different. Specifically, power is given as total (not per-phase) power, and voltage is line-to-line voltage.
In three-phase systems the equations &lt;math&gt;P = S\cos(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Q = S\sin(\phi)&lt;/math&gt; also hold. The apparent power &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; now equals &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}}= \sqrt{3}V_{\mathrm{base}} I_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{S_{\mathrm{base}}}{V_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{V_{\mathrm{base}}}{I_{\mathrm{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{{V_{\mathrm{base}}^2}}{S_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 1 \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

==Example of per-unit==

As an example of how per-unit is used, consider a three-phase power transmission system that deals with powers of the order of 500 MW and uses a nominal voltage of 138 kV for transmission.  We arbitrarily select &lt;math&gt;S_{\mathrm{base}} = 500\, \mathrm{MVA}&lt;/math&gt;, and use the nominal voltage 138 kV as the base voltage &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{base}}&lt;/math&gt;.  We then have:

: &lt;math&gt;I_{\text{base}} = \frac{S_{\text{base}}}{V_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = 2.09 \, \mathrm{kA}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Z_{\text{base}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}}{I_{\text{base}} \times \sqrt{3}} = \frac{V_{\text{base}}^{2}}{S_{\text{base}}} = 38.1 \, \Omega&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;Y_{\mathrm{base}} = \frac{1}{Z_{\mathrm{base}}} = 26.3 \, \mathrm{mS}&lt;/math&gt;

If, for example, the actual voltage at one of the buses is measured to be 136 kV, we have:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{\mathrm{pu}} = \frac{V}{V_{\mathrm{base}}} = \frac{136 \, \mathrm{kV}}{138 \, \mathrm{kV}} = 0.9855 \, \mathrm{pu}&lt;/math&gt;

== In transformers ==
It can be shown that voltages, currents, and impedances in a per-unit system will have the same values whether they are referred to primary or secondary of a [[transformer]].&lt;ref name="Sen 1997"&gt;{{cite book | last=Sen | first=P. C. | title=Principles of electric machines and power electronics | publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] | location=New York | year=1997 | isbn=978-0-471-02295-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|85}}

For instance, for voltage, we can prove that the per unit voltages of two sides of the transformer, side 1 and side 2, are the same. Here, the per-unit voltages of the two sides are E&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; respectively.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
E_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{E_{1}}{V_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2}V_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{1}E_{2}}{N_{2} \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {E_{2}} {V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= E_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

‘E&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and E&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are the voltages of sides 1 and 2 in volts. N&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 1 has. N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is the number of turns the coil on side 2 has. V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are the base voltages on sides 1 and 2. &lt;math&gt; V_{base1}=\frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}}V_{base2}&lt;/math&gt;

For current, we can prove that the per-unit currents of the two sides are the same below.
&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{1,pu}&amp;=\frac{I_{1}}{I_{base1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1}I_{base1}} \\
&amp;= \frac {N_{2}I_{2}}{N_{1} \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{2}} {I_{base2}}\\
&amp;= I_{2,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
 (source: Alexandra von Meier Power System Lectures, UC Berkeley)

where I&lt;sub&gt;1p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;2p.u.&lt;/sub&gt; are the per-unit currents of sides 1 and 2 respectively. In this, the base currents I&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and I&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related in the opposite way that V&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; and V&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt; are related, in that

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base1}} {V_{base1}}\\
S_{base1} &amp;= S_{base2}\\
V_{base2} &amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} V_{base1}\\
I_{base2} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} {V_{base2}}\\
I_{base1} &amp;= \frac{S_{base2}} { \frac{N_{1}}{N_{2}} V_{base2}}\\
&amp;= \frac{N_{2}}{N_{1}} I_{base2}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The reason for this relation is for power conservation
S&lt;sub&gt;base1&lt;/sub&gt; = S&lt;sub&gt;base2&lt;/sub&gt;

The full load [[copper loss]] of a transformer in per-unit form is equal to the per-unit value of its resistance:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL}&amp;=\text{full-load copper loss}\\
&amp;= I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
P_{cu,FL,pu}&amp;=\frac{P_{cu,FL}}{P_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {I_{R1}^2R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {V_{R1}/I_{R1}}\\
&amp;= \frac {R_{eq1}} {Z_{B1}}\\
&amp;= R_{eq1,pu}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore, it may be more useful to express the resistance in per-unit form as it also represents the full-load copper loss.&lt;ref name="Sen 1997" /&gt;{{rp|86}}

As stated above, there are two degrees of freedom within the per unit system that allow the engineer to specify any per unit system. The degrees of freedom are the choice of the base voltage (V{{sub|base}}) and the base power (S{{sub|base}}). By convention, a single base power (S{{sub|base}}) is chosen for both sides of the transformer and its value is equal to the rated power of the transformer. By convention, there are actually two different base voltages that are chosen, V{{sub|base1}} and V{{sub|base2}} which are equal to the rated voltages for either side of the transformer. By choosing the base quantities in this manner, the transformer can be effectively removed from the circuit as described above. For example:

Take a transformer that is rated at 10 kVA and 240/100 V. The secondary side has an impedance equal to 1∠0° ohms. The base impedance on the secondary side is equal to:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,2}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,2}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {10000} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {1 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance on the secondary side is 1∠0° ohm / 1 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. When this impedance is referred to the other side, the impedance becomes:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{2}&amp;=\left(\frac{240}{100}\right)^2\times\text{1∠0° ohm}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76∠0° ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

The base impedance for the primary side is calculated the same way as the secondary:

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,1}&amp;=\frac{V_{base,1}^2}{S_{base}}\\
&amp;= \frac {57600} {10000}\\
&amp;= \text {5.76 ohm}\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

This means that the per unit impedance is 5.76∠0° ohm / 5.76 ohm = 1∠0° p.u. which is the same as when calculated from the other side of the transformer, as would be expected.

Another useful tool for analyzing transformers is to have the base change formula that allows the engineer to go from a base impedance with one set of a base voltage and base power to another base impedance for a different set of a base voltage and base power. This becomes especially useful in real life applications where a transformer with a secondary side voltage of 1.2 kV might be connected to the primary side of another transformer whose rated voltage is 1 kV. The formula is as shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
Z_{base,new}&amp;=Z_{base,old}\times\left(\frac{V_{base,old}}{V_{base,new}}\right)^2\times\left(\frac{S_{base,new}}{S_{base,old}}\right)\\
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

A '''prairie remnant''' commonly refers to grassland areas in the [[Western United States|Western]] and [[Midwestern United States]] and [[Canada]] that remain to some extent [[remnant natural area|undisturbed by European settlement]]. Prairie remnants range in levels of degradation but nearly all contain at least some semblance of the [[Pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] local [[plant community|plant assemblage]] of a particular region. Prairie remnants have become increasingly threatened due to the threats of agricultural, urban and suburban development, pollution, [[Fire_ecology#Some_examples_of_fire_in_different_ecosystems|fire]] suppression, and the incursion of invasive species.&lt;ref name=packard1997&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Packard |editor-first1=Stephen |editor-link1=Stephen Packard |editor-last2=Mutel |editor-first2=Cornelia F.|editor-link2=Cornelia Mutel |date=1997 |title=The Tallgrass Restoration Handbook: For Prairies, Savannas, and Woodlands |publisher=Island Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=greenberg2004&gt;{{cite book |title=A Natural History of the Chicago Region |last=Greenberg |first=Joel |authorlink=Joel Greenberg |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OXA1VVOSUg4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=A+Natural+History+of+the+Chicago+Region&amp;hl=en&amp;src=bmrr&amp;ei=qendTdPdB5GCsQOx3fGiBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=warren%20woods&amp;f=false |year=2004 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=978-0-226-30649-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prairie remnants in restoration ecology ==
Prairie remnants offer valuable varieties of rare species thus providing excellent opportunities for [[restoration ecology]] projects. Many restoration projects are simply recreations of prairie habitats, but restoring prairie remnants provides the preservation of more complete ecological structures that were naturally created after the end of the last ice age. Remnants can also serve as platforms for additional surrounding [[ecological restoration]] activities.&lt;ref name=greenberg2004/&gt;

== Tallgrass prairies in North America ==
It has been estimated that 99% of [[tallgrass prairie]] habitats in North America have been destroyed mainly due to conversion to agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.fws.gov/refuge/Crescent_Lake/what_we_do/resource_management/prairies.html Crescent Lake Wildlife Refuge, Nebraska] U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service, Retrieved 29 November 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Tallgrass prairies are generally composed of a mixture of native grasses, sedges, and forbs but are usually dominated by grasses.

== Shortgrass prairies in North America ==
The [[shortgrass prairie]] is an ecosystem located in the [[Great Plains]] of North America. The prairie includes lands to the west as far as the eastern foothills of the [[Rocky Mountains]] and extends east as far as [[Nebraska]] and north into [[Saskatchewan]]. The prairie stretches through parts of Alberta, Wyoming, Montana, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Kansas, and passes south through the high plains of Colorado, Oklahoma, Texas, and New Mexico.

'''''Rhema''''' (ῥῆμα in [[Koine Greek|Greek]]) literally means an "utterance" or "thing said" in Greek.&lt;ref&gt;''The handbook of linguistics'' by Mark Aronoff, Janie Rees-Miller 2003 {{ISBN|1-4051-0252-7}} page 83 [https://books.google.com/books?id=rl8LDiR11nYC&amp;pg=PA83&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEgQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; It is a word that signifies the action of utterance.&lt;ref&gt;''The Sophists (A History of Greek Philosophy, Vol. 3, Part 1)'' by W. K. C. Guthrie 1977 {{ISBN|0-521-09666-9}} page 220 [https://books.google.com/books?id=pDOqZfQ5tqUC&amp;pg=PA220&amp;dq=rhema&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=bvF4TLqoCoaG4Qb9zr27Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=8&amp;ved=0CFMQ6AEwBzg8#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[philosophy]], it was used by both [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] to refer to [[proposition]]s or sentences.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"/&gt;

In [[Christianity]], it is used in reference to the concept of ''Rhematos Christou''; Jesus Christ's sayings.

==Etymology==
The Greek noun [[wikt:ῥῆμα|ῥῆμα]] "saying, utterance, word, verb" is analyzed as consisting of the root ἐρ-/ῥε- (er-/rhe-) "say" (cf. [[wikt:εἴρω|εἴρω]] "I say"; ἐρῶ "I will say") and the suffix -μα (-ma), a suffix used to form nouns from verbs.

|}&lt;/small&gt;

Both [[Plato]] (c. 428–347 BC) and [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) used the terms ''logos'', ''rhema'' and ''onoma''. In Plato's usage, a [[logos]] (often translatable as a ''sentence'') is a sequence in which verbs are mingled with nouns and every logos must have an onoma and rhema. For Plato, every logos was either true or false and in a logos, names included rhema ''which denotes actions'' and onoma a ''mark set on those who do the actions''.&lt;ref name="Dinneen"&gt;''General linguistics'' by Francis P. Dinneen 1995 {{ISBN|0-87840-278-0}} page 118 [https://books.google.com/books?id=H8njxDzC450C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BEt4TOXbGMqSswb1v_yxDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwCDgo#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle identified three components as central to the proposition: ''onoma'', ''rhema'' and ''logos''. These terms are translated differently depending on the context of the discussion—grammar or logic, as in the table on the right.

==In Christianity==
{{Main article|Rhema (doctrine)}}
In Christianity, ''rhema'' is used in [[Bible study (Christian)|Bible study]] to signify Jesus Christ's utterances.{{cn|date=April 2018}} The Greek word ''rhema'' is useful to distinguish between two meanings of ''word''. While both ''rhema'' and ''logos'' are translated into the English ''word'', in the original Greek there was a substantial distinction.

Some modern usage distinguishes ''rhema'' from ''logos'' in [[Christian theology]], with ''rhema'' at times called "spoken word",&lt;ref name="Rogers"/&gt; referring to the revelation received by disciples when the  [[Holy Spirit]] "speaks" to them.&lt;ref name="Rogers"&gt;''What Every Christian Ought to Know'' by Adrian Rogers 2005 {{ISBN|0-8054-2692-2}} page 162 [https://books.google.com/books?id=W0os7ZiHsf0C&amp;pg=PA163&amp;dq=rhema+utterance&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ZvJ4TKqBNIag4Qa7tqm5Bg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CDwQ6AEwBDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20utterance&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Identified Life of Christ'' by Joe Norvell 2006 {{ISBN|1-59781-294-3}} page [https://books.google.com/books?id=3FAhz_eshkMC&amp;pg=PA142&amp;dq=rhema+logos&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=PEp4TLvMKtH14AaetLmABg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CEkQ6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=rhema%20logos&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In this usage, "Logos" refers to Christ.&lt;ref&gt;''The Trinitarian controversy'' by William G.

'''Salt marsh die-off''' is a term that has been used in the US and UK to describe the death of [[salt marsh]] [[cordgrass]] leading to subsequent degradation of habitat, specifically in the [[low marsh]] zones of salt marshes on the coasts of the Western Atlantic. Cordgrass normally anchors sediment in salt marshes; its loss leads to decreased substrate hardness, increased erosion, and collapse of creek banks into the water, ultimately resulting in decreased marsh health and productivity.

Die-off can affect several [[species]] of [[cordgrass]] (genus ''[[Spartina]]''), including ''[[Spartina alterniflora|S. alterniflora]]'', ''[[Spartina densiflora|S. densiflora]]'', and ''S. townsendii''. There are several competing hypotheses predicting the causes and mechanisms of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. These hypotheses place different emphasis on the effects of top-down or bottom-up processes for salt marsh die-off. Combined with [[salt marsh dieback]] of the [[high marsh]], salt marsh die-off is a serious threat to the [[ecosystem services]] that marshes provide to local coastal communities.

==History of top-down vs. bottom-up==

In light of their effect on community processes, behaviors, and ecological interactions, [[Consumption (ecology)|consumptive interactions]] are some of the most widely studied concepts in [[ecology]]. Because of this, scientists use food webs to depict all of the food chains and trophic relationships in an ecological [[Community (ecology)|community]].
 
[[File:Food web diagram.svg|thumb|Example of a food web]] [[Food web]]s can be controlled by bottom-up or top-down forces, which dictate whether a food web’s structure and population dynamics are regulated by [[nutrient]]s (a supply of fixed [[carbon]]) and [[primary production]] or by [[Apex predators|top predators]], respectively. 
 
Much energy is lost from one [[trophic level]] to the next (about 90%); therefore, the success of higher levels is linked to lower ones and their supply of resources (Lindeman 1942).&lt;ref&gt;Lindeman, R.L. 1942. The trophic dynamic aspect of ecology. Ecology 23: 399-418.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the abundance and distribution of organisms in an [[ecosystem]] is also affected by densities of consumers, which limit the success of organisms at lower trophic levels and thereby influence the abundance of these organisms (Hairston et al. 1960).&lt;ref name=hairstonetal1960&gt;Hairston, N.G., E.D. Frederick, and B.S. Lawrence. 1960. Community structure, population control, and competition. The American Naturalist, 94(879): 421-425.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many ecologists argue that bottom-up and top-down control do not play equally critical roles in the structure and dynamics of populations in an ecosystem; however, data suggests that both bottom-up and top-down forces impact the structure of food webs and the spatial and temporal [[Abundance (ecology)|abundance]] and [[Distribution (ecology)|distribution]] of [[organism]]s (Bertness 2007),&lt;ref name=bertness2007&gt;Bertness, M.D. 2007. Atlantic Shorelines: Natural History and Ecology. Princeton, Jew Jersey: Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; although to what extent each plays a role is not fully understood.

Historically, an emphasis on bottom-up control in many ecosystems has prevailed in ecological thought, often to the exclusion of consumer control (Strong 1992).&lt;ref name=strong1992&gt;Strong D.R. 1992. Are trophic cascades all wet-differentiation and donor control in speciose ecosystems. Ecology 73(3): 747-754.&lt;/ref&gt; Many ecosystems in which consumer control has classically been considered trivial are dominated by plants (e.g., forests, grasslands, and salt marshes) and are usually green in appearance. Hairston and colleagues proposed an opposing view in 1960 that emphasized consumer control. They argued that the “world is green” because higher trophic levels regulate [[herbivore]] abundance (Hairston et al. 1960).&lt;ref name=hairstonetal1960/&gt;
 
Critics pointed out that the world is not always green, and that when it is, herbivores do not necessarily play an important role in structuring plant communities (Ehrlich and Birch 1967).&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, P.R. and L.C. Birch. 1967. The “balance of nature” and “population control.” The American Naturalist, 101: 97-107.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argued that what is green is not always edible or of sufficiently high quality to allow increases in herbivore populations (Dixon 1966, Murdoch 1966).&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, A.F.F. 1966. The effect of population density and nutritive status of the host on the summer reproductive activity of the sycamore aphid, Drepanosiphum platanoides. J. Anim. Ecol. 35 105-112.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murdoch, W.W. 1966. Community structure, population control, and competition: a critique. The American Naturalist, 100: 219-226.&lt;/ref&gt; The debate is ongoing, but the dominant view of ecologists remains that although consumers affect many aspects of plant productivity and ecology, top-down control does not drive the productivity of entire plant ecosystems.
 
More recently, however, examples of conspicuous consumer control of entire ecosystems have emerged in a variety of [[habitat]]s including [[lake]]s (Carpenter et al. 1985),&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S. R., J. F. Kitchell, and J. R. Hodgson. Cascading trophic interactions and lake productivity. BioScience 35, 634-639 (1985).&lt;/ref&gt; [[river]]s (Power 1992),&lt;ref&gt;Power, M.E. 1992. Habitat heterogeneity and the functional significance of fish in river food webs. Ecology, 73: 1675-1688.&lt;/ref&gt; and marine (Estes and Duggins 1995)&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995&gt;Estes, J. A. and D.O. Duggins. 1995. Sea otters and kelp forests in Alaska: Generality and variation in a community ecological paradigm. Ecological Monographs 65, 75-100.&lt;/ref&gt; habitats. [[Foundation species|Foundation]] plant species can be replaced with other species or [[Substrate (biology)|substratum]] completely lacking [[vegetation]] and [[insect]]s can defoliate whole [[mangrove]]s (Feller 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Feller, I. C. 2002. The role of herbivory by wood-boring insects in mangrove ecosystems in Belize. Oikos 97, 167-176.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
A classic example of top-down interactions dictating community structure and function comes from [[Robert Paine (zoologist)|Bob Paine’s]] work in Washington, which established that removal of the [[starfish]] ''[[Pisaster]]'' triggered a trophic cascade in which the blue mussel (''[[Mytilus (bivalve)|Mytilus]]'') populations exploded due to release from [[predation]] pressure (Paine 1966)&lt;ref&gt;Paine, R.T. 1966. Web complexity and species diversity. The American Naturalist, 100(910): 65-75.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Another influential example of top-down control emerged from Jane Lubchenco’s experiments on New England [[rocky shore]]s, which demonstrated that the herbivorous [[snail]] ''[[Littorina littorea|L. littorea]]'' exerts control on the [[Biodiversity|diversity]] and [[Succession (ecology)|succession]] of [[tide pool]] [[Algae|algal]] communities (Lubchenco and Menge 1978).&lt;ref&gt;Lubchenco, J. and B.A. Menge. 1978. Community development and persistence in a low rocky intertidal zone. Ecological Monographs 48: 67-94.&lt;/ref&gt; One [[hypothesis]] that arose from Lubchenco’s work (Little and Kitching 1996)&lt;ref&gt;Little, C. and J.A. Kitching. 1996. The Biology of Rocky Shores. Oxford, UK: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; was that predation by the [[green crab]] (''[[Carcinus maenas]]'') influences rocky shore algal communities by regulating ''L. littorea'' abundances.
 
Ecologists cite these examples as [[evidence]] that consumer regulation is more potent and predominant than previously recognized.

==Historical paradigms of salt marsh theory==

[[File:Healthy salt marsh.jpg|thumb|border|right|Healthy salt marsh]]
In salt marshes, early ecologists like [[Eugene Odum]] and John Teal sparked the current bottom-up [[paradigm]] in ecology through work on Sapelo Island, GA (U.S.A) that stressed the dominant role of physical factors like [[temperature]], [[salinity]], and [[nutrients]] in regulating plant primary productivity and ecosystem structure (Teal 1962, Odum 1971).&lt;ref name=teal1962&gt;Teal, J.M. 1962. Energy flow in the salt marsh ecosystem of Georgia. Ecology 43: 614–624.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P. 1971. Fundamentals of Ecology. Philadelphia: Saunders.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecologists noted that marsh plants were not heavily grazed and appeared to be relatively unpalatable, and thus argued that most plants entered salt marsh food chains as [[detritus]] (Teal 1962).&lt;ref name=teal1962/&gt; A corollary of this dogma is that consumers play an unimportant or subtle role in controlling salt marsh primary production (Smalley 1960, Teal 1962).&lt;ref name=teal1962/&gt;&lt;ref name=smalley1960&gt;Smalley A.E. 1960. Energy flow of a salt marsh grasshopper population. Ecology 41:672–77.&lt;/ref&gt; This paradigm was widely accepted for decades and applied to other ecosystems like mangroves and seagrass beds (Bertness 2007),&lt;ref name=bertness2007/&gt; and has thus “become entrenched in the conceptual understanding of coastal ecosystems” (quote from Bertness and Silliman 2008; Smalley 1960, Nixon 1982).&lt;ref name=smalley1960/&gt;&lt;ref name=bertnessandsilliman2008&gt;Bertness, M.D. and B.R. Silliman. 2008. Consumer control of salt marshes driven by human disturbance. Conservation Biology 22:618-623.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nixon, S.W. 1982. The ecology of New England high salt marshes: a community profile. Washington, DC: U.S. Dep. Int. Fish Wildl. Serv. FWS/OBS-81/55. 70 pp.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Recent work, however, has demonstrated strong top-down control of plant communities in salt marshes by a wide variety of consumers, including [[snail]]s, [[crab]]s, and [[Goose|geese]] (Jefferies 1997, Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Silliman and Bertness 2002, Holdredge et al. 2009).&lt;ref name=jefferies1997&gt;Jefferies, R.L. 1997.

Ecology 75: 1015-1022.&lt;/ref&gt; [[cattle]], [[hare]]s, [[insects]], and [[rodent]]s, some of which are able to strongly suppress plant growth.
 
Strong top-down control on marshes has been demonstrated in various marsh systems. Consumer control is driven by the [[Grapsidae|grapsid crab]] ([[Chasmagnathus granulata]]) in the salt marshes of Argentina and Brazil on the Atlantic coast of South America (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt; Other experiments in Argentina have contributed to the growing body of work evidencing consumer control in salt marshes (Alberti et al. 2007),&lt;ref name=albertietal2007&gt;Alberti J, M. Escapa, P. Daleo, O. Iribarne, B.R. Silliman, M.D. Bertness. 2007. Local and geographic variation in grazing intensity by herbivorous crabs in SW Atlantic salt marshes. Mar. Ecol. Prog. Ser. 349: 235–43.&lt;/ref&gt; and herbivory has also been suggested to play an important role in southwestern Atlantic marshes (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=albertietal2007/&gt; Not only are consumers important on a small scale as demonstrated by cage experiments in various locations (Silliman and Zieman 2001, Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005),&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001&gt;Silliman B.R., Zieman JC. 2001. Top-down control of Spartina alterniflora production by periwinkle grazing in a Virginia salt marsh. Ecology 82:2830–45.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005&gt;Silliman B.R., van de Koppel J, Bertness MD, Stanton LE, Mendelssohn IA. 2005. [[Drought]], snails, and largescale die-off of southern U.S. salt marshes. Science 310:1803–6.&lt;/ref&gt; but they also affect primary productivity across large geographic areas (Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;

Bertness and Silliman have also suggested that while salt marshes may have historically been nutrient limited and bottom up controlled, human disturbances such as eutrophication and predator depletion has shifted these systems to top down control in recent decades (Bertness and Silliman 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessandsilliman2008/&gt;

==Regional causes of salt marsh die-off==

[[File:Calving marsh creek bank.jpg|thumb|right|Calving creek bank of a marsh experiencing die-off in Cape Cod, Massachusetts]] Both top-down and bottom-up forces have been proposed as primary drivers of salt marsh die-off throughout the western Atlantic. The relative importance of these factors depends on the abiotic and biotic conditions of each local or regional marsh system and its environment.
 
===Top-down interactions===

Human activities can trigger trophic cascades (Jefferies 1997),&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt; which occur when the predators that limit abundance of [[prey]] and thereby enhance survival of the next lower [[trophic level]] are depleted (Strong 1992).&lt;ref name=strong1992/&gt; Depletion of [[top predators]] releases their prey from consumer control and leads to population declines of the next lower trophic level, often the [[primary producers]]. [[Trophic cascade]]s occur across a minimum of three trophic levels and can impact [[Community (ecology)|community]] dynamics in a variety of systems (Estes et al. 1998).&lt;ref name=estesetal1998&gt;Estes, J.A., M.T. Tinker, T.M. Williams, and D.F. Doak. 1998. Killer whale predation on sea otters linking oceanic and nearshore ecosystems. Science 282: 473–476.&lt;/ref&gt; Trophic cascades can induce salt marsh die-off and transform green landscapes into [[Urchin barren|barrens]] (Estes and Duggins 1995, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Primary triggers of trophic cascades through human action include introduction of [[invasive species]], [[overexploitation]], and [[climate change]] (Jackson et al. 2001, Lotze et al. 2006, Gedan et al. 2009, Gedan and Bertness 2011).&lt;ref name=jacksonetal2001&gt;Jackson, J.B.C., et al. 2001. Historical overfishing and the recent collapse of coastal ecosystems. Science 293: 629–638.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006&gt;Lotze, H.K., Lenihan H.S., Bourque B.J., Bradbury R.H. and others. 2006. Depletion, degradation, and recovery potential of estuaries and coastal seas. Science 312: 1806-1809.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
====Invasive Species====

[[File:Myocastor Coypus Nutria Biberratte.jpg|thumb|right|The invasive rodent, nutria, ''[[Coypu|Myocastor coypus]]'']] Human introduction of non-native species can also contribute to top-down control of marsh systems (Furbish and Albano 1994, Gough and Grace 1998).&lt;ref name=furbishandalbano1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998&gt;Gough L. and J.B. Grace. 1998. Effects of flooding, salinity and herbivory on coastal plant communities, Louisiana, United States. Oecologia 117:527–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Introduced feral horses on the barrier islands of Maryland, Virginia, and the Carolinas have entirely denuded marsh ecosystems (Furbish and Albano 1994),&lt;ref name=furbishandalbano1994/&gt; and the introduced rodent [[Coypu|nutria]] on Gulf Coast marshes of Louisiana can decrease marsh plant primary production (Gough and Grace 1998).&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998/&gt;

The invasive green crab, ''[[Carcinus maenas]]'', can turn off top down control by facilitating the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems. In marshes that have experienced die-off via the trophic cascade initiated by recreational overfishing, purple marsh crabs, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'', can be evicted by the larger green crabs, which prey upon the purple crab. In this way, green crabs can indirectly reduce purple crab herbivory and promotes cordgrass recovery. These results are encouraging because they suggest that invasive species, which are classically considered to have mostly negative impacts on the ecosystems they invade, can sometimes actually contribute to restoring degraded ecosystems.
&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M. D. and T. C. Coverdale. 2013. An invasive species facilitates the recovery of salt marsh ecosystems on Cape Cod. Ecology 94:1937–1943.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Fungal====

Die-off could potentially be explained by [[pathogens]] of salt marsh plants in some areas - fungal species have been identified at die-off sites in the UK as well as US Atlantic and Gulf coast sites (Elmer 2013).&lt;ref name="Elmer, W.H. 2013"&gt;Elmer, W.H. et al. 2013. Sudden Vegetation Dieback in Atlantic and Gulf Coast Salt Marshes. Plant Disease, 436-445.&lt;/ref&gt; Fungal-facilitated marsh degradation is a documented concern in the Southeast Atlantic in particular. Marsh snails [[Littoraria irrorata]] make minor cuts in the cordgrass during grazing. These cuts facilitate growth of fungus, and at high snail densities, can lead to mass [[infection]]s, increased grazing and consequent die-off (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silliman B.R. 2003"&gt;Silliman B.R., Newell SY. 2003. Fungal-farming in a snail. Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. 100:15643–48.&lt;/ref&gt;

In coastal New England, this evidence is weaker. Certain fungal pathogens of S. alterniflora were found more frequently in sites of die-off. These pathogens have varying degrees of [[virulence]], and there is some evidence of association with species of [[Fusarium]] and areas of die-off. However, although the association suggests a partial causal link, particularly in stress-predisposed plants, strong [[evidence]] is lacking to suggest that such fungal pathogens are a major cause of die-off in New England (Elmer 2013).&lt;ref name="Elmer, W.H. 2013"/&gt;

====Overexploitation====

Overharvesting has led to the collapse of various shallow-water marine [[ecosystems]] around the globe (Jackson et al. 2001),&lt;ref name=jacksonetal2001/&gt; including [[coral reef]]s (Hughes et al. 2003),&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, T. P., et al. 2003. Climate change, human impacts, and the resilience of coral reefs. Science 301:929–933.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seagrass|sea grass beds]], and [[kelp forest]]s (Estes et al. 1998).&lt;ref name=estesetal1998/&gt;

=====Commercial fishing=====

[[File:Snails eating fungus on cordgrass.png|thumb|border|Marsh snail (''L. irrorata'') eats fungus on cordgrass, killing the plants]]
Research on the salt marsh snail ''[[Littoraria irrorata]]'' and its effects on marsh plant productivity, have provided strong evidence of consumer control in marshes triggered by overexploitation. This snail is capable of turning strands of cordgrass ''(Spartina alterniflora'') (&gt;2.5m tall) into [[mudflat]]s within 8 months, which is less than one growing season (Silliman and Bertness 2002).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt; As previously referenced, marsh snails inflict cuts on cordgrass leaves when they graze, providing substratum and nutrients for [[fungus]]. At high snail densities, cordgrass can succumb to fungal [[infection]]s and marsh die-off can ensue (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman and Newell 2003, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt;&lt;ref name="Silliman B.R. 2003"/&gt; Natural predators of the marsh snail are blue crabs (''Callinectes sapidus'') and terrapin turtles (''Malaclemys terrapin''), which historically regulated snail abundances. However, these predators have been commercially overexploited, and now suffer from diseases due to small population size, releasing the snails from consumer pressure, and allowing the snails to wreak havoc on salt marsh cordgrass populations (Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name="sillimanandbertness2002"/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;

[[File:Enhydra lutris asleep 3.jpg|thumb|border|[[Sea otter]]]]
A classic example of a [[trophic cascade]] was caused by the overexploitation of [[sea otters]] in the 1980s (Estes &amp; Duggins 1995).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt; Sea otters eat [[Sea urchins|urchins]], which in turn graze on [[macroalgae]] in a food chain that, when altered, can lead to [[urchin barrens]]. Sea otters in Alaska were hunted to near [[extinction]] for their [[fur|pelts]]. Where sea otter populations have persisted, they suppress the abundance of urchins and thus have an indirect positive effect on the density of macroalgae. In contrast, in sites where sea otters are absent, sea urchin populations have surged and caused urchin barrens to develop. Wherever sea otters have been reinstated, sea urchin populations have been reduced, and kelp densities have increased, returning the habitat to its original healthy state. This example demonstrates the potential for whole-ecosystem recovery with the reestablishment of consumers (Estes and Duggins 1995).&lt;ref name=EstesandDuggins1995/&gt;
 
Other trophic cascades, such as those caused by crabs such as ''[[Chasmagnathus granulata]]'' in South America, are at least in part due to overfishing of top predators (Bortolus and Iribarne 1999, Alberti et al. 2007).&lt;ref name=bortolusandiribarne1999/&gt;&lt;ref name=albertietal2007/&gt;

=====Recreational fishing=====
[[File:Sesarma reticulatum.png|thumb|right|The purple marsh crab, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'']]
In New England, predator depletion has triggered extensive marsh die-off salt marsh creek banks. Herbivory has already impacted up to 90% of creek banks in more than 70% of outer Cape Cod marshes. Absent in 1997, die-off has recently spread into [[Narragansett Bay]], Rhode Island, impacting over 85% of creek banks. The [[nocturnal]] purple marsh crab, ''[[Sesarma reticulatum]]'', is playing a major role in this die-off through increased [[burrowing]] and herbivory due to release from predation pressure. Evidence has pointed to top-down control caused by [[Human impact on the environment|human disturbances]] as the primary agent driving die-off.
 
Altieri and colleagues performed a series of experiments (Altieri et al. 2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012&gt;Altieri, A.H., M.D. Bertness, T.C. Coverdale, N.C. Herrmann, C. Angelini. 2012. A trophic cascade triggers collapse of a salt-marsh ecosystem with intensive recreational fishing. Ecology 93(6): 1402-1410.&lt;/ref&gt; designed to elucidate the mechanisms driving marsh die-off more specifically. ''Sesarma'' crabs are normally preyed upon by blue crabs (''[[Callinectes sapidus]]''), and [[fish]] including [[striped bass]] (''[[Morone saxatilis]]'') and [[smooth dogfish]] (''[[Mustelus canis]]''). Although the cascading effects of overfishing have been demonstrated across various ecosystems (Myers and Worm 2003), research on predator depletion has focused almost exclusively on the impact of large-scale commercial overfishing (Worm et al. 2009). However, Altieri and colleagues (2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt; demonstrated that the predators of ''Sesarma'' were, and continue to be, overexploited by recreational [[Angler (fishing)|anglers]]. Their results show that die-off and vegetated marshes differed dramatically in recreational fishing pressure, as anglers were observed only at die-off sites.

Die-off marshes had half the biomass of top-level predators found at vegetated sites, while the biomass of nonharvested consumers did not differ between die-off and vegetated sites. Additionally, the predation rate on ''Sesarma'' at vegetated sites was triple that of die-off sites, and crabs consumed four times more grass at die-off sites than at vegetated sites. Historical reconstructions showed that little net marsh loss (&lt;5%) from 1939-2005 occurred at currently vegetated sites. In contrast, die-off marshes exhibited the onset of die-off in the mid-70s, with consistently increasing vegetation loss through 2005, at which time &gt;20% of the total marsh area was lost to die-off and &gt;80% of the cordgrass zone was unvegetated. This divergence between die-off and vegetated marshes in vegetation loss coincides with a period of rapid increase in the number of docks and boat slips before the mid-70s that resulted in the establishment of &gt;70% of that fishing [[infrastructure]] currently present at die-off marshes. These results provide evidence that ''Sesarma'' release from predation pressure by crabs and fish due to recreational overfishing by anglers is driving a trophic cascade that is responsible for extensive marsh die-off throughout southern New England (Altieri et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt;
 
[[File:Marsh erosion.png|right|500px|Denuded, eroding salt marsh creek bank]]Altieri and colleagues (2012)&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt; further hypothesized that historic, large-scale, industrialized overexploitation of fish in the northwest Atlantic (Lotze et al. 2006)&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006/&gt; increased marsh [[vulnerability]] to the effects of localized recreational fishing to the point that large-scale die off ensued, and that resultant localized die-offs could coalesce into complete, region-wide marsh die-off if overexploitation of top consumers continues (Altieri et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=altierietal2012/&gt;

Most recently, Bertness and colleagues (Bertness et al. 2014b)&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M.D., C. P. Brisson* T. C. Coverdale, M. C. Bevil, S. M. Crotty and E. R. Suglia. 2014 Experimental predator removal causes rapid salt marsh die-off. Ecology Letters 17(7):830–835. doi: 10.1111/ele.12287.&lt;/ref&gt; performed a field experiment excluding predators from plots on the grazing border of the marsh. Within one growing season, exclusion of top predators triggered die-off by increasing the abundances of ''Sesarma'' crabs and the intensity of herbivory. To further test the trophic cascade hypothesis, Bertness and colleagues used the spread of die-off into Narragansett Bay to assess all proposed drivers of die-off, including: 1) eutrophication decreases plant investment into belowground biomass causing plant collapse, 2) boat wakes erode creek banks, 3) pollution or disease affect plant health, 4) substrate hardness controls herbivorous crab distributions and 5) trophic dysfunction releases Sesarma from predator control. Nitrogen availability, wave intensity and plant growth did not explain any variation in die-off. However, herbivory explained over 70% of inter-site variation in die-off. (Bertness et al. 2014a)&lt;ref&gt;Bertness, M. D., C. Brisson, M. Bevil, and S. Crotty. 2014. Herbivory drives the spread of salt marsh die-off. PLoS ONE 9(3): e92916.&lt;/ref&gt; This work highlighted one particular example where top-down interactions were experimentally shown to be the primary driver of ecological community state change.

===Bottom-up interactions===

====Hypersaline and anoxic soils====

One theory of bottom-up control lies with differential [[soil]] [[chemistry]] between vegetated and die-off areas. Drought-associated changes in soil chemistry have been proposed to be associated with areas of die-off. Droughts are often associated with increased [[salinity]] and [[acidity]] [[Stress (biology)|stress]] - soils [[oxidize]] under [[freshwater]] or [[tidal]] [[moisture]] limitation, leading to increased acidity. [[Hypersaline|Hypersalinity]] has been linked to reduced S. alterniflora survival (Brown et al. 2005).&lt;ref&gt;Brown, C.E., S.R. Pezeshki, R.D. DeLaune. The effects of salinity and soil drying on nutrient uptake and growth of ''S. alterniflora'' in a simulated tidal system. Environmental and Experimental Botany 58(1-3): 140-148.&lt;/ref&gt; However, salt marsh plants are generally tolerant of a broad range of salinity levels, and increased salinity has not consistently been observed in die-off sites (Alber et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Alber M., E. Swenson, S. Adamowicz, I. Mendelssohn 2008. Salt marsh dieback: an overview of recent events in the US. [[Estuarine, Coastal and Shelf Science]], 8(1):1-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is uncertainty attributed to the link between different soil conditions and sites of die-off for several reasons. First, measurements may not be taken in frequent enough intervals to capture brief fluctuations in soil conditions associated with die-off. Second, attributing [[Causation and correlation|causation]] with changing soil conditions and die-off is potentially dubious. [[Reverse causation|Reverse causality]] is a potential explanation; that is, soil chemistry differences may be a result rather than an agent of die-off. For instance, one study noted higher salinity levels in die-off areas in some months, but this was possibly attributable to altered [[root]] or [[evaporation]] dynamics due to die-off (Marsh 2007). 
 
====Eutrophication====

Nutrient enrichment is a pervasive global threat to both marine and terrestrial ecosystems (Galloway et al. 2008, Verhoeven et al. 2006).&lt;ref&gt;Galloway, J. et al. Transformation of the nitrogen cycle: recent trends, questions and potential solutions. Science 320, 889–892 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Verhoeven, J. T. et al. Regional and global concerns over wetlands and water quality. Trends Ecol. Evol. 21, 96–103 (2006)&lt;/ref&gt; In marine ecosystems, increased flow of nitrogen can trigger severe algal blooms, anoxic conditions, and widespread fisheries losses (Diaz &amp; Rosenberg 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Diaz, R. J. and R. Rosenberg. Spreading dead zones and consequences for marine ecosystems. Science 321, 926–929 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In salt marshes, an important interface ecosystem between land and sea, nutrient addition has been hypothesized to contribute to widespread creek die-offs (Deegan et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=deeganetal2012&gt;Deegan, L.A., Bowen, J.L., Drake, D., Fleeger, J.W., Friedrichs, C.T., Hobbie, J.E., Hopkinson, C., Johnson, D.S., Johnson, J.M., LeMay, L.E., Miller, E., Peterson, B.J., Picard, C., Sheldon, S., Sutherland, M., Vallino, J. and S. Warren. 2012. Coastal eutrophication as a driver of salt marsh loss. Nature 490:388-392.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
To test this hypothesis, Linda Deegan and colleagues performed a nine-year study at one site in Massachusetts. The researchers found that tidal creek enrichment of nitrogen and phosphorus led to decreased investment in belowground nutrient gathering roots and rhizomes, increased microbial decomposition of organic matter, and eventual creek collapse and salt marsh loss (Deegan et al. 2012).&lt;ref name=deeganetal2012/&gt;
 
Similar studies in Connecticut, however, have been unable to replicate these findings. Shimon Anisfeld and Troy Hill performed a 5-year fertilization experiment of a salt marsh in Long Island Sound and found that neither nitrogen nor phosphorus fertilization led to elevation loss, reduced soil carbon, or a decrease in belowground primary production. They suggest that high nutrient levels can significantly alter marsh processes and increase gross carbon loss from sediment but that other processes may compensate for these impacts. No net deleterious effects of nutrient loading on carbon storage or on marsh stability are anticipated from this study (Anisfeld and Hill 2012).&lt;ref&gt;Anisfeld, S. and T. Hill. 2012. Fertilization effects on elevation change and belowground carbon balance in a Long Island Sound tidal marsh. Estuaries and Coasts 35: 201–211.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Other eutrophication studies performed in Narragansett Bay, Rhode Island found that experimental nitrogen addition initially increases plant productivity but eventually leads to reduced plant biomass due to insect herbivory (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; To supplement this experiment, researchers took surveys across 20 salt marshes to look at the interaction between marsh nutrient levels and herbivore pressure and found that marsh nitrogen supply was a good predictor of herbivore damage to plants. This study suggests that eutrophication is currently triggering consumer suppression of primary productivity in New England salt marshes and may eventually pose a threat to salt marsh ecosystem service provisioning (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt;

====Potential for Synergistic effects====

[[Coastal]] ecosystems suffer from a variety of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic impacts]], such as large-scale [[eutrophication]], [[food web]] alteration, runaway consumer effects, [[climate change]], [[habitat destruction]], and [[disease]]. Rarely do these factors act in isolated ways. Often, researchers find additive or [[synergistic]] interactions between impacts compounding the amount of ecosystem [[habitat degradation|degradation]]. One such example is found in salt marshes in the southeastern United States. Depletion of top predators in these systems has led to snail [[overgrazing]] of salt marsh cordgrass and subsequent die-off (as explained above). However, this die-off has been linked with intense drought conditions and the resultant increases in salt and acid stress (Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Drought stress that raises soil salinities and increases cordgrass vulnerabilities to top-down control may be a product of climate change (Silliman and Bertness 2002, Silliman et al. 2005).&lt;ref name=sillimanandbertness2002/&gt;&lt;ref name=sillimanetal2005/&gt; Cases such as these highlight how [[abiotic]] and biotic interactions can interact to affect [[ecosystem health]].

Anthropogenic actions also can cause eutrophication, or increase the nutrient load, of marine ecosystems, through [[Runoff (water)|runoff]] into the system containing [[fertilizer]], [[sewage]], dishwasher soap, and other [[nitrogen]]- and phosphorus-rich substances. Eutrophication is pervasive in coastal marine ecosystems (Lotze et al. 2006)&lt;ref name=lotzeetal2006/&gt; and can indirectly initiate trophic cascades and increase consumer control of plants. For example, insect herbivory in marshes has been positively [[correlated]] with nutrient availability in Atlantic salt marshes (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008&gt;Bertness, M.D., C.M. Crain, C. Holdredge and N. Sala. 2008. Eutrophication and consumer control of New England salt marsh primary production. Conservation Biology 22: 131-139.&lt;/ref&gt; In Narragansett Bay, insect herbivory suppresses primary production of human disturbed salt marshes by almost 40%. Nitrogen additions through human activity can increase insect herbivory so much that primary production is suppressed by nearly 60%, while marshes without human [[shoreline]] development remain solely under bottom-up control (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; Increased nutrient supply can lead to runaway herbivory in other systems as well (Gough and Grace 1998, Silliman and Zieman 2001).&lt;ref name=sillimanandzieman2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=goughandgrace1998/&gt;
 
For example, eutrophication initiates top-down control via the impact of [[snow geese]] on the [[arctic]] marshes of Hudson Bay (Jefferies 1997).&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt; By the 1980s, the snow geese that originally annually migrated to Hudson Bay had switched from feeding in [[temperate]] [[wetlands]] to feeding in heavily fertilized [[agricultural]] fields. Over a period of 30 years, the geese population exploded. Snow geese have since utterly destroyed hundreds of thousands of acres of the Hudson Bay wetland. The geese grubbed marsh plant roots, evaporation increased leading to subsequent salinity increase, and without plants to [[oxygenate]] the soil the substrate became anoxic. This undesirable [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] for marsh plants disallows [[Recruitment (biology)|sexual recruitment]] to the area. Snow geese have denuded the marsh until recolonization by [[Ramet|clonal]] runners can restore marsh vegetation, which could take years. Because of the use of [[artificial fertilizer]]s on temperate zone agricultural fields, a trophic cascade was initiated (Jefferies 1997).&lt;ref name=jefferies1997/&gt;

A major goal of ecology over the next century will be to understand how ecosystems will respond to current and future human impacts and the additive or synergistic interactions between them.

==Management implications and conservation==

[[File:Spartina foliosa.jpg|thumb|Cordgrass binds sediment, attenuates waves and prevents shoreline erosion]] [[Ecosystem services]] are the benefits that humans derive from ecological systems. Today, one of the arguments for protecting salt marshes is to increase the quality and quantity of these services. Salt marshes sequester nitrogen, filtering runoff water and reducing nitrogen input to [[estuaries]] (Valiela and Cole 2002).&lt;ref&gt;Valiela I. and M.L. Cole. 2002. Comparative evidence that salt marshes and mangroves may protect seagrass meadows from land-derived nitrogen loads. Ecosystems 5: 92–102.&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marshes also provide essential refuge habitat for young fish and [[crustaceans]], provisioning coastal fisheries (Boesch and Turner 1984)&lt;ref&gt;Boesch D.F. and R.E. Turner. 1984. Dependence of fishery species on salt marshes: the role of food and refuge. Estuaries 7: 460–468.&lt;/ref&gt; that account for 90% of the world’s fish catch (UNEP 2006).&lt;ref&gt;UNEP. 2006. Marine and coastal ecosystems and human well-being: a synthesis report based on the findings of the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment. UNEP.&lt;/ref&gt; Salt marshes also [[sequester carbon]], which will be an important ecosystem service as climate change intensifies (Chmura et al. 2003).&lt;ref&gt;Chmura G.L., S.C. Anisfeld, D.R. Cahoon, and J.C. Lynch. 2003. Global carbon sequestration in tidal, saline wetland soils. Global Biogeochemical Cycles 17: 1111–1133.&lt;/ref&gt; Arguably the most important ecosystem service salt marshes provide is to act as natural sea barriers because grasses bind soils, prevent shoreline [[erosion]], attenuate waves, and reduce coastal [[flooding]] (Costanza et al. 2008).&lt;ref&gt;Costanza R., O. Perez-Maqueo, M.L. Martinez, P. Sutton, S.J. Anderson, and K. Mulder. 2008. The value of coastal wetlands for hurricane protection. Ambio 37: 241–248.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the marsh’s natural ability to [[Buffer zone|buffer]] against erosion and flooding may be reduced by creek bank die-off. Since Spartina alterniflora is responsible for sediment binding and [[peat]] deposition (Redfield 1965),&lt;ref&gt;Redfield, A.C. 1965 Ontogeny of a salt marsh estuary. Science 147: 50–55.&lt;/ref&gt; cordgrass die-off may compromise the ability of salt marshes to keep pace with [[Sea level rise|sea-level rise]]. Also, the concentration of Sesarma burrows in New England salt marsh peat may directly trigger the erosion and collapse of the peat foundation of marshes.

On Cape Cod, marsh creek banks are often so riddled with ''Sesarma'' burrows that they collapse, exposing fresh peat to further burrowing and erosion (Bertness et al. 2008).&lt;ref name=bertnessetal2008/&gt; Feedbacks between crab herbivory and cordgrass die-off may thus lead to the retreat of marsh edges. For example, Coverdale and colleagues found that 20 years of die-off on Cape Cod have resulted in the loss of over 200 years of marsh accretion and hundreds of acres of marsh loss.&lt;ref&gt;Coverdale, T. C., E. W. Young, S.F. Yin, C. P. Brisson, J. P. Donnelly and M. D. Bertness. 2014. Indirect human impacts reverse centuries of carbon sequestration and salt marsh accretion. PLoS One, 9(3): e93296.&lt;/ref&gt; The detrimental effects trophic cascades have had on marshes not only reduce the [[biodiversity]], health, and aesthetic appeal of these ecosystems, but also compromise the ability of marshes to provide key ecosystem services to human populations.

==Conclusions==

Despite mounting evidence to the contrary, bottom-up control remains the central dogma determining marsh [[Management science|management]], [[Conservation biology|conservation]] and [[Ecosystem restoration|restoration]] efforts. Salt marshes are currently managed as if they are exclusively regulated by physical factors. However, global and near shore top predator depletion leading to the release of cryptic or unappreciated herbivores may be the biggest current threat to salt marshes. Theory dependency (subconscious favoring of identifying and/or examining natural phenomena that tend to confirm rather than refute the current paradigm of a study system [Kuhn 1962]&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T. 1962. The structure of scientific revolutions. University of Chicago Press, Chicago, Illinois.&lt;/ref&gt;) and demonstration, rather than falsifying science, have been the leading culprits in this oversight. Consequently, threats to salt marshes that are governed by top down control are being overlooked, with potentially devastating consequences.

Trophic cascades are powerful interactions that strongly regulate [[biodiversity]], community structure, and ecosystem function. Trophic cascades were originally thought to be rare, but it has become clear that they occur across diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine ecosystems at both small and large spatial and temporal scales. Trophic cascades are common and pervasive aspects of many communities long thought to be controlled by bottom-up forces and/or resistant to consumer control.
 
Conservation of ecosystems affected by trophic cascades has thus not adequately incorporated top-down control into their management and restoration plans and efforts, but emerging research has emphasized that this is necessary to protect the services provided by these ecosystems and to restore these ecosystems to their original conditions. Failure to do so could lead to trophic cascades transforming highly diverse and productive plant communities to barren flats. 
 
Additionally, failure to reevaluate the current paradigm and recognize that both bottom-up and top-down forces affect many features of ecosystem structure and function, and that these forces are complementary rather than contradictory, could bar any incorporation of both mechanisms into any management plan and reduce the success of conservation efforts before they even begin.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9976">'''Siltation''' or '''siltification''' is the [[water pollution|pollution of water]] by particulate [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]] [[Clastic rock|clastic]] material, with a particle size dominated by [[silt]] or [[clay]]. It refers both to the increased concentration of suspended sediments, and to the increased accumulation (temporary or permanent) of fine sediments on bottoms where they are undesirable. Siltation is most often caused by [[soil erosion]] or sediment spill.

Sometimes siltation is called ''sediment pollution'', although that is an undesirable term since it is ambiguous, and can also be used to refer to a chemical contamination of sediments accumulated on the bottom, or pollutants bound to sediment particles. Siltation is the preferred term for being unambigiuous, even if not entirely stringent since it also includes other particle sizes than silt.

==Causes==

[[File:Jacuecanga Angra dos Reis Rio de Janeiro Brazil Brasfels.JPG|thumb|Siltation caused by sewage sludge from [[shipyard]] – [[Rio de Janeiro]].]]

The origin of the increased sediment transport into an area may be erosion on land, or activities in the water.

In rural areas the erosion source is typically soil degradation due to intensive or inadequate agricultural practices, leading to [[soil erosion]], especially in fine-grained soils such as [[loess]]. The result will be an increased amount of silt and clay in the water bodies that drain the area. In urban areas the erosion source is typically construction activities, since this involves clearing the original land-covering vegetation and temporarily creating something akin to an urban desert from which fines are easily washed out during rainstorms.

In water the main pollution source is sediment spill from [[dredging]], from the transportation of dredged material on barges, and the deposition of dredged material in or near water. Such deposition may be made to get rid of unwanted material, such as the [[offshore dumping]] of material dredged from harbours and navigation channels. The deposition may also have as purpose to build up the coastline, [[artificial island]]s, or for [[beach replenishment]].

[[Climate change]] also affect siltation rates.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important cause of siltation is the [[septage]] and other [[sewage sludge]]s that are discharged from households or business establishments with no [[septic tank]]s or [[wastewater treatment facility|wastewater treatment]] facilities to bodies of water.

==Vulnerabilities==
[[File:Siltation or Sedimentation.jpg|thumb|Siltation of a waterway]]
[[File:muddy USGS.jpg|thumb|right|Silted river polluted by sediment.]]
While the [[sediment]] in [[sediment transport|transport]] is in [[suspension (chemistry)|suspension]], it acts as a pollutant for those who require clean water. This includes uses such as for cooling or in industrial processes, and it includes aquatic life that are sensitive to suspended material in the water. While [[nekton]] have been found to avoid spill plumes in the water (e.g. the environmental monitoring project during the building of the [[Øresund Bridge]]), filtering [[benthic]] organisms have no way of escape. Among the most sensitive organisms are [[coral]] polyps. Generally speaking, hard bottom communities and mussel banks (including oysters) are more sensitive to siltation than sand and mud bottoms. Unlike in the sea, in a stream the plume will cover the entire channel, except possibly for backwaters, which is why fish will also be directly affected in most cases.

Siltation can also affect navigation channels, or irrigation channels. It refers to the undesired accumulation of sediments in channels intended for vessels, or for distributing water.

==Measurement and monitoring==
[[File:SediMeter sensor.jpg|thumb|A sensor for measuring siltation ''in situ''.]]
One may distinguish between measurements at the source, during transport, and within the affected area. Source measurements of erosion may be very difficult, since the lost material may be a fraction of a millimeter per year. Therefore, the approach taken is typically to measure the sediment in transport in the stream, by measuring the sediment concentration and multiplying that with the [[Discharge (hydrology)|discharge]]; for example, 50&amp;nbsp;mg/L times 30 m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/s gives 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg/s.

Also sediment spill is better measured in transport than at the source. The sediment transport in open water is estimated by measuring the [[turbidity]], correlating turbidity to sediment concentration (using a regression developed from water samples that are filtered, dried, and weighed), multiplying the concentration with the discharge as above, and integrating over the entire plume. To distinguish the spill contribution, the background turbidity is subtracted from the spill plume turbidity. Since the spill plume in open water varies in space and time, an integration over the entire plume is required, and repeated many times to get acceptably low uncertainty in the results. These measurements are made close to the source, in the order of a few hundred meters.

Anything beyond a work area buffer zone for sediment spill is considered the potential impact area. In the open sea the impact of concern is almost exclusively with the [[sessility (zoology)|sessile]] bottom communities, since empirical data show that fish effectively avoid the impacted area. The siltation chiefly affects the bottom community in two ways: The suspended sediment may interfere with the food gathering of filtering organisms, and the sediment accumulation on the bottom may bury organisms to the point that they starve or even die. Only if the concentration is extreme will it decrease the light level sufficiently for impacting primary productivity. An accumulation of as little as 1&amp;nbsp;mm may kill coral polyps.

While the effect of the siltation on the biota (once the harm is already done) can be studied by repeated inspection of selected test plots, the magnitude of the siltation process in the impact area may be measured directly by monitoring in real time. Parameters to measure are sediment accumulation, turbidity at the level of the filtering biota, and optionally incident light.&lt;ref&gt;Siltation Monitoring Plan excerpt, retrieved 2010-07-11, http://lindorm.com/beaches/sedmon2.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Siltation of the magnitude that it affects shipping can also be monitored by repeated [[bathymetry|bathymetric surveys]].

==Mitigation==
[[File:Key Biscayne Crandon Park beach.jpg|thumb|Resuspension of fines from a replenished beach causing siltation offshore]]
In rural areas the first line of defense is to maintain land cover and prevent soil erosion in the first place. The second line of defense is to trap the material before it reaches the stream network (known as [[sediment control]]). In urban areas the defense is to keep land uncovered for as short a time as possible during construction, and to use silt screens to prevent the sediment from getting released in water bodies. During dredging the spill can be minimized but not eliminated completely through the way the dredger is designed and operated. If the material is deposited on land, efficient sedimentation basins can be constructed. If it is dumped in relatively deep water there will be a significant spill during dumping, but not thereafter, and the spill that does arise will have minimal impact if there are only fine-sediment bottoms nearby.

One of the most difficult conflicts of interest to resolve, as regards siltation mitigation, is perhaps [[beach nourishment]]. When sediments are placed on or near beaches in order to replenish an eroding beach, any fines in the material will continue to be washed out for as long as the sand is being reworked. Given that all replenished beaches are eroding (or else they would not need replenishment), they will contribute to nearshore siltation almost for as long as it takes to erode away what was added, albeit with somewhat decreasing intensity over time. Since this leakage is detrimental to coral reefs, the practice leads to a direct conflict between the public interest of saving beaches, and preserving any nearshore coral reefs. To minimize the conflict, beach replenishment should only be done with sand not containing any silt or clay fractions. In practice the sand is often taken from offshore [[borrow area|borrowing areas]], and since the proportion of fines in sediments typically increases in the offshore direction, the deposited sand will inevitably contain a significant percentage of siltation-contributing fines.

It is desirable to minimize the siltation of irrigation channels by hydrologic design, the objective being not to create zones with falling sediment transport capacity, as that is conducive to sedimentation. Once sedimentation has occurred, in irrigation or navigation channels, dredging is often the only remedy.

The term '''skin flora''' (also commonly referred to as '''skin microbiota''') refers to the microorganisms which reside on the skin, typically human skin.

Many of them are [[bacterium|bacteria]] of which there are around 1000 species upon human skin from nineteen  [[Phylum|phyla]].&lt;ref name="Grice"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Grice EA, Kong HH, Conlan S | year = 2009 | title = Topographical and Temporal Diversity of the Human Skin Microbiome | url = | journal = Science | volume = 324 | issue = 5931| pages = 1190–1192 | doi = 10.1126/science.1171700 | pmid = 19478181 | pmc=2805064}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pappas"&gt;Pappas S.

ScienceNOW Daily News&lt;/ref&gt;  Most are found in the superficial layers of the [[Epidermis (skin)|epidermis]] and the upper parts of [[hair follicle]]s.

Skin flora is usually non-pathogenic, and either [[commensalism|commensal]] (are not harmful to their host) or [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] (offer a benefit). The benefits bacteria can offer include preventing transient [[pathogenic]] organisms from [[Infection#Colonization|colonizing]] the skin surface, either by competing for nutrients, secreting chemicals against them, or stimulating the skin's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Cogen AL, Nizet V, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Skin microbiota: a source of disease or defence? | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 158 | issue = 3| pages = 442–55 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2133.2008.08437.x | pmid = 18275522 | pmc=2746716}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, resident microbes can cause [[skin disease]]s and enter the [[blood system]], creating life-threatening diseases, particularly in [[immunosuppressed]] people.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

A major non-human skin flora is ''[[Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis]]'', a [[chytrid]] and non-hyphal zoosporic fungus that causes [[chytridiomycosis]], an infectious disease thought to be responsible for the [[decline in amphibian populations]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}.

==Species variety==
===Bacteria===
[[image:Staphylococcus epidermidis 01.png|thumb|300px|[[Scanning electron microscope]] image of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' one of roughly a thousand [[bacteria]] species present on human [[skin]]. Though usually not [[pathogenic]], it can cause [[skin infection]]s and even life-threatening illnesses in those that are [[immunocompromised]].]]

The estimate of the number of species present on skin bacteria has been radically changed by the use of [[16S ribosomal RNA]] to identify bacterial species present on skin samples direct from their genetic material. Previously such identification had depended upon [[microbiological culture]] upon which many varieties of bacteria did not grow and so were hidden to science.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' were thought from cultural based research to be dominant. However [[16S ribosomal RNA]] research finds that while common, these species make up only 5% of skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Grice08"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Grice EA, Kong HH, Renaud G, Young AC, Bouffard GG, Blakesley RW, Wolfsberg TG, Turner ML, Segre JA | year = 2008 | title = A diversity profile of the human skin microbiota | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2493393&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Genome Res | volume = 18 | issue = 7| pages = 1043–50 | pmid = 18502944 | doi=10.1101/gr.075549.107 | pmc=2493393}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, skin variety provides a rich and diverse habitat for [[bacteria]]. Most come from four phyla: [[Actinobacteria]] (51.8%), [[Firmicutes]] (24.4%), [[Proteobacteria]] (16.5%), and [[Bacteroidetes]] (6.3%).
[[File:Skin Microbiome20161-300.jpg|thumb|ecology of the 20 sites on the skin studied in the Human Microbiome Project]]

There are three main ecological areas: sebaceous, moist, and dry. ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' and ''[[Staphylococci]]'' species were the main species in [[sebaceous]] areas. In moist places on the body ''[[Corynebacteria]]'' together with ''[[Staphylococci]]'' dominate. In dry areas, there is a mixture of species but b-[[Proteobacteria]] and [[Flavobacteriales]] are dominant. Ecologically, sebaceous areas had greater species richness than moist and dry one. The areas with least similarity between people in species were the spaces between [[finger]]s, the spaces between [[toe]]s, [[axillae]], and [[umbilical cord]] stump. Most similarly were beside the [[nostril]], [[nare]]s (inside the nostril), and on the back.&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

===Fungal===
A study of the area between toes in 100 young adults found 14 different genera of fungi. These include [[yeast]]s such as ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Rhodotorula|Rhodotorula rubra]]'', ''[[Torulopsis]]'' and ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', [[dermatophytes]] (skin living fungi) such as ''[[Microsporum gypseum]]'',  and ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' and [[nondermatophyte]] fungi (opportunistic fungi that can live in skin) such as ''[[Rhizopus stolonifer]]'', ''[[Trichosporon cutaneum]]'', ''[[Fusarium]]'', ''[[Scopulariopsis brevicaulis]]'', ''[[Curvularia]]'', ''[[Alternaria alternata]]'', ''[[Paecilomyces]]'', ''[[Aspergillus flavus]]'' and ''[[Penicillium]]'' species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Oyeka CA, Ugwu LO | year = 2002 | title = Fungal flora of human toe webs | url = | journal = Mycoses | volume = 45 | issue = 11–12| pages = 488–91 | pmid = 12472726 | doi=10.1046/j.1439-0507.2002.00796.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by the [[National Human Genome Research Institute]] in [[Bethesda, Maryland]], researched the DNA of human skin fungi at 14 different locations on the body. These were the ear canal, between the eyebrows, the back of the head, behind the ear, the heel, toenails, between the toes, forearm, back, groin, nostrils, chest, palm, and the crook of the elbow. The study showed a large fungal diversity across the body, the richest habitat being the heel, which hosts about 80 species of fungi. By way of contrast, there are some 60 species in toenail clippings and 40 between the toes. Other rich areas are the palm, forearm and inside the elbow, with from 18 to 32 species. The head and the trunk hosted between 2 and 10 each.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-22622689 BBC News item]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Belly Button Biodiversity Project began at North Carolina State University in early 2011 with two initial groups of 35 and 25 volunteers.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  Volunteers were given sterile cotton swabs and were asked to insert the cotton swabs into their navels, to turn the cotton swab around three times and then return the cotton swab to the researchers in a vial &lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"&gt;{{cite web|last=Parker-Pope|first=Tara|title=What's in Your Belly Button|url=http://well.blogs.nytimes.com/2011/04/14/whats-in-your-belly-button/?_r=1|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;   that contained a 0.5 ml 10% phosphate saline buffer.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;   Researchers at North Carolina State University, led by Jiri Hulcr,&lt;ref name="Nierenberg"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nierenberg|first=Cari|title=New meaning to 'navel-gazing': Scientists study Belly Button Bacteria|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/health/new-meaning-navel-gazing-scientists-study-belly-button-bacteria-1C6437445?franchiseSlug=healthmain|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  then grew the samples in a culture until the bacterial colonies were large enough to be photographed and then these pictures were posted on the Belly Button Biodiversity Project’s  website (volunteers were given sample numbers so that they could view their own samples online).&lt;ref name="Parker-Pope"/&gt;  These samples then were analyzed using 16S rDNA libraries so that strains that did not grow well in cultures could be identified.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

The researchers at North Carolina State University discovered that while it was difficult to predict every strain of bacteria in the microbiome of the navel that they could predict which strains would be prevalent and which strains of bacteria would be quite rare in the microbiome.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  It was found that the navel microbiomes only contained a few prevalent types of bacteria (Staphylococcus, Corynebacterium, Actinobacteria, Clostridiales, and Bacilli) and many different types of rare bacteria.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt; Other types of rare organisms were discovered inside the navels of the volunteers including three types of Archaea (an organism that usually lives in only extreme environments){{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} and two of the three types of Archaea were found in one volunteer who claimed not to have bathed or showered for many years.&lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;

''Staphylococcus'' and ''Corynebacterium'' were among the most common types of bacteria found in the navels of this project’s volunteers and these types of bacteria have been found to be the most common types of bacteria found on the human skin in larger studies of the skin microbiome  &lt;ref name="Callewaert"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Callewaert|first=Chris|author2=Frederiek-Maarten Kerckhof |author3=Michael S.

According to the Belly Button Biodiversity Project &lt;ref name="Hulcr"/&gt;  at North Carolina State University, there are two types of microorganisms found in the navel and surrounding areas. Transient bacteria (bacteria that does not reproduce) &lt;ref name="Kong"/&gt;    forms  the majority of the organisms found in the navel, and an estimated 1400 various strains were found in 95% of participants of the study.&lt;ref name="saunders-blog"&gt;{{Cite web| last = Saunders| first = Chris| title = Navel gazing at NC State leads to important discovery| work = Red &amp; White for Life :: NC State University Alumni Association| accessdate = 2013-04-20| date = 2011-07-12| url = http://www.alumniblog.ncsu.edu/2011/07/12/navel-gazing-at-nc-state-leads-to-important-discovery/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relationship to host ==
Skin microflora can be [[commensalism|commensal]]s, [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualistic]] or [[pathogen]]s. Often they can be all three depending upon the strength of the person's [[immune system]].&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; Research upon the immune system in the [[Gut (zoology)|gut]] and [[lungs]] has shown that microflora aids immunity development: however such research has only started upon whether this is the case with the skin.&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt; ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' is an example of a mutualistic bacterium that can turn into a pathogen and cause disease: if it gains entry into the blood system it can result in infections in bone, joint, gastrointestinal, and respiratory systems. It can also cause [[dermatitis]]. However, Pseudomonas aeruginosa produces antimicrobial substances such as pseudomonic acid (that are exploited commercially such as [[Mupirocin]]). This works against  [[staphylococcal]] and [[streptococcal]] infections.  Pseudomonas aeruginosa also produces substances that inhibit the growth of [[fungus]] species such as ''[[Candida krusei]]'', ''[[Candida albicans]]'', ''[[Torulopsis glabrata]]'', ''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae]]'' and ''[[Aspergillus fumigatus]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kerr JR | year = 1994 | title = Suppression of fungal growth exhibited by Pseudomonas aeruginosa | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=263067&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 32 | issue = 2| pages = 525–7 | pmid = 8150966 | pmc=263067}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also inhibit the growth of ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krausse R, Piening K, Ullmann U | year = 2005 | title = Inhibitory effects of various micro-organisms on the growth of Helicobacter pylori | url = | journal = Lett Appl Microbiol | volume = 40 | issue = 1| pages = 81–6 | doi = 10.1111/j.1472-765X.2004.01632.x | pmid = 15613007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; So important is its antimicrobial actions that it has been noted that "removing ''P. aeruginosa'' from the skin, through use of oral or topical antibiotics, may inversely allow for aberrant yeast colonization and infection."&lt;ref name="Cogen"/&gt;

Another aspect of bacteria is the generation of [[body odor]]. [[Sweat]] is odorless however several bacteria may consume it and create byproducts which may be considered putrid by man (as in contrast to flies, for example, that may find them attractive/appealing).
Several examples are:
* ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' in  adolescent and adult sebaceous glands can turn its [[amino acid]]s into [[propionic acid]].
* ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' creates body odor by breaking sweat into [[isovaleric acid]] (3-methyl butanoic acid).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, etal |title=Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control |journal=Can.

* ''[[Bacillus subtilis]]'' creates strong foot odor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ara K, Hama M, Akiba S, Koike K, Okisaka K, Hagura T, Kamiya T, Tomita F | year = 2006 | title = Foot odor due to microbial metabolism and its control | url = | journal = Can J Microbiol | volume = 52 | issue = 4| pages = 357–64 | pmid = 16699586 | doi=10.1139/w05-130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skin defenses==
===Antimicrobial peptides===
The skin creates [[antimicrobial peptides]] such as [[cathelicidin]]s  that control the proliferation of skin microbes. Cathelicidins not only reduce microbe numbers directly but also cause the secretion of [[cytokine]] release which induces [[inflammation]], [[angiogenesis]], and [[reepithelialization]]. Conditions such as [[atopic dermatitis]] have been linked to the suppression in cathelicidin production. In [[rosacea]] abnormal processing of cathelicidin cause inflammation. [[Psoriasis]] has been linked to self-DNA created from cathelicidin peptides that causes [[Autoimmunity|autoinflammation]]. A major factor controlling cathelicidin is [[vitamin D3|vitamin D&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Schauber J, Gallo RL | year = 2008 | title = Antimicrobial peptides and the skin immune defense system | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=2639779&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Allergy Clin Immunol | volume = 122 | issue = 2| pages = 261–6 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaci.2008.03.027 | pmid = 18439663 | pmc=2639779}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The superficial layers of the skin are naturally acidic ([[pH]] 4-4.5) due to lactic acid in [[sweat]] and produced by skin bacteria.&lt;ref name="Lambers"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lambers H, Piessens S, Bloem A, Pronk H, Finkel P | year = 2006 | title = Natural skin surface pH is on average below 5, which is beneficial for its resident flora | url = | journal = Int J Cosmet Sci. | volume = 28 | issue = 5| pages = 359–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.1467-2494.2006.00344.x | pmid = 18489300 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this pH mutualistic flora such as ''[[Staphylococci]]'', ''[[Micrococci]]'', ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacteria]]'' grow but not transient bacteria such as [[Gram negative bacteria]] like ''[[Escherichia]]'' and ''[[Pseudomonas]]'' or [[Gram positive]] ones such as ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]''.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; Another factor affecting the growth of pathological bacteria is that the antimicrobial substances secreted by the skin are enhanced in acidic conditions.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt; In alkaline conditions, bacteria cease to be attached to the skin and are more readily shed. It has been observed that the skin also swells  under alkaline conditions and opens up allowing move to the surface.&lt;ref name="Lambers"/&gt;

===Immune system===
If activated, the [[immune system]] in the skin produces [[cell-mediated immunity]] against microbes such as [[dermatophyte]]s (skin fungi).&lt;ref name="Dahl"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dahl MV | year = 1993 | title = Suppression of immunity and inflammation by products produced by dermatophytes | url = | journal = J Am Acad Dermatol | volume = 28 | issue = 5 Pt 1| pages = S19–S23 | pmid = 8496406 | doi=10.1016/s0190-9622(09)80303-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; One reaction is to increase [[stratum corneum]] turnover and so shed the fungus from the skin surface. Skin fungi such as ''[[Trichophyton rubrum]]'' have evolved to create substances that limit the immune response to them.&lt;ref name="Dahl"/&gt; The shedding of skin is a general means to control the buildup of flora upon the skin surface.

==Skin diseases==
Microorganisms play a role in noninfectious [[Bacterial skin disease|skin disease]]s such as [[atopic dermatitis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authorlink1=Bruce Baker (geneticist) | author = Baker BS | year = 2006 | title = The role of microorganisms in atopic dermatitis | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1809642&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Exp Immunol | volume = 144 | issue = 1| pages = 1–9 | doi = 10.1111/j.1365-2249.2005.02980.x | pmid = 16542358 | pmc=1809642}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[rosacea]], [[psoriasis]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Paulino LC, Tseng CH, Strober BE, Blaser MJ |authorlink4=Martin Blaser | year = 2006 | title = Molecular analysis of fungal microbiota in samples from healthy human skin and psoriatic lesions | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1594634&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = J Clin Microbiol | volume = 44 | issue = 8| pages = 2933–41 | doi = 10.1128/JCM.00785-06 | pmid = 16891514 | pmc=1594634}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[acne]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Holland KT, Cunliffe WJ, Roberts CD | year = 1977 | title = Acne vulgaris: an investigation into the number of anaerobic diphtheroids and members of the Micrococcaceae in normal and acne skin | url = | journal = Br J Dermatol | volume = 96 | issue = 6| pages = 623–6 | pmid = 141301 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2133.1977.tb05206.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Damaged skin can cause nonpathogenic bacteria to become [[pathogenic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Roth RR, James WD | year = 1988 | title = Microbial ecology of the skin | url = | journal = Annu Rev Microbiol | volume = 42 | issue = 1| pages = 441–64 | doi = 10.1146/annurev.mi.42.100188.002301 | pmid = 3144238 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The diversity of species on the skin is related to later development of dermatitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=Michael R.|last2=Gallo|first2=Richard L.|title=Evidence that Human Skin Microbiome Dysbiosis Promotes Atopic Dermatitis|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022202X17329603|journal=Journal of Investigative Dermatology|volume=137|issue=12|pages=2460–2461|doi=10.1016/j.jid.2017.09.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acne vulgaris===
[[Acne vulgaris]] is a common skin condition characterised by excessive sebum production by the [[sebaceous gland|pilosebaceous unit]] and inflammation of the skin.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fitz-Gibbon|first1=S|last2=Shuta|first2=T|last3=Bor-Han|first3=C|last4=Nguyen|first4=L|last5=Du|first5=C|last6=Minghsun|first6=L|last7=Elashoff|first7=D|last8=Erfe|first8=MC|last9=Loncaric|first9=A|last10=Kim|first10=J|last11=Modlin|first11=RL|last12=Miller|first12=JF|last13=Sodergren|first13=E|last14=Craft|first14=N|last15=Weinstock|first15=GM|last16=Li|first16=H|title=''Propionibacterium acnes'' Strain Populations in the Human Skin Microbiome Associated with Acne|journal=J Invest Dermatol|date=2013|volume=133|issue=9|pages=2152–2160|doi=10.1038/jid.2013.21|pmid=23337890|url=http://www.nature.com/jid/journal/v133/n9/full/jid201321a.html|pmc=3745799}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affected areas are typically colonised by ''[[Propionibacterium acnes]]''; a member of the [[Commensalism|commensal]] microbiota even in those without acne.&lt;ref name="Grice2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grice|first1=EA|title=The skin microbiome: potential for novel diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to cutaneous disease|journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg.|date=2014|volume=33|issue=2|pages=98–103|pmid=25085669|pmc=4425451|url=http://www.edermatologynews.com/scms-journal/volume-33/june-precision-medicine/single-view/the-skin-microbiome-potential-for-novel-diagnostic-and-therapeutic-approaches-to-cutaneous-disease/9077f05398694bf23b88073641fcfa8d.html|doi=10.12788/j.sder.0087}}&lt;/ref&gt; High populations of ''P. acnes'' are linked to acne vulgaris although only certain strains are strongly associated with acne while others with healthy skin. The relative population of ''P. acnes'' is similar between those with acne and those without.&lt;ref name="Fitz-Gibbon2013" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;

Current treatment includes topical and systemic antibacterial drugs which result in decreased ''P. acnes'' colonisation and/or activity.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hannigan|first1=GD|last2=Grice|first2=EA|title=Microbial ecology of the skin in the era of metagenomics and molecular microbiology|journal=Cold Spring Harb Perpect Med|date=2013|volume=3|issue=12|page=a015362|doi=10.1101/cshperspect.a015362|pmid=24296350|pmc=3839604}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatment includes the use of ''[[Staphylococcus epidermidis]]'' to inhibit ''P. acnes'' growth. ''S. epidermidis'' produces [[succinic acid]] which has been shown to inhibit ''P. acnes'' growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muya|first1=S|last2=Wang|first2=Y|last3=Yu|first3=J|last4=Kuo|first4=S|last5=Coda|first5=A|last6=Jiang|first6=Y|last7=Gallo|first7=RL|last8=Huang|first8=CM|title=Fermentation of ''Propionibacterium acnes'', a Commensal Bacterium in the Human Skin Microbiome, as Skin Probiotics against Methicillin-Resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus''|journal=PLoS ONE|date=2013|volume=8|issue=2|page=e55380|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0055380|pmc=3566139|pmid=23405142}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Lactobacillus plantarum]]'' has also been shown to act as an anti-inflammatory and improve antimicrobial properties of the skin when applied topically. It was also shown to be effective in reducing acne lesion size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Muizzuddin|first1=N|last2=Maher|first2=W|last3=Sullivan|first3=M|last4=Schnittger|first4=S|last5=Mammone|first5=T|title=Physiological effect of probiotic on skin.|journal=J Cosmet Sci|date=2012|volume=63|issue=6|pages=385–95|pmid=23286870}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Atopic Dermatitis===
Individuals with [[atopic dermatitis]] have shown an increase in populations of ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'' in both [[lesion]]al and nonlesional skin.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Atopic dermatitis flares are associated with low bacterial diversity due to colonisation by ''S. aureus'' and following [[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|standard treatment]], bacterial diversity has been seen to increase.

[[Atopic dermatitis#Treatments|Current treatments]] include combinations of topical or systemic antibiotics, [[corticosteroids]], and diluted bleach baths.&lt;ref name="Kong2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kong|first1=HH|last2=Oh|first2=J|last3=Deming|first3=C|last4=Conlan|first4=S|last5=Grice|first5=EA|last6=Beatson|first6=MA|last7=Nomicos|first7=E|last8=Polley|first8=EC|last9=Komarow|first9=HD|last10=NISC Comparative Sequence Program|last11=Murray|first11=PR|last12=Turner|first12=ML|last13=Segre|first13=JA|title=Temporal shifts in the skin microbiome associated with disease flares and treatment in children with atopic dermatitis|journal=Genome Res|date=2012|volume=22|issue=5|pages=850–9|doi=10.1101/gr.131029.111|pmid=22310478|pmc=3337431}}&lt;/ref&gt; Potential probiotic treatments include using the commensal skin bacteria, ''S. epidermidis'', to inhibit ''S. aureus'' growth. During atopic dermatitis flares, population levels of ''S. epidermidis'' has been shown to increase as an attempt to control ''S. aureus populations''.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kong2012" /&gt;

Low [[Gut flora|gut microbial]] diversity in babies has been associated with an increased risk of atopic dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Abrahamsson|first1=TR|last2=Jakobsson|first2=HE|last3=Andersson|first3=AF|last4=Björkstén|first4=B|last5=Engstrand|first5=L|last6=Jenmalm|first6=MC|title=Low diversity of the gut microbiota in infants with atopic eczema|journal=J Allergy Clin Immunol|date=2012|volume=129|issue=2|pages=434–40, 440.e1–2|doi=10.1016/j.jaci.2011.10.025|pmid=22153774}}&lt;/ref&gt; Infants with atopic eczema have low levels of ''[[Bacteroides]]'' and high levels of [[Firmicutes]]. ''Bacteroides'' have anti-inflammatory properties which are essential against dermatitis.&lt;ref name="Abrahamsson2012" /&gt; (See [[gut microbiota]])

===Psoriasis vulgaris===
[[Psoriasis|Psoriasis vulgaris]] typically affects drier skin sites such as elbows and knees. Dry areas of the skin tend to have high microbial diversity and fewer populations than sebaceous sites.&lt;ref name="Hannigan2013" /&gt; A study using [[Cotton swab#Usage|swab sampling techniques]] show areas rich in [[Firmicutes]] (mainly ''[[Streptococcus]]'' and ''[[Staphylococcus]]'') and [[Actinobacteria]] (mainly ''[[Corynebacterium]]'' and ''[[Propionibacterium]]'') are associated with psoriasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Alekseyenko|first1=AV|last2=Perez-Perez|first2=GI|last3=De Souza|first3=A|last4=Strober|first4=B|last5=Gao|first5=Z|last6=Bihan|first6=M|last7=Li|first7=K|last8=Methé|first8=BA|last9=Blaser|first9=MJ|title=Community differentiation of the cutaneous microbiota in psoriasis|journal=Microbiome|date=2013|volume=1|issue=1|page=31|doi=10.1186/2049-2618-1-31|pmid=24451201|pmc=4177411}}&lt;/ref&gt; While another study using [[biopsy|biopsies]] associate increased levels of Firmicutes and Actinobacteria with healthy skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fahlén|first1=A|last2=Engstrand|first2=L|last3=Baker|first3=BS|last4=Powles|first4=A|last5=Fry|first5=L|title=Comparison of bacterial microbiota in skin biopsies from normal and psoriatic skin.|journal=Arch Dermatol Res|date=2012|volume=304|issue=1|pages=15–22|doi=10.1007/s00403-011-1189-x|pmid=22065152}}&lt;/ref&gt; However most studies show that individuals affected by psoriasis have a lower microbial diversity in the affected areas.

Treatments for psoriasis include topical agents, phototherapy, and systemic agents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Menter|first1=A|last2=Griffiths|first2=CE|title=Current and future management of psoriasis.|journal=Lancet|date=2007|volume=370|issue=9583|pages=272–84|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(07)61129-5|pmid=17658398}}&lt;/ref&gt; Current research on the skin microbiota's role in psoriasis is inconsistent therefore there are no potential probiotic treatments.

===Rosacea===
[[Rosacea]] is typically connected to [[sebaceous gland|sebaceous]] sites of the skin. The skin [[mite]] ''[[Demodex folliculorum]]'' produce [[lipases]] that allow them to use sebum as a source of food therefore they have a high affinity for sebaceous skin sites. Although it is a part of the commensal skin microbiota, patients affected with rosacea show an increase in ''D. folliculorum'' compared to healthy individuals, suggesting [[pathogenicity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Casas|first1=C|last2=Paul|first2=C|last3=Lahfa|first3=M|last4=Livideanu|first4=B|last5=Lejeune|first5=O|last6=Alvarez-Georges|first6=S|last7=Saint-Martory|first7=C|last8=Degouy|first8=A|last9=Mengeaud|first9=V|last10=Ginisty|first10=H|last11=Durbise|first11=E|last12=Schmitt|first12=AM|last13=Redoulès|first13=D|title=Quantification of ''Demodex folliculorum'' by PCR in rosacea and its relationship to skin innate immune activation.|journal=Exp Dermatol|date=2012|volume=21|issue=12|pages=906–10|doi=10.1111/exd.12030|pmid=23171449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Bacillus oleronius]]'', a ''[[Demodex]]'' associated microbe, is not typically found in the commensal skin microbiota but initiates inflammatory pathways whose starting mechanism is similar to rosacea patients.&lt;ref name="Grice2014" /&gt; Populations of ''S. epidermidis'' have also been isolated from pustules of rosacea patients. However it is possible that they were moved by ''Demodex'' to areas that favour growth as ''Demodex'' has shown to transport bacteria around the face.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jarmuda|first1=S|last2=O'Reilly|first2=N|last3=Zaba|first3=R|last4=Jakubowicz|first4=O|last5=Szkaradkiewicz|first5=A|last6=Kavanagh|first6=K|title=Potential role of Demodex mites and bacteria in the induction of rosacea.|journal=J Med Microbiol|date=2012|volume=61|issue=Pt 11|pages=1504–10|doi=10.1099/jmm.0.048090-0|pmid=22933353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current treatments include topical and oral antibiotics and laser therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cohen|first1=AF|last2=Tiemstra|first2=JD|title=Diagnosis and treatment of rosacea|journal=J Am Board Fam Pract.|date=2002|volume=15|issue=3|pages=214–7|pmid=12038728}}&lt;/ref&gt; As current research has yet to show a clear mechanism for ''Demodex'' influence in rosacea, there are no potential probiotic treatments.

==Clinical==
===Infected devices ===
Skin microbes are a potential source of infected medical devices such as [[catheters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martín-Rabadán P, Gijón P, Alcalá L, Rodríguez-Créixems M, Alvarado N, Bouza E | year = 2008 | title = Propionibacterium acnes is a common colonizer of intravascular catheters | url = | journal = J Infect | volume = 56 | issue = 4| pages = 257–60 | doi = 10.1016/j.jinf.2008.01.012 | pmid = 18336916 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
It is important to note that the human skin is host to numerous bacterial and fungal species, some of which are known to be harmful, some known to be beneficial and the vast majority unresearched. The use of bactericidal and fungicidal soaps will inevitably lead to bacterial and fungal populations which are resistant to the chemicals employed. (see [[Drug resistance]])

===Contagion===
Skin flora do not readily pass between people: 30 seconds of  moderate friction and dry hand contact results in a transfer of only  0.07% of natural hand flora from naked with a greater percentage from gloves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lingaas E, Fagernes M | year = 2009 | title = Development of a method to measure bacterial transfer from hands | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 72 | issue = 1| pages = 43–9 | doi = 10.1016/j.jhin.2009.01.022 | pmid = 19282052 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Removal===
The most effective (60 to 80% reduction) antimicrobial washing is with [[ethanol]], [[isopropanol]], and [[n-propanol]]. [[Viruses]] are most affected by high (95%) concentrations of ethanol, while bacteria are more affected by  n-propanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kampf G, Kramer A | year = 2004 | title = Epidemiologic background of hand hygiene and evaluation of the most important agents for scrubs and rubs | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=523567&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Clin Microbiol Rev | volume = 17 | issue = 4| pages = 863–93 | doi = 10.1128/CMR.17.4.863-893.2004 | pmid = 15489352 | pmc=523567}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unmedicated soaps are not very effective as illustrated by the following data. Health care workers washed their hands once in nonmedicated liquid soap for 30 seconds. The students/technicians for 20 times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Borges LF, Silva BL, Gontijo Filho PP | year = 2007 | title = Hand washing: changes in the skin flora | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 35 | issue = 6| pages = 417–20 | doi = 10.1016/j.ajic.2006.07.012 | pmid = 17660014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An important use of [[hand washing]] is to prevent the [[Nosocomial infection#Transmission|transmission]] of [[antibiotic resistant]] skin flora that cause [[hospital-acquired infection]]s such as [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']]. While such flora have become antibiotic resistant due to antibiotics there is no evidence that recommended antiseptics or disinfectants selects for antibiotic-resistant organisms when used in hand washing.&lt;ref name="Weber"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Weber DJ, Rutala WA |title=Use of germicides in the home and the healthcare setting: is there a relationship between germicide use and antibiotic resistance? |journal=Infect Control Hosp Epidemiol |volume=27 |issue=10 |pages=1107–19 |year=2006 |pmid=17006819 |doi=10.1086/507964}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, many strains of organisms are resistant to some of the substances used in antibacterial soaps such as [[Triclosan]].&lt;ref name="Weber"/&gt;

One survey of [[soap|bar soaps]] in dentist clinics found they all had their own flora and on average from two to five different genera of microorganisms with those used most more likely to have more species varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hegde PP, Andrade AT, Bhat K | year = 2006 | title = Microbial contamination of "in use" bar soap in dental clinics | url = http://www.ijdr.in/article.asp?issn=0970-9290;year=2006;volume=17;issue=2;spage=70;epage=3;aulast=Hegde | journal = Indian J Dent Res | volume = 17 | issue = 2| pages = 70–3 | pmid = 17051871 | doi=10.4103/0970-9290.29888}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another survey of bar soaps in public toilets found even more flora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kabara JJ, Brady MB | year = 1984 | title = Contamination of bar soaps under "in-use" conditions | url = | journal = J Environ Pathol Toxicol Oncol | volume = 5 | issue = 4–5| pages = 1–14 | pmid = 6394740 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that very dry soaps are not infected while all are that rest in pools of water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Afolabi BA, Oduyebo OO, Ogunsola FT | year = 2007 | title = Bacterial flora of commonly used soaps in three hospitals in Nigeria | url = | journal = East Afr Med J | volume = 84 | issue = 10| pages = 489–95 | pmid = 18232270 | doi=10.4314/eamj.v84i10.9567}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, research upon soap that was specially infected found that soap flora do not transmit to the hands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Heinze JE, Yackovich F | year = 1988 | title = Washing with contaminated bar soap is unlikely to transfer bacteria | url = | journal = Epidemiol Infect | volume = 101 | issue = 1| pages = 135–42 | pmid = 3402545 | pmc=2249330 | doi=10.1017/s0950268800029290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Damaged skin===
Washing skin repeatedly can damage the protective external layer and cause transepidermal loss of water. This can be seen in roughness characterized by scaling and dryness, itchiness, [[dermatitis]] provoked by microorganisms and [[allergen]]s penetrating the corneal layer and redness. Wearing gloves can cause further problems since it produces a humid environment favoring the growth of microbes and also contains irritants such as [[latex]] and [[talcum powder]].&lt;ref name="Larson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Larson EL, Hughes CA, Pyrek JD, Sparks SM, Cagatay EU, Bartkus JM | year = 1998 | title = Changes in bacterial flora associated with skin damage on hands of health care personnel | url = | journal = Am J Infect Control | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 513–21 | pmid = 9795681 | doi=10.1016/s0196-6553(98)70025-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hand washing can damage skin because the [[stratum corneum]] top layer of skin consists of 15 to 20 layers of [[keratin]] disks, [[corneocyte]]s, each of which is each surrounded by a thin film of skin [[lipid]]s which can be removed by [[alcohol]]s and [[detergent]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kownatzki E | year = 2003 | title = Hand hygiene and skin health | url = | journal = J Hosp Infect | volume = 55 | issue = 4| pages = 239–45 | pmid = 14629966 | doi=10.1016/j.jhin.2003.08.018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Damaged skin defined  by extensive cracking of skin surface, widespread reddening or occasional bleeding has also been found to be more frequently colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus hominis]]'' and these were more likely to be [[methicillin]] resistant.&lt;ref name="Larson" /&gt; Though not related to greater antibiotic resistance, damaged skin was also more like to be colonized by ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', [[gram-negative bacteria]], ''[[Enterococci]]'' and ''[[Candida (genus)|Candida]]''.&lt;ref name="Larson"/&gt;

==Comparison with other flora==
The skin flora is different from that of the gut which is  predominantly [[Firmicutes]] and [[Bacteroidetes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eckburg PB, Bik EM, Bernstein CN, Purdom E, Dethlefsen L, Sargent M, Gill SR, Nelson KE, Relman DA | year = 2005 | title = Diversity of the human intestinal microbial flora | url = http://www.pubmedcentral.nih.gov/picrender.fcgi?artid=1395357&amp;blobtype=pdf | journal = Science | volume = 308 | issue = 5728| pages = 1635–8 | doi = 10.1126/science.1110591 | pmid = 15831718 | pmc=1395357}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also low level of variation between people that is not found in gut studies.&lt;ref name="Grice08"/&gt; Both gut and skin flora however lack the diversity found in [[soil flora]].&lt;ref name="Grice"/&gt;

'''Social defeat''' refers to losing a confrontation among [[Conspecificity|conspecific]] animals, or any kind of hostile dispute among [[humans]], in either a [[Dyad (sociology)|dyadic]] or in a group-individual context, potentially generating very significant practical and [[psychological]] consequences in terms of control over resources, access to mates and social positions.

==Background==

Research on [[social stress]] has accumulated a useful body of knowledge, providing perspective on the effects of detrimental social and environmental interaction on the brain. Research and experimentation suffer from many methodological difficulties: usually a lack of ecological validity (similarity with natural conditions and stressors) or are not amenable to scientific investigation (difficult to test and verify).

Social psychology approaches to human [[aggression]] have developed a multitude of perspectives, based on observations of human phenomena like bullying, mobbing, physical and verbal abuse, relational and indirect aggression, etc. Despite the richness of theories developed, the body of knowledge generated has not satisfied scientific requirements of [[testability]] and [[falsifiability|verifiability]].

Animal studies of within-species aggression developed in 2 main branches: A) approaches based on laboratory experiments, on controlled conditions, allowing the measurement of behavioral, [[endocrine]] and [[neurological]] variables, but with the shortcoming of applying unnatural stressors (such as foot-shocks and restraint stress) in unnatural conditions (laboratory cages rarely approximate native habitats); B) approaches based on observations of animals in naturalistic settings, which avoided artificial environments and unnatural stresses, but usually not allowing the measurement of physiological effects or the manipulation of relevant variables.

In real life situations, animals (including humans) have to cope with [[Stress (biological)|stresses]] generated within their own species, during their interactions with conspecifics, especially due to recurrent struggles over the control of limited resources, mates and [[Social hierarchy|social positions]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003).

Social defeat is a source of chronic [[Stress (medicine)|stress]] in animals and humans, capable of causing significant changes in behaviour, [[brain]] functioning, [[physiology]], [[neurotransmitter]] and [[hormone]] levels, and [[health]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003).

==History==
The social defeat approach was originated from animal experiments, using the "resident-intruder" [[paradigm]], in which an animal was placed in the cage of another animal or group of animals of the same species, in a manner that allowed a non-lethal conflict.

If animals are allowed to fight on a single occasion only, it is usually regarded as a model of acute stress; if they are allowed to fight on several different occasions, on different days, consecutive or not, it is regarded as a model of chronic stress. 
After the defeat or in the interval between fights, the subordinate animal may also be exposed to threats from the dominant one, by having to stay in a cage or compartment beside or nearby the dominant, exposed to its visual or olfactory cues.

Later, the social defeat approach was also applied to observations of animal within-species aggression, in the wild, which suggested that the hypotheses generated on artificial laboratory settings can also be applied in observed in natural settings, confirming the predictions of the model.

==In humans==
It has been proposed that animal models of social conflict may be useful for studying a number of [[mental disorders]], including [[major depression]], [[generalized anxiety disorder]], [[post-traumatic stress disorder]], [[drug abuse]], aggressive psychopathologies, [[eating disorders]] and [[schizophrenia]] (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Selten &amp; Cantor-Graae, 2005; Rohde, 2001).

The social defeat model has been extended to include observations of human [[aggression]], [[bullying]], [[relational aggression]], chronic subordination and [[humiliation]].  The social defeat model attempts to extend animal studies to include human behaviour as well, in contrast to the [[social psychology (psychology)|social psychology]] study of aggression, in which comparisons are drawn exclusively from experiments involving humans (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rohde, 2001).

Bullying has interesting parallels with animal models of social defeat, the bully being equivalent to the dominant animal and the victim the subordinate one. At stake are possessions of material objects, money, etc., social position in the group, represented by in-group prestige, and the consequent lack of access to mates, including for socio-sexual behaviors like copulation. Human victims typically experience symptoms like low self-esteem (due to low regard by the group), feelings of depression (due to unworthiness of efforts), social withdrawal (reduced investments in the social environment), anxiety (due to a threatening environment), and they can also be shown to experience a plethora of physiological effects, e.g. increased corticosterone levels, and also a shift towards sympathetic balance in the autonomic nervous system (Bjorkqvist, 2001).

Research about human aggression, usually conducted by psychologists or social psychologists, resembles to a great extent the research about social defeat and animal aggression, usually conducted by biologists or physiological psychologists. However, there is the problem of the use of different terminologies for similar concepts, which hinders communication between the two bodies of knowledge (Bjorkqvist, 2001).

Similarly, research on depression has employed similar constructs, such as [[learned helplessness]], although that theory is focused on the perceived inability to escape any sort of negative stimuli rather than on social factors.

===Behavioral and physiological effects===
Social defeat is a very potent [[Stress (medicine)|stressor]] and can lead to a variety of behavioral effects, like social withdrawal (reduced interactions with conspecifics), lethargy (reduced locomotor activity), reduced exploratory behavior (of both open field and novel objects), anhedonia (reduced reward-related behaviors), decreased socio-sexual behaviors (including decreased attempts to mate and copulate after defeat), various motivational deficits, decreased levels of testosterone (due to a decline in the functionality of the Leydig cells of the testes), increased tendencies to stereotyped behaviours and [[Self medication|self-administration of drugs and alcohol]] (Rygula et alli, 2005; Huhman, 2006).

Research also implicates that the referred behavioral effects are moderated by neuroendocrine phenomena involving [[serotonin]], [[dopamine]], [[epinephrine]], [[norepinephrine]], and in the [[hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis]], [[locus ceruleus]] and [[limbic system]]s (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; Selten &amp; Cantor-Graae, 2005; Marinia et alli, 2006; Huhman, 2006).

Both animal and human studies suggest that the social environment has a strong influence on the consequences of stresses. This finding seems to be especially true in the case of social stresses, like social defeat (Bjorkqvist, 2001; Rygula et alli, 2005; de Jong et alli, 2005).

In animal studies, animals housed collectively showed reduced symptoms after defeat, in comparison with those housed alone; and animals that live in more stable groups (with stable hierarchies, less intra-group aggression) exhibit reduced effects after a defeat, in comparison with those housed in a more unstable group (de Jong et alli, 2005). In separate studies, defeat behaviors can be modulated by acetylcholine (Smith et al., 2015).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Smith|first1=RS|last2=Hu|first2=R|last3=DeSouza|first3=A|last4=Eberly|first4=CL|last5=Krahe|first5=K|last6=Chan|first6=W|last7=Araneda|first7=RC|title=Differential Muscarinic Modulation in the Olfactory Bulb.|journal=The Journal of Neuroscience|date=29 July 2015|volume=35|issue=30|pages=10773–85|doi=10.1523/JNEUROSCI.0099-15.2015|pmid=26224860|url=http://www.jneurosci.org/content/35/30/10773.long|accessdate=6 August 2015|pmc=4518052}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In human studies, individuals with greater [[Social support|support]] seem to be protected against excessive neuroendocrine activation, thereby reducing the adverse effects of stresses in general, and especially stresses of social origin. 
  
This apparent confusion, in which social defeat generates behavioral and neuroendocrine effects, both of which depending on social contextual variables, raises the question of how to interpret this data. A useful concept is the concept of “causal chain”, in which recurrent evolutionary events, in this case intra-specific competition, generates [[Evolutionary pressure|selective pressures]] that last for thousands of generations, influencing a whole species. This way physiological phenomena may evolve, in this case the referred neuro-endocrine phenomena, to facilitate adaptive patterns of action by individuals, in this case the referred behavioral effects. According to this framework, selective pressures generated by intra-specific competition can be considered as the ultimate cause, the neuroendocrine phenomena can be considered to be the proximate causes (sometimes also called mechanisms or moderators) and the observed behavioral alterations are considered the effects (the end events in the causal chain)(Gilbert et alli, 2002; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003; Rygula et alli, 2005).

Some authors, for example [[Randolph Nesse]], warn us that patterns of behavior commonly considered inappropriate or even pathological may well have adaptive value. According to this view, several authors propose that behaviors considered abnormal may be in fact part of an adaptive response to stressors in modern or at least in old environments, for example social stressors from chronic subordination or interpersonal conflicts (Gilbert et alli, 2002; Allen &amp; Badcock, 2003). [[Evolutionary psychology]] provides several possible explanations for why humans typically respond to social dynamics in the way that they do, including possible functions of [[self-esteem]] in relation to [[dominance hierarchy|dominance hierarchies]].

{{Disability}}

The '''social model of disability''' is a reaction to the dominant [[medical model of disability]] which in itself is a functional analysis of the body as machine to be fixed in order to conform with normative values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Paley|first=John|title=The Cartesian melodrama in nursing|journal=Nursing Philosophy|date=1 October 2002|volume=3|issue=3|pages=189–192|doi=10.1046/j.1466-769X.2002.00113.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The social model of disability identifies systemic barriers, negative attitudes and exclusion by society (purposely or inadvertently) that mean society is the main contributory factor in disabling people. While [[Physiology|physical]], sensory, intellectual, or [[psychological]] variations may cause individual functional limitation or impairments, these do not have to lead to [[disability]] unless society fails to take account of and include people regardless of their individual differences. The origins of the approach can be traced to the 1960s; the specific term emerged from the [[United Kingdom]] in the 1980s.

==History==
In 1975, the UK organization [[Union of the Physically Impaired Against Segregation]] (UPIAS) claimed: "In our view it is society which disables physically impaired people. Disability is something imposed on top of our impairments by the way we are unnecessarily isolated and excluded from full participation in society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/UPIAS/fundamental%20principles.pdf |title=THE UNION OF THE PHYSICALLY IMPAIRED AGAINST SEGREGATION and THE DISABILITY ALLIANCE discuss Fundamental Principles of Disability |publisher=[[UPIAS]] |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/finkelstein/UPIAS%20Principles%202.pdf |title=Fundamental Principles of Disability - Comments on the discussion held between the Union and the Disability Alliance on 22nd November, 1975 |publisher=[[UPIAS]] |date= |accessdate=2010-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1983, the disabled academic [[Mike Oliver (disability advocate)|Mike Oliver]] coined the phrase "social model of disability" in reference to these ideological developments.&lt;ref name="OliverSapey2006"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Michael Oliver|author2=Bob Sapey|title=Social work with disabled people|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qqiUQgAACAAJ|accessdate=23 October 2010|date=27 April 2006|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4039-1838-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oliver focused on the idea of an individual model (of which the medical was a part) versus a social model, derived from the distinction originally made between impairment and disability by the UPIAS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/Oliver/in%20soc%20dis.pdf |author=MIKE OLIVER |title=THE INDIVIDUAL AND SOCIAL MODELS OF DISABILITY |publisher=leeds.ac.uk |date=23 July 1990 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "social model" was extended and developed by academics and activists in Australia, the UK, US and other countries, and extended to include all disabled people, including those who have [[learning disabilities|learning difficulties]] / [[learning disabilities]] / or who are [[intellectually disabled]], or people with emotional, mental health or behavioural problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.bfi.org.uk/education/teaching/disability/thinking/medical.html |title=Disabling Imagery? &amp;#124; Ways of thinking about disability: 'Medical Model' vs 'Social Model' &amp;#124; Learning resources&amp;#124; BFI |website=Old.bfi.org.uk |date=2010-03-22 |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Goodley|first=Dan|title='Learning Difficulties', the Social Model of Disability and Impairment: Challenging epistemologies|journal=Disability &amp; Society|date=1 March 2001|volume=16|issue=2|pages=207–231|doi=10.1080/09687590120035816}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Oliver did not intend the "social model of disability" to be an all encompassing theory of disability, rather a starting point in reframing how society views disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The social model of disability: thirty years on|url = http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/09687599.2013.818773|journal = Disability &amp; Society|pages = 1024–1026|volume = 28|issue = 7|doi = 10.1080/09687599.2013.818773|first = Mike|last = Oliver}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components and usage==

A fundamental aspect of the social model concerns equality. The struggle for equality is often compared to the struggles of other socially marginalized groups.  Equal rights are said to give empowerment and the "ability" to make decisions and the opportunity to live life to the fullest. A related phrase often used by disability rights campaigners, as with other [[social activism]], is "[[Nothing About Us Without Us]]."&lt;ref name="Charlton2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=James I. Charlton|title=Nothing about us without us: disability oppression and empowerment|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ohqff8DBt9gC|accessdate=23 October 2010|year=2000|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-22481-0|page=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability focuses on changes required in society. These might be in terms of:

*Attitudes, for example a more positive attitude toward certain mental traits or behaviors, or not underestimating the potential quality of life of those with impairments,
*Social support, for example help dealing with barriers; resources, aids or [[positive discrimination]] to overcome them, for example providing a buddy to explain work culture for an autistic employee,
*Information, for example using suitable formats (e.g. [[braille]]) or levels (e.g. simplicity of language) or coverage (e.g. explaining issues others may take for granted),
*Physical structures, for example buildings with sloped access and elevators, or
*Flexible work hours for people with [[circadian rhythm sleep disorders]] or, for example, for people who experience [[anxiety]]/[[panic attacks]] in rush hour traffic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/your-rights/disability/disability-in-employment/examples-of-reasonable-adjustments-in-the-workplace/ |title=EHRC - Examples of reasonable adjustments in the workplace |publisher=Equalityhumanrights.com |date=2010-10-01 |accessdate=2012-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121023033858/http://www.equalityhumanrights.com/advice-and-guidance/your-rights/disability/disability-in-employment/examples-of-reasonable-adjustments-in-the-workplace/ |archivedate=23 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability implies that attempts to change, "fix" or "cure" individuals, especially when used against the wishes of the patient, can be discriminatory and prejudiced. This attitude, which may be seen as stemming from a medical model and a subjective value system, can harm the self-esteem and social inclusion of those constantly subjected to it (e.g. being told they are not as good or valuable, in an overall and core sense, as others). Some communities have actively resisted "treatments", while, for example, defending a unique culture or set of abilities. In the deaf community, sign language is valued even if most people do not know it and some parents argue against cochlear implants for deaf infants who cannot consent to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=NASEO |url=http://www.beyonddiscovery.org/content/view.asp?I=261 |title=Sound from Silence - Sidebar - Cochlear Implan |work=Beyonddiscovery.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  People diagnosed as being on the [[autism spectrum]] may argue against efforts to change them to be more like others. They argue instead for acceptance of [[neurodiversity]] and accommodation to different needs and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Seidel |first=Kathleen |url=http://www.neurodiversity.com/autistic_distinction.html |title=the autistic distinction |work=neurodiversity.com |date=2004-08-20 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some people diagnosed with a [[mental disorder]] argue that they are just different and don't necessarily conform.  The [[biopsychosocial model]] of disease/disability is a holistic attempt by practitioners to address this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Engel|first=G.|title=The need for a new medical model: a challenge for biomedicine|journal=Science|date=8 April 1977|volume=196|issue=4286|pages=129–136|doi=10.1126/science.847460|pmid=847460|bibcode=1977Sci...196..129E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model implies that practices such as [[eugenics]] are founded on social values and a prejudiced understanding of the potential and value of those labeled disabled. "Over 200,000 disabled people were the first victims of the [[Holocaust]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/holocaust/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_other_victims/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_disabled___the_holocaust.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417064037/http://www.eastrenfrewshire.gov.uk/holocaust/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_other_victims/holocaust_remembrance_2004_-_disabled___the_holocaust.htm |date=17 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1986 article stated:  "It is important that we do not allow ourselves to be dismissed as if we all come under this one great metaphysical category 'the disabled'. The effect of this is a depersonalization, a sweeping dismissal of our individuality, and a denial of our right to be seen as people with our own uniqueness, rather than as the anonymous constituents of a category or group. These words that lump us all together -'the disabled', 'spina bifida', 'tetraplegic', 'muscular dystrophy’, - are nothing more than terminological rubbish bins into which all the important things about us as people get thrown away."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brisenden|first=Simon|title=Independent Living and the Medical Model of Disability|journal=Disability, Handicap &amp; Society|date=1 January 1986|volume=1|issue=2|pages=173–178|doi=10.1080/02674648666780171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability is based on a distinction between the terms "impairment" and "disability." Impairment is used to refer to the actual attributes (or lack of attributes), the abnormality, of a person, whether in terms of limbs, organs or mechanisms, including psychological. Disability is used to refer to the restrictions caused by society when it does not give equivalent attention and accommodation to the needs of individuals with impairments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leeds.ac.uk/disability-studies/archiveuk/thomas%20pam/Defining%20Impairment%20within%20the%20Social%20Model%20of%20Disability.pdf |title=Defining Impairment within the Social Model of Disability |author1=Pam Thomas |author2=Lorraine Gradwell |author3=Natalie Markham |work=leeds.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model also relates to economics. It proposes that people can be disabled by a lack of resources to meet their needs. It addresses issues such as the under-estimation of the potential of people to contribute to society and add economic value to society, if given equal rights and equally suitable facilities and opportunities as others. Economic research on companies that attempt to accommodate disability in their workforce suggest they [[Return on Disability Index|outperform competitors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/node/21562229 |date=8 September 2012|title=Disability and business: The new green |publisher=The Economist |access-date=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Autumn 2001, the UK Office for National Statistics identified that approximately one fifth of the working age population was disabled - 7.1 million disabled people as opposed to 29.8 million able people - and in this analysis also provided insight into some of the reasons why disabled people were unwilling to enter the labour market, such as that the reduction in disability benefits in entering the labour market would not make it worthwhile to enter into employment. A three-pronged approach was suggested: 
"incentives to work via the tax and benefit system, for example through the Disabled Person’s Tax Credit; helping people back into work, for example via the New Deal for Disabled People; and tackling discrimination in the workplace via anti-discrimination policy. Underpinning this are the Disability Discrimination Act (DDA) 1995 and the Disability Rights Commission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/labour_market_trends/People_with_disabilities_aug2002.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110074257/http://www.statistics.gov.uk/articles/labour_market_trends/People_with_disabilities_aug2002.pdf |date=10 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law and public policy==
In the [[United Kingdom]], the [[Disability Discrimination Act 1995|Disability Discrimination Act]] defines disability using the medical model - disabled people are defined as people with certain conditions, or certain limitations on their ability to carry out "normal day-to-day activities."  But the requirement of employers and service providers to make "reasonable adjustments" to their policies or practices, or physical aspects of their premises, follows the social model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/en/DisabledPeople/RightsAndObligations/DisabilityRights/DG_4001068 |title=Definition of disability under the Equality Act 2010 - GOV.UK |publisher=Direct.gov.uk |date=2012-10-22 |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By making adjustments, employers and service providers are removing the barriers that disable - according to the social model, they are effectively removing the person's disability. In 2006, amendments to the act called for local authorities and others to actively promote disability equality. This enforcement came in the shape of the Disability Equality Duty in December 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dotheduty.org/ |title=コアサーバーdotheduty.org |website=Dotheduty.org |date= |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, The Disability Discrimination Act (1995) was amalgamated into the [[Equality Act 2010]] along with other pertinent discrimination legislation. It extends the law on discrimination to indirect discrimination. For example, if a carer of a person with a disability is discriminated against, this is now also unlawful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.equalities.gov.uk/equality_act_2010.aspx |title=Home Office |publisher=Equalities |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since October 2010, when it came into effect, employers may not legally ask questions about illness or disability at interview for a job or for a referee to comment on such in a reference, except where there is a need to make reasonable adjustments for an interview to proceed. Following an offer of a job, an employer can lawfully ask such questions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thebottomlineonline.co.uk/pages/fullarticle.asp?id=222 |title=Previous Issues of The Bottom Line Online |publisher=Thebottomlineonline.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-11-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120320201637/http://www.thebottomlineonline.co.uk/pages/fullarticle.asp?id=222 |archivedate=20 March 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA), revision of 2008  effective in January 2009, is a wide-ranging [[civil rights]] law that prohibits discrimination based on disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ada.gov/pubs/adastatute08.pdf |format=PDF |title=AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT OF 1990, AS AMENDED |website=Ada.gov |accessdate=2016-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It affords similar protections against discrimination to Americans with disabilities as the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]], which made discrimination based on [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[religion]], [[sex]], national origin, and other characteristics illegal. Certain specific conditions are excluded, such as [[alcoholism]] and [[transsexualism]].

In 2007, the [[European Court of Justice]] in the [[Chacon Navas v Eurest Colectividades SA]] court case, defined disability narrowly according to a [[medical model of disability|medical definition]] that excluded temporary illness, when considering the [[Directive establishing a general framework for equal treatment in employment and occupation]] (Council Directive 2000/78/EC). The directive did not provide for any definition of disability, despite discourse in policy documents previously in the EU about endorsing the social model of disability.  This allowed the Court of Justice to take a narrow medical definition.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3119">'''Spring line settlements''' occur where a ridge of [[wiktionary:permeable|permeable]] rock lies over impermeable rock and there will be a line of [[spring (hydrosphere)|springs]] along the boundary between the two layers.

It sometimes happens that a sequence of spring line (or springline) settlements will arise around these springs, becoming villages.

In each case to build higher up the hill would have meant difficulties with water supply; to build lower would have taken the settlement further away from useful grazing land or nearer to the [[floodplain]].

Spring line villages are often the principal settlements in [[strip parish]]es, with long, narrow [[parish]] boundaries stretching up to the top of the ridge and down to the river but being narrow in the direction of adjacent spring line villages.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Some examples in England==
* to the north and south of the [[Howardian Hills]] in the [[North Riding of Yorkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 40&lt;/ref&gt;
* to the west and east of the ridge that stretches south from [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] and on top of which is the [[Roman road]] [[Ermine Street]]. The western line (which includes [[Boothby Graffoe]] and [[Navenby]]) is close under the escarpment; the eastern line (which includes [[Metheringham]]) is up to {{convert|6|mi|0}} away from the crest of the ridge.&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 21B&lt;/ref&gt;
* to the south of [[London]] and difficult to identify among the continuous housing development of later centuries, there are: [[Ewell]] (a derivative of the [[Old English]] ''Et Welle''), [[Cheam]], [[Sutton, London|Sutton]], [[Carshalton]], [[Wallington, London|Wallington]], [[Beddington]], [[Waddon]], [[Croydon]], [[Addiscombe]], [[Elmers End]], and [[Beckenham]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 33&lt;/ref&gt; Road and place names to the north of the line provide evidence that that area was relatively uninhabited: Cheam [[common land|Common]], [[Sutton Common]], [[Thornton Heath]], and [[South Norwood|Norwood]] (a derivative of ''North Wood'').
* Below the northern [[escarpment]] of the [[South Downs]] are villages such as [[Edburton]], [[Fulking]] and [[Poynings]].&lt;ref&gt;Humphery-Smith (2003) Map 34&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the [[Vale of the White Horse]] (now in [[Oxfordshire]], formerly in [[Berkshire]]), villages such as [[East Ginge]], West Ginge, [[Letcombe Bassett]], [[Childrey]] and [[Woolstone, Oxfordshire|Woolstone]] are at the head of wooded valleys below [[the Ridgeway]] on the north-facing scarp slope.
* In [[East Anglia]], spring line settlements such as [[Burwell, Cambridgeshire]], [[Swaffham Prior]], [[Cherry Hinton]] mark the fen edge and are close to the probable Lower [[Icknield Way]].

[[Image:Umbi.jpg|right|thumb|270px|Usa Marine Biological Institute  pier]]
The '''Usa Marine Biological Institute (UMBI)''' (sometimes referred to as '''MBI-Japan''', '''Japanese Marine Biological Institute''',  '''Usa Kaiyo Center''' or just '''Usa''') is one of the oldest and largest centers for [[phycology]], [[marine biology]] [[research]], graduate training, and public service in Japan. It is devoted to scientific research  leading to MS and PhD degrees in phycology, marine biology and related fields. It grants degrees jointly with [[Kochi University]].

UMBI is located in the village of [[Usa cho]], [[Kōchi Prefecture]], Japan.

==History==
The Usa Marine Biological Station was founded in 1953 as an independent research institute by the [[Japanese Government]]. In 1978, its name was changed to Usa Marine Biological Institute. 
[[Image:Usa1963.jpg|left|thumb|300px|Usa Marine Biological Institute researchers, 1963]]
Under the directorship of Professor Masao Ohno, the institute established a [[Japan International Cooperation Agency]] (JICA) training program in marine biology, since when a large number of foreign researchers have come to the institute to pursue short term research projects. The current director, Professor Izumi Kinoshita, supervises and coordinates the JICA training program.

In 2004, UMBI started a new graduate program, Kuroshio Sciences, jointly with Kochi University, to study the [[Kuroshio|Kuroshio Current]] from an interdisciplinary perspective.

UMBI graduate students are supported by various financial aid schemes, especially the [[Monbukagakusho]] [[MEXT International PhD Program]].

Usa Marine Biological Institute is renowned for marine phycological research. Emeritus Professor Masao Ohno was the first person in Japan to use an artificial seeding method for the commercial cultivation of [[green algae]]. The institute is one of the pioneer research institutes in the world for the study of [[Ulvophycean]] algae and has state-of-art facilities for marine phycological research.

Contemporary marine phycology research in the UMBI focuses on culture studies to establish life-histories of Ulvophycean algae ([[Ulva]] and [[Monostroma]]), tank cultivation of [[Ulva]] using deep seawater (conducted jointly with the [[Deep Seawater Research Center]], [[Muroto, Kōchi|Muroto]], Japan) and the ecology of [[Ecklonia]] and [[Sargasm]] species in the [[Pacific Ocean]].

'''Voluntary Protection Programs''' (VPP) is an [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA)]] initiative that encourages private industry and federal agencies to prevent workplace injuries and illnesses through hazard prevention and control, worksite analysis, training; and cooperation between management and workers. VPP &lt;ref&gt;About VPP, Source: U.S. Department of Labor, https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/vpp/all_about_vpp.html&lt;/ref&gt; enlists worker involvement to achieve injury and illness rates that are below national Bureau of Labor Statistics averages for their respective industries.

== History ==
Even though the original [[OSH Act]] of 1970 included language that discussed the concept of VPP, it didn't start until an experimental California program began in 1979.  The OSHA program started in 1982 with the first approved facilities.&lt;ref&gt;http://ehstoday.com/safety/best-practices/ehs_imp_37775&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.forensicmag.com/article/2013/06/vpp-osha%E2%80%99s-voluntary-protection-program-part-2&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels/Types of Certification==
VPP offers two levels of certification:

===Star===
Star is the highest level. It recognizes employers and employees for developing and implementing continuous improvement workplace safety and health management programs that result in injury/illness rates that are below the national averages for their industries.

===Merit===
Merit is for employers and employees that have implemented good safety and health programs but require additional improvements. They must also commit to seeking to advance to Star level within three years.

VPP offers three types of certification:

===Site-based===
Site-based Star and Merit certifications are offered for permanent work sites and long-term construction sites. It may also be used to certify resident contractors at participating VPP sites or under a corporate program.

===Mobile Workforce===
This type of certification is for companies whose employees work on location at various sites.

===Corporate===
Large organizations that implement organization-wide health and safety management programs that extend to it individual sites are able to seek corporate VPP certification.

As of 10/31/2012 2,370 entities were registered as VPP certified &lt;ref&gt;Industries in the VPP Federal and State Plans As of 10/31/2012, https://www.osha.gov/dcsp/vpp/sitebynaics.html&lt;/ref&gt; with the vast majority achieving the Star level. All organizations are re-evaluated every three to five years to remain in the programs.
