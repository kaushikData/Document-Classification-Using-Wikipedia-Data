The '''Adults with Incapacity (Scotland) Act 2000''' (2000 asp 4) is an [[Act of the Scottish Parliament]]. It was passed on 29 March 2000, receiving [[royal assent]] on 9 May.&lt;ref name="statutelaw introduction" /&gt; It concerns the welfare of adults (the [[age of legal capacity]] in Scotland being 16) who are unable to make decisions for themselves because they have a [[mental disorder]] or are not able to communicate. It provides the framework for other people (such as carers) to act on the behalf of people with [[capacity (law)|incapacity]].

The Act was one of the first pieces of legislation passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]] upon it being reconvened in 1999.

==Content==
Part 2 of the act concerns [[power of attorney]] and provides the framework for an individual (whilst they have capacity) to appoint someone to act as their continuing (financial) or welfare attorney.&lt;ref name="statutelaw part 2" /&gt;

Part 3 of the act concerns the accounts and funds of the adult with incapacity. It enables access to the bank or building society account of the adult with incapacity, in order to pay their costs of living.&lt;ref name="statutelaw part 3" /&gt;

Part 4 of the act concerns the management of finances of adults with incapacity who are residents of registered establishments including health service or private hospitals, psychiatric hospitals, state hospitals and care home services.&lt;ref name="statutelaw part 4" /&gt;

Part 5 of the act concerns medical research and treatment of adults with incapacity.&lt;ref name="statutelaw part 5" /&gt; It allows, under certain circumstances, medical research to be carried out on adults unable to give consent.&lt;ref name=GovShortGuide4 /&gt;

Part 6 of the act concerns intervention orders and guardianship orders. An intervention order can be applied for by, or on behalf of, an adult with incapacity and granted by the [[sheriff court]]. It may cover welfare or financial matters. An application for a guardianship order may be made by individuals or by a local authority regarding an adult with incapacity who may have long-term needs.&lt;ref name="statutelaw part 6" /&gt;&lt;ref name=GovShortGuide2-3 /&gt;

Part 7 of the act ("Miscellaneous") makes it an offence for an individual to wilfully [[neglect]] and adult with incapacity.&lt;ref name="statutelaw part 7" /&gt;

The '''American Nurses Association Hall of Fame'''  or the '''ANA Hall of Fame''' is an award which recognizes the historical contributions to [[nursing in the United States]].

==History==
In 1974, in preparation for the [[United States Bicentennial]], the [[American Nurses Association]] (ANA) created a seven-member committee to recognize the dedication and achievements of professional nurses in a Hall of Fame. Fifteen inaugural women were selected as inductees and the committee recommended that the nomination process and inductions become a permanent vehicle for recognition.&lt;ref name="ANA Hall of Fame"&gt;{{cite web|title=ANA Hall of Fame|url=http://www.nursingworld.org/FunctionalMenuCategories/AboutANA/Honoring-Nurses/NationalAwardsProgram/HallofFame/default.aspx|publisher=Nursing World|accessdate=7 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150928143758/http://www.nursingworld.org/FunctionalMenuCategories/AboutANA/Honoring-Nurses/NationalAwardsProgram/HallofFame/default.aspx|archivedate=September 28, 2015|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, National Nurse's Day was proclaimed by President [[Ronald Reagan]] to be celebrated on May 6&lt;ref name="Turchi (2015)"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Turchi|first1=Megan|title=How a long struggle for recognition led to National Nurses Day|url=https://www.boston.com/jobs/jobs-news/2015/05/01/why-recognition-matters-to-nurses|accessdate=7 July 2016|publisher=''[[Boston.com]]''|date=May 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160502125202/http://www.boston.com/jobs/jobs-news/2015/05/01/why-recognition-matters-to-nurses|archivedate=May 2, 2016|location=Boston, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in conjunction with the celebration, the ANA at their annual convention, inducted six more nurses.&lt;ref name="Convention1983"&gt;{{cite book|title=Summary of proceedings|year=1983|publisher=American Nurses' Association|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ANA board approved periodic addition of members thereafter, inducting new members in 1984, 1986, and 1996. In 1996, the criteria changed so that inductees did not have to be deceased and that inductions occur biennially.&lt;ref name="ANA Hall of Fame" /&gt;

==Criteria==
The criteria for induction include that the nominees must be leaders in health, social or political policy which have had a sustaining impact on nursing in the United States. All candidates, unless they were working prior to 1873, must have completed a formal registered nursing program. Contributions to the field could have occurred locally or internationally, but must demonstrate their enduring value beyond the honoree's lifetime. Since 1996, inductees may be living or deceased.&lt;ref name="details"&gt;{{cite web|title=ANA Hall of Fame-Details|url=https://ebiz.nursingworld.org/PersonifyEbusiness/Default.aspx?TabID=1457&amp;awardId=78746265|publisher=American Nurses Association|accessdate=7 July 2016|location=Silver Spring, Maryland|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Estimation statistics#Gardner-Altman plot}}

A '''Bland–Altman plot''' (Difference plot) in [[analytical chemistry]] or biomedicine is a method of [[data plot]]ting used in analyzing the agreement between two different [[assay]]s. It is identical to a '''[[John Tukey|Tukey]] mean-difference plot'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29456028|title=Visualizing data|last=Cleveland|first=William S.,|date=1993|publisher=At &amp; T Bell Laboratories|year=|isbn=0963488406|location=Murray Hill, N.J.|pages=22-23|oclc=29456028}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the name by which it is known in other fields, but was popularised in [[medical statistics]] by [[J. Martin Bland]] and [[Doug Altman|Douglas G. Altman]].&lt;ref name="Altman1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Altman DG, Bland JM |title=Measurement in medicine: the analysis of method comparison studies |journal=The Statistician |volume=32 |year=1983 |pages=307–317 |doi=10.2307/2987937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bland1986"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bland JM, Altman DG |title=Statistical methods for assessing agreement between two methods of clinical measurement |journal=Lancet |volume=327 | year=1986 |issue=8476 |pages=307–10 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(86)90837-8 |pmid=2868172| url=https://www-users.york.ac.uk/~mb55/meas/ba.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agreement vs correlation==
Bland and Altman make the point that any two methods that are designed to measure the same parameter (or property) should have good [[correlation]] when a set of samples are chosen such that the property to be determined varies considerably. A high correlation for any two methods designed to measure the same property could thus in itself just be a sign that one has chosen a widespread sample. A high correlation does not necessarily imply that there is good agreement between the two methods.

==How to construct a Bland–Altman plot==
Consider a set of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; samples (for example, objects of unknown volume).  Both assays (for example, different methods of volume measurement) are performed on each sample, resulting in &lt;math&gt;2n&lt;/math&gt; data points.  Each of the &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; samples is then represented on the graph by assigning the [[mean]] of the two measurements as the &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-value, and the difference between the two values as the &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;-value.

The [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian coordinates]] of a given sample &lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt; with values of &lt;math&gt;S_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S_2&lt;/math&gt; determined by the two assays is

:&lt;math&gt; S(x,y)=\left( \frac{S_1+S_2}{2}, S_1-S_2 \right). &lt;/math&gt;

For comparing the dissimilarities between the two sets of samples independently from their mean values, it is more appropriate to look at the ratio of the pairs of measurements.&lt;ref name="Bland1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Bland JM, Altman DG |title=Measuring agreement in method comparison studies |journal=[[Statistical Methods in Medical Research]] |volume=8 | year=1999|issue=2 |pages=135–60 |doi= 10.1191/096228099673819272|pmid=10501650| url =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Log transformation (base 2) of the measurements before the analysis will enable the standard approach to be used; so the plot will be given by the following equation:

:&lt;math&gt; S(x,y)=\left( \frac{\log_2{S_1}+\log_2{S_2}}{2}, \log_2{S_1}-\log_2{S_2} \right). &lt;/math&gt;

This version of the plot is used in [[MA plot]].

==Application==
One primary application of the Bland–Altman plot is to compare two clinical measurements that each produce some error in their measures.&lt;ref name="Hanneman2008"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hanneman SK |title=Design, analysis, and interpretation of method-comparison studies |journal=AACN Advanced Critical Care |volume=19 |year=2008 |pages=223–234 |pmid=18560291 |doi=10.1097/01.AACN.0000318125.41512.a3 |issue=2 |pmc=2944826}}&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used to compare a new measurement technique or method with a [[gold standard (test)|gold standard]], as even a gold standard does not - and should not - imply it to be without error.&lt;ref name="Bland1999" /&gt; See [[Analyse-it]], [[MedCalc]], [[NCSS (statistical software)|NCSS]], GraphPad Prism, [[R (programming language)|R]], or [[StatsDirect]] for software providing Bland–Altman plots.

Bland-Altman plots are extensively used to evaluate the agreement among two different instruments or two measurements techniques. Bland-Altman plots allow identification of any systematic difference between the measurements (i.e., fixed bias) or possible [[outlier|outliers]]. The mean difference is the estimated bias, and the [[Standard deviation|SD]] of the differences measures the random fluctuations around this mean. If the mean value of the difference differs significantly from 0 on the basis of a 1-sample [[Student's t-test|t-test]], this indicates the presence of fixed bias. If there is a consistent bias, it can be adjusted for by subtracting the mean difference from the new method. It is common to compute 95% [[limits of agreement]] for each comparison (average difference ± 1.96 standard deviation of the difference), which tells us how far apart measurements by 2 methods were more likely to be for most individuals. If the differences within mean ± 1.96 SD are not clinically important, the two methods may be used interchangeably.  The 95% limits of agreement can be unreliable estimates of the population parameters especially for small sample sizes so, when comparing methods or assessing repeatability, it is important to calculate confidence intervals for 95% limits of agreement. This can be done by Bland and Altman's approximate method &lt;ref name="Bland1986" /&gt; or by more precise methods.&lt;ref name="Carkeet2015"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Carkeet A|title=Exact parametric confidence intervals for Bland–Altman Limits of Agreement. |journal=Optometry and Vision Science |volume=92 | year=2015 |issue=3 |pages=pap |doi=10.1097/OPX.0000000000000513}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bland-Altman plots were also used to investigate any possible relationship of the discrepancies between the measurements and the true value (i.e., proportional bias). The existence of proportional bias indicates that the methods do not agree equally through the range of measurements (i.e., the limits of agreement will depend on the actual measurement). To evaluate this relationship formally, the difference between the methods should be regressed on the average of the 2 methods. When a relationship between the differences and the true value was identified (i.e., a significant slope of the regression line), regression-based 95% limits of agreement should be provided.
&lt;ref name="Bland1999" /&gt;

==Notes==

A similar method was proposed in 1981 by Eksborg.&lt;ref name=Eksborg1981&gt;Eksborg S (1981) Evaluation of method-comparison data. Clin Chem 27:1311-1312&lt;/ref&gt; This method was based on [[Deming regression]]—a method introduced by Adcock in 1878.

Bland and Altman's Lancet paper &lt;ref name="Bland1986" /&gt; was number 29 in a list of the top 100 most-cited papers of all time with over 23,000 citations.&lt;ref name="Van NoordenMaher2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Noorden|first1=Richard|last2=Maher|first2=Brendan|last3=Nuzzo|first3=Regina|title=The top 100 papers|journal=Nature|volume=514|issue=7524|year=2014|pages=550–553|issn=0028-0836|doi=10.1038/514550a|pmid=25355343}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Buda Health Center''' is a private health clinic in [[Budapest]].  Established in 2000, it offers outpatient health care in two locations in the XIIth District, on Nagy Jenő Street and Királyhágó Street, and in one location in the IIIrd District, at the Graphisoft Park. More than 100 physicians&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.morpho.hu/_frontend/pdf/20130702-a_budai_egeszsegkozpont_2013_ban_is_superbrands_dijat_nyert.pdf |title= Sajtóközlemény |author=  |publisher= Morpho Communications |date= 2013-07-02 |accessdate= 2013-10-21 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131021231337/http://www.morpho.hu/_frontend/pdf/20130702-a_budai_egeszsegkozpont_2013_ban_is_superbrands_dijat_nyert.pdf |archivedate= 2013-10-21 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; in 45 specialties see their private patients in the facility and more than 230 national and multinational companies have contracted with them for their employees’ health care.

The [[National Center for Spinal Disorders]] is its affiliate hospital.  The hospital also offers publicly financed outpatient care in the areas of musculoskeletal disorders (spine care, orthopedics, traumatology) and anesthesiology as well as inpatient spine care and spine surgery for national and international private patients and patients covered by Hungarian Health Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;[[National Center for Spinal Disorders|NCfSD on Wikipedia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the Buda Health Center earned 1.7 billion Hungarian Forints mainly from international patients&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.haszon.hu/archivum/678-magankorhaz_a_varos_szelen.html |title= Magánkórház a város szélén |author= |publisher= Haszon.hu |date= |accessdate=2013-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; while in 2011, the earnings reached 3 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://hvg.hu/itthon/20121029_szazadveg_kiterjedt_megbizasok_kormany |title= Századvég-sztori: milliárdos birodalmat épít Orbán háttérembere |author= M.

==History==
The Buda Health Center was established by Peter Paul Varga, MD in a villa in Budapest originally the residence of one of the directors of the Hungarian Optical Works.  The building consequently served for a time as a kindergarten, in the 90’s was occupied by the health clinic of the Postabank then in 2000 by the Buda Health Center.  The clinic first opened its doors as a private orthopedic clinic, gradually enlarging its portfolio, adding more and more specialties every year.  In 2002, screening examinations and the Occupational Health Program were added.

==Psychosocial Responsibility==
The Buda Health Center is committed to promoting the importance of a healthy life style by providing incentives through articles appearing in their blogs, in local publications and on their own website.  These articles cover diseases and their possible treatments and also emphasize the importance of daily physical education in the prevention of diseases. The Center takes an active part in the District’s health (Egészséges Hegyvidék) program offering free screening examinations and lectures.

==Quality Control==
The quality of the services provided are controlled and guaranteed by the Hungarian MSZ EN 9001: 2001 standards and the Hungarian Health Care Standards (MEES 1.0).

The '''Children's Food Trust''' (formerly the '''School Food Trust''', renamed in 2012) was a [[Charitable organization|charity]] in the United Kingdom that sought to promote healthy eating for children.

==History==
The Trust - originally named the School Food Trust - was created as a [[non-departmental public body]] in 2005 by the [[Department for Education and Skills (United Kingdom)|Department for Education and Skills]] (DfES), following [[celebrity chef]] [[Jamie Oliver]]'s critique of the [[nutrition]]al quality of [[school meal]]s in his TV documentary ''[[Jamie's School Dinners]]'' and the recommendations of the School Meals Review Panel. It had been found that standards of school food were low, with average ingredient spend per meal before 2005 at secondary schools at around 40p. [[Childhood obesity]] is a problem in the UK in specific demographic groups (see [[National Statistics Socio-economic Classification]]), with some medical professionals predicting that today's youngsters will have a lower life expectancy than their parents with problems with [[diabetes]] and [[heart disease]].

Suzi Leather was appointed as Chair of the Trust and Judy Hargadon, an NHS senior manager, was appointed as the Trust's first Chief Executive. Leather resigned in 2006 to become Chair of the Charity Commission and, in November of that year, [[Prue Leith]] was named as the Chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alexandra Smith |url=http://education.guardian.co.uk/schoolmeals/story/0,,1943553,00.html |title=Prue Leith to head healthy school meals campaign |publisher=Education Guardian |date=9 November 2006 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; She retired in January 2010. Hargadon retired in 2013 and was succeeded by Linda Cregan. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecaterer.com/articles/346886/judy-hargadon-to-step-down-from-childrens-food-trust-role&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2007, the Trust also became a registered charity.&lt;ref name=cc-1118995&gt;{{EW charity|1118995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2011, the Trust officially ceased to be an NDPB,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.education.gov.uk/inthenews/pressnotices/a0065273/dfe-to-close-arms-length-bodies-to-improve-accountability |title=Department for Education announcement: DfE to close arm's length bodies to improve accountability |publisher=Department for Education  |date=14 October 2010 |accessdate=2010-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; expanding its work both as a charity and by trading its services through a new community interest company, as the Children's Food Trust.

In July 2017 the charity's closure was announced due to running out of funding&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-40706184|title=Funds loss closes child food charity|date=2017-07-24|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the charity was officially closed on 30th September 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.childrensfoodtrust.org.uk/blog/childrens-food-trust-leaves-fitting-legacy-as-it-passes-on-the-baton/|title=Children’s Food Trust leaves fitting legacy as it passes on the baton - Childrens Food Trust|date=2017-09-28|work=Childrens Food Trust|access-date=2017-10-13|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The trust was initially funded by a [[Pound sterling|£]]15 million grant from the Department for Education and Skills, and has been awarded in partnership with organisations including [[The Prince's Trust]], Business in the Community, Magic Outcomes and the Improvement Foundation, £20 million additional funding from the [[Big Lottery Fund]] for a network of school children's cookery clubs called Let's Get Cooking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Druce |url=http://www.caterersearch.com/Articles/2007/02/23/311846/school-food-trust-looks-to-national-lottery-for-cookery-club.htm |title=School Food Trust looks to National Lottery for cookery club funding |publisher=Caterer Search |date=23 February 2007 |accessdate=2010-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6191">'''Cranial ultrasound''' is a technique for scanning the brain using high-frequency sound waves.  It is used almost exclusively in babies because their [[fontanelle]] (the soft spot on the skull) provides an "acoustic window".  
A different form of ultrasound-based brain scanning, [[transcranial Doppler]], can be used in any age group.  This uses [[Doppler ultrasound]] to assess blood flow through the major arteries in the brain, and can scan through bone. It is not usual for this technique to be referred to simply as "cranial ultrasound".  Additionally, cranial ultrasound can be used for intra-operative imaging in adults undergoing neurosurgery once the skull has been opened, for example to help identify the margins of a tumour.&lt;ref&gt;Cranial Ultrasound article on the WedMD website http://www.webmd.com/brain/cranial-ultrasound&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications==

Most neonatal units in the developed world routinely perform serial cranial ultrasound scans on babies who are born significantly [[premature birth|premature]].  A typical regimen might involve performing a scan on the first, third and seventh day of a premature baby's life, and then at regular intervals until the baby reaches term.&lt;ref&gt;NHS Forth Valley Cranial Ultrasound guideline http://www.nhsforthvalley.com/__documents/qi/ce_guideline_wcdneonatal/cranialuss.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Premature babies are especially vulnerable to certain conditions involving the brain.  These include [[intraventricular haemorrhage]] (IVH), which often occurs during the first few days,&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|007301|Intraventricular hemorrhage of the newborn}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[periventricular leukomalacia]] (PVL), which tends to occur later on.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|975728|Pediatric Periventricular Leukomalacia}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the main purposes of routine cranial ultrasound scanning in neonatal units is to identify these problems as they develop.  If severe intraventricular haemorrhage is noted then the baby will need to be scanned more frequently in case post-haemorrhagic [[hydrocephalus]] (swelling of the [[ventricular system|ventricles]] as the natural flow of the [[cerebrospinal fluid]] is blocked by blood-clots) develops.

Many other conditions can also be identified by cranial ultrasound.  These include:
* [[Subdural haemorrhage]] (although this is usually only visible on ultrasound if quite large)
* Abnormalities of brain development such as [[agenesis of the corpus callosum]]
* Unexpected cysts or areas of calcification, which could indicate a problem such as [[vertically transmitted infection|infection]] of the foetus during pregnancy.
* [[Brain tumours]]
Therefore unwell mature babies often undergo cranial ultrasound as well as premature babies.

==Technique==

A water-based gel is applied to the infant's head, over the [[anterior fontanelle]], to aid conduction of ultrasound waves.  Ideally scans are performed during sleep or when the infant is calm.  The operator then uses an [[medical ultrasound|ultrasound]] probe to examine the baby's brain, viewing the images on a computer screen and recording them as necessary.

A standard cranial ultrasound examination usually involves recording approximately 10 views of the brain from different angles, five in the [[coronal plane|coronal]] plane and five in the [[sagittal]] or parasaggital planes.&lt;ref&gt;Auckland District Health Board Neonatal Cranial Ultrasound training resource {{cite web |url=http://www.adhb.govt.nz/newborn/TeachingResources/Radiology/HUSS/NeonatalHUSSViews.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151207072255/http://www.adhb.govt.nz/newborn/TeachingResources/Radiology/HUSS/NeonatalHUSSViews.htm |archivedate=2015-12-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  This allows all parts of the ventricles and most of the rest of the brain to be visualised.

Who performs the scans varies between different health systems.  In many hospitals in the United Kingdom [[paediatricians]] or neonatologists usually perform cranial ultrasound; in other systems [[nurse practitioner|advanced nurse practitioners]], [[radiologists]] or [[sonographers]] may perform most scans.

While the [[anterior fontanelle]] is the most commonly used acoustic window for cranial ultrasounds, more advanced operators may gain additional views, especially of [[posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] structures, by using the [[mastoid fontanelle]], the [[posterior fontanelle]] and/or the [[temporal bone|temporal]] window.&lt;ref&gt;Lissauer T, Fanaroff AA, Miall L, Fanaroff J, "Neonatology at a Glance", p187, John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Other refinements of cranial ultrasound technique include serial measurement of the width of the lateral ventricles ("ventricular index") to monitor suspected [[ventriculomegaly|ventricular dilatation]] and colour [[Doppler ultrasound|Doppler]] to assess blood flow.

==Limitations==

Cranial ultrasound is a very safe technique as it is non-invasive and does not involve any kind of [[ionising radiation]].  However, it is subject to certain limitations.
* Operator dependency: the quality of images obtained relies on the skill of the person performing sonography.
* Some brain structures are poorly visualised, notably [[posterior cranial fossa|posterior fossa]] structures such as the [[cerebellum]] if only the anterior fontanelle is used.&lt;ref&gt;van Wezel-Meijler, G, "Neonatal Cranial Ultrasonography" pp85-90, Springer Berlin Heidelberg, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
* If the [[fontanelle]] is very small, for example is post-mature infants, scanning may be technically difficult.
* Damage to the brain soft tissue ([[parenchyma]]), for example resulting from [[ischaemia]] or abnormal [[myelination]], may be hard to see.&lt;ref&gt;van Wezel-Meijler G, Seggerda SJ, Leijser LM, "Cranial ultrasonography in neonates: role and limitations, Seminars in Perinatology, 34(1):28-38, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
Therefore many neonatal services prefer to perform an [[MRI]] scan when the infant is near term, as well as routine cranial ultrasound, to avoid missing more subtle abnormalities.

In [[epidemiology]], data or facts about a [[population]] is called '''denominator data'''. Denominator data are independent of any specific [[disease]] or condition.  This name is given because in [[Mathematical modelling of infectious disease|mathematical models of disease]], disease-specific data such as the [[Incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]] of disease in a population, the [[Susceptible individual|susceptibility]] of the population to a specific condition, the disease resistance, etc. disease-specific variables are expressed as their proportion of some attribute of the general population, and hence appear as the [[numerator]] of the fraction or percentage being calculated, general data about the population typically appearing in the [[denominator]]; hence the term '''denominator data'''.

In an [[Compartmental models in epidemiology|epidemiological compartment model]], for example, variables are often scaled to total population. The susceptible fraction of a population is obtained by taking the [[ratio]] of the number of people susceptible to the total population. Susceptibility to a disease may depend on other factors such as age or sex. Data about a population including age distribution, male/female ratios, and other demographic factors may be relevant as denominator data. Denominator data is not only limited to data describing human populations but also includes information about [[wild animal|wild]] and [[domestic animal|domestic]] [[animal]] populations.

{{Disability}}
'''Direct Support Professionals''' ('''DSPs''') are people who work directly with people with [[Physical disability|physical disabilities]] and/or [[intellectual disabilities]] with the aim of assisting the individual to become integrated into his/her community or the [[least restrictive environment]]. 

A direct support professional is a person who assists an individual with a disability to lead a self-directed life and contribute to the community, assists with [[activities of daily living]] if needed,  and encourages attitudes and behaviors that enhance community inclusion. A DSP may provide supports to a person with a disability at home, work, school, church, and other community places. A DSP also acts as an advocate for the disabled individual, in communicating their needs, self-expression and goals.

==Willowbrook State School==

Direct Support Professional training and community placement/living became more prevalent following the [[Willowbrook State School]] scandal where it was uncovered following an investigation by then WABC journalist [[Geraldo Rivera]], that residents were being physically mistreated and kept in poor living conditions. Telly Award winning film ''Everyday Heroes'', produced by [[Pleasantville, New York]] media production company [[Creators Media Group]], highlights the work of Direct Support Professionals.

==Lack of national standard of care==
As of May 2006 Michigan and 5 other states were gearing up to implement fingerprinting background&lt;ref name=detnews&gt;[http://www.detnews.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20060501/LIFESTYLE03/605010336/1040/rss34 Long-term care aims to be safer]{{Dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; checks for Direct Support Professionals that provide care in long term care facilities.  Some states, such as California, require criminal background checks, while other states do not.&lt;ref name=detnews/&gt;

==California direct support professional training ==

The requirement for the community care facility direct care staff training (a.k.a. Direct Support Professional Training) was created by Assembly Bill 2780&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=http://www.lausd-dspt.net/resources/dspt_legislation.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-08-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070311073011/http://www.lausd-dspt.net/resources/dspt_legislation.htm |archivedate=2007-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; enacted in 1998. AB 950, approved by the Governor in August 2001, amends the Welfare and Institutions Code. Effective January 1, 1999, the Department of Developmental Services implemented mandated statewide competency-based training for direct support professionals employed in regional center vendored community care facilities.  This legislation followed a series reported by the San Francisco Chronicle on poorly trained staff and a high death rate for the developmentally disabled in the State of California.

In 1998, the California legislature established the Direct Support Professional (DSP) Training Program.
The purpose of the program is to increase quality of care for people with developmental disabilities living in licensed community care facilities by ensuring core competencies or skills for all direct support professionals.

The statewide training program requires all direct support professionals to successfully complete 70-hours of training over two years, or pass a challenge test for each of two, 35-hour training segments. Upon successfully completing either of these requirements, Direct Support Professional Certification will be provided.

The DSP requirements are not in place for DDN or DDH facilities under the Department of Health Services of the State of California.  These requirements are also not in place for day programs, work activity centers or for at home vendored service providers.

Hence dogfooding can act as quality control, and eventually a kind of testimonial advertising.

==Real world utilization==
''[[InfoWorld]]'' commented that this needs to be transparent and honest: "watered-down examples, such as auto dealers' policy of making salespeople drive the brands they sell, or Coca-Cola allowing no Pepsi products in corporate offices ... are irrelevant."&lt;ref name="yager"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.infoworld.com/d/developer-world/if-its-good-enough-fido-%E2%80%A6-990 | title=If it's good enough for Fido … | work=InfoWorld | date=2003-05-30 | accessdate=2013-06-15 | last=Yager | first=Tom}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, a corporate culture of not supporting the competitor is not the same as a philosophy of "eating your own dog food".  The latter focuses on the functional aspects of the company's own product.

Dogfooding allows employees to test their company's products in real-life situations; a perceived, but still controversial, advantage beyond marketing,&lt;ref name=dvorak/&gt;&lt;ref name=testing/&gt; which gives management a sense of how the product might be used—all before launch to consumers.&lt;ref name=testing&gt;{{cite book|last=Ash|first=Lydia|title=The Web testing companion: the insider's guide to efficient and effective tests|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tUYo644-SYcC&amp;pg=PR37|series=ITPro collection|year=2003|publisher=Wiley|isbn=0-471-43021-8|page=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In software development, dogfooding can occur in multiple stages: first, a stable version of the software is used with just a single new feature added. Then, multiple new features can be combined into a single version of the software and tested together. This allows several validations before the software is released. The practice enables proactive resolution of potential inconsistency and dependency issues, especially when several developers or teams work on the same product.

The risks of public dogfooding, specifically that a company may have difficulties using its own products, may reduce the frequency of publicized dogfooding.{{r|yager}}

==Origin of the term==

In 2006, the editor of ''[[IEEE Software]]'' recounted that in the 1970s, television advertisements for [[Alpo (pet food)|Alpo dog food]], [[Lorne Greene]] pointed out that he fed Alpo to his own dogs. Another possible origin he remembers is from the president of Kal Kan Pet Food, who was said to eat a can of his dog food at shareholders' meetings.&lt;ref name=ieee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Harrison|first=Warren|date=May–June 2006|title=From The Editor: Eating Your Own Dog Food|journal=IEEE Software|publisher=IEEE|volume=23|issue=3|pages=5–7|doi=10.1109/MS.2006.72|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2006/03/s3005.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Microsoft manager [[Paul Maritz]] sent [[Brian Valentine]], test manager for [[Microsoft LAN Manager]], an email titled "Eating our own Dogfood", challenging him to increase internal usage of the company's product. From there, the usage of the term spread through the company.&lt;ref&gt;''Inside Out: Microsoft—In Our Own Words'' ({{ISBN|0446527394}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.arnnet.com.au/article/317315/vmworld_2009_virtualization_controversy_eating_your_own_dog_food/?fp=39&amp;fpid=25874&amp;rid=1|title=VMworld 2009: Virtualization, controversy and eating your own dog food|last=Brodkin|first=John|date=4 September 2009|work=Network World|accessdate=17 May 2010}} Quote: "[Paul] Maritz also poked fun at himself by claiming that one of his only contributions to the IT world is coining the commonly used "eat your own dog food" phrase. "You can read about it on Wikipedia, so it must be true," Maritz said.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dave Cutler]]'s February 1991 insistence on dogfooding in development of [[Windows NT]] at [[Microsoft]] was documented in Pascal Zachary's 1994 book, ''Showstopper! The Breakneck Race to Create Windows NT and the Next Generation at Microsoft''. Microsoft developed the operating system on computers running NT daily builds, initially text only, then with graphics, and finally with networking.

==Examples==
The development of [[Windows NT]] at Microsoft involved over 200 developers in small teams, and it was held together by [[Dave Cutler]]'s February 1991 insistence on dogfooding. Microsoft developed the operating system on computers running NT daily builds. It was initially crash prone, but the immediate feedback of code breaking the build, the loss of pride, and the knowledge of impeding the work of others were all powerful motivators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bolman|first1=Lee G.|last2=Deal|first2=Terrence E.|title=Reframing organizations: artistry, choice, and leadership|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tsFj7wgczvYC&amp;pg=PA64|edition=3|series=Jossey-Bass business &amp; management series; Jossey-Bass higher and adult education series|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|isbn=0-7879-6426-3|page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zachary|first=Pascal G.|title=Showstopper! the Breakneck Race to Create Windows Nt and the Next Generation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWakyeSnG7AC|year=2009 |publisher=E-reads/E-rights|isbn=0-7592-8578-0|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; Windows developers would typically dogfood or [[self-hosting|self-host]] Windows starting from the early (alpha) builds, while the rest of the employees would start from the more stable beta builds that were also available to MSDN subscribers.{{Citation needed|reason=What timeframe?

==Criticisms and support==
Forcing those who design products to actually use and rely on them is sometimes thought to improve quality and [[usability]], but software developers may be blind to usability and may have knowledge to make software work that an end user will lack.&lt;ref name=testing/&gt; Microsoft's [[chief information officer]] noted in 2008 that, previously, "We tended not to go through the actual customer experience. We were always upgrading from a beta, not from production disk to production disk."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2008/12/12/cio-microsoft-scott-tech-cio-cx_es_1215microsoft.html|title=Eating Their Own Dog Food|last=Sperling|first=Ed|date=15 December 2008|work=Forbes|accessdate=17 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dogfooding may happen too early to be viable, and those forced to use the products may assume that someone else has reported the problem or they may get used to applying workarounds. Dogfooding may be unrealistic, as customers will always have a choice of different companies' products to use together, and the product may not be used as intended. The process can lead to a loss of productivity and demoralisation,&lt;ref name=testing/&gt; or at its extreme to "[[Not Invented Here]]" syndrome, i.e. only using internal products.&lt;ref name=ieee/&gt;

In 1989, [[Donald Knuth]] published a paper recounting lessons from the development of his [[TeX]] Typesetting software, in which the benefits of the approach were mentioned:{{Quote|text=Thus, I came to the conclusion that the designer of a new system must not only be the implementor and the first large-scale user; the designer should also write the first user manual. The separation of any of these four components would have hurt TeX significantly. If I had not participated fully in all these activities, literally hundreds of improvements would never have been made, because I would never have thought of them or perceived why they were important.|sign=[[Donald E.

==Alternative terms==
In 2007, Jo Hoppe, the CIO of [[Pegasystems]], said that she uses the alternative phrase "drinking our own champagne".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cio.com/article/122351/Pegasystems_CIO_Tells_Colleagues_Drink_Your_Own_Champagne|title=Pegasystems CIO Tells Colleagues: Drink Your Own Champagne |work= Trendline on CIO.com|accessdate=2007-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Novell's head of [[public relations]] Bruce Lowry, commenting on his company's use of [[Linux]] and [[OpenOffice.org]], said that he also prefers this phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8190577585.html|title=Novell comments on its transition to Linux desktops|date=13 April 2006|work=DesktopLinux|publisher=Ziff Davis Enterprise|accessdate=17 May 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616183048/http://www.desktoplinux.com/news/NS8190577585.html|archivedate=16 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, the new CIO of Microsoft, Tony Scott, argued that the phrase "dogfooding" was unappealing and should be replaced by "icecreaming", with the aim of developing products as "ice cream that our customers want to consume".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.techflash.com/seattle/2009/11/turning_dog_food_into_ice_cream_and_other_tidbits_from_microsofts_cio.html|title=Microsoft CIO on a mission to make ice cream out of dog food |publisher=TechFlash |date=November 10, 2009 |accessdate=2010-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; A less controversial and common alternative term used in some contexts is [[self-hosting]], where developers' workstations would, for instance, get updated automatically overnight to the latest daily build of the software or operating system on which they work. Developers of IBM's mainframe operating systems have long used the term "eating our own cooking".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4873">'''Georgian folk medicine''' (or '''Georgian traditional medicine''') originated at the crossroads of the East and West and therefore integrates the principles of both medical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmj.hr/1999/40/1/9933895.htm Ramaz Shengelia: Study of the History of Medicine in Georgia, p. 1]&lt;/ref&gt; On a scale between tribal level [[folk medicine]] and highly institutionalized [[Traditional Chinese medicine|Chinese]] and [[Unani]] [[Traditional medicine]]s, Georgian traditional medicine ranks closer to the better institutionalized and formalized end of the scale. Some ancient Georgian [[Folk remedy|folk remedies]] made it to the modern formulations and are commercially distributed in the form of modern drugs, mostly [[petrolatum]]-based ointments.

==Background==
Anthropological data suggest that [[Paleolithic]] [[Cro-Magnon]] people that dwelt on the territory of modern western Georgia may have known of some sort of primitive ointment made from animal brains mixed with fat.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dzeglebi.ge/statiebi/etnografia/dzveli_qartuli_medicina.html Archeological Evidence to Ancient Georgian Medicine (Georgian)].&lt;/ref&gt; Classical [[Greek mythology]] suggests that ancient Kolkhs ([[Colchis]] people) had practiced somewhat highly developed medicine that must have impressed the [[Mycenaean Greece|Mycenaean]] Greek ([[Minyans|Minyan]]) [[Argonauts|travelers]] at the time. Some historians of medicine suggest that the modern medical scientific principle "Contraria contrariis curantur" (opposite cures the opposite) dates back to ancient Kolkhs and their healer and sorceress princess [[Medea]], acquiring its final form in the classical Greek and eventually in the modern medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cmj.hr/1999/40/1/9933895.htm Ramaz Shengelia: Study of the History of Medicine in Georgia, p.2]&lt;/ref&gt; Georgian popular tradition even attributes the origins of the term Medicine solely to Medea's name. In fact, the term likely stems from the Indo-European root MA and MAD, “and its more familiar hypothetical form MED, meaning to think or to reflect, to give a consideration or care to”. Still, a possible relation between the name of Medea and the term Medicine cannot be decisively denied.&lt;ref&gt;Thelma Charen: “The Etymology of Medicine”, Bull Med Libr Assoc. 1951 July; 39(3): 216–221.[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC195119/pdf/mlab00237]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Karabadini-15-century-georgian-herbal-medical-almanac.jpg|thumb|"Karabadini" - the 15th-century Georgian medical Almanac by Zaza Panaskerteli-Tsitsishvili]]
Beginning of the recorded history of Georgian traditional medicine should be related to the first almanac of medical remedies and medical knowledge written in the 11th century, known as “Ustsoro Karabadini” (Georgian: უსწორო კარაბადინი).&lt;ref&gt;Karabadini (Georgian: კარაბადინი)[[:ka:კარაბადინი]]. Georgian.&lt;/ref&gt; After that, different compilations thereof, as well as original fundamental works, all mostly under similar titles (with the exception of the influential 16th-century medical encyclopedia titled "Iadigar Daudi" - Georgian: იადიგარ დაუდი,&lt;ref&gt;Iadigar Daudi (Georgian: იდიგარ დაუდი)[[:ka:იადიგარ დაუდი]]. Georgian.&lt;/ref&gt; and a few more), were published once or twice every 100 years until the end of the 19th century. These works, along with the unique local remedies, also include knowledge influenced by the ancient Greek, Byzantine, and Central Asian and Middle East medical traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Nikobadze I.I.: Ibn Sina (Avicenna) in old Georgian medicine, Sov Med. 1959 Aug;23:141-4. Russian.&lt;/ref&gt;

The highly developed feudal social structure of Medieval Georgia led to the emergence of traditional [[Georgian medical families]] (not too unlike the better known [[Irish medical families]]), one of which, the Turmanidze family (Georgian: თურმანიძეები) is first mentioned in historical documents somewhere on the turn of the 10th and 11th centuries. So great was the clout of the bearers of Turmanidze family traditions even in the twentieth century that some representatives of the family who lacked any formal education were nevertheless granted medical licenses by the Soviet officials, who were generally very adamant about disallowing traditional medicine methods in the official Soviet medicine.&lt;ref&gt;Turmanidze medical family (Georgian: თურმანიძეები)[[:ka:თურმანიძეები]].

{{Refimprove|date=February 2009}}
[[File:Grease trap for greywater (5293658840).jpg|thumb|Grease trap for [[greywater]] in Lima, Peru]]

A '''grease trap''' (also known as '''grease interceptor''', '''grease recovery device''' and '''grease converter''') is a [[plumbing]] device (a type of [[Trap (plumbing)|trap]]) designed to intercept most [[Fat|grease]]s and solids before they enter a wastewater disposal system. Common wastewater contains small amounts of oils which enter into [[septic tanks]] and treatment facilities to form a floating [[Impurity|scum]] layer. This scum layer is very slowly digested and broken down by microorganisms in the [[anaerobic digestion]] process. Large amounts of oil from food preparation in restaurants can overwhelm a septic tank or treatment facility, causing release of untreated sewage into the environment. High-viscosity fats and cooking grease such as [[lard]] solidify when cooled, and can combine with other disposed solids to block drain pipes.

Grease traps have been used since Victorian days: Nathaniel Whiting obtained the first patent in the late 1800's.  The traps reduce the amount of fats, oils and greases (FOGs) that enter sewers. They comprise boxes within the drain run that flows between the sinks in a kitchen and the sewer system. They only have kitchen waste water flowing through them, and do not serve any other drainage system, such as toilets. They can be made from many different materials, such as stainless steel, plastics, concrete &amp; cast iron. They range from 35 liter capacity to 45,000 liters and greater. They can be located above ground, below ground, inside the kitchen or outside the building.

==Types==
[[Image:InGroundGreaseTrapParkingLot.JPG|right|thumb|175px|Manhole covers of a grease trap outside a restaurant.]]
{{unreferenced section|date=June 2011}}
There are three primary types of device. The most common are those specified by [[ASME]] (American Society Of Mechanical Engineers), utilizing baffles, or a proprietary inlet diffuser. 
  
Grease trap sizing is based on the size of the 2- or 3-compartment sink, dishwasher, pot sinks, and mop sinks.  The cumulative flow rates of these devices, as well as overall grease retention capacity (in pounds or kilograms) are considered. Currently, ASME Standard (ASME A112.14.3) is being adopted by both of the National Model Plumbing Codes that cover most of the US.  This standard requires that grease interceptors remove a minimum of 90% of incoming FOGs.  It also requires that grease interceptors are third-party tested and certified to 90 days compliance with the standard pumping. This third-party testing must be conducted by a recognized and approved testing laboratory.

The most common passive grease traps are smaller, point-of-use units used under three-compartment sinks or adjacent to dishwashers in kitchens.

The second most common type of interceptor is the large in-ground tank, which is usually {{convert|500|-|2000|gal}}. These units are constructed of concrete, fiberglass or steel. They have greater grease and solid storage capacities for high-flow applications such as a [[restaurant]] or [[hospital]] store. They are commonly called gravity interceptors. Interceptors require a retention time of 30 minutes to allow the fats, oils, grease and food solids to settle in the tank. As more waste water enters the tank, the grease-free water is pushed out of the tank. The rotting brown grease inside a grease trap or grease interceptor must be pumped out on a scheduled basis. The brown grease is not recycled and goes to landfill. On average {{convert|300|to|400|lbs}} of brown grease goes to landfill annually from each restaurant.

A third system type, GRDs (grease recovery devices), removes the grease automatically when trapped. The recovered grease or "yellow grease" is recycled with the waste vegetable oil from the kitchen's deep-fryers. Restaurants need not effect grease trap pumping as do restaurants with conventional grease traps or grease interceptors. 

Passive grease traps and passive grease interceptors must be emptied and cleaned when 25% full. As the passive devices fill with fats, oils, and grease, they become less productive for grease recovery. A full grease trap does not stop any FOG from entering the sanitary sewer system. The emptied contents or "brown grease" is considered hazardous waste in many jurisdictions.

==Uses==
[[File:InGroundGreaseTrap.JPG|thumb|In-ground grease trap outside of a shop]]
Restaurant and foodservice kitchens produce much waste grease which is present in the drain lines from various sinks, dishwashers and cooking equipment such as [[combi steamer|combi ovens]] and commercial [[wok]]s. If not removed, the grease can clump and cause blockage and back-up in the [[sanitary sewer|sewer]].

In the US, sewers back up annually “an estimated 400,000 times, and municipal sewer overflows on 40,000 occasions”.&lt;ref&gt;Whitman, D. (2000). The sickening sewer crisis. U.S. News &amp; World Report, 128(23), 16. Retrieved Friday, May 04, 2007 from the Business Source Corporate database.&lt;/ref&gt; The EPA has determined that sewer pipe blockages are the leading cause of sewer overflows, and grease is the primary cause of sewer blockages.&lt;ref&gt;EPA. (2004). Report to Congress: impacts and control of CSOs and SSOs (EPA 833-R-04-001). Washington, DC; United State Environmental Protection Agency Office of Water, p. 4-28.  http://cfpub.epa.gov/npdes/cso/cpolicy_report2004.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;  Even if accumulated FOG does not escalate into blockages and sanitary sewer overflows, it can disrupt wastewater utility operations and increase operations and maintenance requirements” &lt;ref&gt;Mero, C. &amp; Wilkerson, J. (2007). Reduce Sewer Congestion. Water Environment &amp; Technology, 19(7), 44-52.&lt;/ref&gt;

For these reasons, depending on the country, nearly all municipalities require commercial kitchen operations to use some type of interceptor device to collect grease before it enters sewers.  Where FOG is a concern in the local wastewater system, communities have established inspection programs to ensure that these grease traps and/or interceptors are being routinely maintained.

It is estimated 50% of all sewer overflows are caused by grease blockages, with over {{convert|10|e9gal}} of raw sewage spills annually.

==Method of operation==
{{Unreferenced section|date=October 2014}}

When the outflow from the kitchen sink enters the grease trap, the solid food particles sink to the bottom, while lighter grease and oil floats to the top.  The relatively grease-free water is then fed into the normal septic system.  The food solids at the bottom and floating oil and grease must be periodically removed in a manner similar to [[septic tank]] pumping.  A traditional grease trap is not a food disposal unit. Unfinished food must be scraped into the garbage or food recycling bin. Milkshakes, gravy, sauces and food solids must be scraped off dishes before entering the sink or dishwasher.

To maintain some degree of efficiency, there has been a trend to specify larger traps. Unfortunately, providing a large tank for the [[effluent]] to stand also means that food waste has time to settle to the bottom of the tank, reducing available volume and adding to clean-out problems. Also, rotting food contained within an interceptor breaks down, producing toxic waste (such as sulfur gases) - [[hydrogen sulfide]] combines with the water present to create [[sulfuric acid]]. This attacks mild steel and concrete materials, resulting in "rot out", On the other hand, polyethylene has acid-resisting properties.  A bigger interceptor is not a better interceptor. In most cases, multiple interceptors in series will separate grease much better.

Because it has been in the trap for some time, grease thus collected will be contaminated and is unsuitable for further use. This type of grease is called [[brown grease]].

==Disposal of trapped grease==

Waste from passive grease traps and gravity interceptors is called [[brown grease]]. Brown grease is rotted food solids in combination with fats, oils, and grease (FOG). Brown grease is pumped from the traps and interceptors by grease pumping trucks. Unlike the collected [[yellow grease]], the majority of brown grease goes to landfill sites. New facilities (2012) and new technology are beginning to allow brown grease to be recycled.

'''Guided bone regeneration''' or '''GBR''', and '''guided tissue regeneration''' or '''GTR''' are [[Dentistry|dental]] surgical procedures that use [[barrier membrane]]s to direct the growth of new bone and gingival tissue at sites with insufficient volumes or dimensions of bone or gingiva for proper function, esthetics or prosthetic restoration.

GBR is similar to guided tissue regeneration (GTR) but is focused on development of hard tissues in addition to the soft tissues of the [[periodontium|periodontal attachment]]. At present, guided bone regeneration is predominantly applied in the oral cavity to support new hard tissue growth on an [[alveolar ridge]] to allow stable placement of [[dental implant]]s.  [[Bone grafting]] used in conjunction with sound surgical technique, GBR is a reliable and validated procedure.Guided bone regeneration typically refers to ridge augmentation or bone regenerative procedures; guided tissue regeneration typically refers to regeneration of periodontal attachment.

==History==
Use of [[barrier membrane]]s to direct bone regeneration was first described in the context of orthopaedic research 1959.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Hurley LA, Stinchfield FE, Bassett AL, Lyon WH |title=The role of soft tissues in osteogenesis.

Periodontol. |volume=47 |issue=5 |pages=256–60 |date=May 1976 |pmid=775048 |doi= 10.1902/jop.1976.47.5.256|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on positive clinical results of regeneration in periodontology research in the 1980s, research began to focus on the potential for re-building alveolar bone defects using guided bone regeneration.  The theory of Guided tissue regeneration has been challenged in dentistry.  
The GBR principle was first examined by Dahlin et al. in 1988 on rats.
The selective ingrowth of bone-forming cells into a bone defect region could be improved if the adjacent tissue is kept away with a membrane; this was confirmed in a study by Kosopoulos and Karring in 1994.
GBR can be used for bone regeneration on exposed implant coils .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 761531 | doi=10.1055/s-0028-1103897 | volume=104 | title=[Time of persistence of fluocortolone hexanoate in the knee-joint after intra-articular injection (author's transl)] | journal=Dtsch Med Wochenschr | pages=293–5 | vauthors=Mützel W, Tillmann K, Gerhards E}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have shown greater attachment gain for guided tissue regeneration (GTR) over open flap debridement. However, this systematic review has shown that the outcomes following GTR are highly variable, both between and within studies. Therefore, patients and health professionals need to consider the predictability of the technique compared with other methods of treatment before making final decisions on use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Guided tissue regeneration for periodontal infra-bony defects {{!}} Cochrane|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD001724/ORAL_guided-tissue-regeneration-for-periodontal-infra-bony-defects|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001724.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barrier membrane is utilized in GBR technique to cover the bone defect and create a secluded space, which prevents the connective tissue from growing into the space and facilitates the growth priority of bone tissue.

Barrier membrane criteria should be as follows: 
* Biocompatible 
* Excludes unwanted cell types 
* allow tissue integration 
* creates and maintains space 
* provided the structure is easy to trim and place&lt;ref name="Blackwell Munksgaard"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/171258234|title=Clinical periodontology and implant dentistry|date=2008|publisher=Blackwell Munksgaard|others=Lindhe, Jan., Lang, Niklaus Peter., Karring, Thorkild.|isbn=1405160993|edition=5th|location=Oxford|oclc=171258234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several surgical techniques via GBR have been proposed regarding the tri-dimensional bone reconstruction of the severely resorbed [[maxilla]], using different types of bone substitutes that have regenerative, osseoinductive or osseoconductive properties which  is  then  packed  into  the  bony  defect  and covered  by resorbable membranes. In cases where augmentation materials used are autografts or allografts the bone density is quite low and resorption of the grafted site in these cases can reach up to 30% of original volume. For higher predictability, nonresorbable titanium-reinforced d-[[polytetrafluoroethylene]] (d-PTFE) membranes—as a barrier against the migration of epithelial cells within the grafted site—are recommended. In patients with systemic problems interdisciplinary collaboration is indicated to adjust therapy background so that it does not adversely affect implanto-prosthetic treatment.&lt;ref name="RevistaOMF"&gt;{{cite journal

&lt;/ref&gt; Current  treatments  for  destructive  periodontal

disease  are  not  able  to  restore damaged  bone and connective tissue support for teeth (infra-bony defects). There are limitations in treating patients with advanced disease but GTR may be able to achieve regeneration and therefore improve upon conventional surgical results.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD001724.pub2/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Needleman|first=Ian|last2=Worthington|first2=Helen V|last3=Giedrys-Leeper|first3=Elaine|last4=Tucker|first4=Richard|date=2006-04-19|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd001724.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two types of membranes based on the characteristics and resorbability.

Resorbable:

There are many different types of resorbable membranes out there but the main ones are synthetic  polymers and natural biomaterials. Synthetic polymers are such that it is a polylactic  acid bilayer, or the collagen-derived membranes. These membranes can be obtained from bovine or porcine or dermis. E.g. Emdogain which has been shown to significantly improve  probing attachment levels (1.1mm) and periodontal pocket depth reduction (0.9mm) when compared to a placebo or control materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD003875.pub3/abstract|title=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|last=Esposito|first=Marco|last2=Grusovin|first2=Maria Gabriella|last3=Papanikolaou|first3=Nikolaos|last4=Coulthard|first4=Paul|last5=Worthington|first5=Helen V|date=2009-10-07|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|issn=1465-1858|language=en|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd003875.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Resorption rates ranging from six to 24 weeks depending on its different chemical structures. With the resorbable  membrane used, the membrane will bio-degrade. There is no need for a second surgery to remove the membrane, this will prevent any disruption to the healing process of the regenerated tissues.&lt;ref name="Blackwell Munksgaard" /&gt; A synthetic resorbable membrane indicated an amount of stable augmented bone similar  to  that  of  a  collagen  resorbable  membrane.  These are the results obtained based on a randomised clinical trial done to compare the stability of augmented bone between a  synthetic resorbable membrane and a collagen membrane with guide bone regeneration simultaneous with dental implant placement in the aesthetic zone in terms of facial bone thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arunjaroensuk|first=Sirida|last2=Panmekiate|first2=Soontra|last3=Pimkhaokham|first3=Atiphan|date=2017-10-13|title=The Stability of Augmented Bone Between Two Different Membranes Used for Guided Bone Regeneration Simultaneous with Dental Implant Placement in the Esthetic Zone|journal=The International Journal of Oral &amp; Maxillofacial Implants|doi=10.11607/jomi.5492|issn=1942-4434|pmid=29028848}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indications==
There are several uses of bone regeneration:
*Fenestration and Dehiscence
* building up bone around implants placed in [[Dental alveolus|tooth sockets]] after [[Dental extraction|tooth extraction]]
*[[socket preservation]] for future implantation of false teeth or prosthetics
*Sinus Lift Elevation prior to implant placement
* filling of bone after removing the root of a [[tooth]], [[cystectomy]] or the removal of [[tooth impaction|impacted teeth]]
* repairing bone defects surrounding dental implant caused by peri-implantitis
* Periodontal  tissue regeneration following success of cleaning the root surface through root surface debridement (RSD) &lt;!-- Contraindication

The '''Indonesian Red Cross Society''' ({{lang-id|Palang Merah Indonesia}}) is a humanitarian organization in [[Indonesia]]. It is a member of [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies]].

Indonesia is the one of the very few Muslim-majority countries to use the Red Cross as its symbol. Because Indonesia is neither a strictly faith-based nor secular nation, it has chosen to use the Red Cross as its symbol.&lt;ref&gt;"Indonesian Red Cross Refuses to Change Its Logo", ''[[The Jakarta Globe]]'', 26 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2013, the Indonesian Red Cross Society had 32,568 people in its Volunteer Corps, 19,294 Individual Volunteers and 893,381 Blood Donor Volunteers, for a total of 945,243 persons, which is recorded as the highest number of volunteers in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pmi.or.id/ina/news/?act=detail&amp;p_id=1016 |title=PMI Bina dan Kembangkan Relawan melalui Temu Karya Nasional |date=13 June 2013 |publisher=Indonesian Red Cross Society}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The IRCS was created on 17 September 1945, exactly one month after Indonesia's independence.&lt;ref name="PMIhistory"&gt;[http://www.pmi.or.id/ina/history/default.asp?act=pmi "History"]. Indonesian Red Cross Society.&lt;/ref&gt; President [[Sukarno]] ordered its inception when a battle between Indonesian soldiers and allied troops broke out, leaving many wounded, on 3 September 1945.&lt;ref name="PMIhistory" /&gt; Based on the performance, IRCS received an international recognition in 1950 that it was accepted as a member of the International Red Cross and achieved its legal status through Presidential Decree Number 25 Year 1959, which was later reinforced by Presidential Decree Number 245 Year 1963.&lt;ref name="PMIhistory" /&gt;

==Location==
The IRCS central headquarters is located at Jl. Jenderal Gatot Soebroto Kav. 96, Jakarta 12790.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pmi.or.id/ina/contact/ "Contact"]. Indonesian Red Cross Society.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1945">'''Interklinik Bratislava''' is a clinic based in the capital of the [[Slovak Republic]], [[Bratislava]]. Established in 1995, it consists of over 1,000 square meters of operating rooms, ambulances, inpatient rooms and spa.

==Default==

Interklinik constist of a number of interconnected companies, several ones of which are in default- their net equity is negative. 
The Interklinik companies in default as of June 2018 are:
INTERKLINIK SPA s.r.o. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Finstat |url=https://finstat.sk/44086563 |website=Finstat |accessdate=1/6/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 
INTERKLINIK VITAL s.r.o. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://finstat.sk/45477302 |website=Finstat |accessdate=1/6/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

As of June 2018, there are creditors publicly seeking other creditors for the purposes of joint action/acquisition of debt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://interklinik.wordpress.com/ |website=Interklinik debtors website |accessdate=1/6/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Interklinik was established in 1994 as a clinic specialising in several areas of surgery. Under the auspices of its new director Tomas Stern, M.D. it later moved to the city-center of Bratislava and increased its scope of specialisations, including stomatology and medical spa treatments. The company offering spa treatments- Interklinik SPA s.r.o., is currently in default.

Mr. Tomas Stern is currently the sole director of INTERKLINIK VITAL s.r.o.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orsr.sk/vypis.asp?ID=176950&amp;SID=2&amp;P=0&amp;lan=en |website=Business register |accessdate=1/6/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one o the directors of INTERKLINIK SPA s.r.o. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.orsr.sk/vypis.asp?ID=124752&amp;SID=2&amp;P=0 |website=Business register |accessdate=1/6/2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the clinic is situated at Einsteinova street in the [[Petržalka]] district.

'''Intravenous marijuana&lt;!-- As per scientific literature on the syndrome.--&gt; syndrome''' is a distinct short-term clinical syndrome related to the intravenous injection of boiled [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] broth, which had been filtered through a [[cotton]] cloth. The syndrome has at least 25 known cases in the English language literature, but all of them prior to 1983.&lt;ref name=WernickEtAl1986&gt;{{cite journal

It is postulated that contamination, perhaps from the cotton used to strain the liquid of the broth or from particulate plant matter getting through the straining method, could be cause for the cases of illnesses.&lt;ref name="WernickEtAl1986"/&gt;

The common side effects of intravenous marijuana syndrome include fever, [[myalgia]], [[nausea]], and vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brandenburg|first=D|last2=Wernick|first2=R|date=1986-07-01|title=Intravenous marijuana syndrome.|journal=Western Journal of Medicine|volume=145|issue=1|pages=94–96|issn=0093-0415|pmc=1306836|pmid=3489321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Iron poisoning''' is an [[iron overload]] caused by a large excess of [[iron]] intake and usually refers to an acute overload rather than a gradual one. The term has been primarily associated with young children&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Infantile iron poisoning: Challenges in diagnosis and management|url = http://content.wkhealth.com/linkback/openurl?sid=WKPTLP:landingpage&amp;an=00130478-200905000-00040|journal = Pediatric Critical Care Medicine|pages = e31-e33|volume = 10|issue = 3|doi = 10.1097/pcc.0b013e318198b0c2|first = Kevin|last = Valentine|first2 = Christopher|last2 = Mastropietro|first3 = Ashok P.|last3 = Sarnaik}}&lt;/ref&gt; who consumed large quantities of [[iron supplement]] pills, which resemble sweets and are widely used, including by pregnant women; approximately 3 grams is lethal for a two-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ansci.cornell.edu/plants/toxicagents/iron.html |title=Iron Toxicity, What You Don't Know |work=Plants Poisonous to Livestock |publisher=Cornell University Department of Animal Science |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeted packaging restrictions in the US for supplement containers with over 250&amp;nbsp;mg elemental iron have existed since 1978, and recommendations for unit packaging have reduced the several iron poisoning fatalities per year to almost zero since 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tenenbein |first=M. |date=June 2005 |title=Unit-Dose Packaging of Iron Supplements and Reduction of Iron Poisoning in Young Children |journal=Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med |volume=159 |pages=557–560 |url=http://archpedi.ama-assn.org/cgi/content/full/159/6/557 |doi=10.1001/archpedi.159.6.557 | pmid = 15939855}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=AAPCC Annual Reports |publisher=American Association of Poison Control Centers |url=http://www.aapcc.org/annual.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522011517/http://www.aapcc.org/annual.htm |archivedate=2008-05-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; No known cases of iron poisoning have been identified that are associated with [[iron mining]].{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Signs and symptoms==
The first indication of iron poisoning by ingestion is stomach pain, as iron is corrosive to the lining of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach. Nausea and vomiting are also common symptoms and [[hematemesis|bloody vomiting]] may occur. The pain then abates for 24 hours as the iron passes deeper into the body, resulting in [[metabolic acidosis]], which in turn damages internal organs, particularly the [[brain]] and the [[liver]].  Iron poisoning can cause [[hypovolemic shock]] due to iron's potent ability to [[vasodilation|dilate the blood vessels]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}} Death may occur from [[liver failure]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2012}}

If intake of iron is for a prolonged period of time, symptoms are likely to be similar to other causes of [[iron overload]].

==Cause==
{{main|Iron}}
In nature, iron is usually found in its oxidized form, [[iron (III) oxide]], which is insoluble. Ferrous iron, iron (II), is soluble and its toxicity varies, largely with the integrity of the gastrointestinal lining. Iron supplements are typically used to treat [[anemia]].  Modalities include: diet, parasite control,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Stoltzfus RJ, Dreyfuss ML |title=Guidelines for the Use of Iron Supplements to Prevent and Treat Iron Deficiency Anemia |date=2000 |publisher=International Nutritional Anemia Consultative Group, International Life Sciences Institute Press |url=http://www.ilsi.org/file/b2_VUHUQ8AK.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vitamin A]], [[riboflavin]] (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Allen LH |title=Iron Supplements: Scientific Issues Concerning Efficacy and Implications for Research and Programs |journal=J. Nutr. |volume=132 |issue=4 |pages=813S–9S |date=April 2002 |pmid=11925487 |url=http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/content/full/132/4/813S}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[vitamin C]] (for absorption), [[folate]](B&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;), [[Vitamin B12|vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;]] and multivitamin-multimineral supplements,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/dci/Diseases/anemia/anemia_all.html |title=What Is Anemia? |publisher=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services |date=18 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with or without iron; potentially avoiding the use of iron only supplements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Hemochromatosis and Anemia Diet |publisher=Iron Overload Diseases Association |url=http://www.ironoverload.org/Diet.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Toxic dose===
The amount of iron ingested may give a clue to potential toxicity. The therapeutic dose for iron deficiency anemia is 3–6&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day. Toxic effects begin to occur at doses above 10–20&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of elemental iron. Ingestions of more than 50&amp;nbsp;mg/kg of elemental iron are associated with severe toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/iron-poisoning |title=Iron Poisoning |publisher=Webmd.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A 325-mg tablet of ferrous sulfate heptahydrate has 65&amp;nbsp;mg (20%) of elemental iron
* A 325-mg tablet of ferrous gluconate has 39&amp;nbsp;mg (12%) of elemental iron
* A 325-mg tablet of ferrous fumarate has 107.25&amp;nbsp;mg (33%) of elemental iron
* 200&amp;nbsp;mg ferrous sulfate, dried, has 65&amp;nbsp;mg (33%) of elemental iron

In terms of [[blood values]], iron levels above 350–500 [[microgram|µg]]/dL are considered toxic, and levels over 1000&amp;nbsp;µg/dL indicate severe iron poisoning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Iron Tests |date= |work= |publisher=The Free Dictionary by Falex |url=http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Iron+Tests}} citing: Gale Encyclopedia of Medicine. Copyright 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
A detail history of the ingestion especially the number of pills  taken can be vital. Diagnosis of iron poisoning can be made in the absence of a specific history by clinical judgment, imagining investigation and lab assessment.  Iron tablets may be imaged by radiography. Serum iron levels can be tested and are useful regarding the administration of iron-binding ligands such as deferoxamine. Clinic presentation in the absence of treatment follows in stages and is dose dependent (how much iron was taken):,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/54913574|title=Pediatrics|date=2005|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|others=Brown, Lloyd J., Miller, Lee T.

Later stage treatment consists of [[Chelation therapy|cleaning the iron from the blood]], using a [[chelating agent]] such as [[deferoxamine]].  If this fails then [[dialysis]] is the next step.

'''José Juan Bautista Pampuro''' (born December 28, 1949) is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] politician. He is a member of the [[Justicialist Party]], was formerly a Defense Minister and is currently a [[Argentine Senate|senator]] for [[Buenos Aires Province]]. He serves as the Senate provisional President and is second in line for the presidential succession.

Pampuro was born in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1949. He enrolled at the [[University of Buenos Aires]] and earned a Medical Degree. He entered public service in 1983, when he was named Public Health Secretary to the Mayor of [[Lanús]], [[Manuel Quindimil]]. He was elected to the [[Argentine Chamber of Deputies|Lower House of Congress]] on the populist [[Justicialist Party]] ticket in 1987, and was named Minister of Health and Social Policy for Buenos Aires Province by newly elected Governor [[Eduardo Duhalde]] in 1991.&lt;ref name=senado&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/senadores/biografia.php?id_sena=368|title=José Pampuro|publisher=Senado de la Nación|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110531191043/http://www.senado.gov.ar/web/senadores/biografia.php?id_sena=368|archivedate=2011-05-31|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was named director of the Buenos Aires Provincial Office (each Argentine province maintains one in the nation's capital) in 1993, and remained in the post until being returned by voters to Congress in 1999. Eduardo Duhalde, appointed [[President of Argentina]] by Congress during a crisis in 2002, named Pampuro Chief of Staff, and on May 25, 2003, he was retained in government by President [[Néstor Kirchner]], who named Pampuro his first Defense Minister.&lt;ref name=senado/&gt;

Pampuro was elected to the Senate on the [[Front for Victory]] slate alongside [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] in the [[Argentine legislative election, 2005|2005 mid-term elections]], in which the center-left Front for Victory did well. He was elected Provisional President of the Senate on February 22, 2006, putting him second in line to the presidency,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2006/02/22/um/m-01146754.htm|title=El ex ministro Pampuro fue designado número dos del Senado|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and twice as President of the [[Mercosur Parliament]] (during the first half of 2008 and the first half of 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.somosmercosur.net/boletin/jose-pampuro-asumio-como-presidente-del-parlamento-y-se-comprometio-a-trabajar-con-fuerza-por-un-mercosur-mas-amplio-y-participativo.html|title=José Pampuro asumió como presidente del parlamento|publisher=Somos Mercosur|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426050200/http://www.somosmercosur.net/boletin/jose-pampuro-asumio-como-presidente-del-parlamento-y-se-comprometio-a-trabajar-con-fuerza-por-un-mercosur-mas-amplio-y-participativo.html|archivedate=2012-04-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pampuro retired from the Senate in 2011 with the distinction of being the first man in Argentina to twice be succeeded by women who were first to hold their respective posts: as Defense Minister by [[Nilda Garré]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://edant.clarin.com/diario/2005/11/29/elpais/p-02401.htm|title=La otra sorpresa fue la llegada de Nilda Garré al Ministerio de Defensa|publisher=''Clarín''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as Provisional President of the Senate by [[Beatriz Rojkés de Alperovich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e24n.com.ar/ini/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=3703:beatriz-rojkes-de-alperovich-sera-la-primera-mujer-en-presidir-el-senado&amp;catid=38:nacionales&amp;Itemid=56 |title=Beatriz Rojkés de Alperovich será la primera mujer en presidir el Senado |publisher=''El Dorado Noticias'' }}{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In part of Iran there are some special classical traditions specially  for the night of [[yalda]]. during this longest night in south  Khorasan family are gathering to provide a kind of sweet called Kaf.

==Preparation==
The sweet Kaf is based on the root of [[Acanthophyllum squarrosum]] the root should be cleaned and boiled at least three times and the boiled water be discarded until the water has a good smell and good taste.

During this ceremony, the root of the plant called "Chubak", or Bikh  which is known as [[Acanthophyllum]] , is soaked in water and after several boils, they are shed in a large pot called "Tegar". Families and men, with a handful of thin pods of pomegranate trees, called the "batches"  shake of the liquid, for hours, to become rigid, and this should be done in a cool environment so that the liquid is foamed and then hardened to dry. Like Isfahan Gaz
The prepared Kaf is prepared at the end by mixing the juice or sugar, and after being decorated, the walnut and pistachio are taken to the guests. In the meantime, a group of young  are allowed to sweeten the kaf by throwing it to each other and rubbing the kaf to face of  each other adding happiness to the guests.[http://parssea.org/?p=8399]

Another custom performed in certain parts of Iran and khorasan on the night of  [[yalda]] (Chelleh) involves young engaged couples. The men send an edible arrangement containing seven kinds of fruits and a variety of gifts to their fiancees on this night. In some areas, the girl and her family return the favor by sending gifts back for the young man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=KafBikh |author=Dr.Mohammad Ajam|publisher=parssea}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Foods in iran |author=http://parssea.org/?p=8399 .|year=2011|publisher=parssea}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6039">The '''Lalonde Report''' is a 1974 report produced in [[Canada]] formally titled ''A new perspective on the health of Canadians''.&lt;ref name=Lalonde&gt;Lalonde M. [http://www.phac-aspc.gc.ca/ph-sp/pdf/perspect-eng.pdf ''A new perspective on the health of Canadians. A working document''.] Ottawa: Government of Canada, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; It proposed the concept of the "'''health field'''", identifying two main health-related objectives: the [[health care system]]; and prevention of [[health]] problems and [[health promotion|promotion of good health]]. The report is considered the "first modern government document in the Western world to acknowledge that our emphasis upon a biomedical health care system is wrong, and that we need to look beyond the traditional health care (sick care) system if we wish to improve the health of the public."&lt;ref&gt;Hancock, Trevor. [http://www.ncchpp.ca/docs/BeyondHealthCare.pdf "Beyond Health Care: From Public Health Policy to Health Public Policy."] ''Canadian Journal of Public Health'' 76, Supplement One (May/June 1985).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Marc Lalonde]], who was the [[Minister of Health (Canada)|Canadian Minister of National Health and Welfare]] in 1974, proposed a new "health field" concept, as distinct from medical care. Lalonde noted that the "traditional or generally-accepted view of the health field is that the art or science of [[medicine]] has been the fount from which all improvements in health have flowed, and popular belief equates the level of health with the quality of medicine." The new concept "envisage[d] that the health field can be broken up into four broad elements: [[Human biology]], [[Environmental quality|Environment]], [[lifestyle (sociology)|Lifestyle]], and [[Health care system|Health care organization]];" that is, determinants of [[health]] existed outside of the health care systems.&lt;ref name=Lalonde/&gt;

The report was written by a group of civil servants led by Hubert (Bert) Laframboise.

The report is considered to have led to the development and evolution of [[health promotion]], recognizing both the need for people to take more responsibility in changing their behaviors to improve their own health, and also the contribution of healthy communities and environments to health.&lt;ref name="Minkler1989"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Minkler | first1 = M | date = Spring 1989 | title = Health education, health promotion and the open society: an historical perspective | url = http://heb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/16/1/17 | journal = Health Educ Q | volume = 16 | issue = 1| pages = 17–30 | doi=10.1177/109019818901600105 | pmid=2649456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Policy"&gt;Glouberman S.

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another innovation of the report was that it proposed that [[public health]] interventions should focus attention on that segment of the population with the highest level of [[risk factor|risk exposure]]. It this sense, the report was fundamental in identifying health risk behaviours as a determinant of [[health inequality|health inequalities]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frohlich | first1 = KL | last2 = Potvin | first2 = L | date = Feb 2008 | title = Transcending the known in public health practice.

The proposals advocated by the report seem to have had mixed outcomes; while its nutritional and exercise recommendations are believed to have been widely accepted, there remains disagreement about its overall impact on population health. It has been argued such debates highlight the need for a fuller exploration of the [[health policy|health policies]] in place.&lt;ref name="Policy"/&gt;

==Health field==
The concept of the "health field", as identified in the Lalonde report, is considered to be composed of four interdependent fields determined to influence individual's health. These include:&lt;ref name=Lalonde/&gt;

* Biology: all aspects of health, physical and [[mental health|mental]], developed within the [[human body]] as influenced by [[genetics|genetic]] make-up;
* Environmental: all matters related to health external to the human body, over which the individual has little or no control, including the physical and social environment; 
* Lifestyle: the aggregation of personal decisions (i.e. over which the individual has control) that can be said to contribute to, or cause, illness or death; 
* Health care organization: includes medical practice, nursing, [[hospital]]s, nursing homes, medical drugs, [[public health|public health services]], paramedic services, dental treatment and other health services.

A major project of the institute which fulfilled its mission to disseminate knowledge was publication of the book ''[http://www.gutenberg.org/etext/19598 How to Live, Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science]'', now in the [[public domain]].

The institute was a proponent of [[eugenics]] including sterilization of grossly "unfit" individuals:
{{cquote|&lt;em&gt;It depends largely upon the action of those now upon the earth, who are now making their choices of marriage, as to whether the races of the future shall be physical, mental or moral weaklings, or whether they shall be physically brave and hardy, mentally broad and profound, and morally sterling.

To summarize: There are three main lines along which eugenic improvement of the race may be attained:

(1) Education of all people on the inheritability of traits; (2) segregation of defectives so that they may not mingle their family traits with those on sound lines; (3) sterilization of certain gross and hopeless defectives, to preclude the propagation of their type.&lt;/em&gt;|40px|40px|Irving Fisher and Eugene Lyman Fisk|''How to Live, Rules for Healthful Living Based on Modern Science''}}

The '''United Nations Security Council''' ('''UNSC''') is the organ of the [[United Nations]] charged with maintaining [[peace]] and [[security]] among [[nation]]s. While other organs of the United Nations only make recommendations to member [[government]]s, the Security Council has the power to make decisions; which member governments must carry out if they fall under Chapter VII of the under the [[United Nations Charter]]. The decisions of the Council are known as [[United Nations Security Council Resolution]]s.

A [[UN member states|UN member State]], is obligated to respect the [[United Nations Charter]] and UN members are bound by its articles. Cyprus claims that [[Turkey]] violates the charter against [[Republic of Cyprus]]. [[Turkey]] does not recognize the continued existence of the [[Republic of Cyprus]], as established by the [[London and Zurich Agreements]][http://www.byegm.gov.tr/REFERENCES/cyprus-mfa.htm] Turkey refers to the Republic of Cyprus as the "Greek Cypriot administration" or "South Cyprus". [http://www.mfa.gov.tr/MFA/PressInformation/PressReleasesAndStatements/pressReleases1999/June/June_4_1999.htm][http://www.mfa.gov.tr/MFA/ForeignPolicy/MainIssues/Cyprus/Statement+By+President+Denktaş+In+Response+To+The+Call+Made+By+Greek+Cypriot+Leader+Clerides+For+Tur.htm]

In 1974 [[Turkey]] invaded Cyprus, after a military coup staged by the Greek Junta against the lawfully elected Government of Cyprus under President Makarios. The Turkish army subsequently occupied ~38% of the territory of the island which to this day remains de facto divided with  ''"Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus"'' (TRNC) proclaimed in 1983 following a UDI by the Turkish Cypriots. The ''"TRNC"'' is an illegal entity as per UN Security Council Resolutions UN Security Council Resolution 541 and UN Security Council Resolution 550 and is recognized only by Turkey. The latter has, subsequently, been  condemned by the ''European Court of Human Rights'' (ECHR) for human rights violations in Cyprus.

'''Mahamaya irrigation project''' ({{lang-bn|মহামায়া সেচ প্রকল্প}}) is an irrigation project in [[Bangladesh]] situated at Durgapur Union, [[Mirsharai Upazila]], [[Chittagong]]. Initiated in the 2007-2008 financial year, the project provides irrigation water to a 3360 hectare area. It cost about 230 million [[taka]] and construction was completed in 2009. This project was inaugurated by Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]] on 29 December 2010.&lt;ref name=kk-1&gt;{{cite news |script-title=মিরসরাই মহামায়া প্রকল্প |trans-title=Mahamaya irrigation project |url=http://www.kalerkantho.com/print_edition/print_news.php?pub_no=1202&amp;cat_id=1&amp;menu_id=118&amp;news_type_id=1&amp;index=2 |language=bn |newspaper=Kaler Kantho |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the second largest man made lake in Bangladesh after [[Kaptai Lake]].&lt;ref name=banglanews-1&gt;{{cite news |title=PM to visit Ctg Wednesday: Mohamaya irrigation project to be on |url=http://www.banglanews24.com/English/detailsnews.php?nssl=19781cfbcf60d73cb688a6c6ca5e55ff&amp;nttl=2812201011613 |newspaper=banglanews24.com |date=28 December 2010 |accessdate=30 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Robin Anthony McKenzie.jpg|thumb|Robin Anthony McKenzie]]
The '''McKenzie method''' (also '''MDT''' = '''Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy''') is a comprehensive method of care primarily used in [[physical therapy]].

[[New Zealand]] physical therapist Robin McKenzie, OBE (1931–2013)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mckenziemdt.org/robin.cfm|title=Robin Anthony McKenzie|accessdate=15 May 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130516033957/http://www.mckenziemdt.org/robin.cfm|archivedate=16 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the method in the late 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robin |last1=McKenzie |first2=Stephen |last2=May |title=Cervical and Thoracic Spine: Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy |publisher=Orthopedic Physical Therapy Products |location= |year=2006 |pages= |isbn=978-0-9583647-7-5}}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Robin A. |last1=McKenzie |first2=Stephen |last2=May |title=The lumbar spine mechanical diagnosis &amp; therapy |publisher=Spinal Publications New Zealand |location=Waikanae |year=2003 |pages= |isbn=978-0-9583647-5-1}}{{page needed|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1981 he launched the concept which he called ''Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy (MDT)'' – a system encompassing assessment (evaluation), [[diagnosis]] and [[Therapy|treatment]] for the [[Vertebral column|spine]] and [[Limb (anatomy)|extremities]].

== Terminology ==
The McKenzie method consists of two components used to treat musculoskeletal conditions: assessment and intervention. The assessment component of the McKenzie method uses repeated movements and/or sustained postures in a single direction to elicit centralisation. In spinal patients centralisation refers to a pattern of pain level response which is characterised by decreased or abolished pain symptoms, experienced sequentially, first to the left and right of the spine (distal symptoms), and ultimately abolished pain symptoms in the spine altogether.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=May|first=Stephen|last2=Donelson|first2=Ronald|year=2008|title=Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with the McKenzie method|url=|journal=The Spine Journal|volume=8|pages=134–141|via=Elsevior}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assessment portion attempts to discover “directional preference”, which identifies the pattern of lumbosacral movement in a single direction that effectively results in centralisation and subsequent abolishment of pain symptoms in the spine and the return of proper range of motion.&lt;ref&gt;Kilpikoski S, Airaksinen O, Kankaanpaa M, Leminen P, Videman T, Alen M. Interexaminer reliability of low back pain assessment using the McKenzie method. Spine 2002;27:E207–14&lt;/ref&gt;

The intervention component of the McKenzie method is the corresponding repeated and/or sustained flexion and extension movements as prescribed by the assessment component.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==
‘‘Everything I know I learnt from my patients. I did not set out to develop a McKenzie method. It evolved spontaneously over time as a result of clinical observation’’ - Doctor Robin McKenzie.&lt;ref&gt;Clare HA, Adams R, Maher CG. Reliability of McKenzie classification of patients with cervical or lumbar pain. J Manipulative Physiol Ther 2005;28:122–7&lt;/ref&gt;

The McKenzie method has its roots in a single event in 1956 that led to increased experimentation of certain movement in order to elicit what is now known as the centralisation phenomenon. A patient who was experiencing pain on the right side of his lower back buttock, laid down on doctor McKenzie's treatment table. The patient ended up lying in significant lumbar extension for around five minutes, meaning his back was bending backwards because the head of the table had been raised for a previous patient. After ceasing this sustained position in lumbar extension the patient noted the pain on the right side of his body had experienced surprising and significant improvement.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Treat Your Own Back|last=McKenzie|first=Robin|publisher=Spinal Publications New Zealand Ltd|year=2011|isbn=978-0-9876504-0-5|location=|pages=x–xi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This led McKenzie to continuously experiment with specific movement and movement patterns to treat chronic lower back pain and bring about centralisation of pain symptoms. Over the years of experimentation in Robin McKenzie’s career, he noted patterns of symptom relief in response to prescribed spinal movements and positions and developed a classification system to categorise spinal pain problems. McKenzie went on to write and publish books so people could manage and treat their own back pain, such as “Treat Your Own Back” first published in 1980, with the latest edition being published in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie RA.

== Description ==
The McKenzie Method also referred to as Mechanical Diagnosis and Therapy is a method of assessing and treating spinal back pain and related extremity pain most commonly  through the use of specific repeated movements and appropriate prevention measures. The method puts an emphasis on self-care after initial clinical visits. There are four major steps when it comes to proper McKenzie method therapy: assessment, classification, treatment, and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckenzieinstituteusa.org/method-patients.cfm|title=For Patients - The McKenzie Institute, USA|website=www.mckenzieinstituteusa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assessment or evaluation procedure determines the type of movements that result in centralisation and reduction in pain.

MDT uses primarily self treatment strategies, and minimises [[manual therapy]] procedures, with the McKenzie trained therapist supporting the patient with passive procedures only if an individual self treatment program is not fully effective.

McKenzie states that self treatment is the best way to achieve a lasting improvement of [[back pain]] and [[neck pain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Spratt|first2=KF|last3=Donelson|first3=RG|last4=Mayer|first4=J|last5=Graves|first5=JE|last6=Tillotson|first6=J|year=2004|title=Can a patient educational book change behavior and reduce pain in chronic low back pain patients?|journal=The Spine Journal|volume=4|issue=4|pages=425–35|doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2004.01.016|pmid=15246305|last1=Udermann|first1=B}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Donelson|first2=R|year=2008|title=Evidence-informed management of chronic low back pain with the McKenzie method|journal=The Spine Journal|volume=8|issue=1|pages=134–41|doi=10.1016/j.spinee.2007.10.017|pmid=18164461|last1=May|first1=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Gardiner|first2=E|last3=Young|first3=S|last4=Klaber-Moffett|first4=J|year=2008|title=Predictor Variables for a Positive Long-Term Outcome in Patients with Acute and Chronic Neck and Back Pain Treated with a McKenzie Approach: A Secondary Analysis|journal=The Journal of manual &amp; manipulative therapy|volume=16|issue=3|pages=155–60|doi=10.1179/jmt.2008.16.3.155|pmc=2582422|pmid=19119405|last1=May|first1=S}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Centralisation ===
Centralisation plays an enormous role to treating patients with lower back pain with the McKenzie method.

Centralisation occurs when Pain symptoms off-centred from the mid-line of the spine, often diagnosed as sciatica, migrate towards the centre of the mid-line of the spine. This migration of pain symptoms to the centre of the lower back is a sign of progress in the McKenzie method. A patient has found their directional preference once they discover which repeated end-range exercise movements elicit centralisation of pain symptoms. The most common directional preference that result in centralisation is extension of the back. In many cases extension exercises are commonly referred to as McKenzie exercises for this very reason.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

According to the McKenzie method, movements and exercises that produce centralisation are very beneficial whereas movements that create pain that wander from the spinal mid-line are extremely detrimental to a patients specific condition. A 2012 systematic review found that lumbar centralisation was associated with a better recovery prognosis in terms of pain, short- and long-term disability, and the likelihood of undergoing surgery in the following year&lt;ref&gt;May, S; Aina, A (2012). "Centralization and directional preference: A systematic review".&amp;nbsp;''Manual Therapy''.&amp;nbsp;'''17'''&amp;nbsp;(6): 497–506. {{doi|10.1016/j.math.2012.05.003}}. {{PMID|22695365}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Assessment ===
The first step is understanding a patients symptoms and how they behave. Such as where patient feels pain and when, how often in a day, to what degree, and in what specific movements or positions does pain intensify or express itself. The patient will be tested and asked by a clinician to perform specific single direction movement, both sustained and repeated. A large differentiator from other physical therapy methods of assessment is the use of repeated movements. A range of single direction movements are used in this phase of the McKenzie method, depending on how pain symptoms behave and change will allow the clinician to categorise the problem to effectively prescribe the proper movements to achieve centralisation and elimination of spinal and sciatic pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckenzieinstitute.org/patients/what-does-it-involve/#step-1|title=What does it involve?|website=The McKenzie Institute International®|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Classification ===
There are three primary classifications that result from the assessment portion of the McKenzie method's comprehensive approach; Postural syndrome, dysfunction syndrome, and derangements syndrome with a minority of patients falling into an 'other category. Each classification represents the likely underlying reason of experienced pain symptoms and symptom behaviour. The classification process is very important because it determines if the McKenzie method is an appropriate approach for specific patients and also determines which movement and protocols will most likely lead to centralisation and a cessation or reduction of pain symptoms. Each syndrome corresponds to specific mechanical procedures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckenzieinstitute.org/clinicians/mckenzie-method/#step-2|title=The McKenzie Method|website=The McKenzie Institute International®|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Treatment ===
Depending on the classification and the nature of the underlying cause of disablement, certain treatment protocols are used. Depending on classification type and directional preference, patients perform specific exercises to end-range. There will be limited mobility and the position will likely cause discomfort, but the patient repeats the exercises one after the other until centralisation occurs, pain symptoms subside, and mobility to end-range increases.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

==== Derangement Syndrome ====
The most common treatment classification. Defined by pain that is experienced due to a disturbance in the joint area resulting in diminished movement in certain directions. Depending on a patients specific directional preference as discovered in the assessment stage of the McKenzie method, patients are prescribed to use repeated movements in a single direction that cause a gradual reduction in pain and centralisation of pain symptoms. That is, symptoms of pain from the left and right of the middle-lower back become centralised to the centre of the lower back and over time result in lasting reduction of pain symptom intensity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mckenzieinstitute.org/clinicians/mckenzie-method/#step-3|title=The McKenzie Method|website=The McKenzie Institute International®|language=en-US|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dysfunction Syndrome ====
This type of pain is categorised by mechanical impairments and deformities of impaired tissue within the body such as scar tissue or shortened tissues. To treat this treatment classification the goal is to remodel the impaired tissue by mobilisation exercise

==== Postural Syndrome ====
This type of pain is the result of postural deformation. Static holds of improper end-range positions, such as slouching are the cause of postural syndrome. Treatment is more geared towards education and proper posture training rather than repeated exercises as the other syndrome classifications prescribe.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physio-pedia.com/Mckenzie_Method|title=Mckenzie Method - Physiopedia, universal access to physiotherapy knowledge.|website=www.physio-pedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention ===
The last portion of treatment is designed to educate patients to ensure proper continuation of appropriate exercises and correct structural positionings day-to-day. Self-care and proper exercise is stressed and encouraged as prevention methods.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

== Medical Literature Concerning Efficacy of Treatment ==
According to a [[meta-analysis]] of clinical trials in 2006, treatment using the McKenzie method is somewhat effective for acute low back pain, but the evidence suggests that it is not effective for chronic low-back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=De Souza|first2=Marcelo von Sperling|last3=Ferreira|first3=Paulo Henrique|last4=Ferreira|first4=Manuela Loureiro|year=2006|title=The McKenzie Method for Low Back Pain|journal=Spine|volume=31|issue=9|pages=E254–62|doi=10.1097/01.brs.0000214884.18502.93|pmid=16641766|last1=MacHado|first1=Luciana Andrade Carneiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 systematic review agreed with this, finding that centralisation occurred more frequently in acute patients (74%) compared to subacute (50%) and chronic (40%).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Aina|first2=A|year=2012|title=Centralization and directional preference: A systematic review|journal=Manual Therapy|volume=17|issue=6|pages=497–506|doi=10.1016/j.math.2012.05.003|pmid=22695365|last1=May|first1=S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, centralisation was found to be more common in younger patients. Cervical centralisation was observed in only 37% of patients.

There have also been other reviews of the literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Adams|first2=R|last3=Maher|first3=CG|year=2004|title=A systematic review of efficacy of McKenzie therapy for spinal pain|journal=The Australian journal of physiotherapy|volume=50|issue=4|pages=209–16|doi=10.1016/s0004-9514(14)60110-0|pmid=15574109|last1=Clare|first1=HA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Dankaerts|first2=W|last3=O'Sullivan|first3=PB|last4=Maes|first4=J.|last5=Skouen|first5=J.

A 2006 systematic review into the clinical evidence of the McKenzie method's ability to treat spinal pain concluded that the McKenzie method decreased short-term (&lt;3 months) to a higher degree than other standard treatments including: "nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, educational booklet, back massage with back care advice, strength training with therapist supervision, and spinal mobilization".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Busanich, B. M., &amp; Verscheure, S. D. (2006). Does McKenzie Therapy Improve Outcomes for Back Pain?&amp;nbsp;''Journal of Athletic Training'',&amp;nbsp;''41''(1), 117–119.&lt;/ref&gt; At the intermediate term follow-up there was no statistical differences among therapies.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A report published in 2008 noted only marginal benefits over an assessment and advice-only group at the short-term follow up mark, 6 month, and 1 year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Paatelma|first=M|last2=Kilpikoski|first2=S|last3=Simonen|first3=R|last4=Heinonen|first4=A|last5=Alen|first5=M|last6=Videman|first6=T|title=Orthopaedic manual therapy, McKenzie method or advice only for low back pain in working adults: A randomized controlled trial with one year follow-up|url=https://medicaljournals.se/jrm/content/abstract/10.2340/16501977-0262|journal=Journal of Rehabilitation Medicine|volume=40|issue=10|pages=858–863|doi=10.2340/16501977-0262|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2010 study concluded that the McKenzie method "does not produce appreciable additional short-term improvements in pain, disability, function or global perceived effect".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Machado|first=Luciana AC|last2=Maher|first2=Chris G.|last3=Herbert|first3=Rob D.|last4=Clare|first4=Helen|last5=McAuley|first5=James H.|date=2010-01-01|title=The effectiveness of the McKenzie method in addition to first-line care for acute low back pain: a randomized controlled trial|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1186/1741-7015-8-10|journal=BMC Medicine|volume=8|pages=10|doi=10.1186/1741-7015-8-10|issn=1741-7015|pmc=2842230|pmid=20102596}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2006 systematic review of the literature assessed whether or not the McKenzie method treated Lower back pain more effectively than passive therapy, advice to stay active, flexion exercises, and others. The assessment concluded that there were no clinically significant benefits compared with the passive therapy and advice to stay active in those with acute lower back pain&lt;ref&gt;Carneiro Machado L A, von Sperling de Souza M, Ferreira P H, Ferreira M L.

The '''National Lung Screening Trial''' was a United States-based [[clinical trial]] which recruited [[research participants]] between 2002-2004.&lt;ref name="clinicaltrials.gov entry"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://clinicaltrials.gov/show/NCT00047385%20entry%20at%20ClinicalTrials.gov |title=National Lung Screening Trial (NLST) Screening - Full Text View - ClinicalTrials.gov |author=National Cancer Institute |authorlink=National Cancer Institute |work=clinicaltrials.gov |year=2014 |accessdate=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by the [[National Cancer Institute]] and conducted by the [[American College of Radiology]] Imaging Network and the Lung Screening Study Group.&lt;ref name="clinicaltrials.gov entry"/&gt; The major objective of the trial was to compare the efficacy of low-dose helical [[computed tomography]] (CT screening) and standard [[chest X-ray]] as methods of [[lung cancer screening]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cancer.gov/clinicaltrials/noteworthy-trials/nlst National Lung Screening Trial]&lt;/ref&gt;  The primary study ended in 2010, and the initial findings were published in November 2010, with the main results published in 2011 in the ''[[New England Journal of Medicine]]''.

The trial led to a recommendation in the United States in 2013 that CT screening be used on people at high risk for developing lung cancer in an effort to detect the cancer earlier and reduce mortality.&lt;ref name=Ab2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Aberle|first1=D.

Screening should be discontinued once a person has not smoked for 15 years or develops a health problem that substantially limits life expectancy or the ability or willingness to have curative lung surgery".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uspreventiveservicestaskforce.org/uspstf/uspslung.htm |title=Lung Cancer Screening |year=2013 |publisher=[[United States Preventive Services Task Force|U.S. Preventative Services Task Force]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaths in either group were then logged for up to five years.&lt;ref name=WSJresults /&gt; As of October 2010, 354 people in the CT scan group had died from lung cancer, versus 442 people in the X-ray group; in other words, deaths in the CT scan group of patients were 20.3% lower than in the X-ray group.&lt;ref name=WSJresults&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/BT-CO-20101104-717833.html UPDATE: US Lung Cancer Screening Study Shows Benefit With CT Vs. X-Ray], by Jennifer Corbett Dooren. Published in the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' on November 4, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The study's review board concluded that this difference was [[statistical significance|statistically significant]] and recommended terminating the study.&lt;ref name=WSJresults /&gt; The director of the National Cancer Institute's director, Harold Varmus, said that early analysis results appeared to indicate that CT scans detected more lung cancers, at an earlier and more treatable stage, and that CT scans could therefore reduce the number of deaths in patients at high risk of lung cancer.&lt;ref name=WSJresults /&gt;

The practice focuses on promotion, maintenance and restoration of health, prevention of illness and injury, and protection from work‐related and environmental hazards. Occupational health nurses (OHNs) aim to combine knowledge of health and business to balance safe and healthful work environments and a "healthy" bottom line.&lt;ref&gt;American Association of Occupational Health Nurses.

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
The disease is caused by bacteria that spread from the vagina and cervix.&lt;ref name="NEJM PID Review 2015" /&gt; Infections by ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' or ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' are present in 75 to 90 percent of cases.&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt; Often multiple different bacteria are involved.&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt; Without treatment about 10 percent of those with a [[chlamydial infection]] and 40 percent of those with a [[gonorrhea infection]] will develop PID.&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=WHO2012&gt;{{cite web |author1=World Health Organization |title=Global incidence and prevalence of selected curable sexually transmitted infections - 2008 |url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75181/1/9789241503839_eng.pdf |website=who.int |accessdate=February 22, 2015 |pages=2, 19 |date=2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319011717/http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/75181/1/9789241503839_eng.pdf |archivedate=March 19, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Risk factors are similar to those of [[sexually transmitted infection]]s generally and include a [[promiscuity|high number of sexual partners]] and [[Substance abuse|drug use]].&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt; [[Vaginal douching]] may also increase the risk.&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt; The diagnosis is typically based on the presenting signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt; It is recommended that the disease be considered in all women of childbearing age who have lower abdominal pain.&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt; A definitive diagnosis of PID is made by finding [[pus]] involving the fallopian tubes during [[laproscopic surgery|surgery]].&lt;ref name=Mit2013/&gt; [[Ultrasound]] may also be useful in diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Mit2013 /&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention and treatment --&gt;
Efforts to prevent the disease include [[abstinence|not having sex]] or having few sexual partners and using [[condom]]s.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Pre&gt;{{cite web |title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Patient Counseling and Education |url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/stdtraining/self-study/pid/pid_patient_counseling_self_study_from_cdc.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |accessdate=February 21, 2015 |date=October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222021120/http://www2a.cdc.gov/stdtraining/self-study/pid/pid_patient_counseling_self_study_from_cdc.html |archivedate=February 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Screening women at risk for chlamydial infection followed by treatment decreases the risk of PID.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Pub /&gt; If the diagnosis is suspected, treatment is typically advised.&lt;ref name=Mit2013 /&gt; Treating a woman's sexual partners should also occur.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Pub&gt;{{cite web |title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease (PID) Partner Management and Public Health Measures |url=http://www2a.cdc.gov/stdtraining/self-study/pid/pid_partner_management_self_study_from_cdc.html |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |accessdate=February 21, 2015 |date=October 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222021754/http://www2a.cdc.gov/stdtraining/self-study/pid/pid_partner_management_self_study_from_cdc.html |archivedate=February 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In those with mild or moderate symptoms a single injection of the [[antibiotic]] [[ceftriaxone]] along with two weeks of [[doxycycline]] and possibly [[metronidazole]] by mouth is recommended.&lt;ref name=CDC2010Tx/&gt; For those who do not improve after three days or who have severe disease intravenous antibiotics should be used.&lt;ref name=CDC2010Tx&gt;{{cite web |title=2010 STD Treatment Guidelines Pelvic Inflammatory Disease |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/pid.htm |publisher=Centers for Disease Control |accessdate=February 22, 2015 |date=August 15, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150222002803/http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/pid.htm |archivedate=February 22, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Epidemiology and history --&gt;

Other complications include [[endometritis]], [[salpingitis]], [[tubo-ovarian abscess]], pelvic [[peritonitis]], periappendicitis, and [[perihepatitis]].&lt;ref name=Sternak2014/&gt;

== Cause ==
''Chlamydia trachomatis'' and ''Neisseria gonorrhoeae'' are usually the main cause of PID. Data suggest that PID is often polymicrobial.&lt;ref name=Sternak2014/&gt; Isolated [[anaerobes]] and [[Facultative anaerobic organism|facultative microorganisms]] have been obtained from the upper genital tract. ''N. gonorrhoeae'' has been isolated from fallopian tubes, facultative and anaerobic organisms were recovered from endometrial tissues.&lt;ref name=Sharma2014&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sharma H, Tal R, Clark NA, Segars JH |title=Microbiota and pelvic inflammatory disease |journal=Seminars in Reproductive Medicine |volume=32 |issue=1 |pages=43–9 |year=2014 |pmid=24390920 |pmc=4148456 |doi=10.1055/s-0033-1361822 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LisRowhani-Rahbar2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lis |first1=R. |last2=Rowhani-Rahbar |first2=A. |last3=Manhart |first3=L. E. |title=Mycoplasma genitalium Infection and Female Reproductive Tract Disease: A Meta-Analysis |journal=Clinical Infectious Diseases |year=2015 |issn=1058-4838 |doi=10.1093/cid/civ312|pmid=25900174 |volume=61 |pages=418–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anatomical structure of the internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the [[infundibulum of uterine tube|infundibulum]]. The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal [[microbiota]] associated with [[bacterial vaginosis]] increases the risk of PID.&lt;ref name=Sharma2014/&gt;

''N. gonorrhoea'' and ''C. trachomati''s are the most common organisms. The least common were infections caused exclusively by anaerobes and facultative organisms. Anaerobes and facultative bacteria were also isolated from 50 percent of the patients from whom ''Chlamydia'' and ''Neisseria'' were recovered; thus, anaerobes and facultative bacteria were present in the upper genital tract of nearly two-thirds of the PID patients.&lt;ref name=Sharma2014/&gt; PCR and serological tests have associated extremely fastidious organism with endometritis, PID, and [[tubal factor infertility]]. &lt;!-- In a Kenyan study, PCR was used to identify new, uncultivable bacteria found with cases of salpingitis. Bacteria in fallopian tubes, correlated with laparoscopic diagnosis of acute salpingitis. Phylotypes identified as Leptotrichia spp. were found as the only type in one specimen but were mixed with other bacterial phylotypes in two specimens. --&gt; Microorganisms associated with PID are listed below.&lt;ref name=Sharma2014/&gt;

Rarely cases of PID have developed in people who have stated they have never had sex.&lt;ref name="ChoKoo2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cho|first1=Hyun-Woong|last2=Koo|first2=Yu-Jin|last3=Min|first3=Kyung-Jin|last4=Hong|first4=Jin-Hwa|last5=Lee|first5=Jae-Kwan|title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease in Virgin Women with Tubo-ovarian Abscess: A Single-center Experience and Literature Review|journal=Journal of Pediatric and Adolescent Gynecology|year=2015|issn=1083-3188|doi=10.1016/j.jpag.2015.08.001|volume=30|pages=203–208}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon a [[pelvic examination]], [[cervical motion tenderness|cervical motion]], [[uterine]], or adnexal tenderness will be experienced.&lt;ref name="NEJM PID Review 2015" /&gt;  Mucopurulent [[cervicitis]] and or [[urethritis]] may be observed. In severe cases more testing may be required such as [[laparoscopy]], intra-abdominal bacteria sampling and culturing, or tissue biopsy.&lt;ref name=Sternak2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=SMoore&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moore MD |first1=Suzanne |editor1-last=Rivlin MD |editor1-first=Michel |title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256448-overview |website=Medscape, Drugs and Diseases, Background |publisher=Medscape |date=Mar 27, 2014 |accessdate=March 31, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150325205543/http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/256448-overview |archivedate=March 25, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laparoscopy can visualize "violin-string" [[adhesion]]s, characteristic of [[Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome|Fitz-Hugh–Curtis perihepatitis]] and other abscesses that may be present.&lt;ref name=SMoore /&gt;

Other imaging methods, such as ultrasonography, computed tomography (CT), and magnetic imaging (MRI), can aid in diagnosis.&lt;ref name=SMoore /&gt; Blood tests can also help identify the presence of infection: the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR), the C-reactive protein (CRP) level, and chlamydial and gonococcal DNA probes.&lt;ref name=Sternak2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SMoore /&gt;

Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) are highly sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies is not as useful since the presence of the microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an infection is recent or long-term.&lt;ref name=Sternak2014 /&gt;

Definitive criteria include [[histopathologic]] evidence of endometritis, thickened filled [[Fallopian tubes]], or [[laparoscopic]] findings. [[Gram stain]]/smear becomes definitive in the identification of rare, atypical and possibly more serious organisms.&lt;ref name="isbn0-7216-8179-4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Andreoli |first1=Thomas E. |last2=Cecil |first2=Russell L. |title=Cecil Essentials Of Medicine |publisher=W. B. Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2001 |edition=5th |isbn=9780721681795}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two thirds of patients with laparoscopic evidence of previous PID were not aware they had PID, but even asymptomatic PID can cause serious harm.

Laparoscopic identification is helpful in diagnosing tubal disease; a 65 percent to 90 percent [[positive predictive value]] exists in patients with presumed PID.&lt;ref name="isbn0-8385-1401-4"&gt;{{cite book |first2=Lauren |last2=Nathan |last1=DeCherney |first1=Alan H. |title=Current Obstetric &amp; Gynecologic Diagnosis &amp; Treatment |publisher=Lange Medical Books/McGraw-Hill |location=New York |year=2003 |isbn=9780838514016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon [[gynecologic ultrasound]], a potential finding is ''tubo-ovarian complex'', which is [[edema]]tous and dilated pelvic structures as evidenced by vague margins, but without [[abscess]] formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wasco |first1=Emily |last2=Lieberman |first2=Gillian |url=http://eradiology.bidmc.harvard.edu/LearningLab/genito/Wasco.pdf |title=Tuboovarian complex |publisher=Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center |date=October 17, 2003 |accessdate=July 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304083602/http://eradiology.bidmc.harvard.edu/LearningLab/genito/Wasco.pdf |archivedate=March 4, 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===

A number of other causes may produce similar symptoms including appendicitis, ectopic pregnancy, hemorrhagic or ruptured [[ovarian cysts]], [[ovarian torsion]], and endometriosis and [[gastroenteritis]], peritonitis, and bacterial vaginosis among others.&lt;ref name=Mit2013 /&gt;

Pelvic inflammatory disease is more likely to reoccur when there is a prior history of the infection, recent sexual contact, recent onset of [[menses]], or an [[IUD]] (intrauterine device) in place or if the partner has a [[sexually transmitted infection]].&lt;ref name=CDCPID2010&gt;{{cite web |title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease |publisher=CDC Fact Sheet |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/pid/stdfact-pid.htm |date=May 4, 2015 |accessdate=July 15, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715211211/http://www.cdc.gov/std/PID/STDFact-PID.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Acute pelvic inflammatory disease is highly unlikely when recent intercourse has not taken place or an IUD is not being used. A sensitive serum [[pregnancy test]] is typically obtained to rule out ectopic pregnancy. [[Culdocentesis]] will differentiate [[hemoperitoneum]] (ruptured ectopic pregnancy or [[hemorrhagic cyst]]) from pelvic [[sepsis]] (salpingitis, ruptured pelvic abscess, or ruptured appendix).&lt;ref name="Hoffman42" /&gt;

Pelvic and vaginal ultrasounds are helpful in the diagnosis of PID. In the early stages of infection, the ultrasound may appear normal. As the disease progresses, nonspecific findings can include free pelvic fluid, endometrial thickening, uterine cavity distension by fluid or gas. In some instances the borders of the uterus and ovaries appear indistinct. Enlarged ovaries accompanied by increased numbers of small cysts correlates with PID.&lt;ref name="Hoffman42"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hoffman |first=Barbara |title=Williams gynecology |edition=2nd |publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical |page=42 |location=New York |year=2012 |isbn=9780071716727}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laparoscopy is infrequently used to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease since it is not readily available.  Moreover, it might not detect subtle inflammation of the fallopian tubes, and it fails to detect endometritis.&lt;ref name=CDC2010&gt;{{cite web |title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease, 2010 STD Treatment Guidelines |publisher=CDC |url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/pid.htm |date=January 28, 2011 |accessdate=July 14, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150715122458/http://www.cdc.gov/std/treatment/2010/pid.htm |archivedate=July 15, 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, laparoscopy is conducted if the diagnosis is not certain or if the person has not responded to antibiotic therapy after 48 hours.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

No single test has adequate [[Sensitivity (tests)|sensitivity]] and [[Specificity (tests)|specificity]] to diagnose pelvic inflammatory disease. A large multisite U.S. study found that cervical motion tenderness as a minimum clinical criterion increases the sensitivity of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] diagnostic criteria from 83 percent to 95 percent. However, even the modified 2002 CDC criteria do not identify women with subclinical disease.&lt;ref name="pmid17343812"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blenning |first1=CE |last2=Muench |first2=J |last3=Judkins |first3=DZ |last4=Roberts |first4=KT |title=Clinical inquiries.

== Prevention ==

Regular testing for [[sexually transmitted infections]] is encouraged for prevention.&lt;ref name="pmid17888100"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=KJ |last2=Cook |first2=RL |last3=Roberts |first3=MS |title=Time from sexually transmitted infection acquisition to pelvic inflammatory disease development: influence on the cost-effectiveness of different screening intervals |journal=Value Health |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=358–66 |year=2007 |pmid=17888100 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4733.2007.00189.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; The risk of contracting pelvic inflammatory disease can be reduced by the following:

* Using [[barrier methods]] such as [[condoms]]; see [[Human sexual activity#Health and safety|human sexual behavior]] for other listings.&lt;ref name="Prevention" /&gt;
* Seeking medical attention if you are experiencing symptoms of PID.&lt;ref name="Prevention" /&gt;
* Using hormonal combined contraceptive pills also helps in reducing the chances of PID by thickening the cervical mucosal plug &amp; hence preventing the ascent of causative organisms from the lower genital tract.&lt;ref name="Prevention" /&gt;
* Seeking medical attention after learning that a current or former sex partner has, or might have had a sexually transmitted infection.&lt;ref name="Prevention" /&gt;
* Getting a STI history from your current partner and strongly encouraging they be tested and treated before intercourse.&lt;ref name="Prevention" /&gt;
* Diligence in avoiding vaginal activity, particularly intercourse, after the end of a pregnancy (delivery, [[Spontaneous abortion|miscarriage]], or [[abortion]]) or certain gynecological procedures, to ensure that the cervix closes.&lt;ref name="Prevention" /&gt;
* Reducing the number of sexual partners.&lt;ref name=CDCPID2010/&gt;

== Treatment ==

Treatment is often started without confirmation of infection because of the serious complications that may result from delayed treatment. Treatment depends on the [[infectious agent]] and generally involves the use of [[antibiotic]] therapy although there is no clear evidence of which antibiotic regimen is more effective and safe in the management of PID.&lt;ref name="PID Antibiotic 2017" /&gt; If there is no improvement within two to three days, the patient is typically advised to seek further medical attention. Hospitalization sometimes becomes necessary if there are other complications.  Treating sexual partners for possible STIs can help in treatment and prevention.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Pub/&gt;

For women with PID of mild to moderate severity, parenteral and oral therapies appear to be effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ness |first1=RB |last2=Hillier |first2=SL |last3=Kip |first3=KE |title= Bacterial vaginosis and risk of pelvic inflammatory disease |journal=Obstet Gynecol |year=2004 |volume=4| issue = Supp 3 |pages=S111–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Smith |first1=KJ |last2=Ness |first2=RB |last3=Wiesenfeld |first3=HC |title=Cost-effectiveness of alternative outpatient pelvic inflammatory disease treatment strategies |journal=Sex Transm Dis |year=2007 |volume=34 |pages=960–6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It does not matter to their short- or long-term outcome whether antibiotics are administered to them as inpatients or outpatients.&lt;ref name=Walker2007&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walker |first1=CK |last2= Wiesenfeld |first2=HC |title=Antibiotic therapy for acute pelvic inflammatory disease: the 2006 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention sexually transmitted diseases treatment guidelines |journal=Clin.

== Prognosis ==
Even when the PID infection is cured, effects of the infection may be permanent. This makes early identification essential. Treatment resulting in cure is very important in the prevention of damage to the [[reproductive system]].  Formation of scar tissue due to one or more episodes of PID can lead to tubal blockage, increasing the risk of the inability to get pregnant and long-term pelvic/abdominal pain.&lt;ref&gt;

=== Complications ===

PID can cause [[scarring]] inside the reproductive system, which can later cause serious complications, including chronic pelvic pain, [[infertility]], ectopic pregnancy (the leading cause of pregnancy-related deaths in adult females), and other complications of pregnancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/std/PID/STDFact-PID.htm|title=Pelvic Inflammatory Disease - CDC Fact Sheet|date=2017-10-04|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, the infection can spread to the [[peritoneum]] causing inflammation and the formation of scar tissue on the external surface of the [[liver]] (Fitz-Hugh–Curtis syndrome).&lt;ref&gt;

==Epidemiology==
Globally about 106 million cases of chlamydia and 106 million cases of gonorrhea occurred in 2008.&lt;ref name=WHO2012 /&gt; The number of cases of PID; however, is not clear.&lt;ref name=Esch2008 /&gt; It is estimated to affect about 1.5 percent of young women yearly.&lt;ref name=Esch2008 /&gt; In the United States PID is estimated to affect about one million people yearly.&lt;ref name=CDC2014Epi /&gt; Rates are highest with teenagers and first time mothers.

Originated in 1969 by staff nurses at the [[University of Minnesota]], '''Primary Nursing''' is a system of [[nursing]] care delivery which emphasizes continuity of care and responsibility acceptance by having one [[registered nurse]] (RN), often teamed with a [[licensed practical nurse]] (LPN) and/or [[nursing assistant]] (NA), who together provide complete care for a group of patients throughout their stay in a hospital unit or department.&lt;ref&gt;http://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/primary+nursing&lt;/ref&gt; For the duration of a patient’s episode of care, the primary nurse accepts responsibility for administering some and coordinating all aspects of the patient’s nursing care. When RNs supervise LPNs and NAs in the care of patients, costs associated with labor and other resources typically decrease while more attentive, well-coordinated care is provided for patients, increasing patient satisfaction and safety.

This is distinguished from the practice of [[team nursing]], functional nursing, or total patient care, in that primary nursing focuses on the therapeutic relationship between a patient and a named nurse who assumes responsibility for a patient’s plan of care for their length of stay in a particular area.

[[Marie Manthey]], one of the originators of this care delivery system and the author of ''The Practice of Primary Nursing'' (2002), asserts that a nursing system can enhance and facilitate either professional or bureaucratic values as it either focuses on caring for people or tending to the needs of an organization. From ''The Practice of Primary Nursing'', “Primary Nursing is a delivery system for nursing at the station level that facilitates professional nursing practice despite the bureaucratic nature of hospitals. The practice of any profession is based on an independent assessment of a client’s needs which determines the kind and amount of service to be rendered: services in bureaucracies are usually delivered according to routine pre-established procedures without sensitivity to variations in needs.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Manthey|first=Marie|title=The Practice of Primary Nursing|year=2002|publisher=Creative Health Care Management|location=Minneapolis, MN|isbn=9781886624177|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A delivery system is a set of organizing principles that is used to deliver a product or service and generally consist of four elements: decision-making, work allocation, communication, and management.The following table illustrates the similarities and differences between the four most common nursing care delivery systems:&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Element !! Functional nursing !! Team nursing !! Total patient care !! Primary nursing
|-
| Decision-making || Decision-making occurs over a single shift; decisions usually made by nurse manager or charge nurse.|| Decision-making occurs over a single shift; largely by team leader or nurse manager. || Decision-making occurs over a single shift—either by an RN caring for the patient or by a charge nurse. || RN makes decisions for individual patients based on their therapeutic relationship, which is sustained for the length of stay of the patient on the unit.
|-
| Work allocation and/or patient assignment || Nursing assignments are task-based, nurses are assigned to tasks rather than patients. || Nursing assignments are based on level of complexity and commensurate level of expertise; focus is on tasks to be accomplished; assignments change based on patient acuity and work complexity.  || Nursing assignments are largely patient-based, with RN providing activities of care. Nursing assignments may vary by shift based on geography and patient acuity, without supporting continuity of care. || Nurse assignments are patient-based to ensure continuity of care. An RN is assigned to a patient and remains that patient’s primary nurse for as long as the patient remains on the unit (unless circumstances require that a new primary nurse is assigned).
|-
| Communication  || Communication is hierarchical; task completion is documented and communicated to the charge nurse; the charge nurse pulls information together for all patients and communicates with other members of the health care team. || Communication is hierarchical; the care provider reports to the team leader; the team leader reports to physicians and/or other health care team members. || Communication is direct. However, in some Total Patient Care systems, RNs may be required to communicate with physicians and other members of the health care team through a charge nurse. || Communication is direct. Patient information is solicited by the primary nurse who communicates directly and proactively with team members, physicians, and other colleagues. The primary nurse is responsible for integrating information and coordinating care.
|-
| Management of the unit or environment of care  || Managers function as overseers, assuring that tasks are accomplished. || Nurse manager supervises the team leader who is responsible for supervising other staff in the delivery of care. || Managers serve as a resource and promote nurses having a stronger role in care decisions. || Managers promote the nurse-patient relationship and the professional role of the nurse. They influence care by creating a healthy work environment and empowering the staff to remove barriers to care.

Licensed practical nurses, nursing assistants, and other team members play vital roles in meeting the needs of the patient and his or her family. 
|-
| The primary nurse does all of the bedside care. || The essence of the primary nurse’s role is the acceptance of responsibility, authority, and accountability for decisions about patient care. It is not about the primary nurse “doing it all.”
It is simply not practical for the primary nurse to complete all aspects of care. Obvious barriers to singular care by a primary nurse include shortened length of patient stay; escalating patient acuity levels; complex, multifaceted care requirements, and the cyclical nursing shortage. If the primary nurse were doing all of the bedside care, he or she would not be able to assume responsibility for planning and coordinating the patient’s care. 
|-
| Primary nursing eliminates teamwork. Everyone works individually and therefore is not aware of patients other than their own. In a primary nursing model, care providers do not help each other. || Teamwork is critical to the primary nursing care delivery system. It has been demonstrated that the best utilization of ancillary staff is in relationship with one RN—(at least within a given shift)—not assigned to help many. However, a general culture of “helpfulness” based on a shared commitment to all patients and team members is necessary to achieve consistently safe, quality care.
Primary nursing supports collaborative interdisciplinary practice through communication and coordination.
|-
| Complex scheduling requirements prohibit continuity of the nurse-patient relationship central to the primary nurse model. || Clinical staff report a 25% reduction in work redundancy due to day-to-day continuity of care. They also report a perceived increase in productivity through more consistent co-worker assignments. The key to achieving these results is to find creative methods to schedule nurses with continuity of care as the priority. For example, if a patient’s anticipated length of stay is three days, schedule nurses three consecutive days.

==History==

Marie Manthey tells this story about the origins of primary nursing in the book ''Relationship-Based Care: A Model for Transforming Practice'':

“Primary Nursing was implemented in 1969 on Unit 32 at the University of Minnesota Hospital. This radical change in care delivery came about when a colleague, Pat Robertson (nursing supervisor) and I (assistant director of nursing) held an evening meeting with nursing staff and leaders at [my] home. This was an unprecedented and radical action—to invite staff nurses and leaders to come together to figure out how to improve patient care and the work environment itself. The nurses told stories about attempts to implement [care delivery systems like] Primary Nursing elsewhere in the United States, and we discussed how it could happen in our organization. Our message to the staff that night was that they have the ability to influence their own practice and how it will look—and step one was that it was okay for them to make patient assignments.” (p.&amp;nbsp;170)

The first seminar presenting primary nursing to the nursing community took place in 1970, and the first article, "Primary nursing: a return to the concept of 'my nurse' and 'my patient',” co-authored by Marie Manthey, Karen Ciske, Patricia Robertson, and Isabel Harris was published in January 1970 in the journal ''Nursing Forum''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manthey|first=Marie|author2=Ciske, K. |author3=Robertson, P. |author4=Harris, I. |title=Primary nursing: A return to the concept of "my nurse" and "my patient|journal=Nursing Forum|year=1970|volume=9|issue=1|pages=65–84|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6198.1970.tb00442.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second article, "A Dialogue on Primary Nursing," written by Marie Manthey and Marlene Kramer, was published in the journal ''Nursing Forum'' in October 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Manthey|first=Marie|author2=Marlene Kramer|title=A dialogue on primary nursing|journal=Nursing Forum|year=1970|volume=9|issue=4|pages=356–379|doi=10.1111/j.1744-6198.1970.tb01048.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout the 1970s, interest and development were steady, but never well-organized; however, several hospitals quickly realized the benefits of a primary nursing care delivery system to patients and nurses. The nursing staffs at Boston Beth Israel led by Joyce Clifford and Evanston Hospital led by June Werner were early adopters of primary nursing and were recognized for their outstanding work in fully implementing this professional nursing model.

'''PROJECT C.U.R.E.''' (Commission on Urgent Relief and Equipment) is the registered trademark of the Benevolent Healthcare Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit, humanitarian relief organization based in Denver, CO. It is one of the largest nonprofit organizations in the world that delivers medical supplies and equipment to developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denverpost.com/search/ci_12059312/ The Denver Post]. James Mejia. 04 May 2009. - Cuba in Castro's shadow&lt;/ref&gt; Its main purpose is to collect and sort donated medical supplies and equipment from manufacturers, hospitals, and surpluses and then distribute the supplies and equipment to developing countries based on a needs assessment of the local hospitals and clinics in those countries.&lt;ref name="princ"&gt;[http://www.guidestar.org/pqShowGsReport.do?npoId=100051445&amp;partner=justgive/ Philanthropic Research, Inc.- PROJECT C.U.R.E. page]. Retrieved 24 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The idea of PROJECT C.U.R.E. was created in 1987 by the founder, James W. Jackson while working as an international economic consultant with heads of governments in developing nations. During a trip to Brazil, Jackson observed how many of the clinics in rural areas were unable to accommodate many of the patients due to the lack of medical supplies and equipment and the large number of people seeking medical attention.
When Jackson returned home to Colorado, he collected about $250,000 worth of donated, surplus medical supplies in under a month. He then personally paid for the shipping costs of the medical supplies to Brazil. Since that first shipment in 1987, PROJECT C.U.R.E. has expanded and now works in over 130 countries around the world.

==Location==
PROJECT C.U.R.E.'s headquarters is located in Centennial, CO, outside of Denver. Distribution centers are located in Centennial, CO, Phoenix, AZ, Nashville, TN, Houston, TX, and Chicago, IL.  Project C.U.R.E. maintains collection centers in Albuquerque, NM, Austin, TX, Basalt, CO, Brooklyn, NY, Grand Junction, CO, Harrisburg, PA, Ithaca, NY, Lexington, KY, Sarasota, FL, and Tampa, FL.&lt;ref name="globalmedical"&gt;[http://www.globalbrigades.org/project/medical/ Global Medical Brigades]. Retrieved 24 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Financial Accountability==
PROJECT C.U.R.E. uses the majority of its funding into the completion of its projects. 98.6% of PROJECT C.U.R.E.'s total annual spending is made up of program expenses. Administrative expenses total 0.7% of the organization's budget and fundraising expenses constitute 0.6% of total annual spending.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=9945/ Charity Navigator - PROJECT C.U.R.E. page] Retrieved 24 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
=== ProCURE ===
ProCURE is the name of the project in which PROJECT C.U.R.E. collects new and overstock medical supplies and working equipment from manufacturers, wholesale suppliers, hospitals, clinics and individuals. The goods obtained from ProCURE are then sorted and inventoried at PROJECT C.U.R.E. distribution centers before being sent to hospitals and clinics in developing counties.

===Corps===
The C.U.R.E. Corps is the volunteer member group for PROJECT C.U.R.E. made up of individuals, families, civic and church groups. Volunteer tasks include contacting hospitals and doctors for donations, collecting donations, sorting supplies, packing boxes, and loading supplies onto cargo containers to be shipped.

===Cargo===
Cargo containers for PROJECT C.U.R.E. are the size of a semi-truck trailer. Each container holds an average of $400,000 in medical supplies and equipment. On average, PROJECT C.U.R.E. delivers two cargo containers a week to developing nations.&lt;ref name="globalmedical" /&gt;

===Kits===
C.U.R.E. Kits are boxes which contain essential medical supplies and equipment to be carried as luggage on an international flight. C.U.R.E. Kits are designed to meet the needs for short-term medical missions abroad and can be shipped directly to the traveler's home.&lt;ref name="globalmedical" /&gt;

===Clinics===
C.U.R.E. Clinics prove an avenue for volunteer medical professionals to travel to developing countries where they are able to offer medical services. Location in which PROJECT C.U.R.E. Clinics have operated include: Guatemala, Kenya, Rwanda, Ghana, Bolivia, China, and Togo.

===Kits for Kids===
C.U.R.E. Kits for Kids is a program where drawstring backpacks are filled with personal hygiene and basic "medicine cabinet" items that are scarce in the third world.  Kits for Kids gives parents the supplies they need to care for their children at home.  Each bag has a tag, which allows for tracking as it makes its way across the world and into the hands of a family in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kits for Kids|url=https://projectcure.org/programs/kidskits|website=Project C.U.R.E.|publisher=HandsomeDogStudio|accessdate=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15004">'''Remote patient monitoring''' ('''RPM''') is a technology to enable monitoring of patients outside of conventional clinical settings (e.g. in the home), which may increase access to care and decrease healthcare delivery costs.

Incorporating RPM in [[chronic disease]] management can significantly improve an individual's [[quality of life]]. It allows patients to maintain independence, prevent complications, and minimize personal costs.&lt;ref name="bayliss"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bayliss | first1 = E. | last2 = Steiner | first2 = J.F. | last3 = Fernald | first3 = D.H. | last4 = Crane | first4 = L.A. | last5 = Main | first5 = D.S. | year = 2003 | title = Descriptions of barriers to self-care by persons with comorbid chronic diseases | url = | journal = Ann Fam Med | volume = 1 | issue = 1| pages = 15–21 | doi = 10.1370/afm.4 | pmc = 1466563 }}&lt;/ref&gt; RPM facilitates these goals by delivering care right to the home. In addition, patients and their family members feel comfort knowing that they are being monitored and will be supported if a problem arises. This is particularly important when patients are managing complex [[self-care]] processes such as home [[hemodialysis]].&lt;ref&gt;Cafazzo, J.A., Leonard, K., Easty, A.C., Rossos, P.G., &amp; Chan, C.T. (2009). Bridging the self-care deficit gap: remote patient monitoring and hospital at home. In Electronic Healthcare First International Conference, ''eHealth'' 2008. {{doi|10.1007/978-3-642-00413-1_8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Key features of RPM, like remote monitoring and trend analysis of physiological parameters, enable early detection of deterioration; thereby, reducing number of emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and duration of hospital stays.&lt;ref name="center"&gt;Center for Technology and Aging. (2009, December). Technologies for remote patient monitoring in older adults discussion paper. Retrieved from http://www.techandaging.org/RPMpositionpaperDraft.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
The need for wireless mobility in healthcare facilitates the adoption of RPM both in community and institutional settings. The time saved as a result of RPM implementation increases efficiency, and allows healthcare providers to allocate more time to remotely educate and communicate with patients.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = O'Donoghue | first1 = John | last2 = Herbert | first2 = John | year = 2012 | title = Data Management within mHealth Environments: Patient Sensors, Mobile Devices, and Databases | url = | journal = J.

==Technological components==

The diverse applications of RPM lead to numerous variations of RPM technology architecture. However, most RPM technologies follow a general architecture that consists of four components.:&lt;ref name="smith"&gt;Smith, T. &amp; Sweeney, R. (2010, September). Fusion trends and opportunities. Medical devices and communications. Retrieved from http://www.nerac.com/nerac_insights.php?category=reports&amp;id=279&lt;/ref&gt;
*Sensors on a device that is enabled by wireless communications to measure physiological parameters.
*Local data storage at patients’ site that interfaces between sensors and other centralized data repository and/or healthcare providers.
*Centralized repository to store data sent from sensors, local data storage, diagnostic applications, and/or healthcare providers.
*Diagnostic application software that develops treatment recommendations and intervention alerts based on the analysis of collected data.
Depending on the disease and the parameters that are monitored, different combinations of sensors, storage, and applications may be deployed.&lt;ref name="dx.doi.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

== Applications ==
Physiological data such as [[blood pressure]] and subjective patient data are collected by sensors on peripheral devices. Examples of peripheral devices are: [[blood pressure cuff]], [[pulse oximeter]], and [[glucometer]]. The data are transmitted to healthcare providers or third parties via wireless telecommunication devices. The data are evaluated for potential problems by a healthcare professional or via a clinical decision support algorithm, and patient, caregivers, and health providers are immediately alerted if a problem is detected.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt; As a result, timely intervention ensures positive patient outcomes. The newer applications also provide education, test and medication reminder alerts, and a means of communication between the patient and the provider.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt; The following section illustrates examples of RPM applications, but RPM is not limited to those disease states.

===Dementia and falls===
[[File:Telehealth - Response Watch.jpg|thumb|Telehealth Response Watch]]
For patients with [[dementia]] that are at risk for falls, RPM technology promotes safety and prevents harm through continuous surveillance.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt; RPM sensors can be affixed to the individual or their assistive mobility devices such as canes and walkers.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt; The sensors monitor an individual’s location, gait, linear acceleration and angular velocity, and utilize a mathematical algorithm to predict the likelihood for falls, detect movement changes, and alert caregivers if the individual has fallen.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt; Furthermore, tracking capabilities via [[Wi-Fi]], [[global positioning system]] (GPS) or radio frequency enables caregivers to locate wandering elders.&lt;ref name="center"/&gt;

=== Diabetes ===
[[Diabetes]] management requires control of multiple parameters: [[blood pressure]], weight, and blood glucose. The real-time delivery of blood glucose and blood pressure readings enables immediate alerts for patient and healthcare providers to intervene when needed.  There is evidence to show that daily diabetes management involving RPM is just as effective as usual clinic visit every 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chase | first1 = H.P. | last2 = Pearson | first2 = J.A. | last3 = Wightman | first3 = C. | last4 = Roberts | first4 = M.D. | last5 = Oderberg | first5 = A.D. | last6 = Garg | first6 = S.K. | year = | title = Modem transmission of glucose values reduces the costs and need for clinic visits | url = | journal = Diabetes Care | volume = 26 | issue = 5| pages = 1475–1479| doi = 10.2337/diacare.26.5.1475 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Congestive heart failure===
A systematic review of the literature on home monitoring for [[heart failure]] patients indicates that RPM improves [[quality of life]], improves patient-provider relationships, shortens duration of stay in hospitals, decreases mortality rate, and reduces costs to the healthcare system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martínez | first1 = A. | last2 = Everss | first2 = E. | last3 = Rojo-Alvarez | first3 = J.L. | last4 = Figal | first4 = D.P. | last5 = García-Alberola | first5 = A. | year = 2006 | title = A systematic review of the literature on home monitoring for patients with heart failure | url = | journal = J Telemed Telecare | volume = 12 | issue = 5| pages = 234–41 | doi=10.1258/135763306777889109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Infertility===
A recent study of a remote patient monitoring solution for infertility demonstrated that for appropriately screened patients who had been seeking In-Vitro Fertilization (IVF) treatment, a six-month remote monitoring program had the same pregnancy rate as a cycle of IVF.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chausiaux | first1 = O. | last2 = Hayes | first2 = J. | last3 = Long | first3 = C. | last4 = Morris | first4 = S. | last5 = Williams | first5 = G. | last6 = Husheer | first6 = S. | year = 2011 | title = Pregnancy Prognosis in Infertile Couples on the DuoFertility Programme Compared with In Vitro Fertilisation/Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection | url = | journal = European Obstetrics &amp; Gynaecology | volume = 6 | issue = 2| pages = 92–4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remote patient monitoring product and service used had a cost-per-patient of $800, compared to the average cost of a cycle of IVF of $15,000, suggesting a 95% reduction in the cost of care for the same outcome.

===Early adopter: Veterans Health Administration===
The Veterans Health Administration (VHA), United States’ largest integrated healthcare system, is highly involved in the implementation and evaluation of RPM technologies. It has expanded use of RPM beyond common chronic disease applications, to post-traumatic stress disorder, cancer and palliative care.&lt;ref name="coye"/&gt; VHA’s findings indicate improvements in a wide range of metrics, including decrease in emergency department visits, hospitalizations, and nursing home admissions.&lt;ref name="coye"/&gt;  Findings from the VHA Care Coordination/Home Telehealth program show that RPM deployment resulted in significant savings to the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Darkins | first1 = A. | last2 = Ryan | first2 = P. | last3 = Kobb | first3 = R. | last4 = Foster | first4 = L | last5 = Edmonson | first5 = E. | last6 = Wakefield | first6 = B. | last7 = Lancaster | first7 = A.E. | year = 2008 | title = Care coordination/home Telehealth: the systematic implementation of health informatics, home Telehealth, and disease management to support the care of Veteran patients with chronic conditions | url = | journal = Telemed J E-Health | volume = 14 | issue = 10| pages = 1118–1126 | doi = 10.1089/tmj.2008.0021 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Whole System Demonstrator Trial in UK===
The UK’s Department of Health’s Whole System Demonstrator (WSD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_100947.pdf Whole Systems Demonstrators: An Overview of Telecare and Telehealth]&lt;/ref&gt; launched in May 2008. It is the largest randomised control trial of [[telehealth]] and telecare in the world, involving 6191 patients and 238 GP practices across three sites, [[London Borough of Newham|Newham]], [[Kent]] and [[Cornwall]]. The trials were evaluated by: [[City University London]], [[University of Oxford]], [[University of Manchester]], [[Nuffield Trust]], [[Imperial College London]] and [[London School of Economics]].

* 45% reduction in mortality rates
* 20% reduction in emergency admissions
* 15% reduction in A&amp;E visits
* 14% reduction in elective admissions
* 14% reduction in bed days
* 8% reduction in tariff costs

In the UK, the Government's Care Services minister, Paul Burstow, has stated that [[telehealth]] and telecare would be extended over the next five years (2012-2017) to reach three million people.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dh.gov.uk/health/2012/01/roll-out-of-telehealth-and-telecare-to-benefit-three-million-lives/ 3 Million Lives Announcement]&lt;/ref&gt;

RPM is highly dependent on the individual’s motivation to manage their health. Without the patient’s willingness to be an active participant in their care, RPM implementation will likely fail. Cost is also a barrier to its widespread use. 
There is a lack of reimbursement guidelines for RPM services, which may deter its incorporation into clinical practice.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;
The shift of accountability associated with RPM brings up liability issues.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt; There are no clear guidelines in respect to whether clinicians have to intervene every time they receive an alert regardless of the urgency.
The continuous flow of patient data requires a dedicated team of [[health care providers]] to handle the information, which may, in fact, increase the workload. Although technology is introduced with the intent to increase efficiency, it can become a barrier to some healthcare providers that are not technological.
There are common obstacles that health informatics technologies encounter that applies to RPM. Depending on the [[comorbidities]] monitored, RPM involves a diverse selection of devices in its implementation. Standardization is required for data exchange and interoperability among multiple components. Furthermore, RPM deployment is highly dependent on an extensive [[wireless telecommunications]] infrastructure, which may not be available or feasible in rural areas. Since RPM involves transmission of sensitive patient data across telecommunication networks, information security is a concern.&lt;ref name="smith"/&gt;

==Controversy==
Published by the [[New England Journal of Medicine]], a randomized controlled trial involving congestive heart failure patients concluded that the use of telemonitoring failed to provide a benefit over usual care.&lt;ref name="chan"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Chaudhry | first1 = S.I. | last2 = Mattera | first2 = J.A. | last3 = Curtis | first3 = J.P. | last4 = Spertus | first4 = J.A. | last5 = Herrin | first5 = J. | last6 = Lin | first6 = Z. | last7 = Phillips | first7 = C.O. | last8 = Hodshon | first8 = B.V. | last9 = Coopers | first9 = L.S. | last10 = Krumholz | first10 = H.M. | year = 2010 | title = Telemonitoring in patients with heart failure | url = | journal = N Engl J Med | volume = 363 | issue = | pages = 2301–2309 | doi=10.1056/nejmoa1010029| pmc = 3237394 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The telemonitoring patient group was instructed to call a designated number daily, and answer a series of questions about their symptoms using a keypad.&lt;ref name="chan"/&gt; Clearly, the process described by Chaudhry et al. (2010) differs from the RPM methodology illustrated in the overview, which involves actual collection and transmission of physiological data through point-of-care devices. With articles&lt;ref&gt;Langreth, R. (2010, November 18). "Why remote patient monitoring is overhyped". Forbes. Retrieved from https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertlangreth/2010/11/18/why-telemedicine-is-overhyped/2/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krumholz, H. (2010, November 19). "A double whammy for remote patient monitoring". Forbes. Retrieved from https://www.forbes.com/sites/sciencebiz/2010/11/19/a-double-whammy-for-remote-patient-monitoring/&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Forbes]] associating RPM with the negative findings by Chaudhry et al. (2010), it may be difficult to clear the misconception that telemonitoring is synonymous with remote patient monitoring. The lack of standardization of RPM nomenclature and definition makes it difficult to differentiate between different forms of patient monitoring involving technology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15206">'''Repeated Implantation failure (RIF)''' is the failure of the [[embryo]] to [[Implantation (human embryo)|implant]] onto the side of the [[uterus]] wall following [[In vitro fertilisation|IVF]] treatment&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. Regularly, this happens at 6-7 days after conception and involves the embedding of the growing embryo into the mothers uterus and a connection being formed &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Norwitz|first=Errol R.|last2=Schust|first2=Danny J.|last3=Fisher|first3=Susan J.|date=2001-11-08|title=Implantation and the Survival of Early Pregnancy|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|language=en|volume=345|issue=19|pages=1400–1408|doi=10.1056/nejmra000763|pmid=11794174|issn=0028-4793}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A successful implantation can be determined by using an [[ultrasound]] to view the [[Gestational sac|sac]] which the baby grows in, inside the uterus.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

However, the exact definition of RIF is debated. Recently the most commonly accepted definition is when a women under 40 has gone through 3 unsuccessful cycles of IVF, when in each cycle 4 good quality eggs have been transferred &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Polanski|first=Lukasz T.|last2=Baumgarten|first2=Miriam N.|last3=Quenby|first3=Siobhan|last4=Brosens|first4=Jan|last5=Campbell|first5=Bruce K.|last6=Raine-Fenning|first6=Nicholas J.|date=April 2014|title=What exactly do we mean by 'recurrent implantation failure'? A systematic review and opinion|journal=Reproductive BioMedicine Online|volume=28|issue=4|pages=409–423|doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.12.006|pmid=24581986|issn=1472-6483}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Repeated implantation failure should not be confused with recurrent IVF failure. Recurrent IVF failure is a much more broad term and includes all repeated failures to get pregnant from IVF. Repeated implantation failure specifically refers to those failures due to unsuccessful implanting to the uterus wall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

An unsuccessful implantation can be down to either problems with the mother or with the embryo. It is essential that the mother and embryo are able to communicate with each other during all stages of [[pregnancy]], and an absence of this communication can lead to an unsuccessful implantation and a further unsuccessful pregnancy &lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simon|first=Alex|last2=Laufer|first2=Neri|date=May 2012|title=Repeated implantation failure: clinical approach|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S001502821200324X|journal=Fertility and Sterility|volume=97|issue=5|pages=1039–1043|doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.03.010|pmid=22464086|issn=0015-0282}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  

== Contributing Maternal Factors ==
During implantation, the embryo must cross the [[Epithelium|epithelial]] layer of the maternal [[endometrium]] before invading and implanting in the [[Stroma (tissue)|stroma]] layer. Maternal factors, including congenital uterine abnormalities, [[Uterine fibroid|fibroid]]s, [[Endometrial polyp|endometrial polyps]], intrauterine adhesions, [[adenomyosis]], [[thrombophilia]] and [[Endometriosis|endometriosis,]] can reduce the chances of implantation and result in RIF&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Congenital Uterine Abnormalities ===
Congenital uterine abnormalities are irregularities in the uterus which occur during the mothers foetal development&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

===[[Hox gene|Hox]] Genes ===
Two genes have been identified to assist in the development and receptivity of the uterus and endometrium, [[HOXA10-HOXA9|Hoxa10]] and [[HOXA11|Hoxa11]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salleh|first=Naguib|last2=Giribabu|first2=Nelli|date=2014|title=Leukemia inhibitory factor: roles in embryo implantation and in nonhormonal contraception|journal=TheScientificWorldJournal|volume=2014|pages=1–10|doi=10.1155/2014/201514|issn=1537-744X|pmc=4131495|pmid=25152902}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hoxa10 has been shown to change the upper uterine segment into [[Fallopian tube|oviduct]]-like structures, creating a smaller uterus that appears normal. Embryo transfer into the lower uterine segment does not allow for implantation, so the Hoxa10 gene has multiple effects throughout the uterus.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  Hoxa11 mutations alter the endometrial gland development and reduce the secretion of [[Leukemia inhibitory factor|Leukaemia-Inhibitory factor]] (LIF) which is required for implantation&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;.
[[File:Uterine Fibroids.png|thumb|203x203px|Uterine Fibroid ]]

=== Fibroids ===
[[Uterine fibroid|Fibroid]]s are [[Benign tumor|benign tumours]] found in the [[smooth muscle]] of the uterus, they are often asymptomatic but can cause pelvic pain. They effect implantation rates by altering the shape and [[cytokine]] composition of the uterus. Removal of [[submucosa]]l fibroids has shown to increase implantation rates.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Endometrial Polyps ===
[[Endometrial polyp]]s are benign tumours found in the endometrium which factor into female infertility. There has been limited research into if their removal increases the chances of implantation and pregnancy&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

=== Intrauterine Adhesions ===
Intrauterine adhesions ([[Asherman's syndrome|Asherman's Syndrome]]) occur from scar tissue within the uterus which cause the closure of part or all of the uterus. The [[Adhesion (medicine)|adhesions]] prevent embryos from implanting by reducing the surface area and decreasing the receptivity&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Salma|first=Umme|last2=Xue|first2=Min|last3=Md Sayed|first3=Ali Sheikh|last4=Xu|first4=Dabao|date=2014|title=Efficacy of intrauterine device in the treatment of intrauterine adhesions|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2014|pages=1–15|doi=10.1155/2014/589296|issn=2314-6141|pmc=4165200|pmid=25254212}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Intrauterine adhesions normally occur after damage has been caused to the [[endometrium]], either through removal of unwanted pregnancies, [[miscarriage]], [[infection]], and surgical damage.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Thrombophilia ===
[[Thrombophilia]] is a condition which makes the blood more likely to clot and this increases [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] risk, meaning the individual is at higher risk of [[Myocardial infarction|heart attacks]], [[Stroke|strokes]] or [[Deep vein thrombosis|DVT]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lim|first=Ming Y|last2=Moll|first2=Stephan|date=April 2015|title=Thrombophilia|journal=Vascular Medicine|language=en|volume=20|issue=2|pages=193–196|doi=10.1177/1358863x15575769|pmid=25832606|issn=1358-863X}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In pregnancy it can lead to a disruption in the flow of blood to the [[placenta]] and the uterus wall. This can lead to a decreased receptivity of the uterus wall for a pregnancy and can lead to a miscarriage further on. However, how significantly this contributes to RIF is not fully known but each case should be assessed on a personal basis by a clinician &lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{None}}

== Embryonic Factors ==
[[File:Translocation.gif|thumb|Figure 1: The exchange of chromosomal segments between chromosomes 4 to 20. Since no segments are lost, this is a balanced translocation.]]
The successful implantation of an embryo not only relies on a receptive uterine environment in the mother but also on the quality of the embryo itself. Embryo quality and probability of implantation can be affected by maternal and paternal genetic abnormalities as well as [[zona pellucida]] dysfunction and poor [[embryo transfer]] technique.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Male Genetic Abnormalities ===
[[File:Blastocyst - 2.png|thumb|Figure 2: The zona pellucida surrounds the blastocyst cavity that contains the inner cell mass.]]
The quality of the [[sperm]] that [[Fertilisation|fertilizes]] an egg is a key contributor to the overall quality of the embryo. Abnormalities in [[DNA fragmentation]] and chromosomal arrangements are the main source of genetic deviation in males that can affect embryo quality.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Simon |first=Alex |last2=Laufer |first2=Neri |date=2012-09-14 |title=Assessment and treatment of repeated implantation failure (RIF) |journal=Journal of Assisted Reproduction and Genetics |volume=29 |issue=11 |pages=1227–1239 |doi=10.1007/s10815-012-9861-4 |pmc=3510376 |pmid=22976427}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA fragmentation occurs when the strands of DNA are separated to form two separate strands, this disrupts the genetic information that is coded in genes. Depending on the severity of the fragmentation, this can lead to the dysfunction of specific genes which may or may not be essential for embryo survival and in this case the initiation of implantation. DNA fragmentation can happen spontaneously in cells that undergo programmed cell death ([[apoptosis]]) where DNA is broken apart by enzymes called [[Endonuclease|endonucleases]]. However, since the male DNA isn't activated until around day 3 after fertilisation, it is often difficult to diagnose sperm genetic abnormalities because morphological studies could identify a good quality oocyte when initial transfer occurs, but due to DNA fragmentation in the sperm, the embryo will die after day 3 of growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Female Genetic Abnormalities ===
[[Oocyte]] quality is also a main contributor to overall embryo quality since it is the DNA of the oocyte that is mainly involved in the first 3 days of embryo growth following fertilization. A major source of genetic abnormalities are [[Chromosomal translocation|balanced translocations]] (Figure 1).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

A translocation involves the exchange of segments of chromosomes that are not a homologous pair. In most cases, this leads to balanced translocations, in which no DNA is lost therefore is usually asymptomatic. However, as female gametes are formed, it is probable that 2/3 of embryos produced will have unbalanced translocations within their DNA if fertilised by sperm with a balanced translocation too. Translocation mutations can occur at any point during fertilization or even the first meiotic division that the oocyte undergoes during foetal life.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Zona Pellucida Dysfunction ===
The female egg (oocyte) is surrounded by a layer of [[Glycoprotein|glycoproteins]] called the zona pellucida. Once fertilisation has occurred, this layer will harden to prevent further sperm entering and maintain the shape of the fertilized egg ([[zygote]]) as it divides to form a [[blastocyst]] (Figure 2).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=2012-05-01 |title=Repeated implantation failure: clinical approach |journal=Fertility and Sterility |volume=97 |issue=5 |pages=1039–1043 |doi=10.1016/j.fertnstert.2012.03.010 |pmid=22464086 |last1=Simon |first1=Alex |last2=Laufer |first2=Neri}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once the [[inner cell mass]] -  the group of cells within the blastocyst that go on to form the embryo - starts to expand, [[lysin]] enzymes secreted by the inner cell mass will act on the zona pellucida and weaken the hardened structure. Eventually, this will cause the rupture of the zona pellucida, allowing the blastocyst to hatch and begin to implant into the uterine wall.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

If the zona pellucida fails to thin in preparation for rupture, this will prevent the blastocyst from hatching and therefore be unable to implant, therefore this is a probable cause of repeated implantation failure (RIF). This is supported by a study which showed that implantation rates in women who received assisted zona pellucida hatching - use of synthetic chemical to artificially weaken the zona pellucida - increased.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Investigations ==
Women with RIF should undergo ovarian function testing to explore their levels of [[Follicle-stimulating hormone|FSH]], [[Anti-Müllerian hormone|AMH]] and any other hormones or [[Ovarian follicle|follicle]] counts which may indicate the overall behaviour of the [[ovarian reserve]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Coughlan |first=C. |last2=Ledger |first2=W. |last3=Wang |first3=Q. |last4=Liu |first4=Fenghua |last5=Demirol |first5=Aygul |last6=Gurgan |first6=Timur |last7=Cutting |first7=R. |last8=Ong |first8=K. |last9=Sallam |first9=H. |date=January 2014 |title=Recurrent implantation failure: definition and management |journal=Reproductive Biomedicine Online |volume=28 |issue=1 |pages=14–38 |doi=10.1016/j.rbmo.2013.08.011 |pmid=24269084}}&lt;/ref&gt; Male partners may also be offered laboratory testing of sperm DNA integrity. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the instance of genetic testing, [[Karyotype|karyotyping]] may be made available to couples with RIF to exclude the possibility of balanced chromosomal translocations.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Margalioth |first=E. J. |last2=Ben-Chetrit |first2=A. |last3=Gal |first3=M. |last4=Eldar-Geva |first4=T. |date=December 2006 |title=Investigation and treatment of repeated implantation failure following IVF-ET |journal=Human Reproduction |volume=21 |issue=12 |pages=3036–3043 |doi=10.1093/humrep/del305 |pmid=16905766}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ultrasound|Ultrasounds]] may be used to oversee the morphological growth and development of follicles throughout IVF treatment, in addition to assessing endometrial thickness. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Hysteroscopy]] is an essential part of investigating a couple’s RIF pathology and is used as a diagnostic tool to examine the [[cervical canal]] and [[uterine cavity]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Management ==
In depth reviews of the underlying causes of a couple's [[infertility]] should be undertaken with a qualified fertility specialist in order to make decisions regarding further management.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Modifiable risk factors include [[smoking]], [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol consumption]] and [[Body mass index|BMI]]. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Women with RIF should be advised to abstain from both alcohol and smoking, and male partners may also consider cessation of smoking due to effects associated with weaker sperm counts and damage to sperm DNA and motility. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; An ideal BMI target for women with RIF is between 19 and 29; &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; [[Obesity|obese]] women may consider structured weight-loss programmes and regular exercise over [[bariatric surgery]] due to potential [[folate]], [[iron]], [[vitamin B12]] and other nutritional deficiencies. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Use in triage==
[[Image:RTS Fast Ref Chart.jpg|240px|thumb]]
The Revised Trauma Score is made up of a three categories: [[Glasgow Coma Scale]], [[Systole (medicine)|systolic]] blood pressure, and respiratory rate. The score range is 0–12.  In [[Simple triage and rapid treatment|START]] [[triage]], a patient with an RTS score of 12 is labeled delayed, 11 is urgent, and 3–10 is immediate. Those who have an RTS below 3 are declared dead and should not receive certain care because they are highly unlikely to survive without a significant amount of resources.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

==Scoring==
The score is as follows:&lt;ref name="champion"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Champion HR, Sacco WJ, Copes WS, Gann DS, Gennarelli TA, Flanagan ME |title=A revision of the Trauma Score |journal=The Journal of Trauma |volume=29 |issue=5 |pages=623–9 |date=May 1989 |pmid=2657085 |doi= 10.1097/00005373-198905000-00017|url= }}&lt;!--|accessdate=2012-07-28--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

These three scores (Glasgow Coma Scale, Systolic Blood Pressure, Respiratory Rate) are then used to take the weighted sum by RTS = 0.9368 GCS + 0.7326 SBP + 0.2908 RR. Values for the RTS are in the range 0 to 7.8408. The RTS is heavily weighted towards the Glasgow Coma Scale to compensate for major head injury without multisystem injury or major physiological changes. A threshold of RTS &lt; 4 has been proposed to identify those patients who should be treated in a trauma centre, although this value may be somewhat low.

The '''scope of practice''' describes the procedures, actions, and processes that a healthcare practitioner is permitted to undertake in keeping with the terms of their professional license. The scope of practice is limited to that which the law allows for specific education and experience, and specific demonstrated competency.  Each jurisdiction has laws, licensing bodies, and regulations that describe requirements for education and training, and define scope of practice.

In most jurisdictions, [[Health care provider|health care professions]] with scope of practice laws and regulations include any profession within health care that requires a license to practice such as [[physician]]s, [[surgeon's assistant]], [[nurse]]s, [[dietitians]], [[respiratory therapist]]s, [[physical therapists]], [[occupational therapists]] and [[dentist]]s among many others.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aosw.org/html/prof-scope.php AOSW Scope of Practice], Association of Oncology Social Work.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesupplycenter.com/2009/business/practice_scope_summary.pdf CA LAc Scope of Practice summary], Acupuncturists &amp; related alternative health fields.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governing, licensing, and law enforcement bodies are often at the sub-national (e.g. state or province) level, but federal guidelines / regulations also often exist.  For example, in the United States, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration in the Department of Transportation has a national scope of practice for emergency medical services.

=== Examples ===
* '''Registered respiratory therapist''' — All states and provinces who recognize registered respiratory therapist licensure allow for RRTs to provide [[extracorporeal membrane oxygenation]] (ECMO) support. Despite this, some institutions do not permit RRTs to provide ECMO support.  For the registered respiratory therapists working at the institutions that allow RRTs to provide ECMO support, it is within their scope of practice.  The RRTs who are not permitted by their institution to provide this skill are unable to include the support in their scope of practice.
* '''Paramedic''' —  In some states and provinces a paramedic is allowed to perform [[percutaneous]] [[cricothyrotomy]] if all other [[airway management]] fails.  In the states and provinces that do not allow this intervention, it is not within the scope of practice of the paramedic to perform.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.soundrock.com/sop/index.html Final Draft of the National EMS Scope of Practice Model], September 2005. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050307142054/http://www.soundrock.com/sop/index.html |date=March 7, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sensitivity and specificity.svg|thumb|350px|Sensitivity and specificity]]
'''Sensitivity''' and '''specificity''' are statistical measures of the performance of a [[binary classification]] [[classification rule|test]], also known in statistics as a [[Statistical classification|classification function]]:
*'''Sensitivity''' (also called the '''true positive rate''', the '''[[Precision and recall#Definition (classification context)|recall]]''', or '''probability of detection'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Detector Performance Analysis Using ROC Curves – MATLAB &amp; Simulink Example|url=http://www.mathworks.com/help/phased/examples/detector-performance-analysis-using-roc-curves.html|website=www.mathworks.com|access-date=11 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in some fields) measures the proportion of actual positives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of sick people who are correctly identified as having the condition).
*'''Specificity''' (also called the '''true negative rate''') measures the proportion of actual negatives that are correctly identified as such (e.g., the percentage of healthy people who are correctly identified as not having the condition).

Equivalently, in [[medical test]]s sensitivity is the extent to which actual positives are not overlooked (so false negatives are few), and specificity is the extent to which actual negatives are classified as such (so false positives are few). Thus a highly sensitive test rarely overlooks an actual positive (for example, showing "nothing bad" despite something bad existing); a highly specific test rarely registers a positive classification for anything that is not the target of testing (for example, finding one bacterial species and mistaking it for another closely related one that is the true target); and a test that is highly sensitive ''and'' highly specific does both, so it "rarely overlooks a thing that it is looking for" ''and'' it "rarely mistakes anything else for that thing." Because most medical tests do not have sensitivity and specificity values above 99%, "rarely" does ''not'' equate to [[certainty]]. But for practical reasons, tests with sensitivity and specificity values above 90% have high credibility, albeit usually no certainty, in [[differential diagnosis]].

Sensitivity therefore quantifies the avoiding of [[false positives and false negatives|false negatives]] and specificity does the same for [[false positives and false negatives|false positives]]. For any test, there is usually a trade-off between the measures – for instance, in [[airport security]], since testing of passengers is for potential threats to safety, scanners may be set to trigger alarms on low-risk items like belt buckles and keys (low specificity) in order to increase the probability of identifying dangerous objects and minimize the risk of missing objects that do pose a threat (high sensitivity). This trade-off can be represented graphically using a [[receiver operating characteristic]] curve. A perfect predictor would be described as 100% sensitive, meaning all sick individuals are correctly identified as sick, and 100% specific, meaning no healthy individuals are incorrectly identified as sick. In reality, however, any [[non-deterministic algorithm|non-deterministic]] predictor will possess a minimum error bound known as the [[Bayes error rate]].

== Definitions ==
In the terminology ''true/false positive/negative'', ''true'' or ''false'' refers to the assigned classification being correct or incorrect, while ''positive'' or ''negative'' refers to assignment to the positive or the negative category.

{{Confusion matrix terms}}

=== Application to screening study ===
Imagine a study evaluating a new test that screens people for a disease. Each person taking the test either has or does not have the disease. The test outcome can be positive (classifying the person as having the disease) or negative (classifying the person as not having the disease). The test results for each subject may or may not match the subject's actual status. In that setting:
* True positive: Sick people correctly identified as sick
* False positive: Healthy people incorrectly identified as sick
* True negative: Healthy people correctly identified as healthy
* False negative: Sick people incorrectly identified as healthy

In general, Positive = identified and negative = rejected.
Therefore:
* True positive = correctly identified
* False positive = incorrectly identified
* True negative = correctly rejected
* False negative = incorrectly rejected

=== Confusion matrix ===
Let us consider a group with '''P''' positive instances and '''N''' negative instances of some condition. The four outcomes can be formulated in a 2×2 ''[[contingency table]]'' or ''[[confusion matrix]]'', as follows:

{{DiagnosticTesting Diagram}}

== Sensitivity ==
Sensitivity refers to the test's ability to correctly detect ill patients who do have the condition.&lt;ref name=BMJ&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Altman DG, Bland JM | title = Diagnostic tests. 1: Sensitivity and specificity | journal = BMJ | volume = 308 | issue = 6943 | pages = 1552 | date = June 1994 | pmid = 8019315 | pmc = 2540489 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.308.6943.1552 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the example of a medical test used to identify a disease, the sensitivity (sometimes also named as detection rate in a clinical setting) of the test is the proportion of people who test positive for the disease among those who have the disease. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\text{sensitivity} &amp; = \frac{\text{number of true positives}}{\text{number of true positives} + \text{number of false negatives}} \\[8pt]
&amp; = \frac{\text{number of true positives}}{\text{total number of sick individuals in population}} \\[8pt]
&amp; = \text{probability of a positive test given that the patient has the disease}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

A negative result in a test with high sensitivity is useful for ruling out disease.&lt;ref name=BMJ /&gt; A high sensitivity test is reliable when its result is negative, since it rarely misdiagnoses those who have the disease. A test with 100% sensitivity will recognize all patients with the disease by testing positive. A negative test result would definitively ''rule out'' presence of the disease in a patient.

A positive result in a test with high sensitivity is not useful for ruling in disease. Suppose a 'bogus' test kit is designed to show only one reading, positive. When used on diseased patients, all patients test positive, giving the test 100% sensitivity. However, sensitivity by definition does not take into account false positives. The bogus test also returns positive on all healthy patients, giving it a false positive rate of 100%, rendering it useless for detecting or "ruling in" the disease.

Sensitivity is not the same as the [[Precision and recall|precision]] or [[positive predictive value]] (ratio of true positives to combined true and false positives), which is as much a statement about the proportion of actual positives in the population being tested as it is about the test.

The calculation of sensitivity does not take into account indeterminate test results.
If a test cannot be repeated, indeterminate samples either should be excluded from the analysis (the number of exclusions should be stated when quoting sensitivity) or can be treated as false negatives (which gives the worst-case value for sensitivity and may therefore underestimate it).

== Specificity ==
Specificity relates to the test's ability to correctly reject healthy patients without a condition. Consider the example of a medical test for diagnosing a disease.
Specificity of a test is the proportion of healthy patients known not to have the disease, who will test negative for it. Mathematically, this can also be written as:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{align}
\text{specificity} &amp; = \frac{\text{number of true negatives}}{\text{number of true negatives} + \text{number of false positives}} \\[8pt]
&amp; = \frac{\text{number of true negatives}}{\text{total number of well individuals in population}} \\[8pt]
&amp; = \text{probability of a negative test given that the patient is well}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

A positive result in a test with high specificity is useful for ruling in disease. The test rarely gives positive results in healthy patients. A test with 100% specificity will read negative, and accurately exclude disease from all healthy patients. A positive result signifies a high probability of the presence of disease.&lt;ref name="cebm"&gt;{{cite web|title=SpPins and SnNouts|url=http://www.cebm.net/sppin-and-snnout/|publisher=Centre for Evidence Based Medicine (CEBM)|access-date=26 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A test with a higher specificity has a lower [[Type I and type II errors|type I error]] rate.

File:LowSensitivity HighSpecificity 1400x1050.png|Low sensitivity and high specificity
&lt;/gallery&gt;

== Medical examples ==
In [[medical diagnosis]], test sensitivity is the ability of a test to correctly identify those with the disease (true positive rate), whereas test specificity is the ability of the test to correctly identify those without the disease (true negative rate).
If 100 patients known to have a disease were tested, and 43 test positive, then the test has 43% sensitivity. If 100 with no disease are tested and 96 return a negative result, then the test has 96% specificity. Sensitivity and specificity are prevalence-independent test characteristics, as their values are intrinsic to the test and do not depend on the disease prevalence in the population of interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mangrulkar|first=Rajesh | name-list-format = vanc |title=Diagnostic Reasoning I and II|url=http://open.umich.edu/education/med/m1/patientspop-decisionmaking/2010/materials|access-date=24 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Positive and negative predictive values, but not sensitivity or specificity, are values influenced by the prevalence of disease in the population that is being tested. These concepts are illustrated graphically in this applet [https://kennis-research.shinyapps.io/Bayes-App/ Bayesian clinical diagnostic model] which show the positive and negative predictive values as a function of the prevalence, the sensitivity and specificity.

=== Misconceptions ===
It is often claimed that a highly specific test is effective at ruling in a disease when positive, while a highly sensitive test is deemed effective at ruling out a disease when negative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://omerad.msu.edu/ebm/Diagnosis/Diagnosis4.html|title=Evidence-Based Diagnosis|publisher=Michigan State University|access-date=2013-08-23|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706035232/http://omerad.msu.edu/ebm/Diagnosis/Diagnosis4.html|archive-date=2013-07-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.med.emory.edu/EMAC/curriculum/diagnosis/sensand.htm|title=Sensitivity and Specificity|publisher=Emory University Medical School Evidence Based Medicine course}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the widely used mnemonics SPIN and SNOUT, according to which a highly SPecific test, when Positive, rules IN disease (SP-P-IN), and a highly 'SeNsitive' test, when Negative rules OUT disease (SN-N-OUT). Both rules of thumb are, however, inferentially misleading, as the diagnostic power of any test is determined by both its sensitivity ''and'' its specificity.&lt;ref name="pmid8028462"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Baron JA | title = Too bad it isn't true | journal = Medical Decision Making | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 107 | date = Apr–Jun 1994 | pmid = 8028462 | doi = 10.1177/0272989X9401400202 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid8028470"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boyko EJ | title = Ruling out or ruling in disease with the most sensitive or specific diagnostic test: short cut or wrong turn? | journal = Medical Decision Making | volume = 14 | issue = 2 | pages = 175–9 | date = Apr–Jun 1994 | pmid = 8028470 | doi = 10.1177/0272989X9401400210 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid15271832"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pewsner D, Battaglia M, Minder C, Marx A, Bucher HC, Egger M | title = Ruling a diagnosis in or out with "SpPIn" and "SnNOut": a note of caution | journal = BMJ | volume = 329 | issue = 7459 | pages = 209–13 | date = July 2004 | pmid = 15271832 | pmc = 487735 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.329.7459.209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradeoff between specificity and sensitivity is explored in [[Receiver operating characteristic|ROC analysis]] as a trade off between TPR and FPR (that is, recall and fallout).&lt;ref name=Fawcett2006 /&gt; Giving them equal weight optimizes Informedness = Specificity+Sensitivity-1 = TPR-FPR, the magnitude of which gives the probability of an informed decision between the two classes (&gt;0 represents appropriate use of information, 0 represents chance-level performance, &lt;0 represents perverse use of information).&lt;ref name="Powers2011" /&gt;

=== Sensitivity index ===
The [[sensitivity index]] or ''d' '' (pronounced 'dee-prime') is a [[statistic]] used in signal [[detection theory]]. It provides the separation between the means of the signal and the noise distributions, compared against the standard deviation of the noise distribution. For [[Normal distribution|normally distributed]] signal and noise with mean and standard deviations &lt;math&gt;\mu_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_S&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\mu_N&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_N&lt;/math&gt;, respectively, d' is defined as:

: &lt;math&gt;d' = \frac{\mu_S - \mu_N}{\sqrt{\frac{1}{2}(\sigma_S^2 + \sigma_N^2)}}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref name="pmid20089911"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Gale SD, Perkel DJ | title = A basal ganglia pathway drives selective auditory responses in songbird dopaminergic neurons via disinhibition | journal = The Journal of Neuroscience | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 1027–37 | date = January 2010 | pmid = 20089911 | pmc = 2824341 | doi = 10.1523/JNEUROSCI.3585-09.2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An estimate of d' can be also found from measurements of the hit rate and [[False alarm|false-alarm]] rate. It is calculated as:

::''d''' = ''Z''(hit rate) – ''Z''(false alarm rate),&lt;ref name="MacmillanCreelman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Macmillan|first1=Neil A.|last2=Creelman|first2=C. Douglas | name-list-format = vanc |title=Detection Theory: A User's Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hDX65v9bReYC|page=7|date=15 September 2004|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-4106-1114-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

where function ''Z''(''p''), ''p'' &amp;isin; [0,1], is the inverse of the [[Normal distribution#Cumulative distribution function|cumulative Gaussian distribution]].

''d' '' is a [[dimensionless]] statistic. A higher ''d''' indicates that the signal can be more readily detected.

== Worked example ==
{{SensSpecPPVNPV}}

== Estimation of errors in quoted sensitivity or specificity ==

Sensitivity and specificity values alone may be highly misleading.  The 'worst-case' sensitivity or specificity must be calculated in order to avoid reliance on experiments with few results.  For example, a particular test may easily show 100% sensitivity if tested against the gold standard four times, but a single additional test against the gold standard that gave a poor result would imply a sensitivity of only 80%.  A common way to do this is to state the [[binomial proportion confidence interval]], often calculated using a Wilson score interval.

[[Confidence intervals]] for sensitivity and specificity can be calculated, giving the range of values within which the correct value lies at a given confidence  level (e.g., 95%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medcalc.org/calc/diagnostic_test.php|title=Diagnostic test online calculator calculates sensitivity, specificity, likelihood ratios and predictive values from a 2x2 table – calculator of confidence intervals for predictive parameters|work=medcalc.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Terminology in information retrieval ==
In [[information retrieval]], the positive predictive value is called '''[[Precision and recall#Definition (classification context)|precision]]''', and sensitivity is called '''[[Precision and recall#Definition (classification context)|recall]]'''. Unlike the Specificity vs Sensitivity tradeoff, these measures are both independent of the number of true negatives, which is generally unknown and much larger than the actual numbers of relevant and retrieved documents. This assumption of very large numbers of true negatives versus positives is rare in other applications.&lt;ref name="Powers2011" /&gt;

The [[F-score]] can be used as a single measure of performance of the test for the positive class.  The F-score is the [[harmonic mean]] of precision and recall:

:&lt;math&gt;F = 2 \times \frac{\text{precision} \times \text{recall}}{\text{precision} + \text{recall}} &lt;/math&gt;

In the traditional language of [[statistical hypothesis testing]], the sensitivity of a test is called the [[statistical power]] of the test, although the word ''power'' in that context has a more general usage that is not applicable in the present context.  A sensitive test will have fewer [[Type I and type II errors|Type II errors]].

'''Sharefarming''' is a system of [[farming]] in which '''sharefarmers''' make use of agricultural assets they do not own in return for some percentage of the profits. Sometimes the sharefarmer will receive a wage from the owner instead, although such a person is normally considered a '''[[tenant farmer]]''' or farm labourer. Two common implementations of the sharefarming concept are '''[[sharecropping]]''' and '''[[sharemilking]]''', although it is applied to other sorts of agricultural assets.

Sharefarming was common{{when?|date=August 2015}} in colonial Africa, in Scotland, and in Ireland; it came into wide use in the United States during the [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era (late 19th-century). In Europe, especially France and Italy, a sharefarming system called '''[[Metayage System|metayage]]''' once commonly occurred.

While sharefarming can be seen as a form of oppression similar to [[Feudalism|feudal]] [[serfdom]] and is in practice in many poor areas today, such as India, it is also common in highly developed countries. The latter case occurs where individual farmers prefer not to have complete responsibility for agricultural assets such as the land or livestock, and in such applications it is not considered{{by whom?|date=August 2015}} exploitative.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Sharecropping==
{{Main|Sharecropping}}
Sharecropping is the most common application of the sharefarming principle. In practice, sharefarmers work land which they don't own in return for varying portions of the total profit. In many cases where it is practiced in very poor farming communities it is considered an exploitative model. Sharecropping began after the Civil War and ended between the 1930s and the 1940s because when machines came that could to farming more easily, landowners didn't need actual people working the fields.

==Sharemilking==
{{Main|Sharemilking}}
Sharemilking is the application of the sharefarming concept to the dairy industry. Sharemilkers tend to own their own cows but use facilities they do not own to actually milk the cows. This is often a convenient arrangement as milking facilities would otherwise lie empty and unused for several hours of the day.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Samenow was born to Charles and Sylvia Samenow. He is married, has two children, and resides in Falls Church, Virginia.&lt;ref name="utexas1982"/&gt;

===Career===
From 1970 through 1978, Dr. Samenow worked as a clinical research psychologist for the Program for the Investigation of Criminal Behavior at [[St. Elizabeth's Hospital]] in Washington, D.C.. With Dr. Samuel Yochelson, the findings of their clinical research-treatment study of offenders were published in the three-volume set entitled ''The Criminal Personality''. Since 1978, Dr. Samenow has been in private practice as a clinical psychologist in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

Dr. Stanton Samenow received his B.A. (cum laude) from [[Yale University]] in 1963 and his PhD in psychology from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1968...In 1978, Dr. Samenow entered the private practice of [[clinical psychology]] in [[Alexandria, Virginia]]. His specialty has continued to be the evaluation and treatment of juvenile and adult offenders. Dr. Samenow has delivered lectures, training seminars, and workshops in 48 states, Canada, and England, to professional groups including mental health, law enforcement, corrections, education, social services, and the judiciary.

Dr. Samenow frequently carries out psychological reports for use in family court cases in the USA. Dr. Samenow wrote a book based on his experience as an independent custody evaluator published in 2002. It is titled "In the Best Interest of the Child: How to Protect Your Child from the Pain of Your Divorce".&lt;ref&gt;The psychological reports are intended by the judiciary to be an impartial, third-party assessment of each parent's psychological state and to include any recommendations for custody. In this article published in the Washington Post, entitled "He's on the Front Line in Custody Battles" from January 21, 2002, author Phil McCombs describes Dr Samenow's role, "His goal was to learn the elusive "truth," sorting out charges and countercharges, in effect psychoanalyzing the parents, getting to know them so well that he could recommend exact details for realistic custody arrangements."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics''' is a non-profit institution that was established in 1990. Its parent organisation is [[The Cyprus Foundation for Muscular Dystrophy Research]].

It specialises in neurology, molecular biology and all aspects of human genetics. It also collaborates with the [[University of Cyprus]] on a [[Medical Genetics]] graduate programme.

==Scientific Advancement for Multiple Sclerosis==
The study was performed from July 2007 until December 2010, according to the global standards of clinical research for the disease and with the participation of 80 patients with relapsing multiple sclerosis. The study design and the medical protocol included many innovations leading to the preparation of the formulation. Unlike anything else available, this formulation (with the code PLP10) is a nutraceutical (with natural biomolecules), administered orally, can be co-administered with all other available treatments, showed great therapeutic effect in reducing the frequency of relapses (flares) of the disease but mainly on the progression of the disability of patients. Finally, it is also potentially able to trigger remyelination, neuroprotection and mainly free of side effects. It thus has the ability to influence a holistic treatment of the disease, since it can affect the total known biological and biochemical network of pathogenic / pathogenetic events and mechanisms that cause the disease, including the biochemical mechanisms responsible for remyelination and restoration of neurons (healing).

Upon completion of our clinical study and research, we are pleased to be able to announce the of-international interest intriguing research results for the treatment of the disease in relation to the PLP10 preparation. The study was accepted and published in the British Medical Journal, in the open edition, after an independent assessment by world-class scientists with knowledge, long-term experience and international recognition in research and treatment of MS. The product is registered for a USA and a worldwide patent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cing.ac.cy/images/media/file/PressRelease_3scientists_eng.pdf Scientific Advancement by three Cypriot Scientists Hope for a new innovative treatment for Multiple Sclerosis]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United in Anger: A History of ACT UP''''' is a 2012 [[documentary film]] about the beginning and progress of the [[AIDS]] activist movement from the perspective of the people fighting the epidemic. Archival footage with oral histories of members of [[ACT UP]] depicts the history of civil disobedience against corporate greed, social indifference, and government negligence in the face of AIDS. Producers Jim Hubbard and [[Sarah Schulman]] created a documentary film that captures the efforts of ACT UP to remove the stigma associated with AIDS, fast track experimental drug research and testing, and provide a context for the devastating effects of the epidemic. Film includes several actions by ACT UP:  Seize Control of the FDA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Police Arrest AIDS Protesters Blocking Access to FDA Offices |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=11 October 1988 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1988-10-11/news/mn-3909_1_police-arrest-aids-protesters }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stop the Church,&lt;ref&gt;ACT UP.

== Historical ==

The influential Massachusetts preacher [[Cotton Mather]] was the first known person to attempt [[smallpox]] [[inoculation]] on a large scale, inoculating himself and over 200 members of his congregation with the help of a local doctor. While his view became standard, he also caused the first reaction against the practice.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Rowland Hill (preacher)|Rowland Hill]] (1744–1833) was a popular English preacher acquainted with [[Edward Jenner]], the pioneer of smallpox [[vaccination]], and he encouraged the vaccination of the congregations he visited or preached to.&lt;ref name="Bazin2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=H. Bazin|title=The eradication of smallpox: Edward Jenner and the first and only eradication of a human infectious disease|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8bPuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA75|date=19 January 2000|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=978-0-12-083475-4|pages=75–}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published a tract on the subject in 1806,&lt;ref name="GlynnGlynn2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Ian Glynn|author2=Jenifer Glynn|title=The Life and Death of Smallpox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tL4W3YNMYLIC&amp;pg=PA112|date=30 August 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-84542-7|pages=112–}}&lt;/ref&gt; at a time when many medical men refused to sanction it. Later he became a member of the Royal Jennererian Society, which was established when vaccination was accepted in Britain, India, the US, and elsewhere. [[John C.

Several [[Boston]] clergymen and devout physicians formed a society that opposed vaccination in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;David P. Mindell, The Evolving World: Evolution in Everyday Life (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 2007 [2006]), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Others complained that the practice was dangerous, going so far as to demand that doctors who carried out these procedures be tried for attempted murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Theological opposition to inoculation, vaccination, and the use of anæsthetics |title= A History of the Warfare of Science with Theology in Christendom |author= Andrew Dickson White |publisher=Appleton |year= 1896 |chapterurl=http://abob.libs.uga.edu/bobk/whitem10.html |accessdate=2007-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1816 Iceland made the clergy responsible for smallpox vaccination and gave them the responsibility of keeping vaccination records for their parishes; Sweden also had similar practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Pétursson P |year=1983 |title= Church and Social Change: A Study of the Secularization Process in Iceland, 1830–1930 |series= Studies in religious experience and behaviour, nr. 4 |location= Helsingborg, Sweden |publisher= Plus Ultra |pages= 70, 79 |isbn=91-970355-9-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When vaccination was introduced into [[United Kingdom|UK]] public policy, and adoption followed overseas, there was opposition from trade unionists and others, including sectarian ministers and those interested in self-help and alternative medicines like homeopathy.&lt;ref&gt;Durbach, Nadja. 2005.

[[Anti-vaccinationists]] were most common in Protestant countries. Those who were religious often came from minority religious movements outside of mainstream Protestantism, including Quakers in England and Baptists in Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdelais, Patrice. 2006.''

Catholic and Anglican missionaries vaccinated Northwest Coast Native Americans during an 1862 smallpox epidemic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |author= Boyd RW | title=The Coming of the Spirit of Pestilence: Introduced Infectious Diseases and Population Decline Among Northwest Coast Indians, 1774–1874 | year=1999 | publisher= University of Washington Press | location=Seattle |isbn=0-295-97837-6 |chapter= A final disaster: the 1862 smallpox epidemic in coastal British Columbia |pages=172–201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom|UK]], a number of [[Vaccination Acts]] were introduced to control vaccination and inoculation, starting in 1840, when [[variolation|smallpox inoculation]] was banned. The 1853 Act introduced compulsory free infant vaccination  enforced by local authorities. By 1871, infant vaccination was compulsory and parents refusing to have their child vaccinated were fined and imprisoned if the fines were not paid. Resistance to compulsion grew, and in 1889, after riots in [[Leicester]], a Royal Commission was appointed and issued six reports between 1892 and 1896. It recommended the abolition of cumulative penalties. This was done in an 1898  Act, which also introduced a conscience clause that exempted parents who did not believe vaccination was efficacious or safe. This extended the concept of the "[[conscientious objector]]" in English law. &lt;!-- see Talk and Hansard--&gt;A further Act in 1907 made it easier to obtain exemption.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[Jehovah's Witnesses]] banned their members from receiving vaccinations from 1931 to 1952. They have since reversed their position. The decision of whether to vaccinate themselves or their family is left to the individual Witness. Some more recent Jehovah's Witness publications have mentioned the success of vaccination programs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.religioustolerance.org/witness6.htm About the Jehovah's Witnesses Christian denomination - Past opposition to vaccinations], religioustolerance.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Some conservative Christian groups in the United States oppose mandatory vaccination for diseases typically spread via sexual contact, arguing that the possibility of disease deters risky sexual contact.

The use of [[fetal tissue in vaccines|fetal tissue in the development of vaccines]] has also provoked some controversy among religions opposed to [[abortion]]. The cell culture media of some viral vaccines, and the virus of the [[rubella]] vaccine, are derived from tissues taken from therapeutic abortions performed in the 1960s, leading to moral questions. For example, the [[principle of double effect]], originated by [[Thomas Aquinas]], holds that actions with both good and bad consequences are morally acceptable in specific circumstances, and the question is how this principle applies to vaccination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.immunizationinfo.org/assets/files/pdfs/Moral_Considerations_With_Certain_Viral_Vaccines.pdf |format=PDF |title= Moral considerations with certain viral vaccines |author= Grabenstein JD |journal= Christ Pharm |issn=1094-9534 |volume=2 |issue=2 |pages=3–6 |year=1999 |accessdate=2009-05-11}} {{Dead link|date=October 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican Curia has expressed concern about the rubella vaccine's embryonic cell origin, saying Catholics have "...a grave responsibility to use alternative vaccines and to make a conscientious objection with regard to those which have moral problems."&lt;ref name=Vatican&gt;{{cite journal |author= Pontifical Academy for Life |title= Moral reflections on vaccines prepared from cells derived from aborted human foetuses |year= 2005 |journal= Medicina e Morale |publisher= Center for Bioethics, Catholic University of the Sacred Heart |url= http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo/vacc/vacc&amp;lang=english |accessdate= 2008-12-03 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060507072740/http://www.academiavita.org/template.jsp?sez=Documenti&amp;pag=testo%2Fvacc%2Fvacc&amp;lang=english |archivedate= 2006-05-07 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Vatican concluded that until an alternative becomes available it is acceptable for [[Catholic]]s to use the existing vaccine, writing, "This is an unjust alternative choice, which must be eliminated as soon as possible."&lt;ref name=Vatican/&gt;

===Political opposition to vaccination by religious groups===

The majority of Orthodox Rabbis view vaccination as a religious obligation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ou.org/news/statement-vaccinations-ou-rabbinical-council-america/|title=Statement on Vaccinations from the OU and Rabbinical Council of America|publisher=Orthodox Union|date=2015-02-10|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; A magazine called P.E.A.C.H. that presented an anti-immunization message to Orthodox Jews was distributed in Brooklyn, New York in early 2014. This is not a widespread phenomenon though. 96% of students at Yeshivas (who are essentially all Orthodox Jewish) in New York City were immunized according to information obtained in 2014, although this is a lower than average rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forward.com/articles/205801/are-ultra-orthodox-turning-away-from-vaccination/?p=all|title=Are Ultra-Orthodox Turning Away From Vaccination?|last=Nathan-Kazis|first=Josh|work=Forward|date=2014-09-17|accessdate=2017-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003 imams in northern [[Nigeria]] advised their followers not to have their children vaccinated with oral polio vaccine, perceived to be a plot by Westerners to decrease Muslim fertility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29781528/ns/health-infectious_diseases/t/muslim-clerics-finally-embrace-polio-campaign/#.VQC3WIF4qcY|title=Muslim Clerics Finally Embrace Polio Campaign|accessdate=2015-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boycott caused the number of polio cases to rise not only in Nigeria but also in neighboring countries.

== Exemptions ==

In the U.S., all states except Mississippi, California and West Virginia allow parents to opt out of their children's otherwise-mandatory vaccinations for religious reasons. The number of religious exemptions rose greatly in the late 1990s and early 2000s; for example, in [[Massachusetts]], the rate of those seeking exemptions rose from 0.24% in 1996 to 0.60% in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.emeraldinsight.com/doi/pdfplus/10.1108/07363761111181464|title=Against medical advice: the anti-consumption of vaccines|date=|website=|publisher=The University of Auckland Business School, Auckland, New Zealand|access-date=22 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some parents falsely claim religious beliefs to get exemptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-10-17-19819928_x.htm |date=2007-10-17 |accessdate=2007-11-24 |author= LeBlanc S |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |title= Parents use religion to avoid vaccines |work= USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Medical Association]] opposes such exemptions, saying that they endanger health not only for the unvaccinated individual but also for neighbors and the community at large.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ad-com/polfind/Hlth-Ethics.pdf |author= American Medical Association |title= Health and Ethics Policies of the AMA House of Delegates |quote= H-440.970 Religious Exemptions from Immunizations |format=PDF |pages=460–61 |year=2009 |accessdate=2009-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''variable electro-precipitator''' (VEP) is a [[Wastewater|waste water]] remediation unit using [[electrocoagulation]]. The differences between a standard electrocoagulation (EC) unit and a variable Electro-precipitation unit are in the enhanced flow path and the unit [[electrode]] connections. The variable electro-precipitator's flow path has been designed to maximize retention time and to increase the [[turbulence]] of the water within the unit.  This design aids in increasing the amount of effective treatment per gallon of [[water]].

A major design weakness of the electrocoagulation units is the method used in connecting the electrode to the [[Electric power|power source]].  These designs cause overheating, resulting in premature failure of the electrocoagulation reaction chamber.  VEP reaction chambers are designed to resolve these performance issues by changing all electrode connections from the standard wet connection (inside the chamber) to an external dry connection.  The VEP is cooler-operating, and has a longer chamber life than an electrocoagulation unit.

'''[[Water resource]]s''' management in '''[[Pakistan]]'''.

==Water resources==
According to the United Nations' "[[UN World Water Development Report]]", the total actual renewable water resources increased from 2,961 m³ per capita in 2000 to 3,420 m³ per capita in 2005. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Using data from the Pakistani federal government's Planning and Development Division, the overall water availability has decreased from 1,299 m³ per capita in 1996-97 to 1,101 m³ per capita in 2004-05.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In urban areas, most water is supplied from groundwater except for the cities of Karachi, and a part of Islamabad, where mainly surface water is used. In most rural areas, groundwater is used. In rural areas with saline groundwater, irrigation canals serve as the main source of domestic water.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Water use==
Out of the 169,384 billion m³ of water which were withdrawn in 2000, 96% were used for agricultural purposes, leaving 2% for domestic and another 2% for industrial use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
