      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5274">'''Adriano Alpago-Novello''' (Belluno, July 20, 1932 - Belluno, June 4, 2005) was an Italian architect, art historian and professor. 

Adriano Alpago-Novello was born in Belluno by Alberto Alpago Novello, architect and urban planner, and Laura Carlotti.

After classical studies at the Leone XXIII of MIlan, in 1957 he graduated in architecture at the Politecnico di Milano, where since 1958 become an assistant professor of History of Art and History and Styles of architecture. In the same year he is responsible for the organization of the site and of thearchitectural surveys of the excavation of the Roman theater in Caesarea, Israel: finding how little the archeologists working on the site know or care about the culture identifiable as "Byzantine", drives him to schedule a systematic series of fact-finding visits and photographic campaigns on the presence of Byzantine churches in central and eastern Mediterranean. The result is a series of studies that lead to the achievement of the professorship and the assignment to University. Since 1963 is assistant professor at the Politecnico di Milano to the chair of History of Art and History and Styles of architecture, of which in 1971 he became a lecturer; in the same year he is Professor of History of Architecture at the Faculty of Architecture in Turin. Since 1975 he is associate professor at the Faculty of Architecture of Milan, since 1987 Professor of History of Muslim art at the University Ca 'Foscari of Venice.

He participates as a speaker at numerous national and international conferences on architecture and Byzantine studies and is invited to give lectures in many Italian and foreign universities.

He devotes special attention to the study, under the historical and architectural point of view, of cultural areas of Italy not yet known, with a particular interest for mountain and rural regions, in order for a recovery of the local cultures and values of traditional architecture. Specific insights regarding the territory of Belluno bring to the show "Val Belluna, Case nella Campagna", 1964, and to numerous publications on the subject [1] [2] [3]. After the exhibition opening, Dino Buzzati wrote an article in the Corriere della Sera entitled: "The architect who has seen."

Partner and adviser to Italia Nostra, he is deeply devoted to defend the historical heritage with lectures and debates in various Italian cities.

In 1967 he founds and directs the Center for Studies and Documentation of Armenian Culture. The Center published the "Documenti di architettura Armena" (''Documents of Armenian architecture'') and "Ricerca sull' architettura Armena" (''Research on Armenian architecture'') series. He was the organizer of the exhibition of Medieval Armenian Architecture which visited several Italian cities and more than eighteen countries from South America to Iran and Armenia.

From 1967 to 1983 is responsible and member of study missions, under the official patronage of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Italy, in Armenian territory, Georgia, Iran, Northern Syria.

He received several international awards (international prize "Parekorzagan" for Armenian scholars who have made a fundamental contribution in the field of Armenian art, award "Thoros Thoromanian" of the Academy of Sciences of Armenia for Armenian art scholars, medaglia Reza Pahalevi for the study work carried out in Iran).

He was scientific advisor for the architecture sector of the series of studies on "Popular Cultura Popolare Veneta" (promoted by the Veneto Region and the Fondazione Giorgio Cini) and co-director of the Historical Archive of Belluno, Feltre and Cadore.

At the professional level he operated especially in the Veneto Region and in Milan, devoting particularly to restoration works.

[[File:Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin 019.jpg|thumb|right|310px|[[Amarna letter EA 288|EA 288]], from [[Abdi-Heba]], letter 4 of 6 from [[Jerusalem]]. &lt;br&gt;(very high-resolution expandable photo) ]]

'''Amarna letter EA 289''', titled: ''"A Reckoning Demanded,"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 289, ''A Reckoning Demanded'', p. 332-333.&lt;/ref&gt; is a moderately tall, finely-inscribed [[clay tablet]] letter, approximately 6.5 in tall, from [[Abdi-Heba]] the mayor/ruler of [[Jerusalem]], of the mid 14th century BC [[Amarna letters]]. The scribe of his six letters to Egypt were penned by the "[[Jerusalem scribe]]"; EA 289 is a moderately long, and involved letter, mentioning ten named individuals, some more that three times. A total of nine locations are referenced, as well as men of the "[[Hapiru]]"-("LÚ-[[meš (cuneiform)|MEŠ]]-Hapiru-&lt;sup&gt;[[ki (cuneiform)|ki]]&lt;/sup&gt;"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cdli.ucla.edu/cdlisearch/search_beta/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&amp;ObjectID=271091 EA 289: Reverse, line 24.], CDLI no. 271091 (''Chicago Digital Library Initiative'')&lt;/ref&gt; and men of "Qilyi-&lt;sup&gt;[[ki (cuneiform)|ki]]&lt;/sup&gt;".

&lt;!--The Canaanite [[city-state]]s were visited by the scribes, with short 'status reports' sent to the Pharaoh (King) reporting on city or regional accounts, for example the troubles with the [[habiru]], or other external affairs. Many of the Canaanite letters are short, with some nearly identical phraseology of words, as well as the layout of individual letters. Milkilu authored EA 268 through EA 271. [[Amarna letter EA 270]]-(29 lines) is nearly identical in shape to EA 271-(27 lines), with the beginning lines of the obverse, nearly identical in wording, and spacing.
--&gt;
The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city Akhetaten, in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the [[text corpus|body]] of letters.

Letter EA 289 (see here-(Obverse): [http://amarna.ieiop.csic.es/amarna/Tablillas/EA%20288/EA%20288-VAT%201643%20(1).jpg]), is numbered VAT 1645, from the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]].

:(5-10)'''[[Milkilu]] does not break away from the sons of [[Labaya]] and from the sons of [[Arsawa]], as they desire the land of the king for themselves. As for a mayor who does such a deed, why does the king not (c)all him to account?'''
:(11-17)--'''Such was the deed that Milkilu and [[Tagi (Ginti mayor)|Tagi]] did: they took [[Rubutu]]. And now as for [[Jerusalem]]-(&lt;sup&gt;URU&lt;/sup&gt;Uru-Salim&lt;sup&gt;[[ki (cuneiform)|ki]]&lt;/sup&gt;), if this land belongs to the king, why is it''' ''((not)) of concern''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; '''to the king like Hazzatu?'''
:(18-24)--'''Ginti-kirmil belongs to Tagi, and men of Gintu are the garrison in [[Bitsanu]].&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Are we to act like [[Labaya]] when he was giving the land of [[Šakmu]] to the [[Hapiru]]?'''
:(25-36)--'''Milkilu has written to Tagi and the sons ((of Labaya)), "Be''' ''the both of you a protection.''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; '''Grant all their demands to the men of [[Qiltu]], and let us isolate Jerusalem."&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Addaya has taken the garrison that you sent in the charge of Haya, the son of Miyare; he has stationed it in his own house in [[Hazzatu]] and has sent 20 men to Egypt-(Miṣri). May the king, my lord, know (that) no garrison of the king is with me.'''
:(37-44)--'''Accordingly, as truly as the king lives, his''' ''irpi-'' '''official,&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; [[Pawura|Pu'uru]], has left me and is in Hazzatu. (May the king''' '' call (this) to mind when be arrives.)''&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; '''And so may the king send 50 men as a garrison to protect the land. The entire land of the king has deser[ted].'''
:(45-46)--'''Send [[Yanhamu|Ye((eh))enhamu]] that he may know about the land of the king, [my lord].'''

:(47-51)--'''To the scribe of the king, [my lord: M]essage of 'Abdi-Heba, [your] servant, Offer eloq[uent] words to the king:''' ''I am always, utterly yours.''&lt;sup&gt;7&lt;/sup&gt; '''I am your servant.'''--(text complete Obverse &amp; Reverse, EA 289, minor, restored [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]], (and a small corner of [[clay tablet]] missing), lines 1-51)

Note: The endings of lines 1-4 are the missing corner of the clay tablet letter, and the words-([[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacuna]]s) are replaced by context, and the common style of the 'introductions' of the Amarna letters. Of note, only the obverse of letter EA 289 uses the [[segue]]s of ''Look!'', [[Akkadian language]] ''amāru''.&lt;ref&gt;Parpola, 197l. ''The Standard Babylonian [[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Glossary, pp. 119-145, '''amāru''', p. 122, ''"to see", "behold"''.&lt;/ref&gt; An equivalent use is on the start of the reverse of [[Amarna letter EA 365|EA 365]], for the entire end-story of EA 365. The "segue"-use there is "And Look!",...''"But, Look..."'', using "[[U (cuneiform)|u]]" "amāru"; (only text on a short line, bottom of tablet reverse, very start of the flat reverse side).

An '''anti-proverb''' or a '''perverb''' is the transformation of a standard [[proverb]] for [[humour|humorous]] effect. [[Paremiology|Paremiologist]] [[Wolfgang Mieder]] defines them as "parodied, twisted, or fractured proverbs that reveal humorous or satirical speech play with traditional proverbial wisdom".&lt;ref&gt;p. 28, Mieder, Wolfgang. 2004. ''Proverbs: A Handbook''. (Greenwood Folklore Handbooks). Greenwood Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-proverbs are ancient, [[Aristophanes]] having used one in his play ''[[Peace (play)|Peace]]'', substituting κώẟων 'bell' (in the unique compound "bellfinch") for κύων 'bitch, female dog', twisting the standard and familiar "The hasty bitch gives birth to blind" to "The hasty bellfinch gives birth to blind".&lt;ref&gt;p. 4. Alster, Bendt. 1979. An Akkadian and a Greek proverb. A comparative study. ''Die Welt des Orients'' 10. 1-5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Anti-proverbs have also been defined as "an allusive distortion, parody, misapplication, or unexpected contextualization of a recognized proverb, usually for comic or satiric effect".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;p. xi, Charles Clay Doyle, Wolfgang Mieder, &amp; Fred Shapiro. ''The Dictionary of Modern Proverbs''. New Haven: Yale University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; To have full effect, an anti-proverb must be based on a known proverb. For example, "If at first you don't succeed, quit" is only funny if the hearer knows the standard proverb "If at first you don't succeed, try, try again". Anti-proverbs are used commonly in advertising, such as "Put your burger where your mouth is" from [[Red Robin]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfgang Mieder and Barbara Mieder, 1977, ''Journal of Popular Culture'', 11:308–319.&lt;/ref&gt; Anti-proverbs are also common on T-shirts, such as "Taste makes waist" and "If at first you don't succeed, skydiving is not for you".

Standard proverbs are essentially defined phrases, well known to many people, as e. g. ''Don't bite the hand that feeds you''. When this sequence is deliberately slightly changed ("Don't bite the hand that looks dirty") it becomes an anti-proverb. The relationship between anti-proverbs and proverbs, and a study of how much a proverb can be changed before the resulting anti-proverb is no longer seen as proverbial, are still open topics for research.&lt;ref&gt;p. 166. Barta, Péter.  2009. Proverbial and Anti-Proverbial Variants of "on ne peut pas avoir le beurre et l'argent du beurre."  McKenna, K. J. ed.,  ''The proverbial "Pied piper": a festschrift volume of essays in honor of Wolfgang Mieder on the occasion of his sixty-fifth birthday'', 155–167. New York: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Classification ==

There have been various attempts at classifying different types of anti-proverbs, based on structure and semantics, including by Mieder, Litovkina,&lt;ref&gt;pp. 17–26, Litovkina, Anna Tóthné and Wolfgang Mieder. 2006. ''Old proverbs never die, they just diversify: a collection of anti-proverbs''. Burlington: University of Vermont and  Veszprém, Hungary: Pannonian University of Veszprém.&lt;/ref&gt; and Valdeva.&lt;ref&gt;Valdeva, Tatiana. 2003. Anti-proverbs or new proverbs: The use of English anti-proverbs and their stylistic analysis. ''Proverbium'' 20:379–390.&lt;/ref&gt;  What follows is somewhat synthetic of these.

=== Classification on formal criteria ===
* '''[[Association (psychology)|Association]]:''' The similarity to the original sequence is strong enough to identify it, but there is no further connection: ''The early worm gets picked first''.
* '''Change of [[homonym]]s:''' A word which has several meanings is interpreted in a new way: ''Where there's a will, there's a lawsuit''
* '''Combination:''' Two sequences are combined: ''One brain washes the other''.
* '''[[Permutation]]:''' While keeping the syntactic structure, the words are jumbled: ''A waist is a terrible thing to mind''.
* '''[[Abridgement]]:''' The sequence is cut and thus changed completely: ''All's well that ends.''
* '''[[:wikt:substitution|Substitution]]:''' Parts of the sequence are replaced: ''Absence makes the heart go wander''.
* '''Supplementation:''' A sentence with a contrasting meaning is added to the original sequence: ''A man's home is his castle – let him clean it''.
* '''[[Syntax|Syntactic]] change:''' The semantic structure of the sentence changes while the sequence of words stays the same: ''Men think: "God governs."'' – ''A good man will think of himself: after, all the others.''

=== Classification on content criteria ===
* '''Mitigation:''' The meaning seems kept, but is qualified by the supplement: ''Everything has an end, but a sausage has two''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.greenhorn-germany.com/en/2015/08/04/german-sayings-alles-hat-ein-ende-nur-die-wurst-hat-zwei/|title=German Sayings: Alles hat ein Ende, nur die Wurst hat zwei - Greenhorn Germany|date=2015-08-04|work=Greenhorn Germany|access-date=2018-10-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.
* '''[[Apologetics|Apology]]:''' The original sequence is defended against attacks: German example, translated: ''Art (Kunst) comes from 'able' (können), not from 'will' (wollen), or we'd better call it wirt (Wulst or Wunst,'' fantasy word'').''
* '''Conservation:''' The meaning is similar, with and without the supplement: ''There is no such thing as a free lunch, but there is always free cheese in a mousetrap''.
* '''Break of [[metaphor]]:''' Metaphors are interpreted literally: ''Duty is calling? We call back''.
* '''Neogenesis:''' The meaning of the new sentence is completely independent of the original one: ''An onion a day keeps everybody away''.

=== Types of humorous effects ===
* '''Bisociation:''' This is a technical term coined by [[Arthur Koestler]]. He says that a funny text is situated in two different semantic levels. In the beginning, the hearer or reader is aware of only one of them. In the punch line, the second level comes up so suddenly that they start laughing. The sudden coming up of the second level is the point. For example: ''I only want your best – your money.''
* '''Destruction:''' If the sublime is pulled down to banality, some of us feel validated. Generally, this is funnier than the contrary. Therefore, many humorous transformations are made up this way: ''Jesus may love you – but will he respect you in the morning?''
* '''Fictional catastrophe:''' Unlike real disasters, catastrophes which are only made up or solved in one's mind might be humorous, as can be seen in the quotation: ''The light at the end of the tunnel is only muzzle flash''.

==History==

Anti-proverbs have been used and recognized a long time, though the term "anti-proverb" was not coined until 1982 by Wolfgang Mieder.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The term became more established with the publication of ''Twisted Wisdom: Modern Anti-Proverbs'' by [[Wolfgang Mieder]] and Anna T. Litovkina,&lt;ref&gt;Supplement volume to ''Proverbium''. University of Vermont.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were one of the many experimental styles explored by the [[France|French]] [[literature|literary]] movement [[Oulipo]].  The term '''perverb''' is attributed to [[Maxine Groffsky]].&lt;ref name=parisreview2007&gt;{{cite web |first1=Susannah |last1=Hunnewell |title=Harry Mathews, The Art of Fiction No. 191 |publisher=The Paris Review |url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/5734/the-art-of-fiction-no-191-harry-mathews}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Quin2005&gt;{{cite web |first1=Michael |last1=Quinion |authorlink=Michael Quinion |title=Perverb |publisher=[[World Wide Words]] |url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/weirdwords/ww-per1.htm |accessdate=15 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The concept was popularised by Oulipo collaborator [[Harry Mathews]] in his ''[[Selected Declarations of Dependence]]'' (1977).&lt;ref name=Quin2005/&gt;

==Anti-proverbs in literature==
Some authors have bent and twisted proverbs, creating anti-proverbs, for a variety of literary effects. For example, in the [[Harry Potter]] novels, [[J. K. Rowling]] reshapes a standard English proverb into "It's no good crying over spilt potion" and [[Dumbledore]] advises Harry not to "count your owls before they are delivered".&lt;ref&gt;Heather A. Haas. 2011. The Wisdom of Wizards—and Muggles and Squibs: Proverb Use in the World of Harry Potter. ''Journal of American Folklore'' 124(492): 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

From Nigeria, Adeyemi shows the use of both proverbs and anti-proverbs in ''Rérẹ́ Rún'' by Okediji.
&lt;ref&gt;Lere Adeyemi. 2012. Proverbs and Anti-proverbs in Ọladẹjọ Okediji's Rérẹ́ Rún: A Marxist Perspective. ''Paremia'' 21: 2012, pp. 207–218. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/20-ADEYEMI.pdf Web version of the article]&lt;/ref&gt; Adeyemi believes that they add humor, color and beauty to his writing. But on a political plane, he believes "Anti-proverbs were also used to stimulate critical consciousness in the readers to fight for their rights but with wisdom. The conclusion of the paper was that the conscious manipulation of the so-called fixed proverbs could generate new proverbs, encourage creativity in the writers and expose hidden meanings of proverbs."&lt;ref&gt;p. 207. Lere Adeyemi. 2012. Proverbs and Anti-proverbs in Ọladẹjọ Okediji's Rérẹ́ Rún: A Marxist Perspective. ''Paremia'' 21: 2012, pp. 207–218. [http://www.paremia.org/wp-content/uploads/20-ADEYEMI.pdf Web version of the article]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a slightly different use of reshaping proverbs, in the [[Aubrey–Maturin series]] of historical naval novels by [[Patrick O'Brian]], Capt. [[Jack Aubrey]] humorously mangles and mis-splices proverbs, such as "Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched" and "There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot."&lt;ref name="digitalcommons.usu.edu"&gt;Jan Harold Brunvand. 2004. "The Early Bird Is Worth Two in the Bush": Captain Jack Aubrey's Fractured Proverbs. ''What Goes Around Comes Around: The Circulation of Proverbs in Contemporary Life'', Kimberly J. Lau, Peter Tokofsky, Stephen D. Winick, (eds.), pp. 152–170. Logan, Utah: Utah State University Press. [http://digitalcommons.usu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1032&amp;context=usupress_pubs&amp;sei-redir=1#search=%22What%20Goes%20Around%20Comes%20Around%3A%20Circulation%20Proverbs%20Contemporary%20Life%2C%22 digitalcommons.usu.edu]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variations==

===Splicing two proverbs===
In a slightly different pattern of reshaping proverbs humorously, pieces of multiple proverbs can be spliced together, e.g. "Never count the bear's skin before it is hatched" and "There's a good deal to be said for making hay while the iron is hot."&lt;ref name="digitalcommons.usu.edu"/&gt;

===Garden path proverb===
The term has also been used to describe a [[garden path sentence]] based on a proverb; namely, a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] that starts out like the proverb, but ends in such a way that the listener is forced to back up and [[grammar|re-parse]] several words in order to get its real sense:
* Time flies like to fly around clocks.&lt;br /&gt;("time flies like an arrow" / the habits of "time flies", a fictitious kind of [[fly (insect)|fly]].)

Perverbs beginning with ''Time flies like ...'' are popular examples in [[linguistics]], e.g. to illustrate concepts related to [[syntax]] parsing. These examples are presumably inspired by the quip "[[Time flies like an arrow; fruit flies like a banana|Time flies like the wind; fruit flies like a banana]]", attributed to [[Groucho Marx]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.quoteworld.org/quotes/10009 Groucho Marx quotes] at www.quoteworld.org. Accessed on 2009-08-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

To be effective in written form, a garden-path perverb must have the same spelling and punctuation as the original proverb, up to the point where the reader is supposed to back up, as in the "time flies" example above.  These spelling or punctuation constraints may be relaxed in perverbs that are spoken, rather than written:
* Don't count your chickens will do it for you.&lt;br /&gt;("don't count your chickens before they hatch" / "don't count, your chickens will ...")
* Think before you were born you were already loved.&lt;br /&gt;("think before you act" vs. "think: before you were born, you were ...")
* You can't teach an old dog would be better for your students.&lt;br /&gt;("you can't teach an old dog new tricks" / "you can't teach; an old dog would be ...")

===Proverb with surprising or silly ending===
The term is also used in the weaker sense of any proverb that was modified to have an unexpected, dumb, amusing, or nonsensical ending—even if the changed version is no harder to parse than the original:
* A rolling [[Rock (geology)|stone]] gathers [[momentum]].&lt;br /&gt;("A rolling stone gathers no moss".)
* All that glitters is not dull.&lt;br /&gt;("[[All that glitters is not gold]]".)
* Don't put the [[cart]] before the [[aardvark]].&lt;br /&gt;("Don't put the cart before the [[horse]]".)
* See a [[pin]] and pick it up, and all day long you'll have a pin.&lt;br /&gt;("See a [[pin]] and pick it up, and all day long you'll have good luck".)
* A penny saved is a penny taxed.&lt;br /&gt;("A penny saved is a penny earned".)
* Misery loves bacon.&lt;br /&gt;("Misery loves company.")

The perverb "A rolling stone gathers momentum" (based on the saying by [[Publilius Syrus]]) is moderately popular in technology-minded circles, having been featured in several [[bumper sticker]]s and [[T-shirt]]s.

===Pun on a proverb===
The word has also been used for [[pun]]s on proverbs:&lt;ref name=Quin2005/&gt;
* Slaughter is the best medicine.&lt;br /&gt;("Laughter is the best medicine".)
* Fine swords butter no parsnips.&lt;br /&gt;("Fine words butter no parsnips".)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first1=Michael |last1=Quinion |authorlink=Michael Quinion|url=http://www.worldwidewords.org/qa/qa-but2.htm |title=Butter no parsnips |date=22 June 2002|publisher=[[World Wide Words]]|accessdate=January 17, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* What doesn't kill you makes you stranger.&lt;br /&gt;("What doesn't kill you makes you stronger".)
* Nothing succeeds like excess.&lt;br /&gt;("Nothing succeeds like success".)

{{Further|Self deception|Deception}}

[[Image:Othello and Iago.gif|thumb|right|[[Iago]] (right) and Othello from ''[[Othello]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]].  Much of the tragedy of the play is brought about by advice Iago gives to Othello in bad faith.]]
'''Bad faith''' ([[Latin]]: ''mala fides'') is double mindedness or double heartedness in [[:wikt:duplicity|duplicity]], [[fraud]], or [[deception]].&lt;ref name=WD1913&gt;''"of two hearts ... a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another; bad faith"'', Webster's Dictionary, 1913&lt;/ref&gt; It may involve [[intentionality|intentional]] deceit of others, or [[self-deception]].

The expression "bad faith" is associated with "double heartedness",&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; which is also translated as "double mindedness".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/james/1-8.htm|title=James 1:8 Such a person is double-minded and unstable in all they do|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="P119.113" /&gt; A bad faith belief may be formed through self-deception, being double minded, or "of two minds", which is associated with faith, belief, [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], and [[loyalty]]. In the 1913 ''Webster's Dictionary'', bad faith was equated with being double hearted, "of two hearts", or "a sustained form of deception which consists in entertaining or pretending to entertain one set of feelings, and acting as if influenced by another".&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; The concept is similar to [[perfidy]], or being "without faith", in which deception is achieved when one side in a conflict promises to act in good faith (e.g. by raising a flag of surrender) with the intention of breaking that promise once the enemy has exposed himself. After [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]'s analysis of the concepts of self-deception and bad faith, bad faith has been examined in specialized fields as it pertains to self-deception as two semi-independently acting minds within one mind, with one deceiving the other.

Some examples of bad faith include: a company representative who negotiates with union workers while having no intent of compromising;&lt;ref name="BFN"&gt;"Bad Faith Negotiation," Union Voice, [http://unitas.wordpress.com/2008/12/03/bad-faith-negotiation/].&lt;/ref&gt; a prosecutor who argues a legal position that he knows to be false;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gershman|first1=Bennett L.|title=Bad Faith Exception to Prosecutorial Immunity for Brady Violations|journal=Pace Law Faculty Publications|date=13 January 2010|url=http://digitalcommons.pace.edu/lawfaculty/635|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; an insurer who uses language and reasoning which are deliberately misleading in order to deny a claim.&lt;ref name=lar&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Insurance Company Bad Faith Following Car Accidents|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/car-accidents/insurance-bad-faith.html|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=18 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad faith may be viewed in some cases to not involve deception, as in some kinds of [[hypochondria]] with actual physical manifestations. There is a question about the truth or falsity of statements made in bad faith self-deception; for example, if a hypochondriac makes a complaint about their psychosomatic condition, is it true or false?&lt;ref name=PMREN/&gt;

Bad faith has been used as a term of art in diverse areas involving [[feminism]],&lt;ref&gt;''"'The Look' as Bad Faith"'', ''Philosophy Today'' 36, 3 (1992), Debra B. Bergoffen, pp. 221-227.&lt;/ref&gt; [[racial supremacism]],&lt;ref&gt;''Bad Faith and Antiblack Racism'', L.

==Definition==
People may hold beliefs in their minds even though they are directly contradicted by facts. These are beliefs held in bad faith. But there is debate as to whether this self-deception is [[intentional]] or not.&lt;ref&gt;''"intentional structure of bad-faith"'', ''Good Faith and other essays'', Joseph S. Catalano, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', the philosopher [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] defined bad faith (French: ''mauvaise foi'') as hiding the truth from oneself.&lt;ref name=BN&gt;''Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt; The fundamental question about bad faith self-deception is how it is possible.&lt;ref&gt;''"Self Deception and the Nature of Mind"'', ''Tropisms and Reason'', Perspectives on self-deception, Brian P. McLaughlin editor, [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=p6Psh4rXKTEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA207&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+psychology&amp;ots=H2xGSnT0gC&amp;sig=UozPd8c6ijIz4CPyN9FZm5WnAnw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a liar to successfully lie to the victim of the lie, the liar must know that what is being said is false. In order to be successful at lying, the victim must believe the lie to be true. When a person is in bad faith self-deception, the person is both the liar and the victim of the lie. So at the same time the liar, as liar, believes the lie to be false, and as victim believes it to be true. So there is a contradiction in that a person in bad faith self-deception believes something to be true and false at the same time.&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"&gt;"Self Deception and Bad Faith", Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood, pp. 207-227&lt;/ref&gt; Sartre observed that "the one to whom the lie is told and the one who lies are one and the same person, which means that I must know the truth in my capacity as deceiver, though it is hidden from me in my capacity as the one deceived", adding that "I must know that truth very precisely, in order to hide it from myself the more carefully—and this not at two different moments of temporality ..."

==In theology==
Various commentators and translators have discussed being of two [[beliefs]] or [[faiths]] in being double hearted or double minded.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="P119.113" /&gt; ''Webster's Dictionary'' equates bad faith with "being of two hearts".&lt;ref name=WD1913/&gt; "Double hearted" is translated also as "double minded", or "of two hearts" or "of two minds" or souls, two beliefs, [[Attitude (psychology)|two attitudes]], [[loyalty|two loyalties]], [[mind|two thinkings]], [[belief|two beliefs]], or being as [[Soul (spirit)|two souls]] at the same time. The [[Hebrew Bible]] and the [[New Testament]] [[Epistle]]s admonish religious believers not to be double minded. In [[Psalm 119|Psalms&amp;nbsp;119:113]], one translation is "I hate double-minded men, but I love your law."&lt;ref name="P119.113"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bible.cc/psalms/119-113.htm|title=Psalm 119:113 I hate double-minded people, but I love your law|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Living Translation]] emphasises divided loyalty translating the passage as "I hate those with divided loyalties, but I love your instructions."&lt;ref name="P119.113"/&gt;

The [[Epistle of James]] warns against trusting a person that "perpetually [[self deception|disagrees with ''himself'']]".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; "Taking the Lord's name in vain", bad faith justifies actions known to be wrong by claiming a direction from God or religious authority to take unethical positions or untrue beliefs, when a person ''should'' know otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;"Religion and Morality," Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/].&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on double mindedness in James&amp;nbsp;1 and its relation to [[hypocrisy]] in Matthew&amp;nbsp;6:22, Jamieson-Fausset-Brown Bible Commentary says "double-minded-literally, 'double-souled', the one soul directed towards God, the other to something else ... It is not a hypocrite that is meant, but a fickle, 'wavering' man, as the context shows".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[Henry Alford|Alford's]] translation of the Bible uses the ancient Greek literature's "waverer" to express "double minded".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;

In James 1:8, it denotes instability of a cognitive [[Attitude (psychology)|attitude]], "he is a double-minded man, unstable in attitude". In the [[God's Word Translation]], "a person who has doubts is thinking about two different things at the same time and can't make up his mind about anything".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[Young's Literal Translation]] translates this as being "two souled".&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; In Clarke's Commentary on the Bible, a double-minded man is one of two souls in that one is for earth, and the other for heaven, wishing to secure both worlds at once.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt; [[John Gill (theologian)|Gill's]] exposition of the Bible refers to asking for one thing and meaning another, honoring in word but not in heart, confused in the mind.&lt;ref name="J3:16JFBBC"/&gt;

[[Clarke's commentary on the Bible]] commented on Deuteronomy 26:17 and [[Jewish theology]] regarding being double hearted, in that Rabbi Tanchum (fol. 84) remarked, "Behold, the Scripture exhorts the Israelites, and tells them when they pray, that they should not have two hearts, one for the holy blessed God, and one for something else."&lt;ref name="James"&gt;[https://www.studylight.org/commentaries/acc/james-1.html James 1 Commentary.]&lt;/ref&gt; Clarke comments that "James refers to those Jews who were endeavoring to incorporate the law with the Gospel, who were divided in their minds and affections, not willing to give up the Levitical rites, and yet unwilling to renounce the Gospel. Such persons could make no progress in Divine things."&lt;ref name="James" /&gt;

The [[Catholic Church]] does not consider everyone with heretical views to have bad faith: for example, people who earnestly seek the truth and lead exemplary lives.&lt;ref&gt;''An Introductory Dictionary of Theology and Religious Studies'', Orlando O. Espín and James B. Nickoloff, p.551, [https://books.google.com/books?id=k85JKr1OXcQC&amp;pg=PA551&amp;lpg=PA551&amp;dq=%22bad+faith%22+Theology&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=31M2KNLajc&amp;sig=PKjISREYwlrVOR941GCeTtlbeHs&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y4RATbipCo_CsAPN6qyUCA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22bad%20faith%22&amp;f=false].&lt;/ref&gt;

==In philosophy, psychology, and psychoanalysis==

===Freudian psychoanalysis===
[[Freudian psychoanalysis]] answers how bad faith self-deception is made possible by postulating an unconscious dimension of our being that is amoral, whereas the [[conscious]] is in fact regulated by morality, law, and custom, accomplished by what Freud calls [[Psychological repression|repression]].&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"/&gt; The true desires of the subconscious express themselves as [[wish fulfillment]] in dreams, or as an ethical position unconsciously taken to satisfy the wishes of the unconscious mind.&lt;ref name="Self Deception pp. 207-227"/&gt;

===Ethics, phenomenology, existentialism===
{{Further|Ethics of belief|Authenticity (philosophy)|Bad faith (existentialism)}}
Bad faith [[wish fulfillment]] is central to the [[ethics of belief]], which discusses questions at the intersection of [[epistemology]], [[philosophy of mind]], [[psychology]], Freudian [[psychoanalysis]], and [[ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, Journal of Value Inquiry 91, 339–347, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Life of Irony and the Ethics of Belief'', David Wisdo, SUNY, Albany, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"psychological strategies such as ..."bad faith"... become germane in the ethics of belief", ''Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Self Deception Unmasked'', Alfred R. Mele, Princeton, NJ: Princeton, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who is not lying to himself is [[Authenticity (philosophy)|authentic]]. "Authenticity" is being faithful to internal rather than external ideas.

Bad faith in ethics may be when an unethical position is taken as ethical, and justified by appeal to being forced to that belief as an excuse, e.g., by God or by that person's natural disposition due to genetics, even though facts disconfirm that belief and [[honesty]] would require it.&lt;ref&gt;''"... required by honesty, and to hide this from ourselves is 'bad faith'. One form of bad faith is to pretend that there is a God who is giving us our tasks. Another is to pretend that there is a 'human nature' that is doing the same thing"'', ''Religion and Morality'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/religion-morality/]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] plays a role leading to discussions of bad faith. It has a role in ethics by an analysis of the structure of [[Will (philosophy)|will]], valuing, happiness, and care for others (in [[empathy]] and [[sympathy]]). Phenomenologist [[Heidegger]] discussed care, [[conscience]], and [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]], moving to "[[authenticity (philosophy)|authenticity]]", which in turn led to the [[feminism]] of [[Simone de Beauvoir]] and existentialism of [[Jean-Paul Sartre]], both based on phenomenology's considerations of authenticity and its role in bad faith. Sartre analyzed the logical problem of "bad faith" as it relates to authenticity, and where he developed an ontology of value as produced by willing in [[good faith]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/phenomenology/|title=Phenomenology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sartre and de Beauvoir at Balzac Memorial.jpg|right|thumb|150 px|Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into existentialism]]
Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir developed ideas about bad faith into [[Bad faith (existentialism)|existentialism]], using the concepts of bad faith and "authenticity" in the ethics of belief.&lt;ref&gt;''"The 'ethics of belief' refers to a cluster of questions at the intersection of epistemology, philosophy of mind, psychology, and ethics ... central ... is ... bad faith wish-fulfillment ..."'', ''The Ethics of Belief'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; In ''[[Being and Nothingness]]'', Sartre begins his discussion of bad faith by raising the question of how bad faith self-delusion is possible.&lt;ref name=BN/&gt; Sartre calls "bad faith" a kind of project of self-deception. In order to produce excuses, bad faith first takes a third-person stance toward itself. When it becomes necessary to elude this stance it has made of itself, it then adopts the first-person perspective. In neither case can the deception fully succeed. Without these two facets of existence, if [[consciousness]] was unitary and not divisible, as in the indivisible "I" in "[[I think, therefore I am]]", it would be impossible to explain how the very project of self-deception could be possible. The Freudian theory of the unconscious is viewed by Sartre as based on an incoherent view of consciousness, but the project of psychoanalysis as an uncovering of the "fundamental project" of an individual's life is considered to be valid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/existentialism/notes.html|title=Existentialism &gt; Notes (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Existentialist]] philosopher Jean-Paul Sartre called the belief that there is something intrinsically good in itself, which is inherent in the world as absolute value and is discoverable by people, the "[[spirit of seriousness]]", which he argued leads to bad faith. He argued that people fall into the spirit of [[seriousness]] because they take their values too seriously, and forget that values are contingent, chosen and assigned subjectively.&lt;ref&gt;"Spirit of Seriousness", The Blackwell Dictionary of Western Philosophy, NICHOLAS BUNNIN and JIYUAN YU, editors, [http://www.blackwellreference.com/public/tocnode?id=g9781405106795_chunk_g978140510679520_ss1-185]&lt;/ref&gt; In Sartre's words, "the spirit of seriousness has two characteristics: it considers values as [[transcendence (philosophy)|transcendent]] ''givens'',  independent of human subjectivity, and it transfers the quality of 'desirable' from the [[ontological]] structure of things to their simple material constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Being and Nothingness, Jean-Paul Sartre&lt;/ref&gt;

Psychologists have proposed answers as to how bad faith self-delusion can be possible.&lt;ref&gt;"Self Deception and Bad Faith", Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P. McLaughlin ed., Alan W. Wood&lt;/ref&gt;

A "tropism" is an action done without conscious thought.&lt;ref&gt;''"action done without cognitive thought"'', Websters Dictionary Online, [http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tropism]&lt;/ref&gt; While self-deception may be a tropism, not consciously done, it may be guided by "projects" one may set for one's life, such as a desire for personal pleasure, wealth, power, or to get into heaven. For example, a creationist has a project to get into heaven, and a racist with feelings of personal inadequacy may have a project to be superior or to have power over some others. The project may create self-deception without conscious thought, as a tropism creates action without conscious thought. A project may be selfish, and overwhelm reason from facts, though its consequences are not directly intentional. But the project itself may be intentionally sought, and in a selfish way, whence bad faith arises, as a result of selfish or bad intention in choice of project.&lt;ref name="SDNM"&gt;''"Self Deception and the Nature of Mind"'', ''Tropisms and Reason'', Perspectives on Self Deception, Brian P.

A [[homunculus]] is a little person (or map of the person) inside a person, and homuncularism is the theory in psychology that there are subsystems of the mind performing different operations; the homuncularist answer to the question as to how bad faith is possible is that one such subunit deceives the other.&lt;ref&gt;''"There is a natural homuncularist response to this surface paradox of self deception. Distinct subsystems that play the distinct role of deceiver and deceived are located within the self deceiver. So no single subject of belief is required to both believe (know) a proposition and not believe (know) it."'', Self Deception and the Nature of Mind, ''"Tropisms and Reason''", ''Perspectives on Self Deception'', Brian P.

Within the [[pseudoscience]] of racial eugenics, bad faith is proposed to be a motivator for self-defensive action against an objectified race of people to justifiably uphold a desire for racial supremacy; e.g., a minority group of whites who believe that blacks are inferior in bad faith to motivate the preservation of their white-race differences, while their faith is motivated in fear of elimination from within a volatile racial environment.&lt;ref&gt;''"... bad faith can be defined as fleeing a displeasing truth for a pleasing falsehood.

===Zen Buddhism===
Persons practicing [[Zen]] claim not to be subject to the "bad faith" in "self-deception", since they do not ''explain'' a motivation for action, as a [[rationalist]] would; a rationalist must rationalize an irrational desire that is actually rooted in the body and the unconscious as if it were not.&lt;ref&gt;''"Japanese Zen Buddhist Philosophy"'', ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Analytical philosophy and the error theory of moral statements===
For philosophers in the Anglo-American [[Analytic philosophy|analytical]] tradition statements involving moral values have caused concern because of their similarity to statements about objects and events in the physical world. Compare:
#Littering is commonplace in Chiang Mai
#Littering is wrong

Both have the same grammatical structure, but the way we might verify the first is quite different from the way we might want to verify the second. We can verify the first statement by observations made in the physical world, but, according to [[David Hume]], no amount of physical world observation can verify statements of the second type. Hume's view is summarized as "you can not derive ought from is". Whereas statements of the first type must be true or false, some philosophers have argued that moral statement are neither true nor false. [[Richard M. Hare]], for example, argues that moral statements are in fact imperatives (commands). For him the statement "littering is wrong" means "do not litter", and "do not litter" is neither true nor false.

In sharp contrast to people like Hare, [[J.L. Mackie]] contended that moral statements are false. Mackie's view discomforts [[Crispin Wright]] who says that it "relegates moral discourse to bad faith".&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/realism/ Miller, Alexander ''Realism'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; Wright is not saying that all moral statements are bad faith. What he is saying is that if Mackie is correct, and somebody believes that Mackie is correct, then that person will be guilty of bad faith whenever he makes a moral statement.

==In law==
In law, there are inconsistent definitions of bad faith, with one definition much more broad than used in other fields of study discussed in the above sections. ''[[Black's Law Dictionary]]'' equates [[fraud]] with bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;definition of "bad faith", Black's Law Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt; But one goes to jail for fraud, and not necessarily for bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;''Rocking Chair Plaza v Brampton'', 1988 29 CPC 2d 82, Duhaime online Legal Dictionary, [http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx]&lt;/ref&gt; The Duhaime online law dictionary similarly defines bad faith broadly as "intent to deceive", and "a person who intentionally tries to deceive or mislead another in order to gain some advantage".&lt;ref name="duhaime1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duhaime.org/LegalDictionary/B/BadFaith.aspx|title=Bad Faith Definition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Canadian labor arbitrator wrote, in one case, that bad faith is related to rationality in reasoning, as it is used in other fields, but is ill-defined in the law.&lt;ref name="duhaime1"/&gt;

{{quote|The concept of bad faith is likely not capable of precise calibration and certainly has not been defined in the same way by all adjudicators. At its core, bad faith implies malice or ''ill will''. A decision made in bad faith is ''grounded, not on a rational connection between the circumstances and the outcome, but on antipathy toward the individual for non-rational reasons'' ... The absence of a rational basis for the decision implies that factors other than those relevant were considered. In that sense, a decision in bad faith is also arbitrary. These comments are not intended to put to rest the debate over the definition of bad faith. Rather, it is to point out that bad faith, which has its core in malice and ill will, at least touches, if not wholly embraces, the related concepts of ''unreasonableness'', discrimination and arbitrariness.}}
What was called "Canada's best judicial definition of 'bad faith{{'"}} by ''Duhaime's Legal Dictionary'' is similarly more consistent with use in other fields discussed above.&lt;ref&gt;''Collins v Transport &amp; Allied Worker's Union'', 1991, 6 CPC 3d 206, Newfoundland, Duhaime Legal Dictionary&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Good faith and its opposite, bad faith, imports a ''subjective state of mind'', the former ''motivated by'' honesty of purpose and the latter by ''ill-will''.}}

Duhaime also refers to another description, "... bad faith refers to a subjective state of mind ... motivated by ill will ... or even ''sinister purposes''."&lt;ref name="duhaime1"/&gt;

The current standard legal definition of "bad faith" in the law of England and Wales is that of Lindsay J in Gromax Plasticulture Ltd. v. Don and Low Nonwovens Ltd: "Plainly it includes dishonesty and, as I would hold, includes also some dealings which fall short of the standards of acceptable commercial behaviour observed by reasonable and experienced men in the particular area being examined. Parliament has wisely not attempted to explain in detail what is or is not bad faith in this context; how far a dealing must so fall-short in order to amount to bad faith is a matter best left to be adjudged not by some paraphrase by the Courts (which leads to the danger of the Courts then construing not the Act but the paraphrase) but by reference to the words of the Act and upon a regard to all material surrounding circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Patents/1998/316.html|title=Gromax Plasticulture Ltd v. Don &amp; Low Nonwovens Ltd [1998] EWHC Patents 316 (12th June, 1998)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Insurance bad faith===
{{Main|Insurance bad faith}}
[[Insurance bad faith]] is a [[tort]] claim that an insured may have against an insurer for its bad acts, e.g. intentionally denying a claim by giving spurious citations of exemptions in the policy to mislead an insured, adjusting the claim in a dishonest manner, failing to quickly process a claim, or other intentional misconduct in claims processing.&lt;ref&gt;"The tort of bad faith in first-party insurance transactions after two decades," Roger C. Henderson, [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?collection=journals&amp;handle=hein.journals/arz37&amp;div=64&amp;id=&amp;page=].&lt;/ref&gt; Insurance bad faith has been broadened beyond use in other fields to include total inaction, a refusal to respond to a claim in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bad Faith Claims Address Insurer Violations|url=https://www.ohiobar.org/ForPublic/Resources/LawYouCanUse/Pages/LawYouCanUse-696.aspx|website=Ohio State Bar Association|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Courts can award [[Punitive damages|punitive or exemplary damages]], over and above actual damages against any insurance company which is found to have adjusted a claim in bad faith; the damages may be awarded with the aim of deterring such behavior among insurers in general, and may far exceed the amount of the damage due under the [[insurance policy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fair Claims Settlement Practices Regulations|url=http://www.insurance.ca.gov/01-consumers/130-laws-regs-hearings/05-CCR/fair-claims-regs.cfm|website=California Department of Insurance|accessdate=19 March 2018|date=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Canada]], one case of this type resulted in a record punitive award of [[Canadian dollar|CAD]] $1 million when an [[insurance company]] pressed a claim for [[arson]] even after its own experts and adjusters had come to the conclusion that the fire was accidental; the company was advised by legal counsel that the desperate insured parties would be willing to settle for much less than what they were owed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2002/2002scc18/2002scc18.html|title=CanLII - 2002 SCC 18 (CanLII)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In social sciences==

===Feminism===
Central to [[feminism]] is the idea that women are systematically subordinated, and bad faith exists when women surrender their [[agency (philosophy)|agency]] to this subordination, e.g., acceptance of religious beliefs that a man is the dominant party in a marriage by the will of God; Simone de Beauvoir labels such women "mutilated" and "[[immanent]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Look as Bad Faith'', Debra B. Bergoffen, Philosophy Today 36, 3 (1992), 221-227&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"It argues, with Simone de Beauvoir, that patriarchal marriage is both a perversion of the meaning of the couple and an institution in transition"'', Marriage, Autonomy, and the Feminine Protest'', Hypatia, Volume 14, Number 4, Fall 1999, pp. 18-35, [http://muse.jhu.edu/login?uri=/journals/hypatia/v014/14.4bergoffen.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"mutilated ... immanent ... ''", ''The Second Sex'', [[Simone de Beauvoir]], H.M. Parshley (Trans), Vintage Press, 1952&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"... women are systematically subordinated ... de Beauvoir labels women "mutilated" and "immanent"...  women succumb to 'bad faith' and surrender their agency ...", Feminist Perspectives on the Self, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; Simone de Beauvoir developed modern conceptions of bad faith and modern feminism together in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]''.&lt;ref name=SS&gt;''The Second Sex, Simone de Beauvoir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory of justice===
Bad faith is important to the concept of [[original position]] in [[John Rawls]]' [[A Theory of Justice|theory of justice]], where mutual commitment of the parties requires that the parties cannot choose and agree to principles in bad faith, in that they have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice; a party cannot take risks with principles he knows he will have difficulty voluntarily complying with, or they would be making an agreement in bad faith which is ruled out by the conditions of the original position.&lt;ref&gt;''"Rawls ... parties ... cannot choose and agree to principles in 'bad faith' ... have to be able, not just to live with and grudgingly accept, but to sincerely endorse the principles of justice ..."'', ''Original Position'', Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/original-position/]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negotiation theory===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-27106-0001, Paris, Verhandlungen über NATO-Beitritt.jpg|right|thumb|200 px|U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles used an "inherent bad faith" model when negotiating with the Soviet Union in International relations.]]

Bad faith is a concept in [[negotiation theory]] whereby parties pretend to reason to reach settlement, but have no intention to do so, for example, one political party may pretend to negotiate, with no intention to compromise, for political effect.&lt;ref name=BFN/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"negotiating in bad faith"'', example of use of "bad faith" from definition in Oxford Online Dictionary, [http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/bad+faith]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bad faith in [[political science]] and [[political psychology]] refers to negotiating strategies in which there is no real intention to reach compromise, or a model of [[information processing]].&lt;ref name="oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt; The "[[inherent bad faith model]]" of information processing is a theory in political psychology that was first put forth by [[Ole Holsti]] to explain the relationship between U.S. Secretary of State [[John Foster Dulles]]' beliefs and his model of information processing.&lt;ref&gt;''"The 'Inherent Bad Fatih Model' Reconsidered: Dulles, Kennedy, and Kissinger"'', ''Political Psychology'', Douglas Stuart and Harvey Starr, [https://www.jstor.org/pss/3791139]&lt;/ref&gt; It is the most widely studied model of one's opponent.&lt;ref name="HSP"&gt;''"... the most widely studied is the inherent bad faith model of one's opponent ..."'', ''The handbook of social psychology'', Volumes 1-2, edited by Daniel T. Gilbert, Susan T. Fiske, Gardner Lindzey&lt;/ref&gt; A state is presumed to be implacably hostile, and contra-indicators of this are ignored. They are dismissed as propaganda ploys or signs of weakness. Examples are John Foster Dulles' position regarding the Soviet Union, or Israel's initial position on the [[Palestinian Liberation Organization]].&lt;ref name=HSP/&gt;

===Loyalty and patriotism===
Bad faith is associated with being double minded, or of divided loyalty. (See [[#In theology|theology section above]].)

The philosophy of [[loyalty]] examines unchosen loyalties, e.g., one does not choose one's family or country, but when there is excessive wrongdoing, there is a general unwillingness to question these unchosen loyalties, and this exhibits bad faith as a type of lack of [[integrity]]; once we have such loyalties, we are resistant to their scrutiny and self-defensively discount challenges to them in bad faith.&lt;ref name="PBF"&gt;''"Patriotism as Bad Faith"'',''Ethics'', 115, Simon Keller, pp. 563–92, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/loyalty/|title=Loyalty|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the philosophy of [[patriotism]] (loyalty to one's country) bad faith is hiding from oneself the true source of some of one's patriotic beliefs, such as when one fights for a racist [[totalitarian dictatorship]] against a free and [[egalitarian]] democracy.&lt;ref name=PBF/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''"This leads her to hide from herself the true source of some of the beliefs involved. This is bad faith."'', Patriotism, Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/patriotism/]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''biological patent''' is a [[patent]] on an [[invention]] in the field of [[biology]] that by law allows the patent holder to exclude others from making, using, selling, or importing the protected invention for [[term of patent|a limited period of time]]. The scope and reach of biological patents vary among jurisdictions,&lt;ref name="GEN"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.genengnews.com/insight-and-intelligenceand153/gene-patents-in-europe-relatively-stable-despite-uncertainty-in-the-u-s/77899385/ | title=Gene Patents in Europe Relatively Stable Despite Uncertainty in the U.S. | work=Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology News | date=2011-03-23 | accessdate=2013-06-13 | author=Sharples, Andrew}}&lt;/ref&gt; and may include biological technology and products, [[genetically modified organisms]] and [[genetic material]]. The applicability of patents to substances and processes wholly or partially natural in origin is a subject of debate.&lt;ref name="GEN"/&gt;

==Biological patents in different jurisdictions==

===Australia===
In February 2013, Judge Justice [[John Nicholas (judge)|John Nicholas]] ruled in the [[Federal Court of Australia]] in favour of a [[Myriad Genetics]] patent on the [[BRCA1]] gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Landmark patent ruling over breast cancer gene BRCA1|date = February 15, 2013|last = Corderoy|first = Amy|url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/health/landmark-patent-ruling-over-breast-cancer-gene-brca1-20130215-2egsq.html|accessdate = June 14, 2013|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a landmark ruling, affirming the validity of patents on naturally occurring [[DNA]] sequences. However, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] came to the opposite conclusion only a few months later.  The Australian ruling has been appealed to the Full Bench of the Federal Court; submissions in the case include consideration of the U.S. Supreme Court ruling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = BRCA1 gene patent ruling to be appealed|date = March 4, 2013|last = Corderoy|first = Amy|url = http://www.smh.com.au/national/brca1-gene-patent-ruling-to-be-appealed-20130304-2fg1f.html|accessdate = June 14, 2013|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title = Companies can't patent genes, US court rules|date = June 14, 2013|last = Corderoy|first = Amy|url = http://www.smh.com.au/technology/sci-tech/companies-cant-patent-genes-us-court-rules-20130614-2o836.html|accessdate = June 14, 2013|newspaper = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This decision was decided in 2014, affirming Nicholas J's decision in favor of Myriad, confirming that isolated genetic material ([[gene]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s) are valid subjects of patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timebase.com.au/news/2014/AT499-article.html |title=Full Federal Court Upholds Gene Patents: D’Arcy v Myriad Genetics Inc [2014] FCAFC 115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of June 2015 the case was pending hearing in the [[High Court of Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hcourt.gov.au/cases/case_s28-2015 |title=D'Arcy v.

===Europe===
[[European Union]] directive [[Directive 98/44/EC|98/44/EC]] (the ''Biotech Directive'') reconciled the legislation of biological patents among certain countries under the jurisdiction of the [[European Patent Organisation]].&lt;ref name=GEN/&gt; It allows for the patenting of natural biological products, including [[DNA sequencing|gene sequences]], as long as they are "isolated from [their] natural environment or produced by means of a technical process."&lt;ref name=GEN/&gt;

The [[European Patent Office]] has [[G 2/06|ruled]] that European patents cannot be granted for processes that involve the destruction of human [[embryo]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.epo.org/epo/pubs/oj009/05_09/05_3069.pdf Decision G2/06 of 25 November 2008, WARF/Stem Cells] (OJ EPO 2009, 306).

===Japan===
Under the umbrella of [[biotechnology]], applications for patents on biological inventions are examined according to general guidelines for patents. In response to requests for additional clarity, the [[Japan Patent Office]] (JPO) set forth specific guidelines for biology-related inventions. Over the years, the JPO has continued to amend these guidelines to clarify their application to new technologies. These amendments have broadened the scope of patents within the biotechnology industry. The [[Japanese Patent Act]] requires that patented inventions be “industrially applicable”, i.e. they must have market or commercial potential. The JPO explicitly lists “medical activities” among inventions that fall outside the scope of industrially applicable inventions, meaning that methods of surgery, therapy, and the diagnosis of human diseases cannot be patented.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://sugi.pat.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WIPR-2013-Annual_Page_1.pdf | format = PDF | title = iPS Cell Technology Spurs Biological Patenting in Japan | publisher = [[World Intellectual Property Review]] | date = May 2013 | access-date = 2013-08-06 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235917/http://sugi.pat.co.jp/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/WIPR-2013-Annual_Page_1.pdf | archive-date = 2013-12-30 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{main|Biological patents in the United States}}
In the United States, up until 2013 natural biological substances themselves could have been patented (apart from any associated process or usage) if they were sufficiently "isolated" from their naturally occurring states. Prominent historical examples of such patents include those on [[adrenaline]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | vauthors = Crouch D | title = Guest Post: Myriad Misunderstanding of Parke-Davis v.

== Ethics ==
The patenting of [[genes]] is a controversial issue in terms of [[bioethics]]. Some believe it is unethical to patent genetic material because it treats life as a [[commodity]], or that it undermines the dignity of people and animals by allowing ownership of genes.&lt;ref name=two&gt;Dresser R. 1988. Ethical and Legal Issues in Patenting New Animal Life. Jurimetrics 28:399-435&lt;/ref&gt; Some say that living materials occur naturally, and therefore cannot be patented.&lt;ref name=one&gt;Marchant GE. 2007. Genomics, Ethics, and Intellectual Property. Intellectual Property Management in Health and Agricultural Innovation: A Handbook of Best Practices. Ch 1.5:29-38&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Medical Association]]'s stance is that gene patents inhibit access to genetic testing for patients and hinder research on genetic disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-science/genetics-molecular-medicine/related-policy-topics/gene-patenting.page?|title=Gene Patenting|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While some feel that a patent on living material is unethical, others{{who|date=November 2013}} believe that not allowing patents on biotechnological inventions would also be unethical. Supporters of this idea suggest that patents allow the public, as well as [[Policy-makers|policy makers]], to hold the owner of the patent(s) accountable. They favor biological patents because they require disclosure of information to the public.&lt;ref name=three&gt;Caulfield TA, Gold ER. 2000. Genetic Testing. Ethical Concerns, and the Role of Patent Law. Clinical Genetics 57:370-75&lt;/ref&gt; Agreements such as the [[Agreement on Trade-related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights]] (TRIPS) require members of the [[World Trade Organization]] (WTO) to have intellectual property protection laws in place for most biological innovation{{Why|date=October 2018}}, making it unlikely that many countries will prohibit patents on genes altogether.&lt;ref name=one /&gt; Some {{who|date=November 2013}} say that patenting genes only commodifies life if a patent applies to an entire human being, arguing that{{who|date=November 2013}} patents on single body parts do not violate [[human dignity]].&lt;ref name=four&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Resnik | first1 = DB | year = 2001 | title = DNA Patents and Human dignity | url = | journal = The Journal of Law, Medicine &amp; Ethics | volume = 29 | issue = 1| pages = 152–165 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another area of controversy in genetic patenting is how gene samples are obtained. Prior consent is required to collect genetic samples, and collection of samples from people requires consent at the national and community levels as well as the individual level. Conflicts have resulted when consent is not obtained at all three levels. The question of benefit sharing also arises when obtaining genetic samples, specifically the potential responsibility of the collector to share any benefits or profits of the discoveries with the population or person from whom the sample came.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

The last major ethical issue involving gene patents is how the patents are used post-issuance. A major concern {{who|date=November 2013}} is that the use of patented materials and processes will be very expensive or even prohibited to some degree by conditions the patent owner sets.&lt;ref name=five&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Andrews | first1 = LB | year = 2000 | title = Genes and Patent Policy: Rethinking IP Rights | url = | journal = Nature Reviews Genetics | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 803–8 | doi=10.1038/nrg909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Limiting access like this would directly impact agricultural institutes and university researchers, among others. Some {{who|date=November 2013}} fear that holders of biotechnology patents would exploit their rights in order to make larger profits, at the potential expense of farmers, healthcare patients, and other users of patented technologies.

The ethics of using patents to increase profits are also debated. A typical argument in favor of biotech patents is that they enable companies to earn money that the companies in turn invest in further research. Without these patents, some worry that companies would no longer have the resources or motives to perform competitive, viable biotech research.&lt;ref name=one /&gt;

'''Blue laws''', also known as '''Sunday laws''', are laws designed to restrict or ban some or all Sunday activities for religious reasons, particularly to promote the observance of a day of worship or rest. Blue laws may also restrict shopping or ban sale of certain items on specific days, most often on Sundays in the western world. Blue laws are enforced in parts of the United States and Canada as well as some European countries, particularly in Austria, Germany, Switzerland, and Norway, keeping most stores closed on Sundays.

In the United States, the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] has held blue laws as constitutional numerous times, citing [[secular]] bases such as securing a day of rest for mail carriers,&lt;ref name="Fuller2010"/&gt; as well as protecting workers and families, in turn contributing to societal stability and guaranteeing the [[free exercise of religion]].&lt;ref name="Goldberg2000"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smith2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name="O'FlahertyPetersen2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Flaherty|first1=Edward|last2=Petersen|first2=Rodney L.|last3=Norton|first3=Timothy A.|title=Sunday, Sabbath, and the Weekend: Managing Time in a Global Culture|date=7 September 2010|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|language=English|isbn=9780802865830|page=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the blue laws also partially stems from religion, particularly the prohibition of [[Sabbath desecration]] in Christian Churches following the [[first-day Sabbatarian]] tradition. Both [[labour unions]] and [[trade associations]] have historically supported the legislation of blue laws.&lt;ref name="Goldberg2000"/&gt; Most blue laws have been repealed in the United States, although Indiana banned the sale of [[alcoholic beverages]] on Sundays until repealed on February 28, 2018, and many states ban selling cars on Sundays.

==History==
The very first known law regarding prohibition of Sunday labor for religious reasons was in (321, by Emperor Constantine) 538 at the [[Third Council of Orléans]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://biblelight.net/sunday.htm|title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (New York: Scribner, 1928)|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first occurrence of the phrase ''blue laws'' so far found is in the ''New-York Mercury'' of March 3, 1755, where the writer imagines a future newspaper praising the revival of "our [[Connecticut]]'s [[Blue Laws (Connecticut)|old Blue Laws]]". In his 1781 book ''General History of Connecticut'', the Reverend [[Samuel Peters]] (1735–1826) used it to describe various laws first enacted by [[Puritan]] colonies in the 17th century that prohibited various activities, recreational as well as commercial, on Sunday (Saturday evening through Sunday night). Sometimes the sale of certain types of merchandise was prohibited, and in some cases all retail and business activity.

Contrary to popular belief, there is no evidence that blue laws were originally printed on blue paper. Rather, the word ''blue'' was used in the 17th century as a disparaging reference to rigid moral codes and those who observed them, particularly in ''blue-stocking'', a reference to [[Oliver Cromwell]]'s supporters in the parliament of 1653.&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, although Reverend Peters claimed that the term ''blue law'' was originally used by Puritan colonists, his work has since been found to be unreliable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/language/colors/bluelaws.htm Snopes.com: American "blue laws" were so named because they were originally printed on blue paper.]. Retrieved July 12, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In any event, Peters never asserted that the blue laws were originally printed on blue paper, and this has come to be regarded as an example of [[false etymology]], another version of which is that the laws were first bound in books with blue covers.

As Protestant moral reformers organized the Sabbath reform in nineteenth-century America, calls for the enactment and enforcement of stricter Sunday laws developed. Numerous Americans were arrested for working, keeping an open shop, drinking alcohol, traveling, and recreating on Sundays. Erwin Fahlbusch and Geoffrey William Bromiley write that throughout their existence, organizations advocating [[first-day Sabbatarianism]], such as the [[Lord's Day Alliance]] in North America and the [[Lord's Day Observance Society]] in the British Isles, were supported by [[labor unions]] in lobbying "to prevent secular and commercial interests from hampering freedom of worship and from exploiting workers."&lt;ref name="FahlbuschBromiley2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fahlbusch|first1=Erwin|last2=Bromiley|first2=Geoffrey William|title=The Encyclopedia of Christianity|year=2005|publisher=Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing|isbn=9780802824165|page=787}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the [[United States Congress]] was supported by the Lord's Day Alliance in securing "a day of rest for city postal clerks whose hours of labor, unlike those of city mail carriers, were largely unregulated."&lt;ref name="Fuller2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Wayne E.|title=Morality and the Mail in Nineteenth-Century America|date=1 October 2010|publisher=University of Illinois Press|language=English|isbn=9780252091353|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, the ''Ligue du Dimanche'', a Roman Catholic Sunday league, supported the [[Lord's Day Act]] in 1923 and promoted first-day Sabbatarian legislation.&lt;ref name="2005Roy"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roy|first=Christian|title=Traditional Festivals: A Multicultural Encyclopedia|year=2005|publisher=ABC-CLIO|language=English|isbn=9781576070895|page=457|quote=However, an amendment was made that left is enforcement to the discretion of the provinces, so that it remained a dead letter in mostly French Quebec.

For fourteen years the League agitated for Sabbatarian legislation, particularly against cinemas ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in the 1840s, workingmen, Jews, Seventh Day Baptists, free-thinkers, and other groups began to organize opposition. Throughout the century, Sunday laws served as a major source of church-state controversy and as an issue that drove the emergence of modern American minority-rights politics.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle G. Volk (2014), ''[https://www.amazon.com/Moral-Minorities-Making-American-Democracy/dp/0199371911/ Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy]''. New York: Oxford University Press. {{ISBN|019937192X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the more recent ''[[Dies Domini]]'', written by [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1998, advocates Sunday legislation in that it protects civil servants and workers; the North Dakota Catholic Conference in 2011 likewise maintained that blue laws, in accordance with the Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church, "ensure that, for reasons of economic productivity, citizens are not denied time for rest and divine worship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://religiousliberty.tv/north-dakota-catholic-conference-says-sunday-law-benefits-all-people-ewtn-news.html|title=North Dakota Catholic Conference says 'Sunday law' Benefits All People|date=19 September 2011|publisher=EWTN News|language=English|accessdate=5 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]], while acknowledging the partial religious origin of blue laws, acknowledged their "secular purpose they served by providing a benefit to workers at the same time that they enhanced labor productivity."&lt;ref name="Goldberg2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goldberg|first=Steven|title=Seduced by Science: How American Religion Has Lost Its Way|year=2000|publisher=NYU Press|language=English|isbn=9780814731055|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many European countries{{which|date=January 2013}} still place strong restrictions on store opening hours on Sundays, an example being Germany's [[Ladenschlussgesetz]].

==Canada==
[[File:Ontario Sunday Laws.jpg|thumb|right|Sunday Laws in Ontario, 1911]]
The Lord's Day Act, which since 1906 had prohibited business transactions from taking place on Sundays, was declared unconstitutional in the 1985 case ''[[R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.]]'' Calgary police officers witnessed several transactions at the Big M Drug Mart, all of which occurred on a Sunday. Big M was charged with a violation of the Lord's Day Act. A provincial court ruled that the Lord's Day Act was unconstitutional, but the Crown proceeded to appeal all the way to the [[Supreme Court of Canada]]. In a unanimous 6–0 decision, the Lord's Day Act was ruled an infringement of the freedom of conscience and religion defined in section 2(a) of the [[Charter of Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1985/1985canlii69/1985canlii69.html |title=CanLII – 1985 CanLII 69 (S.C.C.) |publisher=Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII.org) |date=September 3, 2009 |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110509175904/http://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1985/1985canlii69/1985canlii69.html |archivedate=May 9, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Toronto referendum in 1950 allowed only team sports to be played professionally on Sunday. Theatre performances, movie screenings, and horse racing were not permitted until the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/full-comment/allan-levine-never-mind-ford-nation-hogtown-has-a-long-history-of-drunks-tyrants-and-loudmouths-running-city-hall|title=Allan Levine: Never mind Ford Nation. Hogtown has a long history of drunks, tyrants and loudmouths running City Hall|publisher=|accessdate=February 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Supreme Court later concluded, in ''[[R. v. Edwards Books and Art Ltd.]]'', [1986] (2 S.C.R. 713) that Ontario's Retail Business Holiday Act, which required some Sunday closings, did not violate the Charter because it did not have a religious purpose. Nonetheless, as of today, virtually all provincial Sunday Closing laws have ceased to exist. Some were struck down by provincial courts, but most were simply abrogated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Raynault-Ollu |first1=Louis-Philippe |title=Sunday Observance Laws in North America |journal=SSRN Electronic Journal |date=2012 |doi=10.2139/ssrn.2260582 |url=https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2260582 |language=en |issn=1556-5068|ssrn=2260582}}&lt;/ref&gt; often due to competitive reasons where out-of-province or foreign merchants were open.

==Cook Islands, Tonga and Niue==
In the [[Cook Islands]], blue laws were the first written legislation, enacted by the [[London Missionary Society]] in 1827, with the consent of ''[[Ali'i|ariki]]'' (chiefs). In [[Tonga]], the [[Vava'u Code]] (1839) was inspired by [[Methodism|Methodist]] [[missionary]] teachings, and was a form of blue law. In [[Niue]], certain activities remain forbidden on Sunday, reflecting [[History of Niue|the country's history]] of observing Christian Sabbath tradition.

==Denmark==
In [[Denmark]] the closing laws restricting retail trade on Sundays have been abolished with effect from October 1, 2012. From then on retail trade is only restricted on public holidays (New Years Day, [[Maundy Thursday]], Good Friday, Easter Sunday, Easter Monday, Day of Prayer, Ascension Day, Whit Sunday, Whit Monday, Christmas Day and Boxing Day) and on Constitution Day, Christmas Eve and New Year's Eve (on New Year's Eve from 3&amp;nbsp;pm only). On these days almost all shops will remain closed. Exempt are bakeries, DIYs, garden centres, gas stations and smaller supermarkets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite act|url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=132057|title=Lov om ændring af lov om detailsalg fra butikker m.v. - Liberalisering af reglerne om åbningstid |trans-title=Act Amending the Law on Retail Sales from Shops, etc. - Liberalization of the Rules on Opening Hours|number= 543 |date=26 May 2010 |publisher=Danish Civil Protection Agency - retsinformation.dk|accessdate=23 September 2018|language=Danish|article-type=amendment}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==England and Wales==

===Before 1994===
Prior to 1994, trading laws forbade sale of certain products on a Sunday; the distinction between those that could and could not be sold was increasingly seen as arbitrary, and the laws were inadequately enforced and widely flouted. For example, some supermarkets would treat the relatively modest fines arising as a business cost and open nonetheless.

===Since 1994===
The [[Sunday Trading Act 1994]] relaxed restrictions on Sunday trading. This produced vocal opposition from bodies such as the Keep Sunday Special campaign, and the [[Lord's Day Observance Society]]: on religious grounds, on the grounds that it would increase consumerism, and that it would reduce shop assistants' weekend leisure time.

The legislation permits large shops (those with a relevant floor area in excess of 280 square metres) to open for up to six hours on Sunday between the hours of 10&amp;nbsp;am and 6&amp;nbsp;pm. Small shops, those with an area of below 280 square metres, are free to set their own Sunday trading times. Some large shops, such as off-licences, service stations and garages, are exempt from the restrictions.

Some very large shops (e.g. department stores) open for longer than 6 hours on a Sunday by allowing customers in to browse 30 minutes prior to allowing them to make a purchase, since the 6 hour restriction only applies to time during which the shop may make sales.

Christmas Day and Easter Sunday are non-trading days. This applies even to garden centres, which earlier had been trading over Easter, but not to small shops (those with an area of below 280 square metres).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.uk/trading-hours-for-retailers-the-law|title=Trading hours for retailers: the law|publisher=|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Poland==
{{See also|Sunday shopping#Poland}}
Since 2007, blue laws were enacted and resulted in stores closing on the [[Public holidays in Poland|13 state holidays]] in [[Poland]] - these are both religious and secular days of rest. In 2014, an initiative by the [[Law and Justice]] party failed to pass the reading in the [[Sejm]] to ban trading on Sundays and state holidays. 
However, since 2018, the ruling government and the President of Poland has signed a law that restricts store trading from 1st March 2018 to the first and last Sunday of the month, [[Palm Sunday]], the 3rd and 4th [[Advent]] Sundays, as well as trading until 14.00 for [[Easter Saturday]] and [[Christmas Eve]].
This will change in 2019 to trading permitted solely on the last Sunday of the month, as well as [[Palm Sunday]], the 3rd and 4th [[Advent]] Sundays, as well as trading until 14.00 for [[Easter Saturday]] and [[Christmas Eve]].
From 2020, stores may only be open on 7 Sundays in the year: [[Palm Sunday]], the 3rd and 4th [[Advent]] Sundays, the last Sunday of January, April, June and August as well as trading until 14.00 for [[Easter Saturday]] and [[Christmas Eve]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/ap-poland-limits-sunday-shopping-to-benefit-family-life-2018-1|title=Poland limits Sunday shopping to benefit family life|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=January 30, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
{{main|Blue laws in the United States}}
In the United States, judges have defended blue laws "in terms of their secular benefit to workers", holding that "the laws were essential to social well-being".&lt;ref name="Smith2003"/&gt; Chief Justice [[Stephen Johnson Field]], with regard to Sunday blue laws, stated:&lt;ref name="Smith2003"/&gt;
{{quotation|Its requirement is a cessation from labor. In its enactment, the legislature has given the sanction of law to a rule of conduct, which the entire civilized world recognizes as essential to the physical and moral well-being of society. Upon no subject is there such a concurrence of opinion, among philosophers, moralists and statesmen of all nations, as on the necessity of periodical cessation from labor. One day in seven is the rule, founded in experience and sustained by science. ... The prohibition of secular business on Sunday is advocated on the ground that by it the general welfare is advanced, labor protected, and the moral and physical well-being of society promoted.|''Hennington v. Georgia'', 163 U.S. 299 [1896]&lt;ref name="Smith2003"&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Christian|title=The Secular Revolution: Power, Interests, and Conflict in the Secularization of American Public Life|year=2003|publisher=University of California Press|language=English |isbn=9780520230002|page=319}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Many states prohibit selling [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] for on and off-premises sales in one form or another on Sundays at some restricted time, under the idea that people should be in church on Sunday morning, or at least not drinking.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.alcoholproblemsandsolutions.org/Controversies/Alcohol-Blue-Laws.html|title=Alcohol Blue Laws (Laws Prohibiting Sunday Sales of Alcoholic Beverages)|last=Ph.D.|first=Prof. David J. Hanson,|language=en-US|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goupstate.com/news/20160924/gaffney-churches-seek-to-stop-sunday-alcohol-sales|title=Gaffney churches seek to stop Sunday alcohol sales|last=Montgomery|first=Bob|access-date=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another feature of [[blue laws in the United States]] restricts the purchase of particular items on Sundays. Some of these laws restrict the ability to buy cars, groceries, office supplies, and housewares among other things. Though most of these laws have been relaxed or repealed in most states, they are still enforced in some other states.

In Texas, for example, blue laws prohibited selling housewares such as pots, pans, and washing machines on Sunday until 1985. In [[Colorado]], [[Illinois]], [[Indiana]], [[Iowa]], [[Louisiana]], [[Maine]], [[Minnesota]], [[Missouri]], [[Oklahoma]], [[New Jersey]], [[North Dakota]], [[Pennsylvania]], and [[Wisconsin]], car dealerships continue to operate under blue-law prohibitions in which an automobile may not be purchased or traded on a Sunday. [[Maryland]] permits Sunday automobile sales only in the counties of [[Charles County, Maryland|Charles]], [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's]], [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery]], and [[Howard County, Maryland|Howard]]; similarly, [[Michigan]] restricts Sunday sales to only those counties with a population of less than 130,000. Texas and [[Utah]] prohibit car dealerships from operating over consecutive weekend days. In some cases these laws were created or retained with the support of those whom they affected, to allow them a day off each week without fear of their competitors still being open.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wcco.com/consumer/local_story_324235359.html Good Question: Why Can't We Buy Alcohol On Sunday?], [[WCCO-TV]], November 20, 2006  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929084311/http://wcco.com/consumer/local_story_324235359.html |date=September 29, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blue laws may also prohibit retail activity on days other than Sunday. In [[Massachusetts]], [[Rhode Island]], and [[Maine]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mainelegislature.org/legis/statutes/17/title17sec3204.html|title=Title 17, §3204: Business, traveling or recreation on Sunday|publisher=|accessdate=January 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; for example, blue laws prohibit most retail stores, including grocery stores, from opening on [[Thanksgiving]] and Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/editorials/articles/2006/11/25/a_turkey_of_a_blue_law/ "A turkey of a blue law"], ''[[Boston Globe]]''. Retrieved November 25, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Research regarding the effect of the repeal of blue laws has been conducted, with Professor Elesha Coffman of [[Baylor University]] writing:&lt;ref name="Coffman2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/2009/february/bye-bye-blue-laws.html|title=Bye-Bye, Blue Laws?|last=Coffman|first=Elesha|year=2009|publisher=[[Christianity Today]]|language=English|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quotation|Regarding culture, the impact of vanishing blue laws could be larger. A study in New Mexico in 2006 found a sharp increase in drunken driving on Sundays after that state dropped its Sunday ban on packaged alcohol sales. A broader study published by MIT and Notre Dame economists in 2008 found that the repeal of blue laws led to decreased church attendance, decreased donations to churches, and increased alcohol and drug use among religious individuals. These wide-ranging effects cannot easily be pinpointed to specific causes, but one of the latter study's authors, Daniel Hungerman, suggested to ''[[Christianity Today]]'' that blue laws might have been fulfilling their original intent, to keep people pious.&lt;ref name="Coffman2009"/&gt;}}

===Court cases===
Beginning in the mid-19th century, religious and ethno-cultural minorities arrested for violating state and local blue laws appealed their convictions to state supreme courts. In ''Specht v. Commonwealth'' (1848), for example, German Seventh Day Baptists in Pennsylvania employed attorney [[Thaddeus Stevens]] to challenge the constitutionality of Pennsylvania's Sunday law. As in cases in other states, litigants pointed to the provisions of state constitutions protecting religious liberty and maintained that Sunday laws were a blatant violation. Though typically unsuccessful (most state supreme courts upheld the constitutionality of Sunday laws), these constitutional challenges helped set a pattern by which subsequent moral minorities would seek to protect religious freedom and minority rights.&lt;ref&gt;Kyle G. Volk, ''Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy'' (Oxford, 2014), 59-68, 190-201.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Supreme Court of the United States]] held in its landmark case, ''[[McGowan v. Maryland]]'' (1961), that [[Maryland]]'s blue laws violated neither the [[Free Exercise Clause]] nor the [[Establishment Clause]] of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]]. It approved the state's blue law restricting commercial activities on Sunday, noting that while such laws originated to encourage [[church attendance|attendance at Christian churches]], the contemporary Maryland laws were intended to serve "to provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens" on a secular basis and to promote the secular values of "health, safety, recreation, and general well-being" through a common day of rest. That this day coincides with [[Christian Sabbath]] is not a bar to the state's secular goals; it neither reduces its effectiveness for secular purposes nor prevents adherents of other religions from observing their own holy days.&lt;ref&gt;[http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=366&amp;invol=420 McGOWAN v. MARYLAND, 366 U.S. 420 (1961)], [[Supreme Court of the United States]], Decided May 29, 1961. Retrieved August 10, 2007. "The present purpose and effect of most of our Sunday Closing Laws is to provide a uniform day of rest for all citizens; and the fact that this day is Sunday, a day of particular significance for the dominant Christian sects, does not bar the State from achieving its secular goals."&lt;/ref&gt;

There were four landmark Sunday-law cases altogether in 1961. The other three were ''[[Gallagher v. Crown Kosher Super Market of Mass., Inc.]]'', 366 U.S. 617 (1961); ''[[Braunfeld v. Brown]]'', 366 U.S. 599 (1961); ''Two Guys from Harrison vs. McGinley'', 366 U.S. 582 (1961).&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldincrisis.org/NSLC/NSLC-9.htm The LANDMARK Cases], National Sunday Law Crisis. Retrieved May 21, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Chief Justice [[Earl Warren]] declared that "the State seeks to set one day apart from all others as a day of rest, repose, recreation and tranquility--a day which all members of the family and community have the opportunity to spend and enjoy together, a day on which there exists relative quiet and disassociation from the everyday intensity of commercial activities, a day on which people may visit friends and relative who are not available during working days."&lt;ref name="Goldberg2000"/&gt;

In March 2006, Texas judges upheld the state blue law that requires car dealerships to close either Saturday or Sunday each weekend.&lt;ref name="kvia.com"&gt;[http://www.kvia.com/Global/story.asp?S=4669315 "'Blue Law' for car sales upheld by Judge"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531032841/http://www.kvia.com/Global/story.asp?S=4669315 |date=May 31, 2008 }}, [[KVIA]], March 22, 2006. Retrieved May 28, 2008. "A Texas judge has upheld an old law that requires car dealerships in the Lone Star state to close one day each weekend. They must now choose to open either Saturday or Sunday."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Bonekickers''''' was a [[BBC]] drama about a team of archaeologists, set at the fictional Wessex University.&lt;ref name="Bath"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bath.ac.uk/news/2008/7/7/bonekickers.html|title=University-based BBC1 drama Bonekickers to be aired tonight |work=Internal News|publisher=University of Bath|accessdate=2008-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It made its début on 8 July [[2008 in television|2008]] and ran for one series.

It was written by ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' and ''[[Ashes to Ashes (TV series)|Ashes to Ashes]]'' creators [[Matthew Graham]] and [[Ashley Pharoah]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2008/06_june/13/bonekickers_1.shtml History comes alive in Bonekickers – new "groundbreaking" drama for BBC One], BBC press release, 13 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It was produced by Michele Buck and [[Damien Timmer]] of [[Mammoth Screen Ltd]] and co-produced with Monastic Productions.  Archaeologist and [[Bristol University]] academic [[Mark Horton (archaeologist)|Mark Horton]] acted as the series' archaeological consultant.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvscoop.tv/2008/06/first_look_bone.html First Look: Bonekickers, the BBC's new 'Time Team meets Indiana Jones' drama series], TV Scoop&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Lester has described the programme as "''[[CSI (franchise)|CSI]]'' meets ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' [...] There's an element of the crime procedural show, there's science, conspiracy theories—and there's a big underlying mystery that goes through the whole six-episode series."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Much of the series was filmed in the [[City of Bath]], [[Somerset]], with locations including the [[University of Bath|University of Bath campus]] (which does not offer Archaeology courses).&lt;ref name="Bath"/&gt;  Additional locations included [[Brean Down Fort]] and [[Kings Weston House]] (both for episode 2), [[Chavenage House]] for episodes 5 &amp; 6 and [[Sheldon Manor]].

On 21 November 2008 [[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]] magazine revealed the show would not be returning for a second series.&lt;ref name="Broadcast"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2008/11/bbc1_drops_bonekickers.html|title=BBC1 drops Bonekickers|date=21 November 2008|work=Broadcast|accessdate=2008-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
* Dr Gillian Magwilde – the team's head archaeologist, played by [[Julie Graham]]. Magwilde, a powerful, confident women is not afraid to take charge. When it comes to her relationship with the team she is less domineering, and goes with her instincts. Her attitude to Viv is a little waspish but as time progresses, she sees a lot of herself in Viv which is why she pushes her so hard.
* Vivienne "Viv" Davis – young and promising archaeologist played by [[Gugu Mbatha-Raw]]. Her eagerness to work and learn always seem to be checked by Dr Magwilde. Her potential is flourishing and her capabilities are equal to any of her teammates. The only thing holding her back is experience, the one thing that she is forced to gain fast.
* Dr Ben Ergha – played by [[Adrian Lester]] is a main character. Ergha is a young, established archaeologist in the group. He is more welcoming of Viv to the group, compared to the others he is the only one prepared to help her fit in. As a prominent character, much of the plot is seen through his eyes.
* Professor Gregory "Dolly" Parton – the experienced and older male archaeologist played by [[Hugh Bonneville]]. Parton is the voice of wisdom and insight. At times he keeps to himself while working away, but gets involved when needed. Parton is highly respected, laid-back and valued member of the team who will step in to focus the group in important situations.
* Professor Daniel Mastiff – played by [[Michael Maloney]].

''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Gareth McLean described the show as "mind-bogglingly dreadful", with "lame characters delivering abysmal lines",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = McLean| first = Gareth| title = Watch this| work = [[Guardian Unlimited]]| accessdate = 2008-07-08| date = 2008-07-08| url = https://www.theguardian.com/tv_and_radio/story/0,,2289681,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=media
}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Chater of ''[[The Times]]'' thought it "rubbish",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Chater| first = David| title = Roman Mysteries – Bonekickers – Imagine: Anthony Minghella| work = [[Times Online]]| accessdate = 2008-07-08| date = 2008-07-08| url = http://entertainment.timesonline.co.uk/tol/arts_and_entertainment/tv_and_radio/article4288554.ece | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s Thomas Sutcliffe found it laughable and full of absurdities, while also observing that "Professor Magwilde's approach to archaeology is unconventional. She likes to squat at the edge of the trench and mutter urgently, 'Come on! Give up your secrets!'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Sutcliffe| first = Thomas| title = Last Night's TV: Bonekickers, BBC1| work = [[The Independent]]| accessdate = 2008-07-09| date = 2008-07-09| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/film-and-tv/tv-radio-reviews/last-nights-tv-bonekickers-bbc1-imagine-bbc1-862886.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[BBC Two]]'s ''[[Newsnight Review]]'', the author [[Kate Mosse]] asserted it would be "great for teenagers", while the academic and critic [[Sarah Churchwell]] said the  "execution [was] appalling" and that it was "beyond silly"; [[John Mullan]] likewise criticised the show's absurdities, saying that "Hokum has to have its own logic".&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{Cite episode| title = Newsnight Review| location = iPlayer| accessdate = 2008-07-07| date = 2008-07-04| minutes = 30 mins}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Statesman described it as "dramatic goo".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/television/2008/07/lab-rats-bbc2-university The Call of the Weird], ''[[New Statesman]]'', 10 July 2008 - accessed 10 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some reviews were slightly more positive - Patricia Wynn Davies of ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' wrote that while lacking in subtlety, the episode had an "action-packed conclusion",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Davies| first = Patricia Wynn| title = Tuesday's TV &amp; radio choices| work = [[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]| accessdate = 2008-07-08| date = 2008-07-08| url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?view=DETAILS&amp;grid=&amp;xml=/arts/2008/07/08/nosplit/bvtv08.xml}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lucy Mangan in the ''Guardian'' criticised the episode as "arrant nonsense" and "a clattering bag of madness" and found its characters too "shouty", but praised Paul Rhys and overall concluded that the episode was "utterly bonkers but curiously satisfying" and that, as for the series, "keeping the faith for a few more weeks might well pay off".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Lucy|last=Mangan|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jul/09/television|title=Last night's TV|date=9 July 2008|accessdate=2008-07-16|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic reception===
In line with the broadly negative reviews, the reception amongst the academic community was mixed, with different complaints around technical accuracy. [[Mark Horton (archaeologist)|Mark Horton]], the academic advisor to the script, answered criticisms on the BRITARCH e-mail list.&lt;ref&gt;JISCMail - BRITARCH Archives - http://www.jiscmail.ac.uk/cgi-bin/webadmin?A2=ind0807&amp;L=britarch&amp;T=0&amp;F=&amp;S=&amp;P=13436&lt;/ref&gt;

===Viewer complaints===
A scene in the first episode which depicted a Muslim's beheading by an extremist Christian drew 100 complaints.  The BBC expressed "regret" that some viewers had found the scene "inappropriate", but defended the decision to show it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1732">'''Bookbreaking''' is the longstanding practice of removing pages (especially those containing [[map]]s or [[illustration]]s) from [[book]]s, especially from rare books. Bookbreaking is most often motivated by a [[Market (economics)|market]] situation in which the maps or illustrations in a book will have more value sold separately than the value of the intact book. Often this happens because book collectors judge minor defects in an old book so harshly as to make them seemingly unsaleable.  This widespread practice probably peaked in the 1970s or 1980s, because the price for old [[engraving]]s and especially for old maps was outstripping that of rare books. However—in part because so many rare, illustrated books were "broken" in this manner—the price of the intact books has now risen the point where an old book is typically worth more intact. Book collectors have also become more sophisticated in understanding minor condition problems.

The term ''bookbreaking'' is not usually used to refer to outright theft, where the bookbreaker does not own the book in question. There have been many cases of theft of illustrations—again, especially maps—from rare books in [[library|libraries]].

{{voting}}
'''Compulsory voting''' is an effect of laws which require eligible citizens to register and vote in [[election]]s, and may impose penalties on those who fail to do so. {{As of|2013|8}}, 22 countries provide for compulsory voting, and 11 democracies — about 5% of all United Nations members — enforce it.&lt;ref name="World Factbook: Suffrage"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/fields/2123.html World Factbook: Suffrage] at [[Central Intelligence Agency]]. Retrieved 16 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Athenian democracy]] held that it was every [[citizen]]'s duty to participate in decision making, but attendance at the assembly was voluntary. Sometimes there was some form of social [[wiktionary:opprobrium|opprobrium]] to those not participating. For example, [[Aristophanes]]'s comedy ''[[Acharnians]]'' 17–22, in the 5th century BC, shows public slaves herding citizens from the [[agora]] into the assembly meeting place (''[[Pnyx]]'') with a red-stained rope. Those with red on their clothes were fined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWO2BQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=malkopoulou&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=malkopoulou&amp;f=false|title=The History of Compulsory Voting in Europe: Democracy's Duty?|first=Anthoula|last=Malkopoulou|date=5 December 2014|publisher=Routledge|accessdate=28 March 2018|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; This usually happened if fewer than 6,000 people were in attendance, and more were needed for the assembly to continue.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NWO2BQAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=malkopoulou&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=malkopoulou&amp;f=false Ibid.] pp.49-52&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Belgium]] has the oldest existing compulsory voting system. Compulsory voting was introduced in 1893 for men&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=1010372|title=Compulsory Voting in Belgium|first=A.|last=Nerincx|date=28 March 2018|publisher=|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=18|pages=87–90|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1948 for women, following universal female suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/icon/article/12/1/4/628588|title=The achievement of female suffrage in Europe: on women's citizenship|first=R.|last=Rubio-Marin|date=1 January 2014|publisher=|journal=International Journal of Constitutional Law|volume=12|issue=1|pages=4–34|accessdate=28 March 2018|doi=10.1093/icon/mot067}}&lt;/ref&gt; Belgians aged 18 and over and registered non-Belgian voters are obliged to present themselves in their polling station; while they don't have to cast a vote, those who fail to present themselves (without proper justification, or having appointed a proxy) at their polling station on election Sunday can face prosecution and a moderate fine. If they fail to vote in at least four elections, they can lose the right to vote for 10 years. Non-voters also might face difficulties getting a job in the public sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/jul/04/voterapathy.uk|title=Compulsory voting around the world|first=Elliot|last=Frankal|date=4 July 2005|website=the Guardian|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Australia]] introduced compulsory enrolment for voting at federal elections in 1912, 11 years after independence from its colonial parent [[United Kingdom|Great Britain]]; the State of [[Queensland]] imposed compulsory marking against name on the voting register at a polling station at state elections some three years later, the first of Australia's six states to do so. It is not compulsory to vote after having one's name marked on the voter list. At that time both men and women were afforded the right to vote, a liberty which (in [[South Australia]] and [[Western Australia]]) preceded official independence from Great Britain. However, voting rights were confined to British subjects 21 years of age and over who were qualified to vote in state elections specifically. Compulsory voting for national elections was introduced in Australia in 1924, following a pronounced fall in turnout at the 1922 federal election. Moreover, in the states of Queensland and Western Australia, indigenous Australians were specifically disqualified, even though they were officially recognised as British subjects. Voting for Aboriginal Australians was introduced in 1949, but enrolment and having one's name marked on the voting register was not compulsory for indigenous Australians until 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/righttovote.htm|title=The Right to Vote in Australia|first=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=Queen Victoria Terrace, Parkes ACT 2600; contact=13 23|last=26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for==
Compulsory voting is a generalised view that democratic election of governing representatives is the responsibility of citizens, rather than a right afforded citizens constitutionally to nominate representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/voting/files/compulsory-voting.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; Equating in kind to similar civil responsibilities such as taxation, [[jury duty]], compulsory education or military service, voting in these democracies is regarded as one of the "duties to community" mentioned in the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights|United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/voting/index.htm]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110217024646/http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/voting/index.htm|date=February 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This view asserts that, by introducing an obligation to vote, all citizens governed by a democracy partake in the responsibility for the government appointed by democratic election. In practice, this appears to produce governments with more stability, [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] and a genuine [[mandate (politics)|mandate]] to govern, which in turn benefits all individuals even if an individual voter's  preferred candidate or party is not elected to power.

This notion is especially reinforced when both men and women are required to vote, and further sustained by diligent enforcement of laws requiring registration of all eligible voters (deemed adult, and without exclusion of any significant community within the population).

The idea that compulsory voting results in a higher degree of [[Legitimacy (political)|political legitimacy]] is based on higher [[voter turnout]].&lt;ref&gt;Levine, Jonathan [http://nationalinterest.org/commentary/the-case-compulsory-voting-7691 The Case for Compulsory Voting], ''[[The National Interest]]'' 2 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Referring back to the Australian experience, voluntary voting prior to 1924 accounted between 47% and 78% turnout of eligible voters. Following the introduction of compulsory federal voting in 1924, this figure jumped to between 91% and 96%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Australian_Electoral_History/Voter_Turnout.htm#fn|title=Who voted in previous referendums and elections|first=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=Queen Victoria Terrace, Parkes ACT 2600; contact=13 23|last=26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with only 5% of eligible voters accounted as not enrolled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/Elections/Federal_Elections/2016/key-facts.htm|title=2016 federal election Key facts and figures|first=corporateName=Australian Electoral Commission; address=50 Marcus Clarke Street, Canberra ACT 2600; contact=13 23|last=26|website=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Venezuela and the Netherlands are countries that have moved from compulsory voting to voluntary participation.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The last Dutch compulsory election was in 1967.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Turnout in the subsequent national poll decreased by around 20%.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} Venezuela saw a drop in attendance of 30% in 1993 once compulsion was removed.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}

Supporters of compulsory voting also argue that voting addresses the [[paradox of voting]], which is that for a rational, self-interested voter, the costs of voting will normally exceed the expected benefits. The paradox disproportionately affects the socially disadvantaged, for whom the costs of voting tend to be greater. Australian academic and supporter of compulsory voting, [[Lisa Hill (political scientist)|Lisa Hill]], has argued that a [[prisoner's dilemma]] situation arises under voluntary systems for marginalised citizens: it seems rational for them to abstain from voting, under the assumption that others in their situation are also doing so, in order to conserve their limited resources. However, since these are people who have a pronounced need for representation, this decision is irrational. Hill argues that the introduction of compulsory voting removes this dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;Hill, L 2002 ‘On the reasonableness of compelling citizens to ‘vote’: The Australian case’, Political Studies, vol. 50, no. 1, pp.88-89&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the advent of contemporary technology could preserve the integrity of secret balloting, whilst at the same time ensure a compelled voter casts a valid vote, which could further legitimise the absolute accuracy of ballots. In cases when the distribution of votes is very close, the elimination of the invalid vote of the resentful voter may be crucial in determining the outcome. For example, if a voter is presented with a stand-alone touch-screen device, the integrity of the secret ballot is preserved yet the participant is unable to bypass their compulsory obligation: the device computer software must register a valid option before it progresses to its function of printing a paper copy of the voter's choice, while the electoral law is adjusted so that the voter cannot be registered as legitimate until they produce a paper copy of their vote and insert it into an official ballot box.

Supporters of compulsory voting also argue that the [[secret ballot]] is designed to prevent interference with the votes actually cast, compelling voters to the polls for an election removes interference with accessing a polling place, reducing the impact that external factors such as the weather, transport, or restrictive employers might have. If everybody must vote, restrictions on voting are identified and steps are taken to remove them.

The impact of technology and recent social trends are indicating a growing voter preference towards pre-polling: where the voter fulfils their obligation more at their own convenience prior to polling day rather than trying to arrange release from their responsibilities on the nominated date of polling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theconversation.com/why-more-and-more-australians-are-voting-before-election-day-37159|title=Why more and more Australians are voting before election day|first=Nathaniel|last=Reader|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other perceived advantages to compulsory voting are the stimulation of broader interest politics, as a sort of civil education and political stimulation, which creates a better informed population, although no studies have been undertaken to demonstrate that the populations of Belgium or Australia for instance, where compulsory voting has long existed, are better informed and more politically aware than the populations of New Zealand, France, Canada or the Scandinavian countries, where voting has never been compulsory.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} It is also argued that since campaign funds are not needed to goad voters to the polls, the role of money in politics decreases.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} With non-compulsory voting, the ability of a [[political machine]] to [[Getting out the vote|get out the vote]] of its supporters may influence the outcome.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} High levels of participation decreases the risk of political instability created by crises or charismatic but sectionally focused demagogues.&lt;ref name="lijph"&gt;Lijphart, Arend (1997) [http://www.escholarship.org/uc/item/13n5q9qx "Unequal Participation: Democracy's Unresolved Dilemma"], ''The American Political Science Review'' 91(1): 8–11, (Subscription required for full access.)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 Inter-American Development Bank working paper purported to show that there was a correlation between compulsory voting, when enforced strictly, and improved income distribution, as measured by the [[Gini coefficient]] and the bottom income quintiles of the population.&lt;ref&gt;Chong, Alberto and Olivera, Mauricio, [http://www.iadb.org/en/research-and-data/publication-details,3169.html?pub_id=wp-533 "On Compulsory Voting and Income Inequality in a Cross-Section of Countries"], Inter-American Development Bank Working Paper, May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, a more recent Conference Board of Canada study on World income inequality — also relying on the Gini index — shows that income inequality is lowest in the Scandinavian countries, where compulsory voting has never existed, while Australia, and to a lesser extent Belgium, which strictly enforces their compulsory voting legislation, have a higher income inequality level than a number of other Western countries, such as Canada, France, Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands, where compulsory voting does not exist.&lt;ref&gt;Income Inequality, mid-1990s and late 2000s table. http://www.conferenceboard.ca/hcp/hot-topics/worldinequality.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Monash University]] political scientist [[Waleed Aly]] argues that whether compulsory voting favors the right or the left is beside the point, because the most beneficial aspect of compulsory voting is that it will improve the caliber of individuals who run for office and the quality of the decisions that they make: "In a compulsory election, it does not pay to energize your base to the exclusion of all other voters. Since elections cannot be determined by turnout, they are decided by swing voters and won in the center... That is one reason Australia’s version of the far right lacks anything like the power of its European or American counterparts. Australia has had some bad governments, but it hasn’t had any truly extreme ones and it isn’t nearly as vulnerable to demagogues."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/19/opinion/voting-should-be-mandatory.html|title=Voting Should Be Mandatory|last=Aly|first=Waleed|date=2017-01-19|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2017-01-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments against==
Voting may be seen as a civic right rather than a civic duty. While citizens may exercise their civil rights (free speech, right to an attorney, etc.) they are not compelled to.  Furthermore, compulsory voting may infringe other rights. For example, most [[Christadelphians]] believe that they should not participate in political events. Forcing them to vote ostensibly denies them their freedom of religious practice. [[Jehovah's Witnesses]] view voting as a personal decision to be made based on each one's conscience and understanding of their responsibility to God and to the Government. Many Witnesses do not vote, while taking care to preserve neutrality and not compromise their faith.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=The Watchtower|date=November 1, 1999|pages=28–29|quote=As to whether they will personally vote for someone running in an election, each one of Jehovah’s Witnesses makes a decision based on his Bible-trained conscience and an understanding of his responsibility to God and to the State...In view of the Scriptural principles outlined above, in many lands Jehovah’s Witnesses make a personal decision to stay politically neutral in elections, and their freedom to make that decision is supported by the law of the land. What, though, if the law requires citizens to vote? In such a case, each Witness is responsible to make a conscientious, a Bible-based decision. If someone decides to go to the polling booth, that is his decision. What he does in the polling booth is between him and his Creator...There may be people who are stumbled when they observe that during an election in their country, some Witnesses of Jehovah go to the polling booth and others do not. They may say, ‘Jehovah’s Witnesses are not consistent.’ People should recognize, though, that in matters of individual conscience such as this, each Christian has to make his own decision before Jehovah God.—Romans 14:12. Whatever personal decisions Jehovah’s Witnesses make in the face of different situations, they take care to preserve their Christian neutrality and freeness of speech. In all things, they rely on Jehovah God to strengthen them, give them wisdom, and help them avoid compromising their faith in any way. Thus they show confidence in the words of the psalmist: “You are my crag and my stronghold; and for the sake of your name you will lead me and conduct me.”—Psalm 31:3.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The law can also allow people to give a valid reason for why they did not vote.

Another argument against compulsory voting, prevalent among legal scholars in the United States, is that it is essentially a compelled speech act, which violates [[freedom of speech]] because the freedom to speak necessarily includes the freedom ''not'' to speak.&lt;ref&gt;Note, ''The Case for Compulsory Voting in the [[United States]]'', 121 Harv. L. Rev. 591, 601–603  (2007). Harvard is one of several law schools at which students may submit articles for publication in the school's [[law review]] but only anonymously in the form of "Notes" (with a capital "N").&lt;/ref&gt;

Some do not support the idea of voters being compelled to vote for candidates they have no interest in or knowledge of. Others may be well-informed, but have no preference for any particular candidate, or may have no wish to give support to the incumbent political system. In compulsory voting areas, such people often vote at random simply to fulfill legal requirements: the so-called [[donkey vote]] may account for sufficient percentage which has the potential to change the result in close races. ([[Robson rotation]] can be used to distribute the donkey vote equally among all candidates, however.) Similarly, citizens may vote with a complete absence of knowledge of any of the candidates or deliberately skew their ballot to slow the polling process and disrupt the election, or vote for frivolous or jokey candidates. Such arguments are frequently aired in Brazil, where opposition to compulsory voting has increased from 43% in 2008 to 61% in 2014 and where two out of ten voters have abstained from voting in recent{{vague|date=August 2017}} elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=In Brazil, Citizens Are Split Over Mandatory Voting|date=24 November 2014|url=https://www.wsj.com/video/in-brazil-citizens-are-split-over-mandatory-voting/B5F9D069-1BEA-4E2B-A977-3FE3B007399E.html|language=en-US|accessdate=23 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
A study of a Swiss canton where compulsory voting was enforced found that compulsory voting significantly increased electoral support for leftist policy positions in referenda by up to 20 percentage points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Does Compulsory Voting Increase Support for Leftist Policy?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ajps.12224/abstract|journal = American Journal of Political Science|date = 2015-10-01|issn = 1540-5907|pages = 752–767|doi = 10.1111/ajps.12224|first = Michael M.|last = Bechtel|first2 = Dominik|last2 = Hangartner|first3 = Lukas|last3 = Schmid|volume=60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study found that the effects of universal turnout in the United States would likely be small in national elections, but that universal turnout could matter in close elections, such as the presidential elections of [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = If Everyone Had Voted, Would Bubba and Dubya Have Won?|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1741-5705.2008.02659.x/abstract|journal = Presidential Studies Quarterly|date = 2008-09-01|issn = 1741-5705|pages = 521–539|volume = 38|issue = 3|doi = 10.1111/j.1741-5705.2008.02659.x|first = John|last = Sides|first2 = Eric|last2 = Schickler|first3 = Jack|last3 = Citrin}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, Democrats would most likely fare better under universal voting (as nonvoters are generally more Democratic) but due to the dearth of close races in the United States, universal voting would change "very few election outcomes."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Citrin|first=Jack|last2=Schickler|first2=Eric|last3=Sides|first3=John|date=2003-01-01|title=What if Everyone Voted?

==Current use by countries==
{{As of|2013|8}}, 22 countries were recorded as having compulsory voting.&lt;ref name="World Factbook: Suffrage"/&gt; Of these, only 10 countries (additionally one Swiss canton and one Indian state) enforce it. Of the 30 member states of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]], 10 had forms of compulsory voting.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Tim.

=== Enforced ===
These are the countries and sub-national entities that enforce compulsory voting:
*[[Elections in Argentina|Argentina]] – Introduced in 1912 with the [[Sáenz Peña Law]].&lt;ref name="idea"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm | title=Compulsory Voting | publisher=[[International Institute for Democracy and Electoral Assistance|IDEA]] | date=21 August 2014 | accessdate=19 September 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612191446/http://www.idea.int/vt/compulsory_voting.cfm | archivedate=12 June 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compulsory for citizens between 18 and 70 years old, non-compulsory for those older than 70 and between 16 and 18. (However, in a primary election, citizens under 70 may refuse to vote if they formally express their decision to the electoral authorities at least 48 hours before the election. This must be repeated for each election in which the voter refuses to vote.)
*[[Electoral system of Australia|Australia]] – Introduced for state elections in Queensland in 1915, excluding Aboriginal (indigenous) Australians.  Victoria introduced compulsory voting in 1926, New South Wales and Tasmania in 1928, Western Australia in 1936 (excluding indigenous Australians) and South Australia in 1942. Introduced for national elections in 1924 for citizens aged 18 and over, but not compulsory for indigenous Australians until 1984.&lt;ref name="idea" /&gt; The requirement is for the person to enrol, attend a polling station and have their name marked off the electoral roll as attending, receive a ballot paper and take it to an individual voting booth, mark it, fold the ballot paper and place it in the ballot box. The act does not explicitly state that a choice must be made, it only states that the ballot paper be 'marked'. According to the act, how a person marks the paper is completely up to the individual. Despite the risk of sanctions, voter turnout at national elections is dropping, with 1.4 million eligible voters, or nearly 10% of total, failing to vote at the 2016 national elections, the lowest turnout since compulsory voting began.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.smh.com.au/politics/federal/election-2016-voter-turnout-lowest-since-compulsory-voting-began-in-1925-20160808-gqnij2.html Election 2016: Voter turnout lowest since compulsory voting began in 1925]&lt;/ref&gt;   In some states, local council elections are also compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Electoral Commission Site On Rules Governing Compulsory Voting In Federal and State Elections http://www.aec.gov.au/Voting/Compulsory_Voting.htm&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Tasmanian state election, 2010|2010 Tasmanian state election]], with a turnout of 335,353 voters, about 6,000 people were fined $26 for not voting, and about 2,000 paid the fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2014-02-27/tasmanian-political-leaders-face-off-in-televised-debate/5288722|title=Tasmanian political leaders face off in televised debate|date=27 February 2014|publisher=|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A postal vote is available for those for whom it is difficult to attend a polling station.

==Measures to encourage voting==
Although voting in a country may be compulsory, penalties for failing to vote are not always strictly enforced. In [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Publications/backgrounders/files/2014-eb-compulsory-voting.pdf | title=Electoral Backgrounder: Compulsory Voting | date=September 2014 | accessdate=23 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Brazil]],{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} providing a legitimate reason for not voting (such as illness) is accepted. In Argentina, those who were ill on voting day are excused by requesting a doctor to prove their condition; those over {{convert|500|km|abbr=on}} away from their voting place are also excused by asking for a certificate at a police station near where they are.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.telam.com.ar/notas/201503/97676-elecciones-2015-toda-la-informacion.html | title=Elecciones 2015: toda la información | publisher=[[Télam]] | date=11 March 2015 | accessdate=23 May 2015 | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Belgium|Belgian]] voters can vote in an embassy if they are abroad or can empower another voter to cast the vote in their name; the voter must give a "permission to vote" and carry a copy of the eID card and their own on the actual elections.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

States that sanction nonvoters with fines generally impose small or nominal penalties. However, penalties for failing to vote are not limited to fines and legal sanctions. Belgian voters who repeatedly fail to vote in elections may be subject to [[disenfranchisement]]. [[Singapore]]an voters who fail to vote in a general election or presidential election will be subjected to disenfranchisement until a valid reason is given or a fine is paid. Goods and services provided by public offices may be denied to those failing to vote in [[Peru]] and [[Greece]]. In Brazil, people who fail to vote in an election are barred from obtaining a passport and subject to other restrictions until settling their situation before an electoral court or after they have voted in the two most recent elections. If a [[Bolivia]]n voter fails to participate in an election, the person may be denied withdrawal of the salary from the bank for three months.&lt;ref name="thenews.com.pk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-13-20732-Of-31-countries-with-compulsory-voting-a-dozen-actually-enforce-it|title=Of 31 countries with compulsory voting, a dozen actually enforce it|website=www.thenews.com.pk|accessdate=28 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://politics.guardian.co.uk/apathy/story/0,,1521096,00.html "Compulsory voting around the world"], ''The Guardian'', 4 July 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Critical medical anthropology''' ('''CMA''') is a branch of [[medical anthropology]] that blends [[critical theory]] and ground-level ethnographic approaches in the consideration of the [[political economy]] of health, and the effect of social inequality on people's health. It puts emphasis on the structure of social relationships, rather than purely [[biomedical]] factors in analyzing health and accounting for its determinants.

CMA starts with the idea that human health is a biosocial and political ecological product. Consequently, CMA is critical of the tendency to naturalize the process of health and illness in the health and social sciences. CMA dates to the 1980s, but has deeper roots in critical theory concerning the social determinants of health. CMA adds an anthropological dimension to traditional critical approaches, thereby avoiding a top-down perspective. In other words, CMA recognizes that there is interaction between the macro-level of social structure, the meso-level of social organization and agentive action, and the micro-level of individual experience and health.

During the early years of medical anthropology’s formation, explanations within the discipline tended to be narrowly focused on explaining health-related beliefs and behaviors at the local level in terms of specific ecological conditions, cultural configurations, or psychological factors. While providing needed insight about the nature and function of traditional and folk medical models, the initial perspectives in medical anthropology tended to ignore the wider causes and determinants of human decision making and behavior. Explanations that are limited to accounting for health-related issues in terms of the influence of human personalities, culturally constituted motivations and understandings, or even local ecological relationships, emergent critical medical anthropologists began to argue, are inadequate because they tend not to include examination of the structures of social relationship that unite (commonly in an unequal fashion) and influence far-flung individuals, communities, and even whole nations. A critical understanding, by contrast, involves paying close attention to what has been called the “vertical links” that connect the social group of interest to the larger regional, national, and global human society and to the configuration of social relationships that contribute to the patterning of human behavior, belief, attitude, and emotion.

Consequently, what came to be called critical medical anthropology focused attention on understanding the origins of dominant cultural constructions in health, including which social class, gender, or ethnic group’s interests particular health concepts express and under what set of historic conditions they arise. Further, CMA emphasizes structures of power and inequality in health care systems and the contributions of health ideas and practices in reinforcing inequalities in the wider society. Moreover, CMA addresses the social origins of illness, such as the way in which poverty, discrimination, industrial pollution of the environment, social violence, and fear of violence contribute to poor health. Critical medical anthropologists argue that experience and “agency,” that is, individual and group decision making and action, are constructed and reconstructed in the action arena between socially constituted categories of meaning and the political-economic forces that shape the context [and texture] of daily life. In other words, people develop their own individual and collective understandings and responses to illness and to other threats to their well-being, but they do so in a world that is not of their own making, a world in which inequality of access to health care, the media, productive resources (e.g., land, potable water, clean air), and valued social statuses play a significant role in their daily options. 

Additionally, while recognizing the fundamental importance of physical (including biological) reality in health, such as the nature of particular pathogens or the release of toxins into the environment, CMA emphasizes the fact that it is not merely the idea of “nature”—the way external reality is conceived and related to by humans—but also the very physical shape of nature, including human biology, that has been deeply influenced by an evolutionary history of social inequality, overt and covert social conflict, and the operation of both physical power and the power to shape dominant ideas and conceptions in society and internationally through processes of globalization, control of production and reproduction, and control of labor.

&lt;!--as Derek Thomson redirects here--&gt;
'''Derick Smith Thomson''' (5 August 1921 – 21 March 2012), known as ''Ruaraidh MacThòmais'' in his native [[Scottish Gaelic|Gaelic]], was a Scottish poet, publisher, [[lexicographer]], academic and writer. He was originally from [[Isle of Lewis|Lewis]], but spent much of his life in [[Glasgow]], where he was [[Chair of Celtic, Glasgow|Professor of Celtic]] at the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1963 to 1991. He is best known for setting up the publishing house [[Gairm]], along with its magazine, which was the longest-running periodical ever to be written entirely in Gaelic, running for over fifty years under his editorship. Gairm has since ceased, and was replaced by ''[[Gath (magazine)|Gath]]'' and then STEALL. He was an Honorary President of the Scottish Poetry Library, and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh and the British Academy.  In June 2007, he received an honorary degree from Glasgow University.

==Life==
Thomson is originally from [[Upper Bayble]] (''Pabail Uarach'') on Lewis, the same village that produced two other Gaelic writers of note, [[Iain Crichton Smith]] and [[Anne Frater]]. His parents, James Thomson and Christina Smith, were both primary school teachers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.gaelport.com/nuacht/Poet-and-scholar-steeped-in-Gaelic-culture/|publisher=Gaelport|title=0 Poet and scholar steeped in Gaelic culture|date=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Educated at the [[Nicolson Institute]] in [[Stornoway]], he went on to the Universities of [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]]; [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and [[Bangor University]]. He would later teach at [[University of Edinburgh|Edinburgh]], [[University of Glasgow|Glasgow]] and [[University of Aberdeen|Aberdeen]]. He became [[Chair of Celtic, Glasgow|Professor of Celtic]] at Glasgow in 1963, and retired in 1991. He was Chairman of the [[Gaelic Books Council]] 1968–91; President Scottish Gaelic Texts Society; former member of [[Scottish Arts Council]] and was the first recipient of the Ossian Prize in 1974. Professor Thomson was Chairman of the [[Scottish National Party|SNP]]'s Gaelic Committee in the Seventies.

He is the author of numerous books including ''An Introduction to Gaelic Poetry'', ''The Companion to Gaelic Poetry'', ''European Poetry in Gaelic'', and collections of Gaelic poetry, including his collected poems ''Creachadh na Clàrsaich'' (Plundering of the [[Harp]]/[[clarsach]]) which shared the [[Saltire Society Literary Awards|Scottish Book of the Year Award]] in 1983. He also edited ''[[The Companion to Gaelic Scotland]]''. His English-Gaelic dictionary came out in 1981, and was for many years the most practical reference of its kind. He has published seven collections of Gaelic poetry, with many English translations, including ''Meall Garbh/The Rugged Mountain'' (1995), ''Smeur an Dochais'', etc.

His publications are many and varied, and include such seminal works as the ''Gaelic Sources of Macpherson's Ossian'', ''An Introduction to Gaelic Poetry'', ''The Companion to Gaelic Scotland'' (edited by him) and ''Gaelic Poetry in the Eighteenth Century''; his contributions to Welsh studies are also noteworthy. No less important has been Professor Thomson's work for the promotion of Scottish Gaelic literature, not only, to take one example, as founder, editor and publisher of the quarterly Gairm since 1953. He was elected Fellow of the Academy in 1992 and gave last year's Rhys Lecture on Scottish Gaelic Traditional Songs from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century. Thomson was also tireless in his support of other writers in Gaelic and helped bring to publications works such as 'Gaelic Verbs' by [[Colin B.D. Mark]],.

Derick Thomson died in 2012, at the age of 90.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/obituary-professor-derick-thomson-writer-and-scholar-who-was-the-most-important-voice-in-gaelic-poetry-in-the-20th-century-1-2211560 |title=Obituary: Professor Derick Thomson; writer and scholar who was the most important voice in Gaelic poetry in the 20th century – News |publisher=Scotsman.com |date= |accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''DigVentures''' is a social enterprise organising crowdfunded archaeological excavation experiences. It is registered with the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists (CIfA), and is a CIfA Accredited Field School.&lt;ref&gt;Chartered Institute for Archaeologists website entry, [http://www.archaeologists.net/ro/102-digventures-ltd "DigVentures Ltd"] Retrieved on 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Headquartered in London, DigVentures works globally with a network of regional partners to raise seed capital for, and increasing participation in, sustainable 
archaeology and heritage projects worldwide. The organisation was formed in 2011, responding to the challenge of austerity and lack of opportunity in the heritage sector.&lt;ref&gt;Knowles, Kitty. [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/science/archaeology/news/britain-must-dig-deeper-to-save-its-archaeology-9602435.html "Britain must dig deeper to save its archaeology"], The Independent, 13 July 2014. Retrieved on 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt; By adopting a [[crowdfunding]] and [[crowdsourcing]] approach,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Jason. [https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-17211285 "Flag Fen archaeology idea brings in public to dig deep"], BBC News website, 1 March 2012. Retrieved on March 19, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; DigVentures have sought to address this by using digital and social media to build audiences, increase revenue and find new ways for the public to participate in archaeological fieldwork.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Brendon &amp; Westcott Wilkins, Lisa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zZg0XZYXKZo&amp;feature=youtu.be "The things we think and do not say: the future of our business"], Presentation given at Institute for Archaeologists conference, Glasgow, April 2014. Retrieved on 19 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crowdfunding model ==
DigVentures projects are coordinated through an online multicurrency crowdfunding platform (DigStarter) designed to connect heritage sector managers and archaeologists (project owners) with a worldwide crowd of interested and actively engaged participants.&lt;ref&gt;Heritage Alliance website entry, [http://www.theheritagealliance.org.uk/fundingdirectory/main/detail.php?FundCode=DIGV "DigStarter"] Retrieved on 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Project owners choose a timeframe and target-funding goal, selling non-monetary rewards and experiences linked to their projects through their social networks. This has enabled the public to financially support interesting archaeology projects as well as to join in, learn new skills and contribute to internationally important research. Heritage projects using this model on the DigStarter platform include [[Flag Fen]] Lives, [[Leiston Abbey]], Save the Welsh Streets, [[Southwell, Nottinghamshire|Researching Roman Southwell]] and [[Chiltern Open Air Museum]].

== Digital Dig Team ==
In 2014 DigVentures received a grant from the Heritage Lottery Fund to develop its Digital Dig Team.&lt;ref&gt;Westcott Wilkins, Lisa. [http://digventures.com/2014/04/01/digventures-hlf-and-the-digital-dig-team-at-leiston-abbey/ "DigVentures, HLF and the ‘Digital Dig Team’ at Leiston Abbey"], DigVentures website, 1 April 2014. Retrieved on 19 March, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; This has been described as a ‘Community Management System’ for archaeology projects.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Brendon. [http://digventures.com/2015/02/17/digging-the-crowd-the-future-of-archaeological-research-in-the-collaborative-economy/ "Digging the Crowd – The Future of Archaeological Research in the Collaborative Economy"], Transcript of keynote speech given at the Digital Pasts conference, Swansea February 2015. Retrieved on 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; It is built onto a cloud-based, open-source software platform enabling researchers to publish data directly from the field using any web-enabled device (such as a smartphone or tablet) into a live relational database. Once recorded the born-digital archive is accessible via open-access on a dedicated website, and published to social profiles of all project participants.&lt;ref&gt;Wilkins, Brendon &amp; Westcott-Wilkins, Lisa. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kKrYSmAwnS8&amp;feature=youtu.be "Paranoid Android? The future of archaeological research in the collaborative and digital economy"], Presentation given at the Theoretical Archaeology Group conference, Manchester December 2014. Retrieved on 19 March 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Beta tested in the field at Leiston Abbey in 2014, early results have shown that the Digital Dig Team system can enable archaeologists to build audiences (through immersive storytelling), generate revenue (through crowdfunding), enable public participation (through crowdsourcing) and improve research by making results available to a networked specialist team in 'real time'.  A children's version of this system has also been developed, based on a ‘Cyber Dig’ simulated excavation for use in schools or family events.

=== Leiston Abbey ===
[[Leiston Abbey]] was the first crowdfunding campaign to run on the DigStarter platform in 2013, and has since raised more than £36,000 over two seasons. The project is ongoing and is currently entering the third year of five proposed digging seasons.&lt;ref&gt;DigVentures website.

'''Epistemic Advantage''' is a [[technical term|term]] used within [[feminist theory]] when attempting to acquire [[knowledge]] from the individual lives and experiences of different [[women]]. The term is used to describe the ways in which women, and other [[minority groups]], are able to have a much clearer understanding of how the power structure works within a given [[society]] because they are not members of the dominant group. [[Uma Narayan]], a leading feminist theorist writes about epistemic advantage in her essay entitled, "The Project of Feminist Epistemology: Perspectives From A Nonwestern Feminist". Narayan defines epistemic advantage as "(the oppressed) having knowledge of the practices of both their own contexts and those of their oppressors," (''Feminist Theory Reader'', p.&amp;nbsp;315).  As the [[feminist movement]] has moved into the 3rd wave, women’s ‘intersecting identities’ have become increasingly important. There has been an acknowledgement that women of different social locations (with respect to [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[social class|class]], [[nationality]], [[Sexual orientation|sexuality]], etc.) will have different experiences.  Thus these varying perspectives provide different women with ‘advantages’ in understanding their own specific social locations within a given society’s hierarchal power structure. Uma Narayan points out that while it is in the interest of various subordinate groups to have knowledge of the dominant group, the dominant group does not have the same need.
 
Women of color often have a clearer understanding of how not only the gender hierarchy plays out in their daily lives, but the racial and class hierarchies as well. [[African-American]] feminist movements and [[Mexican-American]] feminist movements are only a few of the many [[marginalized]] groups that have made efforts in discussing their own ‘epistemic advantage’ within American society. The Combahee River Collective wrote in "A Black Feminist Statement" about the particular struggles of African-American women. They write: "We have spent a great deal of energy delving into the cultural and experiential nature of our oppression out of necessity because none of these matters have ever been looked at before. No one has ever mentioned the multilayered text of black women’s lives," (''Feminist Theory Reader'',p.&amp;nbsp;167). Thus, it is African-American women’s experiences from their specific social location that allows them their own epistemic advantage.

Although oppressed groups are able to have advantage with respect to knowledge of the power hierarchy it is important that we remain sensitive to, and aware of, the effects of oppression among various groups and/or individuals. [[Karen J. Warren]] points this out in her book ''Ecological Feminism'' in which she explains that we "must avoid the potential glorification of oppression that may accompany the positing of ‘epistemic advantage’ to marginalized groups," (p.&amp;nbsp;131). One of the primary tenets of feminist thought is to focus on the lived experience of women without creating or maintaining any form of hierarchy within various epistemologies and that all women’s experience is of value and importance.

[[File:Marco Aurelio bronzo.JPG|thumb|260px|The Statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]] (detail) in the [[Capitoline Museums]] in Rome.]]

The '''Equestrian Statue of [[Marcus Aurelius]]''' is an [[ancient Rome|ancient Roman]] statue in the [[Capitoline Hill]], [[Rome]], [[Italy]]. It is made of [[bronze]] and stands 4.24&amp;nbsp;m (13.9 ft) tall. Although the emperor is mounted, it exhibits many similarities to standing statues of [[Augustus]]. The original is on display in the [[Capitoline Museums]], with the one now standing in the open air of the [[Piazza del Campidoglio]] being a replica made in 1981 when the original was taken down for restoration.

==Description==
[[Image:0 Marcus Aurelius - Piazza del Campidoglio (2).JPG|thumb|right|The replica of the statue in the [[Campidoglio]]]]
The overall theme is one of power and divine grandeur—the emperor is over life-size and extends his hand in a gesture of [[Adlocutio|adlocutio]] used by emperors when addressing their troops. Some historians assert that a conquered enemy was originally part of the sculpture (based on accounts from [[mediaeval]] times, including the ''[[Mirabilia Urbis Romae]]'', that suggest a small figure of a bound [[barbarian]] chieftain once cowered underneath the horse's front right leg).&lt;ref name="Stewart 2012"/&gt; Such an image was meant to portray the Emperor as victorious and all-conquering. However, shown without weapons or armour, [[Marcus Aurelius]] seems to be a bringer of peace rather than a military hero, for this is how he saw himself and his reign.
 
He is riding without the use of [[stirrups]], which had not yet been introduced to the West. While the horse has been meticulously studied in order to be recreated for other artists' works, the saddle cloth was copied with the thought that it was part of the standard Roman uniform. The saddle cloth is actually [[Sarmatian]] in origin, suggesting that the horse is a Sarmatian horse and that the statue was created to honour the victory over the Sarmatians by Marcus Aurelius, after which he adopted "Sarmaticus" to his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Emperor's New Saddle Cloth: The Ephippium of the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius|jstor = 1512863|journal = Metropolitan Museum Journal|date = 1989-01-01|pages = 17–24|volume = 24|doi = 10.2307/1512863|first = Helmut|last = Nickel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:marcus.aurelius.inscription.rome.arp.jpg|thumb|left|The inscription on the plinth of the statue, commissioned by [[Pope Paul III]].]]
The statue was erected ca. 175 AD. Its original location is debated: the [[Roman Forum]] and  [[Piazza Colonna]] (where the [[Column of Marcus Aurelius]] stands) have been proposed.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2012"&gt;Stewart, Peter, "The Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius" in ''A Companion to Marcus Aurelius'', edited by Martin van Ackeren, Wiley-Blackwell, 2012, pp. 264-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were many [[equestrian statue|equestrian imperial statues]], they rarely survived because it was the common practice to melt down bronze statues for reuse as material for coins or new sculptures in the late empire. Indeed, it is the only fully surviving bronze statue of a pre-Christian Roman emperor; the [[Regisole]], destroyed after the [[French Revolution]], may have been another. The equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in Rome, owes its preservation on the [[Campidoglio]], to the popular mis-identification of [[Marcus Aurelius]], the philosopher-emperor, with [[Constantine the Great]], the Christian emperor; indeed, more than 20 other bronze equestrian statues of various emperors and generals had been melted down since the end of the Imperial Roman era.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bluffton.edu/homepages/facstaff/sullivanm/italy/rome/marcusaurelius/marcusaurelius.html Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in the Capitoline Museum, Rome]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://capitolini.info/scu03247/?lang=en Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius] Capitoline Museum&lt;/ref&gt;

In the medieval era it was one of the few Roman statues to remain on public view.  In the 8th century it stood in the [[Lateran Palace]] in Rome on a pedestal provided by Sixtus IV,&lt;ref name="Fehl 362–367"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Placement of the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius in the Middle Ages|jstor = 750854|journal = Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes|date = 1974-01-01|pages = 362–367|volume = 37|doi = 10.2307/750854|first = Philipp|last = Fehl}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where it was relocated in 1538, by order of Pope Paul III to remove it from the main traffic of the square.&lt;ref name="Fehl 362–367"/&gt; It was moved to the [[Piazza del Campidoglio]] ([[Capitoline Hill]]) during [[Michelangelo]]'s redesign of the Hill. Though he disagreed with its central positioning, he designed a special pedestal for it.&lt;ref name="Stewart 2012"/&gt; The original is on display in the [[Palazzo dei Conservatori]] of the [[Musei Capitolini]], while a replica has replaced it in the square.

On the night of November 29, 1849, at the inception of the  revolutionary [[Roman Republic (19th century)|Roman Republic]], a mass procession set up the Red-White-Green tricolore (now 
[[Flag of Italy]], then a new and highly "subversive" flag) in the hands of the mounted Marcus Aurelius.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leona Rostenberg]], "Margaret Fuller's Roman Diary" ''The Journal of Modern History'' '''12'''.2 (June 1940:209-220) p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue is depicted on the reverse of the [[Italian euro coins|Italian €0.50 euro coin]], designed by [[Roberto Mauri]].

A [[List of Brown University statues|replica of the statue]] has been located on the campus of [[Brown University]] in the [[United States]] since 1908.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Brown Alumni Monthly|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EqFIAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA26|year=1909|publisher=Brown University|pages=26–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The statue was formerly clad in gold. An old local myth says that the statue will turn gold again on the [[Last Judgment|Judgement Day]].&lt;ref&gt;This folk legend is recorded in p. 40 of the National Geographic ''Traveler's Rome'' (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Braschi1963"&gt;{{cite book|author=Palazzo Braschi|title=Giuseppe Gioachino Belli e la Roma del suo tempo: mostra del centenario della morte del poeta (1863-1963) : Palazzo Braschi, dicembre 1963-febbraio 1964|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ePwIAQAAMAAJ|date=1963*|publisher=De Luca}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allegedly{{according to whom|date=September 2018}} the Equestrian Statue of [[King George III]] of England which stood in [[New York City]]'s [[Bowling Green (New York City)|Bowling Green]] until 1776 when it was thrown down and the lead turned into musket balls for [[George Washington]]'s army was based upon the Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius.

[[File:Logo of the Europae Archaeologiae Consilium.jpg|thumb|right|Logo]]
The '''Europae Archaeologiae Consilium''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for ''European Archaeological Council''), or EAC, is an international non-profit organisation established under Belgian law (Organisation number: 189062000 / TVA-number: 472502440), which brings together the heads of the national services with responsibility for the [[cultural heritage|archaeological heritage]].

The primary aims of the Europae Archaeologiae Consilium are to
# support the management of the archaeological heritage throughout Europe;
# monitor the implementation of the [[Valletta Treaty]] in Europe;
# serve the needs of national archaeological heritage management agencies by providing a forum for organisations to establish closer and more structured co-operation and exchange of information, including developing common standards and strategies.

== History ==
[[File:Burtint (Albania) General Assembly 2013.jpg|thumb|right|Theatre in Butrint (Albania), Setting for the 2013 General Assembly]]
The forerunner of the EAC was an expert committee charged by the [[Council of Europe]] with developing the [[Valletta Treaty|European Convention on the Protection of the Archaeological Heritage]] (1992). After the convention was ratified, the committee continued its work, e. g. in the Council of Europe's ''Bronze Age Campaign'' and in regular meetings at the annual conference of the [[European Association of Archaeologists]]. The personal network resulting from these years of international cooperation led to the foundation of an association to support further projects such as the [[European Landscape Convention]] (or Florence Convention). The inaugural meeting of the EAC took place at the Council of Europe in [[Strasbourg]] on 25 November 1999. The first statutes were published on 24 August 2000 as an annex to the Belgian Official Journal. Since then the statutes have changed several times. The latest changes were adopted at the General Assembly in Paris in 2012 and were published as an annex to the Belgian Official Journal on 13 March 2013. The organization was based first in [[Brussels]] but moved to [http://Namur,_Belgium Namur] in 2011.

In contrast to other archaeological associations such as the [[European Association of Archaeologists]] (EAA), the EAC does not represent a community of individual archaeologists but rather the national statutory authorities with responsibility for the management of archaeological heritage. Moreover, the EAC focuses primarily on issues of heritage management.&lt;ref&gt;W.J.H. Willems, The work of making Malta p. 66 f.&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Council of Europe]], the EAC has held the status of an [[non-governmental organisation|NGO]] observer member in the [http://www.coe.int/t/dg4/cultureheritage/cdcpp/default_EN.asp Steering Committee on Culture, Heritage and Landscape (CDCPP)] since its establishment in 2012 and held the equivalent status with that committee's predecessors, first with the Steering Committee for Cultural Heritage (CDPAT) &lt;ref&gt;Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe, [https://wcd.coe.int/ViewDoc.jsp?id=8855 protocol of the meeting on 15 January 2003]; cf. Willems, The work of making Malta p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; and then (from 2007) with the Steering Committee for Cultural Heritage and Landscape (CDPATEP).

== Objectives ==
The objectives of the EAC as expressed at its foundation are:
* to promote collaboration between the statutory bodies in Europe with responsibility for the management of the archaeological heritage
* to provide a platform for discussions and information exchange  for all the institutions active in the field of archaeological heritage
* to observe and monitor the political developments in Europe concerning the archaeological heritage, and to give advice on these issues, especially to the [[European Union]] and the Council of Europe.
* to promote the protection, management, scientific interpretation, publication, presentation and understanding of archaeological remains.
* to collaborate with other institutions sharing equivalent aims

In order to achieve these aims the EAC seeks to exert influence on different domains of society. It strives to raise the awareness of the value of the archaeological heritage in politics as well as to the broader public, so that political decisions can take better account of archaeology. A key objective of the EAC is to ensure that the professional quality of archaeological work is carried out through the adoption of high pan-European quality standards. As part of this process, the development of common guidelines for the gathering and archival storage of archaeological data is currently in progress. Finally, the EAC considers that European collaboration in scientific research will make it possible to explore subjects of particular concern and enable the development of pan-European research programmes.&lt;ref&gt;Olivier, The Europae Archaeologiae Consilium, p. VI&lt;/ref&gt;

Special working groups of the EAC are concerned with topics of particular importance such as [[Underwater archaeology]], rural land use (which deals with the impact of farming and modern land management on the archaeological resource), large-scale [[excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], remote sensing and prospection (which includes [[aerial archaeology]]) and archaeological archives.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2833">{{short description|portrait by Japanese artist Hokusai}}{{italic title}}

The '''''Great Daruma''''' was a monumental portrait created by Japanese artist [[Hokusai]] on 5 October 1817. Also known as the '''''Great Bodhidarma''''', the work is a depiction of [[Bodhidharma]], known in Japan as [[Bodhidharma|Daruma]], a revered [[Buddhist monk]] of the 5th or 6th century. The original artwork was destroyed in May 1945.

== Background ==
The ''Great Daruma'' was not Hokusai's first monumental portrait. In 1804, during a festival at the [[Gokoku-ji]] temple in Edo (modern [[Tokyo]]), he created a portrait of Daruma said to be {{convert|600|ft}} long, using a broom and buckets full of ink.

== Conception ==
[[File:Hokusai Daruma 1817.png|thumb|Contemporary print of [[Hokusai]] painting the ''Great Daruma'' in 1817]]
Hokusai made the ''Great Daruma'' in a courtyard beside the [[Hongan-ji Nagoya Betsuin]] Buddhist temple in [[Nagoya]], Japan. The portrait depicted the head of the monk and his upper body swathed in flowing robes. It was drawn on a large expanse of paper, measuring {{convert|59|x|35|ft|m}}, equivalent to approximately 120 standard [[tatami]] mats of {{convert|70|x|35|in|cm}} each. The eyes were {{convert|70|in|cm}} wide, the nose {{convert|105|in|cm}} long, and the mouth {{convert|82|in|cm}} across. 

The event was advertised in advance to draw a large crowd. Hokusai worked for hours adding bold lines of ink until the image was finally revealed when the paper was hoisted into the air using a large wooden beam attached to one end, like a gigantic [[hanging scroll]], or the huge [[thongdrel]] [[thanka]]s of [[Tibetan Buddhism]] (usually in silk appliqué).

== Reception ==
As a result of this dramatic feat, Hokusai became known in Nagoya as "Daruma-sen", the Daruma master. The triumph brought greater attention to Hokusai, enabling him to sell more prints to the public, including prints of the ''Great Daruma''. He published a new volume of his [[Manga]] sketches in 1817.

== Destruction ==
The original artwork survived in Nagoya until May 1945, when it was destroyed along with the wooden temple building in the [[bombing of Nagoya in World War II]]. Contemporaneous promotional handbills survive, with some held at the [[Nagoya City Museum]].

{{Palestinians}}

'''Hebron Glass''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;زجاج الخليل&lt;/big&gt;}}, ''zajaj al-Khalili'' ) refers to [[glass]] produced in [[Hebron]] as part of a flourishing [[Palestinian art|art]] industry established in the city during [[History of Palestine#Roman Period 63 BCE–330 CE|Roman rule]] in [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]].&lt;ref name=Spaulding&gt;Spaulding and Welch, 1994, pp. 200-201.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; Hebron's Old City still contains a quarter named the "Glass-Blower Quarter" and Hebron glass continues to serve as a tourist attraction for the city.

Traditionally, the glass was melted using local raw materials, including [[sand]] from neighbouring villages, [[sodium carbonate]] (from the [[Dead Sea]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dphjewelry.com/art-n0809-131.html |title=Hebron Beads |publisher=Dphjewelry.com |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and coloring additives such as [[iron oxide]] and [[Copper(II) oxide|copper oxide]]. Nowadays, [[Glass recycling|recycled glass]] is often used instead. Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets of which have been preserved and passed down by a few [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city.&lt;ref name=HolyLand&gt;{{cite web|title=Vases|publisher=Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society|url=http://www.holyland-handicraft.org/index.php?option=com_virtuemart&amp;page=shop.browse&amp;category_id=53&amp;Itemid=1&amp;TreeId=48&amp;vmcchk=1&amp;Itemid=1|accessdate=2008-04-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; The products made include glass [[jewellery]], such as [[Glass beadmaking|beads]], bracelets, and rings,&lt;ref name=Beard&gt;Beard, 1862, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[stained glass]] windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the [[Middle East conflict#Arab-Israeli conflict|Palestinian-Israeli conflict]], glass production has suffered a decline.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

==History==
The glass industry in Hebron was established during [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule in Palestine (63 BCE-330 CE).&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt; As the ancient [[Phoenicia]]n glass industry shrank from the exposed cities along the eastern [[Mediterranean]] coastline, the industry migrated inland, to Hebron in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Perrot, Chipiez and Armstrong, 1885, p.328.&lt;/ref&gt; Glass artifacts from Hebron dating to the 1st and 2nd centuries have been found, and are on exhibit as part of the Drake Collection.&lt;ref name=Spaulding/&gt; Stained glass windows made of Hebron glass dating to the 12th century are found in the structure built over the [[Cave of Machpelah]], which served as a [[Church (building)|church]] during the [[Crusades|Crusader]] era in Palestine.&lt;ref name=Comay&gt;Comay, 2001, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of stained glass windows produced in Hebron are those adorning the [[Dome of the Rock]] in the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City of Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt;

"Hebron’s medieval reputation in glassmaking is corroborated by some of the many Christian pilgrims who visited the city over the centuries. Between 1345 and 1350, Franciscan monk [[Niccolò da Poggibonsi]] noted that “they make great works of art in glass.” In the late 15th century, the German friar [[Felix Faber]] and his companions also stopped in this “exceeding ancient city,” and he described how “we came forth from our inn, and passed through the long street of the city, in which work-people of divers crafts dwelt, but more particularly workers in glass; for at this place glass is made, not clear glass, but black, and of the colors between dark and light.”&lt;ref&gt;Simmons, Gail. 2013. [http://www.saudiaramcoworld.com/issue/201301/hebron.s.glass.history.htm "Hebron's Glass History."] Saudi Aramco World. January/February 2013. Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

While acknowledging that the production of glass in Palestine dates back to Roman period, Nazmi Ju'beh, director of ''RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation'', contends that the practices of today's glass industry in Hebron most likely emerged in the 13th century CE.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; This corresponds to what foreigners  observed, like [[Jacques de Vitry]] who around 1080 mentioned Acre and Tyre, (but not Hebron), as glass-producing cities,&lt;ref&gt;Vitry, 1896, p. [https://archive.org/stream/cu31924028534422#page/n105/mode/2up 92-93]&lt;/ref&gt; while by 1483, when [[Felix Fabri]] visited the city, he described passing "through the long street of the city, in which work-people of divers crafts dwelt, but particularely  workers in glass; for at this place glass is made, not clear glass, but black, and of the colours between dark and light."&lt;ref&gt;Fabri, 1893, p. [https://archive.org/stream/libraryofpalesti02paleuoft#page/411/mode/1up 411]&lt;/ref&gt;

Ju'beh notes that an alternate theory assigns today's techniques to the [[Venetian glass]] tradition and that still other researchers claim they were already extant at the time of the [[Crusades]] and were carried back to [[Europe]] from Hebron, possibly originating in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; 
[[File:Road to Hebron, Mar Saba, etc. Glass works.jpg|thumb|left|Glass Works, photo taken 1900-1920 by [[American Colony, Jerusalem]].]]
Glass produced by these factories were typically functional items including drinking and eating vessels, as well as olive oil and later [[petrol]]-based lamps, although the factories also produced jewellery and accessories.  [[Bedouins]] of the [[Negev]] (Naqab), the [[Arabian Desert]], and [[Sinai]] were the primary purchasers of jewellery, but large exports of expensive Hebron glass items were sent by guarded [[Camel train|camel caravans]] to [[Egypt]], Syria, and the [[Jordan|Transjordan]]. Marketing communities of Hebron glass were established in [[Al Karak|al-Karak]] (Crac) in southern [[Jordan]] and [[Cairo]] in Egypt by the 16th century.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

The glass industry was a principal employer and a generator of wealth for its owners.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt; Well known for glass production throughout the [[Arab world]], [[Western culture|Western]] travellers to Palestine in the 18th and 19th century provided descriptions of the Hebron glass industry as well. For example, [[Constantin François de Chassebœuf, comte de Volney|Volney]] in the 1780s, wrote that: "They make there great quantity of coloured rings, bracelets for the wrists and legs, and for the arm above the elbows, besides a variety of other trinkets, which are sent even to [[Constantinople]]."&lt;ref&gt;Volney, 1788, vol II, p. [https://archive.org/stream/travelsthroughs00volngoog#page/n343/mode/1up  325]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Jasper Seetzen]] noted during his travels in Palestine in 1807-09 that 150 persons were employed in the glass industry in Hebron,&lt;ref&gt;Seetzen, 1855, vol. 3, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/ulrichjaspersee02seetgoog#page/n14/mode/1up 5]-6. Schölch, 1993, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; while later, in ''A New and Complete History of the Holy Bible as Contained in the Old and New Testaments'' (1844), Robert Sears writes, "The population of Hebron is considerable: the inhabitants manufacture glass lamps, which are exported to Egypt. Provisions are abundant, and there is a considerable number of shops."&lt;ref name=Sears&gt;Sears, 1844, p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the century, the production declined due to competition from imported European glass-ware. However, the products of Hebron continued to be sold, particularly among the poorer populace, particularly by travelling [[Jew]]ish traders from the city.&lt;ref&gt;Delpuget, David: ''Les Juifs d´Alexandrie, de Jaffa et de Jérusalem en 1865'', Bordeaux, 1866, p. 26. Quoted in Schölch (1993); p.161, 162&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[Weltausstellung 1873 Wien|World Fair of 1873 in Vienna]], Hebron was represented with glass ornaments. A report from the French consul in 1886 suggests that glass-making remained an important source of income for Hebron with four factories making 60,000 [[franc]]s per annum.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Schölch (1993); p.161, 162&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition of glassblowing continues in the 21st century in three factories located outside of the traditional quarter of the Old City, north of Hebron and south of the neighboring town of [[Halhul]] which generally produce functional household souvenirs. Two of the factories are owned by the Natsheh family. These are displayed in large halls close to each of the factories.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

Hebron glass is an attraction for both domestic and foreign tourists. Today, however, due to ongoing export problems, the decline in tourism, and restrictions on [[Palestinian freedom of movement]] in the aftermath of the [[Second Intifada]], industry production has suffered. According to Nazmi al-Ju'bah, the director of ''RIWAQ: Centre for Architectural Conservation'', under these circumstances, the survival of the Hebron glass industry is in question.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Modern Hebron Glass Factory.jpg|thumb|left|Carefully moving molten glass as part of the modern production process]]

Hebron glass was traditionally produced using sand from the village of [[Bani Na'im]], east of Hebron, and [[sodium carbonate]] taken from the [[Dead Sea]]. Instead of sand, recycled glass is the primary raw material used to make Hebron glass today.&lt;ref name=IMEU&gt;{{cite web|title=Hebron glass: A centuries' old tradition|author=Nazmi al-Ju'bah|publisher=[[Institute for Middle East Understanding]] (Original in ''This Week in Palestine'')|date=January 25, 2008|url=http://imeu.net/news/article007701.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise production process is a trade secret maintained by the few Palestinian families who run the factories which continue to produce Hebron glass today,&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; passed through generations by [[apprenticeship|apprenticing]] children. As one master of the craft said, "You can learn to play the [['oud]] at any age, but unless you begin [glasswork] as a child, you will never become a master."&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;

According to the Holy Land Handicraft Cooperative Society, the [[Glassblowing|blowing]] technique employed is the same as was used by the ancient [[Phoenicians]],&lt;ref name=HolyLand/&gt; though archaeologists and historians of glass agree that glassblowing was not common until the last few centuries BCE. Molten glass is withdrawn from a furnace on the end of an iron pipe, which is blown into as a metal tool called a ''kammasha'' is used to shape the glass. It is returned to the furnace and reshaped by the same process before being detached from the pipe and placed into a cooling chamber.&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=2DUHAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=thompson++holy+land#PRA5-PA584,M1 Thompson], 1861, p.584.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jewellery==

Glass beads for jewellery have traditionally been made in Hebron. Blue beads and glass beads with 'eyes' (''owayneh'') were made for use as [[amulets]] since they were considered particularly effective against the [[evil eye|evil-eye]].&lt;ref name=IMEU/&gt;&lt;ref name=Weirp194&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 194. See also [http://www.palestine-family.net/index.php?nav=6-207&amp;cid=498&amp;did=959&amp;pageflip=2 Palestinian Jewellery]&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[British Museum|Museum of Mankind]] collections, there exist several glass necklaces that were made in Hebron during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate period]] or earlier. Besides necklaces made of blue and green beads, and 'eyes' beads, there are examples of beads of small hands, also called a [[Hamsa]], representing the hand of [[Fatimah]], the daughter of the prophet [[Muhammad]].&lt;ref name=Weirp201&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 201.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of a woman's jewellery was given to her at marriage; in the early 1920s, in [[Bayt Dajan]], a glass bracelet (''ghwayshat'') made in Hebron would be considered a necessary part of the jewellery of a bride's [[Dowry|trousseau]].&lt;ref name=Weirp230&gt;Weir, 1989, p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hebron trade beads===
In 1799, [[England|English]] traveller [[William George Browne]] mentioned the production of "Coarse glass beads...called Hersh and Munjir" in Palestine; The "Munjir" (''Mongur'') were large beads, while the Hersh (''Harish'') were smaller.&lt;ref&gt;Browne, William G. (1799): ''Travels in Africa, Egypt, and Syria from the Years 1792 to 1796''. Cadell, Davis, Longman, and Rees, London. Page 303. As cited on [http://www.thebeadsite.com/MG4-1.htm Hebron as Beadmaker]&lt;/ref&gt; These Hebron glass beads were used for [[trade beads|trade]], and export primarily to [[Africa]] from the early to mid-19th century. Spread throughout [[West Africa]], in [[Kano]], [[Nigeria]], they were grounded on the edges to make round beads fit together on a strand more suitably. There, they picked up the name "Kano Beads", although they were not originally produced in Kano. By the 1930s, their value had decreased; in 1937, [[A. J. Arkell]] recorded the beads being sold "for a song" by [[Sudan]]ese women to [[Hausa people|Hausa]] traders in [[Dafur]].&lt;ref&gt;Arkell, A. J. (1937) ''Hebron Beads in [[Darfur|Durfur]]'', Sudan Notes and Records 20(2):300-305, as cited on [http://www.thebeadsite.com/MG4-1.htm Hebron as Beadmaker]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="957">'''Home entertainment server''' systems differ from traditional [[Home theater PC|media center]] systems in that they designed from inception for storage, management and sharing of entertainment content, much as a [[file server]] is mission designed to share traditional computer files.  These systems are optimized for entertainment file sharing allowing libraries to be accessed across multiple servers from multiple rooms. They also integrate a range of content acquisition facilities including shared networking, built-in optical drives and tuners. These systems are operated from a simple TV-based menu. Individual servers feature secure volume managed expandable storage including internal, and external drives and arrays of drives into the multi-[[terabyte]] range.

The [[Telly (home entertainment server)]] is an example of such a device.

In [[mathematics]], '''ideal theory''' is the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]s in [[commutative ring]]s; and is the precursor name for the contemporary subject of [[commutative algebra]]. The name grew out of the central considerations, such as the [[Lasker–Noether theorem]] in [[algebraic geometry]], and the [[ideal class group]] in [[algebraic number theory]], of the commutative algebra of the first quarter of the twentieth century. It was used in the influential [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] text on [[abstract algebra]] from around 1930.

The ideal theory in question had been based on [[elimination theory]], but in line with [[David Hilbert]]'s taste moved away from [[algorithm]]ic methods. [[Gröbner basis]] theory has now reversed the trend, for [[computer algebra]].

The importance of the ideal in general of a [[module (mathematics)|module]], more general than an ''ideal'', probably led to the perception that ''ideal theory'' was too narrow a description. [[Valuation theory]], too, was an important technical extension, and was used by [[Helmut Hasse]] and [[Oscar Zariski]].  [[Nicolas Bourbaki|Bourbaki]] used ''commutative algebra''; sometimes ''local algebra'' is applied to the theory of [[local ring]]s. [[D. G. Northcott]]'s 1953 [[Cambridge Tract]] ''Ideal Theory'' (reissued 2004 under the same title) was one of the final appearances of the name.

In [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]], an '''intervocalic consonant''' is a [[consonant]] that occurs between two [[vowel]]s.  Intervocalic consonants are often associated with [[lenition]], a phonetic process that causes consonants to weaken and eventually disappear entirely.  An example of such a change in [[English language|English]] is ''[[intervocalic alveolar flapping]]'', a process (especially in [[North American English]] and [[Australian English]]) that, impressionistically speaking, turns ''t'' into ''d'', causing (e.g.) ''metal'' and ''batter'' to sound like ''medal'' and ''badder'', respectively. (More precisely, both /t/ and /d/ are pronounced with the [[alveolar tap]] {{IPA|[ɾ]}}.) In North American English the weakening is variable across word boundaries, so that the /t/ of "see you tomorrow" may be pronounced with either tap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} or {{IPA|[tʰ]}}. Some languages have intervocalic weakening processes fully active word-internally and in connected discourse: e.g. Spanish /d/ regularly pronounced {{IPA|[ð]}} in both {{IPA|[ˈtoðo]}} ''todo'' "all" and {{IPA|[laˈðuna]}} ''la duna'' "the dune" (but {{IPA|[ˈduna]}} if the word is pronounced alone).

In a research paper titled "The Talibanization of Gaza: A Liability for the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]", Schanzer wrote that while [[Ismael Haniyeh]] officially denied that [[Hamas]] intended to establish an Islamic emirate, since the 2007 coup, the Gaza Strip has exhibited the characteristics of [[Talibanization]], whereby the Islamist organization imposed strict rules on women, discouraged activities commonly associated with Western or Christian culture, oppressed non-Muslim minorities, imposed [[sharia]] law, and deployed religious police to enforce these laws.&lt;ref name="Schanzer"&gt;[http://www.currenttrends.org/research/detail/the-talibanization-of-gaza-a-liability-for-the-muslim-brotherhood The Talibanization of Gaza: A Liability for the Muslim Brotherhood] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100929201200/http://www.currenttrends.org/research/detail/the-talibanization-of-gaza-a-liability-for-the-muslim-brotherhood |date=2010-09-29 }}. by Jonathan Schanzer.

'''Kilise Tepe''' is a [[mound]] in [[Mersin Province]], [[Turkey]]. It was formerly known as Maltepe. The original name of the mound is not known and Kilise Tepe in Turkish means "church-hill" referring to a church ruin.

==Geography==
The mound is situated in the rural area of [[Mut, Mersin|Mut]] at {{coord|36|29|N|33|33|E}} close to road connecting  Turkish state way {{TUR-D|715}} to [[Gülnar]]. Its distance to Mut is {{convert|20|km}} and to [[Mersin]] is {{convert|145|km}}. It is just west of the [[Göksu River]] (Calycadnus of the antiquity).

==History==
The earliest settlement is dated to third Millennium BC. During the [[Hittite Empire]] era, it was used to control the road  between the Hittite lands in [[Central Anatolia]] and the [[Mediterranean Sea|Mediterranean]] ports. &lt;ref&gt;Mersin Ören Yerleri Kaleleri Müzeleri {{ISBN|978-605-4196-07-4}}, p 325 &lt;/ref&gt; There had been two great fires during that period. The settlement continued during the [[Hellenistic period]] . But there is no indication of a settlement during the [[Roman Empire]] era. The ruined church is an early (5th century) [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] church.

==Excavations==
The excavations began in 1994 as a joint effort between [[Cambridge University]] and [[Newcastle University]] and continued until 1997.&lt;ref&gt;H. D. Baker et al, Kilise Tepe 1994, Anatolian Studies, vol. 45, pp. 139-191, December 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postgate, J.N., Kilise Tepe 1994: A Summary of the Principal Results, Kazi Sonuçlari Toplantisi I, vol. 17, pp. 419-431, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postgate, J.N., Kilise Tepe 1995: A Summary of the Principal Results, Kazi Sonuçlari Toplantisi I, vol. 18, pp. 441-456, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Postgate, J.N., Kilise Tepe 1996: A Summary of the Principal Results,  I, vol. 19, pp. 209-226, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson, M.P.C. and J.N. Postgate, Kilise Tepe 1997: A Summary of the Principal Results, Kazi Sonuçlari Toplantisi I, vol 20, pp. 541-557, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;After a pause the excavations resumed in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Jackson M and Postgate N., Excavations at Kilise Tepe 2007, Kazi Sonuçlari Toplantisi, vol. 30, no. 3, pp. 207-232, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collon D, Jackson M, Postgate N., Excavations at Kilise Tepe 2008, Kazi Sonuçlari Toplantisi, vol. 31, no. 1, pp. 159-184, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Jackson M and Postgate N., Excavations at Kilise Tepe, Kazi Sonuçlari Toplantisi, vol. 32, no. 3, pp. 424-446, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The Cambridge team is headed by [[Nicholas Postgate (academic)|Nicholas Postgate]] and is responsible for the [[Iron Age]] excavations. The Newcastle team is headed by Mark Jackson and is responsible for the Byzantine excavations. This work continued until 2011.&lt;ref&gt;Christina Bouthillier et al, Further work at Kilise Tepe, 2007-2011: refining the Bronze to Iron Age transition, Anatolian Studies, vol. 64, pp. 95-161, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; The Turkish collaborators were [[Çanakkale Onsekiz Mart University]] in the 2010–2011 term and [[Bitlis Eren University]] in later terms. The findings are exhibited in [[Silifke Museum]].

{{Terrorism}}
'''Left-wing terrorism''' (sometimes called '''Marxist–Leninist terrorism''' or '''revolutionary/left-wing terrorism''') is [[terrorism]] meant to overthrow conservative or [[capitalism|capitalist systems]] and replace them with [[Marxism–Leninism|Marxist–Leninist]], [[socialist state|socialist]], or [[anarchist]] societies. Left-wing terrorism also occurs within already socialist states as activism against the current ruling government.&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"&gt;Aubrey, pp. 44–45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moghadam, p. 56"&gt;Moghadam, p.56&lt;/ref&gt; It has taken vivid manifestations across the world and presented diverging dynamics and relationships with national governments and political economies.

==Ideology==
Left-wing terrorists have been influenced by various communist and socialist currents, including Marxism.&lt;ref name="Moghadam, p. 56"/&gt; [[Narodnaya Volya]], a 19th-century terrorist group that killed tsar [[Alexander II of Russia]] in 1881&lt;ref name="Czar trial"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Trial of the Czar's Assassins |newspaper=Wanganui Herald |volume=XV |issue=4132|date=7 May 1881 |page=2 |agency=[[United Press Association]] |url=http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=WH18810507.2.14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and developed the concept of [[propaganda by the deed]], is a major influence.&lt;ref&gt;Moghadam, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Sarah Brockhoff]], [[Tim Krieger]] and [[Daniel Meierrieks]], while left-wing terrorism is ideologically motivated, nationalist-separatist terrorism is ethnically motivated.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that the revolutionary goal of left-wing terrorism is non-negotiable, whereas nationalist terrorists are willing to make concessions.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  They suggest that rigidity of the demands of left-wing terrorists may explain their lack of support relative to nationalist groups.&lt;ref name="Brockhoff p. 17"&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, many on the revolutionary left have showed solidarity for [[national liberation]] groups employing terrorism, such as [[Irish nationalism|Irish nationalists]], the [[Palestine Liberation Organization]] and the South American [[Tupamaros]], seeing them as engaged in a global struggle against capitalism.&lt;ref name="Brockhoff p. 17"/&gt; Since nationalist sentiment is fueled by socio-economic conditions, some separatist movements, including the Basque [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]], the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] and the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] incorporated communist and socialist ideology into their policies.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Left-wing terrorism has its roots in 19th and early 20th century [[anarchist terrorism]] and became pronounced during the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, pp. 2–3&lt;/ref&gt;  Modern left-wing terrorism developed in the context of the [[Protests of 1968|political unrest of 1968]].  In Western Europe, notable groups included the West German [[Red Army Faction]] (RAF), the Italian [[Red Brigades]], the French [[Action directe (armed group)|Action Directe]] (AD), and the Belgian [[Communist Combatant Cells]] (CCC). Asian groups have included the [[Japanese Red Army]] and the [[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]], although the latter organization later adopted [[nationalist terrorism]].  In Latin America, groups that became actively involved in terrorism in the 1970s and 1980s included the Nicaraguan [[Sandinistas]], the Peruvian [[Shining Path]], and the Colombian [[19th of April Movement]].&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/&gt;

===Canada===
The [[Front de libération du Québec]] was a Marxist-Leninist group active in Canada in the 1960s and '70s, promoting socialist insurrection and an independent Quebec. They are known for over 160 bombings and other violent incidents that killed eight, and for the kidnap-murder of Quebec politician [[Pierre Laporte]] in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Pelletier. The October crisis. McClelland and Stewart, 1971. Pp. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United States ===
{{Main|Terrorism in the United States}}
Modern left-wing terrorist groups in the United States developed from remnants of the [[Weather Underground]] and extremist elements of the [[Students for a Democratic Society]]. Between 1973 and 1975, the [[Symbionese Liberation Army]] was active, committing bank robberies, [[murder]]s, and other acts of violence. Most notably, the group kidnapped heiress [[Patty Hearst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/guerrilla/index.html|title=American Experience {{!}} Guerrilla: The Taking of Patty Hearst {{!}} PBS|website=www.pbs.org|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1980s, both the [[May 19th Communist Organization]] (M19CO) and the smaller [[United Freedom Front]] were active. A 1994 study found that in the 1980s "the actual number of acts of terrorism committed by left-wing groups accounted for about three-fourths of all officially designated acts of domestic terrorism in America. About half of these leftist acts were committed by Puerto Rican groups, while the rest were committed by traditional leftist terrorist groups like M19CO".&lt;ref&gt;Brent L. Smith (1994). "[https://archive.org/details/Terrorism_in_America_Brent_Smith Terrorism in America]", accessed 18 April 2018&lt;/REF&gt; After 1985, following the dismantling of both groups, one source reports there were no confirmed acts of left-wing terrorism by similar groups.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, pp. 24–25&lt;/ref&gt;

Incidents of left-wing terrorism dropped off at the end of the Cold War (circa 1989), partly due to the loss of support for communism.&lt;ref&gt;Brockhoff, Krieger and Meierrieks, pp. 13, 19&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Latin America===
Stefan M. Audrey describes the [[Sandinistas]], [[Shining Path]], [[19th of April Movement]], and [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) as the main organizations involved in left-wing terrorism in Latin America during the 1970s and 1980s. These organizations opposed the United States government and drew local support, as well as receiving support from the Soviet Union and Cuba.&lt;ref name="Aubrey, pp. 44-45"/&gt;

====FARC====
The [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia]] (FARC) is a Marxist–Leninist organization in Colombia which has engaged in vehicle bombings, gas cylinder bombs, killings, landmines, kidnapping, extortion, hijacking, as well as guerilla and conventional military. The United States Department of State includes the FARC-EP on its list of foreign terrorist organizations, as does the European Union. It funds itself primarily through extortion, kidnapping and their participation in the [[illegal drug trade]].&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC News]]. "Colombia's Most Powerful Rebels."  September 19, 2003.

Accessed September 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of their fronts enlist new and underage recruits by force, distribute propaganda and rob banks. Businesses operating in rural areas, including agricultural, oil, and mining interests, were required to pay "vaccines" (monthly payments) which "protected" them from subsequent attacks and kidnappings. An additional, albeit less lucrative, source of revenue was highway blockades in which guerrillas stopped motorists and buses in order to confiscate jewelry and money. An estimated 20 to 30 percent of FARC combatants are under 18 years old, with many as young as 12 years old, for a total of around 5000 children.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;[[Human Rights Watch]].

====May 19th Communist Organization====
The [[May 19th Communist Organization]], also referred to as the May 19 Communist Coalition, was a United States-based, self-described revolutionary organization formed by splintered-off members of the [[Weather Underground]] and the [[Black Liberation Army]].&lt;ref&gt;

====Shining Path====
The Communist Party of Peru, more commonly known as the [[Shining Path]] (Sendero Luminoso), is a Maoist guerrilla organization that launched the [[internal conflict in Peru]] in 1980.

==== Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist) ====
The [[Communist Party of Nepal (Maoist)]] has been responsible for hundreds of attacks on government and civilian targets.
After the [[United People's Front of Nepal]] (UPF)'s Maoist wing, CPN-M, performed poorly in elections and was excluded from the 194 election, the Maoists turned to [[insurgency]]. They aimed to overthrow Nepal's monarchy and parliamentary democracy, and to change Nepalese society, including a purge of the nation's elite class, a state takeover of private industry, and collectivization of agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tkb.org/Group.jsp?groupID=3531 MIPT Terrorism Knowledge Base&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.satp.org/satporgtp/countries/nepal/terroristoutfits/index.html Nepal Terrorist Groups - Maoist Insurgents&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Nepal]], attacks against civilian populations occurred as part of Maoist strategy, leading [[Amnesty International]] to state: &lt;blockquote&gt;The CPN (Maoist) has consistently targeted private schools, which it ideologically opposes. On the 14 April 2005 the CPN (Maoist) demanded that all private schools shut down, although this demand was withdrawn on 28 April. Following this demand, it bombed two schools in western Nepal on 15 April, a school in Nepalganj, Banke district on 17 April and a school in Kalyanpur, Chitwan on 21 April. CPN (Maoist) cadres also reportedly threw a bomb at students taking classes in a school in Khara, Rukum district.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20051107070737/http://web.amnesty.org/library/Index/ENGASA310542005?

==== Japanese Red Army ====
The [[Japanese Red Army]] (JRA) was founded in 1969 as the "Red Army Faction" by students impatient with the Communist Party.  In 1970, they hijacked a plane to North Korea, where nine of their members were interned. Fourteen members were killed during an internal purge. In 1971, the renamed JRA formed a connection with the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]] and established a base in Lebanon. Their major terrorist acts included an armed attack on the Tel Aviv airport, highjacking planes to Libya and Bangladesh, kidnapping the French ambassador to the Hague, and bombing a [[United Service Organizations]] (USO) nightclub in Naples, Italy. By the mid-1990s, their level of activity had declined and the US State Department no longer considered them a terrorist threat. In 2001, their leader announced the dissolution of the group, although some of its members were in prison and others were still wanted by police.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, pp. 157–58&lt;/ref&gt;

===Europe===
Typically small and urban-based, left-wing terrorist organizations in Europe have been committed to overthrowing their countries' governments and replacing them with regimes guided by Marxist–Leninist ideology. Although none have achieved any degree of success in accomplishing their goals, they have caused serious security problems in Germany, Belgium, Italy, Greece, France, Turkey, Portugal and Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Plushinsky, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt;

====Action Directe====

Following arrests of some of its members, the organization declined and became inactive.&lt;ref&gt;Pluchinsky, p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; The French government has banned the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |publisher=[[BBC News]] |title=Europe wary of banning parties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2217919.stm |date=28 August 2002 |accessdate=2007-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Communist Combatant Cells====
The [[Communist Combatant Cells]] (CCC) was founded in 1982 in Belgium by [[Pierre Carette]]. With about ten members, the CCC financed its activities through a series of bank robberies. Over the course of 14 months, they carried out 20 attacks against property, mostly [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) facilities. Despite attempts to avoid loss of life, there were casualties as a result of these attacks. After Carette and other members were arrested in 1985, the group ceased to be operational. Carette served 17 years of a life sentence, although his colleagues that were convicted with him were released earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Atkins, pp. 62–63&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[Image:bm-merelyplayers.jpg|thumb|right|Barry Morse, 1984]] --&gt;

'''''Merely Players''''' was a one-man stage show written and performed by [[Barry Morse]].  It examined the lives of a series of actors and others from [[Elizabethan]] times up to present day. The title is derived from lines by [[William Shakespeare]] in his play ''[[As You Like It]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;''All the world's a stage,''&lt;BR&gt;
''and all the men and women merely players:''&lt;BR&gt;
''They have their exits and their entrances;''&lt;BR&gt;
''and one man in his time plays many parts.''&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two-act drama included several vignettes from the life and career of "mere player" Barry Morse, features over a dozen characters (three of them women), and two musical numbers.  Looking for a stage piece that he could perform for benefits and fundraisers, in 1959 Morse debuted ''Merely Players'' on stage for the first time in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].  He later performed the show in [[New York City]] in 1965 (at the height of popularity of his television series ''[[The Fugitive (TV series)|The Fugitive]]'') and in other cities for various causes and concerns, as well as for fundraising for local and repertory theater companies in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]].

The most recent form of ''Merely Players'' coalesced in 1984 when Morse mounted a nationwide tour of Canada to raise both publicity and funds for the Performing Arts Lodges of Canada (PAL); retirement centers for performers (actors, singers, dancers, and others) who are connected to the performing arts. Following the tour, he continued to perform the show throughout North America for the next two decades, between television and film projects, including on a number of occasions to raise both funds and awareness for [[Parkinson's disease]] treatment and research. Morse died in February 2008.

Other significant productions of ''Merely Players'' included [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]] in 1993; [[Portland, Oregon]] and [[Eugene, Oregon]] in 1997; [[Calgary, Alberta]] in 2000; and [[Atlanta, Georgia]]; [[Columbus, Ohio]]; and [[Tampa, Florida]] in 2002. He also did a show at the King's Theater in Annapolis Royal Nova Scotia.

The book, ''Merely Players - The Scripts'', was published in 2003.  The following year, in 2004, Morse debuted the show in [[London, England]] at the Theatre Museum in Covent Garden as a benefit for The Royal Theatrical Fund.  A new comprehensive omnibus volume ''Presenting Barry Morse &amp; Merely Players'', edited by [[Robert E. Wood (painter, born 1971)|Robert E. Wood]] and [[Anthony Wynn]], is being readied for future publication, along with the release of the show on DVD.{{Update after|2011|7|20}}

[[File:Shrew Kate+P limp.jpg|thumb|[[Lynda Myles (American)|Lynda Myles]] and Maury Leo Erickson imitated older Tidewater accents as the stars of a 1975 [[The Taming of the Shrew in performance|''Taming of the Shrew'' performance]], set in the American South and directed by [[Keith Fowler]].]]
'''Older Southern American English''' was a set of [[American English]] dialects of the [[Southern United States]], primarily spoken by [[White Southerners]] up until the [[American Civil War]], moving towards a state of decline by the turn of the nineteenth century, further accelerated after [[World War II]] and again, finally, by the [[Civil Rights Movement]].&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 4"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; These dialects have since largely given way, on a larger regional level, to a more unified and younger [[Southern American English]], notably recognized today by a [[Southern American English|unique vowel shift]] and certain other vocabulary and accent characteristics. Some features unique to older Southern U.S. English persist today, though typically in only very localized dialects or speakers.

==History==
This group of [[American English]] dialects evolved over a period of several hundred years, primarily from older varieties of [[British English]] spoken by those who initially settled the area. Given that language is an entity that is constantly changing,&lt;ref&gt;Lippi-Green, R.  (1997).  English with an Accent.  New York, New York:  Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; the English of the colonists was quite different from any variety of English being spoken today. The colonists who initially settled the Tidewater area spoke a variety of [[Early Modern English]], which itself was very varied.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, W, &amp; Schilling-Estes, N. (2006). American English. Malden, Massachusetts: Blackwell Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The older Southern dialects thus originated in large part from a mix of the speech of immigrants from the [[British Isles]], who moved to the South in the 17th and 18th centuries, and the creole or post-creole speech of African slaves.

===Atlantic Coast===
The earliest English settlers of the colonies of Virginia and [[Massachusetts]] were mainly people from [[Southern England]].  However, Virginia received more colonists from the English [[West Country dialects|West Country]], bringing with them a distinctive dialect and vocabulary.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

The [[Boston, Massachusetts]]; [[Norfolk, Virginia]]; and [[Charleston, South Carolina]] areas maintained strong commercial and cultural ties to England. Thus, the colonists and their descendants defined "social class" according to England's connotations. As the upper class English dialect changed, the dialects of the upper class Americans in these areas changed. Two examples are the "''r''-dropping" (or [[rhoticity in English|non-rhoticity]]) of the late 18th and early 19th century, resulting in the similar ''r''-dropping found in Boston and parts of Virginia during the cultural "[[Old South]]," as well as the [[trap–bath split]], which came to define these same two areas (and other areas of the South that imitated this phenomenon) but virtually no other region of the United States.

Given that there are over 2.8 million people in the area,&lt;ref&gt;[http://tidewaterva.htu.myareaguide.com/demographics.html ]{{dead link|date=August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is difficult to account for all variants of the local accent, which have largely been supplanted by [[Southern American English|newer Southern features]]. The area is home to several large military bases such as [[Naval Station Norfolk]], Little Creek Amphibious Base, Oceana Naval Station, and Dam Neck Naval Base. Since a significant portion of the area's inhabitants are actually natives of other areas, there is constant linguistic exposure to other dialects. This exposure could be a reason why the younger generations do not exhibit most of the traditional features.

===Decline===
The growth of timber, coal, railroad, steel, textile, and tobacco mill industries throughout the South after the Civil War, along with the whole country's migration changes as a result, may have contributed to the expansion of a more unified Southern accent (now associated with the twentieth century), which gradually ousted nineteenth-century Southern accents. Before World War II, the demographic tendency of the South was out-migration, but after the war, a counter-tendency emerged. Now, a high in-migration of Northerners, especially toward urban areas of the South, may have been another motivation for the abandonment of older Southern accent features. Finally, the Civil Right Movement seems to have led white and black Southerners alike to resist accent features associated with the other racial group, and even develop newly distinguishing features, which may explain the sudden embracement of [[rhoticity in English|rhoticity]] among all white Southerners (and continued non-rhoticity among black Americans) since the middle of the twentieth century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|pp=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Lack of [[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-dropping|''Yod''-dropping]]: Pairs like ''do'' and ''due'', or ''toon'' and ''tune'', were often distinct in these dialects because words like ''due'', ''lute'', ''new'', etc. historically contained a [[Eɪ (IPA)|diphthong]] similar to {{IPA|/juː/}} (like the ''you'' sound in ''cute'' or ''puny'').&lt;ref&gt;Even in 2012 Random House Dictionary labels [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/due due], [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/new new] and [http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tune tune] as having the {{IPA|/yu/}} sound as a variant pronunciation.&lt;/ref&gt; (as England's [[Received Pronunciation|RP]] standard pronunciation still does), but Labov et al. report that the only Southern speakers who make a distinction today use a diphthong {{IPA|/ɪu/}} in such words.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt; They further report that speakers with the distinction are found primarily in [[North Carolina]] and northwest [[South Carolina]], and in a corridor extending from [[Jackson, Mississippi|Jackson]] to [[Tallahassee]]. For most of the South, this feature began disappearing after World War II.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 17"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**[[Phonological history of English consonant clusters#Yod-coalescence|''Yod''-coalescence]]: Words like ''dew'' were pronounced as "Jew", and ''Tuesday'' as "choose day."
* [[wine–whine merger|Wine–whine distinction]]: distinction between "w" and "wh" in words like "wine" and "whine", "witch and "which", etc.
* [[horse–hoarse merger|Horse–hoarse distinction]]: distinction between pairs of words like "horse" and "hoarse", "for" and "four", etc.
* [[Rhoticity in English|Rhoticity and non-rhoticity]]: The pronunciation of the ''r'' sound only before or between vowels, but not [[postvocalic consonant|after vowels]], is known as non-rhoticity and was historically associated with the major plantation regions of the South: specifically, the entire [[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]] and most of the South's Atlantic Coast in a band going west towards the [[Mississippi River]], as well as all of the [[Mississippi Embayment]] and some of the western [[Gulf Coastal Plain]]. This was presumably influenced by the non-rhotic East Anglia and London England pronunciation. Additionally, some older Southern dialects were even "variably non-rhotic in intra-word intervocalic contexts, as in ''carry'' [kʰæi]."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|pp=7–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhotic accents of the older Southern dialects, which fully pronounce all historical ''r'' sounds, were somewhat rarer and primarily spoken in [[Appalachia]], the eastern Gulf Coastal Plain, and the areas west of the Mississippi Embayment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|pp=3, 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Palatalization (sound change)|Palatalization]] of /k/ and /g/ before /ɑr/: Especially in the older South along the Atlantic Coast, the consonants {{IPAc-en|k}} (as in ''key'' or ''coo'') and {{IPAc-en|g}} (as in ''guy'' or ''go''), when before the sound {{IPAc-en|ɑr}} (as in ''car'' or ''barn''), were often pronounced with the tongue fronted towards the [[hard palate]]. Thus, for example, ''garden'' in older Southern was something like "gyah(r)den" {{IPA|[ˈgjɑː(ɹ)dən]}} and "cart" like "kyah(r)t" {{IPA|[cʰjɑː(ɹ)t]}}. This pronunciation feature was in decline by the late 1800s.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 17"/&gt;
* Lack or near-lack of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} glide weakening: The gliding vowel in words like ''prize'' (but less commonly in ''price'' or other situations of this vowel appearing before a [[voiceless consonant]]) commonly has a "weakened" glide today in the South; however, this only became a documented feature since the last quarter of the 1800s and was otherwise absent or inconsistent in earlier Southern dialects. Today, the lack of glide weakening persists in the [[High Tider]] and updated Lowcountry accents. Full weakening has become a defining feature only of the modern Southern dialects, particularly the most advanced sub-varieties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|pp=10–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mary–marry–merry merger|Mary–marry–merry distinction]]: Unlike most of the U.S. and modern Southern, older Southern did not merge the following three vowels before /r/: [e~eə] (as in ''Mary''), [æ] (as in ''marry''), and [ɛ] (as in ''merry''). Although the three are now merging or merged in modern Southern English, the "marry" class of words remains the least likely among modern Southerners to merge with the other two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Clear /l/ between front vowels: Unlike modern Southern and General American English's universally [[dark L|"dark" /l/]] sound (often represented as [ɫ]), older Southern pronunciation had a "clear" (i.e. [[velarization|non-velarized]]) /l/ sound whenever /l/ appears between [[front vowel]]s, as in the words ''silly'', ''mealy'', ''Nellie'', etc.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 17"/&gt;
*''Was'', ''what'' and ''of'' pronounced with [ɑ]: The stressed word ''what'', for example, rhymed with ''cot'' (not with ''cut'', as it does elsewhere in the U.S.).&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 6"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*No [[Happy-tensing|''happy''-tensing]]: The final vowel of words like ''happy, silly, monkey, parties,'' etc. were not tensed as they are in newer Southern and other U.S. dialects, meaning that this vowel sounded more like the {{IPA|[ɪ]}} of ''fit'' than the {{IPA|[i]}} of ''feet''.
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, as in ''goat, toe, robe'', etc., kept a back starting place (unlike most Southern since World War II, but like most Northern U.S. dialects today); this became an [[open vowel|opener]] {{IPA|[ɔu~ɒu]}} in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 6"/&gt; The modern fronted form of the Atlantic South started as far back as the 1800s in northeastern North Carolina, in the form {{IPA|[ɜy]}}, but only spread slowly, until accelerating after World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ʃ|r}} pronounced as {{IPA|[sɹ]}} (e.g. causing ''shrimp'', ''shrub'', etc. to sound like ''srimp'', ''srub'', etc.); this feature was reported earliest in Virginia.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 18"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Plantation South====
[[Image:Black belt counties.png|thumb|right|275px|The Black Belt in dark purple approximates the Plantation Southern dialect region, excluding the Lowcountry (the Atlantic coast of South Carolina and Georgia).]]
Older speech of the [[Plantations in the American South|Plantation South]] or "[[Black Belt (U.S. region)|Black Belt]]" included those features above, plus:
*Non-rhoticity: ''R''-dropping historically occurred in the greater central sections of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, and in coastal Texas and some other coastal communities of the Gulf states. Rhoticity (or ''r''-fulness) was more likely outside of the Black Belt proper, in the southernmost sections of Georgia, Alabama, and Mississippi, as well as in northern Florida, western Louisiana, and eastern Texas.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 16"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Trap–bath split]]: Words like ''bath'', ''dance'', and ''ask'', used a different vowel ({{IPA|[æ̈ɛ~æ̈e]}}) than words like ''trap'', ''cat'', and ''rag'' ({{IPA|[æ~æ̈ɛæ̈]}}).&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 8"/&gt; A similarly-organized (though different-sounding) split occurs in [[Standard British English]].
*{{IPAc-en|eɪ}}, as in ''face'', was inconsistently pronounced {{IPA-all|e̝ː|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, as in ''goat'', was inconsistently pronounced {{IPA-all|o̝ː|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ʌ}}, as in ''strut'', was [[conservative (linguistics)|conservative]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ɔɪ}}, as in ''choice'', was {{IPA-all|oɛ~oə|}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ɝ}}, as in ''nurse'', was predominantly [[Rhoticity_in_English#Up-gliding_Nurse|up-gliding, non-rhotic]] {{IPA|[ɜɪ]}} in the "Deep South" (all the Plantation South except North Carolina).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appalachia===
{{Main|Appalachian English}}
Due to the former isolation of some regions of the [[Appalachia]]n South, the [[Appalachian accent]] may be difficult for some outsiders to understand. This dialect is also rhotic, meaning speakers pronounce Rs wherever they appear in words, and sometimes when they do not (for example, "worsh" or "warsh" for "wash"). Because of the extensive length of the mountain chain, noticeable variation also exists within this subdialect.

The Southern Appalachian dialect can be heard, as its name implies, in [[north Georgia]], [[north Alabama]], [[east Tennessee]], [[Upstate South Carolina|northwestern South Carolina]], [[western North Carolina]], [[Eastern Kentucky Coalfield|eastern Kentucky]], [[Southwest Virginia|southwestern Virginia]], [[western Maryland]], and [[West Virginia]]. Southern Appalachian speech patterns, however, are not entirely confined to the mountain regions previously listed.

The dialect here is often thought to be a window into the past, with various claims being made that it is either a pocket of Elizabethan English which survived or the way that the Scots-Irish-origin people that make up a large fraction of the population there would have spoken. However, these are both incorrect. Though some of the distinctive words used in Appalachia have origins in the Anglo-Scottish border region, the origins of the region's pronunciations lie in Southern England. A more realistic comparison is the way that people in North America would have spoken in the Colonial period.

Researchers have noted that the dialect retains a lot of vocabulary with roots in "[[Early Modern English]]" owing to the make-up of the early European settlers to the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wvculture.org/history/journal_wvh/wvh30-2.html |title=The Dialect of the Appalachian People |publisher=Wvculture.org |date= |accessdate=2012-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charleston===
[[South Carolina Lowcountry|The Lowcountry]], most famously centering on the cities of [[Charleston, South Carolina]] and [[Savannah, Georgia]], once constituted its own entirely unique English dialect region. Traditionally often recognized as a '''Charleston accent''', it included these additional features, most of which no longer exist today:&lt;ref name="Labov 2006 259-61"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=259–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[near-square merger|Cheer–chair merger]] towards {{IPA|[ɪə~eə]}}.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 12"/&gt;
*Non-rhoticity (or ''r''-dropping).
*A possibility of both variants of [[Canadian raising]]: 
**{{IPAc-en|aɪ}} pronounced as something like as {{IPA|[ɑe]}}, but possibly {{IPA|[ɐɪ]}} before a voiceless consonant.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 11–12"/&gt;
**{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} pronounced as {{IPA|[aʊ]}}, but {{IPA|[əʉ~ɜʉ]}} before a voiceless consonant.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 11–12"/&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|eɪ}} pronounced as {{IPA|[ɪə~eə]}} in a [[closed syllable]], {{IPA|[ɪː~eː]}} in an [[open syllable]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|oʊ}} pronounced as {{IPA|[oə~uə]}} in a closed syllable, {{IPA|[o~u]}} in an open syllable.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː}} pronounced as {{IPA|[ɔ~o]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ɑː}} pronounced as {{IPA|[æ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ɜr}} pronounced as {{IPA|[əɪ]}}.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 8"/&gt;

===Pamlico and Chesapeake===
{{main|High Tider}}
The "[[Down East (North Carolina)|Down East]]" [[Outer Banks|Outer Banks coastal region]] of [[Carteret County, North Carolina]], and adjacent [[Pamlico Sound]], including [[Ocracoke, North Carolina|Ocracoke]] and [[Harkers Island]], are known for additional features, some of which are still spoken today by generations-long residents of its [[Unincorporated area|unincorporated]] coastal and island communities, which have largely been geographically and economically isolated from the rest of North Carolina and the South since their first settlement by English-speaking Europeans. The same is true for the very similar dialect area of the [[Delmarva]] (Delaware&amp;ndash;Maryland&amp;ndash;Virginia) Peninsula and neighboring islands in the [[Chesapeake Bay]], such as [[Tangier, Virginia|Tangier]] and [[Smith Island, Maryland|Smith Island]]. These two regions historically share many common pronunciation features, sometimes collectively called a High Tider (or "Hoi Toider") accent, including:
*Rhoticity (or ''r''-fulness, like in most U.S. English, but unlike in most other older Atlantic Southern dialects)
*{{IPAc-en|aɪ}}, such as the vowel in the words ''high tide'', retaining its glide and being pronounced beginning further back in the mouth, as {{IPA|[ɑe]}} or even rounded {{IPA|[ɒe~ɐɒe]}}, often stereotyped as sounding like "hoi toid," giving Pamlico Sound's residents the name "[[High Tider]]s."&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 4, 11"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|pp=4, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|æ}} is raised to {{IPA|[ɛ]}} (so ''cattle'' sounds like ''kettle''); {{IPAc-en|ɛ}} is raised to {{IPA|[e~ɪ]}} (so that ''mess'' sounds like ''miss''); and, most prominently, {{IPAc-en|ɪ}} is raised to {{IPA|[i]}} (so ''fish'' sounds like ''feesh'').&lt;ref&gt;Wolfram, Walt (1997). ''Hoi Toide on the Outer Banks: The Story of the Ocracoke Brogue''. University of North Carolina Press. p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; This mirrors the second and third stages of the Southern Vowel Shift (see under "Newer phonology"), despite this particular accent never participating in the very first stage of the shift.
*{{IPAc-en|ɔː}} pronounced as {{IPA|[ɔ~o]}}, similar to modern Australian or London English.
*{{IPAc-en|aʊ}}, as in ''loud, town, scrounge,'' etc., pronounced with a fronted glide as {{IPA|[aɵ~aø~aε]}}.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 12"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before a voiceless consonant, this same phoneme is {{IPA|[ɜʉ~ɜy]}}.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 11–12"/&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|ɛər}}, as in ''chair, square, bear,'' etc., as {{IPA|[æɚ]}}.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 12"/&gt;
*[[English-language vowel changes before historic r#Card–cord merger|Card–cord merger]] since at least the 1800s in the Delmarva Peninsula.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 12"/&gt;

===Piedmont and Tidewater Virginia===
[[File:Virginia painted relief.png|thumb|right|The old Virginia accent was mostly spoken in the central and eastern regions of the state, excluding the [[Eastern Shore of Virginia]] on the [[Delmarva Peninsula]].]]
The major central ([[Piedmont (United States)|Piedmont]]) and eastern ([[Tidewater region|Tidewater]]) regions of Virginia, excluding Virginia's [[Eastern Shore of Virginia|Eastern Shore]], once spoke in a way long associated with the upper or [[Aristocracy|aristocratic]] [[plantations in the American South|plantation]] class in the [[Old South]], often known as a '''Tidewater accent'''. Additional phonological features of this Atlantic Southern variety included:
*Non-rhoticity (or ''r''-dropping).
*[[Trap–bath split]]: pronunciation of the ''bath'' set of words as {{IPA|[æ̈ɛ~æ̈e]}}, different from the ''trap'' set of words as {{IPA|[æ~æ̈ɛæ̈]}}.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 8"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|p=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A possibility of both variants of [[Canadian raising]]: 
**{{IPAc-en|aʊ}} pronounced as {{IPA|[aʊ]}}, but {{IPA|[əʉ~ɜʉ]}} before a voiceless consonant.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 11–12"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;
**{{IPAc-en|aɪ}} pronounced as something like {{IPA|[aε~aæ]}}, but possibly {{IPA|[ɐɪ]}} before a voiceless consonant.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 11–12"/&gt;
*{{IPAc-en|eɪ}} pronounced as {{IPA|[ɛ]}} in certain words, making ''bake'' sound like "beck", and ''afraid'' like "uh Fred."
*In [[Tidewater region|Tidewater Virginia]] particularly:
**Some of the "bath" words (''aunt'', ''rather'', and, earlier, ''pasture'', etc.) pronounced farther back in mouth, as {{IPA|[ɒ~ɑ]}}.
**{{IPAc-en|ɜr}}, as in ''bird, earth, flirt'', etc. pronounced as {{IPA|[ɜ&lt;sup&gt;ɹ&lt;/sup&gt;]}}, weakly rhotic, with a less common non-rhotic variant {{IPA|[ɜ]}} possible as well.&lt;ref name="Thomas 2006 8"/&gt;
**"Broad ''a''" (as in ''palm, father, spa,'' etc.) shifted towards a rounded {{IPA|[ɒː]}}, potentially causing, for example, ''palm'' and ''harm'' to rhyme.

===Southern Louisiana===
Southern [[Louisiana]], as well as some of southeast [[Texas]] ([[Houston]] to [[Beaumont, Texas|Beaumont]]), and coastal [[Mississippi]], feature a number of dialects influenced by other languages beyond English. Most of southern Louisiana constitutes [[Acadiana]], dominated for hundreds of years by monolingual speakers of [[Cajun French]],&lt;ref name="Dubois 2"&gt;Dubois, Sylvia and Barbara Horvath (2004). "Cajun Vernacular English: phonology." In Bernd Kortmann and Edgar W. Schneider (Ed). ''A Handbook of Varieties of English: A Multimedia Reference Tool.'' New York: Mouton de Gruyter. p. 412-4.&lt;/ref&gt; which combines elements of [[Acadian French]] with other French and Spanish words. This French dialect is spoken by many of the older members of the [[Cajun]] ethnic group and is said to be dying out. A related language called [[Louisiana Creole French|Louisiana Creole]] also exists. The older English of Southern Louisiana did not participate in certain general older Southern English phenomena, for example lacking the Plantation South's [[trap–bath split]] and the fronting of {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2006|pp=8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[New Orleans English]] was likely developing in the early 1900s, in large part due to [[New York City English|dialect influence]] from New York City immigrants in New Orleans.

==Grammar and vocabulary==
* Zero copula in third person plural and second person.  This is historically a consequence of [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|''R''-dropping]], with e.g. ''you're'' merging with ''you''.
*:You [Ø] taller than Louise.
*:They [Ø] gonna leave today (Cukor-Avila, 2003).
* Use of the circumfix ''a- . . . -in''' in [[progressive tense]]s.
*:He was a-hootin' and a-hollerin'.
*:The wind was a-howlin'.
* The use of ''like to'' to mean ''nearly''; ''liked to'' merging into ''like to''
*:I like to had a heart attack. (I nearly had a heart attack)
* The use of the simple past infinitive vs [[present perfect]] infinitive.
*: I like to had. ''vs'' I like to have had.
*: We were supposed to went. ''vs'' We were supposed to have gone.
* Use of "yonder" as a locative in addition to its more widely attested use as an adjective.
*:They done gathered a mess of raspberries in them woods down ''yonder''.

==Current projects==
A project devised by [[Old Dominion University]] Assistant Professor Dr. Bridget Anderson entitled ''Tidewater Voices: Conversations in Southeastern Virginia'' was initiated in late 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://hamptonroads.com/2009/01/odu-team-records-areas-accent-english-deep-roots|title = ODU team records area's accent - English with 'deep roots'|date = January 22, 2009|accessdate = November 15, 2014|website = hamptonroads.com|publisher = The Virginian Pilot|last = Batts|first = Denise}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In collecting oral histories from natives of the area, this study offers insight to not only specific history of the region, but also to linguistic phonetic variants native to the area as well.

'''Outsider art''' is art by [[Autodidacticism|self-taught]] or [[naïve art]] makers. Typically, those labeled as outsider artists have little or no contact with the [[mainstream]] [[art world]] or art institutions. In many cases, their work is discovered only after their deaths. Often, outsider art illustrates extreme [[Mental state|mental states]], unconventional ideas, or elaborate [[fantasy world]]s.

The term ''outsider art'' was coined by [[art critic]] [[Roger Cardinal]] in 1972 as an [[English language|English]] synonym for '''''art brut''''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁ bʁyt|lang}}, "raw art" or "rough art"), a label created by [[France|French]] [[artist]] [[Jean Dubuffet]] to describe [[art]] created outside the boundaries of official culture; Dubuffet focused particularly on art by those on the outside of the established art scene, using as examples [[psychiatric hospital]] patients and children.&lt;ref&gt;Roger Cardinal, ''Outsider Art,'' London, 1972&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bibliography The 20th Century Art Book. New York, NY: Phaidon Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Outsider art has emerged as a successful art marketing category; an annual [[Outsider Art Fair]]&lt;ref name="Outsider Art Fair"&gt;{{cite web|title=Outsider Art Fair|url=http://www.outsiderartfair.com/|website=Outsider Art Fair|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has taken place in [[New York City|New York]] since 1993, and there are at least two regularly published journals dedicated to the subject. The term is sometimes misapplied as a catch-all marketing label for art created by people who are outside the [[mainstream]] "art world" or "art gallery system", regardless of their circumstances or the content of their work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pantograph-punch.com/post/outsider-art "What the Dickens is Outsider Art?" The Pantograph Punch, December 2016, retrieved 2017-01-16]&lt;/ref&gt; A more specific term, "[[outsider music]]", was later adapted for musicians.

== Art of the mentally ill ==
{{See also|Creativity and mental illness}}
Interest in the art of the mentally ill, along with [[Children's art|that of children]] and the makers of "[[peasant art]]", was first demonstrated by "[[Der Blaue Reiter]]" group: [[Wassily Kandinsky]], [[Auguste Macke]], [[Franz Marc]], [[Alexej Jawlensky]], and others. What the artists perceived in the work of these groups was an expressive power born of their perceived lack of sophistication. Examples of this were reproduced in 1912 in the first and only issue of their publication, ''Der Blaue Reiter Almanac''. During [[World War I]], Macke was killed at [[First Battle of Champagne|Champagne]] in 1914 and Marc was killed at [[Battle of Verdun|Verdun]] in 1916; the gap left by these deaths was to some extent filled by [[Paul Klee]], who continued to draw inspiration from these 'primitives'.

Interest in the art of [[Psychiatric hospital|insane asylum]] inmates continued to grow in the 1920s. In 1921, Dr. [[Walter Morgenthaler]] published his book ''Ein Geisteskranker als Künstler'' (''A Psychiatric Patient as Artist'') about [[Adolf Wölfli]], a [[psychotic]] mental patient in his care. Wölfli had spontaneously taken up drawing, and this activity seemed to calm him. His most outstanding work was an illustrated epic of 45 volumes in which he narrated his own imaginary life story. With 25,000 pages, 1,600 illustrations, and 1,500 collages, it is a monumental work. Wölfli also produced a large number of smaller works, some of which were sold or given as gifts. His work is on display at the [[Adolf Wölfli Foundation]] in the [[Museum of Fine Arts Bern|Museum of Fine Art]], [[Bern]].

A defining moment was the publication of ''Bildnerei der Geisteskranken'' (''[[Artistry of the mentally ill]]'') in 1922, by Dr. [[Hans Prinzhorn]]. This was the first formal study of psychiatric works, based upon a compilation of thousands of examples from European institutions. The book and the art collection gained much attention from avant-garde artists of the time, including Paul Klee, [[Max Ernst]], and [[Jean Dubuffet]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rawvision.com/what-outsider-art "Outsider Art Sourcebook" (Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.4)]&lt;/ref&gt;

People with some formal artistic training as well as well-established artists are not immune from mental illness, and may also be institutionalized. For example, [[William Kurelek]], later awarded the [[Order of Canada]] for his artistic life work, as a young man was admitted to the [[Maudsley Hospital|Maudsley Psychiatric Hospital]] where he was treated for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://courses.cit.cornell.edu/psych431_nbb421/student2003/epl8/ Cornell case study: Early Onset Schizophrenia – William Kurelek]&lt;/ref&gt; In hospital he painted, producing ''The Maze'', a dark depiction of his [[tortured artist|tortured youth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/reprint/179/5/0.pdf ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' (2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; He was transferred from the Maudsley to [[Netherne Hospital]] from November 1953 to January 1955, to work with [[Edward Adamson]] (1911–1996), a pioneer of [[art therapy]], and creator of the Adamson Collection.

== Jean Dubuffet and ''art brut''==
[[File:Losanna, collection de l'art brut, 05.JPG|thumb|View inside the [[Collection de l'art brut]] museum, [[Lausanne]].|244x244px]]

[[France|French]] artist [[Jean Dubuffet]] was particularly struck by ''Bildnerei der Geisteskranken'' and began his own collection of such art, which he called ''art brut'' or ''raw art''. In 1948 he formed the [[Compagnie de l'Art Brut]] along with other artists, including [[André Breton]]. The collection he established became known as the [[Collection de l'art brut]]. It contains thousands of works and is now permanently housed in [[Lausanne]], Switzerland.

Dubuffet characterized art brut as: 
:"Those works created from [[solitude]] and from pure and authentic creative impulses – where the worries of competition, acclaim and social promotion do not interfere – are, because of these very facts, more precious than the productions of professionals. After a certain familiarity with these flourishings of an exalted feverishness, lived so fully and so intensely by their authors, we cannot avoid the feeling that in relation to these works, cultural art in its entirety appears to be the game of a futile society, a fallacious parade." — Jean Dubuffet. Place à l'incivisme (Make way for Incivism). ''Art and Text'' no.27 (December 1987 – February 1988). p.36  Dubuffet's writing on ''art brut'' was the subject of a noted program at the Art Club of Chicago in the early 1950s.

Dubuffet argued that 'culture', that is mainstream culture, managed to assimilate every new development in art, and by doing so took away whatever power it might have had. The result was to asphyxiate genuine expression. Art brut was his solution to this problem – only art brut was immune to the influences of culture, immune to being absorbed and assimilated, because the artists themselves were not willing or able to be assimilated.

== Cultural context ==
The interest in "outsider" practices among twentieth-century artists and critics can be seen as part of a larger emphasis on the rejection of established values within the [[modernist]] art milieu. The early part of the 20th century gave rise to [[Cubism]] and the [[Dada]], [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivist]] and [[Futurism (art)|Futurist]] movements in art, all of which involved a dramatic movement away from cultural forms of the past. Dadaist [[Marcel Duchamp]], for example, abandoned "painterly" technique to allow chance operations a role in determining the form of his works, or simply to re-contextualize existing "readymade" objects as art. Mid-century artists, including [[Pablo Picasso]], looked outside the traditions of high culture for inspiration, drawing from the artifacts of "primitive" societies, the unschooled artwork of children, and vulgar advertising graphics. Dubuffet's championing of the ''art brut'' – of the insane and others at the margins of society – is yet another example of avant-garde art challenging established cultural values.

== Terminology ==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2013}}
[[File:JoeMinter'sAfricanVillageInAmerica1.jpg|thumb]][[File:AfricanVillageInAmerica2.jpg|thumb|Two images of Joe Minter's ''African Village in America'', a half-acre [[Visionary environments|visionary art environment]] in [[Birmingham, Alabama]]. Scenes include African warriors watching their descendants’ struggles in Alabama, tributes to black scientists and military leaders, recreations of the epic civil rights confrontations in Alabama, and biblical scenes.]]
A number of terms are used to describe art that is loosely understood as "outside" of [[official culture]].  Definitions of these terms vary and overlap.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brut Force|title=The Many Terms in Our Continuum|url=http://brutforce.com/many-terms-continuum-outsider-art/|website=Brut Force|accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The editors of ''[[Raw Vision]]'', a leading journal in the field, suggest that "Whatever views we have about the value of controversy itself, it is important to sustain creative discussion by way of an agreed vocabulary". Consequently, they lament the use of "outsider artist" to refer to almost any untrained artist. "It is not enough to be untrained, clumsy or naïve. Outsider Art is virtually synonymous with Art Brut in both spirit and meaning, to that rarity of art produced by those who do not know its name."

*Art Brut: literally translated from French means "raw art";  'Raw' in that it has not been through the 'cooking' process: the world of art schools, galleries, museums. Originally art by psychotic individuals who existed almost completely outside culture and society. Strictly speaking it refers only to the [[Collection de l'art brut]].
*[[Folk art]]: Folk art originally suggested crafts and decorative skills associated with peasant communities in Europe – though presumably it could equally apply to any indigenous culture. It has broadened to include any product of practical craftsmanship and decorative skill – everything from chain-saw animals to hub-cap buildings. A key distinction between folk and outsider art is that folk art typically embodies traditional forms and social values, where outsider art stands in some marginal relationship to society's mainstream.
*[[Intuitive art]] / [[Visionary art]]: ''Raw Vision Magazine'''s preferred general terms for outsider art. It describes them as deliberate umbrella terms. However, Visionary Art unlike other definitions here can often refer to the subject matter of the works, which includes images of a spiritual or religious nature. Intuitive art is probably the most general term available. [[Intuit: The Center for Intuitive and Outsider Art]] based in Chicago operates a museum dedicated to the study and exhibition of intuitive and outsider art.  The [[American Visionary Art Museum]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] is dedicated to the collection and display of visionary art.
*&lt;!--redirected--&gt;Marginal art/Art singulier: Essentially the same as ''Neuve Invention''; refers to artists on the margins of the art world.
*[[Naïve art]]: Another term commonly applied to untrained artists who aspire to "normal" artistic status, i.e. they have a much more conscious interaction with the mainstream art world than do outsider artists.
*[[Neuve invention]]: Used to describe artists who, although marginal, have some interaction with mainstream culture. They may be doing art part-time for instance. The expression was coined by Dubuffet too; strictly speaking it refers only to a special part of the [[Collection de l'art brut]].
*[[Visionary environments]]: Buildings and sculpture parks built by visionary artists – range from decorated houses, to large areas incorporating a large number of individual sculptures with a tightly associated theme. Examples include [[Watts Towers]] by [[Simon Rodia]], [[Buddha Park]] and [[Sala Keoku]] by [[Luang Pu Bunleua Sulilat|Bunleua Sulilat]], and The [[Palais Ideal]] by [[Ferdinand Cheval]].

*[[Friedrich Schröder Sonnenstern]] (1892–1982) was a German painter who achieved fame and notoriety in the 1950s and 60s for his scabrous, often erotic works.
*[[Judith Scott (artist)|Judith Scott]] (1943–2005) was born [[Deafness|deaf]] and with [[Down Syndrome]]. After being institutionalized for 35 years she attended [[Creative Growth Art Center]] (a center for artists with disabilities in Oakland, CA) and went on to become an internationally renowned [[fiber art]] sculptor. 
*[[Richard Shaver|Richard Sharpe Shaver]] (1907–1975) produced photographs, paintings, drawings and writing connected to his unorthodox theories about the history of life on Earth. He believed that certain stones were actually image-filled "rock books" created by an ancient superior race, and that sadistic descendants of those ancients live inside the earth, using ancient "ray" machines to torment humankind.  His paintings, based on rock slices, often incorporate unusual materials such as soap flakes.
* [[Charles Steffen]] (1927–1995), [[Chicago]] artist, made art while institutionalized. 
* [[Kea Tawana]] (born c. 1935), American sculptor who created the ''Ark'', an 86-foot-long ship made from architectural salvage in a vacant lot in [[Newark, New Jersey]].
* [[Miroslav Tichý]] (1926–2011) was a photographer who took thousands of surreptitious pictures of women in his hometown of [[Kyjov (Hodonín District)|Kyjov]] in the [[Czech Republic]], using homemade cameras constructed of cardboard tubes, tin cans and other at-hand materials. 
* [[Harry Underwood]] (born 1969) is a self-taught American painter known for his use of stenciled images and literary elements atop wood panels, described by one critic as "a cocktail of realism, surrealism, and pop, of Edward Hopper meets Salvador Dali meets Andy Warhol". He grew up in a deeply religious household and was expelled from high school, later taking up painting while working as a laborer. Despite his expulsion from high school, his works contain complex literary elements, often weaving the painting into a full story in relatively few words.
* [[Pierre Vuitton]] (1880–1962), French artist. After being severely wounded, both physically and psychologically, in World War I, Vuitton abandoned his previous life as the child of wealthy merchants. After several stays in sanitariums and mental hospitals, he moved to Paris in 1920. A user of morphine and alcohol, he lived as a casual laborer in poverty despite the occasional sale of his pictures. His first works were probably during the war years; later he developed "time-excesses" in which he reportedly spent several days painting without eating or sleeping. Increasingly, however, his deteriorating mental condition spoiled any binding relationship, so he spent most of his later life in mental hospitals or in nursing homes. 
*[[:en:Willem van Genk|Willem van Genk]] (1927–2005) is the best known Dutch representative of outsider art.

The '''Ponsonby Rule''' was a [[Constitutional convention (political custom)|constitutional convention]] in the [[United Kingdom]] [[constitutional law]] that dictated that most international [[treaty|treaties]] had to be laid before [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|Parliament]] 21 days before [[ratification]].

On 11 November 2010, Part 2 of the [[Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010]] was brought into force by a commencement order.&lt;ref&gt;The Constitutional Reform and Governance Act 2010 (Commencement No. 3) Order 2010 [http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2010/2703/contents/made]&lt;/ref&gt; which deals with the ratification of treaties and puts parliamentary scrutiny of treaties on a statutory footing. That changed the convention into a provision having legal force.

==History==
From the late 19th century it became the common practice to present the treaties of the United Kingdom to Parliament after they had come into force.

On 1 April 1924, during the second reading debate on the [[Treaty of Lausanne|Treaty of Peace (Turkey)]] Bill, Mr [[Arthur Ponsonby, 1st Baron Ponsonby of Shulbrede|Arthur Ponsonby]] ([[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs]] in [[Ramsay MacDonald]]'s first [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Government) made the following statement: 
{{quote|It is the intention of His Majesty's Government to lay on the table of both Houses of Parliament every treaty, when signed, for a period of 21 days, after which the treaty will be ratified and published and circulated in the Treaty Series. In the case of important treaties, the Government will, of course, take an opportunity of submitting them to the House for discussion within this period. But, as the Government cannot take upon itself to decide what may be considered important or unimportant, if there is a formal demand for discussion forwarded through the usual channels from the Opposition or any other party, time will be found for the discussion of the Treaty in question.}}

At the same time, he stated that:

{{quote|Resolutions expressing Parliamentary approval of every Treaty before ratification would be a very cumbersome form of procedure and would burden the House with a lot of unnecessary business. The absence of disapproval may be accepted as sanction, and publicity and opportunity for discussion and criticism are the really material and valuable elements which henceforth will be introduced.}}

The Ponsonby Rule was withdrawn during the subsequent [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]] Government, but was reinstated in 1929 and gradually hardened into a practice observed by all successive governments.

==Other countries==

The practice on legislative approval of treaties before [[ratification]] varies from country to country. In most countries, the constitution requires most treaties to be approved by the legislature before they can formally enter into force and bind the country in question. This is particularly the case in states where international treaties become part of domestic law directly, without the need for special implementation as required in the case of the United Kingdom.

In countries with a strong [[separation of powers]], this may lead to treaties being signed by the executive, but not coming into force because of legislative opposition.

In the [[United States]], the [[President of the United States|president]] must submit treaties to the [[United States Senate|Senate]] for its advice and consent to ratification, which requires a two-thirds vote. A famous example of a treaty not receiving consent is the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which ended [[World War I]], because of opposition to the [[League of Nations]]. 

In [[Australia]], the opposite situation exists although the practical effect does not greatly differ. The executive (that is, the [[Australian Federal Government]]) may enter into a binding treaty without the involvement of Parliament. The [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Australia)|Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] states "The power to enter into treaties is an executive power within Section 61 of the Australian Constitution and accordingly, is the formal responsibility of the Executive rather than the Parliament"&lt;ref&gt;See {{cite web |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/treaties/making/making2.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101216122431/http://dfat.gov.au/treaties/making/making2.html |archivedate=16 December 2010 |df=dmy-all }} ''Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade'' (accessed 19 December 2010)&lt;/ref&gt; and discusses the issues surrounding this fact, including the way treaties are handled in practice (which does involve Parliament). Implementation of treaties does require legislation by federal parliament, following [[Section 51(xxix) of the Australian Constitution]]. Treaties must be signed by the [[Governor-General of Australia]].

'''Project Gutenberg Australia''', abbreviated as '''PGA''', is an [[Internet]] site which was founded in 2001 by Colin Choat. It is a sister site of [[Project Gutenberg]], though there is no formal relationship between the two organizations. The site hosts free [[ebook]]s or [[e-text]]s which are in the [[public domain]] in [[Australia]]. Volunteers have prepared and submitted the ebooks.

To complement the extensive amount of original source material available in the form of ebooks, a great deal of information about the [[History of Australia|history]] and the [[European maritime exploration of Australia|exploration of Australia]] is provided, together with a "Library of Australiana", a list of ebooks available about Australia or written by Australians.

Because of differences between [[Australian copyright law|Australian]] and [[United States copyright law|United States]] (where Project Gutenberg is based) [[copyright law]], Project Gutenberg Australia contains many works not available in Project Gutenberg, including works by [[Margaret Mitchell]], [[George Orwell]], [[Ayn Rand]], [[H. P. Lovecraft]], [[Edgar Wallace]], [[S. S. Van Dine]] and [[Dylan Thomas]].

With the introduction of the [[U.S.-Australia Free Trade Agreement]], works of authors who died after 31 December 1954 will now not enter the public domain in Australia until at least 1 January 2026. However, all such works which were already public domain under Australian law as of the end of 2004 remain in the public domain, and thus continue to be hosted at Project Gutenberg of Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gutenberg.net.au/newsandreviews.html Project Gutenberg Australia, News and Reviews], section ''Changes to Australian Copyright Law''&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States]], which has an English [[common law]] tradition, the concept of a [[right to keep and bear arms]] was recognized prior to the creation of a written national constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McAffee |first1=Thomas B. |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael J. |year=1997 |title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, or Precedent Stand In The Way? |url=http://scholars.law.unlv.edu/facpub/512/ |journal=Scholarly Works |volume=Paper 512}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Patriot (American Revolution)|colonists]] in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] rebelled against [[Kingdom of Great Britain|British]] control during the [[American Revolution]] they cited the 1689 English [[Bill of Rights 1689|Bill of Rights]] as an example.

== English precedent ==
{{see also|Assize of Arms of 1181}}
The American understanding of the right to keep and bear arms was influenced by the 1689 [[English Bill of Rights]], an [[Act of Parliament]], which also dealt with personal defence by [[Protestant]] English subjects.

The Bill of Rights did not create a new right to have arms but rather rescinded and deplored acts of the deposed King [[James II of England|James II]], a [[Roman Catholic]], who had forced the disarming of [[Protestant]]s, while arming and deploying armed Catholics contrary to Law (among other alleged violations of individual rights). The Bill of Rights provided that Protestants could bear arms for their defence as permitted by law. It also established that the power to regulate the right to bear arms belonged to Parliament, not the monarch.&lt;ref name="c21WillMarSess2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statutelaw.gov.uk/content.aspx?activeTextDocId=1518621|title=1688 c.2 1 Will. and Mar. Sess. 2|publisher=Statutelaw.gov.uk|accessdate=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[William Blackstone]] wrote in the eighteenth century about the right to have arms being auxiliary to the "natural right of resistance and self-preservation", but conceded that the right was subject to their suitability and allowance by law.

{{Quote|The fifth and last auxiliary right of the subject, that I shall at present mention, is that of having arms for their defence, suitable to their condition and degree, and such as are allowed by law. Which is also declared by the same statute and is indeed a public allowance, under due restrictions, of the natural right of resistance and self-preservation, when the sanctions of society and laws are found insufficient to restrain the violence of oppression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/18th_century/blackstone_bk1ch1.asp |title=Blackstone's Commentaries on the Laws of England |publisher=Avalon.law.yale.edu |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Civilian usage meaning ==
In ''[[United States v. Cruikshank]]'' (1876), the U.S. Supreme Court recognized that the right to arms preexisted the Constitution and in that case and in ''[[Presser v. Illinois]]'' (1886) recognized that the Second Amendment protected the right from being infringed by Congress. In ''[[United States v. Miller]]'' (1939), the Court again recognized that the right to arms is individually held and, citing the Tennessee case of ''Aymette v State'', indicated that it protected the right to keep and bear arms that are "part of the ordinary military equipment" or the use of which could "contribute to the common defense." In its first opportunity to rule specifically on whose right the Second Amendment protects, ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), the Court ruled that the amendment protects an individual right "to keep and carry arms in case of confrontation," not contingent on service in a militia, while indicating, in dicta, that restrictions on the possession of firearms by felons and the mentally ill, on the carrying of arms in sensitive locations, and with respect to the conditions on the sale of firearms could pass constitutional muster. In the 2010 case of McDonald v. Chicago, the Court applied incorporation doctrine to extend the Second Amendment's protections nationwide.

Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service.

Similarly, in a released Senate report on the Right to Keep and Bear Arms, Senator [[Orrin Hatch]], chairman, U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution, states:

{{quote|They argue that the Second Amendment's words "right of the people" mean "a right of the state"&amp;nbsp;– apparently overlooking the impact of those same words when used in the First and Fourth Amendments. The "right of the people" to assemble or to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures is not contested as an individual guarantee. Still they ignore consistency and claim that the right to "bear arms" relates only to military uses. This not only violates a consistent constitutional reading of "right of the people" but also ignores that the second amendment protects a right to "keep" arms. "When our ancestors forged a land "conceived in liberty", they did so with musket and rifle. When they reacted to attempts to dissolve their free institutions, and established their identity as a free nation, they did so as a nation of armed freemen. When they sought to record forever a guarantee of their rights, they devoted one full amendment out of ten to nothing but the protection of their right to keep and bear arms against governmental interference. Under my chairmanship the Subcommittee on the Constitution will concern itself with a proper recognition of, and respect for, this right most valued by free men.&lt;ref name="rkba1982"/&gt;}}

Likewise, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[District of Columbia v. Heller]]'' (2008), No. 07-290, that "[t]he Second Amendment protects an individual right to possess a firearm unconnected with service in a militia, and to use that arm for traditionally lawful purposes, such as self-defense within the home."&lt;ref&gt;''Heller'', Syllabus, item #1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Military service and civilian usage meanings ==
Some historians have argued that prior to and through the 18th century, the expression "bear arms" appeared exclusively in military contexts, as opposed to the use of firearms by civilians.&lt;ref name="UM194"&gt;Uviller, H.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In late-eighteenth-century parlance, ''bearing arms'' was a term of art with an obvious military and legal connotation. ... As a review of the Library of Congress's data base of congressional proceedings in the revolutionary and early national periods reveals, the thirty uses of 'bear arms' and 'bearing arms' in bills, statutes, and debates of the Continental, Confederation, and United States' Congresses between 1774 and 1821 invariably occur in a context exclusively focused on the army or the militia.&lt;ref name="UM194b"&gt;Uviller, H.

Duke University Press. {{ISBN|0-8223-3017-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

However, this conclusion is disputed and may be due to [[selection bias]], which arises from the use of a limited selection of government documents that overwhelmingly refer to matters of military service.&lt;ref name="Cramer-Olson001"&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cramer, Clayton E. |author2=Olson, Joseph |title=What Did "Bear Arms" Mean in the Second Amendment?|journal=Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Public Policy|volume=6|issue=2|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commenting on this previous research, other historians note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Searching more comprehensive collections of English language works published before 1820 shows that there are a number of uses that...have nothing to do with military service...[and] The common law was in agreement. Edward Christian's edition of Blackstone's Commentaries that appeared in 1790s described the rights of Englishmen (which every American colonist had been promised) in these terms 'everyone is at liberty to keep or carry a gun, if he does not use it for the [unlawful] destruction of game.' This right was separate from militia duties.&lt;ref name="Cramer-Olson001"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines the term ''to bear arms'' as: ''"to serve as a soldier, do military service, fight,"'' dating to about 1330.

[[Garry Wills]], author and history professor at [[Northwestern University]], has written of the origin of the term ''bear arms'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;By legal and other channels, the Latin "''[[wikt:arma#Latin|arma]] [[wikt:ferre#Latin|ferre]]''" entered deeply into the European language of war. Bearing arms is such a synonym for waging war that Shakespeare can call a just war "'' 'justborne arms''" and a civil war "''self-borne arms''." Even outside the special phrase "''bear arms''," much of the noun's use echoes Latin phrases: to be under arms (''[[wikt:sub#Latin|sub]] armis''), the call to arms (''[[wikt:ad#Latin|ad]] arma''), to follow arms (''arma [[wikt:sequi|sequi]]''), to take arms (''arma [[wikt:capere|capere]]''), to lay down arms (''arma pœnere''). "Arms" is a profession that one brother chooses the way another choose law or the church. An issue undergoes the arbitrament of arms." ... "One does not bear arms against a rabbit...".&lt;ref name="isbn0-684-87026-6"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wills, Garry|title=A Necessary Evil: A History of American Distrust of Government|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|year=2002|page=257|isbn=0-684-87026-6|oclc=|doi=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Garry Wills also cites Greek and Latin [[etymology]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;... "Bear Arms" refers to military service, which is why the plural is used (based on Greek 'hopla pherein' and Latin 'arma ferre')&amp;nbsp;– one does not bear arm, or bear an arm. The word means, etymologically, 'equipment' (from the root ar-* in verbs like 'ararisko', to fit out). It refers to the 'equipage' of war. Thus 'bear arms' can be used of naval as well as artillery warfare, since the "profession of arms" refers to all military callings.&lt;ref&gt;Wills, Garry (1999). ''A Necessary Evil'' pp. 256–257. New York, NY. Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Historically, the right to keep and bear arms, whether considered an individual or a collective or a militia right, did not originate fully formed in the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]] in 1791; rather, the [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Second Amendment]] was the codification of the six-centuries-old responsibility to keep and bear arms for king and country that was inherited from the English Colonists that settled North America, tracing its origin back to the [[Assize of Arms of 1181|Assize of Arms]] of 1181 that occurred during the reign of Henry II. Through being codified in the United States Constitution, the common law right was continued and guaranteed for the People, and statutory law enacted subsequently by Congress cannot extinguish the pre-existing common law right to keep and bear arms.&lt;ref name='Espohl_97'&gt;{{cite journal |author=Espohl,  Frank |title=The Right to Carry  Concealed Weapons  for Self Defense |journal=Southern Illinois University Law Journal |volume=22 |page=151 |year=1997 |quote=The right of self-preservation, including the right of self-defense, has been suggested to be within the protection of the Ninth Amendment.  Thus, although some courts have refused to hold that the Ninth Amendment protects  a right to possess firearms, laws which restrict the ability of law-abiding citizens to possess firearms for the purpose of self-defense could be said to violate the Ninth Amendment.  Another common interpretation of the Ninth Amendment is that it protects rights which were recognized at common law as being among the "fundamental rights of Englishmen."  The common law, as described in Blackstone's Commentaries, has been carried into American jurisprudence.  One such right protected at common law was the right to self-defense and the right to possess and carry weapons for defensive purposes.  Hobbes described the right to self-defense as a fundamental natural right of which persons can not justly be deprived by any law or covenant.  Blackstone listed self-defense and the right to carry weapons for self-defense as one of the fundamental rights of Englishmen.  Blackstone further described the right to self-defense as "the primary law of nature, so it is not, nor can it be in fact, taken away by the law of society |url=http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Espohl1.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130523070409/http://www.saf.org/LawReviews/Espohl1.htm |archivedate=2013-05-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Second Amendment to the United States Constitution]] refers to a pre-existing right to keep and bear arms:

{{quote|A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear Arms, shall not be infringed.&lt;ref name='BoR'&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/bill_of_rights_transcript.html |title=Bill of Rights Transcript Text |work=archives.gov |year=2011 |accessdate=15 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The right is often presented in the United States as being an unenumerated, pre-existing right, such as provided for by the [[Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution]],&lt;ref name='Espohl_97'/&gt; interpreted by some as providing for unenumerated rights, and therefore implicitly a right to keep and bear arms:

{{quote|The enumeration in the Constitution, of certain rights shall not be construed to deny or disparage others retained by the people.}}

Some have seen the Second Amendment as derivative of a common law right to keep and bear arms; Thomas B. McAffee &amp; Michael J. Quinlan, writing in the North Carolina Law Review said ''"...&amp;nbsp;Madison did not invent the right to keep and bear arms when he drafted the Second Amendment&amp;nbsp;– the right was pre-existing at both common law and in the early state constitutions."''&lt;ref name='nclr'&gt;{{cite journal|title=Bringing Forward The Right To Keep And Bear Arms: Do Text, History, Or Precedent Stand In The Way?|journal=North Carolina Law Review|date=March 1997|first=Thomas B.|last=McAffee|author2=Michael J.

Akhil Reed Amar similarly notes the basis of Common Law for the first ten amendments of the U.S. Constitution, "following John Randolph Tucker's famous oral argument in the 1887 Chicago anarchist case, Spies v. Illinois": 

&lt;blockquote&gt;Though originally the first ten Amendments were adopted as limitations on Federal power, yet insofar as they secure and recognize fundamental rights&amp;nbsp;– common law rights&amp;nbsp;– of the man, they make them privileges and immunities of the man as citizen of the United States...&lt;ref name='ylj1'&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Bill Of Rights And The Fourteenth Amendment|journal=Yale Law Journal|date=April 1992|first=Akhil|last=Amar|volume=|issue=|page=1193|id= |url=|format=}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Uviller and Merkel hold that the right to bear arms was not reserved for the state, but rather was an individual and personal right for arms only to the extent needed to maintain a well regulated militia to support the state. They also hold that a militia recognizable to the framers of the Constitution has ceased to exist in the United States resulting from deliberate Congressional legislation and also societal neglect; nonetheless, "Technically, all males aged seventeen to forty-five are members of the unorganized militia, but that status has no practical legal significance."&lt;ref name="isbn0-8223-3017-2b"&gt;{{cite book

A few academic writers published their opinions in several works:

&lt;blockquote&gt;From the text as well as a fair understanding of the contemporary ethic regarding arms and liberty, it seems to us overwhelmingly evident that the principal purpose of the Amendment was to secure a personal, individual entitlement to the possession and use of arms. We cannot, however, (as the individual rights contingent generally does) disregard entirely the first part of the text proclaiming a well regulated militia necessary to the security of a free state.&lt;ref name = "UM23"&gt;Uviller, H.

&lt;blockquote&gt;...we understand the Second Amendment as though it read: "Inasmuch as and so long as a well regulated Militia shall be necessary to the security of a free state and so long as privately held arms shall be essential to the maintenance thereof, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

== Early commentary in federal courts ==
{{See also|Firearm case law in the United States}}

In the century following the ratification of the [[United States Bill of Rights|Bill of Rights]], the intended meaning and application of the Second Amendment drew less interest than it does in modern times.&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_neither_model"&gt;Cornell, ''Gun Control'', p. 6. Neither of the two modern theories that have defined public debate over the right to bear arms is faithful to the original understanding of this provision of the Bill of Rights.&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of regulation was done by states, and the first case law on weapons regulation dealt with state interpretations of the Second Amendment. A notable exception to this general rule was ''Houston v. Moore'', {{ussc|18|1|1820}}, where the Supreme Court mentioned the Second Amendment in an aside.&lt;ref&gt;Justice Story "misidentified" it as the "5th Amendment. Several public officials, including [[James Madison]] and Supreme Court Justice Joseph Story, retained the confusing practice of referring to each of the ten amendments in the Bill of Rights by the enumeration found in the first draft; the fifth article is the Second Amendment.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Dred Scott v. Sandford''===

In the Nineteenth century considerable attention in public discourse and the courts was directed to the issue of arming of slaves (prior to the Civil War), and later to the right of slaves to belong to militia and the arming of these individuals. Most famously this is seen in the court arguments of the 1857 court case ''[[Dred Scott v. Sandford]]'', whether the slave [[Dred Scott]] could be a citizen with rights, including the right to bear arms. This debate about the rights of slaves and former slaves often included the usage of the term 'bear arms' with the meaning of individuals having or not having the right to possess firearms.

In the [[Dred Scott v. Sandford|''Dred Scott'' decision]], the [[Majority opinion|opinion of the court]] stated that if [[African American]]s were considered [[Citizenship in the United States|U.S. citizens]], "It would give to persons of the negro race, who were recognized as citizens in any one State of the Union, the right...to keep and carry arms wherever they went."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caselaw.lp.findlaw.com/scripts/getcase.pl?court=US&amp;vol=60&amp;invol=393|title=FindLaw &amp;#124; Cases and Codes|work=Caselaw.lp.findlaw.com|accessdate=2013-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;60 U.S. 393, 417 (1857).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early commentary in state courts ==
The Second Amendment of the United States Constitution is a [[Federal government of the United States|federal]] provision.  In 2010, this "fundamental" and "individual" right was "fully incorporated" with the 14th Amendment per the SCOTUS ruling made in ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'', which upheld the prior opinion made in ''District of Columbia v. Heller''. Each of the fifty states also has its own state constitution. Forty-four states have chosen to explicitly embody a right to bear arms into their state constitutions.&lt;ref name='staterkba'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.law.ucla.edu/volokh/beararms/statecon.htm|title=State Constitutional Right to Keep and Bear Arms Provisions|accessdate=2008-05-10|last=Volokh|first=Eugene|year=2006|publisher=UCLA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of the state constitutions, state laws, and state courts addresses the state-based right to bear arms distinctly within its respective jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;Cooley, Thomas M. &amp; Angell, Alexis C.: ''A Treatise on the Constitutional Limitations which Rest Upon the Legislative Power of the States of the American Union'', p. 427. Boston: Little, Brown &amp; Company. 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree and the nature of the protection, prohibition, and regulation at the state level varies from state to state. The District of Columbia, not being a state, falls within the federal jurisdiction.

Approximately&lt;!-- way too many "approximately"s for two paragraphs --&gt; thirty-one states have explicitly chosen to include the right to arms for "individual right", "defense of self", "defense of home" or similarly worded reasons. Approximately thirteen states, as with the U.S. Constitution, did not choose to explicitly include "individual", "self" or "home" wording associated with a right to bear arms for their specific states.

Approximately twenty-eight states have explicitly chosen to include the right to bear arms for "security of a free state", "defense of state", "common defense" or similarly worded reasons, as with the U.S. Constitution. Approximately sixteen states did not choose to include explicitly "free state", "defense of state" or "common defense" wording for their specific state. Whether the inclusion of these kinds of wording in state constitutions has relevance to the issue of whether implicit "individual" rights exist, or whether such rights (if any) are implicitly protected by the states' constitutions or by the U.S. Constitution's Second Amendment, remains a matter of dispute. However, since the SCOTUS has "fully incorporated" the 2nd and 14th Amendments in their 2010 opinion and order in ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'', the right to keep and bear arms is "fully applicable" to the states and limits the states on any and all regulations and restrictions they choose to take, and federal Constitutional rights take precedence over state, local and other laws that regulate to "Right of Lawful Citizens to keep and bear Arms for self-defense, a 'central component' of the 2nd Amendment" (see ''McDonald v. City of Chicago'' (SC  2010)).&lt;!-- every one of those approximatelys is quanitifiable and should be checked and given its correct value --&gt;

Regarding the state interpretations of these state and the federal constitutional rights to bear arms, state courts have addressed the meaning of these specific rights in considerable detail. Two different models have emerged from state [[jurisprudence]]: an individual right (defense of self or home) and a collective (defense of the state) right.  It should be noted, however, that the states cannot lessen or restrict any Bill of Rights guarantee that has been "fully incorporated" (American jurisprudence) and that the right that is "fully incorporated" also applies to the respective State Constitutions; again, the states can only "add to" these rights but can never "diminish" these rights by state and local laws.

The Kentucky High Court stated in ''Bliss'', "But it should not be forgotten, that it is not only a part of the right that is secured by the constitution; it is the right entire and complete, as it existed at the adoption of the constitution; and if any portion of that right be impaired, immaterial how small the part may be, and immaterial the order of time at which it be done, it is equally forbidden by the constitution."&lt;ref name="bliss v commonwealth"/&gt; The "constitution" mentioned in this quote refers to Kentucky's Constitution.&lt;ref name="rkba1982"&gt;Right to Keep and Bear Arms, U.S. Senate. 2001 Paladin Press. {{ISBN|1-58160-254-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The case prompted outrage in the Kentucky House, all the while recognizing that Section 23 of the Second Constitution of Kentucky (1799) did guarantee individuals the right to bear arms.  The ''Bliss'' ruling, to the extent that it dealt with concealed weapons, was overturned by constitutional amendment with Section 26 in Kentucky's Third Constitution (1850) banning the future carrying of concealed weapons, while still asserting that the bearing of arms in defense of themselves and the state was an individual and collective right in the Commonwealth of Kentucky. This recognition has remained to the present day in the Commonwealth of Kentucky's Fourth Constitution, enacted in 1891, in Section 1, Article 7, that guarantees "The right to bear arms in defense of themselves and of the State, subject to the power of the General Assembly to enact laws to prevent persons from carrying concealed weapons." As noted in the Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in the 1980s, vol. 10, no. 1, 1982, p.&amp;nbsp;155, "The first state court decision resulting from the "right to bear arms" issue was ''Bliss v. Commonwealth''. The court held that "the right of citizens to bear arms in defense of themselves and the State must be preserved entire, ..." "This holding was unique because it stated that the right to bear arms is absolute and unqualified."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pierce|first=Darell R.|title=Second Amendment Survey|journal=Northern Kentucky Law Review Second Amendment Symposium: Rights in Conflict in 1980s|volume=10|issue=1|year=1982|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Two states, [[Alaska]] and [[Vermont]], do not require a permit or license for carrying a concealed weapon to this day, following Kentucky's original position.&lt;/ref&gt;

The importance of ''Bliss'' is also seen from the defense subsequently given against a murder charge in Kentucky against Mattews Ward, who in 1852 pulled out a concealed pistol and fatally wounded his brother's teacher over an accusation regarding eating chestnuts in class. Ward's defense team consisted of eighteen lawyers, including U.S. Senator [[John J. Crittenden|John Crittenden]], former Governor of Kentucky, and former [[United States Attorney General]]. The defense successfully defended Ward in 1854 through an assertion that "a man has a right to carry arms; I am aware of nothing in the laws of God or man, prohibiting it. The Constitution of Kentucky and our Bill of Rights guarantee it. The Legislature once passed an act forbidding it, but it was decided unconstitutional, and overruled by our highest tribunal, the Court of Appeals." As noted by Cornell, "Ward's lawyers took advantage of the doctrine advanced in ''Bliss'' and wrapped their client's action under the banner of a constitutional right to bear arms. Ward was acquitted."&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_AWRM_Ward"&gt;{{cite book

=== Aymette ===

In ''Aymette v. State'', 21 Tenn. 154, 156 (1840), the Tennessee Supreme Court construed the guarantee in Tennessee's 1834 Constitution that 'the free white men of this State have a right to Keep and bear arms for their common defence.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdm15138.contentdm.oclc.org/cdm/compoundobject/collection/tfd/id/495/rec/2 |title=Tennessee Constitution, 1834 |accessdate=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining that the provision was adopted with the same goals as the Federal Constitution's Second Amendment, the court wrote: "The words 'bear arms' … have reference to their military use, and were not employed to mean wearing them about the person as part of the dress.  As the object for which the right to keep and bear arms is secured, is of general and public nature, to be exercised by the people in a body, for their common defense, so the arms, the right to keep which is secured, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and that constitute the ordinary military equipment."
* 1. The act of 1837-8, ch. 137, sec. 2, which prohibits any person from wearing any [[Bowie knife]], or [[Arkansas toothpick]], or other knife or weapon in form, shape or size resembling a Bowie knife or Arkansas toothpick under his clothes, or concealed about his person, does not conflict with the 26th section of the first article of the bill of rights, securing to the free white citizens the right to keep and bear arms for their common defense.
* 2. The arms, the right to keep and bear which is secured by the constitution, are such as are usually employed in civilized warfare, and constitute the ordinary military equipment; the legislature have the power to prohibit the keeping or wearing weapons dangerous to the peace and safety of the citizens, and which are not usual in civilized warfare.
* 3. The right to keep and bear arms for the common defense, is a great political right. It respects the citizens on the one hand, and the rulers on the other; and although this right must be inviolably preserved, it does not follow that the legislature is prohibited from passing laws regulating the manner in which these arms may be employed.

The [[Supreme Court of Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia Supreme Court]] ruled in ''[[Nunn v. Georgia]]'' (Nunn v. State, 1 Ga.

&lt;blockquote&gt;The right of the whole people, old and young, men, women and boys, and not militia only, to keep and bear ''arms'' of every description, and not ''such'' merely as are used by the ''militia'', shall not be ''infringed'', curtailed, or broken in upon, in the smallest degree; and all this for the important end to be attained: the rearing up and qualifying a well-regulated militia, so vitally necessary to the security of a free State. Our opinion is, that any law, State or Federal, is repugnant to the Constitution, and void, which contravenes this ''right'', originally belonging to our forefathers, trampled under foot by Charles I. and his two wicked sons and successors, re-established by the revolution of 1688, conveyed to this land of liberty by the colonists, and finally incorporated conspicuously in our own Magna Charta!&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotusblog.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/06/07-2901.pdf |title=District of Columbia v.

=== Buzzard ===

In ''State v. Buzzard'' (1842, Ark), the Arkansas high court adopted a militia-based, political interpretation, reading of the right to bear arms under state law, and upheld the 21st section of the second article of the Arkansas Constitution that declared, "that the free white men of this State shall have a right to keep and bear arms for their common defense",&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"&gt;{{Cite court|litigants=State v. Buzzard|vol=4|reporter=Ark. (2 Pike)|opinion=18|year=1842|url=http://www.guncite.com/court/state/4ar18.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; while rejecting a challenge to a statute prohibiting the carrying of concealed weapons. Buzzard had carried a concealed weapon and stood "indicted by virtue of the authority of the 13th section of an act of the Legislature prohibiting any person wearing a [[pistol]], [[dirk]], large knife or sword-cane ''concealed as a weapon'', unless upon a journey, under the penalties of fine and imprisonment." Justice Lacy, in a dissenting opinion in ''Buzzard'', summarizing the majority viewpoint to which he disagreed, declared: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;That the words "a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free State", and the words "common defense" clearly show the true intent and meaning of these Constitutions [i.e., Ark. and U.S.] and prove that it is a political and not an individual right, and, of course, that the State, in her legislative capacity, has the right to regulate and control it: This being the case, then the people, neither individually nor collectively, have the right to keep and bear arms."&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Joel Prentiss Bishop]]'s influential ''Commentaries on the Law of Statutory Crimes'' (1873) took Buzzard's militia-based interpretation, a view that Bishop characterized as the "Arkansas doctrine", as the orthodox view of the right to bear arms in American law.&lt;ref name="state v buzzard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Saul_Cornell_AWRM_Bishop"&gt;{{cite book

|quote=... the Kansas Supreme Court had used a similar formulation of the right to bear arms a decade earlier, describing this right as one that "refers to the people as a collective body.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Kansas high court declared: "That the provision in question applies only to the right to bear arms as a member of the state militia, or some other military organization provided for by law, is also apparent from the second amendment to the federal Constitution, which says: 'A well regulated militia, being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed.'"

== Modern commentary ==

=== Interpretive Models ===
{{Further|Second Amendment to the United States Constitution|Ninth Amendment to the United States Constitution}}
Three models of interpreting the right to bear arms in the United States commonly exist. These three models are founded on differing interpretations of the Second Amendment, ''"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State, the right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed."''

The first model, the individual-rights model, holds that a right of individuals is to own and possess firearms, much as the First Amendment protects a right of individuals to engage in free speech.&lt;ref name="dorf"/&gt; This view was confirmed by the Supreme Court in ''District of Columbia v. Heller'' (2008) than had previous interpretations by the Court. Prior to the Supreme Court's ruling in ''Heller'' there was a split among the federal courts, with nine of the federal circuit courts of appeal supporting a modified collective rights view, two of the federal circuits supporting an individual rights view, and one federal circuit court having not addressed the question.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The second two models focus on the preamble, or "purpose" clause, of the Amendment&amp;nbsp;– the words ''"A well regulated Militia, being necessary to the security of a free State."'' The second model, the collective model, holds that the right to bear arms belongs to the people collectively rather than to individuals, under the belief that the right's only purpose is to enable states to maintain a militia.

The third model, the modified collective model, holds that the right to keep and bear arms exists only for individuals actively serving in the militia, and then only pursuant to such regulations as may be prescribed.&lt;ref name="dorf"&gt;{{cite web

=== Federal case commentary ===
Supreme Court justice [[Antonin Scalia]] in 2008 wrote that the right to bear arms is not unlimited and is subject to reasonable prohibitions and regulations and subsequently federal court rulings have upheld existing gun prohibitions and regulations.&lt;ref name="urlThe Volokh Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;–  Yet Another Early Post-''Heller'' Second Amendment Case:&lt;blockquote&gt;&gt;{{cite web |url=http://volokh.com/posts/1215491766.shtml |title=The Volokh Conspiracy&amp;nbsp;– Yet Another Early Post-''Heller'' Second Amendment Case: |work= |accessdate=2009-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nadine Strossen]], former president of the [[American Civil Liberties Union]], has stated that the individual rights model must yield to reasonable regulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

No right is absolute; the government is always allowed to restrict the right if it can satisfy Constitutional [[strict scrutiny]] and show the restriction is narrowly tailored to promote a goal of compelling importance."&lt;ref&gt;[[n:ACLU President Strossen on religion, drugs, guns and impeaching George Bush#Gun rights|Interview with Nadine Strossen]], David Shankbone, ''[[Wikinews]]'', October 30, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2001, the [[United States Court of Appeals]] for the [[Fifth Circuit]] stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;there are numerous instances of the phrase 'bear arms' being used to describe a civilian's carrying of arms. Early constitutional provisions or declarations of rights in at least some ten different states speak of the right of the 'people' [or 'citizen' or 'citizens'] "to bear arms in defense of themselves [or 'himself'] and the state,' or equivalent words, thus indisputably reflecting that under common usage 'bear arms' was in no sense restricted to bearing arms in military service."&lt;ref name="Emerson000"&gt;United States v. Emerson, 270 F.3d 203 (5th Cir. 2001).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The cited excerpt from the ''Emerson'' decision reflects some of the court's lengthy analysis of Second Amendment jurisprudence (Spitzer 2003)(Reynolds 2002). This analysis garnered considerable attention and scrutiny by legal experts. Shortly after the decision, Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]] directed the adoption of the Emerson court's view as the policy of the Justice Department in a memo to all ninety-three United States Attorneys in November 2001. In contrast, legal critics of the "individualist view" repudiated the ''Emerson'' analysis on various grounds. Judge Robert M. Parker, while concurring in the ''Emerson'' result, labeled the majority's analysis as ''obiter dicta'', irrelevant to
the outcome of the case (see ''Emerson'', Spitzer 2003). Moreover, the thoroughness of the ''Emerson'' analysis was criticized because the court's rendered opinion relied substantially on interpretations submitted in a "brief presented by one party" (Spitzer 2003).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====''United States v. Miller''====
{{Main|United States v. Miller}}

In ''United States v. Miller'', {{ussc|307|174|1939}}, the Supreme Court rejected a Second Amendment challenge to the [[National Firearms Act]] prohibiting the interstate transportation of unregistered [[Any Other Weapon|Title II weapons]]:

{{quote|Jack Miller and Frank Layton "did unlawfully...transport in interstate commerce from...Claremore...Oklahoma to...Siloam Springs...Arkansas a certain firearm...a double barrel...shotgun having a barrel less than 18 inches in length...at the time of so transporting said firearm in interstate commerce...not having registered said firearm as required by Section 1132d of Title 26, United States Code, ...and not having in their possession a stamp-affixed written order...as provided by Section 1132C...&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 175.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In a unanimous opinion authored by [[James Clark McReynolds|Justice McReynolds]], the Supreme Court stated "the objection that the Act usurps police power reserved to the States is plainly untenable."&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; As the Court explained:

{{quote|In the absence of any evidence tending to show that possession or use of a 'shotgun having a barrel of less than eighteen inches in length' at this time has some reasonable relationship to any preservation or efficiency of a well regulated militia, we cannot say that the Second Amendment guarantees the right to keep and bear such an instrument. Certainly it is not within judicial notice that this weapon is any part of the ordinary military equipment or that its use could contribute to the common defense.&lt;ref&gt;''Miller'', at 178.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gun rights advocates claim that the Court in ''Miller'' ruled that the Second Amendment protected the right to keep arms that are part of "ordinary military equipment."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secondamendment.net/2amd4.html|title=The misconstruction of United States v.

Most modern scholars recognize this fact."&lt;ref&gt;McClurg, p. 139. "But when all is said and done, the only certainty about ''Miller'' is that it failed to give either side a clear-cut victory. Most modern scholars recognize this fact. For example, Professor Eugene Volokh describes Miller as 'deliciously and usefully ambiguous' in an article about using the Second Amendment as a teaching tool in constitutional law. That is probably the most accurate statement that can be made about the case."&lt;/ref&gt;

A list of poems by '''[[Robert E. Howard]]''' (1906–1936), an American writer and poet in early 20th-century Texas. His love of poetry came from being read to by his mother at a young age. However, his attempts to make a living by poetry were unsuccessful and he is today most remembered for his short stories and fiction. Nevertheless, Howard wrote hundreds of poems; many were published within his lifetime and the others published after his 1936 suicide.

The lack of information in a column does not necessarily mean that the information does not exist, only that verifiable information is not currently available. For example, the lack of publication information does not necessarily mean that a poem has not been published to date, nor does the lack of a definite note about the public domain indicate that a poem is still under copyright.

This table may be sorted by different columns by clicking on the icon in the appropriate column.  Clicking the icon again will alternate between ascending and descending order.

;Additional notes:

'''Title/Alternative title:''' Some poems are known by multiple titles.  Alternative titles are shown in the column of the same name. Every effort has been made to list full information at all entries for each title, to save the user time in scrolling. Occasionally, alternative titles appear consecutively, in which case the second entry will follow without additional information, shown in a darker gray on the table.  In other cases, some poems were not titled by Howard or the original title has not survived. Some poems have been given tentative titles after Howard's death; this is indicated in the Notes column. Where multiple titles exist, they have been listed alphabetically by their various designations following the word "Untitled."  Some pieces of poetry were used by Howard as [[Epigraph (literature)|epigraphs]] within his stories. {{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|loc=}} listed these poems under the title of the short story rather than the title of the poem itself, so the poems are listed under those titles as well.  With epigraphs, the first publication information given in this table is that of the poem's first printing separated from the story.

'''Lines:''' The number of lines in the poem.

'''Source text:''' Links given in the Source Text column are to copies of the poem in online libraries (where available). For ease of browsing the table, these links are preceded by a small icon. For example, [[Image:Wikisource-logo.svg|15px]] for poems on [[Wikisource]].

'''References:''' Bibliographic references are given in the final column of each row.  The exception to this is the Notes column; as notes may come from diverse sources, or from a separate part of one of the main sources, each individual note is followed by its own reference.

* {{note|conflict|M}} With these poems, two or more sources give different publications and dates of the first appearance. e.g. "Conflict: {{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=186}}, ''The Howard Collector'', 1962/{{Harvtxt|Herman|2006|p=204}}, ''The Junto'', 1929" indicates that {{Harvtxt|Lord|1976|p=186}} states first publication as ''The Howard Collector'' (published in 1962), while {{Harvtxt|Herman|2006|p=204}} states first publication as ''The Junto'' (published in 1929).

{{Japanese name|Hamada}}
[[File:Shōji Hamada.png|thumb|right|200px|Hamada at the University of Michigan, 1967 or 1968]]
[[File:Thrown, Combed tea bowl by Shoji Hamada (YORYM-2004.1.1957).JPG|thumb|Thrown, Combed tea bowl by Shoji Hamada]]
{{Nihongo|'''Shōji Hamada'''|濱田 庄司|Hamada Shōji|December 9, 1894 – January 5, 1978}} was a Japanese potter. He was a significant influence on studio pottery of the twentieth century, and a major figure of the ''[[mingei]]'' folk-art movement, establishing the town of [[Mashiko, Tochigi|Mashiko]] as a world-renowned pottery centre.{{citation needed|date=November 2010}} In 1955 he was designated a "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasure]]".

== Biography ==
Hamada was born in [[Kawasaki, Kanagawa|Kawasaki]], Japan, in 1894 named {{nihongo|Shoji|象ニ}}.

After finishing elitist [[Hibiya High School]], he studied [[ceramic]]s at [[Tokyo Institute of Technology]], then known as Tokyo Industrial College&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; with [[Kawai Kanjirō]] under [[Itaya Hazan]]. As the sole students in the school interested in becoming artist-potters, Hamada and the slightly elder Kawai were soon friends, touring the city in search of inspiration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Leach, 1990:93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eocene"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eocene-arts.com/ceramics/kawai.html|title=Kawai Kanjiro|publisher=Eocene Arts|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; They worked together in Kyoto at the former body of the Kyoto Municipal Institute of Industrial Technology and Culture where they experimented on glazes using various minerals. They were acquainted by [[Yanagi Sōetsu]] and [[Tomimoto Kenkichi]] while visiting potteries and exhibitions.

Hamada was deeply impressed by a Tokyo exhibition of ceramic art by [[Bernard Leach]], who was then staying with [[Yanagi Sōetsu]], and wrote to Leach seeking an introduction.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The two found much in common and became good friends, so much so that Hamada asked and was granted permission to accompany Leach to [[England]] in 1920 when the latter decided to return and establish a pottery there.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Pottery in Mashiko ==
Having spent three years in [[St Ives, Cornwall|St Ives]] with Bernard Leach, he returned to Japan in 1923 and traveled to potteries and stayed at Tsuboya in [[Okinawa Prefecture]] for weeks, then eventually established his workshop in [[Mashiko]], about 100&amp;nbsp;km north-east of Tokyo. Here, he built his own pottery and committed himself to using only locally sourced materials, not only in the clay he used, but also the glazes he created and  the brushes he manufactured himself from dog hair and bamboo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Riddick|first1=Sarah|editor-first=Richard|editor-last=Green|title=Pioneer Studio Pottery: The Milner-White Collection|date=1990|publisher=Lund Humphries Publishers Ltd|isbn=0853315906|oclc=214380411}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955 the Japanese government designated him "[[Living National Treasure (Japan)|Living National Treasure]]", the first time for someone from the field of crafts. The previous year on 29 May 1954, the [[Cultural Property (Japan)#1954 amendment|Cultural Property Protection Act]] had been amended, and a new Preservers of Important Intangible Cultural Properties (Jūyō Mukei Bunkazai Hojisha) designation was passed the bill in November for its criteria and approval details.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nihonkogeikai.or.jp/old/KOGEITEN/ENKAKU/1954.html|title=Nihon dento kogeiten enkaku—Showa 29-nen (1954)|trans-title= History of traditional Japanese craft exhibition: 1954 (Showa 29)|language=ja|publisher=[[Japan Kōgei Association]]| access-date= 2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Yanagi Muneyoshi, Hamada was enthusiastic about folk art movement in Japan. When Yanagi died in 1961, he succeeded as the second director of the [[Japanese Folk Crafts Museum]], and in 1977, he opened his own museum at his home, Mashiko Sankōkan (present Shoji Hamada Memorial Mashiko Sankokan Museum),&lt;ref name=shiryokan&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashiko-sankokan.net/index.html|title=Hamada Shoji Kinen Mashiko Sankokan| trans-title=Shoji Hamada Memorial Mashiko Sankokan Museum|language=ja|access-date= 2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; and exhibited his collection of folk crafts from Japan and abroad.

Hamada Shoji was very supportive of young artists who moved to Mashiko such as his student [[Tatsuzō Shimaoka|Shimaoka Tatsuzō]], and Kamoda Shōji, and was also important in establishing Mashiko as a destination for day tourism. He provided housing and hosted workplace for visiting potters from abroad as well.

Hamada died in Mashiko on January 5, 1978.

== Preserving local architecture ==
[[File:Shoji Hamada Memorial Mashiko Sankokan Museum.JPG|thumb|left|Shōji Hamada Memorial Mashiko Sankokan Museum]]
Since he moved to Mashiko, Hamada bought, relocated, and refurbished traditional farm houses, stone warehouses, and nagaya-mon gatehouses of [[Edo period]] unique to southern [[Tochigi Prefecture]] on his property. The first was his residence in 1930,&lt;ref name=shiryokan/&gt; followed by others he used as workshops and for entertaining guests and apprentices, with the last one used since 1942 as his workshop. In 1989 his residence was donated to and rebuilt at [[Mashiko Museum of Ceramic Art]], or Ceramic Art Messe Mashiko,&lt;ref name=shiryokan/&gt; after the house was designated a cultural property of Mashiko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mashiko-museum.jp/en/hamada/index.html|title=Shoji Hamada’s House|publisher=Mashiko Museum of Ceramic Art|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;The museum is still open today and visitors can view Hamada's studio, living quarters, and various craft collections.&lt;ref name="shiryokan" /&gt;

== Influence ==
Throughout a lifetime dedicated to making pottery he achieved international recognition and his works have been collected by museums across the world. Hamada influence was felt not only in his native Japan, particularly in Mashiko, but also in the West. In the United Kingdom and the US his style and philosophy became well known amongst [[studio potters]], and he was revered as the archetypal "Oriental" potter.

Today Hamada's works attain high prices at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://artist.christies.com/Hamada-Shoji--44407.aspx|title=Hamada Shoji: past results | publisher=[[Christie’s]]|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.arcadja.com/auctions/en/hamada_shoji/artist/113403/| title= Shoji Hamada, prices and estimates|access-date=2017-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, examples of his work can be seen at the [[York Art Gallery]].

'''''The Sarah Silverman Program''''' is an American television [[sitcom]], which ran from February 1, 2007 to April 15, 2010 on [[Comedy Central]]&lt;ref name="ComedyCentral.com February 1"&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.comedycentral.com/press/press_releases/2007/11107_sarahsilvermanpro_premiere.jhtml |title=See the World Through Sarah's Eyes |publisher=Comedy Central| accessdate=2008-04-02 |date=2007-01-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt; starring comedian and actress [[Sarah Silverman]], who created the series with [[Dan Harmon]] and [[Rob Schrab]].

''The Sarah Silverman Program'' faced cancellation in 2009 when Comedy Central and the producers were unable to reach an agreement for the show's per-episode budget. LGBT-interest cable channel [[Logo TV|Logo]] stepped in to co-produce the third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Andreeva |first=Nellie |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2009/03/03/us-silverman-idUSTRE5210CC20090303 |title=Gay TV channel saving "Sarah Silverman" |publisher=Reuters.com |date=2009-03-03 |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Premise==
Episodes revolve around the adventures of Sarah and her friends in [[Valley Village]], [[California]], a district in the [[San Fernando Valley]] portion of [[Los Angeles]] that is portrayed as an autonomous city within the show. Silverman plays a fictionalized version of herself, an unemployed woman who leads an irresponsible life. Her most notable trait is her undiluted, childlike self-absorption, which commonly leads to awkward comedic situations in which she insults friends, family, and total strangers. The show tackled issues such as [[abortion]], [[racism]], and [[same-sex marriage]]; it was canceled after three seasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tvseriesfinale.com/tv-show/sarah-silverman-program-canceled-14887/ |title=Sarah Silverman Program canceled, no season four |publisher=TV Series Finale |date=2010-05-12 |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show was filmed at [[Hollywood Center Studios]], [[Hollywood]], [[California]].

==Characters==
* '''Sarah Jane Anastasia Silverman''', a.k.a. '''Sarah St. Clair''' ([[Sarah Silverman]]) – The main character who is extremely childish and immature and exhibits a lack of diplomacy or sensitivity to others. She often acts impulsively, oblivious to anyone or anything else. Sarah does not have a job as she hates and refuses to work and attacks anyone who tells her to get a job, so her sister Laura pays her rent. Sarah is very close to Laura, and she has a dog named Doug, whom she found in the trash. Her favorite TV show is ''Cookie Party!'', a (fictional) ''[[Iron Chef]]''-like [[game show]] in which contestants have a cookie bakeoff, voted on by the viewers and hosted by drag-queen "Mini Coffee" and his puppet sidekick Ookie. Sarah enjoys watching the show with Laura as a weekly ritual, and they even went on the show as contestants, although it wasn't without pitfalls for them or their mother's skeleton. &lt;ref&gt;episode Doodie&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah despises her sister's boyfriend (later husband) Jay, a policeman, and frequently says so. She retaliates by attempting to undermine their relationship, sometimes in a jealous manner. Sarah attended Valley Village High School with Brian, Steve, and Laura. Sarah and Laura's parents, Max and Rose Silverman, died when they were young (Rose's tombstone says she died in 1986 when Sarah was 10; Max later turns up alive and stalking [[Larry Bird]] at a book-signing). Sarah's jobless, careless-yet-comfortable lifestyle is usually a major part of the show's plot, along with constant episodes of humiliation at Laura's expense, despite Sarah's total dependence on her hard-working sister. Her young version in memories is played by [[Laura Marano]]
* '''Laura Jane Silverman III''' ([[Laura Silverman]]) – Sarah's younger sister (in real life, her older sister), is a [[registered nurse]]. Their parents died when they were young, and Sarah is Laura's only family. Laura is very susceptible to guilt, making Sarah's manipulation of her remarkably easy. She is more responsible than Sarah and devotes most of her life to taking care of her. In the first episode, she tells Jay that she can eat 30 hard-boiled eggs in one sitting. She used to have a large amount of pubic hair (like her mother) until she shaves it all off in the episode "Patriot Tact" after her mother comes to her in a vision to tell her it is all right to shave. She falls in love with Jay in the first episode. She attended Valley Village High School with Brian, Steve, and Sarah.
* '''Brian Damien Spukowski''' ([[Brian Posehn]]) – Sarah's gay neighbor and friend, who is dating Steve, is an enthusiastic [[Heavy metal subculture|metalhead]] but the only song on his five-year-old [[iPod]] is the [[Spin Doctors]]' "[[Two Princes]]". Brian claims it's a palate-cleanser to prevent him from going psycho from listening to only metal. In the first episode, he claims to be [[bisexual]], which causes some strain with Steve. A near-death experience of Sarah crashing their car gives Brian perspective and he tells Steve that he remains gay. Brian takes [[karate]] lessons, but only uses his skills when he thinks it's necessary (and not to defend Steve, in the episode "Humanitarian of the Year"). He and Steve occasionally double-date with Laura and Jay, which they secretly dread. Brian attended Valley Village High School with Sarah, Steve, and Laura. He and Steve marry in the episode "Nightmayor."
* '''Steven Ned Myron III''' ([[Steve Agee]]) – Sarah's gay neighbor and friend, who is dating Brian. He makes wry comments on his partner's antics, and even prompts them (such as recommending that he drink [[Tab (soft drink)|Tab]]). In the first episode, the sight of women in lingerie made him physically ill after Brian passed his face on all the women in the catalogue. Steve enjoys playing ''[[Halo 2]]'' online. He is often assaulted by strangers who claim that his face just makes them want to punch him. Steve is also known for having noxious, unbearable [[flatulence]], which is noted in several episodes, particularly "Not Without My Daughter", in which he sets off a SWAT team evacuation and is interrogated by the [[NSA]] after telling Brian over the phone that he has "left a bomb" in Jay's police car. Despite knowing karate, Brian usually lacks the will to stop people from punching Steve. Although Sarah and Laura have two friends that are named Steve, they nicknamed Steve "Straight Steve" to be ironic because he is gay. His family no longer speaks to him because of his homosexuality and relationship with Brian. He attended Valley Village High School with Sarah, Brian, and Laura. In the episode "Nightmayor", he and Brian get married.
* '''Officer Jay McPherson''' ([[Jay Johnston]]) – A police officer who is dating Sarah's sister Laura. Jay met Laura when he arrested Sarah for driving her car into a playground sandbox after drinking too much [[Cough medicine|cough syrup]] and passing out. Jay is also a closet performer in the genre of sentimental "gentle comedy" character sketches. Jay dislikes Sarah and calls her "the cuckoo clown" (in the episode "Positively Negative"), but he is so devoted to Laura that he will go out of his way to help Sarah, even when she vows to kill him. Jay won a "Humanitarian of the Year" award for reading to blind people. Growing up, he never celebrated his birthday because his mother told him that every day was his birthday (to cover up her beer and cake addiction, which ended up killing her on Jay's actual birthday). Jay has a brown [[moustache]], which Sarah frequently insults or at least mentions in episode introductions. In "Muffin' Man", Jay mentions that his partner, Officer Paul Tompkins, has been suspended for opening fire on a Hispanic youth who pulled a pellet gun on him, and that he had received a temporary new partner named Tig ([[Tig Notaro]]) who is a lesbian. Jay was also very attached to his pet turtle, Toot, whom Sarah shot to death in the episode "Pee." In season two it was revealed that he had an uncle who was killed by an electric eel. He proposed to Laura on the second-season finale. 
* '''Doug''' – Doug is Sarah's "[[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]]-[[pug]] mix",&lt;ref name="The New Yorker October 24"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.newyorker.com/fact/content/articles/051024fa_fact |title=Quiet Depravity |work=[[The New Yorker]] |first=Dana |last=Goodyear |date=2005-10-24 |accessdate=2005-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pet dog that she found in the trash. Most episodes conclude with Sarah telling Doug her overall reaction to the episode's events, even if he's sleeping. He is played by Sarah Silverman's real-life pet dog, Duck.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sarahsilvermanonline.com/duck/ |title=Duck |publisher=Sarah Silverman Online |date= |accessdate=2011-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recurring characters===
* '''Heather Silverman''' ([[Laura Marano]]) - A greedy young orphan Sarah misrepresents as her daughter to use her to win the Little Miss Rainbow pageant in "Not Without My Daughter."  
* '''Armen''' ([[Armen Weitzman]]) – A softspoken clerk at the Fan-Tasti-Mart whom Brian and Steve talk to during their various fights. He became Sarah's friend in "Making New Friends".
* '''Eddie''' ([[Eddie Pepitone]]) – The cook at Romanski's, the restaurant Sarah and her friends frequent.
* '''God''' ([[Tucker Smallwood]]) – He has a one-night stand with Sarah in "Batteries", then rekindles their relationship in "Ah, Men".
* '''Mini Coffee''' ([[Rob Schrab]]) – "Valley Village's own Southern Belle," the host of ''Cookie Party''. 
* '''Murray''' ([[Murray Gershenz]]) – An elderly resident of Valley Village. He joins Sarah's new circle of friends in "Making New Friends" and in the final episode "Wowschwitz" is revealed as a former Nazi prison guard.
* '''The Mustangs''' ([[Chris Romano]] and [[Kurt Scholler]]) – A troublesome duo who wear matching red vests emblazoned with the letter "M".
* '''Paul''' ([[Paul F. Tompkins]]) – Jay's former police partner.
* '''Max Silverman''' ([[Mark Cohen (comedian)|Mark Cohen]]) – Sarah and Laura's father. He was originally thought to be dead, but in "I Thought My Dad Was Dead, But It Turns Out He's Not" Sarah finds out that he is alive after encountering him in a bookstore. Sarah introduces him to Laura on a television talk show where Laura is visibly angry and shocked. Max and Sarah go on tour as [[Lisa Loeb]] cover singers called the "Loeb Trotters". At the end of that episode Max reportedly dies 'again' in a bus explosion. In the third-season episode "Smellin' of Troy" it's revealed that he didn't die in the bus crash, he only fell into a coma, which Laura kept from Sarah. He awakens just long enough to kill Sarah's imaginary friend (Andy Samberg).
* '''Tig''' ([[Tig Notaro]]) – Jay's police partner. In "Muffin Man", Sarah became so attracted to her that she decides to become homosexual.

'''''The Sirius Mystery''''' is a non-fiction book by [[Robert K. G. Temple]] first published by [[St. Martin's Press]] in 1976. Its second, 1998, edition is called '''''The Sirius Mystery: New Scientific Evidence of Alien Contact 5,000 Years Ago'''''.

==Overview==
The book presents the [[hypothesis]] that the [[Dogon people]] of [[Mali]], in west Africa, preserve a tradition of contact with intelligent extraterrestrial beings from the [[Sirius]] star system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news
  | last = Sheppard
  | first = R.Z. 
  | title = Worlds in Collusion
  | magazine = [[Time (magazine)|Time]]
  | date = August 2, 1976
  | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,914468,00.html
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These beings, who are hypothesized to have taught the arts of civilization to humans, are claimed in the book to have originated the systems of the [[Pharaoh]]s of [[Egypt]], the [[Greek mythology|mythology of Greek civilization]], and the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], among other things. Temple's theory was heavily based on his interpretation of the work of [[ethnography|ethnographers]] [[Marcel Griaule]] and [[Germaine Dieterlen]]. A substantial bulk of ''The Sirius Mystery'' consists of comparative linguistic and mythological scholarship, pointing out resemblances among Dogon, Egyptian and [[Sumer]]ian beliefs and symbols. Greek and Arab myths and words are considered to a lesser extent.

The "mystery" that is central to the book is how the Dogon allegedly acquired knowledge of [[Sirius B]], the [[white dwarf]] companion star of [[Sirius A]], invisible to the naked eye. Temple did not argue that the only way that the Dogon could have obtained what he understood to be accurate information on Sirius B was by contact with an advanced civilization; he considered alternative possibilities, such as a very ancient, advanced, and lost civilization that was behind the sudden appearance of advanced civilization in both [[Egypt]] and [[Sumeria]]. He personally found the theory of alien contact more convincing, but he did not claim certainty about it. [[Noah Brosch]] explained in his book ''Sirius Matters'' that cultural transfer could have taken place between 19th century French astronomers and Dogon tribe members during the observations of the [[Solar eclipse of April 16, 1893|solar eclipse on 16 April 1893]]. The expedition, led by [[Henri Deslandres]], stayed in the field for five weeks and it is reasonable that during this time many contacts with the locals took place, and that relatively modern astronomical knowledge was then transferred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brosch|first1=Noah|title=Sirius Matters|date=2008|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-8319-8|pages=65–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some doubts have been raised about the reliability of Griaule and Dieterlein's work on which ''The Sirius Mystery'' is based,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.ramtops.co.uk/dogon.html| title = The Dogon Revisited| accessdate = 2007-10-13| author = Bernard R. Ortiz de Montellano| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6ESXHPjkp?url=http://www.ramtops.co.uk/dogon.html| archivedate = 2013-02-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="coppens"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.philipcoppens.com/dogonshame.html| title = Dogon Shame| accessdate = 2007-10-13| author = Philip Coppens| author-link = Philip Coppens (author)| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6ESXBTTMa?url=http://www.philipcoppens.com/dogonshame.html| archivedate = 2013-02-15| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and alternative explanations have been proposed. The claims about the Dogons' astronomical knowledge have been challenged. For instance, the anthropologist Walter Van Beek, who studied the Dogon after Griaule and Dieterlen, found no evidence that the Dogon considered Sirius to be a double star and/or that astronomy was particularly important in their belief system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zc3zw-YgOPkC&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=Sirians+Sagan&amp;ei=22u2SfPZKJi8M6LflfEL&amp;client=firefox-a#PPA180,M1 Holberg, Jay B. ''Sirius''] Springer 2007 {{ISBN|978-0-387-48941-4}} p176&lt;/ref&gt; Others, such as Marcel Griaule's daughter [[Geneviève Calame-Griaule]] and an anthropologist, Luc de Heusch, came to criticize Van Beek's dismissal as "political" and riddled with "unchecked speculation", demonstrating a general ignorance of Dogon esoteric tradition.&lt;ref&gt;

==Reviews of claims==

===Ian Ridpath===
In 1978, Astronomer [[Ian Ridpath]] observed, in an article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'', "The whole Dogon legend of Sirius and its companions is riddled with ambiguities, contradictions, and downright errors, at least if we try to interpret it literally."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Ridpath, {{cite web |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |title=''Skeptical Inquirer'' |accessdate=2013-02-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030217073018/http://www.csicop.org/si/7809/sirius.html |archivedate=February 17, 2003 |df= }}, Fall 1978&lt;/ref&gt; Ridpath stated that while the information that the Dogon probably gained from Europeans to some extent resembles the facts about Sirius, the presumed original Dogon knowledge on the star is very far from the facts. Ridpath concluded that the information that resembles the facts about Sirius was probably ascertained by way of cultural contamination. More recent research suggests that the contaminator was Griaule himself.&lt;ref name="coppens"/&gt;

===Carl Sagan===
Astronomer [[Carl Sagan]] touched upon the issue in his book ''[[Broca's Brain]]'' (1979), seeing problems in Temple's hypothesis. As an example, Sagan believes that because the Dogon seem to have no knowledge of another planet beyond [[Saturn]] which has rings, that their knowledge is therefore more likely to have come from European, and not extraterrestrial, sources.&lt;ref name = cs-bb-1979&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===James Oberg===
Journalist and skeptic [[James Oberg]] collected claims that have appeared concerning Dogon mythology in his 1982 book.&lt;ref&gt;James Oberg, "[http://www.debunker.com/texts/dogon.html Chapter 6, The Sirius Mystery]", in ''UFOs and Outer Space Mysteries'', (1982) Donning Press&lt;/ref&gt; According to Oberg, the Dogons' astronomical information resembles the knowledge and speculations of European astronomical knowledge of the late 1920s. The Dogon may have acquired their astronomical knowledge, including the information on Sirius, from European visitors before their mythology was recorded in the 1930s. Oberg also points out that the Dogon were not an isolated tribe, and thus it was not even necessary for outsiders to inform the Dogon about Sirius B. They could very well have acquired such knowledge abroad, passing it on to their tribe later. Sirius B was first observed in 1862, and had been predicted in 1844 on dynamic grounds. However, Oberg does concede that such assumptions of recent acquisition are "entirely circumstantial" and have no foundation in documented evidence.

===Jason Colavito===
The skeptic [[Jason Colavito]] counts ''The Sirius Mystery'' among the body of works in a tradition of ancient astronaut ideas that was ultimately inspired by [[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s [[Cthulhu Mythos]] in his 2005 book ''[[The Cult of Alien Gods|The Cult of Alien Gods: H. P. Lovecraft and Extraterrestrial Pop Culture]]''.

==Unproven claims==
One unproven aspect of the reported Dogon knowledge of the Sirius system is the assertion that the Dogon knew of another star in the Sirius system, Emme Ya, or "larger than Sirius B but lighter and dim in magnitude." A dynamical study published in 1995, based on anomalous perturbations of Sirius B (suggestive of the star being gravitationally influenced by another body) concluded that the presence of a third star orbiting Sirius could not be ruled out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |bibcode=1995A&amp;A...299..621B |title=Is Sirius a triple star? |journal=Astronomy and Astrophysics  |volume=299 |pages=621–628}}&lt;/ref&gt; An apparent "third star" observed in the 1920s is now confirmed as a background object,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

{{Blockquote|Benest and Duvent found that stable orbits with a period of up to six years exist around Sirius A. There are no stable orbits around the less massive Sirius B which exceed three years. Therefore, if Sirius C exists, it must orbit Sirius A. It is also possible to conclude that such a star could in no way be responsible for the flurry of sightings from the 1920s, it would be too faint and too close to Sirius A to have ever been seen by visual observers.&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Holberg: "Sirius: brightest diamond in the night sky". 2007. pp168&lt;/ref&gt;|J.B. Holberg}}

The former study also concluded that while a triple system for Sirius could not be fully eliminated, the probability was low.

Temple's book and the debates that followed its release publicized the existence of the Dogon tribe among many [[New Age]] followers and proponents of [[ancient astronaut]] theories. Speculation about the Dogon on numerous websites is now mingled with fact, leading to wide misunderstanding among the public about Dogon mythology. Temple, however, has stated in the reprint of ''The Sirius Mystery'' (1999) that he in no way supports what he refers to as "sinister cults" that have been inspired by his book.&lt;ref name = rkgt-tsm-1976&gt;{{Cite book

'''''The State of Africa: A History Of Fifty Years Of Independence''''' (republished in 2011 as '''''The State of Africa: A History Of The Continent Since Independence''''') is a 2005 book by British writer [[Martin Meredith]].

==Background and synopsis==
'''The State of Africa''' in-depth investigation into the history of Africa since European decolonisation. Meredith examines the many challenges much of Africa has faced including civil conflict and lawlessness, government corruption and dictatorships. Africa is described as a continent where "bad-news stories (famine, genocide, corruption) massively outweigh the good ([[History of South Africa (1994–present)|South Africa]])."

==Reception==
In ''[[The Age]]'' Pamela Bone wrote that in "this big, exhaustive history Martin Meredith leaves us in little doubt as to what he believes is the primary cause of Africa's pain: its corrupt, tyrannical, incompetent, thieving, "vampire-like" leaders... It documents, country by country, decade by decade, a depressing litany of wars, revolutions, dictatorships, famines, genocide, coups and economic collapse".&lt;ref name="theage"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/news/reviews/the-state-of-africa/2005/09/16/1126750086585.html|title=The state of Africa - Reviews - Books - Entertainment|website=theage.com.au|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Bone wrote that the book is an "impressive history, well told" she criticised the fact that "the book misses the spirit of Africa, the joyfulness and strength of the people, which persists despite their appalling hardships, and which gives hope".

Writing in ''[[The Independent]]'' Alex Duval Smith described ''The State of Africa'' as a "dispassionate analysis" that "does more than perhaps he (Meredith) realises to set the past 50 African years in a continuum"&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/reviews/the-state-of-africa-by-martin-meredith-297541.html|title=The State of Africa by Martin Meredith|website=The Independent|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chris Nkwatsibwe, a human rights activist from [[Uganda]] praised the book. Nkwatsibwe wrote that "Meredith works with the colossal spatial and temporal span of this subject with ease, weaving chapters together in a loose chronological order to present the narrative as a patchwork quilt of Africa, rather than as a rigid country-by-country timeline".&lt;ref name="ylf-eastafrica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ylf-eastafrica.org/2015/01/a-brief-review-of-the-state-of-africa-martin-meredith/|title=A Brief Review of ‘The State of Africa’ &amp;#8211; Martin Meredith &amp;#124; Young Leaders Forum|website=ylf-eastafrica.org|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Three Ages of the Interior Life''''' : ''Prelude of Eternal Life'' (Les Trois Ages de la Vie Interieure) is a book written by French theologian [[Reginald Garrigou-Lagrange]], published in 1938 and 1939 in two volumes, while teaching at the [[Pontifical University of St. Thomas Aquinas (Angelicum)]], Rome from 1909 to 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter= Translator's Preface |title= The Three Ages of the Interior Life, Catholic Spiritual Teaching |url = http://www.christianperfection.info/tta1.php#bk2 |accessdate= 2014-07-23  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
The book explains the entire Catholic tradition on the [[Interior life (Catholic theology)|interior life]] as well as [[spirituality|spiritual life]] covering virtually all aspects of the faith. Composed of 95 chapters, it is a synthesis of Garrigou Lagrange's earlier works, ''Christian Perfection and Contemplation'' (''Perfection chrétienne et contemplation'' (1923))  and ''Love of God and the Cross of Jesus'' (''L'amour de Dieu et la Croix de Jésus'' (1929)).&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title = The Three Ages of the Interior Life: Preface |publisher= Catholic Spiritual Teaching| url = http://www.christianperfection.info/tta1.php | accessdate = 2014-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely regarded as a classic of modern theological literature.

In the book he propounded the thesis that infused [[contemplation]] and the resulting [[mysticism|mystical]] life are in the normal way of holiness of [[Christian perfection]]. This influenced the section entitled "Chapter V: The Universal Call to Holiness in the Church" in the [[Second Vatican Council]]'s Dogmatic Constitution on the Church, ''[[Lumen gentium]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hprweb.com/2009/04/rehabilitation-of-garrigou-lagrange/|title=Rehabilitation of Garrigou-Lagrange|author=[http://fatherbtm.com/ Mullady, Brian, O.P.]|accessdate=2012-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Head old Roman Glyptothek Munich 320.jpg|thumb|Portrait Bust of a Man, Ancient Rome, 60 BC]]'''Verism''' is the artistic preference of contemporary everyday subject matter instead of the heroic or legendary in art and literature; it is a form of realism. The word comes from [[Latin]] ''verus'' (true).

==Roman art==
Verism first appeared as the artistic preference of the Roman people during the late [[Roman Republic]] (147–30 BC) and was often used for Republican portraits or for the head of “[[pseudo-athlete]]” sculptures. Verism, often described as "warts and all," shows the imperfections of the subject, such as warts, wrinkles, and furrows. It should be clearly noted that the term veristic in no way implies that these portraits are more "real." Rather, they too can be highly exaggerated or idealised, but within a different visual idiom, one which favours wrinkles, furrows, and signs of age as indicators of gravity and authority. Age during the Late Republic was very highly valued and was synonymous with power, since one of the only ways to hold power in Roman society was to be part of the [[Roman Senate|Senate]]. Yet to be in the Senate, a Roman [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] had to be at least forty-two years of age, which in ancient times was considered a mature stage of life.&lt;ref name=smith1981&gt;''Greek, Foreigners, And Roman Republic Portraits'', Cambridge Journals: The Journal of Roman Studies, 1981&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|37}}[[File:General de Tivoli (Massimo) 01.JPG|thumbnail|left|General de Tivoli, pseudo-athlete with veristic head, ca. 90-70 BC, Tivoli]]It is debated among scholars and art historians whether these veristic portraits were truly blunt records of actual features or exaggerated features designed to make a statement about a person’s personality.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010"&gt;''A History of Roman Art'', Enhanced Edition, Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning, Boston, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|54}}  It is widely held in academia that in the ancient world [[physiognomy]] revealed the character of a person; thus, the personality characteristics seen in veristic busts could be taken to express certain virtues very much admired during the Republic.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|54}} However,scholars can never know for certain the accuracy of portrait renditions made long before their own era.

==Verism throughout the Roman Empire==
As stated in the section above, verism first appeared during the Late Republic. The subjects of veristic portraiture were almost exclusively men, and these men were usually of advanced age, for generally it was elders who held power in the Republic.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|53}} However, women are also seen in veristic portraiture, though to a lesser extent, and they too were almost always depicted as elderly.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|53}} A key example of this is a marble head found at Palombara, Spain. Carved between 40 BCE and 30 BCE, during the decade of the [[Liberators' civil war|civil war]] that followed Julius Caesar’s assassination, the woman’s face shows her advanced age.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|54}} The artist carved the woman with sunken cheeks and pouches under her eyes to illustrate her age, much like male veristic portraiture of the time.&lt;ref name=kleiner2010 /&gt;{{rp|54}}

Verism, while the height of fashion during the Late Republican era, quickly fell into obscurity when [[Augustus]] and the rest of the [[Julio-Claudian dynasty]] (44 BC-68 AD) came to power. During this imperial reign, Greek [[Classical sculpture]] that featured "eternal youth" was favored over verism. It wasn’t until after the suicide of [[Nero]] in 68 AD that verism was revived.[[File:Vespasianus01 pushkin.jpg|thumbnail|right|Bust of Vespasian, ca. 75-79]]During the [[Year of the Four Emperors]] (68-69 AD) that resulted from Nero’s suicide, when [[Galba]], [[Vitellius]], and [[Otho]] all grappled for the throne, verism made a resurgence, as seen in obverse portraits of Galba on bronze coins or marble busts of Vitellius. When [[Vespasian]] and his sons came to the throne the [[Flavian dynasty]] harnessed verism as a source of propaganda. Scholars believe that Vespasian used the shift from the Classical style to that of veristic portraiture to send a visual propagandistic message distinguishing him from the previous emperor. Vespasian’s portraits showed him as an older, serious, and unpretentious man who was in every respect the anti-Nero: a career military officer concerned not for his own pleasure but for the welfare of the Roman people, the security of the Empire, and the solvency of the treasury.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|123}} Like the Romans from the Late Republic, Vespasian used veristic busts to underscore traditional values as a way to indicate to the Roman people a connection to the Republic.&lt;ref name="kleiner2010" /&gt;{{rp|123}} With this reminder of the Late Republic, many Roman citizens were likely put at ease, knowing Vespasian was truly not like the previous emperor Nero, who represented everything the Republic abhorred. Yet after the Flavian period verism again faded into obscurity.

==Verism in academia==
Veristic portraits of the late Republic hold a special fascination for classical art historians. Romans had inherited the use of sculpted marble heads from the Greeks but they did not inherit the veristic style from them. To scholars verism is uniquely Roman. Scholars have put forth multiple theories as to what or who were the precursors to Republican portraiture. Yet what is important to note is that there is not one single accepted theory of the origin of verism. The question of veristic style remains to this day essentially open and unresolved. Each theory, while plausible in its own way, will require further research and adequate consideration among scholars.

=== First Theory ===
[[File:IMG 1075 - Perugia - Museo archeologico - Urna etrusca - 7 ago 2006 - Foto G. Dall'Orto2.jpg|thumbnail|right|Etruscan Cinerary Urn, c. 150-100 BC]]Scholars believe the ancient [[Italic peoples]] had an inclination to veristic representation leading to influence on later Roman art.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 39"&gt;Richter, ''The Origin of Verism in Roman Portraits'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; From a central Italian provenance in ancient times tribes from this area used [[Terracotta]] and [[Bronze]] to make a somewhat realistic portrayal of the human head.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Yet the ‘Italic’ heads, as they are called, are not seriously considered to be a favorable or strong theory held among scholars as being forerunners to the Republican portraits.&lt;ref name="Richter, p. 39"/&gt; Scholars note that none of the realistic looking specimens can be shown to be earlier than the arrival of the new wave of Greek influence, rather than vice versa.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}}

=== Second Theory ===

Scholars debate whether the heads of reclining figures on [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]] cinerary urns are the forebears to Republican portraiture.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} In Etruscan culture it was traditional and very common in [[Etruscan art]] to provide a naturalistic look to figures. Many cinerary urns are realistic looking or at least have harshly treated faces.&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|30}} Scholars debate whether the realistic-looking style of head of these figures were a native creation which influenced the Romans, or whether the Romans influenced [[Etruria]].&lt;ref name="smith1981" /&gt;{{rp|31}} The issues relating to chronological time casts doubts as to the accuracy of the theory.

=== Third Theory ===

Scholars consider the ancient Roman custom of making wax portraits, known as funerary or [[Death mask]], of their ancestors as a convincing source for the veristic style. H. Drerup, a man of academia, argues that death masks molded straight from the face were early in use at Rome and exerted a ‘direct influence’ on Republican portraits.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Yet research has cast doubt on this theory. None of the funerary masks date before the 1st century AD. Evidence suggests the ancestral funerary masks merely kept pace with contemporary portraits in the round.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Chronology seems to be an issue with supporting the theory.
[[File:Face of a child-MGR Lyon-IMG 9850.jpg|thumbnail|left|Roman funerary mask of a child]]

=== Fourth Theory ===

Scholars debate whether Egyptian influence started Roman verism. A group of portraits in hard [[Stone quarries of ancient Egypt|Egyptian stone]] from the Roman [[Ptolemaic Kingdom]] show a harsh realism that is similarly seen in Republican portraits.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Scholars believe the Egyptian portraits began to be made before the Republican portraits and strongly influenced the Romans into establishing the veristic style when Egyptian priests and cults came into contact with Italy and Greece.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Although this theory like the others has merit, lack of concrete dating of this certain Egyptian style makes scholars doubt the creditability. Suggested stylistic dates often fluctuate by two or three centuries leaving scholars with no solid evidence for when the style of harshly realistic [[Portraiture in Ancient Egypt|Egyptian portraiture]] begun.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|31}} Historians also note Romans did not have extensive military or commercial contact with [[Egypt]] before 30 BCE, which was after the Late Republic when verism was being used on portraiture.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|32}} Scholars conclude that it is unlikely that Egyptian portraits influenced the Republican style.

=== Fifth Theory ===

Another theory presented to scholars in classical academia suggests that verism came about from Greek reactions to the conquering Romans. The theory goes that Romans in the Republic privately cherished the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic culture]] yet still held onto Republic values.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|34}} This interest leaked similar portrayals seen in the more realistic Hellenistic royal portraits of the [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontic]] and [[Bactria|Bactarian]] kings of the first half of the 2nd century BC, such as the slight turn of their heads and upward glance of the eyes, into Roman veristic busts.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|34}} As Rome conquered Greece the empire saw an influx of talented Greek artists who were commissioned by the Romans to create their portraits that portrayed both the [[Hellenistic art|Hellenistic look]] and Republic values. It should be noted that Greek artists notoriously portrayed foreigners in an unfavorable light as a result of Greek attitudes of superiority.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} For the Romans the Greeks found them not only to be foreigners, yet to be increasingly pompous and unlikeable oppressors.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} Greek artists were little concerned to put the sitter’s case favorably and portrayed Romans with an unsympathetic likeness.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|35}} As a result, the Greek artist would maintain the Hellenistic ‘pathos formula’ – turn of the head and neck, eyes looking upward – but the Greek sculptor, rather than adapt the Roman’s features to a Hellenistic ruler ideal, had concentrated on bringing out an air of caricature to the face leading to what scholars call veristic portraiture.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|36}}

Some scholars refute this theory as being the cause of verism. Scholars doubt that Romans would not have been angered by the caricature like portrayal given to them by the Greeks. Many question why the Romans did not punish the Greeks for this obvious slight. Yet scholars who are in favor of this theory state that the Romans simply didn’t care for this over realistic portrayal. The Republic values of that time favored the straightforward and honest Roman citizen who did not need the deceits of art, but instead should be portrayed as they were, without artifice, for this would best bring out their Republican values.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|37}} As a result, some art historians, like [[R. R. R. Smith]], believe verism originated from the negative Greek attitudes, if not somewhat unconscious attitudes, the artists felt towards these particular foreign clients, which was allowed to work itself into the Roman portraits because the artists had been freed from the usual obligation to flatter and idealized the sitter and instead allowed to sculpt without artifice.&lt;ref name=smith1981 /&gt;{{rp|38}}
