'''Achkan''' ({{lang-hi|अचकन}}) also known as ''Baghal bandi'' is a knee length jacket worn by men in the [[Indian subcontinent]], particularly in [[India]], [[Nepal]], [[Bangladesh]] and in [[Pakistan]] much like the [[Angarkha]] and [[Sherwani]].

==Etymology==
[[File:Rajput Sherwani 2014-04-23 04-27.JPG|200px|thumbnail|Achkan worn by men during a wedding in [[Rajasthan]], [[India]]]]
{{see also|Angarkha}}
The word achkan is derived from [[Angarkha]] ([[Sanskrit language|Sanskrit]]: अंगरक्षक, anga-rakshaka 'body protector').&lt;ref&gt;Zaira Mis, Marcel Mis (2001) Asian Costumes and Textiles: From the Bosphorus to Fujiama [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=V-wcAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=angarkha++sanskrit&amp;dq=angarkha++sanskrit&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAWoVChMIiIfj-e3dxgIVqhbbCh1dWgDU]&lt;/ref&gt; The angarkha was worn in various parts of the Indian subcontinent, while the basic cut remained the same, styles and lengths varied from region to region.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=qYK1AAAAIAAJ&amp;q=angarkha&amp;dq=angarkha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAWoVChMI9PzF2_jdxgIV6QfbCh0zwArh Kumar, Ritu (2006) Costumes and textiles of royal India]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The achkan originated in India as early as 2nd century B.C as court dress for nobles and royals and was worn as everyday wear until late 20th century by general population and also by the [[princely state]]s of the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It can be distinguished from the [[Sherwani]] through various aspects, particularly the front opening. Achkan traditionally has side-opening tied with strings, this style of opening is known as ''baghal bandi'' but frontal opening were not uncommon, similar to [[Angarkha]]. While [[sherwani]] always has straight frontal opening, due to its function as outer-coat. Achkan, like [[Angarkha]] was traditionally worn with sash known as ''patka'', ''kamarband'' or ''dora'' wrapped around the waist to keep the entire costume in place. While [[sherwani]] was traditionally worn as decorative outer-coat for special occasions during medieval times. Achkan is always worn with either [[dhoti]] or [[churidar]]. Achkan is made from various fabrics for both formal and informal occasions, it features traditional embroidery like gota and badla. Today, achkan is commonly worn by the grooms during wedding ceremonies or other formal festive occasions in the Indian subcontinent.

There are various regional variations of achkan worn throughout the Indian subcontinent, and are known by regional names such as ''Daura'' in Nepal and Northeast India, ''Angi'' in Southern India and ''Chola'' or ''Cholu'' in Indian Himalayas.

[[File:St-john.jpg|right|thumb|St. John at Patmos: the receiving of an apocalyptic vision]]
An '''apocalypse''' ([[Ancient Greek]]: ἀποκάλυψις ''apokálypsis'', from ἀπό and καλύπτω, literally meaning "an uncovering") is a disclosure of knowledge or [[revelation]]. In religious and occult concepts it is usually a disclosure of something hidden, "a vision of heavenly secrets that can make sense of earthly realities". Historically, the term has a heavy religious connotation as commonly seen in the prophetic revelations of [[eschatology]] and were obtained through [[Dream|dreams]] or [[Vision (spirituality)|spiritual visions]]. In the biblical book of revelation apocalypse says to be the complete and final destruction of the world.

It is also the Greek word for the last book of the [[New Testament]] entitled "[[Book of Revelation|Revelation]]". The term is also included in the title of some non-biblical canon books involving revelations. Today, the term is commonly used in reference to any larger-scale catastrophic event, or chain of detrimental events to humanity or nature. In all contexts, the revealed events usually entail some form of an [[end time]] scenario or the [[Global catastrophic risk|end of the world]] or revelations into divine, heavenly, or spiritual realms. There are many other books from the Jewish and Christian world that can be classified as apocalypses. In addition to  other books of the bible contain passages pertaining to a apocalypse/ apocalyptic circumstances.

==Origination==

===Dreams and visions===
[[File:Apocalypse vasnetsov.jpg|thumb|left|[[Viktor Vasnetsov]], the [[Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse]]]]
The [[revelation]] may be made through a dream, as in the [[Book of Daniel]], or through a [[Vision (religion)|vision]], as in the [[Book of Revelation]]. In biblical meaning Revelation is something that is shown to humans by “God”: Other words used to describe Revelation include: apocalypse, Armageddon, prophecy, unveiling. [[Fasting]], mainly as part of a spiritual discipline, can lead one into an apocalyptic prophetic vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Sacramental-Prophetic Vision : Christian Spirituality in a Suffering World|last=Eggmeier|first=Matthew|publisher=Michael Glazier|year=2014|isbn=9780814680926|location=Collegeville, MN|pages=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; One example of this is found in the Book of Daniel which is the first apocalypse in the [[Protestant Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carey|first=Greg|date=April 2017|title=Daniel as an Americanized Apocalypse|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0020964316688052|journal=Interpretation: A Journal of Bible and Theology|volume=71|issue=2|pages=190|via=Sage Journals}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a long period of fasting,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2010:1-4;&amp;version=9;|title=Daniel 10:1–4 (King James Version)|publisher=Bible Gateway|accessdate=2007-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel is standing by a river when a heavenly being appears to him, and the revelation follows (Daniel 10:2ff). Apocalypse is also one of the writings of the Jews and Christians, dating back to 200 B.C and A.D: in these writings God destroys the powers of evil a raises up a righteous way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Revelation|last=Doyle|first=Arthur|publisher=|year=|isbn=978-1984106667|location=|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Apocalyptic visions or dreams show hidden information/truth about God, human life and the spiritual world. These visions or dreams usually show insights about life after death. A part about Gods final judgement deals with forces of evil and forces of good. In the Bible God defeats an evil force forever and bring justice and mercy to the world.  Rev 20–22&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=bible|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=20-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and the article [http://bibleresources.americanbible.org/resource/day-of-the-lord “Day of the Lord”]

==Symbolism==
[[File:BambergApocalypseFolio019v7AngelsWith7TrumpetsAnd1WithCenser.JPG|thumb|150px|The [[Seven trumpets]].]]

=== Numerical ===
[[Apocalyptic literature|Apocalyptic writing]] often makes wide use of [[symbol]]ism. One instance of this occurs where [[gematria]] is employed, either for obscuring the writer's meaning or enhancing it; as a number of ancient cultures used letters also as numbers (''i.e.'', the Romans with their use of "[[Roman numerals]]"). Thus the symbolic name "''[[Taxo]]''," "''[[Assumptio Mosis]]''", ix. 1; the [[Number of the Beast|''"Number of the Beast''" (616/666)]], in the [[Book of Revelation]] [[Revelation 13:18|13:18]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Revelation 13:16–18 (King James Version) | year = 2012| publisher =Bible Gateway | url =http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2013:16-18;&amp;version=9; | accessdate = 2007-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the number 666 ('Iησōῦς), ''[[Sibylline Oracles|Sibyllines]]'', i.326–30.

=== Lengths of time / periods ===
Similar is the frequent prophecy of the length of time through which the events predicted must be fulfilled. Thus, the "time, times, and a half," [[Daniel's final vision|Daniel 12:7]] which has been taken to be 3½ years in length by [[Dispensationalism|Dispensationalists]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel 12:7 (King James Version) |publisher=Bible Gateway |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012:7;&amp;version=9; |accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001718/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012%3A7%3B&amp;version=9%3B |archivedate=2007-12-09 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; the "''fifty-eight times''" of [[Book of Enoch|Enoch]], xc.5, "''Assumptio Mosis''", x.11; the announcement of a certain number of "weeks" or days, which starting point in Daniel 9:24, 25 is "the going forth of the commandment to restore and to build [[Jerusalem]] unto the [[Messiah]] the Prince shall be seven weeks",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =Daniel 9:24–25 (King James Version)| publisher =Bible Gateway | url = http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%209:24–25;&amp;version=9; | accessdate =2007-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; a mention of 1290 days after the covenant/sacrifice is broken (Daniel 12:11),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Daniel 12:11 (King James Version) |publisher=Bible Gateway |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012:11;&amp;version=9; |accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105030232/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Daniel%2012%3A11%3B&amp;version=9%3B |archivedate=2007-11-05 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 12; Enoch xciii.3–10; 2 Esdras 14:11, 12; ''[[2 Baruch|Apocalypse of Baruch]]'' xxvi–viii; [[Revelation 11|Revelation 11:3]], which mentions "two witnesses" with supernatural power,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revelation 11:3 (King James Version) |publisher=Bible Gateway |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011:3;&amp;version=9; |accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001834/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2011%3A3%3B&amp;version=9%3B |archivedate=2007-12-09 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; 12:6;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Revelation 12:6 (King James Version) |publisher=Bible Gateway |url=http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012:6;&amp;version=9; |accessdate=2007-11-21 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071209001851/http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Revelation%2012%3A6%3B&amp;version=9%3B |archivedate=2007-12-09 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; compare ''Assumptio Mosis'', vii.1.

=== End of the age ===
In the Hebrew [[Old Testament]] some pictures of the end of the age were images of the judgment of the wicked and the glorification of those who were given [[Imputed righteousness|righteousness]] before God.

[[File:Archivist Survey.jpg|right|thumb|An archivist surveying an unprocessed collection of materials. Surveying is commonly done to determine priorities for preservation and/or conservation of materials before an archivist begins arrangement and description.]]
An '''archivist''' (''AR-kiv-ist'') is an information professional who assesses, collects, organizes, preserves, maintains control over, and provides access to [[Document|record]]s and [[archive]]s determined to have long-term value. The records maintained by an archivist can consist of a variety of forms, including letters, diaries, logs, other personal documents, government documents, sound and/or picture recordings, digital files, or other physical objects.

==Description==
As [[Richard Pearce-Moses]] wrote:

:"Archivists keep records that have enduring value as reliable memories of the past, and they help people find and understand the information they need in those records."&lt;ref&gt;Pearce-Moses, Richard. "Identity and Diversity: What Is an Archivist?" ''Archival Outlook'', March/April 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Determining what records have enduring value can be challenging. Archivists must also select records valuable enough to justify the costs of storage and preservation, plus the labor-intensive expenses of arrangement, description, and reference service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Developing and Maintaining Practical Archives: A How-to-do-it Manual|last=Hunter|first=Gregory|publisher=Neal-Schuman Publishers, Inc.|others=|year=2003|isbn=|editor=|location=New York|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory and scholarly work underpinning [[archive]]s practices is called [[archival science]].

The most common related occupations are [[librarian]]s, [[Curator|museum curators]], and [[records manager]]s. The archivist occupation is distinct from that of librarian. The two occupations have separate courses of training, adhere to separate and distinct principles, and are represented by separate [[Professional association|professional organization]]s. In general, the librarian tends to deal with published media (where the [[metadata]], such as author, title, and date of publication, may be readily apparent and can be presented in standardized form), whereas the archivist deals with unpublished media (which has different challenges such as the metadata not always being immediately apparent, containing complications and variety, and more likely to depend on [[provenance]]).

In addition, because archival records are frequently unique, some archivists may be as much concerned with the preservation and custody of the information carrier (i.e. the physical document) as with its informational content. In this regard, some would argue the archivist may have more in common with the [[Curator|museum curator]] than with the librarian.

The occupation of archivist is also frequently distinguished from that of [[records manager]], although in this case the distinction is less absolute: the archivist is predominantly concerned with records deemed worthy of permanent preservation, whereas the records manager is more concerned with records of current administrative importance.

==Duties and work environment==
Archivists' duties include acquiring and [[archival appraisal|appraising]] new collections, [[manuscript processing|arranging and describing records]], providing reference service, and preserving materials.  In arranging records, archivists apply two important principles: [[provenance]] and [[original order]].  Provenance refers to the creation of records and keeping different records separate in order to maintain context. Many entities create records, including governments, businesses, universities, and individuals. Original order is applied by keeping records in their order as established and maintained by the creator(s). Both provenance and original order are closely related to the concept of ''[[respect des fonds]]'', which states that records from one corporate body should not be mixed with records from another.

There are two aspects to arrangement: intellectual and physical. Both aspects follow the principle of original order. Archivists process the records physically by placing them in acid-free folders and boxes to ensure their long-term survival. They also process the records intellectually, by determining what the records consist of, how they are organized, and what, if any, [[finding aid]]s need to be created. Finding aids can be box lists or descriptive inventories, or indexes. Even if the original arrangement is unclear or unhelpful in terms of accessing the collection, it is rarely rearranged to something that makes more sense. This is because preserving the original order shows how the creator of the records functioned, why the records were created, and how they went about arranging them. Moreover, the provenance and authenticity of the records may be lost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Roe|first=Kathleen D.|title=Arranging and Describing Archives and Manuscripts|year=2005|publisher=Society of American Archivists|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, original order is not always the best way to maintain some collections and archivists must use their own experience and current best practices to determine the correct way to preserve collections of mixed media or those lacking a clear original arrangement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://saa.archivists.org/store/understanding-archives-and-manuscripts-afs-ii/339/|title=Understanding Archives and Manuscripts|last=O'Toole|first=James M. and Richard J. Cox|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=|year=2006|isbn=|editor=|location=Chicago|pages=|chapter=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists' work encompasses a range of [[Ethics|ethical]] decisions that may be thought of as falling into three broad and intertwined areas: legal requirements; professional standards; and accountability to society in selecting and preserving documentary materials that serve as a [[Primary sources|primary source]] of knowledge, and influence [[collective memory]] and identity.&lt;ref&gt;Danielson, Elena S. (2010). ''The Ethical Archivist''. Chicago: The Society of American Archivists. p. 22-26, 46.&lt;/ref&gt; In negotiating the ethical conflicts that arise in their work, archivists are guided by [[Ethical code|codes of ethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Danielson (2010), chapter 1, "Codes of Ethics," p. 21-46.&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of American Archivists first adopted a [https://www2.archivists.org/groups/committee-on-ethics-and-professional-conduct/code-of-ethics-history code of ethics] in 1980;&lt;ref name="Horn"&gt;Horn, David E (1989). "[http://americanarchivist.org/doi/abs/10.17723/aarc.52.1.nk661527341j0610 The Development of Ethics in Archival Practice]." ''The American Archivist'', 2(1), p. 64-71. It was based on an earlier statement produced in training programs at the National Archives, under Archivist of the United States [[Wayne C. Grover]], and published as "[http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015071393535;view=image;page=root;size=100;seq=713;num=307 The Archivist's Code]" (''American Archivist'', vol. 18, no. 4, p. 307-308).&lt;/ref&gt; the [[International Council on Archives]] adopted one in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 ICA Code of Ethics] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150929074919/http://www.ica.org/?lid=5555&amp;bid=225 |date=29 September 2015 }}." International Council on Archives. Retrieved 2015-09-01. The ICA code is available in 23 languages.&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside their work in arranging and caring for collections, archivists assist users in interpreting materials and answering inquiries. This reference work can be a small part of an archivist's job in a smaller organization, or consist of most of their occupation in a larger archive where specific roles (such as [[Manuscript processing|processing archivist]] and [[Reference interview|reference archivist]]) may be delineated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=O'Donnell|first=Frances|date=|year=2000|title=Reference Service in an Academic Archives|url=https://www-sciencedirect-com.proxy-um.researchport.umd.edu/science/article/pii/S0099133399001470|journal=The [[Journal of Academic Librarianship]]|volume=26|issue=2|pages=110–118|doi=10.1016/S0099-1333(99)00147-0|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Archivists work for a variety of organizations, including [[government agency|government agencies]], [[local authorities]], museums, hospitals, historical societies, businesses, charities, corporations, [[colleges]] and universities, and any institution whose records may potentially be valuable to researchers, exhibitors, [[genealogist]]s, or others. They can also work on the collections of a large family or even of an [[individual]].

Archivists are often educators as well; it is not unusual for an archivist employed at a university or college to lecture in a subject related to their collection. Archivists employed at cultural institutions or for local government frequently design educational or [[outreach]] programs to further the ability of archive users to understand and access information in their collections. This might include such varied activities as [[Art exhibitions|exhibitions]], [[Advertising campaign|promotional]] events, or even media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/governance/guidelines/cu_guidelines4.asp|title=Guidelines for College and University Archives, Section IV. Core Archival Functions, Subsection D. Service |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The advent of [[Encoded Archival Description]], along with increasing demand for materials to be made available online, has required archivists to become more tech-savvy in the past decade.  Many archivists are now acquiring basic [[XML]] skills in order to make their finding aids available to researchers online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml|title=Encoded Archival Description |accessdate=23 April 2007 |publisher=Archives Hub| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070404125702/http://archiveshub.ac.uk/arch/ead.shtml| archivedate= 4 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skills==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:Between_the_Forks_Exhibit.JPG|right|thumb|An Archivist and volunteer worker with an exhibit on local history.  Project management, preservation of historic materials, and research skills are just a few of the abilities required in an archivist's background to make such public education efforts effective and exciting. {{speedy-image-c|22 April 2007}}]] --&gt;

Because of the varied nature of the job within different organizations and work environments, archivists need to have a wide range of [[skills]]:
* Those who work in reference and access-oriented positions should have good customer services skills, to help patrons with their research.
* A basic knowledge of [[Preservation: Library and Archival Science|conservation]] is needed to help extend the life of cultural artifacts. Many types of media (such as photographs, acidic papers, and unstable copy processes) can deteriorate if not stored and maintained properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Mary Lynn | last=Ritzenthaler | year=1993 | title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=Society of American Archivists | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Although many archival collections consist solely of paper records, increasingly archivists must confront the new challenges posed by the [[digital preservation|preservation]] of electronic records, so they need to be forward-looking and technologically proficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|accessdate=3 April 2007 |publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Educational preparation==
The educational preparation for archivists varies from country to country.

===Australia===
The [[Australian Society of Archivists]] is the professional body for archivists, and is responsible for the accreditation of the various University courses.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archivists.org.au/learning-publications/accredited-courses|title=Accredited courses|accessdate=18 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first University to offer archival training was the [[University of New South Wales]], starting in 1973. The course closed in 2000.

Courses are now offered at [[Curtin University]] in [[Western Australia]], [[Charles Sturt University]] in [[New South Wales]], [[Monash University]] in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] and [[University of South Australia]] at undergraduate and postgraduate levels. The course at [[Edith Cowan University]] is being phased out.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Courses are offered in a variety of modes, including online via [[Open University Australia]] and through a combination of online and internal units at the various universities.

===Brazil===
The profession has been regulated since 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/leis/1970-1979/L6546.htm|title=L6546|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many universities in Brazil, such as the University of Brasilian (UnB), the [[Federal University of Santa Catarina]] (UFSC), the [[Federal University of Santa Maria]] (UFSM) and the [[São Paulo State University]] (UNESP) offer the degree in [[archival science]].

===Colombia===
In [[Colombia]], the [[Universidad de La Salle]] offers the degree of Professional in Information Systems, Library and Archival Sciences. It is a vocational training program, within existing legal standards aimed at providing knowledge, skills and abilities required for the design and management of information systems and documentation of various sorts. Its projection for the future is based on the application of new information technologies and communications for the management of information services economically viable. The program was created in 1971.

Other institutions that offers a degree in Archival Science are:
* [[Universidad del Quindío]] – Professional degree: Professional in Information and Documentation, Library and Archival Sciences.
* [[Universidad de Antioquia, Escuela Interamericana de Bibliotecología]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Archival Science.
* [[Universidad Católica de Manizales]] – Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.
* [[Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje]] – SENA – in chain training with the [[Antioquia Institute of Technology|Tecnológico de Antioquia]] Tecnológico de Antioquia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|title=Wayback Machine|website=web.archive.org|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080820042453/http://plataforma.unipamplona.edu.co/tda|archivedate=20 August 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – Technical degree: Professional Technical in Archives, Technological degree: Technologist in Documentation and Archival Science.

===France===
In France, the oldest Archivist School is the ''[[École des chartes]]'', founded in 1821. This prestigious ''[[grande école]]'' (literally, "grand schools) offers a diploma in "Archivist-Paleography" after a three-year curriculum. A part of its alumni pursue a State archivist career after an 18-month formation at the ''[[Institut national du patrimoine]]''. Most positions are reserved for European citizens.

Some universities offer master's degree in Archival Science: [[University of Angers|Angers]], [[University of Caen|Caen]], [[University of Dijon|Dijon]], [[Charles de Gaulle University - Lille III|Lille III]], [[Jean Moulin University Lyon 3|Lyon III]], [[Upper Alsace University|Mulhouse]], [[Versailles Saint-Quentin-en-Yvelines University|Versailles Saint-Quentin]],

===Republic of Ireland===
In the Republic of Ireland, the [[University College Dublin School of History and Archives]] offers a Masters of Arts degree in Archives and Records Management, recognised by the Society of Archivists.

===New Zealand===
[[Victoria University of Wellington]] is the only tertiary institution in [[New Zealand]] provides postgraduate archival courses. Victoria Information Studies qualifications with ARCR endorsement have been recognized by [[Records and Information Management Professionals Australasia]]. Open Polytechnic of New Zealand provides undergraduate archival courses.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, there are currently five full- or part-time postgraduate courses in archives administration or management which are recognised by the [[Archives and Records Association]] (United Kingdom and Ireland). Students are expected to have relevant paid or voluntary [[work experience]] before obtaining a place on the UK courses; many undertake a year's traineeship. Also, professional certification (after qualifying) can be pursued via the Registration Scheme offered by the Archives and Records Association.

===United States===
The most common types of advanced degrees held by archivists are in [[archival science]], [[public history]], history, [[library science]], or [[library and information science]]. It is also possible for archivists to earn a doctorate in library and information science. Archivists with a PhD often work as teaching faculty, deans, or directors of archival programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yakel and Bastian |first=Elizabeth and Jeannette |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Archival Graduate Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=349–366 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/YakelBastian-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Society of American Archivists]] published Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp#_ftn1 |title=Guidelines for a Graduate Program in Archival Studies |accessdate=30 March 2007 |publisher=Society of American Archivists| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406075051/http://www.archivists.org/prof-education/ed_guidelines.asp| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; it also promotes and disseminates a code of ethics,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=SAA Core Values Statement and Code of Ethics |accessdate=2015-09-01|publisher=Society of American Archivists|url=http://www2.archivists.org/statements/saa-core-values-statement-and-code-of-ethics}}&lt;/ref&gt; which has undergone several revisions since it was first adopted in 1980.&lt;ref name=Horn/&gt;

The [[Academy of Certified Archivists]] offers supplemental archival training by means of a certification program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Academy of Certified Archivists|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/|accessdate=31 March 2011| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110317200502/http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/| archivedate= 17 March 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; When first established in 1989, some critics of ACA certification objected to its annual membership fees, the theoretical versus practical nature of its tests, and the need for members to re-certify every five years. However, in the decades since, it has been agreed that such requirements are comparable with certification programs in other professions, and that certification strengthens professional standards and individual competencies. While some positions in archives require certification and many employers view certification as preferred, it is not required by all employers in the United States. Approximately 1,200+ archivists were certified by ACA, {{as of|2016|lc=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.certifiedarchivists.org/about-us/presidents-address-2/|title=2016 President’s Address {{!}} Welcome to the Academy of Certified Archivists|last=Jones|first=Louis|date=|website=www.certifiedarchivists.org|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional organizations and continuing education==
Many archivists belong to a professional organization, such as the [[Society of American Archivists]], the [[Association of Canadian Archivists]], the [[Archives and Records Association]] (UK/Ireland), the [[Colombian College of Archivists - CCA]], and the [[Australian Society of Archivists]], as well as any number of local or regional associations.  These organizations often provide ongoing educational opportunities to their members and other interested practitioners.   In addition to formal degrees and or apprenticeships, many archivists take part in continuing education opportunities as available through professional associations and library school programs. New discoveries in the fields of [[media preservation]] and emerging technologies require continuing education as part of an archivist's job in order to stay current in the profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zimmelman |first=Nancy |date=Fall–Winter 2007 |title=A*Census: Report on Continuing Education |journal=American Archivist |volume=69 |issue=2 |pages=367–395 |url=http://www.archivists.org/a-census/reports/Zimmelman-ACENSUS.pdf| accessdate=4 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of the profession==
The first predecessors of archival science in the West are Jacob von Rammingen's manuals of 1571.&lt;ref&gt;The earliest predecessors of archival science - Jacob von Rammingen's two manuals of registry and archival management, printed in 1571, translated by JBLD Strömberg. Lund: Wallin &amp; Dalholm, Lundaboken, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and Baldassare Bonifacio's ''De Archivis libris singularis'' of 1632.&lt;ref&gt;L. Sandri, 'Il "De Archivis" di Baldassare Bonifacio', ''Notizie delle Archive di Stato'', Roma, 1950, p. 95-111.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1883 French archivist Gabriel Richou published the first Western text on archival theory, entitled ''Traité théorique et pratique des archives publiques'' (''Treaty of Theory and Practice of the Public Archives''), in which he systematized the archival theory of the ''[[respect des fonds]]'', first published by [[Natalis de Wailly]] in 1841.&lt;ref&gt;F. Hildesheimer, "Les Premières publications des Archives", ''Histoires de France, historiens de la France'', Paris, 1994, p. 280-299.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1898, three Dutch archivists, Samuel Muller, Johan Feith, and Robert Fruin, published the ''Handleiding voor het ordenen en beschrijven van archieven'' (''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives''). Produced for the Dutch Association of Archivists, it set out one hundred rules for archivists to base their work around. Notably, within these rules, the principle of preserving [[provenance]] and original order was first argued for as an essential trait of archival arrangement and description.&lt;ref name=Cook1997&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The next major text was the ''Manual of Archive Administration'' published in 1922 by [[Hilary Jenkinson]], then employed at the British [[Public Record Office]]: a revised edition appeared in 1937. In this work, Jenkinson states that archives are evidence and that the moral and physical defence of this evidential value is the central tenet of archival work. He further outlines his ideas of what an archive should be and how it should operate.

In 1956, [[T. R. Schellenberg]], who is known as the "Father of American Archival Appraisal",&lt;ref name=Cook1997/&gt; published ''Modern Archives''. Schellenberg's work was intended to be an academic textbook defining archival methodology and giving archivists specific technical instruction on workflow and arrangement. Moving away from Jenkinson's organic and passive approach to archival acquisition, where the administrator decided what was kept and what was destroyed, Schellenberg argued for a more active approach by archivists to appraisal. His primary (administrative) and secondary (research) value model for the management and appraisal of records and archives allowed government archivists greater control over the influx of material that they faced after the Second World War. As a result of the widespread adoption of Schellenberg's methods, especially in the United States of America, modern [[Records Management]] as a separate but related discipline was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first=Theodore R. | last=Schellenberg | year=1956 | title=Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques | chapter= | editor= | others= | location=Chicago | publisher=University of Chicago Press | id= | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, [[Ernst Posner]] published ''Archives in the Ancient World''.  Posner's work emphasized that archives were not new inventions, but had existed in many different societies throughout recorded history.

In 1975, essays by [[Margaret C. Norton|Margaret Cross Norton]] were collected under the title of ''Norton on Archives: The Writings of Margaret Cross Norton on Archival and Records Management''. Norton was one of the founders of the [[Society of American Archivists]], and wrote essays based on her decades of experience working in the [[Illinois]] State Archives.

==Archives 2.0==

Archivists, like librarians, are taking advantage of [[Web 2.0]] technologies such as blogs, [[wiki]]s, as well as [[Open access (publishing)|open access]] and [[open source]] philosophies. While Archives 2.0 may refer to implementing new technologies, it is also a way of engaging with archives in an effort to promote openness and flexibility of archival materials. This can be achieved through community participation in archives, archivists actively engaging with their collections, and promoting archival benefits in the modern world.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theimer|first=Kate|date=2011|title=What is the Meaning of Archives 2.0?|url=http://americanarchivist.org/doi/10.17723/aarc.74.1.h7tn4m4027407666|journal=The American Archivist|volume=74|pages=58–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kate Theimer writes that in order to understand Archives 2.0, it must be compared against Archives 1.0. She asserts that her representation of Archives 1.0 is by no means exhaustive or fully comprehensive of the breadth of archival experience.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The following is a list of contrasts between 1.0 and 2.0.

* "Open, not closed;
* Transparent, not opaque;
* User centered, not record centered;
* Facilitator, not gatekeeper;
* Attracting new users, not relying on users to find them;
* Shared standards, not localized practice;
* Metrics and measurement, not 'unmeasurable' results;
* Iterative products, not 'perfect' products;
* Innovation and flexibility, not adhering to tradition;
* Technology savvy, not technology phobic;
* Value doing, not knowing;
* Confident about lobbying for resources, not hesitant beggars."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The technological tools of Archives 2.0 provide the foundational platforms to help the change from 1.0 to 2.0. When working in an archives that is dedicated to upholding 2.0 standards, the focus has shifted onto the user experience at an archives:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; community use, or research and reference help.

'''Bias in education''' refers to real or perceived [[bias]] in the [[educational system]].

==Bias in school textbooks==
The content of school textbooks is often the issue of debate, as their target audience is young people, and the term "whitewashing" is the one commonly used to refer to selective removal of critical or damaging evidence or comment.&lt;ref name="7forms"&gt;{{cite web | last = Sadker | first = David  | title = Seven Forms of Bias in Instructional Materials | website = sadker.org | url = http://www.sadker.org/curricularbias.html | accessdate = 3 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Washpost"&gt;{{cite web | last = Strauss | first = Valerie  | title = Proposed Texas textbooks are inaccurate, biased and politicized, new report finds | website = washingtonpost.com | publisher = Washington Post | date = 12 September 2014 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/answer-sheet/wp/2014/09/12/proposed-texas-textbooks-are-inaccurate-biased-and-politicized-new-report-finds/ | accessdate = 3 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whitewashhist"&gt;{{cite web | last = Czitrom | first = Daniel | title = Texas school board whitewashes history | website = cnn.com | publisher = CNN | date = 22 March 2010 | url = http://edition.cnn.com/2010/OPINION/03/18/czitrom.texas.textbooks/ | accessdate = 3 September 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[historical revisionism (political)|reporting of military atrocities in history]] is extremely controversial, as in the case of the [[Holocaust]] (or [[Holocaust denial]]) and the [[Winter Soldier Investigation]] of the [[Vietnam War]].  The representation of every society's flaws or misconduct is typically downplayed in favor of a more nationalist or patriotic view. Also, [[Christian]]s and other religionists have at times attempted to block the teaching of the theory of [[evolution]] in schools, as evolutionary theory appears to contradict their [[religion|religious beliefs]]; the teaching of [[creationism]] as a science is likewise blocked from many public schools.  In the context of secondary-school education, the way facts and history are presented greatly influences the interpretation of contemporary thought, opinion and socialization. One legitimate argument for censoring the type of information disseminated is based on the inappropriate quality of such material for the young. The use of the "inappropriate" distinction is in itself controversial, as it can be used to enforce wider and more politically motivated censorship.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

==Religious bias==

Many countries and states have guidelines against bias in education, but they are not always implemented. The guidelines of the [[California]] Department of Education (Code 60044) state the following: "No [[religious belief]] or practice may be held up to ridicule and no religious group may be portrayed as inferior." "Any explanation or description of a religious belief or practice should be present in a manner that does not encourage or discourage belief or indoctrinate the student in any particular religious belief."&lt;ref&gt;California State Law, Education Code 60044, [http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/socialcontent.pdf Standards for Evaluating Instructional Materials for Social Content, 2000 Edition] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209090548/http://www.cde.ca.gov/ci/cr/cf/documents/socialcontent.pdf |date=February 9, 2014 }}. Retrieved on 15 June 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

On the basis of these guidelines, the Board of Education of [[California]] corrected in 2005 misrepresentations of [[Judaism]], [[Islam]] and [[Hinduism]] in schoolbooks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cde.ca.gov/be/ag/ag/yr05/documents/bluenov05item05.doc]&lt;/ref&gt; Many of these misrepresentations were described as biased, erroneuous or culturally derogatory. All 500  changes proposed by Jews and about 100 changes proposed by Muslims were accepted.

==By country or region==
{{expand section|date=April 2018}}

===United States===

Many recent allegations against the United States have surfaced about the hiding of many historical facts from the public through public education and thus luring the public to believing that the actions taken by the U.S. government are justified and provide a global benefit.{{Citation needed|date=December 2017}}

On the political left, professors [[Howard Zinn]] and [[James Loewen]] allege that United States history as presented in school textbooks has a conservative bias.  ''[[A People's History of the United States]]'', by American historian and political scientist Zinn, seeks to present American history through the eyes of groups rarely heard in mainstream histories.  Loewen spent two years at the Smithsonian Institution studying and comparing twelve American history textbooks widely used throughout the United States. His findings were published in ''[[Lies My Teacher Told Me|Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your High School History Textbook Got Wrong]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?155006-1/peoples-history-united-states|title=People's History United States, Jan 26 2000 - Video - C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the political right, professor [[Larry Schweikart]] makes the opposite case: he alleges in his ''48 Liberal Lies About American History'' that United States history education has a liberal bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.c-span.org/video/?281756-1/48-liberal-lies-american-history|title=48 Liberal Lies American History, Sep 23 2008 - Video - C-SPAN.org|website=C-SPAN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a landmark book called "The Trouble with Textbooks," Dr. Gary A. Tobin and Dennis R. Ybarra show how some American textbooks contain anti-Semitic versions of Jewish history and faith, particularly in relation to Christianity and Islam. The authors found that some U.S. textbooks "tend to discredit the ties between Jews and the Land of Israel. Israel is blamed for starting wars in the region and being colonialist. Jews are charged with deicide in the killing of Jesus. All in all, there are repeated misrepresentations that cross the line into bigotry."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/127797|title=U.S. Textbooks: ‘Jesus was Palestinian’|website=Israel National News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===
Palestinian school text books have come under repeated criticism for anti-Israeli bias.  An independent study of Palestinian textbooks by Professor [[Nathan J. Brown (political scientist)|Nathan Brown]] of George Washington University in Washington, DC, found that [[Palestinian National Authority|Palestine National Authority]]-authored books avoid treating anything controversial regarding Palestinian national identity, and while highly nationalistic, do not incite hatred, violence and anti-Semitism.

An analysis of Israeli textbooks in 2000 by the [[Center for Monitoring the Impact of Peace]] (CMIP), found that there was no indoctrination against the Arabs as a nation, nor a negative presentation of Islam. However in 2012, [[Nurit Peled-Elhanan]], a professor of language and education at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], published ''Palestine in Israeli School Books: Ideology and Propaganda in Education'', an account of her study of the contents of Israeli school books finding that Israeli school books do in fact promote [[racism]] against and negative images of Arabs, and prepare Israelis children for compulsory military service.

===South Asia===

====India====

In 1982 the [[NCERT]] (National Council of Educational Research and Training) issued guidelines for the rewriting of schoolbooks.&lt;ref&gt;(Indian Express 17 January 1982, New Delhi; Shourie 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; It stipulated that: "Characterization of the medieval period as a time of conflict between Hindus and Muslims is forbidden."&lt;ref&gt;(Elst 1992)&lt;/ref&gt;
In April 1989 the [[West Bengal]] Board of Secondary Education had issued instructions to schools and publishers of textbooks that "Muslim rule should never attract any [[criticism]]. Destruction of [[temple]]s by Muslim rulers and invaders should not be mentioned."&lt;ref&gt;(Shourie 1998)&lt;/ref&gt; Schools and publishers have been asked to ignore and delete mention of forcible conversions to Islam. Some academicians have felt that these "corrections" were politically motivated and that they are censorship.&lt;ref&gt;(The Statesman, 21 May 1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Arun Shourie]] criticized these changes in schoolbooks and claimed: ''The most extensive deletions are ordered in regard to the chapter on "[[Aurangzeb]]'s policy on religion". Every allusion to what he actually did to the Hindus, to their temples, to the very leitmotif of his rule – to spread the sway of Islam – are directed to be excised from the book. ... "In a word, no forcible conversions, no [[massacres]], no [[:wikt:destruction|destruction]] of temples. ... Muslim historians of those times are in raptures at the heap of Kafirs [sic] who have been dispatched to hell. Muslim historians are forever lavishing praise on the ruler for the temples he has destroyed, ... Law books like The Hedaya prescribe exactly the options to which these little textbooks alluded. All whitewashed away. Objective [[whitewash]] for objective history. And today if anyone seeks to restore truth to these textbooks, the shout, "Communal rewriting of history.""''&lt;ref&gt;Arun Shourie (1998)&lt;/ref&gt;

History textbooks and schoolbooks written by Marxist historian [[Romila Thapar]] have been criticized for being biased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiastar.com/venkat1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100814212337/http://www.indiastar.com/venkat1.html |archivedate=2010-08-14 |df= }} {{cite web |url=http://www.voiceofdharma.com/indology/thaparreview1.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206181508/http://www.voiceofdharma.com/indology/thaparreview1.html |archivedate=2012-02-06 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://hindureview.com/2014/02/20/critique-wendy-donigers-hindus-alternative-history/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pakistan====

Bias in education has been a common feature in the curriculum of many [[South Asia]]n countries. According to Waghmar, many of the [[oriental]] societies are plagued by visceral nationalism and post-imperial neurosis where state-sanctioned dogmas suppress eclectic historical readings.&lt;ref name="waghmar"&gt;Waghmar, B. (2005). ''[https://archive.is/20130121114423/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/050227/books4.htm Pakistan Studies: The State of the Craft]''. [[Dawn (newspaper)|Dawn]]. 27 February. p. 5. Retrieved on 9 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Issues such as the preaching of hatred and obscurantism and the distortion of history in [[Pakistan]] have led the international scholars to suggest the need for coordinated efforts amongst the historians to produce a composite history of the [[subcontinent]] as a common [[South Asia]]n reader.&lt;ref&gt;Verghese, B.G. (2004). ''[http://www.hinduonnet.com/2004/06/23/stories/2004062301721000.htm Myth and hate as history]''. [[The Hindu]]. 23 June. Retrieved on 7 June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Bias against Indians and [[Hindus]], as well as other religious minorities, have been found in Pakistani schoolbooks.&lt;ref name="Vali Nasr"&gt;Seyyed Vali Reza Nasr, The Vanguard of the Islamic Revolution: The Jama`at-i Islami of Pakistan (University of California Press, 1994) p121-122&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nelson here stresses the need for any [[Education reform|educational reform]] to be based at the needs of the level of local communities.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, M.J. (2006). [http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/pdf/10.1525/as.2006.46.5.699?cookieSet=1 Muslims, Markets, and the Meaning of ‘A Good Education’ in Pakistan]. ''Asian Survey''. 46(5). pp. 699-720.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bias in Pakistani textbooks was studied by Rubina Saigol, Pervez Hoodbhoy, K. K. Aziz, I. A. Rahman, Mubarak Ali, A. H. Nayyar, Ahmed Saleem, [[Yvette Rosser]] and others.

A study by Nayyar &amp; Salim (2003) that was conducted with 30 experts of Pakistan's education system, found that the textbooks contain statements that seek to create hate against Hindus. There was also an emphasis on [[Jihad]], Shahadat, wars and military heroes. The study reported that the textbooks also had a lot of gender-biased stereotypes. Some of the problems in Pakistani textbooks cited in the report were: ''"Insensitivity to the existing religious diversity of the nation"; "Incitement to militancy and violence, including encouragement of Jehad and Shahadat"; a "glorification of war and the use of force"; "Inaccuracies of fact and omissions that serve to substantially distort the nature and significance of actual events in our history"; "Perspectives that encourage [[prejudice]], [[bigotry]] and [[discrimination]] towards fellow citizens, especially women and religious minorities, and other towards nations" and "Omission of concepts ... that could encourage critical selfawareness among students".''&lt;ref&gt;(Nayyar &amp; Salim 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

These problems still seem to persist: The Curriculum Wing of the Federal Ministry of Education rejected a textbook in December 2003 because of two serious objections: The textbook contained the text of letter of a non-Muslim, and it contained the story of a family were both husband and wife worked and were sharing their household chores. In February 2004, a textbook was disapproved by the Curriculum Wing because it didn't contain enough material on jihad.&lt;ref&gt;(Nayyar 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani textbooks were relatively unbiased up to 1972, but were rewritten and completely altered under Bhutto's and especially under Zia's (1977–88) rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://in.news.yahoo.com/031122/43/29ozt.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115095656/http://in.news.yahoo.com/031122/43/29ozt.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=15 January 2006|title='Pakistani social studies textbooks creating havoc'|date=15 January 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bias in [[Pakistan]]i textbooks was also documented by [[Yvette Rosser]] (2003). She wrote that  "in the past few decades, social studies textbooks in Pakistan have been used as locations to articulate the hatred that Pakistani policy makers have attempted to inculcate towards their [[Hindu]] neighbours",  and that as a result "in the minds of generations of Pakistanis, indoctrinated by the 'Ideology of Pakistan' are lodged fragments of hatred and suspicion."&lt;ref&gt;(Rosser 2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

Professors who have been critical of Pakistani politics or corruption have are sometimes discriminated against. Dr. Parvez Hoodbhoy, who was also a critic of Pakistani politics, had troubles leaving the country for a lecture in the Physics department at [[MIT]], because he was denied a ''NOC (No Objection Certificate)'' necessary for travels abroad.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120217041127/http://www.pakistan-facts.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20030403171005709]&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the omissions in Pakistani textbooks is [[Operation Gibraltar]]. Operation Gibraltar, which provoked the Indian Army attack on [[Lahore]], is not mentioned in most history textbooks. According to Pakistani textbooks, Lahore was attacked without any provocation on the part of the Pakistani army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pakistan-facts.com/staticpages/index.php?page%3D20030403171005709 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120217041127/http://www.pakistan-facts.com/staticpages/index.php?page=20030403171005709 |archivedate=2012-02-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rule of Islamic invaders like Mahmud of Gahzni is glorified, while the much more peaceful Islamic ruler [[Akbar]] is often ignored in Pakistani textbooks.

The Pakistani Curriculum document for classes K-V stated in 1995 that "at the completion of Class-V, the child should be able to":
* "Acknowledge and identify forces that may be working against Pakistan."[pg 154]
* "Demonstrate by actions a belief in the fear of Allah." [pg154]
* "Make speeches on Jehad and Shahadat" [pg154]
* "Understand Hindu-Muslim differences and the resultant need for Pakistan." [pg154]
* "India's evil designs against Pakistan." [pg154]
* "Be safe from rumour mongers who spread false news" [pg158]
* "Visit police stations" [pg158]
* "Collect pictures of policemen, soldiers, and National Guards" [pg158]
* "Demonstrate respect for the leaders of Pakistan" [pg153]&lt;ref&gt;(National Bureau of Curriculum and Textbooks Federal Ministry of Education, 1995 Government of Pakistan.

==Definition==
[[Peter Wade]] argues that blanqueamiento is a historical process that can be linked to nationalism. When thinking about nationalism, the ideologies behind it stem from national identity, which according to Wade is "a construction of the past and the future",&lt;ref name=Wade&gt;Wade,Peter. (1993) Blackness and Race Mixture: The Dynamics of Racial Identity in Colombia. Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. Series in Atlantic History and Culture&lt;/ref&gt; where the past is understood as being more traditional and backwards. For example, past demographics of [[Puerto Rico]] were heavily black and Indian-influenced because the country partook in the slave trade and was simultaneously home to many indigenous groups. Therefore, understanding blanqueamiento as it relates to modernization, modernization is then understood as a guidance in the direction away from black and indigenous roots. Modernization then happened as described by Wade as "the increasing integration of blacks and Indians into modern society, where they will mix in and eventually disappear, taking their primitive culture with them".&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; This kind of implementation of blanqueamiento takes place in a societies that have historically always been led by 'white' people whose guidance would carry "the country away from its past, which began in Indianness and slavery"&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; with hopes of promoting the intermixing of bodies to develop a predominantly white-skinned society.

==As related to mestizaje==
The formation of [[mestizaje]] emerged in the shift of Latin America towards multiculturalist perspectives and policies.&lt;ref name=Chavez&gt;Chavez, M., and M. Zambrano. (2006) From blanqueamiento to reindigenizacion: Paradoxes of mestizaje and multiculturalism in contemporary Colombia. European Review of Latin American and Caribbean Studies, 80, 5-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Mestizaje has been considered problematic by many U.S. scholars because it sustains racial hierarchies and celebrates blanqueamiento.&lt;ref name=Chavez/&gt; For example, Swanson argues that although mestizaje is not a physical embodiment of whitening, it is "not so much about mixing, as it about a progressive whitening of the population".&lt;ref name=Swanson&gt;{{cite journal|author=Swanson, K.|year=2007|title=Revanchist Urbanism Heads South: The Regulation of Indigenous Beggers and Street Vendors in Ecuador|journal=Antipode|volume=39|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00548.x/abstract|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8330.2007.00548.x|pages=708–728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another possibility when considering mestizaje as it relates to blanqueamiento is by understanding mestizaje as a concept that encourages mixedness, but differs from the concept of blanqueamiento on the basis of the end goal for mestizaje. As Peter Wade states, "it celebrates the idea of difference in a democratic, non-hierarchical form. Rather than envisioning a gradual whitening, it holds up the general image of the [[mestizo]] in which racial, regional, and even class differences are submerged into a common identification with mixedness."&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; On the same coin, when thinking about blanqueamiento, the future goal takes up the same theme of mixing. The difference between them is that while mestizaje glorifies the mixing of all people to reach an end goal of having a brown population, blanqueamiento has the end goal of whiteness. The outcome of mestizaje mixing would lead to "the predominance of the mestizo" and is not "construed necessarily as (a) whitened mestizo".&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt; Most importantly, both of these ideologies link emerging nationhood with the predominance of the mestizo or the whitened population.

==National policy==
Blanqueamiento was enacted in national policies of many Latin American countries at the turn of the 20th century. In most cases, these policies promoted European immigration as a means to whiten the population.&lt;ref name=Andrews&gt;Andrews, G.R. Afro-Latin America 1800-2000. New York: Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Brazil ===
{{main|Racial whitening}}
Blanqueamiento ("branqueamento" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]) was circulated in national policy throughout [[Brazil]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=Agier&gt;{{cite book|author=Agier, M|title=Racism, Culture, and Black Identity in Brazil|publisher=Bulletin of Latin American Research|volume=14|number=3 |year=1995|pages= 245–264}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Telles&gt;{{cite book|author=Telles, E.E.|title=Race in Another America: The Significance of Skin Color in Brazil| location=Princeton, NJ/Oxford|publisher=Princeton University Press|year=2006|page=324|ISBN=9780691127927|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blanqueamiento policies emerged in the aftermath of the [[Slavery_in_Brazil#The_end_of_slavery|abolition of slavery]] and the beginning of Brazil's first republic (1888–1889). To dilute the black ''race'', Brazil executed public measures to increase European immigration,&lt;ref name=Agier/&gt;&lt;ref name=Oliveira/&gt; where more than 1 million Europeans arrived in [[São Paulo]] between 1890 and 1914.&lt;ref name=Lima/&gt; The state and [[Federal government of Brazil|federal government]] funded and subsidized immigrant travels,&lt;ref name=Oliveira/&gt; where immigrants arrived from Portugal, Spain, Italy, Russia, Germany, Austria, France and the Netherlands.&lt;ref name=Loveman&gt;{{cite journal|author=Loveman, M|title=The Race to Progress: Census Taking and Nation Making in Brazil (1870-1920)|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=89|issue=3|year=2009|doi=10.1215/00182168-2009-002|pages=435–470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that white blood would eventually eliminate black blood were found in accounts of immigration statistics.&lt;ref name=Loveman/&gt; Created in the late 19th century, Brazil's Directoria Geral de Estatistica (DGE) has conducted demographic censuses and managed to measure the progress of whitening as successful in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Loveman/&gt;

=== Cuba ===
At the beginning of the 20th century, the [[Cuba|Cuban]] government created immigration laws that invested more than $1 million into recruiting Europeans into Cuba to whiten the state.&lt;ref name=Cuba&gt;{{cite episode|title=Cuba: The next revolution |medium=Web series episode| year=2011|series=In Black in Latin America|network=Public Broadcasting Service|url=http://video.pbs.org/video/1898347038/}}&lt;/ref&gt; High participation of blacks in independence movements threatened white elitist power and when the 1899 census showed that more than {{frac|1|3}} of Cuba's population was colored, white migration started to gain support.&lt;ref name=delaFuente&gt;{{cite journal|author=de la Fuente, A.|title=Race, National Discourse, Politics in Cuba: An Overview|journal=Latin American Perspectives|volume=25|number=3|year=1998|pages=43–69|doi=10.1177/0094582x9802500303|jstor=2634166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Political blanqueamiento began in 1902 after the [[United States Military Government in Cuba|U.S. occupation]], where migration of "undesirables" (i.e. blacks) became prohibited in Cuba.&lt;ref name=Chomsky/&gt; Immigration policies supported the migration of entire families. Between 1902 and 1907, nearly 128,000 [[Spaniards]] entered Cuba, and officially in 1906, Cuba created its immigration law that funded white migrants.&lt;ref name=Chomsky/&gt; However, many European immigrants did not stay in Cuba and came solely for the sugar harvest, returning to their homes during the off seasons. Although some 780,000 Spaniards migrated between 1902–1931, only 250,000 stayed. By the 1920s, blanqueamiento through national policy had effectively failed.&lt;ref name=delaFuente/&gt;

==Social==
Social blanqueamiento happens in many Latin American countries and can take the form of ethnic self-identification. For example, when examining the Puerto Rican census and the different ethnic categories of the population, the self-categorization of 'white' became an increasing social trend despite the rich Puerto Rican history of slave trade during the 1800s. Due to the slave trade and the intermixing of bodies, the phenotypic composition of the population in Puerto Rico was dramatically impacted. "One consequence of the increase of African Slaves was a change in the racial composition of the population. The largest proportion (55.6%) of people "of Color" was recorded in 1820 and was subsequently reduced. In 1864 52.4% of the population was "white".&lt;ref name="Duany2"&gt;[http://www.prdream.com/wordpress/2010/05/whitening-blanqueamiento/] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then as the census continued through the decades, the dramatic decrease of non-white categories became a trend. "The category of "white" remained intact and the percentage of the population it accounted for increased from 61.8% in 1899 to 80.5% in 2000. At the same time, the proportion of people classified as "nonwhite" fell from 38.2% to 19%.&lt;ref name=Duany2/&gt; The last decade has seen a move towards multiculturalism and away from blanquamiento,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1006599/blanqueamiento|title = Race and Social Division in Latin America|website = Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate = 7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is reflected in the 2010 census reporting the white population declining to 75.8%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www2.census.gov/geo/maps/dc10_thematic/2010_Profile/2010_Profile_Map_Puerto_Rico.pdf|title = 2010 Census: Puerto Rico Profile|publisher = U.S. Department of Commerce Economics and Statistics Administration U.S. CENSUS BUREAU|year = 2011|accessdate = 7 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanqueamiento is also associated with food consumption. For example, in [[Osorno, Chile|Osorno]], a Chilean city with a strong [[German colonization of Valdivia, Osorno and Llanquihue|German heritage]], consumption of desserts, marmelades and [[kuchen]]s whitens the inhabitants of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montecino |first=Sonia |date=2009 |title=Conjunciones y disyunciones del gusto en el sur de Chile |url=http://repositorio.uchile.cl/bitstream/handle/2250/121774/Montecino_RI_003_2010.pdf?sequence=1 |journal=historia, Antropología y Fuentes Orales |publisher= |volume= |issue= |pages=169–176 |doi= |language=Spanish |access-date=2 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic==
Blanqueamiento can also be accomplished through economic achievement. Many scholars have argued that money has the ability to whiten, where wealthier individuals are more likely to be classified as white, regardless of phenotypic appearance.&lt;ref name=Wade/&gt;&lt;ref name=Duany1&gt;{{cite book|author=Duany, J.|title=Neither Black nor White: The Politics of Race and Ethnicity among Puerto Ricans on the Island and in the U.S. Mainland|publisher=Brown University|location=Providence, Rhode Island|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Deglar&gt;{{cite book|author=Degler, C.N. |title=Neither Black nor White: Slavery and Race Relations in Brazil and the United States|location=New York|publisher=Macmillan|year=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is by this changing of social status that blacks achieve blanqueamiento.&lt;ref name=Golash-Boza&gt;{{cite journal|author=Golash-Boza, T.|title=Does Whitening Happen? Distinguishing between Race and Color Labels in an African Descended Community in Peru|journal=Social Problems |volume=57|issue=1|year=2010|pages=138–156|doi=10.1525/sp.2010.57.1.138}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his study, Marcus Eugenio Oliveira Lima showed that groups of Brazilians succeeded more when whitened.&lt;ref name=Lima&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lima, M.E.O.|title=Review Essay: Race Relations and Racism in Brazil|journal=Culture and Psychology|volume=13|issue=4|year=2007|pages=461–473|doi=10.1177/1354067X07082805}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Blanqueamiento has also been seen as a way to better the economy. In the case of Brazil, immigration policies that would help whiten the nation were seen as progressive ways to modernize and achieve capitalism.&lt;ref name=Oliveira&gt;{{cite journal|author=Jones-de Oliveira, K.F.|title=The Politics of Culture or the Culture of Politics: Afro-Brazilian Mobilization, 1920-1968|journal=Journal of Third World Studies|volume=20|issue=1|year=2003|pages=103–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Cuba, blanqueamiento policies limited economic opportunities for African descendants, resulting in their reduced upward mobility in education, property, and employment sectors.&lt;ref name=Chomsky&gt;{{cite journal|author=Chomsky, A. |title='Barbados or Canada?' Race, Immigration, and Nation in Early-Twentieth-Century Cuba|journal=Hispanic American Historical Review|volume=80|issue=3|year=2000|pages=415–462|doi=10.1215/00182168-80-3-415}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''City Under the Sea''''' (released as '''''War-Gods of the Deep''''' in the US)&lt;ref name=Malcolm&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bkeiwEZI4-cC&amp;pg=PA121#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Women in the Horror Films of Vincent Price|page=121|author= Jonathan Malcolm Lampley |publisher=McFarland|date= 3 Sep 2010 |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a 1965 [[science fiction film]]. It was directed by [[Jacques Tourneur]] (his final film) and starred [[Vincent Price]], [[Tab Hunter]], [[Susan Hart]] and [[David Tomlinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0059895/ |title=The City Under the Sea (1965) – IMDb  |work=IMDb.com  |accessdate=30 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plot concerns the discovery of a lost city beneath the sea off the coast of [[Cornwall]]. Price is the captain overseeing a group of sailors who have lived there for more than a century where the peculiar mix of gases has allowed them to extend their lifespan.

The film was made in the tradition of the period fantasies started with [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s ''[[20,000 Leagues Under the Sea (1954 film)|20,000 Leagues Under the Sea]]'' (1954). The film attempted to capitalize on the series of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] films that had been made by [[Roger Corman]], starring Price. To this extent the film took the title of a Poe poem, "[[The City in the Sea]]", and attempted to exploit the Poe films' trend, even though the plot is only loosely based on the poem, with a recitation of the poem at the end of the film.&lt;ref name=Malcolm/&gt;

==Plot==
Around the turn of the century, American mining engineer Ben Harris is working on the Cornish coast in England when he finds a body washed up on the beach.

Ben makes inquiries at the nearby hotel. While talking to the hotelier's daughter, fellow American Jill Tregellis, and an eccentric artist, Harold Tufnell-Jones, a mysterious intruder appears but disappears.

Later that night Jill is kidnapped by gill men. Ben, Harold and Harold's chicken follow the trail through a secret door into the caves under the house where they are sucked into a pool.

They emerge in a cavernous city on the ocean floor. The city was built by a race of ancients who survive only as a breed of gill men. The city is now inhabited by a group of smugglers led by the cruel and tyrannical Captain who hid down there in 1803 and due to the strange mixture of oxygen have not aged in over a century. However, the volcano that powers the city has become unstable. The Captain now imprisons them until Ben can come up with a means of maintaining it.

Dan, one of the Captain's men who wishes to leave, offers to help the two escape, provided they use their influence to secure him a full pardon for his past crimes of smuggling. The Captain finds out and reveals that because of the gas they've breathed for so long, exposure to sunlight would cause them to age rapidly and die. Dan is then sent to the surface as a means of execution while Ben and Harold are granted an audience with Jill. Whereupon they meet Rev. Jonathan Ives, who had vanished several decades ago from the surface.

The Captain it is shown is under the delusion that Jill is his deceased wife Beatrice, who he believes has returned to him.

Realising though that Ben and Harold are untrustworthy, the Captain decides to allow the Gill Men to sacrifice the two as a means to appease the volcano's wrath. While they await this, Jill and Ives free them and Ives instructs them all on how to escape the city. The three make it to the airlock and trek across the ocean floor to a cave, containing a tunnel that leads to the surface.

The Captain and his men pursue them there, but frequent volcanic eruptions cause rockfalls that bury him and his men. Ben and his friends decide to return to the sea and attempt to reach shore on foot. The Captain meanwhile digs himself free and follows the tunnel to the surface, where the sunlight does indeed age him to death.

Ben and the rest make it to shore and watch as the volcano erupts, finally destroying the city.

==Production==
Shooting took place in the United Kingdom. Charles Bennett says he wrote a good script and AIP wanted him to come to Britain to work on the script but would not pay his way. The script was rewritten in Britain by Louis M Heyward. Bennett hated the changes and called the resulting film "the worst thing I was ever involved in."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=esCnTSqGtUYC&amp;pg=PA17&amp;source=gbs_toc_r&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Tom Weaver ''Double Feature Creature Attack: A Monster Merger of Two More Volumes of Classic Interviews'' McFarland, 2003 p 23] accessed 18 April 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Susan Hart]], Charles Bennett's original script was good but was heavily rewritten. She also says there was tension between the producers, Dan Haller and his British counterpart George Willoughby.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Weaver, "Susan Hart", ''Double Feature Creature Attack: A Monster Merger of Two More Volumes of Classic Interviews'', p 137&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis M. Heyward]] confirms this tension and admits to rewriting the script to add humour; in particular, he says he added the comic chicken and introduced the character played by David Tomlinson. Heyward says that Willoughby quit after these changes.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Weaver, Michael Brunas, John Brunas, "Louis M.

==Reception==
The film was released in New York on a double bill with ''[[Beach Blanket Bingo]]''. ''New York Times'' thought it was the better of the two movies, calling it "a briny safari".&lt;ref&gt;Off the Deep End

[[File:Dance marathon, 1923.jpg|right|thumb|Marathon dancing, 1923]]
'''Dance marathons''' are events in which people dance or walk to music for an extended period of time. They started as dance contests in the 1920s and developed into entertainment events during the [[Great Depression]] in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.pantagraph.com/news/local/pfop-dance-marathons-walkathons-once-talk-of-the-town/article_7cc11c8c-a911-5262-bc4e-e992fe8e4a25.html |title= Dance marathons, walkathons once talk of the town |newspaper= [[The Pantagraph]] |date= 2016-03-13 |accessdate= 2016-04-11 |last= Kemp |first= Bill}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the development of "reality shows", dance marathons blurred the line between theatre and reality. Also known as endurance contests, dance marathons attracted people to compete as a way to achieve fame or win monetary prizes.&lt;ref&gt;Camus, Renee.

Dance marathons became popular in the United States during the Great Depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Sonny Watson |url=http://www.streetswing.com/histmain/d5marthn.htm |title=Dance Marathons - aka Continuos Motion Derbies and Pageants of fatique Main1 |website=Streetswing.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of dance marathons began in 1923 when a woman named Alma Cummings danced continuously for 27 hours with six different partners. After Cummings established her record, dance marathons became common in the United States. Initially, participants competed in order to break Cummings's record, but later on people began to compete to win prizes,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|last=Solis |first=Kimberly |url=http://dance.lovetoknow.com/Dance_Marathons |title=Dance Marathons |website=Dance.lovetoknow.com |date=2008-12-29 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which could range from money to publicity.&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;“Dance Marathon” Sonny Watson’s StreetSwing.com. January 1, 2013. Accessed April 8,2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dance marathons were a huge hit during the Great Depression as they provided contestants and spectators food, shelter and the opportunity to earn cash prizes, at a time when many people needed a meal and free entertainment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The dances were popular at this time  not only because these events supplied  basic human needs to both the contestants and audience, but are also popular due to the sadistic pleasure, or power the audience felt through watching the contestants compete in the grueling event.&lt;ref name="history link" /&gt;

The depression era marathons faded in the public's enthusiasm in the late 1930s due to increased municipal ordinances and the decreased number of towns where the seamier side of the promotions were unknown. The improving economic conditions and the American entry into World War II also contributed to their demise.&lt;ref name="history link" /&gt;

== Rules ==
Rules vary widely, but one common rule of the marathon stated that the participants could not fall asleep, although some marathons would allow one part of the team to sleep as long as their teammates continued dancing. It was important for the team to keep moving because if they stopped, they would be disqualified from the contest.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Contestants were only allowed to leave the dance floor for hygienic or medical purposes, to change clothing, or for other similar circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;Farrel, James. "The dance marathons." Melus 18, no. 1 (Spring93 1993): 133. Academic Search Complete, EBSCOhost (accessed March 22, 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; A mixture of other elements were incorporated in the marathons including elimination sprints, raffles, mud wrestling and fake weddings of competitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/stage/2017/aug/04/bop-till-you-drop-americas-dance-marathons-no-miracles-here-edinburgh-festival | title=Bop till you drop: The staggering true stories behind America's dance marathons| newspaper=The Guardian| date=2017-08-04| last1=Winship| first1=Lyndsey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, the type of music played at a dance marathon changed throughout the duration of it. It consisted of a mix of slow and upbeat music to give the contestants breaks and also keep them going and energized.&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; Spectators were allowed to come in and watch the marathon and the contestants competing. Often, viewers were able to pay 25 cents to watch the marathon for as long as they wished.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Opposing groups ==
Although many people supported marathons because they were sources of entertainment, there were outside groups that opposed the marathons. Some external groups did not like what the marathons were doing to participants. Movie theater owners, church groups, and women's groups were among those that opposed the marathons.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; Movie theatre owners were unhappy because people were paying to watch the marathons instead of attending films. Churches were unhappy with the way that the contestants danced with each other as it was not socially acceptable during the time period. Women's groups were upset because they thought it was unethical to charge spectators to watch dancers humiliate themselves.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

In 1928, Seattle passed an ordinance prohibiting dance marathons within city limits when a woman attempted suicide after competing in a 19-day marathon and receiving 5th place.&lt;ref name="history link"&gt;{{cite web|author=Becker, Paula|title=Dance Marathons of the 1920s and 1920s|website=HistoryLink.org|date=August 25, 2003|accessdate=March 22, 2015|url=http://historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=5534}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other states followed Seattle's precedent shortly after. Although marathons were extremely popular, they were also dangerous. During a marathon in the 1920s, a man named Homer Morehouse was the first contestant to dance in the marathon, but after dancing for 87 hours, he collapsed from exhaustion and died on the dance floor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mandatory.com/2013/01/10/10-fads-that-killed-people/4 |title=10 Fads That Killed People - CraveOnline |website=Mandatory.com |date=2013-01-10 |accessdate=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Charity dance marathons==
Today, over 250 colleges and high schools nationwide participate in dance marathons of some sort to raise money for children's hospitals. Some raise money under the Children's Miracle Network and with their help, while others are entirely student-run and operate to benefit partnered charities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dancemarathon.com/AboutUs |title=ABC's of Dance Marathon |accessdate=2014-06-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731053926/http://dancemarathon.com/AboutUs |archivedate=2014-07-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year, students organize and host different types of dance marathon events in which participants stand on their feet for 12–46 hours straight.

==Plot==
{{See also|List of Darker than Black characters}}
Ten years ago, a mysterious spatial anomaly now known as "Heaven's Gate" appeared in South America, shortly followed by the opening of "Hell's Gate" in Tokyo altering the sky and wreaking havoc on the landscape. The real stars disappeared, replaced by false stars. During this time, people possessing various special abilities—called "Contractors"—emerged, each capable of different supernatural feats. Each Contractor has a corresponding fake star, which reacts to their activities. As such, Contractors are usually identified by their star's [[List of Messier objects|Messier]] catalogue number. Kept secret from the masses, these individuals are known to murder in cold blood, smothering unnecessary emotions with logic and rationality. Their incredible abilities, however, are gained at the cost of their humanity; Contractors are thus named because of an involuntary compulsion to "pay the price" each time their power is used, which can range from eating particular foods or completing meaningless tasks, to self-harm and change their bodies in peculiar ways. Various nations and organizations around the world train and utilize Contractors as spies and assassins, resulting in violent battles for valuable objects and information.

Following the disastrous Heaven's War, the United States lost its dominant position as a superpower to a mysterious organization named the Syndicate. The story revolves around a Chinese contractor codenamed "Hei" as he undertakes various espionage and assassination missions in Tokyo under the direction of the aforementioned Syndicate. It eventually reveals a plan of the Syndicate to erase the existence of contractors, and a resistance put up by contractors from the Syndicate itself and various espionage agencies.

''[[Despicable Me Minion Mayhem]]'' is a [[simulator ride]] that opened on July 2, 2012 at [[Universal Studios Florida]] and on April 12, 2014 at [[Universal Studios Hollywood]], starring [[Steve Carell]] as Gru, [[Miranda Cosgrove]] as Margo, [[Dana Gaier]] as Edith, [[Elsie Fisher]] as Agnes, and [[Pierre Coffin]] as the [[Minions (Despicable Me)|Minions]].  A similar attraction (featuring a Japanese voice cast) opened on April 21, 2017 at [[Universal Studios Japan]].

==Characters==

===Main characters===
*Gru (voiced by [[Steve Carell]]): The [[protagonist]] in the ''Despicable Me'' series who is also the adoptive father of Margo, Edith, and Agnes, the husband of Lucy, and the boss of the Minions. At the beginning of the [[Despicable Me|original film]], Gru is an ambitious supervillain, and seeks approval from his mother, until the adoption of three little girls awakens his father love. In the [[Despicable Me 2|second film]], Gru leaves his villainous past behind to care for the girls, but then soon joins forces with a secret agent Lucy Wilde, whom he later marries. In the [[Despicable Me 3|third film]], after the couple are fired from their jobs at the Anti-Villain League, Gru learns that he has a twin brother, Dru. Along with Lucy and the girls, Gru meets Dru at his mansion in Freedonia, and they form a brotherly relationship over the course of the film. Gru was originally conceived as a [[Count Dracula|Dracula]]-like character, but directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin later opted for a villain who would echo "the world of [[James Bond]], thinking of characters like [[Auric Goldfinger|Goldfinger]] and obviously the Bond-ian world of technology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cartoonbrew.com/award-season-focus/directors-chris-renaud-and-pierre-coffin-on-creative-choices-and-challenges-in-despicable-me-films-93702.html Directors Chris Renaud and Pierre Coffin on Creative Choices and Challenges in “Despicable Me” Films], cartoonbrew.com, 1 October 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Gru also bears some similarities with British comic-book character [[Grimly Feendish]], and with the pre-[[Crisis on Infinite Earths|Crisis]] version of [[Lex Luthor]].&lt;ref name="empire"&gt;[http://www.empireonline.com/movies/despicable/review/ Despicable Me Review], ''Empire'', 1 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

*Girls: Three sisters, whom Gru adopts to further his scheme in the first film and gradually comes to love.
**Margo (voiced by [[Miranda Cosgrove]]): The oldest sister. In the first film, among the trio, Margo was the most suspicious of Gru initially; but came to trust him at the end of the film. She is something of a protectress to her sisters.
**Edith (voiced by [[Dana Gaier]]): The [[tomboy]]ish middle sister; the first to enjoy Gru's eclectic possessions, when adopted by him. Practices [[martial arts]] in the second film.
**Agnes (voiced by [[Elsie Fisher]] in the first two films; Nev Scharrel in the third film): The happy-go-lucky youngest sister, and the quickest to trust Gru in the first film. She is presented as an innocent, against her more worldly sisters, and has a strong love for unicorns. In the third film, she "adopts" a one-horned goat whom she names Lucky after mistaking him for a unicorn. Even after learning he was a goat, Agnes continues to love Lucky.
*Lucy Wilde (voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]):  A cunning secret agent who has teamed up with Gru to hunt down an extremely dangerous super-villain. She loves one-upping Gru with her quirky gadgets and has perfected her own form of martial arts by combining [[jujitsu]], [[krav maga]], [[Aztec warfare]] and [[krumping]]. After 147 dates, she marries Gru and becomes the girls' mother.
*Dr. Nefario (voiced by [[Russell Brand]], JB Blanc in the video game): Gru's hearing-impaired inventor and partner-in-crime who speaks with a British accent. He seems to have a romantic interest in Gru's mother, Marlena. He is planned to join Gru, Lucy and the Girls to meet Dru in the third film, but absent from the film having accidentally frozen himself in carbonite, similar to that of [[Han Solo]] from ''[[Star Wars]]''.
*Dru (voiced by Steve Carell): Gru's charming, happy-go-lucky long-lost twin brother, who is also in the super-villain business. Dru looks just like his brother, only he has blonde hair and wears white attire. He is Lucy's brother-in-law and the adoptive uncle of Margo, Edith, and Agnes.
*Marlena (voiced by [[Julie Andrews]]): Gru and Dru's mother. Her neglect of Gru's ambitions is identified among the main reasons why he became a supervillain. In the denouement of the first film, she admits to him that he is a better parent than she. Marlena later makes a silent cameo appearance in the second film at Gru and Lucy's wedding. In the third film, Marlena reveals to Gru that after she and Gru and Dru's father divorced, they each got to take one son with them, with Marlena saying that she got "second pick".
*Fritz (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Dru's courteous, well mannered butler who speaks with a British accent. He takes Gru, Lucy, and the girls to meet Dru at his mansion in Freedonia.
*Silas Ramsbottom (voiced by [[Steve Coogan]]): Director of the Anti-Villain League in the second film. The Minions (and Gru) make fun of his surname. In the third film, he retires from the AVL and is replaced by Valerie Da Vinci as the new Director of the AVL.
*Valerie Da Vinci (voiced by [[Jenny Slate]]): A ruthless member of the Anti-Villain League who replaces Silas Ramsbottom as Director in the third film. She fires Gru and Lucy due to them failing to capture Balthazar Bratt, but rehires them in the end for capturing Bratt and returning the diamond, though it wasn’t seen, but Gru imagines her rehiring him along with Lucy.

===Villains===
*Victor "Vector" Perkins (voiced by [[Jason Segel]], Jason Harris in the video game): In the first film, Gru's rival, and the son of Mr. Perkins, the President of the Bank of Evil that supplies loans to villains in their schemes (formerly including Gru).
*Mr. Perkins (voiced by [[Will Arnett]]): The enormous and equally strong President of the Bank of Evil, responsible for giving out loans to villains in their schemes. He is also Vector’s father. 
*Miss Hattie (voiced by [[Kristen Wiig]]): The charismatic but cruel owner of the orphanage from which Gru adopts his daughters. She sends Margo, Edith, and Agnes out to sell cookies and makes them sleep in cardboard boxes if they fail to meet their quota.
*Eduardo "El Macho" Perez (voiced by [[Benjamin Bratt]]): A Mexican-accented supervillain in the second film. As El Macho, he was believed to have died after strapping 250 pounds of TNT on himself and riding a shark into an active volcano. However, it turns out that he actually faked his death, and he became the owner of a Mexican restaurant. He has a son named Antonio, with whom Margo is infatuated at first, until Antonio abandons her. It turns out that Eduardo was aware of Gru's life as a villain and plans to abduct  most of Gru's minions and turn them into hairy, purple, savage, evil minions with a dangerous chemical compound he stole called PX-41 and send the mutated Minions to major cities to take over the world. In the final battle, as Gru manages to restore the mutated Minions to normal, Eduardo drinks the compound himself, turning into a big purple furry monster to fight Gru. He is defeated by Gru and Nefario.
*Balthazar Bratt (voiced by [[Trey Parker]]): A supervillain in the [[Despicable Me 3|third film]]. A former 1980s child star, he adopts the identity of his supervillain character after the onset of puberty leads to the cancellation of his television series. He is obsessed with 1980s pop culture and uses a giant robot armed with a laser and inflatable bubble gum to exact revenge on Hollywood.
*Clive (voiced by [[Andy Nyman]]): a robot who acts as Balthazar Bratt's sidekick.
*Scarlet Overkill (voiced by [[Sandra Bullock]]): In ''[[Minions (film)|Minions]]'', she is the world's first female super-villain who is bent on world domination.
*Herb Overkill (voiced by [[Jon Hamm]]): Scarlet's husband and an inventor.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3808">The '''Dress Act 1746''' was part of the [[Act of Proscription]] which came into force on 1 August 1746 and made wearing "the [[Highland Dress]]" — including [[tartan]] or a [[kilt]] — illegal in [[Scotland]] as well as reiterating the [[Disarming Act]]. The [[Jacobitism|Jacobite Risings]] between 1689 and 1746 found their most effective support amongst the [[Scottish clan]]s, and this act was part of a series of measures attempting to bring the warrior clans under government control. An exemption allowed the kilt to be worn in the army, continuing the tradition established by the [[Black Watch]] regiment.

The law was repealed in 1782. By that time kilts and tartans were no longer ordinary Highland wear, ended by enforcement of the law and by the circumstances of the [[Highland clearances]], but within two years Highland aristocrats set up the [[Royal Highland and Agricultural Society of Scotland|Highland Society of Edinburgh]] and soon other clubs followed with aims including promoting "the general use of the ancient Highland dress". This would lead to the Highland pageant of the [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]].

==The act==
[[File:Bagpipes at the Strawberry Festival (5798097073) (2).jpg|alt=|thumb|Bagpipes at the Strawberry Festival.]]
''Abolition and Proscription of the Highland Dress 19 George II, Chap. 39, Sec. 17, 1746:''
{{quote|That from and after the first day of August, One thousand, seven hundred and forty-six, no man or boy within that part of Britain called Scotland, other than such as shall be employed as Officers and Soldiers in His Majesty's Forces, shall, on any pretext whatever, wear or put on the clothes commonly called Highland clothes (that is to say) the [[Plaid (pattern)|Plaid]], Philabeg, or little Kilt, Trowse, Shoulder-belts, or any part whatever of what peculiarly belongs to the Highland Garb; and that no tartan or party-coloured plaid of stuff shall be used for Great Coats or upper coats, and if any such person shall presume after the said first day of August, to wear or put on the aforesaid garment or any part of them, every such person so offending&amp;nbsp;... For the first offence,shall be liable to be imprisoned for 6 months, and on the second offence, to be transported to any of His Majesty's plantations beyond the seas, there to remain for the space of seven years.}}

==Repeal==
On 1 July 1782 royal assent was given to ''Repeal of the Act Proscribing the Wearing of Highland Dress 22 George III, Chap. 63, 1782'' and a proclamation issued in [[Scottish Gaelic language|Gaelic]] and English announced:
{{quote|Listen Men.  This is bringing before all the Sons of the Gael, the King and Parliament of Britain have forever abolished the act against the Highland Dress; which came down to the Clans from the beginning of the world to the year 1746.  This must bring great joy to every Highland Heart.  You are no  longer bound down to the unmanly dress of the Lowlander.  This is declaring to every Man, young and old, simple and gentle, that they may after this put on and wear the [[Truis]], the Little Kilt, the Coat, and the Striped Hose, as also the Belted Plaid, without fear of the Law of the Realm or the spite of the enemies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Act against the Highland Dress|url=http://www.electricscotland.com/history/highland_dress.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot==

===Anime series===
{{See also|List of Eden of the East episodes}}
On November 22, 2010, ten [[Tomahawk (missile)|missiles]] strike [[Japan]], but there are no casualties. The apparent terrorist attack is named "Careless Monday", and no one takes responsibility. Three months on, university graduate Saki Morimi visits [[New York City]] and then [[Washington D.C.]] for her graduation trip. Outside the [[White House]], Saki encounters a naked Japanese man suffering from [[amnesia]]. The man, after receiving Saki's coat, follows the directions of a [[concierge]], Juiz, on his unusual [[cell phone]], to an apartment where he finds multiple [[fake passport]]s, choosing the identity of Akira Takizawa. Saki appears to retrieve her passport, and they return to Japan, where a new missile has hit.

Takizawa discovers that his phone carries ¥8.2 billion in digital money, and that he is part of a game, where twelve individuals called Seleção are given [[Japanese yen|¥10 billion]] to "save" Japan in some way. The Seleção are able to contact Juiz, who can fulfill their orders for a price. However, if the money is used up completely, or for selfish purposes, the individual will be eliminated by the Supporter, the anonymous "twelfth man" of the group. During the search for answers, Takizawa learns he was involved in Careless Monday, transporting twenty-thousand [[NEET]]s to [[Dubai]] after they helped evacuate the missiles' attacks before the attacks.

He also encounters other Seleção, including [[National Police Agency (Japan)|police officer]] Yūsei Kondō, [[neurosurgeon]] Dr. Hajime Hiura, and [[serial killer]] Kuroha Diana Shiratori, who targets rapists. Saki and her friends, who run a company called Eden of the East, eventually become involved in the conspiracies surrounding Takizawa. The company's name stems from a cell phone app that can recognise and provide details on items and people via social networking.

Takizawa meets Yutaka Itazu, a [[hikikomori]] and hacker, who studies Takizawa and the late Kondō's phones, able to access the Seleção requests. They discover Takizawa did not launch the missiles, but it was orchestrated by other Seleção, Daiju Mononobe and Ryō Yūki. After Takizawa leaves, Itazu discovers sixty more missiles will be launched, but is run over by Mononobe before he can inform Takizawa. However, Itazu sends the Seleção database to Eden beforehand, and recovers in hospital.

Mononobe approaches Takizawa, inviting him to his endgame. He explains that Mr. Outside is actually Saizō Atō, an elderly businessman who helped rebuild [[Post-occupation Japan|post-war Japan]]. He believes Atō has since died. Travelling to Atō's business facility, Mononobe reveals to Takizawa that Juiz is an advanced [[artificial intelligence]], housed in twelve [[supercomputer]]s. Takizawa objects to Mononobe and Yūki's plan and leaves, but not before they reveal Takizawa's made himself a martyr to defend the NEETs from being accused as terrorists, erasing his memory to protect them.

Takizawa reunites with Saki and Eden at his home, a [[shopping mall]] in [[Toyosu]], just as the twenty-thousand NEETs return from Dubai on a cargo ship. Takizawa draws everyone to the roof, ordering them to suggest a countermeasure for the approaching missiles. Juiz summons the [[JSDF]] to intercept the missiles. Takizawa, knowing he will be unable to pose as a terrorist, asks Juiz to make him the "King of Japan", erasing his memory once again, but he slips his cell phone into Saki's pocket beforehand.

===''The King of Eden''===
Six months after the events of the anime, Takizawa has disappeared, while Saki searches for his whereabouts. Juiz sends Saki a message he recorded before erasing his memory again, Takizawa instructing her to meet in their "special place". Following the missile strike, Eden became a successful business, and Takizawa has become a folk hero named the "Air King", his image marketed by Seleção, Jintaro Tsuji, hoping to turn him into a martyr or terrorist. Eden also learns Takizawa's last name has been changed to Iinuma, the same as the recently deceased Prime Minister of Japan. Tsuji spreads rumours that Takizawa is Iinuma's illegitimate son.

Saki, realising that Takizawa's message may be alluding to [[World Trade Center site|Ground Zero]] in New York, travels there. She discovers a gun has been smuggled into her luggage, her cab driver fleeing with Takizawa's phone in the back. Saki eventually finds Takizawa, who does not recognise her. They retrieve her purse and Takizawa's phone from the cabbie, Takizawa accepting his lost identity. Eden, who have access to the Seleção database, learn Yūki destroyed his phone, and Dr. Hiura is alive, his memory erased by the Supporter. They later discover that Mononobe has hacked their systems, forcing them to shut Eden down.

Takizawa hopes to find out what became of his mother, travelling with Saki to a [[carousel]] where they find a golden ring left there by his mother. They are attacked by men working for Iinuma, and film director Taishi Naomoto, a fellow Seleção, but he is arrested. Kuroha aids Takizawa, informing him that he must return to Japan to confirm his illegitimacy as the Prime Minister's son. Mononobe begins targeting a series of [[truck]]s, actually housing the individual Juiz supercomputers, with missiles. He destroy the Supporter and Tsuji's trucks, while Kuroha sacrifices her own to keep Takizawa in the game. She leaves while Takizawa and Saki fly to Japan.

===''Paradise Lost''===
Takizawa and Saki arrive in Japan, meeting Iinuma's [[widow]] Chigusa, who removes several strands of Takizawa's hair for a [[DNA test]]. Takizawa is separated from Saki, asking her to track down his mother by identifying his pet dog through Eden. Takizawa later escapes his escorts by swapping places with one of the NEETs. He contacts Eden, who have retreated to the university campus, informing him of the Juiz trucks.

Saki and her friend Satoshi Osugi track down Takizawa's mother, Aya, who runs a bar. She admits she lived in New York and had a fling with Iinuma, but does not confirm or deny the identity of Takizawa's father. Aya flees when Mononobe sends police to interrogate her. Takizawa tracks down his Juiz truck, meeting up with Eden members Micchon and Sis, who hijack Mononobe's truck. Eden's leader Kazuomi Hirasawa meets Saizō Atō, discovering he is alive and works as a cab driver, doubling also as the Supporter.

Takizawa and Eden arrive at Iinuma's house, where Mononobe meets Takizawa. Mononobe asks him to retire from the game so he can win and take control of the government. Takizawa agrees as long as Mononobe becomes Prime Minister, but the latter declines. Takizawa goes ahead with his own endgame, addressing Japan using the "Airship" phone app, roleplaying as a terrorist but encourages society to change their country for the better. In a final act, he gives all the recipients one yen each.

Impressed, Atō ends the game, declaring all of the Seleção as winners. As a farewell gift, he erases their memories of the game over the phones. However, Takizawa is unaffected, immune to its effects. Mononobe leaves, running into Yūki, who is unaware of what has happened, and tries to murder Mononobe for abandoning him. Mononobe crashes his car, running over Yūki in the process. Takizawa checks the DNA test, discovering he is unrelated to her husband. He departs, kissing Saki and promising to meet her again. In the epilogue, Saki narrates how Eden shut down for a while to support the NEETs. In a final scene, Takizawa meets Atō, and they drive off to speak about future plans.

:A young man who lost his memory because of a brainwashing program, Akira Takizawa meets Saki Morimi in Washington D.C., appearing naked and only carrying a handgun and an extremely advanced cell phone with the phrase ''"noblesse oblige"'' printed on it and 8.2 billion yen in digital money credit.  When Saki is questioned by police after she throws a coin in the grounds of the [[White House]], he helps her out and she gives him her coat to thank him.  When he makes his first call, a female voice claiming to be "Juiz" answers. She sends him a map that marks an apartment building where he is apparently staying. In his apartment, he finds guns and many different passports which seem to all belong to him. Saki follows after realizing she left her passport in the coat she gave him and the two decide to return to Japan together. His real name and DOB are unknown; his current identity as Akira Takizawa was chosen from the passports he found, which lists that in [[Toyosu]], Japan and that he was born on January 7, 1989, one day younger than Saki Morimi.

The Eden of the East club started out as a small recycling group, but has quickly turned into a springboard for a successful commercial website, thanks to Micchon's revolutionary image recognition engine that resides in the ''Eden'' website and Saki's ability to improve the value of any item, including junk.  Soon, the site's ability to work on phones attracted many student subscribers. However, after the students abused the social matchmaking abilities where a girl dropped out and the university launched an investigation, the team slowed development on the project. In addition to Saki, who handles public relations, the members include:&lt;ref name="ep6"/&gt;
* {{nihongo |{{vanchor |Satoshi Ōsugi}}|大杉 智|Ōsugi Satoshi}}, a friend of Saki who holds unrequited love for her. He is the first among the club members to join the corporate world. He is voiced by [[Takuya Eguchi]] in Japanese and by [[Michael Sinterniklaas]] in English;
* {{nihongo |{{vanchor |Kazuomi Hirasawa}}|平澤 一臣|Hirasawa Kazuomi}}, the ''de facto'' leader of Eden of the East. He has delayed his graduation with his ultimate goal to create a paradise for [[NEET]]s.&lt;ref name= "ep6" /&gt; He is voiced by Motoyuki Kawahara in Japanese and by [[J. Michael Tatum]] in English;
* {{nihongo |{{vanchor |Mikuru Katsuhara}}|葛原 みくる|Katsuhara Mikuru}}, nicknamed {{nihongo ||みっちょん|Micchon}}, a shy but frank girl who programmed the ''Eden of the East'''s image recognition system. She is also Hirasawa's cousin.&lt;ref name= "ep6" /&gt; She is voiced by [[Ayaka Saitō]] in Japanese and by [[Stephanie Sheh]] in English;
* {{nihongo |{{vanchor |Haruo Kasuga}}||}}, a club member who likes to sit inside the clubroom's [[rolltop desk]]. He notices Osugi had gone missing after he had dinner with him. He is voiced by Hayato Taioh in Japanese and by  [[John Burgmeier]] in English.&lt;ref name="ep6"/&gt;
* {{nihongo |{{vanchor |Sis}}|おネエ|Onee}}, a club member who reviews the legal documents. Her real name and age is unknown. She is voiced by [[Kimiko Saitō|Kimiko Saitoh]] in Japanese and [[Lydia Mackay]] in English.&lt;ref name="ep6"&gt;''Eden of the East'' episode 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

The club has also used a consultant, {{nihongo|Yutaka Itazu|板津 豊|Itazu Yutaka}}, a prodigious yet reclusive [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] nicknamed {{Nihongo|Panties||Pantsu}} based on an alternate [[Kanji#Readings|reading of the Kanji]] in his name, and the fact that he has been a [[Hikikomori|shut-in]] since he lost his pants two years before the start of the series. He is voiced by [[Nobuyuki Hiyama]] in Japanese and by [[Newton Pittman]] in English.&lt;ref name="ep8"&gt;''Eden of the East'' episode 8.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first movie, Eden of the East becomes a small business and the club members try to support Saki and Akira while tracking the Seleção activities.
&lt;!-- Do not split off, characters not notable enough for own sections --&gt;

=== Seleção and related characters ===
{{anchor|Selecao|Seleção}}
The Seleção ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: "Selection") are the participants of the game. Each carries a special "[[Noblesse oblige]]" cell phone that is credited with 10 billion yen which they must use to "save Japan". They can spend the money in whatever manner they wish, using a [[concierge]] named [[#Juiz|Juiz]] ([[Portuguese language|Portuguese]]: "Judge") to accomplish the goal, however, any Seleção who uses up their money before they can complete their mission, who acts purely for self-interest, or does nothing with the phone for an extended period of time will be eliminated by a person (one of the twelve) called "The Supporter".  Similarly, if someone breaks the rules they will be eliminated. When someone is declared the winner of the game, the other eleven are eliminated. The person who created the game is named "Mr. Outside."

[[File:Selecao.png|thumb|right|Pictures of known Seleções during the first film. Number 7 is the only Seleção not revealed in the anime.]]
;{{nihongo|{{vanchor|Daiju Mononobe|Mononobe}}|物部 大樹|Mononobe Daiju}}
:{{Anime voice|{{visible anchor|[[Atsushi Miyauchi]]}}|[[John Gremillion]]}}
:Seleção No. 1.
:Mononobe is one of the main antagonists in the series. A former bureaucrat, he has connections to many of the political leaders in Japan. He maneuvers to become an executive (CEO  in the TV series English dub) of the ATO Institution. He brings Akira to the ATO headquarters and reveals more information about his past with the hopes of recruiting him to his side. His ambition is not only to win the game, but to replace Mr. Outside himself as he assumes Mr. Outside is dead. According to him, Japan is in a state of apathy caused by the economic prosperity it has obtained since the end of [[World War II]], and the strong political influence from countries like the United States into their society, thus he plans to "save" the country by rallying the population with a wide scale terrorist attack.&lt;ref name="ep10"/&gt; However, Akira and the NEETs recruited by him managed to foil his plans, first with Careless Monday, and then by countering the missiles at the end of the regular TV series.&lt;ref name = "ep11"&gt;''Eden of the East'', episode 11&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''King of Eden'' movie, he uses the Japanese police Public Security Dept to investigate the Eden of the East group, which has been involved with Akira Takizawa's activities. Using his connections with the government, he intends to pass a "100% Inheritance Tax Bill" in order to combat Akira's plan with the NEETs. In ''Paradise Lost'', he reveals that he plans to overthrow the current government and install a more powerful one at the cost of individual freedom. After his memory is wiped when Mr. Outside ends the game, Mononobe crashes his car after being shot at by a crazed Yūki. It is unknown whether he survives or not.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Jintarō Tsuji|Tsuji|2G}}|辻 仁太郎|Tsuji Jintarō}}
:{{animevoices|[[Kōji Yusa]]|[[Todd Haberkorn]]}}
:Seleção No. 2.
:Tsuji, nicknamed "2G", is a Seleção working with Mononobe and Yūki. He seems to care very little about Mr. Outside's "game" and wishes simply for it to be over as soon as possible. He claims he has not spent any of the 10 billion yen he was given.&lt;ref name ="ep10"/&gt; In the ''King of Eden'' movie, he begins to make his move, by making Takizawa the main figure of a major trend and [[Japanese idol|idol]]. He is responsible for marketing Takizawa as the "Air King", with advertisements and merchandise depicting Akira's pose while averting the missile crisis.  Ultimately he plans to have Takizawa sacrificed as a martyr and hero of Japan. He is technically eliminated from the game when Mononobe destroys his trailer, but later loses his money when Mononobe arranges to have him investigated by tax auditors.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Toshiko Kitabayashi}}|北林 敏子|Kitabayashi Toshiko}}
:{{animevoices|Reiko Seno|[[Juli Erickson]]}}
:Seleção No. 3
:Seleção 3 appears to be an elderly purple-haired woman according to the Seleção listings in ''The King of Eden'', but takes action in the second film. She makes her first call to Juiz to order some food. It is revealed at the end of the film that she is in fact hospitalised, and graciously thanks Mr. Outside for the game.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Yūsei Kondō}}|近藤 勇誠|Kondō Yūsei}}
:{{Anime voice|Hiroshi Shirokuma|[[Christopher Sabat]]}}
:Seleção No. 4.
:A detective in Japan. After spending almost all of his money without accomplishing the mission given by Mr. Outside, he steals Akira's cellphone in order to take possession of his cash, but his plans are thwarted when he is informed by Juiz that a Seleção's money can only be used by its rightful owner. He is stabbed by his wife while attempting to return the phone to Akira, but manages to warn him of how dangerous the game is before dying.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Hajime Hiura}}|火浦 元|Hiura Hajime}}
:{{animevoices|[[Shinji Ogawa]]|[[Kent Williams (voice actor)|Kent Williams]]}}
:Seleção No. 5.
:Hiura is a 52-year-old former talented doctor specializing in [[neurosurgery]]. Due to an accident, his hands are unable to be used in surgeries that require precise accuracy, and eventually he resigns.  Based on his former thought that the number of patients a doctor can help is limited, Hiura uses the cellphone to aim for the ideal treatment for all illnesses. He is eliminated by the Supporter after spending all of his money, and although he failed to save Japan, he tells Akira that he succeeded in his own mission. In ''The King of Eden'' movie, it's revealed that the Supporter didn't kill him; instead he erased his memories.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Taishi Naomoto|Jikimoto}}|直元 大志|Naomoto Taishi}}
:{{animevoices|[[Hiroyuki Yoshino (voice actor)|Hiroyuki Yoshino]]|[[Josh Grelle]]}}
:Seleção No. 6.
:Naomoto &lt;ref name="jikimoto" group="note"&gt;Naomoto is spelled as Jikimoto in the English closing credits for the Eden of the East movies.&lt;/ref&gt; appears in ''The King of Eden'' movie as one of the major antagonists. A film director who intends to film the "ideal movie," with Akira and Saki as the main characters, and to ultimately kill them in a way that has never before been seen in film. For that reason, he causes the protagonists a lot of problems, especially Saki, because he figures that the prince will come to save 'the damsel in distress'. His ill-conceived plot is foiled thanks to Shiratori's successful extraction of Takizawa and Saki in her Porsche Cayenne. He is last seen in police custody in America.

;Akira Takizawa
:Seleção No. 9.
:The male protagonist of the series.  Takizawa's position as Seleção No. 9 is revealed early on, although at first he does not understand what it means because he is suffering from [[amnesia]].

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Ryō Yūki}}|結城 亮|Yūki Ryō}}
:{{animevoices|[[Masakazu Morita]]|[[Jerry Jewell]]}}
:Seleção No. 10.
:The perpetrator responsible for the missiles fired on Careless Monday. Despite this, Yūki is very meek and shows hesitation when forced to assist in the silencing of [[#Panties|Panties]]. He allies with Mononobe, as they have similar goals. Yūki's motivation for Careless Monday was to take revenge against the society he hated.&lt;ref name="ep10"/&gt; He was forced to work to support his ill parents and felt cheated by the system. In ''The King of Eden'' movie, he appears to be inactive, but he reveals to Tsuji that he has broken his phone in a bid to evade Mononobe, who is tracking him, resulting in his elimination from the game. He soon becomes obsessed with getting revenge against Takizawa. Since Yūki broke his phone and does not receive Mr. Outside's final message, Yūki's memories are not erased when the game ends. However, he is run over by Mononobe's car when he attempts to murder Takizawa. It is unclear whether he survives or not.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Kuroha Diana Shiratori|Kuroha}}|白鳥・D・黒羽|Shiratori Daiana Kuroha}}
:{{animevoices|[[Rei Igarashi]]|[[Christine Auten]]}}
:Seleção No. 11.
:Shiratori is president of a model agency by day; however, by night she is a serial killer. She uses the Noblesse Oblige cellphone to clean up evidence of her murders and cover up her crimes. She kills men by severing their penises ("Johnnies") with a cigar cutter. However, she only targets men who have victimized women, such as rapists, inspiring her current actions as a Seleção. In ''The King of Eden'' movie, she allies with Akira, saving him from various problems. She is eliminated from the game when she shields Akira's Juiz trailer from a missile launched by Mononobe with her own trailer. Her memories presumably are erased along with those of the other Seleção when the game ends.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Saizō Atō}}|亜東 才蔵|Atō Saizō}}
:{{animevoices|[[Hiroshi Arikawa]]|Grant James}}
:Seleçao No. 12
:A powerful businessman who helped build postwar Japan. He is later hinted to be {{nihongo|{{vanchor|Mr. Outside}}|ミスター・アウトサイド|Misutā Autosaido}}.&lt;ref name="ep10"&gt;''Eden of the East'', episode 10.&lt;/ref&gt; An unseen and mysterious character, he chooses eleven Japanese citizens as Seleção and gives them the phones with their mission to bring stability to Japan in whatever manner they wish. However, he warns that he will send a "Supporter" to eliminate any Seleção who use up their money before they can complete their mission, acts selfishly, idles for an extended period of time, or breaks his rules.
:Akira Takizawa later realizes that "Ato Saizo" is a pun for the Japanese pronunciation of "Outside." A football enthusiast, Saizo's inspiration for the Seleção name came from the Portuguese word for selection and the common nickname of [[Brazil national football team|Brazil's national team]].&lt;ref name="ep10"/&gt;&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Further evidence of Mr. Outside's enthusiasm for football is the Seleção's 'crest', which is in the style of a Brazilian [[escutcheon (heraldry)|escutcheon]].&lt;/ref&gt; His true identity is not revealed until ''Paradise Lost'', where he is an elderly man who has posed as a simple cab driver. Saizo also has four female helpers who call him "grandpa" and assist him with the game. All of the Seleção were passengers in his cab at some point, where he asked them how they would spend 10 billion yen, with the exception of Takizawa, who had met Atō Saizō when he stopped beside the taxi on a bicycle. After the events of the ''Paradise Lost'' film, Saizo declares all of the Seleção winners and has their memories erased to free them from the game. Takizawa manages to keep his memories and tracks down Saizo so that they can work together to improve Japan.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Juiz}}|ジュイス|Juisu}}&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Juiz is the Portuguese word for "Judge". The phones used to contact Juiz have a sword and scales, which are symbols normally used in courts to represent justice and law.&lt;/ref&gt;
:{{animevoices|[[Sakiko Tamagawa]]|[[Stephanie Young]]}}
:A mysterious female voice who acts as a [[concierge]] for the Seleção. She gives them information and provides for their requests to be answered, from executing large scale purchases to bribing authorities and conducting assassinations. In episode 10, it is revealed that Juiz isn't human but is an advanced [[artificial intelligence]]. In the ''King of Eden Movie'', it is further revealed that there are twelve copies of Juiz, each housed in a device disguised as a cargo trailer.  (The Juiz devices originally were stored in a facility that Mononobe found, but they were relocated to mobile platforms, leaving behind large holes at the facility). When a Seleção is removed from the game, their trailer is scrapped, or alternately, a Seleção is removed if their trailer is destroyed. Judging by the differing reactions of the various Juizes, the AIs appear to be independent entities, but initialized from the same generative code base. In episode 10, a woman appears at ATO headquarters with the same voice and manner of speech as Juiz; this serves to cast doubt on whether she is actually Juiz or whether her voice and personality (if not her memories) simply were used as the model for developing Juiz. In the ''Paradise Lost'' movie, the woman is revealed to be one of Mr. Outside's four quadruplet granddaughters: women who facilitate the requests that are given to the Juiz units.

Seleção No. 7 is never seen in the series or films, but Seleção No. 8, a middle-aged man, makes a cameo at the conclusion of the second film during Mr. Outside's closing statement.

The series received high marks for its first episode in the [[Anime News Network]] Spring 2009 Preview Guide. Reviewers Theron Martin, Carlo Santos, and Casey Brienza each gave the first episode a rating of 4.5 out of 5,&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Theron Martin"&gt;{{cite web | date=2009-04-03 | last=Martin | first=Theron | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2009-08-05 | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2009-03-03/theron | title=The Spring 2009 Anime Preview Guide: Theron Martin}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Carlo Santos"&gt;{{cite web | date=2009-04-03 | last=Santos | first=Carlo | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2009-08-05 | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2009-04-03/carlo | title=The Spring 2009 Anime Preview Guide: Carlo Santos}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Casey Brienza"&gt;{{cite web | date=2009-04-03 | last=Brienza | first=Casey | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2009-08-05 | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2009-04-03/casey | title=The Spring 2009 Anime Preview Guide: Casey Brienza}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Carl Kimlinger rated it a 5 out of 5.&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Carl Kimlinger"&gt;{{cite web | date=2009-04-03 | last=Kimlinger | first=Carl | publisher=Anime News Network | accessdate=2009-08-05 | url= http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/feature/2009-04-03/carl | title=The Spring 2009 Anime Preview Guide: Carl Kimlinger}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review, Martin wrote that "this is not your normal anime series. If you're looking for the new season's most unusual entry, something well departed from all of the game adaptations, shonen action series, and cutesy romances, this one is it." Additionally, he praised the artistic aspects of "outstanding background art, appealing character designs, highly likeable lead characters, and a unique closer." He concluded that "this one does everything it can to draw viewers in with its first episode and get them to want to keep watching, and many will."&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Theron Martin" /&gt;

Santos commented that "there's only one reason this episode falls short of perfect: it's not until the end that the story really takes off", but also pointed out the "slick, expressive animation."&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Carlo Santos" /&gt;

Brienza started her review saying "Well, what the heck; might as well be blunt right from the get-go: I loved it," but criticized the "hackneyed plot" and claimed it "has been ripped whole cloth from a [[Robert Ludlum]] novel." Her praise related to "the scrupulous, realistic detail of the Washington D.C. setting" and the "gentle, whimsical innocence" of "Chica Umino's character designs", as well as "the {{sic|scatalogical|expected=indecent}} humor... and tender hopes of the heroine which reminds me a lot of Hayao Miyazaki."&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Casey Brienza" /&gt;

Kimlinger, while admitting "I am not a fan of Kenji Kamiyama", stated the episode was "a weird and charming start to a weird and charming show." He wrote that "the first few minutes of Eden are some of the funniest in recent memory", and commented that "both leads have a conspicuous excess of likeability, and Kamiyama displays a mastery of smiling humanism that would have been unthinkable earlier in his career". Like Brienza, he pointed out that "the debt ''Eden'' owes to ''The Bourne Identity'' is considerable", but concludes that "the result is, in a word, superb".&lt;ref name="ANN Spring 09 Preview Guide: Carl Kimlinger" /&gt;

Writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', Charles Solomon ranked the series the fourth best anime on his "Top 10".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/anime-top-10-evangelion-fullmetal-alchemist-lead-2010s-best/ | title=Anime Top 10: ‘Evangelion,’ ‘Fullmetal Alchemist’ lead 2010′s best | author=Solomon, Charles | date=December 21, 2010 | work=[[Los Angeles Times]] | accessdate=February 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ethnic conflict''' is a conflict between two or more contending [[ethnic group]]s.  While the source of the conflict may be [[political]], social, economic or religious, the individuals in conflict must expressly fight for their ethnic group's position within society. This final criterion differentiates ethnic conflict from other forms of struggle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ethnic Conflict and Civic Life : Hindus and Muslims in India|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=New Haven|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Modern Hatreds: The Symbolic politics of ethnic war|last=Kaufman|first=Stuart J.|publisher=Cornell University. Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=Ithaca|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethnic conflict does not necessarily have to be [[Violence|violent]]. In a multi-ethnic society where freedom of speech is protected, ethnic conflict can be an everyday feature of plural democracies. For example, ethnic conflict might be a non-violent struggle for resources divided among ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dynamics of Ethnic Competition and Conflict|last=Olzak|first=Susan|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=Stanford|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the subject of the confrontation must be either directly or symbolically linked with an ethnic group. In healthy multi-ethnic democracies, these conflicts are usually institutionalized and "channeled through parliaments, assemblies and bureaucracies or through non-violent demonstrations and strikes."&lt;ref name="Varshney2007"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ashutoshvarshney.net/wp-content/files_mf/varshneyethnicityandethnicconflict.pdf|title=Ethnicity and Ethnic Conflict|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=2007|website=|publisher=Oxford handbook of comparative politics|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While democratic countries cannot always prevent ethnic conflict flaring up into violence, institutionalized ethnic conflict does ensure that ethnic groups can articulate their demands in a peaceful manner, which reduces the likelihood of violence. On the other hand, in authoritarian systems, ethnic minorities are often unable to express their grievances. Grievances are instead allowed to fester which might lead to long phases of ethnic silence followed by a violent outburst.&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt; Therefore, ethnic peace is an absence of violence, not an absence of conflict. Another consequence is that violent ethnic rebellions often result in political rights for previously marginalized groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Koos|first=Carlo|date=2016-02-01|title=Does violence pay? The effect of ethnic rebellion on overcoming political deprivation|url=http://cmp.sagepub.com/content/33/1/3|journal=Conflict Management and Peace Science|language=en|volume=33|issue=1|pages=3–24|doi=10.1177/0738894214559670|issn=0738-8942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Academic explanations of ethnic conflict generally fall into one of three schools of thought: [[primordialism|primordialist]], [[instrumentalism|instrumentalist]] or [[social constructivism|constructivist]]. Recently, several political scientists have argued for either top-down or bottom-up explanations for ethnic conflict. Intellectual debate has also focused on whether ethnic conflict has become more prevalent since the end of the [[Cold War]], and on devising ways of managing conflicts, through instruments such as [[consociationalism]] and [[Federalism|federalisation]].

==Theories of causes==
The causes of ethnic conflict are debated by [[political scientists]] and [[sociologists]]. Explanations generally fall into one of three schools of thought: primordialist, instrumentalist, and constructivist. More recent scholarship draws on all three schools.{{year needed|date=August 2013}}{{who|date=August 2013}}

===Primordialist accounts===
Proponents of primordialist accounts argue that "[e]thnic groups and nationalities exist because there are traditions of belief and action towards primordial objects such as biological features and especially territorial location".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Steven|last=Grosby|year=1994|title=The verdict of history: The inexpungeable tie of primordiality&amp;nbsp;– a response to Eller and Coughlan|journal=[[Ethnic and Racial Studies]]|volume=17|issue=1|pages=164–171 [p. 168]|doi=10.1080/01419870.1994.9993817}}&lt;/ref&gt; Primordialist accounts rely on strong ties of kinship among members of ethnic groups. [[Donald L. Horowitz]] argues that this kinship "makes it possible for ethnic groups to think in terms of family resemblances".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Donald L.|last=Horowitz|year=1985|title=Ethnic Groups in Conflict|location=Berkeley, CA|publisher=University of California Press|page=57|isbn=0520053850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Clifford Geertz]], a founding scholar of primordialism, asserts that each person has a natural connection to perceived kinsmen. In time and through repeated conflict, essential ties to one's ethnicity will coalesce and will interfere with ties to civil society. Ethnic groups will consequently always threaten the survival of civil governments but not the existence of nations formed by one ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Old societies and new States; the quest for modernity in Asia and Africa.|last=Geertz|first=Clifford|publisher=Free Press of Glencoe|year=1963|isbn=|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, when considered through a primordial lens, ethnic conflict in multi-ethnic society is inevitable.

A number of political scientists argue that the root causes of ethnic conflict do not involve ethnicity ''per se'' but rather institutional, political, and economic factors.  These scholars argue that the concept of ethnic war is misleading because it leads to an [[essentialism|essentialist]] conclusion that certain groups are doomed to fight each other when in fact the wars between them that occur are often the result of political decisions.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Constructing Grievance: Ethnic Nationalism in Russia's Republics|last=Giuliano|first=Elise|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, primordial accounts  do not account for the spatial and temporal variations in ethnic violence. If these "ancient hatreds" are always simmering under the surface and are at the forefront of people's consciousness, then ethnic groups should constantly be ensnared in violence. However, ethnic violence occurs in sporadic outbursts. For example, Varshney points out that although Yugoslavia broke up due to ethnic violence in the 1990s, it had enjoyed a long peace of decades before the USSR collapsed. Therefore, some scholars claim that it is unlikely that primordial ethnic differences alone caused the outbreak of violence in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt;

Primordialists have reformulated the "ancient hatreds" hypothesis and have focused more on the role of human nature. Peterson argues that the existence of hatred and animosity does not have to be rooted in history for it to play a role in shaping human behavior and action: "If "ancient hatred" means a hatred consuming the daily thoughts of great masses of people, then the "ancient hatreds" argument deserves to be readily dismissed. However, if hatred is conceived as a historically formed "schema" that guides action in some situations, then the conception should be taken more seriously."&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt;

===Instrumentalist accounts===
[[Anthony D. Smith|Anthony Smith]] notes that the instrumentalist account "came to prominence in the 1960s and 1970s in the United States, in the debate about (white) ethnic persistence in what was supposed to have been an effective melting pot".&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;{{cite journal |first=Anthony|last=Smith|year=2001|title=Nationalism: Theory, Ideology, History|location=Cambridge|publisher=Polity|pages=54–55|isbn=0745626580}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new theory sought explained persistence as the result of the actions of community leaders, "who used their cultural groups as sites of mass mobilization and as constituencies in their competition for power and resources, because they found them more effective than social classes".&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; In this account of ethnic identification, ethnicity and race are viewed as instrumental means to achieve particular ends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Stephen|last=Cornell|first2=Douglas|last2=Hartmann|year=1998|title=Ethnicity and Race: Making Identities in a Changing World|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|publisher=Pine Forge|page=59|isbn=0761985018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whether [[Ethnic group|ethnicity]] is a fixed perception or not is not crucial in the instrumentalist accounts. Moreover, the scholars of this school generally do not oppose the view that ethnic difference plays a part in many conflicts. They simply claim that ethnic difference is not sufficient to explain conflicts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schlichting|first=Ursel|chapter=Conflict Between Different Nationalities: Chances for and Limits to Their Settlement|editor1-first=Andreas|editor1-last=Klinke|editor2-first=Ortwin|editor2-last=Renn|editor3-link=Jean Paul Lehners|editor3-first=Jean Paul|editor3-last=Lehners|title=Ethnic Conflicts and Civil Society|location=Aldershot|publisher=Ashgate|year=1997|isbn=1840144556}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://image.berghof-foundation.org/fileadmin/redaktion/Publications/Handbook/Articles/smith_handbook.pdf|last=Smith|first=Dan|year=2003|chapter=Trends and Causes of Armed Conflicts|editor1-first=Alexander|editor1-last=Austin|editor2-first=Martina|editor2-last=Fischer|editor3-first=Norbert|editor3-last=Ropers|title=Berghof Handbook for Conflict Transformation|location=Berlin|publisher=Berghof Research Centre for Constructive Conflict Management/Berghof Foundation|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mass mobilization of ethnic groups can only be successful if there are latent ethnic differences to be exploited, otherwise politicians would not even attempt to make political appeals based on ethnicity and would focus instead on economic or ideological appeals. Hence, it is difficult to completely discount the role of inherent ethnic differences. Additionally, ethnic entrepreneurs, or elites, could be tempted to mobilize ethnic groups in order to gain their political support in democratizing states.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Voting to Violence: Democratization and Nationalist Conflict|last=Snyder|first=Jack|publisher=W. W. Norton &amp; Company|year=2000|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instrumentalists theorists especially emphasize this interpretation in ethnic states in which one ethnic group is promoted at the expense of other ethnicities.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Can Liberalism Be Exported?|last=Kymlicka|first=Wil|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, ethnic mass mobilization is likely to be plagued by collective action problems, especially if ethnic protests are likely to lead to violence. Instrumentalist scholars have tried to respond to these shortcomings. For example, Hardin{{Who|date=August 2017}} argues that ethnic mobilization faces problems of coordination and not collective action. He points out that a charismatic leader acts as a focal point around which members of an ethnic group coalesce. The existence of such an actor helps to clarify beliefs about the behavior of others within an ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=bCcEJte1irEC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=Peace+Studies:+Critical+Concepts+in+Political+Science,+Volume+3+By+Matthew+Evangelista&amp;ots=pXiCfd_4X9&amp;sig=0DzZtwPvp5Mo1NSjnA5zfr-onEk#v=onepage&amp;q=Peace%20Studies%3A%20Critical%20Concepts%20in%20Political%20Science%2C%20Volume%203%20By%20Matthew%20Evangelista&amp;f=false|title=Peace studies: Critical concepts in political science.|last=Evangelista|first=Matthew|date=2005|website=|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constructivist accounts===
A third, constructivist, set of accounts stress the importance of the socially constructed nature of ethnic groups, drawing on [[Benedict Anderson]]'s concept of the [[imagined community]]. Proponents of this account point to [[Rwanda]] as an example because  the [[Tutsi]]/[[Hutu]] distinction was codified by the [[Belgian colonial empire|Belgian colonial power]] in the 1930s on the basis of cattle ownership, physical measurements and church records. Identity cards were issued on this basis, and these documents played a key role in the [[Rwandan genocide|genocide]] of 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mahmood|last=Mamdani|year=2001|title=When Victims Become Killers: Colonialism, Nativism, and the Genocide in Rwanda|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691058210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some argue that constructivist narratives of historical master cleavages are unable to account for local and regional variations in ethnic violence. For example, Varshney highlights that in the 1960s "racial violence in the USA was heavily concentrated in northern cities; southern cities though intensely politically engaged, did not have riots".&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt; A constructivist master narrative is often a country level variable whereas we often have to study incidences of ethnic violence at the regional and local level.

Scholars of ethnic conflict and [[civil war]]s have introduced theories that draw insights from all three traditional schools of thought. In ''The Geography of Ethnic Violence'', for example, Monica Duffy Toft shows how ethnic group settlement patterns, socially constructed identities, charismatic leaders, issue indivisibility, and state concern with precedent setting can lead rational actors to escalate a dispute to violence, even when doing so is likely to leave contending groups much worse off.&lt;ref name="Toft"&gt;{{cite book |first=Monica Duffy|last=Toft|year=2003|title=The Geography of Ethnic Violence: Identity, Interests, and the Indivisibility of Territory|location=Princeton, NJ|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=0691113548}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such research addresses empirical puzzles that are difficult to explain using primordialist, instrumentalist, or constructivist approaches alone. As Varshney notes, "pure essentialists and pure instrumentalists do not exist anymore".&lt;ref name="Varshney2007" /&gt;

== Study in the post-Cold War world ==
The end of the Cold War thus sparked interest in two important questions about ethnic conflict: whether ethnic conflict was on the rise and whether given that some ethnic conflicts had escalated into serious violence, what, if anything, could scholars of large-scale violence (security studies, strategic studies, interstate politics) offer by way of explanation.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

One of the most debated issues relating to ethnic conflict is whether it has become more or less prevalent in the post–Cold War period. At the end of the Cold War, academics including [[Samuel P. Huntington]] and [[Robert D. Kaplan]] predicted a proliferation of conflicts fueled by [[Clash of Civilizations|civilisational clashes]], [[Tribalism]], [[Natural resource|resource]] [[scarcity]] and [[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Samuel P. |last=Huntington |year=1993 |url=http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html |title=The clash of civilizations? |journal=[[Foreign Affairs]] |volume=72 |issue=3 |pages=22–49 |doi=10.2307/20045621 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070629022856/http://www.foreignaffairs.org/19930601faessay5188/samuel-p-huntington/the-clash-of-civilizations.html |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert D.|last=Kaplan|year=1994|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/ideastour/archive/kaplan.mhtml|title=The coming anarchy|journal=[[The Atlantic Monthly]]|volume=273|issue=2|pages=44–76|access-date=2017-03-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724054203/http://www.theatlantic.com/ideastour/archive/kaplan.mhtml|archive-date=2008-07-24|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post–Cold War period has witnessed a number of ethnically-informed [[secessionist movements]], predominantly within the former communist states. Conflicts have involved secessionist movements in the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|former Yugoslavia]], [[Transnistria]] in [[Moldova]], [[Armenians]] in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Abkhaz people|Abkhaz]] and [[Ossetians]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Outside the former communist bloc, ethno-separatist strife in the same period has occurred in areas such as [[Sri Lanka]], [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], [[Chiapas]], [[East Timor]], the [[Basque Country (greater region)|Basque Country]], [[Catalonia]], [[Southern Sudan]] and Hazaras in Afghanistan under the Taliban.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}}

However, some theorists contend that this does not represent a rise in the incidence of ethnic conflict, because many of the [[proxy wars]] fought during the Cold War as ethnic conflicts were actually  hot spots of the Cold War. Research shows that the fall of [[Communism]] and the increase in the number of capitalist states were accompanied by a decline in total warfare, interstate wars, [[ethnic]] wars, [[revolutionary]] wars, and the number of [[refugees]] and [[displaced person]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Peter|last=Wallensteen|first2=Margareta|last2=Sollenberg|year=1995|doi=10.1177/0022343395032003007|title=After the Cold War: Emerging patterns of armed conflict 1989–94|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=32|issue=3|pages=345–360}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Lotta|last=Harbom|first2=Peter|last2=Wallensteen|year=2005|url=http://info.uu.se/press.nsf/166B1EC86A3FAF93C125706D0037D2E3/$File/JPRarticle.pdf|title=Armed conflict and its international dimensions, 1946–2004|journal=Journal of Peace Research|volume=42|issue=5|pages=623–635|doi=10.1177/0022343305056238|access-date=2007-02-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616093316/http://info.uu.se/press.nsf/166B1EC86A3FAF93C125706D0037D2E3/$File/JPRarticle.pdf|archive-date=2007-06-16|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://members.aol.com/CSPmgm/conflict.htm|title=Measuring systemic peace|publisher=Center for Systemic Peace|date=30 October 2006|accessdate=18 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, some scholars have questioned whether the concept of ethnic conflict is useful at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Bruce|last=Gilley|year=2004|doi=10.1080/0143659042000256959|title=Against the concept of ethnic conflict|journal=Third World Quarterly|volume=25|issue=6|pages=1155–1166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others have attempted to test the "clash of civilisations" thesis, finding it to be difficult to operationalise and that civilisational conflicts have not risen in intensity in relation to other ethnic conflicts since the end of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Jonathan|last=Fox|year=2002|doi=10.1017/S0007123402000170|title=Ethnic minorities and the Clash of Civilizations: A quantitative analysis of Huntington's thesis|journal=British Journal of Political Science|volume=32|issue=3|pages=415–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Giacomo|last=Chiozza|year=2002|jstor=1555255|title=Is there a Clash of Civilizations?

A key question facing scholars who attempt to adapt their theories of interstate violence to explain or predict large-scale ethnic violence is whether  ethnic groups could be considered "rational" actors.&lt;ref name="Kalyvas"&gt;{{cite book 
|first=Stathis N.|last=Kalyvas|year=2006|title=The Logic of Violence in Civil War|location=New York|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521854091}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to the end of the Cold War, the consensus among students of large-scale violence was that ethnic groups should be considered irrational actors, or semi-rational at best. If true, general explanations of ethnic violence would be impossible. In the years since, however, scholarly consensus has shifted to consider that ethnic groups may in fact be counted as rational actors, and the puzzle of their apparently irrational actions (for example, fighting over territory of little or no intrinsic worth) must therefore be explained in some other way.&lt;ref name="Toft" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kalyvas" /&gt; As a result, the possibility of a general explanation of ethnic violence has grown, and collaboration between comparativist and international-relations sub-fields has resulted in increasingly useful theories of ethnic conflict.

== Public goods provision ==
A major source of ethnic conflict in multi-ethnic democracies is over the access to state patronage. Conflicts over state resources between ethnic groups can increase the likelihood of ethnic violence. In ethnically divided societies, demand for public goods decreases as each ethnic group derives more utility from benefits targeted at their ethnic group in particular.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kolev, Wang|first=|date=2010|title=Ethnic Group Divisions and Clientelism|ssrn=1644406|journal=APSA Annual Meeting Paper|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These benefits would be less valued if all other ethnic groups had access to them.Targeted benefits are more appealing because ethnic groups can solidify or heighten their social and economic status relative to other ethnic groups whereas broad programmatic policies will not improve their relative worth. Politicians and political parties in turn, have an incentive to favor co-ethnics in their distribution of material benefits. Over the long run, ethnic conflict over access to state benefits is likely to lead to the ethnification of political parties and the party system as a whole where the political salience of ethnic identity increase leading to a self-fulfilling equilibrium: If politicians only distribute benefits on an ethnic basis, voters will see themselves primarily belonging to an ethnic group and view politicians the same way. They will only vote for the politician belonging to the same ethnic group. In turn, politicians will refrain from providing public goods because it will not serve them well electorally to provide services to people not belonging to their ethnic group. In democratizing societies, this could lead to ethnic outbidding and lead to extreme politicians pushing out moderate co-ethnics.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Patronage politics and ethnic politics eventually reinforce each other, leading to what Chandra terms a "patronage democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://politics.as.nyu.edu/docs/IO/2587/Chandra2007-CountingHeads.pdf|title=Patrons, clients, and policies: Patterns of democratic accountability and political competition|last=Kitschelt|first=Herbert|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The existence of patronage networks between local politicians and ethnic groups make it easier for politicians to mobilize ethnic groups and instigate ethnic violence for electoral gain since the neighborhood or city is already polarized along ethnic lines. The dependence of ethnic groups on their co-ethnic local politician for access to state resources is likely to make them more responsive to calls of violence against other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="Berenschot2010"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berenschot|first=Ward|date=2010|title=The Spatial Distribution of Riots: Patronage and the Instigation of Communal Violence in Gujarat, India|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/S0305750X10002019/1-s2.0-S0305750X10002019-main.pdf?_tid=6f3d0cfa-1365-11e6-820c-00000aab0f27&amp;acdnat=1462523886_331783388|journal=World Development|doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2009.11.029|access-date=|volume=39|pages=221–230}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, the existence of these local patronage channels generates incentives for ethnic groups to engage in politically motivated violence.&lt;ref name="Berenschot2010" /&gt;

While the link between ethnic heterogeneity and under provision of public goods is generally accepted, there is little consensus around the causal mechanism underlying this relationship. To identify possible causal stories, Humphreys and Habyarimana ran a serious of behavioral games in Kampala, Uganda that involved several local participants completing joint tasks and allocating money amongst them.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Habyaimana|first=James|date=November 2007|title=Why does ethnic diversity undermine public goods provision?|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~mh2245/papers1/HHPW.pdf|journal=American Political Science Review|doi=10.1017/S0003055407070499|access-date=|volume=101|pages=709–725}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to the conventional wisdom, they find that participants did not favor the welfare of their co-ethnics disproportionately. It was only when anonymity was removed and everyone's ethnicity was known did co-ethnics decide to favor each other. Humphreys and Habyarimana argue that cooperation among co-ethnics is primarily driven by reciprocity norms that tend to be stronger among co-ethnics.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; The possibility of social sanctions compelled those who would not otherwise cooperate with their co-ethnics to do so. The authors find no evidence to suggest that co-ethnics display a greater degree of altruism towards each other or have the same preferences. Ethnic cooperation takes place because co-ethnics have common social networks and therefore can monitor each other and can threaten to socially sanction any transgressors.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

== Institutional ethnic conflict resolution ==
A number of scholars have attempted to synthesize the methods available for the [[conflict resolution|resolution]], [[conflict management|management]] or [[conflict transformation|transformation]] of their ethnic conflict. [[John Coakley]], for example, has developed a [[wiktionary:Typology|typology]] of the methods of conflict resolution that have been employed by states, which he lists as: [[indigenization]], accommodation, [[Cultural assimilation|assimilation]], [[acculturation]], [[population transfer]], boundary alteration, [[genocide]] and ethnic suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coakley | first1 = John | year = 1992 | title = The resolution of ethnic conflict: Towards a typology | url = http://ips.sagepub.com/cgi/content/abstract/13/4/343 | journal = International Political Science Review | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 343–358 | doi=10.1177/019251219201300401}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John McGarry]] and [[Brendan O'Leary]] have developed a taxonomy of eight macro-political ethnic conflict regulation methods, which they note are often employed by states in combination with each other.&lt;ref&gt;John McGarry and Brendan O’Leary (1993) 'Introduction: The macro-political regulation of ethnic conflict’, in John McGarry and Brendan O’Leary (eds.) ''The Politics of Ethnic Conflict Regulation: Case Studies of Protracted Ethnic Conflicts'', London: Routledge, pp. 1-40&lt;/ref&gt; They include a number of methods that they note are clearly morally unacceptable.

With increasing interest in the field of ethnic conflict, many policy analysts and political scientists theorized potential resolutions and tracked the results of institutional policy implementation. As such, theories often focus on which [[Institutions]] are the most appropriate for addressing ethnic conflict.

=== Consociationalism ===
Consociationalism is a [[power sharing]] agreement which coopts the leaders of ethnic groups into the central state's government. Each nation or ethnic group is represented in the government through a supposed spokesman for the group. In the power sharing agreement, each group has veto powers to varying degrees, dependent on the particular state. Moreover, the norm of proportional representation is dominant: each group is represented in the government in a percentage that reflects the ethnicity's demographic presence in the state.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Containing Nationalism|last=Hechter|first=Michael|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2000|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another requirement for [[Arend Lijphart]] is that the government must be composed of a "grand coalition" of the ethnic group leaders which supposes a top-down approach to conflict resolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroschein|first=Sherrill|date=November 2014|title=Consociational Settlements and Reconstruction: Bosnia in Comparative Perspective (1995- Present)|url=|journal=Annals of the American Academy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In theory, this leads to self governance and protection for the ethnic group. Many scholars&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nationalism Reframed|last=Brubaker|first=Roger|publisher=Cambridge|year=1996|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kaufman|first=Stuart|date=Fall 1996|title=Spiraling to Ethnic War: Elites, Masses, and Moscow in Moldova's Civil War|url=|journal=International Security|doi=10.1162/isec.21.2.108|volume=21|pages=108–138}}&lt;/ref&gt; maintain that since ethnic tension erupts into ethnic violence when the ethnic group is threatened by a state, then veto powers should allow the ethnic group to avoid legislative threats. Switzerland is often characterized as a successful consociationalist state.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A recent example of a consociational government is the post-conflict [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian government]] that was agreed upon in the [[Dayton Agreement|Dayton Accords]] in 1995. A tripartite presidency was chosen and must have a Croat, a Serb, and a Bosniak. The presidents take turns acting as the forefront executive in terms of 8 months for 4 years.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many have credited this compromise of a consociational government in Bosnia for the end of the violence and the following long-lasting peace.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In contrast to Lijphart, several political scientists and policy analysts have condemned consociationalism.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Howard|first=Lisa Morje|date=October 2012|title=The Ethnocracy Trap|url=|journal=Journal of Democracy|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Reconstructing Multiethnic Societies: The Case of Bosnia-Hercegovina|last=Bieber|first=Florian|publisher=Ashgate Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=109–121|chapter=Challenge of Democracy in Divided Societies: Lessons from Bosnia-- Challenges for Kosovo}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the many critiques is that consociationalism locks in ethnic tensions and identities. This assumes a primordial stance that ethnic identities are permanent and not subject to change.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, this does not allow for any "others" that might want to partake in the political process.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  As of 2012 a Jewish Bosnian is suing the Bosnian government from precluding him from running for presidential office since only a Croat, Serb, or Bosniak can run under the consociational government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Guss|first=Jason|last2=Siroky|first2=David S.|date=2012|title=Living with Heterogeneity: Bridging the Ethnic Divide in Bosnia|url=|journal=Comparative Sociology|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Determining ethnic identities in advance and implementing a power sharing system on the basis of these fixed identities is inherently discriminatory against minority groups that might be not be recognized.&lt;ref name="RefError"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lijphart|first=Arend|date=Winter 2001|title=Constructivism and Consociational Theory|url=http://comparativenewsletter.com/files/archived_newsletters/2001_winter.pdf|journal=Newsletter of the Organized Section in Comparative Politics of the American Political Science Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, it discriminates against those who do not choose to define their identity on an ethnic or communal basis. In power sharing-systems that are based on pre-determined identities, there is a tendency to rigidly fix shares of representation on a permanent basis which will not reflect changing demographics over time.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; The categorization of individuals in particular ethnic groups might be controversial anyway and might in fact fuel ethnic tensions.

The inherent weaknesses in using pre-determined ethnic identities to form power sharing systems has led Ljiphart to argue that adopting a constructivist approach to consociationalism can increase its likelihood of success.&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; The self-determination of ethnic identities is more likely to be "non-discriminatory, neutral, flexible and self-adjusting."&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; For example, in South Africa, the toxic legacy of apartheid meant that successful consociation could only be built on the basis of the self-determination of groups. Ljiphart claims that because ethnic identities are often "unclear, fluid and flexible,"&lt;ref name="RefError"/&gt; self-determination is likely to be more successful than pre-determination of ethnic groups.  A constructivist approach to consociational theory can therefore strengthen its value as a method to resolve ethnic conflict.

Another critique points to the privileging of ethnic identity over personal political choice.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Howard has deemed consociationalism as a form of ethnocracy and not a path to true pluralistic democracy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Consociationalism assumes that a politician will best represent the will of his co-ethnics above other political parties. This might lead to the polarization of ethnic groups and the loss of non-ethnic ideological parties.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stroschein|first=Sherill|date=December 2008|title=Making or Breaking Kosovo: Applications of Dispersed State Control|url=|journal=Perspectives on Politics|doi=10.1017/s153759270808184x|pmid=|access-date=|volume=6|page=655}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Horowitz has argued that a single transferable vote system could prevent the ethnification of political parties because voters cast their ballots in order of preference.&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Democratic South Africa? Constitutional Engineering in a Divided Society|last=Horowitz|first=Donald|publisher=University of California Press|year=1992|isbn=|location=|pages=167–173}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that a voter could cast some of his votes to parties other than his co-ethnic party.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; This in turn would compel political parties to broaden their manifestos to appeal to voters across the ethnic divide to hoover up second and third preference votes.

=== Federalism ===
The theory of implementing federalism in order to curtail ethnic conflict assumes that self-governance reduces "demands for sovereignty".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hechter argues that some goods such as language of education and bureaucracy must be provided as local goods, instead of statewide, in order to satisfy more people and ethnic groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Some political scientists such as Stroschein contend that [[ethnic federalism|ethnofederalism]], or federalism determined along ethnic lines, is "asymmetric" as opposed to the equal devolution of power found in non-ethnic federal states, such as the United States. In this sense, special privileges are granted to specific minority groups as concessions and incentives to end violence or mute conflict.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

The [[Soviet Union]] divided its structure into ethno-federal sub-states termed [[Republics of the Soviet Union|Union Republics]]. The sub-state was named after a titular minority who inhabited the area as a way to Sovietize nationalist sentiments during the 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Revenge of the Past Nationalism, Revolution, and the Collapse of the Soviet Union|last=Suny|first=Ronald|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1993|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brubaker asserts that these titular republics were formed in order to absorb any potential elite led nationalist movements against the Soviet center by incentivizing elite loyalty through advancement in the Soviet political structure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Thus, federalism provides some self-governance for local matters in order to satisfy some of the grievances which might cause ethnic conflict among the masses. Moreover, federalism brings in the elites and ethnic entrepreneurs into the central power structure; this prevents a resurgence of top-down ethnic conflict.

Nevertheless, after the fall of the [[Soviet Union|USSR]] many critiques of federalism as an institution to resolve ethnic conflict emerged. The devolution of power away from the central state can weaken ties to the central state.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Moreover, the parallel institutions created to serve a particular nation or ethnic group might provide significant resources for [[Secession]] from the central state.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bunce|first=Valerie|date=1998|title=Subversive Institutions: The End of Soviet State in Comparative Perspective|url=|journal=Post-Soviet Affairs|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Derluguian|first=Georgi M.|date=1999|title=Ethnofederalism and Ethnonationalism: The Separatist politics of Chechnya and Tatarstan: Sources or Resources?|url=|journal=International Journal of Public Administration|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As most states are unwilling to give up an integral portion of their territory, secessionist movements may trigger violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Rights of Minority Cultures|last=Buchanan|first=Allen|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=1995|isbn=|editor-last=Kymlicka|editor-first=Will|location=|pages=|chapter=Morality of Secession}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, some competing elite political players may not be in power; they would remain unincorporated into the central system. These competing elites can gain access through federal structures and their resources to solidify their political power in the structure.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; According to V.P. Gagnon this was the case in the former [[Yugoslavia]] and its violent disintegration into its ethno-federal sub-states. Ethnic entrepreneurs were able to take control of the institutionally allocated resources to wage war on other ethnic groups.&lt;ref name="RefError2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Myth of Ethnic War: Serbia and Croatia in the 1990s|last=Gagnon|first=V.P.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=2004|url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100628500}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-territorial autonomy ===
A recent theory of ethnic tension resolution is non-territorial autonomy or NTA. NTA has emerged in recent years as an alternative solution to ethnic tensions and grievances in places that are likely to breed conflict.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osipov|first=Alexander|date=2013|title=Non-Territorial Autonomy during and after Communism: In the Wrong or Right Place?|url=|journal=Journal on Ethnopolitics and Minority Issues in Europe|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, NTA has been promoted as a more practical and state building solution than consociationalism.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; NTA, alternatively known as non-cultural autonomy (NCA), is based on the difference of ''[[jus soli]]s'' and ''jus sanguinis,'' the principles of territory versus that of personhood.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coakley|first=John|date=1994|title=Approaches to the Resolution of Ethnic Conflict: The Strategy of Non-territorial Autonomy|url=|journal=International Political Science Review|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gives rights to ethnic groups to self-rule and govern matters potentially concerning but limited to: education, language, culture, internal affairs, religion, and the internally established institutions needed to promote and reproduce these facets.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.stefanwolff.com/files/ConsociationalTheoryPaper.pdf|title=A Consociational Theory of Conflict Management|last=Wolff|first=Stefan|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to federalism, the ethnic groups are not assigned a titular sub-state, but rather the ethnic groups are dispersed throughout the state unit. Their group rights and autonomy are not constrained to a particular territory within the state. This is done in order not to weaken the center state such as in the case of ethnofederalism.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The origin of NTA can be traced back to the Marxists works of [[Otto Bauer]] and [[Karl Renner]].&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Challenge of Non-Territorial Autonomy: Theory and Practice|last=Smith|first=David J.|publisher=Peter Lang|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Challenges of Non-Territorial Autonomy in Contemporary Central and Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt; NTA was employed during the interwar period, and the League of Nations sought to add protection clauses for national minorities in new states.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In the 1920s, [[Estonia]] granted some cultural autonomy to the German and Jewish populations in order to ease conflicts between the groups and the newly independent state.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

In Europe, most notably in [[Belgium]], NTA laws have been enacted and created parallel institutions and political parties in the same country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dalle Mulle|first=Emmanuel|date=2016|title=Belgium and the Brussels Question: The Role of Non-Territorial Autonomy|url=|journal=Ethnopolitics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Belgium, NTA has been integrated within the federal consociational system.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Some scholars of ethnic conflict resolution claim that the practice of NTA will be employed dependent on the concentration and size of the ethnic group asking for group rights.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

Other scholars, such as Clarke, argue that the successful implementation of NTA rests on the acknowledgement in a state of "universal" principles: true [[Rule of law|Rule of Law]], established [[human rights]], stated guarantees to minorities and their members to use their own quotidien language, religion, and food practices, and a framework of anti-discrimination legislation in order to enforce these rights.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Challenge of Non-Territorial Autonomy|last=Clarke|first=Charles|publisher=Peter Lang|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=|chapter=Preface: Using the Ideas of 'Non-Territorial Autonomy' to Avoid Violent Conflict and Meet the Modern Challenges of Nationalism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, no individual can be forced to adhere, identify, or emphasize a particular identity (such as race, gender, sexuality, etc.) without their consent in order for NTA to function for its purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Identity and Violence: The Illusion of Destiny|last=Sen|first=Amartya|publisher=Penguin|year=2007|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, Clarke critiques the weaknesses of NTA in areas such as education, a balance between society wide norms and intracommunity values; policing, for criminal matters and public safety; and political representation, which limits the political choices of an individual if based solely on ethnicity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Furthermore, the challenge in evaluating the efficacy of NTA lies in the relatively few legal implementations of NTA.

===Cultural rights===
Emphasizing the limits of approaches that focus mainly on institutional answers to ethnic conflicts—which are essentially driven by ethnocultural dynamics of which political and/or economic factors are but elements—Gregory Paul Meyjes urges the use of intercultural communication and cultural-rights based negotiations as tools with which to effectively and sustainably address inter-ethnic strife. Meyjes argues that to fully grasp, preempt, and/or resolve such conflicts—whether with or without the aid of territorial or non-territorial institutional mechanism(s) -- a [[cultural rights]] approach grounded in intercultural knowledge and skill is essential.&lt;ref&gt;Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul (2012) 'Multi-Ethnic Conflicts in U.S. Military Theatres Overseas: Intercultural Imperatives', in Volker Franke and Robert H. "Robin" Dorff (eds.) ''Conflict Management: A Tool for U.S. National Security Strategy'', Carlisle, PA: Strategic Studies Institute, U.S. Army War College, pp. 381-438&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; Meyjes (also: Posthumus Meyjes), Gregory Paul (2007) 'Plan "C" is for Culture: out of Iraq – Opportunity,' Landpower Essay 07-4, May 2007, Arlington, VA: Association of the United States Army.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethnic conflict resolution outside formal institutions ==

=== Informal inter-ethnic engagement ===
Institutionalist arguments for resolving ethnic conflict often focus on national-level institutions and do not account for regional and local variation in ethnic violence within a country. Despite similar levels of ethnic diversity in a country, some towns and cities have often found to be especially prone to ethnic violence. For example, Ashutosh Varshney, in his study of ethnic violence in [[India]], argues that strong inter-ethnic engagement in villages often disincentivizes politicians from stoking ethnic violence for electoral gain.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=April 2001|title=Ethnic Conflict and Civil Society: India and Beyond|url=http://www.cridaq.uqam.ca/IMG/pdf/varshney_civil_society_copy_1_Jacques_Bertrand.pdf|journal=World Politics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal interactions include joint participation in festivals, families from different communities eating together or allowing their children to play with one another.&lt;ref name=":16"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Varshney|first=Ashutosh|date=April 2001|title=Ethnic Conflict and Civil Society: India and Beyond|url=http://www.cridaq.uqam.ca/IMG/pdf/varshney_civil_society_copy_1_Jacques_Bertrand.pdf|journal=World Politics|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every day engagement between ethnic groups at the village level can help to sustain the peace in the face of  national level shocks like an ethnic riot in another part of the country.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In times of ethnic tension, these communities can quell rumors, police neighborhoods and come together to resist any attempts by politicians to polarize the community.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; The stronger the inter-ethnic networks are, the harder it is for politicians to polarize the community even if it may be in their political interest to do so.

=== Formal inter-ethnic associations ===
However, in cities, where the population tends to be much higher, informal interactions between ethnic groups might not be sufficient to prevent violence. This is because many more links are needed to connect everyone, and therefore it is much more difficult to form and strengthen inter-ethnic ties.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; In cities, formal inter-ethnic associations like trade unions, business associations and professional organizations are more effective in encouraging inter-ethnic interactions that could prevent ethnic violence in the future.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; These organizations force ethnic groups to come together based on shared economic interests that overcomes any pre-existing ethnic differences. For example, inter-ethnic business organizations serve to connect the business interests of different ethnic groups which would increase their desire to maintain ethnic harmony. Any ethnic tension or outbreak of violence will go against their economic interests and therefore, over time, the salience of ethnic identity diminishes.

Interactions between ethnic groups in formal settings can also help countries torn apart by ethnic violence to recover and break down ethnic divisions. Paula Pickering, a political scientist, who studies peace-building efforts in Bosnia, finds that formal workplaces are often the site where inter-ethnic ties are formed.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pickering|first=Paula|date=January 2006|title=Generating social capital for bridging ethnic divisions in the Balkans: Case studies of two Bosniak cities|url=http://people.wm.edu/~pmpick/research/EthnicRacialStudiesPickering.pdf|journal=Ethnic and Racial Studies|doi=10.1080/01419870500352397|pmid=|access-date=|volume=29|pages=79–103}}&lt;/ref&gt; She claims that mixed workplaces lead to repeated inter-ethnic interaction where norms of professionalism compel everyone to cooperate and to treat each other with respect, making it easier for individuals belonging to the minority group to reach out and form relationships with everyone else.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt; Nevertheless, Giuliano's research in Russia has shown that economic grievances, even in a mixed workplace, can be politicized on ethnic lines.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

[[Category:Wars by type]]

&lt;!--for some reason we have a category called "Ethnic conflict" and another called"Ethnic conflicts". The reason is presumably the polysemy of the term "conflict", the former is indending the wider sense of 'conflict' as any clash of interests, the second is using it in the sense of "armed, open conflict". This should be fixed, the categories should be named more clearly --&gt;

The code of [[etiquette]] in [[Myanmar]], or the code of social behavior that governs human interactions, is largely derived from [[Theravada Buddhism]].{{sfn|Oo|2006|p=5}} and focuses on the core values of this religion. Like many social cultures, [[etiquette]] varies greatly depending on one's status relative to the person in question. Some [[Convention (norm)|conventions]] may be very regional practices, and thus may not exist in all regions of Myanmar. Some customs have changed over the course of [[Burmese history]].  The following are generally accepted modern customs in Myanmar.

==Cultural overview==
[[File:Burmese family portrait.JPG|thumb|right|Burmese Family Portrait]]
'''Myanmar''' is a [[sovereign state]] located in the [[Southeast Asia]]n region. Myanmar is bordered by [[India]] and [[Bangladesh]] to its west, [[Thailand]] and [[Laos]] to its east and [[China]] to its north and northeast. Its capital city is [[Naypyidaw]], and its largest city and former capital is [[Yangon]] (Rangoon).&lt;ref name="CIA geos"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html|title=The World Factbook&amp;nbsp;– Burma |publisher=cia.gov |access-date=4 May 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tygEnlqv?url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/bm.html |archivedate=4 November 2010 |df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myanmar has been a member of the [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN) since 1997.

Early civilisations in Myanmar included the [[Tibeto-Burman languages|Tibeto-Burman]]-speaking [[Pyu city-states]] in [[Upper Burma]] and the [[Mon kingdoms]] in [[Lower Burma]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Early civilizations of Southeast Asia | publisher=Altamira Press | author=O'Reilly, Dougald JW | year=2007 | location=United Kingdom | isbn=0-7591-0279-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 9th century, the [[Bamar people]] entered the upper [[Irrawaddy River|Irrawaddy]] valley and, following the establishment of the [[Pagan Kingdom]] in the 1050s, the [[Burmese language]], [[Culture of Burma|culture]] and [[Theravada]] [[Buddhism]] slowly became dominant in the country. The Pagan Kingdom fell due to the [[First Mongol invasion of Burma|Mongol invasions]] and several warring states emerged. In the 16th century, reunified by the [[Taungoo Dynasty]], the country was for a brief period the largest empire in the [[history of Southeast Asia|history of Mainland Southeast Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Lieberman|Lieberman]], p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; The early 19th century [[Konbaung Dynasty]] ruled over an area that included modern Myanmar and briefly controlled [[Manipur]] and [[Assam]] as well. The British took over the administration of Myanmar after three [[Anglo-Burmese Wars]] in the 19th century and the country became a [[British rule in Burma|British colony]]. Myanmar was [[Independence Day (Myanmar)|granted independence]] in 1948, as a [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|democratic nation]]. Following a [[1962 Burmese coup d'état|coup d'état in 1962]], it became a [[Burma Socialist Programme Party|military dictatorship]].  

Myanmar's recent [[political]] history is underlined by its struggle to establish [[Democracy|democratic]] structures amidst conflicting fractions. This political transition from a closely held [[military]] rule to a free democratic system is widely believed to be determining the future of Myanmar. The resounding victory of [[Aung San Suu Kyi]]'s National League for Democracy in 2015 general elections has raised hope for a successful culmination of this transition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://asianleadershipcentre.org/asian-review/myanmar-under-transition | title=Myanmar under Transition |publisher=Asian Review | access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-36732270 | title=Hundred days of Myanmar's democracy |publisher=BBC | access-date=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Names==
===Addressing others===
The [[Myanmar language]] has various ways to address people of different ranks, ages, and relationships.  There are no [[surnames]] or first names to properly address a person by.  To address a grown person older than oneself, a Burmese person would use '''"U"''' for adult males and '''"Daw"''' for adult females. For addressing younger males or male peers, the titles '''"Ko"''' or '''"Maung"''' are used, and for younger females or  female peers, '''"Ma"''' is used. Senior officials and teachers are addressed as '''"Saya."'''  This goes back to [[Buddhist ethics|Buddhist teaching]], where parents and teachers are second only to the [[Three Jewels]] ({{my|ရတနာသုံးပါး}} ''yadana thoun ba''), together making up the Five Boundless Beneficence ({{my|အနန္တငါးပါး}} ''ananda nga ba''). Using the proper form is an indication to how well bred and correct the speaker is as well as to the status of the individual being addressed. {{sfn|Win|2014|p=112-113}}

===Referring to oneself===
Personal pronouns in the [[Burmese language]] are gendered. A male would refer to himself as  '''"Kyun-daw"'''. A female would refer to herself as '''"Kyun-ma"'''.  When speaking to a [[Buddhist monk|monk]], proper etiquette demands that one change their personal pronoun to '''"Da-pyi-daw"'''. When an elder or superior calls a male, the male will respond with '''"Khin-bya"'''.  Likewise, a female would respond with '''"Shin"'''.{{sfn|Win|2014|p=116-117}}  

==Religion==
[[File:Monk examinations, Bago, Myanmar.jpg|thumb|right|Myanmar Monks]]
As a predominantly Buddhist country, much deference is given to monks.  It is rude to stand on a monk's shadow or point one's feet at a monk.  It is also forbidden for a female to touch a monk.  Shoes are always taken off upon entering homes, monasteries and pagoda compounds. A custom of the Burmese is to perambulate clockwise ({{my|လက်ယာရစ်}} ''let ya yit'') around a pagoda, not counterclockwise ({{my|လက်ဝဲရစ်}} ''let wè yit'')..&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.goabroad.com/articles/volunteer-abroad/10-ways-not-to-offend-burmese-culture|title=Go Abroad:10 Ways Not To Offend Burmese Culture |accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Table manners==
When dining at home, it is not custom to drink alcoholic beverages with meals. Serving spoons are taken with the left hand. Diners begin to eat only after all of the food has been placed on the table, with the eldest served first. In their absence a spoonful of rice is put aside first in the pot as a token of respect ({{my|ဦးချ}} ''u cha'') before serving the meal.  Modern cutlery has become common, though some choose to eat in the traditional way with their fingers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://traveltips.usatoday.com/customs-myanmar-11380.html|title=USAToday: What Are the Customs of Myanmar?|accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hygiene==
In Myanmar, the upper parts of the body, especially the head and face, are considered sacred, while the lower parts, especially the feet, are considered dirty. The Burmese separate things used for the face and head from things used for the lower body, such as towels, cleaning basins, and soaps. Furthermore, underwear is not raised above head level, and a woman's lower body clothes, such as the traditional [[Longyi]], are not placed to dry or hang in areas that a male or a monk may pass, such as upper levels of corridors.

Rules of etiquette regarding the feet are numerous.  Using the water from a public drinking pot to rinse off one's feet is considered an insult.  Feet, no matter how clean, are never placed on bed pillows.  It is also  considered rude to sit on top of a pillow designated for the head.  Gesturing with the feet is also regarded as an insult.  The Burmese are careful of which direction their feet point, and take pains not to point their feet towards Buddha’s image, elders, or religious sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://myanmar2day.com/myanmar-culture-custom/2008/12/myanmar-etiquette-general-rules/|title=Myanmar 2Day:Myanmar Etiquette – General Rules |accessdate=2017-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Business etiquette==
[[File:Central Business District 05.jpg|thumb|right|Central Business District in Yangon]]
Many offices in Myanmar are shoes-free areas. Shoes are worn from the street into public hallways and foyers, but then removed at the door of the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://multiverseadvertising.com/myanmar-business-etiquette-dos-donts-meetings-burma/|title= Myanmar Business Etiquette |accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hand shakes are common and standard, with both hands being used an acceptable practice.  If a businesswoman initiates a handshake, it is acceptable for a male to shake it, but a male would not not initiate a handshake with a woman.  If a handshake is not initiated by a woman, a male may instead make a small bow.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.go-myanmar.com/doing-business-in-myanmar|title=Go Myanmar: Doing business in Myanmar|accessdate=2017-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ana==
{{main|Anade}}
Burmese society operates on ''[[Anade|ana]]'' ({{my|အားနာမှု}}), a characteristic or feeling that has no English equivalent. It is characterized by a hesitation, reluctance or avoidance, to perform an action based on the fear that it will offend someone or cause someone to lose face or become embarrassed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.myanmar.gov.mm/Perspective/persp2001/1-2001/nar.htm{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, there is the concept of ''hpon'' ({{my|ဘုန်း}}; from Sanskrit ''bhaga''), which translates to "power". It is used as an explanation for the varying degrees of ethnic, socioeconomic, and gender differences between people in a society.&lt;ref name="cav"&gt;{{cite book |title=World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia |editor=Marshall Cavendish Publishing |year=2007 |publisher=Marshall Cavendish |isbn=978-0-7614-7631-3 |pages=630–640 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=29 August 2010--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
''Hpon'' refers to the cumulative result of past deeds, an idea that power or social position comes from merit earned in previous lives.&lt;ref name="cav"/&gt; This idea is used to justify the prevalent view that women are lesser than men, who are considered to have more ''hpon''.

==Respect for age==
Children are taught from young 'to venerate one's elders, to respect one's peers, and to be kind to the young and weak' ({{my|ကြီးသူကိုရိုသေ၊ ရွယ်သူကိုလေးစား၊ ငယ်သူကိုသနား။}} ''kyeethu go yothei, ywedu go layza, ngethu go thana''). Young people would avoid sitting on a higher level than the elders or passing in front of them unless unavoidable, and then only treading softly with a slight bow. Things would be passed to the elders using both hands together. Men may cross their legs sitting on a chair or a mat but women generally would not.Parents are believed to be solely responsible for their children's behaviour as reflected by the expressions: ''mi ma hsonma, hpa ma hsonma'' ({{my|မိမဆုံးမ ဖမဆုံးမ}} undisciplined either by mother or by father) and ''ami youk tau hnoukkyan, ahpa youk tau ko amu-aya kyan'' (bad language from bad mother, bad body-language from bad father). Saying "thank you" however is not Burmese custom between friends and within the family.

==Physical touch==
Physical demonstrations of affection in public are common between friends of the same gender or between members of the family, but seldom seen between lovers. It is thus common to see friends walking together holding hands or with arms round each other, but couples rarely do so, except in major cities.

It is considered rude to touch a person's [[Human head|head]], because it is the "highest" point of the body. It is also considered taboo to touch another's feet, but worse still to point with the foot or sit with feet pointing at someone older, because the feet are considered the lowest. Also, pointing a finger at Buddha images is considered blasphemous, although this custom has slowly eroded.

In [[mathematics]], the '''Fabry gap theorem''' is a result about the [[analytic continuation]] of [[complex number|complex]] [[power series]] whose non-zero terms are of orders that have a certain "gap" between them. Such a power series is "badly behaved" in the sense that it cannot be extended to be an [[analytic function]] anywhere on the [[boundary (topology)|boundary]] of its [[radius of convergence|disc of convergence]].

The theorem may be deduced from the first main theorem of [[Turán's method]].

==Statement of the theorem==

Let 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;... be a [[sequence]] of [[integer]]s such that the sequence ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'' diverges to ∞.  Let (''&amp;alpha;''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''j''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt; be a sequence of complex numbers such that the power series

:&lt;math&gt;f(z) = \sum_{j \in \mathbf{N}} \alpha_{j} z^{p_{j}}&lt;/math&gt;

has radius of convergence 1. Then the unit circle is a [[natural boundary]] for the series ''f''.

==Converse==
A converse to the theorem was established by [[George Pólya]].  If lim inf ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;/''n'' is finite then there exists a power series with exponent sequence ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, radius of convergence equal to 1, but for which the unit circle is not a natural boundary.

{{distinguish|Food safety}}
'''Food security''' is a condition related to the availability of food, and individuals' accessibility and affordability to it. There is evidence of  being in use over 10,000 years ago, with central authorities in civilizations   [[ancient China]] and [[ancient Egypt]] being known to release food from storage in times of famine. At the 1974 [[World Food Conference]] the term "food security" was defined with an emphasis on supply. Food security, they said, is the "availability at all times of adequate, nourishing, diverse, balanced and moderate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Trade Reforms and Food Security: Conceptualizing the Linkages|date=2003 |publisher=FAO, UN|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/005/y4671e/y4671e06.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later definitions added demand and access issues to the definition. The final report of the 1996 World Food Summit states that food security "exists when all people, at all times, have physical and economic access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food to meet their dietary needs and food preferences for an active and healthy life".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

The 1996 World Summit on Food Security declared that "food should not be used as an instrument for political and economic pressure".&lt;ref name="FAO 1996" /&gt; According to the [[International Centre for Trade and Sustainable Development]], failed agriculture market regulation and the lack of anti-dumping mechanisms cause much of the world's food scarcity and [[malnutrition]].

==Measurement==
Food security can be measured by calorie intake per person per day, available on a household budget.&lt;ref name="Webb et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webb |first=P |author2=Coates, J. |author3=Frongillo, E.

While availability (production and supply) and utilization/adequacy (nutritional status/anthropometric measures) seemed much easier to estimate, thus more popular, access (ability to acquire sufficient quantity and quality) remain largely elusive.&lt;ref name=Barrett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=C.

Food insecurity is measured in the United States by questions in the Census Bureau's [[Current Population Survey]]. The questions asked are about anxiety that the household budget is inadequate to buy enough food, inadequacy in the quantity or quality of food eaten by adults and children in the household, and instances of reduced food intake or consequences of reduced food intake for adults and for children.&lt;ref&gt;USDA, Food Security Measurement. {{cite web|url=http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsec/Measurement.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110107021306/http://www.fns.usda.gov/fsec/Measurement.htm |archivedate=2011-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] study commissioned by the USDA criticized this measurement and the relationship of "food security" to hunger, adding "it is not clear whether hunger is appropriately identified as the extreme end of the food security scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nap.edu/catalog/11227.html |title=Measuring Food Insecurity and Hunger: Phase 1 Report |publisher=Nap.edu |accessdate=2011-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[FAO]], [[World Food Programme]] (WFP), and [[International Fund for Agricultural Development]] (IFAD) collaborate to produce ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World''. The 2012 edition described improvements made by the FAO to the prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) indicator that is used to measure rates of food insecurity. New features include revised minimum dietary energy requirements for individual countries, updates to the [[world population]] data, and estimates of food losses in retail distribution for each country. Measurements that factor into the indicator include dietary energy supply, food production, food prices, food expenditures, and volatility of the [[food system]].&lt;ref name="FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=FAO, WFP, and IFAD|title=The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012|year=2012|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/016/i3027e/i3027e.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[famine scales|stages of food insecurity]] range from food secure situations to full-scale [[famine]].&lt;ref name="Ayalew"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ayalew|first=Melaku|title=Food Security and Famine and Hunger|url=http://www.cnisbss.org/Newsline/PDF/LJR_19092007/Food%20Security,%20Famine%20&amp;%20Hunger(1).pdf|accessdate=21 October 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131021163123/http://www.cnisbss.org/Newsline/PDF/LJR_19092007/Food%20Security%2C%20Famine%20%26%20Hunger%281%29.pdf|archivedate=21 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A new peer-reviewed journal, ''Food Security: The Science, Sociology and Economics of Food Production and Access to Food'', began publishing in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.springer.com/life+sciences/agriculture/journal/12571 |title=Food Security: The Science, Sociology and Economics of Food Production and Access to Food |publisher=Springer.com |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With its prevalence of undernourishment (PoU) indicator, the FAO reported that almost 870 million people were chronically undernourished in the years 2010–2012. This represents 12.5% of the global population, or 1 in 8 people. Higher rates occur in developing countries, where 852 million people (about 15% of the population) are chronically undernourished. The report noted that Asia and Latin America have achieved reductions in rates of undernourishment that put these regions on track for achieving the Millennium Development Goal of halving the prevalence of undernourishment by 2015.&lt;ref name="FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012" /&gt; The UN noted that about 2 billion people do not consume a sufficient amount of vitamins and minerals.&lt;ref name="UN World Food Day"&gt;{{cite news|last=UN|title=Sustainable food systems vital to end hunger, malnutrition, UN says on World Food Day|url=https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=46269&amp;Cr=Food+Security&amp;Cr1=#.UnVdOxZc_cN|accessdate=2 November 2013|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In India, the second-most populous country in the world, 30 million people have been added to the ranks of the hungry since the mid-1990s and 46% of children are [[underweight]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/in_depth/8309979.stm |title=Mixed messages in hunger report |publisher=BBC News |date=October 16, 2009 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples of food insecurity==
[[Famine]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s have been frequent in world history. Some have killed millions and substantially diminished the population of a large area. The most common causes have been [[drought]] and war, but the greatest famines in history were caused by [[economic policy]].

{{Main|Food security in Mexico}}
Food insecurity has distressed Mexico throughout its history and continues to do so in the present. Food availability is not the issue; rather, severe deficiencies in the accessibility of food contributes to the insecurity. Between 2003 and 2005, the total Mexican food supply was well above the sufficient to meet the requirements of the Mexican population, averaging 3,270 kilocalories per daily capita, higher than the minimum requirements of 1,850 kilocalories per daily capita. However, at least 10 percent of the population in every Mexican state suffers from inadequate food access. In nine states, 25–35 percent live in food-insecure households. More than 10 percent of the populations of seven Mexica states fall into the category of [[Integrated Food Security Phase Classification|Serious Food Insecurity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Security and Nutrition in Mexico|url=https://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Food%20Security%20and%20Nutrition%20in%20Mexico_Mexico_Mexico_7-9-2010.pdf|accessdate=27 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of food inaccessibility is magnified by chronic child malnutrition as well as [[obesity]] in children, adolescents, and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Urquía-Fernández|first1=Nuria|title=Food security in Mexico|url=http://www.scielosp.org/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0036-36342014000700014&amp;lng=en&amp;nrm=iso&amp;tlng=en|website=Salud Pública de México|pages=s92–s98|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
{{further|Hunger in the United States}}
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] defines food insecurity as "limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways."&lt;ref name=Measurement_US /&gt; Food security is defined by the USDA as "access by all people at all times to enough food for an active, healthy life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Security in the U.S.|url=https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/|publisher=Economic Research Service|accessdate=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Food Insecurity by Household.png|right|Food Insecurity by Household]]
National Food Security Surveys are the main survey tool used by the USDA to measure [[food security in the United States]]. Based on respondents' answers to survey questions, the household can be placed on a continuum of food security defined by the USDA. This continuum has four categories: high food security, marginal food security, low food security, and very low food security.&lt;ref name=Measurement_US&gt;{{cite web|title=Food Security in the U.S.|url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/measurement.aspx|publisher=Economic Research Service|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Economic Research Service]] report number 155 (ERS-155) estimates that 14.5 percent (17.6 million) of US households were food insecure at some point in 2012. The prevalence of food insecurity has been relatively in the United States since the economic recession 2008.

In 2016:&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ers.usda.gov/topics/food-nutrition-assistance/food-security-in-the-us/key-statistics-graphics.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;
* 12.3 percent (15.6 million) of U.S. households were food insecure at some time during 2016.
* 7.4 percent (9.4 million) of U.S. households had low food security in 2016.
* 4.9 percent (6.1 million) of U.S. households had very low food security at some time during 2016.
* Both children and adults were food insecure in 8.0 percent of households with children (3.1 million households).

===Democratic Republic of Congo===

The Democratic Republic of Congo is the second largest country in Africa; the country is dealing with food insecurity. Although they have an abundance of natural resources, they lack accessibility of essential foods makes it difficult for the Congolese people in their daily lives. Malnutrition is high among children affects their ability, and children who live in a rural area are affected more than children who are live in an urban area.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bmcpublichealth.biomedcentral.com/track/pdf/10.1186/1471-2458-11-261].&lt;/ref&gt;. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, about 33% of households is food insecure; it is 60% in eastern provinces.
&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;[ https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0085327#s3 ].&lt;/ref&gt;.  A study showed the correlation of food insecurity negatively affecting at-risk  HIV adults in the Democratic Republic of Congo.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;.  

In 2007-2008 grain prices increased and the people in the Democratic Republic of the Congo went to civil unrest, there were riots and protest. Hunger is frequent in this country, but sometimes it is to the extreme that many families cannot afford to eat every day. &lt;ref&gt;.[http://www.earth-policy.org/images/uploads/book_images/FullPlanetAllChaps.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;. Bushmeat trade was used to measure the trend of food security. The trend signifies the amount of consumption in urban and rural areas. Urban areas mainly consume bushmeat because they cannot afford other types of meat. &lt;ref&gt;.[https://www.cambridge.org/core/services/aop-cambridge-core/content/view/9E1A7707926AFA122CBDD207A2A0FE13/S0030605311000202a.pdf/bushmeat_market_in_kisangani_democratic_republic_of_congo_implications_for_conservation_and_food_security.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;.

== World Summit on Food Security ==
The World Summit on Food Security, held in Rome in 1996, aimed to renew a global commitment to the fight against hunger. The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) called the summit in response to widespread under-nutrition and growing concern about the capacity of agriculture to meet future food needs. The conference produced two key documents, the Rome Declaration on World Food Security and the World Food Summit Plan of Action.&lt;ref name="FAO 1996"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rome Declaration on Food Security and World Food Summit Plan of Action|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/003/w3613e/w3613e00.htm|accessdate=26 October 2013|author=Food and Agriculture Organization|year=November 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/icd/summit/basic.html |title=World Food Summit: Basic Information |publisher=Fas.usda.gov |date=February 22, 2005 |accessdate=2011-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204092639/http://www.fas.usda.gov/icd/summit/basic.html |archivedate=2011-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rome Declaration called for the members of the United Nations to work to halve the number of chronically undernourished people on the Earth by the year 2015. The Plan of Action set a number of targets for government and non-governmental organizations for achieving food security, at the individual, household, national, regional and global levels.

Another World Summit on Food Security took place at the FAO's headquarters in Rome between November 16 and 18, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/fileadmin/templates/wsfs/Summit/Docs/Declaration/WSFS09_Draft_Declaration.pdf|title=World Summit on Food Security|last=|first=|date=2009|website=fao.org|format=PDF|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The decision to convene the summit was taken by the Council of [[FAO]] in June 2009, at the proposal of FAO Director-General Dr [[Jacques Diouf]]. Heads of state and government attended this summit.

==Pillars of food security==

[[File:FAO kcal his.png|thumb|Growth of World Food Supply (caloric base) per capita]]
The WHO states that there are three pillars that determine food security: food availability, food access, and food use and misuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WHO|title=Food Security|url=http://www.who.int/trade/glossary/story028/en/|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FAO adds a fourth pillar: the stability of the first three dimensions of food security over time.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; In 2009, the World Summit on Food Security stated that the "four pillars of food security are availability, access, utilization, and stability".&lt;ref name="autogenerated2009" /&gt;

===Availability===
Food availability relates to the supply of food through production, distribution, and exchange.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gregory|first=P. J.|author2=Ingram, J. S.

Because food consumers outnumber producers in every country,&lt;ref name="Tweeten 1999" /&gt; food must be distributed to different regions or nations. 
[[Food distribution]] involves the storage, processing, transport, packaging, and marketing of food.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; Food-chain infrastructure and storage technologies on farms can also affect the amount of food wasted in the distribution process.&lt;ref name="Godfray 2010" /&gt; Poor transport infrastructure can increase the price of supplying water and fertilizer as well as the price of moving food to national and global markets.&lt;ref name="Godfray 2010" /&gt; Around the world, few individuals or households are continuously self-reliant for food. This creates the need for a bartering, exchange, or cash economy to acquire food.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2005" /&gt; The exchange of food requires efficient trading systems and market institutions, which can affect food security.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ecker and Breisinger|title=The Food Security System|year=2012|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|location=Washington, D.D.|pages=1–14|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ifpridp01166.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Per capita world food supplies are more than adequate to provide food security to all, and thus food accessibility is a greater barrier to achieving food security.&lt;ref name="Tweeten 1999" /&gt;

===Access===
[[File:Goats are an important part of the solution to global food security because they are fairly low maintenance and easy to raise and farm.jpg|thumb|Goats are an important part of the solution to global food security because they are fairly low-maintenance and easy to raise and farm.]]
Food access refers to the affordability and allocation of food, as well as the preferences of individuals and households.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2005" /&gt; The UN Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights noted that the causes of [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] are often not a scarcity of food but an inability to access available food, usually due to [[poverty]].&lt;ref name="UN 1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=United Nations Committee on Economic, Social, and Cultural Rights|title=The right to adequate food|year=1999|publisher=United Nations|location=Geneva|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/tbs/doc.nsf/0/3d02758c707031d58025677f003b73b9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty can limit access to food, and can also increase how vulnerable an individual or household is to food price spikes.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; Access depends on whether the household has enough income to purchase food at prevailing prices or has sufficient land and other resources to grow its own food.&lt;ref name="Garrett and Ruel 1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Garrett, J |author2=Ruel, M|title=Are Determinants of Rural and Urban Food Security and Nutritional Status Different? Some Insights from Mozambique|year=1999|publisher=International Food Policy Research Institute|location=Washington, D.C.|url=http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/pubs/divs/fcnd/dp/papers/dp65.pdf|accessdate=15 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Households with enough resources can overcome [[harvest failure|unstable harvests]] and [[local food]] shortages and maintain their access to food.&lt;ref name="Tweeten 1999" /&gt;

There are two distinct types of access to food: direct access, in which a household produces food using human and material resources, and economic access, in which a household purchases food produced elsewhere.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; Location can affect access to food and which type of access a family will rely on.&lt;ref name="Garrett and Ruel 1999" /&gt; The assets of a household, including income, land, products of labor, inheritances, and gifts can determine a household's access to food.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; However, the ability to access sufficient food may not lead to the purchase of food over other materials and services.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; Demographics and education levels of members of the household as well as the gender of the household head determine the preferences of the household, which influences the type of food that are purchased.&lt;ref name="Garrett and Ruel 1999" /&gt; A household's access to enough and nutritious food may not assure adequate food intake of all household members, as intrahousehold food allocation may not sufficiently meet the requirements of each member of the household.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; The [[USDA]] adds that access to food must be available in socially acceptable ways, without, for example, resorting to emergency food supplies, scavenging, stealing, or other coping strategies.&lt;ref name="usda measuring" /&gt;

===Utilization===
The next pillar of food security is food utilization, which refers to the metabolism of food by individuals.&lt;ref name="Tweeten 1999" /&gt; Once food is obtained by a household, a variety of factors affect the quantity and quality of food that reaches members of the household. In order to achieve food security, the food ingested must be safe and must be enough to meet the physiological requirements of each individual.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; [[Food safety]] affects food utilization,&lt;ref name="Gregory 2005" /&gt; and can be affected by the preparation, processing, and cooking of food in the community and household.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; Nutritional values&lt;ref name="Gregory 2005" /&gt; of the household determine [[food choice]],&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; and whether food meets cultural preferences is important to utilization in terms of psychological and social [[well-being]].&lt;ref name="lorger"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Loring | first1 = Philip A. | last2 = Gerlach | first2 = S. Craig | year = 2009 | title = Food, Culture, and Human Health in Alaska: An Integrative Health Approach to Food Security | url = | journal = Environmental Science and Policy | volume = 12 | issue = 4| pages = 466–78 | doi=10.1016/j.envsci.2008.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Access to healthcare is another determinant of food utilization, since the health of individuals controls how the food is metabolized.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; For example, intestinal parasites can take nutrients from the body and decrease food utilization.&lt;ref name="Tweeten 1999" /&gt; Sanitation can also decrease the occurrence and spread of diseases that can affect food utilization.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Petrikova Ivica|first=Hudson David|date=2017|title=Which aid initiatives strengthen food security?

===Stability===
Food stability refers to the ability to obtain food over time. Food insecurity can be transitory, seasonal, or chronic.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; In transitory food insecurity, food may be unavailable during certain periods of time.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; At the food production level, [[natural disasters]]&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; and drought&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt; result in crop failure and decreased food availability. Civil conflicts can also decrease access to food.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; Instability in markets resulting in food-price spikes can cause transitory food insecurity. Other factors that can temporarily cause food insecurity are loss of employment or productivity, which can be caused by illness. [[Seasonal food]] insecurity can result from the regular pattern of growing seasons in food production.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt;

Chronic (or permanent) food insecurity is defined as the long-term, persistent lack of adequate food.&lt;ref name="Ecker and Breisinger 2012" /&gt; In this case, households are constantly at risk of being unable to acquire food to meet the needs of all members. 
Chronic and transitory food insecurity are linked, since the reoccurrence of transitory food security can make households more vulnerable to chronic food insecurity.&lt;ref name="FAO 1997" /&gt;

==Effects of food insecurity==
Famine and hunger are both rooted in food insecurity. Chronic food insecurity translates into a high degree of vulnerability to famine and hunger; ensuring food security presupposes elimination of that vulnerability.&lt;ref name="Ayalew" /&gt;

===Stunting and chronic nutritional deficiencies===
{{See also|Malnutrition}}
[[File:Kwashiorkor 6903.jpg|thumb|right|Children with symptoms of low calorie and protein intake and a nurse attendant at a Nigerian orphanage in the late 1960s]]
Many countries experience ongoing food shortages and distribution problems. These result in chronic and often widespread hunger amongst significant numbers of people. [[Human population]]s can respond to chronic [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] by decreasing body size, known in medical terms as [[Stunted growth|stunting]] or stunted growth.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} This process starts ''in utero'' if the mother is malnourished and continues through approximately the third year of life. It leads to higher infant and child mortality, but at rates far lower than during famines.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Once stunting has occurred, improved nutritional intake after the age of about two years is unable to reverse the damage. Stunting itself can be viewed as a coping mechanism, bringing body size into alignment with the calories available during adulthood in the location where the child is born.{{citation needed|date=July 2017}} Limiting body size as a way of adapting to low levels of energy (calories) adversely affects health in three ways:{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}
* Premature failure of vital organs during adulthood. For example, a 50-year-old individual might die of heart failure because his/her heart suffered structural defects during early development;
* Stunted individuals suffer a higher rate of disease and illness than those who have not undergone stunting;
* Severe malnutrition in early childhood often leads to defects in cognitive development.&lt;ref name="escape"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It therefore creates disparity among children who did not experience severe malnutrition and those who experience it.

Even with the overpumping of its [[aquifers]], China is developing a grain deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalenvision.org/library/2/887/ |title=Outgrowing the Earth |publisher=Globalenvision.org |date=November 23, 2005 |accessdate=November 13, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; When this happens, it will almost certainly drive grain prices upward. Most of the 3 billion people projected to be born worldwide by mid-century will be born in countries already experiencing [[water shortages]]. After China and India, there is a second tier of smaller countries with large water deficits – Afghanistan, Algeria, Egypt, Iran, Mexico, and Pakistan. Four of these already import a large share of their grain. Only Pakistan remains self-sufficient.

Multimillion-dollar investments beginning in the 1990s by the [[World Bank]] have reclaimed [[desert]] and turned the [[Ica, Peru|Ica]] Valley in Peru, one of the driest places on earth, into the largest supplier of [[asparagus]] in the world. However, the constant irrigation has caused a rapid drop in the water table, in some places as much as eight meters per year, one of the fastest rates of aquifer depletion in the world.

=== Climate change ===
{{See also|Climate change and agriculture}}
Extreme events, such as droughts and floods, are forecast to increase as climate change and [[global warming]] takes hold.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Fiona. 2011. [https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/nov/18/extreme-weather-climate-change-ipcc ''Extreme weather will strike as climate change takes hold, IPCC warns'']&lt;/ref&gt; Ranging from overnight floods to gradually worsening droughts, these will have a range of effects on the agricultural sector.  According to the [[Climate &amp; Development Knowledge Network]] report ''Managing Climate Extremes and Disasters in the Agriculture Sectors: Lessons from the IPCC SREX Report'', the effects will include changing productivity and livelihood patterns, economic losses, and effects on infrastructure, markets and food security. Food security in future will be linked to our ability to adapt agricultural systems to extreme events.  An example of a shifting weather pattern would be a rise in temperatures.  As temperatures rise due to climate change there is a risk of a diminished food supply due to heat damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Semenza|first=J.C

In other parts of the world, a big effect will be low yields of grain according to the World Food Trade Model, specifically in the low latitude regions where much of the developing world is located. From this the price of grain will rise, along with the developing nations trying to grow the grain. Due to this, every 2–2.5% price hike will increase the number of hungry people by 1%.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} Low crop yields are just one of the problem facing farmers in the low latitudes and tropical regions. The timing and length of the growing seasons, when farmers plant their crops, are going to be changing dramatically, per the USDA, due to unknown changes in soil temperature and moisture conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/303959/aib765-8_1_.pdf |title=Issues In Climate Change |format=PDF |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622120002/http://www.ers.usda.gov/media/303959/aib765-8_1_.pdf |archivedate=June 22, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another way of thinking about food security and [[climate change]] comes from Evan Fraser, a geographer working at the [[University of Guelph]] in [[Ontario]] [[Canada]]. His approach is to explore the vulnerability of [[food systems]] to climate change and he defines vulnerability to climate change as situations that occur when relatively minor environmental problems cause major effects on food security. Examples of this include the [[Irish Potato Famine]]&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E. 2003. Social vulnerability and ecological fragility: building bridges between social and natural sciences using the Irish Potato Famine as a case study. ''Conservation Ecology'' 7:9: on line.&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|reason=the wikipedia page ascribes the famine to entirely different causes, not to weather|date=November 2013}}, which was caused by a rainy year that created ideal conditions for the fungal blight to spread in potato fields, or the [[1983-1985 famine in Ethiopia|Ethiopian Famine in the early 1980s]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Fraser | first1 = E | year = 2007b | title = Travelling in antique lands: using past famines to develop an adaptability/resilience framework to identify food systems vulnerable to climate change | url = | journal = Climatic Change | volume = 83 | issue = 4| pages = 495–514 | doi=10.1007/s10584-007-9240-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three factors stand out as common in such cases, and these three factors act as a diagnostic "tool kit" through which to identify cases where food security may be vulnerable to climate change. These factors are: (1) specialized [[Agroecosystems|agro-ecosystems]]; (2) households with very few livelihood options other than farming; (3) situations where formal institutions do not provide adequate safety nets to protect people.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; "The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) estimates that an additional US$ 7.1–7.3 billion per year are needed in agricultural investments to offset the negative [[Effects of global warming|effect of climate change]] on nutrition for children by 2050 (Table 6)."&lt;ref&gt;UNEP, 2011, Towards a Green Economy: Pathways to Sustainable Development and Poverty Eradication, www.unep.org/greeneconomy&lt;/ref&gt;

“Results show that climate change is likely to reduce agricultural production, thus reducing food availability” (Brown etal., 2008.) “The food security threat posed by climate change is greatest for Africa, where agricultural yields and per capita food production has been steadily declining, and where population growth will double the demand for food, water, and livestock forage in the next 30 years” (Devereux et al., 2004).In 2060, the hungry population could range from 641 million to 2087 million with climate change (Chen et al., 1994). By the year 2030, Cereal crops will decrease from 15 to 19 percent, temperatures are estimated to rise from 1 degrees Celsius to 2. 75 degrees Celsius, which will lead to less rainfall, which will all result in an increase in food insecurity in 2030 (Devereux etal, 2004). In prediction farming countries will be the worst sectors hit, hot countries and drought countries will reach even higher temperatures and richer countries will be hit the least as they have more access to more resources (Devereux et al. 2004). From a food security perspective, climate change is the dominant rationale to the increase in recent years and predicted years to come.

===Agricultural diseases===

Diseases affecting livestock or crops can have devastating effects on food availability especially if there are no contingency plans in place.
For example, [[Ug99]], a lineage of wheat [[stem rust]] which can cause up to 100% crop losses, is present in wheat fields in several countries in Africa and the [[Middle East]] and is predicted to spread rapidly through these regions and possibly further afield, potentially causing a wheat production disaster that would affect food security worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author1=Robin McKie |author2=Xan Rice |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2007/apr/22/food.foodanddrink |title=Millions face famine as crop disease rages |work=The Guardian |location=UK |accessdate=November 13, 2011 |date=April 22, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NewSci"&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.newscientist.com/channel/earth/mg19425983.700-billions-at-risk-from-wheat-superblight.html |journal = [[New Scientist]] |title=Billions at risk from wheat super-blight |date=April 3, 2007 |accessdate = 2007-04-19 |issue= 2598 |pages = 6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genetic diversity]] of the [[crop wild relatives]] of wheat can be used to improve modern varieties to be more resistant to rust. In their [[centers of origin]] wild wheat plants are screened for resistance to rust, then their genetic information is studied and finally wild plants and modern varieties are crossed through means of modern [[plant breeding]] in order to transfer the resistance genes from the wild plants to the modern varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Hanan Sela, [[University of Haifa]], Israel See [http://www.diverseeds.eu/uploads/media/Crop_Wild_Relatives_ver2.mp4 DIVERSEEDS short video] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305190205/http://www.diverseeds.eu/uploads/media/Crop_Wild_Relatives_ver2.mp4 |date=2009-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vincent HA, Wiersema J, Dobbie SL, Kell SP, Fielder H, Castañeda Alvarez NP, Guarino L, Eastwood R, Leόn B, Maxted N. 2012.

=== Food versus fuel ===
{{Main|Food versus fuel}}
Farmland and other agricultural resources have long been used to produce non-food crops including industrial materials such as [[cotton]], [[flax]], and rubber; drug crops such as [[tobacco]] and [[opium]], and [[biofuel]]s such as [[firewood]], etc. In the 21st century the production of fuel crops has increased, adding to this diversion. However technologies are also developed to commercially produce [[Power-to-gas#Power_to_methane|food from energy]] such as [[natural gas]] and electrical energy with tiny water and land foot print.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ntva.no/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/04-huslid.pdf |title=BioProtein Production |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/2112298-food-made-from-natural-gas-will-soon-feed-farm-animals-and-us/ |title=Food made from natural gas will soon feed farm animals – and us |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cargill.com/2016/new-venture-selects-cargill-tennessee-to-produce-feedkind |title=New venture selects Cargill’s Tennessee site to produce Calysta FeedKind® Protein |access-date=31 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.carbontrust.com/media/672719/calysta-feedkind.pdf |title=Assessment of environmental impact of FeedKind protein |accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
{{See also|Political corruption}}
Nobel Prize winning economist [[Amartya Sen]] observed that "there is no such thing as an apolitical food problem."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oecdinsights.org/2010/02/23/hunger-is-a-problem-of-poverty-not-scarcity/| title=Hunger is a problem of poverty, not scarcity}}&lt;/ref&gt; While drought and other naturally occurring events may trigger famine conditions, it is government action or inaction that determines its severity, and often even whether or not a famine will occur.  The 20th century has examples of governments, as in [[Collectivization in the Soviet Union]] or the [[Great Leap Forward]] in the [[People's Republic of China]] undermining the food security of their own nations.  Mass starvation is frequently a weapon of war, as in the [[blockade of Germany]], the [[Battle of the Atlantic]], and the [[blockade of Japan]] during [[World War I]] and [[World War II]] and in the [[Hunger Plan]] enacted by [[Nazi Germany]].

Governments sometimes have a narrow base of support, built upon [[cronyism]] and [[patronage]]. [[Fred Cuny]] pointed out in 1999 that under these conditions: "The distribution of food within a country is a political issue. Governments in most countries give priority to urban areas, since that is where the most influential and powerful families and enterprises are usually located. The government often neglects subsistence farmers and rural areas in general. The more remote and underdeveloped the area the less likely the government will be to effectively meet its needs. Many agrarian policies, especially the pricing of agricultural commodities, discriminate against rural areas. Governments often keep prices of basic grains at such artificially low levels that subsistence producers cannot accumulate enough capital to make investments to improve their production. Thus, they are effectively prevented from getting out of their precarious situation."&lt;ref&gt;[[Fred Cuny]]–Famine, Conflict, and Response: a Basic Guide; Kumarian Press, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dictators and [[warlord]]s{{who|date=October 2014}} have used food as a political weapon, rewarding supporters while denying food supplies to areas that oppose their rule. Under such conditions food becomes a currency with which to buy support and famine becomes an effective weapon against opposition.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}}

Governments{{which|date=October 2014}} with strong tendencies towards [[kleptocracy]] can undermine food security even when harvests are good. When government monopolizes trade, farmers may find that they are free to grow cash crops for export, but under penalty of law only able to sell their crops to government buyers at prices far below the world market price.{{Original research inline|date=October 2014}} The government then is free to sell their crop on the world market at full price, pocketing the difference.

When the [[rule of law]] is absent, or [[private property]] is non-existent, farmers have little incentive to improve their productivity.{{according to whom|date=October 2014}} If a farm becomes noticeably more productive than neighboring farms, it may become the target of individuals well connected to the government. Rather than risk being noticed and possibly losing their land, farmers may be content with the perceived safety of mediocrity.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}

As pointed out by [[William Bernstein]] in ''The Birth of Plenty'': "Individuals without property are susceptible to starvation, and it is much easier to bend the fearful and hungry to the will of the state. If a [farmer's] property can be arbitrarily threatened by the state, that power will inevitably be employed to intimidate those with divergent political and religious opinions."{{citation needed|date=July 2017}}

===Food sovereignty===
The approach known as [[food sovereignty]] views the business practices of multinational corporations as a form of [[neocolonialism]]. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also have the political clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of [[cash crops]] for sale to [[industrialized nations]] outside of the tropics, and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk" /&gt; Under this view [[Subsistence farming|subsistence farmers]] are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, food sovereignty holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue. Many communities calling for food sovereignty are protesting the imposition of Western technologies on to their indigenous systems and agency.{{Citation needed|date=November 2013}}

=== Fossil fuel dependence ===
{{further|Agriculture#Agriculture and petroleum|l1=Agriculture and petroleum|Peak oil#Agricultural effects and population limits|l2=Peak oil's effects on agriculture}}
While agricultural output has increased, energy consumption to produce a crop has also increased at a greater rate, so that the ratio of crops produced to energy input has decreased over time. [[Green Revolution]] techniques also heavily rely on chemical [[fertilizers]], [[pesticides]] and [[herbicides]], many of which are [[petroleum product]]s, making agriculture increasingly reliant on petroleum.

Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by [[fossil fuels]] in the form of [[fertilizers]] (natural gas), [[pesticides]] (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]] fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energybulletin.net/281.html Eating Fossil Fuels].

David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (NRIFN), place in their study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum [[U.S. population]] for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 210 million. To achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster, the United States must reduce its population by at least one-third, and world population will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dieoff.com/page55.htm | title=Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy-U.S. agriculture based on ecocompatibility | publisher=Carrying Capacity Network | date=November 21, 1994 | accessdate=December 16, 2016 |author1=David Pimentel |author2=Mario Giampietro}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of this study believe that the mentioned agricultural crisis will only begin to affect us after 2020, and will not become critical until 2050.

On April 30, 2008, Thailand, one of the world's biggest rice exporters, announced the creation of the [[Organisation of Rice Exporting Countries]] with the potential to develop into a price-fixing cartel for rice. It is a project to organize 21 rice exporting countries to create a homonymous organisation to control the price of rice. The group is mainly made up of Thailand, Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and Myanmar. The organization attempts to serve the purpose of making a "contribution to ensuring food stability, not just in an individual country but also to address food shortages in the region and the world". However, it is still questionable whether this organization will serve its role as an effective rice price fixing cartel, that is similar to OPEC's mechanism for managing petroleum. Economic analysts and traders said the proposal would go nowhere because of the inability of governments to cooperate with each other and control farmers' output. Moreover, countries that are involved expressed their concern, that this could only worsen the food security.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200804/s2232076.htm?tab=asia Mekong nations to form rice price-fixing cartel] Radio Australia, April 30, 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080824102712/http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/news/stories/200804/s2232076.htm?tab=asia |date=August 24, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bangkokpost.com/News/01May2008_news07.php |Bangkok Post|May 1, 2008|PM floats idea of five-nation rice cartel]{{dead link|date=November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orecinternational.org/ Welcome to OREC – Rice for Life].

===Land use change===
China needs not less than 120 million hectares of arable land for its food security. China has recently reported a surplus of 15 million hectares. On the other side of the coin, some 4 million hectares of conversion to urban use and 3 million hectares of contaminated land have been reported as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kong|first=X.|title=China must protect high-quality arable land|journal=Nature|year=2014|volume=506|issue=7486|page=7| doi= 10.1038/506007a |url= http://www.nature.com/news/china-must-protect-high-quality-arable-land-1.14646|pmid=24499883|bibcode=2014Natur.506....7K}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, a survey found that 2.5% of China's arable land is too contaminated to grow food without harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larson|first=C.|title= China gets serious about its pollutant-laden soil|journal=Science|year=2014|volume=343|issue=6178|pages=1415–1416| doi=10.1126/science.343.6178.1415|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/343/6178/1415.short|pmid=24675928}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Europe, the conversion of agricultural soil implied a net loss of potential. But the rapid loss in the area of arable soils appears to be economically meaningless because EU is perceived to be dependent on internal food supply anymore. During the period 2000–2006 the European Union lost 0.27% of its cropland and 0.26% of its crop productive potential. The loss of agricultural land during the same time was the highest in the Netherlands, which lost 1.57% of its crop production potential within six years. The figures are quite alarming for Cyprus (0.84%), Ireland (0.77%) and Spain (0.49%) as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Tóth |first= G.|title=Impact of land-take on the land resource base for crop production in the European Union|journal= Science of the Total Environment|year=2012|volume=435–436 |pages=202–214|doi=10.1016/j.scitotenv.2012.06.103|url= http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969712009369|bibcode= 2012ScTEn.435..202T}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In Italy, in the Emilia-Romagna plain (ERP), the conversion of 15,000 hectare of agricultural soil (period 2003-2008) implied a net loss of 109,000 Mg per year of wheat, which accounts for the calories needed by 14% of ERP population (425,000 people). Such a loss in wheat production is just 0.02% of gross domestic product (GDP) of the Emilia-Romagna region which is actually a minor effect in financial terms. Additionally, the income from the new land use is often much higher than the one guaranteed by agriculture, as in the case of urbanisation or extraction of raw materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Malucelli|first=F. |author2=Certini, G. |author3=Scalenghe, R.|title=Soil is brown gold in the Emilia-Romagna Region|journal=Land Use Policy|year=2014| doi= 10.1016/j.landusepol.2014.01.019|url=|volume=39|pages=350–357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Agricultural subsidies in the United States ===
[[Agricultural subsidy|Agricultural subsidies]] are paid to farmers and agribusinesses to supplement their income, manage the supply of their commodities and influence the cost and supply of those commodities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/should-washington-end-agriculture-subsidies-1436757020|title=Should Washington End Agriculture Subsidies?|last=|first=|date=2015-07-13|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=|issn=0099-9660}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the main crops the government subsidizes contribute to the [[Obesity in the United States|obesity problem]]; since 1995, $300 billion have gone to crops that are used to create junk food.&lt;ref name="Sankin"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/07/18/agriculture-subsidies-obesity_n_3607481.html|title=Agriculture Subsidies Promote Obesity, Charges New Study|last=Sankin|first=Aaron|date=2013-07-18|work=Huffington Post|access-date=|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Taxpayers heavily subsidize corn and soy, which are main ingredients in processed foods and fatty foods which the government does not encourage,&lt;ref name="Sankin"/&gt; and used to fatten livestock.  Half of farmland is devoted to corn and soy, the rest is wheat.  Soy and corn can be found in sweeteners like [[high fructose corn syrup]].&lt;ref name="Sankin"/&gt; Over $19 billion during the prior 18 years to 2013 was spent to incent farmers to grow these crops,&lt;ref name="Sankin"/&gt; raising the price of fruits and vegetables by about 40% and lowering the price of dairy and other animal products. Little land is used for fruit and [[vegetable farming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ourhenhouse.org/2014/01/how-the-government-uses-taxpayer-money-to-make-dairy-seem-cheaper-than-it-is/

Corn, a pillar of American agriculture for years, is now mainly used for ethanol, [[high fructose corn syrup]] and bio-based plastics.&lt;ref name="Foley"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/time-to-rethink-corn/|title=It’s Time to Rethink America’s Corn System|last=Foley|first=Jonathan|date=|work=Scientific American|access-date=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 40 percent of corn is used for ethanol and 36% is used as animal feed.&lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt; Only a tiny fraction of corn is used as a food source, much of that fraction is used for high-fructose corn syrup, which is a main ingredient in processed, unhealthy junk food.&lt;ref name="Foley"/&gt;

People who ate the most subsidized food had a 37% higher risk of being obese compared to people who ate the least amount of subsidized food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://time.com/4393109/food-subsidies-obesity/|title=Government Food Subsidies Are Making Us Sick|last=|first=|date=|website=Time|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This brings up the concern that minority communities are more prone to risks of obesity due to financial limitations.  The subsidies result in those commodities being cheap to the public, compared to those recommended by dietary guidelines.

[[President Trump]] proposed a 21% cut to government discretionary spending in the agriculture sector, which has met partisan resistance.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-budget-agriculture-idUSKBN16N0CS|title=Agriculture leaders slam Trump's USDA budget cut proposal|last=|first=|date=2017-03-16|work=Reuters|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This budget proposal would also reduce spending on the Special Supplement Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, albeit less than President Obama did.&lt;ref name="Reuters"/&gt;

On April 29, 2008, a [[UNICEF UK]] report found that the world's poorest and most vulnerable children are being hit the hardest by [[climate change]]. The report, "Our Climate, Our Children, Our Responsibility: The Implications of Climate Change for the World's Children", says that access to clean water and food supplies will become more difficult, particularly in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unicef.org.uk/press/news_detail_full_story.asp?news_id=1120 UNICEF UK News:: News item:: The tragic consequences of climate change for the world's children:: April 29, 2008 00:00] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122045816/http://www.unicef.org.uk/press/news_detail_full_story.asp?news_id=1120 |date=January 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In the United States ===
By way of comparison, in one of the largest food producing countries in the world, the United States, approximately one out of six people are "food insecure", including 17 million children, according to the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;The Washington Post, 2009 Nov 17, "America's Economic Pain Brings Hunger Pangs: USDA Report on Access to Food 'Unsettling,' Obama Says," https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/16/AR2009111601598.html?hpid=topnews&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 study in the ''Journal of Applied Research on Children'' found that rates of food security varied significantly by race, class and education. In both kindergarten and third grade, 8% of the children were classified as food insecure, but only 5% of white children were food insecure, while 12% and 15% of black and Hispanic children were food insecure, respectively. In third grade, 13% of black and 11% of Hispanic children are food insecure compared to 5% of white children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://journalistsresource.org/studies/society/health/neighborhood-characteristics-childrens-food-insecurity/|title=Individual, Family and Neighborhood Characteristics and Children's Food Insecurity}} JournalistsResource.org.

There are also striking regional variations in food security. Although food insecurity can be difficult to measure, 45% of elementary and secondary students in Maine qualify for free or reduced-price school lunch; by some measures Maine has been declared the most food-insecure of the New England states.&lt;ref name="Abbate"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://bangordailynews.com/2017/07/24/homestead/school-might-be-out-for-summer-but-hunger-never-takes-a-break/|title=How hungry Maine kids eat when they can’t get free school lunches|last=Abbate|first=Lauren|date=July 24, 2017|work=Bangor Daily News|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Transportation challenges and distance are common barriers to families in rural areas who seek food assistance. Social stigma is another important consideration, and for children, sensitively administering in-school programs can make the difference between success and failure. For instance, when John Woods, co-founder of Full Plates, Full Potential,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fullplates.org/|title=Full Plates, Full Potential|last=|first=|date=|website=Full Plates, Full Potential|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; learned that embarrassed students were shying away from the free breakfasts being distributed at a school he was working with, he made arrangements to provide breakfast free of charge to all of the students there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/11/11/giraffe-award-winner-wants-maine-to-be-first-state-to-eradicate-childhood-hunger/|title=Giraffe Award Winner Wants Maine to be First to Eradicate Childhood Hunger|last=Smith|first=George|date=November 11, 2015|work=Kennebec Journal|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2015 Congressional Budget Office report on child nutrition programs, it is more likely that food insecure children will participate in school nutrition programs than children from food secure families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cbo.gov/sites/default/files/114th-congress-2015-2016/reports/50737-childnutrition.pdf|title=Child Nutrition Programs: Spending and Policy Options|last=|first=|date=|website=Congressional Budget Office|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; School nutrition programs, such as the [[National School Lunch Act|National School Lunch Program (NSLP)]] and the [[School Breakfast Program|School Breakfast Program (SBP)]] have provided millions of children access to healthier lunch and breakfast meals, since their inceptions in the mid-1900s. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, NSLP has served over 300 million, while SBP has served about 10 million students each day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/winnable/school_nutrition.html|title=School Nutrition|website=Center for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=2017-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318173842/https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/winnable/school_nutrition.html|archive-date=2017-03-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, far too many qualifying students still fail to receive these benefits simply due to not submitting the necessary paperwork.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.centralmaine.com/2015/09/19/nearly-half-of-public-school-students-in-maine-miss-at-least-one-meal-per-day/|title=Nearly half of public school students in Maine miss at least one meal per day|last=Alfond|first=Justin|date=September 19, 2015|work=Morning Sentinel|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple studies have reported that school nutrition programs play an important role in ensuring students are accessing healthy meals. Students who ate school lunches provided by NLSP showed higher diet quality than if they had their own lunches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Eating School Lunch Is Associated with Higher Diet Quality among Elementary School Students|journal=Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics|date=2016|url=http://www.andjrnl.org/article/S2212-2672(16)30185-X/fulltext}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even more, the USDA improved standards for school meals, which ultimately lead to positive impacts on children’s food selection and eating habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|year=2014|title=Impact of the New U.S. Department of Agriculture School Meal Standards on Food Selection, Consumption, and Waste|url=http://www.ajpmonline.org/article/S0749-3797(13)00635-1/abstract|journal=American Journal of Preventive Medicine|volume=46|issue=4|pages=388|doi=10.1016/j.amepre.2013.11.013|pmid=24650841|last1=Cohen|first1=Juliana F.W|last2=Richardson|first2=Scott|last3=Parker|first3=Ellen|last4=Catalano|first4=Paul J|last5=Rimm|first5=Eric B|pmc=3994463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Countless partnerships have emerged in the quest for food security. A number of federal nutrition programs exist to provide food specifically for children, including the [[Summer Food Service Program]], [[Special Milk Program|Special Milk Program (SMP)]] and [[Child and Adult Care Food Program|Child and Adult Care Food Program (CACFP)]], and community and state organizations often network with these programs. The Summer Food Program in Bangor, Maine, is run by the Bangor Housing Authority and sponsored by Good Shepherd Food Bank.&lt;ref name="Abbate"/&gt; In turn, Waterville Maine's Thomas College, for example, is among the organizations holding food drives to collect donations for Good Shepherd.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thomas.edu/2016/10/19/thomas-college-community-donates-360-pounds-food-good-shepherd-food-bank/|title=Thomas College Community Donates over 360 Pounds of Food to Good Shepherd Food Bank|last=|first=|date=October 2016|website=Thomas College|access-date=October 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children whose families qualify for [[Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program|Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP)]] or [[WIC|Women, Infants, and Children (WIC)]] may also receive food assistance. WIC alone served approximately 7.6 million participants, 75% of which are children and infants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fns.usda.gov/sites/default/files/pd/26wifypart.pdf|title=WIC PROGRAM: TOTAL PARTICIPATION|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the sizable populations served by these programs, Conservatives have regularly targeted these programs for defunding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/house-freedom-caucus-school-lunch_us_585ac244e4b0de3a08f3d34e|title=House Conservatives Target Healthy School Lunch Standards|last=|first=|date=|work=The Huffington Post|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservatives' arguments against school nutrition programs include fear of wasting food and fraud from applications. On January 23, 2017, H.R.610 was introduced to the House by Republican Representative Steve King. The bill seeks to repeal a rule set by the Food and Nutrition Service of the Department of Agriculture, which mandates schools to provide more nutritious and diverse foods across the food plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/115th-congress/house-bill/610/text|title=H.R.610 – To distribute Federal funds for elementary and secondary education in the form of vouchers for eligible students and to repeal a certain rule relating to nutrition standards in schools.|last=|first=|date=|website=Congress.gov|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two months later, the Trump administration released a preliminary 2018 budget that proposed a $2 billion cut from WIC.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2017/mar/16/trump-budget-wic-women-infants-children-nutrition|title=Trump budget threatens nutrition services for poor women and children|last=Redden|first=Molly|date=March 16, 2017|work=The Guardian|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gender inequality]] both leads to and is a result of food insecurity. According to estimates women and girls make up 60% of the world's chronically hungry and little progress has been made in ensuring the equal [[right to food]] for women enshrined in the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://one.wfp.org/eb/docs/2009/wfp194044~1.pdf], World Food Programme Gender Policy Report.

They often work as unpaid family workers, are involved in subsistence farming and represent about 43% of the agricultural labor force in developing countries, varying from 20% in Latin America to 50% in Eastern and Southeastern Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. However, women face discrimination in access to land, credit, technologies, finance and other services. Empirical studies suggest that if women had the same access to productive resources as men, women could boost their yields by 20–30%; raising the overall agricultural output in developing countries by 2.5 to 4%. While those are rough estimates, the significant benefit of closing the gender gap on agricultural productivity cannot be denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=FAO|title=The state of food and agriculture women in agriculture : closing the gender gap for development|year=2011|publisher=FAO|location=Rome|isbn=978-92-5-106768-0|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/013/i2050e/i2050e.pdf|edition=2010–11}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gendered aspects of food security are visible along the four pillars of food security: availability, access, utilization and stability, as defined by the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=FAO|title=Food Security|journal=Policy Brief|year=2006|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/es/ESA/policybriefs/pb_02.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of people affected by hunger is extremely high, with enormous effects on women and girls.&lt;ref name="Bridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bridge.ids.ac.uk/bridge-publications/cutting-edge-packs/gender-and-food-security|title=Gender and food security}}&lt;/ref&gt; Making this trend disappear "must be a top priority for governments and international institutions".&lt;ref name="Bridge" /&gt; Actions governments take must take into consideration that food insecurity is an issue regarding "equality, rights and social justice".&lt;ref name="Bridge" /&gt;
"Food and nutrition insecurity is a political and economic phenomenon fuelled by inequitable global and national processes".&lt;ref name="Bridge" /&gt; Factors like capitalism, exploration of Indigenous lands all contribute to food insecurity for minorities and the people who are the most oppressed in various countries (women being one of these oppressed groups). To emphasis, "food and nutrition insecurity is a gender justice issue".&lt;ref name="Bridge" /&gt; The facts that women and girls are the most oppressed by "the inequitable global economic processes that govern food systems and by global trends such as climate change", shows how institutions continue to place women in positions of disadvantage and impoverishment to make money and thrive on capitalizing the food system.&lt;ref name="Bridge" /&gt; When the government withholds food by raising its prices to amounts only privileged people can afford, they both benefit and are able to control the "lower-class"/ marginalized people via the food market. 
An interesting fact is that "despite rapid economic growth in India, thousands of women and girls still lack food and nutrition security as a direct result of their lower status compared with men and boys".&lt;ref name="Bridge" /&gt; "Such inequalities are compounded by women and girls' often limited access to productive resources, education and decision-making, by the 'normalised' burden of unpaid work – including care work – and by the endemic problems of gender-based violence (GBV), HIV and AIDS".&lt;ref name="Bridge" /&gt;

== Use of genetically modified (GM) crops ==
One of the most up-and-coming techniques to ensuring global food security is the use of [[Genetically modified crops|genetically modified (GM) crops]]. The genome of these crops can be altered to address one or more aspects of the plant that may be preventing it from being grown in various regions under certain conditions. Many of these alterations can address the challenges that were previously mentioned above, including the water crisis, land degradation, and the ever-changing climate.

In agriculture and [[animal husbandry]], the [[Green Revolution]] popularized the use of conventional [[Hybrid (biology)|hybrid]]ization to increase yield by creating "[[high-yielding varieties]]". Often the handful of hybridized breeds originated in developed countries and were further hybridized with local varieties in the rest of the developing world to create high yield strains resistant to local climate and diseases.

The area sown to genetically engineered crops in developing countries is rapidly catching up with the area sown in industrial nations. According to the International Service for the Acquisition of Agri-biotech Applications (ISAAA), GM crops were grown by approximately 8.5 million farmers in 21 countries in 2005; up from 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries in 2004. However, the ISAAA is funded by organisations including prominent agricultural biotechnology corporations, such as Monsanto and Bayer,{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} and there have been several challenges made to the accuracy of ISAAA's global figures.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

=== Opposition to GM crops ===
Some scientists question the safety of biotechnology as a panacea; agroecologists [[Miguel Altieri]] and Peter Rosset have enumerated ten reasons&lt;ref name="altros"&gt;{{cite journal|last2=Rosset|first2=Peter|year=1999|title=Ten Reasons Why Biotechnology Will Not Help the Developing World|url=|journal=AgBioForum|volume=2|issue=3&amp;4|pages=155–62|last1=Altieri|first1=Miguel A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; why biotechnology will not ensure food security, protect the environment, or reduce poverty. Reasons include:
# There is no relationship between the prevalence of hunger in a given country and its population
# Most innovations in agricultural biotechnology have been profit-driven rather than need-driven
# Ecological theory predicts that the large-scale landscape homogenization with transgenic crops will exacerbate the ecological problems already associated with monoculture agriculture
# And, that much of the needed food can be produced by small farmers located throughout the world using existing agroecological technologies.

Based on evidence from previous attempts, there is a likely lack of transferability of one type of GM crop from one region to another. For example, modified crops that have proven successful in Asia from the Green Revolution have failed when tried in regions of Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fischer|first=Klara|date=2016-07-01|title=Why new crop technology is not scale-neutral—A critique of the expectations for a crop-based African Green Revolution|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048733316300300|journal=Research Policy|volume=45|issue=6|pages=1185–1194|doi=10.1016/j.respol.2016.03.007}}&lt;/ref&gt; More research must be done regarding the specific requirements of growing a specific crop in a specific region.

There is also a drastic lack of education given to governments, farmers, and the community about the science behind GM crops, as well as suitable growing practices. In most relief programs, farmers are given seeds with little explanation and little attention is paid to the resources available to them or even laws that prohibit them from distributing produce. Governments are often not advised on the economic and health implications that come with growing GM crops, and are then left to make judgments on their own. Because they have so little information regarding these crops, they usually shy away from allowing them or do not take the time and effort required to regulate their use. Members of the community that will then consume the produce from these crops are also left in the dark about what these modifications mean and are often scared off by their 'unnatural' origins. This has resulted in failure to properly grow crops as well as strong opposition to the unknown practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Pathways to productivity: The role of GMOs for food security in Kenya, Tanzania, and Uganda|last=Wedding|first=K.|publisher=Rowman and Littlefield|year=2013|isbn=|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in June 2016 evaluated the status of the implementation of [[Golden rice|Golden Rice]], which was first developed in the 1990s to produce higher levels of Vitamin A than its non-GMO counterparts. This strain of rice was designed so that malnourished women and children in third world countries who were more susceptible to deficiencies could easily improve their Vitamin A intake levels and prevent blindness, which is a common result. Golden Rice production was centralized to the Philippines, yet there have been many hurdles to jump in order to get production moving. The study showed that the project is far behind schedule and is not living up to its expectations. Although research on Golden Rice still continues, the country has moved forward with other non-GMO initiatives to address the Vitamin A deficiency problem which is so prevasive in that region.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stone|first=Glenn Davis|last2=Glover|first2=Dominic|date=2016-04-16|title=Disembedding grain: Golden Rice, the Green Revolution, and heirloom seeds in the Philippines|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10460-016-9696-1|journal=Agriculture and Human Values|volume=34|language=en|pages=1–16|doi=10.1007/s10460-016-9696-1|issn=0889-048X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://source.wustl.edu/2016/06/genetically-modified-golden-rice-falls-short-lifesaving-promises/|title=Genetically modified Golden Rice falls short on lifesaving promises {{!}} The Source {{!}} Washington University in St. Louis|date=2016-06-02|language=English|access-date=2016-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many anti-GMO activists argue that the use of GM crops decreases [[biodiversity]] amongst plants. Livestock biodiversity is also threatened by the modernization of agriculture and the focus on more productive major breeds. Therefore, efforts have been made by governments and non-governmental organizations to conserve livestock biodiversity through strategies such as [[Cryoconservation of animal genetic resources]].&lt;ref&gt;’’Global Plan of Action for Animal Genetic Resources and the Interlaken Declaration.’’ Rep. Rome: Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, 2007. FAO. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;’’Cryoconservation of Animal Genetic Resources.’ ‘Rep.

=== Support of GM crops ===
Many GM crop success stories exist, primarily in developed nations like the USA, China, and various countries in Europe. Common GM crops include cotton, maize, and soybeans, all of which are grown throughout North and South America as well as regions of Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/agri_biotechnology/gmo_planting/|title=GMO Crop Growing: Growing Around the World|last=www.gmo-compass.org|website=www.gmo-compass.org|access-date=2016-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160806052608/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/agri_biotechnology/gmo_planting/|archive-date=2016-08-06|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modified cotton crops, for example, have been altered such that they are resistant to pests, can grown in more extreme heat, cold, or drought, and produce longer, stronger fibers to be used in textile production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/plants/21.cotton.html|title=Cotton – GMO Database|last=www.gmo-compass.org|website=www.gmo-compass.org|access-date=2016-07-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160731133533/http://www.gmo-compass.org/eng/database/plants/21.cotton.html|archive-date=2016-07-31|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the biggest threats to rice, which is a staple food crop especially in India and other countries within Asia, is [[Magnaporthe grisea|blast]] disease which is a fungal infection that causes lesions to form on all parts of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TeBeest|first=D.|date=2007|title=Rice Blast|url=http://www.apsnet.org/edcenter/intropp/lessons/fungi/ascomycetes/Pages/RiceBlast.aspx|journal=The Plant Health Instructor|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1094/phi-i-2007-0313-07|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A genetically engineered strain of rice has been developed so that it is resistant to blast, greatly improving the crop yield of farmers and allowing rice to be more accessible to everyone.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shew|first=Aaron M.|last2=Nalley|first2=Lawton L.|last3=Danforth|first3=Diana M.|last4=Dixon|first4=Bruce L.|last5=Nayga|first5=Rodolfo M.|last6=Delwaide|first6=Anne-Cecile|last7=Valent|first7=Barbara|date=2016-01-01|title=Are all GMOs the same?

The latter can be helpful in extreme climates with little arable land and also decreases deforestation, as fewer trees need to be cut down in order to make room for crop fields.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Makinde|first=D.|date=2009|title=Status of Biotechnology in Africa: Challenges and Opportunities|url=|journal=Asian Biotechnology and Development Review|volume=11|issue=3|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others yet have been altered such that they do not require the use of insecticides or fungicides.

The body of scientific evidence concluding that GM foods are safe to eat and do not pose environmental risks is wide. Findings from the International Council of Scientists (2003) that analyzed a selection of approximately 50 science-based reviews concluded that “currently available genetically modified foods are safe to eat,” and “there is no evidence of any deleterious environmental effects having occurred from the trait/species combinations currently available.”&lt;ref&gt;International Council for Science, “New Genetics, Food and Agriculture: Scientific
Discoveries – Societal Dilemmas,” 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; The United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) supported the same consensus a year later in addition to recommending the extension of biotechnology to the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;Entine, J.

==Approaches==
[[File:Carrobotte g1.jpg|thumb|right|A liquid manure spreader is used to increase [[agricultural productivity]].]]

===By the United Nations===
The [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] are one of the initiatives aimed at achieving food security in the world. The first Millennium Development Goal states that the UN "is to eradicate extreme hunger and poverty" by 2015.&lt;ref name="IFPRI 2003" /&gt; Olivier De Schutter, the UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food, advocates for a multidimensional approach to food security challenges. This approach emphasizes the physical availability of food; the social, economic and physical access people have to food; and the nutrition, safety and cultural appropriateness or adequacy of food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Schutter|first=Olivier|title=Report submitted by the Special Rapporteur on the right to food|url=http://www2.ohchr.org/english/issues/food/docs/A-HRC-16-49.pdf|publisher=United Nations|accessdate=22 October 2013|pages=1–21|date=December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====By the Food and Agriculture Organization====
The Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations stated in ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2003'' that countries that have reduced hunger often had rapid economic growth, specifically in their [[agriculture|agricultural sectors]]. These countries were also characterized as having slower [[population growth]], lower HIV rates, and higher rankings in the [[Human Development Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The State of Food Security in the World 2003|url=ftp://ftp.fao.org/docrep/fao/006/j0083e/j0083e00.pdf|publisher=FAO|accessdate=31 October 2013|author=FAO|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, the FAO considered addressing agriculture and population growth vital to achieving food security. In ''The State of Food Insecurity in the World 2012'', the FAO restated its focus on [[economic growth]] and agricultural growth to achieve food security and added a focus on the poor and on "nutrition-sensitive" growth. For example, economic growth should be used by governments to provide public services to benefit poor and hungry populations. The FAO also cited smallholders, including women, as groups that should be involved in agricultural growth to generate employment for the poor. For economic and agricultural growth to be "nutrition-sensitive", resources should be utilized to improve access to diverse diets for the poor as well as access to a safe [[water supply]] and to healthcare.&lt;ref name="FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012" /&gt;
The FAO has proposed a "twin track" approach to fight food insecurity that combines sustainable development and short-term hunger relief. Development approaches include investing in rural markets and rural infrastructure.&lt;ref name="FAO" /&gt; In general, the FAO proposes the use of public policies and programs that promote long-term economic growth that will benefit the poor. To obtain short-term food security, [[vouchers]] for seeds, [[fertilizer]], or access to services could promote agricultural production. The use of conditional or unconditional food or cash transfers was another approach the FAO noted. Conditional transfers could include [[school feeding in low-income countries|school feeding programs]], while unconditional transfers could include general food distribution, [[aid|emergency food aid]] or cash transfers. A third approach is the use of [[Subsidy|subsidies]] as safety nets to increase the purchasing power of households. The FAO stated that "approaches should be human rights-based, target the poor, promote gender equality, enhance long-term resilience and allow sustainable graduation out of poverty."&lt;ref name="FAO, WFP, IFAD 2012" /&gt;

The FAO noted that some countries have been successful in fighting food insecurity and decreasing the number of people suffering from undernourishment. Bangladesh is an example of a country that has met the Millennium Development Goal hunger target. The FAO credited growth in agricultural productivity and macroeconomic stability for the rapid economic growth in the 1990s that resulted in an increase in food security. [[Irrigation systems]] were established through infrastructure development programs. Two programs, HarvestPlus and the Golden Rice Project, provided [[Biofortification|biofortified crops]] in order to decrease micronutrient deficiencess.&lt;ref name="FAO, WFP, IFAD 2013" /&gt;

[[World Food Day]] was established on October 16, in honor of the date that the FAO was founded in 1945. On this day, the FAO hosts a variety of event at the headquarters in Rome and around the world, as well as seminars with UN officials.&lt;ref name="UN World Food Day" /&gt;

====By the World Food Programme====
[[File:WalktheWorldLogo.jpg|thumb|right|Fight Hunger: Walk the World campaign is a United Nations [[World Food Programme]] initiative.]]
The [[World Food Programme]] (WFP) is an agency of the United Nations that uses [[food aid]] to promote food security and eradicate hunger and poverty. In particular, the WFP provides food aid to refugees and to others experiencing food emergencies. It also seeks to improve nutrition and quality of life to the most vulnerable populations and promote self-reliance.&lt;ref name="WFP Mission Statement"&gt;{{cite web|last=WFP|title=Mission Statement|url=http://www.wfp.org/about/mission-statement|publisher=WFP|accessdate=2 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a WFP program is the "Food For Assets" program in which participants work on new infrastructure, or learn new skills, that will increase food security, in exchange for food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WFP|title=Food For Assets|url=http://www.wfp.org/food-assets|accessdate=26 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The WFP and the Government of Kenya have partnered in the Food For Assets program in hopes of increasing the resilience of communities to shocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=WFP and Republic of Kenya|title=Cash/Food For Assets|url=http://ffa.kenyafoodsecurity.org|accessdate=26 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213044451/http://ffa.kenyafoodsecurity.org/|archivedate=13 December 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Global partnerships to achieve food security and end hunger===
In April 2012, the [[Food Assistance Convention]] was signed, the world's first legally binding international agreement on food aid. The May 2012 [[Copenhagen Consensus]] recommended that efforts to combat hunger and malnutrition should be the first priority for politicians and private sector philanthropists looking to maximize the effectiveness of aid spending. They put this ahead of other priorities, like the fight against [[malaria]] and [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.copenhagenconsensus.com/Projects/CC12/Outcome.aspx|title=Outcome - Copenhagen Consensus Center|website=www.copenhagenconsensus.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main global policy to reduce hunger and poverty are the recently approved [[Sustainable Development Goals]]. In particular Goal 2: Zero Hunger sets globally agreed targets to end hunger, achieve food security and improved nutrition and promote sustainable agriculture by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/hunger/|title=Hunger and food security - United Nations Sustainable Development|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organizations have formed initiatives with the more ambitious goal to achieve this outcome in only 10 years, by 2025:

* In 2013 Caritas International started a Caritas-wide initiative aimed at ending systemic hunger by 2025. The One human family, food for all campaign focuses on awareness raising, improving the effect of Caritas programs and advocating the implementation of the Right to Food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.caritas.org/2013/12/pope-francis-denounces-global-scandal-hunger/|title=Pope Francis denounces ‘global scandal’ of hunger - Caritas|date=9 December 2013|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Project Paper. IFPRI: Washington, DC.]&lt;/ref&gt; It bases its claim that hunger can be ended by 2025 on a report by [[Shenggen Fan]] and [[Paul Polman]] that analyzed the experiences from China, Vietnam, Brazil and Thailand and concludes that eliminating hunger and undernutrition was possible by 2025.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"&gt;Fan, Shenggen and Polman, Paul. 2014.

* In June 2015, the [[European Union]] and the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]] have launched a partnership to combat undernutrition especially in children.

*The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the UN has created a partnership that will act through the [[African Union]]'s CAADP framework aiming to end hunger in Africa by 2025. It includes different interventions including support for improved food production, a strengthening of social protection and integration of the Right to Food into national legislation.&lt;ref&gt;FAO. 2015.

===By the United States Agency for International Development===
The [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) proposes several key steps to increasing [[agricultural productivity]] which is in turn key to increasing rural income and reducing food insecurity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/agriculture/food_security.htm USAID – Food Security] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041026190743/http://www.usaid.gov/our_work/agriculture/food_security.htm |date=October 26, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They include:
* Boosting [[agricultural science]] and technology. Current agricultural yields are insufficient to feed the growing populations. Eventually, the rising agricultural productivity drives economic growth.
* Securing property rights and [[access to finance]]
* Enhancing [[human capital]] through education and improved health
* Conflict prevention and resolution mechanisms and democracy and governance based on principles of accountability and transparency in public institutions and the rule of law are basic to reducing vulnerable members of society.

Since the 1960s, the U.S. has been implementing a food stamp program (now called the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program) to directly target consumers who lack the income to purchase food. According to Tim Josling, a Senior Fellow at the Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies, [[Stanford University]], food stamps or other methods of distribution of purchasing power directly to consumers might fit into the range of international programs under consideration to tackle food insecurity.&lt;ref name="josling"&gt;[http://ictsd.org/downloads/2011/12/global-food-stamps-an-idea-worth-considering.pdf Global Food Stamps: An Idea Worth Considering], August 2011, [[ICTSD]], Issue Paper No.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Improving agricultural productivity to benefit the rural poor===
[[File:Africa Food Security 15 (10665294293).jpg|thumb|right|A farmer on the outskirts of [[Lilongwe]] ([[Malawi]]) prepares a field for planting.]]
There are strong, direct relationships between agricultural productivity, hunger, poverty, and sustainability. Three-quarters of the world's poor live in rural areas and make their living from agriculture. Hunger and child [[malnutrition]] are greater in these areas than in urban areas. Moreover, the higher the proportion of the rural population that obtains its income solely from subsistence farming (without the benefit of pro-poor technologies and access to markets), the higher the incidence of malnutrition. Therefore, improvements in agricultural productivity aimed at small-scale farmers will benefit the rural poor first. Food and feed crop demand is likely to double in the next 50 years, as the global population approaches nine billion. Growing sufficient food will require people to make changes such as increasing productivity in areas dependent on [[rainfed agriculture]]; improving [[soil]] fertility management; expanding cropped areas; investing in [[irrigation]]; conducting agricultural trade between countries; and reducing gross food demand by influencing diets and reducing post-harvest losses.

According to the [[Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]], a major study led by the [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI), managing rainwater and soil moisture more effectively, and using supplemental and small-scale irrigation, hold the key to helping the greatest number of poor people. It has called for a new era of water investments and policies for upgrading rainfed agriculture that would go beyond controlling field-level soil and water to bring new freshwater sources through better local management of rainfall and runoff.&lt;ref&gt;Molden, D. (Ed). ''Water for food, Water for life: [[A Comprehensive Assessment of Water Management in Agriculture]].'' Earthscan/IWMI, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Increased agricultural productivity enables farmers to grow more food, which translates into better diets and, under market conditions that offer a level playing field, into higher farm incomes. With more money, farmers are more likely to diversify production and grow higher-value crops, benefiting not only themselves but the economy as a whole."&lt;ref name="IFPRI 2003"&gt;{{cite book|title=Agriculture, Food Security, Nutrition, and the Millennium Development Goals: Annual Report Essay|year=2003|publisher=IFPRI|url=http://www.ifpri.org/publication/agriculture-food-security-nutrition-and-millenium-development-goals|author1=Joachim von Braun |author2=M.S. Swaminathan |author3=Mark W. Rosegrant |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers suggest forming an alliance between the emergency food program and [[community-supported agriculture]], as some countries' food stamps cannot be used at farmer's markets and places where food is less processed and grown locally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=McCullum|first=Christine|author2=Desjardins, Ellen |author3=Kraak, Vivica I. |author4=Ladipo, Patricia |author5= Costello, Helen |title=Evidence-based strategies to build community food security|journal=Journal of the American Dietetic Association|date=1 February 2005|volume=105|issue=2|pages=278–283|doi=10.1016/j.jada.2004.12.015}}&lt;!--|accessdate=March 16, 2011--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
The gathering of wild food plants appears to be an efficient alternative method of subsistence in tropical countries, which may play a role in poverty alleviation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Claudio O. Delang |title=The role of wild food plants in poverty alleviation and biodiversity conservation in tropical countries |journal=Progress in Development Studies |year=2006 |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=275–286 |doi=10.1191/1464993406ps143oa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Large-scale food stockpiling===
The minimum annual global wheat storage is approximately two months.&lt;ref&gt;Thien Do, Kim Anderson, B. Wade Brorsen. "The World's wheat supply." ''Oklahoma Cooperative Extension Service''&lt;/ref&gt; To counteract the severe food security issues caused by [[global catastrophic risks]], years of [[food storage]] has been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Maher | first1 = TM Jr | last2 = Baum | first2 = SD | year = 2013 | title = Adaptation to and recovery from global catastrophe | url = | journal = Sustainability | volume = 5 | issue = 4| pages = 1461–1479 | doi=10.3390/su5041461}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this could ameliorate smaller scale problems like regional conflict and drought, it would exacerbate current food insecurity by raising food prices.

===Agricultural insurances===
Insurance is a financial instrument, which allows exposed individuals to pool resources to spread their risk. They do so by contributing premium to an insurance fund, which will indemnify those who suffer insured loss. This procedure reduces the risk for an individual by spreading his/her risk among the multiple fund contributors. Insurance can be designed to protect many types of individuals and assets against single or multiple perils and buffer insured parties against sudden and dramatic income or asset loss.

Crop insurance is purchased by agricultural producers to protect themselves against either the loss of their crops due to natural disasters. Two type of insurances are available:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = de Leeuw | first1 = Jan | last2 = Vrieling | first2 = Anton | last3 = Shee | first3 = Apurba | last4 = Atzberger | first4 = Clement | last5 = Hadgu | first5 = Kiros M. | last6 = Biradar | first6 = Chandrashekhar M. | last7 = Keah | first7 = Humphrey | last8 = Turvey | first8 = Calum | year = 2014 | title = The Potential and Uptake of Remote Sensing in Insurance: A Review | url = | journal = Remote Sens. | volume = 6 | issue = 11| pages = 10888–10912 | doi = 10.3390/rs61110888 | bibcode = 2014RemS....610888D }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1) claim-based insurances, and (2) index-based insurances. In particular in poor countries facing food security problems, index-based insurances offer some interesting advantages: (1) indices can be derived from globally available satellite images that correlate well with what is insured; (2) these indices can be delivered at low cost; and (3) the insurance products open up new markets that are not served by claim-based insurances.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}

An advantage of index-based insurance is that it can potentially be delivered at lower cost. A significant barrier that hinders uptake of claim-based insurance is the high transaction cost for searching for prospective policyholders, negotiating and administering contracts, verifying losses and determining payouts. Index insurance eliminates the loss verification step, thereby mitigating a significant transaction cost. A second advantage of index-based insurance is that, because it pays an indemnity based on the reading of an index rather than individual losses, it eliminates much of the fraud, moral hazard and adverse selection, which are common in classical claim-based insurance. A further advantage of index insurance is that payments based on a standardized and indisputable index also allow for a fast indemnity payment. The indemnity payment could be automated, further reducing transaction costs.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}

Basis risk is a major disadvantage of index-based insurance. It is the situation where an individual experiences a loss without receiving payment or vice versa. Basis risk is a direct result of the strength of the relation between the index that estimates the average loss by the insured group and the loss of insured assets by an individual. The weaker this relation the higher the basis risk. High basis risk undermines the willingness of potential clients to purchase insurance. It thus challenges insurance companies to design insurances such as to minimize basis risk.{{relevance inline|date=November 2015}}

=== Food Justice Movement ===
{{Main|Food Justice Movement}}
The Food Justice Movement has been seen as a unique and multifaceted movement with relevance to the issue of food security. It has been described as a movement about social-economic and political problems in connection to [[environmental justice]], improved nutrition and health, and activism. Today, a growing number of individuals and minority groups are embracing the Food Justice due to the perceived increase in hunger within nations such as the United States as well as the amplified effect of food insecurity on many minority communities, particularly the Black and Latino communities'''.'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hilmers|first=Angela|last2=Hilmers|first2=David C.|last3=Dave|first3=Jayna|date=2017-04-24|title=Neighborhood Disparities in Access to Healthy Foods and Their Effects on Environmental Justice|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=102|issue=9|pages=1644–1654|doi=10.2105/AJPH.2012.300865|issn=0090-0036| pmc=3482049 |pmid=22813465}}&lt;/ref&gt; A number of organizations have either championed the Food Justice Cause or greatly impacted the Food Justice space. An example of a prominent organization within the food justice movement has been the [[Coalition of Immokalee Workers]], which is a worker-based human rights organization that has been recognized globally for its accomplishments in the areas of human trafficking, social responsibility and gender-based violence at work. The Coalition of Immoaklee Workers most prominent accomplishment related to the food justice space has been its part in implementing the [[Fair Food Program]] which increased the pay and bettered working conditions of farm workers in the tomato industry who had been exploited for generations. This accomplishment provided over 30,000 workers more income and the ability to access better and more healthy foods for themselves and their families. Another organization in the food justice space is the Fair Food Network, an organization that has embraced the mission of helping familIes who need healthy food to gain access to it while also increasing the livelihoold for farmers in America and growing local economies. Started by [[Oran B. Hesterman|Oran B. Hesterma]], the Fair Food Network has invested over $200 million in various projects and initiatives, such as the Double Up Food Bucks program, to help low-income and minority communities access healthier food.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://fairfoodnetwork.org/who-we-are/#|title=Who We Are|work=Fair Food Network|access-date=2017-04-20|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bees===

Bees and other pollinating insects are currently improving the food production of 2 billion small farmers worldwide, helping to ensure food security for the world's population. Research shows that if pollination is managed well on small diverse farms, with all other factors being equal, crop yields can increase by a significant median of 24 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Food Security, Quality through Bees|url=http://abclive.in/food-security-quality-bees/|accessdate=7 September 2016|agency=ABC Live|publisher=ABC Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

How animal [[pollinator]]s positively affect fruit condition and [[nutrient]] content is still being discovered.&lt;ref&gt;Wendee Nicole [http://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/123-A210/ Pollinator Power: Nutrition Security Benefits of an Ecosystem Service] ''Environ Health Perspect''. {{doi|10.1289/ehp.123-A210}}, quote "We have spent far too long looking solely at calories as the answer to food security, and not nutrition security."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
{{As of| 2015}} the concept of food security has mostly focused on food calories rather than the quality and [[nutrition]] of food. The concept of nutrition security evolved over time. In 1995, it has been defined as "adequate nutritional status in terms of protein, energy, vitamins, and minerals for all household members at all times".&lt;ref&gt;QAgnes R. Quisumbing, Lynn R.

{{Infobox artwork/wikidata}}
The '''''Founding Fathers of Merseyside Football''''' is a series of oil paintings which celebrate the contributions of the men who kick-started and shaped the game in the nineteenth century.

==Background==
The artwork came about after the discovery of a Sepia tone photograph of Ben Chambers in a long-lost album containing those of the [[Methodist]] ministers who had served the St Domingo congregation. On behalf of the Everton Shareholders’ Association, [[David France]] commissioned Wasan Suttikasem to produce a formal portrait of Rev Chambers and subsequently added the other individuals who influenced the direction of Merseyside football.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpoolecho.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2009/06/30/david-france-takes-everton-and-liverpool-founding-fathers-back-home-100252-24022872 |title=David France takes Everton and Liverpool founding fathers back home |author= |date=30 June 2009 |work= |publisher=The Liverpool Echo |accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.liverpooldailypost.co.uk/everton-fc/everton-fc-news/2009/07/01/the-father-figures-who-helped-shape-merseyside-football-92534-24038903 |title=The father figures who helped shape Merseyside football |author=David Prentice |date=1 July 2009 |work= |publisher=The Liverpool Daily Post |accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toffeeweb.com/season/09-10/comment/editorial/article.asp?submissionID=12217 |title=The Founding Fathers of Merseyside Football |author=David France |date=2 July 2009 |work= |publisher= |accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Merseyside Six Appeal |author= |date=5 July 2009 |publisher=LFC Magazine |accessdate=9 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The six pioneers are Rev Ben Chambers, [[John Houlding]], [[Clement Baxter|Dr James Baxter]], [[George Mahon (accountant)|George Mahon]], John McKenna and [[Will Cuff]], none of whom ever kicked a competitive football.

The six paintings will be exhibited together and rotated around different venues on Merseyside and beyond to promote stronger links between the two clubs.&lt;ref name="ESA-booklet"&gt;“The Founding Fathers of Merseyside Football.” David France &amp; Peter Lupson. Everton Shareholders’ Association booklet (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pen Pictures==

===The Godfather of Merseyside Football===
'''Ben Swift Chambers (1845–1901)'''
By 1877, Rev Chambers’ career in the Methodist ministry brought him to the New Connexion Chapel in Liverpool. Once settled at St Domingo’s he became an avid supporter of the [[Band of Hope]] movement, a temperance organisation for working-class youngsters, and formed a cricket club to provide local youngsters with healthy exercise as well as the opportunity to develop the qualities of Christian sportsmanship. To that end Chambers persuaded the members of Young Men’s Bible Class to start [[St. Domingo's F.C.|St Domingo Football Club]] in 1878.&lt;ref name="ESA-booklet" /&gt;
{{clear}}

===King John of Everton===
[[image:John Houlding.jpg|right|150px|John Houlding]]'''John Houlding (1833–1902)'''
The prosperous brewer was active as a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] councillor for the [[Everton, Liverpool|Everton]] &amp; [[Kirkdale, Merseyside|Kirkdale]] ward and eventually as [[Lord Mayor of Liverpool]]. As the first president of Everton Football Club, he ushered the club from [[Stanley Park, Liverpool|Stanley Park]] to the [[Anfield]] ground adjacent to his Sandon Hotel and masterminded the 10-year transformation from amateur enthusiasts into League champions. It was as an [[Orange Order|Orangeman]] and Anfield landlord that he gained notoriety. He sought to charge more rent after the club became successful. This brought Houlding into conflict with the Everton committee before he served them with a notice to quit in 1892 and recruited a new squad of players for his new club. Within nine seasons [[Liverpool Football Club]] was anointed League champions.&lt;ref name="ESA-booklet" /&gt;
{{clear}}

===The Good Doctor of Robson Street===
'''James Clement Baxter (1857–1928)'''
His dedication to the welfare of his patients, Irish migrants, the poor and local orphans, is legendary. It was almost matched by his devotion to [[Everton Football Club]]. Dr Baxter provided substantial funds to finance the construction of [[Goodison Park]]. James Baxter was a passionate Evertonian who served as a director, chairman and club doctor for nearly four decades. Born in Liverpool, the devout Roman Catholic also took an active part in local politics, serving as a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] councillor for the St Anne’s ward from 1906 until 1920. His son Cecil succeeded him on the board and as the club doctor. This resulted in an unbroken link of 65 years between his family and his football club.&lt;ref name="ESA-booklet" /&gt;
{{clear}}

===Blue Moses===
'''George Mahon (1853–1908)'''
Liverpool-born son of Dubliner parents, partner at the accounting firm of Roose, Mahon &amp; Howard, organist at Great Homer Street [[Wesleyan]] Chapel and a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] politician, George Mahon was elected to the Everton committee in 1889. He clashed with John Houlding on the proposed improvements to the rented ground at Anfield, the term of the lease and also the size of the rent. Also he opposed the use of the Sandon Hotel as the club’s headquarters and, anticipating expulsion from Anfield, arranged to lease Mere Green from Mr. CJ Leyland. In his role as Everton’s first chairman, Mahon oversaw progress to two FA Cup finals before capturing the trophy in 1906. However, he will be always be celebrated as the man who led the club to the promised land in 1892.&lt;ref name="ESA-booklet" /&gt;&lt;ref name="George Mahon Biography"&gt;[http://georgemahon.webs.com George Mahon Biography].&lt;/ref&gt;
{{clear}}

===Honest John of Liverpool===
'''John McKenna (1855–1938)'''
John McKenna was one of the many [[Ulster]]men who came to Merseyside in search of work. A [[Freemason]], Orangeman and Tory, he sided with John Houlding after ‘The Split’. Subsequently, he was appointed secretary-manager and recruited the famous ‘Team of Macs’ which facilitated Liverpool’s admission to Division 2 and eventual elevation to the top flight. Afterwards, McKenna concentrated on his administrative duties and served his club faithfully for four decades or so, during which time it captured the League title on three occasions. He retired in 1922 to devote his energies to the [[Football League]]. His friendship with Will Cuff created deep bonds between the Reds and the Blues.&lt;ref name="ESA-booklet" /&gt;
{{clear}}

===Mr Everton===
'''Will Cuff (1868–1949)'''
While respected as the choir-master and trustee at St Domingo Chapel, Will Cuff (1868–1949) was venerated at Everton. Unquestionably the most successful administrator in Everton’s history, the local solicitor served as secretary, director and chairman and effectively ruled the club with an iron hand for four decades. Cuff’s first tastes of success were the 1906 FA Cup win and the 1914/15 League title. As chairman, he led the club to the 1926/27 and 1931/32 League titles and the 1933 FA Cup triumph. Cuff stood down at the start of the successful 1938/39 season in order to replace his friend John McKenna as the President of the Football League but will always be remembered as the man who demanded ‘[[School of Science (Everton Academy)|School of Science]]’ style of play.&lt;ref name="ESA-booklet" /&gt;

'''Genetically modified mammals''' are [[mammal]]s that have been [[genetic engineering|genetically engineered]]. They are an important category of [[genetically modified organism]]s. The majority of research involving genetically modified mammals involves mice with attempts to produce knockout animals in other mammalian species limited by the inability to derive and stably culture [[embryonic stem cells]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 14| volume = 103| journal = Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America| pages = 5285–5290| year = 2006| doi = 10.1073/pnas.0600813103| pmc = 1459347| pmid = 16567624| title = Suppression of prion protein in livestock by RNA interference | first5 = M. | first2 = C.| last2 = Long | first1 = M.| last3 = Carmell | first3 = M.| last5 = Westhusin | first4 = G.| last4 = Hannon| last1 = Golding|bibcode = 2006PNAS..103.5285G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The majority of genetically modified mammals are used in research to investigate changes in [[phenotype]] when specific genes are altered. This can be used to discover the function of an unknown gene, any genetic interactions that occur or where the gene is [[Gene expression|expressed]]. Genetic modification can also produce mammals that are susceptible to certain compounds or stresses for testing in biomedical research.&lt;ref name="pmid10434294"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Sathasivam K, Hobbs C, Mangiarini L, etal |title=Transgenic models of Huntington's disease |journal=[[Philos.

Other mammals have been engineered with the aim of potentially increasing their use to medicine and industry. These possibilities include pigs expressing human antigens aiming to increasing the success of [[xenotransplantation]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| issue = 6| volume = 7| pages = 525–539| year = 1998| doi = 10.1016/S0963-6897(98)00043-8| pmid = 9853581| journal = Cell Transplantation| title = Xenogeneic cell therapy: current progress and future developments in porcine cell transplantation| last2 = Gosse | first1 = A. | first2 = M.| last3 = Dinsmore | first3 = J.| last1 = Edge}}&lt;/ref&gt; to lactating mammals expressing useful proteins in their milk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| pages = 541–548| issue = 6828| year = 2001| pmid = 11279484| doi = 10.1038/35069000| volume = 410| journal = Nature | first1 = F.| last2 = Knight | first2 = D.| title = Liquid crystalline spinning of spider silk| last1 = Vollrath|bibcode = 2001Natur.410..541V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Genetically modified mice==
{{main|Genetically modified mouse}}
Genetically modified mice are often used to study cellular and tissue-specific responses to disease (cf [[knockout mouse]]). This is possible since mice can be created with the same [[mutation]]s that occur in human [[genetic disorder]]s, the production of the human disease in these mice then allows treatments to be tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wagner J, Thiele F, Ganten D |title=Transgenic animals as models for human disease |journal=Clin. Exp. Hypertens. |volume=17 |issue=4 |pages=593–605 |date=May 1995 |pmid=7795575 |doi=10.3109/10641969509037410}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The  [[oncomouse]] is a type of [[mus musculus|laboratory mouse]] that has been [[Genetic engineering|genetically modified]] developed by [[Philip Leder]] and Timothy A. Stewart of [[Harvard University]] to carry a specific [[gene]] called an activated [[oncogene]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EPO Register|appno=85304490|patno=0169672|patent=yes}}, under "''Inventor(s)''". Consulted on February 22, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Metabolic supermice]] are the creation of a team of [[United States|American]] scientists led by Richard Hanson, professor of [[biochemistry]] at [[Case Western Reserve University]] at [[Cleveland, Ohio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[BioSteel]] is a [[trademark]] name for a high-strength based fiber material made of the recombinant [[spider silk]]-like protein extracted from the milk of [[transgenic]] [[goat]]s, made by Nexia Biotechnologies. The company has successfully generated distinct lines of goats that produce in their milk recombinant versions of either the MaSpI or MaSpII dragline silk proteins, respectively. Nexia Biotechnologies, however, went bankrupt and is no longer company.&lt;ref&gt;Biopolymer, Volume 8 Polyamides and Complex Proteinaceous Materials II, edited by S.R. Fahnestock &amp; A.

The '''Gümüşlük International Classical Music Festival''' is held in the small fishing village of [[Gümüşlük]], [[Bodrum]], on the south west coast of Turkey. It began in 2004 and between 2006 and 2012 was organised by ''Bodrum Klasik Müzik Derneği'' (Classical Music Association of Bodrum), founded in 2006 for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.annalindhfoundation.org/members/bodrum-klasik-muzik-dernegi&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 the festival expanded its programming to include a dedicated guitar week, and a series of jazz concerts. The Gümüşlük Festival Academy is organised annually parallel to the festival.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gumuslukfestival.org/tr/gfa/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''James John (J.J.) Haldane Burgess''' (1862–1927) was a Shetland historian, poet, novelist, violinist, linguist and [[socialist]], a noted figure in [[Shetland]]'s cultural history. His published works include ''Rasmie's Büddie, Some Shetland Folk, Tang, The Treasure of Don Andreas, Rasmie's Kit, Rasmie's Smaa Murr'', and ''The Viking Path'', the latter being translated into German. He was one of the Shetlanders who gave assistance to [[Jakob Jakobsen]], in his researches into the [[Norn language]] in Shetland.

==Early life==
Burgess was born on 28 May 1862. He was a son of [[Lerwick]], whose grandfather had left [[Dunrossness]] as a soldier during the [[Napoleonic period]] and lived in [[Edinburgh]] for a time before settling in 'da toon' as a shopkeeper.

Haldane Burgess won first place in the [[Glasgow Bursary Competition]]. He spent four years as a teacher in [[Bressay]] in order to pay for his university education. He studied [[divinity]] at [[Edinburgh University]], but found himself in disagreement with certain doctrines. He lost his sight in his last year of study,&lt;ref name = NewShetlander&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shetlanddialect.org.uk/j.j-haldane-burgess|title=J.J. Haldane Burgess (quoted from New Shetlander No 164, 1988)|website=Shetland Dialect|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; took his final exams orally and returned to Lerwick. Later his promotion of socialist ideas made him a popular and radical figure. He was a major supporter of the development of the Shetland Festival [[Up Helly Aa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shetlandmuseumandarchives.org.uk/collections/archive/people-estates-businesses-and-societies/j.j-haldane-burgess|title=J.J. Haldane Burgess|website=Shetland Museum &amp; Archives|access-date=2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Writings==
He was a linguist and a champion of [[Esperanto]].&lt;ref name = NewShetlander/&gt;  He developed a lifelong interest in Norse culture and taught himself [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], later contributing articles to journals in Norway. In his lifetime he was best known for a novel entitled ''The Viking Path – A Tale of The White Christ'' (1894), set in Shetland and Norway at the coming of Christianity. The best-known of his work now is probably his verse in dialect, as published in ''Rasmie's Büddie: poems in the Shetlandic'' (1891), which was republished in 1913, and later in 1979 with illustrations by [[Frank Walterson]]. The poem 'Scranna' is one of the acknowledged classics of [[Shetlandic literature]].

[[Laurence I. Graham]], in his essay "Shetland Literature and the idea of community" in ''Shetland’s Northern Links: Language and History'' (1996), writes that his novel ''Tang'' "...&amp;nbsp;was written in the closing years of the last century. It tells the story of a young girl, Inga, and her divided love for two men: one, her devoted admirer, a steady, hard working fisherman, and the other, a newly arrived minister, young, idealistic, unsure of himself and very susceptible to feminine charm and persuasion. It also presents a picture of a small community of crofter-fishermen, their women-folk, the merchant, the teacher, the minister and the laird. Burgess brings out the darker side of this community, the hypocrisy and occasional dishonesty, the servility of some crofters towards the gentry, the malicious gossip, the petty jealousies and spitefulness within the congregation and the damage done by itinerant hot-gospellers and their infernal, illegitimate-producing revival meetings' as Hakki, the agnostic schoolmaster, calls them. The novel certainly gives an unflattering picture of what passed for religious life at this period&amp;nbsp;... The arguments between Hakki, the outspoken agnostic, and the minister and laird are among the highlights of the book and it is obvious where the author's sympathies lie. It is certainly an unusual novel for its time when the Scottish [[Kailyard school]] of writing was still at its height&amp;nbsp;..."

==Personal==
A street in Lerwick, Haldane Burgess Crescent, is named after him. His younger brother [[William A. S. Burgess]] was also an author.

On October 5, 2017, Silva Batista was considered a heroine for saving several children from a fire at the Gente Inocente nursery in [[Janaúba]], [[Minas Gerais]]. Heley, who came to fight with the watchman who ignited the fire, had ninety percent of her body burned, which led to her death.

After the wake, which gathered hundreds of people at the municipal funeral home, the coffin with the body of the teacher was placed in a truck of the [[Military Firefighters Corps|Fire Department]] and a procession was carried through the streets of the city to the São Lucas Cemetery. 

In 2005, Silva Batista lost her child, drowned in the pool of a club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/cotidiano/2017/10/1925168-heroina-professora-que-tentou-salvar-criancas-em-mg-perdeu-filho-afogado.shtml Heroína', professora que tentou salvar crianças em MG perdeu filho afogado] {{pt icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[heraldry]] and [[vexillology]], a '''heraldic flag''' is a [[flag]] containing [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], [[heraldic badge]]s, or other devices used for personal identification. 

Heraldic flags include '''banners, standards, pennons''' and their variants, '''gonfalons''', '''guidons''', and '''pinsels'''.  Specifications governing heraldic flags vary from country to country, and have varied over time. 

==Types of heraldic flags==

===Pennon===
{{main article|Pennon}}
The pennon is a small elongated flag, either pointed or swallow-tailed (when swallow-tailed it may be described as a [[banderole]]{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}). It was charged with the [[heraldic badge]] or some other armorial ensign of the owner, and displayed on his own lance, as a personal ensign. The ''pennoncelle'' was a modification of the pennon.&lt;ref name="Boutell"&gt;{{harvnb|Boutell|1914|pp=246-251}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary Scots usage, the pennon is four feet long. It tapers either to a point or to a rounded end as the owner chooses. It is assigned by the [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] to any armiger who wishes to apply for it.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"&gt;{{harvnb|''lyon-court.com''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Banner===
{{main article|Banner of arms}}
[[File:Funeral Elisabeth.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Heraldic banners at the funeral of [[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]]. The queen's casket is escorted by mourners bearing the banners of her ancestors' arms marshalled with the arms of their wives.&lt;ref&gt;From a manuscript of 1603.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The [[banner of arms]] (also simply called ''banner'') is square or oblong and larger than the pennon, bearing the entire coat of arms of the owner, composed precisely as upon a shield but in a square or rectangular shape.&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

{{quote|In the olden time, when a Knight had distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry, it was the custom to mark his meritorious conduct by prompt advancement on the very field of battle. In such a case, the point or points of the good Knight’s Pennon were rent off, and thus the ... small Flag was reduced to the square form of the Banner, by which thenceforth he was to be distinguished|- Charles Boutell, ''The Handbook to English Heraldry''&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;}}

The banners of members of [[Order of chivalry|Orders of Chivalry]] are typically displayed in the Order's chapel.  Banners of Knights of the [[Order of the Thistle]] are hung in the 1911 chapel of the Order in [[St Giles Cathedral|St Giles High Kirk]] in [[Edinburgh]].{{sfn|Burnett|Hodgson|2001|pp=6–7}}  [[Order of the Garter#Garter Banners in St George's Chapel|Banners of Knights]] of the [[Order of the Garter]] are displayed in [[St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle]].  From Victorian times Garter banners have been approximately 5 feet by 5 feet.{{sfn|Johnston|2011}}

Banners became available to all English armigers as a result of a report by Garter to the Earl Marshal dated 29 January 1906.  The report stated that the size of banner for Esquires and Gentlemen should be considered in the future.&lt;ref name="Garter Woodcock 2011"&gt;{{harvnb|Woodcock|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Until that date they were available to all noblemen and knights banneret.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Berry|1830|p={{page needed|date=July 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2011, Garter Woodcock said that the banner for an Esquire or Gentleman should be the same size as a Marquess’s and those of a lower rank down to Knight, that is, 3 feet by 3 feet.&lt;ref name="Garter Woodcock 2011"/&gt;

In [[Scotland]], the size of personal banners, excluding any fringes, are specified by the [[Lord Lyon]].&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;
{|
|+ '''Scottish Banners'''

|Rank || Banner Size
|-
|The Sovereign||1.50 metres square
|-
|[[Duke]]s||1.25 metres square
|-
|[[Earl]]s||1.10 metres square
|-
|[[Viscount]]s and [[Baron]]s||1.00 metres square
|-
|[[Baronet]]s and [[Prescriptive Barony|Feudal Barons]]||0.90 metres square
|-
|Other [[Armiger]]s||70 centimetres wide x 85 centimetres high&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;
|}

===Standard===
[[File:Stafford flag.png|left|thumb|300px|Standard of Sir Henry de Stafford, about 1475, features the [[Stafford knot]] and [[Bohun swan]] [[heraldic badge]]s differenced with a ''crescent gules'' for [[cadency]]. The standard bears the [[St George's Cross|Cross of Saint George]] for England.  Black and red (''sable and gules'') are Sir Henry's livery colours.{{sfn|Boutell|1914|p=251}}]]

The heraldic standard appeared about the middle of the fourteenth century, and was in general use by personages of high rank in the two following centuries.  The standard appears to have been adopted for the special purpose of displaying badges. "The badge was worn on his livery by a servant as retainer, and consequently the standard by which he mustered in camp was of the livery colours, and bore the badge, with both of which the retainer was familiar."&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

Heraldic flags that are used by individuals, like a monarch, as a means of identification are often called ''standards'' (e.g. [[royal standard]]). These flags, more usually ''banners'', however are not standards in a strict heraldic sense but have come to be known as such. A standard is not rectangular: it tapers, usually from 4 feet down to 2 feet, and the [[flag terminology|fly]] edge is rounded (lanceolate). In [[England]] any armiger who has been granted a badge is entitled to fly a standard.

The medieval English standard was larger than the other flags, and its size varied with the owner’s rank. The [[St George's Cross|Cross of St. George]] usually appeared next to the staff, and the rest of the field was generally divided ''per fess'' (horizontally) into two colours, in most cases the livery colours of the owner. "With some principal figure or device occupying a prominent position, various badges are displayed over the whole field, a [[motto]], which is placed bend-wise, having divided the standard into compartments. The edges are fringed throughout, and the extremity is sometimes swallow-tailed, and sometimes rounded."&lt;ref name="Boutell" /&gt;

[[File:Flag of Early Medieval Kingdom of Leon.svg|thumb|right|330px|Standard of the [[Kingdom of León|Leonese Monarchs]] during the Middle Ages (until the 13th century). It's one of the oldest heraldic flags; the documentation for the colours dates from c. 1150.&lt;ref name=" Chronicle"&gt;{{harvnb|Lipskey|1972|p={{page needed|date=July 2016}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[Oriflamme]] was the [[royal standard]] of the [[King of France]] during the [[Middle Ages]].

In [[Scotland]], a standard requires a separate grant by the [[Lord Lyon]]. Such a grant is only made if certain conditions are met.

The length of the standard depends upon one’s [[Peerage|noble rank]].&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

|-
|[[Duke]]s||20 feet

|[[Marquis]]es||18 feet
|-

|-
|[[Viscount]]s||15 feet
|-
|[[Lords of Parliament]]||13 feet
|-
|[[Baronets]]||12 feet
|-
|[[Knight]]s and [[Prescriptive Barony|Feudal Barons]]||10 feet&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;
|}

===Banderole===
{{main article|Banderole}}

A '''Banderole''' ([[French language|Fr.]] for a "little banner"), has both a literal descriptive meaning for its use by knights and ships, and is also heraldic device for representing bishops.{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|p=312}}

===Gonfalone===
[[File:Royal Banner of Denmark (14th Century).svg|thumb|160px|Royal Banner of the King of Denmark in the 14th century, based on the [[Coat of arms of Denmark|Royal Arms of Denmark]].]]
{{main article|Gonfalone}}

A gonfalone or gonfalon is a vertically hung banner emblazoned with a coat of arms.  Gonfalons have wide use in civic, religious, and academic heraldry.  The term originated in [[Florence]], [[Italy]], where communities, or neighborhoods, traditionally displayed ''gonfaloni'' in public ceremonies.

=== Guidon ===

&lt;!-- Image with inadequate rationale removed: [[File:RGH Guidon small.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Guidon of the Royal Gloucestershire Hussars]] --&gt;

The Scots guidon is similar in shape to the standard and pennon.  At 6.5' long, it is smaller than the standard and twice the size of the pennon. Guidons are assigned by the Lord Lyon to those individuals who qualify for a grant of supporters to their Arms and to other individuals who have a following such as individuals who occupy a position of leadership or a long-term official position commanding the loyalty of more than a handful of people. The Guidon tapers to a round, unsplit end at the fly.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

A guidon can also refer to a cavalry troop's banner, such as that which survived the Custer massacre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40608795/ns/us_news-life/#.USl8s1f_rOc|title=Custer's 'Last Flag' sells for $2.2 million|author=|date=10 December 2010|website=nbcnews.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pinsel ===
The Scottish pinsel is triangular in shape, 2.5 feet high at the hoist and 4.5 feet in width tapering to a point. This is the flag denoting a person to whom a [[Scottish clan|Clan]] Chief has delegated authority for a particular occasion, such as a [[clan gathering]] when the Chief is absent. This flag is allotted only to Chiefs or very special Chieftain-Barons for practical use, and only upon the specific authority of the Lord Lyon King of Arms.&lt;ref name="lyonflag"/&gt;

'''Hilma Natalia Granqvist''' (17 July 1890 [[Sipoo]] – 25 February 1972 [[Helsinki]]) was a [[Swedish-speaking Finns|Swedish-speaking]] [[Finland|Finnish]] [[anthropologist]] who conducted long field studies of [[Palestinians]]. She was a student of [[Edvard Westermarck]].

==Studies==
In the 1920s Granqvist arrived at the village of  [[Artas (village)|Artas]], just outside [[Bethlehem]] in the then [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]] as part of her research on the women of the Old Testament. She had gone to Palestine "in order to find the Jewish ancestors of Scripture". What she found instead was a Palestinian people with a distinct culture and way of life. She therefore changed the focus of her research to a full investigation of the customs, habits and ways of thinking of the people of that village. Granqvist ended up staying until 1931 documenting all aspects of village life. In so doing she took hundreds of photographs."&lt;ref&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/535/cu1.htm Other Palestines.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820125721/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2001/535/cu1.htm |date=2007-08-20 }} 24–30 May 2001 Al-Ahram Weekly Online.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example of wedding song, recorded by Granqvist ==
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"God knows that our outfit today&lt;br&gt;
A hundred ‘royal’ robes which we have cut&lt;br&gt;
For the bride to whom we are betrothed.&lt;br&gt;
God knows – today is our outfit&lt;br&gt;
A green and a ‘royal’ [malak] dress we have bought&lt;br&gt;
For the bride to whom we are betrothed!&lt;br&gt;
Ten jackets [taqsireh] have we bought&lt;br&gt;
For the beloved ones in order to appease her"&lt;br&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6632">In [[music therapy]] '''improvisation''' is defined as a process where the client and therapist relate to each other. The client makes up music, [[musical improvisation]], while singing or playing, extemporaneously creating a [[melody]], [[rhythm]], [[song]], or instrumental piece. In '''clinical improvisation''', client and therapist (or client and other clients) relate to one another through the music. Improvisation may occur individually, in a duet, or in a group. The client may use any musical or nonmusical medium within his or her capabilities. Musical media includes voice, body sound, [[percussion]], and string, wind, and [[keyboard instruments]]. Nonmusical media can consist of images, titles, and stories.

== How improvisation fits into music therapy ==

[[Music therapy]] is a systematic process; it is not a series of random events. Systematic means that music therapy is "purposeful, organized, methodical, knowledge-based, and regulated" (Bruscia 1998). One of the most important features is its methodical processes. Methodical means that music therapy always proceeds in an orderly fashion. It involves three basic steps: [[Psychological assessment|assessment]], treatment, and [[evaluation]]. Treatment is the part of a music therapy process in which the therapist engages the client in various musical experiences, employing specific methods and in-the-moment techniques. When planning treatment, the music therapist has to select the types of music and music experiences that will be most relevant to the client. There are four basic types of music experiences, or methods, in which a client may be engaged: listening, re-creating, [[musical composition|composition]], and [[improvisation]].

== Characteristics of improvisation in music therapy==

Clinical Improvisation is a generative and creative process of musical intervention involving the client's spontaneous creation of sounds and music. It helps the client to explore aspects of self, in relation to others, in an appropriate way. Improvisation also generates new and individualized [[musical forms]]. Using musical improvisation in a therapeutic setting can increase independence. The interactive use of improvisation facilitates [[problem-solving]], because it is flexible rather than predetermined. Getting the client involved in an improvisational experience can develop [[social skills]] and interaction.

== Clinical goals of improvisation experiences ==

According to Bruscia (1998), clinical goals that can be achieved through improvisation are as follows:
# Establish a nonverbal channel of communication, and a bridge to [[verbal communication]]
# Provide a fulfilling means of [[self-expression]] and [[identity formation]]
# Explore various aspects of self in relation to others
# Develop the capacity for interpersonal intimacy
# Develop group skills
# Develop [[creativity]], expressive freedom, and playfulness with various degrees of structure
# Stimulate and develop the senses
# Play, on the spot, with a decisiveness that invites clarity of [[intention]]
# Develop perceptual and [[cognitive skills]]

== Improvisational methods and their variations ==

Improvisation can be carried out with both musical and nonmusical references. (Bruscia 1987, 10)
* '''Referential improvisations''' are those in which the client improvises to portray a nonmusical reference (e.g., an event, feeling, image, relationship, etc.)
* '''Non-referential improvisations''' are those in which the client improvises without reference to anything other than the sounds or music.
* Frequently used variations are as follows:

{| class="wikitable"
|- bgcolor="#CCCCCC" align="center"
| '''Variations''' || '''Explanations'''
|-
|Instrumental referential ||align="left"| creating music on a musical instrument according to a given reference
|-
|Instrumental non-referential ||align="left"| creating music on a musical instrument without reference
|-
|Song improvisation ||align="left"| creating lyrics, melody, and accompaniment to a song
|-
|Vocal non-referential ||align="left"| creating a vocal piece without words or images
|-
|Body improvisation ||align="left"| creating various kinds of body sounds
|-
|Mixed media ||align="left"| creating a piece with any combination of instrumental, vocal, or body sounds
|-
|Conducted improvisation ||align="left"| creating a piece by giving directive cues to one or more improvisers
|-
|}

== Basic therapeutic techniques ==

[[Bruscia]] (1987) and Wigram (2004) introduced a variety of improvisational techniques in their books. Among these, there are a few major therapeutic techniques. '''Imitating''' is a basic technique of empathy in which the music therapist copies or repeats a client's response, after the response has been displayed. The music therapist focuses on any sound, rhythm, interval or even facial expression. '''Reflecting''' is a technique in which the music therapist expresses the same moods or feelings which have been presented by the client. '''Rhythmic grounding''' is implemented by establishing a steady beat or rhythm, supporting the client's improvisation. The use of a rhythmic [[ostinato]] is an example of rhythmic grounding. '''Dialoguing''' is a process in which the music therapist and the client communicate through their improvisations. Lastly, '''accompanying''' is a technique in which the music therapist supports the client's improvisation by giving an [[accompaniment]] that consists of rhythm, melody, and [[chord progressions]].

== Integration of therapeutic methods ==

It is important to have variety in music therapy sessions. Improvisation should be conducted using more than just one or two methods and techniques. It is also critical to maintain flexibility during the improvisation. For example, the music therapist can preserve a flexible session flow by incorporating several methods, such as imitating, accompanying, dialoguing, and rhythmic grounding.

'''Liminal beings''' are those that cannot easily be placed into a single category of existence. Associated with the threshold state of [[liminality]], from Latin ''līmen'', "threshold",&lt;ref&gt;"liminal", ''Oxford English Dictionary''. Ed. J.A. Simpson and E.S.C. Weiner. 2nd ed. Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1989. OED Online Oxforde 23, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; they represent and highlight the semi-autonomous boundaries of the social world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Frank |last=Musgrove |title=Margins of the Mind |location= |publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis |year=1977 |isbn= |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ga6tAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminal beings are naturally ambiguous, challenging the cultural networks of social classification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Dean A. |last=Nicholas |title=The Trickster Revisited: Deception as a Motif in the Pentateuch |location= |publisher=Peter Lang |year=2009 |isbn= |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z2hke4LUD4QC&amp;pg=PA37 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Liminal entities==

The cultural anthropologist [[Victor Turner]] considered that liminal entities, such as those undergoing initiation rites, often appeared in the form of monsters, so as to represent the co-presence of opposites—high/low; good/bad—in the liminal experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=J. C. |last=Alexander |first2=S. |last2=Seidman |title=Culture and Society |location=Cambridge |publisher= |year=1990 |isbn= |pages=147–9 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fwKvaCpvyG8C&amp;pg=PA147 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Liminal [[persona]]s are structurally and socially invisible, having left one set of classifications and not yet entered another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Thomas |last=Quartier |title=Bridging the Gaps: An Empirical Study of Catholic Funeral Rites |location= |publisher=LIT Verlag Münster |year=2007 |isbn= |pages=103–4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8-Skuq5td6IC&amp;pg=PA103 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The social anthropologist [[Mary Douglas]] has highlighted the dangerous aspects of such liminal beings,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Llynne |last=Hume |title=Portals: Opening Doorways to Other Realities Through the Senses |location= |publisher=Berg |year=2007 |isbn= |page=110 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JWGtAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but they are also potentially beneficent. Thus we often find presiding over a ritual's liminal stage a semi-human [[shaman]] figure, or a powerful [[mentorship|mentor]] with animal aspects, such as a centaur.&lt;ref&gt;Aniela Jaffe and Joseph Henderson, in C. G. Jung ed., [https://books.google.com/books?id=g_10NtfzVe0C ''Man and his Symbols''] (London 1968 p. 261-2 and p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legendary==
{{refimprove section|date=September 2017}}

By extension, liminal beings of a mixed, hybrid nature appear regularly in myth, legend and fantasy. A legendary liminal being is a [[legendary creature]] that combines two distinct states of simultaneous existence within one physical body. This unique perspective may provide the liminal being with wisdom and the ability to instruct, making them suitable [[mentor]]s, whilst also making them dangerous and [[uncanny]].

Many beings in [[fantasy]] and [[folklore]] exist in liminal states impossible in actual beings:

[[Hybrid (mythology)|Hybrids]] (two species):

* [[Centaur]]s from [[classical mythology]], among them [[Chiron]], the mentor of [[Achilles]]
* [[Cynocephali]], dog-headed humans
* [[Yali (Hindu mythology)]]
* 'A liminal figure, like the [[Sphinx]]...straddling the divide between animal and human, and partaking of both'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Teresa de |last=Lauretis |title=Freud's Drive: Psychoanalysis, Literature and Film |location=Basingstoke |publisher= |year=2008 |isbn= |page=119 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=TvoaAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA119 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both human and spirit by blood:
* [[Merlin]] is a [[cambion]], the son of a woman and an [[Incubus (demon)|incubus]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Katharine |last=Briggs |authorlink=Katharine Mary Briggs |year=1976 |title=An Encyclopedia of Fairies, Hobgoblins, Brownies, Boogies, and Other Supernatural Creatures |location=New York |publisher=Pantheon Books |chapter=Wizards |page=440 |isbn=0-394-73467-X |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G4EYAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA440 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Caliban]] in [[William Shakespeare]]'s play ''[[The Tempest]]''
* [[Abe no Seimei]], legendarily attributed a human father but a ''[[kitsune]]'' (fox spirit) mother

Both human and vegetable:
* the [[Green Man]]

Both alive and dead:
* [[ghost]]s, among them [[Tiresias]], the dead seer whom [[Odysseus]] consulted in the underworld, in the ''[[Odyssey]]''. Tiresias also had been transformed into a woman and back into a man while living, and was blind as well as a seer.
Both human and machine:
* In [[science fiction]], liminal beings include [[cyborg]]s, such as [[the Bionic Woman]] and [[Seven of Nine]] from ''[[Star Trek]]''.
Both human and [[extraterrestrial life|alien]]:
* hybrids or adoptives torn between their human and alien natures, such as [[Spock]] from ''[[Star Trek]]'' or Valentine Michael Smith from ''[[Stranger in a Strange Land]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14560">'''[[Sudbury school]]s''' practice a form of schooling in which students individually decide what to do with their time, and learn as a by-product of ordinary experience rather than through classes or a standard curriculum.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudval.org/01_abou_02.html Sudbury Valley School • About SVS - School Days] Retrieved September 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Students have complete responsibility for their own education and the school is run by a [[direct democracy]] in which students and staff have an equal vote.&lt;ref name=Ellis&gt;{{cite book|last=Ellis|first=Arthur K.|title=Exemplars of curriculum theory|publisher=Eye on Education|year=2004|isbn=1-930556-70-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 'Sudbury' name refers to [[Sudbury Valley School]], founded in 1968 in [[Framingham, Massachusetts]]. The Sudbury Valley School has been the inspiration for numerous schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psychologytoday.com/articles/200604/education-class-dismissed|title=Education: Class Dismissed|quote=Since 1991, more than three dozen Sudbury-type schools have sprouted around the country and the world.|accessdate=September 2, 2013|date=2006-05-01|work=Psychology Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; many of which refer to themselves as 'Sudbury schools.'

The Sudbury Valley School formally rejects the idea that there can be an official definition or official list of Sudbury schools and in 2016 ended its earlier practice of linking to other schools which claimed to operate in a manner similar to them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://otherschools.sudburyvalley.org/|title=Other Schools}}&lt;/ref&gt; Daniel Greenberg, one of the founders of the Sudbury Valley School has written that there are two things that distinguish a Sudbury Model school: everyone is treated equally and there is no authority other than that granted by the consent of the school community.&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite book|last=Greenberg|first=Daniel|title=A Place to Grow|publisher=Sudbury Valley School Press|year=2016|isbn=1-888947-26-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few schools which refer to themselves as Sudbury Schools continue to publish their own lists of schools for which they feel an affinity; those lists you may find referenced on the web sites of those specific schools.

* Proposed state: proposed name for a seceding or anticipated [[sovereign state]]
* Proposed autonomous area: for movements toward greater [[Autonomous area|autonomy for an area]] but not outright secession

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10604">This is a list of 100 cities in the world ranked by the number of international visitors, including all international arrivals by land, sea, or plane, for tourist or business purposes. Advisor [[Euromonitor]] and the corporation [[Mastercard]] define the concept of the foreign visitor differently thus their respective rankings differ.

Euromonitor counts a visitor only if a person spends at least 24 hours in the city. The growth column compares international arrivals to the previous year. For cities bordering directly on foreign territory, border crossings from country to country are not counted (for example between Singapore and the neighboring Malaysia).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation/core|Periodical=EMI MRX Blog|Title=Top 100 City Destinations Ranking: WTM London 2017 Edition|Date=2017-11-07|language=German|URL=https://blog.euromonitor.com/2017/11/top-100-cities-wtm-london-2017.html|AccessDate=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Mastercard Global Destinations Cities Index counts a visitor only if a person stayed overnight at least once in the city. The income column shows the amount visitors spent in each city. For cities bordering directly on foreign territory, border crossings from country to country are not counted as international visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Destination Cities Report 2016|periodical=|publisher=Mastercard|url=https://passthrough.fw-notify.net/download/669096/https://newsroom.mastercard.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/FINAL-Global-Destination-Cities-Index-Report.pdf|deadurl=|format=|accessdate=2018-07-11|archiveurl=|archivedate=|last=|date=|year=|month=|day=|language=|pages=|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decomposition00.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Maggots on a [[porcupine]] carcass.&lt;/center&gt;]]
A '''maggot''' is the [[larva]] of a [[fly]] (order [[Fly|Diptera]]); it is applied in particular to the larvae of [[Brachycera]] flies, such as [[Housefly|houseflies]], [[Piophilidae|cheese flies]], and [[Calliphoridae|blowflies]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/maggot|title=Definition of MAGGOT|website=www.merriam-webster.com|language=en|access-date=2017-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; rather than larvae of the [[Nematocera]], such as [[mosquito]]es and [[crane fly|Crane flies]]. A 2012 study estimated the population of maggots in North America alone to be in excess of 3 x 10&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; trillion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee, Klaus, Cha &amp; Linn|first=Wee L., Michael W., Dong H, Charles E.|date=January 2012|title=Abundance of apple maggot, Rhagoletis pomonella , across different areas in central Washington, with special reference to black-fruited hawthorns|url=https://academic.oup.com/jinsectscience/article/12/1/124/890223?searchresult=1|journal=Oxford Journal of Insect Science|volume=12, Issue 1|pages=124-148|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Entomology==
"Maggot" is not a technical term and should not be taken as such; in many standard textbooks of entomology it does not appear in the index at all.&lt;ref&gt;Comstock, John Henry, An Introduction to Entomology. Comstock publishing, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="isbn0-412-61390-5"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Richards, O. W. |author2=Davies, R.G. |title=Imms' General Textbook of Entomology: Volume 1: Structure, Physiology and Development Volume 2: Classification and Biology |publisher=Springer |location=Berlin |year=1977 |pages= |isbn=0-412-61390-5 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many non-technical texts the term is used for insect larvae in general. Other sources have coined their own definitions; for example: "... The term applies to a grub when all trace of limbs has disappeared ..."&lt;ref&gt;Jardine, N. K. The Dictionary of Entomology. 1913&lt;/ref&gt; and "...Applied to the footless larvae of Diptera."&lt;ref name="JBSmith"&gt;Smith, John. B. Explanation of terms used in entomology. Pub: Brooklyn Entomological Society 1906. May be downloaded from: [https://archive.org/details/explanationofter22748gut]&lt;/ref&gt;

Maggot-like fly larvae are of wide importance in [[ecology]] and [[medicine]]; among other roles, various species are prominent in recycling carrion and garbage, attacking [[Tephritidae|crops]] and [[Piophilidae|foodstuffs]], spreading microbial infections, and causing [[myiasis]].

==Uses==

===Fishing===
[[Fisherman|Angler]]s use maggots usually provided by commercial suppliers to catch non-predatory fish.
Maggots are the most popular [[fishing bait|bait]] for anglers in [[Europe]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2014}}. Anglers throw handfuls into the "swim" they are targeting, attracting the fish to the area. The angler will then use the largest or most attractive maggots on the hook, hoping to be irresistible to the fish. Commercial maggot breeders from the [[UK]] sell their maggots to tackle dealers throughout the [[E.U.]] and [[North America]].

In North America, maggots have been used primarily as [[ice fishing]] bait; recently, however, anglers have started using them year-round.

===Medical treatment===
{{Main|Maggot therapy}}

Live maggots of certain species of flies have been applied since antiquity as an effective means of wound [[debridement]]. (Use of the wrong species would invite [[Pathology|pathological]] [[myiasis]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=James, M. T. |title=The Flies That Cause Myiasis in Man |publisher=U.S. Dept. of Agriculture |location=Washington D.C. |year=1947}}&lt;/ref&gt; In controlled and sterile settings by [[medical practitioner]]s, [[maggot therapy]] introduces live, [[disinfect]]ed maggots into non-healing skin or soft wounds of a human or animal. Currently the only maggots cleared for marketing in the United States are larvae of [[Calliphoridae|Calliphorid]] flies of the species [[Common green bottle fly|Phaenicia sericata]] (formerly known as ''Lucilia sericata'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Sherman, R. A. |title=Maggot therapy takes us back to the future of wound care: new and improved maggot therapy for the 21st century |journal=J Diabetes Sci Technol. |volume= 3|issue= 2|pages= 336–344|date=March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; This species of maggots is most widely used in the world as well, but it is unclear if it is the only species cleared for marketing outside of the United States. They feed on the dead or [[Necrosis|necrotic]] tissue, leaving sound tissue largely unharmed. Studies have also shown that maggots are used to kill bacteria. There are three midgut lysozymes of ''P. sericata'' that have been confirmed to show antibacterial effects in maggot debridement therapy. The study demonstrated that the majority of gram-positive bacteria were destroyed in vivo within the particular section of the ''P. sericata'' midgut where lysozymes are produced. During the passage through the intestine of the maggots, the ability of bacteria to survive drastically decreased, implying the antibacterial action of the three midgut lysozymes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Valachova, I. |title=Midgut lysozymes of Lucilia sericata – new antimicrobials involved in maggot debridement therapy |journal=Ins Mol Biol |volume= 23|issue= 6|pages= 779–787|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2008, maggot therapy was being used in around 1,000 medical centers in Europe and over 300 medical centers in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dermnetnz.org/procedures/maggots.html Maggot debridement therapy] DermNet NZ, 19 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Forensic science===
The presence and development of maggots on a [[corpse]] are useful in the estimation of time elapsed since death. Depending on the species and the conditions, maggots may be observed on a body within 24 hours. The eggs are laid directly on the food source and when the eggs hatch, the maggots move towards their preferred conditions and begin to feed. By studying the insects present at a crime scene, [[forensic entomology|forensic entomologists]] can determine the approximate time of death. Insects are usually useful after a [[post-mortem interval]] (PMI) of approximately 25–80 hours, depending on ambient conditions. After this interval, this method becomes less reliable.

==Behaviours==
As with [[flea]]s and [[tick]]s, maggots can be a threat to household pets and [[livestock]], especially [[sheep]]. Flies [[reproduce]] rapidly in the summer months and maggots can come in large numbers, creating a maggot infestation and a high risk of [[myiasis]] (a maggot infestation of living tissue) in sheep and other animals. Humans are not immune to the feeding habits of maggots and can also contract myiasis. Interaction between humans and maggots usually occurs near [[garbage can]]s, dead animals, rotten food and other breeding grounds for maggots.

When maggots turn into adult flies and start the life cycle over, numbers will [[exponential growth|grow exponentially]] if unchecked, but disease, natural predators and parasites keep the population under control. Sealing [[waste|garbage]] and using a [[garbage disposal]] or freezing rotting leftovers until waste collection day helps prevent infestation. Introducing an environmental control, such as [[Histeridae]], can also help reduce maggot populations.

{{Notability|date=April 2017}}
'''Maleficium''' (plural: ''maleficia'') as a [[Latin language|Latin]] term, "An act of witchcraft performed with the intention of causing damage or injury; the resultant harm."  In general, the term applies to any magical act intended to cause harm or death to people or property.  Its use in English comes from "Early 17th century; earliest use found in [[George Abbot (bishop)|George Abbot]] (1562–1633), archbishop of Canterbury. From classical Latin maleficium evil deed, injury, sorcery from maleficus + -ium". In general, the term applies to any magical act intended to cause harm or death to people or property.&lt;ref name="Kierner"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kierner|first1=Cynthia A.|title=Virginia Women: Their Lives and Times|date=2015|publisher=University of Georgia Press|isbn=0820347418|page=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Witchcraft of Illinois'', Maleficium can involve the act of poisoning or drugging someone.&lt;ref name="Sorcery {{!}} occult practice"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/sorcery|title=Sorcery {{!}} occult practice|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Practitioners of maleficium are not exclusively females, although popular culture of [[witchcraft]] favors it.&lt;ref name="Kierner"/&gt; Those accused of maleficium were punished by being imprisoned or even executed.&lt;ref name="Kent"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kent|first1=E. J.|title=Masculinity and Male Witches in Old and New England, 1593–1680|journal=History Workshop Journal|date=2005|issue=60|pages=69–92|jstor=25472816}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maleficium also used the practice of torture, and it was generally considered to be performed through the power of the [[Devil]].&lt;ref name="Sorcery {{!}} occult practice"/&gt;

In 1970, new research on [[witch-hunt]]s and charges of witchcraft was conducted in the last couple of years.  It discussed all of the fears, accusations, etc. that happened in the villages.  There were different charges of maleficium that were placed due to suspicion.  Lewis and Russell stated, "''Maleficium'' was a threat not only to individuals but also to public order, for a community wracked by suspicions about witches could split asunder".&lt;ref name="Witchcraft"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/witchcraft#ref214881|title=Witchcraft|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-05-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Sorcery''', the practice of malevolent magic, derived from casting lots as a means of divining the future in the ancient Mediterranean world".&lt;ref name="en.oxforddictionaries.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/maleficium.|title=maleficium {{!}} Definition of maleficium in English by Oxford Dictionaries|website=Oxford Dictionaries {{!}} English|access-date=2018-05-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most scholars always assume that sorcery as a whole is always malevolent, but that witch craft can be good or evil.  Usually, the sorcerer and sorcery are feared by society.

During the 14th century, sorcery was more connected with cultures in India and Africa.  A person that performs sorcery is referred to as a [[sorcerer (paranormal)|sorcerer]], and they are thought of as someone that tries to reform the world through an occult.  Sorcerers were feared and respected throughout many societies and used many practices to achieve their goals. "Witches or sorcerers were usually feared as well as respected, and they used a variety of means to attempt to achieve their goals, including incantations (formulas or chants invoking evil spirits), [[divination]] and [[oracle]]s (to predict the future), [[amulet]]s and [[talisman|charms]] (to ward off hostile spirits and harmful events), [[potion]]s or salves, and dolls or other figures (to represent their enemies)".&lt;ref name="Witchcraft"/&gt;

Sorcery was also thought to sometimes rely on idols or old pagan gods, demons or the devil to get its power.  Practitioners sometimes did this by performing rituals.  One of the rituals that they performed was the slaughtering of an animal in a field to promote fertility.  Sorcerers would do this with the assisted help or power of a god, a demon, or the devil.

During the 13th century, sorcery was involved in many deaths.  They were thought to be done with magic, but were usually a result of poisoning.  In 1324, there was a very famous case involving a series of events caused by sorcery in Ireland.  Author [[George Melton]] wrote, "Lady Alice Kyteller was charged with performing magical rites, having sexual intercourse with demons, attempting to divine the future, and poisoning her first three husbands. In the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1486, "The Hammer of Witches"), the famous witch-hunter’s manual, Dominicans [[Heinrich Kramer|Heinrich Krämer]] and [[Jacob Sprenger]] associated the practice of sorcery with a group of "witches" who allegedly practiced Satanism".&lt;ref name="en.oxforddictionaries.com"/&gt;  After this, many believed that magic had to deal with the devil rather than other gods and spirits.

In the [[Byzantine Empire]] [[astrology|astrologers]] (Lat. ''mathematici'') were considered magical wrongdoers and so were [[Heresy in Christianity|heretics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gordon|first1=Richard L.|last2=Simón|first2=Francisco Marco|title=Magical Practice in the Latin West: Papers from the International Conference Held at the University of Zaragoza, 30 Sept. – 1st Oct. 2005|date=2010|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=9004179046|pages=134–135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p_Udwo-g7VIC&amp;pg=PA135|accessdate=19 April 2017|chapter=Chapter Three. Heretical texts and ''maleficium'' in the ''Codex Theodosianum'' (''CTh.'' 16.5.34)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term appears in several historically important texts, notably in the ''[[Formicarius]]'' (printed 1475) and in the ''[[Malleus Maleficarum]]'' (1487).{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

The [[Knights Templar]] were accused by [[Philip IV of France]] of maleficium. The [[trial of the Knights Templar]] set a social standard for the popular belief in maleficium and witchcraft that contributed to the [[Witch trials in the Early Modern period|great European witch hunts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cohn|first1=Norman|title=Europe's Inner Demons: The Demonization of Christians In Medieval Christendom|date=2005|publisher=Pimlico|location=London|isbn=0712657576|edition=New}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=April 2017}} In early New England, more men would get accused of such maleficium that was "non-malefic".&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;

'''Men's adventure''' is a [[literary genre|genre]] of [[magazine]] that was published in the United States from the 1940s until the early 1970s. Catering to a male audience, these magazines featured [[pin-up girl]]s and lurid tales of [[adventure]] that typically featured [[war]]time feats of daring, exotic travel or conflict with wild animals.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|last=Strausbaugh|first=John|title=Oh, Those Pulpy Days of 'Weasels Ripped My Flesh'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/12/09/books/09stra.html|accessdate=December 7, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=December 9, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; These magazines were also colloquially called "armpit slicks", "men's sweat magazines" or "the sweats", especially by people in the magazine publishing or distribution trades.

==Overview==
[[Fawcett Publications]] was having some success with their slick magazine ''[[True (magazine)|True]]'' whose stories developed more of a war focus after the U.S. entered World War II in 1941.  [[Pulp magazine]] ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]'' opted to switch to slick paper in 1943, and mix in more 'true' stories amidst the fiction.  The other major pulps ''[[Adventure (magazine)|Adventure]]'', ''[[Blue Book (magazine)|Blue Book]]'' and ''[[Short Stories (magazine)|Short Stories]]'' eventually followed suit.  Soon new magazines joined in - Fawcett's ''[[Cavalier (magazine)|Cavalier]]'', ''[[Stag (magazine)|Stag]]'' and ''[[Swank (magazine)|Swank]]''. During their peak in the late 1950s, approximately 130 men's adventure magazines were being published simultaneously.

The interior tales usually claimed to be true stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Osgerby|first=Bill|title=Playboys in paradise: masculinity, youth and leisure-style in modern America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kXwlurc3TxEC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2001|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-85973-453-7|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Damsel in distress|Women in distress]] were commonly featured in the painted covers or interior art, often being menaced or [[torture]]d by [[Nazism|Nazis]]&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Abrams|first1=Nathan|last2=Hughes|first2=Julie|title=Containing America: cultural production and consumption in Fifties America|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qhLZsBLjV28C&amp;pg=PA135|year=2000|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-1-902459-06-6|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; or, in later years, [[communism|Communists]]. Typical titles which relied on especially lurid and salacious cover illustrations include ''Man's Story, Men Today, World of Men'', and ''Man's Epic''. 

Many of the stories were actual historical accounts of battles and the biographies and exploits of highly decorated soldiers.  Several of the stories were combined and issued under various titles in paperback editions by [[Pyramid Books]] with the credit "edited by Phil Hirsch".  Phil Hirsch was vice president of Pyramid Books from 1955 to 1975.&lt;ref&gt;http://newsgroups.derkeiler.com/Archive/Rec/rec.arts.books.childrens/2006-08/msg00087.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s, many of the men's adventure magazines dropped the fiction and "true action" stories, and started focusing on pictorials of nude women and non-fiction articles related to sex or current events.

Artist [[Norman Saunders]] was the dean of illustrators for these magazines, occupying a position similar to that enjoyed by [[Margaret Brundage]] for the classic pulps. Charles Copeland&lt;ref&gt;http://lynn-munroe-books.com/list61/copeland.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Earl Norem]] were two other popular artists who worked for the Magazine Management stable of magazines.  Many illustrations that were uncredited were done by [[Bruce Minney]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.menspulpmags.com/2011/05/mens-sweat-magazine-cover-paintings.html&lt;/ref&gt; Norm Eastman, [[Gil Cohen (artist)|Gil Cohen]], Mel Crair, [[Basil Gogos]], and Vic Prezio among others.&lt;ref&gt;Parfrey, Adam, et al.  ''It's a Man's World: Men's Adventure Magazines, the Postwar Pulps'' (Feral House, 2003) {{ISBN|0-922915-81-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Bama]] contributed over 400 cover and interior illustrations for an approximate eight-year period circa 1957–1964 before turning to paperback cover illustration as his mainstay. [[History painting|Historical artist]] [[Mort Künstler]] painted many covers and illustrations for these magazines, and  ''[[Playboy]]'' photographer [[Mario Casilli]] started out shooting pinups for this market. At publisher [[Martin Goodman (publisher)|Martin Goodman]]'s Magazine Management Company, future best-selling humorist and author [[Bruce Jay Friedman]] was a men's sweat writer-editor, and [[Mario Puzo]] was a contributor before he became a well-known novelist.  [[Pierre Boulle]], [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Erskine Caldwell]], [[Ian Fleming]], [[Robert F. Dorr]] and [[Mickey Spillane]] also contributed short stories or novel excerpts to men's adventure magazines.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.philsp.com/homeville/FMI/0start.htm#TOC&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==


Paperback novels became increasingly popular in the 1950s and 1960s, and series' such as [[Don Pendleton]]'s ''[[The Executioner (book series)|The Executioner]]'' mined a similar vein of war story, and continued on long after the magazines themselves shifted away from such fare.&lt;ref&gt;[[Don D'Ammassa]]. 2009. ''The Encyclopedia of Adventure Fiction.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the [[Frank Zappa]] and [[The Mothers of Invention]] album ''[[Weasels Ripped My Flesh]]'' was borrowed from a man-against-beast cover story in the September 1956 issue of ''Man's Life'',&lt;ref name=reason&gt;{{cite news|last=Freund|first=Charles Paul|title=Weasels ripped our flesh: the forgotten world of men's adventure magazines.|url=http://reason.com/archives/2003/11/01/weasels-ripped-our-flesh|accessdate=December 7, 2011|newspaper=Reason|date=November 1, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the title went through another permutation when filmmaker [[Nathan Schiff]] made the horror feature ''Weasels Rip My Flesh'' (1979).

There have been attempts to revive the ''Argosy'' title, once in the 1990s, again in 2004, and finally in 2013.  ''[[Soldier of Fortune magazine|Soldier of Fortune]]'' carried on the tradition of war stories for a male audience.&lt;ref name=tnyt2&gt;{{cite news|last=Peterson|first=Ivar|title=Mercenary Magazine Widens Appeal|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/23/us/mercenary-magazine-widens-appeal.html|accessdate=December 7, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 23, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few contemporary "[[lad mag]]" periodicals such as ''[[FHM]]'' and ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]'' are somewhat similar to the earlier adventure magazines, featuring a combination of [[glamour photography]] and occasional true adventure/horror stories.  Publishers such as [[Hard Case Crime]] put out new and reprint paperback novels in the hard-boiled pulp tradition.  Online book vendor [[Amazon.com]] uses the genre label "men's adventure" in a general sense to categorize adventure novels where the hero is an adult man to distinguish these books from "women's adventure" and "children's action &amp; adventure."

==Overview==
Told from Frannie’s and Luc’s alternating points of view, ''Personal Demons'' begins when Luc Cain, a demon employed in Hell’s Acquisitions Department, walks into Frannie Cavanaugh’s high school (Haden High) on a mission to tag for a specific soul for Hell. He meets up with Frannie and uses his demonic charm to lure Frannie to him.

However, things got unsettled for Luc when Gabriel arrives, prepared to do anything to keep him from getting what he came for. Frannie finds herself torn between the two boys, and it isn’t long before they find themselves fighting for more than just her soul.

As the story unfolds, a variety of demons show up to finish the job that Luc seems unable to bring himself to complete. Frannie won’t bend to Luc, but Gabriel is unable to tag her soul for Heaven and protect her until she forgives herself for her perceived guilt in the death of her twin brother years earlier.

In this classic struggle between good and evil, angel and demon race to tag Frannie’s soul and determine the fate of Heaven and Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Macmillan, [http://us.macmillan.com/personaldemons], ''Personal Demons''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Major themes==
''Personal Demons'' explores issues of faith and forgiveness, as well as first love and finding one’s place in the world.

==Background==
Author Lisa Desrochers said she started writing a few years back for her daughter, who was an avid reader. ''Personal Demons'' started when her demon, Lucifer Cain popped into her head and begun to tell his story. “I’m just the poorly paid help with the laptop,” Desrochers said about the experience. “I took dictation as fast as I could.”&lt;ref&gt;Book Chic, [http://bookchicclub.blogspot.com/2010/09/fresh-new-voice-of-ya-interview-with.html], Fresh Voices of YA Interview with Author Lisa Desrochers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Books Over Boys, [http://booksoverboys.blogspot.com/2011/07/original-sin-week-author-interview-lisa.html], Original Sin Author Interview, July 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

She researched demon and angel hierarchies and shaped her fictional Hell into a bureaucracy, where we meet demons who work in Acquisitions, Security, and Corrections Departments.&lt;ref&gt;The Book Butterfly, [http://thebookbutterfly.com/2010/09/ten-tantalizing-questions-for-lisa.html], Ten Tantalizing Questions for Lisa Desrochers&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characters==
'''Frannie (Mary Francis) Cavanaugh''', the 17-year-old protagonist who, though unaware of it, possesses a skill so powerful that she has the king of Hell shivering with anticipation.

'''Luc Cain''', the demon sent by King Lucifer from Hell’s Acquisitions Department to tag Frannie’s soul. He struggles with his changing feelings toward Frannie, and by the end, discovers she’s changed more than his mind.

'''Gabe''', a Dominion from the Second Sphere, and the Left Hand of the archangel Gabriel, sent to protect Frannie and keep Luc from getting what he came for.

'''Belias and Avaria''', demons sent to tag Frannie for Hell when Luc is slow getting the job done.

'''Beherit''', Head of Acquisitions for Hell, who takes matters into his own hands when no one is able to tag Frannie.

'''Grandpa (Ed Shanahan)''', Frannie’s maternal grandfather, with whom she rebuilds vintage Mustangs. He is her confidant. His wife (Frannie’s grandmother) with whom Frannie was also close, died in an accident.

'''Daniel Cavanaugh''', Frannie’s father. Luc notices something strange about him at first meeting and finds he’s unable to phase into Frannie’s house. We’re unsure what his situation is at the end of ''Personal Demons'', but find out in the sequel, ''Original Sin''.

'''Mary Theresa, Mary Katherine, Mary Grace and Mary Margaret''', Frannie’s sisters, who also may have special skills.

'''Taylor and Riley''', Frannie’s best friends who plays an instrumental roll in book two of the Personal Demons trilogy, ''Original Sin''.

==Reception==
[[Barnes &amp; Noble|Barnes&amp;Noble.com]] said, "While comparing an unassuming debut novel to an international pop culture phenomenon may be unfair, the reality is this: ''Personal Demons'' by Lisa Desrochers is better written than ''Twilight'', has more well developed and realistic characters, and is decidedly more edgy and existentially weighty. Yes, I completely understand the mass appeal of Meyer’s Twilight saga – and while angels and demons may not be as “sexy” as werewolves with abs of steel and brooding vampiric James Dean wannabes, the profoundly deep questions raised in ''Personal Demons'' (about the existence of God, the inanity of organized religion, the healing power of forgiveness, etc.) make it a much more forceful read."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Goat Allen, {{cite web |url=http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Unabashedly-Bookish-The-BN/Heaven-Hell-and-High-School-Lisa-Desrochers-s-Debut-Novel-is/ba-p/709564 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707083927/http://bookclubs.barnesandnoble.com/t5/Unabashedly-Bookish-The-BN/Heaven-Hell-and-High-School-Lisa-Desrochers-s-Debut-Novel-is/ba-p/709564 |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}, B&amp;N.com,&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Booklist]]'' said, “...introducing some wild twists in a tale that stands alone well enough but leaves avenues for sequels.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="82222">'''Postcolonial literature''' is the [[literature]] by people from formerly [[colonization|colonized]] countries. It exists on all [[continent]]s except [[Antarctica]]. [[Postcolonial]] literature often addresses the problems and consequences of the [[decolonization]] of a country, especially questions relating to the political and cultural independence of formerly subjugated people, and themes such as [[racialism (Racial categorization)|racialism]] and colonialism.{{sfn|Hart|Goldie|1993|p=155}} A range of [[literary theory]] has evolved around the subject. It addresses the role of literature in perpetuating and challenging what postcolonial critic [[Edward Said]] refers to as [[cultural imperialism]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29600508|title=Culture and imperialism|last=W.|first=Said, Edward|date=1994|publisher=Vintage Books|isbn=0679750541|edition=  1st Vintage books |location=New York|oclc=29600508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Migrant literature]] and postcolonial literature show some considerable overlap. However, not all migration takes place in a colonial setting, and not all postcolonial literature deals with migration. A question of current debate is the extent to which [[postcolonial theory]] also speaks to migration literature in non-colonial settings.

== Terminology ==
The significance of the prefix "post-" in "postcolonial" is a matter of contention. It is difficult to determine when colonialism begins and ends, and therefore to agree that "postcolonial" designates an era "after" colonialism has ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Literature|last=Gunning|first=Dave|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|year=2013|isbn=978-0748639380|location=|pages=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Colonial history unfolds in overlapping phases: [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese colonization of the Americas|Portuguese]] expansion begins in the 15th century; [[British Empire|British]], [[French colonial empire|French]], [[Dutch Empire|Dutch]] and [[German Empire|German]] colonization unfold from between the 16th and 18th centuries until the [[Decolonization|independence movements]] of Asia, Africa and the Caribbean in the mid-twentieth century. It is also difficult to determine the postcolonial status of [[Settler colonialism|settler colonies]] such as [[History of Australia|Australia]] and [[History of Canada|Canada]], or that of pre-colonial-era colonies such as [[History of Ireland|Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Cambridge History of Postcolonial Literature, Vol 1|last=Quayson|first=Ato, ed|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=6, 7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neocolonialism]] and the effects of [[imperialism]] (i.e. the western attitudes that justify colonial practices), which persist even after the end of [[colonialism]] (i.e. the practice of securing colonies for economic gain), make it difficult to determine whether a colonizer's physical evacuation guarantees post-colonial status.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Literatures in Context|last=Mullaney|first=Julie|publisher=Continuum|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolution of the term ===
Before the term "postcolonial literature" gained currency, "commonwealth literature" was used to refer to writing in English from countries belonging to the [[Commonwealth of Nations|British commonwealth]]. Even though the term included British literature, it was most commonly used for writing in English produced in British colonies. Scholars of commonwealth literature used the term to designate writing in English that dealt with colonialism's legacy. They advocated for its inclusion in literary curricula, hitherto dominated by the British [[Canon (basic principle)|canon]]. However, the succeeding generation of postcolonial critics, many of whom belonged to the [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist]] philosophical tradition, took issue with the Commonwealth label for separating non-British writing from "English" literature produced in England.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Imaginary Homelands: Essays and Criticism 1981-1991|last=Rushdie|first=Salman|publisher=Granta Books|year=1991|isbn=|location=London|pages=63–67}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also suggested that texts in this category had a short-sighted view of imperialism's impact.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/824119565|title=Postcolonial studies : the key concepts|last=1946-|first=Ashcroft, Bill,|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943-, Tiffin, Helen., Ashcroft, Bill, 1946-|isbn=9780415661904|edition=  Third |location=London|oclc=824119565}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other terms used for the writing in English from former British colonies include terms that designate a national corpus of writing such as Australian or Canadian Literature; "English Literature Other than British and American," "New Literatures in English," "International Literature in English;" and "World Literatures." These have, however, been dismissed either as too vague or too inaccurate to represent the vast body of dynamic writing emerging from the colonies both during and after colonial rule. The term "colonial" and "postcolonial" continue to be used for writing emerging during and after colonial rule respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonial and Postcolonial Fiction: An Anthology|last=Ross|first=Robert L., ed.|publisher=Routledge|year=1999|isbn=|location=New York, Oxford|pages=viii}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-colonial? Or postcolonial? ===
The consensus in the field is that "post-colonial" (with a hyphen) signifies a period that comes chronologically "after" colonialism. "Postcolonial," on the other hand, signals the persisting impact of colonization across time periods and geographical regions.&lt;ref name=":03"/&gt; While the hyphen implies that history unfolds in neatly distinguishable stages from pre- to post-colonial, omitting the hyphen creates a comparative framework by which to understand the varieties of local resistance to colonial impact. Arguments in favor of the hyphen suggest that the term "postcolonial" dilutes differences between colonial histories in different parts of the world and that it homogenizes colonial societies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/60323144|title=The post-colonial studies reader|others=Ashcroft, Bill, 1946-, Griffiths, Gareth, 1943-, Tiffin, Helen,|isbn=0415345642|edition=  Second |location=London|oclc=60323144}}&lt;/ref&gt; The body of [[Criticism|critical writing]] that participates in these debates is called [[Postcolonial Theory|Postcolonial theory]].

== Critical approaches ==
[[File:Ernest Renan 1876-84.jpg|150px|thumb|In ''La Réforme intellectuelle et morale'' (1871), the [[Orientalism|Orientalist]] [[Ernest Renan]] advocated imperial stewardship for civilising the non–Western peoples of the world.]] 
Postcolonial fiction writers deal with the traditional colonial [[discourse]], either by modifying or by subverting it, or both.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/130987358|title=The empire writes back : theory and practice in post-colonial literatures|last=1946-|first=Ashcroft, Bill,|date=2002|publisher=Routledge|others=Griffiths, Gareth, 1943-, Tiffin, Helen.|isbn=0203426088|edition=  2nd|location=London|oclc=130987358}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postcolonial literary [[theory]] re-examines colonial and postcolonial literature, especially concentrating upon the social discourse between the colonizer and the colonized that shaped and produced the literature.&lt;ref name=":22"/&gt; In ''[[Orientalism (book)|Orientalism]]'' (1978), [[Edward Said|Edward Saïd]] analyzed the fiction of [[Honoré de Balzac]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], and [[Lautréamont]] (Isidore-Lucien Ducasse), exploring how they shaped and were influenced by the societal fantasy of European [[Racialism (Racial categorization)|racial superiority]]. He pioneered the branch of postcolonial criticism called [[colonial discourse analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonialism/Postcolonialism, 2nd ed.|last=Loomba|first=Ania|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0415350648|location=|pages=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important theorist of colonial discourse is [[Harvard University]] professor [[Homi K Bhabha]], (1949 – ). He has developed a number of the field's neologisms and key concepts, such as [[hybridity]], [[Third Space Theory|third-space]], mimicry, difference, and ambivalence.&lt;ref name="huddart"&gt;Huddart, David. "Homi K. Bhabha", Routledge Critical Thinkers, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Western canonical works like Shakespeare's ''[[The Tempest#Postcolonial|The Tempest]],'' Charlotte Brontë's ''[[Jane Eyre]],'' Jane Austen's ''[[Mansfield Park#Slavery and Mansfield Park|Mansfield Park]],'' Rudyard Kipling's ''[[Kim (novel)|Kim]],'' and Joseph Conrad's ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' have been targets of colonial discourse analysis. The succeeding generation of postcolonial critics focus on texts that "[[The Empire Writes Back|write back]]" to the colonial center.&lt;ref name=":12"/&gt; In general, postcolonial theory analyzes how [[Anti-imperialism|anti-colonial]] ideas, such as anti-conquest, national unity, [[négritude]], [[pan-Africanism]] and [[postcolonial feminism]] were forged in and promulgated through literature.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonialism/Postcolonialism, 2nd edition|last=Loomba|first=Ania|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=978-0415350648|location=|pages=183–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prominent theorists include [[Gayatri Spivak]], [[Frantz Fanon]], [[Bill Ashcroft]], [[Ngũgĩ wa Thiong'o]], [[Chinua Achebe]], [[Leela Gandhi]], [[Gareth Griffiths (academic)|Gareth Griffiths]], [[Abiola Irele]], John McLeod, [[Hamid Dabashi]], [[Helen Tiffin]], [[Khal Torabully]], and [[Robert J.C. Young|Robert Young]].

=== Nationalism ===
The sense of identification with a nation, or [[nationalism]], fueled anti-colonial movements in the aftermath of colonialism. Language and literature were factors in consolidating this sense of [[national identity]] to resist the impact of colonialism. With the advent of the [[printing press]], newspapers and magazines helped people across geographical barriers identify with a shared national community. This idea of the [[nation]] as a homogeneous [[imagined community]] connected across geographical barriers through the medium of language became the model for the modern nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/932385849|title=Imagined communities : reflections on the origin and spread of nationalism|last=1936-2015,|first=Anderson, Benedict R. O'G. (Benedict Richard O'Gorman),|isbn=1784786756|edition=  Revised |location=London|oclc=932385849}}&lt;/ref&gt; Postcolonial literature not only helped consolidate national identity in anti-colonial struggles but also critiqued the European colonial pedigree of nationalism. As depicted in [[Salman Rushdie|Salman Rushdie's]] novels for example, the homogeneous nation was built on European models by the exclusion of marginalized voices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Colonialism/Postcolonialism, 2nd ed|last=Loomba|first=Ania|publisher=Routledge|year=2005|isbn=|location=|pages=156–157}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were made up of religious or ethnic elites who spoke on behalf of the entire nation, silencing minority groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chakrabarty|first=Dipesh|date=Winter 1992|title=Postcoloniality and the Artifice of History: Who Speaks for "Indian" Pasts?|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2928652|journal=Representations|volume=37|pages=1–26|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Negritude, pan-Africanism and pan-nationalism ===
'''[[Négritude]]''' is a literary and ideological philosophy, developed by francophone African intellectuals, writers, and politicians in France during the 1930s. Its initiators included Martinican poet [[Aimé Césaire]], [[Léopold Sédar Senghor]] (a future President of Senegal), and [[Léon Damas]] of French Guiana. Négritude intellectuals disapproved of French colonialism and claimed that the best strategy to oppose it was to encourage a common racial identity for native Africans worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Postcolonial Studies: the key concepts, 3rd ed.|last=Ashcroft et al.|first=|publisher=Routledge|year=2013|isbn=978-0415661911|location=|pages=176, 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pan-Africanism]] was a movement among English-speaking black intellectuals who echoed the principles négritude. [[Frantz Omar Fanon]] (1925 – 1961), a [[Martinique]]-born [[Afro-Caribbean]] [[psychiatrist]], [[philosophy|philosopher]], [[revolutionary]], and writer, was one of the proponents of the movement. His works are influential in the fields of [[post-colonial studies|postcolonial studies]], [[critical theory]], and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bookrags.com/biography/frantz-fanon/|title=Biography of Frantz Fanon|publisher=Encyclopedia of World Biography|accessdate=8 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; As an [[Intellectualism|intellectual]], Fanon was a [[Political radicalism|political radical]] and [[Marxist]] [[Marxist humanism|humanist]] concerned with the [[psychopathology]] of [[colonization]],&lt;ref&gt;Seb Bra, [https://www.academia.edu/9474429/Franz_Fanon_%C3%A0_Dehil%C3%A8s_Attention_Boumedienne_est_un_psychopathe "Frantz Fanon à Dehilès: « Attention Boumedienne est un psychopathe"], Academia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the human, social, and cultural consequences of [[decolonization]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis Gordon, ''Fanon and the Crisis of European Man'' (1995), New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hussein Abdilahi Bulhan, ''Frantz Fanon and the Psychology of Oppression'' (1985), New York: Plenum Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frantz Fanon, [http://www.openanthropology.org/fanonviolence.htm "Concerning Violence"], from ''The Wretched of the Earth''.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Back to Africa movement====
[[Marcus Mosiah Garvey]], Jr. (1887{{spaced ndash}}1940),&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'' [http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9036129/Marcus-Garvey Marcus Garvey profile]. Retrieved 20 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; another proponent of Pan-Africanism, was a Jamaican political leader, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and [[orator]]. He founded the [[Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League]] ([[UNIA-ACL]]).&lt;ref name="BackToAfrica"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unia-acl.org/archive/themyth.htm|title=The "Back to Africa" Myth|author=|date=14 July 2005|work=UNIA-ACL website|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061230195707/http://www.unia-acl.org/archive/themyth.htm|archivedate=30 December 2006|accessdate=2007-04-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also founded the [[Black Star Line]], a shipping and passenger line which promoted the return of the [[African diaspora]] to their ancestral lands. Prior to the 20th century, leaders such as [[Prince Hall]], [[Martin Delany]], [[Edward Wilmot Blyden]], and [[Henry Highland Garnet]] advocated the involvement of the African diaspora in African affairs. However, Garvey was unique in advancing a [[Pan-African philosophy]] to inspire a global [[mass movement]] and [[economic empowerment]] focusing on Africa. The philosophy came to be known as [[Garveyism]].&lt;ref name="BackToAfrica" /&gt; Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of ''African Redemption'', Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the [[Nation of Islam]] to the [[Rastafari movement]] (some sects of which proclaim Garvey as a prophet).

Against advocates of literature that promoted African racial solidarity in accordance with negritude principles, [[Frantz Fanon]] argued for a national literature aimed at achieving national liberation.&lt;ref name=":32"/&gt; [[Paul Gilroy]] argued against reading literature both as an expression of a common black racial identity and as a representation of [[Nationalism|nationalist]] sentiments. Rather, he argued that black cultural forms—including literature—were [[Diaspora|diasporic]] and [[Transnationality|transnational]] formations born out of the common historical and geographical effects of [[Atlantic slave trade|transatlantic slavery.]]&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/28112279|title=The black Atlantic : modernity and double consciousness|last=1956-|first=Gilroy, Paul,|isbn=0674076052|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|oclc=28112279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anti-conquest ===
The “anti-conquest narrative” recasts the indigenous inhabitants of colonized countries as victims rather than foes of the colonisers.&lt;ref name="Revie"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Niagara Companion: Explorers, Artists and Writers at the Falls, from Discovery through the Twentieth Century| first=Linda L.| last=Revie| year=2003| publisher=Wilfrid Laurier University Press| pages=95| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X8J3zgXVq_MC&amp;dq=%22anti+conquest+narrative%22| isbn=0-88920-433-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This depicts the colonised people in a more human light but risks absolving colonisers of responsibility by assuming that native inhabitants were "doomed" to their fate.&lt;ref name="Revie" /&gt;

In her book ''Imperial Eyes,'' [[Mary Louise Pratt]] analyzes the strategies by which European [[Travel literature|travel writing]] portrays Europe as a secure home space against a contrasting representation of colonized outsiders. She proposes a completely different theorization of "anti-conquest" than the ideas discussed here, one that can be traced to Edward Said. Instead of referring to how natives resist colonization or are victims of it, Pratt analyzes texts in which a European narrates his adventures and struggles to survive in the land of the non-European [[Other (philosophy)|Other]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;"Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation" (1992). In chapters 3 and 4, titled, "Narrating the Anti-Conquest" and "Anti-Conquest II: Mystique of Reciprocity".&lt;/ref&gt; This secures the innocence of the imperialist even as he exercises his dominance, a strategy Pratt terms "anti-conquest." The anti-conquest is a function of how the narrator writes him or her self out of being responsible for or an agent, direct or indirect, of colonization and colonialism. This different notion of anti-conquest is used to analyze the ways in which colonialism and colonization are legitimized through stories of survival and adventure that purport to inform or entertain. Pratt created this unique notion in association with concepts of [[The Contact Zone (theoretical concept)|contact zone]] and [[transculturation]], which have been very well received in Latin America social and human science circles.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} The terms refer to the conditions and effects of encounter between the colonizer and the colonized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Postcolonial feminist literature===
[[Postcolonial feminism]] emerged as a response to the [[Eurocentrism|Eurocentric]] focus of [[feminism]].  It accounts for the way that [[racism]] and the long-lasting political, economic, and cultural effects of [[colonialism]] affect non-white, non-Western women in the [[postcolonialism|postcolonial]] world.&lt;ref name=Weedon&gt;{{cite book|last=Weedon|first=Chris|title=Feminist practice &amp; poststructuralist theory|year=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=978-0-631-19825-3|edition=  2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pacific Islands==
[[File:Witi Ihimaera.jpg|150px|thumb|[[Witi Ihimaera]], from [[New Zealand]], the first published [[Māori people|Māori]] novelist.]]
The '''Pacific Islands''' comprise 20,000 to 30,000 [[island]]s in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. Depending on the context, it may refer to countries and islands with common [[Austronesian]] origins, islands once or currently [[colonized]], or [[Oceania]].
 
There is a burgeoning group of young pacific writers who respond and speak to the contemporary [[Pacific Islands|Pasifika]] experience, including writers [[Lani Wendt Young]], [[Courtney Sina Meredith]] and [[Selina Tusitala Marsh]], among others. Reclamation of culture, loss of culture, [[diaspora]], all themes common to postcolonial literature, are present within the collective Pacific writers. Pioneers of the literature include two of the most influential living authors from this region: [[Witi Ihimaera]], [[New Zealand]]'s first published [[Māori people|Māori]] novelist,&lt;ref name="DomPost profile"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Career Diplomat | work=The Dominion Post - Your Weekend magazine | date=12 March 2016 | author=Black, Eleanor | location=Wellington | pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Samoa]]n poet [[Albert Wendt]] (1939 –  ).&lt;ref&gt;http://tvnz.co.nz/national-news/albert-wendt-very-flattered-over-new-zealand-s-top-honour-5454287&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Tay, [http://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=10126837 "Witi Ihimaera – the life of a Maori boy"], ''NZ Herald'', 23 May 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; Wendt lives in New Zealand. Among his works is ''Leaves of the Banyan Tree'' (1979). He is of German heritage through his paternal great-grandfather, which is reflected in some of his poems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trout.auckland.ac.nz/journal/15/15_10.html Interview with Albert Wendt: 1], Brandy Nālani McDougall, 12 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; He describes his family heritage as "totally Samoan", even though he has a German surname. However, he does not explicitly deny his German heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Patke (2006), p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable figure from the region is [[Sia Figiel]] (1967   ), a contemporary [[Samoans|Samoan]] [[novelist]], [[poet]], and [[Painting|painter]], whose debut novel ''Where We Once Belonged'' won the [[Commonwealth Writers' Prize]] ''Best First Book of 1997,'' ''South East Asia and South Pacific Region''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pontas-agency.com/Autors/ENG/Author_Sia_Figiel_6533.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-06-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923192528/http://www.pontas-agency.com/Autors/ENG/Author_Sia_Figiel_6533.asp |archivedate=2011-09-23 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Sia Figiel grew up amidst traditional Samoan singing and poetry, which heavily influenced her writing. Figiel's greatest influence and inspiration in her career is the Samoan novelist and poet, Albert Wendt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://samoanbios.com/sia-figiel/. 'Sia Figiel'] ''Samoan Bios''.

===Australia===
{{Main|Australian literature#Aboriginal writers and themes}}

At the point of the first colonization, [[Indigenous Australians]] had not developed a system of writing, so the first literary accounts of aborigines come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact, both violent and friendly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Genoni|first=Paul|title=Subverting the Empire: Explorers and Exploration in Australian Fiction|year=2004|publisher=Common Ground|location=Altona, VIC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early accounts by Dutch explorers and the English buccaneer [[William Dampier]] wrote of the "natives of [[New Holland (Australia)|New Holland]]" as being "barbarous savages", but by the time of Captain [[James Cook]] and [[First Fleet]] marine [[Watkin Tench]] (the era of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]]), accounts of aborigines were more sympathetic and romantic: "these people may truly be said to be in the pure state of nature, and may appear to some to be the most wretched upon the earth; but in reality they are far happier than ... we Europeans", wrote Cook in his journal on 23 August 1770.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cook|first=James|title=The Journal of HMS Endeavour, 1768–1771|year=1977|publisher=Genesis|location=Surrey, England|isbn=0904351025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While his father, [[James Unaipon]] (c.1835-1907), contributed to accounts of aboriginal mythology written by the missionary George Taplin,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkin|first=Graham|title=Conquest of the Ngarrindjeri|year=1979|publisher=Rigby|location=Adelaide}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Unaipon]] (1872–1967) provided the first accounts of aboriginal mythology written by an aboriginal: "''[[Legendary Tales of the Aborigines]]"''. For this he is known as the first Aboriginal author. [[Oodgeroo Noonuccal]] (1920–1995) (born Kath Walker) was an Australian poet, political activist, artist and educator. She was also a campaigner for [[Australian Aborigine|Aboriginal]] rights.&lt;ref name="awap"&gt;{{cite web|last=Land |first=Clare |title=Oodgeroo Noonuccal (1920–1993) |publisher=Australian Women's Archives Project |date=16 September 2013 |url= http://www.womenaustralia.info/biogs/IMP0082b.htm |accessdate=23 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oodgeroo was best known for her poetry, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse ''[[We Are Going]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;"Oodgeroo Noonuccal." ''Encyclopedia of World Biography Supplement'', Vol. 27. Gale, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sally Morgan (artist)|Sally Morgan]]'s novel ''[[My Place (book)|My Place]]'' (1987) was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading aboriginal activists [[Marcia Langton]] (''[[First Australians]]'', 2008) and [[Noel Pearson]] (''[[Up From the Mission]]'', 2009) are active contemporary contributors to [[Australian literature]].

The voices of [[Australian Aborigines|Indigenous Australians]] are being increasingly noticed and include the [[playwright]] [[Jack Davis (playwright)|Jack Davis]] and [[Kevin Gilbert (author)|Kevin Gilbert]]. Writers coming to prominence in the 21st century include [[Kim Scott]], [[Alexis Wright]], Kate Howarth [[Tara June Winch]], in poetry [[Yvette Holt]] and in popular fiction [[Anita Heiss]].

Indigenous authors who have won Australia's high prestige [[Miles Franklin Award]] include [[Kim Scott]] who was joint winner (with [[Thea Astley]]) in 2000 for ''[[Benang]]'' and again in 2011 for ''[[That Deadman Dance]].'' [[Alexis Wright]] won the award in 2007 for her novel ''[[Carpentaria (novel)|Carpentaria]].''

Many notable works have been written by non-indigenous Australians on aboriginal themes. [[Eleanor Dark]]'s (1901–1985) ''[[The Timeless Land]]'' (1941) is the first of ''The Timeless Land'' trilogy of novels about European settlement and exploration of Australia. The narrative is told from English and [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal]] points of view. The novel begins with two Aboriginal men watching the arrival of the [[First Fleet]] at [[Sydney Harbour]] on 26 January 1788. Other examples include the poems of [[Judith Wright]], ''[[The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith]]'' by [[Thomas Keneally]], ''Ilbarana'' by [[Donald Stuart (novelist)|Donald Stuart]], and the short story by [[David Malouf]]: "The Only Speaker of his Tongue".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://books.wwnorton.com/books/detail-contents.aspx?ID=12252|title=Page Not Found - W.

[[Doris Lessing]] (1919 – 2013) from [[Southern Rhodesia]], now [[Zimbabwe]], published her first novel ''The Grass is Singing'' in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the nobel prize for literature in 2007. [[Yvonne Vera]] (1964 – 2005) was an award-winning author from [[Zimbabwe]]. Her novels are known for their poetic prose, difficult subject-matter, and their strong women characters, and are firmly rooted in Zimbabwe's difficult past.

===Nigeria===
[[Nigerian literature|Nigerian author]] [[Chinua Achebe]] (1930 – 13) gained worldwide attention for ''[[Things Fall Apart]]'' in the late 1950s. Achebe wrote his novels in English and defended the use of English, a "language of colonisers", in African literature. In 1975, his lecture ''[[An Image of Africa|An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad's "Heart of Darkness"]]'' featured a famous criticism of [[Joseph Conrad]] as "a thoroughgoing racist".

His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. He also published a number of short stories, children's books, and essay collections.

Her themes of child slavery, motherhood, female independence and freedom through education have won her considerable critical acclaim and honours, including an [[Order of the British Empire]]

===South Africa===
{{See also|South African poetry}}
[[Elleke Boehmer]] (cf. Cullhed, 2006: 79) writes, “Nationalism, like patriarchy, favours singleness—one identity, one growth pattern, one birth and blood for all ... [and] will promote specifically unitary or ‘one-eyed’ forms of consciousness.” The first problem any student of [[South African literature]] is confronted with, is the diversity of the [[literary systems]]. [[Gerrit Olivier]] notes, "While it is not unusual to hear academics and politicians talk about a 'South African literature', the situation at ground level is characterised by diversity and even fragmentation". [[Robert Mossman]] adds that "One of the enduring and saddest legacies of the apartheid system may be that no one – White, Black, Coloured (meaning of mixed-race in South Africa), or Asian – can ever speak as a "South African."  The problem, however, pre-dates Apartheid significantly, as South Africa is a country made up of communities that have always been linguistically and culturally diverse. These cultures have all retained autonomy to some extent, making a compilation such as the controversial ''Southern African Literatures'' by [[Michael Chapman (South Africa)|Michael Chapman]], difficult. Chapman raises the question:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[W]hose language, culture, or story can be said to have authority in South Africa when the end of apartheid has raised challenging questions as to what it is to be a South African, what it is to live in a new South Africa, whether South Africa is a nation, and, if so, what its mythos is, what requires to be forgotten and what remembered as we scour the past in order to understand the present and seek a path forward into an unknown future.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

South Africa has 11 national languages: [[Afrikaans]], English, [[Zulu language|Zulu]], [[Xhosa language|Xhosa]], [[Sotho language|Sotho]], [[Pedi language|Pedi]], [[Tswana language|Tswana]], [[Venda]], [[SiSwati]], [[Tsonga language|Tsonga]], and [[Southern Ndebele language|Ndebele]]. Any definitive literary history of South Africa should, it could be argued, discuss literature produced in all eleven languages. But the only literature ever to adopt characteristics that can be said to be "national" is Afrikaans. Olivier argues: "Of all the literatures in South Africa, Afrikaans literature has been the only one to have become a national literature in the sense that it developed a clear image of itself as a separate entity, and that by way of institutional entrenchment through teaching, distribution, a review culture, journals, etc. it could ensure the continuation of that concept." Part of the problem is that English literature has been seen within the greater context of English writing in the world, and has, because of English's global position as ''lingua franca'', not been seen as autonomous or indigenous to South Africa – in Olivier’s words: "English literature in South Africa continues to be a sort of extension of British or international English literature." The African languages, on the other hand, are spoken across the borders of Southern Africa - for example, Tswana is spoken in Botswana, and Tsonga in Zimbabwe, and Sotho in Lesotho. South Africa's borders were drawn up by the [[British Empire]] and, as with all other colonies, these borders were drawn without regard for the people living within them. Therefore: in a history of South African literature, do we include all Tswana writers, or only the ones with South African citizenship? Chapman bypasses this problem by including "Southern" African literatures. The second problem with the African languages is accessibility, because since the African languages are regional languages, none of them can claim the readership on a national scale comparable to Afrikaans and English. Sotho, for instance, while transgressing the national borders of the RSA, is on the other hand mainly spoken in the [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]], and bears a great amount of relation to the language of [[Natal (region)|Natal]] for example, Zulu. So the language cannot claim a national readership, while on the other hand being "international" in the sense that it transgresses the national borders.

Olivier argues that "There is no obvious reason why it should be unhealthy or abnormal for different literatures to co-exist in one country, each possessing its own infrastructure and allowing theoreticians to develop impressive theories about polysystems". Yet political idealism proposing a unified "South Africa" (a remnant of the colonial British approach) has seeped into literary discourse and demands a unified national literature, which does not exist and has to be fabricated. It is unrealistic to ever think of South Africa and South African literature as homogenous, now or in the near or distant future, since the only reason it is a country at all is the interference of European colonial powers. This is not a racial issue, but rather has to do with culture, heritage and tradition (and indeed the constitution celebrates diversity). Rather, it seems more sensible to discuss South African literature as literature produced within the national borders by the different cultures and language groups inhabiting these borders. Otherwise the danger is emphasising one literary system at the expense of another, and more often than not, the beneficiary is English, with the African languages being ignored. The distinction "black" and "white" literature is further a remnant of colonialism that should be replaced by drawing distinctions between literary systems based on language affiliation rather than race.

The first texts produced by black authors were often inspired by missionaries and frequently deal with African history, in particular the history of kings such as [[Shaka|Chaka]]. Modern South African writing in the African languages tends to play at writing realistically, at providing a mirror to society, and depicts the conflicts between rural and urban settings, between traditional and modern norms, racial conflicts and most recently, the problem of AIDS.

In the first half of the 20th century, epics largely dominated black writing: historical novels, such as [[Sol T. Plaatje]]’s ''[[Mhudi]]: An Epic of South African Native Life a Hundred Years Ago'' (1930), [[Thomas Mofolo]]’s ''[[Chaka (novel)|Chaka]]'' (trans. 1925), and epic plays including those of [[H. I. E. Dhlomo]], or heroic epic poetry such as the work of [[Mazizi Kunene]]. These texts “evince black African patriarchy in its traditional form, with men in authority, often as warriors or kings, and women as background figures of dependency, and/or mothers of the nation” (Cullhed, 2006: 21). Female literature in the African languages is severely limited because of the strong influence of patriarchy, but over the last decade or two society has changed much and it can be expected that more female voices will emerge.

The following are notable white South African writers in English: [[Athol Fugard]], [[Nadine Gordimer]], [[J. M. Coetzee]], and [[Wilbur Smith]]. [[André Brink]] has written in both Afrikaans and English while [[Breyten Breytenbach]] writes primarily in [[Afrikaans]], though many of their works have been translated into English. [[Dalene Matthee]]'s (1938 – 2005) is another Afrikaner, best known for her four ''Forest Novels'', written in and around the [[Knysna Forest]], including ''[[Fiela se Kind]]'' (1985) (''Fiela's Child'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dalenematthee.co.za/english/biography/index.html|title=Dalene Matthee|website=www.dalenematthee.co.za}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her books have been translated into fourteen languages, including English, [[French (language)|French]], and [[German (language)|German]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mieliestronk.com/skryfdmatthee.html|title=Skrywer Dalene Matthee|website=www.mieliestronk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and over a million copies have been sold worldwide.

====West Indies====
An exemplar post-colonial novel is ''[[Wide Sargasso Sea]]'' (1966) by [[Jean Rhys]] (1890 –  1979),  a mid-twentieth century novelist who was born and grew up in the Caribbean island of [[Dominica]], though she was mainly resident in England from the age of 16. This novel is based on ''[[Jane Eyre]]'' (1847), by [[Charlotte Brontë]],  re-told from the perspective of a [[subaltern (postcolonialism)|subaltern]] protagonist, Antoinette Cosway. It is the story of [[Bertha Mason|Antoinette Cosway]], a white [[Creole peoples|Creole]] heiress, from the time of her youth in [[Jamaica]], to her unhappy marriage to a certain English gentleman—he is never named by the author. He renames her to a prosaic Bertha, declares her mad, and requires her to relocate to England. Caught in an oppressive [[patriarchal]] society in which she fully belongs neither to the white Europeans nor the black [[Jamaica]]ns, Cosway is Rhys' version of Brontë's devilish "madwoman in the attic." As with many postcolonial works, the novel deals with the themes of racial inequality and the harshness of displacement and [[cultural assimilation|assimilation]]. It is also concerned with power relations between men and women.&lt;ref&gt;Suneeta Peres da Costa ''Wide Sargasso Sea'', Fifty Years on". ''[[Sydney Review of Books]]'',  9 March 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "[[West Indies]]" first began to achieve wide currency in the 1950s, when writers such as [[Samuel Selvon]], [[John Edgar Colwell Hearne|John Hearne]], [[Edgar Mittelholzer]], [[V.S. Naipaul]], and [[George Lamming]] began to be published in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Kenneth Ramchand|Ramchand, Kenneth]]. ''The West Indian Novel and Its Background.'' London: Faber, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; A sense of a single literature developing across the islands was also encouraged in the 1940s by the [[BBC]] radio programme ''[[Caribbean Voices]]'', which featured stories and poems written by West Indian authors, recorded in London under the direction of producer [[Henry Swanzy]], and broadcast back to the islands.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith, Glyne. "Deconstructing Nationalisms: Henry Swanzy, Caribbean Voices and the Development of West Indian Literature", Small Axe, Number 10 (Volume 5, Number 2), September 2001, pp. 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Magazines such as ''[[Kyk-Over-Al (magazine)|Kyk-Over-Al]]'' in Guyana, ''[[Bim (magazine)|Bim]]'' in Barbados, and ''[[Focus (Jamaican magazine)|Focus]]'' in Jamaica, which published work by writers from across the region, also encouraged links and helped build an audience.&lt;ref&gt;Dalleo, Raphael.

Many—perhaps most—West Indian writers have found it necessary to leave their home territories and base themselves in the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]], or [[Canada]] in order to make a living from their work—in some cases spending the greater parts of their careers away from the territories of their birth. Critics in their adopted territories might argue that, for instance, [[V. S. Naipaul]] ought to be considered a British writer instead of a Trinidadian writer, or [[Jamaica Kincaid]] and [[Paule Marshall]] American writers, but most West Indian readers and critics still consider these writers "West Indian".

West Indian literature ranges over subjects and themes as wide as those of any other "national" literature, but in general many West Indian writers share a special concern with questions of identity, ethnicity, and language that rise out of the Caribbean historical experience.

One unique and pervasive characteristic of Caribbean literature is the use of "[[dialect]]" forms of the national language, often termed [[Creole language|creole]]. The various local variations in the language adopted from the [[colonial powers]] such as [[United Kingdom|Britain]], [[Spain]], [[Portugal]], [[France]] and the [[Netherlands]], have been modified over the years within each country and each has developed a blend that is unique to their country. Many Caribbean authors in their writing switch liberally between the local variation - now commonly termed [[nation language]] - and the standard form of the language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Waters|first=Erika J.|authorlink=Erika J.

[[Earl Lovelace]] (1935 –  ) is an award-winning [[Trinidad and Tobago|Trinidadian]] [[novelist]], [[journalist]], [[playwright]], and [[short story writer]].

Most writers leave to find support for their literary endeavours elsewhere and this, arguably, shapes the literature, especially after long periods of exile. But Lovelace's fiction is deeply embedded in Trinidadian society and is written from the perspective of one whose ties to his homeland have never been broken."&lt;ref&gt;Bernardine Evaristo, [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2011/jan/29/is-just-movie-earl-lovelace-review "Is Just a Movie by Earl Lovelace – review.

I’m the first among Asian immigrants to be making this distinction between immigrant writing and expatriate writing. Most Indian writers prior to this, have still thought of themselves as Indians, and their literary inspiration, has come from India. India has been the source, and home.

====African-American literature====
Throughout American history, [[African American]]s have been discriminated against and subject to racist attitudes.  This experience inspired some Black writers, at least during the early years of [[African-American literature]], to prove they were the equals of European-American authors.  As Henry Louis Gates, Jr, has said, "it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"&gt;"The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

By refuting the claims of the dominant culture, African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States.  Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as "something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity."&lt;ref name = "Stryz_p140"/&gt;  This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination.  By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the [[African diaspora]], African-American literature broke "the mystique of connection between literary authority and [[patriarchal]] power."&lt;ref&gt;Quote from Marjorie Pryse in "The Other Ghost in Beloved: The Specter of the Scarlet Letter" by Jan Stryz, from ''The New Romanticism: a collection of critical essays'' by Eberhard Alsen, p. 140, {{ISBN|0-8153-3547-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. This view of African-American literature as a tool in the struggle for Black political and cultural liberation has been stated for decades, perhaps most famously by [[W. E. B. Du Bois]].&lt;ref name = "jhu_theory"&gt;Mason, [http://www.press.jhu.edu/books/hopkins_guide_to_literary_theory/free/african-american_theory_and_criticism-_1.html "African-American Theory and Criticism"] (accessed July 6, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

A. Robert Lee and Alan Velie note that the book's title "quickly gained currency as a term to describe the efflorescence on literary works that followed the publication of [[N. Scott Momaday]]'s ''[[House Made of Dawn]]'' in 1968".&lt;ref&gt;Lee and Velie, "Introduction", in ''Native American Renaissance: Literary Imagination and Achievement'', p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Momaday's novel garnered critical acclaim, including the [[Pulitzer Prize for Fiction]] in 1969.

Major figures are [[Naguib Mahfouz]] the Egyptian novelist, and [[Edward Said]] an eminent Palestinian scholar who has written especially on the topic of [[Orientalism]].
According to Said's work "the Orient" is a term constructed as the inferior shadow to the civilized and powerful West, the Occident. Its supposed inferiority is explained in racial terms. The [[Egyptian Revolution of 1919]], against British rule in Egypt and the Sudan, had a strong effect on Mahfouz, although he was at the time only seven years old. From the window he often saw British soldiers firing at the demonstrators, men and women. "You could say [...] that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution", he later said.&lt;ref name="paris"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.theparisreview.org/interviews/2062/the-art-of-fiction-no-129-naguib-mahfouz|work=The Paris Review|title=Naguib Mahfouz, The Art of Fiction No. 129|date=Summer 1992|author=Charlotte El Shabrawy|accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==South and Southeast Asia==
===Philippines===
[[Philippine literature]] includes the legends of prehistory, and the colonial legacy of the Philippines. Pre-Hispanic Philippine literature were actually epics passed on from generation to generation originally through oral tradition. However, wealthy families, especially in Mindanao were able to keep transcribed copies of these epics as family heirloom. One such epic was the '''''Darangen''''', epic of the [[Maranao people|Maranaos]] of Lake Lanao. Most of the epics were known during the Spanish era.

Most of the notable literature of the Philippines was written during the Spanish period and the first half of the 20th century in the Spanish language. Philippine literature is written in [[Philippine literature in Spanish|Spanish]], [[Philippine literature in English|English]], or any indigenous [[Philippine languages]].
Notable authors include [[F. Sionil José]], [[Jose Dalisay, Jr.]], [[N. V. M. Gonzalez]] and [[Nick Joaquin]].

====Dutch East Indies====
[[Dutch Indies literature]] includes Dutch language postcolonial literature reflecting on the era of the [[Dutch East Indies]] (now: [[Indonesia]]). Much of the postcolonial literature of this genre is written by Dutch Eurasians known as [[Indo people|Indos]]. Important authors that have been translated to English include, [[Tjalie Robinson]], [[Maria Dermout]], and [[Marion Bloem]].

===Singapore===
[[Bonny Hicks]] (1968 – 1997) was a [[Singapore]] [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasian]] model and writer. After garnering fame as a model, she gained recognition for her contributions to Singaporean post-colonial literature and for the [[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]] philosophy conveyed in her works. Her first book, ''Excuse Me, Are You A Model?'', is recognised as a significant milestone in the [[Literature of Singapore|literary]] and [[Culture of Singapore|cultural history of Singapore]].&lt;ref name="journal"&gt;{{cite journal| author=Ismail S. Talib| title=Singapore| journal=Journal of Commonwealth Literature| date=September 2000| volume=3| issue=35| page=105|url=http://jcl.sagepub.com/cgi/reprint/35/3/95.pdf|format=PDF|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
One of the key issues is the superiority/inferiority of [[Indian Writing in English]] as opposed to the literary production in the various languages of India. Key polar concepts bandied in this context are superficial/authentic, imitative/creative, shallow/deep, critical/uncritical, elitist/parochial and so on.

The views of [[Salman Rushdie]] and [[Amit Chaudhuri]] expressed through their books ''The Vintage Book of Indian Writing'' and ''The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature'' respectively essentialise this battle. Rushdie's statement in his book&amp;nbsp;– "the ironic proposition that India's best writing since independence may have been done in the language of the departed imperialists is simply too much for some folks to bear"&amp;nbsp;– created a lot of resentment among many writers, including writers in English. In his book, Amit Chaudhuri questions&amp;nbsp;– "Can it be true that Indian writing, that endlessly rich, complex and problematic entity, is to be represented by a handful of writers who write in English, who live in England or America and whom one might have met at a party?"

Chaudhuri feels that after Rushdie, [[Indian writing in English]] started employing magical realism, bagginess, non-linear narrative and hybrid language to sustain themes seen as microcosms of India and supposedly reflecting Indian conditions. He contrasts this with the works of earlier writers such as [[R. K. Narayan]] where the use of English is pure, but the deciphering of meaning needs cultural familiarity. He also feels that Indian is a theme constructed only in IWE and does not articulate itself in the vernacular literature. He further adds "the post-colonial novel, becomes a trope for an ideal hybrid by which the West celebrates not so much Indian, whatever that infinitely complex thing is, but its own historical quest, its reinterpretation of itself".

Some of these arguments form an integral part of what is called [[postcolonial theory]]. The very categorisation of IWE&amp;nbsp;– as IWE or under post-colonial literature&amp;nbsp;– is seen by some as limiting. [[Amitav Ghosh]] made his views on this very clear by refusing to accept the Eurasian [[Commonwealth Writers Prize]] for his book ''[[The Glass Palace]]'' in 2001 and withdrawing it from the subsequent stage.

The renowned writer V. S. Naipaul, a third generation Indian from [[Trinidad and Tobago]] and a [[Nobel prize]] laureate, is a person who belongs to the world and usually not classified under IWE. Naipaul evokes ideas of homeland, rootlessness and his own personal feelings towards India in many of his books.

Indian authors like [[Amitav Ghosh]], [[Anita Desai]], [[Hanif Kureishi]], [[Rohinton Mistry]], [[Meena Alexander]], [[Arundhati Roy]] and [[Kiran Desai]] have written about their postcolonial experiences.{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}

The most significant novels of the current generation of [[Urdu literature|Indian novelists in Urdu]] are ''[[Makaan]]'' by [[Paigham Afaqui]] (1956 – ), ''Do Gaz Zameen'' by Abdus Samad, and ''Pani'' by Ghazanfer. These works, especially ''Makaan'', has moved the Urdu novel beyond the prevalent themes relating to [[Pakistan Movement|Pakistan's gaining of independence]] in 1947, and identity issues, and take it into modern-day realities and issues of life in India. ''Makaan'' influenced many English writers including [[Vikram Seth]]. Paigham Afaqui's second major novel, ''[[Paleeta]]'', was published in 2011 and depicts the political cynicism of a common Indian citizen in the six decades after India's independence.

The [[Hungry Generation]] was a [[Bengali literature|literary movement in the Bengali language]] launched by what is known today as the "Hungryalist quartet", ''i.e.'' [[Shakti Chattopadhyay]], [[Malay Roy Choudhury]], [[Samir Roychoudhury]] and [[Debi Roy]] (''alias'' Haradhon Dhara), during the 1960s in [[Kolkata]], India. Due to their involvement in this [[avant garde]] cultural movement, the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government. They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting.&lt;ref&gt;Dr Uttam Das, Reader, Calcutta University, in his dissertation 'Hungry Shruti and Shastravirodhi Andolan'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Britain===
The novels of [[J. G. Farrell]] are important texts dealing with the collapse of the [[British Empire]]. ''[[Troubles (novel)|Troubles]]'', is set during the [[Irish War of Independence]] (1919–1921), and is the first instalment in Farrell's "Empire Trilogy", preceding ''[[The Siege of Krishnapur]]'' and ''[[The Singapore Grip]]'', all written during the 1970s. Although there are similar themes within the three novels (most notably that of the British Empire), they do not form a sequence of storytelling. ''The Siege of Krishnapurn'' was inspired by events such as the sieges of [[Siege of Cawnpore]] ([[Kanpur]]) and [[Siege of Lucknow|Lucknow]], and details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] from the perspective of the British residents. ''The Singapore Grip'' is [[Satire|satirical]] book about events following Japan's entry into the [[World War II|Second World War]] and occupation of [[Singapore]]. The story centres on a British family who control one of the colony's leading trading companies.

Novelist [[E. M. Forster]]'s ''[[A Passage to India]]'' (1924) takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the [[British Raj]]. Forster connects personal relationships with the politics of colonialism through the story of the Englishwoman Adela Quested, the Indian Dr. Aziz, and the question of what did or did not happen between them in the [[Marabar Caves]].

[[The Raj Quartet]]  a four-volume [[novel sequence]], written by [[Paul Scott (novelist)|Paul Scott]], also deals with the subject of the British in India, in this case the concluding years of the [[British Raj]] in India. The series was written during the period 1965&amp;ndash;75. ''[[The Times]]'' called it "one of the most important landmarks of post-war fiction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.randomhouse.co.uk/catalog/book.htm?command=Search&amp;db=main.txt&amp;eqisbndata=0099439964|title=Penguin Books|website=www.randomhouse.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The story of ''The Raj Quartet'' begins in 1942. [[World War II]] is at its zenith, and in [[South East Asia]], the Allied forces have suffered great losses. [[Burma]] has fallen, and the Japanese invasion of the [[Indian subcontinent]] from the east appears imminent.  The year 1942 is also marked by Indian nationalist leader [[Mahatma Gandhi]]’s call for the [[Quit India|Quit India movement]] to the British rulers of India. ''The Raj Quartet'' is set in this tumultuous background for the British soldiers and civilians stationed in India who have a duty to manage this part of the [[British Empire]]. One recurrent theme is the moral certainty of the older generation as contrasted with the [[anomie]] of the younger.&lt;ref&gt;For instance, in ''Day of the Scorpion'', Sarah Layton envies the "self-assurance" of her older aunt. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=S3K2JoacH24C&amp;pg=PT423&amp;dq=%22virtues+of+self-assurance+and+moral+certainty%3B+what%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''Day of the Scorpion'', Book Two Part Two ch. IV]&lt;/ref&gt; Another is the [[racism]] to which this leads.&lt;ref&gt;For example, in ''Day of the Scorpion'', Hari Kumar describes how the British were shocked and embarrassed at the sight of an Englishwoman treating an Indian as a human being rather than as an inferior being. See [https://books.google.com/books?id=rcDyGQ-2EngC&amp;pg=PT183&amp;lpg=PT183&amp;dq=%22Chatterjee+was+incapable+of+accepting+immediately%22&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html ''Day of the Scorpion'' Book Two Part One Ch. I]&lt;/ref&gt; To justify the racism and combat this danger of anomie and disintegration, the British characters let themselves be "trapped by codes and principles, which were in part to keep their own fears and doubts at bay."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spectator.co.uk/print/books/397731/when-the-sun-finally-set.thtml review of ''Raj Quartet''] in [[The Spectator]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wales===
The whole of [[Wales]] was annexed by England and incorporated within the [[English law|English legal system]] under the [[Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542]]. Distinctive [[Welsh politics]] developed in the 19th century, and Welsh national feeling grew during the 20th century. The Welsh nationalist party, ''[[Plaid Cymru]]'', was formed in 1925 and the [[Welsh Language Society]] in 1962.

[[Saunders Lewis]] (1893 – 1985), the noted [[Welsh-language literature|Welsh language poet, novelist, dramatist]], and nationalist, rejected the possibility of [[Anglo-Welsh]] literature, because of its use of [[English language|English]], the language of the [[United Kingdom|British]] colonialists, affirming that '"the literature which people called Anglo-Welsh was indistinguishable from English literature".&lt;ref&gt;Michael J. Collins, "Keeping the Flag Flying: Anglo-Welsh Poetry in the Twentieth Century". ''World Literature Today'', Vol. 56, no. 1 (Winter 1982); Saunders Lewis, "Is There an Anglo-Welsh Literature", Cardiff: University of Wales Press, 1939.&lt;/ref&gt; Saunders Lewis was himself born in [[Wallasey]] in England to a Welsh-speaking family.

The attitude of the post-war generation of [[Welsh literature in English|Welsh writers in English]] towards [[Wales]] differs from the previous generation, in that they were more sympathetic to [[Welsh nationalism]] and to the [[Welsh language]]. The change can be linked to the nationalist fervour generated by [[Saunders Lewis]] and the burning of the Bombing School on the [[Lleyn Peninsula]] in 1936, along with a sense of crisis generated by World War II.&lt;ref&gt;''The Pocket Guide'', p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt; In poetry [[R. S. Thomas]] (1913–2000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the 20th century, beginning with ''The Stones of the Field'' in 1946 and concluding with ''No Truce with the Furies'' (1995). While he "did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English",&lt;ref name=LATimesObit&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', "Obituary", September 27, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; he wanted the Welsh language to be made the first language of Wales, and the official policy of bilingualism abolished. He wrote his autobiography in Welsh, but said he lacked the necessary grasp of the language to employ it in his poems. Although an Anglican priest, he was a fervent nationalist and advocated non-violent action against English owners of holiday homes in Wales.&lt;ref name=LATimesObit /&gt; As an admirer of Saunders Lewis, Thomas defended his need to use English: "Since there is in Wales a mother tongue that continues to flourish, a proper Welshman can only look on English as a means of rekindling interest in the Welsh language, and of leading people back to the mother tongue."&lt;ref&gt;R. S. Thomas, ''Selected Prose'', ed. Sandra Anstey. Brigend: Poetry Wales Press, 1986, p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the creation the [[National Assembly for Wales]], under the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]], Wales now has more local autonomy from the central government in England. The [[Welsh Language Act 1993]] and the [[Government of Wales Act 1998]] provide that the English and Welsh languages be treated on a basis of equality. English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the ''de facto'' main language. Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh.&lt;ref name="2011 Census Language"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/publications/re-reference-tables.html?edition=tcm%3A77-286268 |title=2011 Census, Key Statistics for Unitary Authorities in Wales |publisher=Office for National Statistics |date=11 December 2012|accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/English/publications/Publications/332.doc |title=Census 2001: Main statistics about Welsh |publisher=[[Welsh Language Board]] |accessdate=30 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110524063247/http://www.byig-wlb.org.uk/english/publications/publications/332.doc |archivedate=24 May 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
[[File:Birth of the Irish Republic.jpg|thumb|"Birth of the Irish Republic" by Walter Paget, depicting the [[Dublin]] [[General Post Office|GPO]] being shelled during the [[Easter Uprising]] of 1916.]]
The English language was introduced to [[Ireland]] in the 13th century, following the [[Norman Conquest of Ireland]]. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century [[Tudor conquest of Ireland|Tudor conquest]], which led to [[Plantation of Ireland|colonisation by settlers from Britain]]. In the 1690s, a system of [[Protestant Ascendancy|Protestant English rule]] was designed to materially disadvantage the [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] majority and Protestant [[dissenters]], and was extended during the 18th century. The [[Irish language]], however, remained the dominant language of [[Irish literature]] down to the 19th century, despite a slow decline which began in the 17th century with the expansion of English power.

The 17th century saw the tightening of English control over Ireland and the suppression of the traditional aristocracy. This meant that the literary class lost its patrons, since the new nobility were English speakers with little sympathy for the older culture. The elaborate classical metres lost their dominance and were largely replaced by more popular forms.&lt;ref&gt;TLG 201–223.&lt;/ref&gt; This was an age of social and political tension, as expressed by the poet [[Dáibhí Ó Bruadair]] and the anonymous authors of ''Pairliment Chloinne Tomáis'', a prose satire on the aspirations of the lower classes.&lt;ref&gt;See the introduction to Williams (1981). The text is bilingual.&lt;/ref&gt; Prose of another sort was represented by the historical works of [[Geoffrey Keating]] (Seathrún Céitinn) and the compilation known as the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]]''.

The consequences of these changes were seen in the 18th century. Poetry was still the dominant literary medium and its practitioners were poor scholars, often educated in the classics at local schools and schoolmasters by trade. Such writers produced polished work in popular metres for a local audience. This was particularly the case in Munster, in the south-west of Ireland, and notable names included [[Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin]] and [[Aogán Ó Rathaille]] of [[Sliabh Luachra]]. A certain number of local patrons were still to be found, even in the early 19th century, and especially among the few surviving families of the Gaelic aristocracy.&lt;ref&gt;Caerwyn Williams and Ní Mhuiríosa (1979), pp. 252–268, 282–290. See Corkery (1925) for a detailed discussion of the social context.&lt;/ref&gt; In the first half of the 18th century Dublin was the home of an Irish-language literary circle connected to the Ó Neachtain (Naughton) family, a group with wide-ranging Continental connections.&lt;ref&gt;Caerwyn Williams and Ní Mhuiríosa (1979), pp. 279–282.&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Acts of Union 1800|Acts of Union]] in 1801, Ireland became [[Countries of the United Kingdom|a part of]] the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]]. The latter part of the 19th century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English in the greater part of the country, though Irish was still an urban language, and continued to be so well into the 19th century. At the end of the 19th century, however, cultural nationalism displayed a new energy, marked by the [[Gaelic Revival]] (which encouraged a modern literature in Irish) and more generally by the [[Irish Literary Revival]].

A [[Irish War of Independence|war of independence]] in the early 20th century was followed by the [[Partition of Ireland|partition of the island]], creating the [[Irish Free State]] in 1922, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and [[Northern Ireland]], which remained a part of the [[United Kingdom]].

'''Koninklijke Academie voor Nederlandse Taal- en Letterkunde''', otherwise known as the '''KANTL''', is an Academy established to study and promote the [[Dutch language]] in [[Flanders]].

==History==

The Royal Academy of Dutch language and literature (abbreviated to KANTL) is a government organization which was established in 1886 by Royal Decree as '''''Koninklijke Vlaamse Academie voor Taal- en Letterkunde''''' (Royal Flemish Academy for language and literature).&lt;ref&gt;Royal Decree from 8 July 1886&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972 the name of The Royal Flemish Academy for language and literature was changed to The Royal Academy of Dutch language and literature,&lt;ref&gt;Royal Decree from 20 April 1972&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1981 the existence of the Academy was confirmed by a decree of the Council for Cultural Affairs for the Dutch cultural community (the predecessor of the Flemish Parliament) (decree of 13 February 1980). The KANTL is now an institution of the Flemish Government.

The Academy was the first official institution of Belgium where the Dutch language was examined scientifically and to encourage coordination between scientific academic fields using the Dutch language. This ended in 1938 when the [[Royal Flemish Academy of Belgium for Science and the Arts]] and the [[Royal Academy of Medicine of Belgium]] were set up.  From this point on the Academy’s power was limited to the Dutch language and its literature. To do this, it is still has an advisory function for the Flemish government. The Flemish Academy played an important role in Flemish emancipation and sent the Flemish Movement in a cultural and intellectual to a higher level. In political terms, however, the Academy is always neutral.

Since 1939 The Academy consists of 30 members and 25 foreign honorary Members.

The Royal Academy of Dutch language and literature is housed in the House of Oombergen in the Koningsstraat in Ghent. The building was restored in 2012.

==Royal Academy of Dutch language and literature Prize==

Since its early days, the Royal Academy has issued an annual prize for what the Academy considered outstanding research and work in the Dutch language. However, since 2005 this has changed to a more general calling for those working in the field of Dutch language and literature. Thus a prize is offered for an essay, for a study on the old Dutch language, for literature, for poetry, for prose and for culture.

'''Sheep shagger''', also spelt '''sheepshagger''' or '''sheep-shagger''', is a derogatory term, most often used to refer to [[Welsh people]] implying that the subject has sex with sheep.&lt;ref name=dict&gt;{{cite book | first =Eric | last =Partridge  | author-link=Eric Partridge | title = The New Partridge Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English: J-Z| publisher =Burlington Publishing | location =[[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 2006| isbn = 041525938X | page = 1712}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Law of the United Kingdom|court case in Britain]], the use of the term directed at a Welsh person was ruled to be a "racially aggravating" factor in a [[disorderly conduct]] offence.&lt;ref name=taaffe&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/10023732/Man-fined-for-racism-after-Welsh-sheep-slur.html |title=Man fined for racism after Welsh sheep slur |date=28 April 2013 |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |accessdate=21 April 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The use of the term "sheep shagger" to refer to a Welsh person has arisen from the prevalence of sheep and [[sheep farming]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name=dict /&gt; It is often viewed as offensive in Wales,{{cn|date=April 2016}} for the same reason&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxsports.com.au/cricket/australia/cricket-world-cup-2015-australias-triumph-inspires-respect-but-no-love-after-our-boys-antics/news-story/a76fc82083832f7a6b2795175f8a56c1?nk=26704e0a7e4630285265caeaaf5dcb94-1459849248 |title=Australia's triumph inspires respect but no love after our boys antics |publisher=[[Fox Sports (Australia)|Fox Sports]] |date= |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/world/times-running-out-for-those-sheep-jokes/2009/03/04/1235842475470.html |title=Time's running out for 'those' sheep jokes |work=[[Brisbane Times]] |date=4 March 2009 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it is in [[South Africa]] to refer to Australians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sZTLigR2t5UC&amp;pg=PA285 |title=The Art of the South African Insult |author=Sarah Britten|website=Books.google.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response to complaints over the use of phrase, in a television advertisement for [[Toyota]], the New Zealand [[Advertising_Standards_Authority_(New_Zealand)|Advertising Standards Authority]] determined the phrase was not viewed as offensive to the majority of New Zealanders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-10010946.html |title=Lions Diary |work=The Sunday Herald {{Subscription required|via=HighBeam}} |quote= 'Their judgment was another setback for Donald.

===Football===
At [[Association football|football]] matches in England, supporters of Welsh teams as well as Welsh players are often called sheep shaggers in [[football chant]]s from opposing fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/2014/05/i-love-everything-about-supporting-qpr-except-watching-them-play/|title=I Love Everything About Supporting QPR Except Watching Them Play|author=Toby Young|website=Spectator.co.uk|accessdate=10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-229475045.html|title=Aussies Fall Short on Race|date=20 June 2010|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;Ref name=reg /&gt; It is also used in Scotland to refer to supporters of [[Aberdeen F.C.|Aberdeen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|url=https://ojs.st-andrews.ac.uk/index.php/SAEE/article/download/556/495 |title=Aberdeen football fans: The 'glory hunter', the 'true fan' and the motivational role of the'12th man' |publisher=[[St. Andrew's University]] |date= |accessdate=5 April 2016 |type=pdf}}{{what|date=February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, [[Cardiff City F.C.|Cardiff City]] signed English player [[Spencer Prior]] and jokingly included a [[Association football contracts|contract clause]] that he would be obliged "to have a physical liaison with a sheep", in response to their fans being called sheep shaggers.&lt;ref name=reg&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/29/cardiff_city_ace_in_sheep/ |title=Cardiff City ace in "sheep shagging" contract |work=[[The Register]] |date=29 June 2001 |accessdate=5 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Sheep Shaggers" has been used for at least two football [[fanzines]] – those for [[Bedford Town F.C.|Bedford Town]] and for football in [[West Country|Western England]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=z9eJAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 |title=Post-Fandom and the Millennial Blues: The Transformation of Soccer Culture |author=Steve Redhead |publisher=Books.google.co.uk |date=2002 |accessdate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Court case ==
In [[Prestatyn]], Wales, the phrase was the subject of a 2013 [[Magistrates' court (England and Wales)|court case]], after Anthony Taaffe of [[Bolton]], Greater Manchester, England, a guest at a holiday park in [[Gronant]], called an off-duty policeman and security staff "a bunch of sheep shaggers". Taaffe claimed, in his defence, that the phrase was "a term for people living in the countryside". He also admitted a second similar offence, in which he called a police officer, at the custody unit to which he had been taken, a "Welsh sheep shagger".  Taaffe was fined £150 after he admitted racially aggravated [[Public Order Act 1986|disorderly behaviour]].&lt;ref name=taaffe/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David |last=Mitchell |authorlink=David Mitchell (comedian) |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/may/05/david-mitchell-racism-insults-wales |title='Welsh sheep-shagger'?

The '''Student Initiative Rahel''' (SIR) (German: ''Rahel-Bildungsprojekt'') is a project of the ''Institute for World Church and Mission'' (IWM) (German: ''Institut für Weltkirche und Mission'') which is a part of the [[Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology]] in [[Sachsenhausen (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Sachsenhausen]]. The [[nonprofit organization]] supports in a [[scholarship]] youths - mostly young [[woman|women]] - in [[Adigrat]] in the north Of [[Ethiopia]], who are [[discrimination|disadvantaged]] for various reasons, and accompanies them financially and ideally during their studies at a university or their education. The project is funded mainly by current and former students at the university.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift" /&gt; It is largely funded by donations.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Finanzierung" /&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Any Day, Adigrat (12582724894).jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Street scene in Adigrat, 2014]]
The idea for the educational project was developed in 2010 during a research trip on the subject of [[AIDS]] by the then head of the IWM, Albert-Peter Rethmann. It was in the context of a research project of the ''[[German Bishops' Conference]]'' (German: ''Deutsche Bischofskonferenz'') in Adigrat in [[Tigray Region]] in northern Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Geschichte" /&gt; In this region, many young people have no access to [[higher education]] due to lack of family support, many are [[AIDS orphan]]s. Young women are particularly affected by this situation through discrimination. An initiative of the ''Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat'' (ADCS) of the ''[[Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat]]'' has already supported ten young people with micro-scholarships for obtaining a university entrance qualification and at least one [[bachelor's degree]] in their own country. One of the sponsored students was the AIDS [[orphan]] Rahel Hailay.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Geschichte" /&gt; The result of the journey resulting from the trip was an [[international]] initiative of students for students in the age of [[globalization]] as an overall project.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Geschichte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Webseite" /&gt;&lt;ref name="kath.net-Projekt-Rahel" /&gt;

Due to personnel fluctuation among students at the Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology, the project has been phasing out slowly since the end of 2017. The tasks of the support are gradually taken over by the ''Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat'' (ADCS) and former graduates in Ethiopia.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Letter" /&gt;

== Target ==
The project supports disadvantaged, primarily female, young people in the Tigray Region who lack equal access to education for reasons of [[poverty]] or gender.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-katholisch.de" /&gt; The financial support consists of micro-scholarships. The scholarship holders are accompanied during their studies or education. The name of the project comes from Rahel Hailay, who completed the study of [[biology]] and [[zoology]] at the universities in [[Axum]] and [[Mek'ele]] from 2009 to 2014.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Rahel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="betterplace-Projekt-Rahel" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Projekt-Rahel-Video-2011" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Projekt-Rahel-Video-2014" /&gt; By 2015 the training of 47 young Ethiopians had been made possible. Nowadays the promotion of 40 young people at the same time is possible. In addition to financial support, an important further aspect is the promotion of networking among scholarship holders and the promotion of [[ethics|ethical]] behaviour in [[Christianity|Christian]] sense. Through women who are given a higher level of education through this project, others should be given the idea of achieving a higher level of education.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-missio" /&gt;

This [[development aid|development cooperation]] is intended to give [[liberty|freedom]] to the beneficiaries without material needs and making their lives self-responsible. An important factor for a lasting effect is, in particular, the motivation of those who want this development. Central is therefore the promotion of the [[autonomy]] and self-initiative of the scholarship holders in the sense of the Catholic social doctrine. The initiative of the students from [[Germany]] can serve as a model for the students in Ethiopia. It is possible that the project will in the future develop into an Ethiopian [[Alumnus|alumni]] project where graduates who are in work assist other young people in their education.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Entwicklung" /&gt;

As a secondary effect, training programs such as the Rahel project are also a medium to long-term contribution to the fight against become a [[refugee]] due to lack of education and resulting poverty.&lt;ref name="BMZ-Fluchtursachen" /&gt;

== Funding and public relations ==
[[File:Coffee Ceremony (7926066672).jpg|thumb|upright=1.7|Ethiopian coffee ceremony in Tigray Region, 2012]]
The educational project is financed through [[Fundraising|public donations]] and campaigns, such as at the Frankfurter Stadtkirchenfest at ''[[Frankfurt Cathedral]]'' (German: ''Kaiserdom St. Bartholomäus''),&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-FR-28082016" /&gt; collects in Catholic church [[parish]]es and the ''[[Centre for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg]]'', as well as the salvation of festivities such as the summer festival of the ''Sankt Georgen Graduate School of Philosophy and Theology''&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-FNP-15062013" /&gt; with an Ethiopian coffee ceremony, [[auction]]s and other revenues. In addition, these actions also serve to create new contacts, information and exchange on the project.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Finanzierung"/&gt; There is a special purpose for the missio donation [[bank account]] for transfers to the Rahel project.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-missio" /&gt; These actions are also supported by the ''Network of Frankfurt One World Groups'' in [[Frankfurt]].&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Netzwerk" /&gt; In addition to the [[internet]], media such as the ''Radio Horeb'' also include public relations activities.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Horeb" /&gt;

The Rachel educational project is funded by the ''[[Cusanuswerk]]'', a gifted support program under the supervision of the ''Catholic German Bishops' Conference''&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Cusanuswerk" /&gt; and by the ''Center for Christian Meditation and Spirituality of the Diocese of Limburg''.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Bildungsprojekt-HK" /&gt;

== Realisation ==
[[File:Ethiopia - Eparchia di Adigrat.jpg|thumb|Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat]]
The project is supported by the ''[[Pontifical Mission Societies]]'' (German: ''missio'') in all financial matters, such as account management, the administrative costs or the [[wire transfer|transfer]] of money to Ethiopia. In Ethiopia the project is supervised locally by the ''Adigrat Diocesan Catholic Secretariat'' (ADCS) of the ''[[Ethiopian Catholic Eparchy of Adigrat]]'' under the patronage of the [[diocesan bishop]] Tesfay Medhin&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Reise3" /&gt; within the framework of the ''[[OVC project]]'' (''Orphans and Vulnerable Children''). The ''OVC project'' is active in the areas of Adigrat and other areas particularly affected by poverty. The [[project manager]] of the ADCS Woldemariam Besirat selects the scholarship holders&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-FR-28082016" /&gt; and organizes religious education workshops on scholarship meetings with their own and external lecturers on topics such as [[AIDS]], the consequences of [[emigration]] as [[refugee]]s or on other [[medicine|medical]] or [[ethics|ethical]] issues. In addition to financial support, the promotion of [[autonomy|self-reliance]], [[self-confidence]] and [[self-esteem]], the promotion of self-responsibility, the awareness of [[social responsibility|responsibility]] and the ability to [[cooperation|work together]] are important aspects of the work of the OVC project.&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-Geschichte" /&gt;&lt;ref name="IWM-Rahel-Festschrift-missio" /&gt;

'''''Syphon Filter''''' is a [[third-person shooter]] [[stealth video game]] developed by [[SIE Bend Studio|Eidetic]] and published by [[989 Studios]] for [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]]. It is the first game in the [[Syphon Filter|''Syphon Filter'' series]], the plot centres on special agents Gabriel "Gabe" Logan and Lian Xing who are tasked by the United States government to apprehend an international terrorist from Germany.

Development on ''Syphon Filter'' began with the intention of creating a new "super-spy" genre hybrid that contained elements of [[stealth video game|stealth]]-[[action video game|action]] and [[puzzle video game|puzzle]] solving. The game was almost cancelled several times during development as Eidetic faced many difficulties due to the lack of inspiration from others and their inexperience in creating video games. Despite the initial drawbacks faced, ''Syphon Filter'' was met with positive reviews from critics upon release, mostly directed at its innovation and immersive plot.

==Gameplay==
[[File:Syphon Filter gameplay 001.jpg|thumb|left|A still image from the first level of the game. The interface displays Logan's armour, ammunition count and radar.]]

The game is presented in a [[third person shooter|third-person]] perspective, and the player can freely move in three-dimensional space and rotate the camera in any direction. The top left corner of the screen interface shows the status of Logan's armour, a 'danger-meter' which rises as the player engages enemies through combat, and a target lock. A radar is displayed in the bottom left corner of the screen which shows the location of various objects including friendly units, enemies, weapon pick ups or mission objectives.&lt;ref name=overview&gt;{{cite web|title=Syphon Filter overview|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/syphon-filter/ps-10574|publisher=[[IGN]]|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current weapon equipped is always displayed in the bottom right corner, with the ammunition count. Depending on the weapon used, the camera will shift to [[first person shooter|first-person]] mode to assist in aiming.&lt;ref name=overview/&gt;&lt;ref name=stephany&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nunneley|first1=Stephany|title=From Baldur’s Gate to Syphon Filter: 14 games that need a HD remake|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/07/21/from-baldurs-gate-to-syphon-filter-14-games-that-need-a-hd-remake/|publisher=[[VG 24/7]]|accessdate=6 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The core of the gameplay is focused on stealth-based tactics, which require one to silently take out enemies using silenced weapons or other lethal attacks. However, most of the game is [[action game|action]]-orientated,&lt;ref name=stephany/&gt; which involves Logan navigating through levels whilst shooting enemies.&lt;ref name=engadget&gt;{{cite web|last1=Yoon|first1=Andrew|title=Retro Review: Syphon Filter|url=https://www.engadget.com/2006/12/24/psone-review-syphon-filter/|publisher=[[Engadget]]|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game takes place in a wide variety of locations, including narrow interior streets of [[Washington D.C.]] to wide open plains of [[Kazakhstan]].&lt;ref name=overview/&gt; In some stealth based missions, the game will involve various puzzles.&lt;ref name=engadget/&gt; Some locations feature low light ambience, which force the player to use their [[flashlight]] despite its drawbacks imposed during stealth missions.&lt;ref name=stephany/&gt;

==Plot==
In the year 1999, Gabriel Logan and his partner Lian Xing investigate a series of biological outbreaks triggered by international terrorist Erich Rhoemer. When fellow agent Ellis loses contact during a mission in Costa Rica, the top-secret Agency dispatches Gabe and Lian to find him. They discover Ellis is dead, and Rhoemer's suspected drug operation is a cover for the viral operation. Another outbreak in Nepal leads to more questions when an infected person who should have died somehow survived.

Before the Agency can pursue Rhoemer, he assaults Washington, D.C. and threatens to detonate viral bombs scattered across the city. Gabe battles several terrorists, including Mara Aramov, as he follows the trail of bombs across city streets, subways, Washington Park and finally Freedom Memorial where he must incinerate munitions expert Anton Girdeux to stop the final threat.

Gabe's investigation takes him to a new lead from PharCom, a multinational pharmaceutical and biotechnology corporation headed by Jonathan Phagan. The Costa Rican plantation was growing PharCom compounds, meaning Phagan and Rhoemer were cooperating. At the PharCom Exposition Center, Gabe shadows Phagan to a meeting with Aramov and Edward Benton, an apparent Agency turncoat who assisted Rhoemer during the Washington D.C. attack.

After Gabe eliminates Benton, he saves Phagan from assassination only to have him escape. Mara Aramov, now in custody, had attempted to locate PharCom's virus labs. Gabe must set aside the hunt for Phagan to destroy Rhoemer's base in Kazakhstan. During his assignment, Rhoemer seemingly kills Lian, but Agency Director Thomas Markinson rescues Gabe.

Markinson gives Gabe a report on the virus called Syphon Filter, a bioweapon that one can program on a genetic level to target specific groups of people. Markinson orders Gabe to infiltrate Rhoemer's stronghold in Ukraine to inject test subjects with a vaccine and locate Phagan, who is now Rhoemer's prisoner. In the catacombs, Phagan tells Gabe that Lian is alive, and they reunite. Lian has become infected with Syphon Filter, and she says there is no universal cure.

Mara Aramov arrives to shoot Phagan, but she convinces Gabe and Lian that she came to help. The three travel to PharCom's warehouses in hopes of preventing Rhoemer from launching a missile. Lian reveals that the serum Gabe injected into the test subjects was really a lethal chemical, and Markinson was having them killed. Using the fighting between Rhoemer's terrorists and Phagan's security personnel to cover his insertion, Gabe descends into a silo and searches for the missile's detonation codes.

He finds Markinson, who admits that the Agency was in fact in cahoots with Black Baton all along. Rhoemer worked for Markinson, since the latter wanted the virus in the Agency's possession. He never authorized the missile attack, but before he can stop it, Rhoemer kills Markinson with a headshot. Gabe must reach the missile's control center in time and destroy it. Enraged, Rhoemer engages Gabe in a final fight, but is killed with a gas grenade.

Their mission completed, Gabe and Lian call in the U.S. Army Chemical and Biological Defense Command (CBDC) to secure the area. They do not know how far Markinson was cooperating with Rhoemer and Phagan, but Gabe believes they may never know. In a post-credits scene, Aramov approaches a mysterious man inside the Agency headquarters and whispers something in his ear. He congratulates her while the camera pulls back to show PharCom boxes in the office.

{{Quote box|quote=''Syphon Filter'' went through a few rough patches and came close to being cancelled several times.|source=John Garvin in an interview with PlayStation US, October 2012&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; |width=30em |quoted=1}}
According to creative director John Garvin, ''Syphon Filter'' was originally conceived as "just a name" from a producer at [[989 Studios]]. Initially, there was no plot, character or gameplay from the original one page synopsis.&lt;ref name=interview&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shuman|first1=Sid|title=Behind the Classics: Syphon Filter|url=http://blog.us.playstation.com/2012/10/25/behind-the-classics-syphon-filter/|publisher=PlayStation US|accessdate=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[SCE Bend Studio|Eidetic]] decided to set ''Syphon Filter'' as a new 'stealth-action' hybrid that focused heavily on weapons, gadgets and stealth. The team's lead designer was influenced over [[Rare (company)|Rare]]'s successful ''[[GoldenEye 007 (1997 video game)|GoldenEye 007]]'' for the Nintendo 64, and implemented the game's mechanics to have a similar feel for a new "super spy" genre.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

The team experienced immense difficulty in creating the game, as Garvin noted that there were "no, or few, games" from which Eidetic could draw inspiration. Most of the team that developed ''Syphon Filter'' had little experience with making third-person action games,&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; as Eidetic's only video game released for a console was ''[[Bubsy 3D]]'', which was released three years prior for the PlayStation and was infamous for being critically panned as [[List of video games notable for negative reception|one of the worst games of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2015/oct/15/30-worst-video-games-of-all-time-part-one|title=The 30 worst video games of all time – part one|last=Stuart|first=Keith|last2=Kelly|first2=Andy|date=2015-10-15|website=The Guardian|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-07-17|last3=Parkin|first3=Simon|last4=Cobbett|first4=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the initial difficulties with staff and lack of experience, Eidetic produced a prototype which involved a shooting segment in an [[Subway (underpass)|underground]]. Garvin admitted that the team "didn't know anything about making realistic shooters set in a spy world" as the game came close to being cancelled several times throughout development because the team was missing deadlines, revamping mechanics and changing the story.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt; During development, the team of thirteen re-wrote several drafts as the game was being conceived. The original plot of ''Syphon Filter'' was intended as a science-fiction orientated approach and involved a group of kidnapped scientists who were being forced to build a time machine by an unspecified antagonistic organisation. The storyline was radically changed when John Garvin was hired to be art director, later creative director.&lt;ref name=interview/&gt;

}}

''Syphon Filter'' received "critical acclaim" reviews, according to video game [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]].&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt; ''[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]]'' stated that, although the game borrows elements from both ''GoldenEye 007'' and ''[[Metal Gear Solid]]'' and that "the execution could have been better accomplished, Eidetic [introduced] a few ideas of its own, and these go a long way towards providing the game with its own identity."&lt;ref name="Edge review"&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Syphon Filter |magazine=[[Edge (magazine)|Edge]] |publisher=[[Future Publishing]] |issue=72 |page=92 |date=June 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blend of a stealth-action hybrid gameplay was praised by most critics. Doug Perry of [[IGN]] enjoyed the implemented skill-based action that he considered was "hard to come by in a PlayStation game". Perry praised the game's detail and advanced graphics, but criticised the low resolution and noting that the game's [[frame rate]] was "not perfect". Despite this, he noted that what ''Syphon Filter'' "gives up in frame rate [it] provides in character and environment detail".&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

[[Game Revolution]] similarly praised the attention to detail, calling every texture of the game "well planned and rendered". However, they claimed that the graphics were not as good as ''Metal Gear Solid''. They also noted that during some points the game "suffers from many typical PlayStation polygonal errors", causing some textures to become "warped" when viewed from an angle, although they noted that glitches were uncommon and did not affect gameplay in any way.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt;

The gameplay and [[artificial intelligence]] were the most praised aspects of the game. Game Revolution noted the gameplay was "well above average" and had an excellent [[replay value]], in contrast to games such as ''[[Star Fox 64]]'' once completed.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; Perry praised the game's wide variety of weapons and gadgets, having counted at least thirty different weapons and equipment for the player to use, with the added bonus of secret weapons, adding to the gameplay value.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Game Revolution added that the AI was "perhaps the best part of the game", commending on how certain enemies react on when one of their comrades are killed nearby.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; IGN similarly praised its AI, pointing out on how every time a level is played the AI would change its behaviour, sometimes hiding behind trees or carrying different weapons.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt;

===Sequels===
Due to its popularity, Sony commissioned [[989 Studios]] to make various sequels and spin-offs to the game. ''[[Syphon Filter 2]]'' was released in 2000 to popular reviews from critics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syphon Filter 2 overview|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/syphon-filter-2/ps-13667|publisher=IGN|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another direct sequel, ''[[Syphon Filter 3]]'' was released in 2001 to mixed reviews upon release.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Fujita|first1=Mark|title=Syphon Filter 3 review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2001/11/28/syphon-filter-3|publisher=IGN|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two spin-offs were released for the [[PlayStation Portable]] in 2006 and 2007; ''[[Syphon Filter: Dark Mirror]]'' and ''[[Syphon Filter: Logan's Shadow]]'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dark Mirror overview|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/dual-pack-syphon-filter-socom/psp-682959|publisher=IGN|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LS&gt;{{cite web|title=Logan's Shadow overview|url=http://uk.ign.com/games/syphon-filter-logans-shadow/psp-907107|publisher=IGN|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A port to the [[PlayStation 2]] for ''Logan's Shadow'' was released exclusively in North America in 2010.&lt;ref name=LS/&gt; The two spin-offs were met with mixed to positive reviews from critics, which led to the end of the ''Syphon Filter'' series in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haynes|first1=Jeff|title=Logan's Shadow review|url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2007/10/03/syphon-filter-logans-shadow-review|publisher=IGN|accessdate=11 September 2015|date=2 October 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
The Kural remains the most reviewed work of the [[Tamil literature]], with almost every scholar down the ages having written commentaries on it. Of the several hundred commentaries written on the didactic work over the centuries, the commentaries written by a group of ten medieval scholars are considered to have high literary value. The ten poets are:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Each commentators followed his own sense of logic in the arrangement of the chapters and the couplets within them. Researchers have found as many as 16, 20, 120, and 171 variations in the ordering of the Kural couplets by Pari Perumal, Paridhi, Parimelazhagar, and Kaalingar, respectively, with respect to the commentary by Manakkudavar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Chapter order variations==
Valluvar wrote the Kural literature in three parts, namely, [[Book of Aram|Book I]], [[Book of Porul|Book II]], and [[Book of Inbam|Book III]], containing a total of 133 chapters in all, without splitting the books further into any subdivisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= M.

J.

They also changed the ordering of the couplets within each chapter widely. These variations are not absolute either but vary according to different commentators. While the variations in the ordering of the couplets according to various commentators are found across the work, variations in the grouping and ordering of chapters are found only in the [[Book of Aram|Book on Virtue]] (Book I).

The following table lists the variations between ordering of chapters in Book I by Manakkudavar (the oldest) and that by Parimelalhagar (the latest).&lt;ref name="Uraiasiriyargal"&gt;{{cite book

'''''The St. Cecilia Altarpiece''''' is an [[oil painting]] by Italian [[High Renaissance]] painter [[Raphael]]. Completed in his later years, around 1516-1517, the painting depicts [[Saint Cecilia]], the [[patron saint]] of musicians and [[Church music]], listening to a choir of angels in the company of [[Paul of Tarsus|St. Paul]], [[John the Apostle|St. John the Evangelist]], [[Augustine of Hippo|St. Augustine]] and [[Mary Magdalene]]. Commissioned for a church in [[Bologna]], the painting now hangs there in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale (Bologna)|Pinacoteca Nazionale]], or National Painting Gallery.  According to Vasari the musical instruments strewn about Cecilia's feet were not painted by Raphael, but by his student, [[Giovanni da Udine]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Vasari, ''Le vite de' piu eccellenti pittori, scultori ed architettori,'' ed. G. Milanesi, Milan, 1906, VI, 551.  Late in his career Raphael typically assigned portions of his works to assistants.  On this point see Andrea Emiliani," L'estasi di Santa Cecilia," in ''L'estasi di Santa Cecilia di Raffaello da Urbino nella Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani, Bologna: Alfa, 1983, i-xciii,&lt;/ref&gt;

English [[Romantic poet]] [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Percy Shelley]] described the painting as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The central figure, St. Cecilia, seems rapt in such inspiration as produced her image in the painter's mind; her deep, dark, eloquent eyes lifted up; her chestnut hair flung back from her forehead — she holds an organ in her hands — her countenance, as it were, calmed by the depth of its passion and rapture, and penetrated throughout with the warm and radiant light of life. She is listening to the music of heaven, and, as I imagine, has just ceased to sing, for the four figures that surround her evidently point, by their attitudes, towards her; particularly St. John, who, with a tender yet impassioned gesture, bends his countenance towards her, languid with the depth of emotion. At her feet lie various instruments of music, broken and unstrung.&lt;ref&gt;''Letters from Italy''; quoted in Singleton (1899), p. 288.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==History==
The altarpiece was commissioned for a chapel dedicated to St. Cecilia at the Augustinian church of [[San Giovanni in Monte]] in Bologna. According to [[Vasari]] the work was commissioned by [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]] [[Lorenzo Pucci]] in 1513.&lt;ref&gt;Vasari, IV, 349, and III, 545; Vasari (1987), 303-304; Champlin and Perkins (1913), 261.  Pucci family documents ascribe the commission to Cardinal Lorenzo's nephew, Antonio, a canon of Florence Cathedral.  O. Pucci, "La santa Cecilia di Raffaello d'Urbino," ''Rivista Fiorentina'', I, June, 1908, 6-7.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the extraordinary popularity of the painter at this time in his career, it is likely that only such a highly placed church authority could have had any hope of hiring him.  The patron of the chapel itself, however, was Elena Duglioli dall'Olio, an aristocratic Bolognese woman who would later be beatified for her piety.  She was a close friend of Antonio Pucci, Cardinal Lorenzo's nephew, and most art historians today agree that the Pucci must have served as her agents and advisers with Raphael and that the painting was more likely commissioned for her around 1516, when construction on the chapel was completed.&lt;ref&gt;Stanislaw Mossakowski, "Raphael's ''St. Cecilia.'' An Iconographical Study," ''Zeitschrift für Kunstgeschichte,'' 31 (1968), 1-2; Gabriella Zarri, "L'altra Cecilia: Elena Duglioli dall'Olio (1472-1520)," in ''La Santa Cecilia di Raffaello: Indagini per un dipinto,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani (Bologna: Alfa, 1983), 81-118; Carla Bernardini, "Antefatti Bolognese: Una traccia," in ''L'estasi di Santa Cecilia di Raffaello da Urbino nella Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna,'' ed. Andrea Emiliani, Bologna: Alfa, 1983, 2-19. Historian [[Eugène Müntz]] suggested in his 1882 biography of the artist that Elena Duglioni was inspired to build a chapel by a vision, but conveyed her inspiration to her kinsman [[Antonio Pucci (cardinal)|Antonio Pucci]], who footed the bill for the chapel and convinced his uncle Lorenzo to commission the work. Müntz (1882), 525.&lt;/ref&gt; Duglioli had a particular devotion to the cult of St. Cecilia and had been given a relic (her knucklebone) by the papal legate to Bologna, [[Francesco Adiosi|Cardinal Francesco Alidosi]].  She struggled to live a chaste life in emulation of the early Christian saint and persuaded her husband not to consummate their marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 2; Roger Jones and Nicholas Penny, ''Raphael,'' New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1983, 146.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting was looted to [[Paris]] in 1798.&lt;ref&gt;Champlin and Perkins (1913), 261.&lt;/ref&gt; While there, it was [[Transfer of panel paintings|transferred to canvas]]. In 1815, the painting was returned to Bologna where, after cleaning, and was hung in the [[Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna]]. The painting's condition is poor, as it has been damaged by repainting over the years.

==Iconography==
St. Cecilia's companions are identified in part by their attributes. Immediately to her right, John the Evangelist has an eagle, his usual symbol,&lt;ref&gt;Nici (2008), 155.&lt;/ref&gt; peeking out around his robes. Beside him, Paul leans on the sword with which he had come to be identified in medieval art.&lt;ref&gt;Lowrie (2007), 148-149.&lt;/ref&gt; Augustine of Hippo holds his [[crosier]]. Mary Magdalene holds the alabaster jar by which she is most commonly identified.&lt;ref&gt;Gardner (2007), 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

The iconography of the altarpiece is unusual in that rather than portraying a figure or figures to be worshipped, it represents the act of worship itself. Each of the saints was associated with visions - as was Elena Duglioni herself - and the celestial choir that opens above the saints' heads is closely associated with the patron's own devotions, in which music was an important element.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 3-4; Jones and Penny, 146; Wolfgang Osthoff, "Raffael und die Musik", in ''Raffael in seiner Zeit'', ed. Volker Hoffman
Nurnberg: Verlag Hans Carl, 1987, 155-88.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cecilia was associated with music from the Middle Ages,&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Connolly, ''Mourning into Joy:  Music, Raphael, and St. Cecilia'', New Haven:  Yale University Press, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; but the broken instruments here appear to refer to the abandonment of earthly pleasures that resulted from Cecilia's devotion to the sacred.  In this painting she personifies religious music as a route to union with God.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski, 5-6, suggests the broken instruments represent "the secular music of the wedding rejected by St. Cecilia."  He goes on to note that instrumental music had, since the time of the Greeks, been less esteemed than vocal music.&lt;/ref&gt;

The painting further celebrates the theme of chastity.  St. Cecilia's simple belt is a traditional Renaissance symbol for chastity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=E.|last= Wind|title= Pagan Mysteries in the Renaissance|location= New York City|year= 1958|page= 123, note 3}}&lt;/ref&gt; John the Evangelist was the patron saint of virginity; and Paul praised celibacy in I Corinthians.  Thus the painting's iconography is closely tied to the life of the patron on many levels.&lt;ref&gt;Mossakowski further analyzes the painting as an expression of erudite [[Humanism in Italy|humanist]] ideas,&lt;/ref&gt;

There is an engraving of the painting by [[Marcantonio Raimondi]]: it differs significantly from the work, and some scholars have suggested that it reflects a lost sketch for the altarpiece.&lt;ref&gt;Müntz (1882), p. 529.&lt;/ref&gt; In it Raphael depicted the angels with instruments as well — harp, triangle and violin — and the figures are in very different poses. Augustine (wearing his [[mitre]]) and Paul look downward; John looks out towards the viewer; the Magdalene looks upward to the angelic host, as Cecilia does.  Raimondi's engravings are frequently known to alter Raphael's works, however, so it is not impossible that it represents a free variant of the finished altarpiece rather than a copy of a sketch of Raphael's initial intentions.&lt;ref&gt;P. Kristeller, "Marc-Antonios Beziehungen zu Raffael",  ''Jahrbuch der Preussischen Kunstsammlungen'', XXVIII (1907), 219-221, 228; M. Pittaluga, ''L'incisione italiana nel Cinquecento,'' 1928, pp. 144, 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7075">'''The International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences''' (IASCYS) is an honor society initially created by the [[International Federation for Systems Research]] (IFSR). The academy identifies outstanding scientists in systems and cybernetics and  elects them as academicians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iascys.org/pictures/IASCYSappointmentProcedure.png|title=Nominations procedure|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The members of the Academy conduct workshops and speak at conferences&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ifsr.ocg.at/world/files/IASCYS-General-Assembly-and%20Conference-2010.pdf|title=Conference and General Assembly 2010 (October 25 -27, 2010, Chengdu, China)|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; about advances in the field.

== Origin ==
In 2010, the [[International Federation for Systems Research]] established an international non-profit association called The International Academy for Systems and Cybernetic Sciences. For 6 years the IASCYS was governed as an IFSR partner organization, but in 2016 it became an independent organization having its own statutes, rules of procedure and membership criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iascys.org/IASCYS_office/IASCYSappointmentProcedure2016.pdf|title=Appointment Procedure|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iascys.org/IASCYS_office/IASCYSstatutes2016.pdf|title=Statutes of IASCYS|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Aims ==
IASCYS was founded to honor and activate outstanding members of the systems and cybernetics community. The fields of systems and cybernetics emphasize a holistic perspective, thus we help people create points of view that describe more of the variety in the world, and thus our work bridges and fills the spaces between the descriptions from traditional sciences. Systems science and cybernetics, in both theory and application, facilitate transdisciplinary cooperation leading to insights into synergies and generalizations and the creation of methods for coping with situations that the traditional sciences fail to cover. Thus, the otherwise resulting oversights are replaced by new insights. These intellectual endeavors help people as individuals, their organizations, and humankind to attain a more complete appreciation, through perception, thinking, emotional and spiritual life, decision making, communication, and action, and therefore to attain more success and well being. Academicians are nominated&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iascys.org/IASCYS_office/IASCYScriteria2016.pdf|title=2016 nomination criteria|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by an association in the field. Biographies of IASCYS members are published on the [http://www.iascys.org/ IASCYS web-site].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iascys.org/IASCYS_office/IASCYS_Aims_Intentions.pdf|title=Aims and Intentions|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ifsr.org/index.php/international-academy-systems-cybernetic-sciences/|title=Academy (IASCYS) on IFSR Website|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Motivations ==
National and international academies of sciences and arts previously did not include the contributions of systems and cybernetics in their list of sciences and arts. This situation overlooks the contributions which these fields have made to many traditional fields. IASCYS was created to build bridges among the member associations, to identify the most qualified scientists and practitioners in the field in order to invite them as keynote speakers to conferences, to recognize systems and cybernetics as sciences equal to other sciences, and to create links among the leading members of the systems and cybernetics community with the intent to aid and promote the development of these fields.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Intentions ==
Two missions of the IASCYS are, through coordination of the actions of the member associations, to create an internationally accepted curriculum in systems and cybernetics and to create an auditing process aimed at validation and promotion of education in systems and cybernetics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Theory of generations''' (or '''sociology of generations''') is a theory posed by [[Karl Mannheim]] in his 1928 essay, "[https://www.1000dokumente.de/pdf/dok_0100_gen_de.pdf Das Problem der Generationen]," and translated into English in 1952 as "The Problem of Generations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mannheim |first= Karl | chapter= The Problem of Generations |date=1952 |title= Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge: Collected Works, Volume 5 |editor1-last = Kecskemeti | editor1-first= Paul | location= New York|publisher= Routledge|page=276–322}}&lt;/ref&gt; This essay has been described as "the most systematic and fully developed" and even "the seminal theoretical treatment of [[generation]]s as a [[sociology|sociological]] phenomenon".&lt;ref name=jp&gt;Jane Pilcher, ''[http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/94PilcherMannheimSocGenBJS.pdf Mannheim's sociology of generations: an undervalued legacy]'', 1993&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mannheim, people are significantly influenced by the socio-historical environment (in particular, notable events that involve them actively) of their youth; giving rise, on the basis of shared experience, to social cohorts that in their turn influence events that shape future generations.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Because of the historical context in which Mannheim wrote, some critics contend that the theory of generations centers around Western ideas and lacks a broader cultural understanding. &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'We don't have any limits': Russian young adult life narratives through a social generations lens|journal = Journal of Youth Studies|date = 2015-07-24|issn = 1367-6261|pages = 1–16|volume = 0|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930|first = Darcie|last = Vandegrift}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller Schwarze, Nina 2015 The Blood of Victoriano Lorenzo: An Ethnography of the Cholos of Northern Coclé Province.  Jefferson, North Carolina: McFarland Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Others argue that the theory of generations should be global in scope, due to the increasingly globalized nature of contemporary society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Edmunds |first1=June |last2=Turner |first2=Bryan S. |title=Global Generations: Social Change in the Twentieth Century |journal=British Journal of Sociology |date=2005 |volume=56 |issue=4 |pages=559–577 |doi=10.1111/j.1468-4446.2005.00083.x |pmid=16309436 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
Mannheim defined a generation (note that some have suggested that the term [[Demographics#Generational_cohorts|cohort]] is more correct, to distinguish social generations from the [[kinship]] (family, blood-related generations)&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; as a group of individuals of similar ages whose members have experienced a noteworthy historical event within a set period of time.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=bl&gt;Bob Lively, ''[http://www.nazarene.org/files/docs/Nazarene_Baby_Boomers_in_the_21st_Century.pdf Nazarene Baby Boomer’s in the 21st Century:Service and Self-fulfillment]'', Presented at ANSR 2002&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Mannheim, social consciousness and perspective of youth reaching maturity in a particular time and place (what he termed "generational location") is significantly influenced by the major historical events of that era (thus becoming a "generation in actuality").&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=wj&gt;Willis, John. ''[http://www.eric.ed.gov/ERICWebPortal/search/detailmini.jsp?_nfpb=true&amp;_&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchValue_0=ED148682&amp;ERICExtSearch_SearchType_0=no&amp;accno=ED148682 Generations and Social Movements of the 60's and 70's]''. Revised version of a paper presented at Annual Meeting of the American Sociological Association (Chicago, Illinois, September 5–9, 1977)&lt;/ref&gt; A key point, however, is that this major historical event has to occur, and has to involve the individuals in their young age (thus shaping their lives, as later experiences will tend to receive meaning from those early experiences); a mere chronological contemporaneity is not enough to produce a common generational consciousness.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Mannheim in fact stressed that not every generation will develop an original and distinctive consciousness.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Whether a generation succeeds in developing a distinctive consciousness is significantly dependent on the pace of [[social change]] ("tempo of change").&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; 

Mannheim notes also that social change can occur gradually, without the need for major historical events, but those events are more likely to occur in times of accelerated social and cultural change.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt; Mannheim did also note that the members of a generation are internally stratified (by their location, culture, class, etc.), thus they may view different events from different angles and thus are not totally homogenous.&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;&lt;ref name=bl/&gt; Even with the "generation in actuality", there may be differing forms of response to the particular historical situation, thus stratifying by a number of "generational units" (or "social generations").&lt;ref name=jp/&gt;

==Application==
Mannheim's theory of generations has been applied to explain how important historical, cultural, and political events of the late 1950s and the early 1960s educated youth (of the [[Baby Boom Generation]]) of the inequalities in [[American society]], such as their involvement along with other generations in the [[Civil Rights Movement]], and have given rise to a belief that those inequalities need to be changed by individual and collective action.&lt;ref name=wj/&gt; This has pushed an influential minority of young people in the United States toward [[social movement]] activity.&lt;ref name=wj/&gt; On the other hand, the generation which came of age in the later part of the 1960s and 1970s was much less engaged in social movement activity, because - according to the theory of generations - the events of that era were more conducive to a political orientation stressing individual fulfillment instead of participation in such social movements questioning the ''[[status quo]]''.&lt;ref name=wj/&gt; Social generation studies mainly focus on the youth experience from the perspective of the [[Western culture|Western society]]. "Social generations theory lacks ample consideration of youth outside of the west. Increased empirical attention to non-Western cases corrects the tendency of youth studies to 'other' non-Western youth and provides a more in-depth understanding of the dynamics of reflexive life management."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = 'We don't have any limits': Russian young adult life narratives through a social generations lens|journal = Journal of Youth Studies|date = 2015-07-24|issn = 1367-6261|pages = 1–16|volume = 0|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/13676261.2015.1059930|first = Darcie|last = Vandegrift}}&lt;/ref&gt; The constraints and opportunities affecting a youth's experiences within particular sociopolitical contexts require research to be done in a wide array of spaces to better reflect the theory and its implications on youth's experiences. &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Müller Schwarze, Nina

A '''tour guide''' (U.S.) or a '''tourist guide''' (European) is a person who provides assistance, information on cultural, historical and contemporary heritage to people on organized [[Tourism|tour]]s and individual clients at educational establishments, religious and historical sites, museums, and at venues of other significant interest , attractions sites.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jobmonkey.com/landtours/html/tour_guide_interview.html On the Job: A Seasoned Tour Guide Tells All], [http://www.jobmonkey.com/ JobMonkey.com].&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:"A Tour Guide to the Famous Places of the Capital" from Akizato Rito's Miyako meisho zue (1787).jpg|thumb|A Filipino tourist consulting a tour guide and a guide book from Akizato Ritō's ''Miyako meisho zue'' (1787)]]

In 18th-century Japan, a traveler could pay for a tour guide or consult [[guide book]]s such as [[Kaibara Ekken]]'s ''Keijō Shōran'' (The Excellent Views of Kyoto).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berry|first1=Mary Elizabeth|title=Japan in Print Information and Nation in the Early Modern Period|year=2006|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley, California|isbn=9780520254176|pages=185–190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Tour guide at the National Museum of the American Indian.jpg|thumb|A tour guide in the [[National Museum of the American Indian]]]]
The CEN ([[European Committee for Standardization]]) definition for "tourist guide" &amp;ndash; part of the work by CEN on definitions for terminology within the tourism industry &amp;ndash; is a "person who guides visitors in the language of their choice and interprets the [[Cultural heritage|cultural]] and [[natural heritage]] of an area, which person normally possesses an area-specific qualification usually issued and/or recognized by the appropriate authority".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EN 15565 2008 Standard for the Training and Qualification of Tourist Guides...|url=http://wftga.org/news/en-15565-2008-standard-training-and-qualification-tourist-guides|website=World Federation of Tourist Guide Assiciations|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEN also defines a "to manager" as a "person who manages and supervises the itinerary on behalf of the tour operator, ensuring the programme is carried out as described in the tour operator's literature and sold to the traveller/consumer and who gives local practical information".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EN 15565 2008 Standard for the Training and Qualification of Tourist Guides...|url=http://wftga.org/news/en-15565-2008-standard-training-and-qualification-tourist-guides|website=World Federation of Tourist Guide Associations|accessdate=15 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Europe]], tourist guides are represented by FEG, the European Federation of Tourist Guide Associations. In Europe, the tourist guiding qualification is specific to each and every country; in some cases the qualification is national, in some cases it is broken up into regions. In all cases it is embedded in the educational and training ethic of that country. EN15565 is a European Standard for the Training and Qualification of Tourist Guides.

In [[Australia]], tour guides are qualified to a minimum of [https://training.gov.au/Training/Details/SIT30513 Certificate III Guiding]. They belong to a couple of organisations, notably the ''Professional Tour Guide Association of Australia'' [PTGAA] and ''Guides of Australia'' [GOA].

In [[Japan]], tour guides are required to pass a certification exam by the Commissioner of the Japan Tourism Agency and register with the relevant prefectures. Non-licensed guides caught performing guide-interpreter activities can face a fine up to 500,000 Yen&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tour Guides and Staff|url=https://japandeluxetours.com/about/tour-guide-staff|website=Japan Deluxe Tours|accessdate=22 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[India]] its mandatory to own the license approved by the [[Ministry of Tourism (India)]] to work officially as a tourist guide. The government provides the license to regional level [[tour guide]] and also runs a Regional Level Guide Training Program (RLGTP). These programs and training sessions are conducted under the guidance of [[Indian Institute of Tourism and Travel Management]] (IITTM) or other government recognized institutes.&lt;ref&gt;https://theghumakkads.in/how-to-become-tourist-guide-in-india/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
The current [[United States Department of Defense]] system for naming and designating aircraft aims to provide a unified system across all services that applies to all military aerial and space craft. There are two basic components to a craft's identity: its designation, and its common name.

A vehicle designation is sometimes referred to as a '''Mission Design Series''' ('''MDS'''), referring to the three main parts of the designation, that combine to form a unique profile for each vehicle. The first series of letters (up to four) determine the type of craft and designed mission. A series number identifies major types which are of the same type and mission, and finally a series of variant and block identifiers clarify the exact configuration of the vehicle.

The name is a matter of less specific construction, but is aimed at providing an official common name which eases identification and communication regarding the vehicle. The common name is not used in internal publications (an official internal report would refer to the "F-16" and "AIM-9" but not mention the names "Fighting Falcon" or "Sidewinder"). Pilots often have their own nicknames for their aircraft which may bear only coincidental resemblance (if that) to the official common name, although some pilot nicknames are similar or even derived from the official common name (such as "Bug" and "Super Bug" for the [[F/A-18 Hornet]] and [[F/A-18E/F Super Hornet]]).

The current regulations and procedures relating to employing this system are laid out in DoD and branch documents, including Air Force Joint Instruction 16-401 [https://web.archive.org/web/20041114082719/http://www.dtic.mil/whs/directives/corres/pdf/412015l_0504/p412015l.pdf], and are not classified. These regulations replaced the previous regulations which were originally introduced in 1962 (See [[1962 United States Tri-Service aircraft designation system]]).

=== Components ===
There are 10 potential components of a system's designation, comprising the three basic parts of the designation.
;Status Prefix: Optional prefix to denote vehicles with unique status, such as non-flying or experimental.

;Modified Mission: Optional additional mission identifier which clarifies or notes modification of the basic mission.

;Launch Environment: Identifies method of launch for missiles and rockets.

;Mission: The most basic component of the initial part of the designation, identifies the basic design mission of the craft.

;Vehicle Type: Identifies non-standard vehicle types.

;Design Number: Serial number assigned to each design of the same mission type, with a dash separating the mission and number.

;Series: A letter suffix to indicate which series within a design the vehicle belongs to.

;Configuration Number: For missiles and rockets, an identifier to designate specific changes in missile configuration.

;Block: For aircraft, a defined configuration within a series or design.

;Serial Number: Individual examples have a serial number to identify them.

==== Status prefix ====
Status prefix is an optional prefix not often used for vehicles in regular service. If used, it is the first letter in the MDS. Authorized current status prefixes are:
;C: Captive. Only used for rockets and missiles, '''C''' applies to missiles designed to be carried in their launch environment but are incapable of actual launch.

;D: Dummy. Only used for rockets and missiles which are non-flying, primarily for ground training.

;G: Grounded. Applied to aircraft which are permanently grounded, most often used for ground training of crews and support. This is only applied as a permanent designation. Use is rare.

;J: Temporary Special Test. Applied to craft involved with special testing of temporarily installed equipment. The '''J''' Prefix is used for aircraft that can be reasonably returned to their original configuration following tests. An example is aircraft used as testbeds for new electronics, but which will or may not retain that equipment after tests are complete.

;N: Permanent Special Test. Applied to craft involved with special testing on a permanent basis, with modifications to their configuration that make return to original configuration impractical. Many military aircraft transferred to NASA for aeronautical research carry this designation.

;X: Experimental. Applied to craft which are not yet accepted for service, or to prototypes for which standard configuration has not been finalized. Most prototypes of the past carried this prefix, but it should not be confused with craft given an '''X''' basic mission symbol. The '''X''' status prefix is for designs for other missions, but at an experimental stage of the design process.

;Y: Prototype. Originally applied to demonstration craft where configuration had been determined, but from the 1970s on applied to all prototypes of aircraft intended for production.

;Z: Planning. Applied to designs in the planning/pre-development phase.

==== Modified mission symbols ====
Many craft have been designed for more specific missions than their basic mission symbol would indicate, and many design series have been designed for different missions than the original design, and may or may not still maintain capability for the original mission. The modified mission symbol provides the services the ability to accurately indicate a craft's mission without losing commonality with the basic design MDS. If utilized, the modified mission symbol is placed directly in front of the basic mission symbol. Modified mission symbols are not used for rockets and missiles. Currently authorized modified mission symbols are:

;A: Attack. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''A''' applies to aircraft modified to attack land or sea targets. Example is the '''A'''C-130U ''Spectre'', a transport modified for ground attack missions.

;C: Cargo. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''C''' applies to aircraft modified to carry cargo and passengers.

;D: Director. Applies to aircraft modified to control unmanned aerial vehicles such as drones.

;E: Electronics. Applies to aircraft modified with addition of extensive electronic equipment, either for enhancement of their basic mission, or as a platform for specifically electronic missions such as providing [[electronic countermeasures]] (ECM), [[airborne early warning]] (AEW), [[airborne command and control]] (ACC), or communications relay. Example is the [[Lockheed EP-3|'''E'''P-3A ''Orion'']], a patrol aircraft outfitted with special electronics to collect electronic data.

;F: Fighter. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''F''' applies to aircraft modified to engage in air combat. Used on many American fightercraft.

;H: Search and Rescue. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''H''' applies to aircraft modified to assist [[search and rescue]] (SAR) operations. Example is the HU-25 Guardian, a utility transport modified for Coast Guard search and rescue coordination.

;K: Tanker. Applies to aircraft modified to carry and transfer aviation fuel in flight to other aircraft. Example is the KA-6D ''Intruder'', an attack aircraft modified with tanks and hoses to provide [[aerial refueling]].

;L: Cold Weather. Applies to aircraft modified to operate in Arctic or Antarctic environments. Example is the LC-130, a transport modified to deliver logistics support to Antarctic stations.

;M: Multi-Mission. Applies to aircraft modified to perform various missions, in particular [[special operations]] modifications. Also used as a catch all for missions that neither fit in any category, nor warrant their own.

;O: Observation. Applies to aircraft modified to perform observation of enemy or potential enemy positions, and patrol borders or areas of potential infiltration. Example is the OA-10A, an attack aircraft modified to provide observation of enemy territory.

;P: Patrol. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''P''' applies to aircraft modified to perform [[maritime patrol]].

;Q: Drone. Applies to craft modified to operate unmanned, under control of ground or air directors or autonomously. Example is the '''Q'''F-106 ''Delta Dart'', a fighter modified to fly under remote control as a target for missile testing.

;R: Reconnaissance. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''R''' applies to aircraft modified to perform [[air reconnaissance]] of enemy forces, territory, and facilities. Example is the '''R'''F-5E ''Tiger II'', a fighter with added reconnaissance cameras and equipment for photographing enemy positions.

;S: Anti-Submarine. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''S''' applies to aircraft modified to search for, locate, and attack enemy submarines.

;T: Training. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''T''' applies to aircraft modified for use as trainers, both initial and operational. Examples are two-seat operational training versions of single-seat aircraft, such as the '''T'''A-4J and '''T'''F-102. Fully combat-capable two-seaters are usually simply assigned a new series letter.

;U: Utility. Similar to the basic mission symbol, '''U''' applies to aircraft modified to allow use as utility and base support aircraft. Example is the '''U'''P-3 ''Orion'', a patrol plane modified for transportation of staff, mail, and operations in support of bases and installations.

;V: Staff/VIP. Applied to aircraft modified for transport of staff and ranking personnel with furnishment of comfortable accommodations. Example is the '''V'''C-25, a 747 modified to serve as the Presidential transport, or '''[[Air Force One]]'''.

;W: Weather. Applied to aircraft modified for weather monitoring and air sampling. Example is the '''W'''C-135, a transport modified with special equipment for air sampling. The '''W''' designation covers air sampling to detect nuclear, biological, and chemical contamination, and for intelligence gathering on foreign nuclear testing.

==== Basic mission symbol ====
The basic mission symbol is the heart of the mission part of the designation. No designation is without it, and some designations consist of only a basic mission symbol for the mission part, such as the [[F-14]] or [[C-130]]. The following are the officially authorized basic mission symbols:

;A: Attack. Attack craft are designed to directly attack enemy land or sea&lt;ref name=16-401-I&gt;{{cite book|title=DESIGNATING AND NAMING DEFENSE MILITARY AEROSPACE VEHICLES|publisher=United States Department of the Air Force|url=http://www.af.mil/shared/media/epubs/AFI16-401%28I%29.pdf|accessdate=29 January 2011|date=14 April 2005|quote=Attack: Aircraft designed to find, attack, and destroy land or sea targets.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  targets, interdict enemy movements and support, and strike precision targets. Examples are the '''A-6''' ''Intruder'' and '''A-10''' ''Thunderbolt II''.

;B: Bomber. Bombers are designed to attack strategic and tactical targets with heavy bomb loads and missiles. They carry heavy loads of free-fall and stand-off weaponry. Examples are the '''B-52''' ''Stratofortress'' and '''B-2A''' ''Spirit''.

;C: Cargo. Transports are designed to carry cargo and passengers to provide tactical logistical support and strategic mobility to other forces. Examples are the '''C-2''' ''Greyhound'' and '''C-130''' ''Hercules''.

;E: Electronic. Electronics craft are designed explicitly to fulfill electronic specialty missions such as ECM, ACC, AEW, and communications. Examples are the '''E-2''' ''Hawkeye'' and '''E-3''' ''Sentry''.

;F: Fighter. Fighters are designed to intercept and engage enemy aircraft and missiles. It is also a catch-all for multi-mission aircraft, even if it is primarily designed for ground-attack purpose.&lt;ref name=16-401-I /&gt; Examples are the '''F-22''' ''Raptor'' and '''F-16''' ''Fighting Falcon''.

;AL: Airborne Laser. Laser craft are those who are primarily designed to employ laser weaponry against air and ground targets. This is a very new designation, and only applies to the '''AL-1''' ABL program.

;O: Observation. Observation craft are designed to maintain observation over land, primarily territory either held by enemy forces or susceptible to infiltration. Unlike reconnaissance craft, they loiter over area providing observation over time. Examples are the '''O-1''' ''Bird Dog'' and '''OV-10''' ''Bronco''.

;P: Patrol. Patrol craft are designed for maritime reconnaissance missions, including anti-submarine warfare. Example is the '''P-3''' ''Orion''.

;Q: [[Unmanned Aerial Vehicle]]s (UAV). Examples are the [[MQ-1 Predator]] and [[MQ-8 Fire Scout]].

;R: Reconnaissance: Reconnaissance craft are designed to conduct reconnaissance through photographic and electrical means. Example [[SR-71|S'''R'''-71]], special or strategic reconnaissance

;S: Anti-submarine:  [[Anti-submarine warfare]] (ASW) craft are designed to locate and attack enemy submarines. Example is the '''S-3''' ''Viking''.

;T: Trainer: Trainers are aircraft used to train aircrews. Examples are the '''[[T-6 Texan II]]''' and '''[[T-45 Goshawk]]'''.

;U: Utility: Utility craft are utilized for miscellaneous missions and base support. Example, reconnaissance jet, but for [[disinformation]] named '''U''' [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]]

;X: Research: Research craft are designed for experimental and developmental research programs. Unlike the '''X''' mission modifier, the '''X''' basic mission symbol is used for craft solely designed for this purpose, with no operational mission intended or feasible. Examples are the entire series of '''[[X-plane]]s''' from the Bell '''X-1''' on.

==== Vehicle type symbols ====
For non-standard vehicle types (vehicles other than piloted, fixed-wing and self-propelled aircraft which are wholly supported by [[aerodynamic lift]] from liftoff to touchdown), a final symbol is added after the basic mission symbol to identify the vehicle type. Current applicable symbols are as follow:

;G: Glider. A [[Military glider|glider]] is a fixed-wing aircraft designed to use air currents for normal lift, although it may have an engine.

;H: Helicopter. A [[helicopter]] is any rotary-wing aircraft.

;Q: Unmanned. An [[unmanned aerial vehicle]] (UAV) is any aircraft without capacity for a human pilot, but not merely a missile or rocket.

;S: Spaceplane. A spaceplane is a vehicle designed to fly beyond earth's atmosphere and return. This vehicle code was poorly chosen, as it conflicts with the mission code S (Anti-Submarine Warfare).  "ES" could equally designate a spaceplane designed specifically for electronic warfare or an anti-submarine plane modified for that purpose.

;V: V/STOL. A [[Vertical/Short Takeoff and Landing|Vertical and/or Short Takeoff and Landing]] aircraft is designed to take-off and land vertically, but not rely on rotary-wing lift for flight. This includes [[vectored thrust]] aircraft such as the [[AV-8 Harrier]] and [[tiltrotor]]s such as the [[V-22 Osprey]]. It also applies to aircraft of the normal fixed-wing configuration that are capable of taking off and landing in a short runway space, such as the [[OV-10 Bronco]].

;Z: Lighter than air. A lighter than air craft is designed to remain aloft through buoyancy of lighter than air gases. Such craft include blimps and balloons.

==Rockets/missiles==

=== Rocket/missile launch environment ===

All rockets and missiles contain a symbol to indicate the launch method, be it from the air, ground, sea, etc. The following are the currently authorized symbols for launch environments. These are not used for other aerospace vehicles.

;A: Air-launched. The missile is launched from an airborne vehicle. Example is the [[AIM-9 Sidewinder|AIM-9 ''Sidewinder'']] [[dogfight]]ing missile.

;B: Multiple. The missile can be launched from various environments. The [[BGM-109 Tomahawk|BGM-109 ''Tomahawk'']], for instance, can launch from a ground unit, aircraft, or ship-mounted launcher.

;C: Coffin. Stored in an unhardened horizontal container (less than 45 degree angle) at ground level and either launched horizontally or raised vertical for launch. Coffin launchers may be either on land or at sea. For an example, see the early versions of the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas]] [[ICBM]].

;F: Individual. The missile is launched by an individual soldier in the field, otherwise referred to as man-portable. Example is the [[FIM-92]] ''Stinger'', a light man-portable [[surface-to-air missile]] (SAM).

;G: Ground. The missile is launched directly from the ground surface, including runways.

;H: Silo-Stored. The missile stored vertically in a silo but raised to ground level for launch. An example is the [[SM-65 Atlas|Atlas-F]].

;L: Silo-Launched. The missile is launched from its storage silo, buried in the ground.

;M: Mobile. The missile is launched from a mobile ground vehicle.

;P: Pad. Like a traditional space rocket, the missile is stored and launched from an unprotected ground facility.

;R: Ship. The missile is launched from a ship or barge.

;S: Space. The missile is launched from a spacecraft. This is so far used only for the upper stage of another rocket like the SSB-8 [[Centaur (rocket stage)|Centaur]].

;U: Underwater. The missile is launched from a submarine or underwater device.

=== Rocket/missile mission symbol ===

Rockets and missiles are assigned a single mission symbol, which usually denotes the intended target type of the missile. For most types of missile, the combination of launch environment and mission symbols form a from-to combination (surface-to-air, ship-to-submarine) that gives one a good idea of the potential uses for the missile.

;C: Transport. Applies to vehicles designed to carry cargo and deliver it to a location. This can also be used to designate a carrier for electronics or weapons systems.

;D: Decoy. Applies to vehicles that function as decoys for defeating enemy anti-aircraft and anti-missile defenses.

;E: Electronics. Applies to vehicles that carry out electronic missions such as communications or countermeasures.

;G: Ground. Applies to vehicles designed to attack surface targets, including vehicles.

;I: Intercept. Applies to vehicles designed to attack aerial targets, including both aircraft and missiles.

;L: Launch detection. Applies to vehicles designed to detect launch of missiles and track and identify enemy aircraft and missiles. This also applies to detection and monitoring of space launches and re-entry.

;M: Scientific. Applies to vehicles designed to collect scientific data.

;N: Navigation. Applies to navigational assistance designs.

;Q: Drone. Applies to a vehicle designed to be remotely controlled.

;S: Space support. Applies to vehicles designed to support space programs and activities.

;T: Training. Applies to training designs.

;U: Underwater. Applies to vehicles designed to attack submarines and underwater targets.

;W: Weather. Applies to vehicles designed to obtain weather data and collect aerial samples.

=== Vehicle type symbol ===

For rockets and missiles, the vehicle type symbol identifies the basic vehicle type and will be the final symbol in the mission part of the MDS.

;B: Booster. [[Booster (rocketry)|Booster]]s are primary or auxiliary propulsion units for other vehicles.

;M: Missile. [[Guided missile]]s are unmanned vehicles flying a path controlled by a guidance system.

;N: Probe. [[Space probe|Probe]]s are non-orbital unmanned vehicles designed primarily to collect data within the aerospace environment.

;R: Rocket. [[Rocket]]s are single-use unmanned vehicles without guidance after launch.

;S: Satellite. [[Satellite]]s are space vehicles which orbit the earth.

==Exceptions==
* The [[F/A-18 Hornet]] uses an unofficial designation to highlight the fact that its multi-role capabilities were built in from the earliest stages (as opposed to a hypothetical AF-18: a fighter modified for the attack role), however other comparable aircraft, such as the F-16 and later F-15s do not seem to have even gained a modified mission A, instead remaining with their F designation. This is the case even with the [[F-15E Strike Eagle]], an F-15 variant used primarily in the attack role. It should also be noted that the system specifically forbids the use of slashes and other characters, and the Hornet is referred to in official documentation as the FA-18, which implies an attack aircraft modified for the fighter role. The [[F-22 Raptor]] was designated "F/A-22" for two years from 2003-2005 before being redesignated F-22 immediately before being transitioned to active service status. A strike version of the F-22 was mooted with the designation [[Lockheed Martin FB-22|FB-22]].&lt;ref name=CRS_report&gt;[http://opencrs.com/document/RS21848/ RS21848, "Air Force FB-22 Bomber Concept"]. CRS, 5 June 2006. Retrieved: 25 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[F-117 Nighthawk]] has no practical air-to-air capability because several treaties the U.S. signed place restrictions on the addition of new bombers into its military inventory. 
* Although the mission letters of the [[AV-8 Harrier]]'s designation are correct, the series number is not. The [[Ryan XV-8]] ("Fleep") had already existed, so the V designation should have been AV-14.
* The original designation of the [[SR-71 Blackbird]], RS-71 was specifically allowed for in the original system, standing for Reconnaissance and Surveillance - or, it is sometimes said, Reconnaissance and Strike. USAF Chief of Staff [[Curtis LeMay]] simply liked the sound of SR-71 better that RS-71, and had the speech changed. The SR was explained as Strategic Reconnaissance.
* The [[Boeing 747]] has three different designations in U.S. service - [[Boeing E-4|E-4]], [[Boeing VC-25|(V)C-25]] and [[Boeing YAL-1|AL-1]] - something which violates the basic purpose of the system.
* The CC-130J Hercules referred to the stretched C-130J-30 Hercules. The -30 suffix was not supportable in the system, so a modified mission letter had to be added. Hence, the CC-130J is a cargo aircraft "modified" for the cargo role. This was later dropped. The CC-130J should not be confused with the CC-130 Hercules operated by the Royal Canadian Air Force. The first "C" identifies the aircraft as a Canadian asset. Canada later acquired C-130Js as ''CC-130Js''.
* Many manufacturers have used non-standard modifiers for commercial purposes; for instance, the Spanish F/A-18 Hornets were 'designated' EF-18 by [[McDonnell Douglas]] (the E standing for "''[[Spain|España]]''"), and [[AH-64D Apache]] helicopters were designated [[WAH-64]] by [[Licence-built|licensed manufacturer]] [[Westland Helicopters|Westland]]. Non-standard series letters, especially ones the U.S. Air Force has no intention of progressing to, are often used to designate the intended country of use, such as I (Israel - e.g. F-15I), J (Japan), K (South Korea or United Kingdom), S (Saudi Arabia) and SG (Singapore).

{{italic title}}
'''''Walkabout''''' was an Australian illustrated magazine published from 1934 to 1974 combining cultural, geographic, and scientific content with travel literature.&lt;ref&gt;"NEW TRAVEL MAGAZINE." "Walkabout", a new monthly travel magazine, which will present the story of Australia beyond the cities, the South Sea Islands, and New Zealand, is being produced by the Australian National Travel Association, an organisation established five years ago, with the support of Governments and private enterprise, to make Australia's attractions known throughout the world. Containing 68 pages, the various issues of ''Walkabout'' will contain colourful articles by well-known writers. Pictures will be a feature of the new publication. In an explanatory note the publishers state:-"The title adopted for the magazine has an 'age-old' background and signifies a racial characteristic of the Australian aboriginal, who is always on the move. And so,month by month, ''Walkabout'' will take its readers on a great 'walkabout' through the fascinating world below the equator." {{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article17116806 |title=NEW TRAVEL MAGAZINE. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]] |date=30 October 1934 |accessdate=15 February 2013 |page=6 |publisher=National Library of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initially a travel magazine, in its forty-year run it featured a popular&lt;ref&gt;"It was immediately successful, with its initial print run of 20,000 copies increasing to 22,000 within three months, and reaching 30,000 by 1949."

''Southern Review'' (Adelaide), v.32, no.1, 1999: 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; mix of articles by travellers, officials, residents, journalists, naturalists, anthropologists and novelists, illustrated by Australian [[photojournalist]]s. Its title derived from the supposed ‘racial characteristic of the Australian aboriginal who is always on the move"[http://www.qhatlas.com.au/content/walkabout].

== History ==

[[File:Walkabout-October-1965.jpg|thumb|left|During the 1960s, the magazine and masthead were given a more contemporary design, with the slogan "Australia's Way of Life Magazine"]] Ostensibly and initially a travel and geographic magazine published by the [[Australian National Travel Association]] (formed in 1929),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hogben, Paul, (editor.) | author2=O'Callaghan, Judith, 1954-, (editor.) | title=Leisure space : the transformation of Sydney, 1945-1970 | publication-date=2014 | publisher=Sydney NewSouth Publishing | page=36 | isbn=978-1-74223-382-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Walkabout : Australia and the South Seas'' was named by ANTA director Charles Holmes. In its first issue of 1 Nov 1934,&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Glen. The fantastic face of the continent: the Australian Geographical Walkabout magazine. ''Southern Review'' (Adelaide), v.32, no.1, 1999: 27-41.&lt;/ref&gt; the editorial, signed by [[Charles Lloyd Jones|Charles (Chas) Lloyd Jones]], chair of the board of [[David Jones Limited|David Jones]] and acting chairman of the Australian National Travel Association (ANTA),  proclaimed its aim to educate its readers;
{{quote|[I]n publishing ‘Walkabout’, we have embarked on an educational crusade which will enable Australians and the people of other lands to learn more of the romantic Australia that exists beyond the cities and the enchanted South Sea Islands and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, Walkabout, November 1934, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The income the Association derived from magazine sales provided for its other activities in promoting tourism, 'to place Australia on the world's travel map and keep it there.'&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nla.gov.au/exhibitions/sun/anta.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was assertively Australian&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Citation | author1=Rolls, Mitchell | author2=Johnston, Anna, 1972-, (co-author.) | title=Travelling home, Walkabout magazine and mid-twentieth-century Australia | publication-date=2016 | publisher=London, UK New York, NY Anthem Press, an imprint of Wimbledon Publishing Company | isbn=978-1-78308-537-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  in its ethos but took cues from other popular magazines of the period, such as the United States' ''[[National Geographic Magazine]],'' and ''[[Life (magazine)|LIFE]].''

From August 1946, ''Walkabout'' also doubled as the official journal of the newly formed [[Australian Geographical Society]] (AGS), founded with a ₤5,000 grant from ANTA, its banner subscript  reading 'Journal of the Australian Geographical Society'. This role is now filled by ''[[Australian Geographic]]'' magazine.  Later it became ‘Australia's Way of Life Magazine’ when supported by the Australian National Publicity Association and later the [[Tourism Australia|Australian Tourist Commission]].

== Editorship ==
Charles Holmes was Walkabout’s founding managing editor, retiring in August 1957. From June 1936 he was paid £250 p.a. and C. S. Weetman was appointed associate editor at £100, with their allowances coming from the magazine's income and being conditional on its profitability. Basil Atkinson was editor until January 1960; then Graham Tucker followed by film critic and photojournalist Brian McArdle (1920-1968) from January 1961. In the following financial year subscribers to Walkabout came from 91 different countries. Under a new banner 'Australia's Way of Life Magazine' (after November 1961), modern dynamic layouts in a larger format (27 x 33&amp;nbsp;cm) and more lively captioning saw a brief peak in circulation to 50,000 in 1967 in response to more liberal human-interest and cultural content. McArdle consciously emulated the American ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine (1936-1972) and the French [[Réalités (French magazine)|''Réalités'']] (1946-1979). In the 1960s the magazine spawned a number of book-length illustrated anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;A. T. Bolton, editor (1968) ''Walkabout's Australia : an anthology of articles and photographs from Walkabout magazine''. Sydney : Ure Smith in association with the Australian National Travel Association, – Walkabout pocketbooks&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Farwell, G., Brian McArdle [ed.] (1968) ''Around Australia on Highway One''. Melbourne, Vic. : Thomas Nelson (Australia)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Tennison, P., McArdle, J.B. (196?) ''Walkabout presents the Australian scene''. Melbourne: Walkabout.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McArdle, B. &amp; Fenton, P.  (1968) ''Australian Walkabout''. Melbourne : Lansdowne Press.&lt;/ref&gt; After McArdle's illness and death, John Ross took on the editorship in December 1969 with various others filling the role, and the magazine format was reduced to 20 x 27.5&amp;nbsp;cm until it ceased publication in 1974.

Western Australian writer Henrietta Drake-Brockman originated the ‘Our Authors’ Page’,&lt;ref&gt;Editor, ‘Acknowledgment’, Walkabout, August 1950, 37.&lt;/ref&gt; a full-page feature on a leading writer, which was given a leading position in each issue opposite the table of contents between 1950 and 1953.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

A book review column ran almost continuously from 1953—1971 under the byline ‘Scrutarius’ (who was journalist H. C. (Peter) Fenton), totalling almost 200 columns and which reviewed usually four books per issue. The magazine thus provided a showcase of diverse Australian literature to a mostly 'middlebrow' audience that was otherwise ill-served by other periodicals and newspapers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Photojournalism ==

ANTA recognised that the magazine it intended to publish would only be successful if it were well illustrated. Its 16th board meeting, held in Sydney in May 1934, passed a motion to employ a staff photographer for the purposes of improving "the quality of 'arresting pictures' that were being forwarded to overseas papers and magazines". Roy Dunstan, a Victorian Railways employee who was possibly known to the first editor Holmes, since both worked for the railways,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was appointed on a salary of £9 per week with all expenses paid, increased to £10 per week from 1 September 1938.&lt;ref&gt;ANTA Board Minutes, Sydney, 8 August 1939; ANTA Board Minutes, Canberra, 11 October 1938&lt;/ref&gt;

''Walkabout'' became an outlet for, and promoter of, Australian photojournalism. Stories were liberally illustrated each with up to fifteen quarter-, half- and full-page photographs in black and white, and from the 1960s, sepia and colour photographs. (Walkabout also sponsored a national artistic and aesthetic photography competition in 1957 with a One Hundred Pound first prize). The original photography segment was later called  "Our Cameraman's Walkabout",  "Australia and the South Pacific in Pictures" (briefly including New Zealand in the title), "Australia in Pictures", "Camera Supplement" and after 1961,  "Australian Scene". It began with as many as 23 photographs spread over 6-8 pages, but dropped to 6-10 photographs in the 1960s. The segment was often devoted to a single topic and in the 1960s to single-topic double-page spreads.

Significant Australian photographers included in its pages were;

== Representation of indigenous Australians ==
[[File:Cover of Walkabout magazine 1935.jpg|thumb|A photograph of Gwoya Jungarai, known as One Pound Jimmy, by ''Walkabout'' staff photographer Roy Dunstan, cropped from his original full-length portrait.|left]]The cover of the first issue of ''Walkabout''  featured a silhouette of an Aboriginal man taken (on [[Palm Island, Queensland|Palm Island]]) by German-born British photographer [[E. O. Hoppé|Emil Otto Hoppé]] (1878–1972) who in 1930 was commissioned to document  Australia’s ‘true spirit’ and toured extensively throughout the country, including Tasmania.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Hoppé, E. O. (Emil Otto) | title=The fifth continent | publication-date=1931 | publisher=Simpkin Marshall | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8465539}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise, the first edition includes no articles specifically on Aborigines but in accounting for the magazine’s name, it connected the magazine with an Aboriginal heritage:

{{quote|The title has an ‘age-old’ background and signifies a racial characteristic of the Australian aboriginal who is always on the move.

''Walkabout''{{'}}s early to mid-century stance on depiction of Indigenous Australians was generally conservative, patronising, romantic, often racist and stereotyped,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Russell, Lynette | title=Going Walkabout in the 1950's: images of 'traditional' Aboriginal Australia [in Walkabout magazine.] | journal=Bulletin (Olive Pink Society) | publication-date=1994 | volume=6 | issue=1 | pages=4–8 | issn=1037-0730 }}&lt;/ref&gt; though mixed with some informed commentary and genuine concern (misguided and otherwise),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; in a reflection of the then prevailing national attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;For a full discussion see: Rolls, Mitchell (2009): Picture imperfect: re-reading imagery of Aborigines in ''Walkabout'', ''[[Journal of Australian Studies]]'', (33:1): 19-35&lt;/ref&gt; Most issues were inclusive of Aborigines in photo spreads, more typically of Aborigines in so-called traditional poses or settings.

An instance ([http://epress.anu.edu.au/aborig_history/transgressions/html/ch05s05.html see: "The Language of Tourism"]) was Roy Dunstan's full-length portrait entitled "Jimmy" of 1935, standing heroically with a spear and gazing to the distance. 'Jimmy' was [[Gwoya Jungarai]], a Walbiri man, but when his image, cropped to head and shoulders,&lt;ref&gt;The cropped print, marked as originating from the files of the ANTA, publisher of ''Walkabout'', is held by the [http://acms.sl.nsw.gov.au/item/itemDetailPaged.aspx?itemID=449072 National Library of Australia]. In the online catalogue, annotations on the back of the print are transcribed; :
"Australian aborigines in some of the remote areas of the Interior still live after the fashion of the Stone Age. They hunt their food with spear, stone axe and wear no clothes of any description."; typescript on the reverse, ca. 1941&lt;/ref&gt; appeared on the 1950 Australian stamp it was captioned just 'Aborigine'. Though belatedly named in an editorial essay, the deprecating moniker 'One Pound Jimmy' stuck.&lt;ref&gt;See: McGuire, M.E. "Whiteman's Walkabout" [online]. ''Meanjin'', Vol. 52, No. 3, Spring 1993: 517-525&lt;/ref&gt;

However stereotyped or cursory such inclusions might have been,&lt;ref&gt;Lynette Russell, ‘Going Walkabout in the 1950’s: Images of “Traditional” Aboriginal Australia’, The Olive Pink Society Bulletin 6, no. 1 (1994): 4–8&lt;/ref&gt; they did promote an understanding of an enduring and significant Aboriginal presence, and of a rich cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchell Rolls, ‘Picture Imperfect: Re-reading Imagery of Aborigines in Walkabout’, Journal of Australian Studies 33, no. 1 (2009): 19–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Specialist essays, written for a general audience, covered topics including: [[Indigenous Australian art|Aboriginal art]]; [[Aboriginal tracker|black trackers]]; the peoples of the [[Torres Strait Islands]] and [[Groote Eylandt]]; [[Missionary|missions]]; Aboriginal bird and place [[Australian Aboriginal languages|names]]; Aboriginal weapons and tools; poetry and ritual; the skills and division of labour in fishing, hunting and gathering activities; foodstuffs; Aboriginal pastoral workers; and sea craft.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Ion Idriess, Mary Durack and Ernestine Hill in their frequent writings for the magazine present complex and ambivalent attitudes to the indigenous. Despite their  familiarity with Aborigines, they saw them as ‘vanishing’&lt;ref&gt;Mary Durack, ‘The Vanishing Australian’, Walkabout, August 1945, 31.&lt;/ref&gt; due to unexplained causes and agencies of which even Aborigines themselves were ignorant, and an insufficient birth rate to sustain their population, explained as an instinctual ‘racial suicide’.

Conversely, regular contributor Bill Harney, cattleman, former patrol officer and protector of Aborigines and father of  [[Wardaman people|Wardaman]] elder [[Bill Yidumduma Harney]], penned sixteen articles over 1947–57 presenting an experienced and sympathetic view of the Aboriginal peoples of Australia’s [[Northern Territory]] alongside whom he worked and lived.

Anthropologists [[Ronald Berndt]]&lt;ref&gt;R. M. Berndt, ‘Aborigines of the Great Western Desert’, Walkabout, December 1940,40–42.&lt;/ref&gt; and Frederick McCarthy&lt;ref&gt;F. D. McCarthy, ‘Utensils of the Australian Aborigine’, Walkabout, August 1957,36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. D. McCarthy, ‘Australian Aboriginal Basket-Makers’, Walkabout, September 1957, 36–37.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. D. McCarthy, ‘Island Art Galleries’, Walkabout, February 1964, 38–40.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;F. D. McCarthy, ‘The Rock Engravings of Depuch Island, North-West Australia’, Records of the Australian Museum 25 (1961): 121–48.&lt;/ref&gt; contributed learned articles, mostly on cultural artefacts. [[Ursula McConnel]]'s three articles, all in successive issues during 1936 and drawn from fieldwork she had undertaken in Cape York from 1927 to 1934, provided particular insights into the impact on Aborigines experiencing the transition from traditional practices to mission life,&lt;ref&gt;Ursula H. McConnel, ‘Cape York Peninsula: (1) the Civilised Foreground’, Walkabout, June 1936, 16–19; Ursula H. McConnel, ‘Cape York Peninsula: The Primitive Playgound’, Walkabout, July 1936, 10–15; Ursula H. McConnel, ‘Cape York Peninsula: Development and Control’, Walkabout, August 1936, 36–40&lt;/ref&gt; frankly identifying ideological failures of policy by the missions' and government administrations and advancing several remedies to the damage she saw being caused to Aboriginal lives and cultures by 'civilisation'.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Early articles by anthropologist [[Donald Thomson]] were based on his fieldwork in Cape York, northeast Arnhem Land and the Great Sandy Desert,&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. Thomson, ‘Across Cape York Peninsula with a Pack Team: A Thousand- Mile Trek in Search of Unknown Native Tribes’, Walkabout, December 1934, 21–31&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1949 he also contributed a series of ‘Nature Diaries’ on Australian flora and fauna, but he also expressed passionate advocacy for Aborigines out of his frustration with how Aborigines were treated and general contempt for them as little but savages, and his sympathy and deep respect for them and their cultures,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; writing that he ‘felt that [he] had more in common with these splendid and virile natives than with my own people’.&lt;ref&gt;Donald F. Thomson, ‘The Story of Arnhem Land’, Walkabout, August 1946, 4–22&lt;/ref&gt;

The magazine reviewed more enlightened literature as early as 1952, including poet [[Roland Robinson (poet)|Roland Robinson]]’s studies of traditional Aboriginal knowledge ''Legend and Dreaming as related to Roland Robinson by Men of the Djauan, Rimberunga, Mungarai-Ngalarkan and Yungmun Tribes of Arnhem Land (1952, with a foreword by A. P. Elkin)''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Robinson, Roland | title=Legend &amp; dreaming : legends of the dream-time of the Australian Aborigines as related to Roland Robinson by men of the Djauan, Rimberunga, Mungarai-Ngalarkan and Yungmun tribes of Arnhem Land | publication-date=1952 | publisher=Edwards &amp; Shaw | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/8469562 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and children’s literature dealing with indigenous subjects, such as Rex Ingamells’s ''Aranda Boy'' (1952),&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Ingamells, Rex | author2=Leong Pak Hong, (illustrator.) | title=Aranda boy : an aboriginal story | publication-date=1952 | publisher=Longmans Green | url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/work/16360835}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter being praised for its readability and its politics in showing "that the Australian aboriginal is not merely a 'native'.”. In the column 'Our Authors' James Devaney’s popular historical novel ''The Vanished Tribes'' (1929), is described as ‘the first really successful treatment in creative prose of our Aboriginal theme, but it is as vitally human and beautifully written a book as we possess’.&lt;ref&gt;Rex Ingamells, ‘Our Authors’ Page: James Devaney’, Walkabout, February 1952, 8–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the sixties outrage in the Australian community at the injustice of apartheid in South Africa and consciousness of other [[civil rights movements|social movements for civil rights]] changed attitudes&lt;ref&gt;"Many changes in Aborigines' rights and treatment followed, including at long last full voting rights. The government gave the Commonwealth vote to all Aborigines in 1962. Western Australia gave them State votes in the same year. Queensland followed in 1965. With that, all Aborigines had full and equal rights. In 1971 the Liberal Party nominated Neville Bonner to fill a vacant seat in the Senate. He was the first Aborigine to sit in any Australian Parliament."[http://www.aec.gov.au/voting/indigenous_vote/aborigin.htm Australian Electoral Commission "Indigenous Australians and the vote" retrieved 15 Feb 2013]&lt;/ref&gt; to the indigenous population and eased the passing of the [[Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals)|1967 Referendum]] which was to override prejudicial state laws and open the way to advances in [[Aboriginal land rights in Australia|land rights]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|alrta1976444|Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|nta1993147|Native Title Act 1993}}.&lt;/ref&gt; discriminatory practices,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|act|rda1975202|Racial Discrimination Act 1975}}.&lt;/ref&gt; financial assistance,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|sgaa1972991972368|States Grants (Aboriginal Advancement) Act 1972}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Loans Act"&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|alca1974274|Aboriginal Loans Commission Act 1974}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and preservation of cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Cth|num_act|aatsihpa1984630|Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage (Interim Protection) Act 1984}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the complexities of the Referendum, it received scant, and belated, mention in Walkabout in 1967.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However, articles from this period more even-handedly acknowledged the colonial massacres &lt;ref&gt;Murphy, J.E. 'The Massacre at Cullin-La-Ringo' ''Walkabout'' June 1966, p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; alongside more sympathetic, though still somewhat patronising, stories on the remote desert tribes,&lt;ref&gt;Rose, R. 'Man of the Desert' ''Walkabout'', July 1966, p.20-21&lt;/ref&gt; and more in-depth and academic discussion of the complex issues of alcohol and indigenous employment appeared,&lt;ref&gt;Graham, D. The 'Aborigine and the Future' ''Walkabout'' January 1968, p. 32-34&lt;/ref&gt; though much ink was devoted to debate over whether 'aborigine', 'Aborigine, or 'aboriginal' were correct English usage.&lt;ref&gt;J. W. Davidson, ‘Aborigine and Aboriginal’, Walkabout, July 1964, 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S. A. Luck, ‘We Stick to Aborigine’, Walkabout, January 1965, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. H. Chisholm, ‘Aborigine or Aboriginal’, Walkabout, April 1965, 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Jago, ‘Capital Aborigines’, Walkabout, July 1968, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about ''Walkabout''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s treatment of Australian indigenous people in their 2016 text,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Mitchell Rolls and Anna Johnston conclude;
{{quote|...it is in the manifest tensions between and within the various articles discussing Aborigines and their affairs, and those overtly critical of Aboriginal policy, that Walkabout’s contribution to Aboriginal representation and issues is best found. It is here where one finds the grist for a better and more empathic understanding of these contested and complex issues. In this way[...] Walkabout was doing ‘something immensely valuable’.}}

== Cessation ==
In the 1970s, despite claiming to be 'The New Walkabout',&lt;ref&gt;Editorial, Walkabout, August 1971, 5.&lt;/ref&gt; the magazine was floundering, frequently changing its subtitle and editorship and in 1971 ANTA substantially increased its cover price from 40 cents to 50 cents a copy (a rise from $4.29 to $5.36 in [https://www.rba.gov.au/calculator/annualDecimal.html 2017 values]), but failed to turn a profit. In accounting for its demise, University of Queensland's Dr. Max Quanchi writes '...it finally struggled against mass circulation weekly and lifestyle magazines in the early 1970s...'. In fact, Walkabout outlived ''LIFE'' by two years, with both magazines, amongst many others, succumbing to increasing publication costs, decreasing subscriptions, and to competition from other media and newspaper supplements.

[[File:Pieter Janssens Elinga - Reading Woman - WGA7482.jpg|thumb|Elinga, ''Reading Woman,'' c. 1660]]
'''Women reading in art''' refers to any [[artistic work]] representing or portraying one or more women in the act of reading. This subject matter is quite common, with images appearing as early as the 14th century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Conlon|first=James|year=2005|title=Men Reading Women Reading: Interpreting Images of Women Readers|jstor=4137395|journal=Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies|volume=26|pages=37–58}}&lt;/ref&gt; Viewers are often exposed to a private, personal moments through these works. ''Reading Woman'' (c.1660) by [[Pieter Janssens Elinga|Pieter Janssans Elinga]] portrays reading as an intimate and introspective activity.

Beyond the exchange of ideas between author and reader, scholar James Conlon describes reading as an intimate and erotic subject, through the captivating book that touches and holds the reader's attention, and offers tactile pleasure in weight. As a result, then, the image of a woman reading becomes one of sexual subversion, and a source of fear for the male viewer or artist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Western, patriarchal societies, Conlon argues, the act of reading takes a woman out of subservient role and into a context where personal pleasure, knowledge, and enjoyment is literally in her hands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== Depictions of woman readers ==

[[File:Antoine_Wiertz_La_liseuse_de_romans.jpg|thumb|Antoine Wiertz, ''The Reader of Novels,'' c. 1853]]
During the 19th century, amidst a golden age for reading, concerns emerged about women's reading as jeopardizing marital and familial structures.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Woman Reader|last=Jack|first=Belinda|publisher=Yale University Press|year=2012|isbn=|location=|pages=228–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drawings and illustrations of the time reflected this fear that women would be seduced by books and neglect their domestic duties.  Other images implied the danger in tempting women with books as explicitly linked to their sexuality, like in [[Antoine Wiertz|Antoine Wiert's]]''The Reader of Novels'' (c.1853), where the figure of the devil literally supplies the female subject with pleasurable reading material.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
[[File:Claude_Monet_-_Springtime_-_Walters_3711.jpg|thumb|[[Claude Monet]], ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', c. 1872]]
In [[Dutch Golden Age]] painting, female readers were depicted as part of the genre of the everyday, usually engaged with letters. [[Johannes Vermeer]], for example, created numerous works around this subject, including ''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter|A Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'' and ''[[Girl Reading a Letter at an Open Window]]''. Despite this apparent acceptance of woman readers, scholars have determined that the letters including in Dutch painting were almost exclusively love letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nga.gov/content/dam/ngaweb/Education/learning-resources/teaching-packets/pdfs/dutch_painting.pdf|title=Painting in the Dutch Golden Age: A Profile of the Seventeenth Century|last=|first=|date=2007|website=National Gallery of Art, Washington|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=March 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As Conlon argues, the self-relective act of reading becomes conflated in these depictions with distraction and longing for someone - presumably a male lover - ultimately undermining the subjectivity of the woman reader.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Male artists have also depicted women readers within pastoral settings, like in [[Claude Monet]]'s ''[[Springtime (painting)|Springtime]]'', perhaps in an attempt to tame or domesticate the otherwise wild act of reading.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
[[File:Vermeer,_Johannes_-_Woman_reading_a_letter_-_ca._1662-1663.jpg|thumb|''[[Woman in Blue Reading a Letter]]'', ca. 1662-1663, [[Johannes Vermeer]]]]

== Female artists and the subject of reading ==

Female artists have also been drawn to the subject of women readers. These artists depictions of reading greatly differ from their male counterparts, demonstrating the complexity of the topic. [[Mary Cassatt]]'s ''Family Group Reading'' is a powerful representation of women readers who demonstrate subjectivity and serious literary engagement. All three are fixated on the text, and Cassat may be emphasizing that reading comes just as naturally to women as motherhood, by painting the young girl encircled by the woman's arms and drawn literally into the book.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Yagua people''' are an [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous people]] in [[Colombia]] and northeastern [[Peru]], numbering approximately 6,000.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; Currently, they live near the [[Amazon River|Amazon]], [[Napo River|Napo]], [[Putumayo River|Putumayo]] and [[Yavari River|Yavari]] rivers and their tributaries. As of 2005, some Yagua have migrated northward to [[Colombia]], near the town of [[Leticia, Colombia|Leticia]].

==Location==
Currently the Yagua live in some 30 communities scattered throughout a section of the Peruvian and Colombian [[Amazon Basin|Amazon basin]] which can roughly be described as a rectangle 200 miles wide and 350 miles long (70,000 sq. miles) extending southward from the [[2nd parallel south|second]] to the [[5th parallel south|fifth parallel]] and westward from the [[70th meridian west|70th]] to the [[75th meridian west]].&lt;ref&gt;Powlison, 1969&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Yagua language]] is classified as a [[Peba-Yaguan language]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; The only closely related languages that have been documented are [[Peba language|Peba]]&lt;ref&gt;Rivet 1911&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Yameo language|Yameo]]&lt;ref name="Espinosa 1955"&gt;Espinosa 1955&lt;/ref&gt; both of which are now extinct.

2000 Yagua people in Peru were [[monolingual]] in 2000,&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; and of these, 75% were women and 25% were men. The majority of the rest are bilingual in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to varying degrees.

==Name==
Yagua people are also known as 	Llagua, Nijyamïï Nikyejaada, Yahua, Yava, and Yegua.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

There are two possible etymologies for the term 'Yagua', both of which originate outside the [[Yagua language]].  First, the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] term ''yawar'' meaning 'blood' or 'the color of blood', is a likely possibility due to the Yagua custom of painting their faces with [[achiote]], the blood red seeds of the [[annatto]] plant (''Bixa orellana'').

During the pre-[[conquest (military)|conquest]] period, the Yaguas were in close contact with the [[Inca Empire|Incas]], as to this day there are far more [[Quechua language|Quechua]] (Inca) words in Yagua than there are Spanish words. The term in Quechua would have been something like ''yawar runa'', 'the blood-red people', which could easily have been assimilated into Spanish as ''yagua''.

Second, the term ''yagua'' in Spanish means 'royal palm'.  This term could have been applied to the Yaguas by the Spanish explorers because much of the native clothing is made of palm fiber.  Unfortunately, there is no data on whether a name resembling ''yagua'' was first used by the Quechuas of the area or the Spanish, therefore there is no principled way to distinguish between these two possible etymologies.

The only native term that might be thought of as a self-referent is ''nijyąąmíy'' 'people.' This word is often used in contrast with ''mááy'' 'white people' and ''munuñúmiy'' 'savages', 'enemies' or 'non-Yaguas'. However, ''nijyąąmíy'' is also the generic term for all human beings.

==History==

The third earliest documented European contact with the Yagua was probably made by the Spanish explorer [[Francisco de Orellana]] in January 1542. While exploring in the area of modern-day Pebas, Orellana encountered a village called Aparia, and captured two chiefs named Aparia and Dirimara, as well as some others.&lt;ref&gt;Medina 1934:257&lt;/ref&gt; These names could conceivably have come from the Yagua words ''(j)ápiiryá'' 'red macaw clan' and ''rimyurá'' 'shaman' respectively. The former could very well be a village name as well as a name applied to an individual; today clan names are still used by many Yaguas as [[family name]]s. The word for shaman might also be used to refer to an individual, especially one singled out as a 'chief'. Regular European contact began in 1686 with the establishment of a [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] mission at San Joaquin de los Omagua, on an island in the Amazon river probably near what is now the mouth of the [[Ampiyacu River]].&lt;ref&gt;Chaumeil 1981:18&lt;/ref&gt; Though this mission was established to serve the [[Cambeba]] people, there was undoubtedly contact with the Yaguas as well. From the 17th century to the last half of the 19th century, contact with the Yaguas was mainly through the Jesuit and [[Franciscan]] missionaries. In the early 18th century, Portuguese raiding parties attacked the Spanish missions throughout the Amazon region causing much geographic dispersion of the tribes that were in contact with the Spanish, and inflicting severe casualties.&lt;ref name="Espinosa 1955"/&gt;

The present extreme geographic dispersion of the Yagua, however, is due largely to the effects of the 'rubber boom' in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. At that time Europeans arrived in large numbers from [[Brazil]] and began to exploit the indigenous people to extract natural [[Latex (rubber)|latex]] from the jungle. Many Yaguas died in conflicts with these Europeans, as well as by exposure to European diseases. Others were exploited as [[Slavery|slave labor]]. Still others fled to remote regions of the jungle. Ever since the [[rubber boom]], the Yagua sense of unity and of common culture has declined.

Ethnographic descriptions of the Yagua are found in Fejos (1943) and P. Powlison (1985).  The history and migrations of the Yagua are described in Chaumeil (1983).

[[Yagua]] mythology was often told at night when they were not conducive to sleep along with them not being preoccupied with other matters. Most of their story's started with "My deceased father (mother, grandfather, grandmother etc.) used to tell me," to make the story's more real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Powlison|title=Yagua Mythology|publisher=Summer Institute of Linguistics, Inc.|isbn=0-88312-172-7|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sociology==
The tremendous distances between villages make it very difficult to have consistent interaction with Yaguas outside one's home village. All economic activity outside the village is with non-Yagua peoples, usually Spanish-speakers. Thus there is economic and [[Peer pressure|social pressure]] to learn Spanish and assimilate to the general [[Culture of Peru|Peruvian culture]]. Villages are also characteristically quite small (2 to 30 families).  This fact further limits the breadth of interaction with other Yaguas, and increases the tendency to want to reach out beyond one's village for social and economic advantages.

However, the Yagua culture and language do continue to be viable, especially in some of the larger and more isolated communities. Some children grow up speaking only Yagua, and native arts and crafts are a significant economic activity.
