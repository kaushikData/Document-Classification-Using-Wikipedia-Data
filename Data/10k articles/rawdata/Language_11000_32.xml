[[File:Cover Canada 1932 Rae air.jpg|right|300px|thumb|This 1932 Canadian "first official flight" cover, [[Great Bear Lake]] to Rae (now [[Behchoko]]), includes both a special [[cachet]] and a surcharged [[airmail stamp]].]]
'''Aerophilately''' is the branch of [[philately]] that specializes in the study of [[airmail]]. Philatelists have observed the development of [[mail]] transport by air from its beginning, and all aspects of airmail service have been extensively studied and documented by specialists.

== Scope ==
The scope of aerophilately includes:
*airmail [[postage stamp]]s, both official and unofficial (see list of US airmail postage [[List of United States airmail stamps|here]])
*other types of labels (such as [[airmail etiquette]]s)
*postal documents transmitted by air
*[[postal marking]]s related to air transport
*rates and routes, particularly [[first flight cover|first flights]] and other "special" flights
*mail recovered from aircraft accidents and other incidents ([[crash cover]]s)

While most of the study of airmail assumes transport by [[fixed-wing aircraft]], the fields of [[balloon mail]], [[dirigible mail]], [[zeppelin mail]], [[missile mail]], and [[rocket mail]] are active subspecialties. [[Astrophilately]], the study of mail in space, is a related area.

==Organizations==
[[Fédération Internationale des Sociétés Aérophilatéliques|International Federation of Aerophilatelic Societies]], (FISA), is the umbrella organization for aerophilately though aerophilatelists have formed a number of organizations around the world; many of them put out a variety of specialized publications. [[Federation Internationale de Philatelie]] (FIP) also maintains a commission.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.f-i-p.ch/fip-organisation/commissions-sections/ FIP official commissions webpage] Retrieved 27 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ahmad Tafazzoli''' (16 December 1937, [[Isfahan]] – January 15, 1997, [[Tehran]]) ({{lang-fa|احمد تفضلی}}) was a prominent [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]] [[Iranology|Iranist]] and master of ancient Iranian literature and culture. Tafazzoli was a faculty member of [[Tehran University]].

One of his most important books and his latest masterpiece is "Pre-Islamic Persian Literature". [[Jaleh Amouzegar]] contributed in editing it.

In January 1997, Ahmad Tafazzoli was found dead in [[Punak]], a suburb northwest of Tehran. He was known to have contacts with Iranian academics working abroad, and many of his colleagues believed that the authorities were behind his death, as part of the [[chain murders of Iran]]. While the precise circumstances remained unclear, Tafazzoli's death created a [[climate of fear]] at the university and discouraged criticism of the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Mideast-04.htm|title=Human Rights Watch World Report 1998|publisher=[[Human Rights Watch]]|accessdate=2007-10-09|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090443/http://www.hrw.org/worldreport/Mideast-04.htm|archivedate=2007-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anders Matias Abrahamsen Lothe''' (23 December 1875 – 1961) was a Norwegian teacher, newspaper editor and politician for the [[Labour Party of Norway|Labour Party]].

He was born at [[Lote, Norway|Lote]] in [[Gloppen]] as a son of farmers Abraham Jakobsen Lothe (1841–1919) and Johanne Marie Jensdotter Lothe (1840–1900). He finished [[Seljord Teachers' Seminary]] in 1896, when he was hired as a teacher in Gloppen. From 1900 to 1901 he went back to school, a private middle school in Gloppen, and took his examination at [[Tanks Upper Secondary School|Tanks School]] in 1901. He then worked as a teacher in [[Eikefjord]] from 1901 to 1908 and [[Sparbu]] from 1908 to 1910.&lt;ref name=nsd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsd.uib.no/polsys/index.cfm?urlname=storting&amp;lan=&amp;MenuItem=N1_1&amp;ChildItem=&amp;State=collapse&amp;UttakNr=33&amp;person=11871|title=Anders Matias Abrahamsen Lothe|publisher=Norwegian Social Science Data Services (NSD)|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became known as the first in Norway to write his middle school exam in [[Landsmål]], and he also co-founded the [[Noregs Mållag]] branch ''Firda Mållag'' in 1899, chairing it from 1903 to 1908. From 1910 to 1915 he was the editor-in-chief of ''{{ill|Firda Folkeblad|no}}''.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;&lt;ref name=nrk&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://nrk.no/nyheter/distrikt/nrk_sogn_og_fjordane/fylkesleksikon/1159395.html|title=Anders A. Lothe|encyclopedia=NRK Sogn og Fjordane Fylkesleksikon|publisher=[[NRK]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate=10 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1915 to 1945 he was a primary school teacher in [[Florø]]. He was elected to Florø city council in 1913, not-reelected in 1916 but then steadily re-elected to serve from 1919 to 1940. He was the deputy mayor of Florø in 1925–1926, 1936 and 1940. He was also a member of Florø school board from 1914 to 1917 and 1920 to 1927. He thus took part in the foundation of [[Firda Upper Secondary School]] in 1920, chairing its supervisory council from 1922 to 1933.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

Lothe also co-founded the [[Sunnfjord]] branch of [[IOGT]] as well as the [[Kinn]] and Sunnfjord branches of the Labour Party. He chaired the local party branch, as well as the county branch from 1928 to 1934.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;

He was elected  to the [[Parliament of Norway]] from [[Sogn og Fjordane]] in [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1927|1927]], [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1933|1933]] and [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 1936|1936]]. The election in 1940 did not take place owing to the [[occupation of Norway by Nazi Germany]]. Lothe was arrested by the authorities in January 1943, incarcerated in [[Bergen Prison]] until February, then [[Ulven concentration camp]] until May, then [[Grini concentration camp]] from May 1943 to July 1944.&lt;ref name=nsd/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=[[Kristian Ottosen|Ottosen, Kristian]]|title=Nordmenn i fangenskap 1940–1945|edition=1st|year=1995|publisher=Universitetsforlaget|location=Oslo|language=Norwegian|isbn=82-15-00288-9|page=419}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in 1961. A street has been named after him in Florø.&lt;ref name=nrk/&gt;

The '''Bambara Wikipedia''' is the edition of [[Wikipedia]] in the [[Bambara language]], spoken in [[Mali]], [[Burkina Faso]] and [[Senegal]]. This edition of Wikipedia contains {{NUMBEROF|ARTICLES|bm|N}} articles.

==History==
The Wikipedia was started in the beginning of 2005, along with the [[Wolof Wikipedia]] and the [[Fula Wikipedia]]. [[Kasper Souren]], a Dutchman who worked with [[Geekcorps]], established this Wikipedia while working in a mission in [[Mali]].&lt;ref name=Lihp158&gt;[[Andrew Lih|Lih]], p. 158. [https://books.google.com/books?id=AWuZAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT203&amp;dq=%22Nevertheless,+one+of+those+kick-start+seed+communities+in+Africa%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rInAUvHCNrCu2AWExoHQDA&amp;ved=0CDAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Nevertheless%2C%20one%20of%20those%20kick-start%20seed%20communities%20in%20Africa%22&amp;f=false Partial preview of relevant content], starting with "Nevertheless, one of those kick-start seed communities in Africa[...]"&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2007 the Bambara Wikipedia had 142 articles and the Wikipedia in Fula had 28 articles.&lt;ref name=Lihp158/&gt; According to Souren, he was volunteering in Mali in 2005 when he first encountered the Bambara language.&lt;ref name=CohenNoam&gt;Cohen, Noam. "[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/26/arts/26wiki.html?_r=0 African Languages Grow as a Wikipedia Presence]." ([https://www.nytimes.com/2006/08/26/arts/26wiki.html?pagewanted=print&amp;_r=0 Print]) ''[[The New York Times]]''. August 26, 2006. Retrieved on April 5, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Souren wrote in a report to an open source conference a Geekcorps Mali volunteer had created a side project where a person who wrote for the Wikipedia received $1 U.S. per article.&lt;ref name=Lihp158/&gt; Souren went to [[Bamako]] and met people at a community center. He paid each person willing to write an article $1 U.S. The authors had no internet connections and no Wikipedia usernames. They wrote articles in [[Microsoft Word]] and gave the files to Souren. Souren uploaded each article and credited the authors. Souren wrote "I can’t understand 100 percent of what they wrote, but I could estimate that it was right. It is a Wikipedia anyway, so I hope they can correct it."&lt;ref name=CohenNoam/&gt;

The total expenses of the project amounted to fewer than $100 U.S.&lt;ref name=Lihp158/&gt; In regards to the payment, Ndesanjo Macha, a Wikipedian who speaks Swahili, argued that it's unnecessary to pay editors for their efforts, and he believed he was speaking for everyone in Africa. [[Noam Cohen]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote "Most of the people who have heard about Mr. Souren’s decision to pay for entries lauded his goal but questioned his tactics, saying that they undercut the Wikipedia spirit, and that, ultimately, a Bambara Wikipedia would work only if there was a voluntary community to support it."&lt;ref name=CohenNoam/&gt; This project resulted in the partial translation of the interfaces of the Bambara and Fula Wikipedias and the creation of some articles for those Wikipedias. Souren wrote that after 2005 the Bambara and Fula Wikipedias had "only sparse activity".&lt;ref name=Lihp158/&gt; In December 2007 the Bambara Wikipedia had 142 articles and the Wikipedia in Fula had 28 articles.&lt;ref name=Lihp158/&gt;

In 2013 Valentin Vydrin, author of "Bamana Reference Corpus (BRC)", wrote that "The Bambara Wikipedia counts a couple of hundred entries, most of them rudimentary and often written without any respect for the rules of orthography."&lt;ref&gt;Vydrin, Valentin.

Call Capture technology is both a phone and text-based technology that captures personal data from persons who inquire for information on something; usually a property for sale or rent. After the call is placed, the system notifies a client of the name and phone number of the person calling. The system was designed to generate leads specifically for the real estate industry.

==Sample service==
Real estate agents for example might display their call capture phone number on a sign rider (usually a 24X6 rider on top of a "For Sale" yard sign), with a call to action like "Info 24-7." There is usually a property identification number (usually 2-6 digits) along with the local or toll free phone number that can be called (or texted) for information.  Information about a property is delivered audibly via a phone call, or provided by text link.   

The assigned real estate agent receives a lead by email or text that a client is listening to a property presentation, or that a response text link has been sent on a particular property.  The lead usually includes the caller ID of the inbound phone number, the name of the party associated to the incoming phone number and the property that was just inquired-on.  Some call capture systems allow Multiple agents to be called simultaneously with the first responding agent getting the call/lead.

==Levels of service==

Basic Call Capture service is generally NOT integrated with MLS (Multiple Listing Service) and requires the recording of each property presentation

MLS-integrated Call Capture service operates on all listings in an MLS database and use street numbers (vs property codes) for indexing all properties.  These systems require automated voicing to keep audio presentations updated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2757">'''Carlo Favetti''' (30 August 1819 - 1 December 1892) was an [[Italians|Italian]] politician and lawyer from [[Gorizia]], who also wrote poetry in the [[Friulian language]]. He was the founder and leader of [[Italian irredentism]] in [[Gorizia and Gradisca]].

He was born in [[Gorizia]], in the [[Austrian Empire]] (now in [[Italy]]), in a wealthy middle-class family. His father was a lawyer, his mother was the granddaughter of the historian [[Cipriani (disambiguation)|Giuseppe Cipriani]]. After finishing the [[Gymnasium (school)|classical gymnasium]] in Gorizia, he enrolled at the [[University of Vienna]], where he studied law. Upon returning to Gorizia, he joined several Italian patriotic associations. In 1850, he founded the newspaper ''Il Giornale di Gorizia'',  which was abolished by the Austrian authorities in 1851.

After the restoration of political liberties in the Austrian Empire in 1861, he was elected mayor of Gorizia. The Austrian government however refused to confirm the nomination. Nevertheless, he remained an influential figure in the local administration; under his supervision, an extensive building program was carried out in Gorizia.

In 1866, during the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], Favetti was arrested by the Austrian authorities, and sentenced to 6 years of imprisonment for subversive activities. Already the following year, he was released. Fearing another arrest, Favetti escaped to [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italy]] in 1868, settling in [[Venice]]. After the [[amnesty]] of 1871, he returned to Gorizia. In 1877, he was re-elected to the city council of Gorizia, where he remained until his death in 1896.

He wrote several poems and plays in the local version of the [[Friulian language]].

== Major works ==
*''Doi quadris della vita popolar gurizzana'' ('Two Sketches of the Folk Life in Gorizia'; 1882).
*''Fusilir e granatir, un scherz comic'' ('The Fusilier and the Grenadier: A Satirical Play'; 1891).
*''Leonardo Papes. Un zittadin gurizzan del 1500'' ('Leonardo Papes. A Citizen of Gorizia from 1500; 1892).

'''Christmas creep''' is a [[merchandising]] phenomenon in which [[merchant]]s and retailers introduce Christmas-themed merchandise or decorations before the traditional start of the [[Christmas and holiday season|holiday shopping season]], which in the United States is on the [[Black Friday (shopping)|day after Thanksgiving]].&lt;ref name="titleChicago Sun-Times:: Search"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=CSTB&amp;p_theme=cstb&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB36D9911BB108A&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM |title=He's well-suited to enjoying life of Santa | first = Alf | last = Siewers |accessdate=December 26, 2007 | date = November 25, 1987 |format= |work=Chicago Sun-Times| quote =  And so does the culture, with a commercializing of himself that Santa deplores even as he has watched the holiday season creep back to Labor Day.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term was first used in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="Macmillan"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.macmillandictionary.com/New-Words/060918-Christmas-creep.htm |title=Macmillan English Dictionary Word Of The Week Archive – "Christmas creep" |accessdate=December 26, 2007| date = September 18, 2006|publisher=Macmillan Publishers|first=Kerry |last=Maxwell |work=New Words|quote= The term Christmas creep was first used in the mid-eighties, though gained wider recognition more recently, possibly due to subsequent coinage of the expression mission creep.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic motivation==

The phenomenon is associated with a desire of merchants to take advantage of particularly heavy Christmas-related shopping well before [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] in the United States and before [[Halloween]] in Canada. The term ‘Black Friday’ was not used until recently in the UK and Ireland. The increased usage can be traced to the internet being more widespread, as well as growing [[Americanization]], as neither country celebrates Thanksgiving. Previously, retailers referred to Christmas as the "golden quarter", that is, the three months of October through December is the quarter of the year in which the retail industry hopes to make the most profit.&lt;ref&gt;Zoe Wood (Tuesday December 21, 2010) [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2010/dec/21/uk-snow-chaos-christmas-dinners Snow chaos raises fears for Christmas dinners minus the trimmings] ''[[The Guardian]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The lack of Thanksgiving as a ‘barrier’ between holidays has caused several retailers to put up Christmas sales earlier in the year. For instance, Irish retailer [[Brown Thomas]] opens its Christmas store in mid-August.
This phenomenon can apply for other holidays as well, notably [[Valentine's Day]], Easter and [[Mother's Day]]. The motivation for holiday creep is for retailers to lengthen their selling interval for seasonal merchandise in order to maximize profit and to give early-bird shoppers a head start on that holiday. However, it is not clear that this practice has been consistently beneficial for retailers.&lt;ref name="Wharton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://knowledge.wharton.upenn.edu/article.cfm?articleid=1330 |title=Christmas Creep: The Shopping Season Is Longer, but Is It Better?|accessdate=December 27, 2007 |date=March 1, 2006 |work=Knowledge@Wharton|publisher=[[Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania]]|quote=...&amp;nbsp;Wharton marketing scholars and other analysts say an extended Christmas season is something of a mixed bag. It may hold advantages, disadvantages&amp;nbsp;— or even no advantages&amp;nbsp;— for store owners.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seasonal creep is not limited to the northern hemisphere winter holiday season and other popular holidays and observances, but is also becoming more common for merchandise associated with a general season of the year.  Advertising for winter-, spring-, summer-, and fall-related goods generally now begins midway through the previous season. For example, many supermarkets in the United Kingdom begin selling [[Easter eggs]] even before Christmas, and in the US, stores begin selling [[Independence Day (United States)|4th of July]] products before Easter, and the next major holiday is marketed as soon as or before the previous has ended.  Such a phenomenon is known under the more general name of '''holiday creep'''.

In Australia, shops have been known to have their Christmas merchandise available as early as late September, mainly because older Australians generally don't celebrate Halloween compared to younger Australians, though by the 2010s, Halloween merchandise has cropped up alongside Christmas merchandise during the same periods. The department store, [[David Jones Limited]] even begins selling Christmas merchandise at the start of September.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

==United States==
In United States retail, the phenomenon was pioneered by stores like [[Sam's Club]],{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} which introduced early Christmas sales to support resellers.  The hardware chain [[Lowe's]] followed in 2000 with a policy of setting out [[Christmas tree]]s and decorations by October 1, mainly because the Halloween and Thanksgiving holidays do not provide enough merchandise or sales to fill retail space between the end of the summer season and the Christmas season.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}  In 2002–2003, Christmas creep accelerated markedly with retailers such as [[Walmart]], [[J. C. Penney]], and [[Target Corporation|Target]] beginning their Christmas sales in October.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20061025/news_1n25creep.html Christmas Creeps Into Stores]'', San Diego Union-Tribune, October 25, 2006.  Accessed November 18, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2006 the [[National Retail Federation]], an industry trade group, said that 40 percent of consumers planned to start their holiday shopping before Halloween.  Since the 2010s, there has been a growing trend for retailers to start selling holiday merchandise in mid- to late-September, with retailers such as Walmart, Sam's Club, [[Kmart]], [[Costco]],  J.C. Penney, [[Sears]], and [[Lowe's]] now beginning their Christmas sales earlier than October 1.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://business.time.com/2011/09/13/the-christmas-shopping-season-now-starts-in-september/ |title=The Christmas Shopping Season Now Starts … in September? |website=[[Time Magazine]] |publication-date=September 13, 2011 |access-date=February 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting==
Christmas creep has also been cited as a phenomenon in [[radio broadcasting]]. Prior to the early 21st century, radio stations commonly began adding some [[Christmas songs]] to their regular playlists in early December and then playing an all-Christmas playlist on December 24 and 25.{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} In 2000&lt;ref name="OS11-24-2000"&gt;{{cite news|title=The gravy on my mashed potatoes|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14162187/xmas_2000/|first=Jim|last=Abbott|newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel|page=135|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=November 24, 2000|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OS12-22-2000"&gt;{{cite news|title=Holiday memories flow nonstop|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14162137/xmas_2000/|first=Jim|last=Abbott|newspaper=The Orlando Sentinel|page=110|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|date=December 22, 2000|accessdate=October 2, 2017}}{{Open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; some stations began playing an exclusively Christmas format for the entire month of December, a practice that became more widespread in 2001. In subsequent years, such stations have commonly shifted to an all-Christmas playlist after [[Thanksgiving (United States)|Thanksgiving]], or even several weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.phillymag.com/news/2014/11/14/radio-station-playing-christmas-music-month/|title=South Jersey Radio Station Easy 93.1 Has Been Playing Christmas Music for a Month|publisher=Philadelphia Magazine|first=Dan|last=McQuade|date=November 14, 2014|accessdate=October 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A handful of American radio stations&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.wgal.com/news/too-early-for-christmas-music-susquehanna-valley-radio-station-now-playing-it/29771076 WGAL News]", ''Too Early for Christmas Music? Susquehanna Radio station now playing it'', November 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; have, since 2006, earned a reputation for regularly switching to Christmas music on November 1, the day after Halloween; as of 2011, this has not become the norm for most of North America (mid-November is the typical start time for Christmas music on most radio stations in the United States and Canada{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}), and it is still extremely rare to hear stations (other than those pulling a [[stunting (broadcasting)|stunt]] between changing formats) change to Christmas music in October.

Some of the channels on the [[cable radio]] service [[Music Choice]] begin playing Christmas music continually from the end of Halloween up until the first week of January (with the Internet age, the network maintains an exclusive Christmas music channel through some providers and their [[TV Everywhere]] platform year-round). Likewise, the U.S. cable channel [[Hallmark Channel]] begins airing continuous Christmas movies through the whole months of November and December and since 2018, [[Freeform (TV channel)|Freeform]] airs Christmas movies from November 1 to December 25.

Although not often broadcast in the summer, the animated special ''[[Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July]]'' is based on the concept and set in July.{{Citation needed|reason="Rudolph and Frosty's Christmas in July" is arguably based more on the concept of Christmas in July than on Christmas creep.  Though Christmas in July could possibly be considered an example of Christmas creep, there is no source given for the claim that the special is based on the latter.|date=November 2018}}

==Satire==
This market trend is satirized in the 1974 animated special ''[[It's the Easter Beagle, Charlie Brown]]'', when the characters go shopping at a [[department store]] and discover that it has its Christmas displays up in the middle of April, including a sign forewarning that there were only a mere 246 days left until Christmas. Additionally, in 1973's ''[[A Charlie Brown Thanksgiving]]'', Sally complains that she was looking for a turkey tree for Thanksgiving but had only found Christmas supplies.

Several songs satirize the phenomenon, including [[Loudon Wainwright III]]'s "Suddenly It's Christmas" (from his 1993 live album ''[[Career Moves]]''), [[Straight No Chaser (group)|Straight No Chaser]]'s "The Christmas Can-Can" (from their 2009 album ''[[Christmas Cheers]]''), [[Paul and Storm]]'s "The Way-Too-Early Christmas Song" (from their 2010 album ''[[Do You Like Star Wars?]]''). Christian singer/songwriter [[Brandon Heath]] voiced his feelings on Christmas creep in the song "The Day After Thanksgiving" (from his 2013 album ''[[Christmas Is Here (Brandon Heath album)|Christmas Is Here]]'').

In [[Jim Butcher]]'s 2012 novel ''[[Cold Days]]'', Santa Claus himself declares that he's drawing the line at Halloween.

'''Communicationssprache''' is one of the earliest [[international auxiliary language]]s.

== Overview ==

It was created by [[Joseph Schipfer]] and first published in 1839{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} in [[Wiesbaden]].

This project is of historical interest for two reasons—first, it being based on [[French language|French]], but the inclusion of ''ä'', ''ö'', ''ü'' reflects the common view of the time that French is "a world language to some extent". A mere forty years later, in 1879, [[Volapük]] took [[English language|English]] for basis. Second, Schipfer's project reflects a new conscience of greater possibilities of the international communication which appeared by the invention of the [[railway]] and [[steam ship]]. He even recommended that his project be used on these "new means of voyage".

==Grammar==
Communicationssprache is based on (or a simplification of) [[French language|French]] (See [[French orthography]]), making heavy (even exclusive) use of respelled French vocabulary, which Schipfer considered to be nearly universal among the educated classes of the world of his time. Silent letters were removed, one sound for one letter, circumflexes and diaereses were removed, graves to distinguish homographs were removed, the letter '''w''' was added (as in English), vowels ''e'' instead of ''é'', ''ä'' instead of French ''è'', ''ö'' instead of French ''œ'', ''u'' instead of French ''ou'', ''ü'' instead of French ''u'', ''oa'' instead of French ''oi'', the inclusion of macrons for long vowels, and one sound per letter. Although the final orthography can be read and spelled easily due to this one-sound-per-letter principle, the actual conversion of French words is inconsistent, being based sometimes on pronunciation and sometimes on orthography, for example word-final silent &lt;c&gt; is deleted, as in Estoma "stomach" &lt; éstomac, but silent &lt;h&gt; is kept, as in Homa "man" &lt; homme.

Some of its characteristics are:

*No articles.
*Invariable adjectives.
*Comparatives in -ior and -iost.
*Adverbs formed by adding -ly to adjectives.
*Possessive pronouns in -a.
*Infinitives in -er.
*Nouns were declined.
*Capitalization of nouns, as in German.

The declension of nouns works as follows, using Masona "house" as an example:

*Nominative Masona, Masonas "a house, houses"
*Genitive Masone, Masones "of a house, of houses"
*Dative Masoni, Masonis "to a house, to houses"
*Accusative Masono, Masonos "a house, houses"
*Vocative o Masona, o Masonos "oh house, oh houses"
*Ablative Masonu, Masonus "in a house, in houses"

'''A Response to a Dear Friend'''

''Communicationssprache'': Cher Amia! Ei demanda mil Par donos, que no repondia ta obligeant Lettro dan tamsu a devea.

M. 28 Janvier 1839, ma most cher Amie, ta most devue Amia.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schipfer, Versuch einer Grammatik für eine Allgemeine Communications- oder Weltsprache, Wiesbaden 1839&lt;/ref&gt;

''German'': Theurer Freund! Ich bitte tausendmal um Nachsicht, daß ich Ihr sehr verbindliches Schreiben nicht zu gehöriger Zeit beantwortet habe. Diesen Fehler könnte ich nicht entschuldigen, wenn ich Ihnen nicht versichern könnte, daß ich mehrere Monate krank gewesen bin. Das ist die einzige Ursache meines langen Stillschweigens, wobei ich Sie zugleich versichere, daß ich den Werth Ihrer Freundschaft und Güte, um deren Fortsetzung ich unterthänig bitte, in ihrem ganzen Umfange zu schätzen weis. Ich wünsche nichts sehnlicher, als eine Gelegenheit zu haben, um Ihnen thätige Beweise dieser Aeußerung geben zu können, um Ihnen thätig zu zeigen, mit welcher hochachtungsvollen Freundschaft ich Ihnen ergeben bin und bleiben werde. M. d. 28. Jan. 1839, meines werthesten Freundes ergebenster Diener und Freund.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Schipfer, Versuch einer Grammatik für eine Allgemeine Communications- oder Weltsprache, Wiesbaden 1839&lt;/ref&gt;

''English'': Dear friend! I am asking a thousand times for understanding that I haven't responded to your very binding letter in proper time. I could not excuse this mistake if I could not assure you that I have been ill for several months. That is the sole cause for my long silence, and I wish to assure you at the same time that I appreciate the worth of your friendship and goodness, the continuation of which I subserviently ask for, in its entirety. I wish for nothing more dearly than to have an opportunity to be able to give you active proof of this statement, in order to actively show you with what respectful friendship I am, and shall remain, devoted to you. Monday, 28 January 1839, most devoted servant and friend of my most valued friend

'''María Dolores de Gortázar Serantes''' (1872 in León - April 9, 1936 in Leganés) was a [[Spanish people|Spanish]] writer, journalist, education activist, [[Feminism|feminist]] militant and political propagandist. In the 1910-1920s she enjoyed some popularity as a [[novelist]]; currently her literary contribution is considered of very little value. Over decades she contributed to some 40 periodicals and launched a short-lived feminine review on her own. Briefly engaged in setting up schools for the middle- and low-class girls, later she remained active advocating the presence of females in public life, especially in culture and education. Politically she sided with the [[Carlism|Carlists]], for decades contributing to their periodicals. All her activities were flavored with zealous Catholicism.

==Family and youth==
[[File:Fundación Joaquín Díaz - Calle de San Marcelo - León.jpg|thumb|left|[[León, Spain|León]], early 20th c.]]
Her father, [[Carlos Gortázar y Campillo]],&lt;ref&gt;Carmen Ramírez Gómez, ''Mujeres escritoras en la prensa andaluza del siglo XX (1900-1950)'', Sevilla 2000, {{ISBN|8447205606}}, p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; was member of the urban middle-class. The Gortázar family is one of the oldest ones in Spain, its first representatives noted in the 12th century as related to [[Biscay (province)|Vizcaya]].&lt;ref&gt;named Juan López de Gortázar y Mendoza, see ''1000 años de Genealogía Vasca'', [in:] ''Gortázar-Villela'' web service, available [http://www.gortazar.es/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; Over centuries the Gortázars held various civil and religious posts in Biscay, [[Alava]] and [[Cantabria (province)|Cantabria]]; the family became very branched and scattered across the North of Spain, some branches renamed to Cortázar.&lt;ref&gt;in some sources instead of "Dolores Gortázar Serantes" the spelling version of "Dolores Cortázar Serantes" is systematically preferred, compare ''Córtazar Serantes, Dolores'' entry, [in:] ''Real Academia Galega'' service, available [http://academia.gal/imaxin-hemeroteca-web/autor.do;jsessionid=5EFBD2790D0D8C190CD065F498F55604?id=785&amp;d-6034487-o=1&amp;d-6034487-p=2&amp;d-6034487-s=0&amp;current_page=4 here]. Since all her books and almost all her signed press contributions are signed with the "Gortázar" version, it is followed also here&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear which branch the Dolores ascendants belonged to, apart that they were linked to [[Santander (province)|Santander]] and Biscay.&lt;ref name="Ilustración Nacional"&gt;''La Ilustración Nacional'' 30.06.01, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=4054540&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Her father joined the press corps, working as reporter and journalist; in the late 1850s and early 1860s he contributed from [[La Habana]],&lt;ref&gt;he travelled to Cuba in 1857, ''Boletín oficial de la provincia de Santander'' 01.09.57, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000324917&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; later settling in [[León, Spain|León]].&lt;ref&gt;Alonso Zamora Vicente, ''Años difíciles: Valle-Inclán y la Fundación San Gaspar'', [in:] ''Boletín de la Real Academia Española'' 75 (1995), p. 468&lt;/ref&gt; It is there he married a local girl, [[Juliana Serantes y de Cadórniga]] (died 1916),&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo Militar'' 06.10.16, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003416572&amp;page=3 here], ''La Correspondencia de España'' 05.10.16, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=7&amp;path=7140181&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; descendant to a [[Leonese people|Leonese]] family&lt;ref name="Ilustración Nacional" /&gt; distinguished especially along her maternal line.&lt;ref&gt;compare Emilio Gancedo, ''El León con más señorío'', [in:] ''Diario de León'' 09.01.11, available [http://www.diariodeleon.es/noticias/revista/leon-mas-senorio_576356.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage settled in León; it is not clear how many children they had, though it is likely that Dolores was the only one.&lt;ref&gt;necrological notes of Juliana Serantes de Cadórniga mention only Dolores as her grieving child; Dolores, who used to dedicate poems to various family members, has not dedicated one to any sibling&lt;/ref&gt; She frequented the [[Carmelites|Carmelitan]] college in her native city&lt;ref&gt;Concha Casado, ''Dolores Gortazar Serantes'', [in:] ''Filandón'' 22.10.1995, p. 4,  ''La Ilustración Nacional'' 30.06.01, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=4054540&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and from childhood demonstrated a talent for letters. Her 1882 poem, dedicated to Jesus, was published in local press;&lt;ref&gt;''El Genio Médi-o-quirurgico'' 15.06.82, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029045705&amp;page=8 here], Casado 1995, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; her 1884 comedy was played at the Carmelitan theatre in León; her religious polemics was also acknowledged in print.&lt;ref name="La Tradición"&gt;''La Tradición'' 16.06.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2239028&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Gortázar wrote [[Poetry|poetic pieces]] throughout all of her life. They are scattered across various periodicals from the 1890s to the 1930s, sometimes featured on front pages;&lt;ref&gt;''El Día'' 03.11.04, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002481955&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; the only major&lt;ref&gt;in 1931 she wrote collection of poems, titled ''Collar de flores'', which remained unpublished, ''El Imparcial'' 10.12.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001095806&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; volume she published was ''Nimias'' (1898).&lt;ref&gt;a collection of her 25 early poems. It is available online on ''Biblioteca Digital Hispanica'' service, available [http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000192808&amp;page=1 here]. In 1929 Gortázar published also a single lengthy poem, ''Novena al Santo Cristo de Lego'' (32 pp), ''El Cruzado Español'' 13.12.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005195&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Her poetry keeps revolving around Christian virtues, advantages of family life, beauty of Spain and patriotic values; fairly conventional if not banal in terms of style, in terms of content it advances the praise of traditional orthodoxy, even if at times flavored with some melancholy. One more literary genre she followed was drama; she is known to have written two one-act [[Comedy|comedies]]&lt;ref&gt;''Margarita'' (1890) and ''En el buen retiro'' (1909)&lt;/ref&gt; featuring "tipos y costumbres leonesas", played in León&lt;ref&gt;''La Tradición'' 16.06.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2239028&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''El Pueblo'' 10.06.09, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000186605&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Some scholars claim they were inspired by Zorilla and Campoamor, Ochoa Fuertes 1997, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and perhaps also in Madrid.&lt;ref&gt;''Noticiero Salmantino'' 06.02.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=5034990&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In terms of public and scholarly recognition Gortázar was first noticed as a translator; her Spanish ''El arte poética'' (1901) version of [[Horace|Horace’s]] ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars poëtica]]''&lt;ref&gt;in the prologue she noted that it was death of her father and husband which inspired her, Casado 1995, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; won awards at the León [[Juegos Florales]]&lt;ref&gt;''La Tradición'' 16.06.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2239028&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''La Correspondencia de Valencia'' 13.03.25, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000244725&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was acknowledged with praise by [[Real Academia Española]].&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 17.02.23, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1923/02/17/023.html here]. Some sources claimed the translation was allegedly rewarded by the Royal Academy, compare ''Mujeres españolas'' 22.12.29, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=41&amp;path=1000229833&amp;presentacion=pagina here], or Ochoa Fuertes 1997, p. 8; in fact, it was only acknowledged in its bulletin&lt;/ref&gt; She tried her hand in [[historiography]], especially in [[paleography]]; entrusted with specific tasks by [[Real Academia de la Historia]],&lt;ref name="La correspondencia de Valencia"&gt;''La Correspondencia de Valencia'' 13.03.25, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1000244725&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; she published two studies on [[San Miguel de Escalada]] (1899)&lt;ref&gt;''San Miguel de Escalada. Nuevos monumentos y documentos'', [in:] ''Boletín de la Real Academia de Historia'' XXXIII (1889)&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Monastery of Nuestra Señora de Valvanera|Valvanera monastery]] (1907).&lt;ref&gt;''El monasterio de Valvanera.

In literature Gortázar obtained her biggest success as a novelist, the author of ''El Cristo de la roca'' (1911) and ''La roca del amor'' (1924).&lt;ref&gt;both novels are available online on ''Biblioteca Digital Hispánica'' service, available [http://bdh.bne.es/bnesearch/Search.do?numfields=1&amp;field1=autor&amp;field1val=%22Gort%C3%A1zar+Serantes%2c+Dolores+de%22&amp;field1Op=AND&amp;docLikeThis=bdh0000075964&amp;exact=on&amp;advanced=true&amp;pageSize=30&amp;language=es&amp;fillForm=false&amp;showBack=true&amp;visor= here]&lt;/ref&gt; Both are in fact one and the same novel, the latter slightly re-edited to provide a sense of novelty;&lt;ref&gt;compare e.g. "El marinerito es de cera y se la antoja ponerle al sol, y el pobre suda la gota gorda y se me deshace" (''Cristo de la Roca'', p. 35) v. "El bolchevique es de cera, y se le antoja ponerle al sol y se me derrite" (''La roca del amor'', p. 33). Some editions are purely stylistical, compare e.g. "Espléndida comida nos dio el marino aquella noche en el lujoso comedor de su yate" (''Cristo de la Roca'', p. 74) v. "Una comida suculenta nos dio el marino aquella noche en el lujoso comedor de su yate" (''La roca del amor'', p. 67)&lt;/ref&gt; the disguise proved successful, as in contemporary press ''La roca'' was acknowledged as original.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;''ABC'' 12.02.25, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1925/02/12/018.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; The novel is a love story, vaguely set in a milieu of Valencian aristocracy; it features a complex family intrigue. The plot is about overcoming a series of mysterious tragedies and misfortunes; Christian backbone of the protagonists, one of them a Catholic priest, enabled them to succeed. Falling into the typical [[genre fiction]] of the era, ''El Cristo'' / ''La roca'' is perhaps most interesting due to its narrative technique, as the story is made of different recollective accounts. Other Gortázar’s prosaic attempts, a shorter [[novel]]&lt;ref&gt;''¡Sueños!''; the issue date is unclear but fell on the years prior to 1911, compare Dolores Gortázar, ''Cristo de la Roca'', Madrid 1911, p. 267, available [http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000075964&amp;page=284 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and a collection of stories,&lt;ref&gt;''Sin color''; the issue date is unclear but fell on the years prior to 1911, compare Dolores Gortázar, ''Cristo de la Roca'', Madrid 1911, p. 267, available [http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000075964&amp;page=284 here]&lt;/ref&gt; were far less successful.&lt;ref&gt;though herself a Carlist, she has not contributed to [[Carlism in literature]]&lt;/ref&gt;	

For some 40 years Gortázar contributed to numerous press titles;&lt;ref&gt;for the first ones identified see ''El Porvenir de León'' 30.01.95, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=1108405&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''El Porvenir de León'' 10.04.95, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1108484&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; according to one source she published in some 35 periodicals&lt;ref name="La correspondencia de Valencia" /&gt; in Spain and in America.&lt;ref name="Mujeres españolas"&gt;''Mujeres españolas'' 22.12.29, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=41&amp;path=1000229833&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Only some of them can be identified;&lt;ref&gt;the ones identified are ''El Album Ibero-Americano'', ''El Campeón'', ''El Cantábrico'', ''El castellano'', ''El Correo Español'' (Madrid), ''El Correo Español'' (Buenos Aires), ''La Correspondencia de España'', ''La Crónica'', ''El Cruzado Español'', ''El Cuerno'', ''El Día'', ''El diario de Murcia'', ''El Diario de Zamora'', ''La Gaceta del Norte'', ''Gloria Femenina'', ''El Guadalete de Jerez'', ''Heraldo de Zamora'', ''La Ilustración Nacional'', ''El Lábaro'', ''El Liberal'', ''La Libertad'', ''Las Margaritas'', ''El Nervión'', ''El Noticiero'', ''Nuevo Mundo'', ''La Patria'', ''El Porvenir'', ''Revista Gallega'', ''Revista Hispano-Lusitana'', ''El Siglo Futuro'', ''Renovacion Española'' and ''Roma''. Listed partially after Judith Rideout, ''Woman Writers' Networks in Spanish Magazines around 1900'' (University of Glasgor research spreadsheet), available [http://researchdata.gla.ac.uk/336/ here]&lt;/ref&gt; the ones to be named due to her longtime collaboration are local dailies ''El Porvenir'' (León) and ''El Diario de Zamora'', Carlist periodicals ''[[:es:El Correo Español|El Correo Español]]''&lt;ref&gt;in the 1900s, 1910s and early 1920s&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[:es:El Cruzado Español|El Cruzado Español]]'',&lt;ref&gt;in the late 1920s and early 1930s&lt;/ref&gt; and women’s reviews like ''Gloria Femenina''. The title which stands out is ''Roma'', her own initiative formatted as one of the first Spanish feminine reviews&lt;ref&gt;it included sections on literature, hygiene, fashion, music, education, religion and others, ''El Salmantino'' 02.03.12, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5036567&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and issued in 1912-1914.&lt;ref&gt;there are no copies available in digital hemerotecas. ''Roma'' was launched in late 1912, as in January 1913 there was 5th issue released, see ''La Correspondencia de España'' 12.01.13, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000659397&amp;page=5 here]. Gortázar was last named as its directora in 1915; the same year she started contributing to ''Gloria Femenina''. ''Roma'' was already her second attempt to launch a feminine review; the first one occurred in 1900, when a planned review was supposed to be named ''Revista Madrileña de Señoras'', Judith Rideout, ''Women’s Writing Networks in Spanish Magazines Around 1900'' [PhD thesis University of Glasgow], Glasgow 2016, p. 138, ''El País'' 15.06.00, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001890545&amp;page=2 here]. Some scholars claim also that in an unspecified period she directed a periodical named ''El Cuerno'', Ochoa Fuertes 1997, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Gortázar’s contributions are mostly poems, travel correspondence.&lt;ref&gt;see e.g. her 1928 correspondence from Egypt, ''Las Provincias'' 26.02.28, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000316760&amp;presentacion=pagina here], or the 1928 from France, ''Las Provincias'' 03.06.28, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=11&amp;path=1000317480&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; short stories,&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 16.10.28, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000318804&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; pieces on literature, arts, culture and education, all invariably formatted along Catholic lines and generally steering clear of controversial topics. As she usually published under various pen-names&lt;ref&gt;the one identified is "Dama Duende", see ''Las Provincias'' 29.08.28, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1000318764&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the scale of her production is yet to be assessed, though it was probably massive.

In course of the usual [[:es:Oposición (examen)|opposiciones]] contest, in 1902 Gortázar emerged successful and commenced teaching in an unidentified Madrid state college.&lt;ref&gt;its objective was to "difundir la cultura entre las clases sociales, inculcar, inspiradas en la doctrina de Jesucristo, al amor universal, este es, la caridad que nos ha de redimir", ''La Correspondencia de España'' 06.01.02, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=7104796&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year she floated an idea of setting up a school for poor and handicapped children in Madrid,&lt;ref&gt;''El Lábaro'' 01.04.02, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=5035628&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; the concept which in 1904 was somewhat re-formatted to a high-quality state school for girls from middle class, daughters of "viudas, empleados, familias de militares y á veces la nobleza hundida".&lt;ref&gt;''La Libertad'' 16.08.02, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1157352&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Already at that time the [[Maria Christina of Austria|queen-mother Maria Christina]] was envisioned as a noble patron of the enterprise. In 1905 the project took shape of [[Real Centro Universitario Escorial-Maria Christina|Centro Nacional de Instrucción de María Cristina]], with Gortázar as its directora;&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 04.07.05, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=7114132&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; she supervised preparation works, which in 1906 led to opening of Escuela María Cristina,&lt;ref&gt;''El Guadalete'' 25.03.06, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=2076775&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in some sources referred to as Real Colegio de María Cristina.&lt;ref&gt;''La Lectura Dominical'' 13.10.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001636172&amp;page=15 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The establishment, apparently financed by private sponsors,&lt;ref&gt;financed by a certain Señor Vincenti&lt;/ref&gt; was hailed in the press as state-of-the-art school;&lt;ref&gt;the school comprised own dormitory, gimnasio and garden&lt;/ref&gt; initially it admitted only 19 girls.&lt;ref name="El Imparcial"&gt;''El Imparcial'' 13.06.06, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000890967&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Its curriculum was fairly standard, though it was allegedly the first one to include cooking lessons.&lt;ref&gt;''El Liberal'' 01.02.05, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001450212&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Though in 1907 Gortázar was still the headmaster,&lt;ref&gt;one more name was Real Centro de María Cristina, ''El Guadalete'' 24.02.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2071805&amp;presentacion=pagina here], more detailed info in ''La Correspondencia de España'' 19.09.07, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=7113146&amp;presentacion=pagin here] a&lt;/ref&gt; in 1908 and in unclear circumstances she left the establishment and returned to León. The same year she was appointed profesora provisional of Escuela Normal de Maestras in her native city,&lt;ref&gt;with the salary of 1500 ptas, ''El Distrito Universitario'' 07.09.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2185422&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; entering also the jury of [[Universidad de Oviedo]], a body supervising the college opposiciones.&lt;ref&gt;''El Distrito Universitario'' 28.12.08, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2185438&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1909 she was nominated profesora provisional in Escuela Normal de Maestras in [[Soria]],&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 27.05.09, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;path=7121336&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet her career was rather short.

Epistolario'', vol. 12, April 1908 – April 1910, Madrid 1989 {{ISBN|9788473923217}}, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; The episode seems to have terminated Gortázar’s teaching career,&lt;ref&gt;one source claims that at unspecified time she taught also in Avila, Ramírez Gómez 2000, p. 177. In 1920 she attempted also theoretical contribution on education, compare Dolores Gortázar, ''Las Escuelas Pias de Villacrriedo: Un colegio model'', [in:] ''Revista Calasancia'' 8 (1920), pp. 286-288. She seemed quite competent and discussing detailed issues, e.g. advantages of large dormitory rooms tens of pupils and the small ones, for 4-6 pupils&lt;/ref&gt; though she was later reported as engaged in opening schools for the working class in [[Covadonga]] in 1914&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 03.07.14, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=7130235&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in Madrid in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 05.01.18, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029779374&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1910s Gortázar was engaged in countless organizations marked by their feminine, Catholic, educational and at times social character. In 1910 she was co-founder of Fundación San Francisco de Paula,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 27.05.10, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1910/05/27/011.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the mid-1910s headed Acción Social Católica Feminista,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 05.04.13, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=7133596&amp;presentacion=pagin here] a&lt;/ref&gt; known also as Acción Social Católica de la Mujer Española,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 28.02.13, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=4&amp;path=7131936&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in the late 1910s acted in La Mujer Católica,&lt;ref&gt;''El Día de Palencia'' 08.05.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2204655&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; since the early 1920s campaigned for hygiene and sanity,&lt;ref&gt;''El Orzán'' 23.10.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=7123418&amp;presentacion=pagina here], ''La Libertad'' 03.04.27, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=7155476&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1927 co-launched Cruzada de Buenas Lecturas&lt;ref&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 29.10.27, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000436438&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and as its president&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 25.05.28, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1000317472&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; remained active in the organization until the early 1930s,&lt;ref&gt;''La Independencia'' 27.06.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=2113796&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1931 co-founded Club Feminista&lt;ref&gt;its objectives were "defensa social de la mujer" and "protección de la clase media femenina", ''Ahora'' 01.11.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029983733&amp;page=31 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was president of Sociedad Femenina Aspiraciones,&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 27.12.31, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1931/12/27/054.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; while in 1932 she became president of Agrupación Femenina Paz Social.&lt;ref&gt;''Heraldo de Madrid'' 24.02.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000994666&amp;page=2 here], ''ABC'' 29.03.32, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1932/03/29/005.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; On top of this she contributed to feminine press, kept giving lectures on cultural topics,&lt;ref&gt;''El País'' 19.06.10, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0002378066&amp;page=3 here], ''El Orzán'' 23.10.23, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=3&amp;path=7123418&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. She was particularly active in 1932; for the single month of June compare ''La Nación'' 02.07.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026309321&amp;page=13 here], ''El Siglo Futuro'' 30.06.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000500252&amp;page=1 here], ''La Epoca'' 30.06.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001105557&amp;page=2 here], ''La Nación'' 27.06.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026309090&amp;page=5 here], ''La Nación'' 02.06.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026308139&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; took part in various veladas culturales&lt;ref&gt;''El magisterio español'' 05.03.27, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;path=1000301491&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and was member of [[:es:Asociación de Escritores y Artistas Españoles|Asociación de Escritores y Artistas]].&lt;ref name="El Siglo Futuro"&gt;''El Siglo Futuro'' 09.04.36, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000581468&amp;page=20 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Over time her engagements assumed somewhat non-traditional tone;&lt;ref&gt;Traditionalist, traditional and generally orthodox conservative outlook used to be her trademark; as late as in 1930 she demanded that minors below 14 years of age are not allowed into cinemas, ''El Cruzado Español'' 02.05.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005375&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1931-1933 she campaigned for [[female suffrage]].&lt;ref&gt;"fomentar las actividades políticas y la práctica del voto de la mujer", ''Ahora'' 01.11.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029983733&amp;page=31 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Carlist==
[[File:Don Jaime de Borbón.jpg|thumb|160px|left|[[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]]]]
Gortázar’s father was a [[Liberalism in Spain|Liberal]], active republican&lt;ref&gt;''La Justicia'' 08.03.91, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0030308862&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and friend of [[Emilio Castelar|Castelar]].&lt;ref&gt;''La Cruz'' 15.10.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3059025&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear how the young Dolores developed [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] sympathies; in the 1890s she was already a declared Carlist.&lt;ref&gt;compare an anecdote involving herself and Salmerón, ''La Cruz'', 15.10.31, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=3059025&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; Initially her activity was about organizing prayers&lt;ref&gt;''El Porvenir de León'' 14.08.95, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1108620&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and donations for the [[Cuban War of Independence|Spanish army fighting in Cuba]],&lt;ref&gt;''El Porvenir de León'' 17.08.95, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1108623&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; yet already in 1899 she engaged in veladas artisticas of the León círculo carlista.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 13.03.99, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029762406&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; Successful proselytizing in private&lt;ref&gt;see an account of a fresh Carlist convert: "Lo sentí mucho cuando supe que dicha señora era liberala y carlista. Con gran repulsion fui á verla, y quedé maravillado al contempar á la distinguida dama, llena de encantos sencillos y dulzura". Gortázar is referred to as "joven aristocrática é ilustrada y eminent escritora carlista, de alma grande, sublime; corazón noble, sencillo y angelical; cuyo carácter simpático y dulcisimo contrasta con la energía y fogosidad de sus ideas viriles, y entusiastas y tradicionalistas", ''La Tradición'' 06.01.00&lt;/ref&gt; she took up propaganda works also in public, commencing cooperation with the semi-official Carlist mouthpiece, ''El Correo Español''.&lt;ref&gt;and other party papers, like ''La Libertad'', ''La Libertad'' 16.08.02, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=1157352&amp;forma=&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 rumored even to launch her own [[Traditionalism (Spain)|Traditionalist]] daily,&lt;ref&gt;''La Correspondencia de España'' 08.04.00, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=7101402&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; at that time she was already known as "ilustre dama carlista".&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 17.04.00, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029801778&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

Her translation of Horace was acknowledged in a 1902 congratulation letter from the Carlist heir to the throne, [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Don Jaime]], two years her senior;&lt;ref&gt;Don Jaime wrote: "He leido con gran interés y verdadero placer la traducción de usted del Arte Poéticode Horacio, congratulándome infinito que tan hermosa traducción sea obra de una literata carlista tan entusiasta como usted. Aseguro á usted que este bello libro ocupará un lugar preferente en mi biblioteca", quoted after ''El Correo Español'' 06.09.02, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029804386&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt; since the prince has never developed particular interest in letters and it does not seem that the two had met before, the expression of sympathy remains somewhat mysterious. For the time being her Carlist zeal cooled down. During the Madrid schooling episode she seemed on perfect terms with the [[Alfonsism|Alfonsist]] royal family&lt;ref&gt;during a personal visit Gortázar with her daughter paid homage to queen mother, ''La Correspondencia de España'' 02.01.04, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000516046&amp;page=3/ here] Infanta Isabel acted as madrina at Gortázar’s second wedding, ''La Correspondencia de España'' 09.09.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=6&amp;path=7121806&amp;presentacion=pagina here]. Already prior to 1899 Infanta Isabel has even earned a dedicated poem, compare ''Nimias'', p. 13, available [http://bdh-rd.bne.es/viewer.vm?id=0000192808&amp;page=13 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the 1910s she published in [[Antonio Maura|Maurista]]&lt;ref&gt;compare ''La Lealtad'' 17.04.15, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=1145352&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and national-Catholic press.&lt;ref&gt;compare ''Renovación Española'' 11.07.18, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0003775751&amp;page=18 here]&lt;/ref&gt; However, Gortázar retained her Carlist link, together with the party pundits sporadically giving lectures at Traditionalism-flavored events.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. with [[Luis Hernando de Larramendi y Ruiz|Luis Hernando de Larramendi]], see ''La Lectura Dominical'' 05.07.13, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0001670265&amp;page=11 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

The climax of her Carlist activity fell on the years following the [[Mellismo|Mellista secession]]. In a huge 1919 front-page ''El Correo Español'' article she hailed [[El Cid|Cid]]-style loyalty to the king as a genuine virtue;&lt;ref&gt;and pointed to a "serpiente del odio", slipping into the heart of de Mella, ''El Correo Español'' 10.04.19, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029781355&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1920 she was listed active on numerous [[Jaime, Duke of Madrid|Jaimista]] meetings;&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 07.07.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029789854&amp;page=5 here], ''El Correo Español'' 02.03.20, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029782847&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1921 she became president of the Madrid Margaritas,&lt;ref&gt;at unspeficied time she launched and edited a dedicated Carlist feminine review, ''Las Margaritas'', short-lived due to financial problems, Antonio Manuel Moral Roncal, ''La cuestión religiosa en la Segunda República española'', Madrid 2009, {{ISBN|9788497429054}}, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; the Carlist feminine organization.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 15.03.21, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029783559&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; The same year she took part in Junta de [[Lourdes]], a grand Carlist assembly supposed to set a new political direction; immediately afterwards she published ''La Regeneración de España'',&lt;ref&gt;full title ''Dios, Patria, Rey. La regeneración de España. Impugnación del mellismo. Estudio político social de la Causa Tradicionalista, y reseña de la grandiosa Junta de Lourdes, que presidió don Jaime de Borbón y Borbón el día 7 de enero de 1921'', Madrid 1921, referred after [[Melchor Ferrer Dalmau|Melchor Ferrer]], ''Historia del tradicionalismo español'' vol. XXIX, Sevilla 1960, p. 307, see also ''El Correo Español'' 24.02.21, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029784849&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; a pamphlet assailing Mellismo and applauding the Lourdes program.&lt;ref&gt;''El Correo Español'' 01.03.21, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029784887&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; During some of the 1922 meetings she was seated next to the Jaimista leader, [[José Selva Mergelina|marqués de Villores]].&lt;ref&gt;''Las Provincias'' 13.04.22, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=5&amp;path=1000316947&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Flag of Cross of Burgundy.svg|thumb|Carlist standard]]
Collapse of ''El Correo Español'' deprived Gortázar of her key press tribune and advent of the [[Miguel Primo de Rivera|Primo de Rivera]] dictatorship brought political life to a standstill. She switched to other conservative periodicals,&lt;ref&gt;it seems that she also maintained some sort of co-operation with the Integrist ''El Siglo Futuro'', compare ''El Siglo Futuro'' 04.12.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0000464626&amp;page=4 here]&lt;/ref&gt; proudly boasting her friendship with Don Jaime,&lt;ref name="Las Provincias"&gt;''Las Provincias'' 15.03.25, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=9&amp;path=1000318624&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; hailing him as "nuestro caudillo"&lt;ref&gt;in 1927 Gortázar penned perhaps the most militant piece in her career, hailing Don Jaime on his namesday. The Carlist king was presented as champion of Christian values and Spanish tradition, a saviour not only of Spain, but also of the entire Europe, covered with "dark clouds". The article ended with "Viva el Rey!", compare ''El Eco de Gerona'' 06.08.27, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=3062718&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; and at times taking part in Traditionalism-flavored events.&lt;ref&gt;e.g. in homage to Francisco de Oller, ''El Eco de Gerona'' 05.11.27, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=1&amp;path=3062731&amp;presentacion=pagina here]&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 1920s she commenced close collaboration with a new Carlist weekly from Madrid, ''El Cruzado Español'',&lt;ref&gt;some scholars note her, among the ''Cruzado'' manager [[Jesús Cora y Lira]], as the key pen of the paper, Moral Roncal 2009, p. 37&lt;/ref&gt; hoping to convert it into a daily.&lt;ref&gt;José Luis Agudín Menéndez, ''Modernidad y tradicionalismo. La recepción de la instauración de la II República desde las páginas de El Siglo Futuro'', [in:] Damián A. González Madrid, Manuel Ortiz Heras, Juan Sisinio Pérez Garzón, ''La Historia, lost in translation? Actas del XIII Congreso de la Asociación de Historia Contemporanea'', Cuenca 2017, {{ISBN|9788490442654}}, p. 3223&lt;/ref&gt; At that time she was also awarded Ordén de la Legitimidad Proscrita, a high Carlist honor.&lt;ref name="El Siglo Futuro" /&gt; During late primoderiverismo and dictablanda she resumed more active stand, opening círculos,&lt;ref&gt;at times with de Villores, see ''El Cruzado Español'' 12.12.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005663&amp;page=8 here], Moral Roncal 2009, p. 37, also ''El Cruzado Español'' 02.08.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005024&amp;page=7 here]&lt;/ref&gt; featuring in headlines&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 15.11.29, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005159&amp;page=8 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and presiding over the Madrid Margaritas, mobilizing against "grandes privilegios a las mujeres rojas",&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 30.05.30, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005411&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; especially after declaration of the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republic]]. In course of its first years she remained active in the Carlist realm, though rather in the second if not the third row:&lt;ref&gt;the key work discussing Carlism during the Republic days, Martin Blinkhorn, ''Carlism and Crisis in Spain'', Cambridge 1975 [re-printed with no re-edition in 2008], {{ISBN|9780521086349}}, does not mention Gortazar a single time. Also the work discussing the Mellista breakout of the 1910s-1920s, Juan Ramón de Andrés Martín, ''El cisma mellista. Historia de una ambición política'', Madrid 2000, {{ISBN|9788487863820}}, does not list her. Finally, a key work on Carlism during the late Restoration period,  Agustín Fernández Escudero, ''El marqués de Cerralbo (1845-1922): biografía politica'' [PhD thesis Complutense], Madrid 2012, does not note Gortazar. All this suggests that in terms of forging Carlist politics she was irrelevant, important rather as a propagandist&lt;/ref&gt; Gortázar contributed to ''Cruzado'', presided over some meetings,&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 31.07.31, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029005690&amp;page=2 here]&lt;/ref&gt; opened new círculos,&lt;ref&gt;''El Cruzado Español'' 06.12.32, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0029022026&amp;page=1 here]&lt;/ref&gt; and gave lectures.&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 31.03.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/03/31/037.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1933 she was honorary president of the Madrid círculo;&lt;ref&gt;''ABC'' 16.05.33, available [http://hemeroteca.abc.es/nav/Navigate.exe/hemeroteca/madrid/abc/1933/05/16/038.html here]&lt;/ref&gt; in 1935 she contributed to electoral mobilization.&lt;ref&gt;''La Nación'' 21.02.35, available [http://hemerotecadigital.bne.es/issue.vm?id=0026337105&amp;page=3 here]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception and legacy==
[[File:Urval av de bocker som har vunnit Nordiska radets litteraturpris under de 50 ar som priset funnits (3).jpg|thumb|left]]

However, some acknowledged her standing as a poet and in 1910 she was even dedicated a poem, ''L avisador numantino'' 19.02.10, available [http://prensahistorica.mcu.es/es/catalogo_imagenes/grupo.cmd?interno=S&amp;posicion=2&amp;path=2219585&amp;presentacion=pagina here].

María Rosa Urraca Pastor, una estrella fugaz'' [MA thesis], Salamanca 2012, this comparison might be well applied personally to Dolores Gortázar. Gortázar clearly preferred feminine setting, Urraca had no problem engaging in mixed-sex initiatives. Gortázar excelled in small, dedicated groupings, Urraca starred in broad-scale, general organizations. Gortázar focused on cultural and educational activities, Urraca engaged in open politics. Gortázar was brilliant in behind-the-scene, closed meetings, Urraca was an excellent speaker at mass rallies&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The notion and speculation of communication via dreaming was first mooted in psychoanalysis by [[Sigmund Freud]] in 1921.&lt;ref name=Eshel&gt;Eshel, Ofra (December 2006). "Where are you, my beloved?: On absence, loss, and the enigma of telepathic dreams". ''[[The International Journal of Psychoanalysis]]'' 87 (6): 1603–1627.&lt;/ref&gt; He produced a model to express his ideas about telepathic dreaming.&lt;ref name=ullmanweb/&gt;  His 1922 paper ''Dreams and Telepathy'' is reproduced in the book ''Psychoanalysis and the Occult'' (1953) and was intended to be a lecture to the Vienna Psycho-Analytical Society, although he never delivered it.&lt;ref name=Eshel/&gt; Freud considered that a connection between telepathy and dreams could be neither proven nor disproven.  He was distinctly suspicious of the whole idea, noting that he himself had never had a telepathic dream. (His two dreams that were potentially telepathic, where he dreamed of the deaths of a son and of a sister-in-law, which did not occur, he labeled as "purely subjective anticipations".) His ideas were not widely accepted at the time, but he continued to publicly express his interest and findings about telepathic dreaming. He also observed that he had not encountered any evidence of dream telepathy in his patients.&lt;ref name=Eshel/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Frieden, Ken (1990). ''Freud's dream of interpretation''. SUNY series in modern Jewish literature and culture. SUNY Press. pp. 102-103. {{ISBN|978-0-7914-0124-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Freud claims neutrality about the phenomenon itself, states that the sleep milieu has special likely properties for it if it does exist, and discounts all of the cases presented to him on standard psychoanalytic grounds (e.g. neurosis, transference, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. Collected Papers, V. IV pp 408-435 International Psychoanalytic Library No. 7, Ed 1, Basic Books 1959 ''"Have I given you the impression that I am secretly inclined to support the reality of telepathy in the occult sense? If so, I should very much regret that it is so difficult to avoid giving such an impression. In reality, however, I was anxious to be strictly impartial. I have every reason to be so, for I have no opinion; I know nothing about it."'' p. 435. Here Freud explicitly refers to the conflation of telepathy as such with clairvoyance and other occult elements&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s [[Jule Eisenbud]], Geraldine Pederson-Krag and [[Nandor Fodor]] described alleged cases of dream telepathy. [[Albert Ellis]] regarded their conclusions to have been based upon flimsy evidence, and that they could be better explained by bias, [[coincidence]] and unconscious cues than by dream telepathy. He also accused them of an emotional involvement in the notion, resulting in their observations and judgement being clouded.&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Ellis|Ellis, Albert]]. (1947). ''Telepathy and Psychoanalysis: A Critique of Recent Findings''. Psychiatric Quarterly 21: 607-659.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Albert Ellis|Ellis, Albert]]. (1949). ''Re-analysis of an alleged telepathic dream''. Psychiatric Quarterly: 23: 116-126.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist L. Börje Löfgren also criticised dream telepathy experiments of Eisenbud. He stated that coincidence was a more likely explanation and the "assumption of paranormal forces to explain them is unnecessary."&lt;ref&gt;Löfgren, L. B. (1968). ''Recent Publications on Parapsychology''. ''[[Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association]]'' 16: 146-178.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experiments==
[[File:Montague Ullman.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Montague Ullman]] was notable for conducting dream telepathy experiments. His results were never replicated.&lt;ref name="Wiseman"&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2014). ''Night School: Wake Up to the Power of Sleep''. Macmillan. p. 202. {{ISBN|978-1-4472-4840-8}} Wiseman writes regarding Krippner and Ullman's experiments "Over the years, many researchers have failed to replicate their remarkable findings and, as a result, the work is seen as curious but not proof of the paranormal."&lt;/ref&gt;]]
There have been many experiments done to test the validity of dream telepathy and its effectiveness, but with significant issues of blinding. Many test subjects find ways to communicate with others to make it look like telepathic communication. Attempts to cut off communication between the agent, sender, and receiver of information failed because subjects found ways to get around blindfolds no matter how intricate and covering they were.&lt;ref&gt;McBroom, Patricia. (1967). ''Dreams, Art and Mental Telepathy''. Science News 92: 424.&lt;/ref&gt; In studies at the [[Maimonides Medical Center]] in [[Brooklyn|Brooklyn, New York]] led by [[Stanley Krippner]] and [[Montague Ullman]], patients were monitored and awakened after a period of REM then separated to study the claimed ability to communicate telepathically. They concluded the results from some of their experiments supported dream telepathy.&lt;ref name=ullmanweb /&gt;

The picture target experiments that were conducted by Krippner and Ullman were criticized by [[C. E. M. Hansel]]. According to Hansel there were weaknesses in the design of the experiments in the way in which the agent became aware of their target picture. Only the agent should have known the target and no other person until the judging of targets had been completed; however, an experimenter was with the agent when the target envelope was opened. Hansel also wrote there had been poor controls in the experiment as the main experimenter could communicate with the subject.&lt;ref&gt;[[C. E. M. Hansel|Hansel, C. E. M.]] ''The Search for a Demonstration of ESP''. In [[Paul Kurtz]]. (1985). ''A Skeptic's Handbook of Parapsychology''. Prometheus Books. pp. 97-127. {{ISBN|0-87975-300-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An attempt to replicate the experiments that used picture targets was carried out by Edward Belvedere and David Foulkes. The finding was that neither the subject nor the judges matched the targets with dreams above chance level.&lt;ref&gt;Belvedere, E., Foulkes, D. (1971). ''Telepathy and Dreams: A Failure to Replicate''. Perceptual and Motor Skills 33: 783–789.&lt;/ref&gt; Results from other experiments by Belvedere and Foulkes were also negative.&lt;ref name=Hansel1989/&gt;

In 2003, Simon Sherwood and Chris Roe wrote a review that claimed support for dream telepathy at Maimonides.&lt;ref&gt;Sherwood, S. J; Roe, C. A. (2003). ''A Review of Dream ESP Studies Conducted Since the Maimonides Dream ESP Programme''. Journal of Consciousness Studies, 10: 85-109.&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[James Alcock]] noted that their review was based on "extreme messiness" of data. Alcock concluded the dream telepathy experiments at Maimonides have failed to provide evidence for telepathy and "lack of replication is rampant."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Alcock|Alcock, James]]. (2003). ''Give the Null Hypothesis a Chance: Reasons to Remain Doubtful about the Existence of Psi''. Journal of Consciousness Studies 10: 29-50. "In their article, Sherwood and Roe examine attempts to replicate the well-known Maimonides dream studies that began in the 1960s. They provide a good review of these studies of dream telepathy and clairvoyance, but if one thing emerges for me from their review, it is the extreme messiness of the data adduced. Lack of replication is rampant. While one would normally expect that continuing scientific scrutiny of a phenomenon should lead to stronger effect sizes as one learns more about the subject matter and refines the methodology, this is apparently not the case with this research."&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychologist and noted skeptic [[Richard Wiseman]] took part in a dream telepathy experiment. It was conducted by [[Caroline Watt]] at a sleep laboratory in an attempt to replicate the results of Krippner and Ullman. The experiment was a complete failure. According to Wiseman "after monitoring about twenty volunteers for several nights on end, the study didn't discover any evidence in support of the supernatural."&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Wiseman|Wiseman, Richard]]. (2014). ''Night School: Wake Up to the Power of Sleep''. Macmillan. pp. 200-201. {{ISBN|978-1-4472-4840-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ese Ejja''' (Ese’eha, Eseʼexa, Ese exa), also known as '''Tiatinagua''' (Tatinawa), is a [[Tacanan language]] of Bolivia and Peru. It is spoken by [[Ese Ejja people]] of all ages.  Dialects are Guacanawa (Guarayo/Huarayo), Baguaja, Echoja, and possibly extinct Chama, Chuncho, Huanayo, Kinaki, and Mohino. Chunene is "similar" to Ese Ejja, though whether a dialect or a separate language is not clear.&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|pano1259|Pano-Tacanan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ese Ejja has ejective consonants such as {{IPA|/kʼ/}} as well as voiceless implosives such as {{IPA|/ɓ̥/}}.

== Historical, social and cultural characteristics ==
=== Usage and distribution ===
Ese Ejja is spoken in the [[La Paz Department (Bolivia)|La Paz]], [[Beni Department|Beni]], and [[Pando Department|Pando]] departments of Bolivia (in the provinces of Iturralde, Ballivián, Vaca Diez, and Madre de Dios) on the [[Beni River|Beni]] and [[Madre de Dios River|Madre de Dios]] rivers; and in the [[Madre de Dios Region|Madre de Dios]] and [[Puno Region|Puno]] regions of Peru. According to Alexiades &amp; Peluso (2009), there are approximately 1,500 Ese Ejja, distributed among different communities in Peru and Bolivia. The Bolivian Ese Ejja are divided into two clans: the Quijati, around the Riberalta region; and the Hepahuatahe in the Rurenabaque region. Crevels &amp; Muysken (2009:15) write that in Bolivia there were 518 Ese Ejja speakers (of four years of age and older), and therefore is an endangered language. Some names used to refer to the language are Ese'eha, Chama, and Warayo; Chama is a pejorative regional name, and Guarayo is also the name of a Tupí-Guaraní language. In Peru the Ese Ejja language (Guacanahua, Echoja, Chuncho) is spoken along the Madre de Dios and [[Tambopata River|Tambopata]] rivers and at their sources in three locations: Sonene, Palma Real, and Infierno. Ese Ejja is also seriously threatened in Peru, with 840 speakers in an ethnic group of the same size.

'''Faroese'''&lt;ref&gt;While the spelling ''Faeroese'' is also seen, ''Faroese'' is the spelling used in grammars, textbooks, scientific articles and dictionaries between Faroese and English.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|f|ɛər|oʊ|ˈ|iː|z|,_|-|ˈ|iː|s}}; {{lang-fo|føroyskt mál|links=no}}, {{IPA-fo|ˈføːɹɪst mɔaːl|pron}}) is a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]] spoken as a [[first language]] by about 72,000 people, 51,000 of whom reside on the [[Faroe Islands]] and 21,000 in other areas, mainly [[Denmark]]. It is one of five languages descended from [[Old Norse#Old West Norse|Old West Norse]] spoken in the [[Middle Ages]], the others being [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]], and the extinct [[Norn language|Norn]] and [[Greenlandic Norse]]. Faroese and Icelandic, its closest extant relative, are not mutually intelligible in speech, but the written languages resemble each other quite closely, largely owing to Faroese's [[Orthographic depth|etymological orthography]].&lt;ref name="BarbourCarmichael2000"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barbour|first1=Stephen|last2=Carmichael|first2=Cathie|title=Language and Nationalism in Europe|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1ixmu8Iga7gC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2000|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-158407-7|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Sheep Letter, p 1.jpg|thumb|left|The [[Sheep letter]] ({{lang-fo|Seyðabrævið}}) is the oldest surviving document of the Faroe Islands.

Around 900, the language spoken in the Faroes was [[Old Norse]], which Norse settlers had brought with them during the time of the settlement of Faroe Islands (''landnám'') that began in 825. However, many of the settlers were not from [[Scandinavia]], but descendants of Norse settlers in the [[Irish Sea]] region. In addition, women from Norse Ireland, [[Orkney]], or [[Shetland]] often married native Scandinavian men before settling in the Faroe Islands and Iceland.  As a result, the [[Irish language]] has had some influence on both Faroese and [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]]. There is some debatable evidence of Irish language place names in the Faroes: for example, the names of [[Mykines, Faroe Islands|Mykines]], [[Stóra Dímun]], [[Lítla Dímun]] and [[Argir]] have been hypothesized to contain Celtic roots. Other examples of early-introduced words of Celtic origin are: "blak/blaðak" ([[buttermilk]]), cf. [[Middle Irish]] ''bláthach''; "drunnur" (tail-piece of an animal), cf. Middle Irish ''dronn'';  "grúkur" ([[head]], headhair), cf. Middle Irish ''gruaig''; "lámur" ([[hand]], [[paw]]), cf. Middle Irish ''lámh''; "tarvur" ([[bull]]), cf. Middle Irish ''tarbh''; and "ærgi" ([[pasture]] in the [[outfield]]), cf. Middle Irish ''áirge''.&lt;ref&gt;Chr. Matras. Greinaval – málfrøðigreinir. FØROYA FRÓÐSKAPARFELAG 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

Between the 9th and the 15th centuries, a distinct Faroese language evolved, although it was probably still mutually intelligible with [[Old West Norse language|Old West Norse]], and remained similar to the [[Norn language]] of [[Orkney]] and Shetland during Norn's earlier phase.

Faroese ceased to be a written language after the union of Norway with Denmark in 1380, with Danish replacing Faroese as the language of administration and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uv.es/capelo/thefaroeselanguage.html|title=The Faroese Language|website=www.uv.es|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The islanders continued to use the language in [[ballad]]s, [[folklore|folktales]], and everyday life. This maintained a rich [[Oral history|spoken tradition]], but for 300 years the language was not used in written form.

In 1823 the Danish Bible Society published a diglot of the Gospel of Matthew, with Faroese on the left and Danish on the right.

[[Venceslaus Ulricus Hammershaimb]] and the Icelandic grammarian and politician [[Jón Sigurðsson]] published a written standard for Modern Faroese in 1854, which still exists.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/Faroese-language|title=Faroese language|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; They set a standard for the [[orthography]] of the language, based on its Old Norse roots and similar to that of Icelandic. This had the advantage of being etymologically clear, as well as keeping the kinship with the Icelandic written language. The actual pronunciation, however, often differs from the written rendering. The letter [[ð]], for example, has no specific [[phoneme]] attached to it.

[[Jakob Jakobsen]] devised a rival system of orthography, based on his wish for a phonetic spelling, but this system was never taken up by the speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://snar.fo/tema-og-tvoergreinalig-evni/skaldskapur-og-midlar/rithoevundar/j/jakobsen-jakob/|title=Snar.fo, Jakob Jakobsen (1864-1918)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 [[Scripture Gift Mission]] published the Gospel of John in Faroese.

In 1937, Faroese replaced [[Danish language|Danish]] as the official school language, in 1938 as the church language, and in 1948 as the national language by the Home Rule Act of the Faroes. However, Faroese did not become the common language of media and advertising until the 1980s.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} Today Danish is considered a foreign language, although around 5% of residents on the Faroes learn it as a first language, and it is a required subject for students in third grade&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.logir.fo/system/foframe.htm Logir.fo – Homepage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081215092520/http://www.logir.fo/system/foframe.htm |date=2008-12-15 }} Database of laws on the Faroe Islands {{fo icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and up.

The Visit Faroese tourism organisation launched the Faroe Islands Translate online service in 2017, available in English and another 13 languages including Chinese, Russian, Japanese, and Portuguese. A Faroese video database has also been built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-41524790|title=Faroe Islands launch live translation service |date=2017-10-06|website=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Faroese==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2016}}
Old Faroese (''miðaldarføroyskt'', ca. mid-14th to mid-16th centuries) is a form of [[Old Norse]] spoken in medieval times in the Faroe Islands. The language shares many features with both Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian; Old Norwegian appears closer to Old Faroese, whereas Old Icelandic remained rather archaic compared to other medieval varieties of Old West Norse. The most crucial aspects of the development of Faroese are diphthongisation and palatalisation.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}

There is not enough data available to establish an accurate chronology of Faroese, but a rough one may be developed through comparison to the chronologies of Old Icelandic and Old Norwegian. In the 12th/13th centuries, ''á'' and ''ǫ́'' merged as {{IPA|/ɔː/}}; later on at the beginning of the 14th century, delabialization took place: ''y'', ''øy'', ''au'' &gt; /i, ɔi, ɛi/; ''í'' and ''ý'' merged in addition to ''i'' and ''y'', but in the case of ''í'' and ''ý'', it appears that labialisation took place instead as is documented by later development to {{IPA|/ʊɪ/}}. Further, the language underwent a palatalisation of ''k'', ''g'' and ''sk'' before [[Old Norse]] ''e'', ''i'', ''y'', ''ø'', ''au'' &gt; {{IPA|/k&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;, ɡ&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;, sk&lt;sup&gt;j&lt;/sup&gt;/}} &gt; {{IPA|/c&lt;sup&gt;ç&lt;/sup&gt;, ɟ&lt;sup&gt;ʝ&lt;/sup&gt;, ɕc&lt;sup&gt;ç&lt;/sup&gt;/}} &gt; {{IPA|/tʃʰ, tʃ, ʃ/}}. Before the palatalisation ''é'' and ''ǽ'' merged as {{IPA|/ɛː/}} and approximately in the same period [[epenthesis|epenthetic]] ''u'' is inserted into word-final {{IPA|/Cr/}} and {{IPA|/CrC/}} clusters. The Great Quantity Shift{{citation needed|date=January 2016|reason=Is it really called this in the literature?}} operated in the 15th/16th centuries. In the case of [[Faroese phonology#Skerping|''skerping'']], it took place after delabialization but before loss of post-vocalic ''ð'' and ''g'' {{IPA|/ɣ/}}. The shift of ''hv'' {{IPA|/hw/}} to {{IPA|/kw/}}, the deletion of {{IPA|/h/}} in (remaining) word-initial {{IPA|/h/}}–sonorant clusters (''hr'', ''hl'', ''hn'' &gt; ''r'', ''l'', ''n''), and the dissolution of ''þ'' (''þ'' &gt; ''t''; ''þ'' &gt; ''h'' in demonstrative pronouns and adverbs)&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Petersen|first=Hjalmar P.|title=The Change of ''þ'' to ''h'' in Faroese |url=https://setur.fo/uploads/tx_tcpublications/Petersen_HP_The_Change_of_%C3%BE_to_h.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; appeared before the end of the 13th century. Another undated change is the merger of ''ǫ'', ''ø'' and ''ǿ'' into {{IPA|/ø/}}; pre-nasal ''ǫ'', ''ǫ́'' &gt; ''o'', ''ó''. ''enk'', ''eng'' probably became ''eing'', ''eink'' in the 14th century; the development of ''a'' to {{IPA|/ɛ/}} before ''ng'', ''nk'' appeared after the palatalisation of ''k'', ''g'', and ''sk'' had been completed, such a change is quite a recent development, as well as change ''Cve'' &gt; ''Cvø''.

As with most other Germanic languages, Faroese has a large number of vowels, with 26 in total.  Vowel distribution is similar to other North Germanic languages in that short vowels appear in closed syllables (those ending in consonant clusters or long consonants) and long vowels appearing in open syllables. {{Harvcoltxt|Árnason|2011}} provides the following alternations:

Faroese shares with Icelandic and Danish the feature of maintaining a contrast between stops based exclusively on aspiration, not voicing. Geminated stops may be pre-aspirated in intervocalic and word-final position. Intervocalically the aspirated consonants become pre-aspirated unless followed by a closed vowel. In clusters, the preaspiration merges with a preceding nasal or apical approximant, rendering them voiceless.

There are several [[phonology|phonological]] processes involved in Faroese, including:
*Nasals generally assume the place of articulation and laryngeal settings of following consonants.
*Velar stops palatalize to postalveolar affricates before {{IPA|/j/ /eː/ /ɛ/ /iː/ /ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ɛi/}}
*{{IPA|/v/}} becomes {{IPA|[f]}} before voiceless consonants
*{{IPA|/sk/}} becomes {{IPA|[ʃ]}} after {{IPA|/ɛi, ai, ɔi/}} and before {{IPA|/j/}}
*{{IPA|/ɹ/}} becomes retroflex following consonants in consonant clusters, yielding the allophones {{IPA|[ʂ ɭ ʈ ɳ]}} while {{IPA|/ɹ/}} itself becomes {{IPA|[ɻ]}}, example: {{IPA|/rt/}} is realized as {{IPA|[ɻ̊ʈ]}}.
*[[Pre-occlusion]] of original {{IPA|/ll/}} to {{IPA|[tl]}} and {{IPA|/nn/}} to {{IPA|[tn]}}.
*Pre-aspiration of original voiceless stops {{IPA|[ʰp ʰt ʰk ʰtʃ]}} after non-high long vowels and diphthongs {{IPA|/ɛaː/ /ɔaː/ /eː/ /oː/ /øː/}} or when a voiceless stop is followed by /n, l, r/. All long voiceless stops are pre-aspirated when doubled or in clusters {{IPA|[ʰpː ʰtː ʰkː ʰtʃː]}}.

==Grammar==
{{Main|Faroese grammar}}
Faroese grammar is related and very similar to that of modern [[Icelandic grammar|Icelandic]] and [[Old Norse]]. Faroese is an [[inflected language]] with three [[grammatical gender]]s and four [[grammatical case|cases]]: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[accusative case|accusative]], [[dative case|dative]] and [[genitive case|genitive]].

[[Image:John Walsh filming a segment for America's Most Wanted.jpg|thumb|right|Fugitives are often profiled in the media in order to be apprehended, such as in the TV show ''[[America's Most Wanted]]''.]]

A '''fugitive''' (or '''runaway''') is a person who is fleeing from [[police custody|custody]], whether it be from [[jail]], a government [[arrest]], government or non-government [[interrogation|questioning]], [[vigilante]] violence, or outraged private individuals. A fugitive from justice, also known as a wanted person, can be a person who is either convicted or accused of a crime and hiding from law enforcement in the state or taking refuge in a different country in order to avoid arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/Fugitive+from+Justice |title=Fugitive from Justice legal definition of Fugitive from Justice. Fugitive from Justice synonyms by the Free Online Law Dictionary |publisher=Legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fugitive from justice alternatively has been defined as a person formally charged with a crime or a convicted criminal whose punishment has not yet been determined or fully served who is currently beyond the custody or control of the national or sub-national government or international criminal tribunal with an interest in his or her arrest. This latter definition adopts the perspective of the pursuing government or tribunal, recognizing that the charged (versus escaped) individual does not necessarily realize that they are officially a wanted person (e.g., due to a case of mistaken identity or reliance on a sealed indictment), and therefore may not be fleeing, hiding, or taking refuge to avoid arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bringing_International_Fugitives_to_Just.html?id=iSvUjwEACAAJ|title=Bringing International Fugitives to Justice: Extradition and its Alternatives|last=Sadoff|first=David A.|date=2016-12-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107129283|location=|pages=30-31, 33|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fugitive from justice is ‘international’ (versus ‘domestic’) if wanted by law enforcement authorities across a national border.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Bringing_International_Fugitives_to_Just.html?id=iSvUjwEACAAJ|title=Bringing International Fugitives to Justice: Extradition and its Alternatives|last=Sadoff|first=David A.|date=2016-12-24|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=|isbn=9781107129283|location=|pages=30|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Interpol]] is the international organization with no legal authority to directly pursue or detain fugitives of any kind.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.interpol.int/About-INTERPOL/Legal-materials|title=Legal materials / About INTERPOL / Internet / Home - INTERPOL|author=|date=|website=www.interpol.int}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Europol]] is the European authority for the pursuit of fugitives who are on the run within Europe, and coordinates their search, while national authorities in the probable country of their stay coordinate their arrest. In the [[United States]], the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] is the primary [[law enforcement agency]] that tracks down federal fugitives, though the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] also tracks fugitives.

As a verbal metaphor and psychological concept, one might also be described as a "fugitive from oneself".  Finally, the literary sense of "fugitive" includes the meaning of simply "fleeing".
&lt;!--
For what may be considered obvious reasons, fugitives generally avoid contact with individuals from their home countries.  However, they might spend much time on the [[Internet]] to fulfill the basic daily need for conversation, especially if they are unable to communicate well with the people in their new country.  --&gt;

In many jurisdictions, a fugitive who flees custody while a trial is underway loses the right to [[appeal]] any convictions or sentences imposed on him, since the act of fleeing is deemed to flout the court's authority.  Recently, convicted rapist [[Andrew Luster]] had his appeals denied on the basis that he spent six months as a fugitive (he was [[trial in absentia|convicted ''in absentia'']]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov/search/dockets.cfm?dist=0&amp;doc_id=276365|title=California Courts - Appellate Court Case Information|author=|date=|website=appellatecases.courtinfo.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[{{SCOTUS URL Docket|03-854}} Supreme Court of the United States Docket for 03-854, Andrew Stuart v. California] December 11, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fl1.findlaw.com/news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/luster/caluster62003agmot.pdf|title=Legal Blog Network - FindLaw|author=|date=|website=Findlaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terminology==
While a person is being sought for potential arrest, the person may be described variously as being "at large" or as a "[[person of interest]]" to law enforcement. The latter term is frequently used in an "[[All-points bulletin]]" issued to other law enforcement persons or agencies. A person who has [[jumped bail]] after [[arraignment]] in court may be hunted or pursued by his [[bail bondsman]], and a [[Bounty (reward)|bounty]] may be "on his head." The act of fleeing from the jurisdiction of a court is described colloquially as "fleeing justice" or "running from the Law." A "[[wanted poster]]" may be issued, especially by the FBI, culminating in the "[[FBI's Most Wanted List]]" of fugitives.

"On the lam" or "on the run" often refers to fugitives. [[Mencken]]'s ''[[The American Language]]'' and ''The Thesaurus of American Slang'' proclaim that lam, lamister, and "on the lam"—all referring to a hasty departure—were common in thieves' slang before the turn of the 20th century. Mencken quotes a newspaper report on the origin of 'lam' which actually traces it indirectly back to Shakespeare's time.

{{quote|Its origin should be obvious to anyone who runs over several colloquial phrases for leavetaking, such as 'beat it' and 'hit the trail'. The allusion in 'lam' is to 'beat,' and 'beat it' is Old English, meaning 'to leave.' During the period of George Ade's 'Fables in Slang' (1900), cabaret society delight in talking slang, and 'lam' was current. Like many other terms, it went under in the flood of new usages of those days, but was preserved in criminal slang. A quarter of a century later it reappeared.}}

Mencken also quotes a story from the ''[[New York Herald Tribune]]'' newspaper in 1938 which reported that "one of the oldest police officers in New York said that he had heard 'on the lam' thirty years ago."

==Methods of finding fugitives==
Various methods&lt;ref name="Cognitive Protocols and Mechanism for Fugitive Interdiction"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nyagudi|first1=Nyagudi Musandu|title=Intelligence Studies in Forensic Criminology of Fugitive Emanating Definitive and Locational Parameters - dissertation without errata|url=http://files.figshare.com/1650229/NMusandu.pdf|website=Figshare|publisher=Figshare repository|accessdate=11 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be used to find fugitives. [[Phone tap]]s and [[pen register]]s can be used on relatives. Credit card and cell phone activities and [[electronic transfer of money]] can also be traced. [[Wanted poster]]s and rewards can also be used.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Most-Wanted: How Officials Find Fugitives|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/transcript/transcript.php?storyId=18381992}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jail records are also sometimes used; for instance, after the U.S. Government determined that [[Timothy McVeigh]] had perpetrated the [[Oklahoma City Bombing]], he was found in a local jail.

'''Gilla Mochua Ó Caiside''', [[Irish people|Irish]] [[poet]], [[Floruit|fl.]] 12th century.

[[Cassidy (surname)|Ó Caiside]] was a member of a family situated in what is now [[County Fermanagh]]. The Ó Caisides were originally a medical family, who were [[hereditary]] physicians to the [[Maguire (surname)|Maguire]]s. A group of poems attributed to him survive; they were printed by C. Plummer in 1922.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30004">The '''global language system''' is the "ingenious pattern of connections between language groups".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"&gt;{{cite book|last1=de Swaan|first1=Abram|title=Words of the world: The Global Language System|date=2001|publisher=Polity Press|location=Malden, Mass.|isbn=9780745627472|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AFH8i82oteYC&amp;pg=PA5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Dutch [[sociologist]] [[Abram de Swaan]] developed this theory in 2001 in his book ''Words of the World: The Global Language System'' and according to him, "the multilingual connections between language groups do not occur haphazardly, but, on the contrary, they constitute a surprisingly strong and efficient network that ties together – directly or indirectly – the six billion inhabitants of the earth."&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; The global language system draws upon the [[World-systems theory|world system theory]] to account for the relationships between the world's languages and divides them into a hierarchy consisting of [[#Characteristics|four levels]], namely the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages.

==Theory==

===Background===
According to de Swaan, the global language system has been constantly evolving since the time period of the early 'military-agrarian' regimes.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; Under these regimes, the rulers imposed their own language and so the first 'central' languages emerged, linking the peripheral languages of the agrarian communities via bilingual speakers to the language of the conquerors. Then was the formation of empires, which resulted in the next stage of integration of the world language system.

Firstly, Latin emerged from Rome. Under the rule of the [[Roman Empire]], under which an extensive group of states were ruled by, the usage of Latin stretched along the Mediterranean coast, the southern half of Europe, and more sparsely to the North and then into the Germanic and Celtic lands. Thus, Latin evolved to become a central language in Europe from 27 BC to 476 AD.

Secondly, there was the widespread usage of the pre-classical version of Han Chinese in contemporary China due to the unification of China in 221 BC by [[Qin Shi Huang]].

Thirdly, [[Sanskrit]] started to become widely spoken in South Asia from the widespread teaching of [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]] in South Asian countries.

Fourthly, the expansion of the Arabic empire also led to the increased usage of Arabic as a language in the Afro-Eurasian land mass.

Military conquests of preceding centuries generally determine the distribution of languages today.
Supercentral languages spread by land and sea. Land-bound languages spread via marching empires: [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Hindi]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]] and [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. However, when the conquerors were defeated and were forced to move out of the territory, the spread of the languages receded. As a result, some of these languages are currently barely supercentral languages and are instead confined to their remaining state territories, as is evident from German, Russian and Japanese.

On the other hand, sea-bound languages spread by conquests overseas: [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]]. Consequently, these languages became widespread in areas settled by European colonisers and relegated the indigenous people and their languages to peripheral positions.

Besides, the [[world-systems theory]] also allowed the global language system to expand further. It focuses on the existence of the core, semi-peripheral and peripheral nations. The [[core countries]] are the most economically powerful and the wealthiest countries. Besides, they also have a strong governmental system in the country, which oversees the bureaucracies in the governmental departments. There is also the prevalent existence of the [[bourgeois]], and core nations have significant influence over the non-core, smaller nations. Historically, the core countries were found in northwestern Europe and include countries such as England, France and the Netherlands. They were the dominant countries that had colonized many other nations from the early 15th century to the early 19th century.

Then is the existence of the [[periphery countries]], the countries with the slowest economic growth. They also have relatively weak governments and a poor social structure and often depend on primary industries as the main source of economic activity for the country.

The extracting and exporting of raw materials from the peripheral nations to core nations is the activity bringing about the most economic benefits to the country. Much of the population that is poor and uneducated, and the countries are also extensively influenced by core nations and the multinational corporations found there. Historically, peripheral nations were found outside Europe, the continent of colonial masters. Many countries in [[Latin America]] were peripheral nations during the period of colonization, and today peripheral countries are in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].

Lastly, the presence of the [[semiperiphery countries]], those in between the core and the periphery. They tend to be those which started out as peripheral nations and are currently moving towards industrialization and the development of more diversified labour markets and economies. They can as well come about from declining core countries. They are not dominant players in the international trade market. As compared to the peripheral nations, semi-peripheries are not as susceptible to manipulation by the core countries. However, most of these nations have economic or political relations with the core. Semi-peripheries also tend to exert influence and control over peripheries and can serve to be a buffer between the core and peripheral nations and ease political tensions. Historically, Spain and Portugal were semi-peripheral nations after they fell from their dominant core positions. As they still maintained a certain level of influence and dominance in Latin America over their colonies, they could still maintain their semi-peripheral position.

According to [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], one of the most well-known theorists who developed the world-systems approach, a core nation is dominant over the non-core nations from its economic and trade dominance. The abundance of cheap and unskilled labour in the peripheral nations makes many large [[multinational corporations]] (MNCs), from core countries, often outsource their production to the peripheral countries to cut costs, by employing cheap labour. Hence, the languages from the core countries could penetrate into the peripheries from the setting up of the foreign MNCs in the peripheries. A significant percentage of the population living in the core countries had also migrated to the core countries in search of jobs with higher wages.

The gradual expansion of the population of migrants makes the language used in their home countries be brought into the core countries, thus allowing for further integration and expansion of the world language system. The semi-peripheries also maintain economic and financial trade with the peripheries and core countries. That allows for the penetration of languages used in the semi-peripheries into the core and peripheral nations, with the flow of migrants moving out of the semi-peripheral nations to the core and periphery for trade purposes.

Thus, the global language system examines rivalries and accommodations using a global perspective and establishes that the linguistic dimension of the world system goes hand in hand with the political, economic, cultural and ecological aspects. Specifically, the present global constellation of languages is the product of prior conquest and domination and of ongoing relations of power and exchange.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

===Q-value===
&lt;math&gt;Q_i&lt;/math&gt; is the communicative value of a language ''i'', its potential to connect a speaker with other speakers of a constellation or subconstellation, "S".  It is defined as follows:

&lt;math&gt;Q_i=p_i \times c_i = \left ( \frac{P_i}{N^S} \right ) \times \left ( \frac{C_i}{M^S} \right ) &lt;/math&gt;

The prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i'', means the number of competent speakers in ''i'',  &lt;math&gt;P_i&lt;/math&gt;, divided by all the speakers, &lt;math&gt;N^S&lt;/math&gt; of constellation ''S''. Centrality, &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; is the number of multilingual speakers &lt;math&gt;C_i&lt;/math&gt; who speak language ''i'' divided by all the multilingual speakers in constellation ''S'',  &lt;math&gt;M^S&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, the Q-value or communication value is the product of the prevalence &lt;math&gt;p_i&lt;/math&gt; and the centrality &lt;math&gt;c_i&lt;/math&gt; of language ''i''  in constellation ''S''.

Consequently, a peripheral language has a low Q-value and the Q-values increase along the sociology classification of languages, with the Q-value of the hypercentral language being the highest.

De Swaan has been calculating the Q-values of the official [[European Union]](EU) languages since 1957 to explain the acquisition of languages by EU citizens in different phases.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007"&gt;{{cite book |last=de Swaan |first=Abram |editor-last=Ammon |editor-first=Ulrich |editorlink1=Ulrich Ammon |editor2-last=Mattheier |editor2-first=Klaus J. |editor3-last=Nelde |editor3-first=Peter H. |title=Sociolinguistica: International Yearbook of European Sociolinguistics, Vol. 21: Linguistic Consequences of the EU-Enlargement |publisher=Tübingen |date=2007 |pages=1–21 |chapter=The language predicament of the EU since the enlargements [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=Ao2XIClUKd8C&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=The+language+predicament+of+the+EU+since+the+enlargements.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=93hHwBadOP&amp;sig=DewiQDKr-XCxt81IDwkRxLRFa-Y&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=plxAVOfjAc6RuATT1oGQDw&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-3-484-60490-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, when there were only four language constellations, Q-value decreased in the order of French, German, Italian, Dutch. In 1975, the [[European Commission]] enlarged to include Britain, Denmark and Ireland. English had the highest Q-value followed by French and German.
In the following years, the European Commission grew, with the addition of countries like Austria, Finland and Sweden. Q-value of English still remained the highest, but French and German swapped places.

In EU23, which refers to the 23 official languages spoken in the [[European Union]], the Q-values for English, German and French were 0.194, 0.045 and 0.036 respectively.

===Theoretical framework===
De Swaan likens the global language system to contemporary political [[macrosociology]] and states that language constellations are a social phenomenon, which can be understood by using social science theories. In his theory, de Swaan uses the [[#Political Sociology of Language|Political Sociology of Language]] and [[#Political Economy of Language|Political Economy of Language]] to explain the rivalry and accommodation between language groups.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Political sociology====
This theoretical perspective centres on the interconnections among the state, nation and citizenship. Accordingly, bilingual elite groups try to take control of the opportunities for mediation between the monolingual group and the state. Subsequently, they use the official language to dominate the sectors of government and administration and the higher levels of employment. It assumes that both the established and outsider groups are able to communicate in a shared vernacular, but the latter groups lack the literacy skills that could allow them to learn the written form of the central or supercentral language, which would, in turn allow, them to move up the social ladder.

====Political economy====
This perspective centres on the inclinations that people have towards learning one language over the other. The presumption is that if given a chance, people will learn the language that gives them more communication advantage. In other words, a higher [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]]. Certain languages such as English or Chinese have high Q-values since they are spoken in many countries across the globe and would thus be more economically useful than to less spoken languages, such as Romanian or Hungarian.

From an economic perspective, languages are ‘hypercollective’ goods since they exhibit properties of [[collective goods]] and produce external network effects. Thus, the more speakers a language has, the higher its communication value for each speaker. The hypercollective nature and [[#Q-Value|Q-Value]] of languages thus help to explain the dilemma that a speaker of a peripheral language faces when deciding whether to learn the central or hypercentral language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also help to explain the accelerating spread and abandonment of various languages. In that sense, when people feel that a language is gaining new speakers, they would assign a greater Q-value to this language and abandon their own [[firzt language|native]] language in place of a more central language. The hypercollective nature and Q-value also explain, in an economic sense, the ethnic and cultural movements for language conservation.

Specifically, a minimal Q-value of a language is guaranteed when there is a critical mass of speakers committed to protecting it, thus preventing the language from being forsaken.

===Characteristics===
The global language system theorises that language groups are engaged in unequal competition on different levels globally. Using the notions of a periphery, semi-periphery and a core, which are concepts of the [[world system theory]], de Swaan relates them to the four levels present in the hierarchy of the global language system: peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

De Swaan also argues that the greater the range of potential uses and users of a language, the higher the tendency of an individual to move up the hierarchy in the global language system and learn a more "central" language. Thus, de Swaan views the learning of [[second language]]s as proceeding up rather than down the hierarchy, in the sense that they learn a language that is on the next level up. For instance, speakers of Catalan, a peripheral language, have to learn Spanish, a [[#Central languages|central language]] to function in their own society, Spain. Meanwhile, speakers of Persian, a central language, have to learn Arabic, a [[#Supercentral languages|supercentral language]], to function in their region. On the other hand, speakers of a supercentral language have to learn the [[#Hypercentral languages|hypercentral language]] to function globally, as is evident from the huge number of non-native English speakers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=Vivian|title=Second language learning and language teaching|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|url=https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=Ma0uAgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Second+Language+Learning+and+Language+Teaching+Fourth+Edition&amp;ots=uXerrKESf8&amp;sig=In7biboNQq0s5b_8fPB6y9fF4-s#v=onepage&amp;q=Second%20Language%20Learning%20and%20Language%20Teaching%20Fourth%20Edition&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to de Swaan, languages exist in "constellations" and the global language system comprises a sociological classification of [[language]]s based on their social role for their speakers. The world's languages and multilinguals are connected in a strongly ordered, hierarchical pattern. There are thousands of peripheral or minority languages in the world, each of which are connected to one of a hundred central languages. The connections and patterns between each language is what makes up the global language system. The four levels of language are the peripheral, central, supercentral and hypercentral languages.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

[[File:Hierarchy of the global language system (adapted from de Swaan, 2001).jpg|thumb|This flowchart depicts the hierarchy of the languages in de Swaan's (2001) global language system theory.]]

====Peripheral languages====
At the lowest level, peripheral languages, or [[minority languages]], form the majority of languages spoken in the world; 98% of the world's languages are peripheral languages and spoken by less than 10% of the world’s population. Unlike central languages, these are "languages of conversation and narration rather than reading and writing, of memory and remembrance rather than record".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt; They are used by native speakers within a particular area and are in danger of becoming extinct with increasing globalisation, which sees more and more speakers of peripheral languages acquiring more central languages in order to communicate with others.

====Central languages====
The next level constitutes about 100 central languages, spoken by 95% of the world's population and generally used in education, media and administration. Typically, they are the 'national' and [[official languages]] of the ruling state. These are the languages of record, and much of what has been said and written in those languages is saved in newspaper reports, minutes and proceedings, stored in archives, included in history books, collections of the 'classics', of folk talks and folk ways, increasingly recorded on electronic media and thus conserved for posterity.&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

Many speakers of central languages are [[multilingual]] because they are either native speakers of a peripheral language and have acquired the central language, or they are native speakers of the central language and have learned a supercentral language.

====Supercentral languages====
At the second highest level, 13 supercentral languages are very widely spoken languages that serve as connectors between speakers of central languages: [[Arabic]], [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[German language|German]], [[Hindi]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]], [[Malay language|Malay]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Russian language|Russian]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Swahili language|Swahili]] and [[Turkish language|Turkish]].

These languages often have colonial traces and "were once imposed by a colonial power and after independence continued to be used in politics, administration, law, big business, technology and higher education".&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2001"/&gt;

====Hypercentral languages====
At the highest level is the language that connects speakers of the supercentral languages. Today, [[English language|English]] is the only example of a hypercentral language as the standard for science, literature, business, and law, as well as being the most widely spoken [[Second language|second language]].

===Pyramid of languages of the world===
[[File:The world language hierarchy (adapted from Graddol, 1997).jpg|thumb|This pyramid illustrates the hierarchy of the world's languages as proposed by Graddol (1997) in his book, 'The future of English? A guide to forecasting the popularity of the English language in the 21st century', published by the British Council.]]

According to [[David Graddol]] (1997), in his book titled ''The Future of English'',  the languages of the world comprise a "hierarchical pyramid", as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Maurais |first=Jacques |editor1-last=Maurais |editor1-first=Jacques |editor1link=Jacques Maurais |editor2-last=Morris |editor2-first=Michael A. |title=Languages in a Globalising World|date=2003 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=United Kingdom |pages=13–36 |chapter=Chapter 2:Towards a new global linguistic order? [https://books.google.com.sg/books?id=NZ5LBcUMr28C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=graddol&amp;f=false] |isbn=0-521-82173-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''The big languages''': [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]].
* '''Regional languages''' (languages of the [[United Nations]] are marked with asterisk): [[Arabic]]*, [[Chinese language|Chinese]]*, English*, French*, [[German language|German]], [[Russian language|Russian]]*, [[Spanish language|Spanish]]*.
* '''National languages''': around 80 languages serving over 180 nation states.
* '''Official languages within nation states''' (and other "safe" languages): around 600 languages worldwide (e.g. [[Marathi language|Marathi]]). 
* '''Local vernacular languages''': the remainder of the world's 6,000+ languages.

===Translation systems===
The global language system is also seen in the international translation process as explained by Johan Heilbron, a historical sociologist: "translations and the manifold activities these imply are embedded in and dependent on a world system of translation, including both the source and the target cultures".&lt;ref name=Heilbron&gt;{{cite web|last1=Heilbron|first1=Johan|title=Structure and Dynamics of the World System of Translation|url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/files/40619/12684038723Heilbron.pdf/Heilbron.pdf|accessdate=5 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The hierarchical relationship between global languages is reflected in the global system for translations. The more "central" a language, the greater is its capability to function as a bridge or vehicular language to facilitate communication between peripheral and semi-central languages.&lt;ref name=Heilbron /&gt;

Heilbron's version of the global system of language in translations has four levels:

'''Level 1''': Hypercentral position — 
English currently holds the largest market share of the global market for translations; 55–60% of all book translations are from English. It strongly dominates the hierarchical nature of book translation system.

'''Level 2''': Central position — 
German and French each hold 10% of the global translation market.

'''Level 3''': Semi-central position — 
There are 7 or 8 languages "neither very central on a global level nor very peripheral",&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt; making up 1 to 3% of the world market (like Spanish, Italian and Russian).

'''Level 4''': Peripheral position — 
Languages from which "less than 1% of the book translations worldwide are made", including Chinese, Japanese and Arabic. Despite having large populations of speakers, "their role in the translation economy is peripheral as compared to more central languages".&lt;ref name=Heilbron/&gt;

==Acceptance==
According to the [[Google Scholar]] website, de Swaan's book, ''Words of the world: The global language system'', has been cited by 546 other papers, as of 16 October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=de Swaan|first1=Abram|title=Words of the world: The global language system|url=https://scholar.google.com.sg/scholar?q=abram+de+swaan+global+language+system&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5|website=Google Scholar|accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there have also been several concerns regarding the global language system:

===Importance of Q-value===
Van Parijs (2004)&lt;ref name="de Swaan 2007" /&gt; claimed that 'frequency' or likelihood of contact is adequate as an indicator of language learning and language spread. However, de Swaan (2007) argued that it alone is not sufficient. Rather, the [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which comprises both frequency (better known as prevalence) and 'centrality', helps to explain the spread of (super)central languages, especially former colonial languages in newly independent countries where in which only the elite minority spoke the language initially. Frequency alone would not be able to explain the spread of such languages, but [[#Q-value|Q-value]], which includes centrality, would be able to.

In another paper, Cook and Li (2009)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cook |first=Vivian |editor-last=Cook |editor-first=Vivian |editor1link= Vivian Cook (academic) |editor2-last=Li |editor2-first=Wei |title=Big Contemporary Applied Linguistics: Language Teaching and Learning, Vol. 1 |publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group |date=2009 |pages=54–74 |chapter=Chapter 3: Language user groups and language teaching [https://books.google.com.sg/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=_5evAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR5&amp;dq=Contemporary+Applied+Linguistics+cook&amp;ots=glSUNb01Ei&amp;sig=zQc-xnrhpNkI_4iTwlaR51x8L7E#v=onepage&amp;q=swaan&amp;f=false] |isbn=978-0-8264-9680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; examined the ways to categorise language users into various groups. They suggested two theories: one by Siegel (2006) who used 'sociolinguistic settings', which is based on the notion of dominant language, and another one by de Swaan (2001) that used the concept of hierarchy in the global language system. According to them, de Swaan's hierarchy is more appropriate, as it does not imply dominance in power terms. Rather, de Swaan's applies the concepts of geography and function to group languages and hence language users according to the global language system. De Swaan (2001) views the acquisition of [[second language]]s (L2) as typically going up the hierarchy.

However, Cook and Li argues that this analysis is not adequate in accounting for the many groups of L2 users to whom the two areas of territory and function hardly apply. The two areas of territory and function can be associated respectively with the prevalence and centrality of the [[#Q-value|Q-value]]. This group of L2 users typically doez not acquire an L2 going up the hierarchy, such as users in an intercultural marriage or users who come from a particular cultural or ethnic group and wish to learn its language for identity purposes. Thus, Cook and Li argue that de Swaan's theory, though highly relevant, still has its drawbacks in that the concept behind [[#Q-value|Q-value]] is insufficient in accounting for some L2 users.

===Choice of supercentral languages===
There is disagreement as to which languages should be considered more central. The theory states that a language is central if it connects speakers of "a series of central languages". [[Robert Phillipson]] questioned why [[Japanese language|Japanese]] is included as one of the supercentral languages but [[Bengali language|Bengali]], which has more speakers, is not on the list.&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Phillipson|first1=Robert|title=English in Globalization: Three Approaches|journal=Journal of Language, Identity &amp; Education|date=2004|volume=3|issue=1|pages=73–78|doi=10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1207/s15327701jlie0301_4?journalCode=hlie20#.VDN8XfmSzuw|accessdate=7 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inadequate evidence for a system===
Michael Morris argued that while it is clear that there is language hierarchy from the "ongoing interstate competition and power politics", there is little evidence provided that shows that the "global language interaction is so intense and systematic that it constitutes a global language system, and that the entire system is held together by one [[global language]], English". He claimed that de Swaan's case studies demonstrated that hierarchy in different regions of the world but did not show the existence of a system within a region or across regions. The global language system is supposed to be part of the international system but is "notoriously vague and lacking in operational importance"  and therefore cannot be shown to exist.  However, Morris believes that this lack of evidence could be from the lack of global language data and not negligence on de Swaan's part. Morris also believes that any theory on a global system, if later proved, would be much more complex than what is proposed by de Swaan. Questions on how the [[#Hypercentral language|hypercentral language]] English holds together the system must also be answered by such a global language system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morris|first1=Michael|title=Words of the World: The Global Language System by Abram De Swaan|journal=Language in Society|date=Sep 2004|volume=33|issue=4|pages=620–624|jstor=4169377|doi=10.1017/S0047404504334068}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Theory built on inadequate foundations===
Robert Phillipson states that the theory is based on selective theoretical foundations. He claimed that there is a lack of consideration about the effects of [[globalization]], which is especially important when the theory is about a global system: "De Swaan nods occasionally in the direction of linguistic and cultural capital, but does not link this to class or linguistically defined social stratification ([[linguistic discrimination|linguicism]]) or linguistic inequality"  and that "key concepts in the [[sociolinguistics|sociology of language]], language maintenance and [[language shift|shift]], and language spread are scarcely mentioned".&lt;ref name="tandfonline.com"/&gt;

On the other hand, de Swaan's work in the field of sociolinguistics has been noted by other scholars to be focused on "issues of economic and political sociology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tonkin|first1=Humphrey|title=Abram de Swaan. Words of the World: The Global Language System|journal=Language Problems &amp; Language Planning|date=2005|volume=29|issue=2|pages=201–203|doi=10.1075/lplp.29.2.12ton}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "politic and economic patterns",&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Augustyn|first1=Prisca|title=Review: Sociolinguistics: De Swaan(2001)|url=http://linguistlist.org/issues/13/13-3274.html|website=http://linguistlist.org/|accessdate=21 October 2014|ref=LINGUIST List 13.3274}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may explain why he makes only 'cautious references to socio-linguistic parameters".&lt;ref name="LINGUIST List 13.3274" /&gt;

'''Harilal Harshadrai Dhruv''' (1856–1896) was a lawyer, poet, editor, [[indologist]] and scholar of [[Sanskrit literature]]. Educated in Arts and Law, he served as a teacher and later as a judge of [[Baroda state]]. He was interested in [[oriental studies]]. He wrote poetry and edited some works too.

==Life==
Dhruv was born in Hindu [[Nagar Brahmin]] family in 1856. He completed his Bachelor of Arts in 1873 and LL.B in 1880.  Dhruv worked as a teacher from 1881 to 1885. Later he started his law career as a pleader from [[Surat]], and was elevated to post of District and Session Judge of [[Baroda state]].&lt;ref name="Datta1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=Amaresh Datta|title=Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zB4n3MVozbUC&amp;pg=PA1005|volume=2|year=1988|publisher=Sahitya Akademi|isbn=978-81-260-1194-0|page=1005}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sent as a representative of [[Bharuch]] in the annual session of [[Indian National Congress]] in 1898 by Baroda state.&lt;ref name="gg"&gt;{{cite book|author=Gujarat (India)|title=Gujarat State Gazetteers: Vadodara District|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pCQbAAAAIAAJ|publisher=Directorate of Government Print., Stationery and Publications, Gujarat State|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1882, Dhruv founded ''Prajahita Vardhak Sabha'' in Surat with Ukabhai Parabhudas.&lt;ref name="Kendra2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Smt. Hiralaxmi Navanitbhai Shah Dhanya Gurjari Kendra|title=Gujarat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g4oMAQAAMAAJ|year=2007|publisher=Gujarat Vishvakosh Trust|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; He left by SS. Maria Theresa and attended the 8th [[International Congress of Orientalists]] at [[Stockholm]] and [[Oslo|Christiania]] as representative of Baroda in 1889 where he was honoured with Doctor of Literature and Arts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Indian Magazine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HUJBAQAAMAAJ|series=217—228|year=1889|publisher=National Indian Association in Aid of Social Progress and Education in India.|page=490}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a member of the [[Royal Asiatic Society]] and the [[Anthropological Society of London]].  Dhruv received Ph.D. from [[Berlin University]]. His brother [[Keshavlal Dhruv]] was also author, editor and translator. He died in 1896.&lt;ref name="Datta1988"/&gt;

==Works==
His initial poetry was influenced by medieval Gujarati, medieval Hindi and classical [[Sanskrit]] poetry while his later poetry was influenced by English poetry and [[modernism]].&lt;ref name="Datta1988"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maniar1969"&gt;{{cite book|author=Umedbhai M.

The '''Hlai languages''' ({{zh|s=黎语|p=Lí yǔ}}) are a primary branch of the [[Kra–Dai languages|Kra–Dai]] language family spoken in the mountains of central and south-central [[Hainan]] in [[China]], not to be confused with the colloquial name for the [[Leizhou Min|Leizhou]] branch of Min Chinese ({{zh|s=黎话|p=Lí huà}}). They include [[Cun language|Cun]], whose speakers are ethnically distinct.&lt;ref&gt;Ethnologue mistakenly lists Cun among the [[Kra languages]].&lt;/ref&gt; A quarter of Hlai speakers are monolingual. None of the Hlai languages had a writing system until the 1950s, when the [[Latin script]] was adopted for Ha.

==Classification==
Norquest (2007) classifies the Hlai languages as follows.&lt;ref name="norquest"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Norquest |first=Peter K. |year=2007 |url=http://gradworks.umi.com/32/84/3284367.html |title=A Phonological Reconstruction of Proto-Hlai |type=Ph.D. dissertation |publisher=Department of Anthropology, University of Arizona}}&lt;/ref&gt; Individual languages are highlighted in bold. There are some 750,000 Hlai speakers.

The Fuma 府玛 dialect is spoken in one village north of Changcheng 昌城, Hainan. It had about 800 speakers in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://asiaharvest.org/wp-content/themes/asia/docs/people-groups/China/chinaPeoples/F/Fuma.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jiamao language|Jiamao]] 加茂 (52,000) is an aberrant Kra-Dai language with a Hlai superstratum and a non-Hlai substratum.

==Reconstruction==
{{main|Proto-Hlai language}}

The Proto-Hlai language is the [[linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] ancestor of the Hlai languages. Proto-Hlai reconstructions include those of Matisoff (1988), Thurgood (1991), Ostapirat (2004), and Norquest (2007).

Beijing: China Social Sciences Academy Press 中国社会科学出版社. {{ISBN|9787500416814}}&lt;/ref&gt; consider the original homeland of the Hlai languages to be the [[Leizhou Peninsula]], and estimate that the Hlai had migrated across the [[Hainan Strait]] into [[Hainan]] island about 4,000 years before present.&lt;ref name="Liang1996"/&gt;

A '''hospital-acquired condition''' (HAC) is an undesirable situation or condition that affects a patient and that arose during a stay in a hospital or medical facility. It is a designation used by [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]]/[[Medicaid]] in the [[United States of America|US]] for determining [[Diagnosis-related group|MS-DRG]] reimbursement beginning with version 26 (October 1, 2008). Not only [[hospital-acquired infection]]s but also any other situation or condition, such as [[pressure ulcer]]s, [[blood type]] mismatch, or [[iatrogenesis|iatrogenic]] injury, can be a HAC.

==Description==
A patient at a hospital can be infected or otherwise degraded by hospital conditions and/or personnel in ways that are sometimes diagnosed as a "complication." The US Medicare system designates some 1000+ ICD-9-CM diagnoses, out of over 14000 (as of 2009), as possible HACs. On February 8, 2006, the President signed the Deficit Reduction Act (DRA) of 2005. Section 5001(c) of DRA requires the Secretary to identify conditions that are: (a) high cost or high volume or both, (b) result in the assignment of a case to a DRG that has a higher payment when present as a secondary diagnosis, and (c) could reasonably have been prevented through the application of evidence-based guidelines. Section 5001(c) provides that CMS can revise the list of conditions from time to time, as long as it contains at least two conditions.  On July 31, 2008, in the inpatient prospective payment system (IPPS) fiscal year (FY) 2009 Final Rule, the Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) selected 10 categories of conditions for a HAC payment provision. For discharges occurring on or after October 1, 2008, hospitals no longer receive additional payment for cases in which one of the selected conditions was not present on admission. That is, the case would be paid as though the secondary diagnosis were not present.&lt;ref&gt; http://www.cms.gov/HospitalAcqCond/ &lt;/ref&gt;

==Categories of hospital-acquired condition==
{{Technical|section|date=November 2015}}
The following are the current, as of October 1, 2009 (MS-DRG v27), Hospital-Acquired Conditions:&lt;ref name=haclist1&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HospitalAcqCond/06_Hospital-Acquired_Conditions.asp Hospital-Acquired Conditions]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=haclist2&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/apps/media/press/factsheet.asp?Counter=3227&amp;intNumPerPage=10&amp;checkDate=&amp;checkKey=&amp;srchType=1&amp;numDays=3500&amp;srchOpt=0&amp;srchData=&amp;keywordType=All&amp;chkNewsType=6&amp;intPage=&amp;showAll=&amp;pYear=&amp;year=&amp;desc=&amp;cboOrder=date MEdicare takes new steps to help make your hospital stay safer]&lt;/ref&gt;

Falls and Trauma – Fractures, Dislocations, Intracranial Injuries, Crushing Injuries, and Burns (Codes will be considered in FY2009 IPPS Proposed Rule)
* Falls are a leading cause of hospital-acquired injury, and frequently prolong or complicate hospital stays. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention of Falls (Acute Care) Health Care Protocol|url=https://library.hill-rom.com/browse?jobid=146|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121217144228/https://library.hill-rom.com/browse?jobid=146|archivedate=2012-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* Falls are the most common adverse event reported in hospitals. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prevention of Falls (Acute Care) Health Care Protocol|url=https://library.hill-rom.com/browse?jobid=146|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121217144228/https://library.hill-rom.com/browse?jobid=146|archivedate=2012-12-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 


Almost all of the 1000+ diagnoses that are possible HACs are designated "Falls and trauma."&lt;ref&gt;See the data.&lt;/ref&gt;

==How HAC is determined==
When a diagnosis is recorded, it is designated either ''Present on Admission'' (POA) or not.&lt;ref name=poa&gt;[http://www.cms.hhs.gov/HospitalAcqCond/05_Coding.asp Hospital-Acquired Conditions (Present on Admission Indicator)]&lt;/ref&gt; If the diagnosis is POA, it is not demoted.

However, if a diagnosis is ''not'' POA, it might be demoted. Most HAC diagnoses are demoted if they are not POA. Some that are not so simple are designated above with the tag "Proc," "Diag," or both. In those situations, a diagnosis must also be accompanied by one of a specific set of diagnoses, procedures, or both to be demoted.

For instance, if a patient falls out of bed while in a hospital, the consequent broken hip was not present on admission, so the "complication" of "broken hip" would be demoted as a "Falls and trauma" HAC. The hospital would not be compensated for treatment of the injury. The intent of this sort of classification is to force hospitals to prevent such problems in the first place.&lt;ref name=haclist2 /&gt;

Ihor Pavlyuk is a member of the European Society of Authors.

==Life and career==
Ihor Pavlyuk was born in the [[Volyn]] region on January 1, 1967. His mother died in ten days after giving birth to him. He was raised at home of his grandfather and grandmother on his mother's side — migrants with [[Chełm|Helm]] region.

He studied at the [[Saint Petersburg]] [[military engineering-technical university]], which he left in order to pursue his career as a writer. He was, as a result, sentenced to a period of hard labour in the Taiga ([[Zabaykalye|Zabaykal'skiy region]]) but continued to write as best he could, driven by a nostalgia for his [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] homeland, until he was liberated by the fall of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref name="om" /&gt;

In 1992 Ihor Pavlyuk graduated from the Department of Journalism at [[Lviv University]] and worked as the correspondent of religious [[News media|press]] and [[radio]] in [[Lviv]].

He has participated in various international literary festivals, including [[Estonia]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]], [[Russia]], [[Belarus]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], the [[United States of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ukrainiantours.com/images/Ukrainian_Ihor_Pavlyuk_presents_his_poetry_in_Florida_June_28-027.doc |title=Ukrainian Ihor Pavlyuk presents his poetry in Florida! |date=June 28, 2014 |accessdate=July 28, 2015 |website=ukrainiantours.com |publisher=Ukrainian tours |last= |first= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129053632/http://www.ukrainiantours.com/images/Ukrainian_Ihor_Pavlyuk_presents_his_poetry_in_Florida_June_28-027.doc |archivedate=November 29, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Poland]], [[Turkey]], [[Ireland]], [[Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.dawn.com/news/1075857/two-day-intl-peace-conference-kicks-off|title = Two-day Int’l Peace Conference kicks off|date = December 23, 2013|accessdate = July 26, 2015|website = dawn.com|publisher = DAWN|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[England]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.englishpen.org/event/ukrainian-poetry-evening/|title = Ukrainian Poetry Evening|date = March 6, 2014|accessdate = July 26, 2015|website = englishpen.org|publisher = English PEN|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Czech Republic]] and international editions about Ukrainians from [[Volyn]] region, Ukrainian writers and poets.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

An '''intelligent maintenance system''' ('''IMS''') is a system that utilizes the collected data from the machinery in order to predict and prevent the potential failures in them. The occurrence of failures in the machinery can be costly and even catastrophic. In order to avoid them, there needs to be a system which analyzes the behavior of the machine and provides alarms and instructions for preventive maintenance. Analyzing the behavior of the machines has become possible by means of advanced sensors, data collection systems, data storage/transfer capabilities and data analytic tools developed for such purpose. More information on the related data analytic tools can be found in [[prognostics]]. The aggregation of data collection, storage, transformation, analysis and decision making for smart maintenance is called an intelligent maintenance system (IMS).

== Definition ==

An intelligent maintenance system is a system that utilizes the history data by facilitating data analytics and decision support tools to predict and prevent the potential failure of the machines. With the growing complexity of manufacturing processes and machinery, the role of monitoring systems and intelligent maintenance is becoming more crucial. The recent advancements in information technology, computers and electronics have facilitated the design and implementation of such systems.

Based on the industries growing demand in sustainability of the assets, different maintenance practices have been designed and implemented. The maintenance practices generally include  [[Condition-based maintenance|condition-based maintenance (CBM)]], [[Reliability-centered maintenance|reliability-centered maintenance (RCM)]], [[corrective maintenance]], scheduled or [[planned maintenance]] and [[predictive maintenance]]. An intelligent maintenance system enhances the performance of [[predictive maintenance]] systems by utilizing the advancements in computer science, electronics and information technology.
The key research elements of intelligent maintenance systems consist of:
# "Transformation of data to information to knowledge and synchronization of the decisions with remote systems;
# Intelligent embedded prognostics algorithms for assessing the degradation and predicting the performance in future;
# Infotronics software and hardware platforms that make the products capable of thinking, linking, reconfiguring and sustaining in a networked and tether-free environment;
# Embedded product services and life cycle information for closed-loop product designs"&lt;ref name=jaylee1&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|author2=Jun Ni |author3=Dragan Djurdjanovic |author4=Hai Qiu |author5=Haitao Liao |title=Intelligent prognostics tools and e-maintenance|journal=Computers in Industry|date=August 2006|volume=57|issue=6|page=478|doi=10.1016/j.compind.2006.02.014|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.compind.2006.02.014|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems ==

Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS Center)&lt;ref name="ims web"&gt;{{cite web|title=Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems|url=http://www.imscenter.net|work=IMS Center|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  is an Industry/University Collaborative Research Center (I/UCRC) that consists of the [[University of Cincinnati]], [[the University of Michigan]], and [[Missouri University of Science and Technology]]. Since 2001, IMS has been a frontrunner in advancing methods, tools and technologies for enabling the products and systems to achieve and sustain near-zero breakdown. The techniques and technologies developed by the IMS Center have been validated in over 70 projects conducted with research and industry partners across the globe. These projects include various applications from a wide range including manufacturing, energy, rotating machinery etc. [www.imscenter.net]. A complete list of publications by IMS Center can be found in its website.&lt;ref name="ims publications"&gt;{{cite web|title=List of published, accepted or submitted journal and conference papers.|url=http://www.imscenter.net/Research/Publications|work=IMS Publications|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a feasibility study conducted at North Carolina State University&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=Denis O.|author2=Drew Rivers |author3=George Vermont |title=Measuring the Economic Impacts of the NSF Industry/University Cooperative Research Centers Program: A Feasibility Study|date=May 2012|page=xiii|url=http://www.ncsu.edu/iucrc/PDFs/IUCRC_EconImpactFeasibilityReport_FinalFinal.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that among the NSF I/UCRC research centers across the U.S., IMS Center has had the biggest economic impact with the benefit of $238.3 for every dollar invested on it (238.3:1). Berkley Sensors and Actuators Center (BSAC) at UC Berkley and Industry-University Center for Surfactants (IUCS) at Columbia University were ranked second and third with economic impacts of 36.2:1 and 2.8:1 respectively.

=== IMS procedure and methodology ===

The methodology for developing intelligent maintenance systems consist of finding the critical assets within a machine or process, instrumentation for collecting the suitable data, pre-processing and analyzing the collected data and extracting indicative features, applying the relevant machine-learning algorithms for health assessment, predicting the performance of the assets, and finally devising the appropriate maintenance action based on the obtained knowledge of the assets.

=== 5S approach ===

The "5S" approach was devised by the IMS Center in order to address the needs of future maintenance services. This systematic approach consists of five key elements: Streamline, Smart Processing, Synchronize, Standardize and Sustain.

=== Watchdog Agent Toolbox ===

Watchdog Agent is the IMS Center's collection of tools and techniques for Prognostics and Health Management (PHM). For developing intelligent maintenance systems, a major step is to properly select such tools for data analysis and facilitate a decision support system. This toolbox can be customized and reconfigured for nearly any application – from products and assets, to complex systems, processes or manufacturing lines. The Watchdog Agent® includes four categories of analytical tools that can be used to assess and predict the performance or degradation of machines and processes by extracting the performance-related features from inputs such as measured sensor data, controller signals, and also expert knowledge, etc. Prediction results are then used for maintenance decision-making infrastructure operations IMS Brochure.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imscenter.net/Resources/brochure_2012_red_final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Watchdog Agent® conducts its performance assessment based on the readings from multiple sensors that measure the critical properties of a process, machine or component. Since the degradation process alters the sensor measurements, the Watchdog Agent® is capable of quantitatively describing such changes in the sensor readings by using analytical tools and extracting those changes by means of appropriate tools and methods.&lt;ref name=jaylee1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=watchdog&gt;{{cite journal|last=Djurdjanovic|first=Dragan|author2=Jay Lee |author3=Jun Ni |title=Watchdog Agent—an infotronics-based prognostics approach for product performance degradation assessment and prediction|journal=Advanced Engineering Informatics|date=July–October 2003|volume=17|issue=3-4|page=111|doi=10.1016/j.aei.2004.07.005|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.aei.2004.07.005|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=changingRole&gt;{{cite journal|last=Takata|first=S |author2=F.

=== Reconfigurable prognostics platform ===

An intelligent maintenance system should have the flexibility of being reconfigured for different platforms and software languages. The platforms are divided into three categories: stand-alone, embedded and cloud-based. RPP is a designed platform that can be used for heath assessment and performance prediction. RPP can be installed on equipment and is capable of converting the data to information related to the performance. Such information can then be integrated into an asset management system proper maintenance decision-making.&lt;ref name=linxia&gt;{{cite journal|last=Liao|first=Linxia|author2=Jay Lee|title=Design of a reconfigurable prognostics platform for machine tools|journal=Expert Systems with Applications|date=January 2010|volume=37|issue=1|page=241|doi=10.1016/j.eswa.2009.05.004|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.eswa.2009.05.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Closed-loop life cycle design ===

The concept of closed-loop life cycle design refers to one of the aspects in the future of maintenance where an intelligent maintenance system can lead to redesigning the products for increased reliability and serviceability.

=== Smart maintenance scheduling ===

There are several important issues to be addressed for the effective maintenance of production systems. They include (1) how to assess the impact of a machine breakdown on the factory throughput and determine what to do first, (2) if an unscheduled machine failure occurs, or if several events occur simultaneously, which reactive maintenance job has the highest priority (3) which machine failure is most seriously endangering the production schedule, (4) where are the opportunities for maintenance without affecting production throughput, and (5) how to efficiently utilize the factory resources (e.g., maintenance crews) on the critical sections of the systems.&lt;ref name="mich 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ni|first=Jun|author2=Xiaoning Jin|title=Decision support systems for effective maintenance operations|journal=CIRP Annals-Manufacturing Technology|year=2012|volume=61|issue=1|pages=411–414|doi=10.1016/j.cirp.2012.03.065|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cirp.2012.03.065|accessdate=31 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMS center has developed maintenance policies to answer these questions.

== The future of maintenance ==

The goal of intelligent maintenance systems is to achieve and sustain near-zero breakdown. This is defined as the future of maintenance in which an intelligent system can equip the machines and systems to achieve highest performance and near-zero breakdown with self-maintenance capabilities. Such goal can be achieved by the transformation of raw data to valuable information regarding the current and future condition of the asset or process being monitored.
Such vision has been introduced by Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS) at the University of Cincinnati, and is summarized as a transformation of '''fail and fix''' maintenance practices to '''predict and prevent''' by focusing on frontier technologies in embedded and remote monitoring, [[prognostics]], and intelligent  [[Decision support system|decision support tools]]. The center also has trademarked Watchdog Agent prognostics toolbox&lt;ref name="watchdog intro file"&gt;{{cite web|title=Development of Smart Prognostics Agents (WATCHDOG AGENT ® )|url=http://www.imscenter.net/Resources/WD.pdf|work=IMS Center|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and device-to-business (D2B) infotronics platform&lt;ref name="d2b pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Device-to-Business (D2B)™ Platform|url=http://www.imscenter.net/Resources/D2B.pdf|work=IMS Center|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  for e-maintenance systems.
The "unmet needs" to be addressed in the scope of future maintenance rely on three aspects:
*''Self-assessment'': In future, the assets need to have embedded intelligent agents for nonstop monitoring that can guarantee the sustainability.
*''Only handle information once (OHIO)'': The flow of information from the field (user) to service/business systems is referred to as Only Handle Information Once (OHIO).
*''All-time readiness'': The obtained information can be used for predicting, optimizing and planning maintenance scheduling for achieving near-zero breakdown.&lt;ref name="ims intro pdf"&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Prognostics for Smart Systems|url=http://www.imscenter.net/Resources/IMS_Intro_2009.pdf|work=IMS Center|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== E-manufacturing and e-maintenance ==

With evolving applications of tether-free communication technologies e.g. Internet, the e-intelligence is gaining bigger impact on industries. Such impact has become a driving force for companies to shift the manufacturing operations from traditional factory integration practices towards an e-factory and e-supply chain philosophy. Such change is transforming the companies from a local factory automation to a global business automation. “It transforms companies from a local factory automation to a global enterprise and business automation. The technological advances for achieving this highly collaborative design and manufacturing environment are based on multimedia-type information-based engineering tools and a highly reliable communication system for enabling distributed procedures in concurrent engineering design, remote operation of manufacturing processes, and operation of distributed production systems.”&lt;ref name="koc intro to eman"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Koc|first=Muammer|author2=Jun Ni |author3=Jay Lee |author4=Pulak Bandyopadhyay |title=Introduction to e- Manufacturing|page=97-2|url=http://pdf.aminer.org/000/000/349/introduction_to_e_manufacturing.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of e-manufacturing is to plant floor assets, predict the deviation of the quality of the products and possible loss of any equipment. This brings about the predictive maintenance capability for the machines. Utilizing such e-maintenance capability with a dynamic rescheduling of maintenance and operation can lead to achieving lower downtime.&lt;ref name="fund, tool, transf"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lee|first=Jay|title=E-manufacturing—fundamental, tools, and transformation|journal=Robotics and Computer-Integrated Manufacturing|date=December 2003|volume=19|issue=6|page=505|doi=10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/S0736-5845(03)00060-7|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The major functions and objectives of e-manufacturing are: “(a) provide a transparent, seamless and automated information exchange process to enable an only handle information once (OHIO) environment; (b) improve the utilization of plant floor assets using a holistic approach combining the tools of predictive maintenance techniques; (c) links entire SCM operation and asset optimization; and (d) deliver customer services utilizing the latest predictive intelligence methods and tether-free technologies”.&lt;ref name="koc intro to eman" /&gt;

== Annual PHM data challenge ==

As an effort to promote the science of PHM and contribute to the development of intelligent maintenance systems, the Prognostics and Health Management Society ([http://www.phmsociety.org PHM Society]) sponsors an annual [http://www.phmsociety.org competition data challenge] to both professional and student participants. Participants use the available data and their prior experience and algorithm knowhow for developing their health monitoring algorithms for the given application. The accuracy of the health monitoring algorithm output is compared with the true health state; the true health state is unknown to the participants but is known by the organizers of the data challenge.

=== 2008: jet engine RUL estimation ===

The 2008 data challenge was the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction of jet engines. The simulated data set consisted of multivariate time series that were collected from multiple engine units. There were three operational settings that have a substantial effect on unit performance. The data for each cycle of each unit included the unit ID, cycle index, 3 values for the operational settings and 21 values for 21 sensor measurements. Each unit started with unknown degrees of initial degradation and manufacturing variation. The units were operating normally at the start of each time series, and developed a fault at some point during the series. The data set was further divided into training and testing subsets. In the training data set (218 units), the fault grew in magnitude until system failed. There is no "hard" failure in the data set; however, the remaining useful life of the last operational cycle of each unit in the training data was considered as zero. In the testing data set, the time series ended some time prior to system failure. The objective of the problem was to predict the number of remaining operational cycles before failure in the testing data set. A portion of the testing data set (218 units) was provided first to assist algorithm development and the rest (435 units) was released towards the end of the competition as the validation data set to score the algorithm.

=== 2009: gearbox health assessment ===

The 2009 data challenge application dealt with gearbox health monitoring and diagnosis. The objective of the competition was to develop accurate health monitoring and diagnostic methods for gearbox components. The data provided consisted of 560 data sets, in which the gearbox was tested under 5 different speeds, 2 different loads, and two different gear types. The 560 data sets consisted of data in which the gearbox was under different conditions of the mechanical components. No training data set was provided for the data challenge and fault detection was to be performed by analyzing the available vibration and speed signals and comparing the results against the known gearbox signatures in the literature.&lt;ref name=atat&gt;{{cite journal|last=Al-Atat|first=Hassan|author2=David Siegel |author3=Jay Lee |title=A Systematic Methodology for Gearbox Health Assessment and Fault Classification|journal=International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management|year=2011|volume=2|pages=2153–2648|url=http://www.phmsociety.org/sites/phmsociety.org/files/phm_submission/2009/ijPHM_11_002.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011: fault detection of anemometers ===

The 2011 data challenged dealt with [[anemometer]] sensor health assessment for wind energy applications. The objective of this challenge was to develop accurate sensor health monitoring methods for specific applications in anemometers. The data set provided for this challenge consisted of data from anemometers from two different configurations. The two configurations consist of the “paired” data set in which two anemometers are positioned at the same height, and the “shear” data set, which includes an array of anemometers at different heights. Various wind speed statistics, wind direction, and ambient temperature information are provided, in which the objective is to classify the anemometer health status during a set of samples from a 5&amp;nbsp;day period.&lt;ref name="siegel aann"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=David|author2=Jay Lee|title=An Auto-Associative Residual Processing and K-means Clustering Approach for Anemometer Health Assessment|journal=International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management|year=2011|volume=2|issue=2|pages=50–61|url=http://www.phmsociety.org/sites/phmsociety.org/files/phm_submission/2011/ijPHM_11_014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information about this data challenge can be found in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2011 PHM Society Conference Data Challenge|url=https://www.phmsociety.org/competition/phm/11|work=PHM Data Challenge 2011 Announcement|publisher=PHM Society|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012: RUL estimation of bearings ===

In 2012, no data challenge was organized by [www.phmsociety.org PHM Society] but instead, IEEE Reliability Society and FEMTO-ST Institute organized a data challenge focusing on the RUL estimation of bearings.&lt;ref name="phm 2012 announce"&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE PHM 2012 Data Challenge|url=http://www.femto-st.fr/en/Research-departments/AS2M/Research-groups/PHM/IEEE-PHM-2012-Data-challenge.php|work=IEEE PHM 2012 Announcement|publisher=FEMTO-ST|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data was collected from 3 different loads (rotating speed and load force). Participants were provided with 6 run-to-failure datasets in order to build their prognostics models, and were asked to estimate accurately the RUL of 11 remaining bearings. Monitoring data of the 11 test bearings were truncated so that participants were supposed to predict the remaining life, and thereby perform RUL estimates. Also, no assumption about the type of failure to be occurred was given. The challenge datasets were characterized by a small amount of training data and a high variability in experiment durations (from 1h to 7h). Thereby, performing good estimates was quite di cult and this made the challenge more exciting. Note also that theoretical framework (L10, BPFI, BPFE, etc.) mismatches the experimental observations.&lt;ref name="phm 2012 announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=IEEE PHM 2012 Prognostic challenge Outline, Exp eriments, Scoring of results, Winners|url=http://www.femto-st.fr/f/d/IEEEPHM2012-Challenge-Details.pdf|publisher=IEEE Reliability Society and FEMTO-ST|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2013: remote monitoring diagnosis and maintenance action recommendation ===

The 2013 data challenge focused on maintenance action recommendation based on historical cases and the algorithms were evaluated on their ability to recommend confirmed problem types.&lt;ref name="bayesian vasiliki"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Katsouros|first=Vassilis|author2=Vassilis Papavassiliou |author3=Christos Emmanouilidis |title=A Bayesian Approach for Maintenance Action Recommendation|journal=International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management|year=2013|volume=4|issue=2|url=http://www.phmsociety.org/sites/phmsociety.org/files/phm_submission/2013/ijphm_13_034.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data was generated from an industrial piece of equipment with a sensor network to measure several parameters and an onboard condition monitoring system. The measured data goes through a control logic in order to monitor the equipment's operating regime. At any time instant when some of these parameters meet a specific condition, the control system generates a unique event ID/code. Each case is described by a set of event codes which characterize the atypical operating condition of the equipment. Some of these cases with specific event code combinations may be operationally significant and could be indicative of ''problem types'', some of which are assumed to be known to the subject matter experts.&lt;ref name="santanu das"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Das|first=Santanu|title=Maintenance Action Recommendation Using Collaborative Filtering|journal=International Journal of Prognostics and Health Management|year=2013|volume=4|issue=2|url=https://www.phmsociety.org/sites/phmsociety.org/files/phm_submission/2013/ijphm_13_038.pdf|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More information regarding this data challenge can be found in.&lt;ref name="2013 announcement"&gt;{{cite web|title=2013 PHM Society Conference Data Challenge|url=http://www.phmsociety.org/events/conference/phm/13/challenge|publisher=PHM Society|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== NASA's PHM data repository ==

The Prognostics Data Repository is a collection of data sets that have been donated by various universities, agencies, or companies. The data repository focuses exclusively on prognostic data sets, i.e., data sets that can be used for development of prognostic algorithms. Mostly these are time series of data from some nominal state to a failed state. The collection of data in this repository is an ongoing process. The contributors to this collection of data sets include Center for Intelligent Maintenance Systems (IMS), BEST Lab at UC Berkley, Prognostics CoE at NASA Ames and more. More information regarding this data repository including the data sets can be found in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Prognostics Data Repository|url=http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/tech/dash/pcoe/prognostic-data-repository/|work=Prognostics Center of Excellence|publisher=NASA|accessdate=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Conference on Language Resources and Evaluation''' is an international conference organised by the [[European Language Resources Association]] every other year (on even years) with the support of institutions and organisations involved in [[Natural language processing]]. The series of LREC conferences was launched in Granada in 1998.

The survey of the LREC conferences over the period 1998-2013 has been presented during the 2014 conference &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lrec-conf.org/lrec2014 LREC 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; in Reykjavik as a closing session.&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Mariani]]; Patrick Paroubek; Gil Francopoulo; Olivier Hamon 2014. Rediscovering 15 Years of Discoveries in Language Resources and Evaluation: The LREC Anthology Analysis. LREC-2014 [http://www.lrec-conf.org/proceedings/lrec2014/pdf/1228_Paper.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; It appears that the number of papers and signatures is increasing over time. The average number of authors per paper is highier too. The percentage of new authors is between 68% and 78%. The distribution between male (65%) and female (35%) authors is stable over time. The most frequent technical term is "annotation", then comes "part-of-speech".

== The LRE Map ==
The LRE Map was introduced at LREC 2010 and is now a regular feature of the LREC submission process for both the conference papers and the workshop papers. At the submission stage, the authors are asked to provide some basic information about all the resources (in a broad sense, i.e. including tools, standards and evaluation packages), either used or created, described in their papers. All these descriptors are then gathered in a global matrix called the [[LRE Map]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.resourcebook.eu/ LRE Map]&lt;/ref&gt; This feature has been extended to several other conferences.

[[File:Steppean Rovas inscription on the Kievian letter.png|right|thumb|500px|The Kievan Letter scan in [http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/MS-TS-00012-00122/1 The Kievan Letter scan] collection of [http://www.lib.cam.ac.uk/ Cambridge University Library website]]]

The '''Kievian Letter''' is an early 10th-century (ca. 930)&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=z96HrZh4_N4C&amp;pg=PA86&amp;dq=%22kievan+letter%22+kiev&amp;as_brr=3 Nomads in the sedentary world]&lt;/ref&gt; letter thought to be written by representatives of the [[Judaism|Jewish]] community in [[Kiev]]. The letter, a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] recommendation written on behalf of one member of their community, was part of an enormous collection brought to Cambridge by [[Solomon Schechter]] from the [[Cairo Geniza]]. It was discovered in 1962 during a survey of the Geniza documents by [[Norman Golb]] of the [[University of Chicago]]. The letter is dated by most scholars to around 930 CE. Some think (on the basis of the "pleading" nature of the text, mentioned below) that the letter dates from a time when Khazars were no longer a dominant force in the politics of the city. According to [[Marcel Erdal]], the letter  does not come ''from'' Kiev but was sent ''to'' Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;Marcel Erdal, 'The Khazar Language,' in [[Peter B. Golden]], Haggai Ben-Shammai, András Róna-Tas,(eds.), ''The World of the Khazars: New Perspectives,''Brill, 2007 pp.75-108, pp.95-97.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical significance==
Some scholars point to a district in Kievan [[Podil]] named after the Khazars (called "Kozare"), which indicates to some that Turkic Khazars did live in Kiev. The Khazars apparently played a significant role in the economic vitality of the city, importing [[caviar]], [[fish]], and [[salt]] into Kiev.

If so, it might at first glance suggest that [[Khazar]] control over [[Kiev]], in some form or another, continued well into the tenth century, significantly later than the traditional date for conquest by [[Oleg of Novgorod|Oleg]], 882. On the other hand, from the letter itself it seems that the Khazar authorities could do little to help the Jewish community of Kiev; the letter itself had ended up in [[Egypt]], and the beleaguered alms-seeker had presumably travelled thousands of miles in his search for relief. The identity and status of the reviewing, turcophone officer is therefore ambiguous. It would seem more likely that the letter was reviewed in Khazaria at a time when Khazar Jewish power had waned not only in Kiev but in the heartland itself (sometime in the 11th century).{{cn|date=November 2018}}

== Linguistic significance ==

Linguists are interested in the letter because the names of the community members are of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Slavic languages|Slavic]], and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] origins (for example, names such as: "[[Hanukkah]]," "Yehudah," "Gostata," and "Kiabar"). There is some disagreement as to whether these Jews were [[Israelite]]s who had taken local names, or whether their names indicate [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] or [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] origins. The debate is complicated by the presence of the name Kiabar Kohen. According to [[Omeljan Pritsak]], this name indicates that non-Israelite Khazars adopted the status of [[Kohen]], possibly because they had formed a pre-conversion priestly caste. An alternative scenario is that Israelite Jews in Khazaria adopted Khazar Turkic names, much in the same way that Jews, including prominent rabbis, had adopted [[Aramaic]], [[Persian language|Persian]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]], [[Greek language|Greek]], and [[German language|German]] names. [[Image:Signature Kiev letter.gif|right|thumb|300px|The [[Orkhon script|Turkic runiform]] inscription on the Kievian Letter.]] Recent studies  determined that at least one of the names of signatories is Slavic and that it is likely that the signatories with non-Jewish names, were Jews who adopted  local names.&lt;ref&gt;The World of the Khazars: New Perspectives, Part 8, Volume 17 by Peter B. Golden, Haggai Ben-Shammai, András Róna-Tas P:96&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter may contain the only written record of the [[Khazar language]] extant today - the single word-phrase "I have read (it)," though Erdal argues against this hypothesis and favours [[Bulgar language|Bolgar-Chuvash]] (''hakurüm'' from the reconstructed verb *''okï-'', 'call out, recite, read'), and suggests that it originated in the Danube-Bulgar region.&lt;ref&gt;Erdal, ibid.p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; (Similar inscriptions, in Latin and Greek are found in [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] documents from roughly the same period.)

==Text of the Letter==

#The First among the foremost &lt;nowiki&gt;[i.e. &lt;/nowiki&gt;[[God]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;, He who is adorned with the crown "Final and First,"
#Who hears the whispered voice, and listens to utterance and tongue - May He guard them
#as the pupil [of his eye] and make them to dwell with [[Nahshon]] on high as at first - 
#Men of Truth, despisers of gain, doers of [deeds of] loving-kindness and pursuers of charity,
#guardians of salvation whose bread is available to every traveler and passerby,
#holy communities scattered to all (the world's) corners: may it be the will of
#the Master of Peace to make them dwell as a crown of peace! Now, our officers and masters,
#we, [the] community of Kiev, (hereby inform you of the woesome affair of this Mar Jacob bar
#Hanukah, who is of the sons of [good folk]. He was of the givers, and not of the
#takers, until a cruel decree was decreed against him, in that his brother went and took money
#from [[gentiles]]; this Jacob stood surety. His brother went on the road, and there came
#brigands who slew him and took his money. Then came creditors
#[and t]ook captive this Jacob, they put chains of iron on his neck
#and irons about his legs. He stayed there an entire year ...
#[and afterwards] we took him in surety; we paid out sixty [coins] and there ye[t...]
#remained forty coins; so we have sent him among the holy communities
#that they might take pity on him. So now, O our masters, raise up your eyes to heaven
#and do as is your goodly custom, for you know how great is the virtue
#of charity. For charity saves from death. Nor are we as warners
#but rather those who remind; and to you will be charity before the Lord your God
#You shall eat fruits in this world, and the capital fund [of merit] shall be yours perpetually in the [[Afterlife|world to come]].
#Only be strong and of good courage, and do not put our words behind
#your backs; and may the Omnipresent have mercy upon you and build Jerusalem in your days
#and redeem you and also us with you. (An acronym follows standing for either "Amen, Amen, Amen, soon [may the redemption come]" or "Brotherly people are we, soon [...]".)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9355">'''[[Kurdish language|Kurdish]] grammar''' has many [[Inflections]], with [[prefix]]es and [[suffix]]es added to roots to express [[grammatical relation]]s and to form words.

== Split-Ergative System ==
Among all Iranian languages, only [[Yaghnobi language|Yaghnobi]] and Kurdish are [[ergative language|ergative]], with respect to both case-marking and verb-agreement.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ergative-construction&lt;/ref&gt; There are general descriptions of ergativity in Kurdish,&lt;ref&gt;http://kurdishacademy.org/sites/default/files/KurdAlignment_0.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Theodora Bynon. 1979. The Ergative Construction in Kurdish. ''Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies'' Vol. 42, No. 2, pp. 211-224.
&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in specific forms of Kurdish, such as Sorani &lt;ref&gt;John Haiman. Ergativity in Sorani Kurdish. ''Essais de typologie et de linguistique générale : mélanges offerts à Denis Creissels''. Ed. Franck Florici et al. Lyon: ENS Editions, 2010. 243-250&lt;/ref&gt; and Kurmanjî.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ling.helsinki.fi/uhlcs/LENCA/LENCA-2/information/datei/14-haig.pdf Abstract on origins of ergativity]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sorani Kurdish has a split-ergative system. Transitive verbs show nominative/accusative marking in the present tense, and ergative marking in the past tense.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Robyn C. 1985. Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish. Ann Arbor: UMI. (Doctoral dissertation, University of California at Los Angeles; 240pp.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nouns==

=== Summary ===

*A Kurdish noun in the absolute state, in other words without any ending of any kind, gives a generic sense of the noun.
* It is also the “lexical” form of the noun, i.e. the form in which a noun is given in a vocabulary list or dictionary.
* Nouns are declined in four cases: [[nominative case|nominative]], [[oblique case|oblique]], [[construct case|construct]] (or ezafe) and [[vocative case|vocative]].
* Nouns can be simple or compound.
* Any unmodified noun in Kurdish may be generic, i.e., it can refer to one or more than one items. Plural is not obligatory when more than one item are implied.
*For most nouns the plural is formed through adding a suffix, some are formed through irregular endings. 
* There are 3 grammatical genders: feminine, masculine and neutral.
* Definiteness is not formally marked in Kurmanji. In Sorani nouns may be marked with a definite marker (-aka) or an indefinite marker (-ēk). 
* Adjectives agree with the nouns they modify in number and case.
* Personal pronouns are marked for number and person (1st, 2nd, 3rd). They can be free-standing or take the form of clitics. Free-standing forms are used for emphasis.

=== Possession ===
[[Ezāfe|Ezafe]] is used with nouns to indicate possession. Ezafe (-y) joins the possessive noun with its possessed noun

jēgā-'''y''' pāsā = the king's place (''Lit: place of king)''

[[Ezāfe|Ezafe]] is also used alongside pronouns to show possession. Ezafe (-y) joins the possessor pronoun with its possessed noun.&lt;ref&gt;Friend, Robyn C. 1985. Some Syntactic and Morphological Features of Suleimaniye Kurdish. Ann Arbor: UMI. (Doctoral dissertation, University of California at Los Angeles; 240pp.)&lt;/ref&gt;

jēgā-'''y''' min = my place (''Lit: place of me'')

==Pronouns==

=== Kurmanji Kurdish ===
Kurmanji uses two types of personal pronouns.

{|class=wikitable
! Number!!colspan=4| Singular !!colspan=4| Plural
|-
!Case!!colspan=2| NOM. !!colspan=2| OBL !!colspan= 2| NOM. !!colspan=2|OBL.

The ''ez'' forms (NOM.) are used as subjects in the present and future tenses.  They are also used as subjects in past tenses when the verb is an [[intransitive verbs|intransitive]] one. They are used as objects in past tenses when employed with a transitive verb.
 
The ''min'' forms (OBL.) are used with any preposition or postposition. They are also employed as objects in present and future tenses, but as subjects of the transitive verbs in past tenses.

Kurmanji has lost the suffixes for OBL pronouns, whereas Sorani has lost nominative normal pronouns.

=== Sorani Kurdish ===
Sorani personal pronouns have three persons and both singular and plural form. Gender is not marked. 
{| class="wikitable"

!Singular
!Plural
|-
|1st
|min
|ēma
|-
|2nd

|-

|}

== Adjectives ==
In Sorani, adjectives follow the head noun and may be joined by 'ezafe' or an open compound structure. The following example shows the Ezafe construction:

pyāw-ī  čak = a good fellow (''Lit: man of good'')

==Demonstrative==
Demonstrative pronouns when followed by postpositions (attached to the nouns) become demonstrative adjectives.

{|class=wikitable

|-
| '''too far'''   || how ... a || how ... ana  ||how ... a||how ... a|| how ... ana
|-
|}

As demonstrative adjectives, Sorani Kurdish does not use OBL forms (though for demonstrative pronouns it does use OBL. plural forms); neither Kurmanji uses nominative plural forms.

==Verbs==

===General description===

Kurdish verbs agree with their subjects in person and number. They have the following major characteristics:

* Verbs have two stems: present and past.
* Present stems can be simple or secondary.
* Simple tenses are formed by the addition of personal endings to the two stems.
* Secondary stems consist of a root + suffixes that indicate transitivity, intransitivity, and causativity.
* There are 3 tenses: present, past, and future.
* There are 2 voices: active and passive.
* There are 2 aspects: imperfective and perfective. Aspect is as important as tense.
* There are 4 moods: indicative, conditional, imperative, and potential.
* Past tense transitive sentences are formed as ergative constructions, i.e., transitive verbs in the past tense agree with the object rather than the subject of the sentence.

===Present and future===

Present and future tenses for the verb ''zanîn'' ( to know).

{| class="wikitable"

!Person!! 1st !! 2nd || 3rd ||Plural

|bizanim||bizanî||bizane||bizanin
|-
!Future
| -ê bizanim || -ê bizanî || -ê bizane|| -ê bizanin
|}

Past tenses for intransitive verb of ''hatin'' (to come).
{| class="wikitable"
|+
|-
!Person!! 1st !! 2nd || 3rd ||Plural
|-

|-
!Subjunctive preterite
|hatibim||hatibî||hatibe||hatibin
|-
!Past Conditional
|hatibama||hatibay(î)||hatiba||hatibana
|}

If a past transitive verb accepts a nominative personal suffix, it agrees with the object of the sentence.
Transitive past verbs in Sorani have OBL connected/dependent(not independent) personal pronouns on the object, if object is not mentioned they are on prefix or first part of the verb if the verb was compound, if there were not any prefix so they will be on the same place as th NOM ones.
OBL connected pronouns: -m, -t, -y, -man, -tan, -yan.
 personal suffixes (in contrast to intransitive verbs which always accept NOM. personal suffixes).

==Word order==
The normal word order in Kurdish is Subject-Object-Verb (S-O-V). Modifiers follow the nouns they modify.

The '''Oraon''' or '''Kurukh''' tribe ([[Kurukh language|Kurukh]]: ''Oṛāō&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' and ''Kuṛuḵẖ''), also spelled '''Uraon''', '''Oran''', or '''Oram''', are an [[Adivasi]] group inhabiting various states across central and [[East India|eastern]] [[India]], [[Rakhine State]] in [[Myanmar]], [[Bangladesh]], [[Nepal]], and [[Bhutan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://joshuaproject.net/people_groups/14210/BT|title=Oraon, Kurux in Bhutan|last=Project|first=Joshua|access-date=2017-12-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, Oraons depended on the forest and farms for their ritual and economic livelihood, but in recent times, a few of them have become mainly settled agriculturalists. Small numbers of Oraons have migrated to the northeastern part of India, where they are mainly employed in tea estates. Population estimates are unreliable, but the total population is estimated to be around 3.5 to 4.5 million people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/humanities/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/oraons |title=Oraons - Dictionary definition of Oraons |website=Encyclopedia.com |language=en |access-date=2017-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
"Oraon" is an exonym assigned by neighboring Munda peoples, meaning "to roam."&lt;ref&gt;Dalton E T, The Oraons, Descriptive Ethnology of Bengal, 1872. Section 1, page 215.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
According to the [[Indian Anthropological Society]], [[Konkan]] is said to be the original home of the Kurukh tribes, Kurukh Brahmins and Kshatriyas, from where they migrated to Northern India.&lt;ref name=IAS&gt;{{cite book|last=Indian Anthropological Society|title=Journal of the Indian Anthropological Society, Volumes 21-22|year=1986|publisher=Indian Anthropological Society|pages=See page 75}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Kurukh substratum is very prominent in the [[Konkani language]].&lt;ref name=mudns&gt;{{cite book|last=India. Office of the Registrar General|title=Census of India, 1961, Volume 1, Issue 1 Census of India, 1961, India. Office of the Registrar General|year=1961|publisher=Manager of Publications|location=67|pages=see page}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographic Distribution ==
Kurukhar are divided into many totemistic clans. They live all throughout the [[Chota Nagpur Plateau]] in east-central India: in [[Raigarh district|Raigarh]], [[Surguja district|Surguja]], and [[Jashpur district|Jashpur]] districts of [[Chhattisgarh]]; [[Ranchi district]] of [[Jharkhand]]; [[Jalpaiguri district]] of [[West Bengal]]; [[Sundergarh district]] of [[Odisha]], [[Bihar]]; [[Rakhine State]] in [[Myanmar]], and [[Bangladesh]]. A sizable number of Oraon have migrated to the northeastern part of India, where they are mainly employed in tea estates of [[West Bengal]], [[Assam]], and [[Tripura]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tribalzone.net/language/kurukh.htm |title=Kurukh |website=Tribalzone.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{user-generated inline|certain=y|date=January 2017}}

==Culture==
Gotra or Totem system plays very important role in the social structure of the Kurukh. Among the Oraons, the Gotra system is believed to directly relate to their god Lord Dharmesh’s desire to keep the social structure of the tribe pious. Gotra means that every single family in the Oraon tribe trace their roots to their ancestors’ respective families, each of these families further traced their roots to their unique Gotra. It is also believed that these auspicious living beings helped their ancestors’ families to come out of the difficult times and as a result the entire generations of the families of a certain Gotra are indebted to them.

Since time immemorial The Oraon people have a rich range of folk songs, dances and tales,&lt;ref name="Hahn1906"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ferdinand Hahn|title=Blicke in die Geisteswelt der heidnischen Kols: Sammlung von Sagen, Märchen und Liedern der Oraon in Chota Nagpur|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NLrYAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=25 August 2012|year=1906|publisher=C. Bertelsmann}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as traditional musical instruments. Both men and women participate in dances, which are performed at social events and festivals. The Mandar, [[Naqareh|Nagara]] and Kartal are the main musical instruments. During festivals or any occasions of celebration they consume an alcoholic drink called ''handiya'', a rice wine made from fermented rice, which distributed among all villagers in a ''Dona'', a bowl of leaves.

Kurukh [[Brahmins]] and [[Kshatriya]] follow Lord [[Shiva]] and Goddess [[Durga]]. But, they are not related to Kurukh Tribes.

==Tribal Administration &amp; Justice==

A unit of 5 villages represented a sector like today's Gram Panchayat. The unit of 33 villages was called RajiParha and it was headed by the king himself. With the help of this federal structured Parha the king was able to implement various schemes for
the development of the subjects. The citizens were provided due justice through these Parha units. The law and order were perfectly maintained by the employed heads of each Parha unit. These administrative units of the Parha were, however, paralysed
in the course of the Muslim invasions. The Orams establish concrete link of the history of Parha with that of the Indian independence movement.

Mahatma Gandhi, according to them, came to know  about the merits of the Parha organization when he visited Chotanagpur. Imbibing the functioning pattern of this old Parha organization, Mahatma Gandhi discovered a system of 'Panchayat Raj'. Due to PESA Padaha system of is still the best and cheapest justice system of Oraon tribe. They resolve their differences, set priority areas and take decisions for the welfare of the community.

==Religion==
===Sarna-Dharam (Sarnaism)===
The Oraon follow the Sarna Dharam ([[Sarnaism]]), which is based on nature worship. Some of the groups started following Sarnaism in a Hindu style, as the sects of the Bishnu Bhagats, Bacchinda Bhagats, Karmu Bhagats and Tana Bhagats. The Oraons have established several Sarna sects. Oraons worship Sun biri (a name given for Dharmesh). Kurukhar also believe in Animism.

Most of population is [[Sarnaism|Sarna]], which is a religion that is indigenous to [[Adivasi]]s in Central India.
Sarna perform religious rituals under the shade of a sacred grove. They worship the sun as Biri and the moon as Chando, and call the earth Dharti Aayo (Earth as mother). Chando Biri are the words which are used in Sarna pujas. Dharmesh is their supreme almighty god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=|title=History and Culture of the Oraon Tribe : Some Aspects of Their Social Life|last=Ghosh|first=Abhik|publisher=Mohit|year=2003|isbn=81-7445-196-X|location=|page=237|doi=|id=|authorlink=|coauthors=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hinduism ===
Kamru Bhagats (Oaron or Munda devotees) originated when Oarons acquired special powers after making a pilgrimage to [[Kamakhya]] in [[Assam]] to pay respect to [[Durga]].&lt;ref&gt;Jha, P. 41 ''India and Nepal''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kurukh [[Brahmin]] and [[Kshatriya]] are a caste of Hinduism. They believed in Lord [[Shiva]] and Goddess [[Durga]].

The Tana Bhagat was formed by Oaron saints Jatra Bhagat and Turia Bhagat. Tana Bhagats opposed the taxes imposed on them by the British and staged a [[Satyagraha]] movement even before [[Mahatma Gandhi]]. All Tana Bhagats were followers of Gandhi during the Independence movement. Tana Bhagats still wear a khadi kurta, dhoti and Gandhi topi (cap) with tricoloured flag in their topi. All Tana Bhagats perform puja to the Mahadeo and the tricolour with a chakra symbol on it, which is fixed at their courtyard.

=== Christianity ===
Among Christian Oraons, there are Roman Catholics and Protestants, the latter of which having several denominations.

==In popular culture==

In 1957, film-maker [[Ritwik Ghatak]] shot a preparatory test film named ''Oraon'' on the life of the [[Adivasi]]s of the [[Ranchi]] region in [[Jharkhand]] and on the Oraons of Rani Khatanga Village in Jharkhand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/133612/85b69f83ea77c6c93361a503b826c134.pdf?sequence=1 Cinema &amp; I pg.116] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125040537/http://ir.nmu.org.ua/bitstream/handle/123456789/133612/85b69f83ea77c6c93361a503b826c134.pdf?sequence=1 |date=November 25, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kutainese''' is a Kutai local languages spoken by the [[Kutainese people|Kutainese]], who live along the [[Mahakam River]] in [[Borneo]]. They are the principal population in the [[West Kutai Regency|West Kutai]], [[Kutai Kartanegara Regency|Kutai Kartanegara]], and [[East Kutai Regency|East Kutai]] Regencies.

Little literature was produced in Kutai during the period of administration of the [[Kutai Kartanegara Sultanate]] with most writing being done in Malay in the [[Jawi script]].

The three principal dialects, which have little [[mutual intelligibility]], are Tenggarong, Kota Bangun, and Ancalong Estuary.

==Description==

This sculpture consists of three pieces which display five figures with bulbous bodies (reminiscent of [[punching bag]]s). Three are huddled together having a conversation, while two are at opposite ends of the space, moving towards the three in conversation. The three figures seem almost violent in their discussion while the two who rush towards them show concern. They are placed on a grassy area of the sculpture garden.&lt;ref name="SIRIS"/&gt;

==Information==

''Last Conversation Piece'' served as the final in his "conversation piece" series. Muñoz became weary of the series and chose to expand out in styles as a protest of being lumped into a single sculptural genre.&lt;ref name="Muñoz"&gt;''Juan Muñoz''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32072">An '''official language''' is a [[language]] given a special legal status in a particular [[jurisdiction (area)|country, state, or other jurisdiction]]. Typically a country's official language refers to the language used within government (judiciary, legislature, administration).&lt;ref&gt;"Official Language", ''Concise Oxford Companion to the English Language'', Ed. Tom McArthur, Oxford University Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Since "the means of expression of a people cannot be changed by any law",&lt;ref&gt;[http://muniz-arguelles.com/resources/The+status+of+languages+in+Puerto+Rico.pdf ''The Status of Languages in Puerto Rico.''] Luis Muñiz-Arguelles. University of Puerto Rico. 1986. Page 466. Retrieved 23 November 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; the term "official language" does not typically refer to the language used by a people or country, but by its government.&lt;ref&gt;Pueblo v. Tribunal Superior, 92 D.P.R. 596 (1965). Translation taken from the English text, 92 P.R.R. 580 (1965), p. 588-589. See also LOPEZ-BARALT NEGRON, "Pueblo v.

Col. Ab. (P.R.) 843 (1975).&lt;/ref&gt;

About half the countries of the world have declared one or more official languages. The government of Italy officialised Italian only in 1999,&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;{{cite web|title=Legge 15 Dicembre 1999, n. 482 "Norme in materia di tutela delle minoranze linguistiche storiche" pubblicata nella Gazzetta Ufficiale n. 297 del 20 dicembre 1999|url=http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm|publisher=[[Italian Parliament]]|accessdate=2 December 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150512051856/http://www.camera.it/parlam/leggi/99482l.htm|archivedate=12 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and some nations (such as the United States) have never declared official languages at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official American|url=http://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/officialamerican/|website=PBS.org|publisher=MACNEIL/LEHRER PRODUCTIONS|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other nations have declared non-indigenous official languages. "The Philippines and parts of Africa live with a peculiar cultural paradox. Although the official languages [in Africa] may be French or English, these are not the languages most widely spoken by [the country's] residents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Official American|url=http://www.pbs.org/speak/seatosea/officialamerican/|website=PBS.org|publisher=MACNEIL/LEHRER PRODUCTIONS|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Worldwide, 178 countries have at least one official language, and 101 of these countries recognise more than one language. Many of the world's constitutions mention one or more official or [[national language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.constituteproject.org/search?lang=en&amp;key=lang|title=Read about "Official or national languages" on Constitute|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca/index.html|title=L'aménagement linguistique dans le monde: page d'accueil|website=www.axl.cefan.ulaval.ca|access-date=2016-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- it would be helpful to narrow this down to just the number of constitutions that mention "official language", or to be precise as to the number of constitutions mentioning each or both --&gt; Some countries use the official language designation to empower indigenous groups by giving them access to the government in their native languages. In countries that do not formally designate an official language, a ''[[de facto]]'' national language usually evolves. [[English language|English]] is the most common official language, with recognized status in 51 countries. [[Arabic]], [[French language|French]], and [[Spanish language|Spanish]] are also widely recognized.

An official language that is also an [[indigenous language]] is called ''endoglossic'', one that is not indigenous is ''exoglossic''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/endoglossic endoglossic] and [http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/exoglossic exoglossic] on [[OxfordDictionaries.com]].&lt;/ref&gt; An instance is [[Nigeria]] which has three endoglossic official languages. By this the country aims to protect the indigenous languages although at the same time recognising the English language as its lingua franca.

==History==
Around 500 BC, when [[Darius the Great]] annexed [[Achaemenid Assyria|Mesopotamia]] to the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]], he chose a form of the [[Aramaic language]] (the so-called [[Official Aramaic]] or Imperial Aramaic) as the vehicle for written communication between the different regions of the vast empire with its different peoples and languages.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} [[Aramaic script]] was widely employed from [[History of Achaemenid Egypt|Egypt]] in the southwest to [[Bactria]] and [[Sogdiana]] in the northeast. Texts were dictated in the native dialects and written down in Aramaic, and then read out again in the native language at the places they were received.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/aramaic-|title=ARAMAIC  – Encyclopaedia Iranica|first=|last=electricpulp.com|date=|website=www.iranicaonline.org|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[First Emperor of Qin]] standardized the written language of China after unifying the country in 221 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the Grand Historian, 6&lt;/ref&gt; [[Classical Chinese]] would remain the standard written language for the next 2000 years. Standardization of the spoken language received less political attention, and [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] developed on an ''ad hoc'' basis from the dialects of the various imperial capitals until being officially standardized in the early twentieth century.

==Statistics==
According to an undated chart by the American pro-English-only organization known as [[U.S. English (organization)|U.S. English]], 178 countries have an official language at the national level. Among those, [[English language|English]] is the most common with [[List of territorial entities where English is an official language|67 nations giving it official status]]. French is second with 29 countries, Arabic is third with 26 countries and Spanish is fourth with 19 countries, [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] is the official language of [[List of territorial entities where Portuguese is an official language|9 countries]] and [[List of territorial entities where German is an official language|German is official in 6]]. Some countries—like [[Australia]], [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]—have no official language recognized as such at national level. On the other extreme, [[Bolivia]] officially recognizes 37 languages, the most by any country in the world. Second to Bolivia is [[India]] with 23 official languages. [[South Africa]] is the country with the most official languages, all at equal status to one another&lt;ref name=ZAConst/&gt;, in the world. As Bolivia gives primacy to [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and India gives primacy to both English and [[Hindi]].&lt;ref name="economist.com"/&gt;

==Political alternatives==
{{see also|List of multilingual countries and regions}}
The selection of an official language (or no official language) is often contentious.&lt;ref name=Patten /&gt; An alternative to having a single official language is "official [[multilingualism]]", where a government recognizes multiple official languages. Under this system, all government services are available in all official languages. Each citizen may choose their preferred language when conducting business. Most countries are multilingual&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-WsDZsfTMsUC&amp;pg=PR11&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;dq=%2522most+countries+are+multilingual%2522&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ECXCNKSVfm&amp;sig=MdBP-Cm6VaoJhpfgDpjDbxQ6HBQ&amp;hl=gd&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiP6JvO0azJAhVDfxoKHaTNAQY4ChDoAQgnMAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%2522most%2520countries%2520are%2520multilingual%2522&amp;f=false|title=Between Natives and Foreigners: Selected Writings of Karl/Charles Follen (1796-1840)|last=Follen|first=Charles|last2=Mehring|first2=Frank|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=9780820497327|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many are officially multilingual. [[Taiwan]], [[Canada]], [[Philippines]], [[Belgium]], [[Switzerland]], and the [[European Union]] are examples of official multilingualism. This has been described as controversial and, in some other areas where it has been proposed, the idea has been rejected.&lt;ref name=Patten /&gt; It has also been described as necessary for the recognition of different groups&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t24AEb_ZY_0C|title=Representation and Democratic Theory|last=Laycock|first=David|date=2011-11-01|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=9780774841009|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as an advantage for the country in presenting itself to outsiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BfGrGLY8C9kC|title=The Routledge Handbook of Multilingualism|last=Martin-Jones|first=Marilyn|last2=Blackledge|first2=Adrian|last3=Creese|first3=Angela|date=2012-01-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9780415496476|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In specific countries/territories==

===Afghanistan===
{{Main|Languages of Afghanistan}}
In accordance with ''Chapter 1, Article 16'' of the [[Constitution of Afghanistan]], the [[Politics of Afghanistan|Afghan government]] gives equal status to [[Pashto language|Pashto]] and [[Dari language|Dari]] as official languages.

=== Belarus ===
{{Main| Belarusian language#History | l1=Belarusian since 1991}}
[[Belarusian language | Belarusian]] and [[Russian language | Russian]] have official status in the [[Republic of Belarus]].

===Canada===
{{Main|Official bilingualism in Canada}}
In accordance with the ''Constitution Act, 1982'' the (federal) [[Government of Canada]] gives equal status to English and French as official languages. The Province of [[New Brunswick]] is also officially bilingual, as is the [[Yukon]].  [[Nunavut]] has four official languages.  The [[Northwest Territories]] has eleven official languages.  All provinces, however, offer some necessary services in both English and French.

Canadian advocates{{which?|date=November 2017}} of a single official language say it promotes national identity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20100923090313/http://www.ocol-clo.gc.ca/docs/e/ola_llo_e.pdf ''Official Languages at the Heart of Our Identity: An overview of the Official Languages Act.''] Office of the Commissioner of Official Languages. Ottawa, Canada. Retrieved 26 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; In Canada, debate has focused on whether the local majority language should be made the exclusive language of public business. In the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], for example, laws restrict the use of the minority English in education, on signs, and in the workplace.&lt;ref name=Patten /&gt;

===Finland===
According to the Finnish constitution, [[Finnish language|Finnish]] and [[Swedish language|Swedish]] are the official languages of the republic. Citizens have the right to communicate in either language with government agencies. 

===Germany===
{{Main|Languages of Germany}}
[[German language|German]] is the official language of [[Germany]]. However, its [[minority language]]s include [[Sorbian language|Sorbian]] ([[Upper Sorbian]] and [[Lower Sorbian]]), [[Romani language|Romani]], [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[North Frisian language|North Frisian]], which are officially recognised. Migrant languages like Turkish, Russian and Spanish are widespread, but are not officially recognised languages.

===Hong Kong===
{{Main|Languages of Hong Kong|}}
[[Hong Kong]] has two official languages: English and [[Chinese language|Chinese]]. [[Hong Kong Cantonese]] is used in daily conversation and [[Traditional Chinese characters|Traditional Chinese]] used to be the only writing system{{cn|date=November 2017}} in Hong Kong before the 1997 handover. However, in [[Mainland China]] the official language is [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[Simplified Chinese characters|Simplified Chinese]] is used as the standard writing system. As time goes by, signage in simplified characters has gained some popularity in a few areas. Some companies may have changed the characters of the signs whilst nearly all Hong Kong people continue to use traditional characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= War between Traditional and Simplified |date= 7 May 2014|publisher= anthony8988 |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=frLsSX_62W4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Constitution of India]]  ([[Part XVII of the Constitution of India |part 17]]) designates the official language of the Government of India as English as well as [[Standard Hindi]] written in the Devanagari script.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU= |title= Constitutional Provisions: Official Language Related Part-17 of The Constitution Of India |publisher= Department of Official Language, [[Government of India]] |accessdate= 1 July 2015 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20160201081439/http://rajbhasha.nic.in/UI/pagecontent.aspx?pc=MzU%3D |archivedate= 1 February 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{qn|date=November 2017}}

In addition, the Government of India has awarded the distinction of classical language to [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Sanskrit]], [[Kannada]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam]] and [[Odia language|Odia]].

===Israel===
{{Main|Languages of Israel|}}
On 19 July 2018, the [[Knesset]] passed a [[Basic Laws of Israel|basic law]] under the title [[Basic Law: Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People|Israel as the Nation-State of the Jewish People]], which defines [[Hebrew]] as "the State's language" and Arabic as a language with "a special status in the State" (article 4). The law further says that it should not be interpreted as compromising the status of the [[Arabic]] language in practice prior to the enactment of the basic law, namely, it preserves the status quo and changes the status of Hebrew and Arabic only nominally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/19/world/middleeast/israel-law-jews-arabic.html|title=Israeli Law Declares the Country the ‘Nation-State of the Jewish People’|last=Halbfinger|first=David M.|date=19 July 2018|work=New York Times|access-date=2018-07-24|last2=Kershner|first2=Isabel|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the enactment of the aforementioned basic law, the status of official language in Israel was determined by the 82nd paragraph of the "[[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] [[Order in Council]]" issued on [https://web.archive.org/web/20081221030238/http://domino.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/361eea1cc08301c485256cf600606959/c7aae196f41aa055052565f50054e656!OpenDocument 14 August 1922], for the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|British Mandate of Palestine]], as amended in 1939:&lt;ref&gt;''The Palestine Gazette'', No. 898 of 29 June 1939, Supplement 2, pp. 464–465.&lt;/ref&gt;

:"All Ordinances, official notices and official forms of the Government and all official notices of local authorities and municipalities in areas to be prescribed by order of the High Commissioner, shall be published in English, Arabic and Hebrew."
This law, like most other laws of the British Mandate, was adopted in the State of Israel, subject to certain amendments published by the provisional [[legislative branch]] on 19 May 1948. The amendment states that:
:"Any provision in the law requiring the use of the English language is repealed."&lt;ref name=IL1&gt;Law and Administration Ordinance No 1 of 5708—1948, clause 15(b). Official Gazette No. 1 of 5th Iyar, 5708; as per authorised translation in ''Laws of the State of Israel'', Vol. I (1948) p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

In most [[State school|public schools]], the main teaching language is Hebrew, English is taught as a second language, and most students learn a third language, usually Arabic but not necessarily. Other public schools have Arabic as their main teaching language, and they teach Hebrew as a second language and English as a third one. There are also bilingual schools which aim to teach in both Hebrew and Arabic equally. 

Some languages other than Hebrew and Arabic, such as English, Russian, [[Amharic]], [[Yiddish]] and [[Judaeo-Spanish|Ladino]] enjoy a somewhat special status, but are not considered{{by whom?|date=November 2017}} to be official languages. For instance, at least 5% of the broadcasting time of privately owned TV-channels must be translated into Russian (a similar privilege is granted to Arabic), warnings must be translated to several languages, signs are mostly trilingual (Hebrew, Arabic and English), and the government supports Yiddish and Ladino culture (alongside Hebrew culture and Arabic culture).

===Latvia===
The [[Constitution of Latvia]] (or Satversme) designated [[Latvian language|Latvian]] as the state language. In 2012 there was initiative to hold [[Latvian constitutional referendum, 2012|a referendum]] on constitutional amendments, elevating [[Russian language|Russian]] as a state language. Kristīne Jarinovska in her analysis describes the proposal in the following way: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;It proposed several constitutional amendments for introducing Russian as Latvia's second official language—i.e., amendments to the Satversme’s Articles 4 (on Latvian as the state language), 18 (on the solemn promise of a member of Parliament to strengthen the Latvian language), 21 (on Latvian as the working language of the Parliament), 101 (on Latvian as the working language of local governments), and 104 (on the right to receive a reply to a petition in Latvian). Obviously, the proposed amendments would have influenced other constitutional norms as well. Moreover, since Article 4 of the Satversme alike norms of independence, democracy, sovereignty, territorial wholeness, and basic principles of elections that form the core of the Satversme (according to Article 77 of the Satversme), the initiative, in fact, proposed discontinuing an existing state and establishing a new one that is no longer a nation-state wherein Latvians exercise their rights to self-determination, enjoying and maintaining their cultural uniqueness&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.juridicainternational.eu/index.php?id=15331 Jarinovska, K.

===New Zealand===
[[New Zealand]] has three official languages. English is the ''[[de facto]]'' and  principle official language, accepted in all situations. The [[Māori language]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] both have limited ''[[de jure]]'' official status under the [[Māori Language Act 1987]] and [[New Zealand Sign Language]] Act 2006&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0018/latest/whole.html ''New Zealand Sign Language Act 2006.''] New Zealand Legislation.

===Yugoslavia===
Sometimes an official language definition can be motivated more by national identity than by linguistic concerns. When [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] dissolved in 1991, the country had four official languages—[[Serbo-Croatian]], [[Slovene language|Slovene]], [[Albanian language|Albanian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]]. Serbo-Croatian was used as a ''[[lingua franca]]'' for mutual understanding and was also the language of the military. 

When [[Croatia]] declared independence (1991) it defined its official language as [[Croatian language|Croatian]], and [[Serbia]] likewise defined{{when?|date=November 2017}} its official language as [[Serbian language|Serbian]]. [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] defined three official languages: [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]], Croatian, and Serbian. From the linguistic point of view, the different names refer to national varieties of the same language, which is known under the appellation of Serbo-Croatian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mørk |first=Henning |year=2002 |language=Danish |title=Serbokroatisk grammatik: substantivets morfologi |trans-title=Serbo-Croatian Grammar: Noun Morphology |series=Arbejdspapirer ; vol. 1 |location=Århus |publisher=Slavisk Institut, Århus Universitet |page=unpaginated (Preface) |oclc=471591123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Václav Blažek, "On the Internal Classification of Indo-European Languages: Survey" [http://www.phil.muni.cz/linguistica/art/blazek/bla-003.pdf retrieved 20 Oct 2010], pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kordić |first=Snježana |authorlink=Snježana Kordić |editor1-last=Madelain |editor1-first=Anne |title=Au sud de l'Est |series=vol. 3 |publisher=Non Lieu |pages=71–78 |language=French |chapter=La langue croate, serbe, bosniaque et monténégrine |trans-chapter=Croatian, Serbian, Bosniakian, and Montenegrin |chapterurl=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |deadurl=no |location=Paris |year=2007 |isbn=978-2-35270-036-4 |oclc=182916790 |archivedate=4 August 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/69f5WqGAx?url=http://bib.irb.hr/datoteka/429734.LA_LANGUE_CROATE_SERBE.PDF |accessdate=8 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said by some{{by whom|date=May 2018}} that the Bosnian government chose to define three languages to reinforce [[Ethnic groups in Bosnia and Herzegovina|ethnic differences]] and keep the country divided.&lt;ref&gt;

In [[traditional grammar]], a '''part of speech''' (abbreviated form: '''PoS''' or '''POS''') is a category of words (or, more generally, of [[lexical item]]s) which have similar [[grammar|grammatical]] properties. Words that are assigned to the same part of speech generally display similar behavior in terms of [[syntax]]—they play similar roles within the grammatical structure of sentences—and sometimes in terms of [[morphology (linguistics)|morphology]], in that they undergo [[inflection]] for similar properties. Commonly listed [[English language|English]] parts of speech are ''[[noun]]'', ''[[verb]]'', ''[[adjective]]'', ''[[adverb]]'', ''[[pronoun]]'', ''[[preposition]]'', ''[[conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]]'', ''[[interjection]]'', and sometimes ''[[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]'', ''[[article (grammar)|article]]'' or ''[[determiner]]''.

Essentially all these word classes exist within all [[Indo-European languages]],&lt;ref&gt;Part 3.1 first line of [https://indo-european.info/indo-european-grammar.html]&lt;/ref&gt; even though articles might sometimes be considered as a part of a noun. Other European languages such as [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] and [[Finnish language|Finnish]] that belong to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic language family]] may completely lack prepositions or only have very few of them; rather, they have [[postposition]]s.

A part of speech—particularly in more modern classifications, which often make more precise distinctions than the traditional scheme does—may also be called a '''word class''', '''lexical class''', or '''lexical category''', although the term ''lexical category'' refers in some contexts to a particular type of [[syntactic category]], and may thus exclude parts of speech that are considered to be [[function word|functional]], such as pronouns. The term '''form class''' is also used, although this has various conflicting definitions.&lt;ref&gt;John Lyons, ''Semantics'', CUP 1977, p. 424.&lt;/ref&gt; Word classes may be classified as [[#Open and closed classes|open or closed]]: ''open classes'' (like nouns, verbs and adjectives) acquire new members constantly, while ''closed classes'' (such as pronouns and conjunctions) acquire new members infrequently, if at all.

Almost all languages have the word classes ''noun'' and ''verb'', but beyond these there are significant variations in different languages.&lt;ref name="Kroeger 2005 35"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kroeger|first=Paul|title=Analyzing Grammar: An Introduction|year=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-01653-7|pages=35}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] has as many as [[Japanese adjectives|three classes of adjective]]s where [[English language|English]] has one (not to be confused with the seven (7) types of English adjectives, or the fact that English adjectives can modify both nouns and pronouns); [[Chinese language|Chinese]], [[Korean language|Korean]], [[Japanese language|Japanese]] and [[Vietnamese language|Vietnamese]] have a class of [[classifier (linguistics)|nominal classifier]]s; many languages lack a distinction between adjectives and adverbs, or between adjectives and verbs (see [[stative verb]]). This variation in the number of categories and their identifying properties means that analysis needs to be done for each individual language. Nevertheless, the labels for each category are assigned on the basis of universal criteria.&lt;ref name="Kroeger 2005 35"/&gt;

==History==
The classification of words into lexical categories is found from the earliest moments in the [[history of linguistics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Robins RH |year=1989 |title=General Linguistics |edition=4th |location=London |publisher=Longman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In the ''[[Nirukta]]'', written in the 5th or 6th century BC, the [[Sanskrit]] grammarian [[Yāska]] defined four main categories of words:&lt;ref name=Matilal&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# नाम ''nāma'' – [[noun]] (including adjective)
# आख्यात ''ākhyāta'' – [[verb]]
# उपसर्ग ''upasarga'' – pre-verb or [[prefix]]
# निपात ''nipāta'' – [[Grammatical particle|particle]], invariant word (perhaps [[preposition]])
These four were grouped into two larger classes: [[inflection|inflectable]] (nouns and verbs) and uninflectable (pre-verbs and particles).

The ancient work on the grammar of the [[Tamil language]], ''[[Tolkāppiyam]]'', argued to have been written around 2,500 years ago, classifies Tamil words as ''peyar'' (பெயர்; noun), ''vinai'' (வினை; verb), ''idai'' (part of speech which modifies the relationships between verbs and nouns), and ''uri'' (word that further qualifies a noun or verb).&lt;ref name=Ilakkuvan&gt;

===Western tradition===
A century or two after the work of Nirukta, the [[Classical Greece|Greek]] scholar [[Plato]] wrote in his [[Cratylus (dialogue)|''Cratylus'' dialog]] that "... sentences are, I conceive, a combination of verbs [''rhêma''] and nouns [''ónoma'']".&lt;ref&gt;Cratylus 431b&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] added another class, "conjunction" [''sýndesmos''], which included not only the words known today as [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunctions]], but also other parts (the interpretations differ; in one interpretation it is [[pronoun]]s, [[preposition]]s, and the [[article (grammar)|article]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Rhetoric, Poetic and Nicomachean Ethics of Aristotle'', translated by Thomas Taylor, London 1811, p. 179.&lt;/ref&gt;).

By the end of the 2nd century BC grammarians had expanded this classification scheme into eight categories, seen in the ''[[Art of Grammar]]'', attributed to [[Dionysius Thrax]]:&lt;ref&gt;[[Dionysius Thrax]]. τέχνη γραμματική (Art of Grammar), [http://www.hs-augsburg.de/~harsch/graeca/Chronologia/S_ante02/DionysiosThrax/dio_tech.html#11 ια´ περὶ  λέξεως (11. On the word)]:

:A word is the smallest part of organized speech.&lt;br&gt;Speech is the putting together of an ordinary word to express a complete thought.&lt;br&gt;The class of word consists of eight categories: noun, verb,&lt;br&gt;participle, article, pronoun, preposition, adverb, conjunction. A common noun in form is classified as a noun.&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Noun]] (''ónoma''): a part of speech inflected for [[grammatical case|case]], signifying a concrete or abstract entity
# [[Verb]] (''rhêma''): a part of speech without case inflection, but inflected for [[grammatical tense|tense]], [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]], signifying an activity or process performed or undergone
# [[Participle]] (''metokhḗ''): a part of speech sharing features of the verb and the noun
# [[Article (grammar)|Article]] (''árthron''): a declinable part of speech, taken to include the definite article, but also the basic [[relative pronoun]] 
# [[Pronoun]] (''antōnymíā''): a part of speech substitutable for a noun and marked for a person
# [[Preposition]] (''próthesis''): a part of speech placed before other words in composition and in syntax
# [[Adverb]] (''epírrhēma''): a part of speech without inflection, in modification of or in addition to a verb, adjective, clause, sentence, or other adverb
# [[Grammatical conjunction|Conjunction]] (''sýndesmos''): a part of speech binding together the discourse and filling gaps in its interpretation

It can be seen that these parts of speech are defined by [[morphology (linguistics)|morphological]], [[Syntax|syntactic]] and [[Semantics|semantic]] criteria.

The [[Latin grammar|Latin]] grammarian [[Priscian]] ([[floruit|fl.]] 500 AD) modified the above eightfold system, excluding "article" (since the [[Latin language]], unlike Greek, does not have articles), but adding "[[interjection]]".&lt;ref&gt;[penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Quintilian/Institutio_Oratoria/1B*.html This translation of Quintilian's ''Institutio Oratoria'' reads: "Our own language (Note: i.e. Latin) dispenses with the articles (Note: Latin doesn't have articles), which are therefore distributed among the other parts of speech. But interjections must be added to those already mentioned."]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thelatinlibrary.com/quintilian/quintilian.institutio1.shtml|title= Quintilian: Institutio Oratoria I|publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Latin names for the parts of speech, from which the corresponding modern English terms derive, were ''nomen'', ''verbum'', ''participium'', ''pronomen'', ''praepositio'', ''adverbium'', ''conjunctio'' and ''interjectio''. The category ''nomen'' included [[substantive]]s (''nomen substantivum'', corresponding to what are today called nouns in English), [[adjective]]s ''(nomen adjectivum)'' and [[Numeral (linguistics)|numeral]]s ''(nomen numerale)''. This is reflected in the older English terminology ''noun substantive'', ''noun adjective'' and ''noun numeral''. Later&lt;ref&gt;See for example Beauzée, Nicolas, ''Grammaire générale, ou exposition raisonnée des éléments nécessaires du langage'' (Paris, 1767), and earlier Jakob Redinger, [https://books.google.com/books?id=C7BeAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA11 ''Comeniana Grammatica Primae Classi Franckenthalensis Latinae Scholae destinata ...''] (1659, in German and Latin).&lt;/ref&gt; the adjective became a separate class, as often did the numerals, and the English word ''noun'' came to be applied to substantives only.

Works of [[English grammar]] generally follow the pattern of the European tradition as described above, except that participles are now usually regarded as forms of verbs rather than as a separate part of speech, and numerals are often conflated with other parts of speech: nouns ([[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal numeral]]s, e.g., "one", and [[collective numeral]]s, e.g., "dozen"), adjectives ([[Ordinal number (linguistics)|ordinal numeral]]s, e.g., "first", and [[Multiplier (linguistics)|multiplier numeral]]s, e.g., "single") and adverbs ([[Multiplicative number (linguistics)|multiplicative numeral]]s, e.g., "once", and [[Distributive number|distributive numeral]]s, e.g., "singly"). Eight or nine parts of speech are commonly listed:

# [[noun]]
# [[verb]]
# [[adjective]]
# [[adverb]]
# [[pronoun]]
# [[preposition]]
# [[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]
# [[interjection]]
# [[article (grammar)|article]] or (more recently) [[determiner]]

Some modern classifications define further classes in addition to these. For discussion see the sections below.

The classification below, or slight expansions of it, is still followed in most [[dictionaries]]: 
;Noun (names): a word or lexical item denoting any abstract (abstract noun: e.g. ''home'') or concrete entity (concrete noun: e.g. ''house''); a person (''police officer'', ''Michael''), place (''coastline'', ''London''), thing (''necktie'', ''television''), idea (''happiness''), or quality (''bravery''). Nouns can also be classified as [[count noun]]s or [[mass noun|non-count nouns]]; some can belong to either category. The most common part of speech; they are called naming words.
;Pronoun (replace or again placed): a substitute for a noun or noun phrase (''them, he''). Pronouns make sentences shorter and clearer since they replace nouns.
;Adjective (describes, limits): a modifier of a noun or pronoun (''big, brave''). Adjectives make the meaning of another word (noun) more precise.
;Verb (states action or being): a word denoting an action (''walk''), occurrence (''happen''), or state of being (''be''). Without a verb a group of words cannot be a clause or sentence.
;Adverb (describes, limits): a modifier of an adjective, verb, or another adverb (''very, quite''). Adverbs make language more precise.
;Preposition (relates): a word that relates words to each other in a phrase or sentence and aids in syntactic context (''in, of''). Prepositions show the relationship between a noun or a pronoun with another word in the sentence.
;Conjunction (connects): a syntactic connector; links words, phrases, or clauses (''and, but''). Conjunctions connect words or group of words
;Interjection (expresses feelings and emotions): an emotional greeting or exclamation (''Huzzah, Alas''). Interjections express strong feelings and emotions.
;Article (describes, limits): a grammatical marker of definiteness (''the'') or indefiniteness (''a, an'').  The article is not always listed among the parts of speech.  It is considered by some grammarians to be a type of adjective&lt;ref&gt;https://The {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160112094626/http://the/ |date=2016-01-12 }} Oxford Dictionary of English Grammar by Bas Aarts, Sylvia Chalker &amp; Edmund Weine. OUP Oxford 2014. Page 35.&lt;/ref&gt; or sometimes the term '[[determiner]]' (a broader class) is used.
  
English words are not generally [[marker (linguistics)|marked]] as belonging to one part of speech or another; this contrasts with many other European languages, which use [[inflection]] more extensively, meaning that a given word form can often be identified as belonging to a particular part of speech and having certain additional [[grammatical category|grammatical properties]]. In English, most words are uninflected, while the inflected endings that exist are mostly ambiguous: ''[[-ed]]'' may mark a verbal past tense, a participle or a fully adjectival form; ''[[-s (disambiguation)|-s]]'' may mark a plural noun or a present-tense verb form; ''[[-ing]]'' may mark a participle, [[gerund]], or pure adjective or noun. Although ''[[-ly]]'' is a frequent adverb marker, some adverbs (e.g. ''tomorrow'', ''fast'', ''very'') do not have that ending, while some adjectives do have that ending (e.g. ''friendly'', ''ugly'', ''lovely'').

Many English words can belong to more than one part of speech. Words like ''neigh'', ''break'', ''outlaw'', ''laser'', ''microwave'', and ''telephone'' might all be either verbs or nouns. In certain circumstances, even words with primarily grammatical functions can be used as verbs or nouns, as in, "We must look to the ''hows'' and not just the ''whys''." The process whereby a word comes to be used as a different part of speech is called [[conversion (word formation)|conversion]] or zero derivation.

==Functional classification==
[[Linguists]] recognize that the above list of eight or nine word classes is drastically simplified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Zwicky | first=Arnold | date=30 March 2006 | title=What part of speech is "the" | work=[[Language Log]] | url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002974.html | accessdate=26 December 2009 | quote=...the school tradition about parts of speech is so desperately impoverished}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "adverb" is to some extent a catch-all class that includes words with many different functions. Some have even argued that the most basic of category distinctions, that of nouns and verbs, is unfounded,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hopper |first1=P |last2=Thompson |first2=S |year=1985 |chapter=The Iconicity of the Universal Categories 'Noun' and 'Verbs' |title=Typological Studies in Language: Iconicity and Syntax |editor=John Haiman |volume=6 |pages=151–183 |location=Amsterdam |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt; or not applicable to certain languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Launey |first=Michel |year=1994 |title=Une grammaire omniprédicative: essai sur la morphosyntaxe du nahuatl classique |location=Paris |publisher=CNRS Editions}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Broschart |first=Jürgen |year=1997 |title=Why Tongan does it differently: Categorial Distinctions in a Language without Nouns and Verbs |journal=Linguistic Typology |volume=1 |issue=2 |pages=123–165 |doi=10.1515/lity.1997.1.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern linguists have proposed many different schemes whereby the words of English or other languages are placed into more specific categories and subcategories based on a more precise understanding of their grammatical functions.

Common lexical categories defined by function may include the following (not all of them will necessarily be applicable in a given language):
* Categories that will usually be [[#Open and closed classes|open classes]]:
**[[adjective]]s
**[[adverb]]s 
**[[noun]]s
**[[verb]]s (except auxiliary verbs)
** [[interjection]]s
* Categories that will usually be closed classes:
**[[auxiliary verb]]s
**[[clitic]]s
**[[coverb]]s
**[[Grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s
**[[determiner (class)|determiner]]s ([[article (grammar)|article]]s, [[Quantifier (linguistics)|quantifier]]s, [[demonstrative adjective]]s, and [[possessive adjective]]s)
**[[grammatical particle|particle]]s
**[[measure word]]s or [[classifier (linguistics)|classifier]]s
**[[adposition]]s (prepositions, postpositions, and circumpositions)
**[[preverb]]s
**[[pronoun]]s
**[[Contraction (grammar)|contraction]]s
**[[Cardinal number (linguistics)|cardinal number]]s

Within a given category, subgroups of words may be identified based on more precise grammatical properties. For example, verbs may be specified according to the number and type of [[object (grammar)|object]]s or other [[complement (grammar)|complement]]s which they take. This is called [[subcategorization]].

Many modern descriptions of grammar include not only lexical categories or word classes, but also ''phrasal categories'', used to classify [[phrase]]s, in the sense of groups of words that form units having specific grammatical functions. Phrasal categories may include [[noun phrase]]s (NP), [[verb phrase]]s (VP) and so on. Lexical and phrasal categories together are called [[syntactic categories]].

==Open and closed classes ==
{{See also|Function word|Content word}}

Word classes may be either open or closed. An '''open class''' is one that commonly accepts the addition of new words, while a '''closed class''' is one to which new items are very rarely added. Open classes normally contain large numbers of words, while closed classes are much smaller. Typical open classes found in English and many other languages are [[noun]]s, [[verb]]s (excluding [[auxiliary verbs]], if these are regarded as a separate class), [[adjective]]s, [[adverb]]s and [[interjection]]s. [[Ideophone]]s are often an open class, though less familiar to English speakers,&lt;ref name="guide99"&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA99 p. 99]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Tucker Childs, "African ideophones", in ''Sound Symbolism,''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uov84NavOR8C&amp;pg=PA179 p. 179]&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|name=ideophones|1=Ideophones do not always form a single grammatical word class, and their classification varies between languages, sometimes being split across other word classes. Rather, they are a phonosemantic word class, based on derivation, but may be considered part of the category of "expressives",&lt;ref name="guide99"/&gt; which thus often form an open class due to the productivity of ideophones. Further, "[i]n the vast majority of cases, however, ideophones perform an adverbial function and are closely linked with verbs."&lt;ref&gt;G. Tucker Childs, "African ideophones", in ''Sound Symbolism,''  [https://books.google.com/books?id=Uov84NavOR8C&amp;pg=PA181 p. 181]&lt;/ref&gt;}} and are often open to [[nonce word]]s. Typical closed classes are [[preposition]]s (or postpositions), [[determiner]]s, [[grammatical conjunction|conjunction]]s, and [[pronoun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://strazny.com/encyclopedia/sample-function-words.html|title=Sample Entry: Function Words / Encyclopedia of Linguistics|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The open–closed distinction is related to the distinction between [[syntactic category|lexical and functional categories]], and to that between [[content word]]s and [[function word]]s, and some authors consider these identical, but the connection is not strict. Open classes are generally lexical categories in the stricter sense, containing words with greater semantic content,&lt;ref name="Lexical and Functional categories"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|title=Syntax: A Generative Introduction|year=2012|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=New Jersey|isbn=978-0-470-65531-3|pages=51–52}}&lt;/ref&gt; while closed classes are normally functional categories, consisting of words that perform essentially grammatical functions. This is not universal: in many languages verbs and adjectives&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1075/sl.1.1.04dix| title = Where Have all the Adjectives Gone?| journal = Studies in Language| volume = 1| pages = 19–80| year = 1977| last = Dixon | first = Robert M. W. | authorlink = Robert M. W. Dixon}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dixon2006"&gt;''Adjective classes: a cross-linguistic typology,'' [[Robert M. W. Dixon]], Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, OUP Oxford, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guide97"&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 p. 97]&lt;/ref&gt; are closed classes, usually consisting of few members, and in Japanese the formation of new pronouns from existing nouns is relatively common, though to what extent these form a distinct word class is debated.

Words are added to open classes through such processes as [[Compound (linguistics)|compounding]], [[Morphological derivation|derivation]], [[Coining (linguistics)|coining]], and [[Borrowing (linguistics)|borrowing]]. When a new word is added through some such process, it can subsequently be used grammatically in sentences in the same ways as other words in its class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hoff|first=Erika|title=Language Development|year=2014|publisher=Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|isbn=978-1-133-93909-2|page=171}}&lt;/ref&gt; A closed class may obtain new items through these same processes, but such changes are much rarer and take much more time. A closed class is normally seen as part of the core language and is not expected to change. In English, for example, new nouns, verbs, etc. are being added to the language constantly (including by the common process of [[verbing]] and other types of [[conversion (word formation)|conversion]], where an existing word comes to be used in a different part of speech). However, it is very unusual for a new pronoun, for example, to become accepted in the language, even in cases where there may be felt to be a need for one, as in the case of [[Gender-neutral pronoun#English|gender-neutral pronouns]].

The open or closed status of word classes varies between languages, even assuming that corresponding word classes exist. Most conspicuously, in many languages verbs and adjectives form closed classes of content words. An extreme example is found in [[Jingulu language|Jingulu]], which has only three verbs, while even the modern Indo-European [[Persian language|Persian]] has no more than a few hundred simple verbs, a great deal of which are archaic. (Some twenty Persian verbs are used as [[light verb]]s to form compounds; this lack of lexical verbs is shared with other Iranian languages.) Japanese is similar, having few lexical verbs.&lt;ref&gt;''Categorial Features: A Generative Theory of Word Class Categories,'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=QoNIBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT54 p. 54]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Basque verbs]] are also a closed class, with the vast majority of verbal senses instead expressed periphrastically.

In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], verbs and adjectives are closed classes,{{sfn|Dixon|1977|p=48}} though these are quite large, with about 700 adjectives,&lt;ref&gt;''The Typology of Adjectival Predication,'' Harrie Wetzer, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ORUUwhdDPpUC&amp;pg=PA311 p. 311]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guide96"&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA96 p. 96]&lt;/ref&gt; and verbs have opened slightly in recent years. [[Japanese adjectives]] are closely related to verbs (they can predicate a sentence, for instance). New verbal meanings are nearly always expressed periphrastically by appending {{Nihongo||する|suru|to do}} to a noun, as in {{Nihongo||運動する|undō suru|to (do) exercise}}, and new adjectival meanings are nearly always expressed by [[adjectival noun (Japanese)|adjectival noun]]s, using the suffix {{Nihongo||〜な|-na}} when an adjectival noun modifies a noun phrase, as in {{Nihongo||変なおじさん|hen-na ojisan|strange {{not a typo|man}}&lt;!-- do NOT translate this a "uncle" --&gt;}}. The closedness of verbs has weakened in recent years, and in a few cases new verbs are created by appending {{Nihongo||〜る|-ru}} to a noun or using it to replace the end of a word. This is mostly in casual speech for borrowed words, with the most well-established example being {{Nihongo||サボる|sabo-ru|cut class; play hooky}}, from {{Nihongo||サボタージュ|sabotāju|sabotage}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://japaneselevelup.com/homage-to-るru-the-magical-verbifier/ |title=Homage to る(ru), The Magical Verbifier |date= 2011-07-18 |author=[http://japaneselevelup.com/author/adshap8/ Adam]}}&lt;/ref&gt; This recent innovation aside, the huge contribution of [[Sino-Japanese vocabulary]] was almost entirely borrowed as nouns (often verbal nouns or adjectival nouns). Other languages where adjectives are closed class include Swahili,&lt;ref name="guide97"/&gt; [[Bemba language|Bemba]], and [[Luganda]].

By contrast, [[Japanese pronouns]] are open class—if they can even be considered a class—and nouns become used as pronouns with some frequency; a recent example {{Nihongo||自分|jibun|self}}, now used by some young men as a first-person pronoun. The status of Japanese pronouns as a distinct class is disputed, however, with some considering it only a use of nouns, not a distinct class. The case is similar in languages of Southeast Asia, including Thai and Lao, in which, like Japanese, pronouns and terms of address vary significantly based on relative social standing and respect.&lt;ref name="guide98"&gt;''The Art of Grammar: A Practical Guide,'' Alexandra Y. Aikhenvald, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XFBVBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98 p. 98]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some word classes are universally closed, however, including demonstratives and interrogative words.&lt;ref name="guide98"/&gt;

'''Paumarí''' (also '''Paumari''', '''Purupuru''', '''Kurukuru''', '''Pamari''', '''Purupurú''', '''Pammari''', '''Curucuru''', '''Palmari''') is an [[Arauan languages|Arauan language]] spoken in [[Brazil]] by about 300 older adults out of an ethnic population of 900. It is spoken by the [[Paumari Indians]], who call their language “Pamoari”.  The word “Pamoari” has several different meanings in the Paumarí language: ‘man,’ ‘people,’ ‘human being,’ and ‘client.’ These multiple meanings stem from their different relationships with outsiders; presumably it means ‘human being’ when they refer to themselves to someone of ostensibly equal status, and ‘client’ when referring to their people among river traders and Portuguese speakers.

Increasingly, speakers of Arawan languages, particularly Paumarí (who have had the most contact with non-natives) are beginning to speak [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]].  The result, for many of the speakers in Paumarí, is a hybrid of Portuguese and Paumarí, incorporating vocabulary from both languages while retaining the syntax of neither (Chapman, a researcher from the [[Summer Institute of Linguistics]], claims that, at the time of her arrival in 1964, all Paumarí spoke a mixture of Paumarí and Portuguese).   Out of the Paumarí group that inhabits the [[Tapauá River]], the youth, which makes up nearly a majority of the population, spoke only Portuguese in 1964.  This ‘[[linguistic Creole]]’ tendency in the Paumarí language highlights exactly why languages such as Paumarí are endangered.

It is a largely [[head-marking language]] with unmarked [[Verb–object–subject|VOS]] order and an [[ergative case|ergative]] alignment for marking of [[noun]]s combined with accusative marking of pronouns.

Paumarí has only two open word classes - nouns and [[verb]]s. However, it also has numerous closed classes including fourteen [[adjective]]s, [[adposition]]s, [[interjection]]s, conjunctions and demonstratives. Paumarí nouns are elaborately divided into over one hundred possessed nouns and a larger number of free nouns. Furthermore, each free noun has [[grammatical gender]] - being either masculine or feminine, with feminine being the unmarked gender and indicated by the [[suffix]] ''-ni''.

Verb roots have up to fifteen suffix positions, but all are only optionally filled. Most of these refer to location or aspect, plus a negative suffix ''-ra''.

==Phonology==
Paumarí has a larger consonant inventory than most languages of the Amazon Basin, and is notable for featuring bilabial and coronal [[implosive consonant|implosives]], which have been lost from other [[Arauan languages]] but are reconstructed clearly for the protolanguage of the family. It is one of very few languages in the New World to contrast implosives with other voiced stop consonants: similar contrasts are known only for a few other Amazonian languages. However, it has a very simple vowel system with only three contrastive vowels, the back one of which can range from {{IPA|[o]}} to {{IPA|[u]}}.

Paumarí has a (C)V [[syllable structure]]: a syllable can only contain one vowel, which may or may not be preceded by a consonant. This is consistent among all Arawan languages (Dixon (1999), 295). Often two vowels will occur in a sequence, CVV, however, the length of the resulting syllable{{clarify|reason=wasn't only one V supposed to be possible|date=December 2013}} will often make a phonetic difference between the two vowels, and the syllable’s duration will correspond to the amount of vowels, reflecting a moraic structure also common in Japanese.  Often in the Paumarí language, when an identical vowel occurs word-final and then word-initial in two sequential words, one of the two vowels will be dropped within the phrase.

==Syntax==

Paumarí tends to be a [[head-final]] language.  Typically, in intransitive phrases (those without direct objects) the order is VS.  The SV intransitive order also occurs, although only when the Subject is marked for informational prominence (the demonstrative (DEM) is occluded in such SV phrases).  In transitive phrases, the word order is mainly SVO, in which the ergative case marking system tends to be used.  The affix used for ergative marking is the suffix “-a”, and the object of the sentence is preceded by a word denoting a demonstrative case.  These demonstrative case nouns are either “ada” for male, or “ida” for female.  The gender and number of the object noun, not the subject, dictates the gender and number suffixes on the verb .

Two other word orders that occur in Paumarí transitive phrases are OVS and SOV.  In these cases, the object is marked with a suffix denoting it as such (-ra) and is placed directly before the verb.  In these cases, it is thought that the accusative system has taken over, as the subject of the sentence no longer receives the ergative suffix ‘-a’ and is free to occur at the beginning or end of the phrase (but not directly before the verb).  This shows the split ergativity evident in Paumarí language – they employ the ergative system for some word orders and the accusative system for others.  In the accusative phrases, the subject governs the gender, class, and number suffixes of the verb – in direct contrast to the ergative phrases.
 
Adjectives always follow the noun that they describe and if there is also a number in the clause, it follows the adjective (“Three big dogs” becomes “dogs big three”).  The Paumarí language has very few words that act as adverbs, but several ways of changing other words into adverbs via affixes.  Adverbs do not modify adjectives in the Paumarí language.

==Morphology==
Paumarí is primarily an agglutinative language, and primarily suffixing, although many prefixes are also used.  Prefixes on verbs are usually reserved for obligatory pronoun incorporation, whereas verb suffixes denote many different things.  There exist affixes, mainly suffixes, to denote gender, number, and noun classes in verbs.  The appropriate affixes are added to the verb to agree with the sentence’s noun (either the Subject or Object depending on whether the ergative or accusative system are being used) in each case.

==Portuguese contact==
There are some portions of the Paumarí language that have been irreversibly changed by Portuguese influence.  For example, Paumarí use Portuguese narrative words such as ''dai'' ("from there") and ''então'' ("then") often in their speech. Also, Paumarí have difficulty expressing equality/inequality within their own language.  At the time of the 1964 SIL arrival, they used the Portuguese word ''mais'' ("more") in conjunction with adjectives to compare things and the researchers could not find anything in native Paumarí tongue that served the same function in their language.  Often, root duplication serves as a way for the Paumarí to express that something is less like or becoming or trending towards another thing.  This is an odd use of reduplication, as in many other languages, reduplication serves to strengthen the word; make it more immediate or intense.  For adjectives, often the suffix –''ki'' will be added to tag the word as descriptive. Reduplication of adjective roots denotes less of the description.

==Stress accent system==
Dan Everett of the University of North Dakota has extensively studied the accent/stress system of the Paumarí and has claimed that the Paumarí’s accent system violates some of the most basic theories put forward by linguists with regards to stress systems.  Paumarí has iambic feet, which means the accent tends towards the right, or latter, portion of the word or syllable set, and they are not weight-sensitive.  Everett theorizes that stress placement and syllables in the Paumarí language are more exclusive from one another than many modern theories believe.  Two types of accents are distinguished in Paumarí, primary stress and secondary stress.  Primary stress is characterized by a sharp increase in intensity (volume) and by somewhat higher pitch, although the latter is difficult for non-speakers to distinguish and was found by digital analysis of sound wave of native speakers.  Secondary stress in Paumarí is characterized by a slight increase in intensity and often an increase in syllable duration.   The final syllable of a word always has one of the two of these and therefore is always somewhat stressed.  The stress system starts at the final syllable and works its way to the left, or the beginning of the word, skipping every other syllable.  In disyllabic words, the primary stress is placed on the final syllable.  In polysyllabic words, the primary stress is assigned to the antepenult (third from last) syllable, and the last syllable is assigned secondary stress.  If the polysyllabic word is five syllables or more, every odd syllable (leftward) from the antepenult syllable is also assigned secondary stress.  Therefore, regardless of how many syllables a word has, the primary stress is always on the last or antepenult syllable.  The beginning syllable for a word will only have primary stress if it is a three-syllable word, and will have secondary stress only if it contains an odd-number (5, 7, 9, etc.) of syllables.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4458">'''Perkerdansk''' or '''Immigrant Danish''' is a multi-ethnolect&lt;ref name="dialekt"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire, Nortier, Adger 2015&lt;/ref&gt; spoken in [[Denmark]], a variety of [[Danish language|Danish]] associated primarily with youths of Middle Eastern ethnic background. It is a contact variety that includes features of Danish as well as Arabic, Turkish, English and other immigrant languages. Particularly common in urban areas with high densities of immigrant populations, its features have also spread to general youth language in Denmark.

The following is an example of Danish spoken by two youths in Copenhagen. Speaker A speaks Berber as a first language and speaker B's first language is Kurdish. Nonetheless their Danish includes elements of Arabic (''[[w:wallah|wallah]]'' "I swear") and Turkish (''kız'' "girl", ''para'' "money", and English (''I got'' "I have", -s plural ending on the Turkish word ''para'').

:A: ''wallah'' jeg siger min storebror han skylder mig 700 kroner jeg skal have 350 i dag og 350 om to uger. ''I got paras''. Skal du til den der fest på fredag.
::"Wallah I say my older brother he owes me 700 crowns I am getting 350 today and 350 in two weeks. I got paras. Are you going to that party on Friday?"
:B:  mm..
:A: ''wallah'' mand jeg siger dig efter den der tur jeg tænker bare på fest og ''kız''.
:"Wallah man I tell you after that trip I think only about party and kız"&lt;ref name="dialekt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dialekt.ku.dk/sociolekter/etnolekt/multietnolekt/|publisher=University of Copenhagen|title=Multietnolekt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other non-standard features are grammatical (simplification of [[grammatical gender]] system) and syntactical, such as lack of word order inversion in subordinate clauses ("når man er i puberteten, man tænker mere" and after initial sentence adverb ("normalt man går på ungdomsskolen"); Standard Danish is a [[V2_word_order#Continental_Scandinavian_languages:_Swedish.2C_Danish.2C_Norwegian.2C_Faroese|V2 language]], with an exception for subordinate clauses. Phonetic features include loss of [[stød]] in some words, and an isochronic shift from [[stress-timed]]ness to [[syllable-timed]]ness.&lt;ref&gt;Quist, Pia (2000).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22775">This list brings together '''authority figures'''&amp;nbsp;– people who hold [[Kayfabe|on-screen]] [[Political power|power]]&amp;nbsp;– in [[professional wrestling promotion]]s or [[WWE brand extension|brand]]s within North America. The North American [[Professional wrestling|wrestling industry]] portrays authority [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|figures]] as responsible for making matches, providing rules and generally keeping law and order both in and outside the [[Wrestling ring|ring]]. The role can vary according to disposition, as a [[Face (professional wrestling)|face]] authority figure tends to give what the fans want and does what is fair, while a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heel]] authority figures tend to run their shows out of their own self-interest.

== WWE authority figures ==
{{See also|WWE}}
From its founding in 1963 to 1997, the WWE looked to a President as an authority figure: the President had booking power and controlled all wrestlers. However, in 1997, the Commissioner replaced the President, with [[Sgt. Slaughter]] serving as the first WWE Commissioner. During the [[Attitude Era]] (1997–2002), not only the Commissioner, but also [[Vince McMahon]] (through his position as WWE Chairman under his evil character "[[Mr. McMahon]]") had booking power. McMahon usually used his power in order to haze his [[kayfabe]] nemesis, [[Stone Cold Steve Austin]]. When [[Shawn Michaels]] served as Commissioner, he could overrule McMahon, but he exercised his booking power only sporadically, and was working with an "Iron-Clad" contract where he could not be fired. When [[Mick Foley]] acquired the position, he took full reign until he was fired from the position.

Upon splitting the [[WWE]] into two separate brands in the [[WWE brand extension]] of 2002, on-screen co-owners Vince McMahon and [[Ric Flair]] proceeded to [[WWE Draft|draft]] WWE wrestlers into two separate rosters. Flair took ownership of ''[[WWE Raw|Raw]]'', while McMahon controlled ''[[WWE SmackDown|SmackDown!]]''. After McMahon regained control of the entire company, he removed Flair from control of ''Raw'', relinquished his own position and appointed separate General Managers to control the different brands.

On July 18, 2011, [[Triple H]] came to ''Raw'' and told Vince McMahon that the Board of Directors (kayfabe) revoked his "day-to-day operation power" and named him to manage it instead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/2011-07-18/mcmahon-relieved-of-duties "Game" changer for McMahon&lt;/ref&gt; After that, Triple H became the WWE's Chief Operating Officer who had the booking power in WWE on both ''Raw'' and ''SmackDown'' brands until the Board stripped him of his power, and named [[John Laurinaitis]] the Interim General Manager of ''Raw''.

=== Presidents and Commissioners ===
* Willie Gilzenberg, WWF President (1963&amp;nbsp;– November 15, 1978)

**[[Debra Marshall|Debra]], Lt. Commissioner (October 30, 2000&amp;nbsp;– March 5, 2001)
* [[William Regal]], WWF Commissioner (March 8, 2001&amp;nbsp;– October 11, 2001)

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; While Mick Foley was Commissioner in 2000, he was the ultimate on-screen authority, overriding everyone else.

=== Corporate officers ===
From 1996 onwards, the corporate roles of Vince McMahon and his wife Linda were gradually acknowledged in WWF programmes and were subsequently included in storylines. The following list gives the development of corporate offices as portrayed in storylines and should not be confused with their counterparts in the actual structure in WWE, Inc. and its predecessors.

* [[Vince McMahon]], '''Titan Sports/WWF/WWE, Inc. Chairman of the Board (since 1980, first acknowledged in 1996)'''
* [[Linda McMahon]], WWF, Inc. Chief Executive Officer (1994&amp;nbsp;– June 7, 1999)&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;

***[[Paige (wrestler)|Paige]], General Manager of SmackDown Live (April 10, 2018&amp;nbsp;– present)


&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; In real life, Linda McMahon served on the board of directors for the WWF's parent company from 1980; Vince McMahon appointed her to the position of CEO in 1994 during the WWF steroid scandal.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[Kayfabe]]-appointed CEO by Linda McMahon; subsequently lost his position back to Mr. McMahon in a [[ladder match]] at [[King of the Ring (1999)|King of the Ring]].

&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; Linda McMahon gained control after her husband Vince McMahon was barred from appearing on WWF television after [[Fully Loaded (1999)|Fully Loaded]].

&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; Triple H relieved Vince McMahon from his operative duties and became Chief Operating Officer (COO). Vince McMahon however remained Chairman and occasionally appeared as such on WWE programmes.

&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; Theodore Long announced that Triple H had given him the power to book Raw when necessary. This arrangement ended when [[John Laurinaitis]] became Interim General Manager of Raw.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrestlingnewsworld.com/wwe-news/wwe-raw-results-9-5-2011.php Theodore Long came out to announce the 8 man tag team match on that night, and also his booking power.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== NWA Championship Committee ===
TNA Wrestling also maintained a championship committee&amp;nbsp;– established in 2004 to help the Director of Authority to book matches and to keep contenders in proper order. The Committee members also served as guest judges for ''TNA Impact!'' when broadcast by Fox Sports Net, as all matches had a time limit and if the match went to time, a judge had to make the call as to who had won (somewhat as in boxing). By June 2005 the committee was dropped and only Larry Zbyszko made appearances for the company. Despite the name, the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] had no direct relationship with the committee; during its existence TNA controlled the booking of the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] and treated it as its foremost title.

The committee consisted of:
* [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]] (founder, original member, November 2004&amp;nbsp;– June 2005)

* [[Billy Corgan]] (August 12, 2016&amp;nbsp;– December 2016)
&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; Dixie Carter has been legitimately TNA President since 2003 after [[Panda Energy International]] became majority shareholder of TNA. However, Jerry Jarrett continued to appear till 2003 as President and Jeff Jarrett was recognised on screen from 2004 till 2009 when Dixie began to have the on-screen role.

&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; Hulk Hogan was (storyline) President from October 2010 to October 2011 after Carter unkowingly signed her power away to him in a contract.  Carter was re-established as on-screen President following Sting defeating Hogan at [[Bound for Glory (2011)|Bound For Glory]].

[[Ted Turner]] purchased [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] and launched World Championship Wrestling in 1988.  The company went through a series of Vice Presidents and [[Professional wrestling booker#Book|bookers]], ranging from those with little wrestling experience to those entrenched in the old territorial methods of promotion, until [[Eric Bischoff]] took control in 1994. His tenure saw the creation of ''[[WCW Monday Nitro|Nitro]]'', the start of the [[Monday Night Wars]], and the formation of the [[New World Order (professional wrestling)|New World Order]].  Declining ratings saw Bischoff ousted in 1999, and former WWF writer [[Vince Russo]] was hired in an attempt to salvage the company.  WCW was purchased by the WWF in March 2001, however the company was featured prominently on WWF television as part of [[The Invasion (professional wrestling)|the Invasion]] storyline for the remainder of the year.

'''Rusenu''' is a virtually extinct [[Papuan languages|Papuan language]] discovered in 2007. It was spoken in the east of what is now [[East Timor]].

Rusenu was discovered accidentally by the Dutch-Timorese linguist [[Aone van Engelenhoven]], who was studying a language called [[Makuva]], thought since the 1950s to be extinct,&lt;ref name="raadsel"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; He gave his tape recorder to his informant, who subsequently interrogated the women and her son. She remembered a nursery rhyme, which she was unable to interpret (as was her entire tribe). Her son could count to ten in the language. After Van Engelenhoven analysed and transcribed the recording, he concluded that Rusenu, "albeit remotely related to [[Fataluku language|Fataluku]], is a separate language."&lt;ref name="hoop"/&gt; The speakers of Rusenu were also claimed to have been responsible for the several thousand years old [[rock drawing]]s on East Timor,&lt;ref name="raadsel"/&gt; in the [[Ile Kére Kére caves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Russification''' ({{lang-ru|Русификация}}, ''Rusifikatskiya'') or '''Russianization''' is a form of [[cultural assimilation]] process during which non-[[Russians|Russian]] communities, voluntarily or not, give up their culture and language in favor of the Russian one.

In a historical sense, the term refers to both official and unofficial policies of [[Imperial Russia]] and the [[Soviet Union]] with respect to their national constituents and to [[national minorities]] in [[Russia]], aimed at Russian domination.

The major areas of Russification are politics and culture. In politics, an element of Russification is assigning Russian nationals to leading administrative positions in national institutions. In culture, Russification primarily amounts to domination of the Russian language in official business and strong influence of the Russian language on national idioms. The shifts in [[demographics]] in favour of the ethnic Russian population are sometimes considered as a form of Russification as well.

Analytically, it is helpful to distinguish ''Russification'', as a process of changing one's ethnic self-label or identity from a non-Russian [[ethnonym]] to Russian, from ''Russianization'', the spread of the Russian language, culture, and people into non-Russian cultures and regions, distinct also from [[Sovietization]] or the imposition of institutional forms established by the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] throughout the territory ruled by that party.&lt;ref&gt;Vernon V. Aspaturian, "The Non-Russian Peoples," in Allen Kassof, Ed., ''Prospects for Soviet Society'' (New York: Praeger, 1968): 143–198. Aspaturian also distinguished both Russianization and Russification from Sovietization, the process of spreading Soviet institutions and the Soviet socialist restructuring of social and economic relations in accordance with the ruling Communist Party's vision. (Aspaturian was a Soviet studies specialist, Evan Pugh Professor Emeritus of political science and former director of the Slavic and Soviet Language and Area Center at [[Pennsylvania State University]].)&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, although Russification is usually [[conflation|conflated]] across Russification, Russianization, and Russian-led Sovietization, each can be considered a distinct process. Russianization and Sovietization, for example, did not automatically lead to Russification – change in language or self-identity of non-Russian peoples to being Russian. Thus, despite long exposure to the Russian language and culture, as well as to Sovietization, at the end of the [[Soviet era]] non-Russians were on the verge of becoming a majority of the population in the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver,"Demographic Sources of the Changing Ethnic Composition of the Soviet Union," ''Population and Development Review'' 15, No. 4 (Dec., 1989), pp. 609–656.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:索菲亚大教堂.JPG|thumb|167px|right|The Russian Orthodox [[Saint Sophia Cathedral, Harbin|St. Sophia Cathedral]] in [[Harbin]], [[China]].]]
An early case of Russification took place in the 16th century in the conquered [[Khanate of Kazan]] (medieval Tatar state which occupied the territory of former [[Volga Bulgaria]]) and other Tatar areas. The main elements of this process were [[Christianization]] and implementation of the Russian language as the sole [[administrative language]].{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

After the Russian defeat in the [[Crimean War]] in 1856 and the Polish rebellion of 1863, Tsar Alexander II increased Russification to reduce the threat of future rebellions.  Russia was populated by many minority groups, and forcing them to accept the Russian culture was an attempt to prevent self-determinationist tendencies and separatism. In the 19th century, Russian settlers on traditional Kirghiz land drove many of the [[Kyrgyz people|Kirghiz]] over the border to China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHsTAAAAYAAJ&amp;q=chinese#v=onepage&amp;q=chinese%20kirghiz%20driven%20over%20russian%20settlers&amp;f=false|title=Unknown Mongolia: a record of travel and exploration in north-west Mongolia and Dzungaria, Volume 2|author=Alexander Douglas Mitchell Carruthers, Jack Humphrey Miller|editor=|year=1914|publisher=Lippincott|edition=|location=PHILADELPHIA|page=345|isbn=|accessdate=29 May 2011}}(Original from Harvard University)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uralic peoples==
{{expand section|date=August 2014}}
Indigenous to large parts of western and central Russia are the [[Uralic peoples]], such as the [[Vepsians]], [[Mordvins]], [[Mari people|Maris]] and [[Permians]]. Historically, the Russification of Uralic peoples begins already with the original eastward expansion of the [[East Slavic peoples|East Slavs]]. Written records of the oldest period are scarce, but [[toponym]]ic evidence indicates&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Janne|last=Saarikivi|title=Substrata Uralica: Studies on Finno-Ugrian substrate in Northern Russian dialects|type=PhD thesis|year=2006|isbn=978-9949-11-474-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Eugene|last=Helimski|title=The "Northwestern" Group of Finno-Ugric Languages and its Heritage in the Place Names and Substratum Vocabulary of the Russian North|year=2006|journal=Slavica Helsingiensia|volume=27|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/venaja/nwrussia/eng/Conference/pdf/Helimski.pdf|accessdate=2014-08-10}}

The Russification of the [[Komi people|Komi]] began in the 13th to 14th centuries, but did not penetrate into the Komi heartlands until the 18th century. Komi-Russian [[bilingualism]] has become the norm over the 19th and has led to increasing Russian influence in the [[Komi language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Marja|last=Leinonen|title=The Russification of Komi|year=2006|journal=Slavica Helsingiensia|volume=27|url=http://www.helsinki.fi/venaja/nwrussia/eng/Conference/pdf/Leinonen.pdf|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The enforced Russification of Russia's remaining indigenous minorities has intensified particularly during the Soviet era and continues unabated in the 21st century, especially in connection to [[urbanization]] and the dropping population [[Russian Cross|replacement rate]]s (particularly low among the more western Uralic peoples). As a result, several of Russia's indigenous languages and cultures are currently considered [[Endangered language|endangered]]. E.g. between the 1989 and 2002 censuses, the assimilation numbers of the Mordvins have totalled over 100,000, a major loss for a people totalling less than one million in number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Seppo|last=Lallukka|chapter=Venäjän valtakunnallinen ja suomalais-ugrilainen väestökriisi|year=2008|language=Finnish|editor1-first=Sirkka|editor1-last=Saarinen|editor2-first=Eeva|editor2-last=Herrala|title=Murros: Suomalais-ugrilaiset kielet ja kulttuurit globalisaation paineessa|series=Uralica Helsingiensia|issue=4|isbn=978-952-5667-05-9|url=http://www.sgr.fi/uh/uh3.html|accessdate=2014-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Vasily Pekteyev, director of the Mari National Theater in [[Yoshkar-Ola]], [[Mari El]], a policy of Russification in the republic that began in 2001 has resulted in the [[Mari language]] no longer being taught in schools and villages.

In 19th century the Russian Empire strove to replace{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} the [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Polish language|Polish]], [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]], and [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] languages and dialects by Russian in those areas, which were annexed by the [[Russian Empire]] after the [[Partitions of Poland]] (1772–1795) and the [[Congress of Vienna]] (1815). Imperial Russia faced a crucial critical cultural situation by 1815:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Large sections of Russian society had come under foreign influence as a result of the Napoleonic wars and appeared open to change. As a consequence of absorbing so much Polish territory, by 1815 no less than 64 per cent of the nobility of the Romanov realm was of Polish descent, and since there more literate Poles than Russians, more people within it could read and write Polish than Russian. The third largest city, Wilno, was entirely Polish in character and its university was the best in the Empire.&lt;ref&gt;

Russification in [[Congress Poland]] intensified after the [[November Uprising]] of 1831, and in particular after the [[January Uprising]] of 1863.&lt;ref name="Kevin O'Connor"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Connor|first1=Kevin|authorlink1=Kevin O'Connor (historian)|title=The History of the Baltic States|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=0-313-32355-0|page=58|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=b3b5nU4bnw4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1864 the Polish and Belarusian languages were banned in public places; in the 1880s Polish was banned in schools, on school grounds and in the offices of Congress Poland. Research and teaching of the Polish language, of Polish history or of Catholicism were forbidden. [[Illiteracy]] rose as Poles refused to learn Russian. Students were beaten for resisting Russification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Porter |first = Brian |year = 2001 |title = When Nationalism Began to Hate: Imagining Modern Politics in Nineteenth-Century Poland |url = http://history.lsa.umich.edu/BPS/When%20Nationalism%20Began%20to%20Hate.pdf |location = Oxford |publisher = Oxford University Press |isbn = 978-0-19-515187-9 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100621015030/http://history.lsa.umich.edu/BPS/When%20Nationalism%20Began%20to%20Hate.pdf |archivedate = 21 June 2010 |df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Polish underground education network formed, including the famous [[Flying University]].

Starting in the 1840's Russia considered introducing [[Cyrillic script]] for spelling the Polish language, with the first school books printed in the 1860s; these attempts failed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Cyrylica nad Wisłą|url= http://www.rp.pl/artykul/806286-Cyrylica-nad-Wisla.html|website= Rzeczpospolita|language= Polish|date= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar development took place in [[Lithuania]].&lt;ref name="Kevin O'Connor"/&gt; Its [[Governor General of Lithuania|Governor General]], [[Mikhail Nikolayevich Muravyov-Vilensky|Mikhail Muravyov]] (in office 1863-1865), prohibited the public use of spoken Polish and [[Lithuanian language|Lithuanian]] and closed Polish and Lithuanian schools; teachers from other parts of Russia who did not speak these languages were moved in to teach pupils. Muravyov also [[Lithuanian press ban|banned the use]] of [[Latin script|Latin]] and [[Blackletter|Gothic]] scripts in publishing. He was reported as saying, "What the Russian bayonet didn't accomplish, the Russian school will." ("Что не додѣлалъ русскій штыкъ – додѣлаетъ русская школа.") This ban, lifted only in 1904, was disregarded by the ''[[Knygnešiai]]'', the Lithuanian book smugglers, who brought Lithuanian publications printed in the Latin alphabet, the historic orthography of the Lithuanian language, from [[Lithuania Minor]] (part of East Prussia) and from the United States into the Lithuanian-speaking areas of Imperial Russia. The knygnešiai came to symbolise the resistance of Lithuanians against Russification.

The Russification campaign also promoted the [[Russian Orthodox]] faith over Catholicism. The measures used included closing down Catholic monasteries, officially banning the building of new churches and giving many of the old ones to the Russian Orthodox church, banning Catholic schools and establishing state schools which taught only the Orthodox religion, requiring Catholic priests to preach only officially approved sermons, requiring that Catholics who married members of the Orthodox church convert, requiring Catholic nobles to pay an additional tax in the amount of 10% of their profits, limiting the amount of land a Catholic peasant could own, and switching from the [[Gregorian calendar]] (used by Catholics) to the [[Julian calendar|Julian]] one (used by members of the Orthodox church).

Most of the Orthodox Church property in the 19th century Congress Poland was acquired at the expense of the Catholic Church of both rites (Roman and Greek Catholic).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szabaciuk|first1=Andrzej|title="Rosyjski Ulster".

After the uprising,{{which|date=March 2018}} many manors and great chunks of land were confiscated from nobles of Polish and Lithuanian descent who were accused of helping the uprising; these properties were later given or sold to Russian nobles. Villages where supporters of the uprising lived were repopulated by ethnic Russians. [[Vilnius University]], where the language of instruction had been Polish rather than Russian, closed in 1832. Lithuanians and Poles were banned from holding any public jobs (including professional positions, such as teachers and doctors) in Lithuania; this forced educated Lithuanians to move to other parts of the Russian Empire. The [[Statutes of Lithuania|old legal code]] was dismantled and a new one based on the Russian code and written in the Russian language was enacted; Russian became the only administrative and juridical language in the area. Most of these actions ended at the beginning of the [[Russo-Japanese War]] of 1904-1905, but others took longer to be reversed; [[Vilnius University]] re-opened only after Russia had lost control of the city in 1919.

==Ukraine==
{{main|Russification of Ukraine}}
[[File:Валуєвський циркуляр. Valuev Circular.jpg|thumb|The Valuyev Circular of 1860, designed to eradicate the usage of [[Ukrainian language]].]]
Russian and Soviet authorities conducted policies of Russification of Ukraine from 1709 to 1991, interrupted by the [[Korenizatsiya]] policy in the 1920s. Since then, the Ukrainian government has implemented policies in order to decrease the use of Russian and favour Ukrainian, a process labelled [[Ukrainization]].

A number of Ukrainian activists committed suicide in protest against Russification, among whom are [[Oleksa Hirnyk]] and [[Vasyl Makukh]].

==Grand Duchy of Finland==
{{Main|Russification of Finland}}
The Russification of Finland (1899–1905, 1908–1917), ''sortokaudet'' (times of oppression in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]) was a governmental policy of the [[Russian Empire]] aimed at the termination of Finland's [[Grand Duchy of Finland|autonomy]].

==Bessarabia/Moldova==
{{Main|Bessarabia Governorate}}
[[Bessarabia]] was annexed by the Russian Empire in 1812. In 1816 Bessarabia became an autonomous state, but only until 1828. In 1829, the use of the [[Romanian language]] was forbidden in the administration. In 1833, the use of the Romanian language was forbidden in churches. In 1842, teaching in Romanian was forbidden in secondary schools; it was forbidden in elementary schools in 1860.

The Russian authorities forced the migration of [[Moldovans]] to other provinces of the Russian Empire (especially in [[Kuban]], [[Kazakhstan]] and [[Siberia]]), while foreign ethnic groups (especially Russians and Ukrainians, called in the 19th century "Little Russians") were encouraged to settle there.  According to the 1817 census, Bessarabia was populated by 86% Moldovans, 6.5% Ukrainians, 1.5% Russians ([[Lipovans]]) and 6% other ethnic groups. 80 years later, in 1897, the ethnic structure was very different: only 56% Moldovans, but 11.7% Ukrainians, 18.9% Russians and 13.4% other ethnic groups.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Nistor / Istoria Basarabiei. Editie si studiu bio-bibliografic de Stelian Neagoe / Bucuresti, Editura HUMANITAS, 1991,&lt;/ref&gt; During 80 years, between 1817 and 1897, the share of Moldovan population dropped by 30%.

After the [[Soviet occupation of Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina|Soviet occupation of Bessarabia in 1940]], the Romanian population of Bessarabia was persecuted by Soviet authorities, especially in the years following the annexation, based mostly on social, educational, and political grounds; because of this, Russification laws were imposed again on the Romanian population. The [[Moldovan language]] introduced during the [[Interwar period]] by the Soviet authorities first in the [[Moldavian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic]], and after 1940 taught in the [[Moldavian Soviet Socialist Republic]], was actually the [[Romanian language]] but written with a version of the Cyrillic script derived from the [[Russian alphabet]]. Proponents of Cyrillic orthography argue that the Romanian language was historically written with the Cyrillic script, albeit a different version of it (see [[Moldovan Cyrillic alphabet|Moldovan alphabet]] and [[Romanian Cyrillic alphabet]] for a discussion of this controversy).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ijors.net/issue2_2_2013/articles/iliev.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The cultural and linguistic effects of Russification manifest themselves in persistent identity questions. During the breakup of the Soviet Union, this led to separation of a large and industrialized portion of the country, becoming the de facto independent state of [[Transnistria]], whose main official language is [[Russian language|Russian]].

==Under the Soviet Union==
After the [[1917 revolution]], authorities in the [[USSR]] decided to abolish the use of the [[Arabic alphabet]] in native languages in Soviet-controlled Central Asia, in the [[Caucasus]], and in the Volga region (including [[Tatarstan]]). This detached the local Muslim populations from exposure to the language and writing system of the [[Koran]].  The new alphabet for these languages was based on the [[Latin alphabet]] and was also inspired by the [[Turkish alphabet]]. However, by the late 1930s, the policy had changed. In 1939–1940 the Soviets decided that a number of these languages (including [[Tatar language|Tatar]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], [[Azerbaijani language|Azeri]], and [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]]) would henceforth use variations of the [[Cyrillic script]]. It was claimed that the switch was made "by the demands of the working class."

===Early 1920s through mid-1930s: Indigenization===
{{Main|Korenizatsiya}}
Stalin's ''[[Marxism and the National Question]]'' (1913) provided the basic framework for nationality policy in the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name = "Rouland 2004 183"&gt;{{Harvnb|Rouland|2004|p=183}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The early years of said policy, from the early 1920s to the mid-1930s, were guided by the policy of [[korenizatsiya]] ("indigenization"), during which the new Soviet regime sought to reverse the long-term effects of Russification on the non-Russian populations.&lt;ref&gt;For a general timeline of Soviet policy towards the nationalities, see the Russian-language Wikipedia article on "Nationalities policy of Russia" ([[:ru:Национальная политика России]]).&lt;/ref&gt; As the regime was trying to establish its power and [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] throughout the former Russian empire, it went about constructing regional administrative units, recruiting non-Russians into leadership positions, and promoting non-Russian languages in government administration, the courts, the schools, and the mass media.  The slogan then established was that local cultures should be "socialist in content but national in form." That is, these cultures should be transformed to conform with the Communist Party's socialist project for the Soviet society as a whole but have active participation and leadership by the indigenous nationalities and operate primarily in the local languages.

Early nationalities policy shared with later policy the object of assuring control by the Communist Party over all aspects of Soviet political, economic, and social life.  The early Soviet policy of promoting what one scholar has described as "ethnic particularism"&lt;ref&gt;Yuri Slezkine, "The USSR as a Communal Apartment, Or How a Socialist State Promoted Ethnic Particularism," ''[[Slavic Review]]'' 53, No. 2 (Summer 1994): 414–452.&lt;/ref&gt; and another as "institutionalized multinationality",&lt;ref&gt;[[Rogers Brubaker]], "Nationhood and the National Question in the Soviet Union and Post-Soviet Eurasia: An Institutionalist Account," ''Theory and Society'' 23 (February, 1994): 47–78.&lt;/ref&gt; had a double goal.  On the one hand, it had been an effort to counter Russian chauvinism by assuring a place for the non-Russian languages and cultures in the newly formed Soviet Union.  On the other hand, it was a means to prevent the formation of alternative ethnically based [[political movement]]s, including [[pan-Islamism]]&lt;ref&gt;This was not focused simply on religion.  In the Revolutionary and immediate post-Revolutionary period, after at first coöpting [[jadid]]ist Tatar [[Mirsäyet Soltanğäliev|Sultan Galiyev]] into a leadership position in the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), the Soviet regime soon turned to fighting against his project and ideas for uniting Muslim peoples in a broader national liberal movement.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[pan-Turkism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Slezkine (1994) and Ronald Wixman, ''Language Aspects of Ethnic Patterns and Processes in the North Caucasus,'' University of Chicago Geography Research Series, No. 19 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; One way of accomplishing this was to promote what some regard as artificial distinctions between ethnic groups and languages rather than promoting amalgamation of these groups and a common set of languages based on Turkish or another regional language.&lt;ref&gt;Wixman (1980). One scholar has pointed out that the basic task of defining "what was a nationality" was assigned to ethnographers immediately after the formation of the USSR in 1924, and that they were asked to work quickly so that a population census could be taken with an accounting by nationality.  In contrast, the only complete imperial Russian census in 1897 did not use nationality at all as a category but instead used religion and language as ethnic markers. See Francine Hirsch, "The Soviet Union as a Work in Progress: Ethnographers and Category Nationality in the 1926, 1937, and 1939 Censuses," ''[[Slavic Review]]'' 56 (Summer 1997): 256–278.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviet nationalities policy from its early years sought to counter these two tendencies by assuring a modicum of cultural autonomy to non-Russian nationalities within a [[federal system]] or structure of government, though maintaining that the ruling Communist Party was monolithic, not federal. A process of [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|"national-territorial delimitation"]] ([[:ru:национально-территориальное размежевание]]) was undertaken to define the official territories of the non-Russian populations within the Soviet Union. The federal system conferred highest status to the titular nationalities of union republics, and lower status to titular nationalities of autonomous republics, autonomous provinces, and autonomous okrugs. In all, some 50 nationalities had a republic, province, or okrug of which they held nominal control in the federal system. Federalism and the provision of native-language education ultimately left as a legacy a large non-Russian public that was educated in the languages of their ethnic groups and that identified a particular homeland on the territory of the Soviet Union.

===Late 1930s and wartime: Russian comes to the fore===
By the late 1930s, however, there was a notable policy shift.  Purges in some of the national regions, such as [[Ukrainization|Ukraine]], had occurred already in the early 1930s.  Before the turnabout in Ukraine in 1933, a purge of Veli Ibrahimov and his leadership in the [[Crimean Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic|Crimean ASSR]] in 1929 for "national deviation" led to Russianization of government, education, and the media and to the creation of a special alphabet for Crimean Tatar to replace the Latin alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;H. B. Paksoy, "Crimean Tatars," in ''Modern Encyclopedia of Religions in Russia and Soviet Union'' (Academic International Press, 1995), Vol. VI: 135–142.&lt;/ref&gt;  Of the two dangers that [[Joseph Stalin]] had identified in 1923, now [[bourgeois nationalism]] (local nationalism) was said to be a greater threat than Great Russian chauvinism (great power chauvinism).  In 1937, [[Faizullah Khojaev]] and [[Akmal Ikramov]] were removed as leaders of the [[Uzbek SSR]] and in 1938, during the [[Trial of the Twenty One|third great Moscow show trial]], convicted and subsequently put to death for alleged anti-Soviet nationalist activities.

After Stalin, a Russified Georgian, became undisputed leader of the Soviet Union, the Russian language gained greater emphasis. In 1938, Russian became a required subject of study in every Soviet school, including those in which a non-Russian language was the principal medium of instruction for other subjects (e.g., mathematics, science, and social studies).  In 1939, non-Russian languages that had been given Latin-based scripts in the late 1920s were given new scripts based on the [[Cyrillic script]].  One likely rationale for these decisions was the sense of impending war and that Russian was the language of command in the [[Red Army]].

Before and during World War II, [[Joseph Stalin]] [[Population transfer in the Soviet Union|deported]] to Central Asia and [[Siberia]] several entire nationalities for their suspected [[Collaborationism|collaboration]] with the German invaders: [[Volga German]]s, [[Crimean Tatars]], [[Chechens]], [[Ingush people|Ingush]], [[Balkars]], [[Kalmyks]], and others. Shortly after the war, he deported many [[Ukrainians]], [[Balts]] and [[Estonians]] to Siberia as well.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Conquest, ''The Nation Killers: The Soviet Deportation of Nationalities'' (London: MacMillan, 1970) ({{ISBN|0-333-10575-3}}); S. Enders Wimbush and Ronald Wixman, "The Meskhetian Turks: A New Voice in Central Asia," ''Canadian Slavonic Papers'' 27, Nos. 2 and 3 (Summer and Fall, 1975): 320–340; and [[Alexander Nekrich]], ''The Punished Peoples: The Deportation and Fate of Soviet Minorities at the End of the Second World War'' (New York: W. W. Norton, 1978) ({{ISBN|0-393-00068-0}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, the leading role of the Russian people in the Soviet family of nations and nationalities was promoted by Stalin and his successors.  This shift was most clearly underscored by Communist Party General Secretary Stalin's Victory Day toast to the Russian people in May 1945:&lt;ref&gt;This translation is drawn from CyberUSSR.com: http://www.cyberussr.com/rus/s-toast-r.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I would like to raise a toast to the health of our Soviet people and, before all, the Russian people.

I drink, before all, to the health of the Russian people, because in this war they earned general recognition as the leading force of the Soviet Union among all the nationalities of our country.}}

Naming the Russian nation the [[primus inter pares]] was a total turnabout from Stalin's declaration 20 years earlier (heralding the [[korenizatsiya]] policy) that "the first immediate task of our Party is vigorously to combat the survivals of Great-Russian chauvinism." Although the official literature on nationalities and languages in subsequent years continued to speak of there being 130 equal languages in the USSR,&lt;ref&gt;For example, M. I. Isaev, Сто тридцать
равноправных; о языках народов СССР. [One hundred and thirty with equal rights; on languages of the peoples of the USSR]. Moscow: Nauka, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; in practice a hierarchy was endorsed in which some nationalities and languages were given special roles or viewed as having different long-term futures.&lt;ref&gt;In the specialized literature on sociolinguistics that evolved in the 1960s and later, scholars described such a hierarchy of societal functions by distinguishing Russian at the top of the hierarchy as the "language of inter-nationality communication," then the "national literary languages" of major Soviet nations (Ukrainian, Estonian, Uzbek, etc.), the "literary languages" of smaller nationalities and peoples (Chuvash, Mordvinian, etc.), and the languages of small ethnic groups. (See, ''inter alia'', Yu. D. Desheriyev and I. F. Protchenko, Равитие языков народов СССР в советскую эпоху [Development of languages of the peoples of the USSR in the Soviet epoch]. Moscow: Prosveshchenie, 1968.)  For an analysis by an American scholar of the different "functions" of major nationalities in the Soviet system of rule, see John A. Armstrong, "The Ethnic Scene in the Soviet Union: The View of the Dictatorship," in Erich Goldhagen, Ed., ''Ethnic Minorities in the Soviet Union'' (New York: Praeger, 1968): 3–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late 1950s to 1980s===

====1958–59 education reform: parents choose language of instruction====
An analysis of textbook publishing found that education was offered for at least one year and for at least the first class (grade) in 67 languages between 1934 and 1980.&lt;ref&gt;On the differential and changing roles of Russian and the non-Russian languages in Soviet education over time see Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Equality, Efficiency, and Politics in Soviet Bilingual Education Policy: 1934–1980," ''American Political Science Review'' 78 (December, 1984): 1019–1039.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the educational reforms undertaken after [[Nikita Khrushchev]] became First Secretary of the Communist Party in the late 1950s began a process of replacing non-Russian schools with Russian ones for the nationalities that had lower status in the federal system or whose populations were smaller or displayed widespread bilingualism already.&lt;ref&gt;Yaroslav Bilinsky, "The Soviet Education Laws of 1958–59 and Soviet Nationality Policy," ''[[Soviet Studies]]'' 14 (Oct. 1962): 138–157.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nominally, this process was guided by the principle of "voluntary parental choice." But other factors also came into play, including the size and formal political status of the group in the Soviet federal hierarchy and the prevailing level of bilingualism among parents.&lt;ref&gt;Brian D. Silver, "The Status of National Minority Languages in Soviet Education: An Assessment of Recent Changes," ''[[Soviet Studies]]'' 26 (Jan. 1974): 28–40; Isabelle Kreindler,"The Changing Status of Russian in the Soviet Union," ''International Journal of the Sociology of Language'' 33 (1982): 7–39; Anderson and Silver (1984).&lt;/ref&gt; By the early 1970s schools in which non-Russian languages served as the principal medium of instruction operated in 45 languages, while seven more indigenous languages were taught as subjects of study for at least one class year.  By 1980, instruction was offered in 35 non-Russian languages of the peoples of the USSR, just over half the number in the early 1930's.

Moreover, in most of these languages schooling was not offered for the complete 10-year curriculum.  For example, within the [[RSFSR]] in 1958–59, full 10-year schooling in the native language was offered in only three languages:  Russian, [[Tatar language|Tatar]], and [[Bashkir language|Bashkir]].&lt;ref name="Silver 1974"&gt;Silver (1974).&lt;/ref&gt;  And some nationalities had minimal or no native-language schooling.  By 1962–1963, among non-Russian nationalities that were indigenous to the RSFSR, whereas 27% of children in classes I-IV (primary school) studied in Russian-language schools, 53% of those in classes V-VIII (incomplete secondary school) studied in Russian-language schools, and 66% of those in classes IX-X studied in Russian-language schools.  Although many non-Russian languages were still offered as a subject of study at a higher class level (in some cases through complete general secondary school – the 10th class), the pattern of using the Russian language as the main medium of instruction accelerated after Khrushchev's parental choice program got under way.

Pressure to convert the main medium of instruction to Russian was evidently higher in urban areas.  For example, in 1961–62, reportedly only 6% of [[Volga Tatars|Tatar]] children living in urban areas attended schools in which [[Tatar language|Tatar]] was the main medium of instruction.&lt;ref name="Silver 1974"/&gt;  Similarly in [[Dagestan]] in 1965, schools in which the indigenous language was the medium of instruction existed only in rural areas.  The pattern was probably similar, if less extreme, in most of the non-Russian [[Republics of the Soviet Union|union republics]], although in Belarus and Ukraine schooling in urban areas was highly Russianized.&lt;ref&gt;Bilinsky (1962).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Doctrine catches up with practice: rapprochement and fusion of nations====
{{refimprove section|date=November 2012}}
The promotion of federalism and of non-Russian languages had always been a strategic decision aimed at expanding and maintaining rule by the Communist Party.  On the theoretical plane, however, the Communist Party's official doctrine was that eventually nationality differences and nationalities as such would disappear.  In official party doctrine as it was reformulated in the Third Program of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] introduced by [[Nikita Khrushchev]] at the 22nd [[Congress of the CPSU|Party Congress]] in 1961, although the program stated that ethnic distinctions would eventually disappear and a single common language would be adopted by all nationalities in the Soviet Union, "the obliteration of national distinctions, and especially language distinctions, is a considerably more drawn-out process than the obliteration of class distinctions."  At that time, however, Soviet nations and nationalities were undergoing a dual process of further flowering of their cultures and of rapprochement or drawing together (сближение – sblizhenie) into a stronger union. In his Report on the Program to the Congress, Khrushchev used even stronger language: that the process of further rapprochement (sblizhenie) and greater unity of nations would eventually lead to a merging or fusion (слияние – sliyanie) of nationalities.&lt;ref&gt;Scholars often misattribute the endorsement of "sliyanie" to the Party Program.{{citation needed|date=November 2012}} This word does not appear in the Party Program but only in Khrushchev's Report on the Program (his second speech at the Congress), though it did appear in officially approved literature about nationalities policy in subsequent years.&lt;/ref&gt;

Khrushchev's formula of rapprochement-fusing was moderated slightly, however, when [[Leonid Brezhnev]] replaced Khrushchev as General Secretary of the Communist Party in 1964 (a post he held until his death in 1982). Brezhnev asserted that rapproachment would lead ultimately to the complete "unity" of nationalities. "Unity" was an ambiguous term because it could imply either the maintenance of separate national identities but a higher stage of mutual attraction or similarity between nationalities, or the total disappearance of ethnic differences.  In the political context of the time,  "rapproahment-unity" was regarded as a softening of the pressure towards Russification that Khrushchev had promoted with his endorsement of sliyanie.

The 24th Party Congress in 1971, however, launched the idea that a new "[[Soviet people]]" was forming on the territory of the USSR, a community for which the common language – the language of the "Soviet people" – was the Russian language, consistent with the role that Russian was playing for the fraternal nations and nationalities in the territory already.  This new community was labeled a people (народ – ''narod''), not a nation (нация – ''natsiya''), but in that context the Russian word ''narod'' ("people") implied an [[ethnic group|''ethnic'' community]], not just a civic or political community.

Thus, until the end of the Soviet era, a doctrinal rationalization had been provided for some of the practical policy steps that were taken in areas of education and the media. First of all, the transfer of many "national schools" (schools based on local languages) to Russian as a medium of instruction accelerated under Khrushchev in the late 1950s and continued into the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;See Anderson and Silver (1984). During this period, in most of the non-Russian official regions, the Ministry of Education distributed three main alternative school curricula, for: (1) Russian schools in which all subjects were taught in Russian, except for foreign (non-Soviet) languages; (2) "national schools" in which the native language was used as the main medium of instruction and Russian was taught as a subject of study (which might be termed the traditional national school); and (3) "national schools" in which Russian was the main medium of instruction and the native language was taught only as a separate subject (a new type of "national school" established after the 1958–59 education reforms).  There were also some hybrid versions of the latter two types.&lt;/ref&gt;

Second, the new doctrine was used to justify the special place of the Russian language as the "language of inter-nationality communication" (язык межнационального общения) in the USSR. Use of the term "inter-nationality" (межнациональное) rather than the more conventional "international" (международное) focused on the special ''internal'' role of Russian language rather than on its role as a language of international discourse.  That Russian was the most widely spoken language, and that Russians were the majority of the population of the country, were also cited in justification of the special place of Russian language in government, education, and the media.

At the 27th CPSU Party Congress in 1986, presided over by [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], the 4th Party Program reiterated the formulas of the previous program:

{{quote|Characteristic of the national relations in our country are both the continued flourishing of the nations and nationalities and the fact that they are steadily and voluntarily drawing closer together on the basis of equality and fraternal cooperation. Neither artificial prodding nor holding back of the objective trends of development is admissible here. In the long term historical perspective this development will lead to complete unity of the nations....

The equal right of all citizens of the USSR to use their native languages and the free development of these languages will be ensured in the future as well. At the same time learning the Russian language, which has been voluntarily accepted by the Soviet people as a medium of communication between different nationalities, besides the language of one's nationality, broadens one's access to the achievements of science and technology and of Soviet and world culture.}}

===Linguistic and ethnic Russification===

====Some factors favoring Russification====
[[File:Russification evidence.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Minsk, capital of Belarus, 2011: Old street name signs in the Belarusian language are replaced with new ones in the Russian language.]]
Progress in the spread of Russian language as a second language and the gradual displacement of other languages was monitored in Soviet censuses.  The Soviet censuses of 1926, 1937, 1939, and 1959, had included questions on "native language" (родной язык) as well as "nationality."  The 1970, 1979, and 1989 censuses added to these questions one on "other language of the peoples of the USSR" that an individual could "use fluently" (свободно владеть).  It is speculated that the explicit goal of the new question on "second language" was to monitor the spread of Russian as the language of internationality communication.&lt;ref&gt;Brian D. Silver, ""The Ethnic and Language Dimensions in Russian and Soviet Censuses," in Ralph S. Clem, Ed., ''Research Guide to the Russian and Soviet Censuses'' (Ithaca: Cornell Univ. Press, 1986): 70–97.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the official homelands within the Soviet Union was regarded as the only homeland of the titular nationality and its language, while the Russian language was regarded as the language for interethnic communication for the whole Soviet Union. Therefore, for most of the Soviet era, especially after the [[korenizatsiya]] (indigenization) policy ended in the 1930s, schools in which non-Russian Soviet languages would be taught were not generally available outside the respective ethnically based administrative units of these ethnicities. Some exceptions appeared to involve cases of historic rivalries or patterns of assimilation between neighboring non-Russian groups, such as between Tatars and Bashkirs in Russia or among major Central Asian nationalities. For example, even in the 1970s schooling was offered in at least seven languages in [[Uzbekistan]]: Russian, [[Uzbek language|Uzbek]], [[Tajik language|Tajik]], [[Kazakh language|Kazakh]], [[Turkmen language|Turkmen]], [[Kyrgyz language|Kyrgyz]], and [[Karakalpak language|Karakalpak]].

While formally all languages were equal, in almost all Soviet republics the Russian/local [[bilingualism]] was "asymmetric": the [[titular nation]] learned Russian, whereas immigrant Russians generally did not learn the local language.

In addition, many non-Russians who lived outside their respective administrative units tended to become Russified linguistically; that is, they not only learned Russian as a second language but they also adopted it as their home language or mother tongue – although some still retained their sense of ''ethnic'' identity or origins even after shifting their native language to Russian. This includes both the traditional communities (e.g., [[Lithuanians]] in the northwestern [[Belarus]] (''see [[Eastern Vilnius region]]'') or the [[Kaliningrad Oblast]] (''see [[Lithuania Minor]]'')) and the communities that appeared during Soviet times such as [[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]] or [[Belarusians|Belarusian]] workers in [[Kazakhstan]] or [[Latvia]], whose children attended primarily the Russian-language schools and thus the further generations are primarily speaking Russian as their native language; for example, 57% of Estonia's Ukrainians, 70% of Estonia's Belarusians and 37% of Estonia's Latvians claimed Russian as the native language in the last Soviet census of 1989. Russian language as well replaced [[Yiddish]] and other languages as the main language of many Jewish communities inside the Soviet Union.

Another consequence of the mixing of nationalities and the spread of [[bilingualism]] and linguistic Russification was the growth of ethnic [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]] and a process of ''ethnic'' Russification—coming to call oneself Russian by nationality or ethnicity, not just speaking Russian as a second language or using it as a primary language. In the last decades of the Soviet Union, ethnic Russification (or [[ethnic assimilation]]) was moving very rapidly for a few nationalities such as the [[Karelians]] and [[Mordvinians]].&lt;ref&gt;Barbara A. Anderson and Brian D. Silver, "Some Factors in the Linguistic and Ethnic Russification of Soviet Nationalities: Is Everyone Becoming Russian?" in Lubomyr Hajda and Mark Beissinger, Eds., ''The Nationality Factor in Soviet Politics and Society'' (Boulder: Westview, 1990): 95–130.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, whether children born in mixed families where one of the parents was Russian were likely to be raised as Russians depended on the context.  For example, the majority of children in families where one parent was Russian and the other Ukrainian living in North [[Kazakhstan]] chose Russian as their nationality on their internal passport at age 16.  However, children of mixed Russian and Estonian parents living in [[Tallinn]] (the capital city of [[Estonia]]), or mixed Russian and Latvian parents living in [[Riga]] (the capital of [[Latvia]]), or mixed Russian and Lithuanian parents living in [[Vilnius]] (the capital of [[Lithuania]]) most often chose as their own nationality that of the titular nationality of their republic – not Russian.&lt;ref&gt;For a summary of ethno-linguistic research conducted by Soviet scholars see Rasma Karklins. 1986. ''Ethnic Relations in the USSR: The Perspective from Below'' (Boston and London: Allen &amp; Unwin).&lt;/ref&gt;

More generally, patterns of [[Language shift|linguistic]] and [[ethnic assimilation]] (Russification) were complex and cannot be accounted for by any single factor such as educational policy.  Also relevant were the traditional cultures and religions of the groups, their residence in urban or rural areas, their contact with and exposure to Russian language and to ethnic Russians, and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Silver, "Social Mobilization and the Russification of Soviet Nationalities," ''American Political Science Review'' 68 (March, 1974): 45–66; Brian D. Silver, "Language Policy and the Linguistic Russification of Soviet Nationalities," in Jeremy R. Azrael, Ed., ''Soviet Nationality Policies and Practices'' (New York: Praeger, 1978): 250–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern== 
On June 19, 2018, the Russian [[Duma]] adopted a bill that made education in all languages but Russian optional, overruling previous laws by [[Subdivisions of Russia|ethnic autonomies]], and reducing instruction in minority languages to only two hours a week.&lt;ref name=FALangLaw&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/russia-fsu/2018-08-01/putins-plan-russify-caucasus|title=Putin's Plan to Russify the Caucasus|agency=Foreign Affairs|date=1 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://ria.ru/society/20180619/1523019471.html|title=Gosduma prinyala chtenii zakonoproekt ob izuchen'i rodnyix yez'ikov|agency=RIA Novosti|date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DWLangLaw&gt;{{cite news|url= https://www.dw.com/en/russian-minorities-fear-for-languages-amid-new-restrictions/a-41639610|title=Russian minorities fear for languages amid new restrictions|agency=Deutsch Welle|date=5 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill has been connected by some commentators, such as in [[Foreign Affairs|''Foreign Affairs'']] to a policy of Russification.&lt;ref name=FALangLaw/&gt; When the bill was still being considered, advocates for minorities warned that the bill could endanger their languages and traditional cultures.&lt;ref name=DWLangLaw/&gt;&lt;ref name=&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rferl.org/a/russia-language-bill-ethnic-republics-existential-threat/29306974.html|title=A Common Language: Russia's 'Ethnic' Republics See Language Bill As Existential Threat|last=Coalson|first=Robert|last2=Lyubimov|first2=Dmitry|date=2018-06-20|website=Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty|language=en|access-date=2018-08-09|last3=Alpaut|first3=Ramazan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law came after a lawsuit in the summer of 2017, where a Russian mother claimed that her son had been "materially harmed" by learning the [[Tatar language]], while in a speech Putin argued that it was wrong to force someone to learn a langauge that is not their own.&lt;ref name=DWLangLaw/&gt; The later "language crackdown" in which autonomous units were forced to stop mandatory hours of native languages was also seen as a move by Putin to "build identity in Russian society".&lt;ref name=DWLangLaw/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9265">In [[linguistics]], '''syllable weight''' is the concept that syllables pattern together according to the number and/or duration of [[segment (linguistics)|segments]] in the [[syllable rime|rime]]. In [[Prosody (Latin)|classical Indo-European verse]], as developed in [[Ancient Greek literature|Greek]], [[Sanskrit]], and [[Latin literature|Latin]], distinctions of syllable weight were fundamental to the [[metre (poetry)|meter]] of the line.

==Linguistics==
{{See also|Mora (linguistics)}}
A '''heavy syllable''' is a [[syllable]] with a branching [[syllable nucleus|nucleus]] or a branching [[syllable rime|rime]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=A Theory of Phonological Weight| last=Hyman| first=Larry M.| authorlink=Larry Hyman| publisher=CSLI Publications| year=2003| location=Stanford| isbn=1-57586-328-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; although not all such syllables are heavy in every language. A branching nucleus generally means the syllable has a [[long vowel]] or a [[diphthong]]; this type of syllable is abbreviated CVV. A syllable with a branching rime is a ''closed syllable'', that is, one with a [[syllable coda|coda]] (one or more consonants at the end of the syllable); this type of syllable is abbreviated CVC. In some languages, both CVV and CVC syllables are heavy, while a syllable with a short [[vowel]] as the nucleus and no coda (a CV syllable) is a '''light syllable'''. In other languages, only CVV syllables are heavy, while CVC and CV syllables are light. In yet other languages, CVV syllables are heavy and CV syllables are light, while some CVC syllables are heavy (for instance if the coda is a sonorant) and other CVC syllables are light (for instance if the coda is an obstruent). Some languages distinguish a third type, CVVC syllables (with both a branching nucleus and a coda) and/or CVCC syllables (with a coda consisting of two or more consonants) as '''superheavy syllables'''.

In [[mora (linguistics)|moraic theory]], heavy syllables are analyzed as containing two morae, light syllables one, and superheavy syllables three.

The distinction between heavy and light syllables plays an important role in the [[phonology]] of some languages, especially with regard to the assignment of [[stress (linguistics)|stress]]. For instance, in the [[Turkish phonology#Sezer stress|Sezer stress pattern]] in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] observed in place names, the main stress occurs as an [[Iamb (foot)|iamb]] (i.e. penultimate stress) one syllable to the left of the final syllable: (L''''L''')σ. However, when the [[Foot (prosody)|foot]] contains a heavy syllable in the first syllable while the second syllable is light, the iamb shifts to a [[trochee]] (i.e. antepenultimate stress) because there is a requirement that main stress fall on a heavy syllable whenever possible: (''''H'''L)σ, and not *(H''''L''')σ.

==Classical poetry==&lt;!---[[Iambic pentameter]] links to this subsection---&gt;

===Basic definitions===
In [[Ancient Greek literature|Ancient Greek]] [[hexameter poetry]] and [[Latin literature]], lines followed certain [[meter (poetry)|metrical]] patterns, such as  based on arrangements of heavy and light syllables. A heavy syllable was referred to as a '''{{lang|la|longum}}''' and a light as a '''{{lang|la|brevis}}''' (and in the modern day, reflecting the ancient terms, a {{lang|la|longum}} is often called a "long syllable" and a {{lang|la|brevis}} a "short syllable", potentially creating confusion between syllable length and [[vowel length]]).

A syllable was considered heavy if it contained a [[long vowel]] or a [[diphthong]] (and was therefore "long by nature" — it would be long no matter what) or if it contained a short vowel that was followed by more than one consonant ("long by position", long by virtue of its relationship to the consonants following).

{{Wikisource|1=Aeneid (Williams)/Book I|2=Aeneid (Book 1)}}
An example:
:{{lang|la|Arma virumque cano, Troiae qui primus ab oris}}
:{{lang|la|Italiam fato profugus Laviniaque venit}}
: (''[[Aeneid]]'' 1.1-2)

The first syllable of the first word (''{{lang|la|arma}}'') is heavy ("long by position") because it contains a short vowel (the A) followed by more than one consonant (R and then M) — and if not for the consonants coming after it, it would be light. The second syllable is light because it contains a short vowel (an A) followed immediately by only one consonant (the V). The next syllable is light for the same reason. The next syllable, the second syllable of the word ''{{lang|la|virumque}}'', is heavy ("long by position") because it contains a short vowel followed by more than one consonant (the M and then the Q).

But, for example, the first syllable of the word ''{{lang|la|Troiae}}'' is heavy ("long by nature") because it contains a diphthong, regardless of the sounds coming after it. Likewise, the first syllable of the second line (the first of the word ''{{lang|la|Italiam}}'') is heavy ("long by nature") because it contains a long vowel, and it will be heavy no matter what sounds come after.

Terming a syllable "long by position" is equivalent to noting that the syllable ends with a consonant (a closed syllable), because Latin and Greek speakers in the classical era pronounced a consonant as part of a preceding syllable only when it was followed by other consonants, due to the rules of Greek and Latin [[syllabification]]. In a consonant cluster, one consonant ends the preceding syllable and the rest start the following syllable. For example, Latin syllabifies ''{{lang|la|volat}}'' as ''{{lang|la|vo-lat}}'' but ''{{lang|la|dignus}}'' as ''{{lang|la|dig-nus}}'' and ''{{lang|la|monstrum}}'' as ''{{lang|la|mon-strum}}''.

===Exceptions and additions===
A few exceptions to and elaborations of the above rules of heavy and light syllables:
* The Greek letters {{lang|grc|ζ, ξ, ψ}} ([[zeta (letter)|zeta]], [[Xi (letter)|xi]], and [[psi (letter)|psi]]) and their Roman equivalents {{lang|la|Z}} and {{lang|la|X}} (and {{lang|la|PS}}) were pronounced as two consonants, so they lengthen by position despite being represented by a single character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=35 |title=Greek Grammar |first=Herbert Weir |last=Smyth |authorlink= Herbert Weir Smyth |others=Revised by Gordon M. Messing |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=Cambridge, Massachusetts |year=1920 |isbn=0-674-36250-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=6 |title=New Latin Grammar |editor1-first=J.&amp;nbsp;B. |editor1-last=Greenough |editor1-link=James Bradstreet Greenough |editor2-first=G.&amp;nbsp;L. |editor2-last=Kittredge |editor2-link=George Lyman Kittredge |editor3-first=A.&amp;nbsp;A. |editor3-last=Howard |editor4-first=Benj.&amp;nbsp;L. |display-editors = 3 |editor4-last=D'Ooge |publisher=Ginn and Company |year=1903 |isbn=0-89241-001-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, the first syllable of ''{{lang|la|gaza}}'' is heavy, despite the short vowel followed only by one written consonant, because the Z was pronounced as two consonants and lengthens the syllable by position.
* The combination [[stop consonant|stop]]–[[liquid consonant|liquid]] (usually) or stop–[[nasal consonant|nasal]] (sometimes) cohered in both Latin and Greek; that is, the two consonants were pronounced together with the speed of one consonant. As a result, they did not lengthen by position if the poet did not want them to (although they could if the poet chose). For example, the first syllable of ''{{lang|la|patris}}'' is generally light, even though it has a short vowel followed by two consonants, because the consonants cohere (and the word is syllabified ''{{lang|la|pa-tris}}''). However, the combination [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspirate]]-nasal or [[voice (phonetics)|voiced consonant]]-nasal did not cohere and always lengthened by position.
* In [[Homer]] and his imitators, the [[digamma]] ({{lang|grc|ϝ}}), a sound defunct in the standard [[History of the Greek alphabet|Ionic alphabet]] and lost from pronunciation by the classical period, was still felt enough to lengthen by position, even though it is normally not written in the Homeric poems. For example, in the line {{lang|grc|ἦ τοι μὲν τόδε καλὸν ἀκουέμεν ἐστὶν ἀοιδοῦ}} (''[[Odyssey]]'', 9.3), the first syllable of {{lang|grc|καλὸν}} is long, even though it has a short vowel followed by only one consonant, because the word was originally {{lang|grc|καλϝὸν}}, and the digamma was still felt enough to lengthen the syllable by position. Since the digamma was being lost during the time when the Homeric poems were composed, recited, and written down, its effects are sometimes not felt, so that words that would have contained a digamma sometimes do not show its effects.

As noted above, the number and order of heavy and light syllables in a line of poetry (together with [[caesura|word breaks]]) articulated the [[meter (poetry)|meter]] of the line, such as the most famous classical meter, the epic [[dactylic hexameter]].

'''Yukpa''' (Yuco, Yucpa, Yuko, Yupa) is a [[Cariban]] language, spoken by 7,000–8,000 people in [[Zulia State]] in [[Venezuela]] and across the border in [[Colombia]]. It's also known as Carib Motilón, Macoíta, Northern Motilón, Manso.

Río Casacará (Iroka) and Río Maracas are the main dialects, and different enough to maybe be considered separate languages. Also Caño Padilla–La Laguna. The Venezuelan dialects, Yrapa and Río Negro, are closer to Río Maracas than to Río Casacará. 

Similarity to [[Japrería language|Japrería]], the other Yupka language, is slight.
