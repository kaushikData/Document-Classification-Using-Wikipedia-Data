'''Alex Kahn''' (born April 9, 1967) is an American visual/performance artist and co-founder of the arts ensemble [[Processional Arts Workshop]]. He is most widely known for his creation of the large-scale puppet performance works that lead [[New York's Village Halloween Parade]] each year.

==Pageant puppetry and processional art==
[[Image:5mothsDay.jpg|thumb|left|Luna Moths, from Alex Kahn's ''Metamorphosis'', from the 1998 NY Village Halloween Parade]]
In 1998, Kahn and his partner, [[Sophia Michahelles]], brought together an ensemble of artists, puppeteers, theatrical technicians, and performers to design the annual performances that lead New York's Village Halloween Parade. Originally named "Superior Concept Monsters", the group was incorporated as a non-profit in 2005 and renamed [[Processional Arts Workshop]] with a mission to create site-specific community-built processions, parades, and other open-space performances.  These works are often developed through open community workshops that bring hundreds of volunteers together to build, rehearse, and ultimately perform cyclical pieces specifically for the parade. The performances typically incorporate elements of puppetry, sound, dance, costume/mask, lighting/projection and mobile architecture, an amalgam of mediums Kahn dubbed "processional art".

In addition to leading [[New York's Village Halloween Parade]] each year, Kahn's creations have appeared in venues nationally and internationally. His work, Metamorphosis, involving 20' tall pupating luna moths, officially opened the 2000 Henson International Festival of Puppet Theatre. In 2002, he and Michahelles initiated a midsummer pageant project in the Italian Alps village of Morinesio, drawing on local folklore and oral history to create a unique site-specific pageant. Inspired by the success of the now-annual tradition, they have seeded similar projects in diverse locales in Ukraine, Turkey, Italy, Texas, New York, and elsewhere. In 2006, Kahn was awarded a [[Fulbright Scholarship]] to [[Trinidad and Tobago]], to study the artistic and cultural structures behind Caribbean Carnival and Trinidadian "Mas'", or costumed procession. More recent PAW works have included major commissions for [[Socrates Sculpture Park]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/27/arts/design/odysseus-at-hell-gate-to-play-at-socrates-sculpture-park.html?_r=1 ''New York Times'' (8/27/2011) - "Odysseus Is Parading Into Queens" by Melena Ryzik]&lt;/ref&gt; the NY Architectural League's Beaux Arts Ball, the [[PEN World Voices]] Festival,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/video/arts/100000002875739/the-puppets-are-watching.html ''New York Times'' (5/12/2014) – Johnson, Gabe.

==Other works==

Kahn has maintained an independent practice as a theatrical designer, printmaker, installation artist, and teacher. His interdisciplinary approach was strongly influenced by his experience as technical director of the Kitchen Performance Center during the 1990s. During this time he created lighting, objects, and effects for performance artists including [[John Jesurun]] ("Chang in a Void Moon"), [[Mikel Rouse]] ("Failing Kansas"), Roseanne Spradlin, [[Meredith Monk]], [[Pauline Oliveros]], and [[David Hykes]]. Kahn trained as a master printer under [[Robert Blackburn (artist)]]  and chaired the Printmaking Department at Maine College of Art from 2000 to 2004. His [http://www.spamcantos.org Spam Cantos], a retooling of spam messages generated by Baysean algorithms into a series of letterpress poems, appeared at the Maine Institute of Contemporary Art in 2008. In 2016, Kahn performed in the role of "choir-master" in "The Visitors" a video-work by Icelandic artist [[Ragnar Kjartansson (performance artist)|Ragnar Kjartansson]], which has appeared at major museums around the world. His ongoing project, a fictional traveling museum called the Archive of the Synapse, has been exhibited nationally. ''San Francisco Chronicle'' art critic Kenneth Baker described the work as follows:

{{quote|In a dark box several objects, including a broken fluorescent tube and a floppy disk, glow with touches of color under ultraviolet light. Beneath it, a backlit label explains that traces of a lost dimension called the Synapse persist in, for example, "the fractures along which things break inexplicably . . . the penny which flips only tails, even the virus-infested computer disk." Kahn's piece makes these traces visible. He makes sly analogies between mystic-scientistic cult thinking and new art's uneasy position in the culture at large. Most remarkably, Kahn reawakens us to a true spookiness of art through the fiction of an ''X-Files''-style obsession.}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2062">'''Alvin J. Reines''' (1926–2004) was an [[United States|American]] [[Reform Judaism|Reform]] [[rabbi]], [[philosopher]] and theologian. He was professor of Philosophy and Theology at [[Hebrew Union College]].

He is known for his pluralistic religious philosophy and theology of polydoxy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.polydoxy.org Polydoxy]&lt;/ref&gt; Polydoxy emphasizes individual autonomy and [[religious freedom]]. For Reines religious believers should be free to choose which beliefs and practices they adopt whilst respecting the right of other religious believer to do the same.  Rather than there being one correct conception of [[God]] there are many.

Reines personally conceives of God as "'the enduring possibility of being," explained as "the permanent ongoing potentiality from which the universe is continually being realized," calling this position Hylotheism.

Polydoxy is presented as the opposite of [[orthodoxy]]. A religion can be polydox or an orthodox. Reines calls for a 'polydox' approach to [[Judaism]] and religion in general.

In 1972 his students founded the Institute of Creative Judaism (ICJ) which changed its name to the Polydox Institute.

The '''Associated Gospel Churches''', commonly known as '''AGC''', is a Canadian [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christian]] denomination.

== Background ==
The '''Associated Gospel Churches (AGC)''' can trace its origins to the 1890s, when the AGC began a group of independent churches, in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], that was joined together by a charter under the leadership of Rev. Dr. P.W. Philpott. In 1922, the group was named '''''the Christian Workers' Church of Canada'''''. To differentiate itself from similarly named, but theological differing groups, the denomination was renamed '''Associated Gospel Churches of Canada''' in 1925. It was federally incorporated March 18, 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Federal Corporation Information|url=https://www.ic.gc.ca/app/scr/cc/CorporationsCanada/fdrlCrpDtls.html?corpId=309877&amp;V_TOKEN=1306561755733&amp;crpNm=gospel%20church&amp;crpNmbr=&amp;bsNmbr=|work=Corporations Canada|publisher=Industry Canada|accessdate=28 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AGC began its first expansion outside of Ontario in 1940, when a group of churches based in [[Western Canada]] sought to affiliate themselves with AGC. This group of churches eventually became what is now known as '''''AGC Canada West Region'''''

In 1944, the AGC began expanding its English language ministries into the Canadian province of [[Quebec]], and began its first French language ministries in 1972.

=== Merger negotiations with the EFCC ===
{{further|Evangelical Free Church of Canada}}
In 2005 and 2006, negotiations were undertaken to see if a denominational merger with the [[Evangelical Free Church of Canada]] could take place. Talks concluded in December 2006 with no agreement.

===Leadership election (April 2007)===
In April 2007, a vote was taken at the AGC's two regional conferences with a 98% approval for Rev. Dr. Bill Fietje to take over the presidency from Rev. Bud Penner beginning in June 2008. Rev. Penner retired from the position at the AGC's National Conference at that time, which took place at [[Redeemer University College]] in Ancaster, Ontario.

== Fair Havens Ministries  ==
Fair Havens Ministries is a Bible Conference and Christian retreat centre, owned and operated by the Associated Gospel Churches (AGC). It is located near [[Beaverton, Ontario]], about 120&amp;nbsp;km (or 75 miles) north of [[Toronto]]. Attached to the Fair Havens grounds is the Fair Glen Youth Camp, a Christian Outdoor Education Centre for youth.

== Membership ==
[[Image:AGC Admin divisions.png|300px|thumb|Canadian Provinces in which the AGC has member churches]]

'''Ayahuasca''' ({{IPAc-en|UK|ˌ|aɪ|(|j|)||ə|ˈ|w|æ|s|k|ə}}, {{IPAc-en|US|-|ˈ|w|ɑː|s|k|ə}}),  '''iowaska''', or '''yagé''' ({{IPAc-en|j|ɑː|ˈ|h|eɪ|,_|j|æ|-}}), is an [[entheogen]]ic brew made out of ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'' vine and other ingredients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giesp.ffch.ufba.br/Textos%20Edward%20Digitalizados/23.pdf|title=The Ritual and Religious Use of Ayahuasca in Contemporary Brazil|last=MacRae|first=Edward|date=March 23, 1999|website=|location=Geneva, Switzerland|format=PDF|access-date=2017-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The brew is used as a [[Traditional medicine|traditional spiritual medicine]] in ceremonies among the [[Indigenous peoples in Peru|indigenous peoples]] of the [[Amazon basin]] and is known by a number of different names (see [[#Nomenclature|below]]).&lt;ref name="discovery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ayahuasca.com/ayahuasca-overviews/on-the-origins-of-ayahuasca/|title=Overviews Shamanism – On The Origin of Ayahuasca|year=2008|publisher=Ayahuasca.com|accessdate=2013-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''B. caapi'' contains several alkaloids that act as [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|monoamine oxidase inhibitors]] (MAOIs).  Another common ingredient in ayahuasca is the shrub ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' which contains the primary psychoactive compound, [[dimethyltryptamine]] (DMT). MAOIs are required for DMT to be orally active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riba|title=Human Pharmacology of Ayahuasca: Subjective and Cardiovascular Effects, Monoamine Metabolite Excretion, and Pharmacokinetics|journal=The Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics|date=Jul 2003|volume=306|issue=1|pages=73–85|doi=10.1124/jpet.103.049882|url=http://jpet.aspetjournals.org/content/306/1/73.full|accessdate=12 August 2015|display-authors=etal|pmid=12660312}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Nomenclature ==
[[File:Ayahuasca prep.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]
Ayahuasca is known by many names throughout Northern South America and [[Brazil]].

''Ayahuasca'' is the [[hispanicized]] spelling of a word in the [[Quechua languages]], which are spoken in the [[Andean states]] of [[Ecuador]], [[Bolivia]], [[Peru]], and [[Colombia]]. Speakers of Quechua languages or of the [[Aymara language]] may prefer the spelling ''ayawaska''.{{according to whom|date=April 2018}}{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} This word refers both to the [[liana]] ''[[Banisteriopsis caapi]]'', and to the brew prepared from it. In the Quechua languages, ''aya'' means "spirit, soul", "corpse, dead body", and ''waska'' means "rope" and "woody vine", "liana".&lt;ref&gt;Teofilo Laime Ajacopa, Diccionario Bilingüe Iskay simipi yuyayk'ancha, La Paz, 2007 (Quechua-Spanish dictionary)&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''ayahuasca'' has been variously translated as "liana of the soul", "liana of the dead", and "spirit liana".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cairn.info/revue-psychotropes-2002-1-page-79.htm Ayahuasca : une synthèse interdisciplinaire]. {{lang|fr|Por Frédérick Bois-Mariage}}. ''Psychotropes'' 1/2002 (Vol. 8), p. 79-113. {{doi|10.3917/psyt.081.0079}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Brazil, the brew and the liana are informally called either '''''caapi''''' or '''''cipó'''''; the latter is the Portuguese word for [[liana]] (or woody climbing vine). In the [[União do Vegetal]] of Brazil, an organised spiritual tradition in which people drink ayahuasca, the brew is prepared exclusively from ''B. caapi'' and ''[[Psychotria viridis]]''. Adherents of União do Vegetal call this brew '''''hoasca''''' or '''''vegetal''''' Brazilian Yawanawa call the brew "Uní".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grob|first1=CS|last2=McKenna|first2=DJ|last3=Callaway|first3=JC|last4=Brito|first4=GS|last5=Oberlaender|first5=G|last6=Saide|first6=OL|last7=Labigalini|first7=E|last8=Tacla|first8=C|last9=Miranda|first9=CT|last10=Strassman|first10=RJ|last11=Boone|first11=KB|title=Human Psychopharmacology of Hoasca: a plant hallucinogen used in ritual context in Brazil|journal=Journal of Nervous and Mental Disorders|date=1996|volume=184|issue=2|pages=86–94|url=https://erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_journal1.shtml|accessdate=January 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the 16th century, Christian missionaries from Spain and Portugal first encountered indigenous South Americans using ayahuasca; their earliest reports described it as "the work of the devil".&lt;ref&gt;Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975, p. 48 as cited in Soibelman 1995, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 20th century, the active chemical constituent of ''B. caapi'' was named ''[[telepathine]]'', but it was found to be identical to a chemical already isolated from ''Peganum harmala'' and was given the name [[harmine]].  Beat writer [[William S. Burroughs]] read a paper by [[Richard Evans Schultes]] on the subject and while traveling through South America in the early 1950s sought out ayahuasca in the hopes that it could relieve or cure [[opiate]] [[Substance use disorder|addiction]] (see ''[[The Yage Letters]]''). Ayahuasca became more widely known when the McKenna brothers published their experience in the Amazon in ''True Hallucinations''.  [[Dennis McKenna]] later studied pharmacology, [[botany]], and [[chemistry]] of ayahuasca and [[oo-koo-he]], which became the subject of his master's thesis.

[[Richard Evans Schultes]] allowed for [[Claudio Naranjo]] to make a special journey by canoe up the Amazon River to study ayahuasca with the South American Indians. He brought back samples of the beverage and published the first scientific description of the effects of its active alkaloids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Naranjo|first1=Claudio|title=The Healing Journey|publisher=Pantheon Books|isbn=9780394488264|pages=X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Brazil]], a number of modern religious movements based on the use of ayahuasca have emerged, the most famous of them being [[Santo Daime]] and the [[União do Vegetal]] (or UDV), usually in an [[Spiritism|animistic]] context that may be shamanistic or, more often (as with Santo Daime and the UDV), integrated with [[Christianity]]. Both Santo Daime and União do Vegetal now have members and churches throughout the world.  Similarly, the US and Europe have started to see new religious groups develop in relation to increased ayahuasca use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Labate, B.C. |author2=Rose, I.S. |author3=Santos, R.G.  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Ayahuasca Religions: a comprehensive bibliography and critical essays |location=Santa Cruz |publisher=Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies – MAPS |year=2009 |isbn=978-0-9798622-1-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some Westerners have teamed up with shamans in the Amazon rainforest regions, forming ayahuasca healing retreats that claim to be able to cure mental and physical illness and allow communication with the spirit world.

== Preparation ==
Sections of ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' vine are [[Maceration (food)|macerated]] and boiled alone or with leaves from any of a number of other plants, including ''[[Psychotria viridis]]'' (''chacruna''), ''[[Diplopterys cabrerana]]'' (also known as ''chaliponga'' and ''chacropanga''),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.spiritvine.net/ayahuasca/ |title=Ayahuasca Vine Facts {{!}} Spirit Vine Ayahuasca Retreats |work=Spirit Vine |access-date=2017-05-25 |language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Mimosa tenuiflora]]'', among other ingredients which can vary greatly from one shaman to the next.  The resulting brew may contain the powerful [[psychedelic drug]] [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] and [[monoamine oxidase inhibitor|MAO inhibiting]] [[harmala alkaloid]]s, which are necessary to make the DMT orally active. The traditional making of ayahuasca follows a ritual process that requires the user to pick the lower Chacruna leaf at sunrise, then say a prayer. The vine must be "cleaned meticulously with wooden spoons"&lt;ref name="levy"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levy |first1=Ariel |title=The Drug of Choice for the Age of Kale |url=http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2016/09/12/the-ayahuasca-boom-in-the-u-s |work=[[The New Yorker]] |date=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and pounded "with wooden mallets until it's fibre."&lt;ref name="levy"/&gt;

Brews can also be made with plants that do not contain DMT, ''Psychotria viridis'' being replaced by plants such as ''[[Justicia pectoralis]]'', ''[[Brugmansia]]'', or sacred tobacco, also known as ''mapacho'' ([[Nicotiana rustica]]), or sometimes left out with no replacement. This brew varies radically from one batch to the next, both in potency and psychoactive effect, based mainly on the skill of the shaman or brewer, as well as other admixtures sometimes added and the intent of the ceremony.  Natural variations in plant alkaloid content and profiles also affect the final concentration of alkaloids in the brew, and the physical act of cooking may also serve to modify the alkaloid profile of [[harmala]] alkaloids.&lt;ref name="Callaway2005b"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Callaway |first=J.

The actual preparation of the brew takes several hours, often taking place over the course of more than one day.  After adding the plant material, each separately at this stage, to a large pot of water it is boiled until the water is reduced by half in volume.  The individual brews are then added together and brewed until reduced significantly.  This combined brew is what is taken by participants in Ayahuasca ceremonies.

== Traditional usage ==
[[File:Ayahuasca preparation.JPG|thumb|right|Ayahuasca]]

Ayahuasca is used largely as a treasured [[sacrament]].  People who work with ayahuasca in non-traditional contexts often align themselves with the philosophies and cosmologies associated with ayahuasca [[shamanism]], as practiced among [[indigenous people]]s like the [[Urarina]] of the [[Peruvian Amazon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dean |first1= Bartholomew |year=2009 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5 |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While non-native users know of the spiritual applications of ayahuasca, a less well-known traditional usage focuses on the medicinal properties of ayahuasca. When used for its medicinal purposes, ayahuasca affects the human consciousness for less than six hours, beginning half an hour after consumption and peaking after two hours. In some cases, individuals experience significant psychological stress during the experience. Ayahuasca also has cardiovascular effects, moderately increasing  heart rate and diastolic blood pressure. It is for this reason that extreme caution should be taken with those who may be at risk of heart disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tafur |first=Joseph |title=Ayahuasca |url=http://www.nihuerao.com/eng/ayawaska.htm |access-date=2012-07-12 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120215211929/http://www.nihuerao.com/eng/ayawaska.htm |archive-date=2012-02-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychedelic effects of ayahuasca include visual and auditory stimulation, the mixing of sensory modalities, and psychological introspection that may lead to great elation, fear, or illumination. Its purgative properties are important (known as ''la purga'' or "the purge"). The intense [[vomiting]] and occasional [[diarrhea]] it induces can clear the body of worms and other tropical [[parasite]]s,&lt;ref name="Andritzky1989"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Andritzky |first=Walter |title=Sociopsychotherapeutic Functions of Ayahuasca Healing in Amazonia |journal=Journal of Psychoactive Drugs |location=San Francisco |publisher=Haight-Ashbury Pub. in Assoc. w. [[Haight-Ashbury Free Medical Clinic]] |issn=0279-1072 |oclc=7565359 |volume=21 |issue=1 |pages=77–89 |date=January–March 1989 |pmid=2656954 |doi=10.1080/02791072.1989.10472145}}&lt;/ref&gt; and harmala alkaloids themselves have been shown to be [[anthelmintic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hassan, I. |year=1967 |title=Some folk uses of Peganum harmala in India and Pakistan |journal=Economic Botany |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=384 |doi=10.1007/BF02860378 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus, this action is twofold; a direct action on the parasites by these harmala alkaloids (particularly harmine in ayahuasca) works to kill the parasites, and parasites are expelled through the increased intestinal motility caused by these alkaloids.

Dietary taboos are often associated with the use of ayahuasca.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Ott, 1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ott |first1= J. |title=Ayahuasca Analogues: Pangaean Entheogens |location=Kennewick, WA |publisher=Natural Books |year=1994  |isbn=978-0-9614234-4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the rainforest, these tend towards the purification of one's self – abstaining from spicy and heavily seasoned foods, excess fat, salt, caffeine, acidic foods (such as citrus) and sex before, after, or during a ceremony. A diet low in [[Tyramine#Occurrence|foods containing tyramine]] has been recommended, as the speculative interaction of [[tyramine]] and MAOIs could lead to a [[hypertensive crisis]]. However, evidence indicates that [[harmala alkaloids]] act only on [[Monoamine oxidase A|MAO-A]], in a reversible way similar to [[moclobemide]] (an antidepressant that does not require dietary restrictions). Dietary restrictions are not used by the highly urban Brazilian ayahuasca church [[União do Vegetal]], suggesting the risk is much lower than perceived and probably non-existent.&lt;ref name="Jonathan Ott, 1994"/&gt;

=== Role of shamans ===
[[shamanism|Shamans]] and experienced users of ayahuasca advise against consuming ayahuasca when not in the presence of one or several well-trained shamans.&lt;ref name="Campos 2011"&gt;{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, there are purported brujos (Spanish for '[[Malevolent sorcerer|Sorcerers]]') who masquerade as real shamans and who entice tourists to drink ayahuasca in their presence. Shamans believe one of the purposes for this is to steal one's energy and/or power, of which they believe every person has a limited stockpile.&lt;ref name="Campos 2011"/&gt;

=== Traditional brew ===
[[File:aya-preparation.jpg|thumb|Ayahuasca being prepared in the [[Napo Province|Napo]] region of [[Ecuador]]]]
[[File:Ayahuasca and chacruna cocinando.jpg|thumb|right|Ayahuasca cooking]]
Traditional ayahuasca brews are usually made with ''Banisteriopsis caapi'' as an [[MAOI]], while [[dimethyltryptamine]] sources and other admixtures vary from region to region.  There are several [[Banisteriopsis caapi#Types of vine|varieties of caapi]], often known as different "colors", with varying effects, potencies, and uses.

DMT admixtures:

* ''[[Ilex guayusa]]'',&lt;ref name="RatschIngredients" /&gt; a relative of [[yerba mate]]

Common admixtures with their associated ceremonial values and spirits:

*'''[[Ayahuma]]&lt;ref name="RatschIngredients" /&gt; bark''': Dead head tree. Provides protection and is used in healing susto (soul loss from spiritual fright or trauma). 
*'''Capirona&lt;ref name="RatschIngredients" /&gt; bark''': Provides cleansing and protection. It is noted for its smooth bark, white flowers, and hard wood. 
*'''Chullachaki caspi&lt;ref name="RatschIngredients" /&gt; bark''' (''[[Brysonima christianeae]]''): Provides cleansing to the physical body. Used to transcend physical body ailments.
*'''Lopuna blanca bark''': Provides protection.

*'''Uchu sanango''': Head of the sanango plants. 
*'''Huacapurana''': Giant tree of the Amazon with very hard bark.

== Non-traditional usage ==
In the late 20th century, the practice of ayahuasca drinking began spreading to [[Europe]], [[North America]] and elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Tupper"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|date=August 2008|title=The Globalization of Ayahuasca: Harm Reduction or Benefit Maximization?|journal=International Journal of Drug Policy|volume=19|issue=4|pages=297–303|citeseerx=10.1.1.517.9508|doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.11.001}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-12-12--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The first ayahuasca churches, affiliated with the [[Brazil]]ian [[Santo Daime]], were established in the [[Netherlands]]. A legal case was filed against two of the Church's leaders, [[Hans Bogers]] (one of the original founders of the Dutch Santo Daime community) and [[Geraldine Fijneman]] (the head of the [[Amsterdam]] Santo Daime community). Bogers and Fijneman were charged with distributing a [[controlled substance]] (DMT); however, the prosecution was unable to prove that the use of ayahuasca by members of the Santo Daime constituted a sufficient threat to public health and order such that it warranted denying their rights to [[religious freedom]] under [[ECHR#Article 9 - conscience and religion|ECHR Article 9]]. The 2001 verdict of the Amsterdam district court is an important precedent. Since then groups that are not affiliated to the Santo Daime have used ayahuasca, and a number of different "styles" have been developed, including non-religious approaches.

=== Ayahuasca analogues ===
[[File:Syrian Rue Seeds.jpg|thumb|right|[[Syrian rue]] seeds can be used to provide a MAOI]]
In modern Europe and North America, ayahuasca analogs are often prepared using non-traditional plants which contain the same alkaloids. For example, seeds of the Syrian rue plant can be used as a substitute for the ayahuasca vine, and the DMT-rich ''[[Mimosa hostilis]]'' is used in place of ''[[chacruna]]''. Australia has several indigenous plants which are popular among modern ayahuasqueros there, such as various DMT-rich species of ''[[Acacia]]''.

The name "ayahuasca" specifically refers to a botanical decoction that contains ''Banisteriopsis caapi''. A synthetic version, known as [[pharmahuasca]], is a combination of an appropriate MAOI and typically DMT. In this usage, the DMT is generally considered the main psychoactive active ingredient, while the MAOI merely preserves the psychoactivity of orally ingested DMT, which would otherwise be destroyed in the gut before it could be absorbed in the body. In contrast, traditionally among Amazonian tribes, the ''B. Caapi'' vine is considered to be the "spirit" of ayahuasca, the gatekeeper, and guide to the otherworldly realms.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://ayahuasca-recipe.com/ayahuasca-espana-dmt-molecula-dio-espiritual/ |title=Ayahuasca DMT La Molecula Dios |publisher=Ayahuasca-Recipe.com |date=2017-07-29 |accessdate=2017-07-31 |deadurl=yes |archivedate=July 31, 2017 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170731120620/http://ayahuasca-recipe.com/ayahuasca-espana-dmt-molecula-dio-espiritual/ |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brews similar to ayahuasca may be prepared using several plants not traditionally used in South America:

DMT admixtures:
* ''[[Acacia maidenii]]'' (Maiden's wattle) – bark *not all plants are "active strains",  meaning some plants will have very little DMT and others larger amounts
* ''[[Acacia phlebophylla]]'', and other [[Acacia]]s, most commonly employed in [[Australia]] – bark
* ''[[Acacia obtusifolia]]'' Has a similar range to ''Acacia maidenii'' – bark
* ''[[Anadenanthera peregrina]]'', ''A. colubrina, A. excelsa, A. macrocarpa''

MAOI admixtures:
* [[Harmal]] (''Peganum harmala'', Syrian rue) – seeds
* [[Passion flower]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.healthline.com/health/anxiety/calming-effects-of-passionflower|title=The Calming Effects of Passionflower|work=Healthline|access-date=2018-01-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2017}} 
* [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#List of MAOIs|synthetic MAOIs]], especially [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMAs]]

== Chemistry and pharmacology ==
[[File:Harmine structure.svg|right|thumb|Molecular structure of [[harmine]]]]
[[File:Harmaline structure.svg|right|thumb|Molecular structure of [[harmaline]]]]
[[File:Tetrahydroharmine structure.svg|right|thumb|Molecular structure of [[tetrahydroharmine]]]]
[[Harmala alkaloid]]s are MAO-inhibiting [[beta-Carboline|''beta''-carboline]]s. The three most studied harmala alkaloids in the ''B. caapi'' vine are [[harmine]], [[harmaline]] and [[tetrahydroharmine]]. Harmine and harmaline are [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Selectivity|selective]] and [[Monoamine oxidase inhibitor#Reversibility|reversible]] inhibitors of [[monoamine oxidase A]] (MAO-A), while tetrahydroharmine is a weak [[serotonin reuptake inhibitor]] (SRI).&lt;ref name="Pharmacokinetics"/&gt;

This inhibition of MAO-A allows [[Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]] to diffuse unmetabolized past the membranes in the stomach and small intestine, and eventually cross the [[blood–brain barrier]] (which, by itself, requires no MAO-A inhibition) to activate receptor sites in the brain. Without [[Reversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase A|RIMA]]s or the non-selective, nonreversible monoamine oxidase inhibition by drugs like [[phenelzine]] and [[tranylcypromine]], DMT would be oxidized (and thus rendered biologically inactive) by monoamine oxidase enzymes in the digestive tract.&lt;ref name="RIBA, J 2003"&gt;RIBA, J.

== Effects ==
People who have consumed ayahuasca report having mystical or religious experiences and [[Spirituality|spiritual]] revelations regarding their purpose on earth, the true nature of the [[universe]], and deep insight into how to be the best person they possibly can.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gorman |first=Peter |title=Ayahuasca in My Blood: 25 Years of Medicine Dreaming |year=2010 |isbn=1452882908}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is viewed by many as a spiritual awakening and what is often described as a rebirth.&lt;ref name=Campos&gt;{{cite book |last=Campos |first=Don Jose |title=The Shaman &amp; Ayahuasca: Journeys to Sacred Realms |year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|67–70}}  In addition, it is often reported that individuals feel they gain access to higher spiritual [[dimension]]s and make contact with various spiritual or extra-dimensional beings who can act as guides or healers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Metzner |first=Ralph |title=Ayahuasca: Human Consciousness and the Spirits of Nature |year=1999 |pages=46–55}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Don Jose Campos claims that people may experience profound positive life changes subsequent to consuming ayahuasca.&lt;ref name=Campos /&gt;{{rp|25–28}}  Vomiting can follow ayahuasca ingestion; this purging is considered by many [[Shamanism|shamans]] and experienced users of ayahuasca to be an essential part of the experience, as it represents the release of negative energy and emotions built up over the course of one's life.&lt;ref name=Campos /&gt;{{rp|81–85}} Others report purging in the form of [[vomiting]], [[diarrhea]], and hot/cold flushes.

The ingestion of ayahuasca can also cause significant but temporary emotional and psychological distress. Excessive use could possibly lead to [[serotonin syndrome]] (although serotonin syndrome has never been specifically caused by ayahuasca except in conjunction with certain anti-depressants like SSRI's). The temporary non-entheogenic effects of ayahuasca can, depending on dosage, include tremors, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, [[autonomic instability]], [[hyperthermia]], sweating, motor function impairment, sedation, relaxation, vertigo, dizziness, and muscle spasms, which are primarily caused by the harmala alkaloids in ayahuasca. Long-term negative effects are not known.&lt;ref name=Gables&gt;{{cite |title=Risk assessment of ritual use of oral dimethyltryptamine (DMT) and harmala alkaloids |first=Robert S. |last=Gable |journal=Addiction |volume=102 |pages=24–34 |doi=10.1111/j.1360-0443.2006.01652.x |url= https://www.iceers.org/docs/science/ayahuasca/ayahuasca-paper-addiction-ja07.pdf |accessdate=December 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |last=Schultz |first=Mitch |title=DMT: The Spirit Molecule |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A few deaths due to participation in the consumption of ayahuasca have been reported, although none have been linked specifically to ayahuasca itself, but are usually said to be due to other factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://jat.oxfordjournals.org/content/29/8/838.long |journal=J Anal Toxicol |year= 2005 |volume=29 |issue=8 |pages=838–41 |title=A fatal intoxication following the ingestion of 5-methoxy-N,N-dimethyltryptamine in an ayahuasca preparation |vauthors=Sklerov J, Levine B, Moore KA, King T, Fowler D |pmid=16356341 |doi=10.1093/jat/29.8.838}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/apr/27/british-backpacker-dies-hallucinogenic-drug-colombia |title=British backpacker dies after taking hallucinogenic brew in Colombia |author=Tracy McVeigh |work=The Observer |date= 26 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.peruviantimes.com/14/american-found-dead-after-taking-ayahuasca/16785/ |title=American Found Dead After Taking Ayahuasca |date=September 14, 2012 |work=Peruvian Times }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the deaths may have been due to unscreened preexisting heart conditions, interaction with drugs, such as [[antidepressant]]s, recreational drugs, caffeine (due to the CYP1A2 inhibition of the harmala alkaloids), or nicotine (from drinking tobacco tea for purging/cleansing), or from improper or irresponsible use due to behavioral risks or possible drug to drug interactions.&lt;ref name=Gables/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-27203322 |title=Why do people take ayahuasca? |work=BBC |date=29 April 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, it was reported that a single dose of ayahuasca significantly reduced symptoms of treatment-resistant depression in a small placebo-controlled trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Palhano-Fontes |first=Fernanda |last2=Barreto |first2=Dayanna |last3=Onias |first3=Heloisa |last4=Andrade |first4=Katia C. |last5=Novaes |first5=Morgana M. |last6=Pessoa |first6=Jessica A. |last7=Mota-Rolim |first7=Sergio A. |last8=Osório |first8=Flávia L. |last9=Sanches |first9=Rafael |date=15 June 2018 |title=Rapid antidepressant effects of the psychedelic ayahuasca in treatment-resistant depression: a randomized placebo-controlled trial |url= https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/psychological-medicine/article/rapid-antidepressant-effects-of-the-psychedelic-ayahuasca-in-treatmentresistant-depression-a-randomized-placebocontrolled-trial/E67A8A4BBE4F5F14DE8552DB9A0CBC97 |journal=Psychological Medicine |language=en |volume= |pages= |doi=10.1017/S0033291718001356 |via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legal status ==
{{main|Legality of ayahuasca by country}}

Internationally, DMT is a Schedule I drug under the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]]. The Commentary on the Convention on Psychotropic Substances notes, however, that the plants containing it are not subject to international control:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html |title=DMT – UN report |publisher=MAPS |date=2001-03-31 |accessdate=2012-01-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121083150/http://www.maps.org/pipermail/maps_forum/2001-March/003376.html |archivedate=January 21, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The cultivation of plants from which psychotropic substances are obtained is not controlled by the Vienna Convention. . . . Neither the crown (fruit, mescal button) of the Peyote cactus nor the roots of the plant Mimosa hostilis nor Psilocybe mushrooms themselves are included in Schedule 1, but only their respective principals, [[mescaline]], [[N,N-Dimethyltryptamine|DMT]], and [[psilocin]].
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A [[fax]] from the Secretary of the [[International Narcotics Control Board]] (INCB) to the Netherlands Ministry of Public Health sent in 2001 goes on to state that "Consequently, preparations (e.g. decoctions) made of these plants, including ayahuasca, are not under international control and, therefore, not subject to any of the articles of the 1971 Convention."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law10.shtml |title=Ayahuasca Vault : Law : UNDCP's Ayahuasca Fax |publisher=Erowid.org |date=2001-01-17 |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the INCB's 2001 affirmation that ayahuasca is not subject to drug control by international convention, in its 2010 Annual Report the Board recommended that governments consider controlling (i.e. criminalizing) ayahuasca at the national level. This recommendation by the INCB has been criticized as an attempt by the Board to overstep its legitimate mandate and as establishing a reason for governments to violate the human rights (i.e., religious freedom) of ceremonial ayahuasca drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tupper|first1=Kenneth W.|last2=Labate|first2=Beatriz C.|title=Plants, Psychoactive Substances and the International Narcotics Control Board: The Control of Nature and the Nature of Control|journal=Human Rights &amp; Drugs|volume=2|issue=1|pages=17–28|year=2012|accessdate=2012-12-12
|url=http://www.hr-dp.org/files/2013/12/12/HRDP_Journal_Tupper_Labate.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal status in the United States of DMT-containing plants is somewhat ambiguous. Ayahuasca plants and preparations are legal, as they contain no scheduled chemicals. However, brews&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.rockmaceguitars.com/ayahuasca-retreats-shamans-dmt/ |title=Ayahuasca Brew Confiscated in New York City |accessdate=2014-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; made using DMT containing plants are illegal since DMT is a Schedule I drug.  That said, some people are challenging this, using arguments similar to those used by peyotist religious sects, such as the [[Native American Church]]. A court case allowing the [[União do Vegetal]] to import and use the tea for religious purposes in the United States, ''[[Gonzales v. O Centro Espirita Beneficente Uniao do Vegetal]]'', was heard by the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] on November 1, 2005; the decision, released February 21, 2006, allows the UDV to use the tea in its ceremonies pursuant to the [[Religious Freedom Restoration Act]]. In a similar case an Ashland, Oregon-based Santo Daime church sued for their right to import and consume ayahuasca tea.  In March 2009, U.S. District Court Judge Panner ruled in favor of the Santo Daime, acknowledging its protection from prosecution under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://csp.org/society/docs/SantoDaimeAshland20090318.pdf |title=Ruling by District Court Judge Panner in Santo Daime case in Oregon |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religious use in Brazil was legalized after two official inquiries into the tea in the mid-1980s, which concluded that ayahuasca is not a recreational drug and has valid spiritual uses.&lt;ref&gt;More on the legal status of ayahuasca can be found in the [[Erowid]] vault on the [http://www.erowid.org/chemicals/ayahuasca/ayahuasca_law.shtml legality of ayahuasca].&lt;/ref&gt;

In France, [[Santo Daime]] won a court case allowing them to use the tea in early 2005; however, they were not allowed an exception for religious purposes, but rather for the simple reason that they did not perform chemical extractions to end up with pure DMT and harmala and the plants used were not scheduled.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060510000632/http://www.santodaime.it/Library/LAW/Francia/courdapeldeparis05_france.pdf ''Cour d'appel de Paris, 10ème chambre, section B,  dossier n° 04/01888.  Arrêt du 13 janvier 2005''] Court of Appeal of Paris, 10th Chamber, Section B, File No. 04/01888. Judgement of 13 January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  Four months after the court victory, the common ingredients of ayahuasca as well as harmala were declared ''stupéfiants'', or narcotic schedule I substances, making the tea and its ingredients illegal to use or possess.&lt;ref&gt;''JO'', 2005-05-03. [http://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/jopdf/common/jo_pdf.jsp?numJO=0&amp;dateJO=20050503&amp;numTexte=18&amp;pageDebut=07636&amp;pageFin=07636 ''Arrêté du 20 avril 2005 modifiant l'arrêté du 22 février 1990 fixant la liste des substances classées comme stupéfiants'' (PDF)] [Decree of 20 April 2005 amending the decree of 22 February 1990 establishing the list of substances scheduled as narcotics].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- NPR reported in August 2010 that it was legal, is that wrong?
In Peru, the government is undergoing the legislation process of legalizing and regulating ayahuasca usage and monitoring ayahuasca centers. Currently (April 2010) the use of ayahuasca is not technically legal but since it is an accepted practice of its indigenous cultures the Peruvian government is going through of the process maintaining the continuity of its culture whilst avoiding international issues.
--&gt;

== Intellectual property issues ==

Ayahuasca has also stirred debate regarding intellectual property protection of traditional knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tupper|first=Kenneth|date=January 2009|title=Ayahuasca Healing Beyond the Amazon: The Globalization of a Traditional Indigenous Entheogenic Practice|journal=Global Networks: A Journal of Transnational Affairs|volume=9|issue=1|pages=117–136|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0374.2009.00245.x}}&lt;!--|accessdate=2013-12-12--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986 the US Patent and Trademarks Office allowed the granting of a patent on the ayahuasca vine ''B. caapi''. It allowed this patent based on the assumption that ayahuasca's properties had not been previously described in writing. Several public interest groups, including the ''Coordinating Body of Indigenous Organizations of the Amazon Basin'' (COICA) and the ''Coalition for Amazonian Peoples and Their Environment (Amazon Coalition)'' objected. In 1999 they brought a legal challenge to this patent which had granted a private US citizen "ownership" of the knowledge of a plant that is well-known and sacred to many indigenous peoples of the Amazon, and used by them in religious and healing ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.ciel.org/Bio/Biodiversity_Accomplishments.html |title=CIEL Biodiversity Program Accomplishments |publisher=Ciel.org |accessdate=2012-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later that year the PTO issued a decision rejecting the patent, on the basis that the petitioners' arguments that the plant was not "distinctive or novel" were valid. However, the decision did not acknowledge the argument that the plant's religious or cultural values prohibited a patent. In 2001, after an appeal by the patent holder, the US Patent Office reinstated the patent. The law at the time did not allow a third party such as COICA to participate in that part of the reexamination process. The patent, held by US entrepreneur Loren Miller, expired in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Ayahuasca Patent Case |url=http://www.ciel.org/reports/legal-elements-of-the-ayahuasca-patent-case-november-1999-wiser-bw99-10-2/  |work=Our Programs: Biodiversity |publisher=The Centre for International Environmental Law |accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica''' or '''The Ritman Library''' is a private Dutch [[library]] founded by [[Joost Ritman]]. The Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica brings together manuscripts and printed works in the field of [[Hermeticism]], more specifically the 'Christian-Hermetic' tradition. It is located in the center of [[Amsterdam]].

==The library==
[[File:Corpus Hermeticum.jpg|thumb|Corpus Hermeticum: first Latin edition, by [[Marsilio Ficino]], 1471 CE.]]
The Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica was founded in 1957 by Joost Ritman, opened to the public in 1984, and is not linked to any public organisation or library.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ritman Library|first1=The|title=Hermetically open: Guide to the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica|date=2011|publisher=In de Pelikaan|location=Amsterdam|pages=44|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bibliotheca co-operates with international libraries and organizations, such as the [[Margarita Rudomino All-Russia State Library for Foreign Literature|Russian Rudomino Library for Foreign Literature]] in [[Moscow]], the [[Herzog August Bibliothek]] in [[Wolfenbüttel]], the [[Biblioteca Medicea Laurenziana]] in [[Florence]], and the [[Biblioteca Marciana]] in [[Venice]].

To date, the library holds more than 23,000 volumes on [[hermetica]], [[Rosicrucianism]], [[alchemy]], [[mysticism]], [[gnosis]], [[esotericism]] and [[comparative religion]], and has great scientific and artistic value. Other areas of the collection are [[Sufism]], [[Kabbalah]], [[anthroposophy]], [[Freemasonry]], [[Judaica]] and the [[Grail]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huismetdehoofden.nl/en/library/&lt;/ref&gt; There are around 4,500 manuscripts and books printed before 1800 CE, and around 17,000 books (primary and secondary sources) printed after 1800 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/collection/collection-profile/ The Ritman Library Website.  Retrieved: 01-19-2012]&lt;/ref&gt; Among the treasures of the Bibliotheca Philosophica Hermetica are the ''[[Corpus Hermeticum]]'' published in 1471, the first illustrated edition of [[Dante Alighieri|Dante's]] ''[[La Divina Commedia]]'' from 1481, and [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Officiis]]'' printed in 1465.

==History==
The founder of the library, [[Joost R. Ritman]] (1941), is an active Amsterdam business man with a deep interest in spirituality. He began collecting rare books at a young age, after his mother had presented him with a copy of a seventeenth-century edition of The Aurora, a work by [[Jacob Böhme]], one of the authors who are a lasting source of inspiration to him. When he conceived the plan to turn his private collection of books into a library, his vision was to bring together under one roof manuscripts and printed works in the field of the [[Hermetic tradition]], and to show the interrelatedness between the various collecting areas and their relevance for the present day. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/founder/&lt;/ref&gt; Following a difficult year in the shadow of the financial crisis and cuts, The Ritman Library reopened its doors on December 16th 2011. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/anbi/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Future==
The library is currently focussing on reshaping the once privately funded library into a self-sustaining and public institution, and on preparing the move to the [[Huis met de Hoofden]] (House with the Heads) in Amsterdam. The originally private library therefore acquired the status of a Public Benefit Institution (ANBI).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ritmanlibrary.com/anbi/&lt;/ref&gt; With the rehousing to the Keizersgracht 123, a new era begins in which the library will be passed on to a new generation and made accessible to a broader audience.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huismetdehoofden.nl/en/library&lt;/ref&gt;

==Digitizing the collection==
In June 2016 it was announced that author [[Dan Brown]], who did research in the library for some of his books, will donate Euro 300,000. This money will be used to digitize the library's core collection of 4,600 early printed books and 300 older manuscripts. These will be available online in spring 2017. The [[Prins Bernhard Cultuurfonds]] is donating Euro 15,000.&lt;ref&gt;[[NRC Handelsblad]].

[[Jack Kornfield]] commented on the first Buddhist Geeks conference was: "It's clear that the electronic virtual interconnected web and on-line world is the wild way the Dharma stream is flowing, and the geeks have their minds dialed into the revolutionary next generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/notes/jack-kornfield/thoughts-on-the-buddhist-geeks-conference-august-2011/141859532565080 Jack Kornfield, Facebook]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, Vincent Horn and Rohan Gunatillake were featured in [[Wired UK]]'s Smart List 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Smart List 2012: 50 people who will change the world|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/magazine/archive/2012/02/features/the-smart-list|publisher=Wired UK|accessdate=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Founders Vince Horn and Ryan Oelke noticed how there was little in the media specifically addressing the interests of Westerners in [[Buddhism]], and decided to create a [[podcast]] to fill the gap. It first appeared in 2007.  Horn and Oelke were both [[Religious Studies]] students of [[Naropa University]], a Buddhist-inspired [[liberal arts college]] in [[Boulder, Colorado|Boulder]], [[Colorado]].  Gwen Bell joined within six months, and remained with the team for approximately one year.

== Podcast ==
By 2010, podcast downloads had exceeded 1 million. To date, more than 330 episodes have been produced, including interviews, [[dharma talks]], and other topics of interest to people involved in modern [[Buddhist]] teaching and practice. These often include explorations of the interface between Buddhism and branches of modern science, such as [[neurology]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/11/bg-149-a-crash-course-in-applied-neurodharma/# |title=Rick Hanson, "BG 149: A Crash Course in Applied Neurodharma." |access-date=2012-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029021702/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/11/bg-149-a-crash-course-in-applied-neurodharma/# |archive-date=2012-10-29 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[game theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2012/05/bg-254-a-buddhist-game-designer/# |title=Jane McGonigal, "BG 254: A Buddhist Game Designer." |access-date=2012-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024035654/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2012/05/bg-254-a-buddhist-game-designer/# |archive-date=2012-10-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally interviewees have been invited from outside the Buddhist community, where their concerns might present matters of interest to Buddhist practitioners.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-121-the-great-work-of-western-magick/# |title=Alan Chapman, "BG 121: The Great Work of Western Magick" |access-date=2012-08-23 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111211015301/http://www.buddhistgeeks.com/2009/05/bg-121-the-great-work-of-western-magick/# |archive-date=2011-12-11 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online magazine ==
To support increasing interest from the [[Buddhist]] community, the website or online magazine was updated in 2009. The Buddhist Geeks website is the online magazine, with pages for each podcast episode as the primary content, with additional video media and blog posts.

== Conference ==

In 2010 Buddhist Geeks left the purely digital world with its first in-person event, the Buddhist Geeks Conference. The first event, held in the summer of 2011 in Los Angeles, has been featured in many publications, including Tricycle, Fast Company, and the LA Times. Since then the conference has become an annual event, featuring talks, round table discussions, and meditation.

The Buddhist Geeks Conference 2012 took place August 9 through 11th in the University Memorial Center on the Colorado University campus; the 2013 Conference was in the same venue, August 16 through 18th.

'''The Center for Jewish–Christian Understanding and Cooperation''' or '''CJCUC''' is an educational institution at which Christians who tour Israel can study the [[Hebrew Bible]] with [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox]] rabbis and learn about the Hebraic roots of Christianity. The center was established in [[Efrat]] in 2008 by Rabbi Dr. [[Shlomo Riskin]], who has been described as "the most prominent rabbinic spokesperson to Christian Zionists".&lt;ref name=jesus&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14755610.2011.633537|title=The Messiah and Rabbi Jesus: Policing the Jewish–Christian border in Christian Zionism|journal=Culture and Religion: An Interdisciplinary Journal|first=Faydra L.|last=Shapiro|year=2012|volume=12|issue=4|pages=463–477|doi=10.1080/14755610.2011.633537}}&lt;/ref&gt; CJCUC partners with major Christian interfaith organizations such as [[Christians United for Israel]] and the [[International Christian Embassy Jerusalem]].&lt;ref name=jesus/&gt;

== History ==
The ideological groundwork, which led to the eventual establishment of CJCUC in 2008, began to take shape almost 50 years beforehand. In 1964, Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], the teacher and mentor of CJCUC's Chancellor and Founder, [[Shlomo Riskin]], published an essay entitled "Confrontation"&lt;ref&gt;''Confrontation'', Tradition 6:2 p5-9, 1964. Reprinted in "A Treasury of Tradition", Hebrew Publishing Co, NY, 1967. – {{OCLC|1974913}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which he expounded his views on interfaith dialogue and carefully drew out guidelines which permitted such a dialogue and, in the view of Riskin, not only permitted it but rendered it necessary.

At around the same time, fundamental ideological shifts were forming within the ranks of the Catholic Church, and a year after Soloveitchik's essay was published, [[The Holy See]] issued ''[[Nostra aetate]]'', the Declaration on the Relation of the Church with Non-Christian Religions. ''Nostra aetate'' absolved the Jews from the [[crucifixion of Jesus]], and admitted that religious antisemitism had a significant role in laying the foundation for the atrocities perpetrated against the Jewish people.

Riskin's academic plunge into Jewish–Christian relations began in the early 1960s when he attended seminars, held by Professor [[David Flusser]], about the Christian Gospels at The [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. As an [[Orthodox Judaism|Orthodox Jew]], he could pinpoint the parallels for Jesus' teachings within the Hebrew scripture.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 15&lt;/ref&gt;

After settling in Efrat, Riskin began to engage with the Christian world. Most of the Christian visitors to Efrat, those who came to hear and learn, were [[Evangelicalism|Evangelicals]]. He formed relations with Rev. Robert Stearns of Eagles' Wings and with Pastor [[John Hagee]].&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.scribd.com/doc/93213735/gadol-2 Shabat HaGadol]'' – translated from Hebrew – page 18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shabbat-gadol"&gt;{{cite web|language=he|url=https://musaf-shabbat.com/2012/05/17/%D7%93%D7%99%D7%90%D7%9C%D7%95%D7%92-%D7%99%D7%94%D7%95%D7%93%D7%99-%D7%A0%D7%95%D7%A6%D7%A8%D7%99-%D7%97%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%91%D7%94-%D7%9E%D7%97%D7%95%D7%93%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%A9%D7%9C%D7%9E%D7%94/|title=Jewish–Christian Dialogue: Rethinking|first=Zur|last=Erlich|publisher=[[Makor Rishon]]|date=17 May 2012|access-date=25 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

of biblical sites such as nearby [[Jerusalem]], the Path of the Patriarchs and the Herodian wells.
Among the subjects that the seminar series includes are Jewish–Christian Relations; the Theology
of Biblical Holidays; Covenant and Mission; [[The Ten Commandments]]; Satan, Evil and Free Will;
[[Judaism]] and the Ministry of Jesus; and Human Life Created in the Image of God.

The center runs educational seminars for students and faculty of Catholic and Protestant seminaries in the United States, Canada, and Europe. It has appointed North American and European directors to coordinate relations with religious leaders on these continents.

CJCUC has established a Theological Think Tank, the Institute for Theological Inquiry (ITI),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardnewswire.com/news/890647512.html "CJCUC Announces the Publication of Covenant &amp; Hope"] – standardnewswire.com – 10 August 2012&lt;/ref&gt; headed by Rabbi [[Eugene Korn]] and Dr. [[Robert Jenson]] of the [[Witherspoon Institute]], which consists of international scholars and theologians whose tasks are to clarify areas of Jewish and Christian theological agreement and disagreement,&lt;ref&gt;''Covenant and Hope – Christian and Jewish Reflections'' – Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. – July 2012 – {{ISBN|978-0802867049}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as identify areas of fruitful cooperation.

The '''Christian Movement for a New Haiti''' (''Mouvement Chrétien pour une Nouvelle Haïti'', '''Mochrenha''') is a [[political party]] in [[Haiti]].

== History ==
The party was founded in 1991 by Evangelical Protestant churches.&lt;ref name="landsford"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.cl/books?id=yNGfBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2571&amp;lpg=PT2571&amp;dq=political+handbook+haiti+mopod&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=bHactV1gXM&amp;sig=PWuAMhPne6D29iiUW_J1Xlk4DXY&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAGoVChMIld3189WPxgIVDIANCh3Z2gCK#v=onepage&amp;q=political%20handbook%20haiti%20mopod&amp;f=false |title=Political Handbook of the World 2015 |first=Tom |last=Landsford |date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mochrenha was registered officially as a political party on 25 January 1999, but only on 13 July 1999 was it recognized by the electoral authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.haiticulture.ch/haiti_partis_politiques.html |title= Partis Politiques Enregistrés et Reconnus |publisher=HaitiCulture.ch |language= French}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The party gained three seats in the Chamber of Deputies at the 2000 elections.&lt;ref name="landsford"/&gt; In the [[Haitian elections, 2006|presidential elections]] of 7 February 2006, its candidate [[Luc Mesadieu]] won 3.35% of the popular vote. The party won in the 7 February 2006 Senate [[Haitian elections, 2006|elections]] 4.9% of the popular vote and no Senators.  In the 7 February and 21 April 2006 Chamber of Deputies [[Haitian elections, 2006|elections]], the party won 3 out of 99 seats.

In 2013, the party became a member of the [[Patriotic Movement of the Democratic Opposition]] (''Mouvement Patriotique de l'Opposition Démocratique'', MOPOD), a coalition of parties that oppose to President [[Michel Martelly]].&lt;ref name="landsford"/&gt;

For the [[Haitian presidential election, 2015|2015 presidential election]] Renold Jean Claude Bazin was presented as the party's candidate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lenouvelliste.com/lenouvelliste/article/145158/La-liste-complete-des-candidats-a-la-presidence |title=La liste complète des candidats à la présidence |date=May 22, 2015 |work=[[Le Nouvelliste (Haiti)|Le Nouvelliste]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Haitian parliamentary election, 2015|2015 parliamentary elections]], the party presented 3 candidates for the Senate and 19 for the Chamber of Deputies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenouvelliste.com/uploads/senateursacceptes.pdf Accepted candidates for senator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615163153/http://lenouvelliste.com/uploads/senateursacceptes.pdf |date=2015-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cephaiti.ht/files/Doc_off/Senateurs_repeches.pdf Accepted candidates for senator] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150530005115/http://www.cephaiti.ht/files/Doc_off/Senateurs_repeches.pdf |date=2015-05-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenouvelliste.com/uploads/deputesacceptes.pdf Accepted candidates for deputy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150615172143/http://lenouvelliste.com/uploads/deputesacceptes.pdf |date=2015-06-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cephaiti.ht/files/Doc_off/Deputes_repeches.pdf Accepted candidates for deputy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150616085208/http://www.cephaiti.ht/files/Doc_off/Deputes_repeches.pdf |date=2015-06-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Christopher Davies''' (1827 - 1885) was a geologist. He grew up in the [[Oswestry]] area, and began his career as the apprentice of a local ironmonger. As a member of the [[Oswestry]] Naturalists' Field Club he developed an interest in the geology of the area, and the age of 30 set himself up as a mining engineer, working mainly in north Wales, but also in [[France]] and [[Germany]].

His geological writings include his "Guide to [[Llangollen]]" (which had reached its 3rd edition by 1864), "A Treatise on Slate and Slate Quarrying in North Wales" (1878 and 1880), "A Treatise on Metalliferous Minerals and Mining" (1880), "A Treatise on Earth Minerals and Mining" (1884), and a number of papers published in the ''Geological Magazine'', the ''Proceedings of the Geologists' Association'', and the ''Quarterly Journal of the Geological Society''.

Davies was a [[Geological Society of London|Fellow of the Geological Society]]. A lay preacher, he also published a volume of sermons, ''The Christ for all the Ages''.&lt;ref name="Allibone"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Allibone|first1=Samuel Austin|title=A Critical Dictionary of English Literature and British and American Authors, Living and Deceased, from the Earliest Accounts to the Latter Half of the Nineteenth Century|date=1897|publisher=J.B.

He died on his way home from [[Norway]] in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Davies|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-DAVI-CHR-1827.html|website=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|publisher=National Library of Wales|last=Williams|first=Griffith John|accessdate= 21 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Folksgrupe''''' ({{lang-yi|פאלקסגרופע}}, 'People's Group' in [[English language|English]]) was a [[Jew]]ish [[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]] political organization in [[Russia]], founded at a meeting in [[Vilna]] in March 1905. The organization proclaimed to work for establishing 'civil, political and national rights for the Jewish People in Russia'. The full name of the organization was the '''League for the Attainment of Full Rights for the Jewish People in Russia'''. Its followers were known as ''Dostizhentsi'' (from Достижение, ''dostizheniye'', 'attainment').&lt;ref name="lenin"&gt;http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1907/apr/00c.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="geif"&gt;Geifman, Anna. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=HBg7tQ7BGY0C Russia Under the Last Tsar: Opposition and Subversion, 1894-1917]''. Malden: Blackwell Publishers, 1999. p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dubn"&gt;Dubnow, Simon, and Israel Friedlaender.

Led by three prominent lawyers, [[Maxim Vinaver]], [[Oscar Gruzenberg]] and [[Henrik Sliozberg]], it assembled [[liberalism|liberal]] elements from the [[Cadet Party]]. The party demanded equal civic rights, abolishing laws imposing restrictions on Jews, linguistic rights (the right have access to Yiddish and [[Hebrew]] schooling) and independence of religious institutions.  However, it did not advocate national autonomny for the Jews.&lt;ref name="lenin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pink"&gt;Pinkus, Benjamin.

Press, 2001. p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

The central bureau of the group was located in [[Saint Petersburg]]. Half of the bureau was based in the city and the other half was based in the provinces.&lt;ref name="dubn"/&gt;

[[Zionism|Zionists]] and the [[Folkspartei]] leader [[Simon Dubnow]] came to accuse the group of favouring assilimation. Dubnow had belonged to the group at its initial stage, and formed part of its central bureau. The party was however able to find common ground and some cooperation with the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Bund]], in their opposition to Zionism.&lt;ref name="geif"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dubn"/&gt;

"'''Get It Done'''" is the 15th episode of seventh and final season of the television show ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.

==Plot synopsis==
The First Slayer tells Buffy in a dream that "It is not enough."

[[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] are walking when a demon appears, sent by [[D'Hoffryn]] to kill Anya. Spike defeats the demon but allows it to live.

[[Robin Wood (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Principal Wood]] tells [[Buffy Summers|Buffy]] to go home and concentrate on her "real" job, killing monsters and getting ready to battle the First. Buffy takes him to the house and introduces him to the rest of the crew, including [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]]. The tension between Spike and Wood is tangible. Wood gives Buffy a bag that he got from his mother and should have been passed on to Buffy anyway.

Chloe commits suicide after the First talks to her all night. Buffy delivers a strong lecture, angering many of the others. She accuses Spike of holding back in fights and rebukes him that he used to be a better fighter before he got his soul back. She calls an emergency and opens the slayer's bag. Inside is a set of shadow figures that trigger a portal. Against the advice of her friends, Buffy jumps in, sending back an enormous demon that beats everybody up and flees. After Spike recovers, he gets his leather coat out of a trunk and tracks down the demon. Fighting with his old swagger, from before he regained his soul, Spike kills the demon after a long, brutal battle. He then drags it back to Buffy's house.

On the other side of the portal, Buffy is back in the desert where she once met the [[List of minor Buffy the Vampire Slayer characters#First Slayer|First Slayer]]. There, three African [[shaman]]s speaking [[Swahili language|Swahili]], tell her she is the last slayer to guard the Hellmouth and try to infuse her with additional essence of the demon that give all the slayers their strength. Buffy refuses the power, telling the men that they were wrong to have created the slayer line in the first place. As a parting gift, one of them touches Buffy's head and gives her a vision (though the viewer does not immediately see what it is).

After struggling with the incantation, Willow manages to reopen the portal by sucking energy from [[Anya Jenkins|Anya]] and Kennedy. Spike throws the dead demon in, and Buffy returns. Later, she tells [[Willow Rosenberg|Willow]] about the vision and admits that the First Slayer was right that what they have is not enough. Willow asks Buffy what she saw, and the vision is shown to the viewer: Inside the Hellmouth, the First has an army made up of thousands of [[Turok-Han]] vampires.

==Cultural references==
* Andrew warns Buffy that Principal Wood will see "the big board", quoting General "Buck" Turgidson's warning to the President, as the Soviet ambassador is about to be admitted into the Pentagon situation room, in ''[[Dr. Strangelove]]'' ([[1964 in film|1964]]).

==Continuity==
* This episode features the last appearance of the First Slayer in the series.
* A similar exchange portal is used to carry Buffy to Fray's future in "[[Time of Your Life (comics)|Time of Your Life]]" in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight|Season Eight]]''.
* Buffy's response to Wood regarding the [[Hellmouth (Buffyverse)|Hellmouth]] "blowing around May" is referencing the fact that the apocalypses usually occur as the season finales, which tend to air in May.
* Spike tells Robin Wood that his soul makes him "unique, more or less" – referring obliquely to Angel.
* In season 5, episode 1 "[[Buffy vs Dracula (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode)|Buffy vs Dracula]]", Dracula tells Buffy that there is darkness in her power. It is finally revealed in this episode what that really means and what that darkness is.

===Arc significance===
* The Shadow Men tell Buffy that she is the last guardian of the Hellmouth, and show her what the First is preparing on the other side of the seal.
* Spike puts back on his leather coat, last seen in the Season Six episode "[[Seeing Red (Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode)|Seeing Red]]", and with it regains his love for a good fight. Unfortunately, the coat proves to Wood that Spike in fact is the vampire who killed his mother, setting the stage for their battle.
* Kennedy finally realizes that Willow is serious when she says that her magic is not trivial or fun. This will briefly strain their relationship, but by the end of the series, Kennedy will have gained a deep respect for her girlfriend. This issue was first brought to life in the episode "[[Showtime (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Showtime]]."
* Willow performs a major feat of magic successfully, although she did revert to Dark Willow before Xander pulled her from the spell.
* This episode marks the beginning of Buffy's estrangement from the rest of the [[Scooby Gang (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Scooby Gang]].

'''''Hadashot''''' ({{Lang-he|חדשות}}, lit. ''News'') was a [[Hebrew language|Hebrew-language]] daily newspaper published in [[Israel]] between 1984 and 1993.

==History==
On 4 March 1984 [[Haaretz]] Group CEO [[Amos Schocken]] announced that a new daily newspaper, ''Hadashot'' was to be launched, with [[Yossi Klein]] as editor. It was one of the first Israeli newspapers to use colour printing.

The paper was soon hit by a scandal as it published details of the [[Kav 300 affair]] in violation of the [[Israeli Military Censor]]. Having decided not to join the [[Editors Committee (Israel)|Editors Committee]], ''Hadashot'' published a story stating that an investigative committee had been formed to look into the incident. As a result, the censor closed the paper for three days from 29 April 1984 for not sending the information about the article.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/1081759.html Revisiting the photo that exposed a Shin Bet lie] Haaretz, 28 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Although the paper was cleared of all charges in 1993, the closure damaged the momentum the paper had gained.

''Hadashot'' initially had a young, left-wing, anti-establishment image, and was written in youthful Hebrew, bordering on slang. The paper's approach was inconsistent; sometimes [[Yellow journalism|yellow]], sometimes highbrow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Society_&amp;_Culture/press.html The Israeli Press] Jewish Virtual Library&lt;/ref&gt; In later years it became more conservative. Circulation remained low and at a press conference on 29 November 1993, Schocken announced the closure of the paper. The last edition was published on 29 December 1993, with the paper having made a cumulative loss of around $20 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb4803/is_199312/ai_n17442526/ No more news from Hadashot. (newspaper business closed)] Israel Business Today, December 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior journalists at the newspaper included [[Amnon Dankner]], [[Dudu Geva]], [[Dahn Ben-Amotz]] and [[Irit Linur]]. Photojournalist [[Alex Levac]] also contributed to the newspaper.

'''''Hitler and the Occult''''', produced by Bram Roos and Phyllis Cannon, and narrated by actor David Ackroyd, is a 50-minute [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History Channel]] documentary regarding [[Nazi occultism]].

==Television and DVD release==
The documentary was originally shown on television and subsequently released on DVD on February 8, 2000 by A&amp;E Home Video. It is in colour and in the English language. It is part of the ''[[In Search of History]]'' series.

==Synopsis==
The Nazi Party reportedly grew out of several occult groups that sprang up in the late 19th century as a reaction to the advanced materialism and technology of the era. These groups spoke of the coming of a new Messiah that would save Germany. Hitler developed the notion that perhaps he was the chosen one to save the German people.{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

The political parties created in the wake of the country's defeat in [[World War I]] combined nationalistic sentiment and occultist practices to forge an image of a superior German people. Hitler's imprisonment after the failed 1923 [[Munich Beer Hall Putsch]] would make him a national hero for his defense of a strong German state, convincing him that he was the Messiah who could save Germany.

Hitler appropriated Christian symbolism, such as the [[Holy Lance|Spear of Destiny]] and the [[Holy Grail]] for his own purposes. He adopted the [[swastika]] from the Hindu/Sanskrit symbol for the Sun. The original symbol turns clockwise. The Nazi one turns backwards. The four arms of the original Hindu swastika represented the Four Vedas.{{Clarify|date=June 2016}} It decorates most Hindu homes and temples.

At the conclusion, author Dusty Sklar points out that Hitler's suicide happened during the night of April 30 – May 1, known as [[Walpurgis Night]]. The narrator continues: ''"With Hitler gone, it was as if a spell had been broken"''. Then [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]'s infamous statement of his continued subservience to Hitler at the [[Nuremberg Trials]] is taken as final evidence of Hitler's ''"occult power"'': (''"Even with all I know, if in this cell Hitler should come to me and say 'Do this!', I would still do it."'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}}

{{Japanese name|Iburi}}
'''Iburi Izō''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: 飯降伊蔵; 1833–1907) was the second spiritual leader, ''Honseki'', of [[Tenrikyo]] after the death of [[Nakayama Miki]] (Oyasama) in 1887, while Oyasama's son Shinnosuke became the administrative leader, the ''Shinbashira''. Having received the "grant of speech" from Oyasama, Iburi dictated the [[Osashizu]], additional divinely inspired instructions on the creation and maintenance of a Tenrikyo community.

Iburi was born in [[Murō, Nara]] in 1833, but was forced to leave when his family became despondent. He moved to modern-day Tenri, and sought out a wife. His first wife died in childbirth, while the second arranged marriage to a [[gambling]] addict was quickly annulled. His third wife became gravely ill after childbirth which led him to seek Tenrikyo. He became a member after his wife was healed and went to see Oyasama every day, supporting her during times of religious persecution.&lt;ref&gt;『新版 飯降伊蔵伝』（植田英蔵著、善本社、1995年）&lt;/ref&gt;

Iburi presided over a period of rapid expansion for Tenrikyo, which saw it reach villages throughout Japan. In 1896, eight percent of all Japanese citizens were dues-paying adherents of Tenrikyo.&lt;ref&gt;Arakitōryō Henshūbu. "Oyasama go-nensai o moto ni kyōshi o furikaeru, dai-ichibu: Oyasama ichi-nensai kara Oyasama sanjū-nensai made." Arakitōryō 209 (Fall 2002), p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Iburi petitioned the government to be separated from the [[Sect Shinto]] group [[Shinto Honkyoku]]; this petition was granted in 1908.

It was Iburi's intention to continue the ''Honseki'' position by passing on spiritual leadership to a worthy successor, while the ''Shinbashira'' position was passed on in the Nakayama family. He chose a woman, Naraito Ueda, for this position. But she became ill, and in 1918 a rumor was spread that she was insane, so the ''Honseki'' position ended with Iburi, and the Nakayama family took the reins as central leadership.&lt;ref&gt;芹沢光治良著「死の扉の前で」 p. 75-76&lt;/ref&gt;

}}{{Shia Islam|Branches}}{{Aqidah|Shia}}
In [[Shia Islam]], the '''imamah''' ({{lang-ar|{{large|إمامة}}}}) is the [[doctrine]] that the figures known as imams are rightfully the central figures of the [[ummah]]; the entire [[Shi'ite]] system of doctrine focuses on the imamah.&lt;ref name="SHIʿITE DOCTRINE"&gt;{{cite web|last=Amir-Moezzi|first=Mohammad Ali|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/shiite-doctrine|title=SHIʿITE DOCTRINE|publisher=Encyclopædia Iranica|accessdate=24 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shi'ites believe that the Imams are the true [[Caliph]]s or [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successors]] of [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]], and further that Imams are possessed of divine knowledge and authority ([[Ismah]]) as well as being part of the [[Ahl al-Bayt]], the family of Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Vali reza"&gt;{{harvnb|Nasr|2006|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Imams have the role of providing commentary and interpretation of the Quran&lt;ref&gt;Sociology of religions: perspectives of Ali Shariati (2008) Mir Mohammed Ibrahim&lt;/ref&gt; as well as guidance.

According to [[Nasir al-Din al-Tusi]], the Imam is a means through which humans receive [[divine grace]], because "He brings men closer to obedience (of Allah) and keeps them away from disobedience." As fulfilling the human being is his wish, it is logical that God appoints Imams to subject man to his wishes. So his existence and his deeds display two forms of grace of God toward man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nasr|first1=Seyyed Hossein|last2= Dabashi|first2=Hamid|last3= Nasr|first3=Seyyed Vali Reza|title=Shi'ism: Doctrines, Thought, and Spirituality|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m0GY_gNBqJkC|year=1988|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=978-0-88706-689-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The word "Imām" denotes a person who stands or walks "in front". For [[Sunni Islam]], the word is commonly used to mean a person who leads the course of prayer in the [[mosque]]. It also means the head of a ''[[madhhab]]'' ("school of thought"). However, from the Shia point of view this is merely the ''basic'' understanding of the word in the Arabic language and, for its proper religious usage, the word "Imam" is applicable ''only'' to those members of the house of Muhammad designated as [[Infallibility|infallible]] by the preceding Imam.

== Introduction ==
The Shia further believe only these A'immah have the right to be Caliphs, meaning that all other caliphs, whether elected by consensus (''[[Ijma]]'') or not, are usurpers of the [[Caliphate]] so those were political positions not divine positions.

All Muslims believe that Muhammad had said: "To whomsoever I am [[Mawla]], [[Ali]] is his Mawla." This hadith has been narrated in different ways by many different sources in no less than 45 hadith books{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} of both Sunni and Shia collections. This hadith has also been narrated by the collector of hadiths, al-Tirmidhi, 3713;{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} as well as Ibn Maajah, 121;{{Citation needed|date=June 2014}} etc. The major point of conflict between the Sunni and the Shia is in the interpretation of the word 'Mawla'. For the Shia the word means 'Master' and has the same elevated significance as when the term had been used to address Muhammad himself during his lifetime. Thus, when Muhammad actually (by speech) and physically (by way of having his closest companions including Abu Bakr, Umar and Uthman [the three future Caliphs who had preceded Ali as Caliph] ''publicly'' accept Ali as their Master by taking Ali's hand in both of theirs as token of their allegiance to Ali) ''transferred'' this title and manner of addressing Ali as the Mawla for all Muslims at Ghadiri Khum Oasis just a few months before his death, the people that came to look upon Ali as Muhammad's ''immediate successor'' even before Muhamamd's death came to be known as the Shia. However, for the Sunnis the word simply means the 'beloved' or the 'revered' and has no other significance at all.

== Sects ==
{{main|Muslim sects}}
Within Shia Islam (Shiism), the various sects came into being because they differed over their Imams' successions, just as the Shia - Sunni separation within Islam itself had come into being from the dispute that had arisen over the succession to [[Muhammad]]. Each succession dispute brought forth a different [[tariqah]] (literal meaning 'path'; extended meaning 'sect') within Shia Islam. Each Shia tariqah followed its own particular Imam's dynasty, thus resulting in different numbers of Imams for each particular Shia tariqah. When the dynastic line of the separating successor Imam ended with no heir to succeed him, then either he (the last Imam) or his unborn successor was believed to have gone into concealment, that is, [[The Occultation]].

The Shia tariqah with a majority of adherents are the [[Twelvers]] who are commonly known as the "Shia". After that come the [[Nizari]] Ismailis commonly known as the [[Ismailism|Ismailis]]; and then come the Mustalian Ismailis commonly known as the "Bohras" with further schisms within their Bohri tariqah. The Druze tariqah initially were part of the Fatimid Ismailis and separated from them (the Fatimid Ismailis) after the death of the Fatimid Imam and Caliph al Hakim Bi Amrillah. The Shia Sevener tariqah no longer exists. Another small tariqah is the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] Shias, also known as the Fivers and who do not believe in The Occultation of their last Imam.

Although all these different Shia tariqahs belong to the Shia group (as opposed to the Sunni group) in Islam, there are major doctrinal differences between the main Shia tariqahs. After that there is the complete doctrinal break between all the different Shia tariqahs whose last Imams have gone into Occultation and the Shia Nizari Ismailis who deny the very concept of Occultation. The Shia Nizari Ismailis by definition have to have a present and living Imam until the end of time.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Thus if any living Nizari Ismaili Imam fails to leave behind a successor after him then the Nizari Ismailism’s cardinal principle would be broken and it’s very raison d'être would come to an end.

===Twelver view===
{{Twelvers|collapsed=1}}
{{main|Theology of Twelvers|Twelver}}
Shias believe that Imamah is of the Principles of Faith [[Theology of Twelvers|(Usul al-Din)]].  As the verse [http://tanzil.net/#4:165 4:165] of [[Quran]] expresses the necessity to the appointment of the [[prophets]]; so after the demise of the prophet who will play the role of the prophet; till the people have not any plea against [[Allah]].  The same logic that necessitated the assignment of prophets also is applied for Imamah.  That is Allah must assign someone similar to prophet in his attributes and Ismah as his successor to guide the people without any deviation in religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tabataba'i|2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They refer to the verse ''(...This day I have perfected for you your religion and completed My favor upon you and have approved for you Islam as religion...)'' [http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/5:3 5:3] of [[Quran]] which was revealed to the prophet when he appointed [[Ali]] as his [[Succession to Muhammad|successor]] at the day of [[Hadith of the pond of Khumm|Ghadir Khumm]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|al-Tijani al-Samawi||p=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the verse [http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/2:124 Quran, 2:124], Shias believe that Imamah is a divine position always Imamah is accompanied by the word guidance, of course a guidance by God's Command.A kind of guidance which brings humanity to the goal. Regarding [http://tanzil.net/#17:71 17:71], no age can be without an Imam. So, according to the upper verse 1.Imamah is a position which is appointed by God and must be specified by Him 2.Imam is protected by a divine protection and no one exceles him in nobility 3. No age can be without an Imam and finally Imam knows everything which is needed for human being to get to the truth and goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Ayoub|1984|p=157}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Why only (specific) members of Muhammad's family?====
{{Confusing section|reason=it is not coherent, it is unclear how its text explains what the heading states and some parts read like [[WP: OR]]|date=December 2015|small}}
It is forbidden for the Divine Leader not to be from the family of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sahih Moslem|last=Moslem bin Hajjaj|first=|publisher=Dar Tayibbah|year=2006|isbn=|location=|pages=882|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ali al-Ridha]], since it is obligatory to obey him, there should be a sign to clearly indicate the Divine Leader. That sign is his well-known ties of kinship with Muhammad and his clear appointment so that the people could distinguish him from others, and be clearly guided toward him.&lt;ref name="al-Shaykh al-Saduq"&gt;{{harvnb|al-Shaykh al-Saduq|2006|p=194}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sharif"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi|2003|P=30-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Otherwise others are nobler than Muhammad's offspring and they are to be followed and obeyed; and the offspring of Muhammad are obedient and subject to the offspring of Muhammad’s enemies such as [[Amr ibn Hisham|Abi Jahl]] or Ibn Abi Ma’eet.{{Original research inline|date=December 2015}} However, Muhammad is much nobler than others to be in charge and to be obeyed.&lt;ref name="al-Shaykh al-Saduq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sharif"/&gt;
Moreover, once the prophethood of Muhammad is testified they would obey him, no one would hesitate to follow his offspring and this would not be hard for anyone.&lt;ref name="al-Shaykh al-Saduq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sharif"/&gt; While to follow the offspring of the corrupted families is difficult.{{Original research inline|date=December 2015}} And that is maybe why the basic characteristic of Muhammad and other prophets was their nobility.{{Original research inline|date=December 2015}} For none of them, it is said, were originated from a disgraced family.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} It is believed that all Muhammad's ancestors up to Adam were true Muslims. {{efn|The Sufi spiritual leader [[Ibn Arabi]] said:A Muslim is a person who has dedicated his worship exclusively to God...''Islam'' means making one's religion and faith God's alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Razi|1900|p=432}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}
Jesus was also from a pious family, as it is mentioned in Quran that after his birth, people said to [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]]: O sister of Aaron, your father was not a man of evil, nor was your mother unchaste."{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#trans/en.sahih/ 19:28]}}{{Synthesis inline|date=December 2015}}

The doctrine of the Imamate in Isma'ilism differs from that of the Twelvers because the Isma'ilis had living Imams for centuries after the last Twelver Imam went into concealment. They followed Isma'il ibn Jafar, elder brother of [[Musa al-Kadhim]], as the rightful Imam after his father, [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]]. The Ismailis believe that whether Imam Ismail did or did not die before Imam Ja'far, he had passed on the mantle of the imamate to his son Muhammad ibn Isma'il as the next imam.

According to Isma'ilism, [[God in Islam|God]] has sent seven great prophets known as ''Nātiq''s "Speaker" in order to disseminate and improve his [[din (Arabic)|dīn]] of ''[[Islam]]''. All of these great prophets has also one assistant known as ''Sāmad'' "Silent" Imām. At the end of each seven ''Sāmad'' [[silsila]]s, one great ''Nātiq'' has been sent in order to improve the faith. After [[Adam]] and his son [[Seth]], and after six ''Nātiq–Sāmad'' silsila&lt;ref&gt;{{Iranica|dawr-1|Dawr 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Noah in Islam|Noah]]–[[Shem]]), ([[Abraham in Islam|Abraham]]–[[Ishmael in Islam|Ishmael]]), ([[Moses]]–[[Aaron]]), ([[Jesus in Islam|Jesus]]–[[Simeon (son of Jacob)|Simeon, son of Jacob]]), ([[Muhammad]]–[[Ali]]); the silsila of ''Nātiq''s and ''Sāmad''s have been completed with [[Muhammad ibn Isma'il]].

====Why Imam from Only (specific) Members Family====
Ismailis view Imams are true representative of God. God has made all prophets his representative. Individual prophets era are distinct. After one prophets God created next prophet. Islam view that Mohammed is last prophet. Mohammed appointed his specific representative Ali. Ali made imams as his next representative and one imam appointed another till date. The Isma'ili view that these Imam are only from their hereditary chain and their appointment is a must, and Earth cannot remain vacant, without presence of Imam.&lt;ref&gt;[http://iis.ac.uk/ru/node/254471, Historical representations of a Fatimid Imam-caliph: Exploring al-Maqrizi’s and Idris’ writings on al-Mu‘izz Li Din Allah, Dr. Shainool Jiwa]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.al-islam.org/shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt-dilp-team shiite-encyclopedia-ahlul-bayt]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Original research inline|date=December 2016|comment=clear citation required}}

===Zaidi view===
{{main|Zaidiyyah}}
[[Zaidiyyah]] or Zaidi is a Shia [[madhhab]] (sect, school) named after the imam [[Zayd ibn Ali]]. Followers of the Zaidi fiqh are called Zaidis (or are occasionally called '''Fivers''' in the West). However, there is also a group called the Zaidi ''Wasītī''s who are Twelvers.

In the context of the Shi'a Muslim belief in spiritual leadership or Imamate, Zaydis believe that the leader of the [[Ummah]] or Muslim community must be ''Fatimids'': descendants of Muhammad through his only surviving daughter [[Fatimah]], whose sons were [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hasan ibn ʻAlī]] and [[Husayn ibn Ali|Husayn ibn ʻAlī]]. These Shi'a called themselves Zaydi so they could differentiate themselves from other Shi'is who refused to take up arms with Zayd ibn Ali.

Zaydis believe Zayd ibn Ali was the rightful successor to the Imamate because he led a rebellion against the [[Umayyad Caliphate]], who he believed were tyrannical and corrupt. [[Muhammad al-Baqir]] did not engage in political action and the followers of Zayd believed that a true Imām must fight against corrupt rulers.&lt;ref name="Arab East 1996, p97"&gt;''Islamic Dynasties of the Arab East: State and Civilization during the Later Medieval Times'' by Abdul Ali, M.D. Publications Pvt. Ltd., 1996, p97&lt;/ref&gt; The renowned Muslim jurist [[Abu Hanifa]] who is credited for the [[Hanafi]] school of [[Sunni]] Islam, delivered a [[fatwā]] or legal statement in favour of Zayd in his rebellion against the Umayyad ruler. He also urged people in secret to join the uprising and delivered funds to Zayd.&lt;ref&gt;''Ahkam al-Quran'' By Abu Bakr al-Jassas al-Razi, volume 1 page 100, published by Dar Al-Fikr Al-Beirutiyya&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[Twelver]] Shi'ites, Zaydis do not believe in the infallibility of Imāms&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Francis Robinson]], ''Atlas of the Islamic World Since 1500'', pg. 47. [[New York City|New York]]: [[Facts on File]], 1984. {{ISBN|0871966298}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Zaidiyyah |title=Zaidiyyah|work=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaydi Islam John Pike - http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/intro/islam-zaydi.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and do not believe that the Imāmate must pass from father to son—but believe it can be held by any descendant, from either Hasan ibn ʻAlī or Husayn ibn ʻAlī.

==The period of occultation==
===Twelver view===
{{main|The Occultation}}
The period of occultation (''ghaybat'') is divided into two parts:

* ''Ghaybat al-Sughra'' or Minor Occultation (874–941), consists of the first few decades after the Imam's disappearance when communication with him was maintained through deputies of the Imam.
* ''Ghaybat al-Kubra'' or Major Occultation began 941 and is believed to continue until a time decided by [[God in Islam|God]], when the Mahdi will reappear to bring absolute justice to the world.

During the Minor Occultation (''Ghaybat al-Sughrá''), it is believed that al-Mahdi maintained contact with his followers via deputies ([[Arabic language|Arab.]] ''an-nuwāb al-arbaʻa'' or "the Four Leaders"). They represented him and acted as agents between him and his followers. Whenever the believers faced a problem, they would write their concerns and send them to his deputy. The deputy would ascertain his verdict, endorse it with his seal and signature and return it to the relevant parties. The deputies also collected [[zakat]] and [[khums]] on his behalf.

For the Shia, the idea of consulting a hidden Imam was not something new because the two prior [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Twelver Imams]] had, on occasion, met with their followers from behind a curtain. Also, during the oppressive rule of the later Abbasid caliphs, the Shia Imams were heavily persecuted and held prisoners, thus their followers were forced to consult their Imams via messengers or secretly.

Shia Tradition hold that four deputies acted in succession to one another:

# [[Uthman ibn Sa’id al-Asadi]]
# [[Abu Jafar Muhammad ibn Uthman]]
# [[Abul Qasim Husayn ibn Ruh al-Nawbakhti]]
# [[Abul Hasan Ali ibn Muhammad al-Samarri]]

In 941 (329 AH), the fourth deputy announced an order by al-Mahdi, that the deputy would soon die and that the deputyship would end and the period of the Major Occultation would begin.

The fourth deputy died six days later and the Shia Muslims continue to await the reappearance of the Mahdi. In the same year, many notable Shia scholars such as [[Ali ibn Babawayh Qummi]] and [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Muhammad ibn Ya'qub Kulayni]], the learned compiler of ''[[Kitab al-Kafi]]'', also died.

One view is that the Hidden Imam is on earth "among the body of the Shia" but "incognito." "Numerous stories" exist of the Hidden Imam "manifesting himself to prominent members of the ulama."&lt;ref&gt;Momen, Moojan, ''An Introduction to Shi'i Islam'', Yale University Press, 1985, p.199&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Ismā'īlī view===
{{main|Imamah (Ismaili doctrine)}}
{{Ismailis|collapsed=1}}
The Ismailis differ from [[Twelver]]s because they had living [[imam]]s for centuries after the last Twelver Imam went into concealment. They followed [[Isma'il ibn Jafar]], elder brother of [[Musa al-Kadhim]], as the rightful Imam&lt;ref&gt;Rise of The Fatimids, by W. Ivanow. Page 81, 275&lt;/ref&gt; after his father [[Ja'far al-Sadiq]].

====First phase====
The eighth Imam, [[Ahmad al-Wafi (Abadullah)|Abd Allah al-Akbar]] of the [[Ismailism|Ismaili Shia]] remained hidden but continued the Ismaili movement in the 9th century in [[Salamiyah]], [[Syria]]. The eighth to tenth Imams, ([[Ahmad al-Wafi (Abadullah)|Abadullah]], [[Muhammad at-Taqi (Ahmed ibn Abadullah)|Ahmed]] and [[Rabi Abdullah|Husain]]), remained hidden and worked for the movement against the period's time's rulers. First phase of seclusion ends with 10th Imam. The 11th Imam [[Abdullah al-Mahdi Billah]], under the guise of being a merchant, and his son had made their way to [[Sijilmasa]],{{sfn|Yeomans|2006|p=43}} fleeing persecution by the [[Abbasid]]s. Imam Abdullah founded [[Fatimid Caliphate]].  The Fatimid Ismaili Imams continued till 20th Imam holding the post of caliph also, ruling a vast part of Arabian peninsula.

====Second phase====
Upon the death of the twentieth Imam, [[al-Amir bi-Ahkami'l-Lah]] (d. {{AH|526}}), his two-year old child [[at-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim]] (b. {{AH|524}}) was appointed twenty-first Imam. The supporters of Tayyeb became the [[Tayyibi]] Ismāʿīlī.  As Tayyeb was not in position to run the [[dawah]], Queen [[Arwa al-Sulayhi]], the [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]], acted as his [[regent]].  Imam Tayyeb was hidden, and second phase of seclusion started. The Da'i had now been given absolute authority and made independent from political activity.  With period of time [[Tayyibi]] divided further into several sects headed by different Dai they believed. These Dai continued acting on behalf of hidden Imams till date. [[Dawoodi Bohra]] is biggest amongst them with population spread over many countries all over the continentals.

== Imams ==
[[File:Mahdi.JPG|thumb|left|The name of Imam as it appears in [[Masjid Nabawi]].]]

===Twelver Imams===
{{main|Imamah (Twelver Shi`i Doctrine)}}
According to the majority of Shī'a, namely the [[Twelver]]s (''Ithnā'ashariyya''), the following is a listing of the rightful successors to Muḥammad. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam except for [[Husayn ibn Ali|Hussayn ibn 'Alī]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali|Hassan ibn 'Alī]].The belief in this succession to Muḥammad stems from various Quranic verses which include: 75:36, 13:7, 35:24, 2:30, 2:124, 36:26, 7:142, 42:23.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} They support their discussion by citing Genesis 17:19–20 and Sunni hadith:Sahih Muslim, Hadith number 4478, English translation by Abdul Hamid Siddiqui.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[Muslim ibn al-Hajjaj|Imam Muslim]] (translated by Aftab Shahryar)|title=Sahih Muslim Abridged|publisher=Islamic Book Service|year=2004|isbn=81-7231-592-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{original research inline|date=December 2015}}

====List of The Twelve Imams====
{{main|The Twelve Imams}}
According to Twelvers, there is always an Imam of the era, who is the divinely appointed authority on all matters of faith and law in the Muslim community. [[Ali]] was the first of the Twelve Imams, and, in the Twelvers and Sufis' view, the [[Succession to Muhammad|rightful successor to Muhammad]], followed by male [[descendants of Muhammad]] through his daughter [[Fatimah]]. Each Imam was the son of the previous Imam, with the exception of [[Husayn ibn Ali]], who was the brother of [[Hasan ibn Ali]]. The twelfth and final Imam is [[Muhammad al-Mahdi]], who is believed by the Twelvers to be currently alive, and hidden in [[The Occultation#Major Occultation|the Major Occultation]] until he returns to bring justice to the world.&lt;ref name="Imamat"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia=Encyclopaedia of Islam and the Muslim world; vol.1 |last=Gleave |first=Robert |title=Imamate |publisher=MacMillan |isbn=0-02-865604-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed by Twelver and [[Alevism|Alevi]] Muslims that the Twelve Imams have been foretold in the [[Hadith of the Twelve Successors]]. All of the Imams met unnatural deaths, with the exception of the last Imam, who according to Twelver and Alevi belief, is living in occultation.

=== Ismaili Imams ===
{{main|List of Ismaili imams}}
The Ismaili line of imams for both sects (the [[Nizari]] and [[Musta'li]]) continues undivided until [[al-Mustansir Billah]] (d. 1094). After his death the line of the imamat separates into the Nizari and Musta'li dynasties.

The line of imams of the Musta'li Muslims (also known as the Bohras/[[Dawoodi Bohra]]) continued up to Aamir ibn Mustali. After his death, they believe their 21st Imam, [[at-Tayyib Abu'l-Qasim]] went into a Dawr-e Satr (period of concealment) that continues to this day. In the absence of an imam they are led by a [[Da'i al-Mutlaq]] (absolute missionary) who manages the affairs of the Imam-in-Concealment until re-emergence of the Imam from concealment.

The line of imams of the Nizari Ismaili Shia Muslims (also known as the Agha-khani Ismailis in South and Central Asia) continues to their present living 49th hereditary imam, [[Aga Khan IV]] (son of [[Prince Aly Khan]]). They are the only Shia Muslim community today led by a present and living (Hazir wa Mawjud) imam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.akdn.org|title=Aga Khan Development Network|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
{{see also|Musta'li|Hafizi|Nizari}}
[[File:Branch of Shi'a Islam.png|800px|thumb|center|Note: [[Kaysanites|Kaysani]]'s Imām [[Muhammad ibn al-Hanafiyyah]] is descendant of Ali from Ali's  wife [[Khawlah bint Ja'far]]]]

=== Zaidi Imams ===
{{main|Imams of Yemen}}
The Zaidi branch of Shi'ism established its own line of Imams starting in the year 897; the line continued without interruption until 1962 when the [[North Yemen Civil War]] brought the Imamate to an end and established a republic.

== Sunni view of the Shia Imamate ==
The Syrian mufti [[Ibn Taymiyyah]] (d. 728 AH/1328 AD) composed a long refutation of the notion of the Imamate in his ''[[Minhaj as-Sunnah an-Nabawiyyah]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See "Ibn Taymiyya’s Critique of Shia Imamology. Translation of Three Sections of his "Minhāj al-Sunna", by Yahya Michot, ''The Muslim World'', 104/1-2 (2014), pp. 109-149.&lt;/ref&gt;

The belief of the Twelver Imamah with the consideration of the sacred status of the four [[Rashidun]] Caliphs is shared in [[Sunni Islam]], due to the following hadith of Muhammad:

"I heard the Apostle of Allah say 'Islam shall not cease to be glorious up to twelve Caliphs, every one of them being from the [[Quraysh|Quraish]]'". (And in a narration) "The affairs of men will not cease to decline so long as twelve men will rule over them, every one of them coming from Quraish. And in a narration: The religion will continue to be established till the hour comes as there are twelve Caliphs over them, everyone of them coming from the Quraish"
&lt;ref&gt;Mishkat al Masabih Vol 4 p 576, Hadith 5&lt;/ref&gt;

"The affairs of the people will continue to be conducted as long as they are governed by twelve men, he then added from Quraish"
&lt;ref&gt;Sahih Muslim, Hadith number 4478&lt;/ref&gt;

"I will be followed by twelve Khalifas all will be Quraysh". 
&lt;ref&gt;Sunan Tirmidhi Volume 1 page 813&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Saivism}}
The '''Jangam''' or '''Jangama''' are a [[Shaivism|Shaiva]] order of wandering religious [[monk]]s.They belong to Veerashaiva Lingayat community. They are the priests or [[guru]]s of the [[Shaivism|Hindu Shaiva]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page= 222 | year = 1995 | title= The tribes and castes of the central provinces of India, Volume 1 |last=Russell|first=R. V.|last2=Lal|first2=Hira |ISBN=81-206-0833-X| publisher=Asian Educational Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is an age old tradition calling Jangamas as gurus of'Lingayat’ .Jangamas are disciples of Lord Shiva as mentioned in Puranas. A visit of a jangam to a house is treated as the visit of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] himself and the jangam shall be given good alms and the jangam blesses the natives. The Jangam is the wandering holy man in Virashaivism. Jangams are to he regarded as moving and living lingas. And are therefore superior to fixed lingas - made of stones and
installed in temples as also worn on persons as mentioned in purnas.

==History==
According to the [[Hindu mythology]] of India, Goddess Parvati had claimed that she had given birth to Lord Ganesh (elephant headed Deity) when she died as Sati (previous incarnation who died by self-immolation). She told [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]. that he too should also create a similar lord. [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] proceeded to cut his thigh and his blood spilled on the lifeless statue known as Kusha which immediately came alive and was thereafter referred to as Jangam. ''The term 'Jangam’ (or) 'Jangam Sages' in [[Himalayas]], [[Kashi]] and [[Kumbh mela]] (or) 'Jangam Sadhu' in [[Hindu Temples]] (or)'Jangam Ayya' in [[Karnataka]] Priestly Section (or) 'Jangam Lingayat Pandaram' in [[Tamil Nadu]] Priestly Section and [[Kerala]] (or) Jangam Jogi in [[Haryana]] (or) 'Jangam Baba' in North India (or) Jangam [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] in [[Andhra Pradesh]] (or) Jangam Guru in [[Nepal]] is also the name given to the wandering Shivite (Hindu worshippers of [[Lord Shiva]]) mendicants who are believed to be descendants of the original ‘Jangam’.'' They function as priests or [[Guru]] for all those who follow the Shivite cult and for those who don’t avail of services of the Brahmin priests. In most temples the priests who conduct the religious rituals are Brahmins however this is not true for the [[Lord Shiva]] temples where the Jangams perform the Pooja (prayer and worship of [[Lord Shiva]]). The Jangam priests may preside over all rituals however special regard is given to marriage rites in [[Lingayatism]] and [[Shaivism]] section of [[Hinduism]].

===Jangama Dhyana===

[[Jangama dhyana]] technique is associated with Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj and his direct disciple Shri Shivarudra Balayogi Maharaj. On 7 August 1949, Shri Shivabalayogi experienced a vision of a tall Jangama Sage (ancient order of ascetics) with matted hair, who told him to sit in padmasana (lotus posture), and close his eyes. The Sage then touched the young boy between the eyebrows and instructed, 'Watch here.' Thus, Shri Shivabalayogi Maharaj sat in tapas (deep, prolonged meditation) for twelve years, meditating for 23 hours a day for eight years and around 12 hours a day for the remaining four years. After this period, he initiated tens of thousands of people into the meditation technique he had used to achieve Self Realization.
	
The name for the technique was coined by Shri Shivabalayogi while walking around the Dehradun ashram one night with his direct disciple, Seenu, who was later to become the Enlightened Yogi, Shri Shivarudra Balayogi. He suddenly turned to Seenu and said:

"Perhaps it would be nice to name the meditation technique we are teaching worldwide as Jangama dhyana. Lord Shiva first appeared to me in the form of a Jangama Sage to impart the technique, and Jangama means 'Eternal Existence'; so Jangama dhyana would mean 'meditation on the Eternal Existence of the Self."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Young, 2008, Guru-Disciple, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt;

Shiva. Jangam also called as Veerashaiva Brahmins.

===Jangam or Jangama Lingayat or Jangam Ayya (the priest hood section of Lingayathism) in [[Karnataka]]:=== 

[[Lingayatism|Lingayath]] contains two sections, one the ancient race of Veerashaiva jangam ( the priests at Srisailam and Kedarnath since the times of [[Adi Shankara]]charya) and the Lingayat which constitutes all different working classes of the society. Jangam Lingayaths where Ishtalinga on their chest hanging through a thread in Karnataka. After death they are buried in Dhyana-Mudra with [[Lingam|Linga]] in hand or they have given Samadhi or called Lingaekya or merger in god Linga. They believe in formless god in form of Ista-Linga and no other idol . ''The Jangam Lingayat or Jangam are known as [[Lingayatism|Lingayath]] or True Lingayath or Movable [[Lingam]] or Jangam Sage or Jangama or Lingayat Priest or Jangam Guru or [[Guru]]/ Jangam Ayya in [[Lord Basava]] Period of [[Lingayatism|Lingayath Religion]]  and [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples in [[Karnataka]]''.

===Jangam Jogi or Jangam: From the Region of [[Haryana]]===
Jangam Jogi are folk musicians associated with region of Haryana. Jangam is a style of devotional music dedicated to [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] by Jangam community from Haryana. Their instruments are small and portable (being travellers) like dafli, khanjari, khartal.  Jangam Gāyan:  Devotional Music and Folk Music of India:   Jangam Gāyan is a narrative sung by the Jangam and is performed in the temple courtyards of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples to huge gatherings. Sometimes, there are public performances in village squares. The members of this community are wandering mendicants and earn their living mainly by performing the element in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples. The Jangams are also live in Shiva the state of [[Haryana]] in [[India]]. The community is concentrated in and around [[Kurukshetra]], the great battle field of the epic of Mahabharata and in the historical town of Thaneswar which has been a strong centre of the Pasupati ([[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]) tradition of [[Shaivism]].  Besides, they also move as itinerant religious mendicants in the adjoining states of [[Punjab]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Uttaranchal]], [[Himachal Pradesh]] and [[Jammu and Kashmir]] in north India.

===Jangam or Jangam [[Deva (Hinduism)|Deva]] or Jangamayya in [[Andhra Pradesh]]  and [[Telangana]]===
At present, Jangam follows the [[Hindu mythology]] of Jangam i.e., according to [[Hindu mythology]]  of [[Lord Shiva]]  they would live by Religious priestly performance (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru). Jangam Katha [[Burra katha]]: Folk Dance in [[Andhra Pradesh]]: Jangam Katha is a special folk dance of the [[Andhra Pradesh]] state. Jangam Katha, is a special Dance of [[Andhra Pradesh]] Jangam or Jangam Deva or Jangamayya and it observes tales from the Indian [[Hindu Mythology]]. In the performance, the main artist (Jangam or Jangam Deva or Jangamayya) narrates a story, plays music and dance on the tunes. The co-artists beat drums and speak to him, enriching certain events in the story. Now, Jangam Katha is called as [[Burra katha]], Tamboora Katha and Saradha Katha. Jangam or Jangama is one who is endowed with the true [[knowledge]], sacrificed his life for the society, and avoided all the worldly happiness and attained the divine happiness. Jangam, a [[Sanskrit|Sanskrit word]], etymologically means that which moves. When this word applied to a person, in the context of [[Lingayatism|Lingayath religion]], it symbolizes a man who moves from place to place preaching moral and religious values in [[Shaivism]], [[Lingayatism]] and [[Jangama dhyana]] section of [[Hinduism]]. 

===Jangam Dance, Indian Folk Dance===
Jangam Dance is an Indian folk dance performed in the honour of [[Lord Shiva]] in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples. Those who perform this traditional dance are called Jangam dancers. The term Jangam has been derived from the movable emblem of [[Lord Shiva]]. Jangam is a sub-caste of the Lingayat (Veerashaiva) community called [[Lingayatism|Lingayath religion]]. The Jangams migrated from [[Karnataka]] and [[Andra Pradesh]] states of [[India]] in order to disseminate the Shaivaite cult and to act as priests for those who do not avail the services of Brahmans for performing religious rites in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples. While performing Jangam dance, the dancers recite verses on the mythological marriage of Siva and Parvati. The recitation is done in a ritualistic hypnotic monotone. As performers, they entertain people during religious and social festivals in the obscurity of the villages. Their dramatic presence is heightened by their headgear, a brass band with the image of a snake and peacock feathers flashing in the air. Their narrative and rhythmic movement is embellished by bells, gongs, manjim or cymbals, and chhenna or percussion sticks, weaving the most incredible musical patterns. Presently, forced into penury by the loss of rural audiences to mass media, they are reduced to begging for alms.

===Historical background of Jangam Math in [[Nepal]]===
In the 9th century, the king Narendra Dev of Lichhivi dynasty has described the Jangam Pratishthan, which is available in stone inscription in Anantlingeshwor temple, in which he has addressed the name of the Chancellor of Jangam Pratisthan and explained rights and duties performed by the Pratisthan. With this evidence we can say that Jangam community was present in [[Nepal]] before the 9th century.
The king of Karnatvansh Shri Nanya Dev became ruler of Mithila state (Northern Bihar) by expanding his dynasty in the 11th century. During the period Veerashaiva Jangam were the Rajaguru of the King Nanya Dev.  After ruling the Mithila dynasty for 240 years King Harisingh Dev Mall became the king of Nepal Mandal and established the capital at Bhaktapur City. Devi Tula Bhavani was the deity they worshiped and they started spreading the religion of veerashaivism in the region.  When Malla Vansh (dynasty) was established in Nepal Mandal [[Veerashaiva]] religion had started. The veerashaiva philosophy was being popularized by the disciples. It establishes that [[Veerashaiva]] religion section of [[Hinduism]] had its roots since the 9th century. There is a Jangam math in Bhaktapur. There is a stone inscription belonging to Nepali Year 692, which explains the role of Hari Singh Dev Mall of mallavansa, who renovated the Jangam math in Bhaktapur. With this, we can say that Veerashiava Religion was established in Nepal in the 13th century. There are many Stone writings and Tamrapatra available in jangam math in [[Nepal]].  Jangamwadi Math, Jangambari, Varanasi, [[Uttar Pradesh]]: Jangamwadi Math is the oldest Math among all the maths of Kashi, [[Kashi Vishwanath Temple]] Uttar Pradesh, India and is also known as Jnana Simhasana or Jnana Peetha. Jangam means knower of Shiva, wadi means living place. One among the five of the holiest shrines for the [[Lingayatism|Lingayath religion]].

== True Jangam ==
Jangams are factually considered as movable lingas. Jangam is considered a human linga shrine. Jangams are divided into Virakhtas or celibates, Samanyas or common Jangams, Ganachans or managers, and Mathapathis or Beadles.

Virakthas, the highest class of Jangams, dedicate themselves to celibacy. They are not allowed to celebrate marriages. They are comparatively a small body and move about the country accompanied by their disciples. The Samanya Jangam is the ordinary Jangam who had the initiation performed on him. He is a married man, who conducts marriages, begs, serves in a temple or lives by agriculture. When a Jangam goes begging, he wears a garter of bells called Jang below his right knee, and carries a cobra cane. Mathapatis or beadles and Ganachans or managers are Jangams who hold rent-free lands. They are considered rather inferior to the regular or Samanya Jangams.
 
''The two main categories of Jangam are 1) Sthira 2) Chara.'' Sthira Jangama: is a person who, staying in math (mutt) i.e., has to carry on mass education, preaching to the local people, and giving them the necessary guidance to achieve spiritual progress called   [[Jangama dhyana]], and to perform certain rites and rituals concerned with birth, marriage, death, holy communication on special occasions etc. Chara Jangama is one who constantly moves around, preaching as he goes, without settling himself at any particular place and without accumulating any [[property]] of his own.

== Demographic Distribution ==
The community is distributed throughout [[India]] and also in [[Nepal]]. However, they form a significant proportion of population in the southern states of [[India]] mainly [[Karnataka]], [[Maharashtra]], [[Telangana]], [[Andhra Pradesh]], [[Tamil Nadu]], [[Madhya Pradesh]] and [[Gujarat]].

==Ancient Jangam Tradition==
In Jangam community, the male child after the initiation (Ayyachar) will be handed over to the custody of Jangam (Guru). The child will be brought up under shelter of Jangam (in mutt/math) and by his blessings he too can become a Jangam (Guru) of any of the maths. Jangam priests live in ‘maths’ and guide their followers in Hindu religious and spiritual matters.

== Main Tenets of Jangam ==
Jangams are Hindus by religion, they follow the tenets of Veershaiva Lingayat section. They wear, Linga on their body, the Linga is always cased in a silver box called ‘Gundagi’ which is tied round the neck by a thread called ‘Shwdhar' They worship the Linga daily after taking bath, smear their forehead with ‘Vibhuti' and do not touch food without offering 'Nyvedya' to the 'Istalinga’. 

The Linga is tied to the womb in the 8th or 9th month of mother’s pregnancy for the prospective child. Linga wearing ceremony to the child is thus performed before the child takes birth. 

Three types Jangam gurus are (i) Dikshaguru (who tins the Linga) (ii) Sikshaguru (who imparts education) (iii) Mokshaguru (who is a religious guide).

Veershaiva Jangams celebrate a Hindu festivals, namely, Deepavali, Shivrathi, Ugadi, Nagarpanchmai etc. Among these festivals Shivratri is an important one. On this day all elderly people observe fast and they perform Bhajanas (Prayer) in praise of 'Lord Shiva'.

== Jangam Mythology ==
Jangam : Born out of Lord Shiva's Thigh and Religious priestly (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru): Jangam sages, who claim they originated from a part (thigh) of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva's]] body. Jangam claims that he is born out of the thigh of Shiva. [[Hindu mythology]] has it, ''Shiva wanted to give some donation to Brahma and Vishnu but when they refused he became so angry that it led to his creating the Jangam Sages.''. ''Jangam or Jangama over the generations have been able to maintain a distinct identity over generations.'' What sets them apart is their attire and the rituals that they follow. The ''Jangam sages'' go from one place to another and explain the different saints the story of the holy union of [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] and Parvati. With the Shivpuran ([[Shiva|Lord Shiva]]) on the tip of their hand, enacting the epic tale for them is nothing but a piece of cake. [[Hindu mythology]] has it, [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] had blessed them with ''immortality'' but declared that they would ''live by religious begging in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples  (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru )''. Another version is that [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] at his wedding created two recipients of his alms, one Jangam, from the sweat of his brow, the other [[Lingam]], from his thigh. These Jangams accept alms from devout. ''The jangams meanwhile suggest, they don’t earn more money, a month. They do so by religious Prayer (The chanting of mantras) begging (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) in [[Prayer in Hinduism]]''. ''At present, [[21st century|The 21st Century]], Still now they (some Jangam)  follows the [[Hindu mythology]] of Jangam ie., according to [[Hindu mythology]] [[Lord Shiva]]  had blessed them (Jangam) with immortality  (ie., entire world is destroyed by nature or some other factors to destroyed the nature, Jangam will Live) but declared that they would live by Religious Begging in [[Shiva|Lord Shiva]] temples  (by priest, religious prayer, prayer for healing, and Guru) (The Lord's Prayer) after some religious event completed by them in [[Prayer in Hinduism]].''

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar}}
The English term '''''Jew''''' originates in the [[Biblical Hebrew]] word ''Yehudi'', meaning "from the [[Kingdom of Judah]]", or "[[Jew]]". It passed into Greek as ''[[Ioudaios]]'' and Latin as ''Iudaeus'', which evolved into the [[Old French]] ''giu'' after the letter "d" was dropped. A variety of related forms are found in early English from about the year 1000, including ''Iudea'', ''Gyu'', ''Giu'', ''Iuu'', ''Iuw'', and ''Iew'', which eventually developed into the modern word.

== Etymology ==

[[File:Kingdoms of Israel and Judah map 830.svg|thumb|upright|250px|Map of the region in the 9th century BCE]]

=== ''Yehudi'' in the Hebrew Bible ===
According to the [[Book of Genesis]], [[Judah (Biblical figure)|Judah]] ({{Hebrew|יְהוּדָה}}, ''Yehudah'') was the name of the fourth son of the patriarch [[Jacob]]. During the Exodus, the name was given to the [[Tribe of Judah]], descended from the patriarch Judah. After the conquest and settlement of the land of [[Canaan]], Judah also referred to the territory allocated to the tribe. After the splitting of the [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|united Kingdom of Israel]], the name was used for the southern [[kingdom of Judah]]. The kingdom now encompassed the tribes of Judah, [[Tribe of Benjamin|Benjamin]] and [[Tribe of Simeon|Simeon]], along with some of the cities of the [[Tribe of Levi|Levites]]. With the destruction of the northern [[kingdom of Israel (Samaria)]], the kingdom of Judah became the sole Jewish state and the term ''y'hudi'' ({{Hebrew|יהודי}}) was applied to all Israelites. When the word makes its first appearance in writing (in the book of Esther) its meaning has already expanded to include converts to the Jewish religion as well as descendants of Israelites.

The term ''Yehudi'' ({{Hebrew|יְהוּדִי}}) occurs 74 times in the [[Masoretic text]] of the Hebrew Bible. The plural, ''Yehudim'' ({{Hebrew|הַיְּהוּדִים}}) first appears in {{bibleverse|2|Kings|16:6|HE}} where it refers to a defeat for the Yehudi army or nation, and in {{bibleverse|2|Chronicles|32:18|HE}}, where it refers to the language of the Yehudim ({{Hebrew|יְהוּדִית}}). {{bibleverse||Jeremiah|34:9|HE}} has the earliest singular usage of the word ''Yehudi''. In {{bibleverse||Esther|2:5-6|HE}}, the name "Yehudi" ({{Hebrew|יְהוּדִי}}) has a generic aspect, in this case referring to a man from the [[tribe of Benjamin]]:

:"There was a man a ''Yehudi'' (Jewish man) in [[Shushan]] the capital, whose name was [[Mordecai]] the son of Jair the son of [[Shimei]] the son of [[Kish (Bible)|Kish]], a [[Benjamite]]; who had been exiled from [[Jerusalem]] with the exile that was exiled with [[Jeconiah]], king of [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], which [[Nebuchadnezzar]], king of [[Babylon]], had exiled."

The name appears in the Bible as a verb in {{bibleverse||Esther|8:17|HE}} which states:

:"Many of the people of the land ''became Yehudim'' (in the generic sense) ({{Hebrew|מִתְיַהֲדִים}}, ''mityahadim'') because the fear of the Yehudim fell on them."

In some places in the [[Talmud]] the word ''Israel(ite)'' refers to somebody who is Jewish but does not necessarily practice [[Judaism]] as a [[religion]]: "An Israel(ite) even though he has sinned is still an Israel(ite)" (Tractate ''Sanhedrin'' 44a). More commonly the Talmud uses the term ''Bnei Yisrael'', i.e. "Children of Israel", ("Israel" being the name of the third patriarch [[Jacob]], father of the sons that would form the twelve tribes of Israel, which he was given and took after wrestling with an angel, see [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 32:28-29&lt;ref&gt;http://bible.ort.org/books/pentd2.asp?ACTION=displaypage&amp;BOOK=1&amp;CHAPTER=32&lt;/ref&gt;) to refer to Jews. According to the Talmud then, there is no distinction between "religious Jews" and "secular Jews."

In [[modern Hebrew]], the same word is still used to mean both Jews and Judeans ("of Judea"). In [[Arabic]] the terms are ''yahūdī'' (sg.), ''al-yahūd'' (pl.), and بَنُو اِسرَائِيل ''banū isrāʼīl''. The [[Middle Aramaic|Aramaic]] term is ''{{transl|arc|Y'hūdāi}}''.

=== Development in European languages ===
[[File:Page from Yiddish-Hebrew-Latin-German dictionary by Elijah Levita.jpg|thumb|250px|A page from [[Elia Levita]]'s [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]]-[[Hebrew language|Hebrew]]-[[Latin language|Latin]]-[[German language|German]] dictionary (16th century) contains a list of nations, including an entry for Jew: {{lang-he|יְהוּדִי}} {{lang-yi|יוּד}} {{lang-de|Jud}} {{lang-la|Iudaeus}}]]
The [[Septuagint]] (reputedly a product of [[Hellenistic Judaism|Hellenistic Jewish]] scholarship) and other Greek documents translated {{Hebrew|יְהוּדִי}}, ''Yehudi'' and the [[Middle Aramaic|Aramaic]] ''{{transl|arc|Y'hūdāi}}'' using the [[Koine Greek]] term ''[[Ioudaios]]'' ({{lang-grc-gre|[[Wiktionary:Ἰουδαῖος|Ἰουδαῖος]]}}; pl. {{lang|grc|Ἰουδαῖοι}} ''Ioudaioi''), which had lost the 'h' sound. The [[Medieval Latin|Latin]] term, following the Greek version, is ''Iudaeus'', and from these sources the term passed to other European languages. The [[Old French]] ''giu'', earlier ''juieu'', had [[elision|elided]] (dropped) the letter "d" from the Latin ''Iudaeus''. The [[Middle English]] word ''Jew'' derives from [[Old English language|Old English]] where the word is attested as early as 1000 in various forms, such as ''Iudeas'', ''Gyu'', ''Giu'', ''Iuu'', ''Iuw'', ''Iew''. The Old English name is derived from Old French. The modern [[French language|French]] term is "juif".

Most European languages have retained the letter "d" in the word for Jew. Etymological equivalents are in use in other languages, e.g.,  "Jude" in [[German language|German]], "judeu" in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]],  "jøde" in [[Danish language|Danish]] and [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]], "judío" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], "jood" in [[Dutch language|Dutch]], etc. In some languages, derivations of the word "Hebrew" are also in use to describe a Jew, e.g., ''Ebreo'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], ''Ebri/Ebrani'' ({{lang-fa|عبری/عبرانی}}) in [[Persian language|Persian]] and ''Еврей, Yevrey'' in [[Russian language|Russian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Falk|first=Avner|authorlink=Avner Falk|title=A Psychoanalytic History of the Jews|year=1996|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press|location=Madison, N.J.|isbn=0-8386-3660-8|page=131 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Jewish ethnonyms]] for a full overview.)

The German word "Jude" is pronounced {{IPA-de|ˈjuːdə|}}, the corresponding [[adjective]] "jüdisch" {{IPA-de|ˈjyːdɪʃ|}} (Jewish), and is cognate with the Yiddish word for "Jew", "Yid".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|encyclopedia=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |title=Yiddish|edition=11th|year=2004|publisher=Merriam-Webster|location=Springfield, Massachusetts|isbn=0-87779-809-5|page=1453|ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern use ==
{{further|Who is a Jew?}}
[[File:YehudObverse.jpg|thumb|left|150 px|Obverse of a Jewish silver [[Yehud coinage|Yehud]] coin from the Persian era, with falcon or eagle and Aramaic inscription '''"יהד"''' ''"Yehud"'' ([[Judea|Judaea]])]]

In [[modern English]], the term "Israelite" was used to refer to contemporary Jews as well as to Jews of antiquity until the mid-20th-century. Since the foundation of the [[State of Israel]], it has become less common to use "Israelite" of Jews in general. Instead, citizens of the state of Israel, whether Jewish or not, are called "Israeli", while "Jew" is used as an ethno-religious designation.

=== Antisemitism ===
The word ''Jew'' has been used often enough in a disparaging manner by [[Antisemitism|antisemites]] that in the late 19th and early 20th centuries it was frequently avoided altogether, and the term ''Hebrew'' was substituted instead (e.g. [[Young Men's Hebrew Association]]). Even today some people are wary of its use, and prefer to use "Jewish". Indeed, when used as an adjective (e.g. "Jew lawyer") or verb (e.g. "to jew someone"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

  | accessdate = December 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term ''Jew'' is purely pejorative. According to ''[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'', Fourth Edition (2000):
&lt;blockquote&gt;It is widely recognized that the attributive use of the noun ''Jew'', in phrases such as ''Jew lawyer'' or ''Jew ethics'', is both [[Vulgarism|vulgar]] and highly offensive. In such contexts ''Jewish'' is the only acceptable possibility. Some people, however, have become so wary of this construction that they have extended the stigma to any use of ''Jew'' as a noun, a practice that carries risks of its own. In a sentence such as ''There are now several Jews on the council'', which is unobjectionable, the substitution of a circumlocution like ''Jewish people'' or ''[[Person of Jewish ethnicity|persons of Jewish background]]'' may in itself cause offense for seeming to imply that Jew has a negative connotation when used as a noun.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/Jew |title=Jew |publisher=[[The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]] |accessdate=2012-04-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110805210424/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/jew |archivedate=2011-08-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In much the same manner, the [[Yiddish language|Yiddish]] term for ''Jew'' ({{lang|yi|איד}},{{lang|yi|ייִד}}) ''[[Yid]]'', (singular), {{lang|yi|ייִדן}} ''Yidn'' (plural)) — originally a benign term — was once used as an [[ethnic slur]], but now is often used by Jews in praise, to describe an upstanding religiously observant Jew (e.g., "He's such a ''Yid'', giving up his time like that") or to distinguish upstanding religiously observant Jews from non-observant, with the implication that the latter would be better people if they were stricter in their observance (e.g., "''Yidn'' wouldn't do such a thing").{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

'''Kanai Anzen''' (家内安全) is a type of [[omamori]], or [[Japan]]ese [[amulet]] of the [[Shinto]] religion.  Its purpose is to promote good health and to help those with illnesses. 

Literally, ''kanai anzen'' means "Please keep my family from harm," and this can be seen written upon [[Ema (Shinto)|ema]] as well as omamori [[suzu]] (bells).  In the form of an omamori and suzu, this prayer is carried on one's person.

[[File:Mathura archaeological sites.jpg|thumb|300px|The tablet was found in [[Kankali Tila]], right outside [[Mathura]].]]
The '''Kankali Tila tablet of Sodasa''', also called the '''Iryavati stone tablet''',&lt;ref name="SP"&gt;Cultural Contours of India: Dr. Satya Prakash Felicitation Volume, Vijai Shankar Śrivastava - 1981, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Amohini ayagapata''',&lt;ref&gt;Orientalia Rheno-traiectina by Hendrik Willem Obbink, Brill Archive [https://books.google.com/books?id=0t8UAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA65 p.65]&lt;/ref&gt; is a large stone slab discovered in [[Kankali Tila|Kankali]]  (area of [[Mathura]]) which mentions the rule of the [[Northern Satraps]] ruler [[Sodasa]] in Mathura.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The tablet in the [[State Museum Lucknow]] (room J.1).&lt;ref name="SP"/&gt;

==Description==
This votive tablet, which is essentially an [[ayagapata]], though not so called, represents a royal lady attended by three women and a child. The attendant women, in accordance with the ancient Indian fashion, are naked to the waist. One holds an umbrella over her mistress, whom another fans. The third holds a wreath ready for presentation. The execution is bold, and quite artistic.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; 

==Inscription==
The tablet bears a three line epigraph mentioning that in the year 42 of "Lord Mahaksatrapa Sodasa," a monument for worship was set up by a certain Amohini.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; The text is as follows : 

{{quote|
L1. Nama arahato Vardhamanasa 
2. Sv[a]misa mahakshatrapasa Sodasasa savatsare XL(?)II hemantamase II divase IX Haritiputrasa Palasa bhayaye samasavikaye 
3. Kochhiye Amohiniye saha putrehi Palaghoshena Pothaghoshena Dhanaghoshena Ayavati pratihapita praya[bha]
4. Aryavati arahatapujaye. 

"Adoration to the [[Arhat]] [[Vardhamana]]! In the year 42 of the Lord, the [[Mahakshatrapa]] [[Sodasa]], in the second month of winter, on the 9th day, an Ayavati (Aryavati) was set up by Amohini (Amohint), the Kochhi (Kautsi), a female lay-disciple of the ascetics (and) wife of Pala, son of a Hariti (Hariti or Hariti mother), together with her sons Palaghosha, Pothaghosha and Dhanaghosha .... the Aryavati (is) for the worship of the Arhat."
|Inscription of the Kankali Tila tablet of Sodasa (Translation by Buhler)&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;
}}

==Question of the date==
The inscription shows that the tablet was presented to the Jain shrine by a lady named Amohini in the year 42 or 72, in the reign of the Great Satrap Sodasa. The first numerals for the date may be read as 40, or possibly 70 (according to Buhler), so that the regnal date could be either 42 or 72  (with 72 being favoured by most).&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

According to Smith, the initial year of the era used by the great Satrap Sodasa is not known, but the inscription may be considered as dating a few years earlier than the Christian era or the 1st century.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; According to others, it is not known if the date 42/72 is a regnal year of Sodasa, or an era founded by his father or another ruler.&lt;ref&gt;From Persepolis to the Punjab, Elizabeth Errington, Vesta Sarkhosh Curtis - 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to some authors, the regnal date for Sodasa was 80 CE, so that the tablet would have been dedicated in 152 CE (50+72).&lt;ref&gt;Chhotelal Jain's Jaina Bibliography - Volume 1 - Chhotelal Jain, Satya Ranjan Banerjee - 1982, Page 809&lt;/ref&gt; A recent date for Sodasa's reign was given as 15 CE, meaning that the regnal date of the inscription would start from the [[Vikrama era]] started by [[Indo-Scythian]] king [[Azes I]] ([[Bikrami calendar]] (starting in 57 BCE)+72=15 CE).&lt;ref&gt;Image Problems: The Origin and Development of the Buddha's Image in Early South Asia Robert Daniel DeCaroli, University of Washington Press, 2015 [https://books.google.com/books?id=K8MECgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 p.205]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maitra"/&gt; This would put the long reign of his father [[Rajuvula]] in the last quarter of the 1st century BCE, which is probable.&lt;ref name="Maitra"&gt;Indian Studies, Volume 7, Ramakrishna Maitra, 1966 p.67&lt;/ref&gt; 

Another inscription of the Satrap Sodasa was found by [[Alexander Cunningham]] in the Jail mound at Mathura. His coins also are found in the neighborhood.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

A {{nihongo3|"god master"|神主|'''kannushi'''|originally pronounced ''kamunushi''}}, also called {{nihongo|'''shinshoku'''|神職|extra=meaning ''god's employee''}}, is the person responsible for the maintenance of a {{nihongo|[[Shinto]] [[shinto shrine|shrine]]|神社|''jinja''}} as well as for leading worship of a given ''[[kami]]''.&lt;ref name="IK"&gt;* ''Kannushi'' (in Japanese), Iwanami {{nihongo|[[Kōjien]]|広辞苑}} Japanese dictionary, 6th Edition (2008), DVD version&lt;/ref&gt;
The characters for ''kannushi'' are sometimes also read '''''jinshu''''' with the same meaning.

Originally the ''kannushi'' were intermediaries between ''kami'' and could transmit their will to common humans.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;  A ''kannushi'' was a man capable of miracles or a holy man who, because of his practice of [[Harae|purificatory rites]], was able to work as a medium for a [[kami]]. Later the term evolved to being synonymous with ''shinshoku'', that is, a man who works at a shrine and holds religious ceremonies there.&lt;ref name="IK"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ya"&gt;
{{cite web |last = Moriyasu |first = Jin |title = Kannushi |language = Japanese |work = Nihon Hyakka Zensho |publisher = Shogakukan |url = http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%BB/ |accessdate = 2009-10-16 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/6AfIob8e3?url=http://100.yahoo.co.jp/detail/%E7%A5%9E%E4%B8%BB/ |archivedate = 2012-09-14 |df =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ancient times, because of the overlap of political and religious power within a clan, it was the head of the clan who led the clansmen during religious functions, or else it could be another official.&lt;ref name="ya"/&gt; Later, the role evolved into a separate and more specialized form. The term appears in both the ''[[Kojiki]]'' (680 AD) and ''[[Nihon Shoki]]'' (720 AD).&lt;ref name="ya"/&gt; In them respectively, Empress Jungū and Emperor Suijin become ''kannushi''.&lt;ref name="eos"&gt;
{{cite web | title= Kannushi | last= Nishimuta | first= Takao | date= 2007-03-28 | work= Encyclopedia of Shinto | publisher= Kokugakuin | url= http://eos.kokugakuin.ac.jp/modules/xwords/entry.php?entryID=1285 | accessdate= 2009-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the same shrine, for example at [[Ise Jingū]] or [[Ōmiwa Shrine]], there can be different types of ''kannushi'' at the same time called for example {{nihongo|''Ō-kannushi''|大神主}}, {{nihongo|''Sō-kannushi''|総神主}}, or {{nihongo|''Gon-kannushi''|権神主}}.&lt;ref name="eos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ya"/&gt;

''Kannushi'' can marry and their children usually inherit their position.&lt;ref name="nishi"&gt;
{{cite book | last= Nishimura | first= Hajime | title= A Comparative History of Ideas | publisher= Motilal Banarsidass | year= 1998 | isbn= 978-81-208-1004-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Although this hereditary status is no longer legally granted, it continues in practice.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;
{{cite web| title= Shinshoku | publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica Online | url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/540847/shinshoku | accessdate= 2009-10-16}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The clothes they wear, for example the ''[[jōe]]'', the ''ebōshi'' and the ''kariginu'' (see photos), do not have any special religious significance, but are simply official garments used in the past by the Imperial court.&lt;ref name="nishi"/&gt; This detail reveals the close connection between ''kami'' worship and the figure of the Emperor.&lt;ref name="nishi"/&gt; Other implements used by ''kannushi'' include a baton called ''[[Shaku (Japanese ritual baton)|shaku]]'' and a wand decorated with white paper streamers (''[[shide (Shinto)|shide]]'') called ''[[ōnusa]]''. ''Kannushi'' are assisted in their religious or clerical work by women called ''[[miko]]''.

To become a ''kannushi'', a novice must study at a university approved by the {{Nihongo|[[Association of Shinto Shrines]]|神社本庁|Jinja Honchō}}, typically [[Tokyo]]'s [[Kokugakuin University]] or [[Ise, Mie|Ise]]'s [[Kogakkan University]], or pass an exam that will certify his qualification.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt; [[Women in Japan|Women]] can also become ''kannushi'' and widows can succeed their husbands in their job.&lt;ref name="EB"/&gt;

The '''Kansara''' or '''[[Thathera|Kasera]]''' are a [[Hindu]] [[caste]] found throughout India. They are mostly found in Gujarat and Maharashtra. Also found in Chhattisgarh, Madhya Pradesh, Jharkhand, UP and Bihar. They traditionally made utensils and bells.

==Etymology==
The '''Kansara''' or '''Kasera''' derived their name from ''kan̩su'' ({{lang-gu|કાંસુ}}, {{IPA-gu|kaɳsũ|IPA}}), [[bell metal]].&lt;ref name="guj"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gujarat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Cy_-FXW9BQC&amp;pg=PA599|year=2003|publisher=Popular Prakashan|isbn=978-81-7991-104-4|pages=599–600}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Their mythical history associates them with [[Parshurama]] (sixth [[avatar]] of [[Vishnu]]) who exterminated the [[Kshatriya]]s. It is said that the Kansaras were Kshatriyas who hid their identity by selling utensils to save their lives. Later, selling utensils became their caste occupation. This story is told in the ''[[Kalika Purana]]'', named after their deity [[Kali]].&lt;ref name="guj"/&gt;

==Caste groups==
The Kansara belongs to [[Gujarat]], India. Their associated groups live in Maharashtra such as Tambat.&lt;ref name="Bhanu2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=B. V. Bhanu |title=People of India: Maharashtra |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=BsBEgVa804IC&amp;pg=PA929 |year=2004 |publisher=Popular Prakashan |isbn=978-81-7991-101-3 |pages=929–930}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Kansara are divided into Gujarati Kansara, Maru Kansara, Sorathia Kansara, and Jamnagari Kansara,Surti Kansara, based on their native place. The Gujarati Kansara live in [[Wadhwan]], [[Surendranagar]], [[Rajkot]], [[Bhavnagar]], and [[Dhrangdhra]]. They speak the [[Kathiawar]] dialect of Gujarati.

{{redirect|Mekhala|Buddhist ''mahasiddha''|Mekhala and Kanakhala}}
[[File:Mekkala and Ramasura.png|thumb|300px|Illustrated of Mekhala and Ramasura, from a [[samut khoi]] of Thai poetry in the second half of the 19th century. now collection in [[Bavarian State Library]], [[Germany]].]]
'''Manimekhala''' ({{lang-km|មណីមេខលា}}, ''Moni Mekhala''; {{lang-th|มณีเมขลา}}, ''Mani Mekkhala'') is a goddess in the Hindu-buddhist mythology. She is regarded as a guardian of the seas; namely the [[Indian Ocean]] and the [[South China Sea]] as part of the mythology of [[Indochina]]. She was placed by Catummaharajika to protect virtuous beings from shipwreck.&lt;ref&gt;G.P. Malalasekera. Dictionary of Pali Proper Names: Pali-English. Asian Educational Services, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; She appears in several Buddhist stories including the Mahajanaka-[[Jataka]] in which she rescues Prince Mahajanaka from a shipwreck.&lt;ref name="Monius"&gt;Anne Elizabeth Monius. Imagining a place for Buddhism: literary culture and religious community in Tamil-speaking South India. Oxford University Press US, 2001, pages 111-112&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In [[Pali]], ''{{lang|pi|maņīmekhalā}}'' refers to a girdle or belt of jewels. In Indochina, she is sometimes referred to simply as Mekhala; ''Neang Mekhala'' ({{lang-km|នាងមេខលា}}) in Cambodia and ''Mekkhala'' ({{lang-th|เมขลา}}) in Thailand. Her name was contributed by Thailand for tropical cyclone names occurring as '[[Tropical Storm Mekkhala (disambiguation)|Tropical Storm Mekkhala]]' in 2002 and 2008.

==In Mainland Southeast Asia==
Manimekhala is seen in [[wat]] paintings across [[Mainland Southeast Asia]] depicting scenes from Mahajanaka.&lt;ref name="Monius" /&gt; In Thailand and Cambodia, she is considered a goddess of lightning and the seas. In the classical dance traditions of Thailand and Cambodia, sacred dramatic dances depict the goddess Manimekhala, Ramasura ([[Parashurama]]), and [[Arjuna]]; according to legend, the phenomena of [[thunder]] and [[lightning]] is produced in the clash of Manimekhala's crystal ball and Parashurama's axe. In Cambodia, these dance dramas are used in propitiation ceremonies called ''buong suong tevoda'' and were performed to invoke the rains to fall.&lt;ref&gt;Cravath, Paul. Asian Theatre Journal, Vol. 3, No. 2 (Autumn, 1986), pp. 179-203 (The Ritual Origins of the Classical Dance Drama of Cambodia) University of Hawai'i Press&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Sri Lanka==
In Sri Lanka, she is considered to be the sea goddess. In the [[Tamil language|Tamil]] epic poem, the [[Manimekalai]], she puts the eponymous herioine to sleep and takes her to the island Maṇipallavam ([[Nainatheevu]]). In the mythic cycle of the god Devol, when the latter approaches Sri Lanka and his ship founders, it is Manimekhalai, on the instructions of the god [[Śakra (Buddhism)|Śakra]], who conjures up a stone boat to save him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23149">In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], '''marriage''' between a man and a woman is considered to be "ordained of God".&lt;ref name= "Family Proclamation" &gt;{{citation |author= [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]] and [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Council of the Twelve Apostles]] |date= September 23, 1995 |contribution= The Family: A Proclamation to the World |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/family-proclamation |title= Gospel Topics |publisher= LDS Church |accessdate= 2013-12-11 }}. See also: "[[The Family: A Proclamation to the World]]".&lt;/ref&gt; Marriage is thought to consist of a [[covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] between the man, the woman, and God. The church teaches that in addition to civil marriage, which ends at death, a man and woman can undergo a [[celestial marriage]] in a [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] performed by [[priesthood (LDS Church)|priesthood]] authority, whereby the marriage and parent–child relationships resulting from the marriage will last forever in the [[afterlife]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/temples |contribution= Temples |title= Gospel Topics |publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1852 until 1890, the LDS Church openly authorized [[plural marriage|polygamous marriages]] between one man and multiple wives, though polygamous families continued cohabitating into the 1940s and 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Embry|first1=Jessie L.|title=The History of Polygamy|url=https://heritage.utah.gov/history/uhg-history-polygamy-2|website=heritage.utah.gov|publisher=Utah State Historical Society|year=1994|quote=Those involved in plural marriages after 1904 were excommunicated; and those married between 1890 and 1904 were not to have church callings where other members would have to sustain them. Although the Mormon church officially prohibited new plural marriages after 1904, many plural husbands and wives continued to cohabit until their deaths in the 1940s and 1950s.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leaders of the church secretly practiced and taught plural marriage from about 1831 to 1852.&lt;/ref&gt; Today, the church is opposed to such marriages and excommunicates members who participate in them or publicly teach that they are sanctioned by God. The LDS Church also opposes the legalization of same-sex marriage.&lt;ref&gt;Fred Karger, [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/nov/29/mormon-church-gay-marriage-lobbying "The Mormon church won't drop its opposition to gay marriage"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 2013-11-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings about marriage in general==
A spouse is the only person other than the Lord that Latter-day Saints are commanded to love "with all [their] heart". A [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] in the [[Doctrine and Covenants]] states: "Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shalt cleave unto her and none else."&lt;ref name=DC42&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|42|22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Church leaders have taught that this commandment applies equally to wives loving their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;[[Spencer W. Kimball]], [http://www.lds.org/liahona/1978/06/oneness-in-marriage "Oneness in Marriage"], ''[[Tambuli]]'', June 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Marlin K. Jensen]], [http://www.lds.org/ensign/1994/10/a-union-of-love-and-understanding "A Union of Love and Understanding"], ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' October 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church also teaches that marriage is a partnership of equals, and that partners should be thoughtful, respectful, and loyal to one another.&lt;ref name = website&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/marriage |contribution= Marriage |title= Gospel Topics |publisher= LDS Church |quote= Marriage is a partnership of equals, with neither person exercising dominion over the other, but with each encouraging, comforting, and helping the other .... it needs and deserves time over less-important commitments. Couples can strengthen their marriage as they take time to talk together and to listen to one another, to be thoughtful and respectful, and to express tender feelings and affection often... Marriage partners must be loyal to one another and faithful in their marriage covenants in thought, word, and deed. Married couples should stay away from anything that could lead to unfaithfulness in any way. Pornography, unwholesome fantasies, and flirtations will erode character and strike at the foundation of marriage. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The church teaches that if couples keep their lives centered on Jesus Christ, their love will grow.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://www.lds.org/topics/marriage |contribution= Marriage |title= Gospel Topics |publisher= LDS Church |quote= Couples must center their lives in the gospel of Jesus Christ. As couples help one another keep the covenants they have made, attend church and the temple together, study the scriptures together, and kneel together in prayer, God will guide them. Their companionship will sweeten through the years; their love will strengthen. Their appreciation for one another will grow. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding marriage and divorce, the church instructs its leaders: "No priesthood officer is to counsel a person whom to marry. Nor should he counsel a person to divorce his or her spouse. Those decisions must originate and remain with the individual. When a marriage ends in divorce, or if a husband and wife separate, they should always receive counseling from Church leaders."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 7.2.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings about celestial marriage==
{{main|Celestial marriage}}
[[celestial marriage|Celestial (or eternal) marriage]] is an [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] performed by [[priesthood (Mormonism)|priesthood]] authority in a [[Temple (LDS Church)|temple]] of the church.&lt;ref name = marriagegp/&gt; A celestial marriage is thought to continue forever into the [[afterlife]] if the man and woman do not break their covenants.&lt;ref name = marriagegp&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-38-eternal-marriage "Chapter 38: Eternal Marriage"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, eternally married couples are often referred to as being "[[Sealing (Latter Day Saints)|sealed]]" to each other. Sealed couples who keep their covenants are also promised to have their posterity sealed to them in the afterlife.&lt;ref name = marriagegp/&gt;

===Celestial marriage as a requirement for exaltation===
The LDS Church teaches that a [[celestial marriage]] is required for [[exaltation (Latter Day Saints)|exaltation]].&lt;ref name = marriagegp/&gt; This teaching is based on Mormon [[standard works|scripture]], in which [[Joseph Smith]] taught, “In the celestial glory there are three heavens or degrees; and in order to obtain the highest, a man must enter into this order of the priesthood [meaning the new and everlasting covenant of marriage]; and if he does not, he cannot obtain it. He may enter into the other, but that is the end of his kingdom; he cannot have an increase”.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Doctrine and Covenants|dc|131|1|4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exaltation is also known as "eternal life" and is defined as "the kind of life God lives".&lt;ref name = exaltationgp&gt;[http://www.lds.org/manual/gospel-principles/chapter-47-exaltation "Chapter 47: Exaltation"], ''[[Gospel Principles]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Those who are exalted will "live eternally in the presence of Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ[;] will become gods[;] will be united eternally with their righteous family members and will be able to have eternal increase [spirit children][; and] will have everything that our Heavenly Father and Jesus Christ have—all power, glory, dominion, and knowledge".&lt;ref name = exaltationgp/&gt; Members of the LDS Church are encouraged to prepare to be celestially married in a temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Bushman |first= Richard L. |authorlink= Richard L. Bushman |year= 2008 |title= Mormonism: a Very Short Introduction |location= New York |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |isbn= 9780195310306 |oclc= 179802646 |pages= 58–59 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed, therefore, that all humans are spirit children of "heavenly parents"&lt;ref name= "Family Proclamation"/&gt; who as mortals were celestially married and went on to become exalted. This married couple is known to Latter-day Saints as [[God the Father]] and [[Heavenly Mother (Mormonism)|Heavenly Mother]]. Because of the beliefs that (1) celestial marriage is required for exaltation, and (2) that Jesus is exalted, some leaders of the LDS Church have hypothesized that [[Jesus]] must have been married, possibly to [[Mary Magdalene]], [[Mary, sister of Lazarus]], and/or [[Martha]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last1=Hyde| first1=Orson | authorlink=Orson Hyde| contribution=The Marriage Relations| date=October 6, 1854| title=[[Journal of Discourses]]| editor1-last=Watt | editor1-first=G.D.| editor1-link=George D.

Smith]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Joseph Fielding Smith]], [http://www.mrm.org/files/images/was-jesus-married-letter.jpg Handwritten note responding to letter from J. Ricks Smith], 1963.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it is a requirement for exaltation, celestial marriages are performed vicariously in church temples for deceased couples who were legally married.

==Civil marriage and divorce and its relationship to celestial marriage==
In some legal jurisdictions, celestial marriages can be recognized as civil marriages; in other cases, couples are civilly married outside of the temple and are later sealed in a celestial marriage.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Handbook (LDS Church)|Handbook 1: Stake Presidents and Bishops]]'' (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church, 2010) § 3.5.&lt;/ref&gt; The church will no longer perform a celestial marriage on a couple unless they are first (or simultaneously) legally married.

A celestial marriage is not annulled by a civil divorce: a "cancellation of a sealing" may be granted, but only by the [[First Presidency (LDS Church)|First Presidency]], the highest authority in the church. Civil divorce and marriage outside the temple carry with them a stigma in Mormon culture; the church teaches that the "gospel of Jesus Christ—including repentance, forgiveness, integrity, and love—provides the remedy for conflict in marriage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/topics/divorce "Gospel Topics: Divorce"], lds.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Polygamy==
{{main|Mormonism and polygamy}}
Until 1890, the LDS Church openly sanctioned [[plural marriage]], which was the practice of marrying a man celestially to multiple women. Such polygamous marriages were celestial marriages only, not legal civil marriages. Today, the church is opposed to such marriages and excommunicates members who participate in them, whether or not polygamy is legal in the jurisdiction in question. The church teaches that “the standard doctrine of the church is monogamy" and that polygamy was a temporary exception to the rule.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/polygamy-latter-day-saints-and-the-practice-of-plural-marriage "Polygamy: Latter-day Saints and the Practice of Plural Marriage"], LDS Newsroom, mormonnewsroom.org.&lt;/ref&gt; Early church leaders taught that God the Father and Jesus Christ both practiced polygamy in defense of the practice, a belief widely accepted among Mormons by the late-1850s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Swanson|first1=Vern G.|title=Dynasty of the Holy Grail: Mormonism's Holy Bloodline|date=2013|publisher=Cedar Fort, Inc.|location=Springville, UT|isbn=9781462104048|chapter=Christ and Polygamy|page=247–259|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rss1CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT251&amp;lpg=PT251&amp;f=false#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Dr. William E. Phipps noted that the belief that 'Jesus married, and married often!' was used to encourage and promote the doctrine of polygamy amongst timid Latter-Day Saints ... By the late-1850s the idea that more than one woman was married to Jesus was widely accepted among Mormon circles. ... As if the concept of Christ's polygamy was not unsettling enough, Mormonism even taught in the nineteenth century that God the Father had a plurality of wives as well.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dana|first1=Bruce E.|title=The Eternal Father and His Son|date=September 2004|page=62|publisher=Cedar Fort Inc.|isbn=1555177883|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-z8NVySmnmcC&amp;ots=zbVT_DkTjy&amp;pg=PA62#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=9 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schelling Durham|first1=Michael|title=Desert Between the Mountains: Mormons, Miners, Padres, Mountain Men, and the Opening of the Great Basin, 1772-1869|date=1997|publisher=Henry Holt &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York City|page=182|edition=1st|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=df57AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA182#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|quote=Pratt clearly loud out arguments in favor of polygamy that the Saints would use for years to come. ...

==Interracial marriage==
{{Main article|Interracial marriage and The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints}}
In the past, LDS Church leaders have consistently opposed marriage between different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] with the apostle [[Boyd K. Packer|Boyd Packer]] publicly stating in 1977 that "We've always counseled in the Church for ... our Caucasians to marry Caucasians .... The counsel has been wise."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Packer|first1=Boyd|title=Follow the Rule|url=https://speeches.byu.edu/talks/boyd-k-packer_follow-rule/|website=byu.edu|publisher=LDS Church|accessdate=26 August 2017|quote=We’ve always counseled in the Church for our Mexican members to marry Mexicans, our Japanese members to marry Japanese, our Caucasians to marry Caucasians, our Polynesian members to marry Polynesians. The counsel has been wise. ... You might even say, “I can show you local Church leaders or perhaps even general leaders who have married out of their race.” I say, “Yes—exceptions.” Then I would remind you of that Relief Society woman’s near-scriptural statement, “We’d like to follow the rule first, and then we’ll take care of the exceptions.”}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly every decade beginning with the church's formation until the '70s has seen some denunciation against miscegenation, with most focusing on black-white marriage. These church leaders' views stem from racist "biological and social" principles.&lt;ref name="Neither White Nor Black" &gt;{{cite book |editor-last= Bush |editor-first= Lester E., Jr. |editor2-last= Mauss |editor2-first= Armand L. |editor2-link= Armand L.

Church publications have also contained statements discouraging interracial marriage.

In 2003 author [[Jon Krakauer|Jon Krakauer's]] stated that "official LDS policy has continued to strongly admonish white saints not to marry blacks" in his "[[Under the Banner of Heaven]]". In response the church newsroom released a statement from BYU Dean of Religious Education [[Robert L. Millet|Robert Millet]] that "There is, in fact, no mention whatsoever in [the church] [[Handbook (LDS Church)|handbook]] concerning interracial marriages. In addition, having served as a Church leader for almost 30 years, I can also certify that I have never received official verbal instructions condemning marriages between black and white members."&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Millet, [http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/church-response-to-jon-krakauers-under-the-banner-of-heaven "Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven"], June 27, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Though, denying any condemnation of interracial marriage, there was no comment on whether it was still discouraged, however.

The discouragement of marriage between those of different ethnicities by church leaders continued being taught to youth during Sunday meetings until 2013 when the use of the 1996 version of the church Sunday meeting manual for adolescent boys was discontinued. The manual had used a 1976 quote from past church president [[Spencer W. Kimball|Spencer Kimball]] that said, "We recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally".&lt;ref name="Black Saints"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Embry|first1=Jessie L.|title=Black Saints in a White Church|date=1994|publisher=Signature Books|isbn=1-56085-044-2|url=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/social-acceptance/|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|169}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Lesson 31: Choosing an Eternal Companion |url=//www.lds.org/manual/aaronic-priesthood-manual-3/lesson-31-choosing-an-eternal-companion |work=Aaronic Priesthood Manual 3 |publisher=LDS Church |year=1995 |pages=127–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quote is still in use, however, in the 2003 institute Eternal Marriage Student Manual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Eternal Marriage Student Manual|url=https://www.lds.org/manual/eternal-marriage-student-manual/marriage-for-eternity?lang=eng|quote=We recommend that people marry those who are of the same racial background generally, and of somewhat the same economic and social and educational background (some of those are not an absolute necessity, but preferred), and above all, the same religious background, without question|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage statistics for Latter-day Saints==

In 2008 the [[American Religious Identification Survey]] reported: "Mormons have the highest proportions of currently married adults, and lowest divorce rates reflecting the emphasis on family values in this tradition .... Commitment to 'traditional or normative family values' is measured by creating a combined index of the proportions divorced and cohabiting, whereby those traditions that score lowest are the most familial. The tradition with the lowest percentages on this index are Mormons (11%)".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url= http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/ARIS_Report_2008.pdf |page= 13 |title= American Religious Identification Survey 2008: Summary Report |date=March 2009 |first= Barry A. |last= Kosmin |first2= Ariela |last2= Keysar |publisher= [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College (Hartford, Connecticut)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maate Mahadevi''' B.Sc., M.A. (born 13 March 1946) is a scholar, mystic, and writer, and the first female ''Jagadguru'', or spiritual head of a South Indian [[Lingayat]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Werner, Karel |title=The Yogi and the mystic: studies in Indian and comparative mysticism |publisher=Curzon |location=Surrey |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-7007-0272-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p7J-Gy7PSSEC&amp;q=Mate+Mahadevi#v=snippet&amp;q=Mate%20Mahadevi&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=July–December 2009|title=The Contemporary Hindu Women of India: An Overview|journal=South Asian Studies: A Research Journal of South Asian Studies|volume=24|issue=2|pages=242–249|url=http://pu.edu.pk/csas/journal/PDF/5-Dr.%20Tahira.pdf|author=Tahira Basharat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following initiation in 1965 by Lingananda Swami, Maate Mahadevi began writing ''[[vachanas]]'', a form of didactic poetry. In 1966 she received her [[Jangama]] initiation as an [[ascetic]] in the Lingayat order of wandering mendicants. In 1970 she was installed as a ''jagadguru'' in the Lingayat community, the first time a woman had been placed in that position. She holds the 12th century woman poet [[Akka Mahadevi]], who also wrote ''vachanas'', as her role model.&lt;ref name="Sharma"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sharma, Arvind| author2=Young, Katherine K. |title=Feminism and World Religions |publisher=SUNY Press |location=New York |year=1999 |pages=45–46 |isbn=0-7914-4024-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Fkay_WoTdHcC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lingayathism.net/html/modules/cjaycontent/index.php?id=83 Lingayathism website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100809153539/http://www.lingayathism.net/html/modules/cjaycontent/index.php?id=83 |date=2010-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1983 she had published twenty books and started an educational and religious institution called Jaganmata Akka Mahadevi Ashrama in [[Dharwad]], [[Karnataka]], whose focus is education and spiritual upliftment of girls and women. Among her many books is ''Basava Tatva Darshana'', on the life and teachings of [[Basava]], a 12th-century social reformer and philosopher who fought against the caste system.&lt;ref name="Sharma" /&gt;

'''N. D. Cocea''' (common rendition of '''Nicolae Dumitru Cocea''', {{IPA-ro|nikoˈla.e duˈmitru ˈkot͡ʃe̯a}}, also known as '''Niculae''', '''Niculici''' or '''Nicu Cocea'''; November 29, 1880 – February 1, 1949) was a Romanian journalist, novelist, critic and [[left-wing]] political activist, known as a major but controversial figure in the field of political [[satire]]. The founder of many newspapers and magazines, including ''[[Viața Socială]]'', ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'', ''[[Facla]]'' and ''[[Chemarea]]'', collaborating with writer friends such as [[Tudor Arghezi]], [[Gala Galaction]] and [[Ion Vinea]], he fostered and directed the development of early [[modernist literature]] in Romania. Cocea later made his name as a [[Republicanism|republican]] and [[Anticlericalism|anticlerical]] agitator, was arrested as an instigator during the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|1907 peasant revolt]], and played a leading role in regrouping the scattered [[Socialism|socialist]] clubs. His allegiances however switched between parties: during [[World War I]], he supported the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] and, as a personal witness of the [[October Revolution]], the government of [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], before returning home as a [[Communism|communist]].

During the [[interwar period]], Cocea was elected to [[Parliament of Romania|Romanian Parliament]] as an independent socialist, campaigned for the outlawed [[Romanian Communist Party]], and found his press banned by the authorities on several occasions. In 1923, he was found guilty of ''[[lèse majesté]]''. Cocea, although kept under constant surveillance, was rumored to have been an opportunistic double dealer, and his personal life was a matter of public scandal. His novels, the vast majority of which are samples of [[erotic literature]], fueled innuendo about his sexual exploits, which also resulted in his sentencing for [[statutory rape]]. After [[World War II]], Cocea was again close to the Communist Party and, from 1948, rose to prominence as an official writer for the [[Communist Romania|communist regime]].

For a while the son-in-law of journalist [[Constantin Mille]], N. D. Cocea was from a theatrical family: his daughters [[Dina Cocea|Dina]] and [[Tantzi Cocea|Tantzi]], like his sister [[Alice Cocéa|Alice]] before them, were acclaimed actresses. Another daughter, [[Ioana-Maria Cocea]], is a noted sculptor.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Born in [[Bârlad]], Cocea claimed lineage from the lesser [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyar]] aristocracy of [[Moldavia]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Camboulives, p.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msraristocratia"&gt;Mihai Sorin Rădulescu, "Despre aristocrația românească în timpul regimului comunist", in [[Lucian Boia]] (ed.), ''Miturile comunismului românesc'', [[Editura Nemira]], Bucharest, 1998, p.352.  {{ISBN|973-569-209-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stamoral1"&gt;[[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/136/art11-arhiva.html "N.D. Cocea, un boier amoral/N.D. Cocea, an Immoral Boyar" (I)], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 136&lt;/ref&gt; His father, Dumitru Cocea, was a [[Romanian Land Forces]] officer, who would reach the rank of General.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mdsalice"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Dim. Sturdza]], [http://www.revista22.ro/alice-cocea-9653.html "Alice Cocea"], in ''[[Revista 22]]'', Nr. 1087, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Simina Stan, [http://www.jurnalul.ro/special/special/scandalurile-familiei-cocea-567192.html "Scandalurile familiei Cocea"], in ''[[Jurnalul Național]]'', February 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.18&lt;/ref&gt; The Coceas descended from an 18th-century [[Albanians of Romania|Albanian Moldavian]] ''[[Serdar (Ottoman rank)|Serdar]]'' Gheorghe Cocea,&lt;ref name="gc919"&gt;Călinescu, p.919&lt;/ref&gt; but claimed lineage from a 16th-century soldier in the armies of [[Michael the Brave]].&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; Nicolae's mother, Cleopatra, was a published author and a journalist.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; She hailed from a family of [[yeomen]] (''răzeși'')&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; or landowners, and her artistic education helped shape his cultural tastes from early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.18&lt;/ref&gt; Although he made his name as a writer and journalist, his most ardent wish was to become an actor.&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt;

Nicolae attended primary school in his native town, and had a hectic adolescence, determined by his father's successive postings.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; He is known to have first been enlisted at the National High School of [[Iași]].&lt;ref name="cp-c220"&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p.220&lt;/ref&gt; During the late 1890s, young Cocea was in [[Bucharest]], attending the [[Saint Sava National College]], becoming close friends with two other students and future writers: one was Galaction, the other was [[Vasile Demetrius]]. Another Saint Sava student, [[Ion G. Duca]] (the [[Prime Minister of Romania]] in 1933), was occasionally present among them, but political differences drew them apart with time.&lt;ref name="zogalaction"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], [http://www.romlit.ro/ediia_galaction "Ediția Galaction"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 47/2001&lt;/ref&gt; Despite oral tradition, Arghezi, who joined the Cocea group around the same time, may not have been a Saint Sava student at all: according to literary historian C. Popescu-Cadem, there is no record of him ever attending that institution.&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p.219-222&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's own education was vague. He flunked out after the 3rd and 7th grades, was transferred to [[Ploiești]], then returned to Saint Sava only to pass reexamination.&lt;ref name="cp-c220"/&gt;

Cocea and his Saint Sava friends were already leftists who attended the public lectures of senior [[Socialism|socialist]] leader [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]].&lt;ref name="tv280"&gt;Vianu, p.280&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Tudor Vianu]], the four youths, including the "restless, daring and ingenious" Cocea, were mounting an independent protest against "[[bourgeois]]" values.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.279-280&lt;/ref&gt; They literary taste favored [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]], [[Parnassianism]] and [[literary naturalism]], which they saw as modern shields against traditionalist culture.&lt;ref name="tv280"/&gt; Inspired by the works of [[Charles Baudelaire]],&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.280-281; Pastia, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; they soon joined efforts with the [[Symbolist movement in Romania|Romanian Symbolist movement]]. All members of the group visited with the Symbolist doyen [[Alexandru Macedonski]],&lt;ref name="tv280"/&gt; although Cocea the writer was first discovered by Symbolist academic [[Ovid Densusianu]] and his ''[[Vieața Nouă]]'' review.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.194&lt;/ref&gt;

As his personal note, Cocea rebelled against paternal and institutional authority. Under the pen name ''Nely'', he published the defiantly erotic novel ''Poet-Poetă'' (1898, with a preface by Galaction), that resulted in his near-definitive expulsion from public high school.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.18. See also Călinescu, p.919, 1026&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, Galaction married Cocea's cousin Zoe Marcou, a laicized [[Romanian Orthodox Church|Romanian Orthodox]] nun; she would inspire him to become an Orthodox priest.&lt;ref name="zogalaction"/&gt;

Around 1900, Cocea, who had already graduated in Romanian Law,&lt;ref name="stamoral2"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/137/art11-arhiva.html "N.D. Cocea, un boier amoral" (II)], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 137&lt;/ref&gt; was in France, undergoing specialization at the [[University of Paris]]. At this stage in life, he was probably acquainted with the French roots of Romanian [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|radical liberalism]], which infused his left-wing outlook.&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p.183; Mitchievici, p.127. See also Călinescu, p.919&lt;/ref&gt; A sympathizer of the [[Dreyfus affair|Dreyfusards]], he was also becoming interested in the various projects to transform the [[Kingdom of Romania]] into a republic,&lt;ref name="bc184"&gt;Camboulives, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; in marked contrast to his father's ardent [[monarchism]].&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; He witnessed first-hand the progress of [[trade union]]ism in France, and had personal interviews with writer [[Anatole France]] and sculptor [[Auguste Rodin]].&lt;ref name="pc29"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.29&lt;/ref&gt; The family's French connections were preserved by the writer's siblings. Cocea's sister [[Alice Cocéa|Alice]], the future comedian, was born in [[Sinaia]], where Dumitru Cocea was stationed in 1899, and also settled in France at a later date.&lt;ref name="mdsalice"/&gt; She was joined there by Cocea's younger sister, Florica.&lt;ref name="mdsalice"/&gt;

Upon his return to Romania, Cocea was for a while employed as [[justice of the peace]],&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p.183-184&lt;/ref&gt; but was later virtually inactive as a lawyer.&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; Instead, he began frequenting the Romanian socialist milieu. He was at the time married to Florica Mille, daughter of [[Constantin Mille]]. Her father was founder of ''[[Adevărul]]'' daily and co-founder of the [[Romanian Social-Democratic Workers' Party|Social-Democratic Workers' Party]] (PSDMR). This was another break with the Cocea family tradition: allegedly, General Dumitru Cocea had once ordered his troops to devastate the ''Adevărul'' offices.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Florica was born from Mille's first marriage, which ended in divorce, and had a sister, Margareta, married into the Messerschmitt family of German industrialists.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.549, 919&lt;/ref&gt; Through Mille, Cocea became related to another Moldavian boyar family, the Tăutus.&lt;ref name="msraristocratia"/&gt; Cocea's marriage, which resulted in the 1912 birth of [[Dina Cocea]], was troubled and ended in divorce.&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt;

===Socialist clubs and 1907 revolt===
Like some of the veteran socialists ([[Garabet Ibrăileanu]], [[Henric Sanielevici]], the ''[[România Muncitoare]]'' group), the young journalist made repeated attempts to revive and reunite the socialist clubs, left in disarray by the 1899 dissolution of the PSDMR.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.29, 133-134, 140. See also Cioroianu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea, with Arghezi, Demetrius and Galaction, stood out for marrying this political ideal with the artistic credo of Symbolism. This unusual vision was preserved in the magazine the three published together during 1904, ''Linia Dreaptă'' ("The Straight Line").&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.29. See also Călinescu, p.678, 682, 808; Vianu, p.478&lt;/ref&gt; In 1905, Arghezi left for Switzerland and entrusted Cocea with his collection of rare books. Cocea is said to have lost it, an event which marked the first of several disagreements between them.&lt;ref&gt;Anghel, p.45&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[1907 Romanian Peasants' Revolt|March 1907 peasant uprising]], N. D. Cocea's profile in political journalism was boosted. He is the probable source of a much circulated canard, taken up by ''Adevărul'', according to which Romanian authorities had killed 11,000 or more peasant insurgents.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cm1907"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cătălin Mihuleac]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/MIHULEACapr7.html " '1907' și '1989' - două mari manipulări prin presă"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea himself eventually settled for a death toll of 12,000, claiming that, "had the peasants' bodies been lined up and down on [[Calea Victoriei]]", [[King of Romania|Romanian King]] [[Carol I of Romania|Carol I of Hohenzollern]] could have walked over to [[Dealul Mitropoliei]] "on a soft rug of peasant flesh".&lt;ref name="cm1907"/&gt;

During the actual events, N. D. Cocea was mainly active on the lower course of the [[Danube]], recognized by other socialists as "one of the leaders of the [workers'] movement" in [[Brăila]].&lt;ref name="ctp184"&gt;Petrescu, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; His regional daily, ''Dezrobirea'' ("The Emancipation"), was probably paid for by a local banker, Alphonse (or Alfons) Nachtigal.&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; Drawing official suspicion as a republican paper,&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; it became noted for fueling revolt regionally. After the ''România Muncitoare'' circle organized a socialist rally in Brăila, ''Dezrobirea''{{'}}s entire staff was arrested on orders from Prefect [[Nicolae T. Faranga]], who also confiscated most of the printed issues (although some 1,000 were still freely distributed among the intrigued peasants).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.obiectivbr.ro/component/content/article/58-arhiva/11239-Braila%20fierbea%20inca%20din%201899.html "Brăila fierbea încă din 1899"], in ''[[Obiectiv-Vocea Brăilei]]'', March 20, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea was eventually tried as an instigator, and sentenced to a term in prison.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, p.29; Mitchievici, p.127; Petrescu, p.201&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his release, Cocea moved back to Bucharest, where he became a socialist orator, a ''România Muncitoare'' editor, and a correspondent of the workers' journal ''Viitorul Social''.&lt;ref name="ctp184"/&gt; He was one of the Romanian delegates to the [[International Socialist Congress, Stuttgart 1907|International Socialist Congress]], hosted by the [[Second International]] in [[Stuttgart]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Camboulives, p.184; Petrescu, p.202-203, 215, 411-412&lt;/ref&gt; It was there that Russian socialist opinion leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] publicized a thesis according to which the Romanian revolt and the [[Russian Revolution of 1905]] were similar, in both character and impact.&lt;ref name="cm1907"/&gt; Back in Romania, Cocea was resuming his contacts with Dobrogeanu-Gherea, who was by then all but withdrawn from active socialist politics. As Cocea later wrote, the veteran leader confessed to him that he was being brought down by acute [[insomnia]].&lt;ref&gt;I. Felea, "Gherea și alții despre Gherea", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', December 1971, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

The young activist was blending his socialism with a critic's interest in [[modern art]] and [[experimental literature]]. Literary historian [[Paul Cernat]] argues that, like Symbolist poet [[N. Davidescu]], Cocea spent the 1900-1920 period disseminating [[modernist literature]] "on all fronts".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.22&lt;/ref&gt; He made his name as an art critic by 1908, when, like Arghezi, he defended the Romanian [[Post-Impressionism|post-Impressionist]] art club, whose members were being marginalized by the ''[[Tinerimea Artistică]]'' society; he also saluted [[Iosif Iser]]'s international post-Impressionist exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.46-47&lt;/ref&gt; Within a series of articles in ''Pagini Libere'' journal, Cocea also explained his divorce with Symbolism and [[Art Nouveau]], concluding that they represented "the cosmopolitan class of sloth and of universal [[parasitism (social offense)|parasitism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.100-101&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, Cocea was assigned the art column of ''[[Noua Revistă Română]]'', an eclectic journal put out by Romanian thinker [[Constantin Rădulescu-Motru]]. While there, he militated in favor of modernized art, urging artists to destroy "antiquated artistic formulas" and to subvert "the laws of nature".&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Viața Socială''===
According to Cocea's future friend and foe [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], 1910 was the time year Cocea, with [[Christian Rakovsky]], [[Ecaterina Arbore]], [[I. C. Frimu]] and [[Ilie Moscovici]], was in the "chief of staff" of the newly created [[Social Democratic Party of Romania (1910-1918)|Social Democratic Party of Romania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Specializat/2003-06-14/Social-democratia+romaneasca+fata+in+fata+cu+traditiile+ei "Social-democrația românească față în față cu tradițiile ei"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', June 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea was additionally a member of the party's Social Studies Circle, furnishing its library and organizing its Kalinderu Church offices.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p.218-219&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1910, Cocea and Arghezi set up a new periodical, ''[[Viața Socială]]''. The magazine, which received contributions from Dobrogeanu-Gherea, militated for [[universal suffrage]], [[social equality]] and [[Land reform in Romania|land reform]], while informing readers about world socialism.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.479&lt;/ref&gt; It enlisted collaborations from a number of [[anti-establishment]] journalists, from [[Agrarianism|agrarian]] militant [[Vasile Kogălniceanu]] and socialist physician [[Tatiana Grigorovici]] to writers [[Ion Minulescu]], [[Lucia Demetrius]] or [[Constantin Graur]], and republished contributions from some of Europe's known social critics: [[Eduard Bernstein]], [[Rinaldo Rigola]], [[Vsevolod Garshin]], [[Leo Tolstoy]], [[Jean Jaurès]], [[Emile Vandervelde]], [[Hubert Lagardelle]]&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; and [[Gustave Hervé]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.99&lt;/ref&gt; Other contributors were Arbore, Davidescu, V. Demetrius, [[Traian Demetrescu]], [[Sofia Nădejde]], [[Vasile Savel]] and [[Avram Steuerman-Rodion]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.99, 126-127, 432&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally, this moment saw Cocea and his friends coordinating the transition from Symbolism to the early 20th-century avant-garde.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.23, 29-32&lt;/ref&gt; This move was also accelerated by art critic [[Theodor Cornel]], who was for while a staff writer for Cocea's publication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Dan Grigorescu]], ''Istoria unei generații pierdute: expresioniștii'', [[Editura Eminescu]], Bucharest, 1980, p.430. {{OCLC|7463753}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his first ''Viața Socială'' editorial, Cocea himself deemed Arghezi "the most revolutionary poet" of the period.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.30; Michael H. Impey, "A Polemical Interpretation of Tudor Arghezi's 'Testament' ", in [[Keith Hitchins]] (ed.), ''Rumanian Studies. Vol. IV: 1976-1979'', [[Brill Publishers]], Leiden, 1979, p.196.  {{ISBN|90-04-06003-0}}. See also Vianu, p.479-480&lt;/ref&gt; However, his unilateral decision to publish Arghezi's "Evening Prayer", as an example of poetic rebellion,&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.479-480&lt;/ref&gt; greatly enraged the expatriated author.&lt;ref&gt;Anghel, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; They resumed their friendship only after Arghezi returned from his Swiss sojourn, and Cocea, with Galaction, [[Dumitru Karnabatt]] and various others, frequented the salon formed in Arghezi's Bucharest home.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vasile Man, [http://www.revista-studii-uvvg.ro/files/revista_V_2.pdf "Repere argheziene"], in the [[Vasile Goldiș West University of Arad]] ''Studii de Știință și Cultură'', Nr. 2 (17), June 2009, p.67&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea was also witness when Arghezi wedded his long-term lover, Constanța Zissu (December 1912); the register describes him as "a journalist by profession, living at Polonă Street, 1."&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p.226-227&lt;/ref&gt;

Through Galaction's interventions, ''Viața Socială'' maintained links with the more mainstream and home-grown current on Romania's leftist scene, [[Poporanism]], as well as with the post-socialist magazine of Iași, ''[[Viața Românească]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.8, 30, 34. See also Călinescu, p.678&lt;/ref&gt; It also published several poems by the young Poporanist [[George Topîrceanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.99; [[Al. Săndulescu]], chronological table and notes to [[George Topîrceanu]], ''Scrieri'', Vols. I, [[Editura Minerva]], Bucharest, 1983, p.XX, 307-308. {{OCLC|10998949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in Iași, the ''Viața Socială'' circle acquired a number of young disciples, involved in editing ''Fronda'' and ''Absolutio'' magazines: [[Isac Ludo]], [[Eugen Relgis]] etc.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.55-57&lt;/ref&gt;

Still, traditionalist critic [[Ilarie Chendi]] notes, ''Viața Socială'' as a whole failed, because the Symbolist and post-Symbolist contributors were not ardent socialists, and because no "notable poets or prose writers" could be found among the socialists.&lt;ref name="icvieata"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ilarie Chendi]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/luceafarul/1912/BCUCLUJ_FP_280091_1912_011_003.pdf "Vieața literară în 1911 (o privire generală)"], in ''[[Luceafărul (magazine)|Luceafărul]]'', Nr. 3/1912, p.63 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The same was observed in 1913 by critic Gheorghe Savul, who suggested that ''Viața Socială'' took on Symbolists such as Davidescu for opportunistic reasons, since they also had an anti-bourgeois axe to grind, but that there was little else to unite its contributors.&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.126-127&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocea was by then frequenting the [[Anarchism|anarchist]] boyar [[Alexandru Bogdan-Pitești]], an art patron, cultural innovator and personal friend of Arghezi.&lt;ref name="pc39"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.39&lt;/ref&gt; In 1911, he visited Italy together with Lagardelle, the French [[Syndicalism|Syndicalist]] militant, and personally met with liberal theorists [[Benedetto Croce]] and [[Guglielmo Ferrero]], as well as with Syndicalist [[Arturo Labriola]] and fellow journalist [[Giuseppe Prezzolini]].&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; His [[Travel writing|travel account]], which includes [[essay]]s on art and civilization, was published the same year, as ''Spre Roma'' ("Toward Rome").&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919, 1026&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Rampa'' and ''Facla'' (first edition)===
Back in Romania, Cocea launched ''[[Rampa (Romanian magazine)|Rampa]]'', a theatrical review originally published as a daily. His partner in this venture was a veteran of thetrical life, [[Alexandru Davila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Vera Molea, [http://www.bibliotecametropolitana.ro/Uploads/martie2009.pdf "Alexandru Davila și revolta studențească din 13 martie 1906"], in the Mihail Sadoveanu City Library ''Biblioteca Bucureștilor'', Nr. 3/2009, p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea also set up the independent socialist newspaper ''[[Facla]]''. The latter, identified as Romania's first socialist and satirical magazine by Arghezi himself,&lt;ref name="marcs205"&gt;Anghel &amp; Sfetea, p.205&lt;/ref&gt; was soon joined by the 18-year-old poet [[Ion Vinea]], as literary columnist and campaigner for post-Symbolist literature,&lt;ref name="isclasici"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/patrimoniul_clasicilor_de_izbelite "Patrimoniul clasicilor de izbeliște?"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 33/2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.30, 61-70, 74, 92-93, 140&lt;/ref&gt; with painters Iser&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.30; {{ro icon}} Boris Marian, [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr252_253/pagina16.pdf "Un mare pictor: Iosif Iser"], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 252-253 (1052-1053), May 2006, p.16&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Camil Ressu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Alina Ciufu, [http://www.telegrafonline.ro/pdf/pagini/1200866400/cultura.pdf "Picturile lui Camil Ressu, la Muzeul de Artă"], in ''[[Telegraf Constanța]]'', January 21, 2008, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; as illustrators. The other noted contributors to Cocea's publications were [[Toma Dragu]], [[Saniel Grossman]],&lt;ref name="marcs205"/&gt; [[George Diamandy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Florin Faifer]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FAIFERap.html "Moșierul"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', April 2002&lt;/ref&gt; [[Camil Petrescu]]&lt;ref&gt;Vianu, p.315&lt;/ref&gt; and [[avant-garde]] critic [[Poldi Chapier]], whose 1912 article for ''Rampa'' chronicled the international success of [[Futurism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.90&lt;/ref&gt; Also featured were poems and translations by the post-Symbolist [[H. Bonciu]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.900&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's own contributions include the chronicle of a play by [[Henry Bataille]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Dan Grigorescu]], [http://www.curierulnational.ro/Opinii/2004-03-13/Cultura+cotidiana "Cultura cotidiană"], in ''[[Curierul Național]]'', March 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and a salute to the "invincible spirit" of the [[5 October 1910 revolution|Portuguese republican revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Ion Babici, "Octombrie 1910. Portugalia se proclamă republică", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', October 1975, p.40&lt;/ref&gt;

Alongside renewed attacks on Romania's cultural traditionalism, Cocea and Arghezi initiated a lengthy campaign in favor of universal suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt; Their articles and headlines were often [[Sensationalism|sensationalist]] and provoking, again focusing on Carol I, Romania's aging King. They often referred to the monarch as ''Ploșnița'' ("The Tick"), ''Gheșeftarul'' ("The Shop-Keeper") or ''Neamțul'' ("The Kraut").&lt;ref name="gpproces"&gt;{{ro icon}} G. Pienescu, [http://www.romlit.ro/un_proces_care_nu_a_avut_loc_dect_pe_hrtie "Un proces care nu a avut loc decât pe hârtie"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 24/2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''Facla'', with media support from ''Adevărul'' and the Romanian anarchist milieus, was taunting the authorities by staging its own mock trial for ''[[lèse majesté]]''.&lt;ref name="gpproces"/&gt; ''Facla''{{'}}s [[anticlericalism]], specifically aimed at the Orthodox Church, formed part of a larger scandal, which had earlier seen Arghezi giving up his [[hierodeacon]]'s frock.&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Sfetea, p.205-206&lt;/ref&gt; The ardent [[antimilitarism]] of Cocea's ''Facla'' articles, in particular his mockery of General [[Grigore C. Crăiniceanu]] and his sons, had similar results: the journalist was handed a preemptive and dishonorable [[military discharge]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, July 1971, p.21&lt;/ref&gt;

Culturally, ''Facla'' was a leading adversary of traditionalist literature and of the [[Nationalism|nationalist]] periodicals which supported it. Its attack was concentrated on ''[[Drum Drept]]'' and ''[[Convorbiri Critice]]'' magazines (the focus of Vinea's articles)&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.63, 65&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Antisemitism|antisemitic]] historian [[Nicolae Iorga]], who had earlier dismissed ''Facla'' as a venue for [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] interests.&lt;ref&gt;Anghel &amp; Sfetea, p.210; {{ro icon}} Minodora Sălcudean, [http://www.revista-studii-uvvg.ro/files/revista_V_2.pdf "Discursul public arghezian. Strategii polemice în ''Scrisoarea deschisă''"], in the [[Vasile Goldiș West University of Arad]] ''Studii de Știință și Cultură'', Nr. 2 (17), June 2009, p.26, 28&lt;/ref&gt; ''Facla'' also inaugurated the conflict between Cocea and the ''Viața Românească'' Poporanists. As a socialist, Cocea attacked the Poporanists for supporting artistic nationalism, and then for courting the mainstream [[National Liberal Party (Romania, 1875)|National Liberal Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.30, 147&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocea unsuccessfully presented himself as a Social Democratic candidate in the [[Romanian general election, 1912|elections of 1912]], the first ones in Romania to be contested by an independent socialist party.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p.206&lt;/ref&gt; However, he soon broke off from the party, and came to be considered a representative of the "bourgeois press" by his former socialist colleagues. One of them, [[Constantin Titel Petrescu]], informs that Cocea "could not live by the party discipline".&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p.257-258&lt;/ref&gt;

===World War I, October Revolution and ''Chemarea''===
At an early stage in [[World War I]], public opinion in neutral Romania was divided between the [[Allies of World War I|Entente Powers]] and the [[Central Powers]], both of which held Romanian [[irredenta]]. In this context, the [[Francophile]] Cocea manifested himself as an outspoken partisan of Romania's alliance with the Entente.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.30; Camboulives, p.184&lt;/ref&gt; There followed a split between Cocea and his erstwhile partners Arghezi, Galaction and Bogdan-Pitești. The latter three were committed [[Germanophile]]s who proceeded to publish their own review, ''Cronica''.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.23, 39-45, 98. See also Vianu, p.482-483&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Chemarea]]'', a mainly political magazine published by Ion Vinea in 1915, stood between the two groups, but was probably managed by Cocea, who allegedly came up with its name (lit. "the calling").&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.23&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's friendship with Arghezi had again soured to the point of mutual hatred. In ''Facla'', Cocea made thinly veiled comments about the poet's mother, an unmarried woman, and suggested that the ''Cronica'' staff "still lives on the morsels left over from Bogdan-Pitești's feasts".&lt;ref&gt;Popescu-Cadem, p.217&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Romania during World War I|1916-1917 Campaign]] turned into a defensive war, N. D. Cocea joined the government and Land Forces on their retreat to [[Western Moldavia]]. Reunited with Vinea, he helped publish a daily named ''Deșteptarea'' ("The Awakening"), flirting with the Germanophiles and [[Zimmerwald Conference|Zimmerwald neutralists]], hotly criticizing the Ententist and National Liberal establishment.&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Geo Șerban]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Un-profil-Jacques-Frondistul*articleID_6309-articles_details.html "Un profil: Jacques Frondistul"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 144, November 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.98-99&lt;/ref&gt; However, he remained an outspoken critic of those public figures whom he perceived as German hirelings, including politician [[Alexandru Marghiloman]] and ''Arena'' newspaperman [[Alfred Hefter-Hidalgo]].&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"/&gt; As was later acknowledged by Vinea, Cocea and his ''Deșteptarea'' colleagues had formed a conspiratorial "revolutionary republican committee".&lt;ref name="ivdumitriu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Vartic]], [http://www.romlit.ro/petru_dumitriu_i_negrul_su_ii "Petru Dumitriu și 'negrul' său" (II)], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 16/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Both of them were also affiliated with a wing of the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Fabian Anton, [http://193.26.10.83/pdf/Ararat%2007%202007.pdf "Armenii în masoneria românească"], in ''[http://193.26.10.83/ Ararat]'', Nr. 7/2007, p.6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msmessage"&gt;Marcel Shapira, [http://www.masonicforum.ro/archive/en/nr20/schapira.html "Message"], in the National Grand Lodge of Romania ''[http://www.masonicforum.ro/ Masonic Forum Magazine]'', Winter 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

A while after, Cocea made his way in the [[Russian Provisional Government|Russian Republic]], Romania's Entente ally, and settled in [[Petrograd]]. His activities there included putting out the [[French-language]] magazine, ''L'Entente'' ("The Entente"), which was financed by his old rivals, the Romanian National Liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu, p.119-120; See also Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.30&lt;/ref&gt; As a resident of [[Hotel Astoria (Saint Petersburg)|Hotel Astoria]],&lt;ref&gt;Baciu, p.7&lt;/ref&gt; he witnessed first-hand the [[October Revolution]], and became a passionate supporter of the [[Bolshevik]] cause. He later claimed to have been present, on Revolution day, in the [[Petrograd Soviet]] hall, hearing the victorious speech of Bolshevik leader [[Vladimir Lenin]],&lt;ref&gt;Baciu, p.6, 8&lt;/ref&gt; and to have later attended the second [[All-Russian Congress of Soviets]].&lt;ref name="vf147"&gt;Frunză, p.147&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mseisenstein"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marius Șopterean, [http://www.revistatribuna.ro/doc_db_site/tribuna/tribuna84.pdf "1001 de filme și nopți. 13: Eisenstein"], in ''[[Tribuna (Romania)|Tribuna]]'', Nr. 84/2006, p.35&lt;/ref&gt; As a representative of the International Association for Information of the Labor Press of America, France, and [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Great Britain]], Cocea exchanged notes with Lenin. He interviewed Lenin about the Bolsheviks' goals, assuring him that his replies would be published verbatim.&lt;ref&gt;Baciu, p.7; [[Vladimir Lenin]], ''[http://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/nov/10b.htm To: The International Association for Information of the Labour Press of America, France, and Great Britain]'', at the [[Marxists Internet Archive]] (retrieved February 14, 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

By the end of the year, Cocea had returned to Moldavia. Under his direction (December 1917 to February 1918), ''Deșteptarea'' became a new edition of ''Chemarea''. It was often issued with large blank spaces, showing interventions by military censors.&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"/&gt; The gazette managed to publish a letter of protest, signed by poet [[Benjamin Fondane]], expressing a hope that Arghezi would not be prosecuted as a traitor.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.139&lt;/ref&gt; After advertising its "radical socialist" agenda, ''Chemarea'' was promptly shut down by the [[Alexandru Averescu]] cabinet.&lt;ref name="pc99"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.99&lt;/ref&gt; For this and other reasons, Cocea would later refer to Averescu as the organizer of "[[White Terror (Russia)|White Terror]]" in Romania.&lt;ref name="icaug41"&gt;Constantinescu, August 1971, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocea was a strong critic of Romania's [[Treaty of Bucharest (1918)|separate armistice with Germany]],&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"/&gt; and consequently listed as a ''[[persona non grata]]'' by the Central Powers.&lt;ref&gt;Rusu Abrudeanu, p.368-371&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1918, he launched ''Depeșa'' ("The Dispatch"), later published as a third edition of ''Chemarea''. A new presence on these two periodicals was writer [[Jacques G. Costin]], who produced several political pieces (including a renewed denunciation of Hefter-Hidalgo) and later the musical chronicle.&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.188&lt;/ref&gt; Its other staff writers were young men who later built career in the political press, both left- and right-wing: Vinea, [[Demostene Botez]], [[Alexandru Busuioceanu]], [[Cezar Petrescu]], [[Pamfil Șeicaru]]&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"/&gt; and [[Adrian Maniu]].&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; They took care of the newspaper when Cocea left Iași on a short visit to [[Bessarabia]], a former Russian province that was in the process of [[Union of Bessarabia with Romania|uniting with Romania]].&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"/&gt;

Victorious in its lengthy conflict with Hefter's ''Arena'', ''Chemarea'' eventually relocated to Bucharest, but suffered from the nationwide paper shortage.&lt;ref name="gsfrondistul"/&gt; Cocea supported the [[Socialist Party of Romania]] (PS) through the leftist riots of December 1918, and, when the PS leadership was arrested, sat on the defense team, alongside Mille and Dragu.&lt;ref&gt;Petrescu, p.320-321&lt;/ref&gt;

''Chemarea'' survived until November 1, 1919—when its lampoon of Romanian King [[Ferdinand I of Romania|Ferdinand I]] prompted the intervention of military censors.&lt;ref name="pc99"/&gt; On November 2, shortly before the [[Romanian general election, 1919|general election day]], Cocea profited from the temporary suspension of censorship to reissue the same paper, subsequently renamed ''Chemarea Roșie'' ("The Red Call"), then ''Facla'', ''Torța'' ("The Torch"), ''Clopotul'' ("The Bell") and again ''Chemarea'' (changes which were supposed to keep censors always a step behind Cocea).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.99, 132, 140, 188&lt;/ref&gt; These publications were attempts to revive and radicalize the socialist literary press, that had virtually succumbed in Romania after the demise of ''Facla''{{'}}s first edition. A [[Marxism|Marxist]] literary critic, [[Ovid Crohmălniceanu]], proposes that Cocea's renewed offensive missed the mark, lacking "a clear enough vision".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.144-145&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parliamentary mandate===
Cocea was elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania|Lower Chamber]] during the November 1919 suffrage (reelected during the [[Romanian general election, 1920|May 1920 suffrage]]). He represented a non-partisan [[electoral list]] for Bucharest (the Citizen's List), whose other two candidates, physician [[Nicolae L. Lupu]] and lawyer [[Constantin Costa-Foru]], also won seats.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, July 1971, p.20&lt;/ref&gt; Although officially an independent, he rallied with the PS in the Chamber minority group led by [[Gheorghe Cristescu]] and [[Ilie Moscovici]].&lt;ref&gt;Filipescu, p.67-69. See also Constantinescu, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's mandate was immediately contested by his National Liberal adversaries. They sought to invalidate his candidature, citing a law which prevented those with a military discharge from running in elections. The National Liberal motion was however defeated when Cocea, who presented himself as a political victim, earned unexpected support from the [[Romanian National Party]] and the [[Democratic Nationalist Party (Romania)|Democratic Nationalist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, July 1971, p.21-22&lt;/ref&gt;

In opposition to the [[People's Party (interwar Romania)|People's Party]] and the [[anti-communist]] consensus, Cocea spoke positively in [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] about [[Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic|Soviet Russia]], arguing that the Bolshevik foreign policy had saved the whole of civilization, and citing favorable statements made by the returning war prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;Filipescu, p.67-68, 71, 73&lt;/ref&gt; His theory was that the [[Comintern]] was a legitimate successor of the [[First International]]. The notion was contested by another socialist deputy, Dragu—early signs of a schism between the Cominternist socialist-communists and those who followed the [[International Working Union of Socialist Parties|Vienna International]].&lt;ref&gt;Filipescu, p.69-70&lt;/ref&gt; In one of his addresses to the Chamber (July 28, 1920), Cocea presented a vision of socialism that was neither "unilateral" nor "narrow", but suited to the needs of "all peoples and all times", and quoted from ''[[The Internationale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Potop, p.42&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's rhetoric, equating the October Revolution with the [[Virgin birth of Jesus|birth of Christ]] and glorifying the [[Slavic soul]], was ridiculed from the benches as "Russian mysticism".&lt;ref&gt;Filipescu, p.68&lt;/ref&gt;

For a while, Cocea's sympathy turned toward the rising [[Peasants' Party (Romania)|Peasants' Party]]. This Poporanist group, which reacted against National Liberal politics and sought peace with the socialists and the Soviets, was called "civilized and [[Westernization|Westernized]]" by the socialist journalist.&lt;ref&gt;Filipescu, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Cocea was becoming disappointed by the [[parliamentary system]] of [[Greater Romania]]. He argued that Parliament itself should be replaced with a [[Technocracy|technocratic]] body, elected by a radical form of [[universal suffrage]],&lt;ref&gt;Filipescu, p.69&lt;/ref&gt; and clamored his belief that "in short while, [...] Romania will be socialist."&lt;ref name="icaug41"/&gt;

In August 1920, Cocea voted in favor of [[Grigore Trancu-Iași]]'s labor law, although he found it unsatisfactory—his stated belief was that the law's inequities would spark a "[[social revolution]]".&lt;ref&gt;Filipescu, p.75&lt;/ref&gt; There followed the [[1920 Romanian general strike|October 1920 general strike]], that was condoned and supported by Cocea and the writers at ''Chemarea''.&lt;ref&gt;Ion Iacoș, "Contribuții privind greva generală din octombrie 1920", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Nr. 6/1970, p.1077, 1078, 1079, 1087&lt;/ref&gt; During December, following a [[state of siege]], Cocea and Lupu were behind parliamentary efforts to investigate the alleged murder of socialist activist [[Herșcu Aroneanu]] by People's Party authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, August 1971, p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt;

When, in early 1921, Cristescu and the other socialist-communists set up the [[Romanian Communist Party]] (PCR), Cocea became an outside sympathizer of their cause, protesting against their imprisonment and prosecution in the [[Dealul Spirii Trial]].&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, September 1971, p.70-71; Potop, p.42-43&lt;/ref&gt; In May and June of that year, when Chamber was assessing the case of Moscovici's seat, left vacant by his sentencing after the strike, Cocea asked for it to be filled by [[Constantin Popovici (politician)|Constantin Popovici]]; Popovici, next on the electoral list, was himself under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, September 1971, p.70&lt;/ref&gt; His speech about "government terror" ended in a heated dispute with People's Party deputies Berlescu (whom Cocea called a descendant of [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani]] [[Slavery in Romania|slaves]]) and Alexandru Oteteleșeanu.&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, September 1971, p.70-71&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the [[Romanian general election, 1921|1921 suffrage]], Cocea labeled [[Conservative-Democratic Party|Conservative-Democratic]] leader [[Take Ionescu]], the [[Prime Minister of Romania|Prime Minister]]-designate, as a pawn of King Ferdinand and his "[[camarilla]]".&lt;ref&gt;Constantinescu, September 1971, p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Early in 1922, Cocea also joined [[Dem. I. Dobrescu]] and other lawyers on the Dealul Spirii Trial defense team.&lt;ref&gt;Ciorianu, p.29&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Facla'' revival and 1923 trial===
[[File:Cum sunt decapitați regii cari se împotrivesc voinței poporului..., Facla 24 martie 1923.jpg|thumb|270px|''[[Facla]]'' of March 24, 1923, published with the warning ''Cum sunt decapitați regii cari se împotrivesc voinței poporului...'' ("How they decapitate kings who oppose the people's wishes...") alongside the [[execution of Louis XVI]]]]
In 1920, ''Chemarea'' came to its end, and Cocea began putting out another edition of ''Facla'' weekly.&lt;ref name="pc99"/&gt; The newspaper acquired offices in the Frascatti Hotel (later the "Savoy" branch of [[Constantin Tănase Revue Theater]]), redecorated by artist [[Marcel Janco]].&lt;ref name="sc46-47"&gt;Callimachi, p.46-47&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Stelian Tănase]], this enterprise was secretly financed by Soviet Russia as external [[agitprop]]: notes kept by ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' intelligence agency suggest that Cocea was a regular guest at the [[Russian Ambassador to Romania|Russian mission in Romania]].&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;

Cocea's disciple, Ion Vinea, went on to publish the magazine ''[[Contimporanul]]'', originally as a socialist tribune, but later as a modernist forum.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.131-145, 220; Crohmălniceanu, p.59&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea was an occasional contributor to this venue, but was separated from its [[avant-garde]] staff writers, having a less rebellious writing style and a more structured political vision.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.140, 194; Crohmălniceanu, p.65&lt;/ref&gt; In exchange, Vinea was an occasional contributor to ''Facla'', whenever ''Contimporanul'' met financial difficulties;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.135, 140, 212&lt;/ref&gt; he was also the editorial director from 1925 to 1926 (the year when ''Facla'' again closed down).&lt;ref name="isclasici"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isserviciul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/un_poet_n_serviciul_gazetriei "Un poet în serviciul gazetăriei"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2005&lt;/ref&gt; Vinea's own political articles were noted for their critique of National Liberal policies, portraying liberal Romania as a [[Brătianu family]] dictatorship and campaigning in favor of the socialist groups.&lt;ref name="isserviciul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcrisipitor"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Paul Cernat]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Publicistica-unui-constructivist-risipitor*articleID_9408-articles_details.html "Publicistica unui constructivist risipitor"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 191, October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1924, the ''Facla'' group was also joined by "Red Prince" [[Scarlat Callimachi]], a modernist promoter and communist militant,&lt;ref name="sc46-47"/&gt; by aspiring critic [[Șerban Cioculescu]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Al.

"Cu voi..."], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 27/2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The early 1920s also witnessed N. D. Cocea's involvement in various other civic and cultural campaigns. He became, in 1922, a member of the Romanian [[Friends of Nature]], a socialist-inspired [[environmental organization]], and, the following year, joined Dem I. Dobrescu in creating the League for Human Rights.&lt;ref name="ac135"&gt;Cioroianu, p.135&lt;/ref&gt; He was among the regular guests at [[International Red Aid]] "literary tea parties", described by historian [[Adrian Cioroianu]] as "one of those schemes the communists employed in collecting money for their comrades in prison".&lt;ref name="ac135"/&gt; With Fondane, director [[Armand Pascal]] and various others, Cocea also participated in creating ''Insula'', an actors' working group. It was supposed to revolutionize [[Theatre of Romania|Romanian theater]], but disappeared after only a few months of existence (February 1923).&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.271-273&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea compensated by giving moral support to the Jewish modernist [[Vilna Troupe]], which relocated to Bucharest in 1924.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.277&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year Cocea published a new book, ''Ignoranță'' ("Ignorance").&lt;ref name="gc1026"&gt;Călinescu, p.1026&lt;/ref&gt;

After the adoption by a National Liberal legislature of Romania's [[1923 Constitution of Romania|1923 Constitution]], Cocea joined up with the angrier ranks of political opposition. He soon publicized a claim that King Ferdinand and his favorite minister, Brătianu, had together given legal foundations to a [[plutocracy]].&lt;ref name="pc140"&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.140&lt;/ref&gt; He was taken to court and lost, being sentenced for ''[[lèse majesté]]''.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pc140"/&gt; Reputedly, the authorities also confiscated samples of Cocea's anticlerical fiction works, but these were recovered and published by ''Contimporanul'' in 1925.&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.169&lt;/ref&gt; Through the voice of Vinea, ''Contimporanul'' also protested the sentencing, claiming that Cocea was a persecuted man, his career "a spectacle of modern dramatism".&lt;ref name="pc140"/&gt; The trial attracted significant attention among the Romanian youth, which divided itself into monarchists and republicans.&lt;ref name="lbdioptr"/&gt;

Cocea's conduct was the topic of controversy throughout the early 1920s: in 1922, Cocea's influential modernist rival, the literary theorist [[Eugen Lovinescu]], bitterly attacked him, Arghezi and Bogdan-Pitești for their wartime conduct.&lt;ref name="pc39"/&gt; Noted for its [[Xenophobia|xenophobic]] attacks on ''Contimporanul''{{'}}s editors,&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.207&lt;/ref&gt; the nationalist review ''[[Țara Noastră]]'' openly celebrated Cocea's arrest. An unsigned note in that paper announced that Cocea had been imprisoned "for the least of his crimes", and called to mind that Cocea had been lampooning its editor, [[Octavian Goga]].&lt;ref name="tninsemnari"&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/9738/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1923_004_041.pdf "Însemnări"], in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 41/1923, p.1326 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; The antisemitic publicist [[Ion Gorun|Alexandru Hodoș]] designated Cocea's supporters at ''Adevărul'' and ''[[Cuvântul Liber (1924)|Cuvântul Liber]]'' with the title of "[[Shabbos goy]]im", describing Cocea as a habitual prankster, a renegade of the socialist cause, and a dishonorable man.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Gorun|Alexandru Hodoș]], [http://dspace.bcucluj.ro/bitstream/123456789/9755/1/BCUCLUJ_FP_451581_1924_005_030.pdf "Adulatori și pamfletari"], in ''[[Țara Noastră]]'', Nr. 30/1924, p.942-944 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocea served his sentence of one year and a half at [[Craiova]] penitentiary, and paid the 10,000 [[Romanian leu|lei]] fine.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; He was afterward involved in communist agitation, speaking at PCR rallies in [[Câmpina]] (1925), [[Soroca]] and [[Otaci]] (during the [[Romanian general election, 1931|1931 electoral campaign]]).&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; The PCR underground's leaders were often Cocea's guests at Frascatti.&lt;ref&gt;Callimachi, p.47&lt;/ref&gt; His modernist supporters did not follow his lead. By 1929, Vinea and ''Contimporanul'' were toning down their own socialist agenda, cooperating instead with the moderate [[National Peasants' Party]], and even drawing suspicion from the left that they had become sympathetic to [[fascism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.169-179, 229-244&lt;/ref&gt; Generally a critic of the National Peasantists,&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Cocea quit a resurfacing ''Facla'' in 1930, leaving Vinea in charge (the latter was editor of that newspaper until its 1940 disestablishment).&lt;ref name="isclasici"/&gt;&lt;ref name="isserviciul"/&gt;

===1930s novels and ''Era Nouă''===
Over the next few years, N. D. Cocea is believed to have been largely inactive in the political press.&lt;ref name="pastia289"&gt;Pastia, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he made his return to fiction. In 1931, his novel ''Vinul de viață lungă'' ("The Wine of a Long Life") was released under contract with [[Editura Cultura Națională]].&lt;ref name="gc1026"/&gt; Its received much acclaim, unmatched by Cocea's later works in the genre, which critics often found unpalatable for their [[Erotic literature|erotic content]].&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p.184. See also Călinescu, p.919; Pastia, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's erotic series includes: ''Fecior de slugă'' ("The Son of the Servant"), published in 1933 by Cultura Națională; ''Pentr-un petec de negreață'' ("Over a Black Patch", also known as ''Andrei Vaia''), 1934, [[Editura Librăriei Leon Alcaly|Alcaly Publishers]]; and ''Nea Nae'' ("Uncle Nae"), 1935, Alcaly.&lt;ref name="gc1026"/&gt;

During that interval, Cocea was again brought into custody. He was tried and imprisoned for [[statutory rape]], having eloped with the 16-year-old Gina, orphaned daughter of the wealthy National Liberal politico [[Ion Manolescu-Strunga]].&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; The liberties he took in public life, and the provoking nature of his writings, resulted in other disputes with the nationalists, forming part of their larger conservative crusade against "[[pornography]]" and the avant-garde. The traditionalist periodical ''[[Neamul Românesc]]'', put out by [[Nicolae Iorga]], had "Cocea Niculae" on its [[blacklist]], as the third most offensive Romanian author (the avant-garde authors [[H. Bonciu]] and [[Geo Bogza]] were at No. 1 and No. 2 respectively).&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Gheorghe Grigurcu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/despre_pornografie_ii "Despre pornografie" (II)], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2007&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, Cocea was becoming involved in a publicized controversy with his wartime colleague [[Pamfil Șeicaru]]. As commentators have since noted, the two journalists were equally vulgar, but Șeicaru had been enlisted by the nationalists and the traditionalists.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nmmoralitati"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Nicolae Manolescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/moraliti "Moralități"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 11/2000&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1934, Cocea joined a group known as ''[[Amicii URSS]]'', formed on the basis of a PCR initiative and formally seeking to normalize Romania's relations with the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Callimachi, p.49; Cioroianu, p.114-115, 135&lt;/ref&gt; In November of that year, ''[[Siguranța Statului]]'' was reporting that Cocea and Callimachi, together with [[Petre Constantinescu-Iași]], were going to establish in Bucharest a "far left platform" with a "pronounced [[Philosemitism|Semitic]] tendency"; known as ''Ideea Socială'' ("The Social Idea"), it was supposedly part of the ''[[Adevărul]]''-''[[Dimineața]]'' network.&lt;ref name="stprintul"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.sferapoliticii.ro/sfera/135/art07-arhiva.html " 'Prințul Roșu' "], in ''[[Sfera Politicii]]'', Nr. 135&lt;/ref&gt; The period also brought Cocea's brief and uneventful marriage with Lila Stănescu. She was in reality the lover of PCR activist [[Ion Gheorghe Maurer]], whom the journalist continued to view as his friend.&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt;

In 1936, the year when he married his long-time lover Gina Manolescu-Strunga,&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Cocea again returned to the forefront of Romania's left-wing press, launching the theoretical magazine ''Era Nouă'' ("New Era"). Also a front for the PCR, replacing the banned ''[[Bluze Albastre]]'' of communist writer [[Alexandru Sahia]], ''Era Nouă'' was itself shut down by the authorities in 1937.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.151-152&lt;/ref&gt; It had published only two issues. In one of its internal memos, ''Siguranța Statului'' reviewed the first of these as inoffensively "academic", the second as "agitatorial".&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; ''Siguranța'' agents also noted that Cocea, with Dobrescu and Callimachi, was making efforts to assist the PCR activists tried in [[Chișinău]], and trying to obtain further support from the left-wing National Peasantists ([[Virgil Madgearu]], [[Grigore Iunian]]).&lt;ref name="stprintul"/&gt;

''Era Nouă''{{'}}s main contributors were young communist essayists such as Sahia, [[Miron Radu Paraschivescu]], [[Ștefan Voicu]] and [[Silvian Iosifescu]], but the magazine also published avant-garde authors with [[Marxism|Marxist]] sensibilities: [[Ion Călugăru]], [[Stephan Roll]], [[Virgil Teodorescu]], [[Dolfi Trost]]&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.152-156&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Paul Păun]].&lt;ref name="viionescu"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Virgil Ierunca]], [http://www.memoria.ro/marturii/domenii/diverse/diagonale_-_amintiri_despre_ghita_ionescu/1178/ "Diagonale - Amintiri despre Ghiță Ionescu"], at the [http://www.memoria.ro/ Memoria Digital Library]; retrieved July 17, 2014&lt;/ref&gt; They were joined by communist polemicists [[Ghiță Ionescu]] and [[Belu Zilber]].&lt;ref name="viionescu"/&gt; In its first issue, ''Era Nouă'' prophesied that the [[Crisis (Marxian)|general crisis]] of [[capitalism]] was evident in the rapid decay of "its culture and ideology", leaving the [[proletariat]] in a position to reinterpret mainstream culture "on the large basis offered by [[dialectical materialism]]".&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.152. See also Ornea, p.38&lt;/ref&gt; According to cultural historian [[Zigu Ornea]], such pronouncements, soon taken up by the entire communist press, were in reality a form of left-wing [[totalitarianism]], and therefore equivalent to the internal logic of fascism.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.37-41&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Reporter'' magazine and tensions with the PCR===
Cocea was reputedly pondering the relaunch of ''Chemarea'' as a communist newspaper, supposedly with [[Ștefan Foriș]], the ex-convict head of PCR Agitprop, as its manager, and Paraschivescu, Voicu, as well as other [[Union of Communist Youth|Communist Youth]] activists, as co-editors.&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; ''Siguranța'' men had it that Cocea shocked his communist partners by informing them that ''Chemarea'' was to be a "[[Centrism|centrist]]" platform, with no known communist on its staff.&lt;ref name="stamoral2"/&gt; However, the senior socialist remained active in proximity to the PCR over the next year. In May 1937, he caught ''Siguranța''{{'}}s attention as a would-be collaborator to Callimachi's [[anti-fascist]] review ''Munca'' ("The Labor"). Making overtures toward the National Peasantist left-wingers, ''Munca'' also received contributions from poets [[Mihail Cruceanu]] and [[Sandu Tudor]], from sociologist [[Mihai Ralea]] and journalist [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște]], and from writer-director [[Sandu Eliad]].&lt;ref name="stprintul"/&gt; In summer 1937, the moderate left-wing ''[[Azi (Romanian newspaper)|Azi]]'' daily published Cocea's renewed criticism of censorship, part of a series of a collective reply to the [[far right]]'s moralistic discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Ornea, p.455&lt;/ref&gt;

Cocea was again mandated by the PCR to lead ''Reporter'' weekly, beginning with its November 1937 issue. The periodical, already in existence for five years, was making efforts to reach the apolitical public.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.152, 156&lt;/ref&gt; In an editorial for ''Reporter'', Cocea made comments similar to the ''Era Nouă'' program, with a more pronounced satirical tone and allusions to fascism: "however massive the stupidity of dictatorial rules, man's intelligence, honesty in convictions [and] the fervor of the masses will in the end topple them. [...] The greedy [[satrap]]s, the leeward adventurers have come to tumble down, one on top of the other."&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

''Reporter''{{'}}s agenda was generically anti-fascist: campaigning for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican side]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]], it lampooned [[Benito Mussolini]] and [[Adolf Hitler]], and repeatedly attacked the [[Iron Guard]] or other Romanian fascist groups.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.156-158&lt;/ref&gt; Its political panelists included, alongside Voicu, Paraschivescu and Călugăru, the future communist historian [[Ion Popescu-Puțuri]], reporter [[Aurel Baranga]],&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.157-159&lt;/ref&gt; and anti-fascist poet [[Gherasim Luca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ioana Pârvulescu]], [http://www.romlit.ro/engels_i_lautramont "Engels și Lautréamont"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 34/2003&lt;/ref&gt; Other members of the ''Reporter'' circle, whose contacts with Cocea were closely investigated by the authorities, included a diverse gathering of PCR figures: Foriș, Trost, Marxist sociologist [[Lucrețiu Pătrășcanu]], unionist [[Ilie Pintilie]]&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; and the [[Bessarabia]]n poet [[Emilian Bucov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Serafim Saka]], [http://www.sud-est.md/numere/20080915/article_8/ "Atunci – Partidul; acum – gașca"], in ''[[Revista Sud-Est]]'', Nr.3/2008&lt;/ref&gt; ''Reporter'' also published the militant poems of [[Demostene Botez]], [[Liviu Deleanu]] and [[Al. Șahighian]], and samples of international left-leaning literature ([[Ilya Ehrenburg]], [[André Malraux]], [[Nikolai Ostrovsky]]).&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.158&lt;/ref&gt; The maverick dramatist [[Mihail Sebastian]] was, for a while, ''Reporter''{{'}}s literary chronicler.&lt;ref&gt;Crohmălniceanu, p.159&lt;/ref&gt;

Only two months after Cocea took over, ''Reporter'' was banned by state censorship, suspected of "communist tendencies" and of publishing "alarmist articles."&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; The sincerity of Cocea's political credo was by then coming into question: the maverick communist [[Petre Pandrea]] alleged that Cocea was infiltrated into the party ranks by ''Siguranța Statului''.&lt;ref name="aspeltz"/&gt; Stelian Tănase also describes Cocea as a [[double agent]], notoriously close to ''Siguranța'' director [[Mihail Moruzov]] (his Bucharest neighbor), trafficking in information from the communist movement and the court of [[Carol II of Romania|Carol II]], but still advising PCR Agitprop.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; Cocea was nevertheless being closely watched by the ''Siguranța'' Detective Corps. It kept notes on his meetings with French press correspondents, with Spanish Republican diplomats and with disgraced [[History of the Jews in Romania|Jewish Romanian]] journalists such as [[Jacques G. Costin]].&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; According to these documents, Cocea discussed political matters with the opponents of Carol II, including National Peasantist [[Iuliu Maniu]] and communist sympathizer [[Petru Groza]].&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; He is known to have had great sympathy for Maniu, despite their political differences.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"&gt;{{ro icon}} Marin Pop, [http://www.caietesilvane.ro/indexcs.php?cmd=articol&amp;idart=1954 "Întâlniri secrete între Iuliu Maniu, Nicolae D.

===World War II===
A 1939 entry in Cocea's own diary admits that the "unexpected" [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|Non-Aggression Treaty]] between the Soviets and [[Nazi Germany]] was the source of "doubting" and "bitterness" among left-wing Romanians, but scolds his old friend [[Nicolae L. Lupu]] for having then lost faith in socialism.&lt;ref name="giflupu"&gt;{{ro icon}} Gheorghe I. Florescu, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/FLORESCUdec6.html "Un socialist sui-generis: dr. N. Lupu"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', December 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to his earlier political stances, Cocea was, by 1938, a member of the National Liberal Party, probably because a new wave of repression had led the PCR to implode.&lt;ref name="vf147, 213-214"&gt;Frunză, p.147, 213-214&lt;/ref&gt; He was registered with the National Liberals until after Carol II's [[National Renaissance Front]] dictatorship pushed them into semi-clandestinity, and still enjoyed a privileged relationship with them during [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="vf147, 213-214"/&gt;

Cocea was inactive during the war, when Romania was allied with the [[Axis Powers]], and the [[Romania during World War II|successive dictatorial regimes]]. Inhabiting a private villa in the [[Transylvania]]n town of [[Sighișoara]], he kept diaries which offer insight into his various political dealings.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; Around 1939, he was separated from his wife Gina, following a series of disagreements in the family.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; The fascist [[National Legionary State|National Legionary regime]] continued to keep track on his movements during 1940, alarmed by rumors that he had been operating a clandestine [[printing press]], but was unable to determine whether he was still a communist.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;

From 1941, the Nazi-aligned regime of ''[[Conducător]]'' [[Ion Antonescu]] ordered Romania's participation in the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|war against the Soviet Union]]. Cocea was active in the informal opposition to Antonescu, approaching his old friends in the mainstream political parties. As early as January 1942, Cocea met with the National Peasantist leadership, probing its attitude toward the Soviet Union and the Romanian communists. Like them, Cocea was positively impressed that the PCR was turning into a "patriotic" party and going back on its pro-German stance.&lt;ref name="mpîntâlniri"/&gt; Around 1944, Cocea resumed contacts with the since-revived PCR. In June, ''Siguranța'' reported that he was rounding up support for communist sympathizer [[Mihai Ralea]] and his underground [[Socialist Peasants' Party]].&lt;ref name="stprintul"/&gt; He later served as the communists' liaison with the National Liberal Party wing of [[Gheorghe Tătărescu]] (later, the [[National Liberal Party-Tătărescu]]). Cocea's intervention contributed to a strategic alliance between the communists and the various other parties, within a coalition which overthrew Antonescu (''see [[King Michael's Coup]]'').&lt;ref name="vf147"/&gt; Cocea's actress sister [[Alice Cocéa|Alice]], who was living in [[German occupation of France during World War II|Nazi-occupied France]], was taking a different path: she and her manager, Robert Capgras, had a friendly relationship with the Germans and were later deemed [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaborators with the enemy]].&lt;ref name="mdsalice"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kenneth Krauss, ''The Drama of Fallen France: Reading'' La comédie sans Tickets, [[State University of New York Press]], Albany, 2004, p.8.  {{ISBN|0-7914-5953-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1944, Cocea was elected Vice President of the [[Romanian Writers' Society]], which was in the process of expelling writers associated with the wartime regimes.&lt;ref name="vdssr"&gt;{{ro icon}} Victor Durnea, [http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=9830 "Societatea scriitorilor români"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120218133843/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/articol.php?cod=9830 |date=2012-02-18 }}, in ''[[Dacia Literară]]'', Nr. 2/2008 (republished by the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ România Culturală] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902021335/http://www.romaniaculturala.ro/ |date=2011-09-02 }}'')&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cv79"&gt;Cristian Vasile, ''Literatura și artele în România comunistă. 1948-1953'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2010, p.79.  {{ISBN|978-973-50-2773-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He personally proposed for some 50 "valuable writers", from [[Maria Banuș]] and [[Ury Benador]] to [[Radu Tudoran]] and [[Gheorghe Zane]], including many of his left-wing friends, to be admitted into the Society (only 20 of them were eventually received).&lt;ref name="vdssr"/&gt; The following month, he participated with Callimachi in the creation of a formally unified [[Union of Professional Journalists in Romania|Journalists' Trade Union]]. Split between PCR and National Peasantist lobbies, it was created around the conjectural goal of purging the Romanian press of fascist influences.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.254-255&lt;/ref&gt; The Union was originally presided by a Committee comprising Cocea, Callimachi, [[Nicolae Carandino]], [[Miron Constantinescu]], [[George Ivașcu]], [[Eugen Jebeleanu]], [[Octav Livezeanu]], [[George Macovescu]], [[Nicolae Moraru]], [[Ion Pas]], [[Grigore Preoteasa]], [[Tudor Teodorescu-Braniște]], [[Alfons Vogel]] and several others.&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.255&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1945, Cocea represented the Writers' Society at the funeral of his ''Reporter'' colleague [[Mihail Sebastian]], who had been killed in a road accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.romanianjewish.org/db/pdf/nr275_276/speciala3.pdf "Din registrul 'faptelor diverse' în 'dosarele istoriei' "], in ''[[Realitatea Evreiască]]'', Nr. 275-276 (1075-1076), May 2007, p.III&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Romanian Society for Friendship with the Soviet Union]] (ARLUS), which offered a good reception to [[Soviet occupation of Romania|Soviet occupation forces]], counted N. D. and Dina Cocea among its earliest members (although they were probably not among its founders); in December 1944, father and daughter were co-opted on the ARLUS Leadership Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p.120, 124&lt;/ref&gt; The ARLUS Press Section, headed by Teodorescu-Braniște, had Cocea as one of its first vice presidents, serving alongside Ion Pas.&lt;ref name="ac135"/&gt; Around 1946, Cocea approached Arghezi with a PCR offer to become a paid communist writer. According to his own classified report for the party, he was unable to persuade his former friend to join him in this cause.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; Cocea's various efforts still earned praise from official poet [[Mihai Beniuc]], who included his colleague among the writers most active in disseminating communist principles after August 1944.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Cassian Maria Spiridon]], [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/TATAoct3.html "Un congres al scriitorilor" (I)], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', October 2003&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tănase, Cocea "offered himself to the Soviet occupier, with the same [[amoralism]] and cynicism that have been following him through life."&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;

Between 1944 and 1946,&lt;ref name="bc184"/&gt; Cocea was also editor and publisher of ''Victoria'' ("Victory") daily. Although nominally independent, it has been claimed by journalist Victor Frunză that this paper was a tribune for the PCR, supporting the policies of [[communization]], and popularizing [[Stalinism]].&lt;ref&gt;Frunză, p.214, 245&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ppgmemento"&gt;{{ro icon}} Petru Popescu Gogan, [http://revista.memoria.ro/?location=view_article&amp;id=351 "Memento!"], in ''Revista Memoria'', Nr. 28&lt;/ref&gt; It fostered a new generation of journalists and activists, among them [[Vera Călin]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Geo Șerban]], introductory note to [[Vera Călin]], [http://www.romlit.ro/frnturi_de_via_opiuni_cuvinte "Frânturi de viață, opțiuni, cuvinte"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 31/2005&lt;/ref&gt; [[B.

Caracostea]] to [[P. P. Panaitescu]] and [[Ion Petrovici]]).&lt;ref name="ppgmemento"/&gt;

On March 31, 1945, Cocea replaced the disgraced Carandino as Inspector-general of the Romanian theaters, and began introducing [[Censorship in Communist Romania|communist censorship]].&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, p.187, 188, 190&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1947, a few months before the [[Communist Romania|Romanian communist regime]] officially took over, Cocea was reelected to the Writers' Society Leadership Committee.&lt;ref name="vdssr"/&gt; Together with Ion Pas, the [[Ministry of Culture and National Patrimony|Minister of Arts]], he introduced legislation that severely curtailed the Romanian dramatic repertoire. It was largely impractical, causing an uproar in the theatrical community, and leading to Cocea's demotion in December 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Catalan, p.190-191&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 9, 1948, Cocea was made Vice President of the reformed Writers' Society (later [[Writers' Union of Romania]]), alongside Galaction, [[Gábor Gaál]] and [[Al. Șahighian]] ([[Zaharia Stancu]] was the President, [[Ion Călugăru]] the General Secretary).&lt;ref name="cv79"/&gt; He died the next year at his home in Sighișoara, shortly after a spiritual crisis had brought him back into the [[Romanian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt;

==Personal life and family==
N. D. Cocea had a notoriously promiscuous lifestyle, a favorite topic of gossip and urban legends. In his recollections, fellow journalist [[Constantin Beldie]] alleged that Cocea once owned a summer [[pavilion]] frequented by debauched young women, a veritable "[[seraglio]]".&lt;ref name="ammundus"&gt;Adrian Majuru, [http://plural-magazine.com/article_mundus-inversus.html "Mundus Inversus"], in the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine]'', Nr. 26/2005&lt;/ref&gt; A writer named Bogdan Amaru noted in autumn 1934 that "Nicu D. Cocea always walks around with two girls on his arms. The women sense in him the writer who is at all times willing to render them immortal with the tip of his pen."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Bogdan Amaru, [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/societateademaine/pdf/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1934_011_011.pdf "Jurnal de toamnă"], in ''[[Societatea de Mâine]]'', Nr. 11/1934, p.162 (digitized by the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]] [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/ Transsylvanica Online Library])&lt;/ref&gt; However, the intelligence agents keeping Cocea under surveillance during the 1930s and '40s collected rumors according to which their target was a [[homosexual]].&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; The ''[[Țara Noastră]]'' polemicists also claimed that Cocea's [[pederasty]] was a matter of public record.&lt;ref name="tninsemnari"/&gt;

Cocea's marriages and relationships resulted in four children: [[Tantzi Cocea|Tantzi]], [[Dina Cocea|Dina]], Radu and [[Ioana-Maria Cocea|Ioana-Maria]] (also known as Maria Cocea).&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; Florica Mille, who was his first wife, left him for his many affairs with younger women, even though, Dina Cocea recalls, she was forever fascinated by his intellect.&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; After the 1920 divorce, Cocea is said to have lived with a Maria&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; or Zoe Grigorescu.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Tantzi, who was born to him from this relationship (1909),&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; was the first wife of Liviu Ciulley (father of the award-winning filmmaker [[Liviu Ciulei]]).&lt;ref&gt;Gheorghe Florescu, ''Confesiunile unui cafegiu'', [[Humanitas publishing house|Humanitas]], Bucharest, 2008, p.228. {{ISBN|978-973-50-2208-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The writer's second marriage, to Lila Stănescu, was allegedly one [[Marriage of convenience|of convenience]],&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; and he was at the time still in a physical relationship with Gina Manolescu-Strunga, the reason for his [[statutory rape]] trial.

The daughter, Ioana-Maria, was later recognized by Cocea, and earned her artistic reputation as a sculptor;&lt;ref name="msraristocratia"/&gt; through her mother, she was related to the [[Ghica family]] and to the banker Iosif Pincas.&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; Like Comarnescu before him, Cocea became disenchanted with Gina and was repelled by her public persona: his diaries contain sarcastic comments on her supposed lack of principles and naïvete, calling her ''Gina Balamuc'' ("Madhouse Gina").&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; After parting with Cocea, Gina was married to communist journalist [[Ghiță Ionescu]] (later known as an [[anti-communist]] academic, relocated to England).&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; In the 1940s, while in Sighișoara, Cocea had as a mistress Ioana Mosora, who was more than 40 years his junior.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt;&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; One of his final projects was to educate Ioana, the daughter of impoverished peasants,&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ssscandaluri"/&gt; on art and literary history.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt;

According to literary historian [[George Călinescu]], Cocea was only devoted to "the cause of the proletariat" in his public life: "in his most intimate life, an aristocrat, worshiping the established order and the supreme factor."&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; The [[Anticlericalism|anticlerical]] journalist was always troubled by the matters of belief and organized religion. In ''Spre Roma'', Cocea confesses about having piously knelt in front of [[Leonardo da Vinci]]'s ''[[The Last Supper (Leonardo da Vinci)|Last Supper]]'', and about finding the arguments of [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] preachers to be almost irresistible.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Cocea was still active in the [[Freemasonry in Romania|Romanian Freemasonry]]: he stood by the dissident Masons who pledged allegiance to [[Masonic Lodge Officers|Grand Masters]] [[George Valentin Bibescu]] and [[Grigore C. Grigoriu]]; from 1945, he was himself a Deputy Grand Master.&lt;ref name="msmessage"/&gt; Reputedly, it was him who advised Grigoriu and [[Mihail Noradunghian]] to send this [[Masonic Lodge]] into "sleep", as a means to preempt [[Suppression of Freemasonry|communist suppression]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://www.evz.ro/detalii/stiri/masonii-din-romania-pro-sau-contra-intereselor-nationale-603879.html "Masonii din România - PRO sau CONTRA intereselor naționale"], in ''[[Evenimentul Zilei]]'', February 13, 1998&lt;/ref&gt; In old age, he rediscovered Romanian Orthodoxy. He made arrangements for his parents to be reburied in Sighișoara, recognized all his illegitimate children, and, on his death bed, demanded to be buried with an [[Christian burial|Orthodox service]] performed by his old friend Galaction.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt;

Cocea's image with his two friends Galaction and Arghezi had a more shady side. Cocea himself divulged Arghezi's private anti-communism in his 1946 report to the PCR overseers, recording that Arghezi rejected offers for collaboration with sarcasm and pride.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; Arghezi's own private notes, and some of his published lampoons, contain some biting remarks about Cocea's communist career.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} Radu Bogdan, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Alte-capricii-de-poet*articleID_3024-articles_details.html "Alte capricii de poet"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 121, June 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="stegalact"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Stelian Tănase]], [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Pe-tatal-meu-denuntul-nu-l-a-afectat-cu-nimic-era-intotdeauna-bine-dispus.-Dialog-cu-Elena-Galaction*articleID_12785-articles_details.html " 'Pe tatăl meu denunțul nu l-a afectat cu nimic, era întotdeauna bine dispus'.

==Literary work==

===Satirist===
In George Călinescu's definition, Cocea was "more of a [[Yellow journalism|yellow journalist]] than a talented one".&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Reviewing ''Fecior de slugă'' for ''[[Gând Românesc]]'' magazine in October 1933, cultural journalist C. Pastia sarcastically commented that Cocea's lampoons had "taught boys how to curse", in which action he identified the Cocea's lifelong objective.&lt;ref name="pastia289"/&gt; Similar assessments were later passed by other authors and researchers. [[Paul Cernat]] described Cocea the pamphleteer as "feared" and "vitriolic",&lt;ref name="pc29"/&gt; while [[Stelian Tănase]] summarized his writing as "sharp, polemical and vulgar".&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; Likewise, critic [[Mihai Zamfir]] calls Cocea's [[Republicanism|republican]] pamphlets "filthy", accusing them of promoting, together with the "stupid little poems" of the much older [[Alexandru Vlahuță]], a distorted image of the Romanian monarchy.&lt;ref name="mzstapini"&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mihai Zamfir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/stpni_i_supui "Stăpîni și supuși"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 5/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Stelian Tănase also notes that Cocea resorted in [[blackmail]], just like his ex-pupil turned rival [[Pamfil Șeicaru]], but that he was less interested than Șeicaru in accumulating fortunes.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; Cocea himself was vexed by Șeicaru's style. In his definition, it was the literary equivalent of "[[postilion]] curses".&lt;ref name="nmmoralitati"/&gt;

The harsh pronouncements on Cocea's journalistic contributions are nuanced or contradicted by other writers and critics. [[Scarlat Callimachi]] spoke of his comrade, the "feared polemicist", as in reality "a good man" of "amazing generosity", and, stylistically, "a poet": "Even in his most violent articles one finds glimpses of true poetry."&lt;ref name="sc46-47"/&gt; The latter trait, Callimachi assessed, survived no matter how hard Cocea trained himself to repress it.&lt;ref name="sc46"&gt;Callimachi, p.46&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's skill was emphasized by his foe, Comarnescu, who believed Cocea to be a "semi-failure" as an intellectual, but also a "joker" of genius.&lt;ref name="ascomarnescu"/&gt; According to Pastia: "no one in [[Literature of Romania|Romanian literature]] has ever speculated [[paradox]] with as much courage and talent."&lt;ref name="pastia289"/&gt; Writing in 1936, the young ''[[Facla]]'' essayist [[Eugène Ionesco]] (later a world-famous playwright), listed Cocea and Arghezi among the "peaks" of an older generation, as Romania's two "greatest lampoonists".&lt;ref&gt;[[Eugène Ionesco]], [http://www.plural-magazine.com/article_on-the-generation-in-shambles-1936.html "On the Generation in Shambles, 1936"], in the [[Romanian Cultural Institute]]'s ''[http://www.plural-magazine.com/ Plural Magazine]'', Nr. 29/2007&lt;/ref&gt; Various other authors have also seen in Cocea a founding figure of the more satirical and politically aware side of modern [[Romanian humor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Radu Cosașu]], [http://www.dilemaveche.ro/sectiune/la-centru-si-la-margine/articol/blestemul-telegramelor-havas "Blestemul telegramelor Havas"], in ''[[Dilema Veche]]'', Nr. 194, October 2007; Mihaela Mureșan, [http://www.studia.ubbcluj.ro/download/pdf/355.pdf "Pamfletul ca text jurnalistic inedit"], in the [[Babeș-Bolyai University]]'s ''Ephemerides'', Nr. 1/2008, p.112, 115; Ion Vasile Șerban, [http://www.observatorcultural.ro/Pamfletul-intre-fond-si-forma*articleID_3739-articles_details.html "Pamfletul între fond și formă"], in ''[[Observator Cultural]]'', Nr. 50, February 2001; Val Talpalaru, [http://convorbiri-literare.dntis.ro/PRESAiul10.html "ComPresa Revistelor"], in ''[[Convorbiri Literare]]'', July 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Poet-Poetă''===
Cocea's youthful debut with ''Poet-Poetă'' was his homage to [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolist]] [[prose poetry]], colored with a strongly erotic tinge. According to George Călinescu, the book, "vehemently [[Priapism|priapic]] and monotonous in its excess", borrows its tone from [[Alexandru Macedonski]], its titillating subject from [[Pierre Louÿs]], and its plot from [[Mihai Eminescu]] (the novel ''Cezara'').&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; The protagonists of ''Poet-Poetă'', Iulius and Ersilia, living on love and desire, discover each other's bodies and then the joy of dying of one's own volition, hurling themselves off a precipice.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Writing in 1911, [[Ilarie Chendi]] noted that the book was Cocea's first known blunder, speculating that literary failure had relegated Cocea to the promotion of other, more talented, Symbolists.&lt;ref name="icvieata"/&gt;

Călinescu sees the positive aspect of ''Poet-Poetă'' in its "delicate description" of the human form (Ersilia's hair, for instance, is ''stofă fără preț'', "priceless fabric").&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Fellow literary historian and critic [[Ștefan Cazimir]] has included Cocea's work among the Symbolist novels directly influenced by [[Vienna Secession]] art and the Secessionists' feminization of nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ștefan Cazimir]], [http://www.romlit.ro/secesionismul_n_literatura_romn_vi "Secesionismul în literatura română" (VI)], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 13-14/1999&lt;/ref&gt; Such traits also stand out in Galaction's biblical preface, a new ''[[Song of Songs]]'': "Ersilia's eyes are as green as the depths of the ponds at [[Heshbon]]; and her breasts like twin does grazing among the lilies."&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; These interventions were held against Galaction by literary historian [[Eugen Lovinescu]] (an outspoken adversary of the ''Viața Socială'' writers): "A militant Orthodox, [Galaction] prefaced in his youth novels which defile all things sacred".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/istoria_unei_antipatii__e._lovinescu_i_gala_galaction "Istoria unei antipatii – E. Lovinescu și Gala Galaction"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 47/2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908, when he castigated both Symbolism and "perverted eroticism", Cocea left a detailed list of authors he considered "degenerate" and "bourgeois": [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]], [[Alexandre Dumas, fils|Dumas-fils]], [[Maurice Maeterlinck]], [[Anna de Noailles]], [[Georges Ohnet]], [[Marcel Prévost]], and [[Oscar Wilde]].&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.101&lt;/ref&gt; According to literary historian [[Angelo Mitchievici]], the substance of such "class-based criticism" was equivalent to the [[biological determinism]] of Cocea's nationalist adversaries, announcing the absolutes of fascism ("[[degenerate art]]") and communism (the [[Zhdanov Doctrine]]).&lt;ref&gt;Mitchievici, p.102&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Vinul de viață lungă''===
''Vinul de viață lungă'' is considered by some to be Cocea's main work as a novelist.&lt;ref name="bc179"&gt;Camboulives, p.179&lt;/ref&gt; The main character, Manole Arcaș, is, like Cocea himself, a Moldavian boyar. Successive episodes in the book reveal his complex worldview: Arcaș is an [[Atheism|atheist]] with modernist sensibilities, a lover of nature, and a [[utopian socialist]] who has been turning his estate into a [[commune]].&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p.179-182&lt;/ref&gt; Having reached a venerable age, he slowly reveals the secret of his longevity in conversations with the much younger judge: after decades of experimentation, the Arcaș estate produces a special sort of [[Moldavian wine]]; the grapes were [[Pressed (wine)|pressed]] by Manole and a [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani (Gypsy)]] girl, in the course of their love-making.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Camboulives, p.182&lt;/ref&gt; The object of Arcaș' [[Sexual fetishism|olfactory fetish]], the girl has died a tragic death, inspiring Manole to take up the winery project as a sort of symbolic rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Camboulives, p.182-183&lt;/ref&gt;

With its aesthetics and its tone, ''Vinul de viață lungă'' is an unusual sample of militant literature, contrasting with the work of socialist or [[Poporanism|Poporanist]] writers from Cocea's lifetime. French historian Bernard Camboulives notes that Cocea made a point of reacting against Poporanists' call to preserve "Romanian specificity".&lt;ref name="bc179"/&gt; Similarly, George Călinescu notes that the Poporanist setting is given an original twist in Cocea's novel, with the erotic interludes.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; As Callimachi writes, the book is a rare moment in which Cocea the poet vanquished Cocea the journalist,&lt;ref name="sc46"/&gt; while Camboulives sees in it "a eulogy to life, to love, to the senses and to the most elevated thoughts".&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p.183&lt;/ref&gt; In Călinescu's more skeptical interpretation, it merely stands for "a journalistic narrative, with the stylistic decency of well-read men", its author being less than a "creator", its dialogues just "chatter".&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt;

===''Fecior de slugă'', ''Pentr-un petec...'', ''Nea Nae''===
During the [[interwar period]], Cocea could at times register significant success, but it was largely owed to the scandalous nature of his novels. The issue was taken into consideration by Călinescu, who referred to Cocea's "exaggerated, but explainable" popularity.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; C. Pastia also suspected Cocea of pulling a prank, "leaving the impression that he had dedicated himself to literature" in ''Vinul de viață lungă'', and then returning to the political stage with novel-lampoons.&lt;ref name="pastia289"/&gt; Cocea also found critics among his fellow modernists: writing in 1935, modernist critic [[Lucian Boz]] created a separation between the "[[Pornography|pornographic]] novels" of Cocea or [[D. V. Barnoschi]], which "have [[orgasm]] as their goal", and the controversial but "brave" literature of [[James Joyce]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Lucian Boz]], [http://documente.bcucluj.ro/web/bibdigit/periodice/societateademaine/pdf/BCUCLUJ_FP_279802_1935_012_005.pdf "Discuții și recenzii.

''Fecior de slugă'', the first of Cocea's [[political novel]]s, takes its artistic inspiration from the ''[[fin de siècle]]'' novelist [[Duiliu Zamfirescu]], creator of the social climbing prototype [[Dinu Păturică]].&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Pastia, p.289&lt;/ref&gt; Cocea's Dinu is Tănase Bojogeanu, the "son of the servant" referred to in the book's title. As a child, he is shown competing in school with Nelu Azan, the daydreaming aristocrat, profiting from Azan's generosity and overtaking him in many respects.&lt;ref&gt;Călinescu, p.919; Pastia, p.289-290&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Nelu preserves ideals which lead him into the communist movement, Tănase, the corrupt clerk, rises through the ranks to become King's Commissioner.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; The two are pitted against each other, their ideological conflict made worse when Bojogeanu sells a young female communist into [[sexual slavery]].&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt;

Present throughout the work are masked portrayals of Cocea's political allies and adversaries. Pastia, who described such cameos as both cartoonish and interesting, identified [[Alexandru Averescu]], [[Ion I. C. Brătianu]], [[Constantin Dobrogeanu-Gherea]], [[I. C. Frimu]], [[Dumitru Iliescu-Turtucaia]], [[Take Ionescu]], [[Nicolae Iorga]] and some others.&lt;ref&gt;Pastia, p.289, 290&lt;/ref&gt; Pastia also suggests that the central theme (Bojogeanu as the [[bourgeois]] suffocating ancient boyardom) is conventional and ultimately irrelevant: "That may well be, and we agree that our morals may tolerate the decay of the Azans and the ascent of the Bojogeanus. But this did not a novel make. An issue of ''Facla'' would have sufficed."&lt;ref name="pastia290"&gt;Pastia, p.290&lt;/ref&gt; Călinescu spoke with displeasure about ''Fecior de slugă'' as an illustration of Cocea's "strident, violent style, excessively vulgar and of a sexuality that is never redeemed by a hint of whatever is eternally human."&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Pastia however found that Cocea wrote his book with noticeable talent "in rendering that which is vulgar", a Romanian answer to [[Charles Baudelaire]]'s ''[[Les Fleurs du mal]]''.&lt;ref name="pastia290"/&gt;

''Pentr-un petec de negreață'', with its name borrowed from peri-urban [[Romanian folklore]],&lt;ref name="ammundus"/&gt; shows its male protagonist Andrei Vaia alternating between dreams of [[free love]] in the countryside and the adulation of Bucharest as a hotspot of erotic pursuits. Of the adventures depicted, some are believed to have been modeled on Cocea's own sexual exploits.&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ammundus"/&gt; A pivotal moment in the novel shows Andrei discovering that his Bucharest lover, Mira, is cheating on him with the hunchback Bergher, who has purchased her attentions with stockings and silk.&lt;ref name="ammundus"/&gt; Through Vaia's monologues, the book gives Cocea's views about the female psyche and bodily needs, the supposedly eternal insecurity of men, and the mystery of female orgasm.&lt;ref name="ammundus"/&gt; ''Pentr-un petec...'' doubled as a barely disguised satire of the interwar political class, in this case specifically directed at the [[National Peasants' Party]]—according to Călinescu, this was Cocea's selling tactic, as were its advertised depictions of "fornication" and "sexual abnormalities", or its licentious quotation from the [[Book of Proverbs]].&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt;

In ''Nea Nae'', the eponymous protagonist is a boorish and thick potentate, always on the hunt for "beastly erotic pleasures" (Călinescu), sometimes accompanied by thinly disguised political figures of the interwar.&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt; Călinescu was especially critical of Nae's speech patterns, caricatured "without the gifts of the [[picturesque]]".&lt;ref name="gc919"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Cocea greatly influenced the journalistic style of young Ion Vinea&lt;ref name="isserviciul"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pcrisipitor"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cernat, ''Avangarda'', p.63, 98, 107, 130, 132, 133-134, 140, 220&lt;/ref&gt; and Scarlat Callimachi.&lt;ref name="sc46-47"/&gt; In addition to his presence in the memoirs or diaries of his friends and enemies, Cocea is the republican revolutionist in ''Cronică de familie'' ("Family Chronicle"), by the communist writer [[Petru Dumitriu]]—a text allegedly plagiarized from Vinea's unpublished works.&lt;ref name="ivdumitriu"/&gt; Among the better-known visual portrayals of Cocea is a 1928 ink drawing by [[Marcel Janco]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.europeana.eu/portal/record/05812/0B465782A754869FF277BE56050C2B79CED2B15B.html ''Portretul scriitorului N.D. Cocea''], [[Europeana]] entry; retrieved February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of N. D. Cocea's writings enjoyed a good standing throughout [[Communist Romania|Romania's communist period]]. During the early 1960s, official textbooks described him as one of those who covered the gap between 19th-century [[Literary realism|Realism]] and [[Socialist realism in Romania|Romanian Socialist Realism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Ion Simuț]], [http://www.romlit.ro/canonul_literar_proletcultist_ii "Canonul literar proletcultist" (II)], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 28/2008&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, the communist regime overplayed Cocea's criticism of the Romanian monarchy, glorifying him as someone who had undermined the credibility of [[Michael I of Romania|Michael I]] and his predecessors.&lt;ref name="gpproces"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mzstapini"/&gt; In one instance, communist historiography even claimed that Cocea and Arghezi had served time for their 1912 anti-monarchy campaign, taking ''Facla'' lampoons at face value.&lt;ref name="gpproces"/&gt; Cocea's World War II diaries were passed on to his relatives in Switzerland, and have not been published except for the short fragments hosted in the 1960s by two Romanian reviews: ''[[Magazin Istoric]]''&lt;ref name="stamoral1"/&gt; and ''[[Secolul XX]]''.&lt;ref name="mseisenstein"/&gt; In 1970, an edition of his ''Jurnal'' ("Diary") was issued by the PCR's [[Editura Politică]].&lt;ref name="giflupu"/&gt; A previously unknown novel by Cocea was signaled in the late 1970s, and noted for its virulent attacks on [[Pamfil Șeicaru]].&lt;ref name="nmmoralitati"/&gt;

Cocea's literature and political controversy were also publicized outside Romania. From his refuge in [[Francoist Spain]], Șeicaru made public his decades-long polemic with Cocea. His repeated talk about Cocea's immorality prompted literary historian [[Nicolae Manolescu]] to note a paradox: "It is somewhat strange to see accusations of immorality being launched by people who, beyond their talent [...], do not even possess the most basic moral sense. The mere fact that the pamphlets they hurl at each other, like hogwash, have morality as their stake (never their own, always the other's), should make one think."&lt;ref name="nmmoralitati"/&gt; A [[French-language]] translation of ''Vinul de viață lungă'' was published by Jean de Palacio (''Le Vin de longue vie'', Le Serpent à Plumes, 2000).&lt;ref&gt;Camboulives, p.183, 374&lt;/ref&gt; According to Romanian literary critic [[Mircea Iorgulescu]], the positive reception of such works in France "would probably astound the Romanian literary environment, for whom Cocea hardly even exists."&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Mircea Iorgulescu]], [http://www.cuvantul.ro/articol/?artID=5&amp;nr=338 "Literatura română văzută de la Paris"], in ''[[Cuvântul (literary magazine)|Cuvântul]]'', Nr. 338, August 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Streets named after Cocea exist in Bucharest, Sighișoara, [[Brașov]], [[Oradea]], [[Sibiu]] and [[Timișoara]]. His residence in Sighișoara is preserved by the local authorities as a "memorial house".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [http://adrcentru.ro/Document_Files/turismul%20cultural_2ttj6s.pdf ''Regiunea 7 Centru: Turismul cultural''], [[Centru (development region)|Centru]] Agency for Regional Development, p.9; retrieved February 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The same city is home to the N.

'''Noisy investigations''' are used by the [[Church of Scientology]] to intimidate, harass, and attack their enemies. The Church used to openly label such people as [[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]].  The goal of a noisy investigation may not be to find out anything, but to harass the person being investigated.  The procedure is to contact friends, neighbours, co-workers, etc. and inform them that they are investigating crimes by the target person.&lt;ref&gt;Atack, Jon [http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/apobs/bs4-5.htm A Piece of Blue Sky, Chapter 5: Hubbard's Travels] © Jon Atack 1990. (convenience link provided by Xenu.net)&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1966 Hubbard Communications Office Executive Letter entitled "How to do a NOISY Investigation" described the practice as follows: "You find out where he or she works or worked, ''doctor'', dentist, friends, neighbours, ''anyone'', and 'phone 'em up and say, 'I am investigating Mr/Mrs .......... for criminal activities as he/she has been trying to prevent Man's freedom and is restricting my religious freedom and that of my friends and children, etc'".&lt;ref&gt;HCO Executive Letter, 5 September 1966; reprinted in [[Foster Report|The Foster Report]], p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref    name="PCSoS-C9"&gt;Cooper, Paulette [http://www.clambake.org/archive/books/tsos/sos-09.html#c11 ''The Scandal of Scientology'' Chapter 9: ''Attacking the Attackers''] Copyright © 1971 (convenience link by Xenu.net)&lt;/ref&gt; The investigation may also be done by hired detectives.

A memo, reprinted in the British paper "People", said: "We want at least one bad mark on every psychiatrist in England, a murder, an assault, or a rape or more than one.... This is Project Psychiatry. We will remove them."&lt;ref    name="PCSoS-C9" /&gt;

Some [[Scientology|Scientologists]] claim that their policy of "[[Fair Game (Scientology)|Fair Game]]" is no longer in effect, but critics of the Church maintain that whether the rule is still written in Scientology policy or not, the policy is still adhered to today. Some ex-Scientologists have claimed that the cancellation of the policy only cancelled the use of the words "fair game" and did not change the actual policy.

==Description==
Pulque is a milk-colored, somewhat [[Viscosity|viscous]] liquid that produces a light foam.  It is made by fermenting the [[sap]] of certain types of maguey (agave) plants. In contrast, [[mezcal]] is made from the cooked heart of certain agave plants, and [[tequila]], a variety of mezcal, is made all or mostly from the [[blue agave]]. About six varieties of maguey are best used for the production of pulque.&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;{{cite news  |title= Aztecs' Sacred Drink Pulque Losing Out to Beer in Mexico |url= http://www.medindia.net/news/Aztecs-Sacred-Drink-Pulque-Losing-Out-to-Beer-in-Mexico-29730-1.htm   |agency=Medindia |date=2007-11-23 |accessdate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; The name ''pulque'' is derived from [[Nahuatl]]. The original name of the drink was ''iztāc octli'' {{IPA-nah|ˈistaːk ˈokt͡ɬi|}} (white pulque), the term pulque was probably mistakenly derived by the Spanish from the ''octli poliuhqui'' {{IPA-nah|ˈokt͡ɬi poˈliwki|}}, which meant "spoiled pulque".&lt;ref name="restaurantes"&gt;{{cite web  |title=El pulque, bebida de los dioses |url=http://www.restaurantesdemexico.com.mx/249/Vinos_y_Bebidas_El_Pulque__Bebida_De_Los_Dioses.html  |publisher=Restaurantes de Mexico |trans-title=Pulque: The Drink of the Gods |language=Spanish |doi= |date=2009-09-13  |accessdate=13 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Maguey==
[[File:Maguey.jpg|thumb|Close up of a maguey plant]]
The maguey plant, also called a "century plant" in English, is native to Mexico. It grows best in the cold, dry climates of the rocky central highlands to the north and east of [[Mexico City]], especially in the states of [[Hidalgo (state)|Hidalgo]] and [[Tlaxcala]]. Maguey has been cultivated at least since 200 CE in [[Tula, Hidalgo|Tula]], [[Tulancingo]] and [[Teotihuacan]], and wild plants have been exploited for far longer. The plant historically has had a number of uses. Fibers can be extracted from the thick leaves to make rope or fabric, its thorns can be used as needles or punches and the membrane covering the leaves can be used as paper or for cooking.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"&gt;{{cite web |first=Beatriz |last=Oliver Vega |title=El uso de maguey |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6844-El-uso-del-maguey |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |trans-title=Use of Maguey |language=Spanish |date=April–May 1995 |accessdate=13 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090417030644/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6844-El-uso-del-maguey |archivedate=17 April 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The name ''maguey'' was given by the Spanish, who picked it up from the [[Taíno people|Taíno]]. This is still its common name in Spanish, with ''Agave'' being its scientific generic or technical name. The [[Nahuatl]] name of the plant is ''metl''.&lt;ref name="soumaya"&gt;{{cite web |first=Mónica López |last=Velarde Estrada |title=El Descubrimiento del Pulque |url=http://www.soumaya.com.mx/navegar/anteriores/anteriores05/febrero/edp.html |publisher=Soumaya Museum |location=Mexico City |trans-title=The Discovery of Pulque |language=Spanish |accessdate=3 April 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218233426/http://www.soumaya.com.mx/navegar/anteriores/anteriores05/febrero/edp.html |archivedate=18 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The manufacturing process of pulque is complex and required the death of the maguey plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=May 2009|publisher=Gotham Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the plant nears maturity, the center begins to swell and elongate as the plant gathers stored sugar to send up a single flower stalk, which may reach up to 20 feet in height. However, plants destined for pulque production have this flower stalk cut off, leaving a depressed surface 12-18&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter. In this center, the maguey sap, known as ''[[aguamiel]]'' (honeywater), collects.&lt;ref name="barrios"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |pages=28–31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It takes a maguey plant 12 years to mature enough to produce the sap for pulque.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"&gt;{{cite web |agency=Notimex |title= Tlaxcala organiza recorridos por haciendas pulqueras |website=El Universal.mx |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/624389.html |trans-title=Tlaxcala organized tours of pulque haciendas |language=Spanish |date=4 September 2009 |accessdate=3 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Mythological origins===
[[File:Mayahuel 1.jpg|thumb|Depiction of the goddess Mayahuel]]

Pulque has been drunk for at least 1,000 years, and its origins are the subject of various stories and myths. Most involve [[Mayahuel]], the goddess of the maguey. It was thought that the aguamiel collecting in the center of the plant was her blood. Other deities, such as the [[Centzon Totochtin]] (400 rabbits) are associated with it, by representing the drink's effects, and are the children of Mayahuel.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;  Another version involving ''Mayahuel'' has her as a mortal woman who discovered how to collect aguamiel but someone named ''Pantecatl'' {{IPA-nah|panˈtekat͡ɬ|}} discovered how to make pulque.&lt;ref name="soumaya"/&gt;

According to another story, pulque was discovered by the ''Tlacuache'' {{IPA-nah|t͡ɬaˈkʷat͡ʃe|}} ([[opossum]]), who used his human-like hands to dig into the maguey and extract the naturally fermenting juice. He became the first drunk. ''Tlacuache'' was thought to set the course of rivers.  The rivers he set were generally straight except when he was drunk. Then they follow ''Tlacuache's'' meandering path from cantina to cantina.{{cn|date=December 2016}}

Another account traces the discovery of aguamiel to the [[Toltec Empire]], when a noble named Papantzin was trying to get the emperor to marry his daughter [[Xochitl (Toltec)|Xochitl]]. He sent her to the capital with an offering of ''aguamiel'', honey of the agave plant. The emperor and princess wed, and their son was named ''Meconetzin'' {{IPA-nah|mekoˈnet͡sin|}} (maguey son).&lt;ref name="Xochitl"&gt;{{cite news |first=Edmundo  |last=Domínguez Aragonés |title=Xiuhtlaltzin, primera reina tolteca y Xóchitl, reina tolteca descubridora del pulque  |trans-title=Xiuhtlaltzin, the first Toltec queen and Xochitl, the Toltec queen who discovered pulque |url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldemexico/notas/n564920.htm |newspaper=El Sol de Mexico |location=Mexico City  |date= 2008-01-20 |accessdate=13 September 2009 |language=Spanish  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In other versions of the story, Xochitl is credited with discovering pulque.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

===Pre-Hispanic period===
[[File:Codex_Mendoza_folio_61r.jpg|thumb|left|[[Codex Mendoza]], an early 16th-century manuscript, showing Aztec elders and pulque in a vessel (lower center)]]
[[File:El descubrimiento del pulque, por José María Obregón.jpg|thumb|right|225px|''The discovery of pulque'' by nineteenth-century Mexican painter José Obregón.]]
The maguey was one of the most sacred and important plants in ancient Mexico. It had a privileged place in mythology, religious rituals and the Mesoamerican economy.  Pulque appears in a number of graphic representations from pre-colonial times, beginning with stone carvings from about 200 CE. The first major work involving pulque is a large mural called the "Pulque Drinkers", unearthed in 1968 at the [[Great Pyramid of Cholula|pyramid of Cholula]], [[Puebla]]. The most likely means of the discovery of aguamiel and fermented pulque was from the observation of rodents who gnaw and scratch at the plant to drink the seeping sap. Fermentation of the aguamiel can take place within the plant itself.&lt;ref name="barrios1013"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |pages=10–13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the indigenous peoples of the central highlands of Mexico, the imbibing of pulque was done only by certain people, under certain conditions. It was a ritual drink, consumed during certain festivals, such as that of the goddess Mayahuel, and the god [[Mixcoatl]]. It was drunk by priests and sacrificial victims, to increase the priests' enthusiasm and to ease the suffering of the victim.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; There are many references in [[Aztec]] codices, such as the Borbonicus Codex, of pulque's use by nobility and priesthood to celebrate victories. Among commoners, it was permitted only to the elderly and pregnant women.&lt;ref name="barrios18"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of pulque was ritualized and the brewers were superstitious. They would abstain from sex during the fermentation period because they believed that sexual intercourse would sour the process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gately|first1=Iain|title=Drink: A Cultural History of Alcohol|date=May 2009|publisher=Gotham Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-592-40464-3|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Colonial period===

After the Conquest, pulque lost its sacred character, and both indigenous and Spanish people began to drink it.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; The Spanish initially made no laws regarding its use. It became a lucrative source of tax revenue, but by 1672, public drunkenness had become enough of a problem that the viceregal government created regulations to curtail its consumption. A maximum of 36 "[[pulqueria]]s" were permitted for Mexico City, which had to be located in open areas, be without doors and close at sundown. Food, music, dancing and the co-mingling of the sexes was prohibited. However, pulque continued to play a major role in the socioeconomic history of Mexico during colonial times and in the early years of [[Mexican War of Independence|Independence]]. Through this period, it was the fourth largest source of tax revenue.&lt;ref name="barrios2022"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |pages=20–22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 17th century, the [[Jesuits]] began large-scale production of the drink to finance its educational institutions. In this way, the making of pulque passed from being a home-made brew to one commercially produced.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

=== Drunkenness in casta painting ===

The [[casta]] system of racial hierarchy was created in Spanish America for elites to classify individuals into groups based on phenotype and perceived social class, and give them characteristics that were supposedly inherent to their group. Often artists portrayed mixed-race castas. This form of [[Mexican art]] portrayed castas in settings that were typical of their social group. The portrayal of pulque was used to show polarization between different castas.  Before the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas]], pulque was used for religious ceremonies in [[Mesoamerica]].&lt;ref&gt;William B. Taylor. ''Drinking, Homicide, and Rebellion in Colonial Mexican Villages''. Stanford: Stanford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the arrival of the Spanish, consumption was widespread among Indigenous Americans and mixed-race castas. This led to many social problems including sexual crimes and violence within the population.

In casta painting, pulque depicted situations the Europeans saw as characteristic of the castas they portrayed. Some of these paintings incorporated images of indigenous Americans and Africans as drunk with bottles appearing in the scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bristol|first=Joan|title=You Are What You Drink? Tequila, Maguey and Mexican Identity|url=http://www.globality-gmu.net/archives/2380|publisher=George Mason University|accessdate=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is a reason that "shortly after the conquests, colonial officials declared pulque abuse and Indian drunkenness a major concern and committed themselves to addressing its impacts on society".{{attribution needed|date=September 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kasiak|first=Neil Robert|title=Fermenting Identities: Race and Pulque Politics in Mexico City between 1519 and 1754|journal=Online Theses and Dissertations|year=2012|issue=Paper 68}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, some casta painters depicted different castas safely consuming and selling pulque.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University|location=New Haven|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other casta painters depicted Indigenous Americans intoxicated in the streets, and incapacitated which as a result required their families to escort them home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Katzew|first=Ilona|title=Casta Painting|year=2004|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|page=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Casta painting was used as a method of social commentary on the destructive use of pulque in everyday society. As the Spanish attempted to crack down on pulque, some casta painters depicted indigenous Americans in safe environments where even children were able to consume pulque. The paintings were meant to show that Spanish regulation was effective in controlling the consumption and distribution of pulque in the colonial period.

===Post colonial period===
[[File:Pulqueria en tacubaya.jpg|thumb|left|A [[pulqueria]] in [[Tacubaya]] in the 1880s]]
Production of pulque exploded after Independence, when the regulation of pulque producers ended, and Mexican nationalism increased.&lt;ref name="soumaya"/&gt; From then until the 1860s, pulque [[hacienda]]s multiplied, especially in Hidalgo and Tlaxcala states. In 1866, the first railway between [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] and Mexico City began operations, crossing through Hidalgo. This line was soon known as the "Pulque Train" because it brought supplies of the drink daily to the capital. This production and easy shipment of the drink made Hidalgo rich, and gave rise to a "pulque aristocracy" made up of some of the most powerful families of this time: Torres Adalid, Pimenta y Fagoaga, Macedo and others. At its peak, there were about 300 pulque haciendas. Some still remain in the plains of [[Apan]] and [[Zempoala, Hidalgo|Zempoala]], in Hidalgo.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mexdes"/&gt; Pulque hit its peak of popularity during the late 19th century, when it was enjoyed by rich and poor alike.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt; As late as 1953, Hidalgo and Tlaxcala still obtained 30 and 50% respectively of their total revenues from pulque. This has diminished since then since irrigation, roads and other infrastructure has made possible other, more lucrative enterprises.&lt;ref name="barriosp38"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |page=38 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
In spite of its former popularity, pulque represents only 10% of the alcoholic beverages consumed in Mexico today.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; Pulque is still consumed in Mexico, mostly in the central highlands and predominantly in rural and poor areas. It has acquired a general connotation of being something for the lower class, while consumption of European-style beer flourished throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name="brewers"&gt;{{cite news |title=Brewers sought to disparage pulque |url=http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=22910&amp;tabla=miami |agency=Wire Services |newspaper=El Universal |location=Miami |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=12 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615062222/http://www2.eluniversal.com.mx/pls/impreso/noticia.html?id_nota=22910&amp;tabla=miami |archivedate=15 June 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The complex and delicate fermentation process of pulque had always limited the product's distribution, as it does not keep long and agitation during transport speeds degradation. Since pre-Hispanic times, its consumption has mostly been limited to the central highlands of Mexico.&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;

The decline of pulque began in the first decade of the 20th century, when the [[Mexican Revolution]] caused a decline in its production.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; In the 1930s, the government of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] campaigned against pulque, as part of an effort to reduce alcoholic consumption in general. But the most decisive factor to the decline of pulque has been the introduction of beer.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt;&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;

European immigrant beer brewers in the early 20th century had their own campaign against the native pulque, claiming that pulque producers used a ''muñeca'' (doll), a textile bag containing human or animal feces which was placed in the ''aguamiel'' to hasten the fermentation process. Some pulque producers have insisted that the ''muñeca'' is completely a myth, but modern historians suggest that it did happen, although only rarely.&lt;ref name="MacClancyHenry2009"&gt;{{cite book |author1= Jeremy M. MacClancy |author2= C.J.K. Henry |author3= Jeya Henry |author4= Helen Macbeth |title= Consuming the Inedible: Neglected Dimensions of Food Choice |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GSKrAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA215 |year=2009 |publisher= Berghahn Books |isbn= 978-1-84545-684-9 |pages= 215–221}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beer producers promoted the idea that pulque was generally made this way, generally by word of mouth and insinuation. This was done to inhibit pulque sales and to promote the consumption of beer, which they claimed was "rigorously hygienic and modern".&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mentira"&gt;{{cite news  |title= Mentira que se use excremento para elaborar pulque |url=http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/254842.mentira-que-se-use-excremento-para-elaborar-p.html |newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon |location=Torreon, Coahuila |date=2007-01-11 |accessdate=12 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strategy proved successful, with pulque now generally looked-down-upon and imbibed by relatively few people, with Mexican-brewed beer ubiquitous and extremely popular.&lt;ref name="brewers"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mentira"/&gt; Pulque's popularity is low and continues to fall. Twenty years ago, about 20 trucks would come every three days to [[Xochimilco]] (in southern Mexico City) to deliver pulque, but now the number is down to one or two. Only five pulquerias remain in this district, where there used to be 18.&lt;ref name="sacred"/&gt; The situation is similar in most other parts of Mexico, as well. The remaining pulquerias are very small establishments, selling a product made by small producers.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

In the state of Hidalgo, in which most maguey is grown, fields of this plant are disappearing, with barley taking its place. Most maguey plants here serve as boundary markers between properties. Many of these plants do not survive long, as they are often vandalized. An estimated 10,000 plants are mutilated each week by cutting off the lower leaves for [[barbacoa]] or destroying them completely to look for the edible white grubs or ant eggs that can inhabit them.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

==Production==
[[File:Campos de Maguey.jpg|thumb|A field of maguey]]
The production process is long and delicate.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt; The maguey plant needs 12 years of maturation before the sap, or ''aguamiel'', can be extracted, but a good plant can produce for up to one year.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt; This aguamiel can be drunk straight, but it is alcoholic only after a fermentation process that can start in the plant itself.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; This liquid is collected twice a day from the plant, yielding about five or six liters per day. Today, this liquid is collected with a steel scoop, but in the past, an elongated gourd was used as a tube to suck the juice out. Between gatherings, the plant's leaves are bent over the center where the juice collects to keep out bugs and dirt. This center is regularly scraped out to keep the plant's production of sap active. Most maguey plants produce this ''aguamiel'' for about four to six months before they finally die.&lt;ref name="whatis"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barrios"/&gt; Some plants can yield up to 600 [[Litre|L]] of pulque. &lt;!-- pp. 72 --&gt;&lt;ref name="Tompkins" &gt;Tompkins, P. (1976). Mysteries of the Mexican pyramids. Fitzhenry &amp; Whiteside Limited: Toronto. {{ISBN|0-06-014324-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The collected juice is placed into 50-liter barrels and carried from the field to the fermentation vats. These vats, called ''tinas'', are located in a special building called a ''tinacal''. This word derives from Spanish ''tina'' and Nahuatl ''calli'' that means house of vats. When pulque haciendas reached their peak in the late 19th century, hacienda life revolved around these ''tinacals''. It typically was a rectangular shed of stone with a wooden roof. The upper parts of the walls opened for air circulation and the façades were sometimes decorated with indigenous designs or other images associated with the making of pulque. One popular motif was the discovery of pulque by Xochitl. Other popular elements were the images of the hacienda's patron saint and the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]. Inside were the vats, which were cowhide stretched over wooden frames lined up against the walls. In larger ''tinacals'', there were three or four rows of vats. Today, the ''tinas'' are made of oak, plastic or [[fiberglass]] and hold about 1,000 liters each.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;&lt;ref name="barrios"/&gt;

[[Image:1964 Tlachiquero Hidalgo Mexico.jpg|thumb|A ''tlachiquero'' collecting maguey juice (1964, Hidalgo, Mexico)]]
After placing the juice in the fermentation vats, mature seed pulque (''semilla'' or ''xanaxtli'') is added to "jump start" the process. Unlike beer, the fermenting agent present in pulque is a bacterium of the species ''[[Zymomonas mobilis]]'' (syn. ''Thermobacterium mobile'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.uniprot.org/taxonomy/542|title=Zymomonas mobilis|website=www.uniprot.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;) rather than yeast. Those in charge of the fermentation process guard their trade secrets, passing them on from father to son. Fermentation takes from seven to 14 days, and the process seems to be more art than science. A number of factors can affect fermenting pulque, such as temperature, humidity and the quality of the ''aguamiel''.&lt;ref name="barrios"/&gt;

The process is complex and delicate, and can go sour at any point. For this reason, and perhaps due to its ancient "sacred" character, there are rituals and prohibitions. Religious songs and prayers may be offered, and women, children and strangers are not allowed inside the ''tinacal''.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; Other superstitions include those against eating canned fish and wearing a hat inside the tinacal. The first is claimed to cause a bad taste in the pulque and the second is considered bad luck. To cleanse the bad luck, the offender must fill the hat with pulque and drink it down.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;

Just before the peak of fermentation, the pulque is quickly shipped to market in barrels. The fermentation process is continuous, so the pulque must be consumed within a certain time before it spoils.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;

==Consumption==

Most pulque is consumed in bars called ''pulquerías''. At the beginning of the 20th century, more than 1,000 were located in Mexico City alone.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; By the early 20th century, ''pulquerías'' became socially accepted, and some were places of great elegance. But whether for rich or poor, two features stood out among these establishments: odd or catchy names, and murals decorating the walls. Names included (translated) "My Office", "Memories of the Future", "Drink and Go", "I'm Waiting for You Here at the Corner", and, across the street from the [[Chamber of Deputies (Mexico)|National Chamber of Deputies]], "The Recreation Center of Those Across the Street". [[Diego Rivera]] once said one of the most important manifestations of Mexican painting was the murals that decorated the facades and interiors of ''pulquerías''. One tradition maintained at all'' pulquerias ''at the beginning of the 20th century was to put sawdust on the floor. The tradition at that time was to begin a pulque-drinking session by spilling a little on the floor or ground as an offering to Mother Earth.&lt;ref name="barrios2223"&gt;{{cite book |last1=De Barrios |first1=Virginia B. |title=A Guide to Tequila, Mezcal and Pulque |year=2002 |publisher=Minutiae Mexicana S.A de C.V. |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-7074-46-9 |pages=22–23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Traditional ''pulquerías'' tend to be like clubs with closed membership, with casual visitors ignored or sometimes stared at. Frequent visits and large consumption of the drink tends to win acceptance.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; While some establishments may forbid women,&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; it is much more common for the establishment to provide a separate seating area for them. Intermingling of the sexes is not permitted.&lt;ref name="dioses"&gt;{{cite web |author=Jorge  |title= El Pulque "La Bebida de los Dioses"  |url=http://www.viajaydescubre.com/articulo/el-pulque-la-bebida-de-los-dioses/ |trans-title=Pulque, the Drink of the Gods |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 September 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090809151719/http://www.viajaydescubre.com/articulo/el-pulque-la-bebida-de-los-dioses/ |archivedate=2009-08-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="resusitan"&gt;{{cite web |first=Virginia |last=Avila  |title= Resusitan pulquerías del siglo XIX, aquí |url= http://www.e-consulta.com/oaxaca/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=4719 |trans-title=Resuscitating 19th century pulque bars here |date=2008-12-18 |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nuestro"&gt;{{cite web |title= Nuestro Pulque |url= http://pulquenuestro.blogspot.com/2009/06/10-de-algunas-cosas-que-hacen-una.html |trans-title=Our Pulque |language=Spanish |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the more rural areas of Hidalgo and Tlaxcala, where most pulque is made, the pulque is fresher and better. A vendor usually displays a white flag over the door when a fresh shipment has arrived.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;

Traditionally, pulque is served from large barrels on ice.&lt;ref name="dioses"/&gt; and served into glasses, using a ''jicara'', which is a half of a calabash tree gourd. The bartender is called a ''jicarero''. In a ''pulquería'', ''cruzado'', meaning something like "bottoms up", is a frequent salute.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;
[[File:PulqueGlasswareMAPDF.JPG|thumb|Traditional glassware for pulque ''circa'' 1950 on display at the Museo de Artes Populares, Mexico City]]
Drinking glasses have colorful names and can reflect a customer's ability to drink pulque. Large two-liter glasses are called ''macetas'' (flower pots), one-liter glasses are called ''cañones'' (cannons), half–liters are called  ''chivitos'' (little goats), quarter-liter glasses are ''catrinas'' (dandies), and eighth-liter glasses are ''tornillos'' (screws). Traditionally, these glasses are made from a greenish, hand blown glass.&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt; Pulque can be drunk straight from the barrel or can have a number of additives, such as fruit or nuts, added. Pulque prepared this way is called ''curado'' or cured.&lt;ref name="dioses"/&gt;

One of the limitations to pulque's popularity has been the inability to store it for long periods or ship it far. Recently, pulque makers have found a way to preserve the beverage in cans. However, they admit this does change the flavor. The hope is that with this innovation, pulque can regain its lost market in Mexico and even achieve success as an export item, like tequila.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt; It is already being offered in the United States by Boulder Imports, selling the brand "Nectar del Razo". The original market was Mexican-American men, but the company reports the product is having success as a health food, sought out by athletes and body builders.&lt;ref name="razo"&gt;{{cite web |title= Nectar del Razo|url= http://www.pocotequila.com/mextour/mex_agave/m3pulque.html  |accessdate=11 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a saying that pulque "sólo le falta un grado para ser carne" – "it is only a bit shy of being meat",  referring to the nutritional value of the drink.&lt;ref name="resusitan"/&gt; This was recognized by the Mesoamericans, who allowed pregnant women and the elderly to imbibe what was normally reserved only for priests and nobility. Modern analysis of the liquid has found that it contains carbohydrates, [[vitamin C]], B-complex, D, E, [[amino acid]]s and minerals such as [[iron]] and [[phosphorus]].&lt;ref name="madness"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt;

==Pulque tourism==
From the glory days of pulque, the state of Hidalgo has about 250 pulque haciendas, many of which have been abandoned or converted to other uses, such as ranching. Their ''tinacals'' have either disappeared or been converted into storage or party rooms. A few remaining ones continue to make pulque, but use more modern and sanitary facilities.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt; In Tlaxcala, the federal [[Secretary of Tourism (Mexico)|Secretariat of Tourism]] and the state government have organized a tour called the "Pulque Route", which includes the main haciendas that still make the beverage in this state. It is a two-day route which begins at the Church of La Barca de la Fe in [[Calpulalpan]] to the San Bartolo Hacienda, which is the principal exporter of canned pulque. This hacienda was the property of Ignacio Torres Adalid, who was called the "king of pulque". Today, it belongs to Ricardo del Razo. The tour also covers maguey fields like those around a town called Guillermo Ramirez.&lt;ref name="Tlaxcala"/&gt;
[[Image:Agave Pulque.JPG|thumb|A six pack of pulque]]

These old haciendas varied widely. Some were ostentatious with great architectural harmony such as the Montecillos Hacienda, of Spanish colonial style and originally built in the 17th century by the Jesuits or San Antonio Ometusco Hacienda built by architect Antonio Rivas Mercado. However, most haciendas were the result of a constructive process that started in the 16th century, with mixed architectural styles and methods of both Mexico and Europe. One characteristic feature is [[Neo-Gothic]] towers. The Santiago Tetlapayac Hacienda has murals related to [[charreada]] and attributed to the painter Icaza.  The Zotoluca Hacienda has an octangonal floorplan in [[Neo-Moorish]] style and was restored in the 1950s. But the center of each of these pulque haciendas is the tinacal. They were planned and decorated befitting their importance. Almost all have interesting architectural details, such as a specially decorated main doorway, murals or sculpted windows. Some are considered works of art, such as the tinacal at the Montecillos Hacienda or the one at the San Antonio Ometusco Hacienda, which also has an elegant canopy covering the shipping dock with moulded iron columns and walls decorated with murals relating to the history of pulque.&lt;ref name="lugares"/&gt;

[[Haiti]], for much of its history and including present-day has been prevailingly a [[Christianity|Christian]] country, primarily [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]], although in some instances it is profoundly modified and influenced through [[syncretism]]. A common syncretic religion is [[Haitian Vodou|Vodou]], which combined the [[West Africa]]n religions of the [[Slavery in Haiti|African slaves]] with Catholicism and some Native American strands; it shows similarities to [[Cuba]]n [[Santería]].

The largest [[Christian denomination]] in the country is [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholicism]], which is estimated to be about 55 percent of the population according to the 2018 CIA World Factbook&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html&lt;/ref&gt;, and 57 percent according to the Pew Research Center. The historical background is very much due to the [[French colonial empire|French influence]] brought about through the newly conquered territories.

[[Protestantism in Haiti|Protestantism]] has grown in recent years and Protestants are currently estimated by the CIA World Factbook to form 28.5% of the population, while the Pew Research Center estimates their share to be nearly 30 percent. 

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===
{{Main|Roman Catholicism in Haiti|Christianity in Haiti}}
[[File:Cathedral of Cap-Haitien.jpg|thumb|right|Cathedral of Our Lady of the Assumption in [[Cap-Haïtien]]]]
The predominant [[Christian denomination|denomination]] is [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="Haiti"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2007/90257.htm |title=Haiti |publisher=State.gov |date=2007-09-14 |accessdate=2014-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the rest of [[Latin America]], Saint-Domingue was built up by Roman Catholic European powers such as the [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] and the French. Following in this legacy, Catholicism was in the Haitian constitution as its official state religion until 1987.&lt;ref name="Haiti"/&gt; According to recent estimates by the CIA World Factbook and Pew Research Center, between 55 and 60% of Haitians are Catholics. [[Pope John Paul II]] visited Haiti in 1983. In a speech in the capital of [[Port-au-Prince]], he criticized the government of [[Jean-Claude Duvalier]]. It is believed that the impact of this speech on the Catholic bureaucracy in Haiti contributed to his removal in 1986.

According to the Catholic Church in Haiti, the 10 dioceses of the two ecclesiastical provinces of Haiti include 251 parishes and about 1,500 Christian rural communities. The local clergy has 400 diocesan priests and 300 seminarians. There are also 1,300 religious missionary priests belonging to more than 70 religious order and fraternities. Vocations to the priesthood are plentiful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecdha.org/content/view/17/30/ Site Web Officiel de l'Eglise de Haïti - L'épiscopat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108092709/http://ecdha.org/content/view/17/30/ |date=2009-01-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protestantism===
{{Main|Protestantism in Haiti}}

The CIA Factbook reports that around 28.5% of the population is Protestant (Baptist 15.4%, Pentecostal 7.9%, Adventist 3%, Methodist 1.5% other 0.7%)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html&lt;/ref&gt;. Other sources put the Protestant population higher than this, suggesting that it may form one-third of the population today, as Protestant churches have experienced significant growth in recent decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=40SIdXeUEhUC|title = Crossing the Water and Keeping the Faith: Haitian Religion in Miami|last = Rey|first = Terry|last2 = Stepick|first2 = Alex|date = 2013-08-19|publisher = NYU Press|isbn = 9781479820771|language = en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources put the Protestant population higher than this, suggesting that it might have formed form one-third of the population in 2001.&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Stepick"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=40SIdXeUEhUC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=Crossing the Water and Keeping the Faith: Haitian Religion in Miami |editor1=Rey, Terry |editor2=Stepick, Alex |page=5 |year=2013 |isbn=9780814777084 |accessdate=2 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Episcopal Diocese of Haiti]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egliseepiscopaledhaiti.org/ Eglise Episcopale D'Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt; is the Anglican Communion diocese consisting of the entire territory of Haiti. It is part of [[Province 2 of the Episcopal Church in the United States of America|Province 2]] of the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]]. Its cathedral, Holy Trinity (French: Cathédrale Sainte Trinité) located in the corner of Avenue Mgr. Guilloux and Rue Pavée in downtown Port-au-Prince, has been destroyed six times, including in the [[2010 Haiti earthquake]]. It is the largest diocese in the [[Episcopal Church (United States)]], with 83,698 members reported in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.episcopalchurch.org/documents/Statistical_Totals_for_the_Episcopal_Church_by_Province_and_Diocese_2007-2008.pdf The Episcopal Church, Baptized Members by Province &amp; Diocese: 1998-2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===
 
Missionary work in Haiti by [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] began in May 1980&lt;ref name="LDS Newsroom"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mormonnewsroom.org/facts-and-statistics/country/haiti | title=Haiti | publisher=LDS Newsroom | accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the land was dedicated for the preaching of the gospel by [[Thomas S. Monson]], then a member of the church's [[Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (LDS Church)|Quorum of the Twelve Apostles]], on 17 April 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mission.net/haiti/port-au-prince/page.php?pg_id=5263 | title=Prière de Dédicace | accessdate=2015-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2018, the church reported having 46 congregations and more than 23,000 members in Haiti.&lt;ref name="LDS Newsroom"/&gt; In September 2012, the third and fourth Haitian [[Stake (Latter Day Saints)|stakes]] were created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mission.net/haiti/port-au-prince/news.php?nID=5924 | title=Fourth Haitian Stake Organized | accessdate=2013-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;  All four stakes are based in the [[Port-au-Prince|capital]] region; [[District (LDS Church)|districts]] are based in [[Les Cayes]], [[Saint-Marc]], [[Gonaïves]], and [[Cap-Haïtien]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mission.net/haiti/port-au-prince/page.php?pg_id=2854 | title=Wards &amp; Branches | accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
At the church's April 2009 [[General Conference (LDS Church)|General Conference]], Fouchard Pierre-Nau, a native of [[Jérémie]], was called as an [[area seventy]] in the church's [[Fourth Quorum of the Seventy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2010/04/the-sustaining-of-church-officers?lang=eng | title=Sustaining of Church Officers | publisher=April 2009 General Conference Report | accessdate=2014-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the most prominent church position ever held by a Haitian.  In April 2016, Pierre-Nau was released and Hubermann Bien-Aimé, a native of Gonaïves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mission.net/haiti/port-au-prince/presidents.php?prID=8607 | title=President Hubermann Bien-Aimé | accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was called to that same quorum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/church/news/members-sustain-11-new-general-authorities | title=Members Sustain 11 New General Authorities | publisher=Church News | accessdate=2016-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the April 2015 General Conference, Monson—now serving as the church's [[President of the Church (LDS Church)|president]]—announced the church's intention to build a [[Port-au-Prince Haiti Temple|temple]] in Port-au-Prince.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sltrib.com/lifestyle/faith/2367124-155/monson-announces-3-new-mormon-temples | title=Monson announces 3 new Mormon temples | accessdate=2015-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Groundbreaking took place 28 October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sltrib.com/religion/2017/10/29/mormon-church-breaks-ground-on-long-awaited-haiti-temple | title=Groundbreaking Held for Port-au-Prince Haiti Temple | publisher=Salt Lake Tribune | accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In anticipation of the temple's completion, Fritzner and Gina Joseph were called in August 2018 as the first president and matron of the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lds.org/church/news/new-temple-president-called-to-serve-in-haiti | title=New Temple President Called to Serve in Haiti | publisher=Church News | accessdate=2018-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vodou==
{{Main|Haitian Vodou}}
The New World Afro-[[diasporic]] religion of Vodou is also practised. Vodou encompasses several different traditions, and consists of a mix encompassing African, European and indigenous ''[[Taíno people|Taíno]]'' religious elements. In this way, it is very similar to other Latin American [[syncretist]] movements, such as the [[Cuba]]n [[Santería]]. It is more widespread in rural parts of the country, partly due to negative [[Social stigma|stigma]]s attached to its practice. During the season of [[Lent]], Vodou societies create parading musical bands for a festival called [[Rara]], and fulfill religious obligations in local spaces such as streams, rivers, trees.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Rara! Vodou, Power, and Performance in Haiti and its Diaspora|last = McAlister|first = Elizabeth|publisher = University of California Press|year = 2002|isbn = |location = Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The CIA World Factbook reports that 2.1% of the population identifies its religion as Vodou, but adds that "many Haitians practice elements of Vodou in addition to another religion, most often Roman Catholicism." &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/ha.html The World Factbook]&lt;/ref&gt; The proportion of Haitians that practice Vodou is disputed, due to the often [[syncretic]] manner in which it is practiced alongside Catholicism. Haitian Protestants are less likely to practice Vodou, as their churches strongly denounce it as diabolical.&lt;ref name="Rey &amp; Stepick"/&gt;

==Islam==
{{Main|Islam in Haiti}}
There is a small [[Islam|Muslim]] community in Haiti, mainly residing in Port-au-Prince, Cap-Haïtien and its surrounding suburbs. The history of Islam on the island of [[Hispaniola]] (which Haiti shares with the [[Dominican Republic]]) begins with slavery in Haiti. Many Muslims were imported as slaves to Haiti{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}.

In 2000, [[Nawoon Marcellus]], a member of [[Fanmi Lavalas]] from [[Saint-Raphaël, Haiti|Saint-Raphaël]], became the first Muslim elected to the [[Chamber of Deputies (Haiti)|Chamber of Deputies of Haiti]].

==Bahá'í Faith==
{{Main|Bahá'í Faith in Haiti}}
The [[Bahá'í Faith]] in Haiti begins with a mention by [[`Abdu'l-Bahá]], then head of the religion, in 1916 as one of the island countries of the Caribbean being among the places Bahá'ís should take the religion to.&lt;ref name="sohrab"&gt;{{cite book | last = Abbas | first = `Abdu'l-Bahá |author2=Mirza Ahmad Sohrab |author3=trans. and comments  | title = Tablets, Instructions and Words of Explanation |date=April 1919 | url =http://bahai-library.com/abdulbaha_tablets_instructions_explanation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Bahá'í to visit Haiti was [[Leonora Armstrong]] in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/720-748.html |title=In Memoriam |authors=Universal House of Justice |journal=The Bahá'í World |volume= XVIII |publisher= Bahá'í World Centre |pages= 733–738 |year= 1986 |isbn= 0-85398-234-1 |accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that others visited until [[Louis George Gregory]] visited in January 1937 and he mentions a small community of Bahá'ís operating in Haiti.&lt;ref name="BN109"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Annual Report Inter-America Committee |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1937 | number = 109 |pages=3–5 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first long term [[Pioneering (Bahá'í)|pioneers]], Ruth and Ellsworth Blackwell, arrived in 1940.&lt;ref name="BN139"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = InterAmerica Teaching|magazine= Bahá'í News |date=October 1940 | number = 139 | page =4 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following their arrival the first Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]] of [[Haiti]] was formed in 1942 in [[Port-au-Prince]].&lt;ref name="BN154"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Supplement to Annual Report of the National Spiritual Assembly 1941-42 |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=July 1942 | number = 154 |pages=11–12 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1951 the Haitian Bahá'ís participated in regional organizations of the religion&lt;ref name="BN247"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Central America, Mexico and the Antilles |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=September 1951 | number = 247 |pages=9–10 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; until 1961 when Haitian Bahá'ís elected their own [[National Spiritual Assembly]]&lt;ref name="notes"&gt;{{Citation  | title = National Spiritual Assemblies Statistics | url = http://bahai-library.com/hassall_nsas_years_formation | accessdate = 2008-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and soon took on goals reaching out into neighboring islands.&lt;ref name="BN411"&gt;{{cite magazine | title = Teaching Conference Held in Honduras |magazine= Bahá'í News |date=June 1965 | number = 411 | page =1 | url =http://www.teachingandprojects.com/meansandmaterials.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Association of Religion Data Archives]] (relying mostly on the [[World Christian Encyclopedia]]) estimated some 21,000 Bahá'ís in Haiti in 2005.&lt;ref name="WCE-05"&gt;{{cite web| title = Most Baha'i Nations (2005) | work = QuickLists &gt; Compare Nations &gt; Religions &gt; | publisher = The Association of Religion Data Archives | year = 2005| url =http://www.thearda.com/QuickLists/QuickList_40c.asp | doi = | accessdate = 2010-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judaism==
{{Main|History of the Jews in Haiti}}

Sephardic Jews arrived in [[Saint-Domingue]] during the first days of the colonial period, despite that they were banned in the official Catholic edicts. They became merchants and integrated themselves into the French Catholic society. Waves of Jews continued to immigrate to the Haiti, including a group of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] escaping Hitler's Germany in the 1940s; Haiti was one of the few countries to welcome them openly. Haitian Catholics had idiosyncratic ideas about Jews, stemming from Catholic anti-Judaism, although many Vodou practitioners imagined themselves to be the descendants of Jews and to hold esoteric Judaic knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Jew in the Haitian Imagination|last = McAlister|first = Elizabeth|publisher = Oxford University Press|year = 2004|isbn = 0195149181|location = New York|pages = 61–84|work = Race, Nation, and Religion in the Americas|editor-last = Goldschmidt|editor-first = Henry|editor-last2 = McAlister|editor-first2 = Elizabeth}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is a group of [[Jews|Judaism]] predominantly residing in Port-au-Prince, where the community today meets at the home of businessman billionaire [[Gilbert Bigio]], a Haitian of [[Syria]]n descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://warincontext.org/2010/01/25/does-gilbert-bigio-make-israel-look-good/ |title=Does Gilbert Bigio make Israel look good? |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bigio's father first settled in Haiti in 1925 and was active in the Jewish community. In November 1947, his father played a significant role in Haiti's support for the statehood of Israel in a vote to the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slowlygetrich.com/haiti-richest-man-billionaire-gilbert-bigio/ |title=Haiti richest Man, Billionaire Gilbert Bigio |accessdate=30 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Every [[Rosh Hashanah]] and [[Yom Kippur]], services are held at his residence. The last Jewish wedding to take place in Haiti occurred 10 years ago; Bigio’s daughter, while the last [[bris]] was done for his son, more than 30 years ago. Bigio owns the only [[Torah]] in all of the country, which he provides to the community for services.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/haiti.html The Virtual Jewish World: Haiti]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Statistics ==
{{See also|Demographic history of Kosovo}}
According to the [[U.S. Department of State]]'s 2007 [[International Religious Freedom Report]], 'the last credible [[census]] was taken in the 1980s', and the religious demographics had to be estimated.&lt;ref name="IRFR2007"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2007/90198.htm#kosovo |title=Serbia (includes Kosovo) |work=International Religious Freedom Report 2017 |publisher=U.S. Department of State |date=2007 |accessdate=18 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Report found that [[Islam]] was the predominant faith in Kosovo, 'professed by most of the majority [[Kosovo Albanians|ethnic Albanian population]], the [[Bosniaks in Kosovo|Bosniak]], [[Gorani people|Gorani]], and [[Turks in Kosovo|Turkish]] communities, and some of the [[Romani people in Kosovo|Roma]]/[[Ashkali and Balkan Egyptians|Ashkali/Egyptian]] community'. About 100,000–120,000 people were [[Kosovo Serbs|Serbs]], and these were largely [[Serbian Orthodox Church|Serbian Orthodox]]. Approximately 3.4% of ethnic Albanians were [[Roman Catholic Church|Catholics]], whereas [[Protestantism|Protestants]] comprised a minority of less than 1%, there were only two known families of [[Jews|Jewish]] origin and no reliable data for [[atheism|atheists]].&lt;ref name="IRFR2007"/&gt; It is also likely that there are some Orthodox Albanians in Kosovo. However, with current tension between Kosovars and Serbs, they may feel as if they do not want to identify as Orthodox, as they may be thought of as ‘Serbs’ because of their Orthodox status. Therefore, they are not represented in the census. Furthermore, the Report claimed that religion was 'not a significant factor in public life. Religious rhetoric was largely absent from public discourse in Muslim communities, mosque attendance was low, and public displays of conservative Islamic dress and culture were minimal.'&lt;ref name="IRFR2007"/&gt;

According to [[Pew Research Center]]'s 2015 study, in 2010 Kosovo had 93.8% Muslims and 6.1% [[Christianity|Christians]]; all other religious groups and the [[irreligion|unaffiliated]] each had less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.globalreligiousfutures.org/countries/kosovo/religious_demography#/?affiliations_religion_id=0&amp;affiliations_year=2010 |title=Religions in Kosovo |work=Global Religious Futures Project |publisher=Pew-Templeton |date=2 April 2015 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2011 Kosovo population census was largely boycotted by the [[Kosovo Serbs]] (who predominantly identify as [[Serbian Orthodox]] Christians), especially in [[North Kosovo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-census-starts-without-northern-kosovo |title=Kosovo Census to Start Without the North |author=Petrit Collaku |work=[[Balkan Insight]] |date=29 March 2011 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; leaving the Serb population underrepresented.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.balkaninsight.com/en/article/kosovo-police-stop-illegal-serb-census-attempts-09-14-2017 |title=Kosovo Police Stop ‘Illegal’ Serb Census Attempts |author=Perparim Isufi |work=Balkan Insight |date=14 September 2017 |accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results of the 2011 census gave the following religious affiliations for the population included in the census:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://unstats.un.org/unsd/censuskb20/KnowledgebaseArticle10700.aspx|title=Kosovo Population and Housing Census 2011 - Final Results: Quality Report|date=2011|website=unstats.un.org|publisher=[[United Nations Statistics Division]]|accessdate=17 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These figures do not represent individual sects operating in Kosovo such as [[Sufism]] or [[Bektashism]] which are sometimes classified generally under the category of "Islam."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://euobserver.com/news/31390|title=The influence of Sufi Islam in the Balkans|website=Euobserver.com|accessdate=2017-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Serb population is largely [[Serbian Orthodox]], and primarily concentrated in [[North Kosovo]], though a few enclaves exist elsewhere. The [[Roman Catholicism in Kosovo|Catholic]] Albanian communities are mostly concentrated in [[Gjakova]], [[Prizren]], [[Klina]] and a few villages near [[Peć]] and [[Vitina (town)|Vitina]] (see [[laramans]]). Slavic-speaking Catholics usually call themselves [[Janjevci]] or Kosovan Croats. Slavic-speaking Muslims in the south of Kosovo are known as the [[Gorani people]].

=== Christianity ===
{{Main|Christianity in Kosovo}}
[[File:Patrikana e Pejës.jpg|thumb|right|[[Patriarchate of Peć (monastery)|Peć]] was made the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]'s See in 1252.]]
Christianity probably reached Kosovo in the 5th century as the [[Roman Empire]] gradually split into a [[Greek East and Latin West]]. Kosovo became part the former, known as the [[Byzantine Empire]], and thus fell into the sphere of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Church]] based in [[Constantinople]].&lt;ref name="Elsie61"&gt;Elsie (2015), p. 60–61.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[High Middle Ages]], as Byzantine rule in Kosovo gave way to the [[Serbian Empire]] in the early 13th century, there was a Serb-speaking Orthodox Christian majority, but also a Roman Catholic minority consisting of the [[Italo-Dalmatian languages|Italo-Dalmatian]] merchant class from [[Republic of Ragusa|Ragusa]], [[Germans|German]] immigrants from [[Hungary]] and [[Transylvania]], and probably all of the native [[Albanians|Albanian population]].&lt;ref name="Elsie61"/&gt;

==== Serbian Orthodoxy ====
{{Main|Serbian Orthodox Church in Kosovo}}
The presence of Serbian Orthodox bishops in [[Lipljan]] and [[Prizren]] was first recorded in the 10th century.&lt;ref name="Elsie207"&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Elsie|title=Historical Dictionary of Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Pg-aeA-nUeAC&amp;pg=207 |date=15 November 2015|publisher=Scarecrow Press|page=207|isbn=9780810874831}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1219, the Serbian Orthodox Church split from the Greek Orthodox Church, and Greek bishops were expelled from Kosovo.&lt;ref name="Elsie207"/&gt; The See of the Serbian Orthodox Church was moved from [[Žiča]] in present-day [[Serbia]] to [[Peć|Peć/Peja]] in present-day Kosovo in 1252, thus making it the religious and cultural centre of Serbian Orthodoxy. In 1346, the [[Serbian Patriarchate of Peć|archbishop of Peć]] assumed the title of [[patriarch]].&lt;ref name="Elsie207"/&gt;

==== Catholicism and crypto-Catholics ====
{{Main|Catholic Church in Kosovo}}
[[File:34 Prishtënë - Katedralja.jpg||thumb|right|[[Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa, Pristina|Cathedral of Saint Mother Teresa]], Kosovo's main Roman Catholic church, 2013]]
[[Kosovo]] was conquered by the [[Ottoman Empire]] along with the other [[Fall of the Serbian Empire|remnants of the Serbian Empire]] in the period following the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389). Although the Ottomans did not force the Roman Catholic and Orthodox Christian population to convert to Islam, there was strong social pressure (such as not having to pay the [[jizya]]) as well as political expediency to do so, which ethnic Albanians did in far greater numbers (including the entire nobility) than Serbs, Greeks and others in the region.&lt;ref&gt;Encarta-encyclopedie Winkler Prins (1993–2002) s.v. "Albanië. §6. Geschiedenis". Microsoft Corporation/Het Spectrum.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Albanian Catholics converted to Islam in the 17th and 18th centuries, despite attempts by Roman Catholic clergy to stop them. During the ''Concilium Albanicum'', a meeting of Albanian bishops in 1703, a strict condemnation of conversion – especially for opportunistic reasons such as jizya evasion – was promulgated. Whilst many of these converts stayed crypto-Catholics to a certain extent, often helped by pragmatic lower clerics, the higher Roman Catholic clergy ordered them to be denied [[Sacraments of the Catholic Church|the sacraments]] for their heresy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Duijzings|first=Ger |title=Religion and the Politics of Identity in Kosovo|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJRYkzl5YC4C|year=2000|publisher=C. Hurst &amp; Co. Publishers|isbn=978-1-85065-431-5|pages=86–99|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to convert the [[Laramans|Laraman community]] of [[Vitina|Letnica]] back to Roman Catholicism began in 1837, but the effort was violently suppressed – the local Ottoman governor put laramans in jail.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=92}} After the Ottoman Empire abolished the death penalty for apostasy from Islam by the [[Edict of Toleration 1844]], several groups of crypto-Catholics in [[Prizren]], [[Peć|Peja]] and [[Gjakova]] were recognised as Catholics by the Ottoman Grand Vizier in 1845. When the Laramans of Letnica asked the district governor and judge in [[Gjilan]] to recognise them as Catholics, they were refused however, and subsequently imprisoned, and then deported to [[Anatolia]],{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=93}} from where they returned in November 1848 following diplomatic intervention.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=94}} In 1856, a further [[Tanzimat]] [[Ottoman Reform Edict of 1856|reform]] improved the situation, and no further serious abuse was reported.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=96}} The greater part of converts of Laramans, almost exclusively new-borns, took place between 1872 and 1924.{{sfn|Duijzings|2000|p=99}}

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Islam in Kosovo}}
[[File:Prizren kossovo.jpg|thumb|The [[Sinan Pasha Mosque (Prizren)|Sinan Pasha Mosque]] in [[Prizren]] was completed in 1615.]]
After victory at the [[Battle of Kosovo]] (1389), the [[Ottoman Empire]] imposed Islamic rule on the region. Conversion was not obligatory, but had several financial, social and political benefits. Until the sixteenth century the degree of Islamisation in Kosovo was minimal, and largely confined to urban centres. The pace of conversions to Islam only increased significantly in the second half of the sixteenth century, possibly because converts thus became exempt from the ''[[jizya|cizje]]'', a tax levied only on non-Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, Noel, ''Kosovo: A Short History'', pp. 105-108&lt;/ref&gt; By 1634, the majority of [[Kosovo Albanians]] had converted to Islam, although a minority remained Roman Catholic.&lt;ref name="Elsie130"&gt;Elsie (2015), p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; Besides the ethnic Albanians, and the ruling Turks who settled in Kosovo, the [[Romani people|Roma]] and some part of the Slavic-speaking population (later called the [[Bosniaks]] and/or [[Gorani people|Gorani]], to distinguish them from the Orthodox Serbs) also became Muslims, by far most of them [[Sunni]], although small a minority of [[Shia Muslims]] formed in the countryside. By the end of the 17th century, the Islamic population started to outnumber the Christians.&lt;ref name="Elsie130"/&gt;

The '''Shaolin Monastery''' ({{zh|c=少林寺|p=Shàolín sì}}), also known as the '''Shaolin Temple''', is a [[Chan Buddhism|Chan ("Zen") Buddhist]] temple in [[Dengfeng|Dengfeng County]], [[Henan Province]], [[China]].  Believed to have been founded in the 5th century [[Common Era|CE]], the Shaolin Temple is the main temple of the Shaolin school of Buddhism to this day. 

Shaolin Monastery and its [[Pagoda Forest at Shaolin Temple|Pagoda Forest]] were inscribed as a [[World Heritage Site|UNESCO World Heritage Site]] in 2010 as part of the "[[Dengfeng|Historic Monuments of Dengfeng]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://malaysia.news.yahoo.com/bnm/20100802/tts-china-heritage-993ba14.html China's Shaolin Temple, Danxia Landform Added To World Heritage Sites]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{see also|Shaolin Kung Fu}}

===Establishment===
The name refers to the forests  of Shaoshi ({{zh|c=少室|p=Shǎo Shì| labels=no}}) mountain, one of the seven peaks of the [[Mount Song|Song mountains]]. The first Shaolin Monastery abbot was [[Batuo]] (also called ''Fotuo'' or ''Buddhabhadra''), a [[Dhyāna in Buddhism|dhyāna]] master who came to [[ancient China]] from [[ancient India]]&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, Meir. ''The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2008 ({{ISBN|0824831101}}), p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; or from Central Asia&lt;ref&gt;Broughton, Jeffrey L. (1999), The Bodhidharma Anthology: The Earliest Records of Zen, Berkeley: University of California Press, {{ISBN|0-520-21972-4}}. pp. 54-55.&lt;/ref&gt; in 464 AD to spread Buddhist teachings.

According to the ''Continued Biographies of Eminent Monks'' (645 AD) by [[Daoxuan]], Shaolin Monastery was built on the north side of Shaoshi, the central peak of [[Mount Song]], one of the [[Sacred Mountains of China]], by [[Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei China|Emperor Xiaowen]] of the [[Northern Wei|Northern Wei dynasty]] in 477 AD, to accommodate the [[India|Indian]] master beside the capital [[Luoyang]] city. [[Yang Xuanzhi]], in the ''Record of the Buddhist Monasteries of [[Luoyang]]'' (547 AD), and Li Xian, in the ''Ming Yitongzhi'' (1461), concur with Daoxuan's location and attribution. The ''Jiaqing Chongxiu Yitongzhi'' (1843) specifies that this monastery, located in the province of Henan, was built in the 20th year of the ''Taihe'' era of the [[Northern Wei|Northern Wei dynasty]], that is, the monastery was built in 495 AD.

As the center of [[Chan Buddhism]], the Shaolin Temple attracted many emperors’ attention in China’s history. During the [[Tang dynasty]] 618-907 AD [[Empress Wu Zetian]] (AD 625-705) paid several visits to the Shaolin Temple discussing Chan philosophy with high monk Tan Zong. According to legend, [[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]] granted the Shaolin Temple extra land and a special "imperial dispensation" to consume meat and alcohol during the [[Tang dynasty]]. If true, this would have made Shaolin the only temple in China that did not prohibit alcohol. Regardless of historical veracity, these rituals are not practiced today.&lt;ref&gt;Polly, Matthew. [https://books.google.com/books?id=-prqcK9zLSIC&amp;pg=PA37&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=li+shimin+alcohol+meat&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=PlEXO75uim&amp;sig=O1qGw2i8E3UVUby_Ro7yS7HP9W8&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=9RvUTL-GMoT78AainczsBg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CCMQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=li%20shimin%20alcohol%20meat&amp;f=false ''American Shaolin: Flying Kicks, Buddhist Monks, and the Legend of Iron Crotch: An Odyssey in the New China''] Gotham Books, 2007, Page 37; [[Google Books]], Accessed November 7, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This legend is not corroborated in any period documents, such as the Shaolin Stele erected in 728. The stele does not list any such imperial dispensation as reward for the monks' assistance during the campaign against [[Wang Shichong]], only land and a water mill are granted.&lt;ref&gt;Tonami, Mamoru. 1990. "The Shaolin Monastery Stele on Mount Song (tr. by P.A. Herbert)". Kyoto: Istituto Italiano di Cultura / Scuola di Studi sull' Asia Orientale p.17-18, 35&lt;/ref&gt; The founder of the [[Yuan dynasty]], [[Kublai Khan]] (AD 1215-1294) ordered all Buddhist temples in China to be led by the Shaolin Temple; there were eight Princes during the [[Ming dynasty]] turned themselves into Shaolin monks.


[[File:Himeji-jo-112113.jpg|thumb|left|Picture of Bodhidharma at [[Himeji Castle]].]]
Traditionally [[Bodhidharma]] is credited as founder of the martial arts at the Shaolin Temple. However, martial arts historians have shown this legend stems from a 17th-century [[qigong]] manual known as the ''[[Yijin Jing]]''.{{sfn|Shahar |2008|pp=165–173}}

The authenticity of the ''Yi Jin Jing'' has been discredited by some historians including [[Tang Hao]], Xu Zhen and [[Ryuchi Matsuda]]. This argument is summarized by modern historian Lin Boyuan in his ''Zhongguo wushu shi'':     
{{quote|As for the "Yi Jin Jing" (Muscle Change Classic), a spurious text attributed to Bodhidharma and included in the legend of his transmitting martial arts at the temple, it was written in the Ming dynasty, in 1624, by the Daoist priest Zining of Mt. Tiantai, and falsely attributed to Bodhidharma. Forged prefaces, attributed to the Tang general Li Jing and the Southern Song general Niu Gao were written. They say that, after Bodhidharma faced the wall for nine years at Shaolin temple, he left behind an iron chest; when the monks opened this chest they found the two books "Xi Sui Jing" (Marrow Washing Classic) and "Yi Jin Jing" within. The first book was taken by his disciple Huike, and disappeared; as for the second, "the monks selfishly coveted it, practicing the skills therein, falling into heterodox ways, and losing the correct purpose of cultivating the Real. The Shaolin monks have made some fame for themselves through their fighting skill; this is all due to having obtained this manuscript". Based on this, Bodhidharma was claimed to be the ancestor of Shaolin martial arts. This manuscript is full of errors, absurdities and fantastic claims; it cannot be taken as a legitimate source.{{sfn|Lin|1996|p=183}}}} 
    
The oldest available copy was published in 1827.{{sfn|Ryuchi|1986}} The composition of the text itself has been dated to 1624.{{sfn|Lin|1996|p=183}} Even then, the association of Bodhidharma with martial arts only became widespread as a result of the 1904–1907 serialization of the novel ''The Travels of Lao Ts'an'' in ''Illustrated Fiction Magazine'':{{sfn|Henning|1994}}
{{quote|One of the most recently invented and familiar of the Shaolin historical narratives is a story that claims that the Indian monk Bodhidharma, the supposed founder of Chinese Chan (Zen) Buddhism, introduced boxing into the monastery as a form of exercise around a.d. 525. This story first appeared in a popular novel, ''The Travels of Lao T’san'', published as a series in a literary magazine in 1907. This story was quickly picked up by others and spread rapidly through publication in a popular contemporary boxing manual, Secrets of Shaolin Boxing Methods, and the first Chinese physical culture history published in 1919. As a result, it has enjoyed vast oral circulation and is one of the most “sacred” of the narratives shared within Chinese and Chinese-derived martial arts. That this story is clearly a twentieth-century invention is confirmed by writings going back at least 250 years earlier, which mention both Bodhidharma and martial arts but make no connection between the two.{{sfn|Henning|2001|p=129}}}}

Other scholars see an earlier connection between Da Mo and the Shaolin Monastery. Scholars generally accept the historicity of Da Mo (Bodhidharma) who arrived in China from his country [[India]] around 480. Da Mo (Bodhidharma) and his disciples are said to have lived a spot about a mile from the Shaolin Temple that is now a small nunnery.&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Andy, Tracking Bodhidharma: A Journey to the Heart of Chinese Culture, pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt; 
In the 6th century, around 547, The Record of the Buddhist Monasteries says Da Mo visited the area near Mount Song.&lt;ref&gt;Louyang Quilan Ji&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Shahar, Meir pg 13"&gt;Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, pg 13&lt;/ref&gt; In 645 The Continuation of the Biographies of Eminent Monks describes him as being active in the Mount Song region.&lt;ref name="Shahar, Meir pg 13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xu Gaoseng Zhuan&lt;/ref&gt; Around 710 Da Mo is identified specifically with the Shaolin Temple (Precious Record of Dharma's Transmission or Chuanfa Baoji) &lt;ref name="Shahar, Meir pg 13"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Record of Dharma's Transmission of Chuanfa Baoji&lt;/ref&gt; and writes of his sitting facing a wall in meditation for many years. It also speaks of Huikes many trials in his efforts to receive instruction from Da Mo.  In the 11th century a (1004) work embellishes Da Mo legends with great detail. A stele inscription at the Shaolin Monastery dated 728 reveals Da Mo residing on Mount Song.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, pg 14&lt;/ref&gt; Another stele in 798 speaks of Huike seeking instruction from Da Mo. Another engraving dated 1209 depicts the barefoot saint holding a shoe according to the ancient legend of Da Mo.  A plethora of 13th- and 14th-century steles feature Da Mo in Various roles. One 13th-century image shows him riding a fragile stalk across the Yangtze River.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; In 1125 a special temple was constructed in his honor at the Shaolin Monastery.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, Meir, The Shaolin Monastery: History, Religion, and the Chinese Martial Arts, pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destructions and renovations ===

The monastery has been destroyed and rebuilt many times. During the [[Red Turban Rebellion]] in the 14th century, bandits ransacked the monastery for its real or supposed valuables, destroying much of the temple and driving the monks away. The monastery was likely abandoned from 1351 or 1356 (the most likely dates for the attack) to at least 1359, when government troops retook Henan. The events of this period would later figure heavily in 16th-century legends of the temple's patron saint [[Vajrapani]], with the story being changed to claim a victory for the monks, rather than a defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, ''The Shaolin Monastery'', pp. 83–85&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1641, rebel forces led by [[Li Zicheng]] sacked the monastery due to the monks' support of the [[Ming dynasty]] and the possible threat they posed to the rebels. This effectively destroyed the temple's fighting force.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, ''The Shaolin Monastery'', pp. 185–188&lt;/ref&gt; The temple fell into ruin and was home to only a few monks until the early 18th century, when the government of the [[Qing dynasty]] patronized and restored the temple.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, ''The Shaolin Monastery'', pp. 182–183, 190&lt;/ref&gt;

Perhaps the best-known story of the Temple's destruction is that it was destroyed by the Qing government for supposed anti-Qing activities. Variously said to have taken place in 1647 under the [[Shunzhi Emperor]], in 1674, 1677, or 1714 under the [[Kangxi Emperor]], or in 1728 or 1732 under the [[Yongzheng Emperor]], this destruction is also supposed to have helped spread Shaolin martial arts through China by means of the [[Five Elders|five fugitive monks]]. Some accounts claim that a supposed southern Shaolin Temple was destroyed instead of, or in addition to, the temple in Henan: Ju Ke, in the ''Qing bai lei chao'' (1917), locates this temple in [[Fujian]] province. These stories commonly appear in legendary or popular accounts of martial history, and in ''[[wuxia]]'' fiction.

While these latter accounts are popular among martial artists, and often serve as origin stories for various martial arts styles, they are viewed by scholars as fictional. The accounts are known through often inconsistent 19th-century secret society histories and popular literature, and also appear to draw on both Fujianese folklore and popular narratives such as the classical novel ''[[Water Margin]]''. Modern scholarly attention to the tales is mainly concerned with their role as folklore.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, ''The Shaolin Monastery'', pp. 183–185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, Brain and Elizabeth Guo, ''Chinese Martial Arts Training Manuals: A Historical Survey'', Berkeley: North Atlantic Books, 2005 ({{ISBN|1-55643-557-6}}), p. 70&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McKeown, Trevor W., "Shaolin Temple Legends, Chinese Secret Societies, and the Chinese Martial Arts", in ''Martial Arts of the World: An Encyclopedia of History and Innovation'', ed. Green and Svinth, pp, 112–113&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Murry, Dian and Qin Baoqi, ''The Origins of the Tiandihui: The Chinese Triads in Legend and History'', Stanford: Stanford University Press, 1995, ({{ISBN|978-0804723244}}), pp. 154-156&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent history ===
{{Chinese martial arts}}

There is evidence of Shaolin martial arts being exported to Japan since the 18th century. Martial arts such as [[Okinawa]]n [[Shōrin-ryū]] (小林流) style of [[Karate]], for example, has a name meaning "Shaolin School"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bishop|first=Mark|title=Okinawan Karate: Teachers, Styles and Secret Techniques|publisher=A&amp;C Black, London|year=1989|isbn=0-7136-5666-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Japan]]ese [[Shorinji Kempo]]   (少林寺拳法) is translated as "Shaolin Temple Fist Method". Other similarities can be seen in centuries-old Chinese and Japanese martial arts manuals.&lt;ref&gt;Leff, Norman. Martial Arts Legends (magazine). "Atemi Waza", CFW Enterprises, April 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1928, the warlord [[Shi Yousan]] set fire to the monastery, burning it for over 40 days, destroying a significant percent of the buildings, including many manuscripts of the temple library.&lt;ref name=ching&gt;Gene Ching. [http://ezine.kungfumagazine.com/ezine/article.php?article=157 Kungfumagazine.com], Bak Sil Lum vs. Shaolin Temple.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Cultural Revolution]] launched in 1966 targeted religious orders including the monastery. The five monks who were present at the monastery when the [[Red Guards (China)|Red Guards]] attacked were shackled and made to wear placards declaring the crimes charged against them.&lt;ref name=ching/&gt; The monks were jailed after publicly being flogged and paraded through the street as people threw rubbish at them.&lt;ref name=ching/&gt; The government purged Buddhist materials from within the monastery walls, leaving it barren for years.

Martial arts groups from all over the world have made donations for the upkeep of the temple and grounds, and are subsequently honored with carved stones near the entrance of the temple.

In the past, many have tried to capitalise on Shaolin Monastery fame by building their own schools on Mount Song. However, the Chinese government eventually outlawed this; the schools were moved to the nearby towns.
A [[dharma]] gathering was held from August 19 to August 20, 1999, in Shaolin Monastery for [[Shi Yongxin]]'s assumption of office as abbot. In March 2006, Russian President [[Vladimir Putin]] became the first foreign leader to visit the monastery. In 2007, the Chinese government partially lifted the 300-year ban of the Jieba, the ancient ceremony of the nine marks which are burned onto the head with sticks of incense. The ban was lifted only for those who were mentally and physically prepared to participate in the tradition.

Two modern bathrooms were recently added to the temple for use by monks and tourists. The new bathrooms reportedly cost three million [[Renminbi|yuan]] to build.&lt;ref&gt;Jiang Yuxia. [http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2008-04/08/content_7940163.htm Xinhuanet.com], Luxurious toilets debut in Shaolin Temple.

In 1994 the temple registered its name as a trademark. In the late 2000s, Shi Yongxin began authorizing Shaolin branches outside of mainland China in what has been called a franchise scheme. The branches are run by current and former monks and allow dispersion of Shaolin culture and study of Shaolin kung fu around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/china/3525878/Shaolin-Temple-franchises-out-kung-fu-monks.html Moore, Malcolm]&lt;/ref&gt; As of January, 2011, Yongxin and the temple operated over 40 companies in cities across the world, including London and Berlin, which have purchased land and property.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110118224204/http://www.asiaone.com/Business/News/Story/A1Story20110111-257593.html China's Shaolin Temple builds business empire - AsiaOne Business]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, for the first time in its 1500-year history, the Shaolin Monastery raised the [[Flag of China|national flag]] as a part of a "patriotism drive" under the new National Religious Affairs Administration, a part of the [[United Front Work Department]] which "oversees propaganda efforts as well as relations with the global Chinese diaspora".&lt;ref&gt;South China Morning Post, [https://www.scmp.com/news/china/society/article/2161688/red-flag-buddhists-shaolin-temple-takes-lead-chinese-patriotism Red flag for Buddhists?

==Southern and Northern Shaolin Monasteries==
A number of traditions make reference to a [[Southern Shaolin Monastery]] located in [[Fujian]] province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tech.sina.com.cn/d/2006-06-26/21491008675.shtml 南少林之谜：两百多年前为何突然消失无影踪(4)]&lt;/ref&gt; There has also been a Northern Shaolin monastery in northern China. Associated with stories of the supposed burning of Shaolin by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] government and with the tales of the [[Five Elders]], this temple, sometimes known by the name Changlin, is often claimed to have been either the target of Qing forces or a place of refuge for monks displaced by attacks on the Shaolin Monastery in Henan. Besides the debate over the historicity of the Qing-era destruction, it is currently unknown whether there was a true southern temple, with several locations in Fujian given as the location for the monastery. Fujian does have a historic monastery called Changlin, and a monastery referred to as a "Shaolin cloister" has existed in [[Fuqing]], [[Fujian]], since the [[Song dynasty]], but whether these have an actual connection to the Henan monastery or a martial tradition is still unknown.&lt;ref&gt;Shahar, ''The Shaolin Monastery, pp. 184, 234–235''&lt;/ref&gt; The Southern Temple has been a popular subject of ''[[wuxia]]'' fiction, first appearing in the 1893 novel ''Shengchao Ding Sheng Wannian Qing'', where it is attacked by the [[Qianlong Emperor]] with the help of the [[Bak Mei|White Eyebrow Taoist]].&lt;ref&gt;Hamm, John Christopher, ''Paper Swordsmen: JIn Yong and the Modern Chinese Martial Arts Novel''. Honolulu: University of Hawai'i Press, 2006 ({{ISBN|0-8248-2895-X}}) pp. 34–36&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Shheem''' ({{lang-ar| شحيم}}) alternatively written as '''Chhim''' is a [[town]] in [[Lebanon]] which is located 47 kilometres south-east of Beirut. Chhim is located on 4 mountains in the Chouf region in Lebanon. It is inhabited by [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunnite Muslims]]. Chimm has a population of about 49,000. It is considered a city by some people. The most known families in Chhim are El Khatib , Daher, El Hajjar, Moallem, Chaaban, Fawaz, Abdallah, Hajj-Chehade, Younis, Mrad, Saab and Oueidat.

There is no confirmation about exact date of founding. However it is suggested that Chhim has been standing since the 18th century. It was definitely in place during the 19th century, although it was not necessarily as developed and huge as it is today.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Chhim is the largest Sunnite town in the Chouf region. The community lives in harmony and there have never been any issues in Chhim,{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}} despite the sectarian violence that Lebanon has suffered from the past 40 years or so. It has been in a battleground long ago when the French and British forces fought here around a century ago. Chhim has suffered from excessive building which has been ruining its nature. Chhim was built on a huge forest where wolves and hyenas lived in. However, forests still can be found in and around Chhim. The town is rich in olive trees.

Chhim is often confused within size due to many parts of it having different names; some more familiar parts of Chhim include Marj-Ali, Sahle, Jabal swed, and Jirid. These and many others are part of Chhim but have different names.

Chhim contains 11 schools, 8 of which are public. It also contains two hospitals, one of them is public, and the other is private.

==Features==
Chhim contains many mosques and is mostly inhabited by [[Sunni Islam in Lebanon|Sunni Muslims]].

It is the site of one of many [[Temples of the Beqaa Valley]].&lt;ref name="Berbary1960"&gt;{{cite book|author=Shehadi M.

==Roman Temple==
The temple at Chhim faces east and has a small [[porch]]. There is a carving of the [[sun god]] [[Helios]] on one of the doorframes. Another carving portrays the image of a [[priest]] with outstretched arms.&lt;ref name="Taylor1967"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3144">The '''''Star of the West''''' was a [[Bahá'í_literature#Periodicals|Bahá'í periodical]] which began publication on March 21, 1910 and ended publication under this title in March 1935.&lt;ref name="intro"&gt;{{cite web|author=Duane K. Troxel|title=An Introduction to Sifter - Star of the West|work=Bahai-Education|url=http://bahai-education.org/star-of-the-west|accessdate=25 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor to ''Star of the West'' was a publication named ''The Bahai Bulletin'' published in New York City from 1908 for eight months ending early in 1909. In early 1910, Bahá'ís from Chicago and New York consulted and the New York Board of Counsel (a precursor of a Bahá'í [[Local Spiritual Assembly]]) decided not to revive the ''Bahai Bulletin'' and telegraphed Albert Windust to proceed with the magazine.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

''Star of the West'' began life as ''Bahai News'' on March 21, 1910. Its editors were Albert Windust and Gertrude Buikema. It was about three by six inches and nine pages long. A [[Photographic print toning#Sepia toning|sepia photograph]] of [[Mírzá Mihdí]] was glued onto the first page of its inaugural issue.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

Others involved with its publication over its history were [[Albert Vail|Albert and Emily Vail]], Dr. [[Zia Bagdadi]], [[Ahmad Sohrab]], [[Edna M. True]]; with [[Horace Holley (1887–1960)|Horace Holley]] and [[Stanwood Cobb]] being singled out as early contributors.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

The publication continued to bear the name "Star of the West" until November 1922, a year after the passing of [['Abdu'l-Bahá]], when that name became a subtitle under the smaller type heading of ''The Bahai Magazine''. In April 1931, the subtitle "Star of the West" disappeared altogether from the printed version. The name re-appeared on the spines of annual hardbound volumes.&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt; The magazine ''World Order'' replaced ''Star of the West'' (reflecting a change oriented toward acquiring a more broad readership than when the publication was first issued).&lt;ref name="intro"/&gt;

The periodical featured translations of some Tablets of [['Abdu'l-Bahá]] and writings from [[Shoghi Effendi]] along with sharing news of the Bahá'í world.

The text was mostly in English, but also often offered a [[Persian language|Persian]] language section with its own content.

{{History of Malaysia}}

'''The Sultanate of Sarawak''' ({{lang-ms|Kesultanan Melayu Sarawak}}; [[Jawi script|Jawi]]:كسلطانن ملايو سراوق) was a [[Malay people|traditional Malay kingdom]], precursor of the present-day [[Kuching Division]], [[Sarawak]]. The kingdom was founded in 1599 and witnessed the reign of a sole Sultan, [[Sultan Tengah|Sultan Tengah Manga]], known as Ibrahim Ali Omar Shah of Sarawak.&lt;ref name="Porritt 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Porritt|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The state established close relationship with [[Bruneian Empire|Brunei]], [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]] and forged dynastic rules to the surrounding Malay kingdoms in western Borneo including [[Sultanate of Sambas|Sambas]], [[Sukadana]] and [[Tanjungpura Kingdom|Tanjungpura-Matan]].&lt;ref name="Bruneidesi 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Bruneidesi|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom was dissolved following Sultan Tengah's assassination in 1641. The administration of the territory was then replaced by the local Malay governors appointed from Brunei, [[Political union|reunifying]] the area into Brunei prior to the [[White Rajah]] era.

== History ==
[[File:Sultan_Brunei_in_the_Sarawakian_Royal_Mausoleum.jpg|thumb|right|[[Hassanal Bolkiah]], the [[Sultan of Brunei Darussalam]] during his [[state visit]] to the Royal Tomb of Ibrahim Ali Omar Shah in Sarawak. Both rulers are the direct descendants of [[Muhammad Hassan (Brunei)|Muhammad Hassan]], the tenth sultan of Brunei.]]

=== Origin ===
According to the ''Salahsilah Raja-Raja Brunei'' (Bruneian Royal Annals), the state was established following the demise of [[Muhammad Hassan (Brunei)|Sultan Muhammad Hassan]], the monarch of Bruneian Empire who ruled between 1582 to 1598. The death of the sultan witnessed the [[enthronement]] of [[Abdul Jalilul Akbar]], the eldest prince of Muhammad Hassan as the Sultan of Brunei. However, the crowning of Abdul Jalil Akbar was objected by [[Sultan Tengah|Pengiran Muda Tengah]], claiming that the status of Abdul Jalilul was invalid as the elder prince was born before their father become the Sultan, in contrast to the Pengiran who was born after his father’s ascension to the throne, hence he believed that he had the superior right to inherit the kingdom.&lt;ref name="Danielle Sendou Ringgit 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Danielle Sendou Ringgit|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already anticipating this dispute, the newly crowned Sultan of Brunei appointed the Pengiran Muda Tengah as the Sultan of [[Kuching Division|Sarawak]], a frontier territory far from the central core of the Bruneian kingdom. The departure of the Pengiran was accompanied by more than 1000 soldiers from the Sakai, [[Kedayan]], and [[Kilanas, Brunei-Muara|Bunut]] tribes, natives of Borneo. A coterie of Bruneian nobility also followed him to develop the administration system in the new kingdom.&lt;ref name="Sarawak State Secretary Office 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Sarawak State Secretary Office|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today, a number of Kuching and Sambas Malay community can trace their origin from the pioneers.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The new Sultan constructed a [[fort]]ified palace in [[Kuching|Sungai Bedil]], [[Santubong (federal constituency)|Santubong]], morphing the area into the royal, judicial and administrate capital of the kingdom. He began appoint his deputies and delegates, incorporating the position of Datu Seri Setia, Datu Shahbandar Indera Wangsa, Datu Amar Setia Diraja and Datuk Temenggong Laila Wangsa in the governance system. He proclaimed as the sultan after completing the administration system of the new kingdom, bearing the regal name of Sultan Ibrahim Ali Omar Shah. According to Sambas Royal records, Sultan Tengah Manga was known as Sultan Abdul Jalil.&lt;ref name="Kaffah 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaffah|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarawak–Johor diplomatic crisis ===
By the early 17th century, Sultan Tengah was in Pahang (then an autonomous-kingdom in Johor) to visit his aunt, Raja Bondan, the Queen consort. Before he left, he elected four [[Datu]]s (nobleman) to administer the kingdom. His aunt was married to the sultan, [[Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah of Pahang|Abdul Ghafur Muhiuddin Shah]]. While in Johor, he was invited to perform a courtly dance. It was during the performance that one of the dancer almost hit the face of Sultan Tengah with a handkerchief, by accident. The furious Sultan Tengah then slapped the dancer. This caused a disappointed by the Sultan of Pahang, he then ordered the Sarawakian Royal entourage to immediately left his kingdom.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While based on the Sultanate of Sambas narration, Sultan Tengah was requested to leave the Johorean soil for his refusal to marry Princess Cik Zohra upon the request of his queen aunt.

=== Sarawak–Sukadana alliance ===
The royal entourage was hit by a major storm during their return voyage to [[Borneo]]. The vessel was then blew off course and arrived to the shores of the [[Sukadana|Sukadana Kingdom]].&lt;ref name="Kaffah 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaffah|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The polity of Sukanada was ruled by a [[Javanese people|Javanese]] [[Hindu]] King, Penambahan Giri Mustika, he was later known as Sultan Muhammad Saifuddin after his conversion to Islam by Sheikh Shamsuddin, a missionary from Mecca. It was also during his time in Sukadana that Sultan Tengah commenced his religious studies under the guidance of Sheikh Shamsuddin.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Sultan later wedded Princess Puteri Surya Kesuma, sister of the reigning monarch. He also briefly settled in Sukadana and requested permission to carry out missionary activities to the local populace. His request was permitted and granted the land around the Sambas river to perform his duties. By 1600, he departed Sukadana to Sambas together with an entourage of 40 vessels with armed men.

The royal entourage arrived and built a settlement around Kuala Bangun, near the [[Sambas Regency|Sambas river]]. It was during the time in Sambas that the Puteri gave birth to a prince, Radin Sulaiman. She later gave birth to following two childrens, Pengiran Badaruddin (later become Pengiran Bendahara Seri Maharaja) and Pengiran Abdul Wahab (Pengiran Temenggong Jaya Kesuma).

=== Sarawak–Sambas union ===
[[File:Masjid 100613-3156 sbs.jpg|thumb|The [[Jama Masjid|Jamek Mosque]] of Sambas Sultanate. The arrival of Sultan Tengah in Sambas revolutionised the ancient Hindu kingdom into a Malay Muslim Sultanate. The current ruling house of Sambas traced their lineage from the Sarawakian Sultan.]]
Located further up of the Sambas River, The sultan's arrival in Kota Lama was greatly celebrated by the Ratu Sapundak, the King of Kota Lama who welcomed the Sultan as the royal [[wikt:guest of honour|guest of honour]]. The King allowed Sultan Tengah to perform his missionary activities to the local populace, despite himself being a Hindu ruler of [[Majapahit]] descent. The long stay in Sambas also witnessed the marriage of his Sultan Tengah's prince, Radin Sulaiman to Puteri Mas Ayu Bongsu, the princess of Ratu Sapundak. The royal pair had a son named Radin Bima, who would later become the 2nd Sultan of Sambas.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Larsen 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the death of Ratu Sapundak, the throne of Sambas was succeeded by Pengiran Prabu Kenchana who appointed Radin Sulaiman as one of his advisers. Historical records narrated that Ratu Sapundak had desired to appoint Sultan Tengah as his successor due to his expertise in governance and administration, although his request was highly objected by the members of Sambas aristocrats due to their religious differences, with the members of the then-Sambas nobility was predominantly of Hindu faith. However, this would change in 1631, when Radin Sulaiman rise to the crown of Sambas, bearing the regal name of Sri Paduka al-Sultan Tuanku Muhammad Safiuddin I, the first muslim ruler of the Sambas Kingdom.&lt;ref name="Kaffah 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Kaffah|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sarawak–Matan ===
By 1630, the sultan departed to [[Tanjungpura Kingdom|Matan]]. In Matan, he married a local princess. The marriage issued a prince, Pengiran Mangku Negara, who later become the Sultan of Matan. It was after a few years in Matan that he decided to return to Sarawak.&lt;ref name="Gregory 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Gregory|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return and death ===
After staying a few years in Matan, the sultan decided to return to Sarawak. In 1641, he and his party settled in Batu Buaya, [[Santubong (federal constituency)|Santubong]] while en route to Sarawak.&lt;ref name="Tunku Hilda 2015"&gt;{{harvnb|Tunku Hilda|2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during his time in Batu Buaya that he was assassinated by one of his escorts.&lt;ref name="Danielle Sendou Ringgit 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Danielle Sendou Ringgit|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tomi 2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Tomi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the news of the death of the sultan arrived in Sarawak, Datu Patinggi, Shahbandar Datu, Datu Amar and Datu Temenggong departed to Santubong to complete the funeral rites of the sultan based on the Bruneian Royal customs. The Queen consort, Ratu Surya Kesuma decided to return to the Kingdom of Sukananda after his demise.&lt;ref name="Tomi 2014"&gt;{{harvnb|Tomi|2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The kingdom was then reunified with Brunei following the death of the popular sultan, marking the end of an era. The local Sarawakian administration was then succeeded to the local governors appointed by the Bruneian monarch.

== Legacy ==
The [[cemetery|final resting place]] of the first and the final sultan of Sarawak was discovered in 1993, located in Kampong Batu Buaya.&lt;ref name="Arkib Negara Malaysia 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Arkib Negara Malaysia|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sygic 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Sygic|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[mausoleum|royal mausoleum]] was constructed in May 1995 following the rediscovery of the tomb.&lt;ref name="Larsen 2012"&gt;{{harvnb|Larsen|2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The monument was visited by Hassanal Bolkiah, the Sultan of Brunei during his state visit to Sarawak in 2007.

The death of the sultan witnessed the demise of the Sultanate of Sarawak. Nonetheless, his reign was instrumental to the sociopolitical framework of western shores of Borneo.&lt;ref name="Utusan Borneo Online 2016"&gt;{{harvnb|Utusan Borneo Online|2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He established his capital in Sungai Bedil which then prospered into [[Kuching]] during the [[White Rajah]] era. He also had incorporated the position of Datu Patinggi, Shahbandar Datu, Datu Amar and Datu Temenggong in the Sarawak administration system that can be seen today. While his missionary activities also transformed the native Hindu society into a Malay Muslim community in coastal Borneo, while his political marriage and alliances established new dynastic houses to the kingdoms of Sambas and Matan.&lt;ref name="Bruneidesi 2017"&gt;{{harvnb|Bruneidesi|2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Unchurch.jpg|right|250px|thumb|Altar in [[Newman University Church]], [[Dublin]], prepared for a Traditional Latin Mass]]

'''Traditionalist Catholicism''' is a movement in favour of restoring many or all of the customs, traditions, [[liturgy|liturgical]] forms, public and private devotions and presentations of the teaching of the [[Catholic Church]] before the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65). It is associated with an attachment to the pre-1970 [[Tridentine Mass|Roman Rite Mass]], referred to as the Traditional Latin Mass.

Traditionalist Catholics were disturbed by the liturgical transformations of the Second Vatican Council, arguing that it stripped the liturgy of its outward sacredness and made it too Protestant, eroding faith in the [[Real Presence]] of Christ in the [[Eucharist]]. Many also oppose the social teachings given by the Church during and after the Council, and that on [[ecumenism]], claiming that the latter blurs the lines between Catholicism and other religions.

About 1% of people who identify as Catholic claim to be "traditional",  but the number of practicing Catholics who consider themselves "traditional" may be as high as 11%.&lt;ref name="Percentage"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://charlescarrollsociety.com/2015/06/16/sspx-fssp-catholic-percentage-of-traditional-catholics-in-idaho-montana-and-wyoming/ |title=#SSPX, #FSSP, #Catholic – Percentage of traditional Catholics in Idaho, Montana, and Wyoming |date=June 16, 2015 |publisher=''Charles Carroll Society'' |access-date=January 4, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vast majority of traditional Catholics regard the newer rites of the sacraments and the post-Vatican II popes as valid, and attend traditional Masses offered by diocesan priests, the [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] (ICRSS), FSSP, or SSPX. Some attend the Mass as revised in 1969, referred to as the [[Mass of Paul VI|Novus Ordo Mass]], if no Traditional Latin Mass is available to them, while regarding it as inferior; others refuse to attend the Novus Ordo Mass, even if there is no Traditional Latin Mass.

==History==
The traditionalist movement traces its roots to at least the early 1970s, when conservative Catholics opposed to or uncomfortable with the social and liturgical changes brought about by Second Vatican Council began to coalesce. In 1970, French Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] founded the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX), made up of priests who would say only the Traditional Latin Mass and who stood opposed to what he saw as excessive liberal influences in the Church. Over time, Lefebvre's movement grew despite split-offs by various offshoot groups. Some Catholics, many never affiliated with Lefebvre, took the position of [[sedevacantism]], which teaches John XXIII and his successors are heretics and cannot therefore be considered popes, and that the new Church and new expressions of the sacraments are not valid. Other, marginal groups known as [[conclavism|conclavists]] have elected their own popes in opposition to the men generally considered by the world to be the true popes. The [[Society of Saint Pius V]] (SSPV) broke off from Lefebvre over its objections to the SSPX's use of the missal of [[Pope John XXIII]], preferring the much older 1570 missal of [[Pope Pius V]], and publicly questioning the legitimacy of the post-Vatican II popes. Lefebvre officially renounced these positions, but his movement still drew the suspicion of Roman authorities. In 1988, he and another bishop [[Écône consecrations|consecrated]] four men as bishops without papal permission, resulting in an ''[[Latae sententiae]]'' [[excommunication]] for all six men directly involved, not of the Society. The excommunications were lifted for the surviving bishops by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w2.vatican.va/content/benedict-xvi/en/letters/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20090310_remissione-scomunica.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI, 10 March 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the SSPX, unwilling to participate in what they considered [[schism]], left and founded the [[Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter]] (FSSP), which celebrates the Traditional Latin Mass but in full communion with the Holy See. During the papacy of Pope Benedict XVI, numerous attempts were made to bring the SSPX back from its separation from the authority of the Church, including the lifting of the excommunications on the four surviving bishops. These failed, but the efforts of the SSPX to negotiate with Rome led to the establishment of the minority [[SSPX Resistance]].

==Different types of traditionalists==
[[File:Palm-sunday-latin-mass.jpg|right|250px|thumb|[[Tridentine Mass]] in a [[chapel]] of the [[Cathedral of the Holy Cross, Boston|Cathedral of the Holy Cross]], [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]], Palm Sunday 2009]]
Traditionalist Catholics may be divided into four broad groups.

===Traditionalists in good standing with the Holy See===
Since the Second Vatican Council, several traditionalist organizations have been started with or have subsequently obtained approval from the Catholic Church. These organizations accept in principle the documents of the Second Vatican Council, and regard the changes associated with the Council (such as the revision of the Mass) as legitimate, if often prudentially unwise, but celebrate the older forms with the approval of the Holy See.&lt;ref&gt;See, for instance, the decrees of erection of the [http://www.fssp.org/en/decerec.htm Priestly Fraternity of St Peter] and of the [http://la.revue.item.free.fr/commission_pontifical.htm Institute of the Good Shepherd]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Priestly Fraternity of St Peter]] (FSSP)
* [[Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest]] (ICRSS),
* [[Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer]]
* [[Institute of the Good Shepherd]] (IGS)
* Servants of Jesus and Mary ([[Servi Jesu et Mariae]], SJM)
* [[Canons Regular of the New Jerusalem]] (CRNJ)
* [[Canons Regular of Saint John Cantius]] (SJC)
* [http://www.cruzios.org/ Canons Regular of the Holy Cross]
* [[Fraternity of Saint Vincent Ferrer]]
* [[Personal Apostolic Administration of Saint John Mary Vianney]] (PAASJV)
* [[Miles Christi religious order|Miles Christi]] (MC)

There are also multiple monastic communities, including
* [[Monastery of Our Lady of the Annunciation of Clear Creek]]
* [[Monastery of St. Benedict (Norcia)|Monastery of St. Benedict in Norcia]]
* [[Monks of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel]]
*[[Monastery of Our Lady of the Cenacle]]
*[[Le Barroux Abbey]]

See [[Communities using the Tridentine Mass]] for a more detailed list.

In addition, many traditionalist Catholics in good standing with Rome are served by local diocesan or religious priests who are willing and able to offer the traditional rites. Many other Catholics who sympathize with or who identify themselves as traditionalist are not able to attend the traditional liturgy regularly because it is not offered in their area (at least not with regular canonical standing) and attend the [[Mass of Paul VI]], the current ordinary or normal&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2007/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20070707_lettera-vescovi_en.html Letter of Pope Benedict XVI accompanying his motu proprio] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''&lt;/ref&gt; Roman Rite of Mass following the [[Second Vatican Council]].  Others may attend the liturgies of [[Eastern Catholic Churches]], if they are available. There are also numerous local and international lay organizations of traditionalist Catholics, such as the youth-groups of [[Juventutem]].

Traditionalist Catholics are considered by some to differ from neo-conservatives in that the neo-conservative bases his entire belief system on the teaching of the present magisterium, while the traditionalist interprets the present with the perspective of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.christianorder.com/features/features_2001/features_mar01.html |title=Operative Points of View |last=Ripperger |first=Chad |publisher=Christianorder.com |date=March 2001 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Traditionalists viewed by the Holy See as of irregular status===
Some traditionalists receive the Sacraments from priests considered suspended ''a divinis'' by Church authorities, though these priests and the Catholics that flock to them affirm their loyalty to the Church, while at the same time affirming that teachings of the Second Vatican Council on ecumenism, religious liberty, and collegiality are inconsistent with Catholic teaching and doctrine. They form what Julie Byrne terms the right wing of [[independent Catholicism]]: "Independents vary widely, ranging from right to left in the political spectrum. On the right traditionalist churches practice versions of Catholicism more conservative than Rome. These include the [[Society of St. Pius X]], founded by [[Marcel Lefebvre]], as well as the [[Mount St. Michael]]'s community in [[Spokane, Washington]], and actor [[Mel Gibson]]'s church in [[Malibu, California]], which made headlines when he directed the movie, ''[[The Passion of the Christ]]'', in 2004. On the left stand groups such as the [[Catholic Apostolic Church of Antioch|Church of Antioch]], the [[Ecumenical Catholic Communion]], and the White-Robed Monks of St. Benedict."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=88V1CwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Julie Byrne, ''The Other Catholics: Remaking America's Largest Religion'' (Columbia University Press 2016), p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;

The largest priestly society to fit this description is the [[Society of Saint Pius X]] (SSPX), which was founded in 1970, with the authorisation of the bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg|Lausanne, Geneva and Fribourg]], by Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]]. Members of this category view many of the post-Conciliar changes as doctrinally and pastorally unacceptable. They recognise the official Church hierarchy, while generally functioning independently of them and rejecting some decisions which they perceive as inconsistent with the Catholic faith, or ineffective in terms of catechesis and how the Catholic faith is passed down. This way of acting draws accusations of disloyalty and disobedience from many, including from members of the preceding groups that are recognised by the Holy See; on the other hand, the SSPX and groups like them consider their accusers guilty of blind obedience, which is not imposed by—and can be contrary to—the requirements of Catholic faith and morals. Discussions between the SSPX and the Holy See have been in progress for some years. In January 2009 the Prefect of the [[Congregation for Bishops]] remitted the excommunications which the Congregation had declared to have been incurred by the Society's bishops in 1988. Bishop [[Bernard Fellay]] of the Society expressed his gratitude for this act, though the Society has always held that the excommunications never took effect in the first place (citing canon 1323, §4, canon 1323, 7 and canon 1324, §3; §1, 8 of the 1983 [[Code of Canon Law]]). The Prefect of the Congregation for Bishops further expressed the hope that the Society would speedily return to "full communion" with the Church by showing "true fidelity and true acknowledgment of the Magisterium and the authority of the pope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicnews.com/data/stories/cns/0900355.htm |title=Pope lifts excommunications of Lefebvrite bishops |publisher=Catholicnews.com |date=January 27, 2009|accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SSPX rejects the notion of "full" and "partial" communion with the Church, insisting that they belong to the Church according to the criteria given by Pope Pius XII, because they have the same faith, celebrate the same Sacraments, and recognise the same hierarchy of the Church. More recently, the Vatican has granted priests of the SSPX the authority to hear confessions and has authorised local ordinaries, in certain circumstances, to grant delegation to SSPX priests to act as the qualified witness required for valid celebration of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://en.radiovaticana.va/news/2017/04/04/new_pastoral_provisions_for_sacrament_of_marriage_for_sspx/1303274|title=New pastoral provisions for Sacrament of Marriage for SSPX|access-date=2017-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each of these documents the hope was expressed that thereby "the process towards full institutional regularisation may be facilitated".

===Sedevacantists===
{{Main article|Sedevacantism}}
Sedevacantists hold that the post-Vatican II popes have forfeited their position through their acceptance of [[heresy|heretical teachings]] connected with the Second Vatican Council and consequently there is at present no known true pope.&lt;ref name=HDC&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=L8C3TKNdn5oC&amp;pg=PA399 |title=Historical Dictionary of Catholicism|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They conclude, on the basis of their rejection of the revised Mass rite and their rejection of certain aspects of postconciliar Church teaching as false, that the popes involved are also false.&lt;ref name=IUP&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yUqp1_31B-MC&amp;pg=PA257 |title=Being Right|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a minority position among traditionalist Catholics&lt;ref name=HDC/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCP&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qd5yzP5hdiEC&amp;pg=PA88 |title=Fundamentalisms Observed|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a highly divisive one,&lt;ref name=IUP/&gt;&lt;ref name=UCP/&gt; so that many who hold it prefer to say nothing of their view,&lt;ref name=IUP/&gt; while other sedevacantists have accepted episcopal [[holy orders|ordination]] from sources such as Archbishop [[Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục]].&lt;ref name=UCP/&gt;

The terms ''sedevacantist'' and ''[[sedevacantism]]'' derive from the Latin phrase ''[[sede vacante]]'' ("while the chair/[[episcopal see|see]] [of [[Saint Peter]]] is vacant"),&lt;ref name=HDC/&gt; a term normally applied to the period between the death or resignation of one pope and the election of his successor.

The best-known, and likely best-organized Sedevacantist organization is the [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]] (CMRI). Many often refer to the [[Society of Saint Pius V]] (SSPV) as being a Sedevacantist organization as well; however, it has never formally adopted this position and considers the question of the validity of recent Papacies to be unresolved.

===Conclavists===
{{Main article|Conclavism}}
Conclavism is the belief and practice of some who, claiming that all recent occupants of the [[Holy See|papal see]] are not true popes, elect someone else [[antipope|and propose him as the true pope]] to whom the allegiance of Catholics is due. They are often classified as sedevacantists because they reject the official papal succession for the same reasons. Conclavist groups include the

* "[[True Catholic Church]]", founded by [[Lucian Pulvermacher]] ("[[Antipope|Pope]] Pius XIII")
* [[Palmarian Catholic Church]]
* [[David Bawden|Pope Michael]]

The Palmarian Church has drastically altered its worship and doctrines and as such is no longer considered Catholic by other traditionalists.

==Traditionalist positions==
[[File:Brasão de Dom Antônio de Castro Mayer.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Coat carved in a wooden door, of [[Antonio de Castro Mayer]], Bishop of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Campos|Campos]], [[Brazil]], one of the most important members of Catholic traditionalism in the world, the Lion symbolizes the fight of faith, that must be fought by Catholics.]]

Traditionalist Catholics believe that they are preserving Catholic orthodoxy by not accepting all changes introduced since the [[Second Vatican Council]], changes that some of them have described as amounting to a "veritable revolution". They claim that the positions now taken by mainstream Catholics—even conservative Catholics—would have been considered "modernist" or "liberal" at the time of the Council, and that they themselves hold positions that were then considered "conservative" or "traditional".

Many traditionalists further believe that errors have crept into the presentation and understanding of Catholic teachings since the time of the Council. They attribute the blame for this to liberal interpretations of the documents produced by the Second Vatican Council, to harmful post-conciliar pastoral decisions, to the text of the conciliar documents themselves, or to some combination of these.

Most traditionalists view the Council as a valid, albeit problematic, [[Ecumenical Council]] of the Catholic Church, though most [[sedevacantism|sedevacantists]] regard it as wholly invalid. It is common for traditionalists in dispute with Rome to affirm that the Council was "pastoral", and hence that its decrees were not absolutely binding on Catholics in the same way as the dogmatic decrees of other Ecumenical Councils. Support for this view is sought in Pope John XXIII's ''Opening Address to the Council'', [[Pope Paul VI]]'s [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/speeches/1965/documents/hf_p-vi_spe_19651207_epilogo-concilio_en.html closing address], statements from Pope Benedict XVI, and the lack of formal dogmatic definitions in the Conciliar documents.

[[Pope Benedict XVI]] contrasted the "hermeneutic of discontinuity and rupture" that some apply to the Council (an interpretation adopted both by certain traditionalists and by certain "progressives")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/news/2012/11/30/prefect-of-the-cdf-says-seeing-vatican-ii-as-a-rupture-is-heresy/|title=CatholicHerald.co.uk » Prefect of the CDF says seeing Vatican II as a ‘rupture’ is heresy|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opc.org/os.html?article_id=217|title=Orthodox Presbyterian Church|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the "hermeneutic of reform, as it was presented first by Pope John XXIII in his Speech inaugurating the Council on 11 October 1962 and later by Pope Paul VI in his Discourse for the Council's conclusion on 7 December 1965."&lt;ref name=Christmas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/speeches/2005/december/documents/hf_ben_xvi_spe_20051222_roman-curia_en.html |title=Address of His Holiness Benedict XVI to the Roman Curia offering them his Christmas greetings |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; He made a similar point in a speech to the bishops of Chile in 1988, when he was still Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Archbishop Lefebvre] declared that he has finally understood that the agreement he signed aimed only at integrating his foundation into the 'Conciliar Church'. The Catholic Church in union with the Pope is, according to him, the 'Conciliar Church' which has broken with its own past. It seems indeed that he is no longer able to see that we are dealing with the Catholic Church in the totality of its Tradition, and that Vatican II belongs to that.&lt;ref name=Ratzinger:Chile&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unavoce.org/cardinal_ratzinger_chile.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070715080331/http://www.unavoce.org/cardinal_ratzinger_chile.htm|title=Cardinal Ratzinger's Address to Bishops of Chile|archivedate=15 July 2007|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is some tension between different traditionalist groups at the official level: the SSPX, for example, condemns the FSSP and attendance at its Masses&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111016131146/http://sspx.org/SSPX_FAQs/q13_fraternity_of_st_peter.htm What are we to think of the Fraternity of Saint Peter?] sspx.org&lt;/ref&gt; and is also often in conflict with other traditionalists. In fact, the common denominator that is held by all the groups identifying as traditionalist is love of the traditional form of the Mass and the other sacraments, traditional devotions, a handful of teachings that they claim have become obscured since the Second Vatican Council, and, usually, suspicion of modern "neoconservative" Catholicism, which is viewed as shallow, ahistorical, and intellectually dishonest. On other questions, there are a variety of opinions.

Many traditionalist Catholics associate themselves with a particular priestly society. Other small groups of traditionalists sometimes form around an individual "independent" priest who has no ties with any particular organisation.

Some leaders of [[Independent Catholic Churches]] also claim to be traditionalist Catholics and to be preserving the [[Tridentine Mass]] and ancient traditions. Examples are the [[Apostolic Catholic Church]], the [[Canonical Old Roman Catholic Church]], and the [[Fraternite Notre Dame|Fraternité Notre-Dame]].

===Traditionalists' claims of discontinuity and rupture===
{{More footnotes|section|date=July 2013}} 
Traditionalists' claims that substantive changes have taken place in Catholic teaching and practice since the Council often crystallise around the following specific alleged examples, in which others see not what Pope Benedict XVI called "discontinuity and rupture", but what he called "renewal in the continuity of the one subject-Church which the Lord has given to us":&lt;ref name=Christmas/&gt;
* '''A new [[ecclesiology]]''' which they claim fails to recognise the Catholic Church as the one true church established by Jesus Christ, and instead holds that the Roman Catholic Church is some sub-set of the Church founded by Christ. They see some of the confusion as stemming from an unclear understanding of the phrase "[[subsistit in|subsists in]]" which appears in the Vatican II document ''Lumen gentium'', and which the Church has declared applies uniquely to the Catholic Church and means the "perduring, historical continuity and permanence of all the elements instituted by Christ in the Catholic Church, in which the Church of Christ is concretely found on this earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_20070629_responsa-quaestiones_en.html|title=Responses to Some Questions Regarding Certain Aspects of the Doctrine on the Church|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They claim that this "new ecclesiology" contradicts [[Pope Pius XII]]'s ''[[Mystici corporis Christi]]'' and other papal documents.
* '''A new [[ecumenism]]''' which they see as aiming at a false pan-Christian religious unity which does not require non-Catholics to convert to the Catholic faith. They see this as contradicting the teachings of the [[Bible]], Pope [[Pius XI]]'s ''[[Mortalium animos]],'' [[Pope Pius XII]]'s ''[[Humani generis]]'' and other documents.
* Acceptance of the '''principle of religious liberty''' as involving more than prudent religious tolerance, based on one interpretation of the Second Vatican Council's decree ''[[Dignitatis Humanae]]'', allegedly in contradiction to [[Pope Pius IX]]'s teachings in ''[[Quanta cura]]'' and the [[Syllabus of Errors]].
* '''A [[Mass of Paul VI|revision of the Mass liturgy]]''' of the Roman rite which, they affirm, de-emphasises the central Catholic doctrines that the Mass is a true [[Sacrifice#Sacrifice in Christianity|sacrifice]] and that the bread and wine are changed through [[transubstantiation]] into the body and blood of Jesus Christ, that it has been stripped of important prayers, that it is centered on the congregation rather than on God, that it is less beautiful and spiritually edifying, and that it omits certain Bible readings that mention subjects such as [[hell]], [[miracle]]s, and [[sin]]. Traditionalists hold differing opinions on the validity and acceptability of the revised rite of Mass:
** Some see it as valid, and as acceptable when necessary, though the [[Tridentine Mass|older form]] should be attended when possible.
** Some, including the leadership of the [[Society of St Pius X]], hold that it is in principle valid as a sacramental rite but maintain that the revisions in the liturgy are displeasing to God, and that it is often celebrated improperly to the extent of being sacramentally invalid. They therefore generally refuse to attend it.
** Some, including many sedevacantists, see it as categorically invalid in principle and entirely unacceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8nODQotcSfkC |title=Adam Miller, Is the New Mass of Pope Paul VI Invalid? |publisher=Books.google.com |date= 2006-07-01|accessdate=2011-06-30|isbn=9781411699786}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** Some hold that celebration of any modern-language translation even of the Tridentine Mass would have to be presumed invalid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traditio.com/comment/com1008.htm |title=August 25: A Reader Asks: "Can a Valid Mass Be Celebrated in a Vulgar Tongue?" |publisher=Traditio |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* An inappropriate emphasis on '''the "dignity of man"''', which they claim ignores [[original sin]] and the need for supernatural grace, and which they also claim has led to a utopianism that sees world peace as possible without recognising the kingship of Christ. They see this orientation as contradicting [[Pope Pius XI]]'s ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_11121925_quas-primas_en.html Quas Primas]'', Pope Leo XIII's ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_15051891_rerum-novarum_en.html Rerum Novarum],'' and other papal and conciliar documents.
* A teaching on '''[[Collegiality (Catholic Church)|collegiality]]''' that attributes to the bishops of the world a share, with the Pope, of responsibility for the Church's governance in a way that they claim is destructive of papal authority and encourages a "national" church mentality that undermines the primacy of the Holy See.  They also claim that national bishops' conferences, whose influence was greatly increased following the Council, "diminish the personal responsibility of bishop[s]" within their dioceses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation  | last = Wrighton | first = Basil | title = Collegiality: error of Vatican II | place = | publisher = Society of Saint Pius X | url = http://sspx.org/en/collegiality-error-vatican-ii-2 | accessdate = 3 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A new and critical attitude towards the Bible that, they say, contradicts Leo XIII's ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18111893_providentissimus-deus_en.html Providentissimus Deus]'' and Benedict XV's ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xv/encyclicals/documents/hf_ben-xv_enc_15091920_spiritus-paraclitus_en.html Spiritus Paraclitus]'', among other documents.
* A departure from the traditional belief that the Church and the world are at variance with one another to some degree, and that the Church has enemies. They believe that Pope Pius X's warnings in ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_x/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-x_enc_19070908_pascendi-dominici-gregis_en.html Pascendi Dominici Gregis],'' Leo XIII's ''[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/leo_xiii/encyclicals/documents/hf_l-xiii_enc_18840420_humanum-genus_en.html Humanum Genus]'' and other [[Opposition to Freemasonry within Christianity|papal warnings against Freemasonry]] and other alleged enemies of Christianity have gone unheeded.

==== Example of one such claimant ====
Georges de Nantes, a priest of the [[Diocese of Grenoble]] and founder of the traditionalist Catholic [[League for Catholic Counter-Reformation]], criticized the [[Second Vatican Council]] for encouraging [[ecumenism]] and reform of the Church, and accused [[Pope Paul VI]] of heresy and of turning the Church into a movement for advancing democracy, a system of government that de Nantes abhorred. The Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith issued a notification on 10 August 1969, stating that, as de Nantes continued to maintain his views on the Council, the ''[[aggiornamento]]'' of the Church, the French episcopate, and the "heresies" of Pope Paul VI, he thereby "disqualified the entirety of his writings and his activities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19690810_notification-abbe-nantes_fr.html |title=Notification concerning Abbé de Nantes |authorlink=[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] |work=L’Osservatore Romano |date=August 10, 1969 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It issued another notification in 1983, published on ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' of 16–17 May of that year, stating that de Nantes had come to Rome to present a "Book of Accusation against Pope John Paul II for Heresy, Schism and Scandal", and that the Secretary of the Congregation had received him, as instructed by the Pope, but had refused to accept from him a book that contained unjustified gravely offensive accusations of the same character as those that de Nantes had directed against Pope Paul VI in a book published in 1973. It added that the refusal of de Nantes to retract his previous attacks on Pope Paul VI and the Second Vatican Council, to which he was now adding attacks on Pope John Paul II, made it impossible to believe in the sincerity of his declaration in 1978 and 1981 of a desire for the reconciliation for which the Pope remained always disposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19830513_nantes-notification_fr.html |title=Notification concerning Abbé Georges de Nantes |authorlink=[[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] |work=L’Osservatore Romano |date=May 16–17, 1983 |accessdate=July 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Responses to traditionalists' claims===
Those who in response to these criticisms by certain traditionalists defend the decisions of the Second Vatican Council and the subsequent changes made by the Holy See make the following counterclaims:
* They say that the criticisms are false, exaggerated, or lacking appreciation of the organic character of Tradition, and give as examples traditionalist criticisms that [[Dignitatis Humanae]] contradicts the Church's earlier teaching on religious liberty,&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Brian W. Harrison, O.S. [https://web.archive.org/web/20060719043403/http://www.catholic.net/rcc/Periodicals/Dossier/00MarApr/continuity.html Vatican II and Religious Liberty: Contradiction or Continuity?] catholic.net&lt;/ref&gt; and that the revised rite of Mass represents a break rather than a prudent development of the earlier liturgy.
* They say that traditionalists who claim that there has been a break from and discontinuity with the Church's traditional teaching are displaying a Protestant attitude of "private judgement" on matters of doctrine, instead of accepting the guidance of the Magisterium of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/commentary/articles.cfm?id=345 |title=On Waffling, Tradition and the Magisterium |publisher=Catholicculture.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* They say that such traditionalists fail to distinguish properly between changeable pastoral practices (such as the liturgy of the Mass) and the unchangeable principles of the Catholic faith (such as the dogmas surrounding the Mass).
* They say that traditionalists of this kind treat papal authority in much the same way as the dissident, [[Cafeteria Catholic|liberal Catholics]]. While liberals believe that, on sexual matters, "the Pope can teach whatever he wants... but whether or not he should be listened to is very much an open question", the stance of certain traditionalists on the reform of the Mass liturgy and contemporary teachings on ecumenism and religious liberty amounts to the view that, on these issues, "faithful Catholics are always free to resist [the Pope's] folly.... As theories of religious dissent go, Catholic liberals couldn't ask for anything more."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8OL9tyvN5YcC Michael W. Cuneo, The Smoke of Satan: Conservative and Traditionalist Dissent in Contemporary American Catholicism (JHU Press, 1999] {{ISBN|0-8018-6265-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8018-6265-6}}), p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;
* The traditionalist claim that the Second Vatican Council was pastoral is often countered by referring to Paul VI subsequently emphasising the authoritative nature of the Council's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;"In view of the pastoral nature of the Council, it avoided any extraordinary statement of dogmas that would be endowed with the note of infallibility, but it still provided its teaching with the authority of the supreme ordinary Magisterium. This ordinary Magisterium, which is so obviously official, has to be accepted with docility, and sincerity by all the faithful, in accordance with the mind of the Council on the nature and aims of the individual documents" ([http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/audiences/1966/documents/hf_p-vi_aud_19660112_it.html General Audience of 12 January 1966])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sedevacantists' criticisms of certain other traditionalists===
Sedevacantists claim that they avoid much of the mainstream Catholic critique of traditionalism because their view is that, beginning with [[John XXIII]] or [[Paul VI]], one or both of whom and all their successors they consider to be heretics, there is no valid Catholic Pope or body of bishops to whom allegiance or obedience is owed. They criticise non-sedevacantist traditionalists for recognising the recent Popes, on grounds such as the following:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. a talk available as audio files at this sedevacantist [http://www.sedevacantist.com/conference.html website]&lt;/ref&gt;
* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who declare that the [[Mass of Paul VI|revised]] liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] promulgated and defended by these popes undermines the faith thereby teach that the Church can decree evil and has decreed evil.
* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who declare that the teachings of the Second Vatican Council contradict the Church's Tradition, thereby either repudiate the teaching of the [[First Vatican Council]] on the infallibility of even the ordinary and universal magisterium of the Pope and the bishops, or they implicitly deny that the Pope and bishops at the Second Vatican Council were truly the Pope and truly Catholic bishops.
* They say that those non-sedevacantist traditionalists who consider a pope legitimate but refuse subjection to him contravene the famous Bull ''[[Unam sanctam]]'' in which [[Pope Boniface VIII]] stated: "... we declare, we proclaim, we define that it is absolutely necessary for salvation that every human creature be subject to the Roman Pontiff."
* Compounding the problem, according to the sedevacantists, is the revising of the rite of Holy Orders in 1968; many believe that priests and bishops consecrated according to the new rite are invalid and could not administer traditional sacraments even if they wanted to. They say this problem applies to the FSSP and even to many SSPX priests, since the SSPX accepts priests ordained in the new rite, although it ordains its own new priests in the old. According to this line of reasoning, Benedict XVI and Francis are only priests, and never received valid episcopal consecration, and therefore have been given no true authority to be Pope, i.e., the Bishop of Rome.

===Radical traditional Catholicism-critique===
"[[Integrism]]" is a term used to describe traditionalist Catholicism especially in a social and political context. Kay Chadwick writes: "It would be naive to suppose that [Catholic integrism] does not harbour a political agenda. It is both anti-Masonic and anti-Communist. It finds a voice in the Right-wing press. ... The annual Joan of Arc procession in Paris brings together integrists and [[National Front (France)|National Front]] supporters. The annual National Front party celebration is preceded by a [[Latin Mass]], celebrated in the [[Tridentine Mass|pre-1970 form]]. Just before his death in March 1988, [[Marcel Lefebvre|Lefebvre]] was fined eight thousand francs by the Court of Appeal in Paris for 'racial defamation' and 'incitement to racial hatred', for suggesting publicly that immigrants, beginning with Muslims, should be expelled from Europe. In 1976, he declared his support for Latin American dictatorships.

The [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] (SPLC) used the terms "radical traditionalist Catholics" to describe those who "may make up the largest single group of serious [[anti-Semites]] in America, subscribe to an ideology that is rejected by the Vatican and some 70 million mainstream American Catholics. Many of their leaders have been condemned and even [[excommunicate]]d by the official church."&lt;ref name="rtci"&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-files/ideology/radical-traditional-catholicism "Radical Traditional Catholicism"], ''[[Intelligence Files]]'', Southern Poverty Law Center, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The SPLC claims that adherents of radical traditional Catholicism "routinely pillory Jews as 'the perpetual enemy of Christ'",&lt;ref name=rtci/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.splcenter.org/get-informed/intelligence-report/browse-all-issues/2006/winter/the-new-crusaders "Radical Traditionalist Catholics Spew Anti-Semitic Hate, Commit Violence Against Jews"], Southern Poverty Law Center, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; reject the [[ecumenism|ecumenical]] efforts of the Vatican, and sometimes assert all recent Popes are illegitimate.&lt;ref name=rtci/&gt; The SPLC says that adherents are "incensed by the liberalizing reforms" of the [[Second Vatican Council]] (1962–65) which condemned hatred for Jewish people and "rejected the [[Jewish deicide|accusation that Jews are collectively responsible for deicide]] in the form of the crucifixion of Christ"&lt;ref name=rtci/&gt; and that "Radical traditional Catholics" also embrace "extremely [[Social conservatism|conservative social ideals]] with respect to women."&lt;ref name=rtci/&gt;

The SPLC clarifies, however, "Radical traditionalists are not the same as Catholics who call themselves 'traditionalists' — people who prefer the old Latin Mass to the mass now typically said in vernacular languages — although the radicals, as well, like their liturgy in Latin."&lt;ref name="rtci"/&gt;

==Traditionalist practices==

===Rite of Mass===
[[Image:Santa Cecilia.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Altar of [[Santa Cecilia in Trastevere]], erected in 1700 and still used today. It faces both east and ''versus populum'' (towards the people).]]
The best-known and most visible sign of Catholic traditionalism is an attachment to the form that the [[Roman Rite]] liturgy of the [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] had before the [[Mass of Paul VI|liturgical reform]] of 1969–1970, in the various editions of the [[Roman Missal]] published between 1570 and 1962. This form is generally known as the [[Tridentine Mass]], though traditionalists usually prefer to call it the ''Traditional Mass''. Many refer to it as the ''[[Latin Mass]]'', though the [[Mass of Paul VI]] that replaced it can also be celebrated in [[Latin]] (Latin is the original language of all liturgical documents in the Roman Rite). In his 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' [[Pope Benedict XVI]] relaxed the regulations on use of the 1962 Missal, designating it "an [[extraordinary form of the Roman Rite]]". Some refer to it, less exactly, as "''the'' extraordinary form".

Different traditionalist priests use different editions of the [[Roman Missal]] to celebrate the Tridentine Mass. Most, not only those in good standing with the Holy See but also such as those in the SSPX, use the 1962 edition, the only one that the Holy See authorises. A series of modifications to the 1962 liturgy introduced in 1965 are used by some traditionalists in good standing with Rome. This version of the liturgy is sometimes referred to as that of the "1965 Missal", though no new edition of the Roman Missal was in fact published in that year.

Since sedevacantists consider John XXIII not to have been a Pope, they reject the 1962 typical edition of the Roman Missal, which he promulgated. They generally use the 1920 typical edition, updated to some date previous to 1962. The [[Congregation of Mary Immaculate Queen]] follows the Missal as in 1955, accepting the changes introduced by Pius XII, but others reject [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|his alteration]] of the calendar of saints and [[Liturgical reforms of Pope Pius XII|his revision]] of the rites of [[Holy Week]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=112 ''Maxima Redemptionis''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204094636/http://www.strobertbellarmine.net/forums/viewtopic.php?t=112 |date=2009-02-04 }} of 16 November 1955 (AAS 47 (1955) 838–847)&lt;/ref&gt; Thus these others reject both John XXIII's 1962 edition and Pius XII's changes, seeing them as steps that led to the [[Novus Ordo Missae]]. There are no reports of priests regularly using any typical edition of the Missal earlier than that of 1920, which incorporated the rubrical and calendar changes made by Pope Pius X in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Printings based on the earlier typical editions of 1884 or 1634, which immediately preceded that of 1920, would now be very difficult to find. However, the ''Libreria Editrice Vaticana'' made the ''editio princeps'' of 1570, the original Tridentine Mass as promulgated by Pope Pius V, available in reproduction in 1998 ({{ISBN|88-209-2547-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

Linked with the celebration of the Tridentine Mass is the observance of the liturgical calendar of saints' days as it existed before the revision of 1969 (see [[General Roman Calendar of 1960]]). Some also ignore the revisions of 1960 by Pope John XXIII, and of [[General Roman Calendar of Pope Pius XII|1955 by Pope Pius XII]], and use instead the [[General Roman Calendar of 1954]].

===Individual and private devotions===
Many traditionalist Catholics lay stress on following customs prevailing immediately before the Second Vatican Council, such as the following:
* '''Abstaining from meat on Fridays'''. Present discipline maintains Fridays and Lent as days and times of penance, declares that abstinence from meat or some other food as determined by the local [[episcopal conference]] is to be observed on all Fridays (excluding solemnities) and on Ash Wednesday, and allows episcopal conferences to permit other practices of personal penance to take the place of abstinence from meat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ENG1104/__P4O.HTM |title=Canons 1249–1253 of the Code of Canon Law |publisher=Vatican.va |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Fasting for at least 3 hours before receiving [[Eucharist|Holy Communion]]'''. It was in 1966, after the Second Vatican Council, that Pope Paul VI reduced the fast to one hour, a rule included in the 1983 Code of Canon Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P38.HTM |title=Canon 919 |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Pope Pius XII abolished the traditional rule of fasting since midnight, requiring only a 3-hour fast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/PAPALDOC/P12FAST.HTM |title=Motu proprio ''Sacram communionem'' |publisher=Ewtn.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Kneeling to receive Communion directly upon the tongue''', under the Host species alone, and from the hand of a cleric rather than a layperson. Some would refuse to receive even from deacons, who, before the reforms of [[Pope Paul VI]], were allowed to give Holy Communion only if there were a serious reason for permitting them to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.intratext.com/IXT/LAT0813/_P2P.HTM |title=canon 845 of the 1917 Code of Canon Law |publisher=Intratext.com |date=2007-05-04 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many traditionalists regard the practice of receiving communion in the hand, though ancient&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=d_HP1iaiCcgC&amp;hl=en Anscar J.

Accordingly, many traditionalist women, though not all,&lt;ref&gt;Not all the women attending Mass in the SSPX church of St Nicholas de Chardonnet in Paris, as seen in this [http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1872714663680800365 video], even those singing in the choir, wore a head covering.&lt;/ref&gt; wear a [[mantilla]] or some other type of veil, a hat, or a headscarf when inside a church.
* '''[[Frequent confession]]''', a practice that grew in the first half of the 20th century, when increasingly frequent Communion led to more frequent confession.
* '''Prayers such as the [[Stations of the Cross]] and the [[Rosary]]''' in the form in use in the mid-20th century, and so without the alterations in the number and identity of the Stations that became common, though by no means universal, in the time of Pope Paul VI and without the addition of the [[Rosary#Luminous Mysteries|Luminous Mysteries]] of the Rosary given as an option by Pope John Paul II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/apost_letters/documents/hf_jp-ii_apl_20021016_rosarium-virginis-mariae_en.html |title=''Rosarium Virginis Mariae'', 19 |publisher=Vatican.va |date=16 October 2002 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These practices are, of course, not confined to traditionalists: many mainstream Catholics also follow them.  Likewise, they are not all followed by all traditionalist Catholics at all times.

===Traditionalism and the Eastern Catholic Churches===
Opposition to the Post-Conciliar doctrine and attempts to remove [[Roman Rite]] borrowings have caused a very small Traditionalist backlash in the [[Eastern Catholic Churches]] as well. The dispute has been most highly publicized within the [[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church]]. In some other Eastern Catholic Churches, however, there are small numbers who try to hold to practices as they were before the 1958 death of Pope Pius XII.

====Background====
The [[Holy See]] has argued since before the Second Vatican Council that [[Liturgical Latinisation|Latinization]] was never an organic development. Frequently cited examples of this are [[Pope Leo XIII]]'s 1894 [[encyclical]] ''[[Orientalium dignitas]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Leo13/l13orient.htm|title=ORIENTALIUM DIGNITAS|publisher=|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Saint Pius X]]'s instructions that the priests of the [[Russian Byzantine Catholic Church]] should offer the Liturgy, "No More, No Less, and No Different," than the Orthodox and [[Old Ritualist]] clergy.

Liturgical De-Latinization began with the 1930s corrections of the liturgical books by Metropolitan [[Andrey Sheptytsky]]. According to his biographer [[Cyril Korolevsky]], however, Metropolitan Andrey opposed the use of coercive force against those who remained attached to Latin Rite practices. He expressed fear that any attempt to do so would lead to a Greek Catholic equivalent of the [[Raskol|1666 Schism]] within the [[Russian Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref&gt;Cyril Korolevsky, ''Metropolitan Andrew (1868-1944)'', Translated and Edited by Fr. Serge Keleher. Stauropegion Brotherhood, Lviv, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

The De-Latinisation of the UGCC gained further momentum with the 1964 decree ''[[Orientalium Ecclesiarum]]'' of the [[Second Vatican Council]]) and several subsequent documents. This resulted in the Latinisations being discarded within the [[Ukrainian diaspora]]. The Soviet annexation of Western Ukraine had meanwhile forced Byzantine Catholics into a clandestine existence and the Latinizations continued to be widely used in underground parishes, seminaries, and religious communities. After the prescription against the UGCC was lifted in 1989, numerous UGCC priests and Hierarchs arrive from the diaspora and attempted to enforce liturgical conformity. This has provoked widespread opposition.

====SSPX and the Eastern churches====
The [[Priestly Society of Saint Josaphat]], which operates a seminary, Basilian convent, and numerous parishes, alleges ties to the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church, while simultaneously receiving priestly orders from the bishops of the SSPX. The PSSJ's superior, Father [[Basil Kovpak]], has accused the UGCC hierarchy of using intense psychological pressure against priests who are reluctant or unwilling to de-Latinise. He alleges that numerous laity, who have been attached to the Latinisations since the Soviet persecution of the UGCC, would prefer to stay home on Sunday rather than attend a de-Latinised liturgy.

The SSJK opposes the removal of the [[stations of the cross]], the [[rosary]] and the [[monstrance]] from the liturgy and parishes of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. They also reject the replacement of the UGCC's [[liturgical language]], [[Old Church Slavonic]], with the [[vernacular]] [[Ukrainian language]]. In his memoir ''Persecuted Tradition'', Fr. Kovpak also cites numerous examples of the UGCC turning away Orthodox clergy and laity who wish to convert to Eastern Catholicism. In many cases, he alleges, this is because the converts are not ethnically Ukrainian.

In 2003, [[Lubomyr Husar|Cardinal Lubomyr]] excommunicated SSJK superior Kovpak from the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Kovpak appealed this punishment at the papal [[Sacra Rota Romana]] in [[Vatican City]] and the excommunication was declared null and void by reason of a lack of canonical form.

In 2006, the SSJK got [[Latin Church|Latin]] [[Bishop]] [[Richard Williamson (bishop)|Richard Williamson]], at that time a member of the SSPX, to ordain two priests and seven deacons in [[Warsaw]], [[Poland]], an action that violated canons 1015 §2, 1021 and 1331 §2 of the Code of Canon Law and the corresponding canons of the Code of Canons of the Eastern Churches. Archbishop [[Ihor Vozniak]] of Lviv, the archdiocese in which the PSSJ is most active, denounced the ordinations as a "criminal act", and condemned Kovpak's participation in the ceremony. He stressed that the two priests whom Bishop Williamson had ordained would not receive faculties within the archeparchy.&lt;ref&gt;The Holy See has likewise declared SSPX priests to be "suspended from exercising their priestly functions" ([http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm Letter of Monsignor Camille Perl, Secretary of the [[Ecclesia Dei]] Commission] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030202034019/http://www.unavoce.org/articles/2003/perl-011803.htm |date=2003-02-02 }}). A minority of them - ordained before 1976 by archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]] for the SSPX - were and remained until now incardinated in several European dioceses. They are thus in the same position as excommunicated Kovpak, who is incardinated in the Ukrainian Archdiocese of Lviv. The newly ordained clergy, however, are not incardinated into any Ukrainian Catholic diocese, and thus are not clergy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church.&lt;/ref&gt; Officials of the Lviv archdiocese said that Kovpak could face [[excommunication]], and that ''"'he deceives the church by declaring that he is a Greek (Byzantine) Catholic priest,' while supporting a group ''[SSPX]'' that uses the old Latin liturgy exclusively, eschewing the Byzantine tradition, and does not maintain allegiance to the Holy See."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=47961 Catholic World News: Byzantine Catholics decry Lefebvrite inroads into Ukraine] The accusation of "eschewing the Byzantine tradition" refers to Father Kovpak's championing of Latinising elements which were followed by Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church since the 17th century, but forcibly purged following the Second Vatican Council.&lt;/ref&gt;

Father Kovpak's excommunication process was restarted by the hierarchy of the Ukrainian Greek-Catholic Church and was confirmed by the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]] on 23 November 2007.&lt;ref name="Ukrainian priest excommunicated"&gt;[http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=54919 Ukrainian priest excommunicated] Catholic World News, November 21, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

====Sedevacantism in an Eastern church====
On 3 March 2008 a group of [[Order of Saint Basil the Great|Basilian]] priests stationed in [[Pidhirtsi]], Ukraine, informed [[Pope Benedict XVI]] that four of them had been consecrated as bishops in order to save the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church (UGCC) from heresy and apostasy. On 11 August 2009, they announced the formation of the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Greek Catholic Church]] as a "new Church structure for the orthodox faithful of the UGCC", professing the Catholic faith, including the primacy of the Roman Pontiff, and disassociating themselves from "contemporary heresies which destroy both the Eastern and the Western Church".&lt;ref&gt;[http://uogcc.org.ua/en/church/article/?article=783 Decree of Establishment of the UOGCC]. Uogcc.org.ua (2009-08-11). Retrieved on 2013-07-04.&lt;/ref&gt; Having elected their own patriarch, they declared on 1 May 2011 that both [[Pope John Paul II]] and Pope Benedict XVI were excommunicated, leaving the Holy See vacant; they added: "The Byzantine Catholic Patriarchate is now commissioned by God to protect the orthodox doctrine of the Catholic Church, including the Latin Church. Only after an orthodox Catholic hierarchy and an orthodox successor to the Papacy is elected, will the Patriarchate be relieved of this God-given duty."&lt;ref&gt;[http://uogcc.org.ua/en/actual/article/?article=4554 Declaration of an excommunication upon Pope Benedict XVI and John Paul II].

==Relations with the Holy See==
The Holy See recognises as fully legitimate the preference that many Catholics have for the earlier forms of worship. This was apparent in Pope John Paul II's 1988 apostolic letter ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]'' and Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]''. Naturally, however, the Holy See does not extend its approval to those who take a stand against the present-day Church leadership.

===''Ecclesia Dei'' Commission===
The [[Pontifical Commission Ecclesia Dei]] was founded in July 1988 in the wake of Pope John Paul II's apostolic letter ''[[Ecclesia Dei]]''. Pope Benedict XVI was a member of the Commission during his tenure as Cardinal Prefect of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]].
Speaking on 16 May 2007 to the [https://web.archive.org/web/20070512010413/http://en.celam.info/ Fifth General Conference of the Bishops of Latin America and the Caribbean], Cardinal Castrillón, the current head of the Commission, stated that his department had been founded for the care of those "traditionalist Catholics" who, while discontented with the liturgical reform of the [[Second Vatican Council]], had broken with Archbishop [[Marcel Lefebvre]], "because they disagreed with his schismatic action in ordaining Bishops without the required papal mandate". He added that at present the Commission's activity is not limited to the service of those Catholics, nor to "the efforts undertaken to end the regrettable schismatic situation and secure the return of those brethren belonging to the [[Society of St. Pius X|Fraternity of Saint Pius X]] to [[full communion]]." It extends also, he said, to "satisfying the just aspirations of people, unrelated to the two aforementioned groups, who, because of their specific sensitiveness, wish to keep alive the earlier [[Latin Rite|Latin]] liturgy in the celebration of the [[Eucharist]] and the other [[sacrament]]s."&lt;ref&gt;The text of Cardinal Castrillón's speech, in the language in which he gave it, can be consulted at [http://www.celam.info/content/view/277/332/ Intervención sobre Ecclesia Dei-16 de mayo de 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070525080327/http://www.celam.info/content/view/277/332/ |date=2007-05-25 }} (Retrieved 17 May 2007) or at [http://qien.free.fr/2007/200705/20070514_hoyos.htm Intervención sobre Ecclesia Dei – Card. Darío Castrillón Hoyos, Presidente Ecclesia Dei] (Retrieved 7 December 2008). English translations may be consulted at [http://rorate-caeli.blogspot.com/2007/05/aparecida-notes-urgent-news-castrilln.html Rorate Caeli] (Retrieved 7 December 2008), and extracts are given in English at [http://www.adoremus.org/0607NewsViews.html Adoremus Bulletin](Retrieved 7 December 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same speech Cardinal Castrillón indicated that it was intended to make the Commission an organ of the [[Holy See]] for the purpose of preserving and maintaining the traditional liturgy; at the same time he stated that this was not with the purpose of "going backward, of returning to the times before the 1970 reform.... The Holy Father wishes to preserve the immense spiritual, cultural and aesthetic treasure linked with the old liturgy. Recovery of these riches goes together with the no less precious riches of the Church's present liturgy."

===''Summorum Pontificum''===
Following months of rumour and speculation, Pope Benedict XVI issued the [[motu proprio]] ''[[Summorum Pontificum]]'' in July 2007. The Pope ruled that priests of the [[Latin Rite]] can freely choose between the 1962 Roman Missal and the [[Mass of Paul VI|later edition]] "in Masses celebrated without the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html |title=''Summorum Pontificum'', art. 2 |publisher=Sanctamissa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such celebrations may be attended by those who spontaneously ask to be allowed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html |title=''Summorum Pontificum'', art. 4 |publisher=Sanctamissa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Priests in charge of churches can permit stable groups of laypeople attached to the earlier form to have Mass celebrated for them in that form, provided that the celebrating priest is "qualified to [celebrate] and not juridically impeded"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctamissa.org/en/resources/summorum-pontificum.html |title=''Summorum Pontificum'', art. 5 |publisher=Sanctamissa.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; (this would exclude traditionalist priests not in good standing with Rome).

The document, as well as being welcomed by the traditionalist groups that have been in good relations with Rome, has been considered by groups such as the [[Sons of the Most Holy Redeemer]], which have been in dispute with Rome, to be sufficient grounds for seeking an agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://papastronsay.blogspot.com/2008/04/immaculate-heart-of-marypray-for-us.html |title=Declaration on Relations with Rome |publisher=Papastronsay.blogspot.com |date=2008-04-28 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society of Saint Pius X welcomed the document, but referred to "difficulties that still remain", including "disputed doctrinal issues" and the notice of excommunication that still affected its bishops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fsspx.org/eng/index.html |title=Press Release from the General Superior of the Priestly Society of Saint Pius X, 7 July 2007 |publisher=Fsspx.org |date=2011-06-17 |accessdate=2011-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090219085433/http://fsspx.org/eng/index.html |archivedate=19 February 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sedevacantists of course consider all documents issued by Benedict XVI to be devoid of canonical force.

==Validity of holy orders of traditionalist clergy==

The conferring of [[holy orders]] may be [[valid but illicit]].&lt;ref&gt;See especially Canons [http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P3N.HTM 1012–1023]&lt;/ref&gt; The Catholic Church obviously considers the orders of traditionalist clergy who are in good standing with the Holy See, such as the clergy of the Priestly Fraternity of Saint Peter, to be both valid and licit. It sees as valid but illicit the orders of the bishops and priests of the Society of Saint Pius X, and accordingly considers them to be forbidden by law to exercise priestly offices, but still technically priests.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/benedict_xvi/letters/2009/documents/hf_ben-xvi_let_20090310_remissione-scomunica_en.html Letter of His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI to the Bishops of the Catholic Church concerning the remission of the excommunication of the four Bishops consecrated by Archbishop Lefebvre] by [[Pope Benedict XVI]] concerning his remission of the excommunication of the four bishops of the Society of St Pius X&lt;/ref&gt; As for the "independent" traditionalists, whether [[episcopi vagantes|bishops]] or priests, it certainly sees their ordination as illicit, but its judgement on the validity is less clear. The Holy See declared devoid of canonical effect the consecration ceremony conducted by Archbishop [[Pierre Martin Ngô Đình Thục]] for the [[Palmarian Catholic Church|Carmelite Order of the Holy Face]] group at midnight of 31 December 1975, while expressly refraining from pronouncing on its validity. It made the same statement with regard also to any later ordinations that those bishops might confer, saying that, "as for those who have already thus unlawfully received ordination or any who may yet accept ordination from these, whatever may be the validity of the orders (''quidquid sit de ordinum validitate''), the Church does not and will not recognise their ordination (''ipsorum ordinationem''), and will consider them, for all legal effects, as still in the state in which they were before, except that the ... penalties remain until they repent."&lt;ref&gt;Sacred [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]], Decree ''Episcopi qui alios'' of 17 September 1976 – ''Acta Apostolicae Sedis'' 1976, page 623).&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionalists themselves are divided on the question of the validity of the orders conferred using the [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/paul_vi/apost_constitutions/documents/hf_p-vi_apc_19680618_pontificalis-romani_lt.html rite promulgated by Pope Paul VI in 1968.] Those who deny or put in doubt the validity of the sacramental liturgies as revised after the Second Vatican Council pass the same negative judgement on all such ordinations.&lt;ref&gt;See for instance [http://www.rore-sanctifica.org/etudes/2006/RORE-2006-02-17-EN-Coomaraswany_Apostolic_Succession_intact_2001.pdf ''Is the Apostolic Succession Intact?'' by Rama P.

According to the Vatican's ''[[Ecclesiastical Statistics|Statistical Yearbook of the Church]]'', the Catholic Church's worldwide recorded membership at the end of 2005 was 1,114,966,000.&lt;ref name=StatYearbookfor2005&gt;{{cite book |title=Statistical Yearbook of the Church 2005 |author=Central Statistics Office |publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana |year=2007 |isbn=978-88-209-7928-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estimates of the number of traditionalist Catholics vary. Catholic World News reported that "the Vatican" estimated the number of those served by the Fraternity of St Peter, the Society of St Pius X and similar groups at "close to 1 million".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cwnews.com/news/viewstory.cfm?recnum=37861 |title=Catholic World News : "All We Ask is for the Mass" |publisher=Cwnews.com |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various sources estimate the adherents of the Society of St Pius X alone at 1 million.&lt;ref name=Geocities&gt;{{cite web|url=http://geocities.com/catholic_traditionalist/ |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091026233659/http://geocities.com/catholic_traditionalist/ |archivedate=2009-10-26 |title=Roman Catholic Traditionalism? |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-10-26 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.remnantnewspaper.com/Archives/archive-2006-1115-universal%20indult.htm |title=The Universal Indult vs |publisher=Remnantnewspaper.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsmax.com/archives/articles/2006/10/11/112628.shtml |title=Vatican Decree May Bring Back Latin Mass |publisher=Newsmax.com |date=2006-10-11 |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.renewamerica.us/columns/mershon/061019 |title=SSPX to send spiritual bouquet and encouragement to Pope |publisher=Renewamerica.us |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; No major religious survey has ever made an attempt to sample and enumerate subsets of Catholics by their position on a liberal to mainstream conservative to traditionalist and sedevacantist continuum, so any figure on the numbers of traditionalist Catholics must by necessity be more or less educated guesses.

The two most prominent societies of traditionalist priests – the SSPX and the FSSP – claim to have a presence in 31 and 14 countries respectively. A large share of their members in each case are stationed in [[France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://laportelatine.org/quisommesnous/statistiques/stat.php |title=Quelques statistiques au sujet de la Fraternité Sacerdotale Saint-Pie X |publisher=Fraternité Sacerdotale Saint-Pie X – Site officiel du District de France |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20180908012314/http://laportelatine.org/quisommesnous/statistiques/stat.php |archive-date=2018-09-08 |access-date=2018-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two other societies, the SSPV and CMRI, are based in the [[United States]] and also claim a presence in many countries, especially the CMRI. Traditionalist Catholics in [[English-speaking countries]] and [[Germany]] are more likely to be [[sedevacantist]] than those in France and other Latin countries.

According to one writer, one percent of people who claim to be Catholic identify as "traditional Catholics"; the same writer says that "the Vatican and the SSPX seem to agree that there are about 0.01% of Catholics world-wide are members or traditional Catholics"; on the basis of "an educated guess", he calculates that 80% of "Traditional Catholics" are practicing, dynamic Catholics, and on the basis of research that only 7% of Catholics are "dynamic Catholics" concludes that "groups of traditional Catholics" represent approximately 11% of ''practicing'' Catholics.&lt;ref name="Percentage"/&gt; For purposes of comparison with mainstream Catholic organisations, the [[Knights of Columbus]] in the United States are stated to have 1.7 million members, the [[Neocatechumenal Way]] is reported to have around 1 million members,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zenit.org/english/visualizza.phtml?sid=108409|title=Kiko Argüello Meets With Benedict XVI|work=ZENIT - The World Seen From Rome|accessdate=15 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Opus Dei]] is claimed to have 87,000 members.

Another comparison is that [[Eastern Rite Catholic]]s number 16 million. Approximately 7,650,000 belong to the [[Eastern Catholic Churches#List of Eastern Catholic Churches|fourteen]] Catholic Churches of [[Byzantine Rite]], whether they attend the [[Divine Liturgy]] in that liturgical rite or in another,&lt;ref&gt;"The practice, however long standing, of receiving the sacraments according to the rite of an autonomous ritual Church, does not bring with it membership of that Church" ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_PB.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 112 §2]).&lt;/ref&gt; and 8,300,000 belong to other Eastern Catholic Churches of [[Armenian Catholic Church|Armenian]], [[Coptic Catholic Church|Coptic]] and [[Syriac Catholic Church|Syriac]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/CU/ac0106.asp |title=What All Catholics Should Know About Eastern Catholic Churches |publisher=Americancatholic.org |date= |accessdate=2011-06-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209163346/http://www.americancatholic.org/Newsletters/CU/ac0106.asp |archivedate=2014-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''United States of Banana''''' is a 2011 work of [[fiction]] by the [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] poet [[Giannina Braschi]]. It is a mixed-genre work which blends [[experimental theater]], [[prose poetry]], [[short story]], and [[essay]] with a [[manifesto]] on [[democracy]] and American power in a post–[[September 11 attacks|September 11]] world. The book narrates the author's violent displacement from her home in the [[Battery Park]] neighborhood in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name="Torrens"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Torrens|first=Claudia|title=Novela de Braschi fantasea con un mundo ideal para hispanos.

==Summary==

===Part One: Ground Zero=== 

Part One, titled as  "Ground Zero", offers a poetic critique of 21st century capitalism and [[corporate censorship]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Larry|last=Roth|title=Rushdie Brings PEN Festival to Close|newspaper=The New York Times|location=New York|date=May 7, 2012|url= http://artsbeat.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/05/07/rushdie-brings-pen-festival-to-close/|quote='A critique of 21st century capitalism in which [Braschi] condemned corporate censorship and control.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its depictions of New York City before and during the September 11 attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Braschi|first=Giannina|title=United States of Banana|url=https://www.amazon.com/United-States-Banana-Giannina-Braschi/dp/1611090679/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1366476783&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=united+states+of+banana|year=2011|publisher=AmazonCrossing|location=Seattle|ISBN=1611090679|page=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; Part One unfolds through a collection of [[metafiction]], [[short stories]], and [[essays]] on American culture since the collapse of the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pérez-Duthie|first=Juan Carlos|title=Autora busca la libertad en la palabra: "United States of Banana", lo nuevo y controversial de la boricua Giannina Braschi (Author Searches for Liberty in the Word, The New and Controversial "United States of Banana" by Boricua Giannina Braschi)|newspaper=Sun Sentinel|location=Miami|date=November 24, 2011|url= http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2011-11-24/elsentinel/fl-es-com1126braschi-20111124_1_torres-gemelas-secciones-la-destrucci-n}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part Two: United States of Banana===
In Part Two, called "United States of Banana", the structure radically changes from a collection of fragmented works into an [[experimental theater]] work consisting of dramatic and philosophical dialogues. Historical literary characters [[Hamlet (character)|Hamlet]] and [[Zarathustra]] (Zoroaster) join the author's [[alter-ego]], Giannina, on a quest to liberate the Puerto Rican prisoner [[Segismundo]] from the dungeon of the [[Statue of Liberty]] where he has been held by his father, the King of the United States of Banana, more than 100 years prior for the crime of having been born.&lt;ref&gt;[[Library Journal]]'s Review of United States of Banana, October 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; When the king remarries, he frees his son, and for the sake of reconciliation, makes Puerto Rico the fifty-first state and grants [[American passport]]s to all Latin American citizens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repeatingislands.com/2011/12/12/new-book-giannina-braschis-united-states-of-banana/|title=New Book: Giannina Braschi's United States of Banana|last=Romero|first=Ivette|date=December 12, 2011|publisher=Repeating Islands: News and Commentary on Caribbean Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The experimental play dramatizes the plight of Latino prisoners in the United States, Puerto Rico's position as an American territory, and Braschi's struggle for liberty.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Delgado|first=José A.|newspaper=El Nuevo Día|title=La libertad no es una opción, es un derecho [Liberty is Not an Option, It is a Right]|date=September 24, 2012|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/lalibertadnoesunaopcionesunderecho-1349719.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By having the people of Puerto Rico vote on Segismundo's liberty, the work satirizes the three political options of Puerto Rico: [[Federated state|statehood]], [[nation]], and [[colony]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hernandez|first=Carmen Dolores|newspaper=El Nuevo Día|title=El reino del absurdo [The Reign of the Absurd]|date=February 2012|location=San Juan, Puerto Rico|url=http://www.elnuevodia.com/lalibertadnoesunaopcionesunderecho-1349719.html|quote='Puerto Rico's destiny should be decided between "wishy", "wishy-washy" or "washy{{"'}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film and theater productions==

*In 2011, American photographer [[Michael Somoroff]] directed and produced a series of short art films of the author's [[oral interpretation]] of the book; these films debuted at Cervantes Institute in New York on December 1, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|  url=http://www.nyslittree.org/index.cfm/fuseaction/calendar.viewDetail/EventPK/5559D91B-19B9-EB12-B0CE039FDD266AD5/categoryId/1.cfm|

*In 2011 and 2012, Braschi gave a series of dramatic readings from ''United States of Banana'' at major festivals, cultural centers, and literary conventions.
*In 2015, Colombian film and theater director Juan Pablo Felix adapted ''United States of Banana'' for the stage and debuted the production at Schapiro Theater at [[Columbia University]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States of Banana, a play based on the book by Giannina Braschi|quote="Colombian film and theater director Juan Pablo Felix brings to the stage for the first time 'United States of Banana,' by poet Giannina Braschi on the post-911 American psyche around the politics of empire and independence."|url=http://www.pw.org/literary_events/united_states_of_banana_a_play_based_on_the_book_by_giannina_braschi_3|website =Poets and Writers Magazine|date =May 2015}}{{dead link|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Columbia Theater Director Debuts United States of Banana|quote="The work depicts New York City as "the Darwinist capital of the Capitalist word" and U.S. imperialism as doomed as "a chicken with its head cut off"."|url=http://latinola.com/story.php?story=13421|website =LatinoLa Magazine|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Federico zuccari, porta virtutis, 1585 circa (urbino, gn delle marche) 07 invidia.jpg|thumb|Allegorical representation of the Vice of [[Envy]], by [[Federico Zuccari]]]]
'''Vice''' is a practice, behaviour, or [[Habit (psychology)|habit]] generally considered [[Morality|immoral]], [[sin]]ful, [[crime|criminal]], [[rude]], [[taboo]], depraved, or degrading in the associated society. In more minor usage, vice can refer to a fault, a negative character trait, a defect, an infirmity, or a bad or unhealthy habit (such as an [[addiction to smoking]]). Vices are usually associated with a transgression in a person's character or temperament rather than their morality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/t/text/text-idx?c=did;cc=did;rgn=main;view=text;idno=did2222.0000.010,|title='Jaucourt, Louis, chevalier de.

Paris, 1765.'|author=|date=|website=umich.edu}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=SheriffIsInTown |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Synonyms for vice include fault, sin, depravity, iniquity, wickedness, and corruption.

The opposite of vice is [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thesaurus.com/browse/vice|title=Vice|publisher=Thesaurus.com|accessdate=2012-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120524010228/http://thesaurus.com/browse/vice|archivedate=2012-05-24|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The modern English term that best captures its original meaning is the word ''vicious'', which means "full of vice". In this sense, the word ''vice'' comes from the [[Latin]] word ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#vitium|vitium]]'', meaning "failing or defect".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=vice+&amp;searchmode=none|title=Vice|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=2012-06-30|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129114109/http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=vice+&amp;searchmode=none|archivedate=2014-11-29|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(This meaning is completely separate from the word ''vice'' when used as an official title to indicate a [[wikt:deputy|deputy]], substitute or subordinate, as in [[vice president]], vice-chancellor or [[viceroy]]. The etymology of this usage derives from the Latin prefix ''vice-'', meaning "in the place of".)

== Law enforcement ==
Depending on the country or jurisdiction, vice crimes may or may not be treated as a separate category in the criminal codes. Even in jurisdictions where vice is not explicitly delineated in the legal code, the term ''vice'' is often used in law enforcement and judicial systems as an umbrella for crimes involving activities that are considered inherently immoral, regardless of the legality or objective harm involved.

In the United Kingdom, the term ''vice'' is commonly used in law and law enforcement to refer to criminal offences related to [[prostitution]] and pornography.&lt;ref name="police"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.met.police.uk/co/clubs_and_vice/index.htm|title=Metropolitan Police Service - Please Wait...|publisher=met.police.uk|accessdate=2014-09-13|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511230918/http://www.met.police.uk/co/clubs_and_vice/index.htm|archivedate=2013-05-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, the term is also used to refer to [[drug prohibition law|crimes related to drugs]], alcohol, and gambling.&lt;ref name="Hess 2008 p. 209"&gt;Hess (2008), p. 209.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{redirect|Vice squad}}
A vice squad, also called a vice unit or a morality squad, is (though not always) a police division, whose focus is to restrain or suppress moral crimes. Though what is considered or accepted as a ''moral'' crime by society often varies considerably according to local laws or customs between nations, countries, or states, it often includes activities such as [[gambling]], [[narcotics]], [[pornography]], and [[alcohol law|illegal sales of alcoholic beverages]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vice+squad|title=Vice squad|publisher=The Free Dictionary By Farlex|accessdate=2012-05-31|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050921013607/http://www.thefreedictionary.com/vice%20squad|archivedate=2005-09-21|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice squads do not concentrate on crimes like [[fraud]] and murder.

== Religion ==
[[Religious police]], for example [[islamic religious police]] units or [[sharia]] police in certain parts of the [[Arab world|Arab-speaking world]], are morality squads that also monitors for example [[Islam and clothing|dress codes]], observance of store-closures during prayer time, [[Islamic dietary laws|consumption of unlawful beverages or foods]], [[zina|unrelated males and females socializing]], and homosexual behavior.

=== Buddhism ===
{{see also|Buddhist views on sin}}
In the [[Sarvastivadin]] tradition of [[Buddhism]], there are 108 defilements, or vices, which are prohibited. These are subdivided into 10 bonds and 98 proclivities.&lt;ref name="Hirasawa 1998 p. 202"&gt;Hirakawa (1998), p. 202.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10 bonds are the following:&lt;ref name="Hirasawa 1998 p. 202" /&gt;
* Absence of [[shame]]
* Absence of [[embarrassment]]
* Jealousy
* [[:wikt:parsimony|Parsimony]] (in the sense of stinginess)
* Remorse
* Drowsiness
* Distraction
* [[Sloth (deadly sin)|Torpor]]
* Anger
* Concealment of wrongdoing

=== Christianity ===
{{main|Christian ethics}}
[[File:Stiftskirche Niederhaslach Glasfenster (Kampf der Tugenden mit dem Laster).jpg|thumb|upright|[[Virtue]]s fighting vices, stained glass window (14th century) in the [[Niederhaslach Church]]]]

Christians believe there are two kinds of vice:{{Citation needed|reason=Can it be stated that these distinctions truly apply broadly across the entire Christian world?|date=April 2010}}
* Vices that come from the physical organism as instincts, which can become perverse (such as lust)
* Vices that come from false idolatry in the spiritual realm

The first kind of vice, though sinful, is believed less serious than the second. Vices recognized as spiritual by Christians include [[blasphemy]] ([[Sacred|holiness]] betrayed), [[apostasy]] ([[faith]] betrayed), despair ([[hope]] betrayed), [[hatred]] ([[Love (religious views)|love]] betrayed), and indifference (scripturally, a "hardened heart"). Christian theologians have reasoned that the most destructive vice equates to a certain type of [[pride]] or the complete idolatry of the self. It is argued that through this vice, which is essentially competitive, all the worst evils come into being. In Christian theology, it originally led to the [[Fall of Man]], and, as a purely diabolical spiritual vice, it outweighs anything else often condemned by the Church.

==== Roman Catholicism ====&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Lust]] --&gt;
The [[Roman Catholic|Roman Catholic Church]] distinguishes between vice, which is a habit of sin, and the sin itself, which is an individual morally wrong act. Note that in Roman Catholicism, the word "sin" also refers to the state that befalls one upon committing a morally wrong act. In this section, the word always means the sinful act. It is the sin, and not the vice, that deprives one of God's [[sanctifying grace]] and renders one deserving of God's [[Hell in Christian beliefs#hell in Rom Cath|punishment]]. [[Thomas Aquinas]] taught that "absolutely speaking, the sin surpasses the vice in wickedness".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm Entry for ''vice''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070405184628/http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/15403c.htm |date=2007-04-05 }} at NewAdvent.org online Catholic Encyclopedia.&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, even after a person's sins have been [[Sacrament of Penance (Catholic Church)|forgiven]], the underlying habit (the vice) may remain. Just as vice was created in the first place by repeatedly yielding to the temptation to sin, so vice may be removed only by repeatedly resisting temptation and performing virtuous acts; the more entrenched the vice, the more time and effort needed to remove it. Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] says that following rehabilitation and the acquisition of virtues, the vice does not persist as a habit, but rather as a mere disposition, and one that is in the process of being eliminated. Medieval illuminated manuscripts circulated with colorful schemas for developing proper attitudes, with scriptural allusions modelled on nature: the [[tree of virtues]] as blossoming flowers or vices bearing sterile fruit, The Renaissance writer [[Pietro Bembo]] is credited with reaffirming and promoting the Christian perfection of classical humanism. Deriving all from love (or the lack thereof) his&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/images/tp1515/1515.wc3.150dpi.jpeg Flow diagram leading to the deeper-seated vices in purgatory] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120505235431/http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/images/tp1515/1515.wc3.150dpi.jpeg |date=2012-05-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; schemas were added as supplements&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/text/1515.venice.html Aldus' second edition printing of Dante's Divine Comedy, Venice 1502.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205212641/http://www.italnet.nd.edu/Dante/text/1515.venice.html |date=2012-02-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in the newly invented technology of printing by [[Aldus Manutius]] in his editions of Dante's Divine Comedy dating from early in the 16th century.

=== Dante's seven deadly vices ===
The poet [[Dante Alighieri]] listed the following [[Seven deadly sins|seven deadly vices]], associating them structurally&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wolfram.demon.co.uk/purgatory4.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-02-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120205191100/http://www.wolfram.demon.co.uk/purgatory4.gif |archivedate=2012-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as flaws in the soul's inherent capacity for goodness as made in the Divine Image yet perverted by the Fall:

#[[Hubris|Pride]] or [[vanity]]: an excessive love of the self (holding the self outside of its proper position regarding God or fellows; Dante's definition was "love of self perverted to hatred and contempt for one's neighbour"). In the Latin lists of the [[Seven Deadly Sins]], pride is referred to as ''superbia''.
#[[Envy]] or [[jealousy]]: resentment of others for their possessions (Dante: "love of one's own good perverted to a desire to deprive other men of theirs"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, envy is referred to as ''invidia''.
#[[Wrath]] or [[anger]]: feelings of hatred, revenge or denial, as well as punitive desires outside of justice (Dante's description was "love of justice perverted to revenge and spite"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, wrath is referred to as ''ira'', which primitive vices tempt astray by increasingly '''perverting''' the proper purpose of charity, directing it inwards, leading to a disorded navel-gazing preoccupation with personal goods in isolation absent proper harmonious relations leading to violent disruption of balance with others.
#[[Sloth (deadly sin)|Sloth]] or [[laziness]]: idleness and wastefulness of time or other allotted resources. Laziness is condemned because it results in others having to work harder; also, useful work will not be done. Sloth is referred to in Latin as ''accidie'' or ''acedia'', which vice tempts a self-aware soul to be too easily satisfied, '''thwarting''' charity's purpose as insufficiently perceptible within the soul itself or abjectly indifferent in relationship with the needs of others and their satisfaction, an escalation in evil, more odious than the passion of hate
#[[Seven deadly sins#Greed|Avarice]] (covetousness, greed): a desire to possess more than one has need or use for (or according to Dante, "excessive love of money and power"). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, avarice is referred to as ''avaritia''.
#[[Gluttony]]:  overindulgence in food, drink or intoxicants, or misplaced desire of food as a pleasure for its sensuality ("excessive love of pleasure" was Dante's rendering). In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, gluttony is referred to as ''gula''.
#[[Lust]]: excessive sexual desire. Dante's criterion was that "lust detracts from true love". In the Latin lists of the Seven Deadly Sins, lust is referred to as ''luxuria'', which vices tempt cultivated souls in their ability to direct charity's proper purpose to good things or actions, by '''indulging excess'''. Thus in Dante's estimation the soul's detachment from sensual appetites become the vices most difficult to tame, urges not as easily curbed by mere good manners since inflamed via appropriate use rather than inappropriate misuse. Hence conventional respect for the ninth and tenth commandments against coveting and social customs that encourage custody of the eyes and ears become prudent adjuncts to training against vice.
The first three terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love perverted, that is, sins which arise from the heart of the sinner being set upon something which is wrong in the eyes of God. Those being purged here must have their love set upon the right path. The fourth terrace of purgatory expiates the sins which can be considered to arise from love defective, that is, love which, although directed towards the correct subjects is too weak to drive the sinner to act as they should. Those being purged here must have their love strengthened so as to drive them correctly. The fifth, sixth, and seventh terraces of purgatory expiate the sins which can be considered to arise from love excessive, that is, love which although directed towards ends which God considers good is directed towards them too much for the sinner to gain bliss from them, and also so that the sinner is distracted from the love of other things of which God approves. Their love must be cooled to a more sensible level.

== Biography ==
Fabella was born in [[Manila]], [[Philippines]]. After graduating from the Assumption Convent in Manilla and receiving a BS from Mt. St. Vincent College in New York, Fabella joined the [[Maryknoll Sisters of St. Dominic|Maryknoll Sisters]] in 1952. She would later receive an MA in [[Religious studies|Religious Studies]] from the [[Maryknoll Seminary]] in 1980, a Certificate in [[Pastoral Studies]] from Union Theological in Chicago in 1988, and a [[Doctor of Ministry|DMin]] in [[Women's studies|Women’s Studies]] from [[San Francisco Theological Seminary]] in 1993. Her doctoral dissertation was entitled "The Development of Women's Theological Consciousness within the Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In the 1970s, Fabella was the program coordinator for the [[Ecumenical Association of Third World Theologians]], later serving as its Asia Coordinator.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.maryknollsisters.org/sisters/sister-virginia-fabella/|title=Sister Virginia Fabella - Maryknoll Sisters|last=|first=|date=|work=Maryknoll Sisters|access-date=20 September 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Joseph2015"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bzneCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT241|title=Theologies of the Non-Person: The Formative Years of EATWOT|last=Joseph|first=M.P.|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=2015|isbn=978-1-137-55054-5|location=New York|page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theology ==
Fabella is perhaps best known for her authored and edited works on Asian feminist theology and postcolonial theology. In terms of [[Christology]], Fabella has voiced that the maleness of Jesus is not a problem for Asian women, because by being male, "Jesus could more repudiate more effectively the male definition of humanity and show the way to a right and just male–female relationship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=We Dare to Dream: Doing Theology as Asian Women|last=Fabella|first=Virginia|publisher=Wipf and Stock Publishers|year=2015|isbn=978-1-4982-1914-3|editor1-last=Fabella|editor1-first=Virginia|location=Eugene, Oregon|pages=4|chapter=Christology from an Asian Woman's Perspective|ref=harv|orig-year=1989|editor2-last=Park|editor2-first=Sun Ai Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legend==

===Origins===
An [[etiological myth]] for the moon's [[moon phases|phases]] was that a great forest or great tree grew there, swiftly growing and losing leaves and blossoms over the course of each month. After the expansion of the [[Sinic world|Chinese cultural area]] south of the [[Yangtze River]] during the [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] and [[Han dynasty|Han]] [[list of dynasties of China|dynasties]], the lunar trees became associated with the fragrant and white-blossoming [[sweet osmanthus|osmanthus]]. This tree flowers during the autumn&lt;ref name=wolfman/&gt; and promoted the connection of the Chinese [[harvest celebration]] with the [[Moon]], a connection still observed during the modern [[Mid-Autumn Festival]]. Confections and [[osmanthus wine|wine]] flavored with its blossoms are also still associated with the holiday.&lt;ref&gt;Qiu Yaohong. ''Origins of Chinese Tea and Wine'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=o75duHSMRp8C&amp;pg=PA121 p. 121]. Asiapac Books (Singapore), 2004. Accessed 7 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu Junru. ''Chinese Food'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=XzAQ2xulj8IC&amp;pg=PA136 p. 136]. Cambridge Univ. Press (Cambridge), 2011. Accessed 7 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the time of the [[Han dynasty|Han]], the ''[[Book of the Master of Huainan]]'' associated the [[wax (moon)|waxing]] of the moon with trees growing from the feet of a [[Chinese immortal]].

In his [[Compendium of Materia Medica|''Compendium of'' Materia Medica]], [[Li Shizhen]] explains that Wu Gang was added to the stories about the holiday from [[novella]]s published during the [[Sui dynasty|Sui]] and [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] [[list of Chinese dynasties|dynasties]].&lt;ref name=maomao&gt;''The Writings of Mao Zedong, 1949–1976'', Vol. II. ''January 1956 – December 1957'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=ftv7ks-Ehq0C&amp;pg=PA540 p. 540]. M.E. Sharpe (London), 1992. Accessed 12 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===First version===
The 9th-century ''[[Miscellaneous Morsels from Youyang]]'' mentions a lunar tree over five hundred [[chi (unit)|feet]] high and says that Wu Gang of [[Xihe (deity)|Xihe]] stood under it. It relates that ''other'' immortals were sent there to chop the tree when they made a mistake.&lt;ref name="ntpu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ntpu.edu.tw/admin/a8/org/a8-6/files/www/moon/102.htm|script-title=zh:中秋傳說之——吳剛伐桂|publisher=National Taipei University|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second version===
Wu witnessed a liaison between his wife and [[Yan Emperor|Yandi]]'s grandson, after the two had already carried on an affair so long it begat three sons. In a rage, Wu murdered his wife's lover but Yandi ordered Wu banished to the Moon, where he would cut down a tree. After each blow, the tree healed itself and Wu was therefore forced to cut at it forever.&lt;ref name="space"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lcsd.gov.hk/CE/Museum/Space/StarShine/Starlore/c_starshine_starlore8.htm|script-title=zh:吳剛砍玉桂樹|publisher=Hong Kong Space Museum|language=Chinese|accessdate=2009-08-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third version===
Another version features a [[cherry bay]].{{dubious|date=November 2013}} In this version, Wu Gang began the attempt to become a Taoist immortal but gave up lazily midway through the process. The [[Jade Emperor]] was furious and decided to punish him. The Emperor created a cherry bay on the Moon and Wu Gang was invited to chop it down in order to become an immortal. Wu Gang tried, but again the tree healed itself and the task was impossible. The shadows on the Moon are said to be created by the growing cherry bay.&lt;ref name="midautumn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itsaboutchina.com/mid-autumn.htm|title=Mid-Autumn Festival Story|accessdate=2009-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fourth version===
In yet another version, Wu found a teacher in the mountains in his quest for immortality. When his teacher taught him to heal, he gave up after three days. When he was taught to play [[Chinese chess]], he gave up after two days. When he was taught the method of eternal life, he gave up after a day. His teacher then sent him to the Moon to chop down the tree.&lt;ref name="school"/&gt;

'''[[Zoroastrianism]] in [[Armenia]]''' dates back as far as to the fifth-century BC, notably during the Achaemenian and Parthian periods in the [[Armenian Highlands]]. Prior to Armenia's Christianisation, it was a predominantly Zoroastrian-adhering land.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce. [https://books.google.nl/books?id=a6gbxVfjtUEC&amp;pg=PA84&amp;dq=armenians+zoroastrianism+christianity&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAWoVChMIi5zf656SxgIVgbMsCh1xBQB1#v=onepage&amp;q=armenians%20zoroastrianism%20christianity&amp;f=false ''Zoroastrians: Their Religious Beliefs and Practices''] Psychology Press, 2001 {{ISBN|0415239028}} p 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] fire-altars had been discovered in Christian sanctuaries in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;''Zoroastrianism in fifth-century Armenia'' - Solomon A. Nigosian, Department of Religious Studies, University of Toronto&lt;/ref&gt; In various parts of Armenia, Zoroastrianism lingered on for several centuries even after the official adoption of Christianity. The [[Arsacid dynasty of Armenia]], under which Armenia eventually would become a Christian nation, were pious Zoroastrians who invoked Mithra as the lord of covenants, as is proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russel|first1=James R.|title=Zoroastrianism in Armenia (Harvard Iranian series)|date=1987|publisher=Harvard University, Department of Near Eastern Languages and Civilizations|isbn=978-0674968509|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=xhJIAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Tiridates+I+of+Armenia+zoroastrian+adherent&amp;dq=Tiridates+I+of+Armenia+zoroastrian+adherent&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjT3Oehzc3JAhULiCwKHW4OCWYQ6AEIHDAA|quote=The Parthian Arsacids who came to the throne of Armenia in the first century A.D. were pious Zoroastrians who invoked Mithra as the lord of covenants, as is proper.

In A.D. 53 the Parthian Arsacid dynasty came into Armenia, the king, Trdat I, is thought to have done a great amount to spread Zoroastrianism in Armenia.&lt;ref&gt;''The Heritage of Armenian Literature'', Volume I - Agop Jack Hacikyan Gabriel Basmajian Edward S. Franchuk Nourhan Ouzounian, page 70&lt;/ref&gt; According to J. Russel, Zurvanism was the form of Zoroastrianism under Yazdagrird II (438-57), which he promoted in [[Persian Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;J. Russell, ''Zoroastrianism in Armenia'', 136-138&lt;/ref&gt;

The Armenian month names show influence of the Zoroastrian calendar.

An Armenian Christian source, according to which an Zurvanite proselytizer, Mihr-Narseh, spoke of the words openly:

A small minority kept their Zoroatrian faith down through the centuries until the early 20th century, these people were known as the Arewordik / Arevordik (Children of the Sun). They survived at [[Merzifon|Marsovan (Merzifon)]], T'lkurun and other places in Anatolia until WW1, reports indicate that they were killed in the [[Armenian Genocide]] of 1915-17 by the Ottoman Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Anne Sofie Roald,Anh Nga Longva.

The '''Ásatrúarfélagið''' ({{IPA-is|ˈauːsatruwar̥ˌfjɛːlajɪθ|lang}}, ''Ásatrú Fellowship'') is an [[Iceland]]ic religious organisation of [[Heathenry (new religious movement)|Heathenry]] (in Iceland also called ''{{lang|is|Ásatrú}}'', "faith of the [[Æsir]]"). It was founded on the [[First Day of Summer]] 1972, and granted recognition as a registered religious organization in 1973, allowing it to conduct legally binding ceremonies and collect a share of the [[church tax#Iceland|church tax]].

The organization was led by farmer and poet [[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]] from 1972 until his death in 1993. During most of this period membership did not exceed 100 people and after the initial enthusiasm faded, there was little activity. The time of the next high priest, [[Jörmundur Ingi Hansen]] (1994–2002), saw considerable growth and activity, including the design of an Ásatrú burial ground. These trends have continued under the present high priest, musician [[Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson]] (2003-), and as of January 1st 2018, the organization has 4126 registered members, about one third of whom are women.&lt;ref&gt;[http://px.hagstofa.is/pxen/pxweb/en/Samfelag/Samfelag__menning__5_trufelog/MAN10001.px]. [[Statistics Iceland]].&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 2002, the number of registered members has grown annually from 8% (2006-2007) to 21% (2011-2012).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ásatrúarfélagið: Félagafjöldi |url=http://asatru.is/felagafjoldi |work= |publisher=Ásatrúarfélagið |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ásatrúarfélagið does not have a fixed religious dogma or theology but the high priests have tended towards a [[pantheism|pantheistic]] worldview. The central ritual is the communal ''[[blót]]'' feast but the priests (''[[goði|goðar]]'') also conduct name-giving ceremonies, coming of age rituals, weddings and funerals. The organization has on some occasions taken a stance on political issues, including abortion rights, gay marriage, the separation of church and state, and environmental issues. The organisation is a founding member of the [[European Congress of Ethnic Religions]].

==History==
[[File:Þingblót 2009.jpg|right|thumb|300px|[[Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson]] and other members of Ásatrúarfélagið walk to a ''[[blót]]'' at [[Þingvellir]] in the summer of 2009.]]

===Origins===

The idea to found a folk religious organization came about in late winter 1972 in discussions in a café in Reykjavík. The four men who would become the organization's early leaders and ideologues were [[Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson]], a farmer and a traditionalist poet, [[Jörmundur Ingi Hansen]], a jack of all trades and a prominent person in the Reykjavík [[hippie]] movement, Dagur Þorleifsson, a journalist and active member of the Reykjavík [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophy]] lodge, and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson, leader of [[Félag Nýalssinna]], an organization devoted to the theories of [[Helgi Pjeturss]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pétur Pétursson (1985:21-22).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigurður A. Magnússon (1990:198)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson described the founding of Ásatrúarfélagið as based on a belief in hidden forces in the land and connected to "the desire that Icelanders could have their own faith, and nourish it no less than imported religions".&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "Hugmyndin að Ásatrúarfélaginu byggðist á trú á dulin öfl í landinu, í tengslum við mannfólkið sem skynjaði ekki þessa hluti til fulls nema einstöku menn. Það tengdist síðan þjóðlegum metnaði og löngun til að Íslendingar ættu sína trú, og ræktu hana ekki síður en innflutt trúarbrögð." Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1992:140).&lt;/ref&gt; Dagur Þorleifsson emphasized that the religion constituted a movement back to nature, seeking refuge from the ills of industrial civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Sigurður A. Magnússon (1990:198-9).&lt;/ref&gt; One observer traces the origins of the organization to the countercultural and religious waves of the time, as well as to nationalism and the widespread Icelandic interest in spiritism, theosophy and [[huldufólk|elves]].&lt;ref&gt;Pétur Pétursson (1985:3-4).&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ásatrú organization was formed on the [[First Day of Summer]] 1972 in a meeting at [[Hótel Borg]]. In a meeting shortly thereafter Sveinbjörn was chosen as chairman and dubbed ''[[allsherjargoði]]''.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

===Recognition===

Shortly before Christmas 1972, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson and Þorsteinn Guðjónsson visited [[Ólafur Jóhannesson]], [[Ministry of Justice and Ecclesiastical Affairs (Iceland)|minister of justice and ecclesiastical affairs]], and expressed interest in registering Ásatrúarfélagið as an official religious organization. The minister at first believed that the request was a joke but when Sveinbjörn and Þorsteinn told him that they were serious he requested additional paperwork. According to Sveinbjörn, shortly after he and Þorsteinn exited the ministry, the lights in the center of town went out due to a thunderstorm, leaving the minister sitting in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1992:133).&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper [[Vísir]] wrote about this in a jocular tone, noting that "the representatives of the Ásatrúarmenn got rather vague answers from the minister, — and apparently that's what [[Thor]] the thunder god thought as well, because as the visit was at an end and the minister stood up to follow the guests to the door there was a terrible thunder in the center of Reykjavík, causing damage close to the office of the ministry".&lt;ref&gt;"Heldur fengu fulltrúar Ásatrúarmanna loðin svör hjá ráðherra, — og það hefur þrumuguðnum Þór víst líka fundizt, því þegar erindinu var lokið, ráðherra búinn að standa upp úr sæti sínu og fylgja gestunum til dyra, — datt ein hin ferlegasta þruma niður í miðborg Reykjavíkur og olli skemmdum ekki alllangt frá ráðuneytisskrifstofunni." JBP. ''Vísir'', January 2, 1973. Page 3. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3246644&amp;issId=238186&amp;lang=en"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sigurbjörn Einarsson]], [[Bishop of Iceland]], recommended to the ministry that the organization not be granted recognition. In a written opinion, later published, the bishop pointed out that the [[Icelandic constitution]] granted everyone a right to "found organizations to serve god"&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "stofna félög til að þjóna guði".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sigurbjörn" /&gt; and that this assumed a monotheistic outlook. Sigurbjörn cited the opinion of legal scholar [[Einar Arnórsson]], published in 1912, that "polytheistic religious organizations founded [in Iceland] would therefore not be protected by the constitution".&lt;ref name="Sigurbjörn"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "Fleirgyðistrúfélög stofnuð hér á landi, mundu því ekki njóta verndar samkvæmt stjskr."&lt;/ref&gt; Sigurbjörn further criticized the application for not including the declaration of an individual stating that he would assume the leadership of the organization. He criticized the organization for having vague teachings and for not including clear documents on them. He also pointed out that the organization had no dedicated house of worship.&lt;ref name="Sigurbjörn"/&gt;

In Sigurbjörn's opinion the most significant effort to revive Germanic folk religion happened in [[Nazi Germany]] and was connected to the racial ideology of that regime. He pointed out that the present applicants had hitherto considered themselves followers of the ''Nýall'' theories of [[Helgi Pjeturss]] and that these theories contained the same racial elements as the Nazi ideology.&lt;ref name="Sigurbjörn"/&gt;{{#tag:ref|In his youth, the bishop was himself a ''Nýall'' follower and, in his own words "wholeheartedly pagan".&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "heiðinn af lífi og sál". Sigurbjörn Einarsson. "Mér er kunnugt um mann...". ''Játningar''. Hlaðbúð, 1948. Page 147.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}{{#tag:ref|A number of Ásatrúarfélagið's founders participated in ''Nýall'' activities,&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Robert. ''The Ghosts of Iceland''.

Conversely, not all ''Nýall'' followers joined Ásatrúarfélagið.&lt;ref&gt;Haukur Matthíasson. "Ásatrúarmenn[,] biskup og dr. Helgi Péturss". ''Morgunblaðið'', December 19, 1973, page 10. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=115763&amp;pageId=1449356&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson says in his autobiography, "My brother Pétur read about the theories of Helgi Pjeturss and was fascinated by them. Then I started studying them as well and I found them remarkable. What appealed to me especially was his theory about life on other stars or planets which replaced the old idea of Heaven; everything was more understandable and more material in what he said. Helgi also had remarkable theories about dreams, he thought they occurred because of influence from other people, even from other stars. This influenced me."&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "Pétur bróðir las sér til um kenningar Helga Pjeturss og hreifst mjög af þeim. Þá fór ég að kynna mér þær líka og fannst þær merkilegar. Einkum höfðaði til mín kenning hans um lífið á öðrum stjörnum eða hnöttum sem kom í staðinn fyrir gömlu hugmyndina um himnaríki; það varð allt skiljanlegra og efnislegra hjá honum. Helgi var líka með merkilegar kenningar um drauma, hann taldi að þeir yrðu fyrir áhrif frá öðrum mönnum, jafnvel öðrum stjörnum. Þetta hafði áhrif á mig." Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1992:38).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Þorsteinn Guðjónsson was a devoted ''Nýall'' participant both before and after the founding of Ásatrúarfélagið. In the late 80s he published an English-language journal, ''Huginn&amp;Muninn'', dedicated to ''Nýall'' theories, paganism and racial ideology.&lt;ref&gt;von Schnurbein (1991:186).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;Jörmundur Ingi Hansen participated in some ''Nýall'' séances. In a 2008 interview he said he "did not feel he got any real information from the proceedings" and that he was "not at all convinced that the information that comes forward at meetings like this is actually from deceased individuals".&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "mér fannst ekki að ég fengi neinar raunverulegar upplýsingar út úr því sem þar átti sér stað. Ég er alls ekki sannfærður um að þær upplýsingar sem koma fram á svona fundum séu í raun frá látnum einstaklingum." Trú og lífsýn goðans", ''Morgunblaðið'', August 24, 2008, page 29.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}} The bishop expressed concern over the possible moral teachings of an Ásatrú organization, in particular as regarded individualism, polygamy and security of person. Finally he pointed out that the group applying for recognition was small, consisting of 21 individuals.&lt;ref name="Sigurbjörn"/&gt; ''[[Morgunblaðið]]'', Iceland's biggest daily newspaper, declared its agreement with the bishop in an editorial. The paper stated that the Christian faith was the "basis of Icelandic society" and that "Christ is enough, though he was not enough for Hitler, Stalin or their followers".&lt;ref&gt;"Kristin trú". ''Morgunblaðið'', December 22, 1973, page 18. Available online at http://new.timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1449516&amp;issId=115767&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Asatruers' reply to the bishop's criticism they argued that even Christianity had some polytheistic elements and that Ásatrú could include a belief in a [[Supreme Being]]. They denied any association with national socialism and argued that it was doubtful that the Third Reich had any genuine Asatruers while it was certain that a number of Christian sects had cooperated with the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;Pétur Pétursson (1985:11).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ásatrúarfélagið was officially recognized as a religious organization by the Icelandic government in May, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1992:133-34, 141).&lt;/ref&gt; This gives it the legal right to perform marriages and other ceremonies and also entitles it to a share of the [[church tax]] in proportion to its number of adult members.

In the [[Althing]], [[Halldór Blöndal]] and [[Magnús Jónsson (politician, 1919–1984)|Magnús Jónsson]], members of the [[Independence Party (Iceland)|Independence Party]], requested an explanation for why Ólafur Jóhannesson had given legal recognition to Ásatrúarfélagið. The minister defended his decision on the grounds that the constitution granted [[freedom of association]] and [[freedom of religion]]. Magnús Jónsson argued that the constitution applied freedom of religion only to monotheistic religions and that the recognition of an organization practicing polytheism and idol worship was thus an illegal act. The minister countered that legal scholars had debated whether the clause applied to polytheism.&lt;ref&gt;"Fyrirspurnartími". ''Morgunblaðið'', November 27, 1973. Page 14. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=1448476&amp;issId=115737&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|Years earlier, Ólafur Jóhannesson had himself argued that the clause applied to polytheism.&lt;ref&gt;Ólafur Jóhannesson. ''Stjórnskipun Íslands''. Hlaðbúð, 1960. Page 429.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="note"}}

In 1975, the Althing changed the law in a way that made it more difficult for new religious organizations to gain recognition.&lt;ref&gt;Pétur Pétursson (1985:28).&lt;/ref&gt;

===First ''allsherjargoði'' (1972-1993)===
[[File:Membership in Ásatrúarfélagið.svg|right|thumb|300px|Number of members in Ásatrúarfélagið as a function of time]]
On August 5, 1973, Ásatrúarfélagið held the first public outdoor ''[[blót]]'' (plural same as singular) in Iceland since public ''blót'' were forbidden by law in the year 1000. The event was held at Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson's farm at Dragháls in pelting rain below a plaster statue of the god [[Thor]] made by Jörmundur Ingi Hansen. The blót was described by the newspaper ''[[Vísir]]'' as "vigorous and energetic"&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "fór fram með tilþrifum og atorku", "Reiddust goðin?" ''Vísir'', August 7, 1973. Page 1. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3249986&amp;issId=238363&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Sigurður A. Magnússon]] commented that the historic significance of the event had not been matched by the quality of the ceremony, "It could hardly have been simpler or more pedestrian".&lt;ref&gt;Sigurður A. Magnússon (1990:194).&lt;/ref&gt;

Ásatrúarfélagið had received extensive media coverage even in its very early formative stages and by the time of the
first public ''blót'' that attention extended to foreign media and had become [[media circus|disproportionate to the scale of the event]] with about as many journalists as participants attending.&lt;ref&gt;ÞS. "Blótuðu Þór í úrhellisrigningu." ''Vísir'', August 7, 1973, page 2. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3249987&amp;issId=238363&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pétur Pétursson (1985:passim).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigurður A. Magnússon (1990:193).&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, the organization had ambitious plans for building a temple, getting a burial ground, and dividing the land into ''[[goðorð]]'', led by individual goðar.&lt;ref name="Pétur Pétursson 1985:18" /&gt; However, membership in the organization did not increase as quickly as these goals would have necessitated. In 1973 Ásatrúarfélagið had 58 registered members, in 1974 it had 70 and in 1976 it had 77. As its leaders realized that the organization's more ambitious goals could not be quickly achieved, the society settled down to a low level of activity.&lt;ref name="Pétur Pétursson 1985:18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sigurður A. Magnússon (1990:208).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 a ''blót'' had not been held for three years, but one was arranged to provide the makers of a documentary with
material.&lt;ref&gt;Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1992:138).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Blótað á Draghálsi". ''DV'', June 20, 1983, page 3. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=189406&amp;pageId=2477329&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-80s, membership in the organization started to rise every year. In 1985 there were 74 members and by 1992 membership had risen to 119. At that point the organization decided that the time had come for increased activity.&lt;ref&gt;Þorri Jóhannsson. "Leiðirnar að guðdómnum eru margar". ''Lesbók Morgunblaðsins'', November 14, 1992, pages 4-5. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3309806&amp;issId=242568&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; The same year, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson published his autobiography.&lt;ref&gt;Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson acted as ''allsherjargoði'' from 1972 until his death in December 1993. He lived a simple life on a farm without modern luxuries. A popular grandfatherly figure, he was "a little eccentric and shy in his role as a media spokesman".&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska (2005:166).&lt;/ref&gt; He left a lasting impression in people's minds.

===Second ''allsherjargoði'' (1994-2002)===
[[File:Jörmundur Ingi 1994.jpg|right|thumb|Jörmundur Ingi is sworn in as ''allsherjargoði'' in July 1994.]]
In late 1993, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson died and in 1994, elections were held for a new ''allsherjargoði''. The candidates were Jörmundur Ingi Hansen and [[Haukur Halldórsson]]. Jörmundur Ingi ran on a platform of continuity while Haukur promised more innovation.&lt;ref&gt;"Stungið út úr hlöðunni". ''Eintak'', May 5, 1994, page 14. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3635950&amp;issId=259425&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; Jörmundur Ingi won with 59 votes against 34.&lt;ref&gt;"Hyggst gera ásatrúna sýnilegri almenningi". ''DV'', May 24, 1994, page 6. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=2626657&amp;issId=195406&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

While Jörmundur was, like Sveinbjörn, an older man knowledgeable in ancient literature, he differed from his predecessor in his greater skill at dealing with the media.&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska (2005:167).&lt;/ref&gt; Jörmundur's time as allsherjargoði saw a rapid rise in membership in the organization, going from 172 in 1994 to 628 in 2002. Jörmundur's time also saw an increase in the percentage of women members, going from 13% in 1994 to 21% in 2002.

In 1999, the organization achieved one of its oldest goals of having a burial ground of its own. The burial ground was designed by Jörmundur Ingi and the first burial took place the same year.

In the summer of 2000, on the occasion of the 1000 year commemoration of the [[Christianisation of Iceland]], the Icelandic state and the Church of Iceland organized a celebration at [[Þingvellir]]. Ásatrúarfélagið had its own annual ''blót'' at Þingvellir at the same time, leading to conflict over the use of facilities with some underlying ideological tensions.&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska (2005:172).&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, more than 1000 people participated in Ásatrúarfélagið's summer event, more than in any previous ceremony by the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska (2005:173).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Ásatrúarfélagið passed the [[Buddhism in Iceland|Buddhist Association of Iceland]] and the [[Icelandic Bahá'i Community]] to become Iceland's largest non-Christian religious organization.

The growth of the organization brought with it increased complexity and internal disputes.&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska (2005:168).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third and fourth ''allsherjargoðar'' (2002-)===
[[File:Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson.jpg|right|thumb|Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson, fourth ''allsherjargoði'', at a ceremony in June 2009]]
In 2002, the board of directors sacked Jörmundur and installed [[Jónína Kristín Berg]] (born 1962) as temporary allsherjargoði.&lt;ref&gt;Jónas Þ. Sigurðsson. "Yfirlýsing frá Lögréttu". ''Morgunblaðið'', August 25, 2002, page 16. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3451577&amp;issId=250831&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, musician [[Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson]] (born 1958), was chosen as allsherjargoði. As of 2018, he remains in office. The demographic trends of previous years have continued. The number of members went from 628 in 2002 to 4126  in 2018 (from 0.20% to 1.18% of the population of Iceland) while the percentage of women has gone from 21% in 2002 to 33% in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://px.hagstofa.is/pxen/pxweb/en/Samfelag/Samfelag__menning__5_trufelog/MAN10001.px].

In 2006, the Ministry of Justice increased the number of Ásatrú priests allowed to conduct legally binding ceremonies (icelandic:vígsluréttindi) from two (the ''allsherjargoði'' and his substitute) to five.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Increase in pagan priests in Iceland |url=https://secure.icelandreview.com/icelandreview/daily_news/?cat_id=28304&amp;ew_0_a_id=236262 |date=October 10, 2006 |work= |publisher=Iceland Review |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of those five priests are women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ásatrúarfélagið: Fjölgun goða með vígsluréttindi |url=http://www.asatru.is/Fundagerdir/Vigslurettindi.htm |date=October 8, 2006 |work= |publisher=Ásatrúarfélagið |accessdate=July 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As of 2018 there are 10 priests who are officially allowed by the government to conduct legally binding ceremonies. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Ásatrúarfélagið: Fjölgun goða með vígsluréttindi |url=https://asatru.is/godar |work= |publisher=Ásatrúarfélagið |accessdate=August 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Beliefs and theology==

[[File:Neopagan graveyard.JPG|right|thumb|The Ásatrú graveyard in Reykjavík]]
The website of Ásatrúarfélagið (as of 2009) defines ''Ásatrú'' as belief "in the [[Scandinavian folklore|Icelandic/Nordic folklore]], the spirits and entities the folklore represents, in addition to gods and other beings from the Nordic [[pantheism]]".&lt;ref&gt;The Icelandic version has "''Ásatrú'' is a pagan tradition based on tolerance, honesty, magnanimity and respect for nature and all life". (''Ásatrú eða heiðinn siður byggir á umburðarlyndi, heiðarleika, drengskap og virðingu fyrir náttúrunni og öllu lífi.'') [https://web.archive.org/web/20061205064006/http://asatru.is/ (2006)]&lt;/ref&gt;

From the beginning, Ásatrúarfélagið has not had any fixed religious dogma or theology. Individual members have various beliefs (there are, for example, a number of [[Wicca]]n members).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?issId=278075&amp;pageId=3991959&amp;lang=en&amp;navsel=666&amp;q=wicca |title=Fréttablaðið |publisher=Timarit.is |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though members are not expected to follow the lead of any religious authority, all the high priests have publicly expressed their personal beliefs at one point or another.

Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson summarized his religious convictions in his autobiography, saying that he had not a simple religious conviction but a "somewhat unquiet faith".&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "dálítið ókyrr trú". Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1992:182).&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;My faith is based on a constant search but I don't search frantically. It's no use to rush out into space to search for some gods there, if they want to have anything to do with me, they will come. I have often become aware of them, but I don't rush after them or shout at them. I have gotten to know them a bit in myself and also in other people. ... Primarily it is the effects of the great force felt by everyone that make me religious. ... The most remarkable thing about faith is that it gives us growth, the possibility to grow and thrive. And humility cannot be neglected. Without it we cannot live to any useful degree, though of course it has its particular place. But a man who is completely without it is a madman.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "Trú mín byggir á stöðugri leit en ég fer mér samt að engu óðslega við að leita. Það þýðir ekkert að æða út í geiminn til að leita að einhverjum guðum þar, ef þeir vilja hafa eitthvað með mig að gera, þá koma þeir. Ég hef oft orðið var við þá, en æði ekki á eftir þeim eða hrópa á þá. Ég hef kynnst þeim dálítið í sjálfum mér og öðru fólki líka. ... Það eru fyrst og fremst áhrifin frá hinum mikla krafti sem allir finna fyrir sem gera mig trúaðan. ... Það merkilegasta við trúna er að hún gefur okkur vöxt, möguleika til að vaxa og gróa. Og ekki má sleppa auðmýktinni. Án hennar getum við ekki lifað að neinu gagni þótt hún verði náttúrlega að koma í réttan stað niður. En sá sem er alveg sviptur henni, hann er vitfirringur." Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson (1992:183).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1992 interview, Jörmundur Ingi Hansen expressed his views on various theological subjects, including the nature of the gods and the basis of his Ásatrú beliefs.

&lt;blockquote&gt;From my perspective, the world is split into two in its nature, divided into constructive forces, the Æsir, and the destructive forces which we call [[Jötunn|jötnar]]. ... Ásatrú or heathenry is basically only to realize this dichotomy and to decide to side with the Æsir. The best way to do that, in my opinion, is to be self-consistent, live in harmony with nature, associate with it with respect and to submit to the public order. ... The gods shape the dwelling places of people, the earth and the solar system out of the material that already exists. To that extent we can look on the forces of nature as the gods themselves and to a large extent that is what people did in antiquity.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "Ég lít svo á að heimurinn sé tvískiptur í eðli sínu, skiptist í uppbyggjandi öfl, æsi, og hin eyðandi öfl sem við köllum jötna. ... Ásatrú eða heiðni er í grundvallaratriðum ekki annað en að gera sér grein fyrir þessari tvískiptingu og skipa sér í lið ása. Það gerir maður best, að mínu viti, með því að vera sjálfum sér samkvæmur, lifa í sátt við náttúruna, umgangast hana með virðingu og hlíta allsherjarreglu. ... Guðirnir móta bústað manna, jörðina og sólkerfið úr því efni sem fyrir er. Að því leyti getum við litið á náttúruöflin sem sjálfa guðina og það gerði fólk til forna að miklu leyti." ''Lesbók Morgunblaðsins'', November 14, 1992, pages 4-5. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3309806&amp;issId=242568&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 1996 interview, Jónína K. Berg said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Ásatrú is a pantheistic belief. The earth, the air and the water has great value to us. We are a part of the earth and not its masters.&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "ásatrúin er algyðistrú. Jörðin, loftið og vatnið hefur mikið gildi fyrir okkur. Við erum hluti af jörðinni en ekki herrar hennar." Sólveig Jónasdóttir, Vera, 1996:4:9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2003 interview, Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson summarized his faith.

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe in a higher power which appears to us in the multiplicity of nature and of human life. We have manifestations of certain primal forces which we regard as gods and we have a division in the roles of the gods. These are powers that are visible, half-visible and sometimes invisible. One could have a long scholarly discussion on the role of individual gods, but in the end this is a question of a feeling for the different aspects of life.
&lt;ref&gt;
Icelandic, „Ég trúi á æðri mátt sem birtist okkur í fjölbreytileika náttúrunnar og mannlífsins. Við erum með birtingarform á ákveðnum frumkröftum, sem við höfum gefið guðanöfn og við erum með deildaskiptingu í hlutverkum guðanna. Þetta eru öfl sem eru sýnileg, hálfsýnileg og stundum ósýnileg. Maður getur röflað endalaust fræðilega um hlutverk ákveðinna guða, en þegar allt kemur til alls, þá er þetta spurning um tilfinningu fyrir mismunandi þáttum lífsins.“ Morgunblaðið, January 12, 2003, page B 3.

==''Blót'' and other rituals==
[[File:Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson 1991.jpg|right|thumb|Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson at a ''blót'' in 1991]]

The central ritual performed by Ásatrúarfélagið is the communal ''[[blót]]'' feast. A ''blót'' starts with a ''goði'' hallowing the ceremony with a certain formula and declaring a truce between all present. This is followed by the reciting or chanting of verses from the ''[[Poetic Edda]]''. Next, a [[drinking horn]] is passed around and participants drink to the [[Norse gods|gods]], the [[wight]]s and the [[ancestor worship|ancestors]]. [[Libation]]s are offered. This initial part of the ceremony, often conducted outdoors, is followed by a communal feast, typically indoors. The feast is often accompanied by musical performances or other forms of entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;Sveinn Guðjónsson. "Það hefur alltaf fylgt kristinni trú þetta ofstæki...". ''Vísir'', August 19, 1978, pages 14-17. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3376505&amp;issId=248406&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="asatru.is" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;

In the early days of the movement, the founders were asked whether they conducted [[ritual slaughter]] of animals during ''blót''. The general response was that while this would not be morally problematic it was not practical.&lt;ref name="Sigurður A. Magnússon 1990:197" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sv. G. "Vor siður á erindi til allra manna". ''Lesbók Morgunblaðsins'', June 2, 1974, pages 14-16. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3296272&amp;issId=241718&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson commented:

&lt;blockquote&gt;No, for the simple reason that we can't be bothered. It's far easier to just get a carcass so that's what we do. In earlier times it was normal to slaughter the animal in place because people couldn't store meat. But in modern circumstances it's completely unnecessary and too much trouble."&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, „Nei, og það stafar einfaldlega af því að við nennum því ekki. Það er miklu auðveldara að fá sér bara kjötskrokk, enda gerum við það. Hér áður fyrr var það eðlilegt að slátra skepnunni á staðnum því þá gátu menn ekki geymt kjöt. En við nútíma aðstæður er það hreinn óþarfi og of mikið umstang". Source: http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3376503&amp;issId=248406&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nevertheless, during the first public ''blót'' "a sympathizing visual artist brought along a live cock and had it beheaded in the kitchen, while the lamb was being cooked".&lt;ref name="Sigurður A. Magnússon 1990:197"/&gt;

Ásatrúarfélagið has since stated that it rejects the use of Ásatrú as a justification for animal sacrifice, as well as for militarism and supremacy ideology.&lt;ref&gt;https://asatru.is/statement&lt;/ref&gt;

The four main ''blót'' are ''Jólablót'' ("Yule blót") on the winter solstice, ''Sigurblót'' ("Victory blót") on the [[First Day of Summer]], ''Sumarblót'' ("Summer blót") on the summer solstice, and ''Veturnáttablót'' ("[[Winter Nights]] blót") on the First Day of Winter. The organization also holds ''[[Þorrablót]]'' and individual ''goðar'' hold local ''blót'' on various occasions.&lt;ref name="asatru.is" /&gt;

Other rituals include name-giving ceremonies, ''siðfesta'' (a [[coming of age]] ritual), weddings and burials. The first Ásatrú name-giving ceremony took place in November 1973.&lt;ref&gt;EA. "Ég gef þér nafn og nefni þig...". ''Vísir''. November 23, 1973, page 3. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3251740&amp;issId=238457&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson performed the first Ásatrú wedding ceremony in August 1977, marrying Dagur Þorleifsson and Ingibjörg Hjartardóttir.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;ARH. "Las úr Eddukvæðum yfir brúðhjónunum". ''[[Alþýðublaðið]]'', August 26, 1977. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3220038&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1999, the organization has its own burial ground and several burials have taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://asatru.is/Starfsemi/Athafnir.htm |title=Athafnir |publisher=Asatru.is |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, a decision was made to sell the organization's property. The property had increased substantially in value since it was bought in 1998. The profit from the sale made building a [[temple]] (referred to by the organisation in Icelandic as a ''hof'') a realistic option&lt;ref&gt;"Af yfirlýsingum".  ''Vor siður'', 2:2005, page 8.

===Ásheimar===
Árni Sverrisson, a member of Ásatrúarfélagið, built a hof at his farm Efri Ás in [[Skagafjörður]] from 2010 to 2014. The project started as a small building which eventually grew to 80 square meters. The building was constructed with stone and turf walls, a wooden framework and a turf covered roof. It was named Ásheimar and consecrated by the ''goði'' Jóhanna Harðardóttir in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;Magnús Sveinn Helgason, '[http://icelandmag.is/tags/asheimar Visit the only heathen temple in Iceland in Skagafjörður fjord for a pagan grill party this Saturday]' ''Iceland Magazine'' (7 August 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and activism==

In June 1974 Ásatrúarfélagið issued a press release opposing the legalization of abortion and recommending strict punishment for distributors of narcotics.&lt;ref&gt;"Fóstureyðingar eru manndráp - Aðgerðir þarf í fíkniefnamálum".

Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3211970&amp;issId=235382&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt; A few days later, Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson stated that this latter press release did not have its origins in any legal meeting of Ásatrúarfélagið and
only represented the private opinions of its author.&lt;ref&gt;"Ekki á vegum ásatrúarmanna". ''Vísir''. April 25, 1975, page 8. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3261893&amp;issId=239051&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following years, Ásatrúarfélagið mostly did not involve itself in political questions, though individual members did. Having been unable to advance his racial ideology within Ásatrúarfélagið, Þorsteinn Guðjónsson in 1982 founded a separate organization, ''Norrænt mannkyn'' ("Nordic Race"), to lobby for the reduction of immigration and banning of abortion.&lt;ref&gt;KÞ. "Það væri skaði fyrir mannkynið ef norrænn stofn liði undir lok". ''DV - Helgarblað II'', September 4, 1982, pages 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pétur Pétursson (1985:27).&lt;/ref&gt; Sveinbjörn Beinteinsson was active in the peace movement, erecting a ''[[níðstöng]]'' against nuclear power in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;"Friðarbúðir í minningu helsprengjunnar". ''Alþýðublaðið''. August 1, 1985, page 2. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3338229&amp;issId=245506&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Summarizing her 1991 study of Germanic folk religion, literary scholar [[Stefanie von Schnurbein]] describes Ásatrúarfélagið as a "mix of individualistic anarchists, atheistic church opponents, and racist spiritualists".&lt;ref&gt;Norwegian, "blanding av individualistiske anarkister, ateistiske kirkefiender og rasistiske spiritister"; von Schnurbein, Stefanie. "Fornyet Naturreligion eller rasistisk kult?: Moderne åsatro-grupper i Tyskland og Norden." ''Chaos: Dansk-Norsk tidsskrift for religionhistoriske studier''. 1994:(22), pp. 117-130. Page 120. See also von Schnurbein (1991:181).&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2001 study of Ásatrú in Iceland, anthropologist María Erlendsdóttir disagreed, pointing out that von Schnurbein's field research included only two interviews with members of the organization and arguing that this was "not enough to give sound grounds to her accusations".&lt;ref&gt;María Erlendsdóttir (2001:27).&lt;/ref&gt; She further argued that "the heavy accusations of Von Schnurbein contradict certain clues that Ásatrúarfélagið has an open mind to people of other cultures and races"&lt;ref&gt;María Erlendsdóttir (2001:28).&lt;/ref&gt; and concluded that "Icelandic paganism in contemporary society has strong roots within folk belief and literary tradition".&lt;ref&gt;María Erlendsdóttir (2001:43).&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2000 study of Ásatrúarfélagið, religious studies scholar Michael Strmiska noted that "Ásatrú movements in America and Scandinavia have been known to espouse racist and Neo-Nazi ideology" but that he was "not aware of any member of Icelandic Ásatrú espousing such sentiments or ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Strmiska (2000:117).&lt;/ref&gt;

Since early on, [[environmentalism]] has been important to members of Ásatrúarfélagið&lt;ref&gt;Pétur Pétursson. 1985. "Island" in ''Religiös förändring i Norden 1930-1980''. Pp. 111-153. Page 147.&lt;/ref&gt; and the organization has been active in environmentalist causes. In October 2003, Hilmar Örn Hilmarsson erected a ''níðstöng'' against the [[Kárahnjúkar Hydropower Plant]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefán Pálsson. "Trúfélög og pólitík". ''Múrinn'', October 10, 2003. http://www.murinn.is/eldra_b.asp?nr=298&amp;gerd=Gler&amp;arg=4&lt;/ref&gt; Jóhanna G. Harðardóttir, a ''goði'', wrote on the occasion: "We have come to call upon gods and good [[wight]]s. We intend to ask for mercy for our land and we intend to erect a ''níðstöng'' to those who dishonor their mother, the earth."&lt;ref&gt;Icelandic, "Við erum hingað komin til að ákalla goð og góða vætti. Við ætlum að biðja landinu okkar griða og við ætlum að reisa þeim níðstöng sem svívirða móður sína, jörðina". Jóhanna G. Harðardóttir. "Kárahnjúkar kvaddir". ''Morgunblaðið'', October 26, 2003, page 30. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3482457&amp;issId=251776&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Ásatrúarfélagið participates in forest reclamation in [[Heiðmörk]] with the [[Icelandic Forestry Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asatru.is/Starfsemi/Heidmork_grodursetning.htm |title=Heiðmörk |publisher=Asatru.is |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has fought for the [[LGBT rights in Iceland|right to marry gay couples]].&lt;ref&gt;Stefán Pálsson. "Skömmum Alþingi, ekki biskupinn". ''Múrinn'', June 28, 2004. http://murinn.is/eldra_b.asp?nr=1287&amp;gerd=Frettir&amp;arg=5&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Breytingunum ber að fagna". ''24 stundir'', June 27, 2008, page 6. Available online at http://timarit.is/view_page_init.jsp?pageId=3631836&amp;issId=259224&amp;lang=en&lt;/ref&gt;

Ásatrúarfélagið has fought for the [[separation of church and state]],&lt;ref name="FREE_CHURCH"/&gt; and for a share in a fund currently only accessible to the National Church. The Church supports the latter effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kirkjan.is/node/5043 |title=Ásatrúarfélagið og jöfnunarsjóður &amp;#124; Þjóðkirkjan |publisher=Kirkjan.is |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ásatrúarfélagið cooperates on issues of common concern with other Icelandic religious organizations,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2006/12/01/threttan_trufelog_stofna_samradsvettvang_trufelaga/ |title=Þrettán trúfélög stofna Samráðsvettvang trúfélaga |publisher=mbl.is |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in particular the [[Reykjavík Free Church]].&lt;ref name="FREE_CHURCH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.asatru.is/PFD/vor_sidur_2tbl_2009.pdf |title=Vor sidur 2006 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=June 26, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, [[Sigurjón Þórðarson]], an active member of Ásatrúarfélagið and a ''goði'', was elected to the [[Althing]] for the [[Liberal Party (Iceland)|Liberal Party]]. When asked if his faith shaped the way he approached laws and the structure of government he replied: "I’m in favour of separating faith and law, but I do think that faith marks the individual."&lt;ref&gt;Fontaine-Nikolov, Paul. "The Pagan MP". ''The Reykjavík Grapevine''. Available online at [http://www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/The-Pagan-MP www.grapevine.is/Features/ReadArticle/The-Pagan-MP].&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 Ásatrúarfélagið issued a statement against the abuse of their name and their religion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We strongly oppose any attempt by individuals to use their association with the Ásatrúarfélagið of Iceland to promote attitudes, ideologies and practices rejected by the leadership of the Ásatrúarfélagið. We particularly reject the use of Ásatrú as a justification for supremacy ideology, militarism and animal sacrifice.
It should also be known that visitors have no authority to speak on our behalf. There is no advisor to the Ásatrúarfélagið and there is no spokesman other than our allsherjargoði. We respectfully request that visitors not claim any such authority based on their association with us.&lt;ref&gt;http://asatru.is/statement&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
