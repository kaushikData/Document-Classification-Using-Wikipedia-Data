'''Adam James Powell''' (born 20 December 1976) is a Welsh computer programmer, [[game designer]] and businessman.  He is the co-founder of [[Neopets]] and [[Meteor Games]].

==Career==
Powell attended the [[University of Nottingham]] from 1995 to 1998 studying for a computer science degree.  During his time at Nottingham, Powell created Dark Heart released in 1996, a popular MUD based on the [[DikuMUD]] code.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meteorgames.com/about/ Meteor Games About Us Page] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203104445/http://www.meteorgames.com/about/ |date=3 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Powell started [http://www.shoutad.com Shout! Advertising], a UK-based advertising company which operated the third largest click-through program on the Internet by mid-1999. He also co-founded [[Netmagic]], a successful business which designed and sold online banner advertising. Then in July 1999, he founded [[Powlex]], which focused on web page design.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.neopets.com/presskit/press09a.html Neopets Press Kit Biography] {{webarchive |url=https://archive.is/20070702084923/http://info.neopets.com/presskit/press09a.html |date=2 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neopets===
Powell first had the idea of Neopets in 1997, while studying at the [[University of Nottingham]].
He and Donna Powell (formerly Donna Williams) started programming the site in September 1999, and launched the site two months later on 15 November 1999. Powell programmed the entire site, and created most of the original activities and games.&lt;ref name="adambackground"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Neopets Addiction|publisher=Wired Magazine|date=1 December 2005|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/neopets.html|accessdate=1 December 2005| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20051210025830/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/13.12/neopets.html| archivedate= 10 December 2005 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2000, Powell negotiated a significant investment in Neopets.com and transferred the company from the UK to Los Angeles, US.  After the relocation, Powell remained on staff as creative director and technical lead. Under Powell's management, Neopets went from its initial launch to over 140 million accounts and 5 billion pageviews per month. On 20 June 2005, [[Viacom]] bought Neopets, Inc. for US$160 million.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/business/technology/articles/2005/06/21/viacoms_mtv_buys_neopets_for_160m/ Viacom MTV buys Neopets for $160m]&lt;/ref&gt;

Powell continued to work for Neopets.com until June 2007, aiding the transition following the purchase and continuing to develop high-end concepts for the site.

Powell has creative design and writing credits on a wide variety of Neopets products including SCEA's 2006 [[PlayStation Portable]] release ''[[Neopets: Petpet Adventures: The Wand of Wishing]]'', ''[[Wizards of the Coast]]'' September 2003 release the ''[[Neopets Trading Card Game]]'' and Sony Computer Entertainment America Inc's 2005 release ''[[Neopets: The Darkest Faerie]]'', for the [[PlayStation 2]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0467411/fullcredits IMDB Game Credits]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Meteor Games===
In 2007, Adam and Donna Powell founded [[Meteor Games]],&lt;ref name="newcompany"&gt;{{cite news|title=New MMO games startup, Meteor Games, to target youth demographic|publisher=Venturebeat.com|date=1 July 2008|url=https://venturebeat.com/2008/07/01/meteor-games-founders-hope-to-duplicate-neopets-success-with-new-online-world/|accessdate=1 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; an independent online gaming studio committed to developing immersive and innovative games spanning the web, social networks, and mobile devices. As of February 2011 Meteor Games hadn't raised any venture capital and was profitable&lt;ref name="profitable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allthingsd.com/20110224/how-an-older-social-game-keeps-making-money/|title=How an Older Social Game Keeps Making Money|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=24 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Meteor Games]]' first project was [[Twin Skies]],&lt;ref name="twinskies"&gt;{{cite news|title=Neopets creators enter the MMO world with Twin Skies|publisher=Massively|date=13 July 2008|url=http://www.massively.com/2008/07/13/neopets-creators-enter-the-mmo-world-with-twin-skies/|accessdate=13 July 2008| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080717132044/http://www.massively.com/2008/07/13/neopets-creators-enter-the-mmo-world-with-twin-skies/| archivedate= 17 July 2008 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; a 3D MMO that blended casual gaming and social networking elements with traditional massively multiplayer online role-playing games.&lt;ref name="launchdate"&gt;{{cite news|title= Neopets Founders Announce Innovative MMO Twin Skies|publisher=Kotaku|date=5 August 2008

The game was free to play on the web and Facebook.&lt;ref name="vpn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virtualgoodsnews.com/2009/04/how-meteor-games-plans-for-virtual-goods-success.html |title=How Meteor Games Plans For Virtual Goods Success |publisher=Virtual Goods News |date=23 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090427080631/http://www.virtualgoodsnews.com/2009/04/how-meteor-games-plans-for-virtual-goods-success.html |archivedate=27 April 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the company's shift to the rapidly growing social gaming market&lt;ref name = "socialgamingrowth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emarketer.com/Article.aspx?R=1008166|title=Social Gaming Market to Surpass $1 Billion|date=12 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; it released several games based on internal intellectual property including: Island Paradise which became a large commercial success,&lt;ref name="profitable"/&gt; Serf Wars, and Ranch Town.

Meteor Games is headquartered in Los Angeles and has 100 employees.&lt;ref name="mgemployees"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.meteorgames.com/about/ |title=About Meteor Games |publisher=Meteor Games |date=29 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110203104445/http://www.meteorgames.com/about/ |archivedate=3 February 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Late in December 2011, Meteor Games laid off 90% of its staff, shut down the Viacom-backed game "Treasure Keepers", and subsequently wound down all operations.&lt;ref&gt;http://blog.games.com/2011/12/14/meteor-games-layoffs-neopets-closes/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moglings===
Around June 2013, Adam stated that he, Donna, and TPOSG would be making a new game. In Donna's Reddit AMA, she said that the tentative title would be Moglings, and development would start in 2015. On September 22, 2014, Adam stated in a post to the [https://www.reddit.com/r/moglings/ Moglings subreddit] that the project would be suspended for some time, perhaps to be taken up again in early 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Project Update • /r/moglings|url = https://www.reddit.com/r/moglings/comments/2h422s/project_update/|website = reddit|accessdate = 2015-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Archaeidae''' are a [[spider]] family with about 70 described species in four genera, {{as of|lc=yes|2016|October}}.&lt;ref name=WSC_stats/&gt; Commonly known as '''assassin spiders''', they are also known as '''pelican spiders''', stemming from their specialised anatomy: they have elongated [[chelicerae]] (jaws) and necks for catching other spiders.

==Assassin spiders==
Spiders of the family Archaeidae are unusual in that they have "necks", which can be very long and slender, or short and fat.  Archaeids prey only upon other spiders. Assassin spiders were first known from 40 million year old [[amber]] fossils which were found in [[Europe]] in the 1840s, and were not known to have living varieties until 1881, when the first living assassin spider was found in Madagascar. They are native to [[Australia]], [[South Africa]], and [[Madagascar]], with the sister family [[Mecysmaucheniidae]] occurring in southern South America and New Zealand. They range in size from 2–8&amp;nbsp;mm.

The fossil record of this family was first identified from [[Baltic amber]] dating to the [[Eocene]], although many taxa from these deposits have been reassigned to Mecysmaucheniidae, [[Pararchaeidae]], and [[Holarchaeidae]]. Currently valid Baltic species include ''[[Archaea levigata]]'' and ''[[Archaea paradoxa]]''. In 2003, ''[[Burmesarchaea grimaldii|Afarchaea grimaldii]]'' was described from [[Cretaceous]] Burmese amber aged between 88-95 million years, extending the record of this group considerably, the oldest fossil known of the group is ''Patarchaea muralis'' from the [[Middle Jurassic]] ([[Oxfordian (stage)|Oxfordian]]/[[Callovian]]) of [[Inner Mongolia]], [[China]].&lt;ref name="SeldenDiying2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Selden|first1=Paul A.|last2=Diying|first2=Huang|last3=Dong|first3=Ren|title=Palpimanoid spiders from the Jurassic of China|journal=Journal of Arachnology|volume=36|issue=2|year=2008|pages=306–321|issn=0161-8202|doi=10.1636/CA07-106.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The family Archaeidae was erected in 1854 by [[C. L. Koch]] and Berendt&lt;ref name=WSC_f10/&gt; for one genus, ''[[Archaea (spider)|Archaea]]'',  initially with three extinct species,&lt;ref name=KockBere54/&gt; all found in [[amber]] from the [[Baltic Sea]] or [[Bitterfeld]] in [[Saxony-Anhalt]], Germany. No living species are placed in this genus.

===Extant genera===

{{As of|2018|September}}, five extant genera are accepted by the [[World Spider Catalog]]:&lt;ref name=WSC_f10&gt;{{citation |title=Family Archaeidae C. L. Koch &amp; Berendt, 1854 |work=World Spider Catalog |publisher=Natural History Museum Bern |url=http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/family/10 |accessdate=2018-09-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''[[Afrarchaea]]'' &lt;small&gt;Forster &amp; Platnick, 1984&lt;/small&gt; – South Africa, Madagascar
*''[[Austrarchaea]]'' &lt;small&gt;Forster &amp; Platnick, 1984&lt;/small&gt; – Australia
*''[[Eriauchenius]]'' &lt;small&gt;O. Pickard-Cambridge, 1881&lt;/small&gt; – Madagascar, South Africa
*''[[Madagascarchaea]]'' &lt;small&gt;Wood &amp; Scharff, 2018&lt;/small&gt; – Madagascar
*''[[Zephyrarchaea]]'' &lt;small&gt;Rix &amp; Harvey, 2012&lt;/small&gt; – Australia

===Fossils===

Fossils found in [[amber]], particularly from the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] and [[Myanmar]] (Burma), have been assigned to a number of extant and extinct genera placed in the family Archaeidae.&lt;ref name=DunlPennJeke15&gt;{{citation |last1=Dunlop |first1=J.A. |last2=Penney |first2=D. |last3=Jekel |first3=D. |date=2016 |title=A summary list of fossil spiders and their relatives, version 17.5 |work=World Spider Catalog |publisher=Natural History Museum Bern |url=http://www.wsc.nmbe.ch/resources/fossils/Fossils16.5.pdf |accessdate=2016-10-13 |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The extinct species ''[[Burmesarchaea grimaldii]]'' (syn. ''Afrarchaea grimaldii'') was found in Burmese amber dated to 88–95 [[Mya (unit)|Mya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Penney |first=D. |date=2003 |title=''Afrarchaea grimaldii'', a new species of Archaeidae (Araneae) in Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=Journal of Arachnology |volume=31 |pp=122–130 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v31_n1/arac-31-01-0122.pdf |accessdate=2016-10-13 |doi=10.1636/0161-8202(2003)031[0122:aganso]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Jurarchaea zherikhini]]'' Eskov, 1987 was previously considered a member of this family, but it is more likely a holarchaeid or a pararchaeid.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Phylogeny===
A 2012 Bayesian phylogenetic analysis of 15 Archaeidae species, using combined molecular and morphological data, produced the cladogram shown below. Species representing modern genera found in Africa and Madagascar (''Afrarchaea'' and ''Eriauchenius'') were not resolved into monophyletic groups; ''Zephyrarchaea'' had not then been split off from ''Austrarchaea''. The species found in European amber formed a clade, whereas ''Burmesarchaea grimaldii'', from Burmese amber, appeared to be basal to modern genera.&lt;ref name=WoodGrisGill12/&gt;

==Early life and education==
De Grey was born and brought up in London, England.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/fortune_archive/2004/06/14/372618/index.htm |title=This Man Would Have You Live A Really, Really, Really, Really Long Time.

[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/healthandwellbeing.genetics Holding back the years], ''The Observer'', 16 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  He was educated at [[Sussex House School]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sussexhouseschool.co.uk/main_pages/aboutUs.html |title=About Us |publisher=[[Sussex House School]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121009191353/http://www.sussexhouseschool.co.uk/main_pages/aboutUs.html |archivedate=9 October 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Harrow School]]. He attended the [[University of Cambridge]], and studied at its constituent college of [[Trinity Hall, Cambridge|Trinity Hall]]. He graduated with a BA in computer science in 1985.&lt;ref name=executive&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sens.org/about/leadership/executive-team|title=Executive Team|work=sens.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After graduation in 1985, de Grey joined [[Sinclair Research Ltd]] as an [[artificial intelligence]] and software engineer. In 1986, he cofounded Man-Made Minions Ltd to pursue the development of an automated [[formal verification|formal program verifier]]. At a graduate party in Cambridge, De Grey met [[Drosophila melanogaster|fruit fly]] geneticist [[Adelaide Carpenter]] whom he would later marry. Through her he was introduced to the intersection of biology and programming when her boss needed someone who knew about computers and biology to take over the running of a database on fruit flies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mprize.org/index.php?pagename=newsdetaildisplay&amp;ID=044 Aubrey de Grey], Methuselah Foundation, accessed 9 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He educated himself in biology by reading journals and textbooks, attending conferences, and being tutored by his wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2007/sep/16/healthandwellbeing.genetics|title=Tom Templeton on biomedical theorist Aubrey de Grey|author=Tom Templeton|work=the Guardian|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-01/prophet-immortality|title=The Prophet of Immortality|work=Popular Science|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1992 to 2006, he was in charge of software development at the university's Genetics Department for the [[FlyBase]] [[genetics|genetic]] database.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Cambridge awarded de Grey a PhD in biology on 9 December 2000.&lt;ref name=executive/&gt;&lt;ref name=camreporter&gt;[http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/reporter/2000-01/weekly/5831/27.html Congregation of the Regent House on 9 December 2000], [[Cambridge University Reporter]], 13 December 2000.  [http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/gradstud/exams/higher/special.pdf Special regulations] available only to Cambridge degree holders (of whatever discipline) permit the submission of  "...a significant contribution to scholarship" instead. Though the awardee has not been registered as a PhD student, the degree is not honorary; applicants are evaluated by the usual methods, with examiners appointed and an oral defense of the submitted work.&lt;/ref&gt; The degree was based on his 1999 book ''The Mitochondrial Free Radical Theory of Aging'', in which de Grey wrote that obviating damage to mitochondrial DNA might by itself extend lifespan significantly, though he said it was more likely that cumulative damage to [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] is a significant cause of senescence, but not the single dominant cause.

===Strategies===
De Grey argues that most of the fundamental knowledge needed to develop effective anti-aging medicine already exists, and that the science is ahead of the funding. He works to identify and promote specific technological approaches to the reversal of various aspects of aging, or, as de Grey puts it, "... the set of accumulated side effects from metabolism that eventually kills us."&lt;ref name="050411_aubrey_interview.html"/&gt;

{{As of|2005}}, his work centered on a detailed plan called Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence (SENS), which is aimed at preventing age-related physical and cognitive decline. In March 2009, he cofounded the [[SENS Research Foundation]] (named SENS Foundation until early 2013), a non-profit organisation based in California, United States, where he currently serves as Chief Science Officer. The Foundation "works to develop, promote and ensure widespread access to regenerative medicine solutions to the disabilities and diseases of aging,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sens.org/sens-foundation/brief-history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101222223643/http://www.sens.org/sens-foundation/brief-history|date=22 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; focusing on the Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence. Before March 2009, the SENS research program was mainly pursued by the [[Methuselah Foundation]], cofounded by de Grey.

A major activity of the Methuselah Foundation is the [[Methuselah Mouse Prize]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mprize.org|title=Methuselah Foundation|work=mprize.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; a prize designed to incentivize research into effective life extension interventions by awarding monetary prizes to researchers who stretch the lifespan of mice to unprecedented lengths. De Grey stated in March 2005 "if we are to bring about real regenerative therapies that will benefit not just future generations, but those of us who are alive today, we must encourage scientists to work on the problem of aging." The prize reached 4.2 [[United States dollar|USD]] million in February 2007.

In 2005, he was the subject of two highly critical editorials accompanying an article in ''[[MIT Technology Review]]''.&lt;ref name=NulandFebr2005&gt;Nuland, Sherwin. February 2005. "[http://www.technologyreview.com/Biotech/14147/ Do You Want to Live Forever?]" ''Technology Review''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, de Grey wrote the book ''[[Ending Aging]]'' with the assistance of Michael Rae.&lt;ref name=EndingAging&gt;de Grey, Aubrey; Rae, Michael. September 2007. ''[[Ending Aging]]: The Rejuvenation Breakthroughs that Could Reverse Human Aging in Our Lifetime''. New York, NY: Saint Martin's Press, 416 p. {{ISBN|0-312-36706-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It provides a detailed account of the science, politics and social challenges of the entire SENS agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= [[Ben Best]] |title= Book Review: Ending Aging |work= Life Extension Magazine |publisher= [[Life Extension Foundation]] |date=December 2007 |url= http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2007/dec2007_bookreview_01.htm |accessdate= 12 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 broadcast on the [[Arte]] German &amp; French TV, de Grey claimed that the first human to live 1,000 years was probably already alive, and might even be between 50 and 60 years old already.&lt;ref&gt;''Aux frontières de l'immortalité'', 16 November 2008, 23:10, director  : Gerald Caillat&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2008, soon after he began speaking publicly about his gerontological theories, de Grey has been scientific advisor for the Campaign for Aging Research (C.A.R.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightaging.org/archives/2009/07/longevity-meme-newsletter-july-20-2009.php|title=Longevity Meme Newsletter, July 20 2009|work=Fight Aging!|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{as of|2013}}, the SENS Research Foundation has an annual budget of $4 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sens.org/about/organizational-reports|title=Organizational Reports|work=sens.org|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro-aging trance===
[[File:SENS FOUNDATION - AUBREY DE GREY (6838320854).jpg|alt=de Grey smiling|thumb|de Grey, 2012]]
The "pro-aging trance" is a term coined by Grey to describe "the impulsion to leap to embarrassingly unjustified conclusions in order to put the horror of aging out of one's mind".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= de Grey |first= Aubrey |title= Combating the Tithonus Error: What Works? |journal= [[Rejuvenation Research]] |volume= 11 |issue= 4 |pages= 713–715 |date= August 2008 |doi= 10.1089/rej.2008.0775 |pmid= 18729803}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to de Grey, the pro-aging trance or "pro-aging edifice"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= de Grey |first= Aubrey |title= Cracks in Social Gerontology's Pro-Aging Edifice |journal= [[Rejuvenation Research]] |volume= 12 |issue= 1 |pages= 1–2 |date= February 2009 |doi= 10.1089/rej.2009.0841 |pmid= 19236163}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a psychological strategy which people use to cope with aging, and which is rooted in the belief that aging is not only immutable and unavoidable, but ''desirable'' in some sense, as part of the natural or divine order that should not be perturbed. De Grey refers, in this regard, to the general public's ambivalence towards aging. For example, he states that [[SENS Research Foundation|SENS]] research is often misunderstood or misrepresented as likely to lead to ''prolonging'', rather than postponing, the period of decrepitude characteristic of old age—a belief that de Grey calls the "Tithonus error", in reference to the myth of [[Tithonus]]. He describes this "pro-aging" stance as an irrational response&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R2CR7NeLumI}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the perceived inevitability of aging, and compares it with related ideas and experimental findings in [[terror management theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pyszczynski|first1=T|last2=Greenberg|first2=J|title=Understanding the paradox of opposition to long-term extension of the human lifespan: fear of feath, cultural worldviews, and the illusion of objectivity|journal=Rejuvenation Research|date=September 2013|volume=16|issue=S1|pages=S36-7|ref=Pyszczynski2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, de Grey believes that defeating aging is feasible and that the pro-aging trance represents a huge barrier to combating aging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/aubrey_de_grey_says_we_can_avoid_aging|title=Aubrey de Grey: A roadmap to end aging - Talk Video - TED.com|author=Aubrey de Grey|work=ted.com|accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding of SENS Research Foundation===
In 2011, de Grey inherited roughly $16.5 million on the death of his mother.&lt;ref name="lef.org"&gt;Ben Best (2013) [http://www.lef.org/magazine/mag2013/jul2013_Interview-with-Aubrey-de-Grey-PhD_01.htm "Interview with Aubrey de Grey, PhD"]. Life Extension Magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; Of this he assigned $13 million to fund SENS research, which by 2013 had the effect of roughly doubling the SENS Research Foundation's yearly budget to $4 million.{{Citation needed|date=January 2016}} Other donors who have given millions to the Foundation include investor [[Peter Thiel]].&lt;ref name="lef.org"/&gt; The foundation also has yearly funding drives that have been successful with some significant donors offering matching grants for members of the public who donate.&lt;ref name=SRFnews201502&gt;{{cite news|last1=SENS Research Foundation|title=February 2015 Newsletter|url=http://www.sens.org/sites/srf.org/files/newsletter-archive/February%202015%20NL.html|accessdate=24 February 2015|work=SENS Research Foundation Newsletter|date=February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FA!20141215&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reason|title=SENS Fundraiser Success!|url=https://www.fightaging.org/archives/2014/12/sens-fundraiser-success.php|publisher=Fight Aging!|accessdate=24 February 2015|date=December 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===AgeX Therapeutics, Inc.===
In July 2017 de Grey was appointed Vice President of New Technology Discovery at [[BioTime#Subsidiaries|AgeX Therapeutics]], a startup in the Longevity space helmed by [[Michael D. West]], PhD.&lt;ref name=Reuters/&gt;&lt;ref name = NextBigFuture/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= AgeX Therapeutics lands $10 mln|url=https://www.pehub.com/2017/08/agex-therapeutics-lands-10-mln/ |work= PE HUB |date= August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The seven types of aging damage===
{{Main article|Strategies for Engineered Negligible Senescence}}
De Grey proposed the following types of aging damage:
#Mutations – in chromosomes causing cancer due to nuclear mutations/epimutations:
#:These are changes to the nuclear [[DNA]] (nDNA), the molecule that contains genetic information in [[eukaryote]]s, or to proteins which bind to the nDNA. Certain [[mutation]]s can lead to cancer, and, according to de Grey, non-cancerous mutations and [[Epigenetics|epimutations]] do not contribute to aging within a normal lifespan, so cancer is the only endpoint of these types of damage that must be addressed.
#Mutations – in mitochondria:
#:[[Mitochondrion|Mitochondria]] are components in eukaryotic [[cell (biology)|cells]] that are important for energy production. They contain their own genetic material, and mutations to their DNA can affect a cell's ability to function properly. Indirectly, these mutations may accelerate many aspects of aging.
#Junk – inside of cells, aka intracellular aggregates:
#:Cells are constantly breaking down [[protein]]s and other molecules that are no longer useful or which can be harmful. Those molecules which can't be digested simply accumulate as junk inside of cells. [[Atherosclerosis]], [[macular degeneration]] and many kinds of [[neurodegenerative disease]]s (such as Alzheimer's) are associated with this problem.
#Junk – outside of cells, aka extracellular aggregates:
#:Harmful junk protein can also accumulate outside of cells. The amyloid [[senile plaque]] seen in the brains of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer's]] patients is one example.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PTN interviews Dr. Aubrey de Grey, researcher of anti-aging regenerative medicine|
url=http://www.planettechnews.com/interviews/ptn-interviews-dr-aubrey-de-grey-researcher-and-a-thought-leader-in-anti-aging-regenerative-medicine|publisher=[[PlanetTech]] News|accessdate=3 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Cells – too few, aka cellular loss:
#:Some of the cells in bodies cannot be replaced, or can be replaced only very slowly – more slowly than they die. This decrease in cell number causes the heart to become weaker with age, causes [[Parkinson's disease]], and impairs the [[immune system]].
#Cells – too many, aka [[cellular senescence]]:
#:This is a phenomenon where some cells can no longer [[cell division|divide]], but also do not die and let others divide. They may also do other things that they're not supposed to, like secreting proteins that may be harmful. Cell senescence has been proposed as cause or consequence of [[diabetes mellitus type 2]].&lt;ref name="Testa_Ceriello"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pathogenetic Loop Between Diabetes and Cell Senescence|journal=Diabetes Care|year=2007|first=Roberto|last=Testa|author2=Antonio Ceriello|volume=30|issue=11|pages=2974–2975|id= |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/30/11/2974.full|format=|accessdate=29 December 2012|doi=10.2337/dc07-1534|pmid=17965314}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immune senescence is also caused by this.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}
#Extracellular protein crosslinks:
#:Cells are held together by special linking proteins. When too many cross-links form between cells in a [[Biological tissue|tissue]], the tissue can lose its elasticity and cause problems including [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[presbyopia]].&lt;ref name="050411_aubrey_interview.html"&gt;[http://www.livescience.com/6967-hang-25-year-wait-immortality.html Hang in There: The 25-Year Wait for Immortality] interview with LiveScience&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="deGrey GSP2009"&gt;{{cite video |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HTMNfU7zftQ&amp;t=20m2s |title=Aubrey de Grey – In Pursuit of Longevity |publisher=[[Singularity University]] |date=22 February 2010 |people=Aubrey de Grey}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cryonics===
De Grey is also a cryonicist, having signed up with [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Aubrey de Grey, PHD, An Exclusive Interview with the Renowned Biogerontologist |url= http://www.lifeextension.com/magazine/2006/2/profile/Page-01 |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has supported and advocated human cryopreservation, for example by signing an open letter to support research into cryonics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= Scientists Open Letter on Cryonics |url= http://www.evidencebasedcryonics.org/scientists-open-letter-on-cryonics/ |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by being an advisor to a UK cryonics and cryopreservation advocacy group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title= List of Advisors |url= http://www.cryonics-research.org.uk/about-us.html |accessdate= 2016-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8 2018 de Grey posted a paper to the [[arXiv]] explicitly constructing a unit-distance graph which cannot be colored with fewer than 5 colors. The previous lower bound is due to the [[Hadwiger–Nelson problem|problem's]] original proposal in 1950 by [[Hugo Hadwiger]] and [[Edward Nelson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

==Criticism==

===''Technology Review'' debate===
In 2005, ''[[MIT Technology Review]]'', in cooperation with the Methuselah Foundation, announced a $20,000 prize for any molecular biologist who could demonstrate that SENS was "so wrong that it is unworthy of learned debate." The judges of the challenge were [[Rodney Brooks]], [[Anita Goel]], [[Vikram Sheel Kumar]], [[Nathan Myhrvold]], and [[Craig Venter]]. Five submissions were made, of which three met the terms of the challenge. De Grey wrote a rebuttal to each submission, and the challengers wrote responses to each rebuttal. The judges concluded that none of the challengers had disproved SENS, but the magazine opined that one of the rebuttals had been particularly eloquent and well written, and awarded the contestant $10,000. The judges also noted "the proponents of SENS have not made a compelling case for SENS," and wrote that many of its proposals could not be verified with the current level of scientific knowledge and technology, concluding that "SENS does not compel the assent of many knowledgeable scientists; but neither is it demonstrably wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologyreview.com/sens/|title=Is Defeating Aging Only a Dream?|publisher=Technology Review|accessdate=23 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critics single out three proposed therapies for criticism: somatic telomerase deletion, somatic mitochondrial genome engineering, and the use of transgenic microbial hydrolase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.technologyreview.com/sens/docs/estepetal.pdf|title=Life Extension Pseudoscience and the SENS Plan|publisher=Technology Review}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===EMBO Reports===
A 2005 article about SENS published in the viewpoint section of ''[[EMBO Reports]]'' by 28 scientists concluded that none of de Grey's therapies "has ever been shown to extend the lifespan of any organism, let alone humans".&lt;ref name=EMBOSENS&gt;{{Cite journal |first1=H. |last1=Warner |first2=J. |last2=Anderson |first3=S. |last3=Austad |first4=E. |last4=Bergamini |first5=D. |last5=Bredesen |first6=R. |last6=Butler |first7=B.

&lt;/ref&gt; The SENS Research Foundation, of which de Grey was a cofounder, seems to agree with the EMBO Report as it states, "If you want to reverse the damage of aging right now I'm afraid the simple answer is, you can't."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sens.org/sens-research/faq|title=SENS Research Foundation FAQ|publisher=SENS Research Foundation|accessdate=26 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, de Grey argues that this reveals a serious gap in understanding between basic scientists and technologists and between biologists studying aging and those studying regenerative medicine.&lt;ref name=EMBOSENSREPLY&gt;{{Cite journal

The '''Baldin Collection''' is a group of 364 [[masterpiece]]s removed from Germany to the Soviet Union by Russian Army officer Victor Baldin at the end of [[World War II]]. The ensemble consists of 362 drawings and 2 paintings by [[Dürer]], [[van Gogh]], [[Manet]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Rubens]], [[Titian]] and other famous artists. Historically part of the collection at the [[Kunsthalle Bremen]], the Baldin group came from a much larger cache of artworks stored by the Germans in a [[Brandenburg]] castle to protect it from [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|air raids]]. In 1945 the castle was occupied by the [[Red Army]] and the storage vaults were looted, mainly by Russian soldiers but also by the local German population. The works Baldin took were then hidden at a Soviet Research Institute for many years. In 1991 the collection was moved to the [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[Saint Petersburg]] where its existence was revealed to the world in 1992. It remains there today.

Since then the Baldin Collection has been regarded as [[looted art]] and is the subject of fierce debate among experts, between [[Germany]] and [[Russia]], and among politicians inside Russia itself. While Victor Baldin did steal the works, he is also credited with having saved them from destruction. For decades he appealed to senior officials, including Soviet leaders [[Leonid Brezhnev]] and [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], to get them returned to Germany. In 1989 Baldin even traveled to [[Bremen]], [[West Germany]], to reveal the existence of the secret collection to the Kunsthalle. In the 1990s the government of [[Boris Yeltsin]] finally agreed to return the works, but subsequent Russian governments have blocked such plans. Today the Collection has been called "of singular importance to the entire issue of trophy art" by the Russians&lt;ref&gt;Interview of Mikhail Borisovich Piotrovsky, State Hermitage Museum Director: Interview in ''The Gazette'' 12 March 2003 Moscow [http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/02/hm2_6_0_3.html English summary at the website of the State Hermitage Museum]. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050206130013/http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/02/hm2_6_0_3.html|date=6 February 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "[[cause célèbre]] of German-Russian Restitution Politics" by those who support its return.&lt;ref name = akinsha&gt;{{cite journal|doi= 10.1017/S0940739110000111|title=Why Can't Private Art "Trophies" Go Home from the War?|year=2010|last1=Akinsha|first1=Konstantin|journal=International Journal of Cultural Property|volume=17|issue=27|pages=257–290}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

=== Kunsthalle Bremen Collection ===
[[File:Kunsthalle-HB 20110824 img-01.jpg|thumb|330px|The [[Kunsthalle Bremen|Kunsthalle]] in [[Bremen]], Germany]]
At the outbreak of [[World War II]] in 1939, the Bremen Art Museum (German: ''[[Kunsthalle Bremen]]'') was closed and its priceless paintings, drawings, prints, and sculpture were stored in the basement. [[Bremen]], an important manufacturing center, became an early target for [[Bombing of Bremen in World War II|Allied strategic bombing]]. On the night of 5 September 1942, a fire bomb destroyed the central staircase and six gallery rooms of the museum. It also burned a version of [[Emanuel Leutze]]'s famous painting ''[[Washington Crossing the Delaware]]'', which because of its size could not be moved. After this damage, the Kunsthalle collections were moved to more secure storage in various bank vaults underneath Bremen. In 1943, as bombing intensified, Bremen's mayor decreed that the museum's collections be moved to safety outside the city. The collection was divided up between four castles in Germany. A set of 50 paintings, 1715 drawings and 3000 prints were moved to Schloss Karnzow, the hunting lodge of Count von Königsmarck, near the small town of [[Kyritz]] north of [[Berlin]] in the [[Province of Brandenburg]].&lt;ref name = kunsthalle&gt;Kunsthalle Bremen: ''Geschichte 1914–1945'' [http://www.kunsthalle-bremen.de/kunsthalle/ueber-uns/geschichte/emil-waldmann-1914-1945/ online] {{icon de}} retrieved 3 June 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Karnzow Castle and Victor Baldin, 1945 ===
[[File:Albrecht Durer, "Woman's Bath".jpg|thumb|''Frauenbad'' by [[Albrecht Dürer]] (1496). Not part of the Baldin Collection itself, but taken by the same military unit from the same storage vaults at Karnzow Castle&lt;ref name = duerer/&gt;]]
After Germany's defeat, [[Brandenburg]] and specifically the area around Karnzow Castle was occupied by the [[Red Army]]. On 29 May 1945 soldiers and officers of the 38th Field Engineers' Brigade billeted at the Castle began looting it.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt; Victor Baldin, an Army captain and combat engineer, found opened boxes in the cellar, saw documents trampled on the floor, and observed soldiers lighting their way by using burning papers. Baldin, an art restorer before the war, recognized these as drawings by the great masters.&lt;ref name = novosti&gt;"Baldin's Collection and Restitution Problems" in: ''Russian News &amp; Information Agency RIA Novosti'' 8 December 2005 [http://en.rian.ru/analysis/20051208/42393080.html online version] {{en icon}} retrieved 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Baldin intervened and sealed the cellar. Scrutinizing the treasures lying about, he found works by [[Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot|Corot]], [[Eugène Delacroix|Delacroix]], [[Degas]], [[Dürer]], [[Anthony van Dyck|Van Dyke]], [[Van Gogh]], [[Goya]], [[Manet]], [[Raphael]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Auguste Rodin|Rodin]], [[Rubens]], [[Toulouse-Lautrec]], and [[Titian]].&lt;ref name=dolinina&gt;Kira Dolinina and Maia Stravinskaya: [https://web.archive.org/web/20070930184500/http://www.kommersant.com/p549322/r_1/Ministry_of_Culture_Won_t_Give_Back_What_Doesn_t_Belong_to_It/ "Ministry of Culture Won't Give Back What Doesn't Belong to It"].

Baldin became determined to save what he could. He later said "I started in on the beautiful things, then I saw it was all beautiful."&lt;ref name = latimes/&gt; He took drawings away from soldiers by force, by deception and in exchange for personal items.&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; In one case, it took him three days to obtain a drawing of Christ's head by [[Albrecht Dürer]] from another officer. Baldin managed to coax the officer into exchanging it for his chrome boots.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt; Of the thousands of works stored in the cellar, Baldin managed to save just 362 drawings and 2 paintings. Among them was the only known pen and ink study  by [[van Gogh]] of his famous painting, ''[[Starry Night]]''&lt;ref name = latimes/&gt; As the Soviet Army withdrew, the cellars were left open and what little remained of the collection was lost to local looters and the weather.&lt;ref name = kunsthalle/&gt;

Baldin's actions and motives are still debated today. He did indeed cut the drawings from their mounts, put them into a suitcase, carry them to Russia and hide them in his apartment. However, while at the castle Baldin also wrote down descriptions of every work he saw, copied the German signatures and labels, and later carefully documented their [[provenance]]. He also begged for an official military transport so the collection could be handled more securely, but none were available, and his request was denied.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Hughes, Constance Richards, Rhea Schoenthal: "Spoils of War": ''Time Magazine'', 3 April 1995 [http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,982773,00.html abstract online] retrieved 2 June 2012&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, it is generally agreed that Baldin's efforts rescued priceless [[masterpiece]]s from outright destruction. In addition, because of his specialized art knowledge, what would become known as the "Baldin Collection" became the most important part of the Kunsthalle collection remaining from Schloss Karnzow.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

In contrast to Baldin's efforts, works looted by Baldin's comrades from Karnzow have been found as far afield as [[Azerbaijan]] and in varying states of decay. In the late 1990s eight disputed drawings, including the world-famous ''Frauenbad'' ("Women's Bathhouse") by Albrecht Dürer, were seized by [[United States Customs]] in an incident of [[black market]] trading.&lt;ref name = duerer&gt;Jo Ann Lewis, "Duerer, Drawing a Hot Bath" in: ''The Washington Post'', 26 October 1997, at G9&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Constance Lowenthal, ''U.S. Customs Recovers Old Masters Drawings'', IFAR Report, Oct. 1997, at 4&lt;/ref&gt; Today over 1,500 items from the Kunsthalle collection that were stored at Karnzow remain missing.&lt;ref name = clark/&gt;

=== Postwar period, 1946–1990 ===
After their return home, some of the officers who had participated in the looting at Karnzow donated their pieces to museums around the [[Soviet Union]]. In 1948 Baldin deposited his at the A. V. Shchusev State Scientific Research Museum of Architecture in [[Moscow]], where the masterpieces became a Soviet state secret.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt; Baldin worked as an art restorer at the museum and eventually became its general director in 1963, a post he held for 25 years.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

Baldin then tried for decades to give the stolen art back to Germany. He took the courageous steps of writing to Soviet leader [[Leonid Brezhnev]] in 1973, to the chief ideologist of the Communist Party [[Yegor Ligachev]] in 1987, and many other Soviet political and cultural officials including [[Mikhail Suslov]], [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], and [[Raisa Gorbachev]]&amp;nbsp;– all to no avail.&lt;ref name=ingram/&gt; In 1989, during the period of increased transparency in the Soviet Union known as [[perestroika]], Baldin took another unprecedented step. He traveled to Bremen, [[West Germany]], and met with the director of the Kunsthalle, Dr Siegfried Salzmann. The director was shocked to learn that important parts of the long lost collection had survived. With hands shaking, he read the list of the missing masterpieces that Baldin had prepared years before. Baldin had put pencil marks next to those works he had personally rescued. He has since been called the "hero of the story."&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt;

=== Post-Soviet period, 1991–2000 ===
In 1991, Baldin wrote to Russian President [[Boris Yeltsin]] and finally received his first reply, in which the president agreed it would be politically correct to return the works to Germany.&lt;ref name = novosti/&gt; However, that same year nationalist elements in the Russian government hurriedly transferred the collection to the State [[Hermitage Museum]] in [[St. Petersburg]] in a cover-up attempt.&lt;ref name=dolinina/&gt; As of 2012 it is still unclear if one of the most famous works in the collection, ''Cypresses in [[Starry Night]]'' (1889) by Van Gogh, is at the Hermitage or remains in Moscow.&lt;ref name = clark/&gt;

In legal proceedings and political debates during the following years it appeared that collection might return to its rightful owner.&lt;ref&gt;Jo Ann Lewis. "World War II German Art Hoard To Be Returned by Soviets; 360 Master Drawings Taken for Safekeeping" in: ''The Washington Post''. 16 August 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, a group of 101 pieces from another part of Baldin's brigade, including Albrecht Duerers' 1494 watercolor ''View of a Rock Castle by a River'', were returned to the Kunsthalle by Russia. This was followed by the simultaneous return of two artifacts of the [[Amber Room]], bought and financed by a Bremen businessman to speed up the process.&lt;ref name=finnbremen&gt;Peter Finn: "Bremen Basks In Return of Art Looted by Soviet Army" in: ''The Washington Post''. 24 November 2000, A Section&lt;/ref&gt; Anatoly Vilkov, from the Russian ministry of culture, stated that "Russia has no right to keep the Baldin collection. We did not receive this right through a gift, since by law the collection did not belong to the donor Baldin."&lt;ref name = schossig&gt;Rainer B.

=== Latest disputes, 2003–present ===
[[File:Gubenko NN.jpg|thumb|[[Nikolai Gubenko]] in 2005]]
The potential return of the collection to Germany began to face increasing opposition from Russian nationalist leaders, including [[Communist]] legislator and former Culture Minister of the USSR [[Nikolai Gubenko]]. Gubenko had been one of those involved in the 1991 transfer of the art to the Hermitage to hide it.&lt;ref name=ingram/&gt; The State [[Duma]], which included Gubenko as a member,&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; passed a non-binding resolution on 12 March 2003 asking President [[Vladimir Putin]] to prevent the Culture Ministry from returning the Baldin Collection.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20030503040021/http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2003/03/130303.asp "Duma Calls for Go-Slow Approach on Trophy Art"] ''Radio Free Europe Newsline'' 13 March 2003. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930063953/http://www.rferl.org/newsline/2003/03/130303.asp|date=30 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian Culture Minister Mikhail Shvydkoy opposed these moves to keep the collection in Russia; he regarded it as illegal loot based on a 1998 law that protected only those artworks from World War II taken by official Soviet trophy brigades and not private citizens. In 2003 he confirmed an order by the Russian General Prosecutor confirming a resolution of the [[Hanse]] Supreme court, which had decided the entire 364 remaining items were the official property of the Bremen Kunsthalle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newsfromrussia.com/culture/2003/04/07/45701_.html "Russian Minister of Culture: Return of 'Baldin Collection' to Germany is Legally Relevant"].

As of 2010, it appeared that the collection would not be returning to Germany any time soon.&lt;ref name = akinsha/&gt;

== Legacy ==
According to a 2005 interview with Baldin's widow Julia Siwakowa, it was always his wish that the looted art be returned to the Kunsthalle. Baldin's last will stated: "The collection belongs to humankind, not only Germany, and as the collection was located at the Kunsthalle Bremen, it must be returned to this place."&lt;ref name=dieweltes/&gt; The history of Victor Baldin, the stolen paintings and their odyssey is featured in the 2007 book ''Victor Baldin&amp;nbsp;– The Man with the Suitcase/Victor Baldin&amp;nbsp;– Der Mann mit dem Koffer''.&lt;ref name = schossig/&gt;

'''Caleb Carr''' (1616 - 17 December 1695)&lt;ref name="austin,37"&gt;Austin, 37&lt;/ref&gt; was a governor of the [[Colony of Rhode Island and Providence Plantations]], serving a very short term prior to his death.  In 1635, at the age of 19, he sailed from England on the ship ''Elizabeth and Ann'' with his older brother Robert.&lt;ref name="austin,37"&gt;Austin, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  Carr's name appears on a list of Newport freemen in 1655, and he began serving in a civil capacity the year prior when he became a commissioner.  He served in this capacity for a total of six years between 1654 and 1662, and then served as deputy for 12 years from 1664 to 1690.  During the years when he wasn't serving as deputy, he was an assistant, serving in this role for a total of ten years.&lt;ref name="austin,37"&gt;Austin, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1677 to 1678 he was the justice of the General Quarter Session and Inferior Court of Common Pleas.

Between 1658 and 1663 Carr purchased several large tracts of land on [[Conanicut Island]] (later becoming Jamestown), and following his death he willed this property to his sons.&lt;ref name="austin,37"&gt;Austin, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  He owned a boat, and in 1671 he was paid four pounds for services rendered with the craft.&lt;ref name="austin,37"&gt;Austin, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1676 he bought the services of an Indian captive, for which he paid 12 bushels of Indian corn.&lt;ref name="austin,37"&gt;Austin, 37&lt;/ref&gt;

Carr became governor of the colony in 1695, and in this capacity he wrote to Governor Fletcher of New York in answer to a request for 48 men from Rhode Island to assist in the defense of New York.  He agreed to either send the men, or some comparable assistance.&lt;ref name="austin,37"&gt;Austin, 37&lt;/ref&gt;  Carr died late in 1695 and was buried in a family cemetery in Newport.  He was succeeded as governor by [[Walter Clarke (governor)|Walter Clarke]].

Carr had 13 children, nine with his first wife, Mercy (three died young), and four with his second wife, Sarah Clarke.  His second wife was the widow of John Pinner and a daughter of [[Frances Latham]] and former colonial President [[Jeremy Clarke (governor)|Jeremy Clarke]].

San Marino is one of only two countries in the world to have carried out no executions since prior to 1800 (the other is [[Capital punishment in Liechtenstein|Liechtenstein]], where the last execution took place in 1785).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/act50/012/2007/en/ "Death Penalty Statistics 2006"], [[Amnesty International]]&lt;/ref&gt;

San Marino was the first country in the world to abolish the death penalty for ordinary crimes, in 1848. In 1865, it became the second country in the world (and the first in [[Europe]]) to abolish the death penalty for all crimes, following [[Capital punishment in Venezuela|Venezuela]] in 1863.&lt;ref&gt;''Determinants of the death penalty: a comparative study of the world'', Carsten Anckar, Routledge, 2004, {{ISBN|0-415-33398-9}}, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; It is one of only three countries to have abolished the death penalty for all crimes before 1900 (the third one being [[Costa Rica]]).&lt;ref&gt;''Death Penalty: Beyond Abolition'', [[Council of Europe]], 2004, {{ISBN|92-871-5332-9}}, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/courier/1999_10/uk/ethique/txt1.htm "THE DEATH PENALTY: ABOLITION GAINS GROUND"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100307215220/http://www.unesco.org/courier/1999_10/uk/ethique/txt1.htm |date=March 7, 2010 }}, Martine Jacot, ''UNESCO Courier'', October 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chandra Ann Levy''' (April 14, 1977&amp;nbsp;– {{circa}} May 1, 2001) was an American [[Internship|intern]] at the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], who disappeared in May 2001. She was presumed murdered after her skeletal remains were found in [[Rock Creek Park]] in May 2002. The case attracted attention from the American news media for several years.

Due to a miscommunication, the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] (MPD) failed to follow its own search parameters in Rock Creek Park, leaving Levy's body to decompose for a year. Further, the MPD had been informed, but soon dismissed the information, that [[#Identification of the prime suspect|Ingmar Guandique]], already arrested for attacking women in Rock Creek Park, had confessed to attacking Levy. The MPD instead put much of its focus on the revelation that Levy had been having an [[Affair#Extramarital affair|affair]] with [[U.S. Representative|Congressman]] [[Gary Condit]], a married [[United States Democratic Party|Democrat]] then serving his fifth term representing [[California's 18th congressional district]], and a senior member of the [[House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence]]. Condit had an overwhelming alibi (he was in meetings with the Vice President), was never named as a suspect by police, and was eventually cleared of any involvement in the disappearance. However, due to the cloud of suspicion raised by the intense media focus on the missing intern and the later revelation of the affair, Condit lost his bid for re-election in 2002.

Following a series of investigative reports by the ''[[Washington Post]]'' in 2008, the MPD followed up and finally obtained a warrant, on March 3, 2009, to arrest Ingmar Guandique, the [[illegal immigrant]]  from [[El Salvador]] identified and dismissed by the MPDC eight years earlier.&lt;!-- Please see discussion page regarding terminology. "Undocumented Immigrant" refers to the Wikipedia page "Illegal immigration. The page itself is referred to as illegal immigration so the term "illegal immigrant" is proper. The discussion on the discussion page reaffirms the use of this term. --&gt; He had been convicted of assaulting two other women in Rock Creek Park around the time of Levy's disappearance and was still in prison on those convictions when the arrest warrant on Levy's death was issued. Prosecutors alleged that Guandique had attacked and tied up Levy in a remote area of the park and left her to die of dehydration or exposure. In November 2010, Guandique was convicted of murdering Levy; he was sentenced in February 2011 to 60 years in prison. In June 2015, however, Guandique was granted a new trial.  On July 28, 2016, prosecutors announced that they would not proceed with the case against Guandique and would, instead, seek to have him deported.

Levy was born in [[Cleveland]], Ohio, to Robert and Susan Levy; the family moved to [[Modesto, California]], where she attended [[Grace M. Davis High School]]. Her parents are members of Congregation Beth Shalom, a [[Conservative Judaism|Conservative Jewish]] synagogue.&lt;ref name="JJ"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jewishjournal.com/world/article/chandra_levys_jewish_angle_20010720/ |title=Chandra Levy's Jewish Angle |first=James D. |last=Besser |date=July 20, 2001 |work=[[The Jewish Journal of Greater Los Angeles]]|accessdate=December 18, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[San Francisco State University]], where she earned a degree in journalism. After interning for the California Bureau of Secondary Education and working in the office of [[Mayor of Los Angeles|Los Angeles Mayor]] [[Richard Riordan]], she began attending the [[University of Southern California]] to earn a master's degree in [[public administration]].&lt;ref name="WP02-Gentleman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Sari|author2=Higham, Scott |author3=Moreno, Sylvia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/chandra/ch2_1.html|title=Who Killed Chandra Levy?, Chapter Two: The Gentleman from Ca.| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |pages=1–2|date=July 13, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of her final semester of study, Levy moved to Washington, D.C., to become a paid intern with the [[Federal Bureau of Prisons]].&lt;ref name="WP02-Gentleman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Finding-Chandra-2010-p24"&gt;{{cite book|last=Higham|first=Scott|author2=Horwitz, Sari|title=Finding Chandra: A True Washington Murder Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqYWcu-pba0C&amp;pg=PA24|pages=24–25|isbn=978-1-4391-3867-0|oclc= 430842090|publisher=Scribner|location=New York City|year=2010|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2000 she began her internship at the bureau's headquarters,&lt;ref name="USAToday-20020522"&gt;{{cite news|title=Chandra Levy mystery: A timeline|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/july01/2001-07-05-levy-timeline.htm|newspaper=[[USA Today]]|date=May 22, 2002|accessdate=November 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was assigned to the public affairs division.&lt;ref name="SFChronicle-20020428"&gt;{{cite news|last=Fagan|first=Kevin|title=A Life Suspended: A year after Chandra Levy vanished, her family and friends struggle to absorb the passage of time – and hope|url=http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-04-28/news/17540156_1_susan-levy-chandra-levy-rep-gary-condit/3|newspaper=[[San Francisco Chronicle]]|date=April 28, 2002|accessdate=November 19, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716050303/http://articles.sfgate.com/2002-04-28/news/17540156_1_susan-levy-chandra-levy-rep-gary-condit/3|archivedate=July 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her supervisor, bureau spokesperson Dan Dunne, was impressed with Levy's work, especially her handling of media inquiries regarding the upcoming execution of [[Timothy McVeigh]], convicted of bombing the Oklahoma City Federal Building.&lt;ref name="Finding-Chandra-2010-p24"/&gt; Levy's internship was abruptly terminated in April 2001 because her academic eligibility was found to have expired in December 2000.

==Murder case==

===Disappearance and search===
Levy was last seen on May 1, 2001. The [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] was first alerted on May 6, when Levy's parents called from Modesto to report that they had not heard from their daughter in five days. Police called hospitals and visited Levy's apartment in Dupont Circle that day, finding no indication of foul play. On May 7, Levy's father told the police that his daughter had been having an affair with a U.S. congressman, and said the next day that he believed the congressman to be [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. Representative]] [[Gary Condit]]. Levy's aunt also called the police and told them that Chandra had confided in her about the affair. Police obtained a warrant on May 10 to conduct a formal search of Levy's apartment. Investigators found her credit cards, identification and mobile phone left behind in her purse, along with partially packed suitcases. The answering machine was full, with messages left by her relatives and two from Condit. A police sergeant tried to examine Levy's laptop computer and inadvertently corrupted the internet search data, as he was not a trained technician.&lt;ref name="WP01-Disappears"&gt;{{cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Sari|author2=Higham, Scott |author3=Moreno, Sylvia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/chandra/ch1_1.html|title=Who Killed Chandra Levy?, Chapter One: A Young Woman Disappears| newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |pages=1–3|date=July 13, 2008|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Computer experts took a month to reconstruct the data to determine that the laptop was used on the morning of May 1 to search for websites related to [[Amtrak]], [[Baskin-Robbins]], Condit, [[Southwest Airlines]], and a weather report from ''[[The Washington Post]]''. Her final search at 12:59&amp;nbsp;p.m. was for [[Alsace-Lorraine]], a province in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/crime/article24598267.html |title=Levy searched Internet about park, Condit, FBI agent testifies |last=Doyle |first=Michael |date=October 28, 2010 |newspaper=McClatchy Newspapers }}&lt;/ref&gt; A particular search at 11:33&amp;nbsp;a.m. was for information about Rock Creek Park in ''The Washington Post'' "Entertainment Guide," then at 11:34 she clicked a link to bring up a map of the park. Detectives later theorized that she might have met someone at the [[Pierce-Klingle Mansion]] which houses the park headquarters.&lt;ref name="WP01-Disappears"/&gt; On July 25, 2001, three D.C. police sergeants and 28 police cadets searched along Glover Road in the park but failed to find evidence related to Levy. Later, a second attempt found nothing.&lt;ref name="WP01-Disappears"/&gt;

In a nationwide Fox News/Opinion Dynamics poll of 900 registered voters conducted in July 2001, 44 percent of American respondents thought that Condit was involved in Levy's disappearance and 27 percent felt that he should resign.

===Discovery of remains===

On May 22, 2002, around 9:30&amp;nbsp;a.m., skeletal remains matching Levy's [[Forensic dentistry|dental records]] were discovered by a man walking his dog and looking for turtles in Rock Creek Park, near Broad Branch Creek.&lt;ref name="Braun"&gt;{{cite news |last=Braun|first=Stephen |date=May 23, 2002|title=Remains in D.C.

Although police had previously searched over half the 1,754-acre main section of the park (2.74&amp;nbsp;mi&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, 7.10&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), the wooded slope where Levy's remains were eventually found had not been searched. Police commanders ordered the search perimeters to 100 yards of each road and trail but a miscommunication had the officers only searching within 100 yards of every road. The remains were found about four miles &lt;!-- It's 3.7 miles by foot --&gt; (6&amp;nbsp;km) from Levy's apartment.

After a preliminary [[autopsy]] was performed, District of Columbia police announced that there was sufficient evidence to open a homicide investigation. On May 28, D.C. medical examiner Jonathan L. Arden officially declared Levy's death a homicide, but said, "There's less to work with here than I would like. It's possible we will never know specifically how she died."&lt;ref name="CourtTV-20020528"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0528/levy_ap.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080429000151/http://www.courttv.com/archive/news/2002/0528/levy_ap.html |title=Coroner says Chandra Levy was murdered|publisher=[[CourtTV]]|agency=[[Associated Press]]|archivedate=April 29, 2008|date=May 28, 2002|accessdate=August 9, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arden found damage to her [[hyoid]] bone, suggesting possible strangulation, but did not deem it to be conclusive evidence of such a cause of death.&lt;ref name="CNN-20020713"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.cnn.com/2002-07-13/us/levy.medical.examiner_1_chandra-levy-rock-creek-park-bone |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130119130614/http://articles.cnn.com/2002-07-13/us/levy.medical.examiner_1_chandra-levy-rock-creek-park-bone |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 19, 2013 |publisher=CNN |title=Report: Levy may have been strangled |date=July 13, 2002 |accessdate=November 25, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 6, after the police completed their search, private investigators hired by the Levys found her shin bone with some twisted wire about {{convert|25|yards|m}} from the other remains.

===Identification of the prime suspect===
In September 2001, D.C. police and federal prosecutors were contacted by the lawyer of an informant, held in a [[D.C. Jail|D.C. jail]], who claimed to have knowledge of Levy's killer. The informant, whose identity was protected for his safety, said that Ingmar Guandique, a 20-year-old illegal immigrant from El Salvador also being held in the jail, told him that Condit paid him $25,000 to kill Levy. Investigators ruled out the story about Condit, because Guandique had already admitted to assaulting two other women in the same park where Levy's remains were found.&lt;ref name="WP10-Informant"/&gt; Guandique failed to show up for work on the day of Levy's disappearance.&lt;ref name="WP06-Predator"&gt;{{cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Sari|author2=Higham, Scott |author3=Moreno, Sylvia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/chandra/ch6_1.html|title=Who Killed Chandra Levy?, Chapter Six: The Predator in the Park|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 18, 2008|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; His former landlady recalled that his face appeared scratched and bruised at around that time.&lt;ref name="WP-20101128"&gt;{{cite news|last=Higham|first=Scott|author2=Horwitz, Sari|title=Even after Ingmar Guandique's conviction, the Chandra Levy saga is all about Gary Condit|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/11/24/AR2010112404515.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|pages=1–2|date=November 28, 2010|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The investigators on the Levy case did not interview the other Rock Creek Park victims.&lt;ref name="WP-20090304-warrant"&gt;{{cite news|last=Higham|first=Scott|author2=Horwitz, Sari|title=Warrant Is Issued for Suspect in Levy Killing|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/03/AR2009030301967.html|newspaper=The Washington Post|pages=1–2|date=March 4, 2009|accessdate=December 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police chief Ramsey avoided calling Guandique a suspect and described him as a "[[person of interest]]",&lt;ref name="NYTimes-20021008"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/10/08/us/a-2nd-look-by-officers-in-intern-case.html|title=A 2nd Look By Officers In Intern Case|newspaper=The New York Times|date=October 8, 2002|accessdate=November 24, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; telling reporters not to make "too big a deal" about him.

A polygraph test on Guandique, administered on February 4, 2002, returned inconclusive results that were officially ruled "not deceptive".

The Levy homicide remained listed as a "[[cold case]]" until 2006, when [[Cathy L. Lanier]] succeeded Ramsey as D.C. police chief. Lanier replaced the lead detective on the case with three veteran investigators who had more homicide experience.&lt;ref name="WP-20090304-warrant"/&gt; In 2007, the editors of ''The Washington Post'' assigned a new team of reporters to take a year to re-examine the Levy case.&lt;ref name="WP-20101128"/&gt; The resulting series of articles, published during the summer of 2008, focused on the past failure of the police to fully investigate Guandique's connection to the attacks in Rock Creek Park. In September 2008, investigators searched Guandique's federal prison cell in California and found a photo of Levy that he had saved from a magazine. Police interviewed acquaintances of Guandique and witnesses of the other Rock Creek Park incidents.&lt;ref name="WP-20090304-warrant"/&gt;

On October 26, 2010, Levy's then-64-year-old father, Robert, took the stand and refuted statements about his past suspicions of Condit. Robert Levy testified that he told authorities during the early years of the investigation that his daughter Chandra would have been too cautious to jog in the woods alone, but said that he no longer believed this to be true. He said that he also told police that his daughter and Condit had a five-year plan between them to get married. In retrospect, Robert Levy admitted: "I just said whatever came to mind just to point to him as the villain." Levy added that he had been convinced that Condit was "guilty until we learned about this character here," referring to Guandique.&lt;ref name="WE-20101026-father"&gt;{{cite news|last=McCabe|first=Scott|title=Levy's Father testifies he pointed Investigators to Condit|url=http://dev.www.washingtonexaminer.com/local/blogs/capital-land/levys-father-testifies-he-pointed-investigators-to-condit-105806768.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Examiner]]|date=October 26, 2010|accessdate=February 21, 2011}}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 1, Condit testified at the trial and was asked on at least three occasions if he and Chandra Levy had been involved in a sexual relationship.

Alaniz admitted under [[cross-examination]] that he "didn't want to be too nosy" and was often asleep at the prison while recovering from a gunshot wound.

====Sentencing and appeals====
On February 1, 2011, Guandique's attorneys requested a [[new trial]] on the grounds that the verdict had been improperly attained. The 17-page filing claimed that the prosecutors had appealed to the emotions of the jury, using "references to facts not in evidence".&lt;ref name="NBCDC-20110202-trial"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gresko|first=Jessica|url=http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local-beat/Guandique-Wants-New-Trial-in-Levy-Slaying-115150324.html|title=Guandique Wants New Trial in Levy Slaying|agency=[[WRC-TV]]|date=February 2, 2011|accessdate=February 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The motion also alleged that one juror, who did not take notes, had breached the judge's instructions not to be "influenced by another juror's notes".&lt;ref name="NBCDC-20110202-trial"/&gt; The prosecution opposed a retrial, arguing that the issue regarding the notes was no more than a technicality that did not have a significant effect on the verdict.&lt;ref name="Fox-20110208"&gt;{{cite news|last=Levine|first=Mike|title=Prosecutors seek life term for Chandra Levy killer|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2011/02/08/prosecutors-seek-life-term-chandra-levy-killer/|publisher=Fox News Channel|agency=[[Associated Press]]|date=February 8, 2011|accessdate=February 8, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Judge Gerald Fisher reminded Susan Levy to address the court instead of the defendant, Levy said to him, "Did you really take her life? Look me in my eyes and tell me." Fisher denied Guandique's motion for retrial and handed down a sentence of 60 years in prison, stating that Guandique "will be a danger for some time.

On May 22, 2015, prosecutors dropped their opposition to a new trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = New trial possible in Chandra Levy killing - CNN.com|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/05/22/us/chandra-levy-case/index.html|website = CNN|accessdate = 2015-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This came largely due to defense claims that the prosecution's star witness, Armando Morales, had [[perjury|perjured]] himself on the stand.  The defense contended that prosecutors failed to disclose that Morales was a [[jailhouse informant]] with a reputation for being untrustworthy.  Morales had denied ever being an informant.

Babs Proller, the woman who made the recording, turned it over to the police.

The disappearance of Chandra Levy became a national topic of the news media in the summer of 2001,&lt;ref name="AJR-200109"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wenner|first=Kathryn S.|url=http://www.ajr.org/article.asp?id=2845|title=How the Chandra Levy Saga Took Off|journal=[[American Journalism Review]]|date=September 2001|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; with 63 percent of Americans closely following the case.&lt;ref name="WP09-Frenzy"/&gt; The media swamped Levy's parents from the moment they decided to go to Washington, D.C., in search of their daughter.&lt;ref name="Nieman-Harvard"&gt;{{cite web|last=Petersen|first=Kim|title=The Chandra Levy Story: What does media coverage look and feel like from the other side?|url=http://www.nieman.harvard.edu/reports/article/101639/The-Chandra-Levy-Story.aspx|publisher=[[Nieman Foundation for Journalism]]|date=Fall 2001|accessdate=November 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Condit, there were about a hundred reporters camped out in front of his apartment during the morning of September 11, 2001, but they all left after news spread about [[September 11 attacks|that day's terrorist attacks in New York and Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2010/nov/1/condit-mum-on-question-of-affair-with-intern-levy/?page=2|title=Condit mum on question of affair with Levy|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|first=Ben |last=Conery|date=November 1, 2010|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Media critics and cable news executives later cited the Levy case, as well as the concurrent [[sensationalism|sensationalist]] coverage of a string of [[shark attack]]s, as a reflection of the manner of news coverage in the United States before the September 11 attacks had taken priority.&lt;ref name="NYTimes-20020524-restraint"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rutenberg|first=Jim|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F01EEDB163BF937A15756C0A9649C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=sharks+chandra+levy&amp;st=nyt|title=Media Report: World Events Bring Restraint in Levy Case|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|page=A16|date=May 24, 2002|accessdate=July 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYTimes-20080711-sharks"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/dramatic-entrance-for-sharks/index.html|title=Like It’s the Summer of 2001: Sharks and Chandra|newspaper=New York Times|first=Mike|last=Nizza|date=July 11, 2008|accessdate=July 13, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080717042124/http://thelede.blogs.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/dramatic-entrance-for-sharks/index.html|archive-date=July 17, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, D.C. newspaper ''[[Roll Call]]'' first reported the possible connection of Ingmar Guandique to the case, with little effect on the news media's focus on Condit.&lt;ref name="WP-20101128"/&gt; Conservative commentator [[Michelle Malkin]] noted the lack of headlines that an illegal immigrant had been questioned in the Levy case. She said that in her review of 115 news items from the [[Lexis-Nexis]] database, not a single mention of Guandique referred to his status as a "criminal [[illegal immigration|illegal alien]]". She called the "glaring omission" of his status "a newsworthy act of negligence". She wrote that only the very conservative ''[[Human Events]]'' reported that the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] had approved his working legally while applying for [[temporary protected status]]. That application was ultimately denied, but not before he had assaulted two other women at Rock Creek Park.&lt;ref name="JWW-20020605-blinders"&gt;{{cite news|last=Malkin|first=Michelle|authorlink=Michelle Malkin|title=The media's immigration blinders|url=http://www.jewishworldreview.com/michelle/malkin0060502.asp|work=[[Jewish World Review]]|date=June 5, 2002|accessdate=November 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, investigative journalist [[Dominick Dunne]] said on ''[[Larry King Live]]'' that he believed Gary Condit knew more information about the Levy case than he had been disclosing. Condit filed two lawsuits against Dunne, forcing him into an undisclosed financial settlement on one of them. In 2008, U.S. District Judge [[Peter K. Leisure|Peter Leisure]] dismissed the other suit that alleged [[slander]], because "The context in which Dunne's statements were made demonstrates that they were part of a discussion about 'speculation' in the media and inaccurate media coverage."&lt;ref name="Reuters-20080709"/&gt;

During the summer of 2008, ''The Washington Post'' ran a 13-part series billed, in part, as "a tale of the tabloid and mainstream press pack journalism that helped derail the investigation". The two investigative reporters behind the ''Post'' series, [[Scott Higham]] and [[Sari Horwitz]], wrote a book detailing their investigation. The book, ''[[Finding Chandra]]'', was published in May 2010.&lt;ref name="Finding-Chandra-2010-piv"&gt;{{cite book|last=Higham|first=Scott|author2=Horwitz, Sari|title=Finding Chandra: A True Washington Murder Mystery|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CqYWcu-pba0C|page=iv|isbn=978-1-4391-3867-0|oclc= 430842090|publisher=Scribner|location=New York City|year=2010|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commentators, including ''The Washington Post'' Metro reporter Robert Pierre, wrote that emphasis on a glamorous white murder victim, when "about 200 people are killed in this city every year, most of them black and male", was "absolutely absurd and dare I say, racist, at its core".&lt;ref name="WP-20080727-series"&gt;{{cite news|title=A 13-Part Series to Love or Hate|first=Deborah|last=Howell|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 27, 2008|page=B06|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/07/25/AR2008072502758.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WCP-20080722"&gt;{{cite news|title=''Post'' Reporter Hopes Protesters March on ''Post'' Building over Chandra Series|first=Erik|last=Wemple|authorlink=Erik Wemple|newspaper=[[Washington City Paper]]|date=July 22, 2008|url=http://www.washingtoncitypaper.com/blogs/citydesk/2008/07/22/post-reporter-hopes-protesters-march-on-post-building-over-chandra-series/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media were criticized for their "rush to judgment" in suggesting, sometimes blatantly, that Condit was guilty of the murder, especially in the early days of the investigation.&lt;ref name="DK-20090222-better"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cohen|first=mark|title=With 20/20 Hindsight, Condit Story Was Better Than Truth|url=http://www.dailykos.com/story/2009/2/22/700629/-With-20-20-Hindsight,-Condit-Story-Was-Better-Than-Truth|publisher=[[Daily Kos]]|date=February 22, 2009|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LADN-20090222-rush"&gt;{{cite news|last=Perrier|first=Phil|title=Was There a Rush To Judgment?|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/WAS+THERE+A+RUSH+TO+JUDGMENT%3F-a0149874106|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Daily News]]|date=August 21, 2006|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the reporters camped in front of Condit's Washington apartment house were quoted as saying that they would remain there "until he resigns".&lt;ref name="RMA-20011001"&gt;{{cite news|title=Respect Mahh Authori-tay!!!|url=http://www.netcrucible.com/blog/2001/10/01/respect-mahh-authori-tay/|date=October 1, 2001|accessdate=August 28, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MRC-20010822"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bozell III |first=L.

On the 17th anniversary of the murder, Levy's mother continued to push for further investigation into her daughter's death. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.11alive.com/article/news/investigations/gone-cold/chandra-levys-mom-hopes-petition-will-spark-new-law-for-investigating-cold-cases/85-584824917&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==
Levy's death has had a lasting impact, due in part to the efforts of her family and friends. Levy's disappearance came after a number of other high-profile cases that led to the creation of resources for missing young adults. For example, Levy's parents quickly turned for help to the Carole Sund/Carrington Memorial Reward Foundation,&lt;ref name="WP04-Levys"/&gt; a nonprofit group that was established in Modesto after three female hikers disappeared from a 1999 trip to [[Yosemite National Park]] and were later found slain.&lt;ref name="Carole-Sund-Carrington-Foundation"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us {{!}} Carole Sund/Carrington Memorial Reward Foundation |url=http://www.carolesundfoundation.com/sections/about |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100826022709/http://www.carolesundfoundation.com/sections/about |accessdate=February 8, 2011 |archivedate=August 26, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; That foundation, which offered the Levys staff support and contributed towards a cash reward for information about Chandra's disappearance, was merged into the [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci &amp; Conner Search and Rescue Fund]] in 2009;&lt;ref name="ModBee-20090627"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jardine|first=Jeff|url=http://www.modbee.com/2009/06/26/761010/reward-group-will-dissolve-shift.html|title=Reward group will dissolve, shift its assets|newspaper=The Modesto Bee|date=June 27, 2009|accessdate=December 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616203941/http://www.modbee.com/2009/06/26/761010/reward-group-will-dissolve-shift.html|archivedate=June 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susan Levy had previously participated in the efforts to find [[Murder of Laci Peterson|Laci Peterson]], another missing woman from Modesto.&lt;ref name="WP-20030501-remains"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lengel|first=Allan|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/06/18/AR2008061801908.html|title=After Two Years, Levy Case Remains Open|newspaper=The Washington Post|pages=1–2|date=May 1, 2003|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, when [[Kristen Modafferi]] mysteriously disappeared from the [[San Francisco Bay Area]] just three weeks after her 18th birthday, her parents turned to their congresswoman for help they were ineligible to receive from the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]]. As a result, Congress enacted "Kristen's Law" in October 2000, which established the [[National Center for Missing Adults]] (NCMA) within the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Department of Justice]] to coordinate such missing person cases.&lt;ref name="NCMA-Kristens-Law"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theyaremissed.org/ncma/content.php?webid=kristens_law|title=Kristen's Law|publisher=National Center for Missing Adults|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the time Levy disappeared, institutions were in place to provide her family with support and to assist in a nationwide search to locate her. Although the Levy family moved quickly to mobilize all such available resources, including offering a cash reward for information, hiring their own investigators,&lt;ref name="WP05-Secret"&gt;{{cite news|last=Horwitz|first=Sari|author2=Higham, Scott |author3=Moreno, Sylvia |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/metro/specials/chandra/ch5_1.html|title=Who Killed Chandra Levy?, Chapter Five: A Secret Meeting|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=July 17, 2008|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeking media attention, those efforts to locate Chandra Levy or find her killer were overshadowed by the speculation surrounding her possible relationship with Condit. Susan Levy later joined with Donna Raley, the mother of another young woman who disappeared in 1999 from Modesto, to form "Wings of Protection", a support group for people with missing loved ones.&lt;ref name="ModBee-20071102"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.modbee.com/2003/02/18/110218_p2/under-their-wings.html|title=Under Their 'Wings'|newspaper=The Modesto Bee|date=November 2, 2007|accessdate=December 1, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110616204300/http://www.modbee.com/2003/02/18/110218_p2/under-their-wings.html|archivedate=June 16, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYDailyNews-20030101"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Helen|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/2003/01/01/2003-01-01_chandra_s_mom_offers_her_sym.html|title=Chandra's Mom Offers Her Sympathy|newspaper=New York Daily News|date=January 1, 2003|accessdate=December 3, 2010}} {{Dead link|date=April 2012|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.|Mary Ann Liebert]] company, publishers of the ''Journal of Women's Health and Gender-Based Medicine'', presented their annual Criterion Award in May 2002 to Susan Levy for her work with "Wings of Protection".&lt;ref name="BusinessWire-20020515"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/gi_0199-1673457/Susan-Levy-Mother-of-the.html|title=Susan Levy, Mother of the Missing Chandra Levy, to Receive Award From the Publisher of Journal of Women''s Health and Gender Based Medicine at 10th Annual Congress on Women''s Health|publisher=[[Business Wire]]|date=May 15, 2002|accessdate=December 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Newsweek]]'' magazine stated that the media may have become more skeptical of "[[herd mentality]]" and open to alternative suspects after the Levy case.&lt;ref name="Newsweek-20100518"&gt;{{cite news|last=Smalley|first=Suzanne|url=http://www.newsweek.com/2010/05/18/no-headline.html|title=Would Bloggers Have Cracked Chandra's Case?|journal=[[Newsweek]]|pages=1–2|date=May 18, 2010|accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The D.C. police claimed that they would have discovered Levy's body earlier, if not for a miscommunication regarding the scope of the search. Commanders had ordered a search within {{convert|100|yards|m}} of each road and trail in Rock Creek Park, but searches were focused within 100&amp;nbsp;yards of roads only, resulting in the body remaining undiscovered for a longer period of time.&lt;ref name="WP01-Disappears"/&gt; Both the Chief of Detectives, Jack Barrett, and the Chief of Police, Charles H.

[[File:CI types1s 2.jpg|thumb|460px|{{center|Types of collective intelligence}}]]
{{Recommender systems}}
'''Collective intelligence''' ('''CI''') is shared or group intelligence that [[Emergence|emerges]] from the [[collaboration]], collective efforts, and competition of many individuals and appears in [[consensus decision making]]. The term appears in [[sociobiology]], [[political science]] and in context of mass [[peer review]] and [[crowdsourcing]] applications. It may involve [[consensus]], [[social capital]] and formalisms such as [[voting systems]], [[social media]] and other means of quantifying mass activity.  Collective IQ is a measure of collective intelligence, although it is often used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Collective intelligence has also been attributed to [[bacteria]]&lt;ref name="Nguyen2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ngoc Thanh Nguyen|title=Transactions on Computational Collective Intelligence III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUxv25JFTkkC&amp;pg=PA63|accessdate=11 June 2013|date=25 July 2011|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-3-642-19967-7|page=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|63}} and animals.&lt;ref name="Nguyen2011"/&gt;{{rp|69}}

It can be understood as an [[emergent property]] from the [[synergies]] among: 1) data-[[information]]-knowledge; 2) software-hardware; and 3) experts (those with new insights as well as recognized authorities) that continually learns from feedback to produce just-in-time knowledge for better decisions than these three elements acting alone.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C. Collective Intelligence&amp;nbsp;– One of the Next Big Things, Futura 4/2009, Finnish Society for Futures Studies, Helsinki, Finland&lt;/ref&gt; Or more narrowly as an emergent property between people and ways of processing information.&lt;ref&gt;Glenn, Jerome C. Chapter 5, 2008 State of the Future. The Millennium Project, Washington, DC 2008&lt;/ref&gt; This notion of collective intelligence is referred to as "symbiotic intelligence" by Norman Lee Johnson.&lt;ref&gt;Norman Lee Johnson, [http://CollectiveScience.com Collective Science site]&lt;/ref&gt; The concept is used in [[sociology]], [[Prediction market|business]], [[computer science]] and mass communications: it also appears in [[science fiction]]. [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]] defines collective intelligence as, "It is a form of universally distributed intelligence, constantly enhanced, coordinated in real time, and resulting in the effective mobilization of skills. I'll add the following indispensable characteristic to this definition: The basis and goal of collective intelligence is mutual recognition and enrichment of individuals rather than the cult of fetishized or [[hypostatized]] communities."&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Lévy, ''Collective Intelligence: Mankind's Emerging World in Cyberspace'', 1994, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; According to researchers [[Pierre Lévy]] and [[Derrick de Kerckhove]], it refers to capacity of networked [[ICTs]] (Information communication technologies) to enhance the collective pool of social knowledge by simultaneously expanding the extent of human interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry ''New Media: An Introduction''. Oxford University Press, 2007, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Collective intelligence strongly contributes to the shift of knowledge and power from the individual to the collective. According to [[Eric S. Raymond]] (1998) and JC Herz (2005), [[open source]] intelligence will eventually generate superior outcomes to knowledge generated by proprietary software developed within corporations ([[Terry Flew|Flew]] 2008). Media theorist [[Henry Jenkins]] sees collective intelligence as an 'alternative source of media power', related to convergence culture. He draws attention to education and the way people are learning to participate in knowledge cultures outside formal learning settings. [[Henry Jenkins]] criticizes schools which promote 'autonomous problem solvers and self-contained learners' while remaining hostile to learning through the means of collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, ''Henry Convergence Culture: Where old and new media collide''. New York: New York University Press, 2006, p. 259&lt;/ref&gt; Both [[Pierre Lévy]] (2007) and [[Henry Jenkins]] (2008) support the claim that collective intelligence is important for [[democratization]], as it is interlinked with knowledge-based culture and sustained by collective idea sharing, and thus contributes to a better understanding of diverse society.

Similar to the [[G factor (psychometrics)|''g'' factor (''g'')]] for general individual intelligence, a new scientific understanding of collective intelligence aims to extract a general collective intelligence factor '''c factor''' for groups indicating a group's ability to perform a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=Anita Williams|last2=Chabris|first2=Christopher F.|last3=Pentland|first3=Alex|last4=Hashmi|first4=Nada|last5=Malone|first5=Thomas W.|date=2010-10-29|title=Evidence for a Collective Intelligence Factor in the Performance of Human Groups|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/330/6004/686|journal=Science|language=en|volume=330|issue=6004|pages=686–688|doi=10.1126/science.1193147|pmid=20929725|bibcode=2010Sci...330..686W}}&lt;/ref&gt; Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are derived from ''g''.

Causes for ''c'' and predictive validity are investigated as well.

== History ==
[[File:World Brain HG Wells 1938.jpg|left|thumb|H.G. Wells ''World Brain'' (1936–1938)]]
The concept (although not so named) originated in 1785 with the [[Marquis de Condorcet]], whose "jury theorem" states that if each member of a voting group is more likely than not to make a correct decision, the probability that the highest vote of the group is the correct decision increases with the number of members of the group (see [[Condorcet's jury theorem]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landemore|first1=Hélène|title=Landemore, Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many|date=2012|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Many theorists have interpreted [[Aristotle]]'s statement in the [[Politics]] that "a feast to which many contribute is better than a dinner provided out of a single purse" to mean that just as many may bring different dishes to the table, so in a deliberation many may contribute different pieces of information to generate a better decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Waldron|first1=Jeremy|title=The Wisdom of the Multitude: Some Reflections on Book 3, Chapter 11 of Aristotle's Politics|journal=Political Theory|date=1995|volume=23|issue=4|pages=563–584|doi=10.1177/0090591795023004001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ober|first1=Josiah|title=Democracy and Knowledge|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, N.J.|pages=110–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent scholarship,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cammack|first1=Daniela|title=Aristotle and the Virtue of the Multitude|journal=Political Theory|date=2013|volume=41|issue=2|pages=175–202|doi=10.1177/0090591712470423}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, suggests that this was probably not what Aristotle meant but is a modern interpretation based on what we now know about team intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Page|first1=Scott|title=The Difference: How the Power of Diversity Creates Better Groups, Firms, Schools, and Societies|date=2008|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A precursor of the concept is found in entomologist [[William Morton Wheeler]]'s observation that seemingly independent individuals can cooperate so closely as to become indistinguishable from a single organism (1910)&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler, W. M. (1910). Ants: their structure, development and behavior (Vol. 9). Columbia University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;. Wheeler saw this collaborative process at work in [[ants]] that acted like the cells of a single beast he called a [[superorganism]].

In 1912 [[Émile Durkheim]] identified society as the sole source of human logical thought. He argued in "[[The Elementary Forms of Religious Life]]" that society constitutes a higher intelligence because it transcends the individual over space and time.&lt;ref&gt;Émile Durkheim, ''The Elementary Forms of Religious Life'', 1912.&lt;/ref&gt; Other antecedents are [[Vladimir Vernadsky]]'s concept of "[[noosphere]]" and [[H.G. Wells]]'s concept of "[[world brain]]" (see also the term "[[global brain]]"). Peter Russell, [[Elisabet Sahtouris]], and [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]] (originator of the term "conscious evolution")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://barbaramarxhubbard.com/book/|title=About the Book – Foundation for Conscious Evolution|newspaper=Foundation for Conscious Evolution|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; are inspired by the visions of a noosphere&amp;nbsp;– a transcendent, rapidly evolving collective intelligence&amp;nbsp;– an informational cortex of the planet. The notion has more recently been examined by the philosopher [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]]. In a 1962 research report, [[Douglas Engelbart]] linked collective intelligence to organizational effectiveness, and predicted that pro-actively 'augmenting human intellect' would yield a multiplier effect in group problem solving: "Three people working together in this augmented mode [would] seem to be more than three times as effective in solving a complex problem as is one augmented person working alone".&lt;ref&gt;Engelbart, Douglas (1962) [http://www.dougengelbart.org/pubs/augment-3906.html#3b9 Augmenting Human Intellect: A Conceptual Framework] – section on Team Cooperation&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, he coined the term 'collective IQ' as a measure of collective intelligence, to focus attention on the opportunity to significantly raise collective IQ in business and society.&lt;ref&gt;Engelbart, Douglas (1994)[https://archive.org/stream/boostingcollecti00drdo#page/n9/mode/2up Boosting Collective IQ] (Slide Handouts)&amp;nbsp;– 'Collective IQ' defined on Slide 4; also (1994) [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qdIWQZtEq04&amp;t=1016 BBN Distinguished Guest Lecture] (Video)&amp;nbsp;– 'Collective IQ' defined @16:56 "CoDIAK"&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of collective intelligence also forms the framework for contemporary democratic theories often referred to as [[epistemic democracy]]. Epistemic democratic theories refer to the capacity of the populace, either through deliberation or aggregation of knowledge, to track the truth and relies on mechanisms to synthesize and apply collective intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Landemore|first1=Helene|title=Democratic Reason: Politics, Collective Intelligence, and the Rule of the Many|date=2013|publisher=Princeton University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Howard Bloom]] has discussed mass behavior – [[collective behavior]] from the level of quarks to the level of bacterial, plant, animal, and human societies. He stresses the biological adaptations that have turned most of this earth's living beings into components of what he calls "a learning machine". In 1986 Bloom combined the concepts of [[apoptosis]], [[parallel distributed processing]], [[group selection]], and the superorganism to produce a theory of how collective intelligence works.&lt;ref&gt;Howard Bloom, ''The Lucifer Principle: A Scientific Expedition Into the Forces of History'', 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Later he showed how the collective intelligences of competing bacterial colonies and human societies can be explained in terms of computer-generated "[[complex adaptive systems]]" and the "[[genetic algorithms]]", concepts pioneered by [[John Henry Holland|John Holland]].&lt;ref name="bloom2000"/&gt;

Bloom traced the evolution of collective intelligence to our bacterial ancestors 1 billion years ago and demonstrated how a multi-species intelligence has worked since the beginning of life.&lt;ref name="bloom2000"&gt;Howard Bloom, ''Global Brain: The Evolution of Mass Mind from the Big Bang to the 21st Century'', 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Ant societies exhibit more intelligence, in terms of technology, than any other animal except for humans and co-operate in keeping livestock, for example [[aphid]]s for "milking".&lt;ref name="bloom2000" /&gt; Leaf cutters care for fungi and carry leaves to feed the fungi.&lt;ref name="bloom2000" /&gt;

He develops the concept of a 'group mind' as articulated by [[Thomas Hobbes]] in "Leviathan" and [[Gustav Fechner|Fechner]]'s arguments for a [[collective consciousness]] of mankind. He cites [[Émile Durkheim|Durkheim]] as the most notable advocate of a "collective consciousness"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Er3lCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=david+skrbina+durkheim#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Authenticity, Autonomy and Multiculturalism|last=Levey|first=Geoffrey Brahm|date=2015-05-01|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781317535928|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Teilhard de Chardin]] as a thinker who has developed the philosophical implications of the group mind.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Panpsychism in the West|last=Skrbina|first=David F.|date=2007-01-26|publisher=The MIT Press|isbn=9780262693516|edition=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tom Atlee focuses primarily on humans and on work to upgrade what Howard Bloom calls "the group IQ". Atlee feels that collective intelligence can be encouraged "to overcome '[[groupthink]]' and individual [[cognitive bias]] in order to allow a collective to cooperate on one process – while achieving enhanced intellectual performance." George Pór defined the collective intelligence phenomenon as "the capacity of human communities to evolve towards higher order complexity and harmony, through such innovation mechanisms as differentiation and integration, competition and collaboration."&lt;ref&gt;George Pór, [http://www.community-intelligence.com/blogs/public Blog of Collective Intelligence]&lt;/ref&gt; Atlee and Pór state that "collective intelligence also involves achieving a single focus of attention and standard of metrics which provide an appropriate threshold of action".&lt;ref name=":20"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community-intelligence.com/files/Atlee%20-%20Por%20-%20CI%20as%20a%20Field%20of%20multidisciplinary%20study%20and%20practice%20.pdf|title=Collective Intelligence as a Field of Multi‐disciplinary Study and Practice|last=Atlee|first=Tom|date=|website=Community Intelligence|publisher=CommunityIntelligence. Ltd|access-date=December 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their approach is rooted in [[scientific community metaphor]].&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

The term group intelligence is sometimes used interchangeably with the term collective intelligence. Anita Woolley presents Collective intelligence as a measure of group intelligence and group creativity.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The idea is that a measure of collective intelligence covers a broad range of features of the group, mainly group composition and group interaction.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; The features of composition that lead to increased levels of collective intelligence in groups include criteria such as higher numbers of women in the group as well as increased diversity of the group.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

Atlee and Pór suggest that the field of collective intelligence should primarily be seen as a human enterprise in which mind-sets, a willingness to share and an openness to the value of distributed intelligence for the common good are paramount, though group theory and [[artificial intelligence]] have something to offer.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt; Individuals who respect collective intelligence are confident of their own abilities and recognize that the whole is indeed greater than the sum of any individual parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Leimeister|first=Jan Marco|date=2010-06-24|title=Collective Intelligence|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12599-010-0114-8|journal=Business &amp; Information Systems Engineering|language=en|volume=2|issue=4|pages=245–248|doi=10.1007/s12599-010-0114-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maximizing collective intelligence relies on the ability of an organization to accept and develop "The Golden Suggestion", which is any potentially useful input from any member.&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; [[Groupthink]] often hampers collective intelligence by limiting input to a select few individuals or filtering potential Golden Suggestions without fully developing them to implementation.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

[[Robert David Steele Vivas]] in ''The New Craft of Intelligence'' portrayed all citizens as "intelligence minutemen," drawing only on legal and ethical sources of information, able to create a "public intelligence" that keeps public officials and corporate managers honest, turning the concept of "national intelligence" (previously concerned about spies and secrecy) on its head.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The New Craft of Intelligence: Personal, Public, &amp; Political—Citizen's Action Handbook for Fighting Terrorism, Genocide, Disease, Toxic Bombs, &amp; Corruption|last=Steele|first=Robert David|date=2002-04-08|publisher=Oss Pr|isbn=9780971566118|location=Oakton, Va.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mass_collaboration.jpg|thumb|Stigmergic Collaboration: a theoretical framework for mass collaboration]]
According to [[Don Tapscott]] and [[Anthony D. Williams (author)|Anthony D. Williams]], collective intelligence is [[mass collaboration]]. In order for this concept to happen, four principles need to exist;&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;
; Openness: [[idea sharing|Sharing ideas]] and [[intellectual property]]: though these resources provide the edge over competitors more benefits accrue from allowing others to share ideas and gain significant improvement and scrutiny through collaboration.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

; Peering: Horizontal organization as with the 'opening up' of the Linux program where users are free to modify and develop it provided that they make it available for others. Peering succeeds because it encourages [[self-organization]]&amp;nbsp;– a style of production that works more effectively than hierarchical management for certain tasks.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

; [[Sharing]]: Companies have started to share some ideas while maintaining some degree of control over others, like potential and critical [[patent rights]]. Limiting all intellectual property shuts out opportunities, while sharing some expands markets and brings out products faster.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

; Acting Globally: The advancement in communication technology has prompted the rise of global companies at low overhead costs. The [[internet]] is widespread, therefore a globally integrated company has no geographical boundaries and may access new markets, ideas and technology.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008"&gt;Tapscott, D., &amp; Williams, A. D. (2008). ''Wikinomics: How Mass Collaboration Changes Everything'', USA: Penguin Group&lt;/ref&gt;

A new scientific understanding of collective intelligence defines it as a group's general ability to perform a wide range of tasks.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Definition, operationalization and statistical methods are similar to the [[G factor (psychometrics)|psychometric approach of general individual intelligence]].

=== Processes ===
[[File:Causes for c.png|thumb|Predictors for the collective intelligence factor ''c''. Suggested by Woolley, Aggarwal &amp; Malone&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt; (2015)]]

==== Top-down processes ====
Top-down processes cover group interaction, such as structures, processes, and norms.&lt;ref name="Woolley 420–424"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woolley|first=A. W.|last2=Aggarwal|first2=I.|last3=Malone|first3=T.

==== Bottom-up processes ====
Bottom-up processes include group composition,&lt;ref name="Woolley 420–424"/&gt; namely the characteristics of group members which are aggregated to the team level&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; encompassing. An example of such bottom-up processes is the average social sensitivity or the average and maximum intelligence scores of group members.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Furthermore, collective intelligence was found to be related to a group's cognitive diversity&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Aggarwal, I. |author2=Woolley, A.

Consequently, groups where members are too similar to each other lack the variety of perspectives and skills needed to perform well. On the other hand, groups whose members are too different seem to have difficulties to communicate and coordinate effectively.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

==== Serial vs Parallel processes ====

For most of human history, collective intelligence was confined to small tribal groups in which opinions were aggregated through real-time parallel interactions among members.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/871336785|title=Moral tribes : emotion, reason, and the gap between us and them|last=1974–|first=Greene, Joshua David,|isbn=0143126059|oclc=871336785}}&lt;/ref&gt;   In modern times, mass communication, mass media, and networking technologies have enabled collective intelligence to span massive groups, distributed across continents and time-zones.  To accommodate this shift in scale, collective intelligence in large-scale groups been dominated by serialized polling processes such as aggregating up-votes, likes, and ratings over time.  While modern systems benefit from larger group size, the serialized process has been found to introduce substantial noise that distorts the collective output of the group.  In one significant study of serialized collective intelligence, it was found that the first vote contributed to a serialized voting system can distort the final result by 34%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Muchnik|first=Lev|last2=Aral|first2=Sinan|last3=Taylor|first3=Sean J.|date=2013-08-09|title=Social Influence Bias: A Randomized Experiment|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/341/6146/647|journal=Science|language=en|volume=341|issue=6146|pages=647–651|doi=10.1126/science.1240466|issn=0036-8075|pmid=23929980|bibcode=2013Sci...341..647M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To address the problems of serialized aggregation of input among large-scale groups, recent advancements collective intelligence have worked to replace serialized votes, polls, and markets, with parallel systems such as "[[Swarm intelligence|human swarms]]" modeled after synchronous swarms in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20161215-why-bees-could-be-the-secret-to-superhuman-intelligence|title=Why bees could be the secret to superhuman intelligence|last=Oxenham|first=Simon|access-date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=L.|last2=Baltaxe|first2=D.|last3=Pescetelli|first3=N.|date=2016-10-01|title=Crowds vs swarms, a comparison of intelligence|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7780278/|journal=2016 Swarm/Human Blended Intelligence Workshop (SHBI)|pages=1–4|doi=10.1109/SHBI.2016.7780278|isbn=978-1-5090-3502-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Based on natural process of [[Swarm Intelligence]], these artificial swarms of networked humans enable participants to work together in parallel to answer questions and make predictions as an emergent collective intelligence.  In one high-profile example, a human swarm challenge by CBS Interactive to predict the Kentucky Derby.  The swarm correctly predicted the first four horses, in order, defying 542–1 odds and turning a $20 bet into $10,800.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newsweek.com/artificial-intelligence-turns-20-11000-kentucky-derby-bet-457783|title=Artificial intelligence turns $20 into $11,000 in Kentucky Derby bet|date=2016-05-10|work=Newsweek|access-date=2017-05-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evidence ===

''c'' and average (maximum) member intelligence  scores are regressed on the criterion tasks.]]
Woolley, Chabris, Pentland, Hashmi, &amp; Malone (2010),&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the originators of this scientific understanding of collective intelligence, found a single statistical factor for collective intelligence in their research across 192 groups with people randomly recruited from the public. In Woolley et al.'s two initial studies, groups worked together on different tasks from the [[The Circumplex Model of Group Tasks|McGrath Task Circumplex]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Groups: Interaction and Performance|last=McGrath, J. E.|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=1984|isbn=|location=Englewood Cliffs, NJ|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a well-established taxonomy of group tasks. Tasks were chosen from all four quadrants of the circumplex and included visual puzzles, brainstorming, making collective moral judgments, and negotiating over limited resources. The results in these tasks were taken to conduct a [[factor analysis]]. Both studies showed support for a general collective intelligence factor ''c'' underlying differences in group performance with an initial eigenvalue accounting for 43% (44% in study 2) of the variance, whereas the next factor accounted for only 18% (20%). That fits the range normally found in research regarding a [[G factor (psychometrics)|general individual intelligence factor ''g'']] typically accounting for 40% to 50% percent of between-individual performance differences on cognitive tests.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
Afterwards, a more complex criterion task was absolved by each group measuring whether the extracted ''c'' factor had predictive power for performance outside the original task batteries. Criterion tasks were playing [[Draughts|checkers (draughts)]] against a standardized computer in the first and a complex architectural design task in the second study. In a [[regression analysis]] using both individual intelligence of group members and ''c'' to predict performance on the criterion tasks, ''c'' had a significant effect, but average and maximum individual intelligence had not. While average (r=0.15, P=0.04) and maximum intelligence (r=0.19, P=0.008) of individual group members were moderately correlated with ''c'', ''c'' was still a much better predictor of the criterion tasks. According to Woolley et al., this supports the existence of a collective intelligence factor ''c,'' because it demonstrates an effect over and beyond group members' individual intelligence and thus that ''c'' is more than just the aggregation of the individual IQs or the influence of the group member with the highest IQ.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Engel et al.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; (2014) replicated Woolley et al.'s findings applying an accelerated battery of tasks with a first factor in the factor analysis explaining 49% of the between-group variance in performance with the following factors explaining less than half of this amount. Moreover, they found a similar result for groups working together online communicating only via text and confirmed the role of female proportion and social sensitivity in causing collective intelligence in both cases. Similarly to Wolley et al.,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; they also measured social sensitivity with the RME which is actually meant to measure people's ability to detect mental states in other peoples' eyes. The online collaborating participants, however, did neither know nor see each other at all. The authors conclude that scores on the RME must be related to a broader set of abilities of social reasoning than only drawing inferences from other people's eye expressions.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Engel|first=David|last2=Woolley|first2=Anita Williams|last3=Aggarwal|first3=Ishani|last4=Chabris|first4=Christopher F.|last5=Takahashi|first5=Masamichi|last6=Nemoto|first6=Keiichi|last7=Kaiser|first7=Carolin|last8=Kim|first8=Young Ji|last9=Malone|first9=Thomas W.|date=2015-01-01|title=Collective Intelligence in Computer-Mediated Collaboration Emerges in Different Contexts and Cultures|url=http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/2702123.2702259|journal=Proceedings of the 33rd Annual ACM Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems|series=CHI '15|location=New York, NY, USA|publisher=ACM|pages=3769–3778|doi=10.1145/2702123.2702259|isbn=9781450331456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, various proposals and working papers are in progress or already completed but (supposedly) still in a [[scholarly peer review]]ing publication process.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/stern.nyu.edu/collective-intelligence-conference/|title=Collective Intelligence 2016|website=sites.google.com|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.lsa.umich.edu/collectiveintelligence/posters/|title=Posters {{!}} Collective Intelligence 2015|website=sites.lsa.umich.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://collective.mech.northwestern.edu/?page_id=217|title=Proceedings {{!}} Collective Intelligence 2014|website=collective.mech.northwestern.edu|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite arxiv|eprint=1204.2991|last1= Malone|first1= Thomas W.|title= Collective Intelligence 2012: Proceedings|author2= Luis von Ahn|class= cs.SI|year= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Predictive validity ===
Next to predicting a group's performance on more complex criterion tasks as shown in the original experiments,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; the collective intelligence factor ''c'' was also found to predict group performance in diverse tasks in MBA classes lasting over several months.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Thereby, highly collectively intelligent groups earned significantly higher scores on their group assignments although their members did not do any better on other individually performed assignments. Moreover, highly collective intelligent teams improved performance over time suggesting that more collectively intelligent teams learn better.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; This is another potential parallel to individual intelligence where more intelligent people are found to acquire new material quicker.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author1=Schmidt, F.L. |author2= Hunter, J.E. |last-author-amp=yes |date=1998|title=The validity and utility of selection methods in personnel psychology: Practical and theoretical implications of 85 years of research findings|url=|journal=Psychological Bulletin |volume=124 |issue= 2 |pages=262–274|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.124.2.262|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative mathematical techniques ==
=== Computational collective intelligence ===
[[File:Computational collective intelligence.jpg|thumb|Computational Collective Intelligence, by Tadeusz Szuba]]
In 2001, Tadeusz (Tad) Szuba from the [[Akademia Górniczo-Hutnicza|AGH University]] in Poland proposed a formal model for the phenomenon of collective intelligence. It is assumed to be an unconscious, random, parallel, and distributed computational process, run in mathematical logic by the social structure.&lt;ref name="szuba"&gt;Szuba T., ''Computational Collective Intelligence'', 420 pages, Wiley NY, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In this model, beings and information are modeled as abstract information molecules carrying expressions of mathematical logic.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; They are quasi-randomly displacing due to their interaction with their environments with their intended displacements.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; Their interaction in abstract computational space creates multi-thread inference process which we perceive as collective intelligence.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; Thus, a non-[[Alan Turing|Turing]] model of computation is used. This theory allows simple formal definition of collective intelligence as the property of [[social structure]] and seems to be working well for a wide spectrum of beings, from bacterial colonies up to human social structures. Collective intelligence considered as a specific computational process is providing a straightforward explanation of several social phenomena. For this model of collective intelligence, the formal definition of IQS (IQ Social) was proposed and was defined as "the probability function over the time and domain of N-element inferences which are reflecting inference activity of the social structure".&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; While IQS seems to be computationally hard, modeling of social structure in terms of a computational process as described above gives a chance for approximation.&lt;ref name="szuba" /&gt; Prospective applications are optimization of companies through the maximization of their IQS, and the analysis of drug resistance against collective intelligence of bacterial colonies.&lt;ref name="szuba"/&gt;

=== Collective intelligence quotient ===
One measure sometimes applied, especially by more artificial intelligence focused theorists, is a "collective intelligence quotient"&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=_tHmKrpSeEQC&amp;pg=PA141&amp;lpg=PA141&amp;dq=collective+intelligence+quotient#v=onepage&amp;q=collective%20intelligence%20quotient&amp;f=false|title=Computational Collective Intelligence.

== Applications ==
''Elicitation of point estimates'' – Here, we try to get an estimate (in a single value) of something. For example, estimating the weight of an object, or the release date of a product or probability of success of a project etc. as are seen in prediction markets like Intrade, HSX or InklingMarkets and also in several implementations of crowdsourced estimation of a numeric outcome. Essentially, we try to get the average value of the estimates provided by the members in the crowd.

''Opinion Aggregation'' – In this situation, we gather opinions from the crowd regarding some idea, issue or product. For example, trying to get a rating (on some scale) of a product sold online (such as Amazon’s star rating system). Here, the emphasis is to collect and simply aggregate the ratings provided by customers/users.

''Idea Collection'' – In these problems, someone solicits ideas for projects, designs or solutions from the crowd. For example, ideas on solving a data science problem (as in Kaggle) or getting a good design for a T-shirt (as in Threadless) or in getting answers to simple problems that only humans can do well (as in Amazon’s Mechanical Turk). Here, the objective is to gather the ideas and devise some selection criteria to choose the best ideas.

[[New media]] are often associated with the promotion and enhancement of collective intelligence. The ability of new media to easily store and retrieve information, predominantly through databases and the Internet, allows for it to be shared without difficulty. Thus, through interaction with new media, knowledge easily passes between sources {{Harv|Flew|2008}} resulting in a form of collective intelligence. The use of interactive new media, particularly the internet, promotes online interaction and this distribution of knowledge between users.

[[Francis Heylighen]], [[Valentin Turchin]], and Gottfried Mayer-Kress are among those who view collective intelligence through the lens of computer science and [[cybernetics]]. In their view, the Internet enables collective intelligence at the widest, planetary scale, thus facilitating the emergence of a [[global brain]].
[[File:Global_brain.jpg|thumb|The makeup of a global brain]]
The developer of the World Wide Web, [[Tim Berners-Lee]], aimed to promote sharing and publishing of information globally. Later his employer opened up the technology for free use. In the early '90s, the Internet's potential was still untapped, until the mid-1990s when 'critical mass', as termed by the head of the Advanced Research Project Agency (ARPA), Dr. [[J.C.R. Licklider]], demanded more accessibility and utility.&lt;ref name="Weiss, A. 2005 pp. 19-23"&gt;Weiss, A. (2005). The Power of Collective Intelligence. Collective Intelligence, pp. 19–23&lt;/ref&gt; The driving force of this Internet-based collective intelligence is the digitization of information and communication. [[Henry Jenkins]], a key theorist of new media and media convergence draws on the theory that collective intelligence can be attributed to media convergence and participatory culture {{Harv|Flew|2008}}. He criticizes contemporary education for failing to incorporate online trends of collective problem solving into the classroom, stating "whereas a collective intelligence community encourages ownership of work as a group, schools grade individuals". Jenkins argues that interaction within a knowledge community builds vital skills for young people, and teamwork through collective intelligence communities contribute to the development of such skills.&lt;ref name=":25"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://labweb.education.wisc.edu/curric606/readings/Jenkins2002.pdf|title=INTERACTIVE AUDIENCES?

[[Pierre Lévy|Lévy]] and [[Derrick de Kerckhove|de Kerckhove]] consider CI from a mass communications perspective, focusing on the ability of networked information and communication technologies to enhance the community knowledge pool. They suggest that these communications tools enable humans to interact and to share and collaborate with both ease and speed (Flew 2008). With the development of the [[Internet]] and its widespread use, the opportunity to contribute to knowledge-building communities, such as [[Wikipedia]], is greater than ever before. These computer networks give participating users the opportunity to store and to retrieve knowledge through the collective access to these databases and allow them to "harness the hive"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=New Media: an introduction.|last=Flew|first=Terry|publisher=Oxford University Press.|year=2008|isbn=|location=Melbourne|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the [[MIT Center for Collective Intelligence]] research and explore collective intelligence of groups of people and computers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html MIT Center for Collective Intelligence] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611041615/http://cci.mit.edu/people/index.html |date=11 June 2010 }}.

In this context collective intelligence is often confused with [[shared knowledge]]. The former is the sum total of information held individually by members of a community while the latter is information that is believed to be true and known by all members of the community.&lt;ref&gt;Jenkins, H. 2006. ''Convergence Culture''. New York: New York University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Collective intelligence as represented by [[Web 2.0]] has less user engagement than [[collaborative intelligence]]. An art project using Web 2.0 platforms is "Shared Galaxy", an experiment developed by an anonymous artist to create a collective identity that shows up as one person on several platforms like MySpace, Facebook, YouTube and Second Life. The password is written in the profiles and the accounts named "Shared Galaxy" are open to be used by anyone. In this way many take part in being one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scardamalia|first=Marlene|last2=Bereiter|first2=Carl|date=1994-07-01|title=Computer Support for Knowledge-Building Communities|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1207/s15327809jls0303_3|journal=Journal of the Learning Sciences|volume=3|issue=3|pages=265–283|doi=10.1207/s15327809jls0303_3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another art project using collective intelligence to produce artistic work is Curatron, where a large group of artists together decides on a smaller group that they think would make a good collaborative group.

Recent research using data from the social bookmarking website [[Delicious (website)|Delicious]], has shown that collaborative tagging systems exhibit a form of [[complex system]]s (or [[Self-organization|self-organizing]]) dynamics.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" &gt;Harry Halpin, Valentin Robu, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1242572.1242602 The Complex Dynamics of Collaborative Tagging], Proceedings 6th International Conference on the World Wide Web (WWW'07), Banff, Canada, pp. 211–220, ACM Press, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1145/1460563.1460600|last1=Fu|first1=Wai-Tat|title=Semantic imitation in social tagging|journal=ACM Transactions on Computer-Human Interaction|pages=229|year=2010|url=http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1806926|isbn=9781605580074}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fu|first1=Wai-Tat|title=A Semantic Imitation Model of Social Tagging.|journal=Proceedings of the IEEE conference on Social Computing|pages=66–72|date=August 2009|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=5283882&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D5283882}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there is no central controlled vocabulary to constrain the actions of individual users, the distributions of tags that describe different resources has been shown to converge over time to a stable [[power law]] distributions.&lt;ref name="WWW07-ref" /&gt; Once such stable distributions form, examining the [[correlation]]s between different tags can be used to construct simple folksonomy graphs, which can be efficiently partitioned to obtained a form of community or shared vocabularies.&lt;ref name="TWEB-ref" &gt;Valentin Robu, Harry Halpin, Hana Shepherd [http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1594173.1594176 Emergence of consensus and shared vocabularies in collaborative tagging systems], ACM Transactions on the Web (TWEB), Vol. 3(4), article 14, ACM Press, September 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Such vocabularies can be seen as a form of collective intelligence, emerging from the decentralised actions of a community of users.

==== P2P business ====
Research performed by Tapscott and Williams has provided a few examples of the benefits of collective intelligence to business:&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

;Talent utilization
:At the rate technology is changing, no firm can fully keep up in the innovations needed to compete. Instead, smart firms are drawing on the power of mass collaboration to involve participation of the people they could not employ. This also helps generate continual interest in the firm in the form of those drawn to new idea creation as well as investment opportunities.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;
;Demand creation
:Firms can create a new market for complementary goods by engaging in open source community. Firms also are able to expand into new fields that they previously would not have been able to without the addition of resources and collaboration from the community. This creates, as mentioned before, a new market for complementary goods for the products in said new fields.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;
;Costs reduction
:Mass collaboration can help to reduce costs dramatically. Firms can release a specific software or product to be evaluated or debugged by online communities. The results will be more personal, robust and error-free products created in a short amount of time and costs. New ideas can also be generated and explored by collaboration of online communities creating opportunities for free R&amp;D outside the confines of the company.&lt;ref name="Tapscott, D. 2008" /&gt;

==== Open source software ====
Cultural theorist and online community developer, John Banks considered the contribution of online fan communities in the creation of the [[Trainz]] product. He argued that its commercial success was fundamentally dependent upon "the formation and growth of an active and vibrant online fan community that would both actively promote the product and create content- extensions and additions to the game software".&lt;ref name="jbanks"&gt;John A.L. Banks. ''Negotiating Participatory Culture in the New Media Environment: Auran and the Trainz Online Community&amp;nbsp;– An (Im)possible Relation'', The University of Queensland. School of English, Media Studies and Art History. MelbourneDAC2003&lt;/ref&gt;

The increase in user created content and interactivity gives rise to issues of control over the game itself and ownership of the player-created content. This gives rise to fundamental legal issues, highlighted by Lessig&lt;ref&gt;L, Lessig,(2006)Code Version 2.0 (2nd ed.). New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; and Bray and Konsynski,&lt;ref&gt;Bray, DA &amp; Konsynski, BR, 2007, ''Virtual Worlds, Virtual Economies, Virtual Institutions'', viewed 10 October 2008, p. 1-27 &lt;http://ssrn.com/abstract=962501&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; such as [[intellectual property]] and property ownership rights.

Gosney extends this issue of Collective Intelligence in videogames one step further in his discussion of [[alternate reality gaming]]. This genre, he describes as an "across-media game that deliberately blurs the line between the in-game and out-of-game experiences"&lt;ref name=":27"&gt;Gosney, J.W, 2005, ''Beyond Reality: A Guide to Alternate Reality Gaming'', Thomson Course Technology, Boston.&lt;/ref&gt; as events that happen outside the game reality "reach out" into the player's lives in order to bring them together. Solving the game requires "the collective and collaborative efforts of multiple players"; thus the issue of collective and collaborative team play is essential to ARG. Gosney argues that the Alternate Reality genre of gaming dictates an unprecedented level of collaboration and "collective intelligence" in order to solve the mystery of the game.&lt;ref name=":27" /&gt;

==== Benefits of co-operation ====
Co-operation helps to solve most important and most interesting multi-science problems. In his book, James Surowiecki mentioned that most scientists think that benefits of co-operation have much more value when compared to potential costs. Co-operation works also because at best it guarantees number of different viewpoints. Because of the possibilities of technology global co-operation is nowadays much easier and productive than before. It is clear that, when co-operation goes from university level to global it has significant benefits.

For example, why do scientists co-operate? Science has become more and more isolated and each science field has spread even more and it is impossible for one person to be aware of all developments. This is true especially in experimental research where highly advanced equipment requires special skills. With co-operation scientists can use information from different fields and use it effectively instead of gathering all the information just by reading by themselves."&lt;ref name="Surowiecki"&gt;Surowiecki, J., 2007 'The Wisdom of crowds. Why the Many Are Smarter Than the Few'&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2017}}

=== Coordination ===
==== Ad-hoc communities ====
Military, trade unions, and corporations satisfy some definitions of CI – the most rigorous definition would require a capacity to respond to very arbitrary conditions without orders or guidance from "law" or "customers" to constrain actions. Online advertising companies are using collective intelligence to bypass traditional marketing and creative agencies.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Sang M., et al. "Success factors of platform leadership in web 2.0 service business." Service Business 4.2 (2010): 89–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://unu.ai/ UNU] open platform for "human swarming" (or "social swarming") establishes real-time closed-loop systems around groups of networked users molded after biological swarms, enabling human participants to behave as a unified collective intelligence.&lt;ref name="Human Swarms"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.discovery.com/human/life/swarms-of-humans-power-a-i-platform-150603.htm|title=Swarms of Humans Power A.I.

Specialized information sites such as Digital Photography Review&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.dpreview.com/|title=Digital Photography Review|website=www.dpreview.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; or Camera Labs&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cameralabs.com/|title=Camera reviews, DSLR reviews, lens reviews, photography guides {{!}} Cameralabs|website=www.cameralabs.com|access-date=2016-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an example of collective intelligence. Anyone who has an access to the internet can contribute to distributing their knowledge over the world through the specialized information sites.

In [[learner-generated context]] a group of users marshal resources to create an ecology that meets their needs often (but not only) in relation to the co-configuration, co-creation and co-design of a particular learning space that allows learners to create their own context.&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R., du Boulay, B., Smith, H., Underwood, J., Fitzpatrick, G., Holmberg, J., Kerawalla, L., Tunley, H., Brewster, D. and Pearce, D. (2005), 'Using Mobile Technology to Create Flexible Learning Contexts '. Journal of Interactive Media in Education, 22.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R. (2006), Understanding Learning Contexts as Ecologies of Resources: From the Zone of Proximal Development to Learner Generated Contexts. Paper presented at the Proceedings of World Conference on Elearning in Corporate, Government, Healthcare, and Higher Education 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Luckin, R., Shurville, S. and Browne, T. (2007), 'Initiating elearning by stealth, participation and consultation in a late majority institution'. Organisational Transformation and Social Change, 3, 4, 317–332.&lt;/ref&gt; Learner-generated contexts represent an ''ad hoc'' community that facilitates coordination of collective action in a network of trust. An example of learner-generated context is found on the Internet when collaborative users pool knowledge in a "[[shared intelligence]] space". As the Internet has developed so has the concept of CI as a shared public forum. The global accessibility and availability of the Internet has allowed more people than ever to contribute and access ideas. (Flew 2008)

Games such as ''[[The Sims]]'' Series, and ''[[Second Life]]'' are designed to be non-linear and to depend on collective intelligence for expansion. This way of sharing is gradually evolving and influencing the mindset of the current and future generations.&lt;ref name="Weiss, A. 2005 pp. 19-23"/&gt; For them, collective intelligence has become a norm. In Terry Flew's discussion of '[[interactivity]]' in the online games environment, the ongoing interactive dialogue between users and game developers,&lt;ref&gt;Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) "Games: Technology, Industry, Culture" in Terry Flew, New Media: An Introduction (2nd edn), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; he refers to [[Pierre Lévy (philosopher)|Pierre Lévy]]'s concept of Collective Intelligence {{Harv|Lévy|1998}} and argues this is active in videogames as clans or guilds in [[MMORPG]] constantly work to achieve goals. [[Henry Jenkins]] proposes that the participatory cultures emerging between games producers, media companies, and the end-users mark a fundamental shift in the nature of media production and consumption. Jenkins argues that this new participatory culture arises at the intersection of three broad new media trends.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Jenkins (2002) in Flew, Terry and Humphreys, Sal (2005) ''Games: Technology, Industry, Culture'' in Terry Flew, New Media: An Introduction (2nd edn), Oxford University Press, South Melbourne 101–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Firstly, the development of new media tools/technologies enabling the creation of content. Secondly, the rise of subcultures promoting such creations, and lastly, the growth of value adding media conglomerates, which foster image, idea and narrative flow.

==== Coordinating collective actions ====
[[File:Improvisational_actors.jpg|thumb|The cast of After School Improv learns an important lesson about improvisation and life]]
Improvisational actors also experience a type of collective intelligence which they term "group mind", as theatrical improvisation relies on mutual cooperation and agreement,&lt;ref name=":18"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vera|first=Dusya|last2=Crossan|first2=Mary|date=2004-06-01|title=Theatrical Improvisation: Lessons for Organizations|url=http://oss.sagepub.com/content/25/5/727|journal=Organization Studies|language=en|volume=25|issue=5|pages=727–749|doi=10.1177/0170840604042412}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the unity of "group mind".&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=*|first=R.

Growth of the Internet and mobile telecom has also produced "swarming" or "rendezvous" events that enable meetings or even dates on demand.&lt;ref name="Wolpert arXiv:cs/9905004"/&gt; The full impact has yet to be felt but the [[anti-globalization movement]], for example, relies heavily on e-mail, cell phones, pagers, SMS and other means of organizing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vskz1poDuvoC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=anti+globalization+collective+intelligence#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Globalization / Anti-Globalization: Beyond the Great Divide|last=Held|first=David|last2=McGrew|first2=Anthony|date=2007-11-19|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745639116|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Indymedia]] organization does this in a more journalistic way.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2001/09/11129.html|title='Anti-Globals' Use Internet As Collective Intelligence – UK Indymedia|website=www.indymedia.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such resources could combine into a form of collective intelligence accountable only to the current participants yet with some strong moral or linguistic guidance from generations of contributors – or even take on a more obviously democratic form to advance shared goal.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

==== Coordination in different types of tasks ====
Collective actions or tasks require different amounts of coordination depending on the complexity of the task. Tasks vary from being highly independent simple tasks that require very little coordination to complex interdependent tasks that are built by many individuals and require a lot of coordination. In the article written by Kittur, Lee and Kraut the writers introduce a problem in cooperation: "When tasks require high coordination because the work is highly interdependent, having more contributors can increase process losses, reducing the effectiveness of the group below what individual members could optimally accomplish". Having a team too large the overall effectiveness may suffer even when the extra contributors increase the resources. In the end the overall costs from coordination might overwhelm other costs.&lt;ref&gt;Kittur, A., Lee, B. and Kraut, R. E. (2009) 'Coordination in collective intelligence: The role of team structure and task interdependence', Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems - Proceedings, pp. 1495–1504.&lt;/ref&gt;

Group collective intelligence is a property that emerges through coordination from both bottom-up and top-down processes. In a bottom-up process the different characteristics of each member are involved in contributing and enhancing coordination. Top-down processes are more strict and fixed with norms, group structures and routines that in their own way enhance the group's collective work.&lt;ref&gt;[18] Woolley, A. W., Aggarwal, I. and Malone, T. W. (2015) 'Collective Intelligence and Group Performance', Current Directions in Psychological Science, 24(6), pp. 420–424.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative views ==
===A tool for combating self-preservation===

Tom Atlee reflects that, although humans have an innate ability to gather and analyze data, they are affected by culture, education and social institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=YV4dCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA140|title=In Search of The Black Seed|last=Abdul-Karim|first=Kashif|date=2015-11-23|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329694897|language=en|page=140}}&lt;/ref&gt; A single person tends to make decisions motivated by self-preservation. Therefore, without collective intelligence, humans may drive themselves into extinction based on their selfish needs.&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;Atlee, T. (2008). [http://www.communicationagents.com/tom_atlee/2008/05/15/reflections_on_the_evolution_of_choice_and_collective_intelligence.htm Reflections on the evolution of choice and collective intelligence], Retrieved 26 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Separation from IQism===
Phillip Brown and Hugh Lauder quotes Bowles and [[Herbert Gintis|Gintis]] (1976) that in order to truly define collective intelligence, it is crucial to separate 'intelligence' from IQism.&lt;ref name=":28"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2001/jun/18/socialsciences.highereducation1|title=Capitalism and Social Progress by Phillip Brown and Hugh Lauder (cont... )|date=2001-06-18|newspaper=The Guardian|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; They go on to argue that intelligence is an achievement and can only be developed if allowed to.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt; For example, earlier on, groups from the lower levels of society are severely restricted from aggregating and pooling their intelligence. This is because the elites fear that the collective intelligence would convince the people to rebel. If there is no such capacity and relations, there would be no infrastructure on which collective intelligence is built {{Harv|Brown|Lauder|2000|p=230}}. This reflects how powerful collective intelligence can be if left to develop.&lt;ref name=":28" /&gt;

===Artificial intelligence views===
Skeptics, especially those critical of artificial intelligence and more inclined to believe that risk of [[bodily harm]] and bodily action are the basis of all unity between people, are more likely to emphasize the capacity of a group to take action and withstand harm as one fluid [[mass mobilization]], shrugging off harms the way a body shrugs off the loss of a few cells.&lt;ref name=":29"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.johnzerzan.net/radio/|title=John Zerzan: anti-civilization theorist, writer and speaker|website=www.johnzerzan.net|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":31"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moore|first=Jason W.|date=2001-01-01|editor-last=Arrighi|editor-first=Giovanni|editor2-last=Silver|editor2-first=Beverly J.|title=Globalization in Historical Perspective|journal=Science &amp; Society|volume=65|issue=3|pages=386–397|doi=10.1521/siso.65.3.386.17767|jstor=40403938}}&lt;/ref&gt;This strain of thought is most obvious in the [[anti-globalization movement]] and characterized by the works of [[John Zerzan]], [[Carol Moore]], and [[Starhawk]], who typically shun academics.&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31"/&gt; These theorists are more likely to refer to ecological and [[collective wisdom]] and to the role of [[consensus process]] in making ontological distinctions than to any form of "intelligence" as such, which they often argue does not exist, or is mere "cleverness".&lt;ref name=":29" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":31"/&gt;

Harsh critics of artificial intelligence on ethical grounds are likely to promote collective wisdom-building methods, such as the [[new tribalists]] and the [[Gaianism|Gaians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metamorphoptics.blogspot.com/|title=m e t a m o r p h o p t i c s|website=metamorphoptics.blogspot.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether these can be said to be collective intelligence systems is an open question. Some, e.g. [[Bill Joy]], simply wish to avoid any form of autonomous artificial intelligence and seem willing to work on rigorous collective intelligence in order to remove any possible niche for AI.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/2000/04/joy-2/|title=Why the Future Doesn't Need Us|last=Joy|first=Bill|newspaper=WIRED|language=en-US|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to these views, Artificial Intelligence companies such as [[Amazon Mechanical Turk]] and [[CrowdFlower]] are using collective intelligence and [[crowdsourcing]] or [[consensus-based assessment]] to collect the enormous amounts of data for [[machine learning]] algorithms such as [[Keras]] and [[IBM Watson]].

=== Solving climate change ===
Global collective intelligence is also seen as the key in solving the challenges that the humankind faces now and in the future. [[Climate change]] is an example of a global issue which collective intelligence is currently trying to tackle. With the help of collective intelligence applications such as online [[crowdsourcing]] people across the globe are collaborating in developing solutions to climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/next/earth/crowdsourcing-climate-change-solutions/|title=How Millions of People Can Help Solve Climate Change — NOVA Next {{!}} PBS|date=2014-01-15|work=NOVA Next|access-date=2017-10-31|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5904">[[File:Columbarium-500.jpg|thumb|The [[Columbarium of San Francisco]]]]
A '''columbarium''' (pl. '''columbaria''') is a place for the respectful and usually public storage of [[Cremation|cinerary]] [[urn]]s (i.e., urns holding a deceased's [[Cremation|cremated]] remains), but can also mean the nesting boxes of [[pigeons]]. The term comes from the [[Latin]] "''columba''" (dove) and, originally, solely referred to compartmentalized housing for doves and pigeons called a [[dovecote]].

==Background==
Roman columbaria were often built partly or completely underground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Toynbee |first=J M C |title=Death and Burial in the Roman World |date=1971 |publisher= Johns Hopkins University Press |pages= 113–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Columbarium of Pomponius Hylas]] is an ancient Roman example, rich in frescoes, decorations and precious mosaics.&lt;ref&gt;Ancient Roman underground columbariums included: Columbarium of Statilii, Columbarium of Volusii, Columbarium of Livia, Columbarium of Pomponius Hylas, Columbarium of Lucius Arruntius, Columbarium of Iunius Silanus, Columbarium of Nero Claudius Druscus, Columbarium of Marcella, Columbarium of Carvilii, Columbarium of C. Annius Pollio, Columbarium of Caecilii, Columbarium of Passienii, Columbarium of Bruttii, Columbarium of L. Caninius Gallus, Columbarium of L. Abucii, Columbarium of Q. Sallustii. Further reading in Pavia, Carlo.  ''Guide to Underground Rome: From the Cloaca Maxima to the Domus Aurea: the Most Fascinating Underground Sites of the Capital.''  English translation by Darragh Henegan.  Rome: Gangemi, 2000.  {{ISBN|88-7448-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today's columbaria can be either free standing units, or part of a [[mausoleum]] or another building. Some manufacturers produce columbaria that are built entirely off-site and brought to the cemetery by a large truck. Many modern [[crematory |crematoria]] have columbaria. Examples of these are the columbaria in [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris and [[Golders Green Crematorium]] in London.

In other cases, columbaria are built into church structures. One example is the [[Cathedral of Our Lady of the Angels]] (Los Angeles, California), which houses a number of columbarium niches in the mausoleum built into the lower levels of the Cathedral. The construction of columbaria within churches is particularly widespread in the [[Czechoslovak Hussite Church]]. An example can be seen at the Church of St Nicolas in [[Old Town Square (Prague)]]. In the [[Roman Catholic Church]], although traditional burial is still preferred, [[cremation]] is permitted provided that the cremated remains are buried or entombed. As a result, columbaria can be found within some Catholic cemeteries.

Columbaria are often closely similar in form to traditional Buddhist temples, which from ancient times have housed cremated ashes. In [[Buddhism]], ashes of the deceased may be placed in a columbarium (in [[Chinese language|Chinese]], a ''naguta'' ("bone-receiving pagoda"); in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], a ''nokotsudo'' ("bone-receiving hall"), which can be either attached to or a part of a Buddhist temple or cemetery.  This practice allows for the family of the deceased to visit the temple for the conduct of traditional memorials and ancestor rites.

==Columbarium caves in Israel==
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 12061 Colombarium cave in Hirbat Midras.jpg|thumb|Columbarium cave in Hirbat Midras, Archaeological sites of Israel]]
In the [[Beit Guvrin National Park|Bet Guvrin]] area several series of large caves dug into soft rock were found. There were several theories about their original use, for ritual burial, for growing pigeons to be used for ritual sacrifice, or for raising pigeons for fertilizer production. One such cave had been covered by an earthquake close to the time of its original usage and had no signs of secondary usage; neither ashes nor pigeon droppings were found in it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.parks.org.il/sites/English/ParksAndReserves/BeitGuvrin/Pages/default.aspx |title= Bet Guvrin National Park |website= Israel National Parks}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.israel21c.org/the-land-of-a-1000-caves/ |title= The Land of 1000 Caves |website= israel21c.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the archaeologic finds on [[Masada]], a columbarium tower foundation remains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2321">'''Cover's Theorem''' is a statement in [[computational learning theory]] and is one of the primary theoretical motivations for the use of non-linear [[kernel methods]] in [[machine learning]] applications. The theorem states that given a set of training data that is not [[linearly separable]], one can with high probability transform it into a training set that is linearly separable by projecting it into a [[higher-dimensional space]] via some [[non-linear transformation]].  The theorem is named after the information theorist [[Thomas M. Cover]] who stated it in 1965.

The [[mathematical proof|proof]] is easy. A [[map (mathematics)|deterministic mapping]] may be used. Indeed, suppose there are &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; samples. Lift them onto the vertices of the [[simplex]] in the &lt;math&gt;n-1&lt;/math&gt; dimensional real space. Every [[partition of a set|partition]] of the samples into two sets is separable by a [[linear separability|linear separator]]. QED.

'''''Director of Public Prosecutions v Santa-Bermudez''''' [2003&amp;#93; EWHC 2908 (Admin),&lt;ref name=b /&gt; also known as '''''DPP v Santana-Bermudez''''',&lt;ref name=l /&gt; is a 2003 decision of the [[Divisional Court (England and Wales)|Divisional Court]] of [[Queen's Bench Division]] of the [[High Court of Justice of England and Wales]], considering an appeal by the [[Director of Public Prosecutions (England and Wales)|Director of Public Prosecutions]] (DPP) in a criminal [[assault]] case.  

The defendant, Santa-Bermudez, had lied about the presence of sharp objects in his pocket when being searched by a female [[police constable]] and the constable was injured. The defendant was charged with [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] but he argued that as he had not actively committed any action that led to the injury, he lacked the required ''[[actus reus]]'' for the crime to have been committed. 

Although convicted at the [[Magistrates' Court (England and Wales)|Magistrates' Court]], the defendant appealed to the [[Crown Court]] which found in his favour and dismissed the case.  The DPP appealed to the High Court, which ruled that the defendant's willful [[omissions in English criminal law|omission]], which put the constable in a dangerous situation, was sufficient ''actus reus'' for the crime to have been committed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://digestiblenotes.com/law/criminal_cases/omissions.php |title=Omissions Cases |publisher=Digestible Notes |date= |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
In June 2001, PC Hill was called to [[Stockwell tube station]] where she was investigating [[ticket tout]]s. She found the defendant and [[stop and search|searched him]] under section 1 of the [[Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984]]. When asked if he had any sharp items on him, the defendant answered in the negative. Upon searching him, PC Hill was pricked by [[hypodermic needle]]s hidden in his pockets. The defendant was arrested and was later discovered to have [[HIV]] and [[hepatitis C]], though PC Hill was not infected.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

== Crown Court ==
The defendant was charged with [[assault occasioning actual bodily harm]] (ABH) and was found guilty at [[Horseferry Road Magistrates' Court]]. He appealed this conviction to [[Middlesex Guildhall|Middlesex Crown Court]], which heard the appeal in December 2001. Following the prosecution's evidence being given, the defendant's counsel submitted that the defendant had committed no positive act that resulted in ABH, that an omission did not amount to assault, and on that basis there was [[no case to answer]]. The panel agreed, allowing the appeal, and quashed the conviction.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

The DPP appealed this decision to the High Court to determine whether an omission did constitute sufficient ''actus reus'' for the crime to be committed.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

== High Court ==
The DPP's appeal was heard by [[Maurice Kay|Mr Justice Maurice Kay]] and [[Colin Mackay (judge)|Mr Justice Mackay]], sitting as the Divisional Court of the Queen's Bench Division.  The DPP was represented by [[Rachel Lawrence]] (daughter of former MP Sir [[Ivan Lawrence]]), instructed by the [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS); she was the same prosecution barrister as had appeared in the Crown Court.  The CPS indicated that they would not seek for the case to be remitted to the Crown Court for a retrial; having already been acquitted, the defendant did not appear and was not represented in the High Court.&lt;ref name=b /&gt;

The judges considered the DPP's submission that ''[[Fagan v Metropolitan Police Commissioner]]'' and ''R v Roberts'' showed that willful omission could be sufficient ''actus reus''.&lt;ref name=b /&gt; The court also considered the case of ''[[R v Miller]]'' where it was held that [[recklessness (law)|recklessly]] failing to take action when the defendant created a dangerous situation was enough for ''actus reus''. 

Mr Justice Maurice Kay, giving the only reasoned judgment, commented that "A great deal of undesirable complexity has bedevilled our criminal law as a result of quasi theological distinctions between acts and omissions".  He held that, as the defendant had recklessly given a false statement to PC Hill that put her in a dangerous situation with a foreseeable risk of harm through the omission, the Crown Court was incorrect to allow the motion to dismiss and allowed the appeal.&lt;ref name=l&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lexisweb.co.uk/cases/2003/november/director-of-public-prosecutions-v-santana-bermudez |title=Director of Public Prosecutions v Santana-Bermudez |publisher=LexisWeb |date=13 November 2003 |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Mr Justice Mackay agreed with the ''[[ratio decidendi]]''.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bailii.org/cgi-bin/markup.cgi?doc=/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2003/2908.html&amp;query=Bermudez&amp;method=all#disp0 |title=Director of Public Prosecutions v Santa-Bermudez [2003&amp;#93; EWHC 2908 (Admin) (13 November 2003) |publisher=Bailii.org |date= |accessdate=5 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The legal principle that an assault can be committed by an omission that was affirmed in this case, was later put into [[statute law]] through the passage of the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first =Nicola | last =Monaghan | title =Criminal Law Directions  | publisher = Oxford University Press | volume =   | year = 2014 | isbn = 0198702280 | page = 33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rashan Charles''', a 20-year-old [[Black British]] man, died on 22 July 2017 following contact with an officer from the [[Metropolitan Police Service|Metropolitan Police]] in [[Dalston]], England. Charles died after being chased and restrained by a police officer and attempting to swallow a package containing [[caffeine]] and [[Paracetamol]].

This was the second death in little more than a month of a young black man in London following police contact, after the [[Death of Edson Da Costa]]. The footage of Charles being restrained was shared on social media&lt;ref name="independent2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rashan-charles-rashman-rash-man-dies-dead-london-police-dalston-chase-ipcc-met-video-cctv-swallowed-a7855376.html|title=Man dies after being chased by police and apprehended in shop|date=23 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with Da Costa's death, it led to multiple protests.&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/family-friends-demand-justice-rashan-charles-fears-community-anger-spill-protests-riots-a7856171.html|title=Rashan Charles' family and friends are demanding justice amid fears anger could spill over|date=23 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[inquest]] in June 2018 concluded that Charles had died as a result of the object obstructing his airway, and that the officers were not responsibile.

==Background==
The Metropolitan Police said the incident took place after a vehicle stop in Kingsland Road, Dalston at 1:45 am on Saturday, 22 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.met.police.uk/news/statement-following-death-of-man-in-hackney-252240|title=Statement following death of man in Hackney|website=News.met.police|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Charles fled the vehicle and was pursued by police into a shop, where he placed an object into his mouth and resisted arrest.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.standard.co.uk/news/crime/cctv-footage-shows-rashan-charles-swallow-object-while-being-chased-by-police-a3594521.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The officer, who wore a body camera, threw Charles to the ground, held him down by the neck, and tried to reach inside his mouth. A member of the public helped him restrain Charles. Charles subsequently "became ill", was given emergency treatment at the scene, and was taken by ambulance to [[Royal London Hospital]], where he died later that morning.  The object Charles tried to swallow was reportedly recovered at the scene.&lt;ref name="Independent1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rashan-charles-rashman-rash-man-dies-police-east-london-hackney-video-metropolitan-police-ipcc-a7855631.html|title=CCTV emerges of Rashan Charles being taken to ground by police in London shop before he died|date=23 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | date = July 24, 2017 | title = Everything We Know About What Happened To Rashan Charles, Who Died After Being Chased By The Police | url = http://www.irishnews.com/magazine/daily/2017/07/24/news/everything-we-know-about-what-happened-to-rashan-charles-who-died-after-being-chased-by-the-police-1091822/ | work = The Irish News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
The video of Charles' contact with the police was widely shared on social media platforms.&lt;ref name="independent2"/&gt; The [[National Union of Students Black Students' Campaign]] tweeted that Charles had been "murdered" by the Metropolitan Police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/nusBSC/status/889056348922675200|title=Rashan Charles - Murdered in Dalston yesterday by the Metropolitan Police.

Pauline Pearce, a local politician and activist who was known for berating looters during the [[2011 London riots]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2012/08/03/pauline-pearce-the-hackney-heroine-london-riots_n_1737312.html|title=The Hackney Heroine: 'Nothing's Changed'|first1=Felicity A. Morse Editorial|last1=assistant|first2=HuffPost|last2=UK|date=4 August 2012|website=HuffPost UK|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; described Charles as "a darling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/rashan-charles-dead-police-tribute-friends-died-hackney-guardian-gentle-caring-a7856111.html|title=Friends pay emotional tribute to 'gentle and caring' Rashan Charles, who died after being arrested by police in Hackney|date=23 July 2017|website=Independent.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Friends and family of Charles called for action to be taken against the officer involved, suggesting protests could take place otherwise. A friend of Charles told ''[[The Independent]]'', "Rash was unarmed and he was not resisting arrest...I just don't understand the whole taking him down to the ground and choking him and handcuffing him" and accused police of abusing their authority. ''The Independent'' reported that "community anger over his death could spill over into violence".&lt;ref name="independent.co.uk"/&gt;

===Protests===
More than 300 protesters attended a demonstration organised by 'Hackney Stand Up to Racism and Fascism' on Monday 24 July. The group stated they were "enormously concerned and angered" by Charles' death and cited both the [[Death of Edson Da Costa]] and of Rashan Charles as examples of "seemingly endless list of young black men dying at the hands of the authorities".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/anger-grows-over-young-dad-rashan-charles-police-chase-death-10959303|title=Anger grows over young dad's police chase death|website=News.sky.com|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protest, a march from the shop where the altercation took place to Stoke Newington police station, was described as mostly peaceful, but several masked activists chanted "murderers" at police and hurled broken bottles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/rashan-charles-death-father-calls-for-peace-as-furious-protesters-hurl-missiles-at-police-during-a3595201.html|title=Rashan Charles' dad demands peace as protesters hurl bottles at police|date=25 July 2017|website=Standard.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hackneygazette.co.uk/news/rashan-charles-death-furious-protesters-march-to-stoke-newington-police-station-1-5120371|title=Rashan Charles: Furious protesters march on Stoke Newington police station demanding justice for 20-year-old’s death|first=Emma|last=Bartholomew|website=Hackneygazette.co.uk|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More protests were held in Dalston and Hackney on Friday, 28 July 2017.&lt;ref name="theguardiandemonstratorsblock"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wyatt|first1=Timothy|title=Demonstrators block Dalston road in violent protest at Rashan Charles death|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/28/demonstrators-dalston-london-protest-death-rashan-charles|accessdate=28 July 2017|work=The Guardian|date=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bbcnewsprotestersthrowfireworksatpolice"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rashan Charles death: Protesters throw fireworks at police|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-london-40756629|accessdate=28 July 2017|work=BBC News|date=29 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IOPC Investigation==
The [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (later renamed the [[Independent Office for Police Conduct]] in January 2018) started an investigation. The IPCC reported that the item Charles attempted to swallow contained a mixture of [[caffeine]] and [[Paracetamol]] (acetaminophen) wrapped in plastic. Although these are not illegal to possess in the UK, this combination of drugs has been used as [[Cutting agent|"cutting" agents]] for Class A drugs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/pair-convicted-for-drug-offence-over-crushed-paracetamol-and-caffeine-8163415.html "Pair convicted for drug offence over crushed Paracetamol and caffeine"], ''The Independent''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Inquest ===
The full [[inquest]], was held in June 2018 in front of a [[coroner]] and [[jury]]. The police officers involved in the restraint and arrest of Charles that resulted in his death were given the right to remain anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/london/rashan-charles-police-officers-involved-in-detention-of-man-who-later-died-granted-inquest-anonymity-a3694636.html|title=Police involved in detaining Rashan Charles granted inquest anonymity|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-01-18|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/nov/17/police-officers-granted-anonymity-at-rashan-charles-inquest|title=Police officers granted anonymity at Rashan Charles inquest|last=Taylor|first=Diane|date=2017-11-17|website=the Guardian|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Wednesday 20 June 2018, the jury returned a verdict of [[accidental death]]. The jury concluded that the officers' use of force was justified and that Charles' death was a consequence of the package he had swallowed blocking his airway. While they concluded that the officers failed to follow protocol by not calling for an ambulance sooner, they argued that this would not have saved Charles' life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.met.police.uk/news/rashan-charles-inquest-verdict-311489 "Rashan Charles inquest police"], ''Metropolitan Police'', June 20 2018&lt;/ref&gt; The verdict was criticized by at least one member of Charles' family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.sky.com/story/rashan-charles-death-an-accident-jury-rules-as-family-brand-inquest-a-farce-11411273|date=20 June 2018|accessdate=23 July 2018|title=Rashan Charles death 'an accident', jury rules as family brand inquest a 'farce'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tossing of eggs is non-accidental: the intruder rolls the egg to the edge of the nest by repeatedly flicking it with its [[beak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/33667934|title=Coloniality in the cliff swallow : the effect of group size on social behavior|last=22-|first=Brown, Charles Robert, 1958 September|date=1996|publisher=University of Chicago Press|others=Brown, Mary Bomberger.|isbn=0226076253|location=Chicago, IL|oclc=33667934}}&lt;/ref&gt; During co-[[nest]]ing, before a bird starts laying its own [[Egg (biology)|eggs]], it tosses out other eggs laid previously by another female.

Preventing early egg-layers from dominating [[reproduction]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/144618428|title=Ecology and evolution of cooperative breeding in birds|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=Koenig, Walter D., 1950-, Dickinson, Janis L., 1955-|isbn=0521530997|location=Cambridge|oclc=144618428}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Laying eggs late can be detrimental to the offspring once the egg is hatched since it will be smaller than their siblings thus increasing the risk of death.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Performing this behaviour increases the offspring per individual compared to those in single pairs and many species have learnt to adapt to increase the chances of their offspring to survive.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Species that display this behaviour ==
Some examples of communal breeders that demonstrate the egg tossing behaviour are: [[Common ostrich|ostriches]], [[Groove-billed ani|grooved-bill anis]], [[acorn woodpecker]]s,&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brown|first=Charles R.|last2=Brown|first2=Mary Bomberger|date=1988|title=The Costs and Benefits of Egg Destruction by Conspecifics in Colonial Cliff Swallows|jstor=4087387|journal=The Auk|volume=105|issue=4|pages=737–748|doi=10.2307/4087387}}&lt;/ref&gt; the gray-breasted jay,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the guira cuckoo and smoothed-bill anis.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;[[File:Guira cuckoos (Guira guira).JPG|thumb|Guira cuckoos]]

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
In communal breeding there are multiple females in a group. This has shown that the number of eggs produced per individual is greater in comparison to single female groups.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Reasoning behind this is due to the higher competition between females: to have their own eggs be successfully hatched and from the large amount of egg loss.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The acorn woodpecker showed that when in a group of 7-8 individuals, the success rate of reproduction increased, but would decrease if more members joined the group.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When there were two females in the clutch the success would decrease compared to a single female clutch; since there is a higher competitive and conflict rate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In the guira cuckoo, up to 7 females share a nest and perform egg tossing behaviour. Eggs that are laid in the early period of production are more likely to be tossed out of the nest by another female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; When the group size increases, the egg tossing behaviour does not increase.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Disadvantage ===
Laying eggs late prevents that individuals eggs being tossed out of the nest, but can have a negative impact on the offspring. Late egg laying causes later hatching which increases the probability of death.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; These late chicks will be smaller than their nest mates, putting them at risk.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Adaptation ==
In the acorn woodpecker it has been observed that due to the egg destruction behaviour it causes the egg laying to be synchronized between females. This synchronization of egg laying allows for all females to have the same opportunity to have a similar number of eggs in the nest.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt; The larger the communal breeding group is the longer it takes for the synchronization to occur.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;
[[File:Birds of the Bible (1909) (14563584419).jpg|thumb|Drawing of ostrich's with their young.]]
Ostriches are usually found in a group of two to seven and there is only one major hen which will incubate the nest with the single male. The female ostriches will lay their eggs at the same time, leading to having too many eggs in the nest.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The major hen is able to detect which eggs belong to her and will push the other eggs on the perimeter of the nest, which is not looked after. This adaption of abandoning these eggs protects the well kept eggs from predators.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

In the grooved bill anis and in the guira cuckoo, these species will stop tossing eggs once they have started to produce eggs in the nest. This behaviour prevents them from unknowingly toss one of their own eggs out of the nest.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Egg tossing by brood parasites ==
[[File:Cowbird egg.JPG|thumb|Brown headed cowbird's egg in an Eastern Phoebe's nest]]A slightly different behaviour is that of [[brood parasite]] birds, such as some species of [[cuckoo]]s.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; There are two types of brood parasitism, one which the females lay their eggs in the nest of the same species or different species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robert|first=M.|date=2001-03-01|title=The evolution of obligate interspecific brood parasitism in birds|url=https://academic.oup.com/beheco/article/12/2/128/239797|journal=Behavioral Ecology|language=en|volume=12|issue=2|pages=128–133|doi=10.1093/beheco/12.2.128|issn=1045-2249}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Piet-my-vrou &amp; cape robin.jpg|thumb|A cape-robin chat feeding a juvenile red-chested cuckoo ( brood parasitism).]]
The [[common cuckoo]] watches the nest of a potential host. Once the host leaves the nest the female cuckoo will remove one of the hosts eggs and will replace it with one of hers.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The female cuckoo will have no part in taking care of her offspring; she will leave the host's nest and look for another nest which she can lay another egg.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

There are different methods that brood parasites trick the host in raising their child, however some host's have developed counter adaptations to these.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The adaptation between the host and brood parasites is an example of [[Coevolution|co-evolution]].&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Species ===
Several species of cuckoos and cowbirds.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevens|first=Martin|date=2013-10-21|title=Bird brood parasitism|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982213010312|journal=Current Biology|volume=23|issue=20|pages=R909–R913|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2013.08.025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Exploration Systems Architecture Study''' ('''ESAS''') is the official title of a large-scale, system level study released by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA) in November 2005 in response to American president [[George W. Bush]]'s announcement on January 14, 2004 of his goal of returning [[astronauts]] to the [[Moon]] and eventually [[Mars]] &amp;mdash; known as the [[Vision for Space Exploration]] (and unofficially as "Moon, Mars and Beyond" in some aerospace circles, though the specifics of a manned "beyond" program remain vague).

Recent (2005–2009) NASA Administrator [[Michael D. Griffin|Michael Griffin]] ordered a number of changes in the originally planned [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] (CEV) acquisition strategy designed by his predecessor [[Sean O'Keefe]]. Griffin's plans favored a design he had developed as part of a study for the Planetary Society, rather than the prior plans for a [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] developed in parallel by two competing teams. These changes were proposed in an internal study called the Exploration Systems Architecture Study,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Crew Exploration Vehicle Procurement|url=http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/cev_procurement3_lite.html|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2008-03-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080403075851/http://exploration.nasa.gov/acquisition/cev_procurement3_lite.html|archivedate=2008-04-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose results were officially presented during a [[press conference]] held at NASA Headquarters in [[Washington, D.C.]] on September 19, 2005.

The ESAS includes a number of recommendations for accelerating the development of the CEV and implementing [[Project Constellation]], including strategies for flying manned CEV flights as early as 2012 (now pushed back to at least 2015) and methods for servicing the [[International Space Station]] (ISS) without the use of the [[Space Shuttle]],&lt;ref name="spaceref"&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Studying Unmanned Solution to Complete Space Station as Return to Flight Costs Grow|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1052|publisher=spaceref.com|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; using cargo versions of the CEV.

Originally slated for release as early as July 25, 2005, after the "Return to Flight" mission of [[Space Shuttle Discovery|Discovery]], the release of the ESAS was delayed until September 19, reportedly due to poor reviews of the presentation of the plan and some resistance from the [[Office of Management and Budget]].&lt;ref name="spaceref"/&gt;

==Shuttle based launch system==
The initial CEV “procurement strategies” under Sean O’ Keefe would have seen two “phases” of CEV design.  Proposals submitted in May 2005 were to be part of the Phase 1 portion of CEV design, which was to be followed by an orbital or suborbital fly-off of technology demonstrator spacecraft called FAST in 2008.  Downselect to one contractor for Phase 2 of the program would have occurred later that year. First manned flight of the CEV would not occur until as late as 2014. In the original plan favored by former NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe, the CEV would launch on an [[Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle]] (EELV), namely the [[Boeing]] [[Delta IV rocket|Delta IV]] Heavy or [[Lockheed Martin]] [[Atlas V]] Heavy EELVs.

However, with the change of NASA Administrators, Mike Griffin did away with this schedule, viewing it as unacceptably slow, and moved directly to Phase 2 in early 2006.  He commissioned the 60-day internal study for a re-review of the concepts &amp;mdash; now known as the ESAS &amp;mdash; which favored launching the CEV on a [[Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle|shuttle-derived launch vehicle]].  Additionally, Griffin planned to accelerate or otherwise change a number of aspects of the original plan that was released last year{{when|date=January 2011}}. Instead of a CEV fly-off in 2008, NASA would have moved to Phase 2 of the CEV program in 2006, with CEV flights to have commenced as early as June 2011.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The ESAS called for the development of two shuttle-derived launch vehicles to support Project Constellation;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA Plans to Build Two New Shuttle-derived Launch Vehicles|url=http://www.spaceref.com/news/viewnews.html?id=1040|publisher=spaceref.com|accessdate=2008-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; one derived from the space shuttle’s [[Space Shuttle Solid Rocket Booster|solid rocket booster]] (SRB) to launch the CEV, and an in-line heavy-lift vehicle using SRBs and the shuttle’s [[Space Shuttle external tank|external tank]] to launch the Earth Departure Stage and Lunar Surface Access Module.  The performance of the Cargo Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle (SDLV) would be 125 to 130 metric tons to [[Low Earth Orbit]] (LEO).  An SDLV would allow a much greater payload per launch than an EELV option.

[[Image:Rocket size comparison.png|thumb|300px|Comparison of the [[Saturn V]], [[Space Shuttle]], and the three [[Shuttle Derived Launch Vehicle]]s (SDLVs).]]

The crews that would be launched in the CEV atop a five-segment derivative of the Shuttle's Solid Rocket Booster and a new liquid-propellant upper stage based on the Shuttle's External Tank.  Originally to be powered by a single, throw-away version of the [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]], it was later changed (as noted on a space.com article dated on January 20, 2006) to a modernized and uprated version of the [[J-2 (rocket engine)|J-2]] rocket engine (known as the J-2X) used on the [[S-IVB]] upper stages used on the [[Saturn IB]] and [[Saturn V]] rockets.  This booster would be capable of placing up to 25 tons into low Earth orbit. The booster would use components that have already been man-rated.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

Cargo would be launched on a heavy-lift version of the Space Shuttle, which would be an "in-line" booster which would mount payloads on top of the booster. The in-line option originally featured five throw-away versions of the SSMEs on the core stage, but was changed later to five [[RS-68 (rocket engine)|RS-68]] rocket engines (currently in use on the Delta IV rocket), with higher thrust and lower costs, which required a slight increase in the overall diameter of the core.  Two enlarged five-segment SRBs would help the RS-68 engines propel the rocket's second stage, known as the [[Earth Departure Stage]] (EDS), and payload into LEO.  It could lift about 125 tons to LEO, and is estimated to cost $540 million per launch.&lt;!-- Commenting out broken ref - will leave a note on talk page...&lt;ref name="orlando"&gt;http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/custom/space/orl-asec-moon073105,0,3136666.htmlstory?coll=orl-home-promo&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;

Therefore, the infrastructure at [[John F. Kennedy Space Center|Kennedy Space Center]], including the [[Vehicle Assembly Building]] (VAB) and Shuttle launch pads [[Launch complex 39|LC-39A]] and 39B would be maintained and adapted to the needs of the future giant launch vehicle, with an option of constructing two new pads (LC-39C &amp; LC-39D) or resurrecting the former [[Launch Complex 34|LC-34]] or [[Launch Complex 37|LC-37A]] pads at the nearby [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station]] used by the Saturn IB for the early Apollo earth orbital missions.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==CEV configuration==
The ESAS recommends strategies for flying the manned CEV by 2014, and endorses a [[Lunar Orbit Rendezvous]] approach to the Moon.  The LEO versions of the CEV would carry crews four to six to the ISS.  The lunar version of the CEV would carry a crew of four and the Mars CEV would carry six.  Cargo could also be carried aboard an unmanned version CEV, similar to the Russian [[Progress (spacecraft)|Progress]] cargo ships.  The contractor for the CEV will be [[Lockheed Martin]], which was selected by NASA in September, 2006 and is the current contractor for the Space Shuttle's External Tank and the Atlas V EELV.

The CEV re-entry module would weigh about 12 tons &amp;mdash; almost twice the mass of the Apollo Command Module &amp;mdash; and, like Apollo, would be attached to a service module for life support and propulsion. The CEV will be an Apollo-like capsule, with a [[Viking program|Viking]]-type [[heat shield]], not a [[lifting body]] or [[wing]]ed vehicle like the current Shuttle.  It would land on land rather than water, similar to the [[Russia]]n [[Soyuz spacecraft]], though it would be capable of a water recovery if an emergency splashdown were needed. Possible landing areas that have been identified include [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, Carson Flats ([[Carson Sink]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Surface Landing Site Weather Analysis for NASA's Constellation Program|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/20080013577_2008013473.pdf
|accessdate=2011-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Nevada, and the area around [[Moses Lake, Washington]] state. Landing on the west coast would allow the majority of the reentry path to be flown over the [[Pacific Ocean]] rather than populated areas.  The CEV would have an ablative (Apollo-like) heat shield that would be discarded after each use, and the CEV itself could be reused about 10 times.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="orlando"/&gt;--&gt;

Accelerated lunar mission development is slated to start by 2010, once the Shuttle is retired. The Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM) and heavy-lift boosters would be developed in parallel and would both be ready for flight by 2018. The eventual goal is to achieve a lunar landing by 2020.  The LSAM would be much larger than the [[Apollo Lunar Module]] and would be capable of carrying up to 23 tons of cargo to the lunar surface to support a lunar outpost.  This weight in cargo is greater than the mass of the entire Apollo Lunar Module (LM).

Like the Apollo LM, the LSAM would include a descent stage for landing and an ascent stage for returning to orbit.  The crew of four would ride in the ascent stage. The ascent stage would be powered by a [[methane]]/[[oxygen]] fuel for return to lunar orbit (later changed to liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, due to the infancy of oxygen/methane rocket propulsion). This would allow a derivative of the same lander to be used on later Mars missions, where methane propellant can be manufactured from the Martian soil in a process known as [[In-Situ Resource Utilization]] (ISRU).  The LSAM would support the crew of four on the lunar surface for about a week and use advanced roving vehicles to explore the lunar surface.  The huge amount of cargo carried by the LSAM would be extremely beneficial for supporting a lunar base and for bringing large amounts of scientific equipment to the lunar surface.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="orlando"/&gt;--&gt;

==Lunar mission profile==
The lunar mission profile will be a combination of [[earth orbit rendezvous]] and [[lunar orbit rendezvous]] (LOR) approach. First, the LSAM and the EDS will be launched atop the heavy-lift, Shuttle-derived vehicle. The EDS would be a derivative of the [[S-IVB]] upper stage used on the [[Saturn V]] rocket and will use a single J-2X engine similar to that used on the SRB-derived booster{{Citation needed
   | date= July 2009
   | reason= I don't know what was supposed to be here.  I think what was meant was that the J-2X is to be used on the other vehicle, too
}} (originally two J-2X engines were to be used, but the RS-68 engines for the core stage will allow NASA to only use one).  The crew will then be launched in the CEV on the SRB-derived booster, and the CEV and LSAM will dock in Earth orbit.  The EDS will then send the complex to the Moon.  The LSAM will brake the complex into lunar orbit (similar to the [[Block D]] rocket on the failed [[Soviet moonshot]] attempt in the 1960s and 1970s), where four astronauts will board the LSAM for descent to the lunar surface for a week of exploration.  Part of the LSAM could be left behind with cargo to begin establishment of a long-term outpost.

The article says that both the LSAM and the lunar CEV would carry a crew of four.  Griffin has subsequently stated  that the entire crew would descend to the lunar surface, leaving the CEV unoccupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Remarks for AIAA Space 2005 Conference &amp; Exhibition|url=http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/126521main_MDG_AIAA_Space_2005.pdf|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2008-03-26|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050908110259/http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/126521main_MDG_AIAA_Space_2005.pdf|archivedate=2005-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the time on the lunar surface has been spent, the crew would return to lunar orbit in the ascent stage of the LSAM.  The LSAM would dock with the CEV.  The crew would return to the CEV and jettison the LSAM, and then the CEV's engine would put the crew on a course for Earth.  Then, much like Apollo, the service module would be jettisoned and the CEV would descend for a landing via a system of three parachutes.  Two parachutes are enough for landing (although in the western United States rather than the Ocean).  The article says that the ESAS contains a recommendation for at least two missions to the moon each year, starting no later than 2018.

Ultimately a base would be built, possibly near the Moon's south pole. But this decision has not yet been taken and might depend on potential international and commercial participation to the exploration project.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

==Extension to Mars==
The use of scalable CEVs and a lander with methane-fueled engines means that meaningful hardware testing for Mars missions could be done on the Moon (though these have since been changed to hydrogen/LOX, losing commonality). The eventual Mars missions would start to be planned in detail around 2020 and would include the use of Lunar ISRU and also be "conjunction-class", meaning that rather than doing a [[Venus]] flyby and spending 20&amp;ndash;40 days on the Martian surface, the crew would go directly to Mars and back and spend about 500&amp;ndash;600 days exploring Mars.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="orlando"/&gt;--&gt;

==Costs==
The ESAS estimates the cost of the manned lunar program through 2025 to be $217 billion, only $7 billion more than NASA's current projected exploration budget through that time.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="orlando"/&gt;--&gt; This estimate may be high because it includes the cost of developing a new engine for the EDS, whereas the current plan is to use a J-2 derivative.&lt;!--&lt;ref name="orlando"/&gt;--&gt;

The ESAS proposal was originally said to be achievable using only existing NASA funding, without significant cuts to NASA's other programs, however it soon became apparent that much more money was needed. Supporters of Constellation saw this as a justification for terminating the Shuttle program as soon as possible, and NASA implemented a plan to terminate support for both Shuttle and ISS in 2010. This was about 10 years earlier than planned for both programs, so must be considered a significant cut. This resulted in strong objections from the international partners that the US was not meeting its commitments, and concerns in Congress that the investment in ISS would be wasted.

==Criticism==
{{see also|Shuttle-Derived Launch Vehicle#Criticisms}}

Beginning April 2006 there were some criticisms on the feasibility of the original ESAS study. These mostly revolved around the use of methane-oxygen fuel.  NASA originally sought this combination because it could be "mined" in situ from lunar or martian soil &amp;ndash; something that could be potentially useful on missions to these celestial bodies.  However, the technology is relatively new and untested.  It would add significant time to the project and significant weight to the system.  In July, 2006, NASA responded to these criticisms by changing the plan to traditional rocket fuels (liquid hydrogen and oxygen for the LSAM and [[hypergolic]]s for the CEV).  This has reduced the weight and shortened the project's timeframe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NASA makes major design changes to CEV|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=4659|publisher=nasaspaceflight.com|accessdate=2008-03-26 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080203202417/http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/content/?cid=4659 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However the primary criticism of the ESAS was based on its estimates of safety and cost. The authors used the launch failure rate of the Titan III and IV as an estimate for the failure rate of the Delta IV heavy. The Titan combined a core stage derived from an early ICBM with large segmented solid fuel boosters and a hydrogen-fueled upper stage developed earlier. It was a complex vehicle and had a relatively high failure rate. In contrast, the Delta IV Heavy was a "clean sheet" design, still in service, which used only liquid propellant. Conversely, the failure rate of the Shuttle SRB was used to estimate the failure rate of the Ares I, however only launches subsequent to the loss of Challenger were considered, and each shuttle launch was considered to be two successful launches of the Ares even though the Shuttle SRBs do not include systems for guidance or roll control.

The Delta IV is currently launched from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Complex 37, and the manufacturer, United Launch Alliance, had proposed launching human flights from there. However, in the estimation of costs, the ESAS assumed that all competing designs would have to be launched from Launch Complex 39, and that the Vehicle Assembly Building, Mobile launcher Platforms and pads A and B would have to be modified to accommodate them. The LC-39 facilities are much larger, more complex, older, and more expensive to maintain than the modern facilities at Complex 37 and are entirely inappropriate for the Delta, which is integrated horizontally and transported unfueled. This assumption was not justified in the report and greatly increased the estimated operational cost for the Delta IV. Finally, the decision in 2011 to add an unmanned test of the Orion on a Delta IV clearly contradicts the ESAS conclusion that this was infeasible.

{{Dreyfus affair}}

'''Marie Georges Picquart''' (6 September 1854, [[Strasbourg]], France &amp;ndash; 19 January 1914, [[Amiens]], France) was a French army officer and Minister of War. He is best known for his role in the [[Dreyfus Affair]].

==Early career==
Picquart began his military career in 1872, graduating from the ''[[Ecole Spéciale Militaire de Saint-Cyr]]'' as fifth in his year. Picquart served as an infantry officer in France before seeing  service in Indochina. He subsequently studied at the General Staff Academy (''l'école d'État-major'') where he was second in his class, before becoming a lecturer at the War Academy (''l'École supérieure de guerre''). One of his students at the latter institute was Alfred Dreyfus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Piers Paul|last=Reid|page=162|title=The Dreyfus Affair|ISBN=978-1-4088-3057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Picquart and the Dreyfus Affair==
Picquart was then appointed to the General Staff in Paris. As a staff officer he acted as reporter of the debates in the first Dreyfus court martial for the then Minister of War and the Chief of the General Staff. Picquart was subsequently promoted to the rank of lieutenant-colonel on 6 April 1896. He was appointed chief of the army's intelligence section (''[[Deuxième Bureau]], service de renseignement militaire'') in 1895. The following year Picquart discovered that the memorandum (''bordereau'') used to convict Captain [[Alfred Dreyfus]], had actually been the work of Major [[Ferdinand Walsin Esterhazy]]. Several high-ranking generals warned Colonel Picquart to conceal his discovery but Picquart persisted and continued his investigation. In this he was hindered and sabotaged by subordinate officers, notably [[Hubert-Joseph Henry|Major Henry]]. As a consequence Picquart was relieved of duty with the Deuxième Bureau and sent (December 1896) to regimental duty, commanding the 4th Regiment of [[Tirailleurs]] (native infantry) based at [[Sousse]] in French Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Piers Paul|last=Reid|page=175|title=The Dreyfus Affair|ISBN=978-1-4088-3057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Picquart 2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lieutenant Colonel Georges Picquart as commander of the 4th Algerian ''[[Tirailleurs]]'']]

After the trial of [[Émile Zola]] for writing the 1898 open letter ''[[J'Accuse…!]]'', Picquart was himself accused of forging the note that had convinced him of Esterhazy's guilt. He was then arrested for forgery and was waiting for a court martial during the period that the French [[Court of Cassation (France)|Court of Cassation]] was reviewing the Dreyfus case. After the second court-martial, held as a consequence of the conclusions of the court, Picquart resigned from the army. However, the exoneration of Dreyfus in 1906 also absolved Picquart, who was, by an act of the Chamber of Deputies, promoted to brigadier-general. That was the rank that an officer of his seniority and experience could normally have expected to reach if his career had not been interrupted by involvement in the Dreyfus affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Tuchman|first1=Barbara W|title=The Proud Tower; a Portrait of the World Before the War, 1890-1914|date=1966|publisher=Hamish Hamilton|location=London|page=226}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subsequent career==
In 1906, General Picquart entered [[Georges Clemenceau]]'s first cabinet as Minister of War. He held that position for the entire duration of the Clemenceau Cabinet, from 25 October 1906 to 24 July 1909. Picquart then returned to military service as an Army Corps commander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Piers Paul|last=Reid|page=347|title=The Dreyfus Affair|ISBN=978-1-4088-3057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Private life==
A keen amateur pianist, Picquart was a regular visitor to the Chaigneau family, whose daughters formed the [[Suzanne Chaigneau|Trio Chaigneau]]. He later helped arrange concerts for them.&lt;ref&gt;Massin B. ''Les Joachim – Une famille de musiciens.'' Fayard, Paris, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
While still a serving army officer, Picquart died on 19 January 1914 from injuries received in a fall from a horse. He was 59.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Piers Paul|last=Reid|page=349|title=The Dreyfus Affair|ISBN=978-1-4088-3057-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Greg J. Chalmers''' (born 11 October 1973) is an Australian [[professional golfer]] who has played on both the [[European Tour]] and the [[PGA Tour]].

Chalmers was born in [[Sydney]]. He won the 1993 [[Australian Amateur]] and the 1994 French Amateur.

Chalmers turned professional in 1995 and made a strong start to his professional career, winning four times in Australia in the next few years, including the 1998 [[Australian Open (golf)|Australian Open]]. In Europe he won the second-tier [[Challenge Tour]]'s [[Challenge Tour Championship]], in 1997 and finished 25th on the [[European Tour]] Order of Merit in 1998. The same year he finished fourth at the [[PGA Tour]]'s [[Qualifying school]] to win a PGA Tour card for 1999.

A poor 2004 season saw him lose his card, but he won the 2005 [[Albertsons Boise Open]] on the [[Nationwide Tour]] and returned to the main PGA Tour in 2006. Chalmers struggled in 2006, making only 8 cuts and did not maintain his status and played on the [[Nationwide Tour]] during 2007 and 2008. He finished 8th on the money list in the 2008 season to gain his PGA Tour card for the 2009 season.

In 2011, Chalmers won the [[Australian Open (golf)|Australian Open]] for the second time in his career, 13 years after he won his first. He held off late charges by [[John Senden]] and [[Tiger Woods]] to claim victory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2011-11-13/woods-picks-up-early-birdie/3663308/?site=sydney Chalmers takes out Australian Open]&lt;/ref&gt; He followed this up with a win at the [[Australian PGA Championship]], to take the second Australian major of the year. He defeated [[Robert Allenby]] and [[Marcus Fraser (golfer)|Marcus Fraser]] in a sudden death playoff to take the title. These wins led him to win the [[PGA Tour of Australasia]] Order of Merit. He also became only the second player to have a chance of winning the Australian 'triple-crown' but could not claim the Australian Masters title, an event that still eludes him.

In December 2014, Chalmers won his second [[Australian PGA Championship]] title in a sudden death playoff. He came from seven strokes back during the final round after a flawless round of 64 to enter a playoff with [[Wade Ormsby]] and [[Adam Scott (golfer)|Adam Scott]] on 11 under. In a marathon playoff which was the longest in tournament history, Ormsby was eliminated at the third extra hole, with Chalmers and Scott going as far as seven extra holes. On the seventh estra hole, Scott three putted from 30 feet for bogey to allow Chalmers to take the victory. This was his fifth title on the PGA Tour of Australasia and tenth overall professional level victory.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/30468502site=BBC Chalmers claims second Australian PGA Championship]&lt;/ref&gt; He also claimed the year end Order of Merit title for the second time his career.

Chalmers started the 2015-16 PGA Tour season with only veteran member status and alternated between the PGA Tour and Web.com Tour. He earned his first PGA Tour win at the [[Barracuda Championship]] after 18 years and 386 PGA Tour starts, which was the most among active PGA Tour players without a win and one of the longest waits in Tour history. Chalmers and 2013 winner [[Gary Woodland]] were tied before the 18th hole. Woodland bogeyed the last hole and Chalmers eagled the par-five 18th, which meant a six-point victory under the tournament's Modified Stableford scoring system. Previously, his best PGA Tour finishes were second at the 2000 [[Kemper Insurance Open]] and at the 2009 [[Buick Open]]. At 42, Chalmers was also the season's oldest Tour winner. He is also only the 12th left-hander to win a PGA Tour event. Prior to his win, Chalmers was 229th in the FedEx Cup and 490th in the world. The win moved him to 231st in the world and earned him a two-year exemption that also included entry into the [[2016 Open Championship]] as an Open Qualifying Series event after the [[Greenbrier Classic]] was cancelled. Chalmers finished 142nd in the FedEx Cup and did not qualify for the postseason, but the win made him fully exempt through the 2017–18 season.

Chalmers had a career best world ranking was 53rd in 2012. His career best FedEx Cup ranking was 35th in 2012.

Outside of golf, Chalmers runs a Dallas-area charity for autistic children called Maximum Chances, whose name is derived from one of Chalmers' sons.

'''Harry Gordon Frankfurt''' (born May 29, 1929) is an [[American philosopher]]. He is [[professor emeritus]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]], where he taught from 1990 until 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://scholar.princeton.edu/fraharg/biocv |title=Bio &amp;#124; Harry G. Frankfurt |publisher=[[Princeton University]] |date= |accessdate=2016-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; and previously taught at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Ohio State University]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Frankfurt was born on May 29, 1929, in Pennsylvania. He obtained his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1949 and [[Ph.D.]] in 1954 from [[Johns Hopkins University]].

===Career===
He is [[professor emeritus]] of [[philosophy]] at [[Princeton University]] and has previously taught at [[Yale University]], [[Rockefeller University]], and [[Ohio State University]].

His major areas of interest include [[moral philosophy]], [[philosophy of mind]] and [[philosophy of action|action]], and 17th-century [[rationalism]]. His 1986 paper ''[[On Bullshit]]'', a philosophical investigation of the concept of "bullshit", was republished as a book in 2005 and became a surprise [[bestseller]], leading to media appearances such as [[Jon Stewart]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]''. In 2006 he released a companion book, ''On Truth'', which explores society's loss of appreciation for truth.

Among philosophers, he was for a time best known for his interpretation of [[Descartes]]'s rationalism.  His most influential work, however, has been on [[freedom of the will]] (on which he has written numerous important papers&lt;ref&gt;Feinberg; Shafer-Landau: ''Reason &amp; Responsibility'', p. 486.&lt;/ref&gt;) based on his concept of [[higher-order volition]]s and for developing what are known as "[[Frankfurt cases]]" or "Frankfurt counterexamples" (i.e., thought experiments designed to show the possibility of situations in which a person could not have done other than he/she did, but in which our intuition is to say nonetheless that this feature of the situation does not prevent that person from being morally responsible).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankfurt|first=Harry G.|date=1969-01-01|title=Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/oom/service?url_ver=Z39.88-2004&amp;rft_val_fmt=&amp;rft.imuse_id=jphil_1969_0066_0023_0829_0839&amp;svc_id=info:www.pdcnet.org/collection|journal=The Journal of Philosophy|volume=66|issue=23|doi=10.2307/2023833}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Frankfurt is probably the leading living Humean compatibilist, developing Hume's view that to be free is to do what one wants to do.  (Others who develop this view are [[David Velleman]], Gary Watson and [[John Martin Fischer]].)  Frankfurt's version of [[compatibilism]] is  the subject of a substantial literature by other philosophy professors.  More recently, he has written on love and caring.

He is a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]]. He has been a Visiting Fellow of [[All Souls College]], [[Oxford University]]; he served as President, Eastern Division, [[American Philosophical Association]]; and he has received fellowships and grants from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]], the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], and the [[Andrew Mellon Foundation]].

'''Hemolytic disease of the newborn''', also known as '''hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn''', '''HDN''', '''HDFN''', or '''erythroblastosis fetalis''',&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|nine/000952444|erythroblastosis fetalis}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[Alloimmunity|alloimmune]] condition that develops in a peripartum [[fetus]], when the [[IgG]] molecules (one of the five main types of [[antibody|antibodies]]) produced by the mother pass through the [[placenta]]. Among these antibodies are some which attack [[antigen]]s on the [[red blood cell]]s in the [[fetal circulation]], breaking down and destroying the cells ([[hemolysis]]). The fetus can develop [[reticulocytosis]] and [[anemia]]. This fetal disease ranges from mild to very severe, and fetal death from heart failure ([[hydrops fetalis]]) can occur.  When the disease is moderate or severe, many [[erythroblast]]s (immature red blood cells) are present in the fetal blood, and so these forms of the disease can be called ''erythroblastosis fetalis'' (or ''erythroblastosis foetalis'').

HDFN represents a breach of [[immune privilege]] for the fetus or some other form of impairment of the [[immune tolerance in pregnancy|immune tolerance of pregnancy]]. Various types of HDFN are classified by which alloantigen provokes the response. In order of [[incidence (epidemiology)|incidence]], the types include [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (ABO)|ABO]], [[Rh disease|anti-RhD]], [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-RhE)|anti-RhE]], [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Rhc)|anti-Rhc]], anti-Rhe, anti-RhC, multiantigen combinations, and [[hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)|anti-Kell]] {{citation needed|reason=A reference should be provided for this order of incidence|date=July 2018}}.

==Signs and symptoms==
Signs of hemolytic disease of the newborn include a positive [[direct coombs test|direct Coombs test]] (also called direct agglutination test), elevated cord bilirubin levels, and [[hemolytic anemia]]. It is possible for a newborn with this disease to have [[neutropenia]] and [[neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia]] as well. [[Hemolysis]] leads to elevated [[bilirubin]] levels.  After delivery bilirubin is no longer cleared (via the placenta) from the neonate's blood and the [[symptom]]s of [[jaundice]] (yellowish skin and yellow discoloration of the whites of the eyes, or [[Jaundice|icterus]]) increase within 24 hours after birth.  Like other forms of severe [[neonatal jaundice]], there is the possibility of the neonate developing acute or chronic [[kernicterus]], however the risk of kernicterus in HDN is higher because of the rapid and massive destruction of blood cells. It is important to note that isoimmunization is a risk factor for neurotoxicity and lowers the level at which kernicterus can occur. Untreated profound anemia can cause high-output [[heart failure]], with [[pallor]], [[hepatomegaly|enlarged liver]] and/or [[splenomegaly|spleen]], generalized [[edema|swelling]], and [[shortness of breath|respiratory distress]].

HDN can be the cause of [[hydrops fetalis]], an often-severe form of prenatal [[heart failure]] that causes fetal [[edema]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Complications===
Complications of HDN could include [[kernicterus]], [[hepatosplenomegaly]], inspissated (thickened or dried) bile syndrome and/or greenish staining of the [[teeth]], [[hemolytic anemia]] and damage to the liver due to excess bilirubin. Similar conditions include [[Hemolytic anemia#Acquired|acquired hemolytic anemia]], congenital [[toxoplasma]], congenital [[syphilis]] infection, congenital obstruction of the [[bile duct]], and [[cytomegalovirus]] (CMV) infection.

==Pathophysiology==
Antibodies are produced when the body is exposed to an [[antigen]] foreign to the make-up of the body.  If a mother is exposed to a foreign antigen and produces IgG (as opposed to [[Immunoglobulin M|IgM]] which does not cross the placenta), the IgG will target the antigen, if present in the fetus, and may affect it ''in utero'' and persist after delivery. The three most common models in which a woman becomes sensitized toward (i.e., produces IgG [[antibodies]] against) a particular antigen are hemorrhage, blood transfusion, and ABO incompatibility.

[[Fetal-maternal hemorrhage]], which is the movement of fetal blood cells across the placenta, can occur during [[abortion]], [[ectopic pregnancy]], [[childbirth]], ruptures in the [[placenta]] during [[pregnancy]] (often caused by trauma), or medical procedures carried out during pregnancy that breach the uterine wall. In subsequent pregnancies, if there is a similar incompatibility in the fetus, these antibodies are then able to cross the placenta into the fetal bloodstream to attach to the [[red blood cell]]s and cause their destruction ([[hemolysis]]). This is a major cause of HDN, because 75% of pregnancies result in some contact between fetal and maternal blood, and 15-50% of pregnancies have hemorrhages with the potential for immune sensitization. The amount of fetal blood needed to cause maternal sensitization depends on the individual's immune system and ranges from 0.1 mL to 30 mL.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arraut|first=Amaryllis|date=2017-03-09|year=|title=Erythrocyte Alloimmunization and Pregnancy: Overview, Background, Pathophysiology|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/273995-overview#showall|journal=Medscape|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The woman may have received a therapeutic [[blood transfusion]]. [[ABO|ABO blood group system]] and the D antigen of the [[Rh blood group system|Rhesus (Rh) blood group system]] typing are routine prior to transfusion.  Suggestions have been made that women of child-bearing age or young girls should not be given a transfusion with Rhc-positive blood or [[Kell antigen system|Kell&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]]-positive blood to avoid possible sensitization, but this would strain the resources of blood transfusion services, and it is currently considered uneconomical to screen for these blood groups.  HDFN can also be caused by antibodies to a variety of other [[blood group system]] antigens, but Kell and Rh are the most frequently encountered.

The third sensitization model can occur in women of blood type O. The [[immune response]] to A and B antigens, that are widespread in the environment, usually leads to the production of IgM or IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies early in life.  Women of blood type O are more prone than women of types A and B to making IgG anti-A and anti-B antibodies, and these IgG antibodies are able to cross the placenta. For unknown reasons, the incidence of maternal antibodies against type A and B antigens of the IgG type that could potentially cause hemolytic disease of the newborn is greater than the observed incidence of "ABO disease." About 15% of pregnancies involve a type O mother and a type A or type B child; only 3% of these pregnancies result in hemolytic disease due to A/B/O incompatibility. In contrast to antibodies to A and B antigens, Rhesus antibodies are generally not produced from exposure to environmental antigens.{{Citation needed|reason=Generally need citations in this section, but starting with this recent edit.|date=July 2014}} In cases where there is ABO incompatibility and Rh incompatibility, the risk of alloimmunization is decreased because fetal red blood cells are removed from maternal circulation due to anti-ABO antibodies before they can trigger an anti-Rh response.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Antibody Specific Information==
*Anti-D is the only preventable form of HDN. Since the 1968 introduction of Rho-D immunoglobulin, ([[Rho(D) immune globulin|Rhogam]]), which prevents the production of maternal Rho-D antibodies, the incidence of anti-D HDN has decreased dramatically.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.4103/0973-6247.75963 |pmid=21572705 |pmc=3082712 |title=Hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn: Current trends and perspectives |journal=Asian Journal of Transfusion Science |volume=5 |issue=1 |pages=3–7 |year=2011 |last1=Basu |first1=Sabita |last2=Kaur |first2=Ravneet |last3=Kaur |first3=Gagandeep }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diagnosis==
The [[diagnosis]] of HDN is based on history and laboratory findings:

''Blood tests done on the newborn baby''
* Biochemistry tests for [[jaundice]]
* Peripheral blood [[morphology (biology)|morphology]] shows increased [[reticulocyte]]s. [[Erythroblast]]s (also known as nucleated red blood cells) occur in moderate and severe disease.
* Positive [[Coombs test#Direct Coombs test|direct Coombs test]] (might be negative after fetal interuterine blood transfusion)
''Blood tests done on the mother''
* Positive [[Coombs test#Indirect Coombs test|indirect Coombs test]]
''Blood tests done on the father''
* Erythrocyte antigen status

=== Types (classified by serology) ===
Types of HDN are classified by the type of antigens involved. The main types are ABO HDN, Rhesus HDN, Kell HDN, and other antibodies. [[ABO hemolytic disease of the newborn]] can range from mild to severe, but generally it is a mild disease. It can be caused by anti-A and anti-B antibodies. [[Rhesus disease|Rhesus D hemolytic disease of the newborn]] (often called Rh disease) is the most common form of severe HDN. [[Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Rhc)|Rhesus c hemolytic disease of the newborn]] can range from a mild to severe disease - is the third most common form of severe HDN.&lt;ref name="pmid25899660"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/vox.12265 |pmid=25899660 |title=Haemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn |journal=Vox Sanguinis |volume=109 |issue=2 |pages=99–113 |year=2015 |last1=De Haas |first1=M. |last2=Thurik |first2=F. F. |last3=Koelewijn |first3=J.M. |last4=Van Der Schoot |first4=C.E. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rhesus e and rhesus C hemolytic disease of the newborn are rare. Combinations of antibodies, for example, anti-Rhc and anti-RhE occurring together can be especially severe.

[[Hemolytic disease of the newborn (anti-Kell)|Anti-Kell hemolytic disease of the newborn]] is most commonly caused by anti-K&lt;sub&gt; 1&lt;/sub&gt; antibodies, the second most common form of severe HDN. Over half of the cases of anti-K&lt;sub&gt; 1&lt;/sub&gt; related HDN are caused by multiple blood transfusions. Antibodies to the other Kell antigens are rare.&lt;ref name="pmid25899660" /&gt;

==Prevention==
In cases of Rho(D) incompatibility, Rho(D) immunoglobulin is given to prevent sensitization. However, there is no comparable immunotherapy available for other blood group incompatibilities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''Early pregnancy'''
*IVIG - IVIG stands for Intravenous Immunoglobulin. It is used in cases of previous loss, high maternal titers, known aggressive antibodies, and in cases where religion prevents blood transfusion. IVIG can be more effective than IUT alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=9085208 |year=1997 |author1=Voto |first1=L.

'''Mid- to late- pregnancy'''
*IUT - Intrauterine Transfusion (IUT) is done either by intraperitoneal transfusion (IPT) or intravenous transfusion (IVT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s40556-016-0072-4 |pmid=26811110 |title=Intrauterine Transfusion |journal=Journal of Fetal Medicine |volume=27 |issue=3 |pages=505 |year=2016 |last1=Deka |first1=Dipika }}&lt;/ref&gt; IVT is preferred over IPT.&lt;ref name=emedicine273995&gt;{{EMedicine|article|273995|Erythrocyte Alloimmunization and Pregnancy}}&lt;/ref&gt;  IUTs are only done until 35 weeks.

Rhesus-negative mothers who are pregnant with a rhesus-positive infant are offered Rho(D) immune [[globulin]] (RhIG, or RhoGam) at 28 weeks during pregnancy, at 34 weeks, and within 48 hours after delivery to prevent sensitization to the D antigen. It works by binding any fetal red blood cells with the D antigen before the mother is able to produce an immune response and form anti-D IgG.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; A drawback to pre-partum administration of RhIG is that it causes a positive antibody screen when the mother is tested, which can be difficult to distinguish from natural immunological responses that result in antibody production.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}  Without Rho(D) immunoglobulin, the risk of isoimmunization is approximately 17%; with proper administration the risk is reduced to less than 0.1-0.2%.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==After Birth Testing==
*Coombs - after birth baby will have a direct Coombs test run to confirm the antibodies attached to the infant’s red blood cells. This test is run on the infant's cord blood.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/adc.2005.076794 |pmid=17337672 |pmc=2675453 |title=Haemolytic disease of the newborn |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=92 |issue=2 |pages=F83–8 |year=2007 |last1=Murray |first1=N. A |last2=Roberts |first2=I. A G }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In some cases, the direct Coombs will be negative but severe, even fatal HDN can occur.&lt;ref name=pmid7655573/&gt; An indirect Coombs needs to be run in cases of anti-C,&lt;ref name=emedicine974349workup/&gt; anti-c,&lt;ref name=emedicine974349workup/&gt; and anti-M. Infants with Anti-M are also recommended to receive antigen testing to rule out the presence of HDN.&lt;ref name=pmid25722586/&gt;
*Hgb - the infant’s hemoglobin should be tested from cord blood.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672/&gt;
*Reticulocyte count - Reticulocytes are elevated when the infant is producing more red blood cells in response to anemia.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672/&gt;  A rise in the retic count can mean that an infant may not need additional transfusions.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | chapter-url = https://www.ucsfbenioffchildrens.org/pdf/manuals/42_Hemol.pdf | format = PDF | chapter = Hemolytic Disease of the Newborn | pages = 121–124 | title = Intensive Care Nursery House Staff Manual | publisher = Children's Hospital at [[UCSF Medical Center|University of California, San Francisco, Medical Center]] | access-date = 23 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low retic is observed in infants treated with IUT and in those with HDN from anti-Kell.&lt;ref name=emedicine974349workup/&gt;
*Neutrophils - as neutropenia is one of the complications of HDN, the neutrophil count should be checked.&lt;ref name=pmid2494315&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=2494315 |year=1989 |author1=Koenig |first1=J. M. |title=Neutropenia and thrombocytopenia in infants with Rh hemolytic disease |journal=The Journal of Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=4 Pt 1 |pages=625–31 |last2=Christensen |first2=R. D. |doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(89)80709-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pmid14413526/&gt;
*Thrombocytes - as thrombocytopenia is one of the complications of HDN, the thrombocyte count should be checked.&lt;ref name=pmid2494315/&gt;
*Bilirubin should be tested from cord blood.&lt;ref name=pmid17337672/&gt;
*Ferritin - because most infants affected by HDN have iron overload, a ferritin must be run before giving the infant any additional iron.&lt;ref name=pmid23802744&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/vox.12061 |pmid=23802744 |title=Iron status in infants with alloimmune haemolytic disease in the first three months of life |journal=Vox Sanguinis |volume=105 |issue=4 |pages=328–33 |year=2013 |last1=Rath |first1=M. E. A. |last2=Smits-Wintjens |first2=V. E. H. J. |last3=Oepkes |first3=D. |last4=Walther |first4=F. J. |last5=Lopriore |first5=E. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Newborn Screening Tests - Transfusion with donor blood during pregnancy or shortly after birth can affect the results of the Newborn Screening Tests. It is recommended to wait and retest 10–12 months after last transfusion. In some cases, DNA testing from saliva can be used to rule out certain conditions.

==Treatment==
After birth, treatment depends on the severity of the condition, but could include temperature stabilization and monitoring, [[phototherapy]], transfusion with compatible packed red blood, [[exchange transfusion]] with a [[blood type]] compatible with both the infant and the mother, [[sodium bicarbonate]] for correction of [[acidosis]] and/or assisted ventilation.
*Phototherapy - Exposure to ultraviolet light (phototherapy) is recommended when the cord bilirubin is 3 or higher. Some doctors use it at lower levels while awaiting lab results.&lt;ref name=pmid15231951&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=15231951 |url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=15231951 |year=2004 |author1=American Academy of Pediatrics Subcommittee on Hyperbilirubinemia. |title=Management of hyperbilirubinemia in the newborn infant 35 or more weeks of gestation |journal=Pediatrics |volume=114 |issue=1 |pages=297–316 |doi=10.1542/peds.114.1.297}}&lt;/ref&gt; This converts conjugated bilirubin to an unconjugated form that is easier for the infant to clear.
*IVIG - IVIG has been used to successfully treat many cases of HDN. It has been used not only on anti-D, but on anti-E as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.3109/14767050903544751 |pmid=20092394 |title=Intravenous Immunoglobulin therapy for anti-E hemolytic disease in the newborn |journal=The Journal of Maternal-Fetal &amp; Neonatal Medicine |volume=23 |issue=9 |pages=1059–61 |year=2010 |last1=Onesimo |first1=Roberta |last2=Rizzo |first2=Daniela |last3=Ruggiero |first3=Antonio |last4=Valentini |first4=Piero }}&lt;/ref&gt; IVIG can be used to reduce the need for exchange transfusion and to shorten the length of phototherapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1136/fn.88.1.F6 |pmid=12496219 |pmc=1755998 |title=Systematic review of intravenous immunoglobulin in haemolytic disease of the newborn |journal=Archives of Disease in Childhood: Fetal and Neonatal Edition |volume=88 |issue=1 |pages=F6–10 |year=2003 |last1=Gottstein |first1=R }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AAP recommends "In isoimmune hemolytic disease, administration of intravenousγ-globulin (0.5-1 g/kg over 2 hours) is recommended if the TSB is rising despite intensive phototherapy or the TSB level is within 2 to 3 mg/dL (34-51 μmol/L) of the exchange level. If necessary, this dose can be repeated in 12 hours (evidence quality B: benefits exceed harms). Intravenous γ-globulin has been shown to reduce the need for exchange transfusions in Rh and ABO hemolytic disease."&lt;ref name=pmid15231951/&gt;
*Exchange transfusion - Exchange transfusion is used when bilirubin reaches either the high or medium risk lines on the nonogram provided by the American Academy of Pediatrics (Figure 4).&lt;ref name=pmid15231951/&gt; Cord bilirubin &gt;4 is also indicative of the need for exchange transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|974349|Hemolytic Disease of Newborn|followup}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transfusion Reactions==
Once a woman has antibodies, she is at high risk for a future transfusion reaction if she is in need of a blood transfusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1159/000154811 |pmid=21512623 |pmc=3076326 |title=Hemolytic Transfusion Reactions |journal=Transfusion Medicine and Hemotherapy |volume=35 |issue=5 |pages=346–353 |year=2008 |last1=Strobel |first1=Erwin }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, she must carry a medical alert card at all times and inform all doctors and emergency personnel of her antibody status. The absence of antibodies however does not preclude a woman from having a transfusion reaction:

"Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions may be either immune-mediated or nonimmune-mediated. Immune-mediated hemolytic transfusion reactions caused by immunoglobulin M (IgM) anti-A, anti-B, or anti-A,B typically result in severe, potentially fatal complement-mediated intravascular hemolysis. Immune-mediated hemolytic reactions caused by IgG, Rh, Kell, Duffy, or other non-ABO antibodies typically result in extravascular sequestration, shortened survival of transfused red cells, and relatively mild clinical reactions. Acute hemolytic transfusion reactions due to immune hemolysis may occur in patients who have no antibodies detectable by routine laboratory procedures."&lt;ref&gt;{{EMedicine|article|206885|Transfusion Reactions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For a summary of transfusion reactions in the US, see reference.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/TransfusionDonationFatalities/ucm302847.htm | dead-url = yes | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121111181642/http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/SafetyAvailability/ReportaProblem/TransfusionDonationFatalities/ucm302847.htm | archive-date = 11 November 2012 | title = Fatalities Reported to FDA Following Blood Collection and Transfusion: Annual Summary for Fiscal Year 2011 | date = 8 May 2012 | work = Vaccines, Blood &amp; Biologics | publisher = U.S. [[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Epidemiology ==
In 2003, the incidence of Rh(D) sensitization in the United States was 6.8 per 1000 live births; 0.27% of women with an Rh incompatible fetus experience alloimmunization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:Title-page of 1658 edition of 'Urn-Burial' and 'The Garden of Cyrus'.jpg|thumb|right|Title-page of 1658 edition of ''Urn-Burial'' together with ''The Garden of Cyrus'']]
'''''Hydriotaphia, Urn Burial, or, a Discourse of the Sepulchral Urns lately found in Norfolk''''' is a work by Sir [[Thomas Browne]], published in 1658 as the first part of a two-part work that concludes with ''[[The Garden of Cyrus]]''.

Its nominal subject was the discovery of a [[Ancient Rome|Roman]]&lt;ref&gt;The Major Works ed. C. A. Patrides Penguin 1977&lt;/ref&gt; [[urn]] [[burial]] in [[Norfolk]]. The discovery of these remains prompts Browne to deliver, first, a description of the antiquities found, and then a survey of most of the burial and [[funerary]] [[convention (norm)|customs]], ancient and current, of which his era was aware.

The most famous part of the work is the apotheosis of the fifth chapter, where Browne declaims –

''But man is a Noble Animal, splendid in ashes, and pompous in the grave, solemnizing Nativities and Deaths with equal lustre, nor omitting Ceremonies of bravery, in the infamy of his nature. Life is a pure flame, and we live by an invisible Sun within us.''

==Influence==
''Urn Burial'' has been admired by [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]], [[Samuel Johnson]], [[John Cowper Powys]], [[James Joyce]], [[Jorge Luis Borges]], [[Derek Walcott]], and [[George Saintsbury]], who called it "the longest piece, perhaps, of absolutely sublime rhetoric to be found in the prose literature of the world", while [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] said that it "smells in every word of the [[sepulchre]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Journals of Ralph Waldo Emerson: with annotations, Volume 1''&lt;/ref&gt; Browne's text is alluded to in [[W. G. Sebald]]'s novel ''[[The Rings of Saturn]]''.&lt;ref&gt;In chapters 1 and 10 of ''[[The Rings of Saturn]]'' [[W. G. Sebald]] Harvill Press 1998&lt;/ref&gt; It is also cited by [[Penelope Lively]] to furnish the title of her novel ''Treasures of Time'' and in the text (Ch 3). The English composer [[William Alwyn]] wrote his Symphony No. 5, subtitled ''Hydriotaphia'', in homage to Browne's imagery and rhythmic prose. The America composer [[Douglas J. Cuomo]]'s ''The Fate of His Ashes: Requiem for Victims of Power'' for chorus and organ takes its text from ''Urn Burial.'' Derek Walcott uses an excerpt as the epigraph to his poem "Ruins of a Great House."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.poetryarchive.org/poem/ruins-great-house|title=Ruins of a Great House {{!}} poetryarchive.org|website=www.poetryarchive.org|language=en|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Alain de Botton]] references the work in his book ''[[Status Anxiety]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Status Anxiety|last = de Botton|first = Alain|publisher = Vintage International|year = 2004|isbn = 9780375725357|location = |pages = 228–229}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borges refers to it in the final line of his short story "[[Tlön, Uqbar, Orbis Tertius]]". It also appears in the novel ''[[Sanshirō (novel)|Sanshirō]]'', written by [[Natsume Sōseki]]; Hirota-sensei lent the book to Sanshirô.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4597">'''Infant bathing''' is the practice and activity of [[cleaning]] an [[infant]] by [[bathing]]. It has been characterized as being "fun", but [[infant and toddler safety|care]] is recommended when an infant is in or around water. Most [[drowning]] deaths in children happen at home, often when a child is left alone while bathing.

==Accident prevention==
Bathing [[accident]]s can occur. Often these can be prevented. Recommendations include:

* Staying close enough to children who are in the tub so that they can reach out for [[Sense of balance|stability]].
* Using  non-skid decals or a [[mat]] inside the tub to prevent [[slipping]].
* Using toys in the tub to keep your child busy and sitting down, and away from the faucet.
* Keeping the [[temperature]] of your [[water heater]] below 120°F (48.9°C) to prevent burns.
* Keeping all sharp objects, such as [[razors]] and [[scissors]], out of your child's reach.
* Unplugging all electric items, such as [[hair dryer]] and [[radio]]s.
* Emptying the tub after bath time is over.
* Keeping the floor and your child's feet dry to prevent slipping.&lt;ref name = NIHbath&gt;{{cite web|url=https://medlineplus.gov/ency/patientinstructions/000020.htm|title=Bathing an infant: MedlinePlus Medical Encyclopedia|website=medlineplus.gov|accessdate=25 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/childbirth-and-beyond/newborn-care-and-safety|title=Newborn care and safety - womenshealth.gov|website=womenshealth.gov}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A baby bath tub with a non-skid design is safe. If the water is deeper than a few inches, the baby may slip into the water and could possibly drown. An infant can easily slip under the water. The infant can be burned if the water temperature is too hot. How often an infant is bathed is a decision made by the parents or caregivers. Two or three times a week is sufficient. Infants can have sensitive skin and mild soap is best. Keeping all towels and soap within reach allows the parent or caregiver to keep a constant eye on the infant. Shampooing with water alone is adequate. Parents or caregivers may wish to be trained in CPR.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parents.com/baby/safety/bathroom/water-safety-tips/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bathing practices==
Care during infant bathing will maintain infant health. Caregivers can:

* Have a towel ready to wrap the infant in to dry and keep warm after the bath.&lt;ref name = NIHbath/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lang N, Bromiker R, Arad I | title = The effect of wool vs. cotton head covering and length of stay with the mother following delivery on infant temperature | journal = International Journal of Nursing Studies | volume = 41 | issue = 8 | pages = 843–846 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15476757 | doi = 10.1016/j.ijnurstu.2004.03.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keep the infant's umbilical cord dry.
* Use warm, not hot, water. The water can be tested to check the temperature by placing an elbow under the water.
* Wash the baby's head last so that their head does not get too cold.&lt;ref name = NIHbath/&gt;

==Safety while in the washroom==
Besides safe bathing practices, an infant, toddler or child may be unsafe when unsupervised in a bathroom or washroom. Safe practices are:

* Storing medicines in the child-proof containers they came in. 
* Keeping the medicine cabinet locked.
* Keeping cleaning products out of reach of children.
* Keeping bathroom doors closed when they are not being used so the child cannot get in.
* Placing a door knob cover over the outside door handle.
* Not leaving the child alone in the room.
* Placing a lid lock on the toilet seat to keep a curious toddler from drowning.&lt;ref name = NIHbath/&gt;

The '''International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis''' ('''IIASA''') is an international research organization located in [[Laxenburg]], near [[Vienna]], in [[Austria]]. IIASA conducts [[interdisciplinary]] scientific studies on [[natural environment|environmental]], [[economic]], [[technological]] and [[social issues]] in the context of human dimensions of [[global change]]. IIASA’s mission is "to provide insights and guidance to policymakers worldwide by finding solutions to global and universal problems through applied systems analysis in order to improve human and social wellbeing and to protect the environment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA%20Strategic%20Plan%202011-20201.pdf IIASA's New Strategic Plan 2011-2020], retrieved 2 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
IIASA brings its experience of managing international tensions through science to today's [[global issue]]s. Its multinational and multidisciplinary teams of researchers have a growing membership, now including the world's four largest economies.

The institute is currently directed by [https://web.archive.org/web/20110716175200/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/director.html?sb=1 Pavel Kabat]. [[Nebojsa Nakicenovic]] is the current Deputy Director General/ Deputy CEO.  Past directors have included  [[Howard Raiffa]], professor at [[Harvard]]'s [[Harvard Business School|Business School]] and [[Kennedy School of Government]], Roger Levien, former Vice President for Strategy at [[Xerox]], [https://web.archive.org/web/20110123131844/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/uploads/fileadmin/H00/hordijk_CV-IES.pdf Leen Hordijk], former Director at the [https://web.archive.org/web/20100414042251/http://ies.jrc.ec.europa.eu/index.php Institute for Environment and Sustainability], Joint Research Centre, European Commission, Ispra, Italy, and Detlof von Winterfeldt, professor at the [[University of Southern California]].&lt;ref&gt;http://en.www.mcu.es/bibliotecas/docs/MC/2012/CongresoBP/leviening.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA is a non-governmental institution funded by scientific organizations in its member countries, which currently include: Australia, Austria, Brazil, China, Egypt, Finland, Germany, India, Indonesia, Japan, Malaysia, the Netherlands, Norway, Pakistan, Republic of Korea, Russia, South Africa, Sweden, Ukraine, and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html IIASA's National Member Organizations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050627082900/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/Admin/DI/docs/IIASA_NMO.html |date=27 June 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Funding for the Institute also comes from contracts, grants, and donations from governments, international organizations, academia, business, and individuals.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/funding/funding.html IIASA Funding]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 4{{nbsp}}October 1972 representatives of the [[Soviet Union]], [[United States]], and 10 other countries from the Eastern and Western blocs met at [[The Royal Society]] in [[London]] to sign the charter establishing IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;Profile of IISA appended to summary of "Energy in a Finite World" (1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt; It was the culmination of six years’ effort driven forward by both the US President [[Lyndon Johnson]] and the USSR Premier [[Alexei Kosygin]]. For IIASA it was the beginning of a remarkable project to use scientific cooperation to build bridges across the [[Cold War]] divide and to confront growing global problems on a truly international scale.&lt;ref&gt;McDONALD, A. (1998), Scientific Cooperation as a Bridge Across the Cold War Divide: The Case of the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) . Annals of the New York Academy of Sciences, 866: 55–83. doi: 10.1111/j.1749-6632.1998.tb09147.x&lt;/ref&gt; The first scientist had arrived at IIASA in June, 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Jermen Gvishiani and Roger E. Lewis in Foreword to "Energy in a Finite World"(1981) http://www.iiasa.ac.at/publication/more_XB-81-202.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Clearly, success at bridge building and successful science would go hand in hand. But neither was a foregone conclusion. This was the 1970s, and most research organizations focused on national issues. Few encouraged researchers from different countries or disciplines to work together for the greater good.

To achieve its ambitious research vision, IIASA would have to break down the barriers between nations and disciplines. This it did, building international multidisciplinary teams to confront innumerable global challenges, both long-standing and emerging.   For example, a study on water pollution carried out in the 1980s by a team of IIASA chemists, biologists, and economists still forms the basis of modern water policy design in Japan, USA, and the former USSR.

When the [[Cold War]] ended (in 1991), IIASA’s sponsoring countries could have said “mission accomplished” and disbanded the Institute. IIASA had certainly helped foster mutual understanding among scientists from East and West. But it had also done more than this. IIASA had shown the scientific benefits of bringing together different nationalities and disciplines to work toward common goals.  Indeed, this approach has been widely imitated, for example, in the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] and the [[International Geosphere-Biosphere Programme]].

So instead of closing in the 1990s the Institute broadened its mandate from the East and West to a truly global focus.  Today IIASA brings together a wide range of scientific skills to provide science-based insights into critical policy issues in international and national debates on global change.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iiasa.ac.at/docs/history_short.html?sb=3 A Brief History of IIASA], retrieved 2 May 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current research ==
IIASA research focuses on complex problems that extend beyond a single country or a single discipline.

In 2010, IIASA launched a new strategic plan for the next ten years, which focuses on three general problem areas: Energy and Climate Change, Food and Water, and Poverty and Equity.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Research.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Every year approximately 200 researchers from over 35 countries research at IIASA.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/whatisiiasa/informationkit/flyer-iiasa.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; They work on these broader topics within and across 9 research programs: Advanced Systems Analysis, Ecosystems Services and Management, Energy, Evolution and Ecology, Mitigation of Air Pollution and Greenhouse Gases, Risk, Policy and Vulnerability, Transitions to New Technologies, Water, and World Population.

'''Major Projects'''

Ten IIASA scientists were among the authors of the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (the work of the IPCC, including the contributions of many scientists, was recognised by the joint award of the [[2007 Nobel Peace Prize|2007]] [[Nobel Peace Prize]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203000256/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/about/achievments/iiasaandthenobelprize/ipcc/IPCC.en.html |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Global Energy Assessment, released in 2012.  The report was a result of collaborative and integrated work of over 500 authors, analysts and reviewers worldwide who contributed independent, scientifically based and policy-relevant analysis of current and emerging energy issues and options. The assessment provides a thorough assessment of energy-related issues including sustainable development, including poverty eradication, climate change mitigation, health, energy security and energy access.&lt;ref&gt;GEA, 2012: [http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Flagship-Projects/Global-Energy-Assessment/Home-GEA.en.html Global Energy Assessment] - Toward a Sustainable Future, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, UK and New York, NY, USA and the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis, Laxenburg, Austria.&lt;/ref&gt; The entire assessment is available online as a PDF.

The Water Futures and Solutions: World Water Scenarios initiative, launched in 2012, aims to provide a similarly broad assessment of global water challenges, in much the same scope as the Global Energy Assessment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140115120757/http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/Global-Water-Futures-and-Solutions--World-Water-Scen.en.html |archivedate=15 January 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

IIASA researchers are major contributors to Working Groups II and III of the [[IPCC Fifth Assessment Report]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iiasa.ac.at/web/home/research/ResearchPartners/Climate-Change---IPCC-Fifth-Assessment-Report-.en.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2010, IIASA is also one of the three ''"pillar institutions"'' of the [[Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://derstandard.at/1295571237693/Ehrgeizig-Wiener-Wittgenstein-Center-will-an-Spitze-der-Demographie-Institute ''Der Standard'', 31 January 2011: “Vienna Wittgenstein Centre aims for top position among demography institutes worldwide”]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Mason Hutchings.jpg|thumb|Portrait c.1888]]

'''James Mason Hutchings''' (February 10, 1820 &amp;ndash; October 31, 1902) was an [[United States|American]] businessman and one of the principal promoters of what is now [[Yosemite National Park]].

Born in [[England]], Hutchings immigrated to the U.S. in 1848, then went to [[California]] in 1849 during the [[Gold Rush]]. He became wealthy as a miner, lost it all in a bank failure, then became wealthy again from publishing.

In 1853, he published "''The Miner's Ten Commandments''".&lt;ref&gt;[https://cdn.loc.gov/master/rbc/rbpe/rbpe00/rbpe002/00200300/001da.tif Image of "The Miner's Ten Commandments", (Placerville, California), 1853, ''Library of Congress: Printed Ephemera Collection''.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 5, 1855 James Hutchings set out on what would be one of the most historic trips to the region, leading the second tourist party into [[Yosemite]].&lt;ref&gt;Kruska, David (2012). ''Touring Yosemite'' exhibit Catalog. Hannold/Mudd Library of the [[Claremont Colleges]]. pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt; (The first tourist party, in 1854, was led by Robert C. Lamon, but no account of the trip is known to be written.) He then became one of the first settlers in Yosemite Valley. Hutchings published an illustrated magazine, ''[[Hutchings' Illustrated California Magazine]]'' that told the world about Yosemite and the Sierra. It was said "...upon the return of Hutchings' party, the descriptions staggered the skeptics and silenced the croakers. From this time forward can be considered the commencement of the visits of tourists." He was a tireless promoter, of himself and Yosemite. After Yosemite Valley was dedicated as [[State Park]] in 1864, Hutchings, through his interpretation of existing [[Preemption (land) |preemption laws]], believed he was entitled to 160 acres (647,000 m²) of land in the Valley. He sued, unsuccessfully, to have those acres deeded to himself. He did, however, get a generous payment from the state to help compensate for loss of land use. In 1875, he was banished from Yosemite Valley because of his constant challenging of the law prohibiting the construction of buildings on public lands.

Hutchings remarried twice and was an innkeeper for the Calaveras Big Tree Grove Hotel, north of Yosemite. Hutchings' prominence in Yosemite Valley allowed him to connect with figures of great importance to the history of Yosemite, including [[John Muir]], [[Galen Clark]] and [[James McCauley]].

While visiting Yosemite, Hutchings was killed on October 31, 1902 when his horse reared and threw him from his buggy.

The '''Japanese submarine ''I-28''''' was one of 20 [[Type B submarine|Type B]] [[cruiser submarine]]s of the B1 [[ship class|sub-class]] built for the [[Imperial Japanese Navy]] (IJN) during the 1940s.

==Design and description==
The Type B submarines were derived from the earlier KD6 sub-class of the {{Sclass-|Kaidai|submarine|4}} and were equipped with an aircraft to enhance their scouting ability. They [[Displacement (ship)|displaced]] {{Convert|2589|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} surfaced and {{Convert|3654|LT|t|0|disp=flip}} submerged. The submarines were {{convert|108.7|m|ftin|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|9.3|m|ftin|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|5.1|m|ftin|sp=us}}. They had a diving depth of {{convert|100|m|ft|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 189&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two {{convert|6200|bhp|lk=in|0|adj=on}} [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]]. When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|1000|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|23.6|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|8|kn}} underwater.&lt;ref name=c5&gt;Chesneau, p. 200&lt;/ref&gt; On the surface, the ''B1''s had a range of {{convert|14000|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|16|kn}}; submerged, they had a range of {{convert|96|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|3|kn}}.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal bow {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s and carried a total of 17 [[torpedo]]es. They were also armed with a single [[14 cm/40 11th Year Type naval gun|{{convert|140|mm|in|abbr=on}}/40]] [[deck gun]] and two single mounts for [[Type 96 25 mm AT/AA Gun|{{convert|25|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} Type 96]] [[anti-aircraft gun]]s.&lt;ref name=cd3&gt;Carpenter &amp; Dorr, p. 102&lt;/ref&gt; In the Type Bs, the aircraft [[hangar]] was faired into the base of the [[conning tower]]. A single [[Aircraft catapult|catapult]] was positioned on the forward deck.&lt;ref name=cd3/&gt;
 
==Construction and career==
''I-28'' was commissioned at [[Kobe, Japan]] on February 6, 1942.  The submarine participated in the [[Battle of the Coral Sea]] in May 1942.  Returning to base at [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]] in the central Pacific, ''I-28''  was torpedoed and sunk with all hands (88 officers and men) by the [[United States Navy]] submarine {{USS|Tautog|SS-199|2}} at {{coord|06|30|N|152|00|E|display=title, inline}} on 17 May 1942.

==Life==
Dr. Seymour was born in Plymouth England in 1958 and qualified in Biochemistry at the [[University of Manchester]]. He later formed a research group focused on gene delivery at the Cancer Research UK Institute in [[Birmingham]], and then relocated to the [[University of Oxford]] in 2003 as Gene Therapy lead for the National Translational Cancer Research Network (NTRAC). There, he took part in forming the British Society for Gene Therapy (BSCGT) as a means to build the translational gene and cell therapy community within the UK.&lt;ref&gt;Seymour LW; Steering Executive Committee of the British Society for Gene Therapy, Trial and error, Lancet, 2003;361(9368):1568.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Seymour served as the first President of the BSGCT from 2003–2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/commentators/len-seymour-this-is-only-the-beginning-of-what-gene-therapy-can-do-816630.html|title=Len Seymour: This is only the beginning of what gene therapy can do|date=28 April 2008|website=independent.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; currently serves as the General Secretary of the [[ESGCT|European Society for Gene and Cell Therapy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.esgct.eu/about-esgct/board-members.aspx|title=Board Members|website=www.esgct.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; is indexed in Who's Who,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whoswho/U245493/SEYMOUR_Prof._Leonard_William?index=1&amp;results=QuicksearchResults&amp;query=0|title=Seymour, Prof. Leonard William, (born 4 Sept. 1958), Professor of Gene Therapies, University of Oxford, since 2002 (Head, Department of Clinical Pharmacology, 2009–10) - WHO'S WHO &amp; WHO WAS WHO|website=ukwhoswho.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has produced approximately 140 primary scientific publications.

With Dr. Kerry Fisher, Dr. Seymour formed a biotech spinout company 'Hybrid Systems'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.beremans.com/pdf/BACR_interview_3.pdf |title=Interview |website=beremans.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; which later became ‘PsiOxus Therapeutics Ltd’, with Cancer Research UK and the University of Birmingham. PsiOxus is now developing a cancer-killing 'oncolytic' group B adenovirus '[[Oncolytic adenovirus|ColoAd1]]' in a series of clinical trials to treat cancer. More recently with Dr. Ryan Cawood, Dr. Seymour formed the plasmid expression company [[Oxford Genetics]], aiming to enable major improvements in the efficiency of genetic engineering and synthetic biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9864">'''Love bombing''' is an attempt to [[social influence|influence]] a person by demonstrations of attention and affection. It can be used in different ways and can be used for either a positive or negative purpose. Members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] (who reportedly coined the expression) use it to convey a genuine expression of friendship, fellowship, interest, or concern.&lt;ref name = Richardson2004/&gt; [[Anti-cult movement|Critics of cults]] use the phrase with the implication that the "[[love]]" is feigned and that the practice is [[psychological manipulation]] in order to create a feeling of unity within the group against a society perceived as hostile.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis Tourish and [[Tim Wohlforth]], ''[[On the Edge (book)|On the Edge: Political Cults Right and Left]]'', Armonk, NY: M.E. Sharpe, 2000, page 19.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have identified love bombing as a possible part of a [[cycle of abuse]] and have warned against it. In 2011 clinical psychologist [[Oliver James (psychologist)|Oliver James]] advocated love bombing in his book ''Love Bombing: Reset Your Child's Emotional Thermostat'', as a means for parents to rectify emotional problems in their children.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2012/sep/22/oliver-james-love-bombing-children All you need is love bombing], ''[[The Guardian]]'', September 21, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
==Origin of the term==
The expression "love bombing" was coined by members of the [[Unification Church of the United States]] in the 1970s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/mdtaskforce/loomis_testimony.htm| title=1999 Testimony of Ronald N. Loomis to the Maryland Cult Task Force| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040818214228/http://religiousmovements.lib.virginia.edu/cultsect/mdtaskforce/loomis_testimony.htm| archivedate=2004-08-18| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was also used by members of the [[Family International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/688317.stm| title=Eyewitness: Why people join cults | work=BBC News | date=March 24, 2000 | accessdate=January 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.exfamily.org/art/exmem/debdavis/debdavis07.shtml| title=The Children of God: The Inside Story}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1978 [[Sun Myung Moon]], the founder and then leader of the Unification Church, said:
:Unification Church members are smiling all of the time, even at four in the morning. The man who is full of love must live that way. When you go out witnessing you can caress the wall and say that it can expect you to witness well and be smiling when you return. What face could better represent love than a smiling face? This is why we talk about love bomb; Moonies have that kind of happy problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.unification.net/1978/780723.html| title=Sun Myung Moon (1978) "We Who Have Been Called To Do God's Work" Speech in London, England}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Anthropology]] professor&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/ggalant/ [[California State University]] profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020617171034/http://web.calstatela.edu/faculty/ggalant/ |date=2002-06-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Geri-Ann Galanti writes: 
:A basic human need is for self-esteem.... Basically [love bombing] consists of giving someone a lot of positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Langone|Langone, Michael]], ''[[Recovery from Cults]]'', 1995, [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]], {{ISBN|0-393-31321-2}}, Chapter 3 - Reflections on "Brainwashing", Geri-Ann Galanti&lt;/ref&gt;

==Margaret Singer==
Psychology professor [[Margaret Singer]] popularized the concept.&lt;ref name = Richardson2004&gt;
{{cite book|title=Regulating Religion: Case Studies from Around the Globe|first=James T.|last=Richardson|year=2004|publisher=Springer|isbn=0-306-47887-0}} [https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0306478870&amp;id=BhscdzDrCfQC&amp;pg=RA1-PA479&amp;lpg=RA1-PA479&amp;ots=6UklwjTgL4&amp;sig=3rVP7IlUYiV5ka-m8neGZmRmdfA p. 479]&lt;/ref&gt; In her 1996 book, ''[[Cults in Our Midst]],'' she writes:
:As soon as any interest is shown by the recruits, they may be ''love bombed'' by the recruiter or other cult members. This process of feigning friendship and interest in the recruit was originally associated with one of the early youth cults, but soon it was taken up by a number of groups as part of their program for luring people in. Love bombing is a coordinated effort, usually under the direction of leadership, that involves long-term members' flooding recruits and newer members with flattery, verbal seduction, affectionate but usually nonsexual touching, and lots of attention to their every remark. Love bombing - or the offer of instant companionship - is a deceptive ploy accounting for many successful recruitment drives.&lt;ref&gt;Singer, Margaret (1996; 2003) ''Cults in Our Midst.'' Revised edition, 2003. Wiley. {{ISBN|0-7879-6741-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abusive relationships==
The expression has also been used to describe the tactics used by [[pimps]] and [[Gang|gang members]] to [[Abusive power and control|control]] their victims,&lt;ref&gt;''Gangs and Girls: Understanding Juvenile Prostitution'', Michel Dorais, Patrice Corriveau, McGill-Queen's Press - MQUP, Jan 1, 2009, page 38&lt;/ref&gt; as well as to describe the behavior of an abusive [[Narcissistic personality disorder|narcissist]] who tries to win the confidence of a victim.&lt;ref&gt;[http://narcissistsupport.com/red-flag-2-love-bombing/ Red Flag of a Narcissist #1: Love Bombing] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150823040834/http://narcissistsupport.com/red-flag-2-love-bombing/ |date=2015-08-23 }}; [https://www.firstwivesworld.com/index.php/my-narcissistic-ex-husband/item/8959-what-is-love-bombing? My Narcissistic Ex-Husband]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC News 16 February 2017"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-beds-bucks-herts-38989935|title= Helen Bailey murder trial: Ian Stewart 'grossly deceived' author|author= &lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 16 February 2017|website= [[BBC News Online]] |publisher= BBC | accessdate= 22 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern [[social media]] can intensify the effect of love bombing since it enables the abuser with nearly constant contact and communication with the victim.&lt;ref name = “archer”/&gt; 

One of the signs of love bombing in the start of a relationship is much attention in short time, and pressure for very rapid commitment.&lt;ref name = “Businessinsider”&gt;Lindsay Dodgson, [http://www.businessinsider.com/what-is-love-bombing-2017-7 what is love bombing?], [[Business Insider]], July 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  It is often the first sign of narcissism, and if successful turns to control and degradation.&lt;ref name =  “wong”&gt;Brittany Wong, [http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/03/30/sorry-youre-in-love-with-a-narcissist-_n_6956408.html Nine signs you are in love with a narcisist], [[Huffington Post]], March 30, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  Psychologist [[Dale Archer]] identifies "The Phases of Love Bombing:  [[Idealization and devaluation|Idealization, Devaluation]], Discard (Repeat)."  He advises: "Stop, Look, and Listen" to avoid love bombing and to break off contact with the abuser, if possible, and seek support from family and friends.&lt;ref name = “archer”/&gt;

==Benign occurrences==
Excessive attention and affection does not constitute love bombing if there is no intent or pattern of further abuse.  Archer explains: 
:The key to understanding how love bombing differs from romantic courtship is to look at what happens next, after two people are officially a couple. If extravagant displays of affection continue indefinitely, if actions match words, and there is no devaluation phase, then it’s probably not love bombing. That much attention might get annoying after a while, but it’s not unhealthy in and of itself.&lt;ref name = “archer”&gt;[[Dale Archer]], [https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/reading-between-the-headlines/201703/the-manipulative-partners-most-devious-tactic The manipulative partner’s most devious tactic], [[Psychology Today]], March 6, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2010s British author and psychologist Oliver James recommended love bombing as a technique for parents to help their troubled children. He described it as, “dedicating one-on-one time spoiling and lavishing your child with love, and, within reason, pandering to their every wish.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/love-bombing-kids-to-get-happy-results/story-fn6b3v4f-1226009612216 Love bombing kids to get happy results], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', February 22, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/features/over-to-you-kid/story-e6frg8h6-1226585874865# 'Love bombing' reminds parents how much fun it is to be with kids], ''[[The Australian]]'', March 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter for ''[[The Daily Express]]'' tried the technique with her son and reported:
:It’s not rocket science that showering a child with affection will impact positively on their behaviour but what surprised me was how much my behaviour changed. Love bombing enabled me to see my child through a fresh lens, my disposition towards him softened and he seemed to bask in the glow of positive attention.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/expressyourself/255817/It-took-one-day-to-change-my-son-s-bad-behaviour It took one day to change my son’s bad behaviour], ''[[The Daily Express]]'', June 30, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2479">'''Macroethics''' (from the Greek prefix "makros-" meaning "large" and "ethos" meaning character) is a term coined in the late 20th century to distinguish large-scale ethics from individual ethics, or [[microethics]].&lt;ref&gt;Vallero D.A. (2007). Beyond responsible conduct in research: new pedagogies to address macroethics of [[nanobiotechnologies]]. J Long Term Eff Med Implants. 2007;17(1):1-12.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[applied ethics]]. For example, emerging technologies present both macroethical and microethical challenges. A microethical decision related to nanotechnology would be that a researcher ensures that all experiments be conducted with integrity and results reported honestly and completely. A macroethical decision would be whether certain types of nanotechnologies be avoided until there is sufficient information regarding their risks. An extreme example of macroethical failure is the [[grey goo]] scenario.

The major emphasis in [[biomedicine]], engineering and other technical professions to date has been on issues within a particular profession, with insufficient attention to larger societal problems.&lt;ref&gt;Bassingthwaighte J.B. The macro-ethics of genomics to health: the physiome project. Comptes Rendus Biologies. 2003 Oct-Nov;326(10-11):1105-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmaceuticals present particular macroethical challenges. Drug designers seek to prevent and treatment diseases by modifying of stem cells and producing targeting drugs that have specific targeting mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;Herkert, J.R. (2004). Microethics, Macroethics, and Professional Engineering Societies. In National Academy of Engineering, Emerging Technologies and Ethical Issues in Engineering: Papers from a Workshop, October 14–15, 2003. {{ISBN|978-0-309-09271-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these technological advances must be balanced possible contravening risks (e.g. side effects, transgenerational adverse impacts in progeny, and unwanted genetic expressions), as well as ethical challenges (e.g. immorality of treating unborn human beings as objects to be harvested). Thus, researchers are obliged to advance technologies, but must do so within acceptable ethical boundaries. If a researcher only acts within the bounds of one's research, i.e. exclusively microethical, the research may still be unacceptable from a societal perspective if it violates macroethical principles.

'''Melvin Eugene Carnahan''' (February 11, 1934 – October 16, 2000) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the [[List of Governors of Missouri|51st Governor of Missouri]] from 1993 until his death in a plane crash in 2000. A [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]], he was elected posthumously to the [[United States Senate|U.S. Senate]]; his widow held his seat for two years.

==Family life and education==
Carnahan was born in [[Birch Tree, Missouri]], and grew up on a small farm near [[Ellsinore, Missouri]], with his only sibling, Robert "Bob" Carnahan.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1908&amp;dat=20001018&amp;id=FlUrAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ztkEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1530,1188990 Elsinore Remembers its Fallen Son] p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Kathel (Schupp) and [[A. S. J. Carnahan]], the superintendent of Ellsinore schools who, in 1944, was elected to the [[United States House of Representatives]].

Carnahan moved with his family to [[Washington, D.C.]], where he graduated high school and earned a [[Bachelor of Arts]] (B.A.) in [[Business Administration]] from [[George Washington University]]. He entered the [[United States Air Force]], rising to First Lieutenant, and served as a [[special agent]] for the [[Air Force Office of Special Investigations|Office of Special Investigation]]. He received a [[Juris Doctor]] (J.D.) from the [[University of Missouri School of Law]] in [[Columbia, Missouri]], in 1959.

==Political career==
[[File:Mel Carnahan.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Carnahan as state treasurer in 1981]]
Carnahan's political career started as a member of the [[Missouri House of Representatives]] representing the [[Rolla, Missouri|Rolla]] area. In 1980, Carnahan was elected [[State Treasurer of Missouri|Missouri State Treasurer]]. He served in that post from 1981 to 1985. In 1984 he was an unsuccessful candidate for [[Governor of Missouri]], losing the Democratic [[primary election]] to then-Lieutenant Governor [[Kenneth Rothman]], who lost the general election that year to state Attorney General [[John Ashcroft]].&lt;ref name=refname /&gt;

In 1988 he was elected [[Lieutenant Governor of Missouri]]. In 1992, he faced [[Mayor of St. Louis]] [[Vincent C. Schoemehl]] in the Democratic primary for governor. He won the Democratic nomination by a wide margin and went on to easily defeat Republican state Attorney General [[William L. Webster]] in the general election. He was elected Governor of Missouri on November 3, 1992, and reelected for a second term on November 5, 1996, defeating Republican [[State Auditor of Missouri]] [[Margaret B. Kelly|Margaret Kelly]].

==Personal life==
Carnahan and his family were active members of the First Baptist Church of Rolla, where he served as an ordained deacon and member of the building committee. In 1984, he risked his political career by taking a public stand against Missouri ballot issues, Amendments 5 and 7, which would legalize [[parimutuel betting]] and create a [[Missouri Lottery|state lottery]]. He was one of only a handful of state elected officials to take such a position; however, both amendments passed.

Carnahan married Jean Carpenter in [[Washington, D.C.]] on June 12, 1954. They had four children, all lawyers. [[Russ Carnahan]], a former member of the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] for [[Missouri's 3rd congressional district|Missouri's 3rd District]] (2005–2013); [[Tom Carnahan]], founder of [[Wind Capital Group]], which builds [[wind farm]]s; [[Robin Carnahan]], former [[Missouri Secretary of State]] (2005–2013); and Roger "Randy" Carnahan, who piloted the plane and perished in the same crash that killed his father.

==2000 Senate election and death==
In 2000, Carnahan ran in the [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 2000|election]] against incumbent [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[John Ashcroft]] to become a United States Senator. It was a heated and intense campaign, in which Carnahan traveled all over Missouri to garner support in what was a very close race. However, early in the evening of October 16, the night before a [[United States presidential election, 2000|presidential]] [[United States presidential election debates|debate]] held at [[Washington University in St. Louis]] just three weeks before the election, the twin-engine [[Cessna]] airplane he was flying on, which was piloted by his son Randy, lost control in rainy and foggy conditions and crashed on a forested hillside near [[Goldman, Missouri]], only about {{convert|35|mi}} south of St. Louis. All three on board the plane (Mel and Randy Carnahan and Chris Sifford, the governor's campaign advisor and former chief of staff) were killed in the crash.

Lieutenant Governor [[Roger B. Wilson]] ascended to the governorship and served out the balance of Carnahan's term, which ended in January 2001. Because Missouri election law would not allow Carnahan's name to be removed from the November 7, 2000, ballot, the campaign chose Carnahan's widow, [[Jean Carnahan]], to unofficially become the new Democratic candidate. Wilson promised to appoint her to the seat, if it became vacant as a result of Mel Carnahan's win in the election. Carnahan's campaign continued using the slogan "I'm Still with Mel." A Senate first, Carnahan posthumously won, by a 2% margin. Jean Carnahan was then appointed to the Senate and served until November 2002, when she was defeated by a 1% margin in a [[United States Senate special election in Missouri, 2002|special election]] by Republican [[James Talent]].

Carnahan is not the only candidate to have died during a U.S. Senate race. Senator [[Paul Wellstone]] of [[Minnesota]] was killed in a plane crash in 2002, eleven days before his [[United States Senate election in Minnesota, 2002|Senate election]]; Wellstone's party, the [[Minnesota Democratic–Farmer–Labor Party|DFL]], chose former [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] [[Walter Mondale]] to replace Wellstone on the ballot, but Mondale lost narrowly to Republican [[Norm Coleman]]. Representative [[Jerry Litton]], also from Missouri, died in one in [[United States Senate election in Missouri, 1976|1976]] the day that he won the Democratic primary and was to be nominated by party officials; on his death, the party ran a second primary, and former [[Governor of Missouri|Governor]] [[Warren E. Hearnes]], the runner-up in the first primary, won but was subsequently defeated by Republican [[John Danforth]]. [[Richard D. Obenshain|Richard "Dick" Obenshain]] of [[Virginia]] was killed in a plane crash in [[United States Senate election in Virginia, 1978|1978]] shortly after receiving the Republican nomination; he was replaced by the far less conservative state convention runner-up, former [[United States Secretary of the Navy]] [[John Warner]], who proceeded to narrowly defeat (by less than half of a percentage point) former [[Attorney General of Virginia]] [[Andrew P. Miller]].

A high school, [[Carnahan High School of the Future]], was named after him in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9322">[[Image:Meta-Optimization Concept.JPG|thumb|Meta-optimization concept.]]
In [[numerical optimization]], '''meta-optimization''' is the use of one optimization method to tune another optimization method. Meta-optimization is reported to have been used as early as in the late 1970s by Mercer and Sampson&lt;ref name="mercer78adaptive"/&gt; for finding optimal parameter settings of a [[genetic algorithm]]. 

Meta-optimization and related concepts are also known in the literature as meta-evolution, super-optimization, automated parameter calibration, [[hyper-heuristics]], etc.

== Motivation ==
[[Image:DE Meta-Fitness Landscape (12 benchmark problems).JPG|thumb|Performance landscape for [[differential evolution]].]]
Optimization methods such as [[genetic algorithm]] and [[differential evolution]] have several parameters that govern their behaviour and efficiency in optimizing a given problem and these parameters must be chosen by the practitioner to achieve satisfactory results. Selecting the behavioural parameters by hand is a laborious task that is susceptible to human misconceptions of what makes the optimizer perform well.

The behavioural parameters of an optimizer can be varied and the optimization performance plotted as a landscape. This is computationally feasible for optimizers with few behavioural parameters and optimization problems that are fast to compute, but when the number of behavioural parameters increases the time usage for computing such a performance landscape increases exponentially. This is the [[curse of dimensionality]] for the search-space consisting of an optimizer's behavioural parameters. An efficient method is therefore needed to search the space of behavioural parameters.

== Methods ==
[[Image:DE Meta-Optimization Progress (12 benchmark problems).JPG|thumb|Meta-optimization of [[differential evolution]].]]
A simple way of finding good behavioural parameters for an optimizer is to employ another overlaying optimizer, called the [[meta]]-optimizer. There are different ways of doing this depending on whether the behavioural parameters to be tuned are [[real number|real-valued]] or [[discrete mathematics|discrete-valued]], and depending on what performance measure is being used, etc.

Meta-optimizing the parameters of a [[genetic algorithm]] was done by Grefenstette &lt;ref name=grefenstette86optimization/&gt; and Keane,&lt;ref name=keane95genetic/&gt; amongst others, and experiments with meta-optimizing both the parameters and the [[genetic operators]] were reported by Bäck.&lt;ref name=back94parallel/&gt; Meta-optimization of the COMPLEX-RF algorithm was done by Krus and Andersson,&lt;ref name=Krus03optimizing/&gt; and, &lt;ref name=Krus13optimizing/&gt; where performance index of optimization based on information theory was introduced and further developed. Meta-optimization of [[particle swarm optimization]] was done by Meissner et al.&lt;ref name=meissner06optimized/&gt;, Pedersen and Chipperfield,&lt;ref name=pedersen08simplifying/&gt; and Mason et al. &lt;ref name=mason2017meta/&gt;. Pedersen and Chipperfield applied meta-optimization to [[differential evolution]]&lt;ref name=pedersen08thesis/&gt;. Birattari et al.&lt;ref name=birattari02racing/&gt;&lt;ref name=birattari04thesis/&gt; meta-optimized [[ant colony optimization]]. [[Statistical models]] have also been used to reveal more about the relationship between choices of behavioural parameters and optimization performance, see for example Francois and Lavergne,&lt;ref name=francois01design/&gt; and Nannen and Eiben.&lt;ref name=nannen06method/&gt; A comparison of various meta-optimization techniques was done by Smit and Eiben.&lt;ref name=smit09comparing/&gt;

In molecular biology '''mir-598 microRNA''' is a short [[non-coding RNA|RNA]] molecule. [[MicroRNA]]s function to regulate the expression levels of other genes by several mechanisms.

==miR-598 in senescence==
miR-598 has been shown to directly target and inhibit the [[Sir2]] homolog, silent information regulator one (SRT1) enzyme, in the [[senescence]] of human [[adipose tissue|adipose-tissue]]-derived [[mesenchymal stem cell]]s. Increased miR-598 expression during the senescent state is accompanied by a decreased expression of SRT1, meaning an absence of the inhibited [[p53]] [[acetylation]] usually observed with increased STR1 levels.&lt;ref name="pmid22581440"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Shin KK, Kim YJ, Hong CP, Yang JW, Bae YC, Jung JS | title=miR-598 induces replicative senescence in human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells via silent information regulator 1. | journal=Mol Cell Biochem | year= 2012 | volume=  372| issue=  1-2| pages=  285| pmid=22581440 | doi=10.1007/s11010-012-1330-y | pmc= | url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=22581440  }}&lt;/ref&gt; miR-598 acts to modulate cellular senescence. More specifically, its overexpression induces senescence in early-passage cells whilst inhibition conversely sees a partial recovery of the ageing [[phenotype]] through increased [[cellular differentiation]].

'''Niels Bätge''' (19 April 1913 in Reval – 12 December 1944 near the [[Åland Islands]]) was a German [[Schnellboot]] commander with [[Baltic German]] origin in [[World War II]] and recipient of the [[Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross]]. Bätge was promoted to ''[[Korvettenkapitän]]'' on 1 September 1943. Shortly after his promotion he took command of the [[German destroyer Z35|destroyer ''Z35'']] on 25 September 1943. The destroyers ''Z35'' and [[German destroyer Z36|''Z36'']] both ran into a German [[naval mine]] in the [[Gulf of Finland]] on 12 December 1944. Bätge and 24 members of the crew managed to save themselves in a [[Lifeboat (shipboard)|life boat]]. However, they all froze to death and were later washed ashore near the [[Åland Islands]].

==World War II==
At the start of World War II, Bätge was serving in a [[torpedo boat]] flotilla; during this period, he commanded the torpedo boat {{ship|German torpedo boat|T2||2}}. In October 1940, he was transferred to command a flotilla of [[E-boat]]s;{{sfn|Paterson|2015|p=93}} this newly-formed unit began training in the Baltic before being transferred to the [[English Channel]] in May 1941. Bätge's boats were based in [[Cherbourg]] and [[Rotterdam]]. Upon the 4th Flotilla's arrival, the other three E-boat flotillas in occupied France were transferred to the Baltic in preparation for the [[Operation Barbarossa|invasion of the Soviet Union]]. Bätge's 4th Flotilla, which had just five boats operational owing to parts shortages and overuse, was to conduct the coastal campaign against Britain by itself. Bätge was instructed to keep his boats in action as much as possible to conceal the fact that the other three flotillas had been withdrawn. Throughout 1941, engine problems plagued the boats of the 4th Flotilla. Bätge had received orders to transfer his boats to [[Lorient]] in May to help cover the arrival of the [[battleship]] {{ship|German battleship|Bismarck||2}}, but bad weather delayed Bätge's departure and ''Bismarck'' was sunk in action. As a result, the 4th Flotilla remained in the Channel. On 30 May, three of the boats laid six mines off [[Great Yarmouth]]. The following month, ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' reconnaissance aircraft spotted what they believed to be the British [[aircraft carrier]] {{HMS|Hermes|95|6}}, and Bätge sent four of his boats to attack the vessel on the morning of 3 June. They sank the ship, which turned out to be the merchant ship [[SS Zealandic (1911)|SS ''Mamari III'']], which had been converted into a decoy. Bätge's boats returned to minelaying operations for the rest of June, and these mines claimed three merchant ships that month.{{sfn|Paterson|2015|pp=106, 121–122}}

In February 1942, Bätge's flotilla participated in [[Operation Cerberus]], helping to cover the transfer of the battleships {{ship|German battleship|Scharnhorst||2}} and {{ship|German battleship|Gneisenau||2}} and the [[heavy cruiser]] {{ship|German cruiser|Prinz Eugen||2}} through the Channel. By this time, his forces had been reinforced by the 2nd and 6th Flotillas. The three flotillas were responsible for escorting the heavy ships through the [[Dover Strait]], and they rendezvoused off [[Cape Gris Nez]].{{sfn|Showell|2009|p=110}}

==History==	
In 1989, Novo Industri A/S (Novo Terapeutisk Laboratorium) and Nordisk Gentofte A/S (Nordisk Insulinlaboratorium) merged to become Novo Nordisk A/S, the world's largest producer of insulin with headquarters in Bagsværd, Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.novonordisk.com/about-novo-nordisk/novo-nordisk-history.html&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In 1994, Novo Nordisk's existing information technology units was spun out as [[NNIT|NNIT A/S]]. The company was converted into a wholly owned ''[[aktieselskab]]'' in 2004&lt;ref name="Company profile"&gt;[http://www.nnit.com/about-us/Pages/history.aspx Company profile&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, NNIT was floated on the [http://www.nasdaqomxnordic.com/aktier/microsite?Instrument=CSE106330&amp;name=NNIT NASDAQ OMX Nordic].
	
In 2000, Novo's enzymes business, [[Novozymes|Novozymes A/S]], was spun-out.

In 2013, Novo acquired [[Xellia]] for $700 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20130521005780/en/Novo-acquires-Xellia-Pharmaceuticals-700-million&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In 2015, the company announced it would collaborate with [[Ablynx]], using its nanobody technology to develop at least one new drug candidate.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/novo-nordisk-joins-ablynx-in-up-to-399m-nanobody-alliance/81252025/&lt;/ref&gt;
 	
In January 2018, Reuters reported that Novo had offered to acquire [[Ablynx]] for $3.1 billion - having made an unreported offer in mid December for the company.&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-novo-nordisk-m-a-ablynx/denmarks-novo-nordisk-offers-3-1-billion-for-belgian-biotech-group-ablynx-idUKKBN1EX0HT&lt;/ref&gt; However the Ablynx board rejected this offer the same day, saying that the price undervalued the business.&lt;ref&gt;https://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-novo-nordisk-m-a-ablynx/ablynx-shares-soar-after-rejects-novo-nordisks-3-1-billion-bid-idUKKBN1EX0HT&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately Novo lost out to [[Sanofi]] who bid $4.8 billion. Later in the same year the company announced it would acquire Ziylo for around $800 million.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biospace.com/article/novo-nordisk-acquires-ziylo-in-possible-800-million-plus-deal/?s=79&lt;/ref&gt;

One example in the area of [[Pre-clinical development|non-clinical]] safety assessment is the [[InnoMed PredTox]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Mattes | first1 = William B.| chapter = Public Consortium Efforts in Toxicogenomics | doi = 10.1007/978-1-60327-048-9_11 | title = Essential Concepts in Toxicogenomics| editor1-last = Mendrick | editor1-first = Donna L.| editor2-last = Mattes | editor2-first = William B.| series = [[Methods in Molecular Biology]]| volume = 460 | pages = 221–238 | year = 2008 | isbn = 978-1-58829-638-2 | pmid = 18449490 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InnoMed PredTox official project website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.innomed-predtox.com/consortium/members/ |title=InnoMed PredTox Member Organizations |accessdate=2008-08-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080926214522/http://www.innomed-predtox.com/consortium/members/ |archivedate=2008-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The company is expanding its activities in joint research projects within the framework of the [[Innovative Medicines Initiative]] of [[European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations]] and the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="IMI Call Topics 2008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://imi.europa.eu/docs/calls01_en.zip|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015122459/http://imi.europa.eu/docs/calls01_en.zip|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2009-10-15|title=IMI Call Topics 2008|last=Innovative Medicines Initiative|work=IMI-GB-018v2-24042008-CallTopics.pdf|publisher=European Commission|accessdate=2008-08-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Diabetes===
Novo Nordisk founded the World Diabetes foundation to save the lives of those affected by diabetes in developing countries and supported a UN resolution to fight diabetes, making diabetes the only other disease alongside [[HIV]] / [[AIDS]] to have a commitment to combat at a UN level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlddiabetesfoundation.org/composite-75.htm|title=World Diabetes Foundation website|accessdate=2008-08-25|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919163514/http://www.worlddiabetesfoundation.org/composite-75.htm|archivedate=2008-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diabetes treatments account for 85% of Novo Nordisk’s business. Novo Nordisk works with doctors, nurses, and patients, to develop products for self-managing diabetes conditions. The DAWN (Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes and Needs) 2001 study was a global survey of the psychosocial aspects of living with diabetes. It involved over 5,000 people with diabetes and almost 4,000 care providers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dawnstudy.com/dawn-programmes/study-results.html|title=Study Results|last=|first=|date=|website=DAWN Study|publisher=Novo Nordisk|access-date=2016-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; This study was designed to identify barriers to optimal health and quality of life. A follow-up study completed in 2012 involved more than 15,000 people living with, or caring for, those with diabetes. In response to UK findings, a National Action Plan (NAP) was developed, with a multidisciplinary steering committee, to support the delivery of individualized person-centered care in the UK. The NAP seeks to provide a holistic approach to diabetes treatment for patients and their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2337/diaclin.24.4.154| title = The Diabetes Attitudes, Wishes, and Needs (DAWN) Study| journal = Clinical Diabetes| volume = 24| issue = 4| pages = 154| year = 2006| last1 = Funnell | first1 = M. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The i3-diabetes programme is a collaboration between the [[King's Health Partners]], one of only six [[Academic health science centre|Academic Health Sciences Centres]] (AHSCs) in England, and Novo Nordisk. The programme is a five-year collaboration designed to  deliver personalised care that will lead to improved outcomes for people living with diabetes, and more efficient and effective ways of caring for people with diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.i3diabetes.org.uk/|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141214234557/http://www.i3diabetes.org.uk/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2014-12-14|title=i3-diabetes programme|publisher=i3diabetes.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewsmemo.com/|title=How Effective Is The Diabetes Destroyer System?|publisher=reviewsmemo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diabetes support advocacy==

Novo Nordisk have sponsored the [[International Diabetes Federation]]'s [[Unite for Diabetes]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worlddiabetesday.org/news/novo-nordisk-in-united-effort-on-world-diabetes-day|title=Novo nordisk in united effort on world diabetes day|publisher=worlddiabetesday.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, Novo Nordisk announced a partnership program entitled ‘Cities Changing Diabetes,’ which entails combating urban diabetes. Partnership includes [[University College London]] (UCL) and supported by [[Steno Diabetes Center]], as well as a range of local partners including healthcare professionals, city authorities, urban planners, businesses, academics and community leaders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://press.novonordisk-us.com/index.php?s=20295&amp;item=122764|title=Novo Nordisk launches ’Cities Changing Diabetes’ to fight urban diabetes|publisher=Novo Nordisk|accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A November 2014 newspaper article suggested that a recent medical research breakthrough at [[Harvard University]] (creating insulin-producing cells from [[embryonic stem cell]]s) could potentially put Novo Nordisk out of business.  Dr Alan Moses, the chief medical officer of Novo Nordisk, commented that the biology of diabetes is incredibly complex but also that Novo Nordisk's mission is to alleviate and cure diabetes.  If this new medical advance "...meant the dissolution of Novo Nordisk, that'd be fine."&lt;ref&gt;Roland, Denise (24 November 2014) [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/pharmaceuticalsandchemicals/11246935/Insulin-pioneer-sees-end-in-sight-for-diabetes-and-itself.html Insulin pioneer sees end in sight for diabetes – and itself] The Daily Telegraph, Retrieved 25 November 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research and pipeline==

Novo Nordisk was researching pulmonary delivery systems for diabetic medications, and in the early stages of research into autoimmune and chronic inflammatory diseases, using technologies such as translational immunology and monoclonal antibodies &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.novonordisk.com/science/organisation/bru.asp|title=Biopharmaceutical Research Unit," Novo Nordisk Corporation|accessdate=29 November 2011|website=novonordisk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In September 2014 the company announced a decision to discontinue all research in inflammatory disorders, including the discontinuation of R&amp;D in anti-[[Interleukin 20|IL-20]] for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/seattle/blog/health-care-inc/2014/09/novo-nordisk-cuts-jobs-at-seattle-research.html|title=Novo Nordisk cuts jobs at Seattle research facility|date=4 Sep 2014|last=Lamm|first=Greg|accessdate=27 Oct 2014|website=http://www.bizjournals.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018 it was reported that the company would lay off 400 administrative staff, laboratory technicians and scientists, in Denmark and China in order to concentrate  research and development efforts on “transformational biological and technological innovation”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Novo Nordisk sheds 400 staff as it refocuses R&amp;D efforts |url=https://www.ft.com/content/30378a74-bb3f-11e8-8274-55b72926558f?emailId=5b9f92452561700004e6494c |accessdate=2 November 2018 |publisher=Financial Times |date=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

In 2010, Novo Nordisk breached the [[Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry|ABPIs]] code of conduct by failing to provide information about side-effects of [[Victoza]] and by promoting [[Victoza]] prior to being granted market authorization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pmcpa.org.uk/?q=node/878|title=Novo Nordisk Limited, Eli Lilly and Company Limited, Grünenthal Ltd and Napp Pharmaceuticals Limited named in advertisements|publisher=Prescription Medicines Code of Practice Authority (PMCPA)|accessdate=2011-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 Novo Nordisk had to pay back DKK 3.6 billion to the [[SKAT (tax agency)|Danish tax authorities]] due to transfer mispricing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Penge/2013/02/05/112004.htm|title=Sådan snød Novo Nordisk Skat for 3,6 milliarder|accessdate=2013-02-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, a debate emerged in which scientists questioned whether the incretin class of diabetes medications – the class to which [[Victoza]] belongs – had an increased risk of side effects in the pancreas such as pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer. It was concluded that data currently available did not confirm these concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1111/dom.12230| title = A prospective, claims-based assessment of the risk of pancreatitis and pancreatic cancer with liraglutide compared to other antidiabetic drugs| journal = Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism| volume = 16| issue = 3| pages = 273| year = 2014| last1 = Funch | first1 = D.| last2 = Gydesen | first2 = H.| last3 = Tornøe | first3 = K.| last4 = Major-Pedersen | first4 = A.| last5 = Chan | first5 = K. A.| pmc = 4237552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill insulin were recalled in some European countries as their analysis had shown that a small percentage of the products in these batches did not meet the specifications for insulin strength.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diabetes.org.uk/About_us/News_Landing_Page/Medical-alert-Batches-of-NovoMix-30-FlexPen-and-Penfill-to-be-recalled/|title=Medical alert: Batches of NovoMix 30 FlexPen and Penfill to be recalled|publisher=Diabetes UK|accessdate=2014-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2017, Novo Nordisk agreed to pay $58.7 million to end a [[United States Department of Justice]] probe into the lack of FDA disclosure to doctors about the cancer risk for their diabetes drug, Victoza.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=McLaughlin |first=David |last2=Harris |first2=Andrew M. |authorlink2=Jef |last3=Feeley |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-09-05/u-s-sues-novo-nordisk-over-victoza-seeking-12-15-billion |title=Novo Nordisk Settles U.S. Suit Over Victoza for $58.65 Million |work=[[Bloomberg News]] |date=2017-09-06 |accessdate=2017-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Millicent Olivia Rawlins''' (''née'' '''Burges'''; 19 September 1892 – 3 August 1930) was a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[Scouting]] and [[Girl Guide and Girl Scout|Guiding]] advocate. She was secretary to the Girl Guides' and Girl Scouts' first [[World Camp (Guiding)|World Camp]].

==Family life==

Burges was the first daughter of Colonel William Edward Parry Burges and Millicent Pettingal Burges (''née'' Miller). She was raised at the family's home in [[South Gloucestershire]], called The Ridge. She had one sister.

Burges married [[Stuart Blundell Rawlins|Major Stuart Blundell Rawlins]] in 1925. They had two sons, Christopher and Philip. At age 37, Burges [[maternal death|died giving birth]] to her third child, a daughter, who also died.

==Scouting==

The Burges family were friends of [[Robert Baden-Powell, 1st Baron Baden-Powell]], who founded Scouting in 1907 and Guiding in 1910, and his wife, [[Olave Baden-Powell|Lady Baden-Powell]].

In April 1914, Burges founded a Scout troop at [[Chipping Sodbury]]. Assisted by her sister, meetings were initially held at The Ridge. During [[World War I]], the boys became messengers for a regiment quartered in Chipping Sodbury. Records from 1917, describe the Scout troop involved in the 'Air-Craft Defence Scheme'.&lt;ref name="Ridge Families"&gt;{{cite web| title =Ridge Families | url =http://www.ridge-wood.org.uk/ridgefamilies.html | accessdate =2007-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A list of names and addresses was held at Chipping Sodbury Police Station of all Scouts who owned a bicycle and were able and willing to undertake delivering messages in an emergency.

==Guiding==

Burges became involved in Guiding around 1916. For several years, she sat on the Guides' executive committee as head of Rules and Awards.

[[Olave Baden-Powell]] and Burges formulated the idea for the first World Camp in September 1923, during the latters stay at the Baden-Powells' home, [[Pax Hill]]. Burges agreed to be secretary for the camp. The camp was held from 16–24 July 1924 at [[Foxlease]]. At this time, Burges was Deputy Chief Commissioner for the West of England.

After her marriage, Burges' involvement in Guiding decreased, but she remained interested in the movement.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3132">'''Oneironautics''' [ə.neɪ.roʊ.nɔː.tɪks] refers to the ability to travel within a [[dream]] on a [[lucid dreaming|conscious basis]]. Such a traveler in a dream may be called an '''oneironaut'''.

==Within one's dream==
{{main|Lucid dreaming}}
A lucid dream is one in which the dreamer is aware of dreaming and may be able to exert some degree of control over the dream's characters, narrative or environment. Early references to the phenomenon are found in ancient Greek texts.

==Within the dream of another==
{{main|Dream telepathy}}
The idea of one person being able to consciously travel or interact within the dream of another person, known variously as "'''dream telepathy'''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://alquinte.com/en/importance/lucid_mutual.shtml The Importance of Dreams Survey - Lucidity And Telepathy'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lucidity.com/LD9DIR.html Chapter 9 - Stephen LaBerge, (1985). LUCID DREAMING.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dream Telepathy by Montague Ullman, MD and Stanley Krippner, PhD with Alan Vaughan, {{ISBN|1-57174-321-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dreaminglucid.com/articles/Dream%20Telepathy%20Explain%20Mutual%20Dreaming%2053.pdf Does Dream Telepathy Explain Mutual Lucid Dreaming?]&lt;/ref&gt; "'''telepathic lucid dreaming'''" or "'''telepathic dreaming'''",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psychics.co.uk/telepathy.html Telepathy Dreams]&lt;/ref&gt; has been explored in the realms of science and fantasy fiction; in recent works, such an interaction is often depicted as a computer-mediated [[psychotherapeutic]] action, as is the case in ''[[The Cell]]'', and ''[[Paprika (2006 film)|Paprika]]'', as well as through the direct intervention of another sleeping person, as in ''[[Inception]]'', ''[[Dreamscape (1984 film)|Dreamscape]]'' and ''[[Waking Life]]''. The concept is also included in the fantasy series ''[[The Wheel of Time]]'' as an ability "[[Unusual abilities (Wheel of Time)#Dreamers and Dreamwalking|dreamwalkers]]" are able to use.

A trope in such works of fiction explores the ramifications of whether the sleeping protagonist should enter the sleeping brain of another as opposed to allowing another individual to enter one's own brain; the entering of another individual's brain often results in unpleasant surprises, depending upon the mental state of the host or the preparedness of the guest. [[Roger Zelazny]]'s 1966 sci-fi novella ''[[The Dream Master]]'', which applies computer-mediated dream telepathy in a psychotherapeutic setting, focuses on the protagonist's growing struggle to keep his balance as he enters the brain of a fellow psychotherapist who is blind and subconsciously, destructively hungers for the visual stimuli upon which dreams largely depend.

==Fictional character biography==
The earliest known sightings of the Russian occurred while he was vacationing in [[Afghanistan]] in the 1980s. He subsequently traveled the world, inserting himself into various conflicts for fun and profit; locations he is said to have fought in include [[Lebanon]], [[Iraq]], [[Rwanda]], [[East Timor]], [[Chechnya]], the [[Balkans]], and [[Belfast]] (where he [[Cannibalism|consumed]] a man on a bet). The Russian's activities led to him being wanted dead or alive by numerous law enforcement agencies, as well as criminal organizations such as the [[Yakuza]].&lt;ref name = "Nine"&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian|story = Fяom Яussia With Love|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #9|date = December 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian is contacted at his home in [[Kazakhstan]] by American crime lord [[Ma Gnucci]], who offers him ten million dollars to kill the [[Punisher]]. The Russian agrees to the deal, boards a Russian airliner to North America, crashes it above Canada, and crosses the border into New York City, where he is briefed by Gnucci.&lt;ref name="Nine"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian|story = Desperate Measures|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #8|date = November 2000|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian is then brought to the Punisher's current address, and engages the [[vigilante]], their fight (which the Russian dominates) bringing them into the apartment of the Punisher's morbidly obese neighbor, Mr. Bumpo. The Punisher burns the Russian's face with a hot pizza that Bumpo had been dining on, trips him, and then throws Bumpo on top of him. The Russian asphyxiates under Bumpo, and has his head cut off by the Punisher, who uses it to intimidate what remains of Ma Gnucci's forces into surrendering.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian|story = Glutton for Punishment|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #10|date = January 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Stuart Moore and Nanci Dakesian|story = Any Which Way You Can|title = The Punisher|volume = 5|issue = #11|date = February 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MGN"&gt;{{cite book|author = Robert G.

The Russian's remains are recovered by General Kreigkopf, who resurrects him as a [[cyborg]] using technology stolen from [[S.H.I.E.L.D.]]. Side-effects of the experimental hormone treatments he is given to stabilize his reinvigorated and improved body cause the Russian to develop breasts (which he adores) and an implied form of [[menstruation]], which prompts him to begin wearing women's clothing, including high heels.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian and Stuart Moore|story = Well Come on Everybody and Let's Get Together Tonight|title = The Punisher|volume = 6|issue = #1|date = August 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; To test the Russian's capabilities, Kreigkopf approves his request to return to New York City to kill the Punisher, who the Russian throws off of the [[Empire State Building]]. The Punisher is saved by [[Spider-Man]], and in the battle that ensues he wields the superhero as a human shield, and uses his web-shooters to knock the Russian off of the skyscraper. The Russian survives crashing through the street below and being hit by a subway train, and retreats to Kreigkopf's base on Grand Nixon Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian and Stuart Moore|story = Does Whatever a Spider Can|title = The Punisher|volume = 6|issue = #2|date = August 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian is repaired, and denied another chance to face the Punisher.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Nanci Dakesian and Stuart Moore|story = American Ugly|title = The Punisher|volume = 6|issue = #3|date = September 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Peter Sanderson|title = The Marvel Comics Guide to New York City|url = http://books.simonandschuster.ca/The-Marvel-Comics-Guide-to-New-York-City/Peter-Sanderson/9781416531418|accessdate = 29 May 2015|year = 2007|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster|Gallery Books]]|isbn = 9781416531418|pages = 49–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian is placed on a [[Boeing 747]] full of soldiers that Kreigkopf intends to have attack the [[European Union]] in [[Brussels]]. The Punisher, who had tracked the Russian down, forces the airplane to crash into Grand Nixon Island's fuel depot; the Russian emerges from the wreckage as the only survivor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = RS and Comicraft's Wes Abbott|editor = Stuart Moore|story = Dirty Work|title = The Punisher|volume = 6|issue = #4|date = October 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Kreigkopf improvises his attack plan by ordering that a French airplane carrying a nuclear warhead be hijacked, the Punisher boards the aircraft, followed by the Russian. The Punisher blows out the back of the Russian's head by shoving a gun into his mouth, then chains him to the atomic bomb and drops it on Grand Nixon. The island and all of the criminals on it are obliterated, as is the Russian, whose last words are, "Dosvidanja, Big Boy! The Russian really has to hand it to you!"&lt;ref name = "MGN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Garth Ennis|penciller = Steve Dillon|inker = Jimmy Palmiotti|colorist = Chris Sotomayer|letterer = Richard Starkings and Comicraft's Saida!|editor = Stuart Moore|story = No Limits|title = The Punisher|volume = 6|issue = #5|date = December 2001|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
In his first storyline, the Russian possessed tremendous strength and durability; he singlehandedly wipes out a Bravo Force team, unintentionally crushes a man with a friendly gesture, smacks the Punisher with a toilet he had ripped out of its foundation, and tears apart a revolver, while also being unfazed by being kicked in the crotch, stabbed in the stomach, and bludgeoned with a chair. Additionally, he alludes to surviving freefalling from an airplane, and being repeatedly shot in the head. Despite his nigh-invulnerability, the Russian was sensitive to heat, becoming enraged when the Punisher successfully injured him with a stove, and a hot pizza.

When General Kreigkopf resurrected the Russian, he had his body augmented with plastics and [[adamantium]], replaced most of his organs with ones taken from animals, and gave him olfactory sensors that increased his sense of smell to the level of a [[bloodhound]]'s.

==Obsession with American culture==
In his initial comic appearances, the Russian was shown to have an obsession with [[popular culture|American pop culture]]. His first thoughts upon being offered $10 million to kill the Punisher was a realization of how many pairs of [[Levi Strauss &amp; Co.|Levi's]] and [[Compact Disc]]s he could buy with that amount. The Russian is also a self-confessed [[superhero]] [[Fan (person)|fan]]. He is the president of "The [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]], Man Without Fear, Fan Club" of [[Smolensk]]. He also wished to gain autographs from the [[X-Men]], the [[Fantastic Four]], and [[Spider-Man]]. He also believes [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]] would make a good [[communist]] because of his big hammer.

==Other versions==
===Marvel MAX===
A flashback sequence in  ''[[The Punisher (2004 series)|The Punisher]]'' Vol. 7, #75 depicts the Punisher fighting the Russian, who tries to break his back. The circumstances surrounding the battle, as well as how it is resolved, are not revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Peter Milligan|penciller = Goran Parlov|inker = Goran Parlov|colorist = Lee Loughridge|letterer = VC's Cory Petit|editor = Axel Alonso|story = Father's Day|title = The Punisher|volume = 7|issue = #75|date = 14 October 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marvel Noir===
In ''[[Marvel Noir|Punisher Noir]]'', the Russian is a soldier turned independent mercenary who, after [[World War I]], is sent after Frank Castelione, who is on a locomotive headed for England. A fight ensues and moves to the top of the train, where Frank shoves a grenade into the crotch of the Russian's pants, and pushes him off of the vehicle. Years later, the Russian, now identifying as female, helps [[Jigsaw (Marvel Comics)|Jigsaw]] and [[Barracuda (comics)|Barracuda]] murder Frank at the behest of mob boss [[Dutch Schultz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Frank Tieri|penciller = Paul Azaceta|inker = Paul Azaceta|colorist = Nick Filardi|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Sebastian Girner|story = Punisher &amp; Son|title = Punisher Noir|volume = 1|issue = #2|date = 16 September 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Frank Tieri|penciller = Paul Azaceta|inker = Paul Azaceta|colorist = Nick Filardi|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Sebastian Girner|story = Two Down...|title = Punisher Noir|volume = 1|issue = #3|date = 21 October 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frank's son, Frank Castelione Jr., grows up to become the Punisher, and discovers the Russian's connection to his father's death after tracking down and killing Barracuda and Jigsaw. The Punisher confronts the Russian at the [[Bronx Zoo]], and their fight brings them into the reptile exhibit, where the Russian is mauled by alligators. Despite losing an arm, the Russian continues to try to attack the Punisher, who finishes him off by emptying two fully loaded guns into him. Frank, Jr. then stages the scene to make it look like the Russian was the Punisher all along.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic|writer = Frank Tieri|penciller = Antonio Fuso|inker = Antonio Fuso|colorist = Nick Filardi|letterer = VC's Joe Sabino|editor = Sebastian Girner|story = The Last Words of Dutch Schultz|title = Punisher Noir|volume = 1|issue = #4|date = 9 December 2009|publisher = Marvel Comics|location = United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Een koppensneller met aan zijn gordel een schedel die bij feesten gebruikt wordt om uit te drinken een vrouw met een grote 'blangai' pot en achter hen palen voor het dodenfeest 'Tiwah' Borneo TMnr 10002945.jpg|thumb|right|Two sapundu sacrificial poles in the form of male head and a woman stand behind this Ngaju couple.]]
'''Sapundu''' is the sacrificial pole of the Dayak [[Ngaju people]] of [[Central Kalimantan]], [[Indonesia]]. The sacrificial pole is usually carved into a human figure or an animal figure. The sapundu is an integral part of the [[Tiwah]] dead festival, where animals are tied to it to be sacrificed.

==Form==
Sapundus are traditionally made of [[ironwood]], although today a lighter more common wood are increasingly being used. It is usually about 1.5 - 3 meter height, and has a diameter of between 15-25 cm.{{sfn|Dyson|Asharini M.|1980|p=51}} Sapundus are carved into different figures e.g. a man or a woman, or sometimes of animals. A sapundu represent a figure that would escort the soul of the dead into the paradise during the tiwah. The type of figures represented by the sapundu is usually a figure that is deemed appropriate to accompany the deceased during their final journey into the paradise. For example, if the deceased was a female, a sacrificial post representing a man is usually prepared for her tiwah, and vice versa. Contemporary sapundu can be very creative. For example, there is a sapundu depicting a young woman in blue jeans and a sleeveless T-shirt wearing a Sony Walkman.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=59}} Some sapundus contain English inscriptions, e.g. ''"Tiwah Party"'' or ''"God Save Our Soul"''.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=59}} Notches inscribed onto the post are intended to serve as reminders to the souls of the animals, rice, and other goods donated by survivors to ensure the deceased's comfort in the afterlife.{{sfn|Schiller|1997|p=59}} 

The following are different kind of sapundu figures found in the Dayak villages along the [[Kahayan River|Kahayan]], [[Central Kalimantan]]:
*''Sapundu hatue'' ("male sapundu") is shaped like a man, usually a ritual specialist, carrying a traditional iron dagger (''duhung'').
*''Sapundu bawi'' ("female sapundu") is shaped like a woman, usually carrying materials used in preparing betel leaves for chewing.
*''Sapundu embak bakas'' resembles a man carrying a container of uncooked rice around his neck.
*''Sapundu sambali'' resembles various types of animals, e.g. a male tiger, a dog, or a crocodile.
*''Sapundu haramaung'' is shaped like a female tiger carrying a snake in her mouth.
*''Sapundu rahu nyampang'' depicts two persons, husband and wife.

Many sapundus are set in front of house courtyard, such as those found in the villages of [[Central Kalimantan]]. Some sapundus are kept in [[Belanga Museum]], [[Palangkaraya]], to simulate the tiwah festival; this sapundus are donated by the villagers and are purified accordingly following the traditional rite.

==Tiwah festival==
On the fifth day of the [[Tiwah]] festival, buffaloes, pigs or cows are tied to a sapundu to be sacrificed. One animal is tied onto one sapundu.{{sfn|Dyson|Asharini M.|1980|p=51}} The timing of the killing of the animal is adjusted with the intended length of the Tiwah ceremony; if only one buffalo is to be killed, usually the killing is done one day before the exhumation of the deceased. Multiple animals may require several days or it can be done all at once in one single day. The animal is tied onto the tiwah using a 10-20 meter [[aerial root|tree root]]. A male animal should be tied to a female-gendered sapundu, vice versa.{{sfn|Dyson|Asharini M.|1980|p=56}} All villagers are allowed to kill the livestock by spearing on them. The blood of the sacrificed livestock will be used to purify various items for the Tiwah, e.g. the [[sandung]] bone ossuary. The meat will be give to those performing the killing of the livestock following a strict rule.{{sfn|Banua Hujung Tanah|2011}}

The '''2018 Surabaya bombings''' were a series of terrorist attacks that initially occurred on 13 May 2018 in three churches in [[Surabaya]], the [[List of Indonesian cities by population|second largest city]] in [[Indonesia]]. The explosions took place at Immaculate Saint Mary Catholic Church (''Gereja Katolik Santa Maria Tak Bercela'', SMTB) on Ngagel Madya Street, Indonesia Christian Church (''Gereja Kristen Indonesia'', GKI) on Diponegoro Street, and Surabaya Central Pentecost Church (''Gereja Pantekosta Pusat Surabaya'', GPPS) on Arjuno Street. The first explosion took place at the SMTB Church; the second and third explosions followed within an hour.

The fourth bombing occurred in an apartment complex in [[Sidoarjo]], a regency located south of Surabaya. The explosion happened when the terrorists accidentally set off the bombs inside the room, killing three of them and injuring two children and a teenager. The fifth bombing occurred on the next day at the Surabaya Police Headquarters (''Mapolrestabes Surabaya''). Two perpetrators detonated their devices while they were being checked by the police at the entrance. 

As of 1 June 2018, 28 people were killed including the suicide bombers. Around 50 others were injured; several were in critical condition. The attacks occurred just days after the [[2018 Mako Brimob standoff|standoff at Mako Brimob]] in [[Depok]], in which five police officers were killed. The attacks are the deadliest terror attack in Indonesia since the [[2002 Bali bombings]]. 

The bombings were regarded as one of the most sophisticated and complex terror attacks in Indonesia. It was also the first of its kind in Indonesian history in which [[children]] as young as nine years old participated.

==Background==
It was estimated in 2017 that hundreds of Indonesians went to Syria or Iraq to fight for [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] before returning to Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Topsfield|first=Jewel|title=Terror in Indonesia: the threat posed by returning Islamic State fighters |url=https://www.smh.com.au/world/terror-in-indonesia-the-threat-posed-by-returning-islamic-state-fighters-20170915-gyi11p.html|accessdate=13 May 2018 |work=SMH.com.au|date=21 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The returning individuals are placed through a deradicalization program by the [[National Agency for Combating Terrorism]], and are put on a watchlist for the agency and local governments alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BNPT: WNI Kembali dari Suriah Ikuti Program Deradikalisasi|url=http://nasional.republika.co.id/berita/nasional/hukum/17/07/04/osj0m4313-bnpt-wni-kembali-dari-suriah-ikuti-program-deradikalisasi|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=Republika.co.id|date=4 July 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several terrorist attacks, such as the [[2016 Jakarta attacks|Thamrin attacks]], were orchestrated by the returnees or local extremists who pledged alliance to ISIL.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harvey|first=Adam|title=Indonesian terrorist inspired deadly attacks from prison, court hears|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-02-15/indonesian-terrorist-helped-plot-starbucks-bombing,-court-hears/9452476|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=ABC.net.au|date=15 February 2018|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Joko Widodo]] requested lawmakers to revise the country's anti-terrorism laws, which were published in 2003 and 2013. He questioned the law's effectiveness, with the government legally being unable to arrest perpetrators of the Thamrin attacks preemptively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Presiden Jokowi ajak lembaga negara revisi UU terorisme |url=http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/berita_indonesia/2016/01/160118_indonesia_wacana_revisi_uu_terorisme|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=BBC.com|date=19 January 2016|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revision encountered resistance, with critics remarking that the law would allow arbitrary arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Padden|first=Brian|title=Indonesian Terrorism Law Reform Still Faces Opposition|url=https://www.voanews.com/a/indonesian-terrorism-law-reform-still-faces-opposition/3155695.html|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=Voice of America}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, opposition arose from human rights groups due to the involvement of the [[Indonesian National Armed Forces]] in the bill, which would put the armed forces in a law enforcement role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pegiat HAM tolak 'pelibatan langsung TNI' dalam menindak terorisme|url=http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/indonesia-40104073|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=BBC.com|date=1 June 2017|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the bill continued to press on although it was put on hold in late February 2018 as both the military involvement and the legal definition of terrorism came into debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Revisions to Indonesia's anti-terror law put on hold while government considers legal definition of terrorism|url=https://www.straitstimes.com/asia/se-asia/revisions-to-indonesias-anti-terror-law-put-on-hold-while-government-considers-legal|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=The Straits Times|date=1 March 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 8 and 10 May 2018, [[2018 Mako Brimob standoff|a standoff]] occurred at the [[Mobile Brigade Corps]]' headquarters in [[Depok]], resulting in the deaths of five police officers. While the incident and hostage situation ended with the 155 rioters surrendering,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=BREAKING: Mako Brimob standoff ends, all inmates surrender: Chief security minister|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/05/10/breaking-mako-brimob-standoff-ends-all-inmates-surrender-chief-security-minister.html|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=The Jakarta Post|date=10 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the aftermath of the event police shot dead four individuals who were suspected terrorists allegedly travelling "to help the rioting prisoners".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Two more terrorist suspects shot dead after Mako Brimob riot|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2018/05/11/two-more-terrorist-suspects-shot-dead-after-mako-brimob-riot.html|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=The Jakarta Post|date=11 May 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Amaq News Agency]] claimed ISIL was responsible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ISIS Claims Responsibility for Riot at Prison Housing Former Jakarta Governor Ahok|url=https://www.vice.com/en_id/article/zm8b48/isis-claims-responsibility-for-riot-at-prison-housing-former-jakarta-governor-ahok|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=Vice|date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly afterwards, the perpetrators detonated the bomb. The blast immediately killed a child and the security officer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Antony|first1=Noval D.|title=Ledakan di Gereja Santa Maria, Anak-anak Jadi Korban|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4017967/ledakan-di-gereja-santa-maria-anak-anak-jadi-korban|accessdate=13 May 2018|work=Detik.com|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immediately after that, they detonated the bomb. The second video showed the bombing from a front door near the entrance. At the time, people were walking out from the church and several others were entering the church as the first mass had finished. The perpetrators immediately detonated their devices as they were stopped by security. As the explosion happened, multiple people inside the church began to panic. Several people who lived nearby mistook the explosion as an earthquake. The church's windows were blown. However, the exterior suffered minimal damage. The building located in the entrance was destroyed. Authorities reported that 5 people and 2 perpetrators were killed in the first attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bom di Gereja Surabaya, Saksi: Ada Getaran Seperti Gempa|last=Antony|first=Noval D.|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4017981/bom-di-gereja-surabaya-saksi-ada-getaran-seperti-gempa|work=Detik.com|date=13 May 2018|language=id|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third===
The third attack occurred at the GPPS, located on Arjuno Street on 07:53 WIB. At least two explosions were heard in the third attack, both were caused by the detonation of two explosive devices.

==Investigation==
Hours after the attacks, the Chief of the Indonesian National Police [[Tito Karnavian]], stated in a news conference that [[Jamaah Ansharut Daulah]], a local branch of the [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|Islamic State]], was the group who was responsible for perpetrating the attacks. The group was responsible for the previous [[2016 Samarinda church bombing|church bombing in Samarinda]] in 2016 and was also blamed for a series of attacks against the Indonesian police in 2016 and 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kapolri: Satu Keluarga Pengebom Gereja Surabaya Jaringan JAD|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4018572/kapolri-satu-keluarga-pengebom-gereja-surabaya-jaringan-jad|last=Prasetia|first=Andhika|work=Detik.com|date=13 May 2018|accessdate=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He later added that based on eyewitness accounts, the attackers were probably from the same family. Multiple people claimed that prior to the attack, the woman and her two childrens, aged 12 and 9, in the second attack were dropped off from an SUV. According to him, the man who drove the SUV was her husband. He then drove the SUV and rammed it into the GPPS, where the third attack occurred. Their sons were the ones who drove the motorcycle in the first attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kapolri: Pengebom Gereja Surabaya Diduga Satu Keluarga|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4018529/kapolri-pengebom-gereja-surabaya-diduga-satu-keluarga|last=Prasetia|first=Andhika|work=Detik.com|date=13 May 2018|accessdate=13 May 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to official report, the perpetrators had just got back from "education" in Syria. The family, according to Tito, was among the 500 people who were monitored by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Keluarga Pengebom Gereja Surabaya Baru Pulang 'Sekolah' dari Suriah|last=Rinanda |first= Hilda M.|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4018581/keluarga-pengebom-gereja-surabaya-baru-pulang-sekolah-dari-suriah|work=Detik.com|date=13 May 2018|accessdate=13 May 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Australian counter-terrorism expert Professor Greg Barton of [[Deakin University]] stated that the perpetrators are 'self-contained', deliberately cut off every communication with the other members via digital communications to avoid detection from the police. According to him, this was similar to the [[November 2015 Paris attacks]]. He later added that the weak anti-terror law in Indonesia caused terrorists in Indonesia to travel to Iraq and Syria with ease, and that those who might have been involved with the Islamic State wouldn't be punished by the authorities. There was also considerable concern on the use of children in terror attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Devianti|last1=Faridz|first2=Euan|last2=McKirdy|first3=Eliza|last3=Mackintosh|title=Three families were behind the ISIS-inspired bombings in Indonesia's Surabaya, police said|url=http://www.abc17news.com/news/national-world/surabaya-hit-with-another-attack-in-wake-of-church-bombings/741525169 |work=[[KMIZ]]|date=14 May 2018|accessdate=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Motive===
Indonesian National Police revealed that the attacks were directly ordered by [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIL]] as revenge for the imprisonment of Aman Abdurrahman, the leader of JAD and JAT in Indonesia.&lt;ref name="Kapolri"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kapolri Sebut Bom Surabaya Aksi Balasan karena Pimpinan JAD Ditangkap|url=https://nasional.kompas.com/read/2018/05/14/12580671/kapolri-sebut-bom-surabaya-aksi-balasan-karena-pimpinan-jad-ditangkap|date=14 May 2018|language=id|last=Faizal |first=Achmad|work=Kompas.com|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abdurrahman should have been released from jail on August 2017, but he was arrested again by the police as he was alleged to have supplied weapons and funds for the terrorists who executed the [[2016 Jakarta attacks]]. He was in prison at the time for his role in conducting training for terrorists in Aceh.&lt;ref name="Kapolri"/&gt;

In response to his imprisonment, the leadership in JAD was handed to Zainal Anshori. However, Anshori was immediately arrested after authorities stated that he was involved in weapon smuggling in Southern Philippines. This reportedly infuriated the members of the JAD and JAT. In response, the members of the JAD and the JAT started to attack civilians and police officers. The first major attack was the [[2018 Mako Brimob standoff]], days before the Surabaya bombings.&lt;ref name="Dita"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kapolri: Dita Pengebom Gereja Surabaya Ketua JAD di Surabaya|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/d-4018759/kapolri-dita-pengebom-gereja-surabaya-ketua-jad-di-surabaya|work=Detik.com|language=id|accessdate=14 May 2018|last=Rinanda |first= Hilda M. |date=13 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Raids and arrests===
Hours after the incident in Wonocolo, Indonesian police raided a house in Masanganwetan, Sukodono, Sidoarjo. During the raid, a shootout erupted between a suspected terrorist and the police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Densus 88 Baku Tembak Dengan Kelompok Teroris di Sidoarjo |language=id |url=https://nasional.tempo.co/read/1088635/densus-88-baku-tembak-dengan-kelompok-teroris-di-sidoarjo|work=Tempo.co|accessdate=14 May 2018 |editor-last=Susanto|editor-first=Elik|date=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terrorist was later shot and killed.

In response to the bombings, the Chief of the Indonesian National Police Tito Karnavian stated that this is the time for the revision of the anti-terror bill, later urged the members of the Indonesian House of Representatives to revise the anti-terrorism bill, which was viewed as a weak bill by many. According to Tito, terrorists easily evaded arrests due to the bill. Police couldn't arrest and prevent terror attacks due to the absence of a strong terror bill. The police technically couldn't arrest the terror suspects if the terror attack had not been executed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kapolri: Revisi UU Antiterorisme Bisa Buat JAD Organisasi Teroris|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4018653/kapolri-revisi-uu-antiterorisme-bisa-buat-jad-organisasi-teroris|work=Detik.com|last=Prasetia|first=Andhika|language=id|date=13 May 2018|accessdate=14 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conspiracies and hoaxes===
In the wake of the attacks, many people began to accuse the police and the government that the attack was a false flag, which resulted in numerous accounts being reported to the police. A woman was arrested on 14 May 2018 in [[Sukadana]], [[West Kalimantan]] for her viral Facebook post accusing the government of having conducted the bombings as a [[false flag]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sebut Bom Surabaya Rekayasa, Akun Facebook Seorang Oknum Kepala Sekolah Dicekal Polisi|url=http://jogja.tribunnews.com/2018/05/14/sebut-bom-surabaya-rekayasa-akun-facebook-seorang-oknum-kepala-sekolah-dicekal-polisi|accessdate=15 May 2018|work=Tribunnews.com|date=14 May 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was a state junior high school (Sekolah Menengah Pertama Negeri, SMPN) headmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Santoso|first=Audrey|title=Wanita yang Sebar Hoax Bom Surabaya Adalah Kepala Sekolah|work=Detik.com|url=https://detik.com/news/berita/4020242/polisi-tangkap-netizen-yang-tuduh-bom-surabaya-pengalihan-isu|accessdate=15 May 2018|date=14 May 2018|language=id}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, a representative of a group named 212 Guard (Garda 212) also said that the bombings were false flag made to suppress those who were against the sitting government and demanding new president. The group itself was notorious for pushing the imprisonment of the Christian–Chinese [[Governor of Jakarta]] [[Basuki Tjahaja Purnama]], hence their namesake which refers to the [[December 2016 Jakarta protests]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garda 212: Isu Aksi Teroris Pengalihan Isu 2019 Ganti Presiden|date=14 May 2018|work=Suara.com|accessdate=15 May 2018 |url=https://www.suara.com/news/2018/05/14/182141/garda-212-isu-aksi-teroris-pengalihan-isu-2019-ganti-presiden |last1=Gunadha|first1=Reza|first2=Dian |last2=Rosmala|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that the terrorists were innocent and should not be blamed for the bombings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Garda 212: Bom Surabaya Pengalihan Isu, Jangan Salahkan Teroris|date=15 May 2018|language=id|work=Suara.com |accessdate=15 May 2018|last1=Gunadha |first1=Reza |url=https://www.suara.com/news/2018/05/14/182141/garda-212-isu-aksi-teroris-pengalihan-isu-2019-ganti-presiden|first2=Dian|last2=Rosmala}}&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, another civil servant was arrested in [[Lhokseumawe]], [[Aceh]] for hate speech related to the attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Yusman |first=Deni|title=Kepala Dinas di Lhokseumawe Ditangkap karena Ujaran Kebencian|accessdate=16 May 2018|date=15 May 2018 |language=id |url=http://www.rri.co.id/lhokseumawe/post/berita/528321/sigap_polres/plt_kadis_dpmg_lhokseumawe_ditahan_karena_dugaan_ujaran_kebencian_di_facebook.html|work=[[Radio Republik Indonesia|RRI]].co.id}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 May 2018, a lecturer working at the [[University of North Sumatra]] was arrested for saying the same as the aforementioned headmaster.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Resi|first=Erlangga|title=Dipamerkan Polisi, Dosen USU 'Bom Surabaya Pengalihan Isu' Pingsan |work=Detik.com |url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4029741/dipamerkan-polisi-dosen-usu-bom-surabaya-pengalihan-isu-pingsan|accessdate=22 May 2018|date=20 May 2018 |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many politicians, [[Mohammad Mahfud]] for instance, condemned those who supported the false flag theory, stating that those people are psychopathic and basically are no different than the terrorists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kultwit Mahfud MD soal Terorisme yang Dianggap Rekayasa|last=Kurnia|first=Tommy|language=id |url=https://www.liputan6.com/tekno/read/3524721/kultwit-mahfud-md-soal-terorisme-yang-dianggap-rekayasa |work=Liputan6.com|accessdate=15 May 2018|date=15 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ruhut Sitompul: Mereka yang Mengatakan Teror Sebagai Pengalihan Isu Lebih Sangat Biadab|last=Naren|first=Dian |url=http://wow.tribunnews.com/2018/05/15/ruhut-sitompul-mereka-yang-mengatakan-teror-sebagai-pengalihan-isu-lebih-sangat-biadab?page=all|accessdate=15 May 2018|work=Tribunnews.com|date=14 May 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hoaxes of bombs being detonated in other locations also spread through the internet. A man was arrested in [[Duren Sawit]] subdistrict of Jakarta for creating a post on Facebook saying a church there was attacked as well. He claimed to have intended it as a prank.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hariyanto|first=Ibnu|title=Motif Penyebar Isu Hoax Bom di Duren Sawit: Iseng|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4021312/motif-penyebar-isu-hoax-bom-di-duren-sawit-iseng|accessdate=15 May 2018|work=Detik.com|date=15 May 2018|language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rise of Islamophobia===
In the immediate aftermath of the attacks, there were rise in [[Islamophobia]] in Indonesia, even among Muslims. These hate crimes, however, were specifically targeted to niqab wearing women and Muslim men with long beard.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Viral Video Aksi 'Peluk Saya' Hijaber Bercadar di Surabaya|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4029312/saat-wanita-bercadar-aksi-peluk-saya-untuk-hilangkan-islamofobia|work=Detik.com|lang=id|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reports revealed that niqab wearing women were harassed, stared at and called terrorists. Police stated that these hate crimes couldn't be tolerated, later added that even one of the relatives of the victims of the attacks was a niqab wearing woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Menyusul serangan teror, pemakai cadar dan celana cingkrang menangkis kecurigaan|publisher=BBC |lang=id|url=http://www.bbc.com/indonesia/trensosial-44199590}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Viral Video Aksi Peluk Saya Hijaber Bercadar Di Surabaya|url=https://news.detik.com/berita-jawa-timur/d-4032680/viral-video-aksi-peluk-saya-hijaber-bercadar-di-surabaya|work=Detik.com|lang=id |accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several social experiments to tackle Islamophobia were later conducted across Indonesia. In Jakarta, a community of niqabis held an act of solidarity to the victims of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=Jangan Islamofobia Hanya Karena Wanita Bercadar!|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4029993/jangan-islamofobia-hanya-karena-wanita-bercadar|work=Detik.com|lang=id|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They later voiced their support to the police to tackle terrorism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citeweb|title=3 Wanita Bercadar Ikut Aksi Dukung Polri Berantas Terorisme di CFD|url=https://news.detik.com/berita/4029226/3-wanita-bercadar-ikut-aksi-dukung-polri-berantas-terorisme-di-cfd|work=Detik.com|lang=id|accessdate=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pekanbaru sword attack==
On 16 May 2018, a group of men attacked the Riau Regional Police headquarters in [[Pekanbaru]], [[Riau]]. The attack started when an SUV rammed into the police station and struck people and vehicles, including two journalists from [[tvOne (Indonesia)|tvOne]] and [[MNCTV]]. Police said masked men carrying [[katana|katanas]] attacked and hacked several people in the station. All but one of the attackers were shot dead. One police officer was killed. Two police officers and two journalists were injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2 Wartawan Korban Serangan di Mapolda Riau Dibawa ke RS Bhayangkara |author=M.

'''Two referendums''' were held in [[Switzerland]] in 1879.&lt;ref name=NS&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] &amp; Stöver, P (2010) ''Elections in Europe: A data handbook'', pp1902–1903 {{ISBN|9783832956097}}&lt;/ref&gt; A federal law on subsidies for railways in the [[Alps]] was passed by 70.7% of voters on 19 January, whilst a referendum on the [[death penalty]] on 18 May was passed by 52.5% of voters and a majority of cantons.

==Background==
The January referendum on rail subsidies was classed as an [[optional referendum]],&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; which meant that only a majority of the public vote was required for the proposals to be approved. The referendum on the death penalty involved amending article 65 of the federal constitution, and was a [[mandatory referendum]],&lt;ref name=NS/&gt; which required both a majority of voters and cantons to approve the proposals.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen &amp; Stöver, p1891&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Terrorism]], in some of its definitions, serves to communicate a message from terrorists to a target audience (TA). By extension, [[symbol]]s play an important role in such communication, through graphics that the organizations use to represent themselves, as well as the meaning and significance behind their choice of targets.&lt;ref name="Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives"&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hair|first=H. Dan|title=Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Hampton Press Inc.|location=Cresskill, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Symbolism of terrorist groups==
Terrorist organizations use [[graphic]] marks and insignias as symbols to represent their [[ideology]], purpose, and goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|website=The Trump Enigma|title=International Terrorism Symbol Database|url=http://www.thetrumpenigma.com/islamic-symbols.html|accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These insignias are replete with meaningful [[symbol]]s that communicate the message, purpose, history, and goals of the organizations. As such, they contribute to the creation of unique organizational culture.&lt;ref name="Psychology of Terrorism"&gt;{{cite book|last=Borum|first=Randy|title=Psychology of Terrorism|year=2004|publisher=University of South Florida|location=South Florida|url=https://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/grants/208552.PDF |accessdate=22 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few databases exist which catalog the symbols used in terrorist images and propaganda, the most prominent of which are the [[International Terrorist Symbols Database]] and the [[Islamic Imagery Project]]. Also exist the academic research "Terroristica"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=9463|title=Terroristica: Flags and Emblems of Armed Non-Governmental Organizations|last=Zharinov|first=Konstantin|date=|website=www.novapublishers.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;. 

===International Terrorist Symbols Database===
The International Terrorist Symbols Database is a compilation of insignias from terrorist organizations put together by the Anti-Defamation League. Published on their website, it features profiles of thirty different symbols from groups such as [[Al Qaeda in Iraq]], [[Hamas]], [[Hezbollah]], the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], the [[Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine]], and others. Not all of the groups discussed are officially recognized on the [[U.S. State Department]]'s Foreign Terrorist Organizations list, yet they all have references to attacks made by the organization. Each image profile contains a description of the insignia, an explanation of the symbols involved, and a detailed history of the organization’s history, ideology, goals, leaders, and major attacks. Below are examples of a few of the terrorist images included in the database, along with the corresponding analysis of the symbols involved in the image.&lt;ref name="International Terrorist Symbols Database"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Al Qaeda in Iraq====

One of several emblems used by Al Qaeda in Iraq, the adjacent image depicts a gray globe positioned in a black background. On top of the globe is an open [[Quran]], from which a rifle, a fist, and a flag emerge. The yellow writing beneath the globe may be translated as "Monotheism and Jihad."

The flag represents Al Qaeda in Iraq's goal of creating an Islamic [[caliphate]],while its color denotes the death and the militant means the organization is willing to take to achieve this goal. The rifle and fist are also symbols of militancy. By positioning these symbols on top of the Quran, the image communicates the foundation of their mission in Islam, while the globe indicates their worldwide ambitions for their goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database-- Al Qaeda in Iraq|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/al_qaeda_iraq.asp|accessdate=12/01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The color green has represented Islam since its founding. Consequently, the green coloring of the central image indicates the organization's tie to Islam. Similar to the symbolism used by Al Qaeda in Iraq, the rifle represents commitment to militancy, while the globe indicates international involvement and ambition for their goals. The Quran indicates both a foundation in Islam, and their goal to found an Islamic state that encompasses Lebanon and Israel. Finally, the Islamic verse, which is from the Quran, bolsters support for their activities by citing a verse that celebrates and supports those who fight for Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database -- Hezbollah|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/hezbollah.asp|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The database does not analyze the symbolism of the seven-leafed branch,

====Muslim Brotherhood====

The emblem of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] depicts two cross swords beneath a red Quran, both of which are placed within a green circle that sits in a brown square. Inscribed on the Quran is the phrase, "Truly, it is a generous Quran." Below the swords reads, "Be Prepared."

Once again, the color green, as well as the presence of a Quran, symbolizes the foundation of the Muslim Brotherhood in [[Islam]]. The presence of swords indicate militancy, yet the choice to use them in the place of guns symbolizes the Muslim Brotherhood's connection to the historic Islam. The motto "Be Prepared" references a verse in the Quran that warns Muslims to be prepared to fight enemies of God.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/muslim_brotherhood_1.asp|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123121653/http://adl.org/terrorism/symbols/muslim_brotherhood_1.asp|archivedate=2013-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The analysis does not discuss the quote on the Quran.

====Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam====

The central figure of the image is a yellow tiger, which is surrounded by a ring of bullets and crossed by two rifles. The script both around the tiger, in [[Tamil language|Tamil]], and below the tiger, in English, reads "[[Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam]]."

[[Eelam]] is Tamil for the Island of Sri Lanka, which the groups seeks to liberate from the control of the [[Sinhalese people|Sinhalese]] majority. The tiger is a culturally important animal that symbolizes heroism, militancy, and patriotism. Its centrality in this image indicates the desire of the Liberation Tigers to be self-determined and independent. The bullets and rifles indicate their employment of violence as the means to achieve these goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=International Terrorist Symbols Database -- Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam|url=http://www.adl.org/terrorism/symbols/liberation_tigers_te2.asp|publisher=Anti-Defamation League|accessdate=12/1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130123121540/http://adl.org/terrorism/symbols/liberation_tigers_te2.asp|archivedate=2013-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Islamic Imagery Project===
The Islamic Imagery Project is a report published in 2006 by the [[Combating Terrorism Center]], a division of the Department of Social Sciences at the [[United States Military Academy]]. At the most basic level, the report is meant to be a practical exploration of the meaning of various jihadi symbols in order to better understand, and counteract, jihadi thought and the influence of these organizations. The forward to the report cites the powerful role “pictures, motifs, and images,” as well as the emotions they evoke, play in gaining a better understanding of the message and purpose of [[jihad]] terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Islamic Imagery Project|year=2006|publisher=Combating Terrorism Center at West Point|location=West Point, NY|url=http://www.ctc.usma.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The preface explains that the authors intend to extend the study of imagery beyond the realm of art history, into modern symbols of violent jihadi groups, which they cite as the primary method these groups promote and reinforce their ideologies:

“Visual motifs accomplish several objectives for jihadi propagandists. First, they create a mental conception of reality for their audiences. The use of carefully edited images evokes existing emotional or historical memories, eliciting an emotional response that may be conscious or subconscious…. Secondly, they help the author, or propagandist, communicate a message, which is often a visual argument for something or against something. Texts and language, including imagery, provide interactive ways for jihadis to engage the ideology itself.”&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project"/&gt;

Critics of the project have deemed it oversimplified, arguing that much more study has yet to go into a symbolic analysis of terrorist imagery.&lt;ref name="Violent Jihadi Imagery Muslim Observer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cook|first=Geoffrey|title=Violent Jihadi Imagery|url=http://muslimmedianetwork.com/mmn/?p=4373|accessdate=5 December 2011|newspaper=The Muslim Observer|date=23 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Others have deemed it the best interpretation, in English, of imagery used by terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="The Changing Character of War"&gt;{{cite book|last=Strachan|first=Hew|title=The Changing Character of War|year=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=United States}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The document is a catalog of the 100 most common motifs in jihadist visual propaganda that the Combating Terrorism Center deemed significant. These motifs are sorted into five categories: Nature; Geography, Political Symbols, and States; People; Weapons, Warfare, and the Afterlife; Other. An example of a symbol from each category is provided below.

====Nature: the Moon====

The moon is an extremely important symbol in Islam which has astrological, religious, and spiritual significance. Jihadi imagery typically simplifies this complex symbol, using to evoke the notion of the divine and a connection to Islamic identity and, for full moons in particular, the afterlife. When paired with images that reference martyrdom, the moon suggests that there will be a heavenly reward for the martyr. In the example image on the right, the presence of a white horse and clouds around the man's portrait indicate that he is a martyr, and the moon evokes the benefit he will gain for his sacrifice in heaven.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

====Geography, Political Symbols, and States: Inverted Currency====

Inverted currency is a symbol that seeks to undermine typical power structures of Western countries. Currency is understood by many terrorist groups to represent Western materialism, power, and dominance. It is also an extremely powerful cultural symbol in the West, one that is closely tied to the national identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lauer|first=Josh|title=Money as Mass Communication: U.S. Paper Currency and the Iconography of Nationalism|journal=The Communication Review|date=May 2008|volume=11|issue=2|pages=109–132|url=http://www.tandfonline.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/doi/full/10.1080/10714420802068359|doi=10.1080/10714420802068359}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, the inversion of currency by terrorist groups, as seen in the example at right, is a symbolic way of transferring the power of Western nations to the terrorists. By replacing Benjamin Franklin with Osama Bin Laden, the image seeks to symbolically argue that Osama Bin Laden and Al Qaeda have the power to undermine basic sources of American power, and turn the United States against itself.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

====People: Women====

Woman are commonly a symbol of masculine honor, pride, and purity. They are often depicted as innocent victims that jihadi efforts need to protect from dominance and abuse by the West or other enemies. Often, women are depicted in images as innocent and helpless victims of anti-Muslim oppression, and in need of protection. The intended effect is to create a sense of anger and need to protect one's pride and honor, in order to spur the audience to anger supporting or aiding the jihadi movements. Women are also portrayed as martyrs, in order to make Muslim men feel a sense of shame and oppression that their women are forced to fight against an oppressive force. In this way, it serves to shame men into action as much as it celebrates the sacrifice of the women martyrs.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

====Weapons, Warfare, and the Afterlife: Modern Weapons====

Modern [[weapons]] reinforce the violent nature of jihadi warfare and symbolize the use of military technology to gain power and accomplish goals. The Islamic Imagery Project argues that depictions of modern weapons often serve to exaggerate the military technology contained by jihadi groups. They also serve as symbols for modern jihadi victories, such as the defeat of the [[Soviet Union]] in [[Afghanistan]], reminders that jihad resistance can overcome Western military dominance. Individuals pose with them to represent their association with and loyalty to the jihad movement, and helps them to construct their identities as participants in jihad. As such, they are understood as heroic symbols of participation in resistance to anti-Muslim oppression.

====Other: Clasped Hands====

A depiction of clasped hands symbolizes unity among the various jihadi groups and the Muslim community at large. The first example, at the right of the page, is an image published by Al Qaeda that uses handshakes to depict unity between Al Qaeda and other jihadi groups, creating a symbolic connection that ties various branches of the jihadi movement together. The clasped hands in the second example illustrate unity of the Muslim community as a whole. Each of the arms is a slightly different shade, representing the desire to bring the mission to bring the mission of specific jihad movements, which are often nation-based, to the international Muslim community.&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

==Symbolism of target choice==
Terrorist acts may be considered a form of communication with victims, spectators, and the perpetrators.&lt;ref name="Terrorism as Communication"&gt;{{cite web|last=Decker|first=Warren|title=Terrorism as Communication|url=http://www.eric.ed.gov/PDFS/ED196091.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Attacks often are not interpreted simply as violent acts, but as statements that communicate a specific intended message. Since the rhetoric is largely non-verbal (though many terrorist attacks are followed by claims of responsibility and explanation), symbols play an important role in creating meaningful messages, and consequently become central to the mission and effectiveness of terrorism.&lt;ref name="Psychology of Terrorism" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Gus|title=Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues|year=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications|location=Thousand Oaks, California}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Targets are strategically chosen to both destroy and create symbols that communicate a desired message and create an effect on the audience.  O'Hair and Heath argue that "selection of the targets of terrorism is strategic, made because of their potential rhetorical impact.”   &lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder"&gt;{{cite book|title=Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|author=Robert Heath |author2=Dan O'Hair}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perspective is reinforced in the book "Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues," in which Gus Martin argues that "terrorists select their targets because of their symbolic and propaganda value. High-profile, sentimental, or otherwise significant targets are chosen with the expectation that the target's constituency will be moved and that the victims' audience will in some way suffer." &lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt; Locations are chosen because of the symbolism they already contain, and the ability of the terrorist group to manipulate this symbolism through an attack.

The symbolic choices of terrorist targets are not only meant to send isolated messages, but reflect the greater symbolic rhetoric of terrorism in general. Terrorism, it has been argued, refutes the strategy of gaining ideological victory through a single act. Instead, "the rhetorical stance of terrorism... is patient, the chipping away at the symbolic or ideological foundation of its targets.”   &lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder"/&gt; Each target is strategically chosen to fit into the greater message.

By carefully selecting targets, terrorists use acts of destruction to both destroy and create cultural symbols that promote fear and compliance among their target audience, and that often communicate specific ideological messages.&lt;ref name="Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives" /&gt; For example, in their book ''Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspective'', O'Hair et al. describe the choice of the World Trade Center towers as a target for the 9/11 attack: "The Twin towers of the WTC stood as the very image of globalization, capitalism, and Western economic superiority... their collapse both exposed and symbolized 'the vulnerability of governmental power (Juergensemeyer, 2001, pg. 32), and the fragile nature of the dominant cultural worldview." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Hair|first=H. Dan|title=Terrorism: Communication and Rhetorical Perspectives|year=2008|publisher=Hampton Press Inc.|location=Cresskill, NJ|pages=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===September 11th===

The effectiveness of the World Trade Center towers as a symbol is apparent in the discussion that continues about them today.&lt;ref name="9/11's Most Controversial Photo"&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Jonathan|title=The meaning of 9/11's most controversial photo|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/sep/02/911-photo-thomas-hoepker-meaning?fb_source=tickerdialog_multiline&amp;fb_action_types=news.reads&amp;fb_action_ids=10150869560575104&amp;fb_ref=U-GCfNziF1gfnn4uPSIKY2dW-CFCONX01FRS-3xj66XXX|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=23 October 2011|location=London|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many argue they were chosen because the towers represent Western power, wealth, commerce, and materialism.&lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nouriani Winter 2011 19–30"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nouriani|first=D. Steven|title=The Defensive Misappropriation and Corruption of Cultural Symbols|journal=Jung Journal: Culture and Psyche|date=Winter 2011|volume=5|issue=1|pages=19–30|doi=10.1525/jung.2011.5.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not just the activities they represent, but also their stature, made them a good target. The towers dominated the New York City skyline, making their loss, and the symbolic destruction of American commerce and power, all the more visible.&lt;ref name="Nouriani Winter 2011 19–30"/&gt; Similarly, the Pentagon was a strategic target because of its symbolism as the branch of the American government which protects the country.&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt; The terrorists behind 9/11 sought to undermine these greater themes of American life by attacking the symbols that embody them.&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt;&lt;ref name="From the Eyes of the Beholder" /&gt;

Upon their destruction, the World Trade Center towers did not cease to exist as an important cultural symbol. In their book ''Defining Visual Rhetorics'', Charles Hill and Margeurite Helmers discuss the revision of the symbolism of the towers upon their destruction: "Strong national symbols such as the eagle and the flag are liberally in use in the popular and mass media as a means of gathering together the imagined national community, and to these patriotic and sentimental images the twin towers of the World Trade Center have been added in the way that the red poppy came to symbolize the First World War." &lt;ref name="Defining Visual Rhetorics"&gt;{{cite book|title=Defining Visual Rhetorics|year=2004|publisher=Lawrence Erlbaum Associates|location=Mahwah, New Jersey|author1=Hill, Charles |author2= Margeurite Helmers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Oklahoma City Bombing===

[[File:Oklahoma City National Memorial 4886.jpg|thumb|Oklahoma City National Memorial]]

The [[Oklahoma City bombing]] is another terrorist attack that has become highly symbolic in the American psyche. As a member of the [[Patriot Movement]], and fearing a [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)|New World Order]], the choice of the Oklahoma City Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building by Timothy McVeigh was meant to convey a message of resistance to the federal government. McVeigh sought to undermine the role of the Federal Government in society by visually destroying its presence.&lt;ref name="Understanding Terrorism: Challenges, Perspectives, and Issues" /&gt;

Discussion of symbolism as it relates to the Oklahoma City Bombing now centers around symbols of hope, healing, and recovery. After the bombing, city planners carefully considered what to do with the remains of the building because of the importance it had to the public as a place were many were killed. Some referred to it as “sacred ground.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Linenthal|first=Edward|title=The Unfinished Bombing: Oklahoma City in American Memory|year=2001|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; A memorial, called the “Outdoor Symbolic Memorial” was built on the site. Several monuments make up the memorial: the Gates of Time, which depicts “the innocence of the city before the attack… and the hope that came from the horror in the moments and days following the attack”; the Field of Empty chairs, which lies on the footprint of the building, and is made up of 168 chairs to represent each of the victims; the Survivor tree, a tree which bore the full brunt of the attack and remained standing, transforming it into “a living symbol of resilience.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbolism|url=http://www.oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/secondary.php?section=2&amp;catid=30|publisher=Oklahoma City National Memorial and Museum|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090220104853/http://www.oklahomacitynationalmemorial.org/secondary.php?section=2&amp;catid=30|archivedate=2009-02-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite McVeigh’s intentions to make the Alfred P. Murrah building a visual depiction of the destruction of government, it, along with the public's response to the bombing, has been transformed by the public into a symbol of recovery and healing. Though terrorism seeks to create symbols, their meaning may be changed by similarly symbolic rhetoric created by the victims of the original attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Oklahoma City : After the Bomb: Symbol of Healing|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1995-04-30/news/mn-60677_1_oklahoma-city-bomb | work=Los Angeles Times | date=30 April 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Symbols of Hope|url=http://www.classbrain.com/artmonument/publish/oklahoma_city_bombing.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The psychology of symbols==

Psychology discusses the effect of symbols on the human mind, and gives insight into why the rhetoric of terrorism may be conducted partly through symbols. An overview of the psychology of symbols is relevant to terrorism because it is in the mind that symbols find validation and reality, allowing terrorist attacks create an effect on a wide audience.&lt;ref name="Defining Visual Rhetorics" /&gt;

The influence of images on humans has long been studied by art historians. [[David Freedberg]], argues that humans react to images not simply on a cognitive level, but on an emotional one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Freedberg|first=David|title=The Power of Images: Studies in the history and theory of response|year=1991|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the  psychology of persuasion has noted that if people see a symbol of authority, even if they know  the groups or person projecting the symbol has no actual authority, they begin to believe that there is real authority in that party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Robert|title=The Power of Persuasion: How We're Bought and Sold|year=2003|publisher=John Wiley and Sons|location=Hoboken, New Jersey}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these theories contribute to arguments scholars make about the role of psychology in terrorism by helping to explain why humans react to terrorist attacks.

Psychology also contributes to the understanding of how visual propaganda put forward by terrorist groups contributes to their organization. In the book, “Psychology of Terrorism,” author [[Randy Borum]] argues that projecting an image of solidarity and power makes terrorist groups more attractive as social collectives, even if the person joining the group does not at the outset believe in its ideology. A sense of belonging is one of the primary motivating factors for people joining terrorist groups.&lt;ref name="Psychology of Terrorism" /&gt; Many symbols cited by the Islamic Imagery Project and the International Terrorist Symbols Database reference this notion of community or belonging.&lt;ref name="International Terrorist Symbols Database" /&gt;&lt;ref name="The Islamic Imagery Project" /&gt;

==The role of the media==

"The communications media, whether consciously or otherwise, has well served the terrorist cause. Political terrorism is now viewed as an instant means of communication and is aided and abetted by contemporary technology, utilizing the dramatic force of the mass media." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedlander|first=Robert A.|title=Coping with Terrorism: What is to be done?|journal=Terrorism: Theory and Practice|year=1979|series=Westview Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The media plays a large role in communicating information about terrorist attacks, and consequently contributes to the propagation of attacks as symbols. Through television, the internet, newspapers, and journals, the media allows the general population to witness terrorism as it occurs, which some have argued makes it iconic and creates an odd fixation on terrorism within the general population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Der Derian|first=James|title=Imaging Terror: Logos, Pathos, and Ethos|journal=Third World Quarterly|year=2005|volume=26|issue=1|doi=10.1080/0143659042000322883 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Terrorism is a topic that fits well into the demands of the news industry. [[Russell Farnen]] notes that, “Terrorism is different, dramatic, and potentially violent. It frequently develops over a period of time, occurs in exotic locations, offers a clear confrontation, involves bizarre characters, and is politically noteworthy. Finally, it is of concern to the public.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farnen|first=Russell|title=Terrorism and the Mass Media: A systematic analysis of a symbiotic process|journal=Terrorism|year=1990|volume=13|pages=99–123|doi=10.1080/10576109008435820}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that the attention paid to these attacks only gives them credence and power they don’t deserve: “Without massive news coverage the terrorist act would resemble the proverbial tree falling in the forest: if no one learned of an incident, it would be as if it had not occurred.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nacos|first=Brigitte|title=Accomplice or Witness? The media's role in terrorism|journal=Current History|pages=174–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''vampire''' is a being from [[folklore]] that subsists by feeding on the [[Vitalism|vital force]] (generally in the form of [[blood]]) of the living. In [[European folklore]], vampires were [[undead]] beings that often visited loved ones and caused mischief or deaths in the neighbourhoods they inhabited when they were alive. They wore [[shroud]]s and were often described as bloated and of ruddy or dark countenance, markedly different from today's gaunt, pale vampire which dates from the early 19th century.

Vampiric entities have been [[Vampire folklore by region|recorded in most cultures]]; the term ''vampire'' was popularised in Western Europe after reports of an 18th century [[mass hysteria]] of a pre-existing folk belief in the [[Balkans]] and [[Eastern Europe]] that in some cases resulted in corpses being staked and people being accused of vampirism.&lt;ref name="SU223"&gt;Silver, A., &amp; Ursini, J. (1997). ''The Vampire Film: From Nosferatu to Interview with the Vampire'' (pp. 22–23). New York: Limelight Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; Local variants in Eastern Europe were also known by different names, such as ''[[shtriga]]'' in [[Albanian mythology|Albania]], ''[[vrykolakas]]'' in [[Greece]] and ''[[strigoi]]'' in [[Folklore of Romania|Romania]].

In modern times, the vampire is generally held to be a fictitious entity, although belief in similar vampiric creatures such as the ''[[chupacabra]]'' still persists in some cultures. Early folk belief in vampires has sometimes been ascribed to the ignorance of the body's process of [[decomposition]] after death and how people in pre-industrial societies tried to rationalise this, creating the figure of the vampire to explain the mysteries of death. [[Porphyria]] was linked with legends of vampirism in 1985 and received much media exposure, but has since been largely discredited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/1321/did-vampires-suffer-from-the-disease-porphyria-or-not "Dear Cecil" column from straightdope.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/born-to-the-purple-the-st/|title=Born to the Purple: the Story of Porphyria |last=Lane |first=Nick |authorlink=Nick Lane |date=16 December 2002 |newspaper=Scientific American |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170126142231/https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/born-to-the-purple-the-st/|archive-date=26 January 2017|dead-url=no|access-date=26 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The charismatic and sophisticated vampire of modern fiction was born in 1819 with the publication of "[[The Vampyre]]" by [[John William Polidori|John Polidori]]; the story was highly successful and arguably the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="SU373"&gt;Silver, A., &amp; Ursini, J. (1997). ''The Vampire Film: From Nosferatu to Interview with the Vampire'' (pp. 37–38). New York: Limelight Editions.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bram Stoker]]'s 1897 novel ''[[Dracula]]'' is remembered as the quintessential [[vampire literature|vampire novel]] and provided the basis of the modern vampire legend, even though it was published after [[Sheridan Le Fanu|Joseph Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s 1872 novel ''[[Carmilla]]''. The success of this book spawned a distinctive vampire [[genre]], still popular in the 21st century, with books, [[vampire films|films]], television shows, and video games. The vampire has since become a dominant figure in the [[horror fiction|horror]] genre.

== Etymology ==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' dates the first appearance of the English word ''vampire'' (as ''vampyre'') in English from 1734, in a travelogue titled ''Travels of Three English Gentlemen'' published in ''[[The Harleian Miscellany]]'' in 1745.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |title=Vampire |encyclopedia=Oxford English Dictionary |editor=J.

The Serbian form has parallels in virtually all [[Slavic languages]]: [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]] and [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] вампир (''vampir''), [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]]: ''vampir'', [[Croatian language|Croatian]] ''vampir'', [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]] ''upír'', [[Polish language|Polish]] ''wąpierz'', and (perhaps [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic]]-influenced) ''upiór'', [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] упир (''upyr''), [[Russian language|Russian]] упырь (''upyr{{'}}''), [[Belarusian language|Belarusian]] упыр (''upyr''), from [[Old East Slavic]] упирь (''upir{{'}}'') (many of these languages have also borrowed forms such as "vampir/wampir" subsequently from the West; these are distinct from the original local words for the creature).

== Folk beliefs ==
{{see also|List of vampires in folklore and mythology}}
The notion of vampirism has existed for millennia. Cultures such as the [[Mesopotamia]]ns, [[Hebrews]], [[Ancient Greece|Ancient Greeks]], and [[Ancient Rome|Romans]] had tales of [[demon]]s and [[spirit]]s which are considered precursors to modern vampires. Despite the occurrence of vampire-like creatures in these ancient civilizations, the folklore for the entity known today as the vampire originates almost exclusively from early 18th-century [[southeast Europe|southeastern Europe]],&lt;ref name="SU223"/&gt; when [[oral culture|verbal traditions]] of many ethnic groups of the region were recorded and published. In most cases, vampires are [[revenant (folklore)|revenants]] of evil beings, [[suicide]] victims, or [[Witchcraft|witches]], but they can also be created by a malevolent spirit [[demonic possession|possessing]] a corpse or by being bitten by a vampire. Belief in such legends became so pervasive that in some areas it caused mass hysteria and even [[public execution]]s of people believed to be vampires.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

It is difficult to make a single, definitive description of the folkloric vampire, though there are several elements common to many European legends. Vampires were usually reported as bloated in appearance, and ruddy, purplish, or dark in colour; these characteristics were often attributed to the recent drinking of blood. Blood was often seen seeping from the mouth and nose when one was seen in its [[shroud]] or coffin and its left eye was often open.&lt;ref name="Barb412"&gt;Barber, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; It would be clad in the linen shroud it was buried in, and its teeth, hair, and nails may have grown somewhat, though in general [[fang]]s were not a feature.&lt;ref name="Barb2"&gt;Barber, p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although vampires were generally described as undead, some folktales spoke of them as living beings.&lt;ref name="Dundes, Alan 1998 pg 13, 14"&gt;Dundes, Alan (ed) (1998) ''The Vampire: A Casebook'' University of Wisconsin Press {{ISBN|0-299-15924-8}} pg 13, 14, 22, 52&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Levkievskaja&gt;{{fr icon}} {{cite journal|last=Levkievskaja|first=E.E.|year=1997|title=La mythologie slave : problèmes de répartition dialectale (une étude de cas : le vampire)|journal=Cahiers Slaves|volume=1|url=http://www.recherches-slaves.paris4.sorbonne.fr/Cahier1/Levkievskaja.htm|accessdate=2007-12-29|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080112192340/http://www.recherches-slaves.paris4.sorbonne.fr/Cahier1/Levkievskaja.htm|archivedate=12 January 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Creating vampires ====
[[File:Ernst6-thumb.gif|thumb|upright|Illustration of a vampire from [[Max Ernst]]'s ''[[Une Semaine de Bonté]]'' (1934)]]

The causes of vampiric generation were many and varied in original folklore. In [[Slavic peoples|Slavic]] and [[Chinese folklore|Chinese]] traditions, any corpse that was jumped over by an animal, particularly a dog or a cat, was feared to become one of the undead.&lt;ref name="Barb30"&gt;Barber, p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt; A body with a wound that had not been treated with boiling water was also at risk. In [[Folklore of Russia|Russian folklore]], vampires were said to have once been witches or people who had rebelled against the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] while they were alive.&lt;ref name="Strange &amp; Amazing"&gt;{{cite book|author=Reader's Digest Association|title=The Reader's Digest Book of strange stories, amazing facts: stories that are bizarre, unusual, odd, astonishing, incredible&amp;nbsp;... but true|year=1988|publisher=Reader's Digest|location=London|isbn=978-0-949819-89-5|pages=432–433|chapter=Vampires Galore!}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cultural practices often arose that were intended to prevent a recently deceased loved one from turning into an undead revenant. Burying a corpse upside-down was widespread, as was placing earthly objects, such as [[scythe]]s or [[sickle]]s,&lt;ref name="Barb5051"&gt;Barber, pp. 50–51.&lt;/ref&gt; near the grave to satisfy any demons entering the body or to appease the dead so that it would not wish to arise from its coffin. This method resembles the [[ancient Greek]] practice of placing an [[Charon's obol|obolus in the corpse's mouth]] to pay the toll to cross the [[River Styx]] in the underworld. It has been argued that instead, the coin was intended to ward off any evil spirits from entering the body, and this may have influenced later vampire folklore. This tradition persisted in modern Greek folklore about the ''[[vrykolakas]],'' in which a wax cross and piece of pottery with the inscription "[[Jesus Christ]] conquers" were placed on the corpse to prevent the body from becoming a vampire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lawson|first=John Cuthbert|title=Modern Greek Folklore and Ancient Greek Religion|pages=405–06|year=1910|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|oclc=1465746|isbn=978-0-524-02024-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other methods commonly practised in Europe included severing the [[patellar ligament|tendons at the knees]] or placing [[poppy]] seeds, [[millet]], or sand on the ground at the grave site of a presumed vampire; this was intended to keep the vampire occupied all night by counting the fallen grains,&lt;ref name="Barb49"&gt;Barber, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; indicating an association of vampires with [[arithmomania]]. Similar Chinese narratives state that if a vampire-like being came across a sack of [[rice]], it would have to count every grain; this is a theme encountered in [[Folklore of India|myths from the Indian subcontinent]], as well as in South American tales of witches and other sorts of evil or mischievous spirits or beings.&lt;ref name=Jaramillo&gt;{{cite book|last=Jaramillo Londoño|first=Agustín|title=Testamento del paisa|year=1986|origyear=1967|edition=7th|publisher=Susaeta Ediciones|location=Medellín|isbn=978-958-95125-0-0|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Albanian folklore, the [[dhampir]] is the hybrid child of the ''karkanxholl'' (a [[werewolf]]-like creature with an iron [[mail (armour)|mail]] shirt) or the ''lugat'' (a water-dwelling [[ghost]] or monster). The dhampir sprung of a karkanxholl has the unique ability to discern the karkanxholl; from this derives the expression ''the dhampir knows the lugat''. The ''lugat'' cannot be seen, he can only be killed by the dhampir, who himself is usually the son of a lugat. In different regions, animals can be revenants as lugats; also, living people during their sleep. ''Dhampiraj'' is also an Albanian surname.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O5biAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=dhampiri Gjurmime albanologjike, ''Folklor dhe etnologji''], Vol. 15, pp. 58–148.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Identifying vampires ====
Many rituals were used to identify a vampire. One method of finding a vampire's grave involved leading a virgin boy through a graveyard or church grounds on a virgin stallion—the horse would supposedly balk at the grave in question.&lt;ref name="Strange &amp; Amazing"/&gt; Generally a black horse was required, though in Albania it should be white.&lt;ref name="Barb6869"&gt;Barber, pp. 68–69.&lt;/ref&gt; Holes appearing in the earth over a grave were taken as a sign of vampirism.&lt;ref name="Barb125"&gt;Barber, p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpses thought to be vampires were generally described as having a healthier appearance than expected, plump and showing little or no signs of decomposition.&lt;ref name="Barb109"&gt;Barber, p. 109.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, when suspected graves were opened, villagers even described the corpse as having fresh blood from a victim all over its face.&lt;ref name="Barb1145"&gt;Barber, pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence that a vampire was active in a given locality included death of cattle, sheep, relatives or neighbours. Folkloric vampires could also make their presence felt by engaging in minor [[poltergeist]]-like activity, such as hurling stones on roofs or moving household objects,&lt;ref name="Barb96"&gt;Barber, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[mara (folklore)|pressing]] on people in their sleep.&lt;ref name="Bun1689"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', pp. 168–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

[[Apotrope|Apotropaics]]—items able to ward off revenants—are common in vampire folklore. [[Garlic]] is a common example,&lt;ref name="Barber6"&gt;Barber, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; a branch of [[rosa acicularis|wild rose]] and [[common hawthorn|hawthorn]] plant are said to harm vampires, and in Europe, sprinkling [[mustard seed]]s on the roof of a house was said to keep them away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mappin|first=Jenni|title=Didjaknow: Truly Amazing &amp; Crazy Facts About&amp;nbsp;... Everything|year=2003|publisher=Pancake|location=Australia|isbn=978-0-330-40171-5|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other apotropaics include sacred items, for example a [[crucifix]], [[rosary]], or [[holy water]]. Vampires are said to be unable to walk on [[consecration|consecrated ground]], such as that of churches or temples, or cross running water.&lt;ref name="Burkhardt221"&gt;Burkhardt, "Vampirglaube und Vampirsage", p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although not traditionally regarded as an apotropaic, [[mirror]]s have been used to ward off vampires when placed, facing outwards, on a door (in some cultures, vampires do not have a reflection and sometimes do not cast a shadow, perhaps as a manifestation of the vampire's lack of a [[soul]]).&lt;ref name=EoOc&gt;{{cite book|last=Spence|first=Lewis|title=An Encyclopaedia of Occultism|year=1960|publisher=University Books|location=New Hyde Parks|oclc=3417655|isbn=978-0-486-42613-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This attribute is not universal (the Greek ''vrykolakas/tympanios'' was capable of both reflection and shadow), but was used by Bram Stoker in ''Dracula'' and has remained popular with subsequent authors and filmmakers.&lt;ref name="SU25"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some traditions also hold that a vampire cannot enter a house unless invited by the owner; after the first invitation they can come and go as they please.&lt;ref name=EoOc/&gt; Though folkloric vampires were believed to be more active at night, they were not generally considered vulnerable to [[sunlight]].&lt;ref name="SU25"/&gt;

Methods of destroying suspected vampires varied, with [[impalement|staking]] the most commonly cited method, particularly in southern Slavic cultures.&lt;ref name="Barber73"&gt;Barber, p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ash tree|Ash]] was the preferred wood in Russia and the Baltic states,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alseikaite-Gimbutiene|first=Marija|authorlink=Marija Gimbutas|title=Die Bestattung in Litauen in der vorgeschichtlichen Zeit|year=1946|location=Tübingen|oclc=1059867|language=de}} (thesis).&lt;/ref&gt; or [[common hawthorn|hawthorn]] in Serbia,&lt;ref name="Vuk59"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vukanović|first=T.P.|year=1959|title=The Vampire|journal=Journal of the Gypsy Lore Society|volume=38|pages=111–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a record of [[oak]] in [[Silesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Klapper|first=Joseph|title=Die schlesischen Geschichten von den schädingenden Toten|journal=Mitteilungen der Schlesischen Gesellschaft für Volkskunde|volume=11|pages=58–93|year=1909|language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al.

Piercing the skin of the chest was a way of "deflating" the bloated vampire. This is similar to a practice of "[[anti-vampire burial]]":  burying sharp objects, such as sickles, with the corpse, so that they may penetrate the skin if the body bloats sufficiently while transforming into a revenant.&lt;ref name="Barb158"&gt;Barber, p. 158.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Decapitation]] was the preferred method in German and western Slavic areas, with the head buried between the feet, behind the [[buttocks]] or away from the body.&lt;ref name="Barber73"/&gt; This act was seen as a way of hastening the departure of the soul, which in some cultures, was said to linger in the corpse. The vampire's head, body, or clothes could also be spiked and pinned to the earth to prevent rising.&lt;ref name="Barb157"&gt;Barber, p. 157.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Romani people]] drove steel or iron needles into a corpse's heart and placed bits of steel in the mouth, over the eyes, ears and between the fingers at the time of burial. They also placed hawthorn in the corpse's sock or drove a hawthorn stake through the legs. In a 16th-century burial near [[Venice]], a brick forced into the mouth of a female corpse has been interpreted as a vampire-slaying ritual by the archaeologists who discovered it in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;Reported by Ariel David, "Italy dig unearths female 'vampire' in Venice", 13 March 2009, [[Associated Press]] via [[Yahoo!

Further measures included pouring boiling water over the grave or complete incineration of the body. In the Balkans, a vampire could also be killed by being shot or drowned, by repeating the funeral service, by sprinkling [[holy water]] on the body, or by [[exorcism]]. In Romania, garlic could be placed in the mouth, and as recently as the 19th century, the precaution of shooting a bullet through the [[coffin]] was taken. For resistant cases, the body was [[dismemberment|dismembered]] and the pieces burned, mixed with water, and administered to family members as a cure. In [[Old Saxony|Saxon regions]] of Germany, a [[lemon]] was placed in the mouth of suspected vampires.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost every nation has associated blood drinking with some kind of revenant or demon, or in some cases a deity.

Many myths surrounding vampires originated during the [[Middle Ages|medieval period]]. The 12th-century English historians and chroniclers [[Walter Map]] and [[William of Newburgh]] recorded accounts of revenants,&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=William of Newburgh|author2=Paul Halsall|authorlink=William of Newburgh|title=Book 5, Chapter 22–24|website=Historia rerum Anglicarum|publisher=Fordham University|year=2000|accessdate=2007-10-16|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/williamofnewburgh-five.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; though records in English legends of vampiric beings after this date are scant.&lt;ref name="Jones121"&gt;Jones, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Scandinavian folklore|Old Norse]] ''[[draugr]]'' is another medieval example of an undead creature with similarities to vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | first=Ármann | last=Jakobsson |year=2009 | title=The Fearless Vampire Killers: A Note about the Icelandic ''Draugr'' and Demonic Contamination in ''Grettis Saga'' | journal=Folklore | issue=120 | page=309}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vampire-like beings were rarely written about in Jewish literature; the 16th-century rabbi [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra]] (Radbaz) wrote of an uncharitable old woman whose body was unguarded and unburied for three days after she died and rose as a vampiric entity, killing hundreds of people. He linked this event to the lack of a ''[[shemira|shmirah]]'' (guarding) after death as the corpse could be a vessel for evil spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Soul, Evil Spirits, and the Undead: Vampires, Death, and Burial in Jewish Folklore and Law|last=Epstein|first=Saul|last2=Robinson|first2=Sara Libby|journal=Preternature: Critical and Historical Studies on the Preternatural|year=2012|volume=1|issue=2|pages=232–51|doi=10.5325/preternature.1.2.0232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vampires proper originate in folklore widely reported from Eastern Europe in the late 17th and 18th centuries. These tales formed the basis of the vampire legend that later entered Germany and England, where they were subsequently embellished and popularized. One of the earliest recordings of vampire activity came from the region of [[Istria]] in modern [[Croatia]], in 1672.&lt;ref name="Istria"&gt;{{cite book|last=Klinger|first=Leslie|title=The New Annotated Dracula|year=2008|chapter=Dracula's Family Tree|page=570|publisher=W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.|location=New York|isbn=978-0-393-06450-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Local reports cited the local vampire [[Jure Grando]] of the village Khring near [[Tinjan]] as the cause of panic among the villagers.&lt;ref name="Grando"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pile|first=Steve|title=Real cities: modernity, space and the phantasmagorias of city life|year=2005|chapter=Dracula's Family Tree|page=570|publisher=Sage Publications Ltd|location=London|isbn=978-0-7619-7041-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; A former peasant, Jure died in 1656. Local villagers claimed he returned from the dead and began drinking blood from the people and sexually harassing his widow. The village leader ordered a stake to be driven through his heart, but when the method failed to kill him, he was subsequently beheaded with better results.&lt;ref name="Giure"&gt;{{cite book|last=Caron|first=Richard|title=Ésotérisme, gnoses &amp; imaginaire symbolique: mélanges offerts à Antoine Faivre|year=2001|chapter=Dracula's Family Tree|page=598|publisher=Peteers, Bondgenotenlaan 153|location=Belgium|isbn=978-90-429-0955-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 18th century, there was a frenzy of vampire sightings in Eastern Europe, with frequent stakings and grave diggings to identify and kill the potential revenants. Even government officials engaged in the hunting and staking of vampires.&lt;ref name="Barb5to9"/&gt; Despite being called the [[Age of Enlightenment]], during which most folkloric legends were quelled, the belief in vampires increased dramatically, resulting in a mass hysteria throughout most of Europe.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; The panic began with an outbreak of alleged vampire attacks in [[East Prussia]] in 1721 and in the [[Habsburg Monarchy]] from 1725 to 1734, which spread to other localities. Two famous vampire cases, the first to be officially recorded, involved the corpses of [[Petar Blagojevich]] and Miloš Čečar from Serbia. Blagojevich was reported to have died at the age of 62, but allegedly returned after his death asking his son for food. When the son refused, he was found dead the following day. Blagojevich supposedly returned and attacked some neighbours who died from loss of blood.&lt;ref name="Barb5to9"&gt;Barber, pp. 5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the second case, Miloš, an ex-soldier turned farmer who allegedly was attacked by a vampire years before, died while [[hay]]ing. After his death, people began to die in the surrounding area and it was widely believed that Miloš had returned to prey on the neighbours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283318599|title=Vampire Evolution|last=Jøn|first=A.

The character was later used in a story written by Serbian writer [[Milovan Glišić]] and in the Yugoslav 1973 horror film ''[[Leptirica]]'' inspired by the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Charnel House Blues: The Vampyre's Tale|first=Suzanne|last=Ruthven|url=https://books.google.com/?id=wDMNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13&amp;dq=Sava+Savanovi%C4%87#v=onepage&amp;q=Sava%20Savanovi%C4%87&amp;f=false|publisher=John Hunt Publishing|year=2014|isbn=978-1-78279-415-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The two incidents were well-documented. Government officials examined the bodies, wrote case reports, and published books throughout Europe.&lt;ref name="Barb1521"&gt;Barber, pp. 15–21.&lt;/ref&gt; The hysteria, commonly referred to as the "18th-Century Vampire Controversy", raged for a generation. The problem was exacerbated by rural epidemics of so-claimed vampire attacks, undoubtedly caused by the higher amount of superstition that was present in village communities, with locals digging up bodies and in some cases, staking them.&lt;ref name="Hoyt84"/&gt;

====Dissertations on vampirology====

In 1597, [[King James VI and I|King James]] wrote a dissertation on witchcraft titled ''[[Daemonologie]]'' in which he wrote the belief that demons could possess both the living and the dead. Within his [[classification of demons]], he explained the concept through the notion that [[incubus|incubi]] and [[succubus|succubae]] could possess the corpse of the deceased and walk the earth. As a devil borrows a dead body, it would seem so visibly and naturally to any man who converses with them and that any substance within the body would remain intolerably cold to others which they abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=King James|title=Daemonologie. A Critical Edition. In Modern English. 2016|page=80|isbn=978-1-5329-6891-4|date=2016-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1645 the Greek librarian of the Vatican, [[Leo Allatius]], produced the first methodological description of the Balkan beliefs in vampires (Greek: vrykolakas) in his work ''De Graecorum hodie quorundam opinationibus'' ("On certain modern opinions among the Greeks").&lt;ref&gt;Melton, J.

From 1679, Philippe Rohr devotes an essay to the dead who chew their shrouds in their graves, a subject resumed by Otto in 1732, and then by [[Michael Ranft]] in 1734. The subject was based on the observation that when digging up graves, it was discovered that some corpses had at some point either devoured the interior fabric of their coffin or their own limbs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Marigny|first1=Jean|title=Sang pour Sang, Le Réveil des Vampires, Gallimard, coll|date=1993|isbn=978-2-07-053203-2|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ranft described in his treatise of a tradition in some parts of Germany, that to prevent the dead from masticating they placed a mound of dirt under their chin in the coffin, placed a piece of money and a stone in the mouth, or tied a handkerchief tightly around the throat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al.

Some theological disputes arose. The non-decay of vampires' bodies could recall the incorruption of the bodies of the saints of the Catholic Church. A paragraph on vampires was included in the second edition (1749) of ''De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione'', On the [[beatification]] of the servants of God and on [[canonization]] of the blessed, written by Prospero Lambertini ([[Pope Benedict XIV]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lambertini, P.|year=1749|title=De servorum Dei beatificatione et sanctorum canonizatione|volume=Pars prima|chapter= XXXI|pages=323–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his opinion, while the [[incorruptibility|incorruption]] of the bodies of saints was the effect of a divine intervention, all the phenomena attributed to vampires were purely natural or the fruit of "imagination, terror and fear". In other words, vampires did not exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=de Ceglia F.P.|title=The Archbishop's Vampires.

[[File:Dom Augustin Calmet.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Engraving of [[Antoine Augustine Calmet|Dom Augustine Calmet]] from 1750]]
[[Antoine Augustine Calmet|Dom Augustine Calmet]], a French theologian and scholar, published a comprehensive treatise in 1751 titled ''[[Traité sur les apparitions des esprits et sur les vampires ou les revenans de Hongrie, de Moravie, &amp;c.|Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants]]'' which investigated the existence of vampires, demons, and spectres. Calmet conducted extensive research and amassed judicial reports of vampiric incidents and extensively researched theological and mythological accounts as well, using the scientific method in his analysis to come up with methods for determining the validity for cases of this nature. As he stated in his treatise:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Calmet|first1=Augustin|title=Treatise on the Apparitions of Spirits and on Vampires or Revenants: of Hungary, Moravia, et al. The Complete Volumes I &amp; II. Translated by Rev Henry Christmas &amp; Brett Warren. 2015|date=1751|isbn=978-1-5331-4568-0|pages=303–304}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hey see, it is said, men who have been dead for several months, come back to earth, talk, walk, infest villages, ill use both men and beasts, suck the blood of their near relations, make them ill, and finally cause their death; so that people can only save themselves from their dangerous visits and their hauntings by exhuming them, impaling them, cutting off their heads, tearing out the heart, or burning them. These revenants are called by the name of oupires or vampires, that is to say, [[leech]]es; and such particulars are related of them, so singular, so detailed, and invested with such probable circumstances and such judicial information, that one can hardly refuse to credit the belief which is held in those countries, that these revenants come out of their tombs and produce those effects which are proclaimed of them.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Calmet had numerous readers, including both a critical [[Voltaire]] and numerous supportive [[demonologist]]s who interpreted the treatise as claiming that vampires existed.&lt;ref name="Hoyt84"/&gt; In the ''[[Dictionnaire philosophique|Philosophical Dictionary]],'' Voltaire wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Philosophical Dictionary|author=Voltaire|year=1984|origyear=1764|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-044257-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|These vampires were corpses, who went out of their graves at night to suck the blood of the living, either at their throats or stomachs, after which they returned to their cemeteries. The persons so sucked waned, grew pale, and fell into [[tuberculosis|consumption]]; while the sucking corpses grew fat, got rosy, and enjoyed an excellent appetite. It was in Poland, Hungary, [[Silesia]], [[Moravia]], Austria, and [[Alsace-Lorraine|Lorraine]], that the dead made this good cheer.}}

The controversy in Austria only ceased when Empress [[Maria Theresa of Austria]] sent her personal physician, [[Gerard van Swieten]], to investigate the claims of vampiric entities. He concluded that vampires did not exist and the Empress passed laws prohibiting the opening of graves and desecration of bodies, sounding the end of the vampire epidemics. Other European countries followed suit. Despite this condemnation, the vampire lived on in artistic works and in local folklore.&lt;ref name="Hoyt84"&gt;Hoyt, pp. 101–06&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Non-European beliefs ===
Beings having many of the attributes of European vampires appear in the folklore of Africa, Asia, North and South America, and India. Classified as vampires, all share the thirst for blood.&lt;ref name=attwater&gt;{{cite journal|author=Atwater, Cheryl|year=2000|title=Living in Death: The Evolution of Modern Vampirism|journal=Anthropology of Consciousness|volume=11|issue=1–2|pages=70–77|doi=10.1525/ac.2000.11.1-2.70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Africa ====
Various regions of Africa have folktales featuring beings with vampiric abilities: in [[West Africa]] the [[Ashanti people|Ashanti]] people tell of the iron-toothed and tree-dwelling ''[[asanbosam]]'',&lt;ref name="Buns11"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Ewe people]] of the ''[[adze (folklore)|adze]],'' which can take the form of a [[firefly]] and hunts children.&lt;ref name="Buns2"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; The eastern [[Cape Peninsula|Cape]] region has the ''[[impundulu]],'' which can take the form of a large taloned bird and can summon thunder and lightning, and the [[Betsileo]] people of [[Madagascar]] tell of the ''ramanga'', an outlaw or living vampire who drinks the blood and eats the nail clippings of nobles.&lt;ref name="Bunson, p. 219"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Americas ====
The ''[[Loogaroo]]'' is an example of how a vampire belief can result from a combination of beliefs, here a mixture of French and African Vodu or [[West African Vodun|voodoo]]. The term ''Loogaroo'' possibly comes from the French ''[[loup-garou]]'' (meaning "werewolf") and is common in the [[culture of Mauritius]]. The stories of the ''Loogaroo'' are widespread through the [[Caribbean Islands]] and [[Louisiana]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Buns1623"&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', pp. 162–63.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar female monsters are the ''[[Soucouyant]]'' of [[Trinidad]], and the ''[[Tunda]]'' and ''[[Patasola]]'' of [[Colombian folklore]], while the [[Mapuche]] of southern [[Chile]] have the bloodsucking snake known as the ''[[Peuchen]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Martinez Vilches, Oscar|title=Chiloe Misterioso: Turismo, Mitologia Chilota, leyendas|year=1992|page=179|publisher=Ediciones de la Voz de Chiloe|location=Chile|oclc=33852127|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Aloe vera]]'' hung backwards behind or near a door was thought to ward off vampiric beings in South American folklore.&lt;ref name=Jaramillo/&gt; [[Aztec mythology]] described tales of the [[Cihuateteo]], skeletal-faced spirits of those who died in childbirth who stole children and entered into sexual liaisons with the living, driving them mad.&lt;ref name="Strange &amp; Amazing"/&gt;

During the late 18th and 19th centuries the belief in vampires was [[New England vampire panic|widespread in parts of New England]], particularly in [[Rhode Island]] and eastern [[Connecticut]]. There are many documented cases of families disinterring loved ones and removing their hearts in the belief that the deceased was a vampire who was responsible for sickness and death in the family, although the term "vampire" was never used to describe the dead. The deadly disease [[tuberculosis]], or "consumption" as it was known at the time, was believed to be caused by nightly visitations on the part of a dead family member who had died of consumption themselves.&lt;ref name=sledzik&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sledzik|first=Paul S.|author2=Nicholas Bellantoni|year=1994|title=Bioarcheological and biocultural evidence for the New England vampire folk belief|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|volume=94|issue=2|pages=269–274|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330940210  |pmid=8085617}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most famous, and most recently recorded, case of suspected vampirism is that of nineteen-year-old [[Mercy Brown vampire incident|Mercy Brown]], who died in [[Exeter, Rhode Island]] in 1892.

There are two main vampire-like creatures in the Philippines: the [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] ''[[Mandurugo]]'' ("blood-sucker") and the [[Visayan]] ''[[Manananggal]]'' ("self-segmenter"). The mandurugo is a variety of the [[aswang]] that takes the form of an attractive girl by day, and develops wings and a long, hollow, thread-like tongue by night. The tongue is used to suck up blood from a sleeping victim.&lt;ref name="ramos"/&gt; The ''manananggal'' is described as being an older, beautiful woman capable of severing its upper torso in order to fly into the night with huge bat-like wings and prey on unsuspecting, sleeping pregnant women in their homes. They use an elongated proboscis-like tongue to suck [[fetus]]es from these pregnant women. They also prefer to eat entrails (specifically the [[heart]] and the [[liver]]) and the phlegm of sick people.&lt;ref name="ramos"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramos|first=Maximo D.|title=Creatures of Philippine Lower Mythology|origyear=1971|year=1990|publisher=Phoenix Publishing|location=Quezon|isbn=978-971-06-0691-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malaysian ''[[Penanggalan]]'' is a woman who obtained her beauty through the active use of [[black magic]] or other unnatural means, and is most commonly described in local folklore to be dark or demonic in nature. She is able to detach her fanged head which flies around in the night looking for blood, typically from pregnant women.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt; Malaysians hung ''jeruju'' (thistles) around the doors and windows of houses, hoping the ''Penanggalan'' would not enter for fear of catching its intestines on the thorns.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, p. 34.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Leyak]] is a similar being from [[Balinese mythology|Balinese folklore]] of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Witchcraft, Grief, and the Ambivalence of Emotions|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=26|issue=3|year=1999|pages=711–737|doi=10.1525/ae.1999.26.3.711|first=Michele|last=Stephen}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Pontianak (folklore)|Kuntilanak]]'' or ''Matianak'' in Indonesia,&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Pontianak (folklore)|Pontianak]]'' or ''[[Langsuyar|Langsuir]]'' in Malaysia,&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, ''Vampire Encyclopedia'', p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; is a woman who [[Maternal mortality in fiction|died during childbirth]] and became undead, seeking revenge and terrorising villages. She appeared as an attractive woman with long black hair that covered a hole in the back of her neck, with which she sucked the blood of children. Filling the hole with her hair would drive her off. Corpses had their mouths filled with glass beads, eggs under each armpit, and needles in their palms to prevent them from becoming ''langsuir.''

[[Jiangshi]], sometimes called "Chinese vampires" by Westerners, are reanimated corpses that hop around, killing living creatures to absorb life essence ([[qi|qì]]) from their victims. They are said to be created when a person's soul (魄 [[Hun and po|''pò'']]) fails to leave the deceased's body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Suckling|first=Nigel|title=Vampires|year=2006|publisher=Facts, Figures &amp; Fun|location=London|isbn=978-1-904332-48-0|page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Jiang shi'' are usually represented as mindless creatures with no independent thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=劉|first=天賜|title=僵屍與吸血鬼|year=2008|publisher=Joint Publishing (H.K.)|location=Hong Kong|isbn=978-962-04-2735-0|page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; This monster has greenish-white furry skin, perhaps derived from fungus or [[mold|mould]] growing on corpses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=de Groot|first=J.J.M.|title=The Religious System of China|year=1910|work=E.J.

=== Modern beliefs ===
In modern fiction, the vampire tends to be depicted as a suave, charismatic [[villain]].&lt;ref name="Barb2"/&gt; Despite the general disbelief in vampiric entities, occasional sightings of vampires are reported. Vampire hunting societies still exist, but they are largely formed for social reasons.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt; Allegations of vampire attacks swept through [[Malawi]] during late 2002 and early 2003, with mobs stoning one person to death and attacking at least four others, including Governor [[Eric Chiwaya]], based on the belief that the government was colluding with vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Raphael|last=Tenthani|title='Vampires' strike Malawi villages|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/2602461.stm|date=23 December 2002|accessdate=2007-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 1970 local press spread rumours that a vampire haunted [[Highgate Cemetery]] in London. Amateur [[vampire hunter]]s flocked in large numbers to the cemetery. Several books have been written about the case, notably by Sean Manchester, a local man who was among the first to suggest the existence of the "[[Highgate Vampire]]" and who later claimed to have [[exorcism|exorcised]] and destroyed a whole nest of vampires in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Highgate Vampire: The Infernal World of the Undead Unearthed at London's Highgate Cemetery and Environs|last=Manchester|first=Sean|year=1991|location=London|publisher=Gothic Press|isbn=978-1-872486-01-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 2005, rumours circulated that an attacker had bitten a number of people in [[Birmingham]], England, fuelling concerns about a vampire roaming the streets. Local police stated that no such crime had been reported and that the case appears to be an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref name=guardian1&gt;{{cite news|title=Reality Bites|work=The Guardian|url=https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,1392607,00.html|date=18 January 2005|accessdate=2007-12-29|location=London|first=Stuart|last=Jeffries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:VampireE3.jpg|thumb|upright|A vampire costume]]
In 2006, a physics professor at the [[University of Central Florida]] wrote a paper arguing that it is mathematically impossible for vampires to exist, based on [[geometric progression]]. According to the paper, if the first vampire had appeared on 1 January 1600, and it fed once a month (which is less often than what is depicted in films and folklore), and every victim turned into a vampire, then within two and a half years the entire human population of the time would have become vampires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-science.net/othernews/061024_vampire.htm Math vs. vampires: vampires lose], world-science.net, 25 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In one of the more notable cases of vampiric entities in the modern age, the ''[[chupacabra]]'' ("goat-sucker") of [[Puerto Rico]] and [[Mexico]] is said to be a creature that feeds upon the flesh or drinks the blood of [[domesticated animal]]s, leading some to consider it a kind of vampire. The "chupacabra hysteria" was frequently associated with deep economic and political crises, particularly during the mid-1990s.&lt;ref name="trail"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephen Wagner|url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa051898.htm|title=On the trail of the Chupacabras|accessdate=2007-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, where much of the vampire folklore originates, the vampire is usually considered a fictitious being; many communities may have embraced the revenant for economic purposes. In some cases, especially in small localities, beliefs are still rampant and sightings or claims of vampire attacks occur frequently. In Romania during February 2004, several relatives of Toma Petre feared that he had become a vampire. They dug up his corpse, tore out his heart, burned it, and mixed the ashes with water in order to drink it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Taylor T|date=28 October 2007|title=The real vampire slayers|work=The Independent|url=http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article3096920.ece|accessdate=2007-12-14|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September / October 2017, mob violence in Malawi related to a vampire scare killed about 6 people accused of being vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vice.com/en_au/article/j5jxnx/mobs-in-malawi-have-killed-six-people-for-being-vampires|title=Mobs in Malawi have killed six people for being "vampires"|last=|first=|date=19 October 2017|work=VICE News|access-date=2018-01-02|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar spate of vigilante violence linked to vampire rumours occurred there in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2017/10/09/world/africa/09reuters-malawi-un-vampires.html|title=Vampire Scare Prompts U.N.

Vampirism and the [[vampire lifestyle]] also represent a relevant part of modern day's [[occult]]ist movements.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; The mythos of the vampire, his [[Magick (Aleister Crowley)|magickal]] qualities, allure, and predatory archetype express a strong symbolism that can be used in ritual, energy work, and magick, and can even be adopted as a spiritual system.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, L., &amp; Kathleen Mcphillips, K. (Eds.). (2006). Popular spiritualities: The politics of contemporary enchantment. Burlington, Ashgate Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; The vampire has been part of the occult society in Europe for centuries and has spread into the American sub-culture as well for more than a decade, being strongly influenced by and mixed with the [[Goth subculture|neo gothic]] aesthetics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Young, T. H.|year=1999|title=Dancing on Bela Lugosi's grave: The politics and aesthetics of Gothic club dancing|jstor=1290878|journal=Dance Research|volume=17|issue=1|pages=75–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Collective noun ====
"[[Coven]]" has been used as a collective noun for vampires, possibly based on the [[Wicca]]n usage. An alternative collective noun is a "house" of vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Vampires in Their Own Words: An Anthology of Vampire Voices|first=Michelle|last=Belanger|page=118|publisher=Llewellyn Worldwide|location=Woodbury MN|isbn=978-0-7387-1220-8|oclc=245535068|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins of vampire beliefs ==
Commentators have offered many theories for the origins of vampire beliefs and related [[mass hysteria]]. Everything ranging from [[premature burial]] to the early ignorance of the body's [[decomposition]] cycle after death has been cited as the cause for the belief in vampires.&lt;ref name="Barb1to4"&gt;Barber, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pathology ===
==== Decomposition ====
Paul Barber in his book ''Vampires, Burial and Death'' has described that belief in vampires resulted from people of [[pre-industrial society|pre-industrial societies]] attempting to explain the natural, but to them inexplicable, process of death and decomposition.&lt;ref name="Barb1to4"&gt;Barber, pp. 1–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

People sometimes suspected vampirism when a cadaver did not look as they thought a normal corpse should when disinterred. Rates of decomposition vary depending on temperature and soil composition, and many of the signs are little known. This has led vampire hunters to mistakenly conclude that a dead body had not decomposed at all or, ironically, to interpret signs of decomposition as signs of continued life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/staking_claims_the_vampires_of_folklore_and_fiction/|title=Staking Claims: The Vampires of Folklore and Fiction|last=Barber|first=Paul|date=March–April 1996|journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]]|doi=|pmid=|access-date=29 June 2015|volume=20|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Corpses swell as gases from decomposition accumulate in the torso and the increased pressure forces blood to ooze from the nose and mouth. This causes the body to look "plump", "well-fed", and "ruddy"—changes that are all the more striking if the person was pale or thin in life. In the [[Arnold Paole|Arnold Paole case]], an old woman's exhumed corpse was judged by her neighbours to look more plump and healthy than she had ever looked in life.&lt;ref name="Barb117"&gt;Barber, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; The exuding blood gave the impression that the corpse had recently been engaging in vampiric activity.&lt;ref name="Barb1145"/&gt;

Darkening of the skin is also caused by decomposition.&lt;ref name="Barb105"&gt;Barber, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt; The staking of a swollen, decomposing body could cause the body to bleed and force the accumulated gases to escape the body. This could produce a groan-like sound when the gases moved past the vocal cords, or a sound reminiscent of [[flatulence]] when they passed through the anus. The official reporting on the [[Petar Blagojevich]] case speaks of "other wild signs which I pass by out of high respect".&lt;ref name="Barb119"&gt;Barber, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

After death, the skin and gums lose fluids and contract, exposing the roots of the hair, nails, and teeth, even teeth that were concealed in the jaw. This can produce the illusion that the hair, nails, and teeth have grown. At a certain stage, the nails fall off and the skin peels away, as reported in the Blagojevich case—the [[dermis]] and [[nail (anatomy)#Parts of the nail|nail beds]] emerging underneath were interpreted as "new skin" and "new nails".&lt;ref name="Barb119"/&gt;

==== Premature burial ====
It has also been hypothesized that vampire legends were influenced by individuals being [[buried alive]] because of shortcomings in the medical knowledge of the time. In some cases in which people reported sounds emanating from a specific coffin, it was later dug up and fingernail marks were discovered on the inside from the victim trying to escape. In other cases the person would hit their heads, noses or faces and it would appear that they had been "feeding".&lt;ref name="Marigny2"&gt;Marigny, pp. 48–49.&lt;/ref&gt; A problem with this theory is the question of how people presumably buried alive managed to stay alive for any extended period without food, water or fresh air. An alternate explanation for noise is the bubbling of escaping gases from natural decomposition of bodies.&lt;ref name="Barber128"&gt;Barber, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt; Another likely cause of disordered tombs is [[grave robbery]].&lt;ref name="Barber13738"&gt;Barber, pp. 137–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Contagion ====
Folkloric vampirism has been associated with clusters of deaths from unidentifiable or mysterious illnesses, usually within the same family or the same small community.&lt;ref name=sledzik/&gt; The epidemic allusion is obvious in the classical cases of Petar Blagojevich and Arnold Paole, and even more so in the case of [[Mercy Brown vampire incident|Mercy Brown]] and in the vampire beliefs of New England generally, where a specific disease, tuberculosis, was associated with outbreaks of vampirism. As with the pneumonic form of [[bubonic plague]], it was associated with breakdown of lung tissue which would cause blood to appear at the lips.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Porphyria ====
In 1985 biochemist [[David Dolphin]] proposed a link between the rare blood disorder [[porphyria]] and vampire folklore. Noting that the condition is treated by intravenous [[heme|haem]], he suggested that the consumption of large amounts of blood may result in haem being transported somehow across the stomach wall and into the bloodstream. Thus vampires were merely sufferers of porphyria seeking to replace haem and alleviate their symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;Dolphin D (1985) "Werewolves and Vampires," annual meeting of American Association for the Advancement of Science.&lt;!--Can't the details to a paper reference be dug up properly? Or at least to a good secondary reference mentioning the link? Adams might be our only possibility...--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The theory has been rebuffed medically as suggestions that porphyria sufferers crave the haem in human blood, or that the consumption of blood might ease the symptoms of porphyria, are based on a misunderstanding of the disease. Furthermore, Dolphin was noted to have confused fictional (bloodsucking) vampires with those of folklore, many of whom were not noted to drink blood.&lt;ref&gt;Barber, p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a parallel is made between sensitivity to sunlight by sufferers, yet this was associated with fictional and not folkloric vampires. In any case, Dolphin did not go on to publish his work more widely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Adams|first=Cecil|title=Did vampires suffer from the disease porphyria—or not?|website=The Straight Dope|publisher=Chicago Reader|date=7 May 1999|accessdate=2007-12-25|url=http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a990507.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite being dismissed by experts, the link gained media attention&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Pierach|first=Claus A.|title=Vampire Label Unfair To Porphyria Sufferers|newspaper=The New York Times|date=13 June 1985|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C04E4D71239F930A25755C0A963948260|accessdate=25 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and entered popular modern folklore.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kujtan|first=Peter W.|title=Porphyria: The Vampire Disease|publisher=The Mississauga News online|date=29 October 2005 |url =http://www.bydewey.com/drkporphyria.html|accessdate=9 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Rabies ====
[[Rabies]] has been linked with vampire folklore. Dr Juan Gómez-Alonso, a neurologist at Xeral Hospital in [[Vigo]], Spain, examined this possibility in a report in ''[[Neurology (journal)|Neurology]]''. The susceptibility to garlic and light could be due to hypersensitivity, which is a symptom of rabies. The disease can also affect portions of the brain that could lead to disturbance of normal sleep patterns (thus becoming nocturnal) and [[hypersexuality]]. Legend once said a man was not rabid if he could look at his own reflection (an allusion to the legend that vampires have no reflection). [[Wolf|Wolves]] and [[bat]]s, which are often associated with vampires, can be carriers of rabies. The disease can also lead to a drive to bite others and to a bloody frothing at the mouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gómez-Alonso|first=Juan|year=1998|title=Rabies: a possible explanation for the vampire legend|journal=Neurology|volume=51|issue=3|pages=856–59|pmid=9748039|doi=10.1212/WNL.51.3.856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=24 September 1998|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/178623.stm|title=Rabies-The Vampire's Kiss|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=18 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychodynamic theories ===
In his 1931 treatise ''On the Nightmare'', [[Welsh people|Welsh]] [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalyst]] [[Ernest Jones]] asserted that vampires are symbolic of several unconscious drives and [[defence mechanism]]s. Emotions such as love, guilt, and hate fuel the idea of the return of the dead to the grave. Desiring a reunion with loved ones, mourners may [[psychological projection|project]] the idea that the recently dead must in return yearn the same. From this arises the belief that folkloric vampires and revenants visit relatives, particularly their spouses, first.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, pp. 100–02.&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where there was unconscious guilt associated with the relationship, the wish for reunion may be subverted by anxiety. This may lead to [[psychological repression|repression]], which [[Sigmund Freud]] had linked with the development of morbid dread.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=Ernest|year=1911|title=The Pathology of Morbid Anxiety|journal=Journal of Abnormal Psychology|volume=6|issue=2|pages=81–106|doi=10.1037/h0074306}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jones surmised in this case the original wish of a (sexual) reunion may be drastically changed: desire is replaced by fear; love is replaced by sadism, and the object or loved one is replaced by an unknown entity. The sexual aspect may or may not be present.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, p. 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern critics have proposed a simpler theory: People identify with immortal vampires because, by so doing, they overcome, or at least temporarily escape from, their [[death anxiety (psychology)|fear of dying]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KXOUiGfJ8_oC&amp;pg=PT205&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html McMahon, ''Twilight of an Idol'', p. 193].&lt;/ref&gt;

The innate sexuality of bloodsucking can be seen in its intrinsic connection with [[cannibalism]] and folkloric one with [[incubus (demon)|incubus]]-like behaviour. Many legends report various beings draining other fluids from victims, an unconscious association with [[semen]] being obvious. Finally Jones notes that when more normal aspects of sexuality are repressed, regressed forms may be expressed, in particular [[Sadistic personality disorder#Freud and psychoanalysis|sadism]]; he felt that [[Psychosexual development#Oral stage|oral sadism]] is integral in vampiric behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, "The Vampire", pp. 116–20.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political interpretations ===
[[File:The Irish Vampire - Punch (24 October 1885), 199 - BL.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Editorial cartoon|Political cartoon]] in ''[[Punch magazine|Punch]]'' magazine from 1885, depicting the [[Irish National League]] as the "Irish Vampire" preying on a sleeping woman]]

The reinvention of the vampire myth in the modern era is not without political overtones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Glover|first=David|year=1996|title=Vampires, Mummies, and Liberals: Bram Stoker and the Politics of Popular Fiction|publisher=Duke University Press|place=Durham, NC.|isbn=978-0-8223-1798-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The aristocratic Count Dracula, alone in his castle apart from a few demented retainers, appearing only at night to feed on his peasantry, is symbolic of the parasitic ''[[ancien regime]]''. In his entry for "Vampires" in the ''Dictionnaire philosophique'' (1764), Voltaire notices how the mid-18th century coincided with the decline of the folkloric belief in the existence of vampires but that now "there were stock-jobbers, brokers, and men of business, who sucked the blood of the people in broad daylight; but they were not dead, though corrupted. These true suckers lived not in cemeteries, but in very agreeable palaces".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1660&amp;chapter=202474&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27 VAMPIRES. – Voltaire, The Works of Voltaire, Vol. VII (Philosophical Dictionary Part 5) (1764)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Marx defined capital as "dead labour which, vampire-like, lives only by sucking living labour, and lives the more, the more labour it sucks".&lt;ref&gt;An extensive discussion of the diffenrent uses of the vampire metaphor in Marx's writings can be found in {{cite web |last=Policante |first=A. |url=http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/Policante.pdf |title=Vampires of Capital: Gothic Reflections between horror and hope |year=2010 |dead-url=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120128025458/http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/Policante.pdf |archive-date=28 January 2012 }} in [http://clogic.eserver.org/2010/2010.html Cultural Logic], 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Werner Herzog]], in his ''[[Nosferatu the Vampyre]]'', gives this political interpretation an extra ironic twist when protagonist [[Jonathon Harker]], a middle-class solicitor, becomes the next vampire; in this way the capitalist [[bourgeois]] becomes the next parasitic class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brass|first=Tom|journal=Dialectical Anthropology|volume=25|pages=205–237|year=2000|title=Nymphs, Shepherds, and Vampires: The Agrarian Myth on Film|doi=10.1023/A:1011615201664|issue=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Psychopathology ===
A number of murderers have performed seemingly vampiric rituals upon their victims. [[Serial killer]]s [[Peter Kürten]] and [[Richard Trenton Chase]] were both called "vampires" in the [[tabloid journalism|tabloids]] after they were discovered drinking the blood of the people they murdered. Similarly, in 1932, an unsolved murder case in [[Stockholm]], Sweden was nicknamed the "[[Atlas Vampire|Vampire murder]]", because of the circumstances of the victim's death.&lt;ref name=Stig1&gt;{{cite book|last=Linnell|first=Stig|title=Stockholms spökhus och andra ruskiga ställen|origyear=1968|year=1993|publisher=Raben Prisma|isbn=978-91-518-2738-4|language=sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The late-16th-century Hungarian countess and mass murderer [[Elizabeth Báthory]] became particularly infamous in later centuries' works, which depicted her bathing in her victims' blood in order to retain beauty or youth.&lt;ref name="Hoyt6871"&gt;Hoyt, pp. 68–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Modern vampire subcultures ===
''Vampire lifestyle'' is a term for a contemporary subculture of people, largely within the [[Goth subculture]], who consume the blood of others as a pastime; drawing from the rich recent history of popular culture related to cult symbolism, [[horror film]]s, the fiction of [[Anne Rice]], and the styles of Victorian England.&lt;ref&gt;Skal(1993) pp. 342–43.&lt;/ref&gt; Active vampirism within the vampire subculture includes both blood-related vampirism, commonly referred to as ''sanguine vampirism'', and ''[[psychic vampire|psychic vampirism]]'', or supposed feeding from [[prana|pranic]] energy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jøn|first=A.

=== Vampire bats ===
{{main|Vampire bat}}
[[File:Desmodus.jpg|thumb|A [[vampire bat]] in Peru]]
Although many cultures have stories about them, [[vampire bat]]s have only recently become an integral part of the traditional vampire lore. Vampire bats were integrated into vampire folklore after they were discovered on the South American mainland in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"&gt;Cohen, pp. 95–96.&lt;/ref&gt; There are no vampire bats in Europe, but [[bat]]s and [[owl]]s have long been associated with the supernatural and omens, mainly because of their nocturnal habits,&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Cooper92"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=J.C.|title=Symbolic and Mythological Animals|pages=25–26|year=1992|publisher=Aquarian Press|location=London|isbn=978-1-85538-118-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in modern English [[heraldry|heraldic]] tradition, a bat means "Awareness of the powers of darkness and chaos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Heraldic "Meanings"|publisher=American College of Heraldry|accessdate=2006-04-30|url=http://www.americancollegeofheraldry.org/achsymbols.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The three species of vampire bats are all [[endemic (ecology)|endemic]] to Latin America, and there is no evidence to suggest that they had any [[Old World]] relatives within human memory. It is therefore impossible that the folkloric vampire represents a distorted presentation or memory of the vampire bat. The bats were named after the folkloric vampire rather than vice versa; the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' records their folkloric use in English from 1734 and the zoological not until 1774. The vampire bat's bite is usually not harmful to a person, but the bat has been known to actively feed on humans and large prey such as cattle and often leaves the trademark, two-prong bite mark on its victim's skin.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt;

The literary [[Count Dracula|Dracula]] transforms into a bat several times in the novel, and vampire bats themselves are mentioned twice in it. The 1927 stage production of ''Dracula'' followed the novel in having Dracula turn into a bat, as did the [[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|film]], where [[Béla Lugosi]] would transform into a bat.&lt;ref name="Cohen2"/&gt; The bat transformation scene was used again by [[Lon Chaney, Jr.|Lon Chaney Jr.]] in 1943's ''[[Son of Dracula (1943 film)|Son of Dracula]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Skal (1996) pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

== In modern fiction ==
&lt;!--**This section is a general overview, do not add cultural references here, add them to the subarticles... Thanks.*****--&gt;
The vampire is now a fixture in popular fiction. Such fiction began with 18th-century poetry and continued with 19th-century short stories, the first and most influential of which was [[John Polidori]]'s ''The Vampyre'' (1819), featuring the vampire [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280805194|title=From Nosteratu to Von Carstein: shifts in the portrayal of vampires|last=Jøn|first=A.

The vampire theme continued in [[penny dreadful]] serial publications such as ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' (1847) and culminated in the pre-eminent vampire novel in history: ''[[Dracula]]'' by Bram Stoker, published in 1897.&lt;ref name="Christopher"&gt;Christopher Frayling (1992) ''Vampyres&amp;nbsp;– Lord Byron to Count Dracula''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, some attributes now regarded as integral became incorporated into the vampire's profile: fangs and vulnerability to sunlight appeared over the course of the 19th century, with Varney the Vampire and Count Dracula both bearing protruding teeth,&lt;ref name="Skal99"&gt;Skal(1996) p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Murnau|Murnau's]] ''[[Nosferatu]]'' (1922) fearing daylight.&lt;ref name="Skal104"&gt;Skal(1996) p. 104.&lt;/ref&gt; The cloak appeared in stage productions of the 1920s, with a high collar introduced by playwright [[Hamilton Deane]] to help Dracula 'vanish' on stage.&lt;ref name="Skal62"&gt;Skal(1996) p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; Lord Ruthven and Varney were able to be healed by moonlight, although no account of this is known in traditional folklore.&lt;ref name="SU389"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, pp. 38–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Implied though not often explicitly documented in folklore, [[immortality]] is one attribute which features heavily in vampire film and literature. Much is made of the price of eternal life, namely the incessant need for blood of former equals.&lt;ref&gt;Bunson, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Literature ===
{{main|Vampire literature}}
[[File:Varney the Vampire or the Feast of Blood.jpg|thumb|upright|Cover from one of the original serialized editions of ''[[Varney the Vampire]]'', an influential publication in the development of the modern vampire genre&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt;]]
The vampire or revenant first appeared in poems such as ''The Vampire'' (1748) by Heinrich August Ossenfelder, ''[[Lenore (ballad)|Lenore]]'' (1773) by [[Gottfried August Bürger]], ''Die Braut von Corinth'' (''The Bride of Corinth'') (1797) by [[Johann Wolfgang von Goethe]], [[Robert Southey]]'s ''Thalaba the Destroyer'' (1801), [[John Stagg (poet)|John Stagg]]'s "The Vampyre" (1810), [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]'s [[Posthumous Fragments of Margaret Nicholson|"The Spectral Horseman"]] (1810) ("Nor a yelling vampire reeking with gore") and "Ballad" in ''[[St. Irvyne]]'' (1811) about a reanimated corpse, Sister Rosa, [[Samuel Taylor Coleridge]]'s unfinished ''[[Christabel (poem)|Christabel]]'' and [[Lord Byron]]'s ''[[The Giaour]]''.&lt;ref name="Marigny poems"&gt;Marigny, pp. 114–15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Byron was also credited with the first prose fiction piece concerned with vampires: ''The Vampyre'' (1819). This was in reality authored by Byron's personal physician, [[John Polidori]], who adapted an enigmatic fragmentary tale of his illustrious patient, "Fragment of a Novel" (1819), also known as "The Burial: A Fragment".&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;Cohen, pp. 271–74.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher"/&gt; Byron's own dominating personality, mediated by his lover [[Lady Caroline Lamb]] in her unflattering ''roman-a-clef'' ''Glenarvon'' (a Gothic fantasia based on Byron's wild life), was used as a model for Polidori's undead protagonist [[Lord Ruthven (vampire)|Lord Ruthven]]. ''The Vampyre'' was highly successful and the most influential vampire work of the early 19th century.&lt;ref name="SU378"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, pp. 37–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Carmilla.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Carmilla]]'' by [[D. H. Friston]], 1872]]
''[[Varney the Vampire]]'' was a landmark popular mid-[[Victorian era]] [[gothic horror]] story by [[James Malcolm Rymer]] and [[Thomas Peckett Prest]], which first appeared from 1845 to 1847 in a series of pamphlets generally referred to as ''[[penny dreadful]]s'' because of their inexpensive price and typically gruesome contents.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; The story was published in book form in 1847 and runs to 868 double-columned pages. It has a distinctly suspenseful style, using vivid imagery to describe the horrifying exploits of Varney.&lt;ref name="SU389"/&gt; Another important addition to the genre was [[Sheridan Le Fanu]]'s [[lesbian vampire]] story ''[[Carmilla]]'' (1871). Like Varney before her, the vampire Carmilla is portrayed in a somewhat sympathetic light as the compulsion of her condition is highlighted.&lt;ref name="SU401"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, pp. 40–41.&lt;/ref&gt;

No effort to depict vampires in popular fiction was as influential or as definitive as [[Bram Stoker]]'s ''Dracula'' (1897).&lt;ref name="SU43"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 43.&lt;/ref&gt; Its portrayal of vampirism as a disease of contagious demonic possession, with its undertones of sex, blood and death, struck a chord in [[Victorian era|Victorian]] Europe where [[tuberculosis]] and [[syphilis]] were common. The vampiric traits described in Stoker's work merged with and dominated folkloric tradition, eventually evolving into the modern fictional vampire.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

Drawing on past works such as ''The Vampyre'' and ''Carmilla'', Stoker began to research his new book in the late 19th century, reading works such as ''The Land Beyond the Forest'' (1888) by [[Emily Gerard]] and other books about Transylvania and vampires. In London, a colleague mentioned to him the story of [[Vlad III the Impaler|Vlad Ţepeş]], the "real-life Dracula", and Stoker immediately incorporated this story into his book. The first chapter of the book was omitted when it was published in 1897, but it was released in 1914 as ''Dracula's Guest''.&lt;ref name="Marigny Drac"&gt;Marigny, pp. 82–85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The latter part of the 20th century saw the rise of multi-volume vampire epics. The first of these was Gothic romance writer [[Marilyn Ross]]'s ''[[Barnabas Collins]]'' series (1966–71), loosely based on the contemporary American TV series ''[[Dark Shadows]]''. It also set the trend for seeing vampires as poetic [[tragic hero]]es rather than as the more traditional embodiment of evil. This formula was followed in novelist Anne Rice's highly popular and influential ''[[Vampire Chronicles]]'' (1976–2003).&lt;ref name="SU205"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 205.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 21st century brought more examples of vampire fiction, such as [[J.&amp;nbsp;R. Ward]]'s [[Black Dagger Brotherhood]] series, and other highly popular vampire books which appeal to teenagers and young adults. Such vampiric [[paranormal romance]] novels and allied vampiric [[chick-lit]] and vampiric [[occult detective]] stories are a remarkably popular and ever-expanding contemporary publishing phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usatoday.com/life/books/news/2006-06-28-vampire-romance_x.htm Vampire Romance].&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leslie Esdaile Banks|L.&amp;nbsp;A. Banks]]' ''[[The Vampire Huntress Legend Series]]'', [[Laurell K. Hamilton]]'s erotic ''[[Anita Blake: Vampire Hunter]]'' series, and [[Kim Harrison]]'s ''[[Hollows (series)|The Hollows]]'' series, portray the vampire in a variety of new perspectives, some of them unrelated to the original legends. Vampires in the [[Twilight (novel series)|''Twilight'' series]] (2005–2008) by [[Stephenie Meyer]] ignore the effects of garlic and crosses and are not harmed by sunlight, although it does reveal their supernatural status.&lt;ref name="slate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/id/2205143/|title=I Vant To Upend Your Expectations: Why film vampires always break all the vampire rules|last=Beam|first=Christopher|date=20 November 2008|website=Slate Magazine|accessdate=2009-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richelle Mead]] further deviates from traditional vampires in her [[Vampire Academy (series)|''Vampire Academy'' series]] (2007–present), basing the novels on Romanian lore with two races of vampires, one good and one evil, as well as half-vampires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnwlocalnews.com/east_king/kir/lifestyle/79852562.html|title=Vampire buzz takes bite in Kirkland|publisher=Pnwlocalnews.com|date=21 December 2009|accessdate=2010-12-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Film and television ===
{{main|Vampire films}}
[[File:NosferatuShadow.jpg|thumb|A scene from [[F. W. Murnau]]'s ''[[Nosferatu]]'', 1922]]
Considered one of the preeminent figures of the classic horror film, the vampire has proven to be a rich subject for the film and gaming industries. [[Dracula in popular culture|Dracula is a major character]] in more films than any other but [[Sherlock Holmes]], and many early films were either based on the novel ''Dracula'' or closely derived from it. These included the 1922 German silent film ''[[Nosferatu]]'', directed by [[F. W. Murnau]] and featuring the first film portrayal of Dracula—although names and characters were intended to mimic ''Dracula''{{'}}s, Murnau could not obtain permission to do so from Stoker's widow, and had to alter many aspects of the film. Universal's ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'' (1931), starring Béla Lugosi as the Count, was the first [[sound film|talking film]] to portray Dracula. The decade saw several more vampire films, most notably ''[[Dracula's Daughter]]'' in 1936.&lt;ref name="Marigny film1"&gt;Marigny, pp. 90–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bela lugosi dracula.jpg|thumb|left|[[Count Dracula]] as portrayed by [[Béla Lugosi]] in 1931's ''[[Dracula (1931 English-language film)|Dracula]]'']]
The legend of the vampire continued through the film industry when Dracula was reincarnated in the pertinent [[Hammer Horror]] series of films, starring [[Christopher Lee]] as the Count. The successful 1958 ''[[Dracula (1958 film)|Dracula]]'' starring Lee was followed by seven sequels. Lee returned as Dracula in all but two of these and became well known in the role.&lt;ref name="Marigny film2"&gt;Marigny, pp. 92–95.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1970s, vampires in films had diversified with works such as ''[[Count Yorga, Vampire]]'' (1970), an African Count in 1972's ''[[Blacula]]'', the BBC's ''[[Count Dracula (1977)|Count Dracula]]'' featuring French actor [[Louis Jourdan]] as Dracula and [[Frank Finlay]] as [[Abraham Van Helsing]], and a Nosferatu-like vampire in 1979's ''[[Salem's Lot (1979 TV mini-series)|Salem's Lot]]'', and a remake of ''Nosferatu'' itself, titled [[Nosferatu the Vampyre]] with [[Klaus Kinski]] the same year. Several films featured the characterisation of a female, often lesbian, vampire such as Hammer Horror's ''[[The Vampire Lovers]]'' (1970), based on ''Carmilla'', though the plotlines still revolved around a central evil vampire character.&lt;ref name="Marigny film2"/&gt;

[[File:Jonathan Frid Barnabas Collins Dark Shadows 1968.JPG|thumb|right|upright|1960s television's ''Dark Shadows'', with [[Jonathan Frid]]'s [[Barnabas Collins]] vampire character]]
The [[Gothic fiction|Gothic]] [[soap opera]] ''[[Dark Shadows]]'', on American television from 1966 to 1971 and produced by [[Dan Curtis]], featured the vampire character [[Barnabas Collins]], portrayed by Canadian actor [[Jonathan Frid]], which proved partly responsible for making the series one of the most popular of its type, amassing a total of 1,225 episodes in its nearly five-year run. The pilot for the later Dan Curtis 1972 television series ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'' revolved around reporter Carl Kolchak hunting a vampire on the [[Las Vegas Strip]]. Later films showed more diversity in plotline, with some focusing on the vampire-hunter, such as [[Blade (comics)|Blade]] in the [[Marvel Comics]]' [[Blade (film series)|''Blade'']] films and the film ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; ''Buffy'', released in 1992, foreshadowed a vampiric presence on television, with adaptation to a long-running hit [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|series of the same name]] and its spin-off ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. Still others showed the vampire as protagonist, such as 1983's ''[[The Hunger (1983 film)|The Hunger]]'', 1994's ''[[Interview with the Vampire (film)|Interview with the Vampire]]'' and its indirect sequel of sorts ''[[Queen of the Damned (film)|Queen of the Damned]]'', and the 2007 series ''[[Moonlight (TV series)|Moonlight]]''. The 1992 film ''[[Bram Stoker's Dracula]]'' became the then-highest grossing vampire film ever.&lt;ref name="SU208"&gt;Silver &amp; Ursini, p. 208.&lt;/ref&gt;

This increase of interest in vampiric plotlines led to the vampire being depicted in films such as ''[[Underworld (2003 film)|Underworld]]'' and ''[[Van Helsing (film)|Van Helsing]]'', and the Russian ''[[Night Watch (2004 film)|Night Watch]]'' and a TV miniseries remake of ''[[Salem's Lot (2004 TV miniseries)|Salem's Lot]]'', both from 2004. The series ''[[Blood Ties (TV series)|Blood Ties]]'' premiered on [[Lifetime Television]] in 2007, featuring a character portrayed as Henry Fitzroy, illegitimate son of [[Henry VIII of England]] turned vampire, in modern-day [[Toronto]], with a female former Toronto detective in the starring role. A 2008 series from HBO, entitled ''[[True Blood]]'', gives a [[Southern Gothic]] take to the vampire theme.&lt;ref name="slate"/&gt;

In 2008 the [[BBC Three (former)|BBC Three]] series ''[[Being Human (UK TV series)|Being Human]]'' became popular in Britain. It featured an unconventional trio of a vampire, a werewolf and a ghost who are sharing a flat in [[Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;Germania, Monica (2012): Being Human?  Twenty-First-Century Monsters.

The continuing popularity of the vampire theme has been ascribed to a combination of two factors: the representation of [[human sexual behavior|sexuality]] and the perennial dread of mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bartlett|first=Wayne|author2=Flavia Idriceanu|title=Legends of Blood: The Vampire in History and Myth|year=2005|publisher=NPI Media Group|location=London|isbn=978-0-7509-3736-8|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Games ===
The [[role-playing game]] ''[[Vampire: The Masquerade]]'' has been influential upon modern vampire fiction and elements of its terminology, such as ''embrace'' and ''sire'', appear in contemporary fiction.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Popular [[List of vampire video games|video games about vampires]] include ''[[Castlevania]]'', which is an extension of the original Bram Stoker novel ''Dracula'', and ''[[Legacy of Kain]]''.&lt;ref name=joshi&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=stJxdpZVl_wC&amp;pg=PA646|title=Icons of horror and the supernatural|volume=2|author=Joshi, S.

'''Vegetative reproduction''' (also known as '''vegetative propagation''', '''vegetative multiplication''' or '''vegetative cloning''') is any form of [[asexual reproduction]] occurring in plants in which a new plant grows from a fragment of the parent plant or grows from a specialized reproductive structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/vegetative-reproduction|title=vegetative reproduction {{!}} horticulture|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Plant propagation]] is the process of plant reproduction of a species or cultivar, and it can be sexual or asexual. It can happen through the use of vegetative parts of the plants, such as [[Leaf|leaves]], [[Plant stem|stem]]s, and [[root]]s to produce new plants or through growth from specialized vegetative plant parts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swingle|first=Charles F.|date=1940-07-01|title=Regeneration and vegetative propagation|journal=The Botanical Review|volume=6|issue=7|pages=301–355|doi=10.1007/BF02919037|issn=0006-8101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous plants naturally reproduce this way, but it can also be, and frequently is, induced [[Artificial reproduction|artificially]]. Over the years, horticulturalists have developed asexual propagation techniques that use vegetative plant parts, to replicate plants in a way that does not often occur naturally.

Success rates and difficulty of propagation vary greatly. For example, [[willow]] and [[coleus]] can be propagated merely by inserting a stem in water or moist soil. On the other hand, [[monocotyledon]]s, unlike [[dicotyledon]]s, typically lack a [[vascular cambium]] and therefore are harder to propagate.

== Background ==
While numerous plants reproduce by vegetative reproduction, they rarely exclusively use that method to reproduce. Although it has numerous advantages, vegetative reproduction is not evolutionary advantageous: it does not allow for genetic diversity and could lead plants to accumulate deleterious mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scarcelli|first=N.|last2=Tostain|first2=S.|last3=Vigouroux|first3=Y.|last4=Agbangla|first4=C.|last5=Daïnou|first5=O.|last6=Pham|first6=J.-L.|date=August 2006|title=Farmers' use of wild relative and sexual reproduction in a vegetatively propagated crop.

Plants will resort to vegetative propagation when it allows individuals to produce more [[offspring]] per unit of resource than reproduction through seed production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Birget|first=Philip L.

M.|date=1982|publisher=Springer, Dordrecht|isbn=9789048182725|series=Forestry Sciences|pages=387–412|doi=10.1007/978-94-017-3538-4_13|chapter = Vegetative Propagation in Relation to Juvenility, Maturity, and Rejuvenation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most plants normally reproduce sexually, many have the ability to reproduce vegetatively, or can be vegetatively propagated if small pieces are subjected to chemical (hormonal) treatments. This is because [[meristem|meristematic cells]] capable of [[cellular differentiation]] are present in many plant tissues.

Vegetative propagation is usually considered a [[cloning]] method.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McKey|first=Doyle|last2=Elias|first2=Marianne|last3=Pujol|first3=Benoît|last4=Duputié|first4=Anne|date=2010-04-01|title=The evolutionary ecology of clonally propagated domesticated plants|url=https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03210.x#pane-pcw-references|journal=New Phytologist|volume=186|issue=2|doi=10.1111/j.1469-8137.2010.03210.x#pane-pcw-references|issn=1469-8137|doi-broken-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are several cases where vegetatively propagated plants are genetically identical. Root cuttings of thornless blackberries will revert to thorny type because the [[adventitious shoot]] develops from a cell that is genetically thorny. Thornless blackberry is a chimera, with the epidermal layers genetically thornless but the tissue beneath it genetically thorny.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}} Similarly, leaf cutting propagation of certain chimeral variegated plants, such as snake plant (Sansevieria trifasciata), will produce mainly nonvariegated plants.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}
Grafting is often not a complete cloning method because seedlings are used as rootstocks. In that case, only the top of the plant is clonal. In some crops, particularly apples, the rootstocks are vegetatively propagated so the entire graft can be clonal if the scion and rootstock are both clones.
[[Apomixis]] (including apospory and diplospory) is a type of reproduction that does not involve fertilization. In flowering plants, unfertilized seeds are involved, or [[plantlet]]s that grow instead of flowers. Hawkweed (''[[Hieracium]]''), dandelion (''[[Taraxacum]]''), some citrus (''[[Citrus]]'') and many grasses such as Kentucky bluegrass (''[[Poa pratensis]]'') all use this form of asexual reproduction. Bulbils are sometimes formed instead of the flowers of garlic.

== Mechanisms ==
Meristem tissue makes the process of asexual reproduction possible. It is normally found in stems, leaves, and tips of stems and roots and consists of [[undifferentiated cell]]s that are constantly dividing allowing for plant growth and give rise to plant tissue systems. The meristem tissue's ability to continuously divide allows for vegetative propagation to occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=upz7yYFUP3IC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=meristem+in+vegetative+propagation#v=onepage&amp;q=meristem%20in%20vegetative%20propagation&amp;f=false|title=Vegetative Propagation from the Standpoint of Plant Anatomy|last=Priestley|first=Joseph Hubert|last2=Swingle|first2=Charles F.|date=1929|publisher=U.S. Department of Agriculture}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important ability  that  allows for vegetative propagation is the ability to develop [[adventitious root]]s which arise from other vegetative parts of the plants such as the stem or leaves. These roots allow for the development of new plants from body parts from other plants .&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/science/root-plant#ref41885|title=root {{!}} Definition, Types, Morphology, &amp; Functions|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2018-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages and disadvantages ==

=== Advantages ===
There are several advantages of vegetative reproduction, mainly that the produced offspring are practically [[Clones (plant)|clones]] of their parent plants. If a plant has favorable traits, it can continue to pass down its advantageous [[genetic information]] to its offspring. This is especially economically advantageous as it allows commercial growers to clone a certain plant to ensure consistency throughout their crops.&lt;ref name="Hussey 1978 185–208"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hussey|first=G.|date=1978|title=The application of tissue culture to the vegetative propagation of plants|jstor=43420451|journal=Science Progress (1933- )|volume=65|issue=258|pages=185–208}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vegetative propagation also allows plants to avoid the costly process of producing [[sexual reproduction organs]] such as [[flower]]s and the subsequent [[seed]]s and [[fruit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snow|first=Allison A.|last2=Whigham|first2=Dennis F.|date=1989-10-01|title=Costs of Flower and Fruit Production in Tipularia Discolor (Orchidaceae)|journal=Ecology|volume=70|issue=5|pages=1286–1293|doi=10.2307/1938188|issn=1939-9170|jstor=1938188}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, developing an ace [[cultivar]] is extremely difficult, so, once farmers develop the desired traits in apple, they use [[grafting]] and [[budding]] to ensure the consistency of the new cultivar and its successful production on a commercial level. However, as can be seen in many [[Variegation|variegated]] plants, this does not always apply, because many plants actually are [[Chimera (genetics)|chimeras]] and cuttings might reflect the attributes of only one or some of the parent cell lines. Vegetative propagation also allows plants to circumvent the immature [[Seedling|seedling phase]] and reach the [[Plant maturity|mature]] phase faster.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Zotz|first=Gerhard|date=1999|title=Vegetative propagation in an epiphytic orchid occurrence and ecological relevance|url=https://www.soctropecol.eu/publications/pdf/5-1/Zotz1999,%20Ecotropica%205_65-68.pdf|journal=Ecotropica|volume=5|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In nature, that increases the chances for a plant to successfully reach maturity, and, commercially, it saves farmers a lot of time and money as it allows for faster crop overturn.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Libby|first=W.|date=September 1973|title=THE USE OF VEGETATIVE PROPAGULES IN FOREST GENETICS AND TREE IMPROVEMENT|url=http://www.scionresearch.com/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/30938/NZJFS421974LIBBY440_447.pdf|journal=School of Forestry and Conservation and Department of Genetics|volume=4|pages=440–447|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vegetative reproduction offers research advantages in several areas of biology and has practical usage when it comes to [[afforestation]]. The most common use made of vegetative propagation by forest geneticists and tree breeders has been to move [[gene]]s from selected trees to some convenient location, usually designated a [[gene bank]], [[clone bank]], clone-holding orchard, or seed orchard where their genes can be [[Meiosis|recombined]] in [[pedigreed]] offspring.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Disadvantages ===
A major disadvantage of vegetative propagation is that it prevents species [[genetic diversity]] which can lead to reductions in [[crop yield]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Disparate-effects-of-plant-genotypic-diversity-on-Crutsinger-Reynolds/45f3b3276feba160a419cf5bc4dc707d972e29cc|title=Disparate effects of plant genotypic diversity on foliage and litter arthropod communities - Semantic Scholar|access-date=2018-04-19|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frankham|first=R|date=2005-07-27|title=Conservation Biology: Ecosystem recovery enhanced by genotypic diversity|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/6800706|journal=Heredity|volume=95|issue=3|pages=183|doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6800706|pmid=16049423}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plants are genetically identical and are all, therefore, susceptible to pathogenic [[plant virus]]es, [[bacteria]] and [[Fungus|fungi]] that can wipe out entire crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reusch|first=Thorsten|last2=Boström|first2=Christoffer|date=2011-07-01|title=Widespread genetic mosaicism in the marine angiosperm Zostera marina is correlated with clonal reproduction|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/225404053|journal=Evolutionary Ecology|volume=25|issue=4|pages=899–913|doi=10.1007/s10682-010-9436-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types of vegetative reproduction  ==

=== Natural means of vegetative propagation ===
Natural vegetative propagation is mostly a [[Biological process|process]] found in [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] and [[Woody plant|woody]] [[perennial plant|perennial]] plants, and typically involves structural modifications of the [[Plant stem|stem]], although any horizontal, underground part of a plant (whether stem, leaf, or [[root]]) can contribute to vegetative reproduction of a plant. Most plant species that survive and significantly expand by vegetative reproduction would be [[Perennial plant|perennial]] almost by definition, since specialized organs of vegetative reproduction, like seeds of annuals, serve to survive [[season]]ally harsh conditions. A plant that persists in a location through vegetative reproduction of individuals over a long period of time constitutes a [[clonal colony]].

In a sense, this process is not one of reproduction but one of survival and expansion of biomass of the individual. When an individual [[organism]] increases in size via cell multiplication and remains intact, the process is called "vegetative growth". However, in vegetative reproduction, the new plants that result are new individuals in almost every respect except genetic. Of considerable interest is how this process appears to reset the [[Plant senescence|aging clock]].&lt;ref&gt;(General J. Grant (1864). "Vegetative Reproduction in New York: a comprehensive study. Stony Brook University Press: NY, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;

As aforementioned, plants vegetetatively propagate both artificially and naturally. Most common methods of natural vegetative reproduction involves the development of a new plant from specialized structures of a mature plant. In addition to [[Root|adventitious roots]], roots that arise from plant structures other than the root, such as stems or leaves, [[Aerial stem modification|modified stems]], leaves and roots play an important role in plants' ability to naturally propagate. The most common modified stems, leaves and roots that allow for vegetative propagation are:&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=itB5yKv7-rIC&amp;pg=PR13&amp;dq=%22vegetative+propagation+in+agriculture%22#v=snippet&amp;q=vegetative%20propagation%20in%20agriculture&amp;f=false|title=Plants in Agriculture|last=Forbes|first=James C.|last2=Forbes|first2=Jim C.|last3=Watson|first3=Drennan|date=1992-08-20|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521427913}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== [[Rhizome]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harada|first=Yuko|last2=Iwasa|first2=Yoh|date=1994-12-01|title=Lattice population dynamics for plants with dispersing seeds and Vegetative propagation|journal=Researches on Population Ecology|volume=36|issue=2|pages=237–249|doi=10.1007/BF02514940|issn=0034-5466}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Rhizomes are stem-like structures that grow horizontally across the ground and from which new roots and shoots may arise. They serve as [[protein]] and [[starch]] storage units serving as a [[nutrient]] source for newly developed plants.

Examples of plants that use rhizomes are [[ginger]], [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[Iris (plant)|irises]].

==== [[Stolon|Runners]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Cambridge_Illustrated_Glossary_of_Bo.html?id=0Yja1lL_pJYC|title=The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms|last=Hickey|first=Michael|last2=King|first2=Clive|date=2000-11-16|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521794015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Also known as [[stolon]]s, runners are modified stems that, unlike rhizomes, grow from existing stems just below the soil surface. As they are propagated, the [[bud]]s on the modified stems produce roots and stems. Those buds are more separated than the ones found on the rhizome.

Examples of plants that use runners are [[Strawberry|strawberries]] and [[Ribes|currants]].

==== [[Bulb]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kawasaki|first=Maria Lucia|date=1991-07-01|title=Plant form. An illustrated guide to flowering plant morphology. By Adrian D. Bell|journal=Brittonia|volume=43|issue=3|pages=145|doi=10.2307/2807042|issn=0007-196X|jstor=2807042}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
As the name suggests, bulbs are inflated parts of the stem within which lie the central shoots of new plants. They are typically underground and are surrounded by plump and layered leaves that provide [[nutrient]]s to the new plant.

Examples of plants that use bulbs are [[shallot]]s, [[Lilium|lilies]] and [[tulip]]s.

==== [[Tuber]]s&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
These structures develop from either the stem or the root. Stem tubers grow from rhizomes or runners that swell from storing nutrients while root tubers propagate from roots that are modified to store nutrients and get too large and produce a new plant.

Examples of stem tubers are [[potato]]es and [[Yam (vegetable)|yam]]s and examples of root tubers are [[sweet potato]]es and [[dahlia]]s.

==== [[Corm]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/version/31263173|title=Tuberous, cormous and bulbous plants : biology of an adaptive strategy in Western Australia|last=Pate|first=J.

Corms are solid enlarged underground stems that store nutrients in their fleshy and solid stem tissue and are surrounded by papery leaves. Corms differ from bulbs in that their centers consists of solid tissue while bulbs consist of layered leaves.

Examples of plants that use corms are [[gladiolus]] and [[Colocasia esculenta|taro]].

==== [[Basal shoot|Suckers]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1980-01-01|title=Forest development in North America following major disturbances|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378112780900134|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=3|pages=153–168|doi=10.1016/0378-1127(80)90013-4|issn=0378-1127|last1=Oliver|first1=Chadwick Dearing}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Also known as [[Basal shoot|root sprouts]], suckers are plant stems that arise from buds on the base of parent plants stems or on roots.

Examples of plants that use suckers are [[apple]] and [[Banana|banana trees]].

==== [[Plantlet]]s&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1975-12-01|title=Vegetative propagation of Chrysanthemum morifolium Ram. in vitro|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304423875900461|journal=Scientia Horticulturae|volume=3|issue=4|pages=317–330|doi=10.1016/0304-4238(75)90046-1|issn=0304-4238|last1=Roest|first1=S.|last2=Bokelmann|first2=G.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Miniature structures that arise from meristem in leaf margins that eventually develops roots and drop from the leaves they grew on.

An example of a plant that uses plantlets is the ''[[Bryophyllum daigremontianum]]'' (syn. ''Kalanchoe daigremontianum''), which is also known as ''mother of thousands'' for its many plantlets.

==== [[Keiki]]s&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; ====
Additional offshoots which develop on vegetative stems or [[Pedicel (botany)|flower stalks]] of several orchids [[Genus|genera]].

Examples of plants that use keikis are the ''[[Phalaenopsis]]'', ''[[Epidendrum]]'', and ''[[Dendrobium]]'' genera of [[Orchidaceae|orchids]].

Vegetative propagation of particular [[cultivar]]s that have desirable characteristics is very common practice. It is used by farmers and [[Horticulture|horticulturalists]] to produce better crops with desirable qualities. The most common methods of [[Plant propagation|artificial vegetative propagation]] are:&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== [[Cutting (plant)|Cutting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1996-08-01|title=Vegetative propagation of Milicia excelsa by leafy stem cuttings: effects of auxin concentration, leaf area and rooting medium|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0378112796037371|journal=Forest Ecology and Management|volume=84|issue=1–3|pages=39–48|doi=10.1016/0378-1127(96)03737-1|issn=0378-1127|last1=Ofori|first1=D.A.|last2=Newton|first2=A.C.|last3=Leakey|first3=R.R.B.|last4=Grace|first4=J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
A part of the plant, usually a stem or a leaf, is cut off and planted. Adventitious roots grow from cuttings and a new plant eventually develops. Usually those cuttings are treated with [[hormone]]s before being planted to induce growth.
Example :rose;hibiscus.

==== [[Grafting]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://extension.oregonstate.edu/deschutes/sites/default/files/propagation.pdf|title=Kumar, G. (2011).

A [[Scion (grafting)|scion]], or a desired cutting, is attached to the stem of another plant that remains rooted in the ground. Eventually both tissue systems become grafted or integrated and a plant with the characteristics of the grafted plant develops.e.g mango, gauva, etc

==== [[Layering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.purdue.edu/hla/sites/yardandgarden/|title=Indiana Yard and Garden – Purdue Consumer Horticulture - Purdue University|website=Indiana Yard and Garden - Purdue Consumer Horticulture|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This process includes the bending of plant branches or stems so that they touch the ground and are covered with soil. Adventitious roots develops from the underground part of the plant, which is known as the layer. This method of vegetative reproduction also occurs naturally. Another similar method, [[Layering|air layering]], involved the scraping and replanting of tree branches which develop into trees.

==== [[Basal shoot|Suckering]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Maini|first=J. S.|last2=Horton|first2=K. W.|date=1966-09-01|title=Vegetative Propagation of Populus Spp.: I.

Suckers grow and form a dense compact mat that is attached to the parent plant. Too many suckers can lead to smaller crop size, so excess suckers are [[Pruning|pruned]], and mature suckers are transplanted to a new area where they develop into new plants.

Plant cells are taken from various parts of the plant and are [[Cell culture|cultured]] and nurtured in a sterilized container. The mass of developed tissue, known as the [[callus]], is then cultured in a hormone-ladened medium and eventually develops into plantlets which are then planted and eventually develop into grown plants.

'''William Monroe Trotter''' (sometimes just '''Monroe Trotter''', April 7, 1872 – April 7, 1934) was a newspaper editor and real estate businessman based in [[Boston]], Massachusetts, and an [[activist]] for [[African-American]] [[civil rights]].  He was an early opponent of the accommodationist race policies of [[Booker T. Washington]], and in 1901 founded the  ''[[Boston Guardian]],'' an independent African-American newspaper he used to express that opposition.  Active in protest movements for civil rights throughout the 1900s and 1910s, he also revealed some of the differences within the African-American community. He contributed to the formation of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP).

Trotter was born into a well-to-do family and raised in [[Hyde Park, Massachusetts]]. He earned his graduate and post-graduate degrees at [[Harvard University]], and was the first man of color to earn a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] key there. Seeing an increase in segregation in northern facilities, he began to engage in a life of activism, to which he devoted his assets. He joined with [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] in founding the [[Niagara Movement]] in 1905, a forerunner of the NAACP.  Trotter's style was often divisive, and he ended up leaving that organization and founding the [[National Equal Rights League]]. His protest activities were sometimes seen to be at cross purposes to those of the NAACP.

In 1914 he had a highly publicized meeting with [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], in which he protested Wilson's introduction of segregation into the federal workplace. In Boston, Trotter succeeded in 1910 in shutting down productions of ''[[The Clansman]]'' but he was unsuccessful in 1915 with screenings of the movie ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', which also portrayed the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in favorable terms. He was not able to influence the peace talks at the end of [[World War I]], and was in later years a marginalized voice of protest. In an alliance with [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], in 1921 he did get a revival screening banned of ''The Birth of a Nation''. He died on his 62nd birthday after a possibly [[suicide|suicidal]] fall from his Boston home.

==Early life and education==
William was the third child, and first to survive infancy, of [[James Monroe Trotter]] and Virginia (Isaacs) Trotter.&lt;ref name=Fox9&gt;Fox, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His father James was born into slavery in [[Mississippi]]; James' mother Letitia was enslaved, and his father was her white master Richard S. Trotter.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; Letitia, her son and two daughters were freed by their master after his marriage and sent to [[Cincinnati, Ohio]], which had a thriving free black community.  After working as a teacher, James Trotter enlisted in the [[United States Colored Troops]] during the [[American Civil War]],&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; and was the first man of color to be promoted to lieutenant in the [[55th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment|55th Regiment of the Massachusetts Volunteer Infantry (Colored)]].&lt;ref name=Fox5&gt;Fox, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Virginia Isaacs, also of mixed race, was born free in 1842 in either [[Ohio]] or [[Virginia]]. Her mother Ann-Elizabeth Fossett was born into slavery at [[Monticello]], where she was a daughter of Joseph Fossett and Edith Hern Fossett, and great granddaughter of [[Elizabeth Hemings]]. Virginia's father Tucker Isaacs was a [[free person of color]].&lt;ref name="trotter"/&gt; He purchased the freedom of Ann-Elizabeth Fossett, Virginia's mother.&lt;ref name="trotter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monticello.org/getting-word/people/virginia-isaacs-trotter|title=Virginia Isaacs Trotter|publisher=Monticello|accessdate=2012-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family moved to [[Chillicothe, Ohio|Chillicothe]] in the free state of Ohio, where Virginia grew up in its thriving black community. There she met and married James Trotter.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the Civil War, the Trotters moved from Ohio to settle in [[Boston]], Massachusetts. After their first two children died in infancy, they returned to the Isaacs farm of Virginia's parents, where their son William Monroe Trotter was born on April 7, 1872.  When he was seven months old, the family moved back to Boston, where they settled in the [[South End, Boston|South End]], far from the predominantly African-American west side of [[Beacon Hill, Boston|Beacon Hill]]. The family later moved to suburban [[Hyde Park, Massachusetts|Hyde Park]], a white neighborhood. The Trotters had two more children, both daughters.&lt;ref name=Fox9/&gt;

Trotter's father broke through many racial obstacles placed before him, but was often frustrated in his attempts to gain equal treatment or fair consideration.  While serving in the Union Army, he protested the inequality of pay between blacks and whites.&lt;ref name=Fox5/&gt;  In Boston he was the first man of color to be employed by the [[United States Post Office Department|Post Office Department]] (now the [[United States Postal Service|U.S. Postal Service]]), a job he left after he was repeatedly passed over for promotion because of discriminatory [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]]-led federal government policy.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  Politically active, the elder Trotter was a leading African-American [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] in New England. He supported [[Grover Cleveland]] for [[President of the United States|President]], and was rewarded in 1886 when Cleveland appointed him [[Recorder of Deeds]] for the [[District of Columbia]], the highest federal position filled by black men at the time.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=H239/&gt; Two other prominent men of color of that era, [[Fredrick Douglass]] and [[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Blanche Bruce|Blanche Kelso Bruce]], also held the post.&lt;ref&gt;Finkelman, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt;  The job was a lucrative one, and the Trotter family prospered.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

The young Trotter (who was usually called by his middle name "Monroe") grew up in this environment, and was introduced to [[Archibald Grimké]], another politically active African American who also lived in Hyde Park.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;  He excelled in school, graduating from the otherwise all-white [[Hyde Park High School (Massachusetts)|Hyde Park High School]] as [[valedictorian]] and president of his high school class.&lt;ref name=H239&gt;Harrison, p. 239&lt;/ref&gt;  He went on to [[Harvard University]], where he continued to distinguish himself academically.  He was awarded merit scholarships after his father died, and was the first man of color to be awarded a [[Phi Beta Kappa]] key at Harvard.  He earned a bachelor's degree ''[[magna cum laude]]'' in 1895 and a Masters in 1896, working a variety of odd jobs to help pay his tuition.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 15–19&lt;/ref&gt;

During his years at Harvard, he adopted a number of habits which he maintained for much of his life. He organized and led the Total Abstinence League, a [[temperance movement|temperance]] organization; he was a teetotaler and never drank alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; He was active in the [[Baptists|Baptist church]], in which he had considered becoming a minister.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Following his graduation, Trotter participated in the upper echelons of Negro society in Boston, a number of whose members had ancestors free before the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;  He belonged to an exclusive literary society that met at [[Maria Baldwin House|the home]] of Cambridge educator [[Maria Baldwin]].  On June 27, 1899, Trotter married [[Geraldine Pindell Trotter|Geraldine Louise ("Deenie") Pindell]] (October 3, 1872 – October 8, 1918), who was from another activist family.  He had known her since childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt; She assisted him throughout his career until her death in the [[1918 flu pandemic]].&lt;ref name=H240&gt;Harrison, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;  The couple had no children.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 212&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early career==
Trotter's career began inauspiciously.  His initial attempts to get jobs at established banking and real estate firms were unsuccessful, leading him through a succession of lower-paying clerking jobs.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;  He finally landed a job in a white-owned real estate firm in 1898, but decided the next year to open his own business selling insurance and brokering [[mortgage]]s.  He was not particularly active in agitating for civil rights in these years, although his strong opinions on racial equality were evident in an 1899 paper in which he called on African Americans to seek admission to institutions of higher learning. (It was a common practice of the time to direct African Americans away from higher education opportunities and into industrial training programs.) Trotter's business was relatively successful, and he was able to purchase investment properties.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotter was increasingly troubled by what he saw as the accommodationist policies of [[Booker T. Washington]], one of the leading African-American figures of the 1890s and founder of the [[Tuskegee Institute]].  Washington's policies were enshrined in the [[Atlanta Compromise]], outlined in an 1895 speech he gave in [[Atlanta, Georgia]]. He said that Southern African Americans should not agitate for political rights (such as [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|the right to vote]] and [[Equal Protection Clause|equal treatment]] under the law) as long as they were provided economic opportunities and basic rights of [[due process]].&lt;ref&gt;Brown and Stentiford, pp. 55–56&lt;/ref&gt;  Washington actively promoted the idea that African Americans, once they had proven themselves as productive members of society, would be granted full political rights.  Trotter, Grimké, [[W. E. B. Du Bois]], and other northern radicals disagreed with these ideas, arguing that it was necessary for African Americans to agitate for equal treatment and full constitutional rights, because doing so would bring other benefits.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 36–43&lt;/ref&gt; By the turn of the century, African Americans in the South had been effectively disfranchised by violence around elections, and restrictions in voting registration rules, and, finally, constitutional amendments or new constitutions in southern states.

Although Boston was comparatively congenial when compared to other parts of the country, Trotter and others felt that Washington's stance was leading to an increase in more typically Southern racist attitudes in the city.  "The conviction grew upon me", he wrote, that his business successes could be endangered "if race prejudice and persecution and public discrimination from mere color was to spread up from the South and result in a fixed caste of color".&lt;ref name=H240/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==The ''Guardian''==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=My vocation has been to wage a crusade against lynching, disenfranchisement, peonage, public segregation, injustice, denial of service in public places for color, in war time and peace.|source=&amp;mdash;William Monroe Trotter&lt;ref name=H241&gt;Harrison, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Trotter's racial activism blossomed in 1901. He helped found the Boston Literary and Historical Association, which became, according to biographer Stephen Fox, "a forum for militant race opinion".&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;  He also joined the Massachusetts Racial Protective Association, another local group that promoted political goals of equality. Under the aegis of the latter group, Trotter in October 1901 gave his first major protest speech, attacking Washington's accommodationist stance: "In Boston [Washington] said that the Negro should wait for the franchise until he had got property, education and character. Washington's attitude has ever been one of servility."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[George W. Forbes]], another Protective Association member, in 1901 Trotter co-founded the ''[[Boston Guardian|Guardian]]'', a weekly newspaper.  At first Forbes, an [[Amherst College]] graduate with some experience in publishing, was the driving operational force in its production, while Trotter funded the effort and served as its managing editor.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 29–30&lt;/ref&gt;  The paper became a forum for a more outspoken and forceful approach to gaining racial equality, and its contributors and editorials (which were generally written by Trotter) regularly attacked Washington.  The paper's editorial stance brought a stream of criticism from more mainstream African-American publications: the ''[[New York Age]]'', calling it "putrescent", wrote that "Editor Trotter&amp;nbsp;... makes himself smelt if not felt"; another wrote that the ''Guardian'' was "carrying its cases too fast and too far", and that Trotter suffered from a "mental malady".&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' had limited circulation, but was highly influential as one of only 200 African-American publications in the country.  It suffered financially due to Trotter's poor accounting and inattention due to his heavy schedule. Forbes, who principally worked as a librarian in the city library, left the business in 1904 because of Booker T. Washington's legal assaults on the newspaper and pressure by Washington supporters on his employers.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 30, 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;  Trotter's wife, and later his sister, assisted in the paper's publication.&lt;ref&gt;Horne and Young, pp. 31–32&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote=The ''Guardian'' was bitter, satirical, and personal; but it was earnest, and it published facts.  It attracted wide attention among colored people; it circulated among them all over the country; it was quoted and discussed. I did not wholly agree with the ''Guardian'', and indeed only a few Negroes did, but nearly all read it and were influenced by it.
|source=&amp;mdash;W. E. B. Du Bois&lt;ref&gt;Du Bois, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Trotter, in a deliberate move, transferred the ''Guardian''{{'s}} offices in 1907 to the same building that had once housed [[William Lloyd Garrison]]'s ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|Liberator]]''.&lt;ref name=H240/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fox98/&gt; Trotter idolized Garrison, a leading [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] agitator before the Civil War, and had studied his methods.&lt;ref name=Fox98&gt;Fox, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt;  He was a regular correspondent with Garrison's sons William Jr. and Francis Garrison.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Guardian'' was always unprofitable, a condition that was exacerbated by Trotter's refusal to take advertising for alcohol and tobacco. He sold off all of his Boston-area properties by 1910 to raise funds for the newspaper, and he was lax in collecting payments from his subscribers.  In his later years, the quality of the publication noticeably declined, and its operations were propped up by a local community group's fund-raising activities.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 206–208&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Puttkammer and Worthy, p. 311&lt;/ref&gt;

==Attacking the African-American establishment==
[[Image:Booker T. Washington Lecture, 1906.JPG|thumb|left|[[Booker T. Washington]] giving a speech at [[Carnegie Hall]] in [[New York City]], 1909]]
In the early 1900s Trotter noticed that racial segregation was spreading in Boston: the number of hotels, restaurants, and other public establishments refusing service to African Americans was increasing.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 34–35&lt;/ref&gt;  He came to realize that, in order to effect real change, the radical message needed to be taken out of Boston, and began organizing protest meetings across New England in 1903. At the suggestion of Trotter, [[William H. Ferris]] went to Washington D.C. in January 1903. Ferris gave a presentation critical to Booker T. Washington in front of the [[Bethel Literary and Historical Society]] on January 6, 1903. [[Richard W. Thompson (journalist)|Richard W. Thompson]] spoke in support of Washington as replies at the Second Baptist Lyceum on January 25&lt;ref&gt;The Race's Leader! the Friends of Booker T. Washington after Conspirators, Freeman (Indianapolis, Indiana), Saturday, February 14, 1903, Volume: XVI Issue: 7 Page: 1 Piece: One of Two&lt;/ref&gt; and Jesse Lawson did the same on February 3.&lt;ref&gt;Booker T. Washington, Louis R. Harlan, The Booker T. Washington Papers: 1903-04 University of Illinois Press, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Jacqueline M. Moore argued that Thompson's paper failed to hold his ground against Ferris, who was present at the talk.&lt;ref&gt;Jacqueline M. Moore, Leading the Race: The Transformation of the Black Elite in the Nation's Capital, 1880-1920 University of Virginia Press, 1999, p68&lt;/ref&gt;

His long-term objective was to effect policy changes in the [[National Afro-American Council]], then the only national-level organization of African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; At the group's annual meeting in [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Trotter and others introduced resolutions calling for more activism, but [[Booker T. Washington]] supporters (also known as "Bookerites"), who controlled the council, saw to their defeat. One commentator wrote that the "Boston idiots" had been treated "in delightful fashion".&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guardian'' described the convention as "dominated to death by one man".&lt;ref name=Fox49&gt;Fox, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The activities of the radicals at the convention did bring them some national press.&lt;ref name=Fox49/&gt; Trotter continued to criticize Washington in the ''Guardian''; his attacks were particularly harsh and personal, and brought a bitter tinge to the disagreement.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 39–40&lt;/ref&gt;

In this period, while the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]] of African Americans out of the South to the North was beginning, blacks in the two regions dealt with different conditions. The vast majority of the millions of African Americans still lived in the South, many in rural areas where they were the majority population. But they were effectively disfranchised by new electoral rules and state constitutions, utterly closed out of the political process. This situation would continue, despite some temporarily effective court challenges, through the 1960s. Washington believed he had to help this population within the constraints of their environment. At the same time, he secretly funded legal challenges against the voter registration and electoral restrictions.&lt;ref name="pildes"&gt;[http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=224731 Richard H. Pildes, Democracy, Anti-Democracy, and the Canon, ''Constitutional Commentary'', vol.17, 2000, pp.13-14] Accessed 10 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Trotter and other radicals tended to come from the North, where African Americans exercised more rights in daily life, including the suffrage, were more urbanized, and had achieved more in work and education, but were still subject to discrimination.

Following their failure to advance the radical agenda in Louisville, Trotter and the other radicals sought a more sympathetic forum in which to attack Booker T. Washington. An opportunity arrived when Washington was set to speak in Boston in July 1903.&lt;ref name=Fox49/&gt; When the Tuskegee Institute leader was introduced to a visibly hostile crowd, a small riot broke out. Trotter, who had arrived prepared with several provocative questions to ask Washington, attempted to read them over the din of the melee. He was among the arrested, and the "Boston riot" received national press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 50–53&lt;/ref&gt;  Trotter later claimed that there was no plan to break up the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Bookerites pressed charges against Trotter for disrupting the meeting; defended by [[Archibald Grimké]], Trotter was convicted and spent thirty days in the [[Charles Street Jail]]. Although the Bookerites had hoped to discredit the radicals with the trial, they gained them wider publicity.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 55–58&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trotter, Granville Martin, and Bernard Charles were tried, Charles was acquitted, while Trotter and Martin were found guilty and served thirty-day jail terms. ''Two Sent To Jail For Disturbing Booker Washington's Meeting''. Broad Ax (Chicago, Illinois), Saturday, October 24, 1903, Page: 1&lt;/ref&gt; After the trial, Trotter founded the Boston Suffrage League (1903), and when a New England Suffrage League was founded in 1904, Trotter was elected president.&lt;ref&gt;Smith, n.p.&lt;/ref&gt;

Washington countered Trotter's attacks with a variety of tactics. He took various legal actions against Trotter, including at least one libel suit and criminal charges. In addition, he used his network to apply pressure to Trotter's supporters in their workplaces (in some cases government and academic positions). In addition, he had other sympathizers secretly infiltrate and report on activist meetings organized by Trotter and others.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 60–71&lt;/ref&gt; Washington also provided financial support and expertise to start other publications in Boston to counter Trotter's radical voice.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of such activities, Trotter's printer dropped the activist and his newspaper as a client. But Trotter found another printer and continued publishing the ''Guardian'' despite the setback.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Niagara Movement and the NAACP==
In the early months of 1905, Booker T. Washington sought to create an umbrella organization to represent all the major African-American leaders of the day.  Du Bois and Grimké were the two most radical leaders invited to its early organizational meetings, but both eventually refused to ally with Washington, whom they saw as dominating the group.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 82–86&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois, Trotter, and two others organized a meeting of radicals from across the nation in western New York.  Meeting in July just across the Canada–US border in [[Fort Erie, Ontario]] they founded the [[Niagara Movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;  Organized so that no one man could dominate it, the group espoused a radical declaration of principles (authored by Trotter and Du Bois), calling for agitation for equal economic opportunity and exercise of full civil rights for African Americans.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;  The organization was soon divided internally by political and personal disagreements, and Washington worked from outside against its growth.&lt;ref name=Wintz8&gt;Wintz, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:WEB Du Bois.jpg|thumb|left|upright|W. E. B. Du Bois, 1904 photo]]
During the early months of 1906, friction began to develop between Du Bois and Trotter over the admission of women to the organization. Du Bois supported the idea, and Trotter opposed it, but eventually relented. The matter was smoothed over during the 1906 meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt;  Their division became more significant when Trotter split with [[Clement Morgan]], a longtime supporter and Movement member, over Massachusetts politics and control of the local Movement chapter. Du Bois sided with Morgan and,&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 104–106&lt;/ref&gt; when the Movement met in Boston in 1907, he reappointed Morgan to a leading position in the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; Attempts to heal the rift failed, and Trotter resigned from the Movement.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 109–110&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these difficulties, the organization had effectively collapsed by 1908. The break between Trotter and Du Bois was permanent, and they never worked directly together again.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 100–114&lt;/ref&gt; Du Bois wrote in 1909 that it was "utterly impossible to work with Mr. Trotter."&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the Niagara Movement's failure, its goals had appealed to white supporters of racial equality. They participated in the founding of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] (NAACP), which drew an inter-racial coalition of support.&lt;ref name=Wintz8/&gt;  Trotter and Du Bois were both present at meetings in 1909 in which its foundation was laid.  Although some of Trotter's proposals were accepted (to address segregated transportation as a grievance), others were not (such as his proposal for a bill to make [[lynching]] a federal crime). Trotter was not invited to be on the organization's executive committee; neither was [[Booker T. Washington]], who boycotted the effort.&lt;ref name=Wintz8/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 128–130&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotter never played a significant role in the NAACP, and in its early years actively competed with it. In 1911 Trotter's group and the NAACP both held rallies in Boston to mark the centennial of abolitionist [[Charles Sumner]]'s birth.&lt;ref&gt;Schneider, pp. 116–117&lt;/ref&gt; Trotter was peripherally involved with the NAACP for a few years, but he did not approve of the amount of white involvement in the interracial group. His feud with Du Bois ran deep, so he rarely contributed to the organization at the national level.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; He was also troubled by the attitudes expressed in the Boston chapter, which he told NAACP leader [[Joel Elias Spingarn|Joel Spingarn]] needed more "radical, courageous activity." He eventually drifted away from the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 136–140&lt;/ref&gt;

==National Equal Rights League==
After Trotter split from the Niagara Movement, he helped organize a conference of like-minded activists held in [[Philadelphia]] in April 1908, and served as the conference chair. In this capacity, he excluded any attendees whose racial ideology he opposed, as well as those who supported Republican [[William Howard Taft]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1908|upcoming presidential election]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 110–111&lt;/ref&gt;  (Trotter opposed Taft because he had tired of what he considered the Republican Party ''[[laissez-faire]]'' policies on race.)&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; This conference led to the formation of the Negro-American Political League, which eventually became known as the [[National Equal Rights League]] (NERL).&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 111, 140&lt;/ref&gt; Trotter described this group as "of the colored people and for the colored people and led by the colored people."&lt;ref name="Fox 140"&gt;Fox, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1912How They're Acting.jpg|thumb|right|Political cartoon about the 1912 presidential election, depicting [[Theodore Roosevelt]] (cowboy hat), [[Woodrow Wilson]] (cap), and [[William Howard Taft]] (top hat)]]
NERL, which biographer Fox describes as Trotter's "personal fief", was unable to attract high-profile membership as the NAACP did.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 140–141&lt;/ref&gt; Trotter did not want white members, and was unable to work effectively with other African-American leaders.&lt;ref name="Fox 140"/&gt; NERL and the NAACP, while both working toward similar goals, regularly feuded over matters public and personal.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt;

As the NAACP attracted more money and talent, and became the center of anti-Bookerite civil rights activity, Trotter and the NERL became increasingly marginalized on the left.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 144–145&lt;/ref&gt; Trotter would not have as prominent a role in the civil rights dialogue again.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; By 1921 the League had been reduced to a handful of Trotter supporters.&lt;ref&gt;Puttkammer and Worthy, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trotter and Woodrow Wilson==
Trotter's opposition to Booker T. Washington placed him at odds with [[Theodore Roosevelt]] and William Howard Taft, Republican presidents who relied on Washington as an adviser and otherwise enjoyed widespread African-American support. Trotter supported the southern Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] in the [[United States presidential election, 1912|1912 election]].  Wilson, in a brief meeting with Trotter and other NERL members, made vague statements about fair treatment of African Americans. But, he succumbed to pressure from Southerners in his cabinet and agreed to segregate federal offices. The NAACP and NERL (then known as the National Independent Political League, or NIPL) protested, and Trotter secured a meeting with Wilson at the [[White House]] in November 1913.&lt;ref name=OR_119/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt;  Wilson said that his policies were not segregationist, but Trotter characterized Wilson's denial as "preposterous".&lt;ref name=OR_119&gt;O'Reilly, p. 119&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotter continued his protests, eventually gaining a second invitation to the White House in November 1914. This meeting with Wilson ended with a heated exchange between the two men.  Wilson claimed to be dealing with a "human problem" from which politics should be left out, and suggested to Trotter's group that they could always vote for someone else in the next election. Trotter continued to argue that the segregationist policy was humiliating to African Americans. Wilson responded, "If you take it as a humiliation, which it is not intended as, and sow the seed of that impression all over the country, why the consequences will be very serious."&lt;ref name=OR_119/&gt; After Trotter said this was an insult, Wilson angrily ordered him to leave, saying "If this organization wishes to approach me again, it must choose another spokesman&amp;nbsp;... your tone, sir, offends me."&lt;ref name=OR_119/&gt;

Trotter's second meeting with the President was widely covered in the press, featured on the front page of the ''[[New York Times]]'' and other leading newspapers.  A white Texas newspaper described Trotter as "merely a [[nigger]]" and "not a Booker T. Washington type of colored man",&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; and northern papers also criticized him for his "insolence" to the president.&lt;ref name=Fox183&gt;Fox, p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;  The ''[[Boston Evening Transcript]]'', while observing that Wilson's policy was segregationist and divisive, pointed out that although Trotter was basically correct, he "offends many of his own color by his&amp;nbsp;... untactful belligerency".&lt;ref name=Fox183/&gt;  African Americans were divided in their response to the incident: some claimed that he did not represent them, while others, notably Du Bois, grudgingly admired Trotter's audacity. Du Bois wrote that Wilson was "insulting &amp; condescending" in the meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 184–185&lt;/ref&gt; Trotter parlayed the publicity into a series of speaking engagements, in which he denied "that in language, manner, tone, in any respect or to the slightest degree I was impudent, insolent, or insulting to the President."&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 186&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BostonMA WilliamMonroeTrotterHouse.jpg|thumb|right|upright|The [[William Monroe Trotter House]] in Dorchester]]
Trotter continued to protest segregationist policies of the Wilson administration. When the country began large-scale recruiting for the military in [[World War I]], Trotter opposed the establishment of segregated officer training facilities.  Through his influence, recruitment of blacks in the Boston area was lower than expected. During [[World War II]], the military integrated the officer corps, and President [[Harry Truman]] afterward completed integration of the armed services.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, p. 243&lt;/ref&gt;

When the [[Great War]] ended, Trotter sought to use the [[Paris Peace Conference, 1919|1919 Paris Peace Conference]] as a vehicle to raise international awareness of US government policy toward African Americans. He viewed the reality of segregation as incompatible with Wilson's war vision to "make the world safe for Democracy."&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp. 243–244&lt;/ref&gt;  Trotter organized a meeting in [[Washington, DC]] related to the peace conference; he and ten other African-American delegates were chosen to attend the peace conference. The [[State Department]] refused to issue passports to those delegates, or to African Americans planning to attend a [[Pan-African Congress]] that Du Bois was organizing to be held concurrently with the peace conference in Paris. Du Bois and other African Americans were supporting African colonies' desire for independence.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt;

To get to Europe, Trotter posed as a seaman seeking work in New York, and got a job as a cook on the [[SS Yarmouth|SS ''Yarmouth'']] to gain passage to France.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; He arrived in Paris alone and with little more than his cook's clothing, only to find that the principal peace negotiations had already taken place. The powers did not include any statement of racial equality. Trotter attracted the French press in his accounts of racial mistreatment in the United States, but he could not gain access to any of the official delegations to the peace conference.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 226–228&lt;/ref&gt; He also missed Du Bois' Pan-African Congress, which was held in February 1919 while he was still seeking passage.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 225&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotter returned to the United States in July 1919 to learn of [[Red Summer of 1919|ongoing race riots]] at major cities across the country. Postwar economic and social tensions had erupted, and blacks fought back against white violence in cities such as [[Chicago Race Riot of 1919|Chicago]] and [[Omaha Race Riot of 1919|Omaha]]. Trotter quickly supported active resistance to white-on-black violence, writing, "Unless the white American behaves, he will find that in teaching our boys to fight for him he was starting something that he will not be able to stop."&lt;ref name=Fox233&gt;Fox, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;  His writings prompted calls in Congress for the censorship of the Negro press: South Carolina Congressman [[James F. Byrnes]] accused Trotter of "doing his utmost to incite riots and bloodshed."&lt;ref name=Fox233/&gt; Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge]] gave Trotter a chance to testify during Senate deliberations on ratification of the [[Treaty of Versailles]], which Lodge opposed on grounds other than Trotter's. Lodge's opposition was successful: the Senate never ratified the treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other protests and later years==
[[Image:Birth of a Nation theatrical poster.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Theatrical poster for ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'']]
Trotter mounted a campaign against [[Thomas Dixon Jr.|Thomas Dixon]]'s play ''[[The Clansman]]'' when it opened in Boston in 1910, which portrayed the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in heroic terms during Reconstruction. His protests succeeded in closing the production.&lt;ref&gt;Harrison, pp. 242–243&lt;/ref&gt;  While on his speaking tour in early 1915, he learned that [[D. W. Griffith]]'s movie, ''[[The Birth of a Nation]],'' adapted from ''The Clansman'', would be opening in Boston. He rushed back to lead protests against the film.  In April, the [[Tremont Theatre, Boston (1889)|Tremont Theatre]] denied Trotter and a group of African Americans tickets to the showing. When they refused to leave the lobby, plainclothes police moved in, sparking a scuffle.  Trotter and ten others were arrested; other protests took place both inside and outside the theater.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;  Trotter, united with other factions of the African-American community, tried but could not get the film banned in Boston.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 194–197&lt;/ref&gt;  This united front, along with the death later in 1915 of Booker T. Washington, reduced for a time the internal hostilities in the Boston African-American community.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 198–200&lt;/ref&gt;

The KKK had a revival for a decade after 1915, especially in industrial cities and the Midwest. In 1921, Trotter was successful in shutting down new screenings of ''The Birth of a Nation'' in Boston; he allied with Roman Catholic organizations, who objected to the KKK's anti-Catholic stance of the 20th century, and were strong in the city as a result of extensive Irish and Italian immigration.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 260–261&lt;/ref&gt;

Trotter's wife had died in the [[1918 influenza pandemic]]. She had been a partner in all his activities and he missed her greatly.&lt;ref name=H240&gt;Harrison, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Dyer Anti-Lynching Bill}}
Through the 1920s and 1930s, Trotter subsided into a genteel poverty, using the ''Guardian'' as an ongoing voice of protest.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 260–270&lt;/ref&gt; He lobbied for anti-[[lynching]] bills in Congress, with limited success. Even when the House overwhelmingly passed such a bill in 1922, the Southern bloc in the Senate filibustered and effectively killed passage of the bill for three years running.&lt;ref name="AP"&gt;[http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,159348,00.html Associated Press, "Senate Apologizes for Not Passing Anti-Lynching Laws"], Fox News. Note: From 1882-1968, "...nearly 200 anti-lynching bills were introduced in Congress, and three passed the House. Seven presidents between 1890 and 1952 petitioned Congress to pass a federal law." None was approved by the Senate because of the powerful opposition of the Southern Democratic voting bloc.&lt;/ref&gt; (White Democrats effectively controlled nearly all the Congressional seats apportioned to the total population of the South, after having disfranchised blacks.&lt;ref name="pildes"/&gt;) They controlled chairmanships of numerous important committees, which were established by seniority.&lt;ref name="AP"/&gt;

In 1923 Trotter eventually came to an uneasy truce with the NAACP.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 240–249&lt;/ref&gt; His attempts to promote his style of activism, however, were eclipsed by activities of younger leaders, such as [[Marcus Garvey]], a [[Jamaica]]n immigrant in New York City and leader of the [[UNIA]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 252–256&lt;/ref&gt;

Through these years, Trotter routinely wrote in the ''Guardian'' about incidents of racial injustice, including the 1931 trials of the [[Scottsboro boys]]. They had been accused and were convicted of raping two white women in Alabama. Historians have concluded they were innocent.&lt;ref&gt;Puttkammer and Worthy, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt;

On the morning of April 7, 1934, his 62nd birthday, William Monroe Trotter died after a fall from the roof of his home in Boston.  The cause is uncertain, but it is known that he was depressed and troubled at the time. He may have committed [[suicide]].&lt;ref&gt;Fox, pp. 271–275&lt;/ref&gt;
