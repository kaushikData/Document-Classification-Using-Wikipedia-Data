'''Asceticism''' is a term derived from the [[Greek language|Greek]] verb ἀσκέω, meaning "to practise strenuously," "to exercise." Athletes were therefore said to go through [[ascetic]] training, and to be ascetics.

In this usage the twofold application—to the mode of living and the results attained—which marks the later theological implication of the term is clearly discernible. From the arena of physical contests the word easily passed over to that of spiritual struggles,  and pre-[[Christian]] writers speak of the "askesis" of the soul or of virtue—the discipline of the soul, or the exercise in virtue. But the physical idea, no less than the moral, underlies the meaning of the term in medieval Christian parlance. The monastery, as the place where the required life of abstemiousness is lived under rigorous regulation and discipline, becomes the "asketerion," a word which to the classical Greek conveyed only the notion of a place reserved for physical exercise; while the monks were the "ascetikoi," the ascetics, under discipline attaining unto the perfect practise.

==Torture of the flesh==
Asceticism is indigenous to the religions which posit as fundamental the wickedness of this life and the corruption under sin of the flesh. [[Buddhism]], therefore, as well as [[Christianity]], leads to ascetic practices. Monasteries are institutions of Buddhism no less than of [[Catholic]] Christianity. The assumption, found in the views of the [[Montanists]] and others, that concessions made to the natural appetites may be pardoned in those that are of a lower degree of holiness, while the perfectly holy will refuse to yield in the least to carnal needs and desires, is easily detected also in some of the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]]. The ideal of holiness of both the Buddhist and the Christian saint culminates in poverty and chastity; i.e., celibacy. [[Fasting]] and other disciplinary methods are resorted to curb the flesh.

Under a strict construction of the meaning of Asceticism, it is an error to assume that its history may be extended to embrace also certain rites in vogue among devotees to fetishism and nature worship. Mutilations, the sacrifice of the hair, dietary observances and prohibitions, which abound in all forms of religion at a certain stage of development, do not spring from the notion of the sinfulness of the natural instincts and of life. Nor is the sacrificial scheme in any way connected with Asceticism. The idea of privation is foreign to it. If the offering was a gift to the Deity and as such entailed upon the offerer the parting with something of value, the expectation which animated him was invariably that of receiving rich return. But whatever theory must be accepted in explanation of the various rites of mutilation, and of the sacrificial ritual, certain it is that Judaism from the beginning set its face most sternly against the one, and materially restricted the other. Mutilations for whatever purpose and of whatever character were absolutely prohibited. Funeral horrors and superstitions were not tolerated. The [[Levitical]] code restricted sacrifices to one place. The priests only were entrusted with the office at the altar. And, if the Prophets are the truest expounders of the ideals and ideas of the religion of Israel, even the sacrificial and sacerdotal system, with its implications of extraordinary and precautionary cleanliness and physical abstemiousness, was of little vital moment.

Fasting, which plays so essential a part in the practices of ascetics, classically found official recognition only in the development of the [[Yom Kippur|Day of Atonement]]. The Prophets, again, had little patience with fasting. There are some obscure allusions to fast days of popular observance, but the Prophets of exilic and postexilic days insist on the futility of this custom. [[Isaiah]] (lviii.), while appealing for a broader charity and deeper sense of justice, maintains that these, and not fasting, are the expression of a will sanctified unto God. It is characteristic of the attitude of later Judaism that this very chapter has been assigned for the [[Hafṭarah]] for the Day of Atonement, the one penitential fast-day of the synagogue.

==Fasting==
Nevertheless, fasting among the Jews was resorted to in times of great distress. The [[Book of Esther]], of late date, illustrates this for the period included in the Biblical canon. Rabbinical sources prove the growing tendency to abstain from drink and food whenever memories of disaster marked the days of the synagogal calendar, or instant danger threatened the community. In the scheme of the synagogue the one fast-day of the Bible received no less than twenty-two as companions (compare [[Fasting in Judaism]]).

Still, it may be doubted whether this multiplication of fast-days can be taken as a sign of an increased tendency to Asceticism. Probably the theory of [[Robertson Smith]] (''The Religion of the Semites,'' p.&amp;nbsp;413) still holds good to a large extent in explanation of many of the fast-observances of later Judaism, as undoubtedly it does for the voluntary and occasional fast-days mentioned in the historical books of the Bible; namely, that Oriental fasting is merely a preparation for the eating of the sacrificial meal. The rabbinical injunction, not to eat too late a meal on the eve of the [[Shabbat|Sabbath]]-day, so as to enjoy all the more that of the Sabbath, tends to corroborate the theory. Perhaps this also underlies the rabbinical report that some examples of rabbinical piety fasted every Friday (in preparation for the Sabbath).

==Ascetics in Talmud==
Among the Rabbis some are mentioned as great and consistent fasters. [[Rabbi Zeira]] especially is remembered for his fondness of this form of piety. Yet to make of him an ascetic would be inaccurate. He fasted that he might forget his [[Babylonian Jews|Babylonian]] method of teaching before emigrating to [[Palestine (region)|Palestine]] ([[B. M.]] 85a). The story continues that he abstained from drink and food for the period of one hundred days, in order that hell-fire might later have no power over him. [[Simon ben YoḦai]] is depicted as an ascetic in the traditions preserved in rabbinical literature. But exposed to persecutions under the [[Hadrian]] régime, and often in danger of his life, his whole mind was of an exceptionally somber turn for a Jewish teacher. Moreover, his ascetic practices were not inspired by a consciousness of the futility of this life and its sinfulness, but by the anxiety to fulfill to the letter the Law, to "ponder on the Torah day and night". He begrudged the hours necessary for the care of the body as so many precious moments stolen from the study of the holy Law. He envied the generation of the desert who had been fed on heavenly manna, and were thus absolved from the care for their daily bread; an echo of this sentiment may be detected in the petition of [[Jesus]] for daily bread (on Simon b. YoḦai, see [[W. Bacher]], ''Ag. Tan.'' ii. 70-149).

Still, with all these seeming leanings to ascetic conduct, these rabbis did not encourage ''individual'' fasting. The ''community'' in distress did indeed proclaim a public fast, and it was the duty of the loyal member to participate. For he who would not share in the distress would have no part in the consolation of the people ([[Ta'an.]] 11a). The habitual faster was called a sinner (ib.). This judgment was enforced by an appeal to the Biblical text in connection with the [[Nazirite|Nazir]]'s (Nazarite's) expiatory sacrifice ([[Num.]] vi. 11). [[Rabbi Zeira]] would not permit his disciples to indulge in extraordinary practices of self-restraint, if they presumed thereby to reflect on the piety of others saner than they. The title applied to such an adept at saintly practices is characteristically deprecatory for his attitude of mind: his conduct is declared to smack of conceit, if not of hypocrisy ([[Yer.]] [[Berakhot (Talmud)|Ber.]] ii. 5d).

The attempt has been made to explain the Biblical [[Nazarites]] as forerunners of monastic orders addicted to the practice of ascetic discipline. [[Pentateuchal]] legislation concerning them shows them to have been merely tolerated. Modern criticism explains their peculiarities as arising from motives other than those that determine the conduct of ascetics. The Biblical Nazirs, forerunners of the [[Nebi'im]] (Prophets), were Protestants against the adoption of the customs and the religious rites of the [[Canaanites]]. In their dress and mode of life they emphasized their loyalty to [[Yahweh|YHVH]], enthroned on the desert mountain. Wine and the crown of hair were sacred to the gods of the land. Their very appearance emphasized their rejection of the new deities. And in later days the number of those that took the Nazarite vow was exceedingly small. One is inclined to the opinion that no case occurred in which the Pentateuchal provisions became effective.

==Essenes not ascetics==
Nor may the [[Essenes]] be classed among the order of ascetics. While some of their institutions, notably celibacy, appear to lend support to the theory that would class them as such, their fundamental doctrines show no connection with the pessimism that is the essential factor in Asceticism. They were political indifferentists; they were but little, if at all, under the sway of national aspirations. They stood for a universal fellowship of the pure and just. They set but little store by the goods of this earth, and were members of a communistic fraternity. But it is inadmissible to construe from these elements of their hopes and habits the inference that in them is to be found a genuine Jewish order of monks and ascetics.

A stronger case against the theory that Judaism is a very uncongenial soil for the growth of Asceticism might be made out by an appeal to the later Jewish mystics, the [[Ḥasidim]] and [[Kabbalah|Cabalists]] of various forms, all ecstatic fantastics, and—this is a point that must not be overlooked—more or less strongly under the influence of distinctly non-Jewish conceits.  See below, [[#Examples of Jewish asceticism|Examples of Jewish Asceticism]].

Looking upon this life as essentially good, according to [[Gen.]] i. 31; upon the human body as a servant of the spirit, and therefore not corrupt; upon the joys of earth as God-given and therefore to be cherished with gratitude toward the divine giver; having a prayer for every indulgence in food and drink; a benediction for every new experience of whatever nature, gladsome or sad—the Jew partook with genuine zest of the good cheer of life, without, however, lapsing into frivolity, gluttony, or intemperance. His religion, that taught him to remember his dignity as one made in the image of God, and to hold his body in esteem as the temple of God's spirit within, a dwelling of the Most Holy, "a host," as [[Hillel the Elder|Hillel]] put it, "for the guest, the soul," kept the Jew equidistant from the pole of self-torturing pessimism, from the mortification of the flesh under the obsession of its sinfulness and foulness, and from the other pole of levity and sensuousness.

Never intemperate in drink or food, he sought and found true joy in the consecration of his life and all of its powers and opportunities to the service of his God, a God who had caused the fruit of the vine to grow and the earth to give forth the bread, a God who created the light and sent the darkness, a God who, as a [[Talmudical]] legend—one of the many with [[Elijah]] for their subject—has it, reserves paradise "for them that cause their fellows to laugh" ([[Ta'an.]] 22a). The most beautiful saying of the rabbis about Asceticism is: "Man will have to give account in the future for every lawful enjoyment offered to him which he has ungratefully refused" ([[Abba Arika|Rab]] in [[Yer.]] [[Ḳid.]], at the close); compare [[TanḦ.]], end, "The wicked in his life is considered as one dead," etc.

==Examples of Jewish asceticism==
While the dominant note of [[Judaism]] is optimism, faith in a God who delights in the happiness of His creatures and expects their grateful appreciation of His bounties—see [[Abstinence in Judaism]]—there have, nevertheless, been prevalent in Jewish life certain ascetic tendencies of which the historian must take account.

===Shammaites and Hillelites===
The two great rabbinical schools of the first pre-Christian century, the [[Shammaites]] and the [[Hillelites]], debated the question whether life was worth living or not—"ṭob le-adam shenibra mishelo nibra" ([[Moed|Er.]] 13b), and there was an unmistakable element of austerity in the teaching of many a Shammaite that favored asceticism (compare [[II Esdras]] iv. 12). While one teacher would say, "The Shekinah rests on man only amid cheerfulness that comes from duty well performed" ([[Pes.]] ii. 7a), another held the view that "there should be no unrestrained laughter in this world" ([[Berakhot (Talmud)|Ber.]] 31a).

But it was particularly with the view of fitting the soul for communion with God, or for the purpose of keeping the body sufficiently pure to allow it to come into contact with sacred objects, that many strove to avoid things that either cause intoxication or [[Levitical]] impurity, the drinking of wine ([[Lev.]] x. 9; [[Num.]] vi. 3; [[Book of Amos|Amos]] ii. 12; [[Book of Judges|Judges]] xiii. 14), or sexual intercourse, which was forbidden to the [[people of Israel]], in preparation for the [[Sinai Revelation]] ([[Book of Exodus|Ex.]] xix. 15), and to [[Moses]] during the life of communion with God ([[Deut.]] ix. 9, 18; [[I Sam.]] xxi. 5; [[Shab.]] 87a).

According to this principle the life of the ancient Ḥasidim or Perushim ([[Pharisees]]) and Ẓenu'im ([[Essenes]]) was regulated. At the same time these devotees of holiness, making "askesis" (the practise of fortitude) their special object of life,&lt;ref&gt;See [[Philo]], ed. [[Thomas Mangey]], ''De Vita Contemplativa,'' ii. 475, 477, 482.&lt;/ref&gt; were naturally led to view sensual life as contaminating. [[F. C. Conybeare]]&lt;ref&gt;''About Philo's Contemplative Life,'' p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; says: "Philo's ideal was to die daily, to mortify the flesh with fasting; he only insisted that the seclusion from social life should take place at the age of fifty, the time when the Levites retired from the active duties of the Temple service".&lt;ref&gt;See all the passages in Conybeare, l.c. pp. 265-273, 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

This was exactly the view of the Essenes and [[Therapeutæ]] also, in whatever connection they stood to Jonadab ben Rechab and the Kenites (see [[Mekhilta of Rabbi Ishmael|Mek.]], [[Yitro]], 2, regarding "the water-drinkers" (shote mayim), as some of these are called). [[Banus]], the eremite saint with whom [[Josephus]] passed three years of his life (Josephus, ''Vita,'' § 2), was certainly an ascetic. Likewise were [[John the Baptist]] ([[Gospel of Matthew|Matt.]] iii. 4 and parallels) and the early Christians, [[Paul the Apostle|Paul]] included, insofar as they shunned marriage as a concession to the flesh (Matt. xix. 10-12; [[I Cor.]] vii. 28-38), imbued with ascetic views. It was exactly in opposition to this tendency, so marked in early [[Christianity]], that the [[Talmudists]] denounced fasting and penitence ([[Ta'anit]] 11a, b) and accentuated the duty of cheerfulness in the [[Elijah]] legend (Ta'anit 22a). Upon the destruction of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]] in the year 70, a veritable wave of asceticism swept over the people, and in tribute to the national misfortune various ascetic rules were instituted (see [[Bava Batra|B. B.]] 60b; [[Tosefta]] [[Soṭah]], end; [[II Esdras]] ix. 24; compare [[W. Bacher]], ''Agada der Tannaiten,'' i. 164).

===Mysticism and asceticism===
Still, mysticism, which goes hand in hand with asceticism, always had its esoteric circles. [[Judah ha-Nasi]], called "the saint," was an ascetic ([[Ket.]] 104a). Mar, the son of [[Ravina II|Rabina]], fasted throughout the whole year with the exception of the holy days and the eve of the [[Yom Kippur|Atonement Day]] ([[Pes.]] 68b). For the sake of communing with the upper world, the lower one was despised by the elect few who preserved the tradition of the [[gnosis]] and the apocalyptic mysteries.

So did the followers of [[Obadiah Abu-Isa]], the Isawites, and of [[Judah Yudghan]], the Yudghanites, at the close of the 7th century and at the beginning of the 8th, the forerunners of the [[Karaite (Jewish sect)|Karaites]], and many prominent Karaites themselves lead ascetic lives; abstaining from meat and wine, and spending much of their time in meditation and devotion, partly in order to obtain a deeper knowledge of the [[Scriptures]], partly as mourners over [[Jerusalem]] (see Shahrastani, ''Book of Religions and Philosophical Sects,'' Haarbrücker's translation, i. 254-257; [[H. Grätz]], ''Gesch. der Juden,'' iii. 417 et seq., 446 et seq.; [[Isaak Markus Jost|Jost]], ''Gesch. des Judenthums,'' ii. 350 et seq.).

To some extent, therefore, all the mystics of the [[Middle Ages]] were Ascetics, assuming or accepting for themselves the title of "Nazarites," or being called by their contemporaries "saints." This is especially true of [[Abraham ben David of Posquières]] and his circle in the 13th century, whose relation to the beginnings of the [[Kabbalah|Kabala]] can hardly be denied. Further, the currents of thought which, emanating from India, created [[Sufism]] in Persian and Mohammedan circles in the 12th and 13th centuries, exerted considerable influence upon Jewish thinkers, as may be learned from [[BaḦya]], whose ethical system, ''Ḥobot ha-Lebabot,'' oscillates between asceticism and Jewish optimism, with a decided leaning to the former (see below).

===Asceticism in Bachya===

=== Abraham ben Ḥiyya ===
Even such thinkers as opposed the ascetic view could not extricate themselves entirely from the meshes of [[Neoplatonic]] mysticism, which beheld in the flesh or in matter the source of evil. Thus [[Abraham ben Ḥiyya]] strongly refutes the Neoplatonic conception of evil as being identical with matter, and maintains against [[BaḦya]] that indulgence in fasting and other modes of penitence is not meritorious, since only he who is ruled by his lower desires may resort to asceticism as the means of curbing his passion and disciplining his soul, whereas the really good should confine himself to such modes of abstinence as are prescribed by the Law.

Nevertheless, Abraham b. Ḥiyya claims a higher rank for the saint who, secluded from the world, leads a life altogether consecrated to the service of God. He goes even so far as to advocate the state of celibacy in such cases, referring to the example of [[Moses]]—who had to abandon intercourse with his wife when receiving the laws on [[Sinai]]—to the majority of the prophets (who were, as he thinks, unmarried), and to [[Ben Azzai]] (according to [[Yeb.]] 63b). Like BaḦya, he considers that the ascetic, while leading a purer and holier life, requires less legal restraint (see his ''Hegyon ha-Nefesh,'' ed. Reifman, 16a, 32a, 37a; Rosin, ''Ethik des Maimonides,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;15, 16; [[Moritz Güdemann]], in ''Monatsschrift,'' 1900, pp.&amp;nbsp;196–216).

Of Asher, the son of [[Meshullam ben Jacob]] in [[Lunel]], [[Benjamin of Tudela]] (''Travels,'' ed. Asher, 3b) relates as eye-witness that he was an ascetic ("parush") who did not attend to any worldly business, but studied day and night, kept fasts, and never ate meat. His brother Jacob bore the title of [[Nazarite]], having also been an ascetic abstaining from wine (see [[Zunz]]'s note in Asher's ''Benjamin of Tudela,'' ii. 11, 12; [[H. Grätz]], ''Gesch. der Juden,'' vi. 240, 241).

Also the whole family of [[Judah the Ḧasid of Regensburg]], of the 12th century, his father, Samuel, and his grandfather, Kalonymus of Speyer, grandson of Eliezer the Great of Worms, seem to have been a family of Ascetics (see [[H. J. Michael]], ''Or ha-Ḥayyim,'' Nos. 433, 990, 1174, 1200).

The subsequent development and growth of the [[Kabbalah|Kabala]] produced other forms of asceticism. In fact, the Ḥasid and the Ẓanua' of the medieval apocalyptic literature being a survival of [[Essenism]], ablutions and fasting were resorted to by the adepts of the Cabala as means of attaining communion with the upper world. Some of these [[Ḥasidim]] would spend the whole week—without or with interruption, according to their physical endurance—in fasting, rendering only the Sabbath a day of comfort and joy. The object of their penitences and fastings was to bring about the time of divine favor, the [[Jewish Messiah|Messianic]] era. Every Messianic movement had therefore Ascetics as leaders, such as were the [[Shabbethaians]] (see [[H. Grätz]], ''Gesch. der Juden,'' iii. 307) and others (see [[Abraham ben Samuel Cohen of Lask]]). Others would refrain from eating animal food—'eber min ha-Ḥay—and, like the [[Buddhists]] or the [[Pythagoreans]] of old, live on vegetarian diet. The same is related by [[Epiphanius of Salamis|Epiphanius]] of the [[Dosithean]] sect.

=== Moses Maimonides ===
Against all these ascetic views and tendencies [[Maimonides]] raised his powerful voice, and his sober view maintained the upper hand. He admits the wholesome influence on those needing much discipline of the soul of fasting and vigils, of sexual and social abstemiousness, the self-torture of the hermit, and of the penitent who dwells in deserts and uses only coarse haircloth for the covering of his flesh; but he declares the constant use of what can at best be only a remedial measure in abnormal and unsound conditions of life to be a great folly and injurious extravagance.

Maimonides, while adopting the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] maxim of the golden middle way in all things, finds in the various restrictions of the dietary and marriage laws of the Torah a legislative system of training the people to a sobriety which makes superfluous such asceticism as the monks and the saints of other nations indulge in; nay, sinful indeed, according to the rabbinical interpretation of [[Num.]] vi. 11, which says that the priest shall "make an atonement for him [the Nazir] for that he has sinned against the person [in making his vow of abstinence]" (see [[Ned.]] 10a; Maimonides, ''Yad,'' De'ot, iii. 1, vi. 1).

Jewish hermits, living in a state of celibacy and devoting themselves to meditation, are still (circa 1906) found among the [[Falashas]]. They claim that [[Aaron]] the high priest was the first [[Nazarite]] who from the time of his consecration separated from his wife to live only in the shadow of the tabernacle. Accordingly, they join the monastic order after they have been married and have become fathers of children ([[Halévy]], ''Travels in Abyssinia,'' p.&amp;nbsp;230). According to Flad (''Abyssinische Juden,'' pp.&amp;nbsp;32 et seq.), the order founded by [[Abba Sabra]] (Halévy, ''Abba Sura'') consists altogether of eunuchs. This would indicate non-Jewish influence, of which the Falashas show many traces.

'''Božidar Knežević ''' (3 March 1862, [[Ub, Serbia|Ub]] - 18 February 1905, [[Belgrade]]) was a Serbian philosopher, writer and literary critic. Although he was educated for the priesthood, he turned from Orthodox religion to a faith in science and in social regeneration under the guidance of the intellectual elite. For him the unpardonable sin was dogmatism, since he believed that neither religious, nor historical, nor scientific knowledge is wholly accurate. 
 
==Biography==

Božidar Knežević was born in Ub, in the [[Valjevo]] municipality, on the third of March 1862. He completed his gymnasium and got his B.A. degree in History and Philosophy from Belgrade's ''[[Grandes écoles]]'' ([[University of Belgrade]]) in 1883. At the same time he concluded that a career in the Church was impossible for one with his individualistic religious views. A trial at teaching in 1884 at a gymnasium in Uzice convinced him that he could endure teaching. A year later he took a few months leave to volunteer for the Serbo-Bulgarian War (1885). His vision was also social and political. He believed in man's dignity and natural right to liberty. ("As long as there are captive peoples, the free will be in danger"). For the next 20 years he taught throughout Serbia, moved from one town to the next, Though this job entailed a great amount of drugery, he managed to write and publish several volumes.  In 1889 he was transferred from his teaching post in Uzice to Nis. From 1893 to 1894 he was a high school teacher in Čačak, Kragujevac and again in Čačak, where he was also made principal. Here he found a coterie of admirers, and a change in fortune and reputation came with the publication of "''Principi istorije''" (Principles of history) in 1898. Henceforth, history and philosophy were his major interests. He subsequently published   "''Red u Istoriji''" (Discipline in History, 1898), "''Proporcija u Istroiji''" (Proportions in History, 1901), "''Misli''" (Thoughts), which appeared in serial form in ''Srpski Knjizevni Glasnik'' (Serbian Literary Herald) in 1901, and the second volume of "''Principi istorije''" also in 1901, all this while holding his teaching and administrative job as secondary school principal in Šabac (1899-1902).

In 1902 Knežević was transferred back to Belgrade. Such constant transfers from one high school to another while translating foreign authors and writing about history and philosophy at the same time is a testament to struggle and to courage, for every bit of it was composed under conditions which most writers would find impossible. There can be no question that much of the writing he did was written under difficult conditions. Furthermore, his illness contributed to his death. He died at Belgrade on 18 February 1905 of tuberculosis. He was only 43.

==Philosophy==

In Serbia at the end of the nineteenth century, the most interesting, if not the most distinguished, philosopher and writer was Božidar Knežević, a lonely schoolteacher, philosopher of history, metaphysician, and ethical theorist, who developed a quite original theory of universal evolution in his visionary treatise, "''Principi Istorije''" (Principles of History). He was, indeed, an original thinker. Integrity as well as lasting inspirations to future generations of our species on this earth and elsewhere, perhaps even in the as yet uncharted depths of abysmal space were questions on his mind.

Having spent his entire life in Serbia, Božidar Knežević speculated on the nature of the universe and wondered about the meaning, purpose, and ultimate destiny of humankind within a cosmic scheme of things. Knežević postulated a cosmos that evolved through three major phases: organic, inorganic, and psychic.
He wrote, "A dogma is an embalmed thought: dead but whole, live but motionless, soulless but powerful."
 
The whole, which is unconscious and general, precedes the part, which is conscious and specific. When the part separates from the whole, there is conflict with the whole and with other parts. From this conflict there arises a new order and proportionality which is only temporary and gives place to a new phase of disintegration. However, in history as a whole, the growth of civilization leads to increasing social justice and the elimination of irrationality in human life. Although Božidar Knežević assumed the existence of God as a primary and eternal substance, he held that as human altruism develops, man withdraws from God. Morality and more moral organization of social life are born out of pain and suffering. It consists in the liberation from all external forces and presupposes the overcoming of ordinary motives for human behavior.

Yet however much one might be tempted to dismiss the philosophy of Božidar Knežević as a quaint Balkan period piece, it is more than that. Its special rhetoric belongs to a dead past, but positivism and heroism both survive in various modelations in the late nineteenth century (1898) and at the turn of the twentieth century (1901) when Knežević was writing his treatise, Principi istorije (Principles of History, Volumes 1 &amp; 2). In his major works Knežević presented an original world-view that ingeniously synthesizes both historicism and positivism with a cosmic scheme of things. The result is a vast, dynamic, and unique vision of mankind's place and destiny within the determining laws of an evolving then devolving universe.

"All things born must die. Only what never began will never end; what preceded everything else will survive everything else; what happened first will disappear last."

In his metaphysics, Knežević asserts the primacy of a deeper moral dimension of the world. Above truth, according to Knežević, stands justice. The discovery of the intrinsic justice in the world is achieved through truth."The entire truth does not rest in any particular theory, idea or principle, as there are only particles of the whole truth...."writes Knežević. "Error is a belief that something untrue is true. A lie is a conscious distortion of truth. Error is noble and natural. Error is a lower degree of truth. A lie is an obstacle to truth."

He said, "''The entire truth does not rest in any particular theory, idea or principle, as these are only particles of the whole truth....''" 

He envisioned a worldwide socio-cultural system as the outgrowth of human progress grounded in science and historical understanding.

==Work==

In 1898 Bozidar Knežević published his seminal work, a visionary treatise entitled "''Principi istorije''" (Principles of history) in two volumes. "Since everything that exists", he argued, "exists only in history, history takes over the fields of other sciences and offers the highest human understanding". In addition, "history binds all peoples and leads to their reconciliation and overall harmony". Knežević’s optimism and belief in the progress of the human mind is tempered with his belief that "the total quantity of time available to the living is limited: human civilization and even human life is thus bound to disappear". Proportion, he boldly states, is "the [[Telos (philosophy)]] of history." As both nature and humans strive after this ideal, "proportion is used to explain the nature of truth, reason, good, progress, beauty, justice and freedom". Once elements achieve proportion and balance with each other, "they live simultaneously" in a great organic whole in which one can ultimately arrive at "complete morality, freedom, justice and truth". Whereas academic philosophers repudiated this system as incoherent, many Serb ''avant-garde'' poets and writers found in it a congenial vision of the universe in which everything, including poetry and beauty, had its own rightful place in a world striving after proportion.

Božidar Knežević's other main works are "''Red u Istoriji''" (Discipline in History, 1898); "''Proporcija u Istroiji''" (Proportions in History, 1901); and "''Misli''" (Thoughts, which appeared in serial form in ''Srpski Knjizevni Glasnik''/ Serbian Literary Herald, 1901). Today's Serbia does not look like the dark and hopeless "''Stradija''" (Land of Tribulation) as it seemed to [[Radoje Domanović]] and Božidar Knežević when he was writing his doleful "''Misli''" (Thoughts).

Knežević acknowledges his indebtness to [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]] as well as [[Karl Marx]], [[Charles Darwin]], and [[Herbert Spencer]].

Also, Knežević translated the works of two Englishmen, [[Thomas Carlyle]]'s "On Heroes and Hero Worship and the Heroic in History (1841) and "History of Civilization in England" (1857) by [[Henry Thomas Buckle]].

Carlyle became a part of the intellectual armor of every self-respecting young man, thanks to Božidar Knežević, a thinker of unusual power. Knežević was almost exclusively under the influence of English thought, though he never left Serbia. He did more than anybody to introduce the world literature and philosophy to his countrymen. With probing intellect and soaring genius, Knežević continuously explored and devoured volumes of world literature in numerous languages (English, German, French, Italian and Russian).

[[File:Simplified_Structure_of_the_Linux_Kernel.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|The location of [[process scheduler]]s in a simplified structure of the [[Linux kernel]]]]
The '''Brain Fuck Scheduler''' ('''BFS''') is a [[process scheduler]] designed for the [[Linux kernel]] in August 2009 as an alternative to the [[Completely Fair Scheduler]] (CFS) and the [[O(1) scheduler]].&lt;ref name="Linux Pro Magazine on BFS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linuxpromagazine.com/Online/News/Con-Kolivas-Introduces-New-BFS-Scheduler |title=Con Kolivas Introduces New BFS Scheduler » Linux Magazine |publisher=Linuxpromagazine.com |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; BFS was created by veteran kernel programmer [[Con Kolivas]].&lt;ref name="bfsfaq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ck.kolivas.org/patches/bfs/bfs-faq.txt |title=FAQs about BFS v0.330 |publisher=Ck.kolivas.org |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The objective of BFS, compared to other schedulers, is to provide a scheduler with a simpler algorithm, that does not require adjustment of heuristics or tuning parameters to tailor performance to a specific type of computation workload. Kolivas asserted that these tunable parameters were difficult for the average user to understand, especially in terms of interactions of multiple parameters with each other, and claimed that the use of such tuning parameters could often result in improved performance in a specific targeted type of computation, at the cost of worse performance in the general case.&lt;ref name="bfsfaq"/&gt; BFS has been reported to improve responsiveness on Linux desktop computers with fewer than 16 [[CPU core|cores]].&lt;ref name="shedulers compared" /&gt;

Shortly following its introduction, the new scheduler made headlines within the Linux community, appearing on ''[[Slashdot]]'', with reviews in ''[[Linux Magazine (USA)|Linux Magazine]]'' and ''[[Linux Magazine|Linux Pro Magazine]]''.&lt;ref name="Linux Pro Magazine on BFS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slashdot.org/story/09/09/06/0433209/Con-Kolivas-Returns-With-a-Slashdo |title=Con Kolivas Returns, With a Desktop-Oriented Linux Scheduler |publisher=Slashdot |date= |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linux-magazine.com/Online/News/Ingo-Molnar-Tests-New-BF-Scheduler |title=Ingo Molnar Tests New BF Scheduler |publisher=Linux Magazine |date=2009-09-08 |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there have been varied reviews of improved performance and responsiveness, Con Kolivas did not intend for BFS to be integrated into the mainline kernel.&lt;ref name="bfsfaq" /&gt;

==Benchmarks==
In a contemporary study,&lt;ref name="shedulers compared"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://repo-ck.com/bench/cpu_schedulers_compared.pdf |title=CPU Schedulers Compared |publisher=Repo-ck.com |accessdate=2013-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; the author compared the BFS to the CFS using the Linux kernel v3.6.2 and several performance-based endpoints. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS) in the [[Vanilla (software)|vanilla]] Linux kernel and the BFS in the corresponding kernel patched with the ck1 patchset. Seven different machines were used to see if differences exist and, to what degree they scale using performance based metrics. Number of logical CPUs ranged from 1 to 16. These end-points were never factors in the primary design goals of the BFS. The results were encouraging.

Kernels patched with the ck1 patch set including the BFS outperformed the vanilla kernel using the CFS at nearly all the performance-based benchmarks tested{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}. Further study with a larger test set could be conducted, but based on the small test set of 7 PCs evaluated, these increases in process queuing, efficiency/speed are, on the whole, independent of CPU type (mono, dual, quad, hyperthreaded, etc.), CPU architecture (32-bit and 64-bit) and of CPU multiplicity (mono or dual socket).

Moreover, several "modern" CPUs, such as the Intel [[Core 2 Duo]] and [[Core i7]], that represent common workstations and laptops, consistently outperformed the CFS in the vanilla kernel at all benchmarks. Efficiency and speed gains were small to moderate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20999">'''Centering Prayer''' is a method of meditation used by  Christians placing a strong emphasis on interior silence. 
The modern Centering Prayer movement in Christianity can be traced to several books published by three [[Trappist]] monks of [[St. Joseph's Abbey]] in Spencer, Massachusetts in the 1970s: Fr. [[William Meninger]], Fr. [[Basil Pennington|M. Basil Pennington]] and Abbot [[Thomas Keating]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Centering Prayer Overview | work = Contemplative Outreach Ltd.

The creators of the Centering Prayer movement claim to trace their roots to the contemplative prayer of the [[Desert Fathers]] of early [[Christian monasticism]], to the [[Lectio Divina]] tradition of [[Benedictine]] [[monasticism]], and to works like ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'' and the writings of [[St. Teresa of Avila]] and [[St. John of the Cross]]. Advocates of Centering Prayer say it does not replace other prayer but encourages silence and deeper connection to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/centering-prayer-contemplative-practice-21st-century|title=Centering Prayer: Contemplative practice for the 21st century|date=2014-12-03|newspaper=America Magazine|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Also advocates of Centering Prayer say it helps people be more present and open to God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.jesuit.org.uk/blog/godtalk-centering-prayer|title=Godtalk: Centering Prayer {{!}} Jesuits in Britain|website=www.jesuit.org.uk|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Father Thomas Keating has promoted both [[Lectio Divina]] and Centering Prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/category/category/lectio-divina|title=Lectio Divina {{!}} Contemplative Outreach Ltd.|website=www.contemplativeoutreach.org|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, some people, including [[Pope Benedict XVI]], consider Centering Prayer controversial. Some authors argue that Centering Prayer contradicts the teachings of the [[Carmelite]] saints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/why-centering-prayer-falls-short-of-true-intimacy-with-christ|title=Why Centering Prayer Falls Short of True Intimacy With Christ|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others also argue that Centering Prayer is a distortion of the teachings of the [[Desert Fathers]] and ''[[The Cloud of Unknowing]]'', and is in contradiction to ''[[Lectio Divina]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=234|title=Library : The Danger of Centering Prayer|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://iscenteringprayercatholic.wordpress.com/quick-questions/#Q16|title=Quick Questions|date=2016-05-26|language=en-US|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some consider it to fall afoul of the [[Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith]]'s caution against similar prayer forms in their ''Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?id=6892&amp;repos=1&amp;subrepos=0&amp;searchid=1641455|title=Library : Centering Prayer Meets the Vatican|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===Claimed origins===
Seeds of what would become known as contemplation, for which the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] term {{lang|grc|θεωρία}} ''[[theoria]]'' is also used,&lt;ref name="Inner"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8Y2gX6JQr-4C&amp;pg=PA24 William Johnston, ''The Inner Eye of Love: Mysticism and Religion''] (Harper Collins 2004 {{ISBN|0-8232-1777-9}}), p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; were sown early in the Christian era.

The earliest Christian writings that clearly speak of contemplative prayer come from the 4th-century monk [[John Cassian|St. John Cassian]], who wrote of a practice he learned from the [[Desert Fathers]] (specifically from Isaac). Cassian's writings remained influential until the medieval era when monastic practice shifted from a mystical orientation to [[Scholasticism]]. During the 16th century, Carmelite saints [[St. Teresa of Avila|Teresa of Avila]] and [[St. John of the Cross|John of the Cross]] wrote and taught about advanced [[Christian prayer]], which was given the name infused contemplation.

The 20th century Trappist monk and writer [[Thomas Merton]] was influenced by [[Buddhist]] meditation, particularly as found in [[Zen]]. He was a lifetime friend of Buddhist meditation master and Vietnamese monk and peace activist [[Thich Nhat Hanh]], praised Chogyam Trungpa who founded Shambhala Buddhism in the United States and was also an acquaintance of the current [[Dalai Lama]]. His theology attempted to unify [[existentialism]] with the tenets of the [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] faith.&lt;ref&gt;http://atheism.about.com/od/typesofexistentialism/a/christian.htm&lt;/ref&gt; As such he was also an advocate of the non-rational meditation of contemplative prayer, which he saw as a direct confrontation of finite and irrational man with his [[ground of being]].

===Development===
[[Cistercian]] monk Father [[Thomas Keating]], a founder of Centering Prayer, was abbot all through the 60s and 70s at St. Joseph’s Abbey in Spencer, Massachusetts. This area is thick with religious retreat centres, including the well-known [[Theravada]] Buddhist centre, [[Insight Meditation Society]]. Fr. Keating tells of meeting many young people, some who stumbled on St. Joseph’s by accident, many of them born Catholic, who had turned to Eastern practices for contemplative work. He found many of them had no knowledge of the contemplative traditions within Christianity and set out to present those practices in a more accessible way. The result was the practice now called Centering Prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Rose, Phil Fox |title= Meditation for Christians |work= Patheos | url = http://www.patheos.com/blogs/philfoxrose/meditation-for-christians/ |accessdate=  23 February 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Practice==
Fr. [[Basil Pennington|M. Basil Pennington]] suggests these steps for practicing Centering Prayer:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title= Centering prayer: Refining the Rules |last= Pennington |first= Fr. M. Basil |date= |website= |publisher= Review for Religious, 45:3, 386-393 |access-date=August 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Sit comfortably with your eyes closed, relax, and quiet yourself. Be in love and faith to God. 
# Choose a sacred word that best supports your sincere intention to be in the Lord's presence and open to His divine action within you. 
# Let that word be gently present as your symbol of your sincere intention to be in the Lord's presence and open to His divine action within you. 
# Whenever you become aware of anything (thoughts, feelings, perceptions, images, associations, etc.), simply return to your sacred word, your anchor.

In addition, Fr. Keating writes, 
{{quote|The method consists in letting go of every kind of thought during prayer, even the most devout thoughts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Open Mind, Open Heart, 20th Anniversary Edition|last=Keating|first=Fr. Thomas|publisher=Bloomsbury|year=2006|isbn=|location=London|pages=21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In centering prayer, the participant seeks the presence of God directly (aided by the [[Jesus Prayer]], perhaps) and explicitly rejects discursive thoughts and imagined scenes. The participant's aim is to be present to the Lord, to "consent to God's presence and action during the time of prayer."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keating (2009), "Intimacy with God: an Introduction to Centering Prayer," 23.&lt;/ref&gt; Centering Prayer advocates link the practice to traditional forms of Christian meditation, such as on the [[rosary]], or [[lectio divina|Lectio Divina]].

Although the practice makes use of a "sacred word," Thomas Keating emphasizes that Centering Prayer is not an exercise in concentrating, or focusing one's attention on something (such as a mantra), but rather is concerned with intention and consent.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Keating (2009), "Intimacy with God: an Introduction to Centering Prayer," 15-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, the "sacred word" can integrate with breathing in and out.  Thus, rather than being a tool to quiet the mind, consent to the presence and action of God within and "just be" with God, it can become too prevalent during the practice of Centering Prayer.

==Reception==

===From Eastern Orthodoxy===
Orthodox Christian authorities argue that there is a gulf between the Jesus Prayer and non-Christian meditation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.orthodoxprayer.org/Jesus%20Prayer/Jesus%20Prayer-Not%20Eastern%20Meditation.html|title=The Jesus Prayer is Not a Form of Eastern Meditation or Yoga|last=|first=|date=|website=Orthodox Prayer|publisher=|access-date=26 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The standard criticism of Centering Prayer is that it is essentially non-Christian meditation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.catholicculture.org/culture/library/view.cfm?recnum=8912|title=Library : A Closer Look at Centering Prayer|website=www.catholicculture.org|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Jesus Prayer, critics argue, Centering Prayer can be and is practiced by non-Christians.

===From other Catholics===
Critics note that traditional prayers such as the Holy Rosary and Lectio Divina engage the heart and mind with Sacred Scripture, while Centering Prayer is "devoid of content".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.ncregister.com/daily-news/why-centering-prayer-is-not-christian-prayer#.V5fUaUYrKUk|title=Why Centering Prayer Is Not Christian Prayer|website=m.ncregister.com|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Holy Rosary and Lectio Divina, in contrast, have some contemplative goal in mind: with the Rosary, the [[Rosary devotions and spirituality|Mysteries of the Rosary]] are contemplated; with Lectio Divina, the practitioner thinks about the Scripture reading, sometimes even visualizing it.  

Critics also dispute the claim that Centering Prayer is in the tradition of the Desert Fathers and Carmelite saints, saying that traditional Catholic contemplative prayer is not so much a method of prayer as a stage of prayer in which God's action predominates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncregister.com/daily-news/why-centering-prayer-is-not-christian-prayer|title=Why Centering Prayer Is Not Christian Prayer|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; They cite the Catechism of the Catholic Church as evidence that meditation and contemplation are two different expressions of prayer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm |title=Catechism of the Catholic Church - Expressions of prayer |website=www.vatican.va |access-date=2016-07-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160801003944/http://www.vatican.va/archive/ccc_css/archive/catechism/p4s1c3a1.htm |archivedate=2016-08-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===From the Holy See===
In 1989, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith, led by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger (later Pope Benedict XVI) issued ''Letter to the Bishops of the Catholic Church on Some Aspects of Christian Meditation.''[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/congregations/cfaith/documents/rc_con_cfaith_doc_19891015_meditazione-cristiana_en.html] The letter addresses problematic elements found in some modern prayer methods, many of which have been influenced by Eastern religions and the New Age movement. Contemplative Outreach, which was founded by Fr. Keating and others to promote Centering Prayer, denies that this letter applies to Centering Prayer and states that Centering Prayer is connected to the Holy Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/faq#t59n54392|title=Frequently Asked Questions {{!}} Contemplative Outreach Ltd.|website=www.contemplativeoutreach.org|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of the method, however, point to similarities between the teaching of Fr. Keating and his colleagues and specific criticisms made by the CDF.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Is Centering Prayer Catholic? Fr. Thomas Keating Meets Teresa of Avil and the CDF|last=Rossini|first=Connie|publisher=Four Waters Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=New Ulm, Minnesota|pages=120|via=9780692618489}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.spiritualdirection.com/2010/10/18/what-does-the-vatican-say-about-centering-prayer|title=What does the Vatican say about Centering Prayer|date=2010-10-18|website=SpiritualDirection.com / Catholic Spiritual Direction|access-date=2016-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the Pontifical Council for Interreligious Dialogue and the Pontifical Council for Culture published ''Jesus Christ: The Bearer of the Water of Life, A Christian Reflection on the “New Age.”''[http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/interelg/documents/rc_pc_interelg_doc_20030203_new-age_en.html] Critics of Centering Prayer once again say their concerns were addressed in this document.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.womenofgrace.com/blog/?p=491|title=Priest and Former New Age Enthusiast Warns Catholics Away from Eastern Meditation {{!}} Women of Grace|website=www.womenofgrace.com|access-date=2016-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centering Prayer practitioners respond that ''Bearer of the Water of Life'' does not have doctrinal authority, and neither Vatican document mentions Centering Prayer, Contemplative Outreach, or Fr. Keating by name.

Pope Francis has not commented on Centering Prayer directly but has spoken very highly of Thomas Merton.  Thomas Merton described contemplative prayer as prayer "centered entirely on the presence of God." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.contemplativeoutreach.org/history-centering-prayer|title=History of Centering Prayer {{!}} Contemplative Outreach Ltd.|website=www.contemplativeoutreach.org|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pope Francis listed Thomas Merton as one of four great Americans in a speech before the U.S. Congress in September 2015 and encouraged sowing dialogue and peace in "the contemplative style of Thomas Merton." &lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://m.vatican.va/content/francescomobile/en/speeches/2015/september/documents/papa-francesco_20150924_usa-us-congress.html|title=Apostolic Journey - United States of America: Visit to the Congress of the United States of America (Washington D.C., 24 September 2015)|website=m.vatican.va|access-date=2016-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newberg explained one study that examined the brains of nuns who engaged in Centering Prayer, which is meant to create a feeling of oneness with God. The nuns' brain scans showed similarities to people who use drugs like psilocybin mushrooms, Newberg said, and both experiences "tend to result in very permanent changes in the way in which the brain works."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/05/28/psychedelic-drug-brain-effects_n_7455368.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Content analysis''' is a research method for studying [[document]]s and communication artifacts, which might be texts of various formats, pictures, audio or video. Social scientists use content analysis to examine patterns in communication in a replicable and systematic manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/746155102|title=Business research methods|last=Alan.|first=Bryman,|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|others=Bell, Emma, 1968-|isbn=9780199583409|edition=3rd|location=Cambridge|oclc=746155102}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the key advantages of using content analysis to analyse social phenomena is its non-invasive nature, in contrast to simulating social experiences or collecting survey answers.

Practices and philosophies of content analysis vary between academic disciplines. They all involve systematic reading or observation of [[text (literary theory)|texts]] or artifacts which are [[Coding (social sciences)|assigned labels (sometimes called codes)]] to indicate the presence of interesting, [[semantics|meaningful]] pieces of content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hodder|first=I.|title=The interpretation of documents and material culture|year=1994|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks etc.|isbn=0761926879|page=155|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CdCGek5KJ_QC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=hodder+mute+evidence&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RP5VBDAaBD&amp;sig=h0mUqyjTGegHzsd2TD8zApsR2Ig&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SiAGU7zsEtKy7Aa5jYCgBA&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=hodder%20mute%20evidence&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tipaldo 2014 42"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.mulino.it/isbn/9788815248329|title=L'analisi del contenuto e i mass media|last=Tipaldo|first=G.|publisher=Il Mulino|year=2014|isbn=978-88-15-24832-9|location=Bologna, IT|pages=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; By systematically labeling the content of a set of [[text (literary theory)|texts]], researchers can analyse patterns of content [[Quantitative research|quantitatively]] using [[Statistics|statistical methods]], or use [[Qualitative research|qualitative]] methods to analyse meanings of content within [[text (literary theory)|texts]].

Computers are increasingly used in content analysis to automate the labeling (or coding) of documents. Simple computational techniques can provide descriptive data such as word frequencies and document lengths. [[Machine learning]] classifiers can greatly increase the number of texts that can be labeled, but the scientific utility of doing so is a matter of debate.

== Goals ==

Content analysis is best understood as a broad family of techniques. Effective researchers choose techniques that best help them answer their substantive questions. That said, according to [[Klaus Krippendorff]], six questions must be addressed in every content analysis:&lt;ref name="Krippendorff2004"/&gt;

#Which data are analyzed?
#How are the data defined?
#From what population are data drawn?
#What is the relevant context?
#What are the boundaries of the analysis?
#What is to be measured?

The simplest and most objective form of content analysis considers unambiguous characteristics of the text such as [[word frequencies]], the page area taken by a newspaper column, or the duration of a [[radio]] or [[television]] program. Analysis of simple word frequencies is limited because the meaning of a word depends on surrounding text.  [[Key Word in Context|Keyword In Context]] routines address this by placing words in their textual context. This helps resolve ambiguities such as those introduced by [[synonym]]s and [[homonym]]s.

A further step in analysis is the distinction between dictionary-based (quantitative) approaches and qualitative approaches. Dictionary-based approaches set up a list of categories derived from the frequency list of words and control the distribution of words and their respective categories over the texts. While methods in quantitative content analysis in this way transform observations of found categories into quantitative statistical data, the qualitative content analysis focuses more on the intentionality and its implications. There are strong parallels between qualitative content analysis and [[thematic analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaismoradi|first=Mojtaba|last2=Turunen|first2=Hannele|last3=Bondas|first3=Terese|date=2013-09-01|title=Content analysis and thematic analysis: Implications for conducting a qualitative descriptive study|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nhs.12048/abstract|journal=Nursing &amp; Health Sciences|language=en|volume=15|issue=3|pages=398–405|doi=10.1111/nhs.12048|issn=1442-2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Computational tools ==

More generally, content analysis is research using the categorization and classification of speech, written text, interviews, images, or other forms of communication.  In its beginnings, using the first newspapers at the end of the 19th century, analysis was done manually by measuring the number of lines and amount of space given a subject. With the rise of common computing facilities like PCs, computer-based methods of analysis are growing in popularity. Answers to open ended questions, newspaper articles, political party manifestos, medical records or systematic observations in experiments can all be subject to systematic analysis of textual data.

By having contents of communication available in form of machine readable texts, the input is analyzed for frequencies and coded into categories for building up inferences.

==Reliability ==
Robert Weber notes: "To make valid inferences from the text, it is important that the classification procedure be reliable in the sense of being consistent: Different people should code the same text in the same way".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weber|first=Robert Philip|title=Basic Content Analysis|year=1990|publisher=Sage|location=Newbury Park, CA|isbn=9780803938632|page=12|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; The validity, inter-coder reliability and intra-coder reliability are subject to intense methodological research efforts over long years.&lt;ref name="Krippendorff2004" /&gt;
Neuendorf suggests that when human coders are used in content analysis two coders should be used. Reliability of human coding is often measured using a statistical measure of ''inter-coder reliability'' or "the amount of agreement or correspondence among two or more coders".&lt;ref name=Neuendorf2002&gt;{{cite book|last=Neuendorf|first=Kimberly A.|title=The Content Analysis Guidebook|year=2002|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|pages=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lacy and Riffe identify the measurement of inter-coder reliability as a strength of quantitative content analysis, arguing that, if content analysts do not measure inter-coder reliability, their data are no more reliable than the subjective impressions of a single reader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lacy|first=Stephen R|last2=Riffe|first2=Daniel|date=1993|title=Sins of Omission and Commission in Mass Communication Quantitative Research|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/107769909307000114|journal=Journalism &amp; Mass Communication Quarterly|volume=70|issue=1|pages=126-132|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kinds of text ===

There are five types of texts in content analysis:
# [[written text]], such as books and papers 
# oral text, such as speech and theatrical performance
# [[iconic text]], such as drawings, paintings, and icons 
# audio-visual text, such as TV programs, movies, and videos
# [[hypertext]]s, which are texts found on the Internet

=== History ===
Over the years, content analysis has been applied to a variety of scopes. [[Hermeneutics]] and [[philology]] have long used content analysis to interpret sacred and profane texts and, in many cases, to attribute texts' [[authorship]] and [[authentication|authenticity]].&lt;ref name="Tipaldo 2014 42"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Krippendorff2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Krippendorff|first=Klaus|title=Content Analysis: An Introduction to Its Methodology|year=2004|publisher=Sage|location=Thousand Oaks, CA|isbn=9780761915454|pages=413|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Content_Analysis.html?id=q657o3M3C8cC|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent times, particularly with the advent of [[mass communication]], content analysis has known an increasing use to deeply analyze and understand media content and [[media logic]]. 
The political scientist [[Harold Lasswell]] formulated the core questions of content analysis in its early-mid 20th-century mainstream version: "Who says what, to whom, why, to what extent and with what effect?".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lasswell|first=Harold Dwight|title=Power and Personality|year=1948|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong emphasis for a quantitative approach started up by Lasswell was finally carried out by another "father" of content analysis, [[Bernard Berelson]], who proposed a definition of content analysis which, from this point of view, is emblematic: "a research technique for the objective, systematic and quantitative description of the manifest content of communication".&lt;ref name="Berelson1952"&gt;{{cite book|last=Berelson| first=B.|title=Content Analysis in Communication Research|year=1952|publisher=Free Press|location=Glencoe|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quantitative content analysis has enjoyed a renewed popularity in recent years thanks to technological advances and fruitful application in of mass communication and personal communication research. Content analysis of textual [[big data]] produced by [[new media]], particularly [[social media]] and [[mobile devices]] has become popular. These approaches take a simplified view of language that ignores the complexity of semiosis, the process by which meaning is formed out of language. Quantitative content analysts have been criticized for limiting the scope of content analysis to simple counting, and for applying the measurement methodologies of the natural sciences without reflecting critically on their appropriateness to social science.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Content Analysis: An Introduction to Its Methodology|last=Krippendorff|first=Klaus|publisher=Sage|year=2004|isbn=0-7619-1544-3|location=California|pages=87-89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, qualitative content analysts have been criticized for being insufficiently systematic and too impressionistic.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Krippendorff argues that quantitative and qualitative approaches to content analysis tend to overlap, and that there can be no generalisable conclusion as to which approach is superior.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Recently, Arash Heydarian Pashakhanlou has argued for a combination of quantitative, qualitative, manual and computer-assisted in a single study to offset the weaknesses of a partial content analysis and enhance the reliability and validity of a research project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heydarian Pashakhanlou|first=Arash|date=2017|title=Fully integrated content analysis in international relations|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/metrics/10.1177/0047117817723060|journal=International Relations|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Content analysis can also be described as studying [[Trace evidence|traces]], which are documents from past times, and artifacts, which are non-linguistic documents. Texts are understood to be produced by communication processes in a broad sense of that phrase—often gaining mean through [[Abductive reasoning|abduction]].&lt;ref name="Tipaldo 2014 42"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Timmermans|first=Stefan and Iddo Tavory|date=2012|title=Theory Construction in Qualitative Research: From Grounded Theory to Abductive Analysis|url=|journal=Sociological Theory|edition=30(3)|pages=167–186|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Holsti groups fifteen uses of content analysis into three basic [[Categorisation|categories]]:&lt;ref name=Holsti1969&gt;{{cite book|last=Holsti|first=Ole R.|title=Content Analysis for the Social Sciences and Humanities|year=1969|publisher=Addison-Wesley|location=Reading, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* make [[inference]]s about the antecedents of a [[communication]]
*describe and make inferences about characteristics of a communication
*make inferences about the [[Causality|effects]] of a communication.
He also places these uses into the context of the basic communication [[paradigm]].

The following table shows fifteen uses of content analysis in terms of their general purpose, element of the communication paradigm to which they apply, and the general question they are intended to answer.

[[File:David Hartman.800x711.jpg|thumb|200px|David Hartman]]

'''David Hartman''' (September 11, 1931&amp;nbsp;– February 10, 2013) was an [[Americans|American]]-[[Israelis|Israeli]] leader and [[philosopher]] of contemporary [[Judaism]], founder of the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]] in [[Jerusalem]], [[Israel]], and a [[Jewish]] author.

==Biography==
David Hartman was born in the [[Brownsville, Brooklyn|Brownsville]] section of [[Brooklyn, New York]]. He attended [[Yeshiva Chaim Berlin]] and the [[Lubavitch]] [[Tomchei Temimim#Today|Yeshiva]], after which he spent time learning in Lakewood Yeshiva. In 1953, having studied under Rabbi [[Joseph B. Soloveitchik]], he received his rabbinical ordination from [[Yeshiva University]] in New York. He continued his studies with Rabbi Soloveitchik until 1960, while pursuing a graduate degree in [[philosophy]] with Robert C. Pollock at [[Fordham University]]. In 1971, Hartman [[aliyah|immigrated]] to Israel with his wife Barbara and their five children.

Rabbi Hartman died on February 10, 2013 in Jerusalem at the age of 81.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-4343247,00.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After serving as a congregational rabbi in [[the Bronx]], New York, from 1955–1960, Hartman became the Rabbi of Congregation Tiferet Beit David Jerusalem in [[Montreal]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tbdj.org/about-us/history/ Tifereth Beit David Jerusalem website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120709184628/http://tbdj.org/about-us/history/ |date=July 9, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of his students moved with him to [[Israel]] when he immigrated in 1971. While in Montreal, he also taught and studied at [[McGill University]] and received his [[Ph.D.]] in philosophy.
Rabbi Hartman founded the [[Shalom Hartman Institute]] in Jerusalem in 1976. He was named founding president in 2009, when his son, [[Donniel Hartman]], was named president.{{cn|date=May 2014}} In addition to the institute, he founded the [[Hartman High School|Charles E. Smith High School]], which operates separate programs for boys and girls, the latter of which is named [[Midrashiya]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hartman.org.il/Programs_View.asp?Program_Id=12&amp;Cat_Id=302&amp;Cat_Type=Programs  Hartman Institute website, Feb. 17, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; in central Jerusalem.
Rabbi Hartman was a Professor of Jewish Thought at [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], for over two decades, during which time he was also a visiting Professor of Jewish Thought at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1986/1987 and at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] in 1997/1998.{{cn|date=May 2014}}

==Thoughts and assessments==
Rabbi Hartman viewed his [[aliyah|immigration]] to Israel as an essential part of his mission to encourage greater understanding between Jews of diverse affiliations—both in Israel and the [[Jewish diaspora]]—and to build a more pluralistic and tolerant Israeli society.
His work emphasized the centrality of the rebirth of the State of Israel and  religious pluralism, both among Jews and in [[interfaith]] relations. As his views often aligned with [[Conservative Judaism]], some have asked whether he should have been or his writings continue to be considered Orthodox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Shapiro |first=Samantha M. |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2182351/ |title=Why an Orthodox institute's decision to ordain female rabbis isn't as revolutionary as it sounds. – By Samantha M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14131">'''[[Distributed ledger]] technology law''' ("'''DLT law'''") (also called '''[[Blockchain]] law'''.&lt;ref&gt;James G. Gatto, 'United States: Nevada Passes Pro-blockchain Law' (Mondaq, 23 June 2017) &lt;http://www.mondaq.com/unitedstates/x/604562/fin+tech/Nevada+Passes+Problockchain+Law&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Lex Cryptographia'''&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Aaron Wright and Primavera De Filippi, 'Decentralized Blockchain Technology and the Rise of Lex Cryptographia' (2015) SSRN Electronic Journal &lt;http://www.ssrn.com/abstract=2580664&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;) is not yet defined and recognized but an emerging field of law due to the recent dissemination of distributed ledger technology application in business and governance environment.

== Analogy with the [[Law of the Horse]] and [[Legal aspects of computing|Law of cyberspace]] debate ==

Ubiquitous dissemination of [[information technology]] and the [[Internet]] led to a discussion of two opposite legal theories of the regulation of [[cyberspace]]. According to The [[Law of the Horse]] theory proposed by [[Frank H. Easterbrook]], general principles of law governing property, transactions and torts apply to any relationship whether in case of the horse or cyberspace and there is no reason to invent new fields of law designated for each.&lt;ref&gt;Frank Easterbrook, 'Cyberspace and the law of the horse' (1996) U Chi Legal F 207 &lt;https://www.law.upenn.edu/fac/pwagner/law619/f2001/week15/easterbrook.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory was challenged by [[Lawrence Lessig]], who argued that in case of cyberspace the code may be considered as another way of regulation and therefore the cyberspace may be treated more widely than just another area of relations regulated by conventional legal principles.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig, 'The Law of the Horse: What Cyberlaw Might Teach' (1999) 113 Harv L Rev 501 &lt;https://cyber.harvard.edu/works/lessig/finalhls.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; Employing more liberal approach the DLT law may mean the body of law "characterized by a set of rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (and potentially autonomous) organizations".&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

== Areas of law ==

As of the beginning of 2018 the DLT law does not constitute a separate field of law rather it encompasses aspects of corporate, contract, investment, banking and finance law. According to conservative approach the DLT law may be considered as a part of existent area of law, which may be applied to regulate different aspects of DLT use and new kind of legal relations on blockchain, such as issue of authorisation (electronic signature), admissibility of blockchain evidence in court, status of [[cryptocurrency]] and regulation of [[initial coin offering]], use of [[smart contract]]s, status of [[The DAO (organization)|DAO]] (decentralized autonomous organization) and other.

== Status of blockchain-based records and smart contracts ==

While in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/search|title=UK Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[European Union|EU]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://europa.eu/european-union/law/find-legislation_en|title=EU Find legislation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the beginning of 2018 the legislators are still silent about blockchain technology, in the [[United States]] several states already enacted legislation providing a framework for business and legal application of blockchain technology and enforceability of smart contracts.

=== [[Vermont]] ===
On 2 June 2016 Vermont became the first state, which recognised blockchain-based records having legal bearing in a court under the Vermont Rules of Evidence and defined blockchain technology as "mathematically secured, chronological, and decentralized consensus ledger or database, whether maintained via Internet interaction, peer-to-peer network, or otherwise"&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 868 &lt;https://legislature.vermont.gov/assets/Documents/2016/Docs/ACTS/ACT157/ACT157%20As%20Enacted.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Arizona]] ===
In March 2017, Arizona’s Electronic Transactions Act (the AETA) was amended by HB 2417 Act to clarify that “electronic records, electronic signatures, and smart contract terms secured through blockchain technology and governed under UCC Articles 2, 2A and 7 will be considered to be in an electronic form and to be an electronic signature under AETA.”&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Neuburger, 'Arizona Passes Groundbreaking Blockchain and Smart Contract Law – State Blockchain Laws on the Rise' (Proscauer, 20 April 20, 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/04/20/arizona-passes-groundbreaking-blockchain-and-smart-contract-law-state-blockchain-laws-on-the-rise/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; HB 2417 Act also provides a definition of blockchain technology as a “distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger, which may be public or private, permissioned or permissionless, or driven by tokenized crypto economics or tokenless”&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; and definition of smart contract as "event driven program, with state, that runs on a distributed, decentralized, shared and replicated ledger that can take custody over and instruct transfer of assets on that ledger".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;House Bill 2417 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2417/id/1588180/Arizona-2017-HB2417-Chaptered.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

The State also identifies areas where blockchain technology should not be used. For instance, the new law adopted in 2017 prohibits the use of blockchain technology to locate or control firearms.&lt;ref&gt;Craig de Ridder, Mercedes Tunstall, Nathalie Prescott, 'Recognition of smart contracts in the United States' (2017) Intellectual Property and Technology Law Journal Vol 29 No 11.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;House Bill 2216 &lt;https://legiscan.com/AZ/text/HB2216/2017&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Nevada]] ===
In June 2017 similar legislation has been enacted in Nevada.&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Senators Unanimously Advance Blockchain Tax Ban' (Coindesk, 26 April 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-senators-blockchain-tax-ban/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, "Nevada has become the first state to ban local governments from taxing blockchain use".&lt;ref&gt;Stan Higgins, 'Nevada Becomes First US State to Ban Blockchain Taxes' (Coindesk, 06 June 2017) &lt;https://www.coindesk.com/nevada-first-us-state-ban-blockchain-taxes/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to the definition of blockchain, the Nevada Senate defines it as "an electronic record created by the use of a decentralized method by multiple parties to verify and store a digital record of transactions which is secured by the use of a cryptographic hash of previous transaction information".&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No 389 &lt;https://www.leg.state.nv.us/Session/79th2017/Bills/SB/SB398.pdf&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== [[Delaware]] ===
On August 1, 2017, Delaware's blockchain law became effective, which amends the Delaware General Corporation Law explicitly permitting the use of distributed ledger technology in the administration of Delaware corporate records, including records of stock and stockholders.&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Dodge, 'Delaware Authorizes Stocks on Blockchain' (Proskauer, 02 August 2017) &lt;https://newmedialaw.proskauer.com/2017/08/02/delaware-authorizes-stocks-on-blockchain/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Senate Bill No. 60 &lt;https://legiscan.com/DE/text/SB69/id/1627743/Delaware-2017-SB69-Draft.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Before this new law was adopted, there was nothing specifically stopping a Delaware corporation from using blockchain technology to keep track of its stockholders, but there was also a great deal of regulatory uncertainty."&lt;ref&gt;Cindy Dole and Doneld Shelkey 'Delaware Blockchain Law Goes into Effect' (Morgan Lewis, 11 August 2017) &lt;https://www.morganlewis.com/blogs/sourcingatmorganlewis/2017/08/delaware-blockchain-law-goes-into-effect&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

== DLT and law issues ==

=== Issue of [[Situs (law)|situs]] and place for [[dispute resolution]] ===
In the legal context DLT and smart contracts are distinct and face their own problems and challenges. Issue of situs is an example which relates to DLT rather than smart contracts.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Linklaters and ISDA, ‘Smart Contracts and Distributed Ledger – A Legal Perspective’ (2017) &lt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.isda.org/a/6EKDE/smart-contracts-and-distributed-ledger-a-legal-perspective.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; International private law and legislation of various jurisdictions require to identify the location of an asset or place of an agreement in order to solve conflict of law problem and determine the applicable governing law. "However, the distribution of the register across nodes in multiple jurisdictions raises a seemingly intractable problem – under current legal principles at least – as to where the situs should be."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Holding something on DLT, including smart contract or title to an asset, does not isolate it from the legal system and laws of respective jurisdiction. "Some blockchain enthusiasts may have misinterpreted the statement ‘code is law’ as implying that code can supersede the law or that decentralised networks create their own legal regimes."&lt;ref&gt;Eliza Mik, ‘Smart contracts: terminology, technical limitations and real world complexity” (2017) Law Innovation and Technology Vol 9 No 2, 269.&lt;/ref&gt;

In case of a dispute between the parties of the smart contract within the DLT, the issue arises where the distributed ledger is located in order to determine the place for dispute resolution.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Reggie O'Shields, 'Smart Contracts: Legal Agreements for the Blockchain' (2017) North Carolina Banking Institute Vol 21, 177.&lt;/ref&gt; "Blockchain also poses questions concerning the ability to identify the parties to a transaction, to the extent a system utilizing this technology remains anonymous, which may rise a host of additional issues related to dispute resolution."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Issue of legal validity and update of code on DLT ===
An absence of legal [[Regulatory compliance|compliance]] mechanism on DLT, [[Smart contract|self-executing]] nature of code on DLT and [[Blockchain|limited ability]] to update the code if the law changes create a number of legal issues. There are several  possible solutions of addressing these issues. "One method could be a system in which the relevant jurisdiction creates a publicly available database and [[Application Programming Interface (API)|application programming interface (API)]] of relevant legal provisions. These would be provisions related to the terms of the contract. The smart contract would call these terms and would be able to update those provisions terms in accord with the jurisdiction's update of the database."&lt;ref&gt;Max Raskin, ‘The Law and Legality of Smart Contracts’ (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 305.&lt;/ref&gt;

On more conservative side of DLT and law interaction spectrum are two solutions proposed by [https://www.hse.ru/en/org/persons/57906411 Alexander Savelyev]:

"(1) To introduce the concept of a ‘Superuser’ for government authorities, which will have a right to modify the content of Blockchain databases in accordance with a specified procedure in order to reflect the decisions of state authority.

(2) To enforce decisions of state authorities in ‘offline’ mode by pursuing the specific users and forcing them to include changes in Blockchain themselves as well as by using traditional tort claims, unjust enrichment claims, and specific performance claims."&lt;ref&gt;Alexander Savelyev, 'Contract law 2.0: ‘Smart’ contracts as the beginning of the end of classic contract law' (2017)  Information &amp; Communications Technology Law Vol 26 No 2, 116.&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Issue of [[automation]] of smart contracts and 'Oracles'  ===
Subject to ability of distributed ledger to have access to terms and conditions by which performance of obligations under the smart contract must be assessed the execution of contracts on distributed ledger may be automated.&lt;ref&gt;Stefan Thomas and Evan Schwartz, 'Smart Oracles: A Simple, Powerful Approach to Smart Contracts' (Github, 17 July 2014) &lt;https://github.com/codius/codius/wiki/Smart-Oracles:-A-Simple,-Powerful-Approach-to-Smart-Contracts&gt; accessed on 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; "In the [[interest rate swap]] example, the distributed ledger must have access to assets of the parties' in order to fulfil the parties' payment obligations, and it must have access to a provider of interest rate information."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Jenny Cieplak and Simon Leefatt, 'Smart contracts: A smart way to automate performance' (2017) 1 Geo L Tech Rev 417.&lt;/ref&gt; The solutions to the issue of access to assets vary and may be solved through locking and release of assets in smart contract as it is performed through use of cryptocurrency Ether on [[Ethereum]] blockchain&lt;ref&gt;Vitalik Buterin, 'Ethereum: A Next-Generation Cryptocurrency and Decentralized Application Platform' (BitcoinMagazine, 23 January 2014) &lt;https://bitcoinmagazine.com/articles/ethereum-next-generation-cryptocurrency-decentralized-application-platform-1390528211/&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; or by introducing new mechanism of access to assets like 'cash states' proposed by [[R3 (company)|Corda]] distributed ledger.&lt;ref&gt;Mike Hearn, 'Corda: A distributed ledger' (2016) &lt;https://docs.corda.net/_static/corda-technical-whitepaper.pdf&gt; accessed 14 February 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time the solution to the issue of access to information may require use of so-called 'Oracles' - an external parties providing the judgement to determine whether or not respective conditions under the agreement have been met.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; "Turning again to the interest rate swap example, an oracle could be used to provide interest rate information on a payment calculation date. The oracle's digital signature would be retained on the distributed ledger so that parties could review the payment process and confirm that payments were made correctly."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Donald Mackenzie MacKinnon''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|FBA|FRSE}} (27 August 1913 – 2 March 1994) was a Scottish philosopher and theologian.

==Life==

He was born in [[Oban]] on 27 August 1913, the son of Donald M. MacKinnon, [[Procurator Fiscal]] and his wife, Grace Isabella Rhynd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at [[Cargilfield Preparatory School]] in [[Edinburgh]] then [[Winchester College]] in [[Hampshire]]. He then studied Divinty at [[New College, Oxford]] graduating MA in 1935. From 1940 he began tutoring at [[Oxford University]] becoming a lecturer in Philosophy in 1945. In 1947 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy in the [[University of Aberdeen]] and in 1960 became the Norris-Hulse Professor of Divinity in the [[University of Cambridge]] retiring in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/obits_alpha/mackinnon_donald.pdf Biography at Royal Society of Edinburgh homepage&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon delivered the [[Gifford Lectures]] in 1965 and 1966 on ‘The Problem of Metaphysics’. A revised version of the lectures was published under the same name in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPPMET&amp;Cover=TRUE Gifford lectures page for Mackinnon, retrieved 6 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

He was President of the Aristotelian Society 1976/77 and President for the Society for the Study of Theology 1981/82. In 1984 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. His proposers were [[Thomas F. Torrance]], J. MacIntosh, G, Donaldson, [[David Daiches]], G. W. Anderson, [[Thomas Smith (barrister)|Sir Thomas Broun Smith]], Rev [[Ronnie Selby Wright]] and G. P. Henderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a Scottish Episcopalian.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituary-professor-donald-mackinnon-1427917.html Independent obituary, retrieved 6 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

He died in [[Aberdeen]] on 2 March 1994.

==Family==

In 1939 he married Lois Dryer.

==Views==

MacKinnon is noted for his contributions to [[philosophical theology]]. He is particularly noted for the depth of analysis he applied to intractable theological problems, not least the refusal to simplify difficult questions in order to produce tidy or conclusive answers. His insistence on truth over tidiness is evident in his method of thought, an approach which some have labelled ‘open-textured’.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hardy, 'Theology through philosophically mediated life' in [[David F. Ford|David Ford]], ed., ''The Modern Theologians'' (1997), p272.&lt;/ref&gt; The label derives from MacKinnon's use of literary, artistic, and political sources in his work - modes of enquiry which operate in contrast to the systematic and epistemologically narrow approach of some theology and philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel Hardy, ‘Theology through philosophically mediated life' in [[David F. Ford|David Ford]], ed., ''The Modern Theologians'' (1997), p276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intensity of MacKinnon's thought was matched by his lecturing style, which was marked by 'his dangerously strong charisma, his ability to terrify adversaries'.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theo Hobson]],  ''Anarchy, Church and Utopia'' (2005), p14.&lt;/ref&gt; Some former students admit to 'spending more time mimicking him than following his arguments about Kant or Hegel'.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Shortt,  ''Rowan's Rule'' (2008), p61.&lt;/ref&gt; At Aberdeen he was notorious among the students for talking to the ivy on the walls of King's College. {{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} Former students [[Iris Murdoch]], [[Philippa Foot]] and [[Rowan Williams]] expressed deep indebtedness and admiration for his input into their intellectual development.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Conradi, ''Iris Murdoch: A life'' (2002), p. 123; Alex Voorhoeve, 'The Grammar of Goodness', in ''Conversations on Ethics'' (2009), p. 92; Rupert Shortt, ''Rowan's Rule'' (2008), p. 63; &lt;/ref&gt; His influential input into important and relatively widely read thinkers' work, such as Williams and Murdoch, would suggest that MacKinnon’s contribution to theology and philosophy is most strongly felt through the subsequent work of his students.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fergus Kerr]], editorial, ''New Blackfriars'', May 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, MacKinnon did not publish extensively, and that which he did publish is largely in short essay form and out of print.

===Realism and anti-realism===
MacKinnon often used a broadly Kantian metaphysics to determine the limits of a person's knowledge of God.&lt;ref&gt;see his ''The Problem of Metaphysics'' (1974), passim, and ''Themes in Theology'' (1987), part A.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, there is a [[Immanuel Kant#Idea of God|close relationship between God and ethics]] in MacKinnon’s work. But MacKinnon veers away from concluding that Kant collapsed God into ethics. Nor does he accept - the further conclusion that sometimes follows this - that Kant's epistemology precludes metaphysical realism, i.e. necessitates [[anti-realism]], in ethics and theology.&lt;ref&gt;see [[Don Cupitt]], ''The Sea of Faith'' (1984), pp136-140, for an example of these sort of deductions.&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Problem of Metaphysics'' (1974) MacKinnon develops a Kantian epistemology and comes close to an agnostic position on God, except for the proviso that ethical decision-making has the capacity to make agents aware of a kind of metaphysical realism. He goes on to argue that it is in keeping with a Kantian metaphysics to deduce God from this sense of awareness: 'Kant [is] in the end a theist....His God does not enter into the texture of his exposition....he lies altogether beyond the frontiers of intelligible referential and descriptive statement. [But] we are all the time thrust outside those frontiers, precipitated beyond them by a moral experience on whose formal unity, in the most diverse human situations, Kant insists.'&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKinnon, ''The Problem of Metaphysics'' (1974), p57.&lt;/ref&gt; MacKinnon is, in this respect, against interpreters of Kant who consider his epistemology to have anti-realist conclusions. He is also quite specifically against the view that an anti-realist theology needs to be developed as renewed approach to Christian thought, e.g. the approach developed by [[Don Cupitt]].&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKinnon, ''The Problem of Metaphysics'' (1974), p43-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tragedy - construed as an ethical construct - plays an important part in the awareness of metaphysical realism. MacKinnon illustrates this with examples of tragedy from Shakespeare, Greek thought, and Jesus’ parables, and concludes that ‘[i]t is as if we are constrained in pondering the extremities of human life to acknowledge the transcendent as the only alternative to the kind of trivialisation which would empty of significance the sorts of [tragic] experience with which we have been concerned’.&lt;ref&gt;Donald MacKinnon, ''The Problem of Metaphysics'' (1974), p145.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Drongen Abbey''', or the '''Old Abbey, Drongen''' ({{lang-nl|Abdij van Drongen, Oude Abdij van Drongen}}), is a monastic complex on the River [[Leie]] in [[Drongen]], a part of the city of [[Ghent]] in [[East Flanders]], [[Belgium]].

Formerly a [[Premonstratensian]] [[abbey]], since 1837 the premises have belonged to the [[Jesuits]]. In 1998 the whole property, including the garden, was declared a protected monument.

==History==
===Early days===
In the Middle Ages there were two legends regarding the abbey's foundation in the 7th century. According to one, the abbey was built by a certain Basinus, king of Basotes; according to the other, its founder was Saint [[Amandus]], who also founded in Ghent during the same period [[St. Peter's Abbey, Ghent|St. Peter's Abbey]] and [[St.Bavo's Abbey, Ghent|St. Bavo's Abbey]]. The first occupants were [[secular canon]]s. The [[Normans]] destroyed the abbey in 853 but under [[Baldwin II, Count of Flanders]] (879–918), lord of Drongen, it was rebuilt.&lt;ref name="KUL"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kadoc.kuleuven.be/publicaties/diversen/diversen43|title=De Oude Abdij van Drongen|publisher=KU Leuven|language=Dutch|accessdate=9 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Premonstratensians===
In 1136 Iwein, Count of [[Aalst, Belgium|Aalst]], lord of [[Waasland|Waas]], Drongen and [[Liedekerke]], founded a [[Premonstratensian]] abbey at Salegem ([[Vrasene]], [[Beveren]]). Two years later, in 1138, the new abbey was moved to Drongen, when the canons accepted the Premonstratensian rules.&lt;ref name="KUL" /&gt;

In 1566 the abbey suffered from the ''[[Beeldenstorm]]er'' (Iconoclasts), and in 1578, during the Ghent Republic, the [[Calvinists]] drove out the fathers, who took refuge in the ''Hof van Drongen'', and destroyed the abbey. Its possessions fell into the hands of [[William the Silent]], but were given back by his heirs.

The abbey church was rebuilt in 1638, and the monastic buildings between 1638 and 1698, leaving the abbey much the same as it is now.

In 1796, during the [[French Revolution]], the fathers were again driven out, and the abbey suppressed and sold off. [[Lieven Bauwens]] installed a cotton mill, which went bankrupt in 1836, and a dyeworks using [[madder]] root.&lt;ref name="KUL" /&gt;

===Jesuits===
In 1836 the [[Jesuits]] bought part of the abbey buildings for the use of their novices, and in 1848 they bought the remainder of the property. The training continued until 1968, when it stopped for want of vocations, but they continued to provide meditations and retreats, for individuals and groups, and thus the abbey became a retreat centre. Older Jesuits continued to live there, and the abbey also became a Jesuit retirement home.&lt;ref name="KUL" /&gt;

The octagonal abbey church in white stone, with a small cupola, was rebuilt in 1734 after a fire. Known as St. Gerolf's Church, it now serves as the parish church of the centre of Drongen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22322">'''Eyewitness testimony''' is the account a bystander or victim gives in the courtroom, describing what that person observed that occurred during the specific incident under investigation. Ideally this recollection of events is detailed; however, this is not always the case. This recollection is used as evidence to show what happened from a witness' point of view.  Memory recall has been considered a credible source in the past, but has recently come under attack as forensics can now support psychologists in their claim that memories and individual perceptions can be unreliable, manipulated, and biased. Due to this, many countries and states within the US are now attempting to make changes in how eyewitness testimony is presented in court. Eyewitness testimony is a specialized focus within [[cognitive psychology]].

==Reliability==
Psychologists have probed the reliability of eyewitness testimony since the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="wells"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Wells |first1= G. L. |last2= Memon |first2= A. |last3= Penrod |first3= S. D. |year= 2006 |title= Eyewitness Evidence: Improving Its Probative Value |journal= Psychological Science in the Public Interest |volume= 7 |page= 48 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One prominent pioneer was [[Hugo Münsterberg]], whose controversial book ''On the Witness Stand'' (1908) demonstrated the fallibility of eyewitness accounts, but met with fierce criticism, particularly in legal circles.&lt;ref name = "Mberg legacy"&gt;{{Cite journal |last1= Memon |first1= A. |last2= Mastroberardino |first2= S. |last3= Fraser |first3= J. |year= 2008 |title= Münsterberg's Legacy: What Does Eyewitness Research Tell Us About the Reliability of Eyewitness Testimony? |journal= Applied Cognitive Psychology |volume= 22 |pages= 841–851 |doi= 10.1002/acp.1487 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas did, however, gain popularity with the public.&lt;ref&gt;Greenwood, John D. (2009). "A Conceptual History of Psychology". New York: McGraw-Hill Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, DNA testing would clear individuals convicted on the basis of errant eyewitness testimony. Studies by Scheck, Neufel, and Dwyer showed that many  DNA-based exonerations involved eyewitness evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Scheck, B., Neufeld, P., &amp; Dwyer, J. (2000). ''Actual Innocence''. New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1970s and '80s, Bob Buckhout showed inter alia that eyewitness conditions can, at least within ethical and other constraints, be simulated on university campuses,&lt;ref name = "Mberg legacy" /&gt; and that large numbers of people can be mistaken: "Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong" was the title of one paper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Buckhout |first= R. |year= 1980 |title= 
 Nearly 2,000 witnesses can be wrong |journal= Bulletin of the Psychonomic Society |volume= 16 |issue= 4 |pages= 307–310 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanisms by which flaws enter eyewitness testimony are varied and can be quite subtle.

One way is a person's memory being influenced by things seen or heard after the crime occurred. This distortion is known as the post-event [[misinformation effect]] (Loftus and Palmer, 1974). After a crime occurs and an eyewitness comes forward, law enforcement tries to gather as much information as they can to avoid the influence that may come from the environment, such as the media. Many times when the crime is surrounded by much publicity, an eyewitness may experience source [[Misattribution of memory | misattribution]]. Source misattribution occurs when a witness is incorrect about where or when they have the memory from. If a witness cannot correctly identify the source of their retrieved memory, the witness is seen as not reliable.

While some witnesses see the entirety of a crime happen in front of them, some witness only part of a crime. These witnesses are more likely to experience [[confirmation bias]]. Witness expectations are to blame for the distortion that may come from confirmation bias. For example, Lindholm and Christianson (1998) found that witnesses of a mock crime who did not witness the whole crime, nevertheless testified to what they expected would have happened. These expectations are normally similar across individuals due to the details of the environment.

Evaluating the credibility of eye-witness testimony falls on all individual jurors when such evidence is offered as testimony in a trial in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Tversky, Barbara and Fisher, George. (1999). "The Problem with Eyewitness Testimony". Stanford:Stanford Journal of Legal Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research has shown that mock juries are often unable to distinguish between a false and accurate eyewitness testimony. "Jurors" often appear to correlate the confidence level of the witness with the accuracy of their testimony. An overview of this research by Laub and Bornstein shows this to be an inaccurate gauge of accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;
Laub, Cindy, &amp; Bornstein, Brian H. (2008) "Juries and Eyewitnesses". Newbury Park, CA: SAGE Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
Research on eyewitness testimony looks at systematic variables or estimator variables. Estimator variables are characteristics of the witness, event, testimony, or testimony evaluators. Systematic variables are variables that are, or have the possibility of, being controlled by the criminal justice system. Both sets of variables can be manipulated and studied during research, but only system variables can be controlled in actual procedure.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;

===Estimator variables===

====Age of Witness====
Among children, suggestibility can be very high. Suggestibility is the term used when a witness accepts information after the actual event and incorporates it into the memory of the event itself.  Children's developmental level (generally correlated with age) causes them to be more easily influenced by leading questions, misinformation, and other post-event details. Compared to older children, preschool-age children are more likely to fall victim to suggestions without the ability to focus solely on the facts of what happened.&lt;ref&gt;Bruck, Maggie and Stephen J Ceci. Annu. Rev. Psychol. 1999. 50:419–39 Copyright Ó 1999 by Annual Reviews. All rights reserved kj&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, a recent meta-analysis found that older adults (over age 65) tend to be more susceptible to memory distortion brought about by misleading post-event information, compared to young adults.&lt;ref&gt;Wylie, L. E., Patihis, L., McCuller, L. L., Davis, D., Brank, E. M., Loftus, E. F., &amp; Bornstein, B. H. (2014). Misinformation effects in older versus younger adults: A meta-analysis and review. In M. P. Toglia, D. F. Ross, J. Pozzulo, &amp; E. Pica (Eds) The Elderly Eyewitness in Court, UK: Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Reconstructive memory====
{{main|Reconstructive memory}}
Many of the early studies of memory demonstrated how memories can fail to be accurate records of experiences. Because jurors and judges do not have access to the original event, it is important to know whether a testimony is based on actual experience or not.&lt;ref&gt;Mori, Naohisa. Styles of remembering and types of experience: An experimental investigation of reconstructive memory. Integrative Psychological &amp; Behavioral Science, Vol 42(3), Sep, 2008. pp. 291-314.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1932 study,  [[Frederic Bartlett]] demonstrated how serial reproduction of a story distorted accuracy in recalling information. He told participants a complicated Native American story and had them repeat it over a series of intervals. With each repetition, the stories were altered. Even when participants recalled accurate information, they filled in gaps with information that would fit their personal experiences. His work showed [[long term memory]] to be adaptable.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). [https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/727e/7f158dc0839ef789e3cb99f3fc3f2e38e017.pdf Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology]. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Bartlett viewed [[schema (psychology)|schema]]s as a major cause of this occurrence. People attempt to place past events into existing representations of the world, making the memory more coherent. Instead of remembering precise details about commonplace occurrences, a schema is developed. A schema is a generalization formed mentally based on experience.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen K. Reed. (2010). Cognition. San Diego:Wadsworth CENGAGE Learning, 383.&lt;/ref&gt; The common use of these schemas suggests that memory is not an identical reproduction of experience, but a combination of actual events with already existing schemas. Bartlett summarized this issue, explaining 
{{Bq|1=&lt;!--
--&gt;[M]emory is personal, not because of some intangible and hypothetical persisting ‘self ’, which receives and maintains innumerable traces, restimulating them whenever it needs; but because the mechanism of adult human memory demands an organisation of ‘schemata’ depending upon an interplay of appetites, instincts, interests and ideas peculiar to any given subject. Thus if, as in some pathological cases, these active sources of the ‘schemata’ get cut off from one another, the peculiar personal attributes of what is remembered fail to appear.&lt;ref&gt;Bartlett, F.C. (1932). Remembering: A Study in Experimental and Social Psychology. Cambridge, England: Cambridge University Press. 213.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Further research of schemas shows memories that are inconsistent with a schema decay faster than those that match up with a schema. Tuckey and Brewer found pieces of information that were inconsistent with a typical robbery decayed much faster than those that were schema consistent over a 12-week period, unless the information stood out as being extremely unusual. The use of schemas has been shown to increase the accuracy of recall of schema-consistent information but this comes at the cost of decreased recall of schema-inconsistent information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Tuckey | first1 = Michelle Rae | last2 = Brewer | first2 = Neil | year = 2003 | title = How Schemas Affect Eyewitness Memory Over Repeated Retrieval Attempts | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 17 | issue = 7| pages = 785–800 | doi=10.1002/acp.906}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Misinformation effect====
{{main|Elizabeth Loftus|Misinformation effect}}
Elizabeth Loftus is one of the leading psychologists in the field of eyewitness testimony. She provided extensive research on this topic, revolutionizing the field with her bold stance that challenges the credibility of eyewitness testimony in court.  She suggests that memory is not reliable and goes to great lengths to provide support for her arguments. She mainly focuses on the integration of misinformation with the original memory, forming a new memory.  
Some of her most convincing experiments support this claim:
#In one of her experiments, Loftus demonstrates that false verbal Information can integrate with original memory. Participants were presented with either truthful information or misleading information, and overall it showed that even the false information verbally presented became part of the memory after the participant was asked to recall details. This happens because of one of two reasons. First, it can alter the memory, incorporating the misinformation in with the actual, true memory. Second, the original memory and new information may both reside in memory in turn creating two conflicting ideas that compete in recall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|last2=Miller|first2=David G.|last3=Burns|first3=Helen J.|title=Semantic integration of verbal information into a visual memory.|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Human Learning &amp; Memory|date=1978|volume=4|issue=1|pages=19–31|doi=10.1037/0278-7393.4.1.19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Loftus conducted more experiments to prove the reliability of expert psychological testimony versus the accepted basic eyewitness testimony. It was found that jurors who hear about a violent crime are more likely to convict a defendant than of one from a nonviolent crime. To reduce this tendency for a juror to quickly accuse, and perhaps wrongly accuse, choosing to utilize expert psychological testimony causes the juror to critically appraise the eyewitness testimony, instead of quickly reaching a faulty verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|title=Impact of expert psychological testimony on the unreliability of eyewitness identification.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1980|volume=65|issue=1|pages=9–15|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.65.1.9|pmid=7364708}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Also, it has been shown that intelligence and gender has a role in the ability of accurate memory recall.  Participants were measured in eyewitness performance in two areas: 1) the ability to resist adding misinformation to the memory and 2) accuracy of recalling the incident and person.  It showed that when a woman was recalling information about a woman, the resistance to false details was higher and the recall was more accurate.  If a man was recalling an incident involving a man, similarly the recall was more accurate.  However, when dealing with opposite genders, the participants gave into the suggestibility (misinformation) more easily and demonstrated less accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Powers|first1=Peter A.|last2=Andriks|first2=Joyce L.|last3=Loftus|first3=Elizabeth F.|title=Eyewitness accounts of females and males.|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=1979|volume=64|issue=3|pages=339–347|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.64.3.339}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#Facial recognition is a good indicator of how easily memories can be manipulated. In this specific experiment, if a misleading feature was presented, more than a third of the participants recalled that detail. With a specific detail, almost 70% of people claimed that it had been there, when it had not been present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Loftus|first1=Elizabeth F.|last2=Greene|first2=Edith|title=Warning: Even memory for faces may be contagious.|journal=Law and Human Behavior|date=1980|volume=4|issue=4|pages=323–334|doi=10.1007/BF01040624}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Systematic variables===

====Type of questioning====
As early as 1900, psychologists like [[Alfred Binet]] recorded how the phrasing of questioning during an investigation could alter witness response. Binet believed people were highly susceptible to suggestion, and called for a better approach to questioning witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Binet, Alfred.(1900) ''La Suggestibilite''&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies conducted by Crombag (1996) discovered that in an incident involving a crew attempting to return to the airport but were unable to maintain flight and crashed into an 11-story apartment building. Though no cameras caught the moment of impact on film, many news stations covered the tragedy with footage taken after impact.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/plane-crashes-into-apartment-building&lt;/ref&gt; Ten months after the event, the researchers interviewed people about the crash. According to theories about [[flashbulb memory]], the intense shock of the event should have made the memory of the event incredibly accurate. This same logic is often applied to those who witness a criminal act. To test this assumption, participants were asked questions that planted false information about the event. Fifty-five percent of subjects reported having watched the moment of impact on television, and recalled the moment the plane broke out in flames-even though it was impossible for them to have seen either of these occurrences. One researcher remarked, "[V]ery critical sense would have made our subjects realize that the implanted information could not possibly be true. We are still at a loss as to why so few of them realized this."

A survey of research on the matter confirm eyewitness testimony consistently changes over time and based on the type of questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dunning | first1 = David | last2 = Stern | first2 = Lisa Beth | year = 1992 | title = Examining the Generality of Eyewitness Hypermnesia: A Close Look at Time Delay and Question Type | url = | journal = Applied Cognitive Psychology | volume = 6 | issue = | pages = 643–657 | doi=10.1002/acp.2350060707}}&lt;/ref&gt; The approach investigators and lawyers take in their questioning has repeatedly shown to alter eyewitness response. One study showed changing certain words and phrases resulted in an increase in overall estimations of witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Libscomb, Thomas, McAllister, Hunter, &amp; Bregman, Norman. (2001). Bias in Eyewitness Accounts: The Effects of Question Format, Delay Interval, and Stimulus Presentation. ''The Journal of Psychology,'' 207-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improving eyewitness testimony==
Law enforcement, legal professions, and psychologists have worked together in attempts to make eyewitness testimony more reliable and accurate. Geiselman, Fisher, MacKinnon, and Holland saw much improvement in eyewitness memory with an interview procedure they referred to as the [[cognitive interview]]. The approach focuses on making witness aware of all events surrounding a crime without generating false memories or inventing details. In this tactic,  the interviewer builds a rapport with the witness before asking any questions.&lt;ref&gt;Ghetti, S., Goodman, G. S., Schaaf, J. M. &amp; Qin, J. (2004). Issues In Eyewitness Testimony. In W. T. O'Donohue, &amp; E. R. Levensky (Eds.), ''Handbook of Forensic Psychology'' (pp. 532). San Diego, CA: Elsevier Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt; They then allow the witness to provide an open ended account of the situation. The interviewer then asks follow up questions to clarify the witness' account, reminding the witness it is acceptable to be unsure and move on.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt; This approach guides the witness over a rigid protocol. When implemented correctly, the CI showed more accuracy and efficiency without additional incorrect information being generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Geiselman | first1 = R. | last2 = Fisher | first2 = Ronald | last3 = MacKinnon | first3 = David | last4 = Holland | first4 = Heidi | year = 1986 | title = Enhancement of eyewitness memory with the cognitive interview | url = | journal = American Journal of Psychology | volume = 99 | issue = | pages = 385–401 | doi=10.2307/1422492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, this is the U.S. Department of Justice's suggested method for law enforcement officials to use in obtaining information from witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Department of Justice, "Eyewitness Evidence: A Guide for Law Enforcement."&lt;/ref&gt; Programs training officers in this method have been developed outside the U.S. in many European countries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and Israel.&lt;ref&gt;Fisher, R.P. (2005). ''The cognitive interview: Question &amp; answers''. Ashburn, Virginia: The National Transportation Safety Board Academy. Retrieved June 13, 2006, from http://www.ntsb.gov/ Academy/courseinfo/Q&amp;A_Fisher.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

While some analysis of police interviewing technique reveals this change towards CI interviewing is not put into effect by many officials in the U.S.A. and the U.K., it is still considered to be the most effective means of decreasing error in eyewitness testimony.&lt;ref name="wells" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Memon, A., Meissner, C. A., &amp; Fraser, J. (2010). The cognitive interview: A meta-analytic review and study space analysis of the past 25 years. Psychology, Public Policy, and Law, 16[4], 340-372.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedural reforms==
Experts debate what changes need to occur in the legal process in response to research on inaccuracy of eyewitness testimony.

===Jury guidelines===
It has been suggested that the jury be given a checklist to evaluate eyewitness testimony when given in court. R. J. Shafer offers this checklist for evaluating eyewitness testimony: 
:* How well could the eyewitness observe the thing he reports? Were his senses equal to the observation? Was his physical location suitable to sight, hearing, touch? Did he have the proper social ability to observe: did he understand the language, have other expertise required (e.g., law, military)?
:*When did he report in relation to his observation? Soon? Much later?
:*Are there additional clues to intended veracity? Was he indifferent on the subject reported, thus probably not intending distortion? Did he make statements damaging to himself, thus probably not seeking to distort? Did he give incidental or casual information, almost certainly not intended to mislead?
:*Do his statements seem inherently improbable: e.g., contrary to human nature, or in conflict with what we know?
:*Remember that some types of information are easier to observe and report on than others.
:*Are there inner contradictions in the testimony? &lt;ref&gt;Garraghan, Gilbert J. (1946). A Guide to Historical Method. New York: Fordham University Press. 157-158.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Judge guidelines===
In 2011, the [[New Jersey Supreme Court]] created new rules for the admissibility of eyewitness testimony in court. The new rules require judges to explain to jurors any influences that may heighten the risk for error in the testimony. The rules are part of nationwide court reform that attempts to improve the validity of eyewitness testimony and lower the rate of false conviction.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/25/nyregion/in-new-jersey-rules-changed-on-witness-ids.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and academic career ==
Although he was born in [[Tui, Galicia|Tui]], in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]], Spain, Sanches was baptised in [[Braga]], [[Portugal]], on July 25, 1551, and spent his childhood there.&lt;ref name=Limbrick /&gt; His father was the Spaniard Antonio Sánchez, also a physician; and his mother Filipa de Sousa was Portuguese.&lt;ref&gt;Rafael V. Orden Jiménez (2012). Francisco Sánchez, el Escéptico. Breve historia de un filósofo desenfocado. Departament of Philosophy. Complutense University of Madrid. URL= http://www.larramendi.es/francisco_sanchez/i18n/cms/fichero.cmd?id=ms/francisco_sanchez/ficheros/fsanchez_estudio_fundacionlarramend.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://purl.pt/369/1/ficha-obra-francisco_sanches%20.html Francisco Sanchez (ca 1551-1623) Filósofo, matemático e médico] - [[Biblioteca Nacional de Portugal]] (in [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]])&lt;/ref&gt; Being of Jewish origin, even if converted, he was legally considered a [[New Christian]].

He studied in Braga until he was 12 years old, when he moved to [[Bordeaux]] with his parents, escaping the surveillance of the [[Portuguese Inquisition]]. There he resumed his studies at the [[College de Guyenne]]. He went on to study [[medicine]] in [[Rome]] in 1569, and, back in France, in [[Montpellier]] and [[Toulouse]]. He ended up, after 1575, as a [[professor]] of philosophy and medicine at the [[University of Toulouse]].
[[File:Maison d'Augier Ferrier.jpg|thumb|His house in [[Toulouse]]]]

== Main work and thought ==
In his ''Quod nihil scitur'' (''[[That Nothing Is Known]]''), written in 1576 and published in 1581, he used the classical skeptical arguments to show that [[science]], in the [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] sense of giving necessary reasons or causes for the behavior of nature, cannot be attained: the search for causes quickly descends into an infinite regress and so cannot give certitude. He also attacked demonstrations in the forms of syllogisms, arguing that the particular (the conclusion) is needed to have a conception of the general (the premises) and thus that syllogisms were circular and did not add to knowledge.&lt;ref name=Popkin&gt;[[Richard Popkin|Popkin, Richard H.]], ''The History of Scepticism, from Erasmus to Spinoza'', University of California Press: Berkeley, 1979, {{ISBN|0-520-03876-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Francisco Sanches.jpg|thumb|Statue of Francisco Sanches, by Salvador Barata Feyo in [[Braga]].]]
Perfect knowledge, if attainable, is the intuitive apprehension of each individual thing. But, he then argued, even his own notion of science — perfect [[knowledge]] of an individual thing — is beyond human capabilities because of the nature of objects and the nature of man. The interrelation of objects, their unlimited number, and their ever-changing character prevent their being known. The limitations and variability of man's senses restrict him to knowledge of appearances, never of real substances. In forming these last argument he drew on his experience of Medicine to show how unreliable our [[empirical evidence|sense experience]] is.&lt;ref name=Popkin/&gt;

Sanches' first conclusion was the usual fideistic one of the time, that truth can be gained by faith. His second conclusion was to play an important role in later thought: just because nothing can be known in an ultimate sense, we should not abandon all attempts at knowledge but should try to gain what knowledge we can, namely, limited, imperfect knowledge of some of those things with which we become acquainted through observation, experience, and judgment. The realization that ''nihil scitur'' ("nothing is known") thus can yield some constructive results. This early formulation of "constructive" or "mitigated" skepticism was to be developed into an important explication of the new science by [[Marin Mersenne]], [[Pierre Gassendi]], and the leaders of the [[Royal Society]].

'''Gualdrada''' was a member of the nobility in 12th century [[Florence]], [[Italy]].  She was a daughter of Bellincion Berti, &lt;ref&gt;mention made of Bellincion Berti in [[s:The Divine Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XV|The Divine Comedy/Paradiso/Canto XV - Wikisource]]. Ubertino Donato was the son-in-law to Bellincion Berti - [http://www.fullbooks.com/The-Divine-Comedy-of-Dante--Paradisex30614.html see notes] in the Divine Comedy, by Alighieri Dante: ''Paradise Canto XVI.''&lt;/ref&gt; being a descendent of the Ravignani family,  a branch of the Adimari family. 

==Biography==
[[Giovanni Boccaccio]]'s ''On Famous Women (De mulieribus claris)'' biography 103 tells her twelfth century story. During a festival in a [[Florence|Florentine]] Church of Saint John the Baptist, the [[Otto IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Holy Roman Emperor Otto IV]] came to the city and entered the church with his entourage.  From his seat he spotted Gualdrada and was impressed with her beauty.  He admired her innocence in youth, the way she dressed, and her personality. He asked an elderly gentleman that was near him, &lt;blockquote&gt;''Who, pray tell, is that girl there facing us with the beautiful face that in my opinion surpasses all the others in dignity?''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The emperor did not know that he was asking her father. Bellincion answered the emperor, saying, &lt;blockquote&gt; ''Your Majesty, whoever she may be, she will kiss you at my bidding if you desire.'' &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gualdrada overheard this and was embarrassed and wished that her father would not be so bold with his offers. She immediately replied,&lt;blockquote&gt;''Father, please stop. Speak no more. For by Heaven, unless force is used, absolutely no one except the man to whom you will give me in lawful and holy matrimony shall receive what you are offering so freely.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Emperor was both stunned and impressed by this response from Gualdrada. Learning that he was speaking to her father, he praised her in an eloquent speech to everyone of her virtue. As he was leaving the festival he summoned one of his barons, called Guido, and promoted him to a count. He then presented to Gualdrada a large dowry consisting of [[Casentino]] and a part of the territory of [[Romagna]]. Gualdrada was then given to Guido in marriage. 

From the marriage of Gualdrada and Guido came two sons, Guglielmo and Ruggieri. Ruggieri was the father of Guidoguerra, a leader of a group of four hundred Florentines of the [[Guelf]] party. They were contributory to the victory in 1265 of [[Charles of Anjou]] at [[Benevento]] over [[Manfred of Sicily]].  In 1266 Charles became [[List of monarchs of Sicily|King of Sicily]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1788">The '''Halen Estate''' (''Siedlung Halen'') is a housing development near [[Berne, Switzerland]]. It was designed and built by the [[Atelier 5]] architectural partnership from 1957 to 1961. Located in a wooded area north of the city, the development is an important example of 20th century [[Modernist architecture]] ([[Structuralism (architecture)|Structuralism]]), and as such is listed on the [[Inventory of Swiss Heritage Sites]].

==Description==
Halen Estate comprises 81 privately owned houses arranged in three terraces. Built on a hillside, the terraces are reminiscent of steps. The development, quite [[Population density|dense]], is also home to a swimming pool and other communal amenities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Weston| first = Richard| title = Plans, Sections and Elevations| publisher = [[Laurence King Publishing]]| date =2004| location = London| pages = 122&amp;ndash;123| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=3xC94YX9GLcC| isbn = 1-85669-382-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the buildings are large 3,80m and presents three different levels organized in different cases. The southern part has a ground floor with garden and one bedroom, on the mid level (looking to the common area of the main street) there is the living area, then there is the third level where again we find one bedroom and services.

An edition from 1996 hosted by [[Joan Bakewell]], ''The Heart of the Matter: God Under the Microscope'' featured a debate on science and religion and included as guests [[David Starkey]], [[Mary Warnock]], [[Wentzel van Huyssteen]], [[Richard Dawkins]], Polish Roman Catholic priest and 2008 Templeton Prize winner &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.templetonprize.org/previouswinner.html |title=The Templeton Prize – Previous Winners |publisher=Templetonprize.org |date= |accessdate=5 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; cosmologist Prof. [[Michał Heller|Michael Heller]], and [[James D.

''Heart of the Matter'' was broadcast late on Sunday evenings, usually alternating with the similarly-themed ''[[Everyman (TV series)|Everyman]]'', though the latter tended to have more of a religious focus.

'''Helen Elizabeth Longino'''&lt;ref name="Mortarboard"&gt;{{cite book|title=Mortarboard|date=1966|publisher=Barnard College|location=New York City, New York|page=118|url=https://archive.org/stream/mortarboard7219barn#page/118/mode/1up/search/Longino|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; (born July 13, 1944) is an American [[philosophy of science|philosopher of science]] who has argued for the significance of values and social interactions to [[science|scientific]] inquiry. She has written about the role of [[women in science]] and is a central figure in [[feminist epistemology]] and [[social epistemology]]. 
She is the Clarence Irving Lewis Professor of Philosophy at [[Stanford University]]. In 2016, she was elected to the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==Education==
Longino received her B.A. in English literature from [[Barnard College]] in 1966&lt;ref name="Mortarboard"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Barnard"&gt;{{cite web|title=Class of 1966|url=http://our.barnard.edu/s/1133/give2.aspx?sid=1133&amp;gid=1&amp;pgid=1866|website=Barnard College|accessdate=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bibliography"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bibliography of Alumnae Authors|url=https://archives.barnard.edu/barnard-history/alumnae-authors|website=Archives Barnard Library|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her M.A. in philosophy from the [[University of Sussex]], England, in 1967. She earned her PhD from [[Johns Hopkins University]] in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] in 1973, under the supervision of [[Peter Achinstein]]. Her dissertation dealt with ''Inference and Scientific Discovery''.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

==Career==
Longino taught at the [[University of California, San Diego]] (1973–1975), [[Mills College]] (1975–1990), [[Rice University]] (1990–1995), and the [[University of Minnesota]] (1995–2005)&lt;ref name="Meckien"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Meckien|first1=Richard|title=Helen Longino|url=http://www.iea.usp.br/en/persons/speakers/helen-longino|website=Institute of Advanced Studies of the University of São Paulo|date=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; before joining the philosophy department of [[Stanford University]].
She was active in the women's liberation movement and in establishing women's studies in several institutions.&lt;ref name="Feminist"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen Longino|url=http://www.cddc.vt.edu/feminism/Longino.html|website=Feminist Theory Website|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brown"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brown|first1=James Robert|title=Philosophy of science : the key thinkers|date=2012|publisher=Continuum|location=London|isbn=9781441142009|pages=245–249|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p2wSBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA247}}&lt;/ref&gt;
She became the Clarence Irving Lewis Professor of Philosophy in 2008 and served as chair of the philosophy department from 2008 to 2011.&lt;ref name="CV"&gt;{{cite web|title=Helen E.

==Research==
In her work, Longino discusses the social dimensions of scientific knowledge and the relations of social and cognitive values. She examines feminist and social epistemologies and their implications for scientific pluralism.&lt;ref name="Dualist"&gt;{{cite news|title=An interview with Helen Longina|url=https://www.scribd.com/document/214108407/Helen-Longino-Interview|accessdate=9 October 2016|work=The Dualist|agency=University of Minnesota Center for Philosophy of Science|date=September 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than suggesting that there is a distinctively female way of knowing, Longino emphasizes the idea of "doing epistemology as a feminist", an approach bringing with it an awareness of the many ways in which a question may be characterized.&lt;ref name="Ruitenberg"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ruitenberg|first1=Claudia W.|last2=Phillips|first2=D.C.|title=Education, culture and epistemological diversity mapping a disputed terrain|date=2012|publisher=Springer|location=Dordrecht|isbn=978-94-007-2066-4|page=62|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OhqP_HFUJgYC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Superson"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crasnow|first1=Sharon L.|last2=Superson|first2=Anita M.|title=Out from the shadows : analytical feminist contributions to traditional philosophy|date=2012|publisher=Oxford university press|location=Oxford|isbn=9780199855476|page=355|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bYP0GnlwmV4C&amp;pg=PA355|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her first book, ''Science as Social Knowledge'' (1990), Longino argued for the relevance of [[Value (ethics)|social values]], or values which are part of the human context of science, to the justification of scientific knowledge as [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]]. In her [[contextual empiricism]], she argues that observations and [[data]] of the sort taken by scientists are not by themselves evidence for or against any particular [[hypothesis|hypotheses]]. Rather, the relevance of any particular data for any given hypothesis is decided by human beliefs and assumptions about what kinds of data can support what kinds of hypotheses. Moreover, even when the relevance of evidence is decided, there remains a [[logic]]al gap between evidence and full justification of interesting [[theory|scientific theories]] (the traditional philosophical problem of [[underdetermination]] of theories). This gap, too, must be bridged by beliefs and assumptions about legitimate reasoning in order for evidence to help us decide which hypotheses to accept as true.&lt;ref name="Reiss"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Zalta|editor-first1=Edward N.|last1=Reiss|first1=Julian|last2=Sprenger|first2=Jan|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2016|chapter=Scientific Objectivity|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2016/entries/scientific-objectivity/|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zalta"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Zalta|editor-first1=Edward N.|last1=Longino|first1=Helen|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2016|chapter=The Social Dimensions of Scientific Knowledge|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/scientific-knowledge-social/|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Heikes"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Heikes|first1=Deborah K.|title=The Bias Paradox: Why it's Not Just for Feminists Anymore|journal=Synthese|date=February 2004|volume=138|issue=3|pages=315–335|doi=10.1023/B:SYNT.0000016424.47883.b9|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/B:SYNT.0000016424.47883.b9|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fortunately, the use of diverse perspectives to criticize hypotheses can turn some of those hypotheses into scientific knowledge. Hypotheses become knowledge when they are subjected to scrutiny from diverse perspectives, especially by those with diverse beliefs and values.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Anderson|first1=Elizabeth|title=How Not to Criticize Feminist Epistemology: a Review of Scrutinizing Feminist Epistemology|url=http://www-personal.umich.edu/~eandersn/hownotreview.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast to those philosophers who would point to the two evidential gaps above to argue that science is not objective therefore, Longino argues that scrutiny by those with diverse values can instead support the objectivity of science.&lt;ref name="Crasnow"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crasnow|first1=Sharon L.|title=Can Science Be Objective? Longino's Science as Social Knowledge|journal=Hypatia|date=1993|volume=8|issue=3|pages=194–201|jstor=3810414|doi=10.1111/j.1527-2001.1993.tb00045.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Accordingly, our values which do not immediately seem to have anything to do with science are crucial to the [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectivity]] of pieces of scientific knowledge, and science can be objective precisely because it is not value-free.&lt;ref name="Brown"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kincaid"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kincaid|first1=Harold|last2=Dupré|first2=John|last3=Wylie|first3=Alison|title=Value-free science? : ideals and illusions|date=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780195308969}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gannett"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gannett|first1=Lisa|title=Harold Kincaid, John Dupré, and Alison Wylie (eds.), Value-Free Science?

{{quote|Longino (1990, 2001) has developed most fully a conception of objectivity based on democratic discussion. Her key idea is that the production of knowledge is a social enterprise, secured through the critical and cooperative interactions of inquirers. The products of this social enterprise are more objective, the more responsive they are to criticism from all points of view.|Elizabeth Anderson, 2015&lt;ref name="Anderson"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Zalta|editor-first1=Edward N.|last1=Anderson|first1=Elizabeth|title=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|date=2015|chapter=Feminist Epistemology and Philosophy of Science|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2015/entries/feminism-epistemology/|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Longino's book ''The Fate of Knowledge'' (2002) explores and attempts to reconcile the accounts of knowledge of [[philosophy of science|philosophers]] and [[sociology of science|sociologists]] of science.&lt;ref name="Barberis"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barberis|first1=Daniela|title=Helen E.  Longino. The Fate of Knowledge.|journal=Isis|date=September 2004|volume=95|issue=3|pages=539–540|doi=10.1086/429058|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/429058?journalCode=isis|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recently, in ''Studying Human Behavior: How Scientists Investigate Aggression and Sexuality'' (2013), Longino examines five scientific approaches to human aggression and sexuality in terms of their epistemological frameworks, the types of knowledge that they produce, and their pragmatic goals. She argues that different approaches begin from and build upon different causes, each of them producing partial knowledge about the subject. As such, they cannot be reduced to a single perspective.  From her perspective in social epistemology, Longino argues that scientific research will be more useful as a guide to public policy makers if the plurality of different approaches to knowledge is acknowledged.  Increasing awareness of the range of perspectives to be examined can benefit policy by more thoroughly informing decisions, and also encourage caution about too quickly adopting policy positions based on a limited perspective.&lt;ref name="Weaver"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weaver|first1=Sara|last2=Fehr|first2=Carla|title=Studying Human Behavior: How Scientists Investigate Aggression and Sexuality|journal=Hypatia Reviews Online|date=2013|url=http://hypatiaphilosophy.org/HRO/content/studying-human-behavior-how-scientists-investigate-aggression-and-sexuality|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though her work on the nature of scientific knowledge is broadly [[feminism|feminist]] in the sense that it argues for the value of contributions by diverse people (and accordingly the value of the contributions of women) to science, some of Longino's other work has been more explicitly feminist and concerned with women.  For example, she has presented and analyzed alternative narratives of female and male-centered accounts of [[human evolution]], emphasizing the impact of gender-centered assumptions on the formation of theory.&lt;ref name="Yearly"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yearly|first1=Steven|title=Making sense of science : understanding the social study of science|date=2005|publisher=SAGE|location=London|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oNjC2BahszMC&amp;pg=PA194|accessdate=9 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Thus, conventional scientific work on the history of human evolution tends to prioritise the activities of males even though (according to Longino and to Hubbard) there is nothing in the data or in established theory which means that the evolutionary changes are any more likely to be attributable to males than females. ... therefore we do have plausible evidence that the construction of scientific knowledge at the forefront of research ... has been influenced by gendered assumptions.|Steven Yearly, 2005&lt;ref name="Yearly"/&gt;}}

Beyond the study of knowledge, her writing has included the analysis of the nature of [[pornography]] and the circumstances under which it is [[ethics|morally]] problematic.&lt;ref name="Cahn"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Cahn|editor-first1=Steven M.|title=Exploring ethics : an introductory anthology|date=2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0199946587|chapter=Pornography, oppression, and freedom : a closer look|edition=Third|last1=Longino|first1=Helen E.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ward"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=David V.|title=Feminism, Pornography, and Censorship|journal=Enlightenment|url=http://enlightenment.supersaturated.com/essays/text/davidward/pornographyfeminism.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honors==
In 2002, Longino's book ''The Fate of Knowledge'' (2001) received the Robert K.

'''Hogging''' or '''sweat hogging''' refers to the practice of groups of men who target [[overweight]] or [[obese]] women, typically for sexual encounters. Unlike [[fat fetishism|fat fetishists]], men who participate in hogging are not necessarily sexually attracted to obese women's bodies; they aim to take advantage of a female's [[stereotype|stereotypical]] low [[self-esteem]] or to derive amusement for themselves and their friends by engaging in sexual activities with women who are overweight.

== Practice ==
The social practice can be undertaken as an individual or group activity, and often includes excessive [[Alcohol intoxication|alcohol consumption]], [[emotional detachment]], and degradation of the woman. Hogging does not always include [[sexual intercourse]], and often other sexual activities are the end goal. Participation sometimes includes making bets among male peers, as well as humiliating the woman involved.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web

== Criticism ==
Hogging has been described as a form of [[misogyny]], and as part of culturally-sanctioned abuse of women in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Citation|title="Knocking off a Fat Girl:" An Exploration of Hogging, Male Sexuality, and Neutralizations|date=|url=|year=2006|last1=Gailey|last2=Prohaska|first1=Jeannine|first2=Ariane|authorlink1=|authorlink2=|journal=[[Deviant Behavior (journal)|Deviant Behavior]]|volume=27|issue=1|pages=31–49|doi=|id=}}&lt;/ref&gt; although the activity has also been observed in Australia.&lt;ref name="McShaneWilliams2007"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DWas8uhuEZIC&amp;pg=PA90|title=Youth Violence and Delinquency &amp;#91;Three Volumes&amp;#93;|author1=Marilyn D.

Williams|date=1 January 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-08204-7|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Donna Jarrell, lecturer at [[Ohio State University]] and author of ''What Are You Looking At?: the First Fat Fiction Anthology,'' described hogging as a "sad" practice, saying that it reveals how "our attraction or our revulsion to fat has a lot to do with our culture". She commented that the fat [[Social stigma|stigma]] is so extreme that even men who are genuinely attracted to overweight women cannot admit or discuss their feelings.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The practice has also been suggested as a manifestation of [[hypermasculinity]], in which men who do not fit into normative expectations of manhood exhibit insecurity, defensiveness, and sexual aggression to make up for their incapacity to meet masculine standards. In this manner, hogging is described as a form of [[sexual predation]] in which sex is an act of conquest, not intimacy.&lt;ref name="McShaneWilliams2007" /&gt;

'''''Ibis redibis nunquam per bella peribis''''' (alternatively '''''Ibis redibis nunquam in bello morieris''''') is a [[Latin language|Latin]] phrase, often used to illustrate the meaning of [[syntactic ambiguity]] to students of either Latin or [[linguistics]]. Traditionally, it is attributed to the [[oracles]] of [[Dodona]]. The phrase is thought to have been uttered to a general consulting the oracle about his fate in an upcoming battle. The sentence is crafted in a way that without [[punctuation]], it can be interpreted in two significantly different ways.&lt;ref&gt;Maldonado, J.L. "On Ambiguity, Confusion and the Ego Ideal", 1993, International Journal of  Psycho-Analysis, vol. 74, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.websters-online-dictionary.org/or/oracle.html websters-online-dictionary.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Meanings and translation==

: ''Ibis, redibis, nunquam per bella peribis.''

Meaning "you will go, you will return, never in war will you perish". The other possibility is the exact opposite in meaning:

: ''Ibis, redibis nunquam, per bella peribis.''

That is: "you will go, you will never return, in (the) war you will perish".

===Greek parallel===
A Greek parallel expression with the same meaning is also current: ἤξεις ἀφήξεις, οὐ θνήξεις ἐν πολέμῳ. While Greek authorities have in the past assumed this was the original [[Dodona]] oracle (e.g. first edition of Babiniotis dictionary), no ancient instance of the expression is attested, and a future form corresponding to the rhyming θνήξεις (instead of the classical θανεῖ) is first attested from the reign of Nero ([[Greek Anthology]] 9.354). The Greek expression is therefore likeliest a modern back-translation from the Latin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://sarantakos.wordpress.com/2016/02/27/meze-208/#comment-338997 Nikos Sarantakos' blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary usage===

To say that something is an ''ibis redibis'', usually in the context of legal documents, is to say that its wording is (either deliberately or accidentally) confusing or ambiguous.

[[File:Ahinsa Sthal.jpg|thumb|270px|Statue of Mahavira in meditation, Ahinsa Sthal, Mehrauli, New Delhi]]{{Jainism}}
'''Jain meditation''' (''dhyāna'') has been the central practice of spirituality in [[Jainism]] along with the [[Ratnatraya|Three Jewels]].&lt;ref name="Kundakunda, Umaswati"&gt;{{cite book|author= Acharya Mahapragya|title=Jain Yog|publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh|chapter=Foreword|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jainism holds that emancipation can only be achieved through Meditation or ''Shukla Dhyana.'' According to Sagarmal Jain, it aims to reach and remain in a state of "pure-self awareness or knowership."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Jain, Sagarmal, The Historical development of the Jaina yoga system and the impacts of other Yoga systems on Jaina Yoga, in "Christopher Key Chapple (editor), Yoga in Jainism" chapter 1.
&lt;/ref&gt; Meditation is also seen as realizing the self, taking the soul to complete freedom, beyond any craving, aversion and/or attachment.&lt;ref name="blessings"&gt;{{cite book|author= Acharya Tulsi|title=Sambodhi|publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh|chapter=blessings|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practitioner strives to be just a knower-seer (''Gyata-Drashta''). Jain meditation can be broadly categorized to the auspicious (''Dharmya Dhyana'' and ''Shukla Dhyana'') and inauspicious (''Artta'' and ''Raudra Dhyana''). The 20th century saw the development and spread of new modernist forms of Jain ''Dhyana,'' mainly by monks and laypersons of [[Śvētāmbara]] Jainism.

Jain meditation is also referred as '''Sāmāyika'''. A form of this which includes a strong component of scripture study ([[Svādhyāya]]) is mainly promoted by the more conservative [[Digambara]] tradition of Jainism.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=256}} The word ''Sāmāyika'' means being in the moment of continuous real-time. This act of being conscious of the continual renewal of the universe in general and one's own renewal of the individual living being (''Jiva'') in particular is the critical first step in the journey towards identification with one's true nature, called the ''[[Atman (Jainism)|Atman]]''. It is also a method by which one can develop an attitude of harmony and respect towards other humans, animals and Nature.

There are various common postures for Jain meditation, including [[Lotus position|Padmasana]], [[Half lotus|Ardh-Padmasana]], [[Vajrasana (yoga)|Vajrasana]], [[Sukhasana]], standing, and lying down. The 24 Tirthankaras are always seen in one of these two postures in the [[Kayotsarga]] (standing) or [[Lotus position|Padmasana]]/''Paryankasana'' (Lotus).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asia.si.edu/collections/zoomObject.cfm?ObjectId=12831|title=South Asian and Himalayan Art &amp;#124; Jain shrine of Parshvanatha &amp;#124; F1993.11|date=|publisher=Asia.si.edu|accessdate=2012-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Pre-modern History==
Sagarmal Jain divides the history of Jaina yoga and meditation into five stages, 1. pre-canonical (before sixth century BCE), 2. canonical age (fifth century BCE to fifth century CE), 3. post-canonical (sixth century CE to twelfth century CE), age of tantra and rituals (thirteenth to nineteenth century CE), modern age (20th century on).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The main change in the canonical era was that Jain meditation became influenced by Hindu Yogic traditions.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=42}}

=== Pre-canonical age ===

Jains believe all twenty-four [[Tirthankaras]] (such as [[Rishabhanatha]]) practiced deep meditation, some for years, some for months and attained enlightenment. All the statues and pictures of Tirthankaras primarily show them in meditative postures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Jainism in Bihar | publisher=I.R.

The earliest mention of yogic practices appear in early [[Jain Agamas|Jain canonical]] texts like the [[Acharanga Sutra|Acaranga]], [[Sutrakritanga]] and Rsibhasita. The Acaranga for example, mentions [[Trāṭaka]] (fixed gaze) meditation, Preksha meditation (self-awareness) and [[Kayotsarga]] (''‘kāyaṃ vosajjamaṇgāre’'', giving up the body).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=50, 58}} The Acaranga also mentions the [[Tapas (Indian religions)|tapas]] practice of standing in the heat of the sun (ātāpanā).{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=93}}

The [[Acharanga Sutra|Acaranga sutra]], one of the oldest Jain texts, describes the solitary [[Asceticism|ascetic]] meditation of [[Mahavira]] before attaining [[Kevala Jnana]] as follows:{{sfn|Jacobi|1884|p=}}&lt;blockquote&gt;Giving up the company of all householders whomsoever, he meditated. Asked, he gave no answer; he went, and did not transgress the right path. (AS 312) In these places was the wise Sramana for thirteen long years; he meditated day and night, exerting himself, undisturbed, strenuously. (AS 333) And Mahavira meditated (persevering) in some posture, without the smallest motion; he meditated in mental concentration on (the things) above, below, beside, free from desires. He meditated free from sin and desire, not attached to sounds or colours; though still an erring mortal (khadmastha), he wandered about, and never acted carelessly.(AS 374-375)&lt;/blockquote&gt;After more than twelve years of austerities and meditation, the AS states that Mahavira entered the state of [[Kevala Jnana]] while doing shukla dhayana, the highest form of meditation:{{sfn|Jacobi|1884|verse=986|p=}}&lt;blockquote&gt;The Venerable Ascetic Mahavira passed twelve years in this way of life; during the thirteenth year in the second month of summer, in the fourth fortnight, the light (fortnight) of Vaisakha, on its tenth day called Suvrata, in the Muhurta called Vigaya, while the moon was in conjunction with the asterism Uttaraphalguni, when the shadow had turned towards the east, and the first wake was over, outside of the town Grimbhikagrama, on the northern bank of the river Rigupalika, in the field of the householder Samaga, in a north-eastern direction from an old temple, not far from a Sal tree, in a [[squatting position]] with joined heels exposing himself to the heat of the sun, with the knees high and the head low, in deep meditation, in the midst of abstract meditation, he reached Nirvana, the complete and full, the unobstructed, unimpeded, infinite and supreme best knowledge and intuition, called Kevala.&lt;/blockquote&gt;According to Samani Pratibha Pragya, early Jain texts like the ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' and the ''Āvaśyaka-sūtra'' are also important sources for early Jain meditation. The ''[[Uttaradhyayana|Uttarādhyayana]]-sūtra'' "offers a systematic presentation of four types of meditative practices such as: meditation (dhyāna), abandonment of the body (kāyotsarga), contemplation (anuprekṣā), and reflection (bhāvanā)."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=42}} Pragya argues that "we can conclude that Mahāvīra’s method of meditation consisted of perception and concentration in isolated places, concentration that sought to be unaffected by physical surroundings as well as emotions."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=52}} Pragya also notes that fasting was an important practice done alongside meditation.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=51}} The intense meditation described in these texts "is an activity that leads to a state of motionlessness, which is a state of inactivity of body, speech and mind, essential for eliminating karma."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=52}} The ''Uttarādhyayana-sūtra'' also describes the practice of contemplation ([[Twelve Contemplations|anuprekṣā]]).

Another meditation described in the Āvaśyaka-sūtra is meditation on the [[Tirthankara|tīrthaṅkaras]].{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=105}}

=== Canonical age ===
[[File:उमास्वामी_आचार्यजी.jpg|right|thumb|[[Umaswati]] in full lotus posture]]
In this era, the [[Jain Agamas|Jain canon]] was recorded and [[Jain philosophy]] systematized. It is clear that Jain meditation and [[samadhi]] continued to evolve and to be practiced after the death of [[Mahavira]] by figures such as [[Acharya Bhadrabahu]] and [[Chandragupta Maurya]], the founder of [[Maurya Empire]] who became a Jain monk in old age and a student of Bhadrabahu.&lt;ref name="Bhadrabahu2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Jain dharam ke prabhavak acharya|author=Sadhvi Sanghmitra|publisher=Aadarsh Saahitya Sangh|chapter=Acharya Bhadrabahu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Acharya Bhadrabahu-1|url=http://www.digambarjainonline.com/dharma/greatja1.htm|publisher=Digambaronline}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=October 2018}} It describes Mahavira as practicing intense austerities, [[Fasting|fasts]] (most commonly three days long, as extreme as six months of fasting) and meditations. In one instance he practiced standing meditation for sixteen days and nights. He did this by facing each of the four directions for a period of time, and then turning to face the intermediate directions as well as above and below.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=53-55}}

This period also sees the elucidation of the practice of contemplation ([[Twelve Contemplations|anuprekṣā]]) by [[Kundakunda|Kundakunda's]] ''Vārassa-aṇuvekkhā'' or “Twelve Contemplations” (c. 1st century BCE to 1st century CE).{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=66}} These twelve forms of reflection (''[[Bhavana|bhāvanā]]'') aid in the stopping of the influx of [[Karma|karmas]] that extend transmigration. These twelve reflections are:{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=149-150}}

#''anitya bhāvanā'' – the transitoriness of the world;
#''aśaraņa bhāvanā'' – the helplessness of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;According to the Jain text, ''Sarvārthasiddhi'': There is no escape for the young one of a deer pounced upon by a hungry tiger fond of the flesh of animals. Similarly, there is no way of escape for the self caught in the meshes of birth, old age, death, disease and sorrow. Even the stout body is helpful in the presence of food, but not in the presence of distress. And wealth acquired by great effort does not accompany the self to the next birth. The friends who have shared the joys and sorrows of an individual cannot save him at his death. His relations all united together cannot give him relief when he is afflicted by ailment. But if he accumulates merit or virtue, it will help him to cross the ocean of misery. Even the lord of devas cannot help anyone at the point of death. Therefore virtue is the only means of succour to one in the midst of misery. Friends, wealth, etc. are also transient. And so there is nothing else except virtue which offers succour to the self. To contemplate thus is the reflection on helplessness. He, who is distressed at the thought that he is utterly helpless, does not identify himself with thoughts of worldly existence. And endeavours to march on the path indicated by the Omniscient Lord.&lt;!--{{sfn|S.A. Jain|1992|p=245-246}}--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
#''saṃsāra'' – the pain and suffering implied in transmigration;
#''aikatva bhāvanā'' – the inability of another to share one’s suffering and sorrow;
#''anyatva bhāvanā'' – the distinctiveness between the body and the soul;
#''aśuci bhāvanā'' – the filthiness of the body;
#āsrava bhāvanā – influx of karmic matter;
#saṃvara bhāvanā – stoppage of karmic matter;
#nirjarā bhāvanā – gradual shedding of karmic matter;
#''loka bhāvanā'' – the form and divisions of the universe and the nature of the conditions prevailing in the different regions – heavens, hells, and the like;
#bodhidurlabha bhāvanā – the extreme difficulty in obtaining human birth and, subsequently, in attaining true faith; and
#dharma bhāvanā – the truth promulgated by Lord Jina.

In his ''Niyamasara'', Acarya [[Kundakunda]], also describes ''yoga [[bhakti]]''—devotion to the path to liberation—as the highest form of devotion.&lt;ref&gt;Niyamasara [134-40]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sthananga Sutra]] (c. 2nd century BCE) gives a summary of four main types of meditation (dhyana) or concentrated thought. The first two are mental or psychological states in which a person may become fully immersed and are causes of bondage. The other two are pure states of meditation and conduct, which are causes of emancipation. They are:{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=66-75}}

# ''Arta-Dhyana,'' "a mental condition of suffering, agony and anguish." Usually caused by thinking about an object of desire or a painful ailment.
# ''Raudra-Dhyana,'' associated with cruelty, aggressive and possessive urges. 
# ''Dharma-Dhyana,'' "virtuous" or "customary", refers to knowledge of the soul, the non-soul and the universe. Over time this became associated with discriminating knowledge (''bheda-vijñāna'') of the [[Tattva (Jainism)|tattvas]] (truths or fundamental principles). 
# ''Sukla-Dhyana'' (pure or white), divided into (1) Multiple contemplation, (''pṛthaktva-vitarka-savicāra''); (2) Unitary contemplation, (''aikatva-vitarka-nirvicāra''); (3) Subtle infallible physical activity (''sūkṣma-kriyā-pratipāti''); and (4) Irreversible stillness of the soul (''vyuparata-kriyā-anivarti''). The first two are said to require knowledge of the lost Jain scriptures known as [[purvas]] and thus it is considered by some Jains that pure meditation was no longer possible. The other two forms are said in the Tattvartha sutra to be only accessible to [[Kevala Jnana|Kevalins]] (enlightened ones).{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=73, 225}}

This broad definition of the term dhyana means that it signifies any state of deep concentration, with good or bad results.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=67}} Later texts like [[Umaswati]]'s [[Tattvartha Sutra|''Tattvārthasūtra'']] and [[Jinabhadra]]'s ''Dhyana-Sataka'' (sixth century) also discusses these four dhyanas. This system seems to be uniquely Jain.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

During this era, a key text was the [[Tattvartha Sutra|''Tattvarthasutra'']] by Acharya [[Umaswati|Umāsvāti]] which codified Jain doctrine.&lt;ref name="Kundakunda, Umaswati" /&gt; According to the ''[[Tattvarthasutra]],'' yoga is the sum of all the activities of mind, speech and body. Umāsvāti (fl. sometime between the 2nd and 5th-century CE) calls yoga the cause of "asrava" or [[Karma in Jainism|karmic influx]]&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2"&gt;Tattvarthasutra [6.2]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as one of the essentials—''[[Ratnatraya|samyak caritra]]''—in the path to liberation.&lt;ref name="Tattvarthasutra 6.2" /&gt; Umāsvāti prescribed a threefold path of yoga: right conduct/austerity, right knowledge, right faith.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Umāsvāti also defined a series of fourteen stages of spiritual development ([[Gunasthana|guṇasthāna]]), into which he embedded the four fold description of dhyana.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=68, 76}} These stages culminate in the pure activities of body, speech, and mind (''sayogi-kevala''), and the "cessation of all activity" (''[[Kevala Jnana|ayogi-kevala]]'').{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=77}} Umāsvāti also defined meditation in a new way (as ''‘ekāgra-cintā’''): &lt;blockquote&gt;“Concentration of thought on a single object by a person with good bone-joints is meditation which lasts an intra-hour (''ā-muhūrta'')”{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=73-74}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;Other important figures are [[Jinabhadra]], and [[Pujyapada|Pujyapada Devanandi]] (wrote the commentary ''[[Sarvārthasiddhi]]''). Sagarmal Jain notes that during the canonical age of Jaina meditation, one finds strong analogues with the [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|8 limbs of Patanjali Yoga]], including the [[yamas]] and [[Niyama|niyamas]], through often under different names. Sagarmal also notes that during this period the Yoga systems of Jainism, Buddhism and Patanjali Yoga had many similarities.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In spite of this literature, Dundas claims that Jainism never “fully developed a culture of true meditative contemplation,” he further states that later Jaina writers discussed meditation more out of “theoretical interest.”&lt;ref&gt;Dundas, Paul (1992). The Jains. First Edition. London and New York: Routledge, 143-4.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-canonical ===
This period saw new texts specifically on Jain meditation and further Hindu influences on Jain yoga. [[Haribhadra|Ācārya Haribhadra]] in the 8th century wrote the meditation compendium called [[Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya|''Yogadṛṣṭisamuccya'']] which discusses systems of Jain yoga, [[Patanjali]] Yoga and [[Buddhist meditation|Buddhist yoga]] and develops his own unique system that are somewhat similar to these. Ācārya Haribhadra assimilated many elements from Patañjali’s [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga-sūtra]] into his new Jain yoga (which also has eight parts) and composed four texts on this topic, ''Yoga-bindu'', ''Yogadṛṣṭisamuccaya, Yoga-śataka'' and ''Yoga-viṅśikā''.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=79}} [[Johannes Bronkhorst]] considers Haribhadra's contributions a "far more drastic departure from the scriptures."&lt;ref&gt;Bronkhorst, Johannes (1993). Remarks on the History of Jaina Meditation. In Rudy Smet &amp; Kenji Watanabe (Ed.), Jain Studies in Honour of Jozef Deleu (pp.151-162). Tokyo: Hon-no-Tomosha.&lt;/ref&gt; He worked with a different definition of yoga than previous Jains, defining yoga as "that which connects to liberation" and his works allowed Jainism to compete with other religious systems of yoga.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=79}}   

The first five stages of Haribhadra's yoga system is preparatory and includes posture and so on. The sixth stage is kāntā [pleasing] and is similar to Patañjali's "[[Dhāraṇā]]." It is defined as "a higher concentration for the sake of compassion toward others. Pleasure is never found in externals and a beneficial reflection arises. In this state, due to the efficacy of dharma, one’s conduct becomes purified. One is beloved among beings and single-mindedly devoted to dharma. (YSD, 163) With mind always fixed on scriptural dharma." {{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=81}} The seventh stage is radiance (prabhā), a state of calmness, purification and happiness as well as "the discipline of conquering amorous passion, the emergence of strong discrimination, and the power of constant serenity."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=82}} The final stage of meditation in this system is 'the highest' (parā), a "state of [[Samadhi]] in which one becomes free from all attachments and attains liberation." Haribhadra sees this as being in "the category of “ayoga” (motionlessness), a state which we can compare with the state just prior to liberation."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=82}}

Acarya [[Haribhadra]] (as well as the later thinker [[Hemacandra]]) also mentions the five major vows of ascetics and 12 minor vows of laity under yoga. This has led certain [[Indologist]]s like Prof. [[Robert J. Zydenbos]] to call Jainism, essentially, a system of yogic thinking that grew into a full-fledged religion.&lt;ref&gt;Zydenbos, Robert. "Jainism Today and Its Future." München: Manya Verlag, 2006. p.66&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Yamas#Five yamas of Patañjali|five yamas]] or the constraints of the ''[[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali]]'' bear a resemblance to the [[Mahavrata|five major vows of Jainism]], indicating a history of strong cross-fertilization between these traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Zydenbos (2006) p.66&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Worthington writes, "Yoga fully acknowledges its debt to Jainism, and Jainism reciprocates by making the practice of yoga part and parcel of life."&lt;ref&gt;Worthington, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;|group=lower-alpha}}  

Later works also provide their own definitions of meditation. The ''Sarvārthasiddhi'' of [[Akalanka]] (9 th c. CE) states "only the knowledge that shines like an unflickering flame is meditation."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=46}} According to Samani Pratibha Pragya, the Tattvānuśāsana of Ramasena (10th c. CE) states that this knowledge is "many-pointed concentration (''vyagra'') and meditation is one-pointed concentration (''ekāgra'')."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=46-47}}

=== The Tantric age ===
[[File:The 24 Tirthankaras forming the tantric meditative syllable Hrim.jpg|thumb|270px|The 24 Tirthankaras forming the tantric meditative syllable ''Hrim'', painting on cloth, [[Gujarat]], c. 1800|300px]]
This period sees tantric influences on Jain meditation, which can be gleaned in the Jñānārṇava of Śubhacandra (11thc. CE), and the [[Yogaśāstra]] of [[Hemachandra|Hemacandra]] (12th c. CE).{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=43, 82}} [[Śubhacandra]] offered a new model of four meditations:{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=83}}

# Meditation on the corporeal body (piṇḍstha), which also includes five concentrations (dhāraṇā): on the earth element (pārthivī), the fire element (āgneyī), the air element (śvasanā/ mārutī), the water element (vāruṇī) and the fifth related to the non-material self (tattvrūpavatī).
# Meditation on [[Mantra|mantric]] syllables (padastha);
# Meditation on the forms of the arhat (rūpastha);
# Meditation on the pure formless self (rūpātīta).

Śubhacandra also discusses breath control and withdrawal of the mind. Modern scholars such as [[Mahāprajña]] have noted that this system of yoga already existed in [[Kashmir Shaivism|Śaiva tantra]] and that Śubhacandara developed his system based on the ''Navacakreśvara-tantra'' and that this system is also present in [[Abhinavagupta|Abhinavagupta’s]] [[Tantraloka|Tantrāloka]]''.''{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=83}} 

The [[Yogaśāstra]] of [[Hemachandra|Hemacandra]] (12th c. CE) closely follows the model of Śubhacandra. This trend of adopting ideas from the Brāhmaṇical and tantric Śaiva traditions continues with the work of the later [[Śvētāmbara|Śvetāmbara]] upādhyāya [[Yashovijaya|Yaśovijaya]] (1624–1688), who wrote many works on yoga.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=86}}

During the 17th century, Ācārya [[Vinayavijaya]] composed the ''Śānta-sudhārasabhāvanā'' in Sanskrit which teaches sixteen anuprekṣā, or contemplations.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=86-87}}

== Modern era ==

[[File:Jain Spiritual Retreat LA.jpg|thumb|270px|Jain Spiritual Retreat, [[Los Angeles]]]]

The growth and popularity of mainstream [[Yoga]] and Hindu meditation practices influenced a revival in various Jain communities, especially in the [[Śvētāmbara Terapanth]] order. These systems sought to "promote health and well-being and pacifism, via meditative practices as “secular” nonreligious tools."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=249}} 20th century Jain meditation systems were promoted as universal systems accessible to all, drawing on modern elements, using new vocabulary designed to appeal to the lay community, whether Jains or non-Jains.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=251}} It is important to note that these developments happened mainly among [[Śvētāmbara]] sects, while [[Digambara]] groups generally did not develop new modernist meditation systems.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=254}} Digambara sects instead promote the practice of self-study ([[Svādhyāya]]) as a form of meditation, influenced by the work of [[Kundakunda]]. This practice of self study (reciting scriptures and thinking about the meaning) is included in the practice of equanimity ([[sāmāyika]]) which is the spiritual practice emphasized by 20th century Digambara sects.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=256}}

=== Terāpanth ''prekṣā-dhyāna'' ===
The modern era saw the rise of a new [[Śvētāmbara]] sect, the [[Śvētāmbara Terapanth]], founded by [[Bhikshu (Jain monk)|Ācārya Bhikṣu]], who was said to be able to practice breath retention (hold his breath) for two hours.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=92}} He also practiced ātāpanā by sitting under the scorching sun for hours while chanting and visualizing [[yantra]]s.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=95}} Further Terapanth scholars like Jayācārya wrote on various meditation practices, including a devotional visualization of the [[Tirthankara|tīrthaṅkaras]] in various colors and “awareness of breathing” (sāsā-surat), this influenced the later “perception of breathing” (śvāsa–prekṣā) and the meditation on auras (leśyā-dhyāna) of Ācārya [[Mahāprajña]].{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=102, 105}}

[[Tulsi (Jain monk)|Tulasī]] (1913–1997) and Ācārya [[Mahāprajña]] (1920– 2010) developed a system termed ''prekṣā-dhyāna'' which included "meditative techniques of mantra, posture (āsana), breath control (prāṇāyāma), hand and body gestures (mudrā), various bodily locks (bandha), meditation (dhyāna) and reflection (bhāvanā)."{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=89-90}} Through the use of numerous different sources, including Jain scripture and tradition, [[S. N. Goenka|SN Goenka's]] [[Vipassana movement|vipassanā]] meditation (Mahāprajña attended retreats in this tradition), Patañjali’s [[Yoga Sutras of Patanjali|Yoga-sūtra]], the Haṭha yoga tradition and Western science and therapies.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=157}} The key texts of this meditation system are ''Prekṣā-Dhyāna: Ādhāra aura Svarūpa'' (Prekṣā Meditation: Basis and Form, 1980), ''Prekṣā-Dhyāna: Prayoga aura Paddhatti'' (Prekṣā Meditation: Theory and Practice, 2010) and ''Prekṣā-Dhyāna: Darśana aura Prayoga'' (Prekṣā Meditation: Philosophy and Practice, 2011). [[File:Acharyashri1.JPG|thumb|Ācārya [[Mahāprajña]], formulator of Preksha meditation]] Despite the innovations, the meditation system it is said is firmly grounded in the classic Jain metaphysical [[Mind–body dualism|mind body dualism]] in which the self ([[Jīva (Jainism)|jiva]], characterized by consciousness, ''cetana'' which consists of knowledge, ''jñāna'' and intuition, ''darśana'') is covered over by subtle and gross bodies.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=180-181}}

''Prekṣā'' means "to perceive carefully and profoundly". In ''prekṣā'', perception always means an impartial experience bereft of the duality of like and dislike, pleasure and pain, attachment or aversion.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya Mahapragya{{cite book|title=The Mirror Of The Self|author=Acharya Mahapragya Key|publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India|year=1995|chapter=01.01 what is preksha}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meditative progress proceeds through the different gross and subtle bodies, differentiating between them and the pure consciousness of jiva. [[Mahāprajña]] interprets the goal of this to mean to “perceive and realise the most subtle aspects of consciousness by your conscious mind (''mana'').”{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=182}} Important disciplines in the system are - Synchrony of mental and physical actions or simply present mindedness or complete awareness of one's actions, disciplining the reacting attitude, friendliness, diet, silence, spiritual vigilance.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya Mahapragya{{cite book|title=The Mirror Of The Self|author=Acharya Mahapragya Key|publisher=JVB, Ladnun, India|year=1995|chapter=2 path and goal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mature ''prekṣā'' system is taught using an eight limb hierarchical schema, where each one is necessary for practicing the next:{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=186-196}}

# '''Relaxation ([[Kayotsarga|''kāyotsarga'']])''', abandonment of the body, also “relaxation (''śithilīkaraṇa'') with self-awareness,” allows vital force (prāṇa) to flow.
# '''Internal Journey (''antaryātrā'')''', this is based on the practice of directing the flow of vital energy ([[Prana|''prāṇa-śakti'']]) in an upward direction, interpreted as being connected with the nervous system.
# '''Perception of Breathing (''śvāsaprekon'')''', of two types: (1) perception of long or deep breathing (''dīrgha-śvāsa-prekṣā'') and (2) perception of breathing through alternate nostrils (''samavṛtti-śvāsa-prekṣā'').
# '''Perception of Body (''śarīraprekṣā''),''' one becomes aware of the gross physical body (''audārika-śarīra''), the fiery body (''taijasa-śarīra'') and karmic body (''karmaṇa-śarīra''), this practice allows one to perceive the self through the body.
# '''Perception of [[Chakra|Psychic Centres]] (''caitanyakendra-prekṣā''),''' defined as locations in the subtle body that contain ‘dense consciousness’ (saghana-cetanā), which  [[Mahāprajña]] maps into the endocrine system.
# '''Perception of [[Lesya|Psychic Colors]] (''leśyā-dhyāna''),''' these are subtle consciousness radiations of the soul, which can be malevolent or benevolent and can be transformed.
# '''Auto-Suggestion (''bhāvanā''),''' Mahāprajña defines bhāvanā as “repeated verbal reflection”, infusing the psyche (''citta'') with ideas through strong resolve and generating "counter-vibrations" which eliminate evil impulses.
# '''Contemplation (''[[Anupreksa|anuprekṣā]]''),''' contemplations are combined with the previous steps of dhyana in different ways. The contemplations can often be secular in nature. 

A few important contemplation themes are - Impermanence, Solitariness, and Vulnerability. Regular practice is believed to strengthen the immune system and build up stamina to resist against aging, pollution, viruses, diseases. Meditation practice is an important part of the daily lives of the religion's monks.&lt;ref&gt;J. Zaveri [http://www.jzaveri.com/what_is_preksha.htm What is Preksha?]. .jzaveri.com. Retrieved on: August 25, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;{{better|date=October 2018}}

Mahāprajña also taught subsidiary limbs to ''prekṣā-dhyāna'' which would help support the meditations in a holistic manner, these are Prekṣā-yoga ([[Asana|posture]] and [[Pranayama|breathing control]]) and Prekṣā-cikitsā (therapy).{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=199}} Mantras such as ''Arham'' are also used in this system.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=205}}

=== Other Modern Jain meditation traditions ===

[[Chitrabhanu|Citrabhānu]] (b. 1922) was a Jain monk who moved to the West in 1971, and founded the first Jain meditation center in the world, the Jaina Meditation International Centre in New York City. He eventually married and became a lay teacher of a new system called "Jain meditation" (JM), on which he wrote various books.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=260-261}} The core of his system consists of three steps (tripadī): 1. who am I? (kohum), 2. I am not that (nahum) (not non-self), 3. I am that (sohum) (I am the self). He also makes use of classic Jain meditations such as the twelve reflections (thought taught in a more optimistic, modern way), Jaina mantras, meditation on the [[Chakra|seven chakras]], as well as Hatha Yoga techniques.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=262}}

Ācārya Suśīlakumāra (1926–1994) of the [[Sthānakavāsī]] tradition founded “Arhum Yoga” (Yoga on Omniscient) and established a Jain community called the “Arhat Saṅgha” in New Jersey in 1974.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=267-268}} His meditation system is strongly tantric and employs mantras (mainly the [[Namokar Mantra|namaskār]]), [[Nyasa (ritual)|nyasa]], visualization and chakras.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=270-271}}

The Sthānakavāsī Ācārya Nānālāla (1920–1999), developed a Jaina meditation called Samīkṣaṇa-dhyāna (looking at thoroughly, close investigation) in 1981.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=274}} The main goal of samīkṣaṇa-dhyāna is the experience of higher consciousness within the self and liberation in this life.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=277}} Samīkṣaṇa-dhyāna is classified into two categories: introspection of the passions (kaṣāya samīkṣaṇa) and samatā-samīkṣaṇa, which includes introspection of the senses (indriya samīkṣaṇa), introspection of the vow (vrata samīkṣaṇa) introspection of the karma (karma samīkṣaṇa), introspection of the Self (ātma samīkṣaṇa) and others.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=278-279}}

Bhadraṅkaravijaya (1903–1975) of the [[Tapa Gaccha|Tapāgaccha]] sect founded  “Sālambana Dhyāna” (Support Meditation). According to Samani Pratibha Pragya, most of these practices "seem to be a deritualisation of [[Puja (Hinduism)|pūjā]] in a meditative form, i.e. he recommended the mental performance of pūjā." These practices (totally 34 different meditations) focus on meditating on arihantas and can make use of mantras, hymns (stotra), statues (mūrti) and diagrams (yantra). {{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=284}}

Ācārya Śivamuni (b. 1942) of the Śramaṇa Saṅgha is known for his contribution of “Ātma Dhyāna” (Self-Meditation). The focus in this system is directly meditating on the nature of the self, making use of the mantra ''so’ham'' and using the [[Acharanga Sutra|Acaranga sutra]] as the main doctrinal source.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|p=295}}

Muni Candraprabhasāgara (b. 1962) introduced “Sambodhi Dhyāna” (Enlightenment-Meditation) in 1997. It mainly makes use of the mantra [[Om]], breathing meditation, the chakras and other yogic practices.{{sfn|Pragya|2017|pp=297-300}}

== ''Sāmāyika'' ==
[[File:Jain meditation.jpg|thumb|Jain nuns meditating]]
{{Main article|Sāmāyika}}
The name ''Sāmāyika'', the term for Jain meditation, is derived from the term ''samaya'' "time" in [[Prakrit]]. Jains also use ''samayika'' to denote the practice of meditation. The aim of ''Sāmāyika'' is to transcend our daily experiences as the "constantly changing" human beings, called [[Jiva]], and allow identification with the "changeless" reality in practitioner, called the [[atman (Jainism)|atman]]. One of the main goals of ''Sāmāyika'' is to inculcate equanimity, to see all the events equanimously. It encourages to be consistently spiritually vigilant. ''Sāmāyika'' is practiced in all the Jain sects and communities.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}} Samayika is an important practice during [[Paryushana]], a special eight- or ten-day period.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== For Householders ===
In Jainism, six essential duties are prescribed for a ''[[Śrāvaka (Jainism)|śrāvaka]]'' (householder), out of which one duty is ''Samayika''. These help the laity in achieving the principle of ''[[Ahimsa in Jainism|ahimsa]]'' which is necessary for his/her spiritual upliftment.&lt;!--{{sfn|Jain|2012|p=v}}--&gt; The ''sāmayika vrata'' (vow to meditate) is intended to be observed three times a day if possible; other-wise at least once daily. Its objective is to enable the ''śrāvaka'' to abstain from all kinds of sins during the period of time fixed for its observance. The usual duration of the ''sāmayika'' vow is an ''antara mūharta'' (a period of time not exceeding 48 minutes). {{sfn|Jain|1917|p=44}} During this period, which the layman spends in study and meditation, he vows to refrain from the commission of the five kinds of sin — injury, falsehood, theft, unchastity and love of material possessions in any of the three ways. These three ways are:&lt;!--{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=27, 44}}--&gt;- 
*by an act of mind, speech or body (''krita''), 
*inciting others to commit such an act (''kārita''),
*approving the commission of such an act by others (''anumodanā'').

In performing ''sāmayika'' the ''śrāvaka'' has to stand facing north or east and bow to the ''[[Pañca-Parameṣṭhi]]''.&lt;!--{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=44, 61}}--&gt; He then sit down and recites the [[Namokara mantra]] a certain number of times, and finally devotes himself to holy meditation. This consists in:&lt;!--{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=45}}--&gt;
*''pratikramana'', recounting the sins committed and repenting for them, 
*''pratyākhyanā'', resolving to avoid particular sins in future, 
*''sāmayika karma'', renunciation of personal attachments, and the cultivation of a feeling of regarding every body and thing alike, 
*''stuti'', praising the four and twenty Tīrthankaras, 
*''vandanā'', devotion to a particular ''Tirthankara'', and 
*''[[Kayotsarga|kāyotsarga]]'', withdrawal of attention from the body (physical personality) and becoming absorbed in the contemplation of the spiritual Self.
''Sāmayika'' can be performed anywhere- a temple, private residence, forest and the like. But the place shouldn't be open to disturbance.{{sfn|Jain|1917|p=45}} According to the Jain text, [[Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra]], while performing ''sāmayika'', one should meditate on:{{quote|"I am involved in the ''[[Saṃsāra (Jainism)|saṃsāra]]'' (cycle of transmigration) in which there is no protection for souls, which is inauspicious, transitory and full of pain, and of the nature of not-Self; ''[[Moksha (Jainism)|moksha]]'' is the opposite of this"-thus should one meditate while performing ''sāmayika''.|Ratnakaranda śrāvakācāra (104)}}

=== For ascetics ===
The ascetic has to perform the ''sāmāyika'' three times a day. [[Champat Rai Jain]] in his book, ''The Key of Knowledge'' wrote:{{quote|The ascetic who has successfully passed through the preliminary stages of renunciation, as a householder, is expected to be an embodiment of desirelessness itself, so that his whole life is, as it were, a continuous ''sāmāyika'' from one end to the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jain|first1=Champat Rai|authorlink=Champat Rai Jain|title=The Key Of Knowledge|date=1975|publisher=Today and Tomorrow's Printers|location=New Delhi|edition=Fourth|url=https://archive.org/details/keyofknowledge|p=254–255}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Satya Sadhna meditation==

In 1017 Shreepujya Shree Vardhamana Suri&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzEzXDk0v6sC&amp;pg=PA383&amp;dq=jainism#v=onepage&amp;q=jainism&amp;f=false|title=Jainism: An Indian Religion of Salvation|last=Glasenapp|first=Helmuth|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass Publishers|year=1999|isbn=9788120813762|location=Delhi|pages=389}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Kharatara Gaccha]] - one of [[Śvētāmbara|Shvetambara]] [[Murtipujaka]] [[Gaccha]] sect revived the meditation [https://www.satyasadhna.com/ Satya Sadhna] and, since then, it has been a part of [[Kharatara Gaccha]] ever since. Satya Sadhna follows the processes of meditation in the Jain context based on the Tripadi&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=1JjXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tripadi+jainism&amp;dq=tripadi+jainism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjc4PujoNTZAhWIuY8KHYt-BB8Q6AEILTAB|title=Jainism|last=Tatia|first=Nathmal|last2=Talib|first2=Gurbachan Singh|date=1975|publisher=Punjabi University|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and its expansion-explanations in the [[Jain Agamas|Agamas]]. 

One exposition of the Tripadi is explained as:{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}  

# Upaneyi Va (appearance): There emerges a new phase of matter. This is called emergence of new mode.
# Vighaneyi Va (disappearance): The old mode vanishes. This is called Disappearance of old mode.
# Dhuveyi Va (permanence): Original qualities of the matter remain constant.

==Meditation techniques==
According to the some commonly practiced ''yoga'' systems, high concentration is reached by meditating in an easy (preferably lotus) posture in seclusion and staring without blinking at the rising sun, a point on the wall, or the tip of the nose, and as long as one can keep the mind away from the outer world, this strengthens concentration. ''Garuda'' is the name Jainism gives to the yoga of self-discipline and discipline of mind, body and speech, so that even earth, water, fire and air can come under one’s control. ''Śiva'' is in Jainism control over the passions and the acquisition of such self-discipline that under all circumstances equanimity is maintained.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

''Prānayāma'' – breathing exercises – are performed to strengthen the flows of life energy. Through this, the elements of the constitution – earth, water, fire and air – are also strengthened. At the same time the five ''chakras'' are controlled. ''Prānayāma'' also helps to stabilize one’s thinking and leads to unhampered direct experience of the events around us.&lt;ref&gt;name="HN4U"{{cite book|authors=Dr. Rudi Jansma, Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key|title=Introduction To Jainism|publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India|year=2006|chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (2)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Next one practices ''pratyāhāra''. Pratyāhāra means that one directs the senses away from the enjoyment of sensual and mental objects. The senses are part of the nervous system, and their task is to send data to the brain through which the mind as well as the soul is provided with information. The mind tends to enjoy this at the cost of the soul as well as the body. ''Pratyāhāra'' is obtained by focusing the mind on one point for the purpose of receiving impulses: on the [[human eye|eye]]s, [[ear]]s, tip of the [[Human nose|nose]], the brow, the [[navel]], the [[head]], the [[human heart|heart]] or the [[palate]].&lt;ref name="Introduction To Jainism"&gt;name="HN4U"{{cite book|authors=Dr. Rudi Jansma, Dr. Sneh Rani Jain Key|title=Introduction To Jainism|publisher=Prakrit Bharti Academy, jaipur, India|year=2006|chapter=07 Yoga and Meditation (1)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contemplation is an important wing in Jain meditation. The practitioner meditates or reflects deeply on subtle facts or philosophical aspects. The first type is ''Agnya vichāya'', in which one meditates deeply on the seven elementary facts - life and non-life, the inflow, bondage, stoppage and removal of ''karmas'', and the final accomplishment of liberation. The second is ''Apaya vichāya'', in which incorrect insights and behavior in which “sleeping souls” indulge, are reflected upon. The third is ''Vipaka vichāya dharma dhyāna'', in which one reflects on the eight causes or basic types of ''karma''. The fourth is ''Sansathan vichāya dharma dhyāna'', when one thinks about the vastness of the [[universe]] and the loneliness of the soul, which has had to face the results of its own causes all alone.&lt;ref name="Introduction To Jainism"/&gt; A few important contemplation themes in [[Preksha meditation]] are - Impermanence, Solitariness, Vulnerability.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}
[[File:Jain pindāstha meditation.jpg|thumb|right|Picture depicting Pindastha Dhyana]]

In ''pindāstha-dhyāna'' one imagines oneself sitting all alone in the middle of a vast [[ocean]] of [[milk]] on a [[Lotus Flower|lotus]] flower, meditating on the soul. There are no living beings around whatsoever. The lotus is identical to ''Jambūdvīpa'', with Mount ''Meru'' as its stalk. Next the meditator imagines a 16-petalled lotus at the level of his [[navel]], and on each petal are printed the (Sanskrit) letters “arham“ and also an inverted lotus of 8 petals at the location of his [[heart]]. Suddenly the lotus on which one is seated flares up at the navel and flames gradually rise up to the inverted lotus, burning its petals with a rising [[gold (color)|gold]]en [[flame]] which not only burns his or her body, but also the inverted lotus at the heart. The flames rise further up to the [[throat]] whirling in the shape of a swastika and then reach the head, burning it entirely, while taking the form of a three-sided pyramid of golden flames above the head, piercing the [[human skull|skull]] sharp end straight up. The whole physical body is charred, and everything turns into glowing ashes. Thus the ''pinda'' or body is burnt off and the pure soul survives. Then suddenly a strong wind blows off all the ashes; and one imagines that a heavy rain shower washes all the ashes away, and the pure soul remains seated on the lotus. That pure Soul has infinite virtues, it is Myself. Why should I get polluted at all? One tries to remain in his purest nature. This is called ''pindāstha dhyāna'', in which one ponders the reality of feeling and experiencing.&lt;ref name="Introduction To Jainism"/&gt;

In ''padāstha dhyāna'' one focuses on some [[mantras]], words or themes. Couple of important [[mantra]] examples are, OM - it signifies remembrance of the five classes of spiritual beings (the embodied and non-embodied Jinas, the ascetics, the monks and the nuns), pronouncing the word “Arham” makes one feel “I myself am the omniscient soul” and one tries to improve one’s character accordingly. One may also pronounce the holy name of an ''arhat'' and concentrate on the universal richness of the soul.&lt;ref name="Introduction To Jainism"/&gt;

In ''rūpāstha dhyāna'' one reflects on the embodiments of [[arihant (Jainism)|arihant]]s, the svayambhuva (the self-realized), the omniscients and other enlightened people and their attributes, such as three umbrellas and whiskers – as seen in many icons – unconcerned about one’s own body, but almighty and benevolent to all living beings, destroyer of attachment, enmity, etc. Thus the meditator as a human being concentrates his or her attention on the virtues of the omniscients to acquire the same virtues for himself.&lt;ref name="Introduction To Jainism"/&gt;

''Rūpātita dhyāna'' is a meditation in which one focuses on bodiless objects such as the liberated souls or [[siddha]]s, which stand individually and collectively for the infinite qualities that such souls have earned. That omniscient, potent, omnipresent, liberated and untainted soul is called a ''nirañjāna'', and this stage can be achieved by right vision, right knowledge and right conduct only. Right vision, right knowledge and right conduct begin the fourth stage of the 14-fold path.&lt;ref name="Introduction To Jainism"/&gt;

The ultimate aim of such yoga and meditation is to pave the way for the spiritual elevation and salvation of the soul. Some yogis develop their own methods for meditation.

'''James H. Austin''' is an American neurologist and author. He is the author of the book ''[[Zen and the Brain]]''. It establishes links between the neurophysiology of the [[human brain]] and the practice of [[meditation]], and won the Scientific and Medical Network Book Prize for 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/Zen-Brain-Understanding-Meditation-Consciousness/dp/0262511096|title=Zen and the Brain: Toward an Understanding of Meditation and Consciousness [Paperback]|work=Amazon.com|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has written five sequels: ''Zen-Brain Reflections'' (2006), ''Selfless Insight'' (2009), ''Meditating Selflessly'' (2011), ''Zen-Brain Horizons'' (2014) and ''Living Zen Remindfully'' (2016).

==Career==
Austin has been an academic neurologist for most of his career, first at the [[University of Oregon Medical School]], then as chairman of neurology at the [[University of Colorado School of Medicine]]. He is currently Emeritus  professor of neurology at the University of Colorado Medical School, Denver and visiting professor of neurology at the [[University of Florida School of Medicine]]. His publications number over 140 articles involving research in the areas of clinical neurology, neuropathology, neurochemistry and neuropharmacology.&lt;ref name="Upaya"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upaya.org/about/bio/james-austin-md |title=Guest teacher: James Austin, M.D. |work=Upaya Institute and Zen Center |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120409110602/http://www.upaya.org/about/bio/james-austin-md |archivedate= 9 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Experience with Zen==

Austin has been a practicing Zen Buddhist since 1974. He began in Kyoto at [[Daitoku-ji]] as a student of the [[Rinzai]] [[Rōshi|roshi]] [[Kobori Nanrei Sohaku]].&lt;ref name = "Upaya" /&gt;

After eight years of regular Zen meditation, Austin experienced the taste of what Zen practice calls ''[[kenshō]]''. The chief characteristic of this experience was a loss of the sense of "self" which is so central to human identity, plus a feeling that "Just This" is the way all things really are in the world. While he was on a sabbatical in England, he was waiting for an Underground train when he suddenly entered a state of enlightenment unlike anything he had ever experienced. In Austin's words, "It strikes unexpectedly at 9 am on the surface platform of the London subway system. [Due to a mistake] ... I wind up at a station where I have never been before...The view includes the dingy interior of the station, some grimy buildings, a bit of open sky above and beyond. Instantly the entire view acquires three qualities: Absolute Reality, Intrinsic Rightness, Ultimate Perfection."

"With no transition, it is all complete....Yes, there is the paradox of this extraordinary viewing. But there is no viewer. The scene is utterly empty, stripped of every last extension of an I-Me-Mine [his name for ego-self]. Vanished in one split second is the familiar sensation that this person is viewing an ordinary city scene. The new viewing proceeds impersonally, not pausing to register the paradox that there is no human subject "doing" it. Three insights penetrate the experient, each conveying Total Understanding at depths far beyond simple knowledge: This is the eternal state of affairs. There is nothing more to do. There is nothing whatsoever to fear."

Austin writes that when his former subjective self was no longer there to form biased interpretations this experience conveyed the impression of "objective reality." As a neurologist, he interpreted this experience not as proof of a reality beyond the comprehension of our senses but as arising from the brain itself.  This and other experiences and research led him to write ''Zen and the Brain''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cognitiveliberty.org/neuro/neuronewswk.htm|title=Your Brain on Religion: Mystic visions or brain circuits at work?|last=Begley|first=Sharon|date=May 7, 2001|work=Newsweek, cited at Center for Cognitive Liberty and Ethics|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Jan Hus Memorial''' stands at one end of [[Old Town Square (Prague)|Old Town Square]], Prague in the [[Czech Republic]]. The huge monument depicts victorious [[Hussite]] warriors and [[Protestants]] who were forced into exile 200 years after Hus in the wake of the lost [[Battle of the White Mountain]] during the [[Thirty Years' War]], and a young mother who symbolises national rebirth. The monument was so large that the sculptor designed and built [[Šaloun's Villa|his own villa and studio]] where the work could be carried out.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt; It was unveiled in 1915 to commemorate the 500th anniversary of [[Jan Hus]]' martyrdom. The memorial was designed by [[Ladislav Šaloun]] and paid for solely by public donations. 

Born in 1369, Hus became an influential religious thinker, philosopher, and reformer in Prague. He was a key predecessor to the [[Protestant Reformation|Protestant movement]] of the sixteenth century. In his works he criticized religious moral decay of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, the Czech patriot Hus believed that mass should be given in the vernacular, or local language, rather than in Latin. He was inspired by the teachings of [[John Wycliffe]]. In the following century, Hus was followed by many other reformers - e.g. [[Martin Luther]], [[John Calvin]] and [[Huldrych Zwingli]]. Hus was ultimately condemned by the [[Council of Constance]] and burned at the stake in 1415. This led to the [[Hussite Wars]].

==Symbolism==
[[File:Marian column destroyed, Prague.jpg|right|thumb|Destroyed Marian Column in Prague]]

To the people of [[Bohemia]] and other regions around [[Prague]],  [[Jan Hus]] became a symbol of dissidence and a symbol of strength against oppressive regimes.  His opposition to church control by the Vatican gave strength to those who opposed control of Czech lands by the [[Habsburgs]] in the 19th century, and Hus soon became a symbol of anti-Habsburg rule. He is said to stand arrogantly in the square in defiance of the cathedral before him.&lt;ref name=radio/&gt; In 1918, a [[Marian and Holy Trinity columns|Marian Column]] that had been erected in the square shortly after the [[Thirty Years' War]] was demolished in celebration of [[Origins of Czechoslovakia|independence]] from the [[Habsburg monarchy]].

When [[Czechoslovakia]] was under Communist rule, sitting at the feet of the Jan Hus memorial became a way of quietly expressing one's opinion and opposition against the Communist rule.

The memorial was restored in 2007.&lt;ref name=radio&gt;[http://www.radio.cz/en/section/czechs/sculptor-ladislav-saloun Sculptor Ladislav Saloun], radio.cz, 2007, Pavla Horáková, retrieved 6 November 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

==Another statue of Jan Hus==

'''Jason Barker''' is a British theorist of contemporary [[French philosophy]], a film director, screenwriter and producer. He is a professor of cultural studies at [[Kyung Hee University]] in the Graduate School of British and American Language and Culture,&lt;ref name="gradenglish.khu.ac.kr"&gt;http://gradenglish.khu.ac.kr/contents/bbs/bbs_content.html?bbs_cls_cd=003002&lt;/ref&gt; and visiting professor at the [[European Graduate School]],&lt;ref name="egs.edu"&gt;http://www.egs.edu/faculty/jason-barker/biography/&lt;/ref&gt; where he teaches in the Faculty of Media and Communication alongside [[Alain Badiou]], [[Judith Butler]], [[Jacques Rancière]], [[Avital Ronell]], [[Slavoj Žižek]], and others.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.egs.edu/faculty&lt;/ref&gt;

Most notable for his translation and introductions to the philosophy of Alain Badiou, Barker draws on an eclectic range of influences including [[Neoplatonism]], [[Lacanian psychoanalysis]] and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barker, "Topography and Structure".&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in both the English and French [[languages]], Barker has also contributed to debates in [[post-Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;See Barker, "De L'État au Maître: Badiou et le post-marxisme".&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in ''[[The Guardian]]'' in February 2012, Barker criticised the selective interpretation of [[Karl Marx]]'s writings by economists such as [[Nouriel Roubini]] when responding to the [[Great Recession|global recession]]. According to Barker such interpretations water down the revolutionary aspects of Marx's ideas and focus unduly on their reformist tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/feb/02/karl-marx-therapy-for-bankers Karl Marx is never going to provide therapy for bankers at [[The Guardian]]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Writing in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on the occasion of the Marx bicentennial anniversary, Barker argued that "The key factor in Marx’s intellectual legacy in our present-day society is not 'philosophy' but 'critique,' or what he described in 1843 as 'the ruthless criticism of all that exists: ruthless both in the sense of not being afraid of the results it arrives at and in the sense of being just as little afraid of conflict with the powers that be.'"&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/30/opinion/karl-marx-at-200-influence.html Happy Birthday, Karl Marx. You Were Right! at [[The New York Times]]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

==''Marx Returns''==

Barker is the author of ''[[Marx Returns]]''. The story focuses on the life of [[Karl Marx]] and his struggle to write his major work on [[political economy]], ''[[Das Kapital|Capital]]''. [[Philosopher]] [[Ray Brassier]] described it as "Curious, funny, perplexing, and irreverent,"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.zero-books.net/books/marx-returns]&lt;/ref&gt; and according to [[Nina Power]], reviewing the work in the ''[[Los Angeles Review of Books]]'', ''Marx Returns'' is "an imaginative, uplifting, and sometimes disturbing alternative history."&lt;ref&gt;[https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/time-and-freedom-in-jason-barkers-marx-returns/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Marx Reloaded''==

Barker is the writer, director and producer of the 2011 partly animated documentary film ''[[Marx Reloaded]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/92193/marx-reloaded.html Film review at [[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]]]&lt;/ref&gt; which considers the relevance of Karl Marx's ideas in the aftermath of the global [[economic and financial crisis of 2008—09]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxreloaded.com/film.html ''Marx Reloaded'' official website]&lt;/ref&gt; The film includes interviews with several distinguished [[philosophers]] including [[Michael Hardt]], [[Antonio Negri]], Nina Power, Jacques Rancière, [[John N. Gray]], [[Alberto Toscano]], [[Peter Sloterdijk]] and [[Slavoj Žižek]].

''[[The London Evening Standard]]'' cited the film alongside the 2012 re-edition of the ''[[Communist Manifesto]]'' and [[Owen Jones (writer)|Owen Jones]]' best-selling book ''[[Chavs: The Demonization of the Working Class|Chavs]]'' as evidence of a resurgence of left-wing ideas.&lt;ref name="The London Evening Standard"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/lifestyle/london-life/the-marx-effect-7669766.html | title=The Marx effect | work=[[The London Evening Standard]] | date=23 April 2012 | accessdate=8 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

British philosopher [[Simon Critchley]] has described ''Marx Reloaded'' as "a great introduction to Marx for a new generation",&lt;ref name="Icarus Films"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://icarusfilms.com/new2012/mrx.html | title=Marx Reloaded | work=Icarusfilms.com | date= | accessdate=11 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while German political scientist [[Herfried Münkler]] has called it "the type of film that Marx himself would have approved of".&lt;ref name="egs.edu"/&gt;

'''''Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium''''' is a 1999 book by leading New Testament scholar [[Bart D. Ehrman]]. In it, he argues that Jesus was an [[Apocalypse|apocalyptic]] preacher, i.e., his main message was that the end of history was near, that God would shortly intervene to overthrow evil and establish his rule on earth, and that [[Jesus]] and his disciples all believed these end time events would occur in their lifetimes. Ehrman also analyses New Testament passages such as Jesus' supposed birth in Bethlehem of a virgin and finds them not historically credible.&lt;ref name=Kirkus&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/bart-ehrman/jesus-apocalypic-prophet-of-the-new-millennium/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PW&gt;{{cite web|title=Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-19-512473-6|publisher=Publisher's Weekly|accessdate=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ehrman&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrman|first=Bart D.|title=Jesus: Apocalyptic Prophet of the New Millennium|date=1999|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0195124743}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kenneth Carleton Frazier''' (born {{Birth date|1954|12|17}}) is an American business executive. He is the [[chairman]] and [[Chief executive officer|CEO]] of the pharmaceutical company [[Merck &amp; Co.]] (known as MSD outside of North America). After joining Merck &amp; Co. as general counsel, he directed the company's defense against litigation over the anti-inflammatory drug [[Vioxx]]. Frazier is the first black man to lead a major pharmaceutical company. He was elected to the [[American Philosophical Society]] in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amphilsoc.org/blog/election-new-members-2018-spring-meeting&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Kenneth Frazier was born on December 17, 1954, in North Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=ha1 /&gt; His father, Otis, was a janitor.&lt;ref name=ha1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=chen1 /&gt; Frazier has said [[Thurgood Marshall]] was one of his heroes growing up.&lt;ref name=hepp1 /&gt; Frazier's mother died when he was twelve years old.&lt;ref name=ha1 /&gt; He attended [[Julia R. Masterman School]]{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} and Northeast High School. After graduating at age 16, he entered [[Pennsylvania State University]].&lt;ref name=hepp1 /&gt; To make extra money in college, he raised tadpoles and newts and sold them to local stores.&lt;ref name=dd /&gt;

After earning his B.A. from Penn State, Frazier enrolled at [[Harvard University]] to study law.&lt;ref name=whitehouse2013sep18 /&gt; He graduated in 1978 with a J.D.&lt;ref name=chen1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=whitehouse2013sep18 /&gt;

==Career==

===Drinker Biddle===
After graduating from Harvard, Frazier began his law career with [[Drinker Biddle &amp; Reath]] in Philadelphia.&lt;ref name=hepp1 /&gt; In 1991, Esther F. Lardent, head of the Death Penalty Representation Project, asked Frazier to defend death row inmate James Willie "Bo" Cochran.&lt;ref name=ha1 /&gt; Cochran had been arrested and accused of murdering an assistant manager at a Birmingham grocery store in 1976.&lt;ref name=rogers1 /&gt; Frazier, then a partner at Drinker Biddle, and two colleagues took the case.&lt;ref name=dd /&gt; In 1995, after 19 years on death row, the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit|United States Courts of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit]] overturned Cochran's conviction. In 1997, Cochran was retried and found not guilty.&lt;ref name=rogers1 /&gt; Frazier continued to represent him after leaving Drinker Biddle. During Frazier's law career, he also took four summer sabbaticals to teach trial advocacy in South Africa.&lt;ref name=chen1 /&gt;

===Merck &amp; Co.===
As a lawyer at Drinker Biddle, one of Frazier's clients was [[Merck &amp; Co.]], the second-largest drug company in the United States.&lt;ref name=hepp1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=dd /&gt; In 1992, he joined Merck &amp; Co.'s public affairs division as general counsel.&lt;ref name=hepp1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=randall1 /&gt; Frazier was named senior general counsel in 1999.&lt;ref name=pierson1 /&gt; As general counsel, he was credited with overseeing the company's defense against claims that the anti-inflammatory drug [[Rofecoxib|Vioxx]] had caused heart attacks and strokes.&lt;ref name=dd /&gt;&lt;ref name=pierson1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=koppel1 /&gt; Analysts at the time estimated Merck &amp; Co.'s liability to range from 20 to 50 billion dollars.&lt;ref name=dd3 /&gt; Frazier said the case was "the most significant challenge [he'd] ever faced."&lt;ref name=dd /&gt; He chose to fight all cases in court rather than settle them all quickly.&lt;ref name=randall1 /&gt; The remaining cases were settled in 2007 for $4.85 billion.&lt;ref name=pierson1 /&gt;

In 2006, Frazier was promoted to executive vice president in addition to his role as general counsel.&lt;ref name=pierson1/&gt; He led the company's largest group, human health, from 2007 until he was named president of Merck &amp; Co. in April 2010.&lt;ref name=hepp1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ap2010nov30 /&gt; On January 1, 2011, he became CEO and a member of the company's board of directors, replacing former Merck &amp; Co. CEO Richard Clark.&lt;ref name=hepp1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=ap2010dec01 /&gt; Frazier is the first African-American to lead a major pharmaceutical company.&lt;ref name=ha1 /&gt;

As CEO, Frazier has directed the company to take financial risks in developing new treatments.&lt;ref name=dd3 /&gt; In 2013, he prioritized research funding over meeting the year's earnings target.&lt;ref name=randall1 /&gt; He has placed special emphasis on improving treatments for [[Alzheimer's disease]]. Frazier's father died from Alzheimer's. Frazier has said he is also motivated at Merck &amp; Co. by a desire to improve the lives of people in developing countries.&lt;ref name=dd3 /&gt;

Frazier received a total compensation of $21,387,205 in 2014; $17,023,820 in 2015; and $21,781,200 in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www1.salary.com/Kenneth-C-Frazier-Salary-Bonus-Stock-Options-for-MERCK-CO.html|title=Compensation Information for Kenneth C.

== Licensing litigation ==
{{POV|date=November 2017}}
Under the leadership of Kenneth Frazier, Merck has been convicted of multiple drug patent infringements.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/business/hiltzik/la-fi-hiltzik-merck-gilead-20160608-snap-story.html|title=Big Pharma bombshell: Judge finds Merck lied in patent trial, overturns $200-million verdict|last=Hiltzik|first=Michael|date=2016-06-09|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-settlement-bristolmyers-idUSKBN1542VO|title=Merck, Bristol-Myers agree to settle Keytruda patent suit|date=2017-01-20|work=Reuters|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Merck deceptively obtained the formula to [[Sovaldi]] over a conference call with Pharmasset.  In March 2004, Pharmasset was willing to reveal details of its formulas on the call because it was led to believe everyone on the call would be subject to the confidentiality agreement. But the participants included Merck patent attorney Phillippe Durette, who wasn't firewalled and was in a position to turn what he heard into a potential goldmine for Merck.  Durette lied about being on the conference call under oath and then Merck's legal team advised him to blame it on poor memory. In a deposition, he repeatedly denied having been on the call. He recanted at trial only after he was confronted with notes taken by a Pharmasset employee during the call, proving that he had participated. At that point, he pleaded a faulty memory. Judge Freeman didn't buy it. "It is overwhelmingly clear...," she ruled, "that Dr. Durette sought at every turn to create the false impression that Merck's conduct was aboveboard." She blamed Merck, which she said "sponsored and encouraged" his conduct, then sought to minimize its importance by attributing the fiasco to "the failed memory of a retired employee." Federal Judge Beth Labson Freeman described the company's behavior as "systematic and outrageous deception in conjunction with unethical business practices and litigation misconduct." That conduct included "lying to Pharmasset, misusing Pharmasset's confidential information, breaching confidentiality and firewall agreements, and lying under oath at deposition and trial." &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://bol.bna.com/a-merck-lawyers-failed-memory-rings-hollow-judge-rules/|title=A Merck Lawyer's 'Failed Memory Rings Hollow,' Judge Rules|access-date=2017-08-15|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 2017, Merck &amp; Co said it agreed to enter into a settlement and license agreement with Bristol-Myers Squibb Co and Ono Pharmaceutical Co Ltd to resolve all global patent-infringement litigation related to its cancer drug, Keytruda. Bristol and Ono, which co-developed the first PD-1 antibody called Opdivo, filed the suit against Merck in September 2014, alleging that its sale of Keytruda, also a PD-1 antibody, infringed their patents in markets including the United States, parts of Europe, Australia and Japan. Merck will make an initial payment of $625 million to Bristol and Japan's Ono. The company will also pay a 6.5-percent royalty rate on Keytruda sales from January 2017 to December 2023, and a 2.5-percent rate for the subsequent three years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-merck-settlement-bristolmyers-idUSKBN1542VO|title=Merck, Bristol-Myers agree to settle Keytruda patent suit|date=January 20, 2017|work=Reuters|accessdate=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first two months of 2017, sales of Keytruda in the US jumped to roughly $260 million, an 80-percent increase compared with the same period last year, according to IMS, a data provider that tracks medicine sales.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/86c84d7a-1621-11e7-80f4-13e067d5072c?mhq5j=e1|title=Subscribe to read|last=|first=|date=|website=Financial Times|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other work==
In November 2011, the Penn State Board of Trustees appointed Frazier (a trustee) to serve as chairman of a special committee investigation into the [[Penn State sex abuse scandal|child sex abuse scandal]] involving former assistant football coach [[Jerry Sandusky]] and allegations of a cover up by university officials.&lt;ref name=sisak1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;NJ Advance Media for NJ.com, Matthew Stanmyre, [http://www.nj.com/sports/index.ssf/2011/11/penn_state_appoints_kenneth_fr.html Penn State appoints Kenneth Frazier to lead special committee investigating child sex-abuse scandal], (November 11, 2011).&lt;/ref&gt; Frazier was criticized by [[Harrisburg, Pennsylvania|Harrisburg]] attorney William Cluck for his handling of the Sandusky scandal, particularly its decision to rely on the Freeh report, which found emails suggesting that university leaders, including head football coach [[Joe Paterno]], knew of reports of Sandusky's sex abuse but failed to report it. At a meeting, when Cluck questioned the Freeh report, Frazier directed a fiery criticism at Cluck and Paterno defenders,&lt;ref name=thompson1/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawson"&gt;Mike Dawson, [http://www.centredaily.com/news/local/education/penn-state/board-of-trustees/article42817845.html Penn State trustee Frazier bashes critics, dismisses Paterno report in spat with candidate], ''Centre Daily Times'' (March 15, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt; saying, "I believe that we are entitled to look at the words and contemporaneous emails and other documents that draw the conclusions that we need to draw as a university. We are not subject to the criminal beyond-a-reasonable-doubt standard. ... If you cared about that, you are one of the few people in this country that looks like you who actually believes the [[O. J. Simpson murder case|O.J. Simpson not guilty verdict]] was correct. The fact of the matter is, those documents say what they say, and no amount of hand-waving will ever change what those documents say."&lt;ref name="Dawson"/&gt; Frazier twice apologized for the outburst.&lt;ref name="apology_2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bkconnection.com/bkblog/john-kador/apology-of-the-week-penn-state-trustee-and-merck-ceo-kenneth-frazier-apologizes|title=Apology of the Week: Penn State Trustee and Merck &amp; Co.

Frazier is a member of the [[American Law Institute]] and serves on its council. In May 2013, he delivered the keynote speech at the ALI Annual Dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JDfalLJPYI4|title=Remarks by Kenneth C. Frazier at ALI Annual Dinner.|first=|last=AmericanLawInstitute|date=24 May 2013|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Frazier was a member of the President Trump's [[American Manufacturing Council]]. He resigned from the Council on August 14, 2017,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CEOs of Under Armour, Intel &amp; Merch [sic] quit Trump's manufacturing council|url=http://www.fox4now.com/news/national/under-armour-ceo-quits-trumps-manufacturing-council|website=fox4now.com|publisher=CNN|accessdate=15 August 2017|date=August 14, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the violent [[2017 Unite the Right rally]] in Virginia. In a statement, Frazier said that he objected to Trump's statement that "many sides" were responsible for violence. Frazier stated, "America's leaders must honor our fundamental views by clearly rejecting expressions of hatred, bigotry and group supremacy, which run counter to the American ideal that all people are created equal."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/us/politics/trump-charlottesville-protest.html|title=Trump Attacks Merck Chief Kenneth Frazier for Quitting Advisory Panel|newspaper=New York Times|date=August 14, 2017|author=Glenn Thrush}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Ross Sorkin / nytimes.com 14 August 2017: [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/14/business/dealbook/merck-trump-charlottesville-ceos.html ''Merck’s C.E.O.

'''Level of detail''' in writing, sometimes known as level of abstraction, refers to three concepts: the precision in using the right [[word]]s to form [[phrase]]s, clauses and sentences;&lt;ref&gt;p.204, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt; the generality of [[Statement (logic)|statements]]; and the organisational strategy in which authors [[Expository writing#Classification|arrange]] ideas according to a common topic in the [[hierarchy]] of detail. Placing different objects or ideas in categories is a type of classification in [[expert writing]] which allows more efficient cognitive retrieval of information by placing it in [[Context principle|context]].&lt;ref&gt;p.396, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt; Maintaining appropriate level of detail in any body of text is a part of ensuring that the cognitive effort required by the reader is appropriate to the general subject of the written as a whole. Authors use level of detail to maintain [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] in [[syntactic hierarchy]] in texts, such as a [[screenplay]]s.&lt;ref&gt;p.227, Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt; Continuity in text is achieved by using [[transitional expressions]] to move from one detail, or level of detail, to another.&lt;ref&gt;p.223, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the basic writing structure of ''introducing'', ''characterising'' and ''bringing to a close'' of any proper subject description,&lt;ref&gt;p.204, Wilson, Ferster-Glazie&lt;/ref&gt; level of detail is used in [[theme development]] during ''elaboration'', ''evaluation'' and ''adding context'' as a repertoire of retrieval strategies.&lt;ref&gt;p.395, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;  Van der Pool in 1995 had found that omission of detail in text structuring is an age-related effect that differentiates mature and young writers.&lt;ref&gt;pp.395-396, MacArthur, Graham, Fitzgerald&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the general rule that the level of detail must be both sufficient and appropriate
for the author's audience and their subject in literature intended for experts,&lt;ref&gt;p.25, Campbell&lt;/ref&gt; it is also used in primary and secondary education to assess student understanding.&lt;ref&gt;p.180, Levstik, Barton&lt;/ref&gt; In general the depth of detail is gradually developed to one appropriate for the subject.&lt;ref&gt;p.59, Alley&lt;/ref&gt;

The suggested list in identifying appropriate level of detail may include&lt;ref&gt;p.25, Campbell&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sufficiency of information for the reader to exercise good judgement about the subject
* Sufficiency of information for the reader to take appropriate action
* Correctness of the information based on type of data
* Correctness of the information based on audience
* Level of detail appropriateness to the subject
* Level of detail appropriateness to the audience in size, required knowledge for comprehension or experience

Presenting the reader with specific details without first introducing it with general statements can be dangerous because it omits a [[Grammatical modifier|qualifier]], and therefore introduces elements that invite questions and create confusion.&lt;ref&gt;p.80, Alley&lt;/ref&gt;

Level of detail is often important in [[technical writing]] due to the need to differentiate between different levels of audience need for information within the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;p.198, Alred, Brusaw, Oliu&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the engineering design process, writing also takes place by the author usually adopting either a top-down or a bottom-up process by identifying components of the text that become the focus subjects in the overall [[Theme (literature)|theme]].&lt;ref&gt;p.1018, Weik&lt;/ref&gt;

The content of a text is often assessed for its level of detail as ''high'', ''intermediate'' or ''low'' based on the objective of the author in addressing the needs of the audience. The highly detailed text refers to the bottom-up structuring design where &lt;blockquote&gt;
Facts that are generally available but not used frequently (and likely to be forgotten) should be included in this ideal level of writing.&lt;ref&gt;p.19, Harkins &amp; Plung&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt; This level of detail is appropriate for the subjects where expert specialist knowledge and understanding are required, and is often used in technical and [[scientific writing]], or in literary genres like [[science fiction]], [[biography|biographical writing]]  or [[military history]].

'''Lê Quý Đôn''' ({{linktext|lang=vi-Hani|黎|貴|惇}}; 1726–1784) was an 18th-century [[Vietnamese people|Vietnamese]] poet, encyclopedist, and government official. His pseudonym was Quế-Đường. He was a native of Duyen Ha village in present-day [[Thái Bình Province]]. He is considered one of the most outstanding and prolific Vietnamese savants of the [[early modern period]].&lt;ref&gt;Patricia M. Pelley ''Postcolonial Vietnam: New Histories of the National Past'' 2002 – Page 125 "The considerable merit bestowed on Lê Quý Ðôn stemmed from the astuteness of his work overall and his phenomenal productivity: he authored at least three chronicles, several volumes of poetry, two encyclopedic compilations, and.."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Bruce Lockhart]] ''A-Z of Vietnam'' 2010 p209 entry "Lê Quý Đôn"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Lê was born in the province of Thái Bình, and lived in the reign of Emperor [[Lê Hiển Tông]].
The period of his life was marked by a split between the [[Trịnh lords]] of the north and the [[Nguyễn lords]] of the south, followed by the [[Tây Sơn]] rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Essays Into Vietnamese Pasts – Page 158 Keith Weller Taylor, John K. Whitmore – 1995 "Lê Quý Đôn, in the aftermath of an examination system scandal involving his son Lê Quý Kiêt (who was sent to prison for changing examination books), had been ordered south of the Linh Giang River to serve as an official ...As a member of the Trịnh lords' bureaucracy, Lê Quý Đôn was supposed to help restore civil government in a region of Viet Nam that had been separate from the Trịnh lords' control for over two centuries, and facilitate the reincorporation of"&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1760, Lê Quý Đôn went to China as an ambassador. He later served as a government official in the ministries of war, finance and public works. He also served as the rector of the National University situated in the [[Temple of Literature, Hanoi|Văn Miếu]] in [[Hanoi]] and as Director of the Bureau of Annals. 
It is said that Lê was traveling with some Qing officials, and along the way they saw a Chinese poem inscribed on a stone palette. Later, one of the Qing officials, to test his merit, asked him if he could remember what was on the stone palette. Lê recited the entire poem, word for word, in Chinese. That earned him a great deal of respect from the Chinese.

==Writings==
Lê Quý Đôn was responsible for a large number of encyclopedic, historical, bibliographical, and philosophical works.
It is estimated that he has the largest volume of works among the old Chinese-language [[Vietnamese literature]] (about 40 series with hundreds of volumes).

* The ''[[Vân đài loại ngữ]]'' (Classified Sayings, 9 volumes) is Vietnam's largest encyclopedia, a landmark in Vietnamese science in the Confucian era. 
* The history ''[[Đại Việt thông sử]]'' (30 volumes) contains many documents about the [[Lê Dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;刘正 ''图说汉学史'' 2005 -Page 181 "著名的汉学家黎贵淳在《大越通史》一书中曾分析说: "我国号为文献之邦,上而帝王,下而庶民,莫不各有著述。"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Watson Andaya – Other pasts: women, gender and history in early modern Southeast Asia −2000  Page 223 "In particular, I use Le Quy Don's Dai Viet Thong Su [Complete History of Dai Viet] , the one effort by a Vietnamese scholar in the standard Chinese topical mode, and his chapter on the females of the early Le royal family.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;India's interaction with Southeast Asia – Volume 1, Part 3 – Page 11 Govind Chandra Pande, Project of History of Indian Science, Philosophy, and Culture, Centre for Studies in Civilizations (Delhi, India) – 2006 "One of the latest great figures was Le Quy Don (1726–84), who composed the following historical writings: the Dai-viet thong-su' ('History of Dai viet'), the Phu-bien tap- luc ('Miscellaneous writings about the administration of the border ..."&lt;/ref&gt;
* The ''[[Phủ biên tạp lục]]'' (Frontier Chronicles) (6 volumes) was a detailed description of Nguyễn territories in [[Thuận Hóa]] and [[Quảng Nam Province|Quảng Nam]] Provinces.

==Legacy==
[[File:STS Le Quy Don 1.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|STS "Lê Quý Đôn″ at the port of Gdynia, Poland, September 2015]]
Today, one of largest technical universities in Hanoi, [[Le Quy Don Technical University]] (LeTech), and many schools in Vietnam are named after him. Most cities in Vietnam have named major streets after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Vietnam Country Map |publisher=Periplus Travel Maps |year=2002|isbn=0-7946-0070-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, "Lê Quý Đôn″ is also the name of a new Vietnamese [[sail training ship]], built in 2015 by the Polish ship yard Marine Projects Ltd. on behalf of Polish Defence Holding in [[Gdynia]]. Some of its data: overall length: 65.0 m, breadth: 10.0 m, [[air draft]]: 42.0 m, sails area: 1395 m², propulsion: 880&amp;nbsp;kW, crew and cadets: 30 + 80 persons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2093">'''M. Nasroen''' (1907–1968) was an [[Indonesia]]n scholar in the field of [[philosophy]]. He is most famous for having identified and classified [[Indonesian philosophy]] as being separate and different from [[Western philosophy|Western]] and [[Eastern philosophy]]. Nasroen reached the peak of his philosophical career when he was chosen as an emeritus [[professor]] of philosophy at the [[University of Indonesia]] in [[Jakarta]], one of Indonesia's largest and most respected universities.

His 1967 book, ''Falsafah Indonesia'', laid the way for Indonesian scholars to start treating "Indonesian Philosophy" as a separate area of study. In it, Nasroen argues that the uniqueness of Indonesian philosophy is manifested in philosophical notions, such as ''mupakat'', ''pantun-pantun'', ''[[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]]'', ''[[adat|hukum adat]]'', ''ketuhanan'', ''[[gotong-royong]]'' ([[mutual aid (organization)|mutual aid]]), and ''kekeluargaan'' (''Falsafah Indonesia'' pp.14, 24, 25, 33, and 38).

Nasroen is also remembered for his work on the philosophy and the customs of the ''[[Minangkabau people|Minangkabau]]'' people of Indonesia's [[West Sumatra]] province, presented in his 1957 book ''Dasar Falsafah Adat Minangkabau''. This book is still commonly cited in the fields of [[women's studies]], such as in the writings of [[Feminist theory|feminist]] [[Ethnography|ethnographer]] [[Peggy Reeves Sanday]], as Nasroen's book was one of the first to explain the concept of [[matriarchy]] in the Minangkabau [[Matrilineality|matrilineal]] system.

'''Manuel DeLanda''' (born 1952) is a [[Mexico|Mexican]]-[[United States|American]] writer, artist and philosopher who has lived in [[New York, New York|New York]] since 1975. He is a lecturer in architecture at the [[Princeton University School of Architecture]] and the [[University of Pennsylvania School of Design]], where he teaches courses on the philosophy of urban history and the dynamics of cities as historical actors with an emphasis on the importance of self-organization and [[material culture]] in the understanding of a city. He also teaches [[architectural theory]] as an adjunct professor of architecture and urban design at the [[Pratt Institute]] and serves as the [[Gilles Deleuze]] Chair and Professor of Philosophy at the [[European Graduate School]].&lt;ref&gt;http://egs.edu/faculty/manuel-de-landa&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pratt.edu/faculty_and_staff/bio/?id=mdelanda |title=Pratt Institute |publisher=Pratt.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Manuel De Landa |url=https://www.design.upenn.edu/architecture/graduate/people/manuel-de-landa |title=Graduate Architecture &amp;#124; PennDesign |publisher=Design.upenn.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://soa.princeton.edu/content/manuel-delanda&lt;/ref&gt; He holds a [[Bachelor of Fine Arts|BFA]] from the [[School of Visual Arts]] (1979) and a [[PhD]] in media and communication from the European Graduate School (2010).

DeLanda was previously a visiting professor at the [[University of Southern California]] School of Architecture, where he taught an intensive two-week course in the spring 2012 term on [[self-organization]] and urbanity; adjunct associate professor at the [[Columbia Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation|Columbia University Graduate School of Architecture, Planning and Preservation]] from 1995 to 2006; and adjunct professor at [[Cooper Union]]'s Irwin S.

==Films==
After moving to New York, DeLanda created several experimental films between 1975 and 1982, some as part of an undergraduate coursework at the School of Visual Arts. While at SVA, DeLanda studied under video artist [[Joan Braderman]]; they were subsequently married in 1980 and collaborated on several works (including Braderman's ''Joan Does Dynasty'' [1986], DeLanda's ''Raw Nerves'' [1980] and ''Ismism'' [1979] ) before divorcing at an indeterminate point. Influenced by the [[No Wave]] movement, DeLanda's [[Super 8 mm film|Super 8]] and 16mm films also served as methodical, theory-based approaches to the form.&lt;ref name="Halter 2011"&gt;[[Ed Halter]]: [http://www.movingimagesource.us/articles/abstract-machines-20110304 "Abstract Machines. Nonlinear dynamics and the films of Manuel DeLanda"], Museum of the Moving Image, March 4, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He pulled them from circulation after the original negatives were lost; in 2011, [[Anthology Film Archives]] restored and reissued them.

Cited by filmmaker [[Nick Zedd]] in his [[Cinema of Transgression]] Manifesto, DeLanda associated with many of the experimental filmmakers of this New York based-movement. In 2010, he appeared in Céline Danhier's retrospective documentary ''Blank City''.&lt;ref&gt;{{imdb title|1398949|Blank City (2010)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of his oeuvre was inspired by his nascent interest in [[continental philosophy]] and [[critical theory]]; one of his best known films is ''Raw Nerves: A [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]ian Thriller'' (1980).

By the mid-1980s, DeLanda—having moved on to the non-deterministic synthesis of [[Jean Baudrillard|Baudrillardian]] and [[Gilles Deleuze|Deleuzian]] theory, [[Command and Control (Military)|command and control]] techniques, and [[materialist]]ic concerns of [[complex systems]] and [[artificial life]] (including [[cellular automata]]) that would comprise "Policing the Spectrum" (1986) and ''[[War in the Age of Intelligent Machines]]'' (1992)—had largely eschewed his interests in "post-[[Freudian]] ideas of the unconscious... as well as any interest in [[film theory]]."&lt;ref name="Halter 2011"/&gt;

==Philosophy==
DeLanda's notable works include ''[[War in the Age of Intelligent Machines]]'' (1991), ''A Thousand Years of Nonlinear History'' (1997), ''Intensive Science and Virtual Philosophy'' (2002) and ''[[A New Philosophy of Society|A New Philosophy of Society: Assemblage Theory and Social Complexity]]'' (2006). He has published many articles and essays and lectured extensively in Europe and in the United States. His work focuses on the theories of the French philosophers Gilles Deleuze and [[Félix Guattari]] on one hand,&lt;ref name="Halter 2011"/&gt; and modern [[science]], self-organizing matter, [[artificial life]] and [[artificial intelligence|intelligence]], [[economics]], [[architecture]], [[chaos theory]], [[history of science]], [[nonlinear dynamics]], [[cellular automaton|cellular automata]] on the other. His 2015 book ''Philosophical Chemistry: Genealogy of a Scientific Field'' furthers his intervention in the [[philosophy of science]] and [[science studies]].

'''Mary Maime O'Brien''' (July 8, 1926 – October 17, 1998) was a [[feminist]] [[political philosopher]].  She taught sociology and feminist social theory in Canada until her death. She was a founding member of the [[Feminist Party of Canada]].&lt;ref name="cxl"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Feminist Party of Canada|url=http://www.connexions.org/CxLibrary/CX2003.htm|website=www.connexions.org|publisher=Connexions|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mary was born in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, where she experienced the depression in the 1930s. After encountering the [[Fabian Society]] she was impressed by [[Beatrice Webb]] and joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] as a teenager.&lt;ref name="pr"&gt;{{cite book|last1=O'Brien|first1=Mary|title=The politics of reproduction|date=1981|publisher=Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul|location=London|accessdate=30 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|8}} She was a keen activist in the Labour Party but found her idealism shattered by the twin events of 1956: the [[Suez Crisis]] and the [[Soviet invasion of Hungary]].&lt;ref name="pr"/&gt;{{rp|9}} However her experience as a midwife in the industrial slums of [[Clydeside]] was to provide her with a sceptical outlook which she exhibited in her later philosophical work.&lt;ref name="pr"/&gt;{{rp|9}}

She emigrated to Canada in 1957,&lt;ref name="Prono"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prono|first1=Luca|editor1-last=O'Reilly|editor1-first=Andrea|title=O'Brien, Mary|journal=Encyclopedia of Motherhood|date=2010|publisher=SAGE Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|936}} where O'Brien first worked as a nurse and then completed graduate work in political philosophy.

==''The Politics of Reproduction''==
O'Brien wrote ''The Politics of Reproduction'' (1981), an important book in the development of feminist political theory. Starting from a Marxist materialist position, O'Brien's purpose was to connect inextricably Marx's concept of labour to produce objects to the act of giving birth, thereby placing women central in Marxist materialism as she re-defined it. Challenging the persistent denial of women's experiences in political theorizing, O'Brien proposed the relations of reproduction as essential to understanding human social and political endeavours. O'Brien's work identified the discovery of paternity as a precursor to such patriarchal institutions as marriage and sole male rights to offspring.

O'Brien's work theorizes birth, and although her arguments have at times been dismissed as essentialist, hers is rather an integration of necessary essentialism and social constructivism. She considered her main purpose in her writing and teaching to place women's experience at the centre of fundamental political discourse.

O'Brien's project extended familiar themes in feminist anthropology of the 1960s and 1970s and extends into radical sociology and anthropology of the 1980s. In the 1990s, her work was eclipsed by feminist philosophers who criticized her work as reducing women's experiences to biological determinism, thereby reducing the range of female experience to a single biological necessity. Explaining and exploring the origins of patriarchy, and offering a heuristic for the analysis of reproductive processes&amp;nbsp;– "moments"&amp;nbsp;– O'Brien created a conceptual framework for understanding the reproductive process: the dialectics of reproduction. She insisted on the standpoint of women, as Marx had assumed the standpoint of the proletariat. She introduced into contemporary social and political theory the expression "[[malestream]]" in reference to traditional, mainstream political and philosophical Western thought.

==Technology and reproduction==
In the last years of her life, in the last decade of the twentieth century, O'Brien wrote and spoke extensively about what she considered a historical moment of equal importance to the articulation of paternity: the development of reproductive technologies. She considered the developments of reproductive technologies to be revolutionary, capable in their implementations of re-configuring women's relationship to reproduction. Reliable, available, and safe contraception could allow women to separate sexual activity from reproduction; reproductive technologies such as in vitro fertilization and surrogate motherhood would allow women who are or who plan to be mothers to re-design their approaches to motherhood.  
O'Brien constructed the theoretical analysis that these reproductive technologies had to be assessed not only for their safety but also for the philosophical implications of their capacity to re-configure women's relationship to the labour of reproduction, in the same way ''The Politics of Reproduction'' declared the re-configuration of men's relationship to reproduction.  
This important theoretical analysis was cut short by O'Brien's death in 1998.

==O'Brien's contributions==
O'Brien left active nursing practice in 1971, but her continued analysis and writing about the politics of nursing had a profound impact on the profession, especially in Canada. She encouraged nursing professionals to take control over their working conditions and their relations to other medical practitioners, especially medical doctors. She helped to instigate a shift in how nursing professionals were educated and their resulting status in the health care field in Canada. She wrote and spoke extensively about healthcare and health care reform in Canada, with particular attention to the role and status of nurses.

O'Brien's lasting contribution to feminist political theory is her analysis of the dialectical structure of reproductive consciousness. The physical labour, literally, involved in women's reproductive experiences must be accounted, both as actual material production but also, more importantly, central to a sense of connection and integration of human endeavour. O'Brien also asserted the ownership over the means of production ought to be extended to women's rights to maintain authority and control over their children.

'''Milič Čapek''', (26 January 1909 – 17 November 1997) was a [[Czech Republic|Czech]]–[[United States|American]] [[philosopher]]. Čapek was strongly influenced by the [[process philosophy]] of [[Henri Bergson]] and to a lesser degree by [[Alfred North Whitehead]]. Much of his work was devoted to the relation of philosophy and [[modern physics]], especially the [[philosophy of space and time]] and [[metaphysics]].

==Life==
Čapek was born in the municipality of [[Třebechovice pod Orebem|Třebechovice]] in present-day [[Czech Republic]] (then part of [[Austria-Hungary]]).&lt;ref name="orbituary"&gt;[http://www.svu2000.org/remembering/obituaries-1998-2001/ SVU Obituaries' Archive 1998-2001]&lt;/ref&gt;

He was married to Stephanie Čapek (born Štěpánka Řežábková), who was a school teacher in Czechoslovakia and later a housewife, and died on July 14, 1998 (aged 82), in [[Little Rock, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecabin.net/stories/071798/obi_obits.html Log Cabin Democrat Orbituaries 7/17/98]&lt;/ref&gt; Together they have a daughter, Dr. [[Stella M. Čapek]] from [[Conway, Arkansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://thecabin.net/stories/112097/obi_obits.html Log Cabin Democrat Orbituaries 11/20/97]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935 Čapek received his Ph.D. in philosophy at [[Charles University in Prague]]. Following the [[German occupation of Czechoslovakia|German occupation]], he escaped from Czechoslovakia and studied at the [[University of Paris|Sorbonne]] in Paris, where he also directed Czech-language broadcasts back to his homeland. Ten days before the Nazi invasion, Čapek left Paris and went to America after an odyssey via [[Dakar, Senegal|Dakar]], [[Casablanca]] and a [[Vichy France|Vichy]] concentration camp in Morocco. During the war he taught physics in the Army Specialized Training Program at the [[University of Iowa]], the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]] at Doan College, and at the [[University of Nebraska system|University of Nebraska]]. After the war he returned to Czechoslovakia, where he taught briefly at the [[Palacký University of Olomouc]]. One month before the [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948|1948 communist coup d'état]] he was fleeing once again, to take up permanent residence and citizenship in the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=orbituary/&gt;

In 1948  joined the [[Carleton College]] philosophy faculty. In 1962 he accepted a position as professor of philosophy at [[Boston University]], where he served with distinction until his retirement in 1974. His visiting professorships included the [[University of California, Davis|Davis Campus]] of the University of California, [[Emory University]], [[University of North Texas]], [[Yale University]], and, again, Carleton, as the Donald J. Cowling Distinguished Visiting Professor of Philosophy. In 1983 Čapek was honored by Carleton with a [[Doctor of Letters]] degree.&lt;ref name=orbituary/&gt;

==Work==
Čapek was the author of numerous articles in scholarly journals&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar?as_q=&amp;num=100&amp;btnG=Scholar-Suche&amp;as_epq=&amp;as_oq=&amp;as_eq=&amp;as_occt=any&amp;as_sauthors=Milic+Capek&amp;as_publication=&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_yhi=&amp;hl=en Google Scholar]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://philpapers.org/s/Milic%20Capek philpapers]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as of several books. Milič Čapek made major contributions to the understanding of the philosophical implications of relativity theory and quantum mechanics, and to the philosophy of time.&lt;ref name=orbituary/&gt; He supported a dynamic view of time with real flow and genuine becoming, as opposed to the common [[Eternalism (philosophy of time)|block universe]] view with its static interpretation of time.&lt;ref&gt;Russell, Robert J. (ed.) 2004. ''Fifty years in science and religion: Ian G. Barbour and his legacy''. p. 151, Ashgate Publ. LTD, {{ISBN|0-7546-4118-X}} ([https://books.google.com/books?id=xgOsaqL_b1gC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Capek%20and%20John%22&amp;f=false Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; Čapek stated that the reason why we think of time and space as "space-time" and rather than "time-space" is because we give priority to the spatial aspect in our effort to geometrize events and moments, or to render them "space-like", as Einstein said.&lt;ref&gt;Berg Olsen, Jan-Kyrre 2002.

'''Natural evil''' is [[evil]] for which “no non-divine agent can be held morally responsible for its occurrence.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Nick |last=Trakakis|title=The Evidential Problem of Evil |work=The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy (IEP) |url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evil-evi/#SH1b}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, [[moral evil]] is “caused by human activity.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~grosen/puc/phi203/evil.html|title=The Problem of Evil|work=princeton.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of natural evil challenges belief in the [[omnibenevolence]] or the [[omnipotence]] of [[deities]] and the existence of deities including [[God]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Martin, ''Atheism: A Philosophical Justification'' (Temple University Press, 1992), 412.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature of natural evil==
Moral evil results from a perpetrator, or one who acts intentionally and in so doing has flouted some duty or engaged in some vice. Natural evil has only victims, and is generally taken to be the result of natural processes. The "evil" thus identified is evil only from the perspective of those affected and who perceive it as an affliction. Examples include cancer, birth defects, tornadoes, earthquakes, tsunamis, hurricanes, [[Act of God|acts of God]], and other phenomena which inflict suffering with apparently no accompanying mitigating good. Such phenomena inflict "evil" on victims with no perpetrator to blame.

In the [[Bible]], God is portrayed as both the ultimate creator and perpetrator, since the “sun, moon and stars, celestial activity, clouds, dew, frost, hail, lightning, rain, snow, thunder, and wind are all subject to God's command.”&lt;ref&gt;''Baker's Evangelical Dictionary'', s.v. “Providence of God.”&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of natural evils ascribed to God follow:

[[File:118.Job Hears of His Misfortunes.jpg|thumb|[[Gustave Doré]]: ''Doré's English Bible'' "[[Job (biblical figure)|Job]] Hears of His Misfortunes" (Job 1:1-22)]]
:* Floods: God brought “a flood of waters on the earth” (Genesis 6:17).
:* Thunder, hail, lightning: God “sent thunder and hail, and fire came down” (Exodus 9:23).
:* Destructive Wind: God sent a “great wind” that destroyed Job’s house and killed his family ([[Book of Job|Job]] 1:19).
:* Earthquake: By the Lord “the earth will be shaken” (Isaiah 13:13).
:* Drought and Famine: God will shut off rains, so neither land nor trees yield produce (Leviticus 26:19-20).
:* Forest fires: God says, “Say to the southern forest, 'I will kindle a fire in you, and it shall devour every green tree in you and every dry tree'” (Ezekiel 20:47).

Traditional theism (e.g. [[Thomas Aquinas]]) distinguishes between God's will and God's permission, claiming that while God permits evil, he does not will it.&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart, ''The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?'' (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 82–89.&lt;/ref&gt;  This distinction is echoed by some modern [[open theism|open theists]], e.g. [[Gregory A. Boyd]], who writes, "Divine goodness does not completely control or in any sense will evil."&lt;ref&gt;Gregory A. Boyd, God at War: the Bible and Spiritual Conflict (InterVarsity Press,1997) 20.&lt;/ref&gt; Aquinas partly explained this in terms of primary and secondary [[causality]], whereby God is the primary (or transcendent) cause of the world, but not the secondary (or immanent) cause of everything that occurs in it. Such accounts explain the presence of natural evil through the story of the [[Fall of man]], which affected not only human beings, but nature as well (Genesis 3:16–19).

Especially since the Reformation the distinction between God's will and God's permission, and between primary and secondary causality, has been disputed, notably by [[John Calvin]]. Among modern inheritors of this tradition, Mark R. Talbot ascribes evil to God: “God’s foreordination is the ultimate reason why everything comes about, including the existence of all evil persons and things and the occurrence of any evil acts or events.”&lt;ref&gt;Mark R. Talbot, “All the Good That Is Ours in Christ,” in Suffering and the Sovereignty of God, ed. John Piper and Justin Taylor, 43-44 (Crossway Books, 2006). Available online at [http://www.desiringgod.org/ResourceLibrary/OnlineBooks/ByTitle/ desiringgod.org]&lt;/ref&gt; Such models of God's complete foreordination and direct willing of everything that happens lead to the doctrines of [[double predestination]] and [[limited atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bentley Hart, ''The Doors of the Sea: Where Was God in the Tsunami?'' (William B. Eerdmans, 2005), pp. 89–91.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Jacques Rousseau]] responded to [[Voltaire|Voltaire's]] criticism of the optimists by pointing out that the [[value judgement]] required in order to declare the [[1755 Lisbon earthquake]] a natural evil ignored the fact that the human endeavour of the construction and organization of the city of Lisbon was also to blame for the horrors recounted as they had contributed to the level of suffering. It was, after all, the collapsing buildings, the fires, and the close human confinement that led to much of the death.

The question of whether [[natural disaster]]s such as [[hurricane]]s might be natural or moral evil is complicated by new understandings of the effects, such as [[global warming]], of our [[collective action]]s on events that were previously considered to be out of our control. Nonetheless, even before the beginning of the Industrial Revolution (which many believe was the beginning point of global warming), natural disasters (e.g., earthquakes, volcanoes, tsunamis, flooding, fires, disease, etc.) occurred regularly, and cannot be ascribed to the actions of humans. However, human actions exacerbate the evil effects of natural disasters. The [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] (WWF) says human activity is a key factor that turns “extreme weather events into greater natural disasters.” For example, “deforestation and floodplain development” by humans turn high rainfall into “devastating floods and mudslides." When humans damage coastal reefs, remove mangroves, destroy dune systems, or clear coastal forests, "extreme coastal events cause much more loss of life and damage.” Damage by tsunamis varied “according to the extent of reef protection and remaining mangrove coverage.” 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/Natural-disasters-made-worse-by-human-activity-_43194.html|title=Natural disasters made worse by human activity|work=expatica.com|accessdate=August 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Europe, human development has “contributed to more frequent and regular floods.”&lt;ref&gt;“Natural Disasters Made Worse by Human Activity” (May 20, 2008), [http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/Natural-disasters-made-worse-by-human-activity-_43194.html# Expatica.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In earthquakes, people often suffer injury or death because of “poorly designed and constructed buildings.”&lt;ref&gt;“UN Says Poor Construction to Blame for Earthquake Deaths — May 19, 2008,” [http://www.expatica.com/fr/news/local_news/UN-says-poor-construction-to-blame-for-earthquake-deaths-_43155.html Expatica.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, wildfires that destroy lives and property aren't "entirely natural.” Some fires are caused by human action and the damage inflicted is sometimes magnified by building “in remote, fire-prone areas.”&lt;ref&gt;“Southern California Forest Fires,”  [http://www.time.com/time/specials/2007/top10/article/0,30583,1686204_1686252_1690605,00.html time.com], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Dusty conditions in the West that “can cause significant human health problems” have been shown to be “a direct result of human activity and not part of the natural system."&lt;ref&gt;“Dust in West up 500 Percent in Past 2 Centuries, says CU-Boulder Study,” [http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2008-02/uoca-diw022208.php eurekalert.org], accessed December 2, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In sum, there is evidence that some "natural" evil results from human activity and, therefore, contains an element of moral evil.

==Challenge to religious belief==
Natural evil (also non-moral or surd evil) is a term generally used in discussions of the [[problem of evil]] and [[theodicy]] that refers to states of affairs which, considered in themselves, are those that are part of the natural world, and so are independent of the intervention of a human [[Agency (philosophy)|agent]]. Both natural and moral evil are a challenge to religious believers. Many atheists claim that natural evil is proof that there is no God, at least not an [[omnipotent]], [[Omnibenevolence|omnibenevolent]] one, as such a being would not allow such evil to happen to his/her creation. However, the [[deist]] position states that intervention by God to prevent such actions (or any intervention) is not an attribute of God.

'''Paul Artin Boghossian''' ({{IPAc-en|b|ə|ˈ|g|oʊ|z|i|ə|n}}; born 1957) is an American philosopher. He is Silver professor of [[philosophy]] at [[New York University]], where he was Chair of the Department for ten years (1994&amp;ndash;2004).&lt;ref&gt;[http://philosophy.fas.nyu.edu/object/paulboghossian Academic profile at NYU]&lt;/ref&gt; His research interests include [[epistemology]], the [[philosophy of mind]], and the [[philosophy of language]].  He is Director of the New York Institute of Philosophy and Distinguished Research Professor of Philosophy at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/philosophy/boghossian-paul.aspx birmingham.ac.uk]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and career==
Boghossian is of [[Armenians|Armenian]] ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://headoverhat.blogspot.com/2007/06/interview-with-paul-boghossian.html An Interview with Paul Boghossian], [[Khatchig Mouradian]] Aztag Daily.&lt;/ref&gt;

Boghossian earned his B.S. in physics at [[Trent University]] in 1976,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/philosophy/boghossian-paul.aspx Professor Paul Boghossian] Profil on University of Birmingham.&lt;/ref&gt; and his Ph.D. in philosophy at [[Princeton University]] in 1987.  In addition to his current position at NYU, he was a professor of philosophy at the [[University of Michigan at Ann Arbor]] from 1984 until 1992, and has also been a visiting professor at Princeton University.  He has previously held research fellowships from the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]], [[Magdalen College, Oxford]], the [[University of London]], and the [[Australian National University]].  He is a fellow of the [[New York Institute for the Humanities]].  He is on the editorial board of the journals ''Philosophical Studies'' and ''Philosophers' Imprint''.  In [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] circles, Boghossian is known for his response to the [[Sokal hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Boghossian also serves as a member of the Scientific Advisory Board for the World Knowledge Dialogue Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20150608102811/http://www.wkdialogue.ch/newsletter/newsletter-no-4-july-16-2007/a-new-scientific-board/ The World Knowledge Dialogue Foundation has a new Scientific Board], 16 July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

His book ''Fear of Knowledge'' won a Choice Award as an outstanding Academic Book of 2006.

In 2012, he was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amacad.org/news/alphalist2012.pdf American Academy of Arts and Sciences 2012 Fellows] (and their affiliations at the time of election)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical work==

In his early work, Boghossian was a trenchant critic of naturalistic theories of content.

Much of his later work, including his book ''Fear of Knowledge,'' criticizes various forms of relativism, especially [[epistemic relativism]], which claims that knowledge and reason are fundamentally cultural or subjective rather than objective.

In his article 'Blind Reasoning', Boghossian argues that we are blind to our reasons for justifying our methods of [[inference]] (the epitome of a method of inference is taken to be ''[[modus ponens]]''.) Rejecting both Simple Inferential Externalism for its inconsistency and Simple Inferential Internalism because it is difficult to accept, he opts for a third and new form of "rational insight".  This paper, in conjunction with an ongoing correspondence between Boghossian and [[Crispin Wright]], is part of a project to defend against epistemic relativism.

'''Stewart Ross Sutherland, Baron Sutherland of Houndwood''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|KT|FRSE|FBA|FKC}} (25 February 1941 – 29 January 2018) was a Scottish academic and public servant and one of Britain's most distinguished philosophers of religion. He sat as a [[crossbencher]] in the [[House of Lords]].

==Education==
He was educated at [[Robert Gordon's College]]. In 1963 he graduated from the [[University of Aberdeen]] with a first-class [[Master of Arts]] in Philosophy, and received a [[Bachelor of Arts]] in the Philosophy of Religion from [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]] in 1965.

==Career==
He was then appointed assistant lecturer in Philosophy at the [[University of Wales, Bangor|University College of North Wales]], and three years later returned to Scotland as a lecturer at the [[University of Stirling]]. In Stirling, he established the Religious Studies department and recruited [[John Drane]] and the late Glyn Richards to work alongside him in this enterprise.  Then in 1977 he became [[Professor]] of the History and Philosophy of Religion at [[King's College London]], and was subsequently appointed Vice-Principal and [[Principal (university)|Principal]] there in 1981 and 1985 respectively.

In 1990, Sutherland became [[Vice-Chancellor]] of the [[University of London]], and was appointed Chief Inspector of Schools two years later. He succeeded this post as [[Principal (university)|Principal]] and [[Vice-Chancellor]] of [[Edinburgh University]], in which position he served until 2002. During his Principalship the University made very significant advances in teaching and research, and far reaching organisational change was implemented effectively and humanely.  He was the Provost of [[Gresham College]] between 2002 and 2008. In 1992, he was elected to the [[British Academy]], and in 1995 he became a [[Fellow]] of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]], the same year he was [[knight]]ed and became President in 2002. He served on the Higher Education Funding Council for England, and the equivalent body in Hong Kong.

Following his involvement in the establishment of the [[Age Concern]] Institute of [[Gerontology]] at [[King's College London]], he was invited by the incoming Blair government in 1997 to chair a Royal Commission on Long-Term Care of Older People. This recommended that government (including the NHS and local authorities) should be responsible for providing free care in the spirit of the NHS Act to all people even if their illness takes the form of a chronic mental frailty. His recommendations were taken up by the devolved Scottish government, though were never implemented for England and Wales.

==Philosophy==
As a philosopher of religion, Sutherland had focused on how people continue to be morally responsible human beings in pluralist societies without the metaphysical security of traditional and potentially divisive systems of belief. Influenced by his intellectual mentor, [[Donald M. MacKinnon]], Sutherland’s approach has brought the clarity and rigour of the Anglo-American tradition of analytic philosophy into conversation with literary and philosophical thinkers on the European continent.

In ''Atheism and the Rejection of God: Contemporary Philosophy and "The Brothers Karamazov"'' (1977) and ''Faith and Ambiguity'' (1984), he explored continental thinkers including [[Fyodor Dostoevsky|Dostoevsky]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Albert Camus|Camus]] and [[Simone Weil|Weil]]. His Wilde Lectures at [[Oxford University]] – published as ''God, Jesus and Belief: The Legacy of Theism'' (1984) – explored a range of intellectual, moral and existential issues in contemporary philosophical theology, developing further his argument that Christian ethical and faith traditions continue to have an enduring value at a time when former patterns of belief have broken down. He further promoted his field of study in two influential edited volumes, ''The Philosophical Frontiers of Christian Theology: Essays Presented to D. M. MacKinnon'' (with Brian
Hebblethwaite), (1982) and ''Religion, Reason and the Self'' (with T A Roberts), (1989).

In two other edited volumes, ''World Religions'' (1988), and ''The Study of Religion: Traditional and New Religions'' (with Peter Clarke), (1991), he had contributed to the increasingly significant field of religious studies in school and university curricula, while also promoting understanding and mutual respect amongst peoples of different faiths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.acaffairs.ed.ac.uk/Committees/Senate/Meetings/200203/20030212/SM-Sutherland.pdf Special Minute of the Senate] of the [[University of Edinburgh]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Achievements and honours==
Sutherland was made a [[Knight Bachelor]] in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=54058 |date=9 June 1995 |page=8075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 June 2001, he was created a [[life peer]] as '''Baron Sutherland of Houndwood''', of [[Houndwood]] in the [[Scottish Borders]],&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=56263 |date=4 July 2001 |page=7875}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was the following year elected to the presidency of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]]. In the introduction to the House of Lords ceremony, his Senior Supporter was [[Brian Flowers, Baron Flowers|The Lord Flowers]] and his Junior Supporter was [[David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn|The Lord Wilson of Tillyorn]].

He was made a [[Knight of the Thistle]] in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=56780 |date=12 December 2002 |pages=15113–15114 }}&lt;/ref&gt; was the recipient of a number of [[honorary degree]]s, and continued to serve with various institutions. In 2004 he became a Fellow of [[Birkbeck, University of London]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbk.ac.uk/about_us/fellows/sutherland Information about fellows] of [[Birkbeck, University of London]]&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 May 1996 he received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] from the Faculty of 
Theology at [[Uppsala University]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uu.se/en/about-uu/traditions/prizes/honorary-doctorates/&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, he became a member of the editorial board of the [[Encyclopædia Britannica]].{{cn|date=February 2018}}

Straw feminism often incorporates oversimplifications, misrepresentations and stereotypes of feminism in order to easily discredit feminism as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a Straw Feminist?

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10167">{{About|the philosophical concept of value-pluralism|other uses of the term|Pluralism (disambiguation)}}
In [[ethics]], '''value pluralism''' (also known as '''ethical pluralism''' or '''moral pluralism''') is the idea that there are several [[values]] which may be equally correct and fundamental, and yet in conflict with each other. In addition, value-pluralism postulates that in many cases, such incompatible values may be [[commensurability (ethics)|incommensurable]], in the sense that there is no objective ordering of them in terms of importance. Value pluralism is opposed to ''value monism''.

Value-pluralism is a theory in [[metaethics]], rather than a theory of [[normative ethics]], or a set of values in itself. [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] philosopher and historian of ideas [[Isaiah Berlin]] is credited with being the first to popularize a substantial work describing the theory of objective value-pluralism, bringing it to the attention of academia (cf. the Isaiah Berlin Virtual Library). The related idea that fundamental values can and, in some cases, do conflict with each other is prominent in the thought of [[Max Weber]], captured in his notion of "polytheism".

== Context ==

Value-pluralism is an alternative to both [[moral relativism]] and [[moral absolutism]] (which Berlin called ''monism'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/berlin/ |title= Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy: Isaiah Berlin | last1= Cherniss | first1= Joshua | last2= Hardy | first2= Henry | date= 2013-11-29 |accessdate= 2015-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of value-pluralism is the idea that the moral life of a nun is incompatible with that of a mother, yet there is no purely rational measure of which is preferable. Hence, moral decisions often require radical preferences with no rational calculus to determine which alternative is to be selected.

Value-pluralism differs from value-relativism in that pluralism accepts limits to differences, such as when vital human needs are violated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Crowder | first = George | title = Liberalism and Value Pluralism | publisher = [[Continuum International Publishing Group|Continuum]] | location = London | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-8264-5048-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If values can be compared with virtues or duties then reference might also be made to the arguments of classical philosophy. Kant, for example, referred to "a conflict of duties"&lt;ref&gt;Kant I. ''Critique of Practical Reason'' 1788 (tr. Abbott T.K., Longmans, Green &amp; Co., London, 1883) p.280&lt;/ref&gt; and the subject can be traced back to Plato's ''Statesman'' where he wrote that although the aim may be "to promote not a part of virtue but the whole", it is often the case that the different parts of virtue "may be at war with one another".&lt;ref&gt;Plato ''Statesman'' 306; cf. ''Laws'' 705, ''Republic'' 443&lt;/ref&gt;

Isaiah Berlin suggested that [[James Fitzjames Stephen]], rather than himself, deserved credit for fathering value-pluralism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blattberg|first1=Charles|title=An Exchange with Professor Sir Isaiah Berlin|url=http://berlin.wolf.ox.ac.uk/lists/onib/blattberg.pdf|publisher=The Isaiah Berlin Literary Trust|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Stephen had observed: &lt;blockquote&gt;"There are innumerable differences which obviously add to the interest of life, and without which it would be unendurably dull. Again, there are differences which can neither be left unsettled nor be settled without a struggle, and a real one, but in regard to which the struggle is rather between inconsistent forms of good than between good and evil. In cases of this sort no one need see an occasion for anything more than a good-tempered trial of strength and skill, except those narrow-minded fanatics whose minds are incapable of taking in more than one idea at a time, or of having a taste for more things than one, which one thing is generally a trifle. There is no surer mark of a poor, contemptible, cowardly character than the inability to conduct disputes of this sort with fairness, temper, humanity, goodwill to antagonists, and a determination to accept a fair defeat in good part and to make the best of it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stephen|first1=James Fitzjames|title=Liberty, Equality, Fraternity|date=1874|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/572#Stephen_0021_308}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[William James]], influenced by Fitzjames Stephen, endorsed value-pluralism in an essay on "[[The Moral Philosopher and the Moral Life]]", which he first delivered as a lecture in 1891. He wrote that none "of the measures [of goodness] that have been actually proposed has, however, given general satisfaction ... The various ideals have no common character apart from the fact that they are ideals. No single abstract principle can be so used as to yield to the philosopher anything like a scientifically accurate and genuinely useful casuistic scale."

[[Joseph Raz]] and many others have done further work clarifying and defending value-pluralism. For instance, political philosopher [[William Galston]], former policy advisor to President Bill Clinton, has defended a Berlinian approach to value pluralism in books like ''Liberal Pluralism.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Liberal Pluralism: The Implications of Value Pluralism for Political Theory and Practice|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2002-05-13|location = Cambridge|isbn = 9780521813044|language = English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tetlock]], studies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tetlock|first1=P.E.|last2=Peterson|first2=R.|last3=Lerner|first3=J.|title=Revising the value pluralism model: Incorporating social content and context postulates|journal=Ontario symposium on social and personality psychology: Values|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tetlock|first1=P.E.|title=A value pluralism model of ideological reasoning|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology: Personality Processes and Individual Differences|date=1986|volume=50|pages=819–827}}&lt;/ref&gt; and identifies with&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The bright future of post-partisan social psychology|url=http://edge.org/conversation/jonathan_haidt-the-bright-future-of-post-partisan-social-psychology|first = Jonathan|last=Haidt|website=edge.org|date=February 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; value pluralism.

== Criticisms ==
The philosopher [[Charles Blattberg]], who was Berlin's student, has advanced an important critique of Berlin's value-pluralism. Blattberg focuses on value-pluralism's applications to Marx, the Russian intelligentsia, Judaism, and Berlin's early political thought, as well as Berlin's conceptions of liberty, the Enlightenment versus the Counter-Enlightenment, and history.

Another notable critic of value-pluralism in recent times is [[Ronald Dworkin]], the second most-cited American legal scholar, who attempts to forge a [[liberalism|liberal]] theory of [[egalitarianism|equality]] from a [[monism|monist]] starting-point, citing the failure of value-pluralism to adequately address the "Equality of what?" debate.

Alan Brown suggests that Berlin ignores the fact that values are indeed commensurable as they can be compared by their varying contributions towards the human good.&lt;ref name="Brown_157_158"&gt;Brown, A. (1986) Modern Political Philosophy; Theories of the Just Society, Middlesex, Penguin Books pp. 157–158&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the ends of freedom, equality, efficiency, creativity, etc., Brown maintains that none of these are ends in themselves but are valued for their consequences. Brown concludes that Berlin has failed to show that the problem of conflicting values is insoluble in principle.&lt;ref name="Brown_157_158"/&gt; The deliberative democrat [[Robert B. Talisse|Robert Talisse]] has published several articles criticizing the pluralism of Isaiah Berlin, William Galston, [[Richard Flathman]], and [[John N. Gray|John Gray]], alleging informal logic and internal epistemological contradictions.
