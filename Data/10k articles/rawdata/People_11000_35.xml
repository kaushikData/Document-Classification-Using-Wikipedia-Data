'''Adrienne Wu''' (born '''Adrian Francis Wu Ming Bong'''; August 9, 1990) is a Canadian fashion designer.&lt;ref name="InsideBurlington"&gt;{{cite news|last=Vizi|first=Stephanie|title=Fashion designer Adrian Wu reflects on early success|url=http://www.insidehalton.com/news/business/article/968470--fashion-designer-adrian-wu-reflects-on-early-success|accessdate=17 May 2011|newspaper=Inside Halton}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, Wu came out as Neutrois on YouTube channel and started going by gender neutral pronouns,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=wumingbong|title=Starting HRT! (Hormone Replacement Therapy) - MTN - Non-Binary Transition - Neutrois Transgender -|date=2016-02-08|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EnNLDKdnD7A|accessdate=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the same year they also began advocating with Toronto's [[Supporting Our Youth]] organization.

== Early life ==
Adrienne Wu was born in [[Burlington, Ontario]]. Wu credits most of Wu's inspiration from Wu's mother Jean Carole Wu. Wu's maternal grandmother Joan Davis was the head designer of Tai Ping Carpets Hong Kong in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="InsideBurlington" /&gt; Adrienne Wu attended [[Hillfield Strathallan College]] and in late 2009 Wu attended the [[University of Toronto]] aiming to go into a career of sex therapy. They dropped out after one year.&lt;ref name="Ones"&gt;{{cite web|last=Staff|first=Fashion|title=Ones to watch: Adrian Wu could be the next homegrown great|url=http://www.fashionmagazine.com/blogs/fashion/2011/06/29/ones-to-watch-adrian-wu/|work=Fashion Magazine|accessdate=29 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After creating Wu's portfolio, Wu was accepted by the [[Istituto Marangoni]], but deferred the offer to start Wu's own company in September 2010. In 2011, [http://www.adrianwu.com Adrienne Wu ] opened Wu's first boutique in downtown Toronto.&lt;ref name="Ones"/&gt;

== Career ==
Wu learned to sew in 2009 after they dropped out of the University of Toronto. Wu's first break was being offered a position at [[MuchMusic]] in April 2010 as a Fashion Correspondent, where they worked for half a year.&lt;ref name="mod"&gt;{{cite web|title=Much on Demand|url=http://www.muchmusic.com/tv/mod30/schedule.aspx|work=MuchMusic|publisher=Bell Media}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day that Wu was offered the position, they received an invitation to show their Fall Winter 2010 Collection at [[Vancouver Fashion Week]].&lt;ref name="west"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crawford|first=Holly|title=Adrian Wu |url=http://www.westofthecity.com/article/100166/Adrian-Wu|accessdate=10 November 2010|newspaper=WEST of the City}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu was nineteen years old. Wu showed their very first time at Vancouver Fashion Week which kick started Wu's career as a fashion designer.&lt;ref name="west"/&gt; Wu participated in the Spring-Summer 2011 Collection at the [[National Gallery of Canada]] during the Ottawa Fashion Week in October 2010.&lt;ref name="shawn"&gt;{{cite web|title=Adrian|url=http://ottawafashionweek.ca/Adrian.php|work=Ottawa Fashion Week}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same month, Wu met Shawn Hewson of [[Project Runway Canada]] through the Alumni Association of Hillfield Strathallan College.&lt;ref name="InsideBurlington"/&gt; Hewson mentored Wu for a year and introduced them to The Fashion Design Council of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adrian Wu |url=http://worldmastercardfashionweek.com/adrianwu/|work=World Mastercard Fashion Week|publisher=Fashion Design Council of Canada|accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 artist Mehrnaz had illustrated a painting of one of Wu's earlier pieces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Adrian Wu |url=http://torontostyles.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/adrian-wu.jpg|publisher=Toronto Styles|accessdate=5 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2010, Wu was offered their first corporate collaboration with [[Allan Candy]].&lt;ref name="InsideBurlington"/&gt; Wu was commissioned to create dresses out of Allan Candy wrappers for an online advertisement.&lt;ref name="InsideBurlington"/&gt; This was the first time Allan Candy had collaborated with a fashion designer and used the advertisement to launch the candy "DOPS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hannam|first=Lisa|title=What's in a name?|url=http://www.thespec.com/living/style/article/263799--what-s-in-a-name|work=The Spec.com|publisher=Metroland Media Group Ltd|accessdate=4 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quickly known as the 18-year-old-boy who modelled their own dresses, [[Random House|Prestel]] published Adrienne Wu internationally in a book called Style Diaries in February 2011.&lt;ref name="InsideBurlington"/&gt; Wu was featured as "one of the most influential forces behind tomorrow's trends" – Simone Werle. Style Diaries was distributed in over 50 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Werle|first=Simone|title=Style Diaries: World Fashion from Berlin to Tokyo|year=2010|publisher=Prestel Publishing|location=New York|isbn=978-3-7913-4474-4|id= {{ASIN|3791344749|country=ca}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011, R&amp;B singer Keisha Chante modelled Adrienne Wu's dress in the Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show.&lt;ref name="daretowear"&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Diane|title=Designer Q&amp;A with Adrian Wu |url=http://www.daretowearlove.com/d2wl-blog-entries/designer-qa-with-adrian-wu/|work=Dare to Wear Love}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu's work was featured after at [[Textile Museum of Canada]] as a part of Canada's first Fashion Exhibition, called Dare to Wear Love, in support of The [[Stephen Lewis Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Museum|first=Textile|title=Dare to Wear Love Info|url=http://www.textilemuseum.ca/apps/index.cfm?page=exhibition.detail&amp;exhId=331|work=Textile Museum of Canada|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At twenty-one, Wu debuted their Spring-Summer 2012 Collection at Toronto Fashion Week titled "[https://web.archive.org/web/20131206085744/http://oycomm.co/2011/10/young-canadian-designer-inspired-by-quantum-physics/ Creatures of the Photons]" with dresses resembling "large testicles and penis shapes jutting".

Wu had the opportunity to collaborate with [[Margaret Atwood]] for the Book Lovers Ball, hosted in support of the [[Toronto Public Library]] in January 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Flinn|first=Sue Carter|title=Fashion designer Adrian Wu dresses up Atwood's in Other Worlds for the Book Lover's Ball|url=http://www.quillandquire.com/blog/index.php/2012/02/09/fashion-designer-adrian-wu-dresses-up-atwoods-in-other-worlds-for-the-book-lovers-ball/|accessdate=9 February 2012|newspaper=Canada's Magazine of Book News and Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu created designs inspired by Margaret Atwood's book "In Other Worlds". Margaret tweeted that Adrienne Wu is "a brilliant designer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Atwood|first=Margaret|url=https://www.twitter.com/MargaretAtwood/statuses/167980265535311874|work=Twitter|title=Margaret tweeted that Adrian Wu is "a brilliant designer"|publisher=Twitter Inc|accessdate=10 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2012, Adrienne Wu was also involved with the [[Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada]] in Wu's annual event [[The Heart Truth]] Foundation. Jessi Cruikshank, [[eTalk]]'s Host modeled the Heart Truth Fashion Show's opening dress.&lt;ref name="hearttruth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thehearttruth.ca/fashion-show/2012-2/jessi-cruickshank-wearing-adrian-wu/|work=Heart and Stroke Foundation|title=Heart Truth Fashion Show|publisher=The Heart Truth Canada}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, [[Canada's Got Talent]] Host Dina Pugliese modeled Adrienne Wu's custom designed dress for the Dare to Wear Love Fashion Show.&lt;ref name="daretowear"/&gt; The annual Steven Lewis Foundation Fashion Show was Toronto Fashion Week's Finale show featuring the top 16 designers of Canada. Celebrity models included [[Jeanne Beker]] and [[Bob Marley]]'s grand daughter, Donisha Prendergast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hall|first=Diane|title=NO. 5: TRIPLE THREATS—THE DTWL TOP 10|url=http://www.daretowearlove.com/blog/|work=Dare to Wear Love|publisher=The Stephen Lewis Foundation|accessdate=27 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wu designed a tutu for [[The National Ballet of Canada]]'s 60th anniversary celebration which is to be debuted late 2012.

== Criticism ==

=== Debut ===

After Wu's debut at Toronto Fashion Week late 2011, Natalie Atkinson of the National Post criticized them for "threads hanging from the seam" and sending "unabashedly hairy-legged boys" down the runway. She concluded the review with "...if Wu is earnest, I would urgently refer Wu to land an internship at [[Comme des Garçons]] or [[Margiela]]".&lt;ref name="nationalp"/&gt;
 
Fashion Magazine called Wu 'overwrought' and Flare Magazine has said "One of the most unforgettable shows we saw this season".&lt;ref name="fashionm"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Halbert|first=Mosha Lundstrom|title=Show Review: Adrian Wu Spring 2012|url=http://www.flare.com/blog/post/48774--show-review-adrian-wu-spring-2012|accessdate=24 October 2011|newspaper=Flare Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gawker ===
In early 2012, Wu had their "Hierarchy of Needs" FW12 show at Toronto Fashion Week, which involved models wearing [[Guy Fawkes]] masks. This caused controversy quoting the Toronto Star to say, "message baffles audience". Wu also caught the attention of [[Gawker]], which questioned the designer's judgment for citing the group Anonymous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=O'Connor |first=Maureen |title=Fashion Show with Hacker Masks 'Baffles Audience' |url=http://gawker.com/5894007/fashion-show-with-hacker-masks-baffles-audience |accessdate=16 March 2012 |newspaper=Gawker |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120318153312/http://gawker.com/5894007/fashion-show-with-hacker-masks-baffles-audience |archivedate=18 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In 2015, Adrienne Wu came out to the public as neutrois, a non-binary gender identity and started going by gender-neutral pronouns. In the following year, Wu wrote an article on the Medium explaining the concept of being non-binary and how it differs greatly from other transgender identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/gender-2-0/explaining-a-non-binary-transition-751f8d897778#.lnmn265ne|title=Explaining a Non-Binary Transition.|last=Wu|first=Adrian Francis|date=2016-02-28|website=Medium|access-date=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wu has since openly participated in the Trans Fusion drop-ins at the Sherbourne Health Centre in Toronto, advocating for the visibility of non-binary identities within the vast spectrum of gender diversity. Wu frequently posts video updates about their transition journey on their personal YouTube channel as of 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=wumingbong|title=Male to Neutrois {{!}} Non-Binary Transition Timeline|date=2016-04-04|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gMqh7H-y0jI|accessdate=2016-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Wu changed their name to Adrienne, from Adrian.

[[Fashion magazine]] reviewed Wu's debut collection saying it, "...failed to impress". It later went on to write, "While the gowns themselves were quite striking in a palette of muted colours and constructed to Wu's signature voluminous style, it was not the focus of the audience, and apparently not that of its either. On more than a few pieces, faulty zippers and rogue hem threads stuck out like sore sartorial thumbs."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fashionmagazine.com/fashion/at-the-shows/2011/10/25/tfw-diary-adrian-wus-overwrought-lg-fashion-week-debut-fails-to-impress/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bradford Angier'''   (May 13, 1910 &amp;ndash; March 3, 1997) was a wilderness survivalist and proponent of  back to earth living.  He authored more than 35 books on how to survive in the wild and how to live minimalisticly off the land.

In 1947 Bradford and his new wife, Vena, were living in [[Boston]] [[Massachusetts]].  They had long romanticized the life of [[Thoreau]] and decided to move to [[Hudson's Hope]], a small town in northeastern [[British Columbia]], Canada, to live off the land.  Once there, they found an old prospectors cabin.  With the few tools and how-to books they brought with them, they were able to repair the cabin.  Bradford then set about learning to hunt and gather wild food.&lt;ref&gt;At Home in the Woods: Living the Life of Thoreau Today By Bradford Angier Published 1985  Macmillan Pub Co {{ISBN|0-02-062140-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He eventually started writing survival books.  Vena was artistic and hand illustrated several of his books. The couple lived in Canada until the building of the [[W.A.C. Bennett Dam]] on the Peace river near their home forced them to move. They moved to [[Cambria, California]] and built a house that was less than {{convert|1000|sqft|m2}}.&lt;ref&gt;Newspaper article from Weymouth, Massachusetts,  on Vena Angier turning 90.   By Leeanne T. Stronach / Correspondent Wednesday, December 17, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; For decades Angier and [[Calvin Rutstrum]] were the two most prominent "how to" authors on living in the wilderness.{{Citation needed|date=January 2014}}

In the 1970s Bradford and Vena returned to [[Hudson's Hope]]. In 1972 he wrote the book ''One Acre &amp; Security'' in which he discusses how to live organically on only {{convert|1|acre|m2|adj=on}} of land.  At this time he had become popular with the back-to-earth movement and was sought out by many people wishing to emulate his lifestyle. He was sometimes referred to as "Mr. Outdoors"&lt;ref&gt;One Acre and Security: How to Live Off the Earth Without Ruining It By Bradford Angier Published 2000 Willow Creek Press {{ISBN|1-57223-394-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two chapters in his book, [[Wilderness Wife]], were almost word for word copies of two chapters from the book [[The Forest (White novel)|''The Forest'']] by [[Stewart Edward White]], which was published in 1904.  There were no references made to White's book or even footnotes included which stated the text's source.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

Bradford died in 1997, a few months short of his 50th wedding anniversary.

'''Carlos Marighella''' ({{IPAc-pt|br|lang|'|c|a|r|l|o|&lt;|S|-|,|m|a|r|i|'|g|h|E|ll|a|lang=br}}; 5 December 1911 &amp;ndash; 4 November 1969) was a [[Marxist]] [[Brazil]]ian writer, politician and guerilla fighter who lived during the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Mário Magalhães |first=Mário Magalhães |date=2012 |title=Marighella |trans-title=Marighella |language=Portuguese |publisher=Companhia das Letras |isbn=9788580864717}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Marighella's most famous contribution to revolutionary&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Williams|first=John W.|date=1989-01|title=Carlos Marighela: The father of urban guerrilla warfare|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10576108908435757|journal=Terrorism|language=en|volume=12|issue=1|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/10576108908435757|issn=0149-0389}}&lt;/ref&gt;  literature was the ''[[Minimanual of the Urban Guerrilla]]'', consisting of advice on how to disrupt and overthrow an authoritarian regime, aiming at revolution.  Written shortly before his death late 1969 in São Paulo, ''Minimanual'' was first published in North America by the ''[[Berkeley Tribe]]'' in [[Berkeley, California]] in July 1970 in an English edition.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;library of congress.gov/chronicling america/berkeley tribe&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;University of Michigan.gov/archives/underground newspapers/microfilm collection&lt;/ref&gt; Marighella also wrote ''[[For the Liberation of Brazil]]''. The theories laid out in both books have greatly influenced contemporary ideological activism. His ideas of revolution were complementary to [[Che Guevara|Che Guevara's]], who proposed [[guerrilla]] activity in the countryside, Marighela's theories on [[urban guerrilla warfare]] envisaged cities as a key point of support for the peasant's armed revolt. As an advocate of urban guerrilla warfare as means to assist a larger scale rural uprising, Marighella's work was the latest tome in the small library of revolutionary political literature in the 20th century.  The ''Minimanual'' was highly admired among student revolutionaries in America, Europe and Ireland including the [[Weatherman (organization)|Weathermen]], [[Irish Republican Army]], [[Revolutionary Organization 17 November|Greek N17]], Basque [[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]] separatists, the [[Red Army Faction]], [[Red Brigades]] and [[Action directe (armed group)|Direct Action-France]].

==Biography==
[[File:Marighella foto1 carteira pcb apeerj.JPG|thumb|Marighella]]

Marighella was born in [[Salvador, Brazil|Salvador]], [[Bahia]], to [[Italians|Italian]] immigrant Augusto Marighella and [[Afro-Brazilian]] Maria Rita do Nascimento. His father was a [[blue-collar worker]] originally from [[Emilia (region of Italy)|Emilia]], while his mother was a descendant of African slaves, brought from [[Sudan]] ([[Hausa people|Hausa blacks]]). He spent his young life at a house in Rua do Desterro, at the Baixa do Sapateiro neighbourhood, where he would graduate from primary and secondary education. In 1934, he left the Polytechnic School of Bahia, where he was pursuing a degree in [[civil engineering]], in order to become an active member of the [[Brazilian Communist Party]] (Partido Comunista Brasileiro - PCB). He then moved to [[Rio de Janeiro]] to work in the restructuring of PCB.

Marighella was first arrested in 1932, after he wrote a poem criticizing the administration of Bahia intervener Juracy Magalhães. On 1 May 1936, during the [[Getúlio Vargas]] time in presidency, he was once again arrested for subversion. He was tortured by the political police led by [[Filinto Müller]], now considered the "patron of torturers" in Brazil. He remained in jail for a year. He was released by "macedada" (the measure which freed political prisoners without pressing charges against them). After his release, he once again entered clandestinity, along with all members of PCB. He was recaptured in 1939, once again being tortured. He was not released until 1945, when an amnesty during the democratization process of the country benefitted all political prisoners.

The following year, Marighella was elected constituent federal deputy by the Bahian branch of PCB, but he lost his office in 1948 under the new proscription of the party. Back in clandestinity, he occupied several offices in the leadership of the party. Invited by the [[Central Committee of the Communist Party of China]], Marighella visited China between 1953 and 1954 in order to learn more about the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]]. In May 1964, after the [[1964 Brazilian coup d'état|military coup]], he was shot and arrested by agents of the Department of Social and Political Order (Departamento de Ordem Política e Social - DOPS), the political police, at a movie theater in Rio. He was released in the following year by a court order. In 1966, he wrote ''The Brazilian Crisis'', opting for the armed struggle against the [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|military dictatorship]]. Later that year, he renounced his office in the national leadership of PCB.
On August 1967, he participated at the 1st Conference of Latin American Solidarity in [[Havana]], contradicting what party had determined. In Havana, he wrote ''Some Questions About the Guerrillas in Brazil'', dedicated to the memory of [[Che Guevara]] and made public by ''[[Jornal do Brasil]]'' on 5 September 1968. That same year he was expelled from PCB, and founded the [[Ação Libertadora Nacional]] (ALN) on February 1968. In September 1969, ALN members kidnapped the U.S. ambassador [[Charles Burke Elbrick]] in a coordinated move with the [[Revolutionary Movement 8th October]] (Movimento Revolucionário 8 de Outubro — MR-8).

After a series of successful robberies and kidnappings, the police force was determined to eliminate him.&lt;ref name=Holmes&gt;{{cite book

'''David Barry Brudnoy''' (June 5, 1940 – December 9, 2004) was an American [[talk radio]] host in [[Boston]] from 1976 to 2004. His radio talk show aired on [[WBZ-AM|WBZ radio]]. He was known for espousing his [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] views on a wide range of political issues, in a manner that was courteous. Thanks to WBZ's wide signal reach, he gained a following from across the United States as well as Canada. On December 9, 2004, he succumbed to [[Merkel cell cancer|Merkel cell carcinoma]] after it had [[metastasis|metastasized]] to his lungs and kidneys.

==Background, education and first career ==
Born in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]], United States, to a Jewish family, David Brudnoy was the only child of Doris and Harry Brudnoy. Harry was a [[dentist]] in the Minneapolis area, a profession he maintained for over 50 years.&lt;ref name="Miller-1997"&gt;{{cite news|title=Longtime Minneapolis dentist Harry Brudnoy dies at age 89|last=Miller|first=Pamela|date=1997-09-15|work=[[Star Tribune]]|location=[[Minneapolis, Minnesota]]|page=B4|accessdate=2008-08-28|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14628362/longtime_minneapolis_dentist_harry/|via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his youth, David Brudnoy was known to be precocious, and in addition to reading a lot, he enjoyed [[Stamp collecting|collecting stamps]].&lt;ref&gt;Brudnoy 1997, pp. 6–8.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also interested in history, and thanks to the influence of his Aunt Kathie, with whom he was close for all of his life, he became interested in movies; he often attended them with her.&lt;ref&gt;Brudnoy 1997, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Brudnoy would become known for his work as a [[Film criticism|film critic]], and he remarked in his autobiography that his aunt had undoubtedly contributed to his success by taking him to so many films.

Although he did not articulate it at the time, he was also aware of certain [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] attractions.&lt;ref&gt;Brudnoy 1997, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  Years later, he would detail the confusion he felt, discussing his teenage and college years in his 1997 autobiography, ''Life is Not a Rehearsal''.  During his childhood, Brudnoy and his family briefly lived in [[Macon, Georgia]], and [[San Antonio, Texas]]; his father had enlisted in the [[United States Army Reserve]] and the moves were so that he could be near army bases.&lt;ref&gt;Brudnoy 1997, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Brudnoy first attended college in 1958, receiving a [[Bachelor's degree|B.A.]] from [[Yale University|Yale]] in [[New Haven]].  He also received [[Master's degree|M.A.]]s from [[Harvard University|Harvard]] and [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]], and a [[Ph.D.]] from [[Brandeis University|Brandeis]], focusing on [[East Asia]]n studies and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A life of intellect, success and pain|last=Johnson|first=Dean|date=2004-12-09|work=Boston Herald|page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He received an [[honorary doctorate]] from [[Emerson College]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="Sullivan-1996"&gt;{{cite news|title=Brudnoy, Cain are Emerson honorees|last=Sullivan|first=Paul |date=1996-05-13|work=Boston Herald|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[professor]], Brudnoy taught classes or was a guest lecturer at many major colleges and universities throughout Boston and New England, as well as in Texas: [[Boston University]], [[Boston College]], [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]], [[Merrimack College]], [[University of Rhode Island]], [[Kennedy School of Government]] at Harvard, as well as [[Texas Southern University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brudnoy pulls no punches in tell-all book|last=Johnson|first=Dean|date=1996-03-27|work=Boston Herald|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was respected as an educator:  student evaluations for his courses at Boston University indicate that they were very well received, and former students were among those who wrote eloquent tributes to him when he died.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Student bids Prof. Brudnoy farewell|last=McGillucuddy|first=Shamus |date=2004-12-11|work=Quincy Patriot Ledger|page=27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to those students, he was such a devoted educator that even as he was dying, he made certain to finish grading their [[term paper]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=David Brudnoy, 1940–2004; Appreciation. Hub Mourns Loss of Radio Icon|last=Johnson|first=Dean|date=2004-12-10|work=Boston Herald|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcast career==
Brudnoy began a career in broadcast commentary in 1971 on Boston's local [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]] television station, [[WGBH-TV]]. In 1976, he took over as host of his friend [[Avi Nelson]]'s radio show on [[WEEI (AM)|WHDH]], in the midst of the city's unrest over [[forced busing]] and  [[desegregation]] in schools. He took to the job with ease, and increasingly gained popularity. From 1981 to 1986, he appeared on former [[Top 40]] station [[WRKO]], which was now news and talk, before moving to local stalwart [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]]. The top-rated talk radio host in New England, he appeared in a regular weekday evening slot until his retirement.  At the end of his career, Brudnoy was, according to WBZ Radio's promotional materials, derived from [[Arbitron]] ratings, among the most-listened-to evening talk hosts in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/globe/editorial_opinion/oped/articles/2001/06/14/whos_no_1_its_brudnoy?pg=full |title=Who's No. 1? It's Brudnoy |first=Jeff |last=Jacoby |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2001-06-14 |page=A19 |via=[[Boston.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the years, Brudnoy also appeared as a news commentator and host on local TV stations besides WGBH, including [[WCVB-TV]] ([[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]]), [[WHDH-TV|WNAC-TV]], and [[WBZ-TV]] ([[CBS]]). He also appeared nationally on the ''[[CBS Morning News]]''. He wrote movie reviews for [[Boston (magazine)|''Boston'' magazine]] and local community newspapers. During the 1970s he wrote articles for the ''[[National Review]]'', and befriended its editor [[William F. Buckley Jr.]]&lt;ref  name="Jacoby-2004"&gt;{{cite news |title=Death of a Gallant Man |last=Jacoby |first=Jeff |date=2004-12-12 |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=K11 |accessdate=2008-08-29 |url=http://www.jeffjacoby.com/6728/death-of-a-gallant-man |via=jeffjacoby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He also wrote for ''The Alternative'' (later known as ''[[The American Prospect]]'') in the early 1970s, but quit because of the editor's unwillingness to adopt a more liberal position on gay rights.&lt;ref name="Brudnoy-1977"&gt;{{cite news|title=''The Alternative'': An American Spectacle|last=Brudnoy|first=David|date=November 1977|work=[[Libertarian Review]]|pp=28–32|accessdate=2012-05-19|url=http://www.libertarianism.org/lr/LR7711.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; His articles have appeared in ''[[The New York Times]]'', ''[[The New Republic]]'', and ''[[The Saturday Evening Post]]''.

In 1990, his WBZ show was canceled in favor of a less expensive [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] show hosted by [[Tom Snyder]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/294534857.html |title=WBZ Lets Brudnoy Go |last=Bickelhaupt |first=Susan |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |page=66 |date=June 27, 1990 |accessdate=October 25, 2017 |via=pqarchiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; but a mass public response, including support from ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' and the ''[[Boston Herald]]'', helped lead to his quick return to the station's lineup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper |url=http://www.jeffjacoby.com/12646/boston-premier-talker |title=Boston's premier talker |first=Jeff |last=Jacoby |newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=June 14, 2001 |accessdate=October 25, 2017 |via=jeffjacoby.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brudnoy's popularity escalated him into the Boston media elite, and he was the host of numerous social gatherings at his upscale [[Back Bay, Boston|Back Bay]] apartment, mixing students, media personalities, and politicians. After his bout with AIDS, Brudnoy began broadcasting from his apartment four nights out of five, welcoming his radio guests into his home and eagerly offering them cocktails.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin-2004"&gt;{{cite news|title=A Front Row Seat at the Brudnoy Salon|last=McLaughlin|first=Shane |date=2004-12-26|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=6|accessdate=2008-08-29|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/404932041.html|url-access=limited|via=pqarchiver.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to the air in early January 1995, after his first battle with HIV/AIDS kept him off the air for ten weeks, [[Mayor of Boston|Boston Mayor]] [[Thomas Menino]] formally declared January 5 as "David Brudnoy Day" due to his popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brudnoy, icon of airwaves, dies|last=Feeney|first=Mark|date=2004-12-10|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=A1|accessdate=2008-08-29|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/12/10/brudnoy_icon_of_airwaves_dies_boston_globe?pg=full|via=[[Boston.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, Brudnoy was awarded the Freedom of Speech Award from the [[National Association of Radio Talk Show Hosts]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14641660/radio_hosts_win_awards/ |title=Radio hosts win awards |newspaper=[[The News-Press]] |location=[[Fort Myers, Florida]] |date=February 18, 1997 |accessdate=October 24, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was nominated for the major market "Personality of the Year" [[NAB Marconi Radio Awards|Marconi Radio Award]] by the [[National Association of Broadcasters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/14641743/will_paulsen_and_krenn_win_a_marconi/ |title=Will Paulsen and Krenn win a Marconi Award? |first=Adrian |last=McCoy|newspaper=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |date=June 18, 1997 |accessdate=October 24, 2017 |via=newspapers.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he celebrated his 25th anniversary on the air.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Brudnoy Settles In For Another 25 years of Talk Radio|date=2001-03-28|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=C4|accessdate=2008-08-29|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-8638823.html|url-access=limited|via=highbeam.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was inducted to the Massachusetts Broadcasters Hall of Fame, posthumously, in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.allaccess.com/net-news/archive/story/46029/ginsburg-others-honored-by-ma-broadcasters-hall-of |title= Ginsburg, Others Honored By MA Broadcasters Hall of Fame |website=allaccess.com |date=September 18, 2008 |accessdate=October 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Politics and sensibilities==
Brudnoy's strongly [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] opinions were expressed with wit and thoughtfulness. He described his own manner as "less ideological and more empathic", in contrast to more recent figures of [[conservative talk radio]]. Many regard him as a unique radio host who was effective at injecting a different perspective into the political dialogue rather than merely cultivating a particular political segment of the population.

His non-partisan, thoughtful way of discussing issues helped him gain a large following despite being based in a staunchly [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] region. Political figures from both ends of the spectrum have praised him for his contributions to the local and national dialogue.  Among those who eulogized him when he died were [[Modern liberalism in the United States|liberals]] like Senator [[Edward M. Kennedy]] who said that David was uniquely fair to his guests.  "He couldn't care less about your party label, as long as you knew what you were talking about, because he always did"; and [[Conservatism in the United States|conservatives]] like then-[[Governor of Massachusetts|Governor]] [[Mitt Romney]] who said that  Brudnoy was "... a friend to hundreds of thousands of people, most of whom he never even saw in person . . . David has left us all a huge inheritance. It's an inheritance rich in tolerance, in faith, in the greatness of humanity, in respect for all people..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends recall a man of courage, eloquence|last=Abel|first=David|date=2004-12-10|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=B18|accessdate=2008-08-29|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/12/10/friends_recall_a_man_of_courage_eloquence/|via=[[Boston.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Brudnoy declared himself a member of the [[Libertarian Party (United States)|Libertarian Party]].

Although his father Harry was a practicing Jew and a member of a Minneapolis synagogue,&lt;ref name="Miller-1997"/&gt; David Brudnoy was an [[agnosticism|agnostic]] who disliked organized religion and was critical of religions that tried to impose their views on others. He did have a [[bar mitzvah]] in May 1953,&lt;ref&gt;Brudnoy 1997, pp. 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt; but he was already becoming skeptical of religion and recalled that event as the last time he followed his religious traditions. Years later, he wrote several opinion pieces about his opposition to [[Dogma|religious dogmatism]].  But on the other hand, he also wrote favorably about the good that the church was capable of doing.  In one piece, he stated that "...the church itself, for [[Catholic Church|Catholic]]s and non-Catholics alike, is a bulwark of our society. Its severely overburdened clergy are crucial to the development of our youths, to comforting our elders, and to tending our sick."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Church's value must outweigh current woes|last=Brudnoy|first=David |date=2002-01-29|work=Boston Herald|page=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

But while he was a skeptic about the tenets of organized religion, during his late-2004 bout of serious illness he admitted he had prayed in various ways,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A visit to Brudnoy|last=McGrory|first=Brian |date=2004-01-06|newspaper=[[The Boston Globe]]|page=B1|accessdate=2008-08-29|url=http://archive.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2004/01/06/a_visit_to_brudnoy/|via=[[Boston.com]]|url-access=limited}}&lt;/ref&gt; including with a [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|Catholic priest]] who was a friend of his; and he said that he had discussed religion with several of his Jewish friends, including political commentator [[Jon Keller]] and conservative newspaper columnist [[Jeff Jacoby (columnist)|Jeff Jacoby]].&lt;ref name="Jacoby-2004"/&gt;  But he said he did not expect to go to either a [[heaven]] or a [[hell]].

==Homosexuality==
Brudnoy came to realize that he was [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] early in life but successfully hid the fact for many years.  While at Texas Southern, he "adopted" a young, recently single mother, Patricia Kennedy, and for many years Brudnoy and Kennedy enjoyed a relationship of mutual convenience, with Brudnoy able to use Kennedy as a cover for his homosexuality, and in return serving as a surrogate father to her two young children.  Brudnoy did not come out to his father and stepmother until his illness in 1994; his father Harry was 88 years old when Brudnoy finally phoned him to give him the news and also discuss the health crisis he was undergoing.  David was pleasantly surprised that his parents were supportive.&lt;ref name="Hutchinson-1994"&gt;{{cite news|title=Personal pain in the public eye Talk host Brudnoy tells Dad he's dying of AIDS|last=Hutchinson|first=Bill|author2=Dean Johnson|date=1994-11-18|work=Boston Herald|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Brudnoy had previously come out to his aunt and uncle after they lost a son (also homosexual) to [[AIDS]].&lt;ref&gt;Brudnoy 1997, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Brudnoy came out publicly in 1994, after returning from hospitalization to overcome his long-hidden fight with AIDS. Having attracted a largely conservative audience based on his political views,  traditional anti-homosexual conservatives rejected him  {{citation needed|date=June 2014}}, though others admired him for his courage. Despite the controversy, his ratings reportedly did not suffer as a result. The controversy was rekindled somewhat after the release of his autobiography, in which he described a history of sexual excesses.  Brudnoy did not attempt to mask his sexuality during his adult life, but also made no direct indications of it; it was well-known among his colleagues in broadcasting long before he spoke publicly about it.  His closest and oldest friend was psychologist Dr. [[Ward Cromer]], with whom he took dozens of trips abroad, and who was incorrectly assumed by many to be Brudnoy's sexual partner.  Neither of them used that phraseology to describe their relationship, preferring a more accurate title of "best friend".  When Brudnoy died, it was Cromer who became executor of his estate.&lt;ref name="Sweet-2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Final Testament to a Man's Generosity|last=Sweet|first=Laurel J.|date=2005-01-01|work=Boston Herald|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Illness==
Brudnoy was diagnosed with [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] in 1988, but kept his treatment a secret until his condition became serious after he contracted [[pneumonia]] in 1994. He was absent from public life for some time to fight the disease. Comatose and near death at one point, he eventually returned to reasonable health.  It was at that time, in order to conserve his strength, that he broadcast his show from  his apartment in the Back Bay section of Boston during part of 1994.&lt;ref name="McLaughlin-2004"/&gt;   Once he was able to return to the air,   Brudnoy announced the creation of a fund to fight AIDS.  His illness inspired him to publish his autobiography; at the time, it was not a best-seller, but after he died, it became a collector's item, since his publisher had originally let it go out of print and now many of his fans wanted copies of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Out-of-print Brudney book a hot property|last=Phelan|first=Christine |date=2005-03-29|work=Lowell Sun|page=D1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2003, he was diagnosed with [[Merkel cell cancer|Merkel cell carcinoma]], a rare form of [[skin cancer]]. After hospitalization and treatment, including another period of being considered near death, the cancer went into apparent [[remission (medicine)|remission]], and Brudnoy returned to work, with a strained voice, in March 2004. However, in November 2004, doctors discovered that cancer had spread into his [[lungs]] and [[kidney]]s, forcing him to undergo [[dialysis]] in addition to cancer treatment.

Brudnoy checked into [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] on December 3, 2004. On December 8,  Brudnoy made his last radio broadcast on his show via a deathbed interview with [[WBZ (AM)|WBZ]] reporter [[Gary LaPierre]].&lt;ref name="Simon-2005"&gt;{{cite news|title=Friends Set for Brudnoy Tribute|last=Simon|first=Clea |date=2005-02-24|work=Boston Globe|page=B8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following day, Brudnoy ordered his doctors to remove all artificial [[life support]] systems, leaving him only with [[oxygen]], [[morphine]], and minimal food. He died hours after having the support removed, on December 9, 2004.

After a few days of on-air remembrance, Brudnoy's time slot was assigned to [[Paul Sullivan (radio)|Paul Sullivan]], who had previously taken over two hours of Brudnoy's shift when Brudnoy's illness necessitated reducing his show from five hours to three. Sullivan too would die of cancer, on September 9, 2007.

A public memorial was held for Brudnoy on February 27, 2005, at the [[Cutler Majestic Theater]] in Boston, arranged by his WBZ colleagues and [[Emerson College]] (which had previously awarded him an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[doctorate]]).

'''Domhnall Ua Buachalla''' ({{IPA-ga|d̪ˠɔwn̪ˠal̪ˠ uə bˠuəxal̪ˠa|pron}}; {{lang-en|Daniel Richard (Donal) Buckley}}; 5 February 1866 – 30 October 1963) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] politician and member of the [[First Dáil]] who served as third and final [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]] and later served as a member of the [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]].&lt;ref name=oireachtas_db&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oireachtas.ie/members-hist/default.asp?housetype=0&amp;HouseNum=5&amp;MemberID=120&amp;ConstID=115|title=Mr. Donal Buckley|work=Oireachtas Members Database|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Ua Buachalla was from [[Maynooth]] in [[County Kildare]] and ran a combined grocery, bicycle shop and pub in the town. He was an [[Irish language]] activist and member of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]]. In 1907, he was arrested and had his groceries seized when he refused to pay a fine for having his grocery wagon painted with ''Domhnall Ua Buachalla'' (his name in the [[Irish language]]), as British law required grocery wagons to be registered only in the English language.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,882430,00.html|title=Irish Free State: King George's Domhnall|work=Time|accessdate=20 August 2010| date=5 December 1932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1916–1932==
He was a member of the [[Irish Volunteers]] and on the outbreak of the 1916 [[Easter Rising]] he walked the 26 kilometres to Dublin to fight in the Rising.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bureauofmilitaryhistory.ie/reels/bmh/BMH.WS0194.pdf#page=1&lt;/ref&gt;. He was imprisoned in the mass arrests and deportations that followed, and released in 1917. Like many Rising survivors, he joined [[Sinn Féin]], a small separatist party that was wrongly blamed by the British government for the Easter Rising. In the aftermath of the Rising, survivors led by [[Éamon de Valera]] took over the party in the struggle for the establishment of an Irish republic. Ua Buachalla was elected as a Sinn Féin MP for [[North Kildare (UK Parliament constituency)|Kildare North]] at the [[Irish general election, 1918|1918 general election]]. He served in the [[First Dáil]] (1918–1921), and was re-elected to the [[Second Dáil]] in 1921 as a [[Teachta Dála]] (TD) for [[Kildare–Wicklow (Dáil constituency)|Kildare–Wicklow]]. He sided with de Valera and opposed the [[Anglo-Irish Treaty]]. He fought in the [[Four Courts]] in the [[Irish Civil War|Civil War]]. Imprisoned in [[Dundalk]] jail, he was released by the Anti-Treaty troops in August 1922.&lt;ref name=biography&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archontology.org/nations/eire/eire_gg/buckley.php|title=Biography of Ua Buachalla|work=archontology.org|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He lost his seat at the [[Irish general election, 1922|1922 general election]], and was an unsuccessful candidate at the [[Irish general election, 1923|1923 general election]].

==Irish governor-general==
He joined [[Fianna Fáil]] on its foundation in 1926 and was elected as a Fianna Fáil TD for the [[Kildare (Dáil constituency)|Kildare constituency]] at the [[Irish general election, June 1927|June 1927 general election]], only to lose that seat in the [[Irish general election, 1932|1932 general election]], which Fianna Fáil won.&lt;ref name=elecs_irl&gt;{{cite web|url=http://electionsireland.org/candidate.cfm?ID=1317|title=Donal Buckley|work=ElectionsIreland.org|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was chosen by Éamon de Valera to become [[Governor-General of the Irish Free State]] following [[James McNeill]]'s resignation in November 1932.

==Instruction to keep a low profile==
De Valera explicitly instructed Ua Buachalla as Governor-General to keep a low public profile, and not to fulfil public engagements, which was part of de Valera's policy to make the office an irrelevance by reducing it to invisibility. While he continued to give the [[Royal Assent]] to legislation, summon and dissolve [[Dáil Éireann]] and fulfil the other formal duties of the office, he declined all public invitations and kept himself invisible, as advised by his Government. In fact in his period in office he performed only one public function: the receipt of the credentials of the French Ambassador in the Council Chamber, Government Buildings, 1933, on behalf of King [[George V]]. However, de Valera subsequently had that duty moved from the Governor-General to his own post of [[President of the Executive Council of the Irish Free State|President of the Executive Council]];
instead of presenting his credentials to Ua Buachalla, the US Legation Minister, William Wallace McDowell, presented himself to de Valera.&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080501131445/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0%2C9171%2C929707%2C00.html Seanascal Domnhall], ''[[TIME]]'', April 9, 1934&lt;/ref&gt;
One of the few other occasions Ua Buachalla was mentioned at all in public was when, in the aftermath of the death of King George V in January 1936, he had to reply to messages of condolence sent to the Irish people by United States President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and the [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Cordell Hull]]. 

On de Valera's instruction, Ua Buachalla did not reside in the official residence of the Governor-General, the Viceregal Lodge (now called [[Áras an Uachtaráin]], the residence of the [[President of Ireland]]).&lt;ref name="TIME"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, a house was rented for his use in [[Monkstown, County Dublin|Monkstown]], outside of Dublin.&lt;ref&gt;[https://stillslibrary.rte.ie/indexplus/image/0508/037.html Permalink - Stills Library - RTÉ Archives]&lt;/ref&gt; The official English title "Governor-General" was largely replaced by the official [[Irish language|Irish]] title "Seanascal" or its direct translation, "[[Seneschal]]"; however, "Governor-General" remained the legal form used in official English-language documents and proclamations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nli.ie/Record/vtls000580782 Headed paper and seal of the Governor General (Seanascal) of the Irish Free State], [[National Library of Ireland]]&lt;/ref&gt; Ua Buachalla refused all but [[Pound sterling|£]]2,000 of the £10,000 salary of the Governor-General.

==Falling out with de Valera==
Ua Buachalla fell out with de Valera over the manner of his exit from office, in December 1936. De Valera sought to use the [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdication crisis]] surrounding King [[Edward VIII of the United Kingdom|Edward VIII]] to amend the Irish Free State's Constitution to abolish both the [[The Crown|Crown]] and the office of governor-general. Having done so, he faced a threat of a court case from Ua Buachalla, who had been left personally liable for the remaining one year's expensive private lease on his residence, following the sudden abolition of his office. In practice, between 1933 and December 1936, the Irish government had paid Ua Buachalla expenses, from which he paid the rent on the expensive residence which was picked for him.

However, from December 1936, the government insisted that it had no responsibility for paying for the residence. Ua Buachalla had, in 1932, on de Valera's explicit advice, leased the residence for a full five years, which was his expected term of office. There remained one year's outstanding lease, for a residence he could not now afford and for which he had no need now as he was no longer governor-general. Eventually, de Valera was forced to grant Ua Buachalla a large pension and to pay his outstanding rent and expenses to stop a potentially embarrassing court case going ahead. Ua Buachalla attended the inauguration of the first [[President of Ireland]], [[Douglas Hyde]], in [[Dublin Castle]] in June 1938.

==Appointment to Council of State and later life==
Ua Buachalla and de Valera reunited as political partners, and in a symbolic act of apology, de Valera, when elected [[President of Ireland]] in 1959 appointed Ua Buachalla to his advisory [[Council of State (Ireland)|Council of State]]. However, he returned to Maynooth to continue running his family business, the hardware store which had been founded in 1853.

Domhnall Ua Buachalla died, aged 97, in a nursing home in Dublin. He was given a [[list of Irish state funerals|state funeral]] and buried in [[Laraghbryan]] Cemetery in Maynooth, with the graveside oration delivered by President de Valera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kildare.ie/library/ehistory/2009/02/funeral_of_domhnall_ua_buachal_1.asp|title=Funeral of Domhnall Ua Buachalla|work=Co. Kildare Online Electronic History Journal|accessdate=20 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ua Buachalla hardware store closed in October 2005. The road beside this store is named after him (although translated to English as "Buckley's Lane"). The building has been demolished, but some of the frontage has been preserved, with the building bearing the name "Buckley House".

'''Julio Victorio De Rissio''' (10 November 1916 – 26 December 2013), better known by the stage name of '''Dr. Tangalanga''', was a popular [[Argentine humor|Argentine comedian]] known for his humorous [[Prank call|prank phone calls]] to unsuspecting recipients.

== Career ==
Born in the [[Balvanera]] neighbourhood of [[Buenos Aires]] to [[Italian Argentine]] immigrants, De Rissio worked in a shoe factory during his early years. He began making and recording prank calls in the mid-1960s to provide comic relief for a bedridden friend. Since 1989, he has released over 40 albums of collected calls, having sold over 250 thousand copies, arguably becoming the most famous prank call artist ever in the [[Hispanophone|Spanish speaking world]]. He made extensive use of Argentine ''[[Lunfardo]]'' vernacular, and his tapes have been praised by critics as varied as humorist [[Carlos Loiseau]] and philosopher [[Alejandro Rozitchner]].

== Style ==
The general format of his jokes is to make a polite call requesting information about some product or service, to then randomly insult or otherwise antagonize the person on the other end in order to produce a verbal altercation or exchange of insults. Part of the humor is to use crude language in absurd contexts, exploiting the reactions of his victims and provoking their often agitated response.

In other cases, he begins the call with a fictitious complaint (although often based on real life anecdotes), regarding things that have supposedly happened to "his nephew." For example: "My nephew went to get two ''matafuegos'' (Spanish for fire extinguisher; literally: fire-killer) for the car, but they didn't kill the fire, they just injured it."

== Octavio Saga ==
Since 1998, Tangalanga made various calls to a gym management named Octavio, the first was in ''Dr. Tangalanga es mundial'', then Octavio apparenced in severals compilations. The Octavio calls are 12 in total, with the last performed live in 2011.

'''Ephah''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|iː|f|ə}},&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/pronunciation?lang=eng LDS.org: "Book of Mormon Pronunciation Guide"] (retrieved 2012-02-25), [[Wikipedia:IPA for English|IPA]]-ified from «ē´fä»&lt;/ref&gt; {{Lang-he|עֵיפָה}} ''‘Êp̄āh'')  was one of [[Midian (son of Abraham)|Midian]]'s five sons as listed in the [[Hebrew Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] 25:1–4; I [[Books of Chronicles|Chronicles]] 1:32–33&lt;/ref&gt; Midian, a son of [[Abraham]], was the father of Ephah, [[Epher]], [[Enoch (son of Midian)|Enoch]], [[Abida Midian|Abida]], and [[Eldaah]]. These five were the [[progenitor]]s of the [[Midianite]]s.

==Other uses==

===Biblical figure===
The name of three persons in the Old Testament, two men and one woman.

"(1) The son of Midian, descended from Abraham by his wife Keturah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_genesis25_sml.htm#genesis_25:4 Genesis 25:4] ; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_1chronicles01_sml.htm#1chronicles_1:33 1 Chronicles 1:33]), mentioned again in [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_isaiah60_sml.htm#isaiah_60:6 Isaiah 60:6] as a transporter of gold and frankincense from Sheba, who shall thus bring enlargement to Judah and praise to Yahweh. According to Fried[rich] Delitzsch, Schrader, and Hommel, `Ephah is an abbreviation of `Ayappa, the Kha-yappa Arabs of the time of Tiglath-pileser III and Sargon."&lt;ref name="isbe ephah"&gt;Charles B. Williams, "Ephah." ''International Standard Bible Encyclopedia'' (1906).&lt;/ref&gt;

"(2) A concubine of Caleb ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_1chronicles02_sml.htm#1chronicles_2:46 1 Chronicles 2:46])."&lt;ref name="isbe ephah" /&gt;

"(3) The son of Jahdai, a descendant of Judah ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_1chronicles02_sml.htm#1chronicles_2:47 1 Chronicles 2:47])."&lt;ref name="isbe ephah" /&gt;

===Geography===
The [[Book of Isaiah]], chapter 60, mentions a land of Ephah whence [[camel]]s and [[dromedary|dromedaries]] would come to Israel: "A multitude of camels shall cover you, the young camels of Midian and Ephah".  Kenneth E. Bailey suggests Ephah is a tribal land in northern Arabia.&lt;ref name="Bailey2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kenneth E. Bailey|title=Jesus Through Middle Eastern Eyes: Cultural Studies in the Gospels|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mjQAAebtAmEC&amp;pg=PA54|date=20 September 2009|publisher=InterVarsity Press|isbn=978-0-8308-7585-6|page=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Measurement===
The Hebrew word "ephah" (איפה) means a particular [[Biblical and Talmudic units of measurement|measure]] for grain, and "[[measurement|measure]]" in general. The Bible's ephah in modern terms is about 23 liters, being ten times larger than the ''omer''.&lt;ref name="BerlinBrettler2014"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yErYBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT579|title=The Jewish Study Bible: Second Edition|date=17 October 2014|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-939387-9|page=579|author1=Adele Berlin|author2=Marc Zvi Brettler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Book of Exodus]] records that an [[omer (unit)|omer]] was equal to one tenth of an "ephah".&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Exodus|16:36|}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Targum Pseudo-Jonathan]] implies that an omer was the equivalent of the capacity of 43.2 eggs.&lt;ref&gt;Based on the [[Aramaic Targum]] of pseudo-Jonathan ben Uzziel on Exodus 16:36 who says: "an ''omer'' is one-tenth of three ''seahs''." In Hebrew measures, 1 ''seah'' is equal to the capacity of 144 eggs. Three ''seahs'' are the equivalent of 432 eggs; one-tenth of this is 43.2 eggs (''The Mishnah'', ed. Herbert Danby, Oxford University Press: Oxford 1977, Appendix II, p. 798)&lt;/ref&gt; In dry weight, various rabbinical sources rule that the ''omer'' weighed between 1.560 kg. to 1.770 kg., being the quantity of flour required to separate therefrom the [[dough offering]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maimonides]] brings down its approximate weight in Egyptian ''[[dirham]]s'', writing in [[Mishnah]] ''Eduyot'' 1:2: "...And I found the rate of the dough-portion in that measurement to be approximately five-hundred and twenty ''dirhams'' of wheat flour, while all these ''dirhams'' are the Egyptian [''dirham'']." This view is repeated by [[Yosef Karo|Maran]]'s ''[[Shulhan Arukh]]'' (Hil. Hallah, [[Yoreh Deah]] §{{nbsp}}324:3) in the name of the [[Arba'ah Turim|Tur]]. In Maimonides' commentary of the Mishnah (''Eduyot'' 1:2, note 18), Rabbi [[Yosef Qafih]] explains that the weight of each Egyptian ''dirham'' was approximately 3.333 grammes, which total weight of flour requiring the separation of the dough-portion comes to appx. 1 kilo and 733 grammes. Rabbi [[Ovadiah Yosef]], in his ''Sefer Halikhot ʿOlam'' (vol. 1, pp. 288–91), makes use of a different standard for the Egyptian ''dirham'', saying that it weighed appx. 3.0 grammes, meaning the minimum requirement for separating the priest's portion is 1 kilo and 560 grammes. Others (e.g. Rabbi [[Avraham Chaim Naeh]]) say the Egyptian ''dirham'' weighed appx. 3.205 grammes, which total weight for the requirement of separating the dough-portion comes to 1 kilo and 666 gra Rabbi Shelomo Qorah (Chief Rabbi of [[Bnei Barak]]) brings down the traditional weight used in Yemen for each ''dirham'', saying that it weighed 3.36 grammes, making the total weight for the required separation of the dough-portion to be 1 kilo and 770.72 grammes.&lt;/ref&gt; It corresponds to the bath ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_ezekiel45_sml.htm#ezekiel_45:11 Ezekiel 45:11]) in liquid measure and was the standard for measuring grain and similar articles since it is classed with balances and weights ([http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_leviticus19_sml.htm#leviticus_19:36 Leviticus 19:36] ; [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_amos08_sml.htm#amos_8:5 Amos 8:5]) in the injunctions regarding just dealing in trade. In [http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah05_sml.htm#zechariah_5:6 Zechariah 5:6]–[http://www.bibler.org/versions/american_standard/asv_zechariah05_sml.htm#zechariah_5:10 10] it is used for the utensil itself.

Soon after McMullin joined the CIA, the [[September 11 attacks]] occurred, leading to an accelerated training and deployment. He spent the next decade working overseas on [[counterterrorism]] and intelligence operations as an operations officer with the [[National Clandestine Service]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://piw.sas.upenn.edu/semester-program/blogs/alumni-spotlight-evan-mcmullin-past-present-and-future-republican-party|title=Alumni Spotlight: Evan McMullin on the Past, Present, and Future of the Republican Party|last=|first=|date=2016|website=Penn in Washington|publisher=|access-date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Middle East]], [[North Africa]], and [[South Asia]].&lt;ref name="launch" /&gt; He was first deployed in 2003 and left the agency in 2010.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/is-evan-mcmullins-presidential-candidacy-just-a-protest-or-something-bigger-090046263.html|title=Is Evan McMullin’s presidential candidacy just a protest, or something bigger?|last=Ward|first=Jon|date=October 26, 2016|work=Yahoo News|access-date=October 27, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the details of his missions remain classified, former CIA officers who worked with McMullin were complimentary of his work, noting his talent for recruiting members of extremist organizations through building trust and willingness to engage in [[Human intelligence (intelligence gathering)|human intelligence]] outside the confines of the embassy. Some of his missions included information-gathering for efforts against the [[Taliban]] and [[al-Qaeda]], and collaborating with British intelligence agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duyvesteyn|first1=Isabelle|title=Intelligence and Strategic Culture}}&lt;/ref&gt; Near the end of his CIA career, he worked undercover in [[Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/global-opinions/inside-evan-mcmullins-10-years-undercover-in-the-cia/2016/10/30/10347aa6-9d42-11e6-9980-50913d68eacb_story.html|title=Inside Evan McMullin’s 10 years undercover in the CIA|last=Rogin|first=Josh|date=2016-10-30|work=The Washington Post|access-date=2016-11-06|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has stated that his work involved meeting with business and government leaders, as well as collecting information from terrorist operatives.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

After leaving the CIA and graduating from the [[Wharton School]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thedp.com/article/2016/08/wharton-graduate-announces-independent-presidential-bid-to-oppose-trump|title=Wharton graduate announces independent presidential bid to oppose Trump|date=August 8, 2016|newspaper=[[The Daily Pennsylvanian]]|access-date=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMullin began working for the Investment Banking Division at [[Goldman Sachs]],&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt; and he remained at the company about a year and a half.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2016/10/15/us/politics/evan-mcmullin-campaign-utah.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, he volunteered for [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Mitt Romney's presidential campaign]], which indirectly led to him being recruited by Republicans on the [[House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] looking for an adviser with counter-terrorism experience. In 2013, McMullin was an International Advisory Board member for the Kennedy Center for International Studies at [[Brigham Young University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kennedy.byu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Bridges14-2.pdf|title=Evan McMullin: International counselor extraordinaire|date=2014|publisher=Bridges: BYU Alumni Magazine|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, McMullin became a senior adviser on national security issues for the [[House Committee on Foreign Affairs]] for the [[113th Congress]].&lt;ref name="swalshe1" /&gt; In 2015, McMullin became the chief policy director of the [[House Republican Conference]] under Chairwoman [[Cathy McMorris Rodgers]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-[[Washington (state)|Wash.]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/huddle/2015/01/john-boehners-revenge-mcconnell-gets-rough-reminder-of-senate-rules-on-first-day-scalise-is-still-fundraising-212543 |title= John Boehner’s revenge – McConnell gets rough reminder of Senate rules on first day – Scalise is still fundraising |author=Jeff Selsar |date=January 7, 2015 |publisher= Poltico |accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was from this position that he watched the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican primaries]], and when he began to speak out against Trump he was urged by some Republicans to stay out of the fray.&lt;ref name=SLTrib/&gt; McMullin resigned as chief policy director shortly before declaring his run for the presidency in August 2016.&lt;ref name="swalshe1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Walshe|first1=Shushannah|title=Former CIA Officer Evan McMullin Launches Independent Presidential Bid|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/cia-officer-evan-mcmullin-launches-independent-presidential-bid/story?id=41201256|accessdate=August 8, 2016|publisher=ABC News|date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2016, McMullin launched a [[Evan McMullin presidential campaign, 2016|presidential campaign]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 election]] for [[President of the United States]], as an independent candidate backed by the organization [[Better for America]]. McMullin described himself as a [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] alternative to the two major political parties' candidates, [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] nominee [[Donald Trump]].

McMullin lost the election, receiving 725,902 votes nationwide (0.53%).&lt;ref name="LeipAtlas2016PrezResults"&gt;{{cite news |last=Leip |first=David |date=December 17, 2016 |title=2016 Presidential General Election Results |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/index.html |newspaper=[[Dave Leip's Atlas of U.S. Presidential Elections]]|location=[[Newton, Massachusetts]] |access-date=December 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His best performance came in his native [[Utah]], where he received about 20% of the vote and came in third place behind Trump and Clinton.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; After the election, McMullin said that he would start a "new conservative movement" reaching out to "non-traditional conservative voters... who feel disaffected."

On August 8, 2016, McMullin announced that he would run as a candidate for [[President of the United States]] in the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 presidential election]] as an independent.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/09/us/politics/evan-mcmullin-independent-candidate.html|title=Evan McMullin, Anti-Trump Republican, Is Said to Plan Independent Presidential Bid|author= [[Maggie Haberman|Haberman, Maggie]]|date=August 8, 2016|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|issn=0362-4331|access-date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/mckaycoppins/anti-trump-republican-launching-independent-presidential-bid|title=Anti-Trump Republican Launching Independent Presidential Bid|last=Coppins|first=McKay|date=August 8, 2016|website=[[BuzzFeed News]]|publisher=|access-date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hinterlandgazette.com/2016/08/joe-scarborough-evan-mcmullin-will-launch-presidential-bid-derail-trump.html|title=Joe Scarborough: Evan McMullin Will Launch Independent Presidential Bid |date=August 8, 2016|website=hinterlandgazette.com|publisher=Hinterland Gazette|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politico.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/08/evan-mcmullin-2016-presidential-run-226784|title=Anti-Trump Republican Evan McMullin to launch independent bid for presidency|newspaper=[[Politico]]|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="twitter"&gt;[https://twitter.com/Evan_McMullin Twitter page] ("Standing up to run for president because it’s never too late to do the right thing.") Retrieved August 8, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; McMullin decided to run due to his belief that Republican nominee [[Donald Trump]] was unfit for the office and his strong opposition to Democratic nominee [[Hillary Clinton]]'s liberalism. He had personally lobbied several Congresspeople to run under the [[Better for America]] banner, but when none would run and it was suggested to him that he should run himself, he decided to do so.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

McMullin had the support of several anti-Trump Republican donors&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-us-2016-37012626|title=Evan McMullin: Independent candidate launches presidential bid|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/08/anti-trump-republican-evan-mcmullin/494870/|title=Anti-Trump Republicans Take One More Shot at the White House|first=Priscilla|last=Alvarez|publisher=[[The Atlantic]]|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and his presidential bid was also backed by several former members of [[Better for America]], a 501(c)(4) organization dedicated to getting nationwide [[ballot access]] for an independent candidate for President in the 2016 election.&lt;ref name="launch" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.betterforamerica.com/ |title=This year is different |publisher=Better For America |date= |accessdate=August 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMullin's campaign is supported by some members of the "[[Never Trump]]" movement.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; Trump repeatedly attacked McMullin, referring to him as "McMuffin" and stating that "I never even heard of this guy before. Nobody did."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Firozi|first1=Paulina|title=Trump calls Evan McMullin 'McMuffin' in rally speech|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/310852-trump-calls-evan-mcmullin-mcmuffin-in-rally-speech|website=thehill.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMullin's late entrance into the race caused him to miss several state ballot deadlines,&lt;ref name="rleonard1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leonard|first1=Randy|last2=Kelly|first2=Ryan|title=McMullin Presidential Run an Uphill Battle, per State Filing Deadlines|url=http://www.rollcall.com/news/politics/independent-presidential-run-uphill-battle-per-state-filing-deadlines|accessdate=August 8, 2016|publisher=Roll Call|date=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ultimately he was only able to [[Evan McMullin presidential campaign, 2016#Ballot status|appear on the ballot]] in eleven states, with write-in eligibility in many other states.&lt;ref name = "HowToVote"&gt;{{cite web|title=How to Vote for Evan|url=https://www.evanmcmullin.com/how_to_vote_for_evan|website=Evan McMullin for president|accessdate=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; As such he did not appear on enough ballots to win the necessary [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]] majority of 270 electoral votes. Instead McMullin hoped to deny a majority of the electoral vote to either of the two major party candidates. In such a scenario, under the terms of the [[Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Twelfth Amendment]], the House of Representatives would select the new president from the top-three electoral vote winners.&lt;ref name="bjacobs1" /&gt;

The same day that McMullin launched his independent bid, it was announced that [[Kahlil Byrd]] and [[Chris Ashby]], Republican strategists with expertise in third-party ballot access, would form a [[super PAC]] called [[Stand Up America]] to support McMullin's campaign. Byrd is a former adviser to [[Better for America]]. The PAC would be used for TV and digital ads, live events, and grass-roots organizing, but would not sue for ballot access.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2016/08/08/new-super-pac-launching-to-support-evan-mcmullins-independent-white-house-bid/ |title=New super PAC launching to support Evan McMullin independent White House bid|publisher=''The Washington Post''|accessdate=August 8, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, McMullin named [[Mindy Finn]] as his running mate.&lt;ref name=finn1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/presidential-candidate-evan-mcmullin-picks-mindy-finn-running/story?id=42629024 |title=Presidential Candidate Evan McMullin Picks Mindy Finn as Running Mate|publisher=ABC News|date= |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finn had previously worked for [[Twitter]] and as a digital strategist for the RNC and the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]].&lt;ref name=finn1/&gt; Because Finn's selection came after the ballot paperwork deadlines, Finn did not appear on any of the state ballots. Instead McMullin's friend's name, Nathan Johnson, was submitted as a placeholder.&lt;ref name=HowToVote/&gt;

McMullin's support surged in Utah in October after the release of [[Donald Trump and Billy Bush recording controversy|a 2005 audio recording]] in which Donald Trump was heard bragging in lewd terms about making sexual advances on women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/10/donald-trump-tape-evan-mcmullin-229712 |work=Politico |date=October 13, 2016 |title=Trump’s lurid tape just made Evan McMullin relevant}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 19, an Emerson College poll showed McMullin leading the race in Utah by 4 points over Donald Trump and 7 points over Hillary Clinton. McMullin's popularity in Utah – and Trump's unpopularity – appears owing to an unusual shift of [[Mormons]] away from the Republican candidate.&lt;ref name="Bailey, Sarah Pulliam"/&gt; Had McMullin won Utah, it would have been the first time since [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]] that a non-major-party candidate won a state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.sltrib.com/news/4485415-155/evan-mcmullin-takes-the-lead-in|title=Evan McMullin takes the lead in latest Utah presidential poll|work=Salt Lake Tribune|date= October 19, 2016|accessdate=October 21, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His strong polling in Utah led Benjamin Morris, writing for [[FiveThirtyEight]], to call him the "third-most likely person to be the next president of the United States" as of October 13.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morris|first1=Benjamin|title=How Evan McMullin Could Win Utah And The Presidency|url=http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-evan-mcmullin-could-win-utah-and-the-presidency/?ex_cid=2016-forecast|accessdate=October 14, 2016|work=[[FiveThirtyEight]]|date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, McMullin came in third place in Utah, receiving 21.54% of the state's popular vote, behind both Donald Trump (who received 45.54% and the state's six electoral votes) and Hillary Clinton (who received 27.46%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://electionresults.utah.gov/elections/federal|title=Utah Election Preliminary Results: Statewide Federal: President/Vice President|publisher=Utah Secretary of State|accessdate=December 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMullin also took third in Idaho with 6.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.sos.idaho.gov/ELECT/results/2016/General/statewide_totals.html|publisher=[[Secretary of State of Idaho]]|date=December 30, 2016|title=Nov 08, 2016 General Election Results: Statewide Totals}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMullin promised that, despite his defeat, the "fight would continue" for his new conservative movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=England |first=Katie |url=http://www.heraldextra.com/news/local/govt-and-politics/elections/despite-loss-mcmullin-and-supporters-look-forward-to-continuing-new/article_bcc0f64d-f21f-59db-a022-c8858e8c7756.html |title=Despite loss, McMullin and supporters look forward to continuing new, conservative movement |work=Provo Daily Herald |date=November 9, 2016 |accessdate=January 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the 2016 campaign==
After the 2016 campaign, McMullin has continued to be strongly critical of Trump and Putin.&lt;ref name="RubinStandUp"/&gt; In a December 2016, op-ed, McMullin blasted Trump as a threat to [[United States Constitution|American constitutional government]], saying that the president-elect's actions were "consistent with the authoritarian playbook" and "undermined critical democratic norms including peaceful debate and transitions of power, commitment to truth, freedom from foreign interference and abstention from the use of executive power for political retribution."&lt;ref name="Trump's Threat to the Constitution"/&gt;

In late January 2017, McMullin and his former running mate Finn announced the establishment of a [[501(c)(4) organization]], '''Stand Up Republic'''.&lt;ref name="RubinStandUp"&gt;Jennifer Rubin, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/right-turn/wp/2017/01/25/evan-mcmullin-makes-a-splash-by-going-after-trump-and-putin/ Evan McMullin makes a splash by going after Trump and Putin], ''Washington Post'' (January 25, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; The group focuses on "defense of democratic (small 'd') norms, constitutionalism and civic involvement."&lt;ref name="RubinStandUp"/&gt; Speaking on so-called "[[alternative facts]]" McMullin said: "Undermining truth is a typical authoritarian tactic. It is incredibly dangerous ... We never thought we'd be talking about this in America."&lt;ref name="RubinStandUp"/&gt; In a February 2017 op-ed, McMullin wrote that "President Trump's disturbing Russian connections present an acute danger to American national security." He called upon congressional Republicans to "recommit to patriotic prudence" and "demand that Attorney General [[Jeff Sessions]] appoint an independent [[special counsel]] to investigate [[2016 United States election interference by Russia|Russia's assault on American democracy]] and Mr. Trump's possible collusion with the Kremlin.&lt;ref&gt;Evan McMullin, [https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/17/opinion/a-party-to-the-russian-connection.html Republicans, Protect the Nation], ''New York Times'' (February 17, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

When asked if there was any possibility of him running for [[Jason Chaffetz]]'s seat in 2018, he answered: "It is likely that I will seek public office again. That might be in 2018 or it might be sometime down the road, perhaps very far down the road. I genuinely just don't know yet. I'm very focused on things that I think need to be done ASAP and Mindy Finn and I, with our team at Stand Up Republic, advancing them now. It is possible that I will challenge Chaffetz or Senator Hatch, but there are a lot of factors that go into that decision."&lt;ref&gt;McMullin, Evan.

On [[Same-sex marriage in the United States|same-sex marriage]], McMullin said in 2016 that he believes in the "traditional marriage between a man and a woman" but he "respects" the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]]'s decision in ''[[Obergefell v.

McMullin favors cuts to [[entitlement program]]s such as [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and has proposed [[means-testing]] the program and raising the retirement age.&lt;ref name="RomboyRoche"/&gt;

===Science and the environment===
McMullin accepts the [[scientific consensus on climate change]], saying: "I do believe that the climate is changing, and I do believe that human activity is contributing to it. If I were president, I would increase investment in technologies that can help us limit and decrease our carbon emissions."&lt;ref name="WBUR"/&gt;

===Domestic issues===
McMullin has said that if elected president, he would appoint [[Originalism|originalist]] judges to the Supreme Court,&lt;ref name="WBUR"/&gt; "in the mold of [[Antonin Scalia]] and [[Clarence Thomas]]."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Jacobs, [https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/evan-mcmullin-independent-presidential-candidate-trump Evan McMullin on his presidential bid: 'Someone needed to step up' to Trump], ''The Guardian'' (September 20, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

On immigration, McMullin supports border security but not mass deportation.&lt;ref name="RubinInterview"/&gt;

On health care, McMullin supports the provision of the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]] that blocks health insurance companies from denying coverage or discriminating against people with [[preexisting condition]]s.

=== Foreign and national security policy ===
On the [[Syrian Civil War]], McMullin described himself as a "vocal advocate for international action that would stop [[Bashir al-Assad|Assad]]'s [[Human rights violations during the Syrian Civil War|slaughter of innocent Syrians]], and eventually set the stage for a negotiated departure from the country."&lt;ref name="Cupp"&gt;[[S.E.

McMullin supports keeping the [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]] open.&lt;ref name="RubinInterview"/&gt;

McMullin has harshly criticized the [[Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action|international nuclear agreement with Iran]]. He stated: "We've got to certainly enforce the deal as it is, but I believe in strengthening sanctions on Iran to force them to make further concessions. I also believe in putting the military option clearly back on the table if Iran decides to not keep its end of the deal and if it ultimately decides to pursue nuclear weapons."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.evanmcmullin.com/evan_mcmullin_s_response_to_reuters_story_regarding_secret_exemptions_for_iran_after_nuclear_deal Evan McMullin's response to Reuters' story regarding 'secret' exemptions for Iran after nuclear deal] (press release), McMullin for President Committee, Inc. (September 1, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

McMullin told [[ABC News]] that he believed [[Donald Trump]]'s public comments were frustrating U.S. [[counterterrorism]] efforts. "What he doesn't realize is that we actually depend on Muslims to do counterterrorism, to wage war against terrorists." Trump's remarks concerning Muslims "decreases their willingness to work with us, with other Muslims, and that impedes our ability to destroy ISIS."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Stark|first=Liz |url=http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/evan-mcmullin-donald-trump-dangerous-isis/story?id=41307571 |title=Why Evan McMullin Says Donald Trump Is More Dangerous Than ISIS |publisher=ABC News |date=August 11, 2016 |accessdate=August 25, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; McMullin also criticized Trump's "allegiance to [Russian President] [[Vladimir Putin]]" and accused Putin of engaging in a campaign to destabilize European and North American countries "through fomenting discord between different racial groups, different ethnic groups and different religious groups."&lt;ref name="bjacobs1"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ben|title=Evan McMullin on his presidential bid: 'Someone needed to step up' to Trump |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/sep/20/evan-mcmullin-independent-presidential-candidate-trump |accessdate=October 11, 2016|work=The Guardian|date=September 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, McMullin helped to bring Caesar, a defected Syrian military photographer who leaked 55,000 images depicting abuses by the regime (which formed the basis for the [[2014 Syrian detainee report]]), to speak before the [[House Foreign Affairs Committee]], according to ''[[The Christian Science Monitor]]''. McMullin clashed with State Department officials he suspected were holding up the hearing. McMullin claimed that State Department officials wanted to have a closed hearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Iaconangelo |first=David |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2016/0827/Why-this-independent-candidate-is-hoping-the-center-can-hold |title=Why this independent candidate is hoping the center can hold |work=The Christian Science Monitor |date=August 27, 2016 |accessdate=August 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McMullin opposes the use of [[torture]] and has criticized Trump's support for it.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walsh, [https://www.yahoo.com/news/evan-mcmullin-donald-trump-cia-000000164.html Independent candidate Evan McMullin: Trump is tapping into America's 'darkest prejudices'], ''Yahoo News'' (August 12, 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;

}}'''Farley Norman''' is a professor of psychological sciences at [[Western Kentucky University]]. He is a co-director of the Gustav Fechner Perception Laboratory at Western Kentucky University,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wku.edu/psychological-sciences/labs/vision_and_haptics/index.php|title=J. Farley Norman - Vision and Haptics Lab {{!}} Western Kentucky University|website=www.wku.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with his wife, Hideko Norman.

== Education ==
Norman spent a majority of his undergraduate years studying engineering and mathematics, but ultimately earned his B.A. in psychology from the [[University of Texas at Austin]] (1983). He then completed his Master's (1989) and Ph.D. (1990) in [[experimental psychology]] from [[Vanderbilt University]] under the mentorship of Joseph Lappin. He later became a post-doctoral fellow at [[Brandeis University]] and [[The Ohio State University]], where he was further trained as a research scientist by James T. Todd.

== Academic career ==
Norman began his professional academic career in 1996 at [[Western Kentucky University]] as a professor of psychology. He has taught a variety of courses, reflecting his interests in sensory and perceptual systems, psychopharmacology, history of psychology, and psychology and science fiction.

In addition to his role as professor, researcher, mentor, and advisor, Norman has served as the consulting editor of the journal ''[[Perception &amp; Psychophysics]]''.

== Research ==
Norman's research has encompassed a variety of topics in human [[perception]], particularly the perception of distance, spatial relationships (e.g., exocentric and egocentric distances), [[Motion perception|motion]], and the 3-dimensional shape of environmental objects. His laboratory studies both the [[Visual perception|visual]] and [[haptic perception]] of 3-D object shape, combining computer programming and psychophysical methodologies to investigate how human observers perceive 3-D shape.

One of the hallmark features of Norman's research has been his exploration of the visual and haptic perception of [[Ecological validity (perception)|ecologically valid]] objects (i.e., those that occur naturally in the real world).&lt;ref&gt;Norman, J. F., Norman, H. F., Clayton, A. M., Lianekhammy, J., &amp; Zielke, G. (2004). The visual and haptic perception of natural object shape. Perception &amp; Psychophysics, 66(2), 342–351. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://doi.org/10.3758/BF03194883&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Norman, J. F., Phillips, F., Holmin, J. S., Norman, H. F., Beers, A., Boswell, A. M., et al. (2012). Solid shape discrimination from vision and haptics: natural objects (Capsicum annuum) and Gibson’s “feelies.” Experimental Brain Research, 222(3), 321–332. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://doi.org/10.1007/s00221-012-3220-7&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, he has used a variety of stimuli recreated from bell peppers (''[[Capsicum annuum|Capsicum annum]]'') in the form of plastic casts as well as laser-scanned, 3-D computer models available for 3-D printing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://academics.skidmore.edu/blogs/flip/?page_id=826|title=Bell Peppers|date=2016-09-27|work=Flip Phillips|access-date=2018-04-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His research has also explored the effects of aging upon 3-D perception, with often encouraging results. Many of Norman's studies has demonstrated that older adults are able to effectively perceive many aspects of 3-D object shape well into their 70s and 80s (e.g.,&lt;ref&gt;[https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758/s13414-017-1294-9 Norman, J.

''PLoS one'', ''8'', e68577. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0068577]&lt;/ref&gt;).

Norman has authored over 90 peer-reviewed publications in scientific journals, as well as four book chapters (including chapters in ''Fechner's Legacy in Psychology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Fechner's Legacy in Psychology: 150 Years of Elementary Psychophysics|last=Solomon|first=Joshua A.|publisher=Brill Academic Pub|year=2011|isbn=9004192204|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Neural Networks for Vision and Image Processing''&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, G. A. &amp; Grossberg, S. (1992). ''Neural Networks for Vision and Image Processing''. Cambridge, MA: The MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Accomplishments ==
In 2005, Norman was awarded fellowship in the [[Association for Psychological Science]] (APS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologicalscience.org/fellows/fellows-new.cfm|title=Association for Psychological Science: APS Fellows|website=www.psychologicalscience.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the first to be admitted to this association when it first began in 1988, and is one of the founding members. In addition, he is a past member of the [[National Science Foundation]] (NSF) Perception, Action &amp; Cognition Grant Review Panel.

Norman has been recognized for his research and teaching many times throughout his tenure at [[Western Kentucky University]]. Among these accolades are a University Award for Faculty Excellence in Research/Creativity (2000), College Award for Faculty Excellence in Research/Creativity (College of Education and Behavioral Sciences, 2006; 2010), and College Award for Faculty Excellence in Teaching (College of Education and Behavioral Sciences, 2008).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wku.edu/presidentemeritus/convocation/2012.php|title=President's Convocation - August 24, 2012 {{!}} Western Kentucky University|website=www.wku.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Norman has been noted for his excellence in mentoring student research, having more than 170 student co-authorships on his published research articles.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In 2018, one of his students, Lauren Pedersen, was named a Goldwater Scholar, one of only 211 nationwide, and the only one named in the state of Kentucky.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wku.edu/news/index.php?view=article&amp;articleid=6290|title=WKU student selected as 2018 Goldwater Scholar|work=Media Relations|access-date=2018-07-31|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Felice Napoleone Canevaro''' (7 July 1838 – 30 December 1926) was an Italian admiral and politician and a [[Senate of the Kingdom of Italy|senator of the Kingdom of Italy]]. He served as both Minister of the Navy and [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs|Minister of Foreign Affairs]] and was a recipient of the [[Order of Saints Maurice and Lazarus]]. In his naval career, he was best known for his actions during the [[Italian Wars of Independence]] and later as commander of the [[International Squadron (Crete intervention, 1897–1898)|International Squadron]] off [[Crete]] in 1897–1898.

==Biography==
The descendant of a [[Liguria]]n family originally from [[Zoagli]], Canevaro was born in [[Lima]], [[Peru]], to Giuseppe and Francesca Velaga.&lt;ref name=treccani&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/felice-napoleone-canevaro_(Dizionario-Biografico)/ |first=Gabriele  |last=Mariano |title=Canevaro, Felice Napoleone |work=Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani  |volume=18 |year=1975 |language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Naval career===
In 1852, Canevaro was admitted to the [[Kingdom of Sardinia]]'s Royal Navy School at [[Genoa]], completing the course of instruction in 1855 and receiving a [[Commissioned officer|commission]] as an [[Ensign (rank)|ensign second class]].

====Italian Wars of Independence====
In 1859, with the rank of second [[Lieutenant (naval)|lieutenant]], Canevaro took part in [[Royal Sardinian Navy]] operations in the [[Adriatic Sea]] aboard the [[Troop transport|transport]] ''Beroldo'' and the sailing [[frigate]] {{ship|Italian frigate|Des Geneys||2}} during the [[Second Italian War of Independence]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

In 1860, Canevaro arrived in [[Palermo]], [[Sicily]], aboard {{ship|Italian frigate|Maria Adelaide||2}}, the [[flagship]] of the Sardinian [[Squadron (naval)|squadron]]. When the supporters of the Italian nationalist leader [[General officer|General]] [[Giuseppe Garibaldi]] organized their navy, he resigned from the Royal Sardinian Navy to enlist in the Garibaldian navy. Aboard the [[steam frigate]] ''Tukory'' on the night of 13 August 1860, Canevaro distinguished himself during an unsuccessful attempt to board the [[Kingdom of the Two Sicilies]] steam [[ship-of-the-line]] ''Monarca'' while she was anchored in the port of [[Castellammare di Stabia]]. He received the [[Silver Medal of Military Valor]] for his actions during this engagement.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

In the autumn of 1860, Canevarro was reinstated in the Royal Sardinian Navy. While embarked on the Sardinian steam frigate {{ship|Italian frigate|Carlo Alberto|1853|2}} from December 1860 to March 1861, he took part in the [[Siege of Gaeta (1860)|Siege of Gaeta]] and a [[siege]] of [[Messina]] during operations in which ''Carlo Alberto'' repeatedly exchanged fire with hostile forces at close range along the coast. After the campaign, he was made a Knight of the [[Military Order of Savoy]], and in 1863, he was promoted to ''[[Lieutenant (naval)|luogotenente de vascello]]''. In 1865–1866, Canevaro was on board the steam frigate {{ship|Italian frigate|Principe Umberto||2}}, under the command [[Guglielmo Acton]], during a long cruise that included a [[transatlantic voyage]], operations along the [[Atlantic]] coast of [[South America]], a transit of the [[Strait of Magellan]] into the [[Pacific Ocean]], and steaming up the coast of [[Chile]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

On returning to Italy, he was assigned to the [[broadside ironclad]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re di Portogallo||2}}, commanded by Augusto Riboty. Aboard ''Re di Portogallo'', he took part in 1866 in the [[Third Italian War of Independence]], during which the ship was engaged in operations against the fortress of [[Vis (island)|Lissa]] in the [[Adriatic Sea]]. As [[flagship]] of the 3rd Division, and with Canevaro aboard as the division's chief-of-staff, ''Re di Portogallo'' led the division's attack on [[Porto San Giorgio]] on 18 July 1866.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

====Battle of Lissa====

On 20 July 1866, ''Re di Portogallo'' played a particularly prominent role in the [[Battle of Lissa (1866)|Battle of Lissa]] against the [[Austrian Empire|Austrian]] fleet.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; She first opened fire on the Austrian steam [[corvette]] {{SMS|Erzherzog Friedrich|1857|6}}, scoring a hit below the [[waterline]] that opened a leak that caused more water to enter  ''Erzherzog Friedrich'' than her pumps could handle, forcing '' Erzherzog Friedrich'' to retreat in the direction of Lissa. While chasing the damaged ''Erzherzog Friedrich'', ''Re di Portogallo'' sighted the Austrian steam [[ship-of-the-line]] {{SMS|Kaiser|1858|6}}, which, although seriously damaged by a broadside fired by the Italian [[Ironclad warship|ironclad]] [[Naval ram|ram]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Affondatore||2}}, was approaching to defend ''Erzherzog Friedrich''.&lt;ref name=Martino&gt;Ermanno Martino, ''Lissa 1866: perché?'' in ''Storia Militare'' n. 214 and 215, July–August 2011 (Italian).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=benninghof&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.avalanchepress.com/Battle_of_Lissa.php |last=Benninghof |first=Mike |title=Deadly Fishermen: The Battle of Lissa, 20 July 1866 |website=Avalanche Press |date=September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Re di Portogallo'' attempted to ram ''Kaiser'', but ''Kaiser'' steered toward ''Re di Portogallo'' and the two ships collided violently head-on.&lt;ref name=Martino/&gt; ''Kaiser'' had the worst of the collision, which badly damaged her [[Bow (ship)|bow]], destroyed her [[bowsprit]], and left her [[Figurehead (object)|figurehead]], a wooden statue of the Austrian emperor Kaiser [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]], stuck in the [[Hull (ship)|hull]] of ''Re di Portogallo''; it became an Italian war trophy.&lt;ref name=Martino/&gt;&lt;ref name=benninghof/&gt; Entangled with ''Kaiser'', ''Re di Portogallo'' pummeled her with gunfire at close range, inflicting many casualties on her crew and bringing down her [[foresail]], which crashed onto her [[Funnel (ship)|funnel]]. ''Re di Portogallo'' put her engines astern to pull away from ''Kaiser'' and maneuver to ram her again, but could not resume her attack because smoke had concealed ''Kaiser'', which the officers of ''Re di Portogallo'' mistakenly believed may have sunk. As the battle continued ''Re di Portogallo'' found herself surrounded by four Austrian ships, but she managed to escape from them thanks to the ability of her commander, Riboty.&lt;ref name=Martino/&gt; One of the Italian ships most heavily involved in the battle,&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; ''Re di Portogallo'' suffered serious damage, including the loss of her [[anchor]]s and some of her boats and having {{convert|18|m|ft}} of her armor dislodged, most of this damage occurring during the duel with ''Kaiser''. Although the outcome of the Battle of Lissa ultimately was disastrous for the Italian fleet,&lt;ref name=Martino/&gt; Canevaro received a second award of the Silver Medal for Military Valor,&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; while ''Re di Portogallo''{{'}}s comanding officer Riboty received the [[Gold Medal of Military Valor]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marina.difesa.it/storiacultura/storia/medaglie/Pagine/RibotyAugusto.aspx marina.difesa.it Augusto Riboty]&lt;/ref&gt;

====1870s–1890s====

Promoted to ''[[Frigate captain|capitano di fregata]]'' in 1869, Canevaro served as a [[naval attaché]] at the Italian embassy in [[London]] from March 1874 to August 1876. From January 1877 to March 1879, while in command of the [[cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Colombo||2}}, he circumnavigated the globe, departing Italy, transiting the [[Suez Canal]], skirting [[Asia]], visiting ports in [[China]] and the [[Netherlands East Indies]] – where ''Colombo'' recovered the body of the Italian general and politician [[Nino Bixio]], who had died of [[cholera]] in [[Banda Aceh]] on [[Sumatra]] in 1873 – and then went on to [[Empire of Japan|Japan]], [[Russia]] (including [[Siberia]]), [[Australia]] and the [[Americas]]. After transiting the [[Strait of Magellan]] into the Atlantic Ocean, ''Colombo'' steamed up the coast of [[South America]] to the [[Caribbean]], then crossed the Atlantic to return to Italy.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

Promoted to ''[[Ship-of-the-line captain|capitano di vascello]]'', Canevaro performed various important duties, including service as chief-of-staff of the 3rd Maritime Department headquartered at [[Venice]], second-in-command of the [[Italian Naval Academy]], and commanding officer of the ironclad [[battleship]] {{ship|Italian ironclad|Italia||2}}. In 1884, while in command of ''Italia'', he played an active role in humanitarian work and [[public health]] during a cholera epidemic in [[La Spezia]], and he received the [[Silver Medal for Civil Valor]] for these efforts.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

Promoted to [[counter admiral]] (the equivalent of [[rear admiral]]) in 1887,&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; Canevaro assumed command of the [[arsenal]] of [[Taranto]] and later of the 2nd Naval Division of the Permanent Squadron.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; He was promoted to [[vice admiral]] in 1893,&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; and [[King of Italy|King]] [[Umberto I of Italy|Umberto I]] appointed him a [[Senator of the Kingdom of Italy]] – an appointment for life – in 1896,&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; the same year in which he assumed command of the ''Regia Marina''{{'}}s Naval Squadron.

====International Squadron====

In February 1897, when a Christian uprising against the authority of the [[Ottoman Empire]] broke out on the island of [[Crete]], Canevaro arrived at Crete in command of the 1st Division of the 1st Squadron, consisting of the ironclad battleships {{ship|Italian ironclad|Sicilia||2}} (his flagship) and {{ship|Italian ironclad|Re Umberto||2}}, the [[protected cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Vesuvio||2}}, and the [[torpedo cruiser]] {{ship|Italian cruiser|Euridice||2}}. Canevaro – who relieved the commander of the Italian naval squadron, Rear Admiral Gualterio, who had previously been in command of the 2nd Naval Division – assumed command of the [[International Squadron (Cretan intervention, 1897–1898)|International Squadron]] of warships off Crete on 16 or 17 February 1897 (sources differ) as the most senior admiral present, and took up duties as president of the "Admirals Council," which consisted of the senior admirals present off Crete of each of the six countries participating in the International Squadron.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt180297&gt;{{cite news |url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1897/02/18/102485379.pdf |title=The Powers Take Action; Sharp Warning Issued to Prince George Against Hostilities |work=The New York Times |date=18 February 1897}}&lt;/ref&gt; The squadron put landing detachments ashore, but Christian insurgents continued to attack Ottoman forces and Canevaro soon ordered International Squadron ships to bombard them during February and March 1897 to stop the fighting. Although some political opponents in the Italian legislature attacked him for ordering the International Squadron to bombard the insurgents, Canevaro received great credit during his time in command of the squadron for his ability to exercise diplomacy and mediate disputes between the six Great Powers – [[Austria-Hungary]], [[France]], the [[German Empire]], Italy, the [[Russian Empire]], and the [[United Kingdom]] – making up the squadron and for the way in which he dealt with the confusing and anarchic situation on Crete, balancing humanitarian compassion and a spirit of conciliation in his dealings with Greek, Christian insurgent, and Ottoman forces on the island with the occasional need to use force to halt fighting and quell disturbances. Before leaving the International Squadron in 1898, Canevaro negotiated an agreement under which all combat on Crete would cease and [[Greece]] and the Ottoman Empire would withdraw their forces from the island in anticipation of the creation of an autonomous [[Cretan State]] under the [[suzerainty]] of the [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; Such was his reputation that when the creation of an office of [[High commissioner|High Commissioner]] of the Cretan State was proposed in the spring of 1898, Canevaro received an invitation to become the first high commissioner, but he declined the offer, and instead [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark]] became the first high commissioner when the Cretan State finally came into existence in December 1898.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

===Government minister===

When [[Prime Minister of Italy]] [[Antonio Starabba, Marchese di Rudinì]], formed the government for his fifth ministry, Canevaro turned over command of the International Squadron to its next-most-senior admiral, Rear Admiral [[Édouard Pottier]] of the [[French Navy]], and returned to Italy to serve as di Rudini′s [[Italian Minister of the Navy|Minister of the Navy]]. Taking office on 1 June 1898, he served only four weeks, until the di Rudini government was replaced on 29 June 1898 by that of Prime Minister [[General officer|General]] [[Luigi Pelloux]]. On the same day Pelloux took office, Canevaro changed portfolios to become the [[Italian Minister of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt; In his new role, he attempted to continue Italy′s policy of loyalty to the [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] with Austria-Hungary and the German Empire and of continued warm relations with the United Kingdom, but at the same time worked toward relaxing tensions with France, and he conducted secret negotiations with the French for a commercial treaty, which the countries signed on 26 November 1898. He also resisted pressure from Germany to change the status of the Cretan State, supporting its continuation as an autonomous state under the suzerainty of the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

However, despite his successes in negotiations on Crete while in command of the International Squadron, Canevaro's talent for leading military forces did not translate into success in international diplomacy when it came to larger issues. During the [[Fashoda Crisis]] of 1899 between France and the United Kingdom, Canevaro conducted intensive diplomacy as part of the ongoing European "[[Scramble for Africa]]" in an effort to gain French and British recognition of an Italian interest in [[Libya]], but when the French and British concluded an agreement on 21 March 1899 that resolved the crisis, they offered no such recognition. Canevaro also was unsuccessful when in the wake of a number of anarchist attacks in [[Europe]] – one of which resulted in the stabbing death of [[Empress of Austria]] and [[Queen of Hungary]] [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Elizabeth]] on 10 September 1898 – he proposed an international anti-anarchist conference of diplomats and government security and judicial officials to address the situation; although some countries agreed to participate, the conference never took place.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

A final blow to Canevaro's diplomatic career came in the "San Mun Affair" of 1899, in which Italy demanded that the [[Chinese Empire]] grant it a lease for a naval coaling station at [[China]]'s [[Sanmen Bay]] (known as "San-Mun Bay" to the Italians) similar to the lease the German Empire had secured in 1898 at [[Kiautschou Bay concession|Kiaochow Bay]]. From Sanmen Bay, Italy hoped to establish an area of influence in [[Chekiang]]. The Russian Empire and the [[United States]] opposed the Italian demand, but the Italian ambassador in China, [[Renato De Martino]], led Canevaro to believe that the area was ripe for the taking. The British government, although ambivalent toward the Italian move, gave its approval as long as Italy did not use force against the Chinese, but the British did not inform Canevaro that the United Kingdom′s representatives in China had advised that Italy could not achieve its goals without using force. Believing the opportunity to pursue Italy's interests in China was at hand, Canevaro had de Martino pass Italy′s demands to the Chinese imperial government in the winter of 1899, but the Chinese summarily rejected them on 4 March 1899. On 8 March, Canevaro instructed De Martino to present the demands again as an ultimatum and authorized the [[armored cruiser]] ''[[Italian cruiser Marco Polo|Marco Polo]]'' and [[protected cruiser]] ''[[Italian cruiser Elba|Elba]]'' to occupy the bay. When the British ambassador in [[Rome]] reminded him that the United Kingdom did not support an Italian use of force, Canevaro issued a counterorder cancelling his authorization to use the two [[cruiser]]s in the bay, but De Martino received the counterorder before he received the original authorization to employ the ships. Unable to decipher the counterorder, De Martino presented the Italian ultimatum to China again on 10 March 1899, and China immediately refused to comply. Italy withdrew its ultimatum, becoming at the end of the 19th century the first and only [[Western world|Western]] power to fail to achieve its territorial goals in China. The fiasco was an embarrassment that gave Italy – still stung by its defeat at the hands of the [[Ethiopian Empire]] in the [[Battle of Adwa|Battle of Adowa]] in 1896 – the appearance of a third-rate power. On 14 March 1899, Canevaro attempted to present the affair to the [[Parliament of the Kingdom of Italy|Italian Parliament]] in a positive light, saying that be believed that China had rejected the Italian ultimatum in order to maintain a positive and productive relationship with Italy uninterrupted by negotiations over the bay, but such was the domestic criticism of the Italian failure as a humiliation and international criticism of it as a needless and unjustified provocation that Pelloux announced the resignation of his entire cabinet on 14 May 1899. He excluded Canevaro from the new cabinet he established that day.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DUUCp8YQc5kC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=felice+napoleone+canevaro&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=00aY0ghOzd&amp;sig=zzNPUpZ6p3LihTwtNRWGAHd-FX0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ2fygxLLYAhUE2mMKHaCSA9I4ChDoAQg3MAM#v=onepage&amp;q=de%20martino&amp;f=false |last=Smith |first=Shirley Ann |title=Imperial Designs: Italians in China, 1900–1947 |location=Madison, New Jersey |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson University Press |year=2012 |isbn=978-1-61147-502-9 |pages=8–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later naval service===

Canevaro returned to the navy, commanding the 3rd Maritime District from 16 July 1900 to 16 January 1902 and presiding over the [[Supreme Council of the Navy]] from 16 January 1902 until 6 July 1903. He then retired and was placed on the reserve list, although in retirement he was promoted to vice admiral of the navy on 1 December 1923. He died at [[Venice]] on 30 December 1926.&lt;ref name=treccani/&gt;

'''Saint Genevieve''' ({{lang-fr|link=no|Sainte Geneviève}}; {{lang-la|Sancta Genovefa, Genoveva}}; from [[Gaulish language|Gaullish]] ''geno'' "race, lineage" and ''uida'' "sage")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=qGBmAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Gaulish+personal+names&amp;dq=Gaulish+personal+names&amp;hl=fr&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQmeCA2dLWAhWLJ8AKHSh8Ac0Q6AEIKTAA|title=Gaulish personal names: a study of some Continental Celtic formations|last=Evans|first=D. Ellis|date=1967|publisher=Clarendon P.|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Nanterre]], {{circa}} 419/422 AD – Paris 502/512 AD), is the [[patron saint]] of Paris in the [[Roman Catholic]] and [[Eastern Orthodox]] traditions. Her feast day is kept on January the 3rd.

She was born in [[Nanterre]] and moved to Paris after encountering [[Germain of Auxerre|Germanus of Auxerre]] and [[Lupus of Troyes]] and dedicated herself to a Christian life.&lt;ref name=m18&gt;McNamara, Halborg, and Whatley 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 451 she led a "prayer marathon"&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Halborg, and Whatley 4.&lt;/ref&gt; that was said to have saved Paris by diverting [[Attila]]'s Huns away from the city. When the Germanic king [[Childeric I]] besieged the city in 464, she acted as an intermediary between the city and its besiegers, collecting food and convincing Childeric to release his prisoners.&lt;ref name=m18/&gt;

Her following and her status as patron saint of Paris were promoted by [[Clotilde]], who may have commissioned the writing of her ''[[Hagiography|vita]]''. This was most likely written in [[Tours]], where Clotilde retired after her husband's death, as evidenced also by the importance of [[Martin of Tours]] as a saintly model.&lt;ref name=m18/&gt;

==Life==
Though there is a ''[[hagiography|vita]]'' that purports to be written by a contemporary, Genevieve's history cannot be separated from her [[hagiography]]. She was described as a peasant girl born in Nanterre to Severus (a [[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]]) and Geroncia (Greek origins). On his way to Britain, [[Germanus of Auxerre]] stopped at Nanterre, and Genevieve confided to him that she wanted to live only for God. He encouraged her and at the age of fifteen, Genevieve became a nun. On the deaths of her parents, she went to live with her godmother Lutetia in Paris ("[[Lutetia]]" was the former name of the city of Paris, so this has symbolic weight.) There the young woman became admired for her piety and devotion to works of charity, and practiced [[mortification of the flesh|corporal austerities]] which included abstaining from meat and breaking her fast only twice in the week. "These mortifications she continued for over thirty years, till her ecclesiastical superiors thought it their duty to make her diminish her austerities."&lt;ref name=MacErlean&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06413f.htm MacErlean, Andrew. "St. Genevieve." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 19 Jul. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt; She encountered opposition and criticism for her activities, both before and after she was again visited by Germanus from those who were jealous or considered her an impostor or hypocrite. 

Geneviève had frequent visions of heavenly saints and angels. She reported her visions and prophecies, until her enemies conspired to drown her in a lake. Through the intervention of Germanus, their animosity was finally overcome. The [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Paris|Bishop of Paris]] appointed her to look after the welfare of the [[Consecrated virgin|virgins dedicated to God]], and by her instruction and example she led them to a high degree of sanctity.&lt;ref name=MacErlean/&gt;

Shortly before the attack of the Huns under [[Attila]] in 451 on Paris, Genevieve and Germanus' [[archdeacon]] persuaded the panic-stricken people of Paris not to flee but to pray. It is claimed that the intercession of Genevieve's prayers caused Attila's army to go to [[Orléans]] instead.&lt;ref name=calendar&gt;{{cite book|last=Bentley|first=James|title=A calendar of saints: the lives of the principal saints of the Christian Year|year=1993|publisher=Little, Brown|location=London|isbn=9780316908139|pages=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; During [[Childeric I|Childeric]]'s siege and blockade of Paris in 464, Geneviève passed through the siege lines in a boat to [[Troyes]], bringing grain to the city. She also pleaded to Childeric for the welfare of [[prisoner of war|prisoners-of-war]], and met with a favorable response. Through her influence, Childeric and Clovis displayed unwonted clemency towards the citizens.&lt;ref name=MacErlean/&gt;

Genevieve cherished a particular devotion to [[Denis|Saint Denis]], and wished to erect a [[Saint-Denys de la Chapelle|chapel]] in his honor to house his relics. Around 475 Genevieve purchased some land at the site of the saint's burial and exhorted the neighboring priests to use their utmost endeavors. When they replied that they had no lime, she sent them to the bridge of Paris, where they learned the whereabouts of large quantities of this material from the conversation of two swineherds.

==Death and burial==
[[Image:Front of the Ancient Church of the Abbey of Sainte Genevieve in Paris founded by Clovis and rebuilt from the Eleventh to Thirteenth Centuries State of the Building before its Destruction at the End of the Last Century.png|thumb|right|Front of the Church of the former [[Abbey of St Genevieve]]-(which she was said to have inspired)]]

[[Clovis I]] founded an abbey where Genevieve might minister, and where she herself was later buried.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Farmer|first=David Hugh|title=The Oxford dictionary of saints|year=1997|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=9780192800589|pages=200–201|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the care of the [[Benedictines]], who established a monastery there, the church witnessed numerous miracles wrought at her tomb. As Genevieve was popularly venerated there, the church was rededicated in her name; people eventually enriched the church with their gifts. it was plundered by the [[Vikings]] in 847 and was partially rebuilt, but was completed only in 1177.

In 1129, when the city was suffering from an epidemic of [[ergotism|ergot poisoning]], this "burning sickness" was stayed after Saint Genevieve's relics were carried in a public [[procession]]. This was repeated annually with the relics being brought to the cathedral; [[Marie de Rabutin-Chantal, marquise de Sévigné|Mme de Sévigné]] gave a description of the pageant in one of her letters. The relief from the epidemic is still commemorated in the churches of Paris.{{sfn|Attwater}}

[[File:Châsse shrine Ste Geneviève Saint Etienne du Mont.jpg|thumb|left|Tomb of Saint Genevieve in the church of [[Saint Etienne du Mont]]]]
After the old church fell into decay, [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]] ordered a new church worthy of the patron saint of Paris; he entrusted the [[Marquis of Marigny]] with the construction. The marquis gave the commission to his protégé [[Jacques-Germain Soufflot]], who planned a neo-classical design. After Soufflot's death, the church was completed by his pupil, [[Jean-Baptiste Rondelet]].

The [[French Revolution|Revolution]] broke out before the new church was dedicated. It was taken over in 1791 by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] and renamed the [[Panthéon]], to be a burial place for distinguished Frenchmen. It became an important monument in Paris.

Though Saint Genevieve's [[Relic#Christianity|relics]] had been publicly burnt at the [[Place de Grève]] in 1793 during the [[French Revolution]], the Panthéon was restored to Catholic purposes in 1821. In 1831 it was secularized again as a national mausoleum, but restored to the Catholic Church in 1852. Though the [[Paris Commune|Communards]] had dispersed the relics, in 1885 the Catholic Church reconsecrated the structure to St Geneviève. Today, the Panthéon serves both religious and secular functions.

==Canons of Saint Genevieve==
[[Image:Panthéon de Paris - 02.jpg|right|thumb|250px|The Panthéon, Paris]]
About 1619 [[Louis XIII of France|Louis XIII]] named [[François de La Rochefoucauld (Cardinal)|Cardinal François de La Rochefoucauld]] [[abbot]] of Saint Genevieve's. The [[Canons Regular|canons]] had been lax and the cardinal selected Charles Faure to reform them. This holy man was born in 1594, and entered the canons regular at [[Senlis, Oise|Senlis]]. He was remarkable for his piety, and, when ordained, succeeded after a hard struggle in reforming the abbey. Many of the houses of the canons regular adopted his reform. In 1634, he and a dozen companions took charge of Saint-Geneviève-du-Mont of Paris. This became the mother-house of a new congregation, the Canons Regular of Ste. Genevieve, which spread widely over France.

The institute named after the saint was the [[Daughters of Ste. Geneviève]], founded at Paris in 1636, by [[Francesca de Blosset]], with the object of nursing the sick and teaching young girls. A somewhat similar institute, popularly known as the [[Miramiones]], had been founded under the invocation of the Holy Trinity in 1611 by [[Marie de Miramion|Marie Bonneau de Rubella Beauharnais de Miramion]]. These two institutes were united in 1665, and the associates called the [[Canonesses of Ste. Geneviève]]. The members took no vows, but merely promised obedience to the rules as long as they remained in the institute. Suppressed during the Revolution, the institute was revived in 1806 by [[Jeanne-Claude Jacoulet]] under the name of the [[Sisters of the Holy Family (France)|Sisters of the Holy Family]].

[[File:UKUSA Washington.jpg|thumb|Photograph of British [[Cryptanalysis|cryptoanalysts]] Harry Hinsley, Sir [[Edward Travis]], and [[John Tiltman]]]]

'''Sir Francis Harry Hinsley''' [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] (26 November 1918 – 16 February 1998) was an English historian and [[cryptanalyst]]. He worked at [[Bletchley Park]] during the [[Second World War]] and wrote widely on the history of [[international relations]] and [[British Intelligence]] during the Second World War. He was known as Harry Hinsley.

==Early life==
Hinsley's father worked in the coal department of the Walsall [[Co-operatives UK|Co-Op]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/obituary-professor-sir-harry-hinsley-1145675.html|title=Obituary: Professor Sir Harry Hinsley|date=1998-02-19|work=The Independent|access-date=2018-04-09|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. His mother Emma Hinsley (née Adey) was a school caretaker, and they lived in [[Birchills]], in the parish of St Andrew's, Walsall. Harry was educated at [[Queen Mary's Grammar School]], [[Walsall]], and in 1937 won a scholarship to read history at [[St John's College, Cambridge|St. John's College]], [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]].&lt;ref name="odnb"&gt;Longhorn, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to be awarded a [[British undergraduate degree classification|First]] in part one of the Historical [[Tripos]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;. 

In August 1939 Hinsley visited his girlfriend in the German city of [[Koblenz]]. Police required him to report to the police station daily. However, this requirement was waived following the signing of the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact|German-Soviet Pact]]. A week later Hinsley was advised by police via his girlfriend's parents to get out of [[Germany]] by 'tomorrow at the latest'. This enabled him to cross the [[France–Germany border|Franco-German border]] before it was closed. He made the crossing at the bridge between [[Kehl]] and [[Strasbourg]]. Stripped of his [[Reichsmark|Reichsmarks]] by German border guards without [[French franc|French Francs]] or [[Pound sterling|British Pounds]] in exchange, Hinsley was left penniless. This led to his sleeping on a park bench in [[France]]. Hinsley [[Hitchhiking|hitch-hiked]] to [[Switzerland]] from where he returned to the [[United Kingdom]]. He made his return just before Britain declared war on Germany&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/990854648|title=ENIGMA : the battle for the code.|last=HUGH.|first=SEBAG-MONTEFIORE,|date=2017|publisher=WEIDENFELD &amp; NICOLSON|isbn=9781474608329|location=[S.l.]|oclc=990854648}}&lt;/ref&gt;. In October 1939, while still at St. John's, he was summoned to an interview with [[Alastair Denniston]], head of the [[Government Code and Cypher School]] (GC&amp;CS), and was thereby recruited to Bletchley Park's naval section in [[Hut 4]].&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, 1991, p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bletchley Park==
At Bletchley Park, Hinsley studied the external characteristics of intercepted German messages, a process sometimes termed "[[traffic analysis]]": from call signs, frequencies, times of interception and so forth, he was able to deduce a great deal of information about the structure of Nazi Germany's ''[[Kriegsmarine]]'''s communication networks, and even about the structure of the German navy itself.&lt;ref&gt;Kahn, 1991, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinsley helped initiate a programme of seizing [[Enigma machine]]s and keys from German [[weather ship]]s, such as the [[German weather ship Lauenburg|''Lauenburg'']], thereby facilitating [[Bletchley Park]]'s resumption of interrupted breaking of German Naval Enigma.

In late 1943, Hinsley was sent to liaise with the [[US Navy]] in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]], with the result that an agreement was reached in January 1944 to co-operate in exchanging results on [[Imperial Japanese Navy|Japanese Naval]] signals&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smith, "How the British Broke Japan's Codes", p. 148 in ''Action this Day'', edited by Ralph Erskine and Michael Smith, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the war, Hinsley, by then a key aide to Bletchley Park chief [[Edward Travis]], was part of a committee which argued for a post-war intelligence agency that would combine both signals intelligence and human intelligence in a single organisation. In the event, the opposite occurred, with GC&amp;CS becoming [[GCHQ]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Smith, prefatory remarks to Richard J. Aldrich, "Cold War Codebreaking and Beyond: The Legacy of Bletchley Park", p. 403 in ''Action this Day'', edited by Ralph Erskine and Michael Smith, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- On 7 April 1940, Hinsley --&gt;

On 6 April 1946, Hinsley married Hilary Brett-Smith, a graduate from [[Somerville College, Oxford]] who had also worked at Bletchley Park, in [[Hut 8]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; They moved to Cambridge after the war where Hinsley had been elected a [[Fellow]] at St. John's College&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;.

Hinsley was awarded the [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] in 1946, and was knighted in 1985.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

On his death, Sir Harry Hinsley was cremated, and his family buried the ashes privately in [[Cambridge]].

==Career as a historian==
After the war, Hinsley returned to St John's College and lectured in history, being in 1969 appointed ''Professor of the History of [[International Relations]]''.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; From 1979 to 1989 he was Master of St John's College and from 1981 to 1983 he was [[List of Vice-Chancellors of the University of Cambridge|vice-chancellor of the University of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.admin.cam.ac.uk/offices/v-c/vicechancellors.html|title=Vice-Chancellor's Office|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1962, Hinsley published ''Power and the Pursuit of Peace'', which is important as a study of early idealist thought about international relations.&lt;ref&gt;Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1962.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hinsley edited the multi-volume official history ''[[History of the Second World War#Intelligence|British Intelligence in the Second World War]]'', and argued that Enigma [[decryption]] had speeded Allied victory by 1–4 years while not fundamentally altering the war's outcome.

He was criticised by [[Marian Rejewski]]&lt;ref&gt;[[Marian Rejewski]], "Remarks on Appendix 1 to ''British Intelligence in the Second World War'' by F. H. Hinsley," translated by [[Christopher Kasparek]], ''[[Cryptologia]]'', vol. 6, no. 1 (January 1982), pp. 75–83.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Gordon Welchman]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Gordon Welchman]], "From Polish Bomba to British Bombe: the Birth of Ultra," ''Intelligence and National Security'', vol. 1, no. 1, 1986, pp. 71–110.&lt;/ref&gt; who took exception to inaccuracies in Hinsley's accounts of the history of Enigma decryption in the early volumes of his official history, including crucial errors in chronology. Subsequently, a revised account of the Polish, French and British contribution was included in volume 3, part 2.

The volumes of ''British Intelligence in the Second World War'' edited by Hinsley and published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office (HMSO) London are:

Hinsley also co-edited (with Alan Stripp) and contributed to ''Codebreakers: The Inside Story of Bletchley Park'', which contains personal accounts from those who worked at Bletchley Park.&lt;ref&gt;* {{Citation | editor-last = Hinsley | editor-first = F.H. | editor-link = Harry Hinsley | editor2-last = Stripp | editor2-first = Alan | year = 1993 | origyear = 1992 | title = Codebreakers: The inside story of Bletchley Park | publication-place = Oxford | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 978-0-19-280132-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hinsley Memorial Lecture, an annual lecture on an [[international relations]] topic, is held every year at St John's College in memory of Hinsley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joh.cam.ac.uk/annual-lectures|title=Distinguished Lecture Series - St John's College, Cambridge|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hulk''' is a fictional [[superhero]] appearing in publications by the [[American comic book|American publisher]] [[Marvel Comics]]. Created by writer [[Stan Lee]] and artist [[Jack Kirby]], the character first appeared in the debut issue of ''[[The Incredible Hulk (comic book)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' (May 1962). In his comic book appearances, the character is both the Hulk, a green-skinned, hulking and muscular humanoid possessing a vast degree of physical strength, and his alter ego '''Dr. Robert Bruce Banner''', a physically weak, socially withdrawn, and emotionally reserved physicist, the two existing as independent personalities and resenting of the other.

Following his accidental exposure to [[gamma ray]]s during the detonation of an experimental bomb, Banner is physically transformed into the Hulk when subjected to emotional stress, at or against his will, often leading to destructive rampages and conflicts that complicate Banner's civilian life. The Hulk's level of strength is normally conveyed as proportionate to his level of anger. Commonly portrayed as a raging savage, the Hulk has been represented with other personalities based on Banner's fractured psyche, from a mindless, destructive force, to a brilliant warrior, or genius scientist in his own right. Despite both Hulk and Banner's desire for solitude, the character has a large supporting cast, including Banner's lover [[Betty Ross]], his friend [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], his cousin [[She-Hulk]], sons [[Hiro-Kala]] and [[Skaar (comics)|Skaar]], and his co-founders of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]. However, his uncontrollable power has brought him into conflict with his fellow heroes and others.

Lee stated that the Hulk's creation was inspired by a combination of ''[[Frankenstein's monster|Frankenstein]]'' and ''[[Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde (character)|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]''.&lt;ref name="HulkTIG"&gt;{{Cite book| last=DeFalco | first=Tom | title=The Hulk: The Incredible Guide | publisher=[[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2003 | location=London, United Kingdom| page=200 | isbn=978-0-7894-9260-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Hulk's coloration has varied throughout the character's publication history, the most usual color is green. He has two main [[catchphrase]]s: "Hulk is strongest one there is!" and the better-known "Hulk smash!", which has founded the basis for numerous [[popular culture|pop culture]] [[Internet meme|meme]]s.

One of the most iconic characters in popular culture,&lt;ref name="HulkIconic"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HulkIconic2"/&gt; the character has appeared on a variety of merchandise, such as clothing and collectable items, inspired real-world structures (such as theme park attractions), and been referenced in a number of media. Banner and the Hulk have been adapted in live-action, animated, and video game incarnations. The most notable of these were the 1970s ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' television series, in which the character was portrayed by [[Bill Bixby]] and [[Lou Ferrigno]]. The character was first played in a live-action feature film by [[Eric Bana]], with [[Edward Norton]] and [[Mark Ruffalo]] portraying the character in the films of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]].

===Concept and creation===
The Hulk first appeared in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 ([[cover date]]d May 1962), written by writer-editor Stan Lee, [[penciller|penciled]] and co-plotted by Jack Kirby,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = DeFalco|first = Tom|authorlink = Tom DeFalco|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Marvel Chronicle A Year by Year History|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date= 2008|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 85|isbn =978-0756641238|quote= Based on their collaboration on ''The Fantastic Four'', [Stan] Lee worked with Jack Kirby.

Lee cites influence from ''[[Frankenstein]]''&lt;ref name="OyVey"/&gt; and ''[[Strange Case of Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde|Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde]]'' in the Hulk's creation:

{{quote|It was patently apparent that [the monstrous character the] [[Thing (comics)|Thing]] was the most popular character in [Marvel's recently created superhero team the] [[Fantastic Four]]. ... For a long time I'd been aware of the fact that people were more likely to favor someone who was less than perfect. ...

And then there's Frankenstein ... I've always had a soft spot in my heart for the Frankenstein monster. No one could ever convince me that he was the bad guy. ... He never wanted to hurt anyone; he merely groped his torturous way through a second life trying to defend himself, trying to come to terms with those who sought to destroy him. ... I decided I might as well borrow from Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde as well—our protagonist would constantly change from his normal identity to his superhuman alter ego and back again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | authorlink=Stan Lee | last=Lee | first = Stan | title = Origins of Marvel Comics| publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]/[[Marvel Fireside Books]]|date= 1974|location= New York, New York|page= 75|isbn= 0-671-21863-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Kirby, commenting upon his influences in drawing the character, recalled as inspiration the tale of a mother who rescues her child who is trapped beneath a car.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,999977,00.html |last=Hill |first=Dave |title=Green with anger |date=July 17, 2003 |location=London, United Kingdom |work=[[The Guardian]] |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WXHxoJ2k?url=http://film.guardian.co.uk/features/featurepages/0,,999977,00.html |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee has also compared Hulk to the [[Golem]] of Jewish mythology.&lt;ref name="OyVey"/&gt; In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Gresh and Weinberg see the Hulk as a reaction to the Cold War&lt;ref name=GreshWeinberg&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gresh|first=Lois|author2=Robert Weinberg|title=The Science of Superheroes|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=September 29, 2003| location= Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-46882-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- page=200 | page=27 Again, which is it?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and the threat of nuclear attack, an interpretation shared by Weinstein in ''[[Up, Up and Oy Vey]]''.&lt;ref name="OyVey"/&gt; This interpretation corresponds with other popularized fictional media created during this time period, which took advantage of the prevailing sense among Americans that nuclear power could produce monsters and mutants.&lt;ref name="Poole"&gt;Poole, W. Scott. ''Monsters in America: Our Historical Obsession with the Hideous and the Haunting.'' Waco, Texas: Baylor University Press, 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-60258-314-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the debut, Lee chose grey for the Hulk because he wanted a color that did not suggest any particular ethnic group.&lt;ref name="CBG"&gt;''[[Comics Buyer's Guide]]'' #1617 (June 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; Colorist [[Stan Goldberg]], however, had problems with the grey coloring, resulting in different shades of grey, and even green, in the issue. After seeing the first published issue, Lee chose to change the skin color to green.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Murray|first= Will|authorlink= Will Murray|title= The Historic Hulk|journal= [[Starlog]]|issue= 312|page= 73|date= July 2003|url= https://archive.org/stream/starlog_magazine-312JPG/312#page/n72/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt; Green was used in retellings of the origin, with even reprints of the original story being recolored for the next two decades, until ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2, #302 (December 1984) reintroduced the grey Hulk in flashbacks set close to the origin story. An exception is the early trade paperback, ''Origins of Marvel Comics'', from 1974, which explains the difficulties in keeping the grey color consistent in a Stan Lee written prologue, and reprints the origin story keeping the grey coloration.  Since December 1984, reprints of the first issue have displayed the original grey coloring, with the fictional canon specifying that the Hulk's skin had initially been grey.

Lee gave the Hulk's alter ego the alliterative name "Bruce Banner" because he found he had less difficulty remembering alliterative names. Despite this, in later stories he misremembered the character's name and referred to him as "'''Bob Banner'''", an error which readers quickly picked up on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = Boatz | first = Darrel L. | date = December 1988 | title = Stan Lee | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 64 | page = 15 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discrepancy was resolved by giving the character the official full name "'''Robert Bruce Banner'''."&lt;ref name=CBR/&gt;

===Series history===
The Hulk's original series was canceled with issue #6 (March 1963). Lee had written each story, with Kirby penciling the first five issues and [[Steve Ditko]] penciling and inking the sixth. The character immediately guest-starred in ''[[Fantastic Four|The Fantastic Four]]'' #12&lt;!-- "The" part of cover logo through issue #15 --&gt; (March 1963), and months later became a founding member of the superhero team the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], appearing in the first two issues of the team's eponymous series (Sept. and Nov. 1963), and returning as an antagonist in issue #3 and as an ally in #5 (Jan.–May 1964). He then guest-starred in ''Fantastic Four'' #25–26 (April–May 1964), which revealed Banner's full name as Robert Bruce Banner, and ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #14 (July 1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Manning|first = Matthew K.|last2= Gilbert|first2= Laura, ed.|chapter= 1960s|title = Spider-Man Chronicle Celebrating 50 Years of Web-Slinging|publisher = [[Dorling Kindersley]]|date = 2012|location= London, United Kingdom|page = 26|isbn = 978-0756692360|quote= Another important character entered Spider-Man's life in ''Amazing Spider-Man'' #14.

[[File:Hulk 1 cover.jpg|thumb|left|''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962). Cover art by [[Jack Kirby]] and [[Paul Reinman]].]]
Around this time, co-creator Kirby received a letter from a college dormitory stating the Hulk had been chosen as its official mascot.&lt;ref name="OyVey"/&gt; Kirby and Lee realized their character had found an audience in college-age readers.

A year and a half after ''The Incredible Hulk'' was canceled, the Hulk became one of two features in ''[[Tales to Astonish]]'', beginning in issue #60 (Oct. 1964).&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 102: "''Tales to Astonish'' #60 ... introduced a new series&amp;nbsp;– The Incredible Hulk&amp;nbsp;– starring the famous character."&lt;/ref&gt;

This new Hulk feature was initially scripted by Lee, with pencils by [[Steve Ditko]] and inks by [[George Roussos]]. Other artists later in this run included [[Jack Kirby]] (#68–87, June 1965&amp;nbsp;– Oct. 1966); [[Gil Kane]] (credited as "Scott Edwards", #76, (Feb. 1966)); [[Bill Everett]] (#78–84, April–Oct. 1966); [[John Buscema]] (#85–87); and [[Marie Severin]]. The ''Tales to Astonish'' run introduced the super-villains the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]],&lt;ref name="HulkTIG"/&gt; who would become the Hulk's nemesis, and the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]], another gamma-irradiated being.&lt;ref name="HulkTIG"/&gt; [[Marie Severin]] finished out the Hulk's run in ''Tales to Astonish''. Beginning with issue #102 (April 1968) the book was retitled ''The Incredible Hulk'' vol. 2,&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 128: "Hailing 1968 as the beginning of the 'Second Age of Marvel Comics,' and with more titles to play with, editor Stan Lee discarded his split books and gave more characters their own titles ... ''Tales to Astonish'' #101 [was followed] by ''The Incredible Hulk'' #102."&lt;/ref&gt; and ran until 1999, when Marvel canceled the series and launched ''Hulk'' #1. Marvel filed for a [[trademark]] for "The Incredible Hulk" in 1967, and the [[United States Patent and Trademark Office]] issued the registration in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://trademark.markify.com/trademarks/uspto/the+incredible+hulk/72277675|title= The Incredible Hulk|publisher= Markify|accessdate= January 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Len Wein]] wrote the series from 1974 through 1978, working first with [[Herb Trimpe]], then, as of issue #194 (December 1975), with [[Sal Buscema]], who was the regular artist for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Amash|first = Jim|title = Sal Buscema: Comics' Fast &amp; Furious Artist|publisher = [[TwoMorrows Publishing]]|date= 2010|location= Raleigh, North Carolina|page = 17|isbn = 978-1605490212}}&lt;/ref&gt; Issues #180–181 (Oct.–Nov. 1974) introduced [[Wolverine (character)|Wolverine]] as an antagonist,&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Sanderson|Sanderson, Peter]] "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 167: "Len Wein wrote and Herb Trimpe drew Wolverine's cameo appearance in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #180 and his premiere in issue #181."&lt;/ref&gt; who would go on to become one of Marvel Comics' most popular characters. In 1977, Marvel launched a second title, ''[[The Rampaging Hulk]]'', a black-and-white comics magazine.&lt;ref name="HulkTIG"/&gt; This was originally conceived as a flashback series, set between the end of his original, short-lived solo title and the beginning of his feature in ''Tales to Astonish''.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, "1970s", in Gilbert (2008), p. 178: "This black-and-white magazine starred the Hulk in adventures set in Europe shortly after his original six-issue series."&lt;/ref&gt; After nine issues, the magazine was retitled ''The Hulk!'' and printed in color.&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson, "1970s", in Gilbert (2008), p. 186: "To appeal to the audience of the popular new ''Incredible Hulk'' TV series, Marvel revamped ''The Rampaging Hulk'' magazine, calling it ''The Hulk!''."&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1977, two Hulk [[television film]]s were aired to strong ratings, leading to an [[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|''Incredible Hulk'' TV series]] which aired from 1978 to 1982. A huge ratings success, the series introduced the popular Hulk [[catchphrase]], "Don't make me angry. You wouldn't like me when I'm angry", and broadened the character's popularity from a niche comic book readership into the mainstream consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Greenberg|first= Glenn|authorlink= Glenn Greenberg |date= February 2014|title = The Televised Hulk|journal= [[Back Issue!]]|issue= 70|pages= 19–26|publisher= TwoMorrows Publishing|location= Raleigh, North Carolina}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bill Mantlo]] became the series' writer for five years beginning with issue #245 (March 1980). Mantlo's "Crossroads of Eternity" stories (#300–313, Oct. 1984&amp;nbsp;– Nov. 1985) explored the idea that Banner had suffered [[child abuse]]. Later Hulk writers [[Peter David]] and [[Greg Pak]] have called these stories an influence on their approaches to the character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last = O'Neill | first = Patrick Daniel | date = February 1992 | title = Peter David | work = [[Comics Interview]] | issue = 105 | page = 22 | publisher = [[Fictioneer Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Taylor | first=Robert | title=Greg Goes Wild on Planet Pak | work=[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]] | publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=August 3, 2006 | url = http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm | accessdate=November 15, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070402044123/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/001199809.cfm |archivedate = April 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mantlo left the series for ''[[Alpha Flight]]'' and that series' writer [[John Byrne (comics)|John Byrne]] took over ''The Incredible Hulk''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Serwin | first=Andy | title=The Wizard Retrospective: Mike Mignola | work= Wizard| publisher=Wizard Entertainment Group | date=July 23, 2007 | url=http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm | accessdate=November 13, 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080120105210/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/magazine/wizard/005255245.cfm |archivedate = January 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final issue of Byrne's six issue run featured the wedding of Bruce Banner and [[Betty Ross]].&lt;ref name="DeFalcos"&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 227: "Dr. Bruce Banner first met Betty Ross in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #1 (May 1962) and finally married her in issue #319 by John Byrne."&lt;/ref&gt; Writer Peter David began a twelve-year run with issue #331 (May 1987). He returned to the [[Roger Stern]] and Mantlo abuse storylines, expanding the damage caused, and depicting Banner as suffering [[dissociative identity disorder|dissociative identity disorder (DID)]].&lt;ref name="HulkTIG"/&gt;

In 1998, David killed off Banner's long-time love Betty Ross. Marvel executives used Ross' death as an opportunity to pursue the return of the Savage Hulk. David disagreed, leading to his parting ways with Marvel.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Radford | first=Bill | page=L4 | date=February 21, 1999|location= Colorado Springs, Colorado|work=[[The Gazette (Colorado Springs)|The Gazette]] | title=Marvel's not-so-jolly green giant gets a fresh start and a new team}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1998, Marvel relaunched ''The Rampaging Hulk'' as a standard comic book rather than as a comics magazine.&lt;ref name="HulkTIG"/&gt; ''The Incredible Hulk'' was again cancelled with issue #474 of its second volume in March 1999 and was replaced with new series, ''Hulk'' the following month, with returning writer Byrne and art by [[Ron Garney]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maelmill-insi.de/UHBMCC/hulk5.htm#S2499 The Unofficial Handbook of Marvel Comics Creators: ''Hulk'' (II) (1999–2000)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manning, Matthew K.

Writer [[Greg Pak]] took over the series in 2006, leading the Hulk through several crossover storylines including "[[Planet Hulk]]" and "[[World War Hulk]]", which left the Hulk temporarily incapacitated and replaced as the series' title character by the demigod [[Hercules (Marvel Comics)|Hercules]] in the retitled ''[[The Incredible Hercules]]'' (Feb. 2008).

==Fictional character biography==
During the experimental detonation of a gamma bomb, scientist Robert Bruce Banner saves teenager [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]] who has driven onto the testing field; Banner pushes Jones into a trench to save him, but is hit with the blast, absorbing massive amounts of gamma radiation. He awakens later seemingly unscathed, but that night transforms into a lumbering grey form. A pursuing soldier dubs the creature a "hulk".&lt;ref name="Hulk1"&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Stan Lee|Lee, Stan]]|penciller= [[Jack Kirby|Kirby, Jack]]|inker= [[Paul Reinman|Reinman, Paul]]|story= The Hulk|title= The Incredible Hulk|issue= 1|date= May 1962|page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, it was believed that Banner's transformations into the Hulk were caused by sunset and undone at sunrise, but later, after Rick witnessed Banner turn into Hulk at daytime following a failed attempt by Ross' men to shoot the Hulk into space, it was discovered to be caused by anger. Banner was cured in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #4, but chose to restore Hulk's powers with Banner's intelligence. The gamma-ray machine needed to affect the transformation-induced side effects that made Banner temporarily sick and weak when returned to his normal state.

In ''The [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]]'' #1 (September 1963), the Hulk became a founding member of the title's eponymous superhero team. By ''The Avengers'' #3, overuse of the gamma ray machine rendered the Hulk as an uncontrollable, rampaging monster, subject to spontaneous changing. In ''Tales to Astonish'' #59 (September 1964) the Hulk appeared as an antagonist for [[Henry Pym|Giant-Man]]. The series established stress as the trigger for Banner turning into the Hulk and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= [[Steve Ditko|Ditko, Steve]]|inker= [[George Roussos|Roussos, George]]|story= The Incredible Hulk|title= [[Tales to Astonish]]|issue= 60|date= October 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this time that the Hulk developed a more savage and childlike personality, shifting away from his original portrayal as a brutish but not entirely unintelligent figure. Also, his memory, both long-term and short-term, would now become markedly impaired in his Hulk state. ''Tales to Astonish'' #64 (February 1965) was the last Hulk story to feature him speaking in complete sentences. In ''Tales to Astonish'' #77 (March 1966), Banner's and the Hulk's dual identity became publicly known when Rick Jones, mistakenly convinced that Banner was dead (when he actually had been catapulted into the future), told Major [[Glenn Talbot]], a rival to Banner for the affections of Betsy Ross, the truth. Consequently, Glenn informed his superiors and that turned Banner into a wanted fugitive upon returning to the present.

The 1970s saw Banner and Betty nearly marry in ''The Incredible Hulk'' #124 (February 1970).&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 144: "Bruce [Banner] and Betty Ross decided to get married, Banner having erased his brute side and gained control over the changes. But on their wedding day, Banner's archenemy, the Leader, hit Bruce with radiation that turned him once more into a savage, uncontrollable Hulk."&lt;/ref&gt; Betty ultimately married Talbot in issue #158 (Dec. 1972).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[Roy Thomas|Thomas, Roy]]; [[Steve Gerber|Gerber, Steve]]|penciller= [[Herb Trimpe|Trimpe, Herb]]|inker= Trapani, Sal|story= Frenzy On a Far-Away World!|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 158|date= December 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hulk also traveled to other dimensions, one of which had him meet empress [[Jarella]], who used magic to bring Banner's intelligence to the Hulk, and came to love him. The Hulk helped to form the [[Defenders (comics)|Defenders]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanderson "1970s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 151: "[Roy] Thomas and artist Ross Andru reunited [Doctor] Strange, the Hulk, and Namor as a brand new Marvel superhero team&amp;nbsp;– the Defenders."&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, Banner once again gained control over the Hulk,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= [[Mignola, Mike]]|inker= [[Talaoc, Gerry]]|story= Weird Song of the Wen-Di-Go|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 272|date= June 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gained amnesty for his past rampages;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Mignola, Mike|inker= Talaoc, Gerry|story= Amnesty|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 2|date= October 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, due to the manipulations of supernatural character [[Nightmare (Marvel Comics)|Nightmare]], Banner eventually lost control over the Hulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Mignola, Mike|inker= Talaoc, Gerry|story= To Kill or Cure!|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 296|date=June 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also established that Banner had serious mental problems even before he became the Hulk, having suffered childhood traumas that engendered Bruce's repressed rage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Mantlo, Bill|penciller= Mignola, Mike|inker= Talaoc, Gerry|story= Monster|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 312|date= October 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banner comes to terms with his issues for a time, and the Hulk and Banner were physically separated by [[Doc Samson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Byrne, John|penciller= Byrne, John|inker= Byrne, John; Williams, Keith|story= Freedom!|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 315|date= January 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= [[David, Peter]]|penciller= Purves, Jeff|inker= Gustovich, Mike|story= Crap Shoot|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 347|date= September 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banner is recruited by the U.S. government to create the [[Hulkbusters]], a government team dedicated to catching the Hulk.

In issue #347 the grey Hulk persona "Joe Fixit" was introduced, a morally ambiguous [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] enforcer and tough guy. Banner remained repressed in the Hulk's mind for months, but slowly began to reappear.

The 1990s saw the Green Hulk return.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Dale Keown|Keown, Dale]]|inker= [[Bob McLeod (comics)|McLeod, Bob]]|story= He's Back|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 372|date= August 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In issue #377 (Jan. 1991), the Hulk was revamped in a storyline that saw the personalities of Banner, Grey Hulk, and Savage Hulk confront Banner's past abuse at the hands of his father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] and a new "Guilt Hulk" persona. Overcoming the trauma, the intelligent Banner, cunning Grey Hulk, and powerful Savage Hulk personalities merge into a new single entity possessing the traits of all three. The Hulk also joined the [[Pantheon (Marvel Comics)|Pantheon]], a secretive organization of superpowered individuals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= Keown, Dale|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= Moving On|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 382|date= June 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Manning "1990s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 253: "The Hulk first met Agamemnon, the leader of the Pantheon team, in a story written by Peter David with art by Dale Keown."&lt;/ref&gt; His tenure with the organization brought the Hulk into conflict with a tyrannical alternate future version of himself called the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]] in the 1993 ''Future Imperfect'' [[miniseries]], who rules over a world where many heroes are dead.

In 2000, Banner and the three Hulks (Savage Hulk, Grey Hulk, and the "Merged Hulk", now considered a separate personality and referred to as the Professor) become able to mentally interact with one another, each personality taking over the shared body as Banner began to weaken due to his suffering from [[ALS|Lou Gehrig's disease]]. During this, the four personalities (including Banner) confronted yet another submerged personality, a sadistic "Devil" intent on attacking the world and attempting to break out of Banner's fracturing psyche, but the Devil was eventually locked away again when the Leader was able to devise a cure for the disease using genes taken from the corpse of [[Brian Banner]].&lt;ref name="HV3:13" /&gt; In 2005, it is revealed that the Nightmare has manipulated the Hulk for years, and it is implied that some or all of the Hulk's adventures written by Bruce Jones may have been just an illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= David, Peter|penciller= [[Lee Weeks|Weeks, Lee]]|inker= [[Tom Palmer (comics)|Palmer, Tom]]|story= Tempest Fugit Conclusion|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 3|issue= 81|date= July 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, the [[Illuminati (comics)|Illuminati]] decide the Hulk is too dangerous to remain on Earth and send him away by rocket ship which crashes on Planet Sakaar ushering in the "[[Planet Hulk]]" storyline that saw the Hulk find allies in the [[Warbound]], and marry alien queen [[Caiera]], a relationship that was later revealed to have born him two sons: [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]].&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 3 #92-104.

During the 2011 ''[[Fear Itself (comics)|Fear Itself]]'' storyline, the Hulk finds one of the [[Serpent (comics)|Serpent]]'s magical hammers associated with the Worthy and becomes Nul: Breaker of Worlds. As he starts to transform, the Hulk tells the Red She-Hulk to run far away from him. Rampaging through [[South America|South]] and [[Central America]], Nul was eventually transported to New York City where he began battling [[Thor (Marvel Comics)|Thor]], with aid of the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]], who was transformed into Angrir: Breaker of Souls.

With the crisis concluded, the Hulk contacted [[Doctor Doom]] for help separating him and Banner for good in return for an unspecified favour. Doom proceeded to perform brain surgery on the Hulk, extracting the uniquely Banner elements from the Hulk's brain and cloning a new body for Banner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= [[Jason Aaron|Aaron, Jason]]|penciller= [[Whilce Portacio|Portacio, Whilce]]|inker= Martinez, Allen; Ketcham, Rick; Hanna, Scott|story= Hulk vs. Banner!

After the Hulk had suffered brain damage upon being shot in the head by the Order of the Shield- the assassin having been carefully trained to target Bruce at just the right part of the brain to incapacitate him without triggering a transformation- Iron Man used the [[Extremis]] to cure the Hulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= Waid, Mark|penciller= [[Mark Bagley|Bagley, Mark]]|inker= Hennessy, Andrew|story= Who Shot the Hulk #4|title= Hulk|volume= 3|issue= 4|date= August 2014|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt; This procedure also increased Banner's mental capacity, which gave him the intelligence to tweak the Extremis virus within him and unleash a new persona for the Hulk: the super-intelligent Doc Green.

Later when he sided with Edwin Jarvis and tried to prevent his teammates from executing the Red Skull, the Hulk was thrown aside by Luke Cage. The Hulk's sorrow at his friends' betrayal awakened a new persona known as the bloodthirsty Kluh (described as the Hulk's Hulk, being the ruthless part of himself that even the Hulk repressed) with this new version easily defeating the Avengers, sneering that the Hulk they knew was nothing more than a "sad piece of 'Doc Green's' ID."

At the close of the storyline, Doc Green discovered that he was beginning to disappear as the result of the Extremis serum wearing off.

A number of [[parallel universe (fiction)|alternate universe]]s and alternate timelines in Marvel Comics publications allow writers to introduce variations on the Hulk, in which the character's origins, behavior, and morality differ from the mainstream setting.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} In some stories, someone other than Bruce Banner is the Hulk.

In some versions, the Hulk succumbs to the darker side of his nature: in "Future Imperfect" (December 1992), a future version of the Hulk has become the [[Maestro (comics)|Maestro]], the tyrannical and ruthless ruler of a nuclear war-irradiated Earth,&lt;ref name="AltMaestro"/&gt; and in "[[Old Man Logan]]" (2008), an insane Hulk rules over a post-apocalyptic California, and leads a gang of his inbred Hulk children created with his first cousin She-Hulk.&lt;ref name="AltOML"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AltOML2"/&gt;

== Characterization ==
[[File:The Avengers - Hulk (cropped).jpg|thumb|Statue of the '' Hulk '']]
Like other long-lived characters, the Hulk's character and cultural interpretations have changed with time, adding or modifying character traits. The Hulk is typically seen as a hulking man with green skin, wearing only a pair of torn purple pants that survive his physical transformation. As the character progressed, other outfits were designed that could stretch to accommodate the transformations back and forth.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}} As Bruce Banner, the character is approximately 5'9" tall  and weighs 128Ibs, but when transformed into the Hulk, the character can stand between 7–8 feet tall and weigh up to 1,400Ibs.&lt;ref name="BioMarvel"/&gt; Following his debut, Banner's transformations were triggered at nightfall, turning him into a grey-skinned Hulk. In ''Incredible Hulk'' #2, the Hulk started to appear with green skin,&lt;ref name="NewsAramaPg2"/&gt; and in ''Avengers'' #3 (1963) Banner realized that his transformations were now triggered by surges of adrenaline in response to feelings of fear, pain or anger.&lt;ref name="NewsAramaPg3"/&gt; ''Incredible Hulk'' #227 (1978) established that the Hulk's separate personality was not due to the mutation affecting his brain, but because Banner was suffering from [[Dissociative identity disorder|multiple personality disorder]], with the savage Green Hulk representing Banner's repressed childhood rage and aggression,&lt;ref name="NewsAramaPg5"/&gt; and the Grey Hulk representing Banner's repressed selfish desires and urges.&lt;ref name="NewsAramaPg9"/&gt;

===Personality===
;Bruce Banner
During his decades of publication, Banner has been portrayed differently, but common themes persist. Banner, a [[physicist]], is sarcastic and seemingly very self-assured when he first appears in ''Incredible Hulk'' #1, but is also emotionally withdrawn in most fashions.&lt;ref name="HulkTIG"/&gt; Banner designed the gamma bomb which caused his affliction, and the ironic twist of his self-inflicted fate has been one of the most persistent common themes.&lt;ref name="OyVey"&gt;{{Cite book|last= Weinstein|first= Simcha|title= Up, Up, and Oy Vey!|publisher= Leviathan Press| date= 2006|location= Baltimore, Maryland|pages= 82–97|isbn=978-1-881927-32-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arie Kaplan describes the character thus: "Robert Bruce Banner lives in a constant state of panic, always wary that the monster inside him will erupt, and therefore he can't form meaningful bonds with anyone."&lt;ref name=Kaplan&gt;{{Cite book|last= Kaplan|first= Arie|title= Masters of the Comic Book Universe Revealed!|publisher= [[Chicago Review Press]]|date= 2006|page= 58|location= Chicago, Illinois|isbn=978-1556526336}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a child, Banner's father [[Brian Banner|Brian]] often got mad and physically abused both Banner and his mother, creating the [[complex (psychology)|psychological complex]] of fear, anger, and the fear of anger and the destruction it can cause that underlies the character. Banner has been shown to be emotionally repressed, but capable of deep love for Betty Ross, and for solving problems posed to him. Under the writing of Paul Jenkins, Banner was shown to be a capable fugitive, applying deductive reasoning and observation to figure out the events transpiring around him. On the occasions that Banner has controlled the Hulk's body, he has applied principles of physics to problems and challenges and used deductive reasoning. It was shown after his ability to turn into the Hulk was taken away by the Red Hulk that Banner has been extremely versatile as well as cunning when dealing with the many situations that followed. When he was briefly separated from the Hulk by Doom, Banner became criminally insane, driven by his desire to regain the power of the Hulk, but once the two recombined he came to accept that he was a better person with the Hulk to provide something for him to focus on controlling rather than allowing his intellect to run without restraint against the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Aaron, Jason|penciller= Palo, Jefte|inker= Palo, Jefte|story= Hulk: United Part 1|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 4|issue= 13|date= November 2012|publisher=Marvel Comics}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Hulk
The original Grey Hulk was shown as average in intelligence who roamed aimlessly and became annoyed at "puny" humans who took him for a dangerous monster. Shortly after becoming the Hulk, his transformation continued turning him green, coinciding with him beginning to display primitive speech,&lt;ref name="NewsAramaPg2"/&gt; and by ''Incredible Hulk'' #4, radiation treatments gave Banner's mind complete control of the Hulk's body. While Banner relished his indestructibility and power, he was quick to anger and more aggressive in his Hulk form and while he became known as a hero alongside the Avengers, his increasing paranoia caused him to leave the group, believing he would never be trusted.&lt;ref name="NewsAramaPg3"/&gt;

Originally, the Hulk was shown as simple minded and quick to anger.&lt;ref name=Hulk4&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Lee, Stan|penciller= Kirby, Jack|inker= [[Dick Ayers|Ayers, Dick]]|story= The Monster and the Machine!|title= The Incredible Hulk|issue= 4|date= November 1962}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Hulk generally divorces his identity from Banner's, decrying Banner as "puny Banner."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= Milgrom, Al|penciller= Milgrom, Al|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The Monster's Analyst|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 221|date= September 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his earliest stories, the Hulk has been concerned with finding sanctuary and quiet&lt;ref name="OyVey"/&gt; and often is shown reacting emotionally to situations quickly. Grest and Weinberg call Hulk the "dark, primordial side of Banner's psyche."&lt;ref name=GreshWeinberg&gt;{{Cite book|last=Gresh|first=Lois|author2=Robert Weinberg|title=The Science of Superheroes|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|date=September 29, 2003| location= Hoboken, New Jersey|isbn=978-0-471-46882-0}}{{Page needed|date=September 2010}}&lt;!-- page=200 | page=27 Again, which is it?? --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Even in the earliest appearances, Hulk spoke in the third person. Hulk retains a modest intelligence, thinking and talking in full sentences, and Lee even gives the Hulk expository dialogue in issue six, allowing readers to learn just what capabilities Hulk has, when the Hulk says, "But these muscles ain't just for show! All I gotta do is spring up and just keep goin'!" In the 1970s, Hulk was shown as more prone to anger and rage, and less talkative. Writers played with the nature of his transformations,&lt;ref name="Nation"&gt;{{Cite book| title=Comic Book Nation | last=Wright | first=Bradford | date=March 22, 2001 | publisher=[[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | location= Baltimore, Maryland| isbn=978-0-8018-6514-5 | page=336}}&lt;/ref&gt; briefly giving Banner control over the change, and the ability to maintain control of his Hulk form. Artistically and conceptually, the character has become progressively more muscular and powerful in the years since his debut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/may/17/medicalresearch.medicineandhealth |last=Randerson |first=James |title=Superman copycats 'risk health' |work=The Guardian |date=May 17, 2006 |location=London, United Kingdom |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WXIXicrd?url=http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/2006/may/17/medicalresearch.medicineandhealth |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, Stan Lee wanted the Hulk to be grey but due to ink problems, Hulk's color was changed to green. This was later changed in story to indicate that the {{anchor|Grey Hulk}}'''Grey Hulk''' and the Savage Hulk are separate personalities or entities fighting for control in Bruce's subconscious. The Grey Hulk incarnation can do the more unscrupulous things that Robert Bruce Banner could not bring himself to do, with many sources comparing the Grey Hulk to the moody teenager that Banner never allowed himself to be. While the Grey Hulk still had the "madder he gets, the stronger he gets" part that is similar to the Savage Hulk, it is on a much slower rate. It is said by Leader that the Grey Hulk is stronger on nights of the New Moon and weaker on nights of the Full Moon. Originally, the night is when Bruce Banner becomes the Grey Hulk and changes back by dawn. In later comics, willpower or stress would have Robert Bruce Banner turn into the Grey Hulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= Milgrom, Al|penciller= Milgrom, Al|inker= Janke, Dennis|story= The More Things Change ...|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 324|date= October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; During one storyline where he was placed under a spell to prevent him turning back into Bruce Banner and publicly presumed dead when he was teleported away from a gamma bomb explosion that destroyed an entire town, the Grey Hulk adopted a specific name as {{anchor|Joe Fixit}}'''Joe Fixit''', a security guard for a Las Vegas casino owner, with the Grey Hulk often being referred to as Joe after these events.{{issue|date=April 2018}}

The {{anchor|Gravage Hulk}}'''Gravage Hulk''' is the result of Robert Bruce Banner using the Gamma Projector on himself which merged his Savage Hulk and Grey Hulk personas. This form possesses the raw power of the Savage Hulk and the cunning intellect of the Grey Hulk. While he doesn't draw on anger to empower him, the Gravage Hulk persona draws on dimensional nexus energies to increase his level.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 2 #60. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{anchor|Dark Hulk}}'''Dark Hulk''' persona is the result of Hulk being possessed by Shanzar. This form has black skin and is viciously strong.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' #271. Marvel Comics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Convinced that unaided, the Banner, Green Hulk and Grey Hulk identities would eventually destroy each other, Doc Samson uses hypnosis to merge the three to create a new single identity combining Banner's intelligence with the Grey Hulk's and Banner's attitudes, and the Green Hulk's body. This new or {{anchor|Merged Hulk}}'''Merged Hulk''' considered himself cured and began a new life, but the merger was not perfect, and the Hulk sometimes still considered Banner a separate person, and when overcome with rage, the Merged Hulk would transform back into Banner's human body while still thinking himself the Hulk.&lt;ref name="NewsAramaPg9"/&gt; The Merged Hulk is the largest of the three primary Hulk incarnations and has a higher base line. While in a calm emotional state, the Merged Hulk is stronger than Savage Hulk when he is calm. Unlike the Savage Hulk and the Grey Hulk, Robert Bruce Banner subconsciously installed a type of safeguard within this incarnation. The safeguard is that when the Merged Hulk gets angry, he regresses back to Robert Bruce Banner with the mind of the Savage Hulk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic|writer= David, Peter|penciller= Keown, Dale|inker= Farmer, Mark|story= Hit and Myth|title= The Incredible Hulk|volume= 2|issue= 379|date= March 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{anchor|Green Scar}}'''Green Scar''' persona is unleashed on Sakaar and is considered an enraged version of Gravage Hulk. In addition, he is an expert in armed combat like the use of swords and shields. Green Scar is also a capable leader and an expert strategist.&lt;ref&gt;''Incredible Hulk'' Vol. 1 #93&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Kluh}}'''Kluh''' is described as the Hulk's Hulk. This form has black skin, red lines, and a mohawk. Kluh had incredible power where he bested the inverted Avengers and knocked around Nova and has normal intellect.&lt;ref name="Avengers &amp; X-Men: AXIS"/&gt;

{{anchor|Doc Green}}'''Doc Green''' is a variation of the Merged Hulk persona that is the result of Extremis fixing Hulk's brain. This persona is powerful enough to destroy Tony Stark's mansion with one thunderclap.&lt;ref name="Hulk #5"/&gt;

'''Immortal Hulk''' is the result of Bruce Banner and Hulk having been through different deaths and rebirths. This incarnation is articulate, smart, cunning, and does merciless attacks on those who do harm. Unlike the other Hulk incarnations, Immortal Hulk is content with waiting inside Bruce. If Bruce is injured by sunset, the Immortal Hulk will emerge with his transformation being limited to night-time.&lt;ref name="Immortal Hulk"/&gt;

===Powers and abilities===
Banner is considered one of the greatest scientific minds on Earth, possessing "a mind so brilliant it cannot be measured on any known intelligence test."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Pisani | first=Joseph | title=The Smartest Superheroes | work=BusinessWeek | url= http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-05-31/the-smartest-superheroes-businessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140115135337/http://www.businessweek.com/stories/2006-05-31/the-smartest-superheroes-businessweek-business-news-stock-market-and-financial-advice|archivedate= January 15, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=December 9, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Norman Osborn]] estimates that he is the fourth most-intelligent person on Earth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite comic| writer= Pak, Greg|penciller= Oliver, Ben |inker= Oliver, Ben|colorist=Gandini, Veronica | letterer=Bowland, Simon | editor=Paniccia, Mark | story= The List: Hulk |title= Dark Reign: The List – Hulk|volume= 1|issue= 1|date= December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Banner holds expertise in biology, chemistry, engineering, medicine, physiology, and nuclear physics.

In the first ''Hulk'' comic series, "massive" doses of gamma rays would cause the Hulk to transform back to Banner, although this ability was written out of the character by the 1970s.{{citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Over the long publication history of the Hulk's adventures, many recurring characters have featured prominently, including his best friend and sidekick [[Rick Jones (comics)|Rick Jones]], love interest and wife [[Betty Ross]] and her father, the often adversarial [[Thunderbolt Ross|General "Thunderbolt" Ross]]. Both Banner and Hulk have families created in their respective personas. Banner is son to Brian, an abusive father who killed Banner's mother while she tried to protect her son from his father's delusional attacks, and cousin to [[She-Hulk|Jennifer Walters]], the [[She-Hulk]], who serves as his frequent ally.&lt;ref name="DeFalco197"&gt;DeFalco "1980s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 197: "Stan Lee decided to introduce a female version of the Hulk ... With the help of artist John Buscema, Lee created Jennifer Walters, the cousin of Bruce Banner."&lt;/ref&gt; Banner had a stillborn child with Betty, while the Hulk has two sons with his deceased second wife [[Caiera]] Oldstrong, [[Skaar (character)|Skaar]] and [[Hiro-Kala]], and his DNA was used to create a daughter named [[She-Hulk (Lyra)|Lyra]] with [[Thundra]] the warrior woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=David |last=Pepose |url=http://www.newsarama.com/comics/Hulks-Dark-Son-100611.html |title=Dark Son Rising As The Other Son Of Hulk Hits Earth |publisher=[[Newsarama]]|date=June 11, 2010|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20141208023445/http://www.newsarama.com/5432-dark-son-rising-as-the-other-son-of-hulk-hits-earth.html|archivedate=December 8, 2014 |deadurl= no|accessdate=June 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Fantastic Four'' #12&lt;!-- "The" part of cover logo through issue #15 --&gt; (March 1963), featured the Hulk's first battle with the [[Thing (comics)|Thing]]. Although many early Hulk stories involve Ross trying to capture or destroy the Hulk, the main villain is often a radiation-based character, like the [[Gargoyle (comics)#Gargoyle (Yuri Topolov)|Gargoyle]] or the Leader, along with other foes such as the [[Toad Men]], or Asian warlord General Fang. Ross' daughter Betty loves Banner and criticizes her father for pursuing the Hulk. General Ross' right-hand man, [[Glenn Talbot|Major Glenn Talbot]], also loves Betty and is torn between pursuing Hulk and trying to gain Betty's love more honorably. Rick Jones serves as the Hulk's friend and sidekick in these early tales. The Hulk's archenemies are the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Leader (comics)|Leader]]. The Abomination is more monstrous and wreaks havoc for fun and pleasure. The Leader is a super-genius who has tried plan after plan to take over the world.

==Cultural impact==
{{see also|Hulk in other media}}

The Hulk character and the concepts behind it have been raised to the level of [[Cultural icon|iconic]] status by many within and outside the comic book industry. In 2003, ''[[Official U.S. PlayStation Magazine]]'' claimed the character had "stood the test of time as a genuine icon of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-23626618_ITM |title=Smash! |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WXAG9bFn?url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-23626618_ITM |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, the Hulk was listed as the 19th greatest comic book character by ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05230810thgreatestcharacters.html|title= The 200 Greatest Comic Book Characters of All Time|date= May 23, 2008|work= Wizard|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080526115937/http://www.wizarduniverse.com/05230810thgreatestcharacters.html|archivedate= May 26, 2008|deadurl= yes|quote= The one constant for this 'atomic Jekyll-and-Hyde,' as they used to say, remains Bruce Banner's eternal struggle to control the gamma-spawned half of his psyche.

===Analysis===
The Hulk is often viewed as a reaction to war. As well as being a reaction to the [[Cold War]], the character has been a cipher for the frustrations the [[Vietnam War]] raised, and Ang Lee said that the [[Iraq War]] influenced his direction.&lt;ref name=GreshWeinberg/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| title=Becoming the Hulk | journal=[[The New Yorker]] | date=June 30, 2003 | last=Lahr | first=John | page=72 | url = http://archives.newyorker.com/?iid=15295&amp;startpage=page0000080}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=The Clash of Symbols | newspaper=[[Sunday Herald]]|location=Glasgow, United Kingdom| date=December 23, 2007 | last=Phelan | first=Stephen | page=42}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Michael Nyman]] edited edition of ''[[The Guardian]]'', Stefanie Diekmann explored Marvel Comics' reaction to the [[September 11 attacks]]. Diekmann discussed The Hulk's appearance in the 9/11 tribute comic ''Heroes'', claiming that his greater prominence, alongside [[Captain America]], aided in "stressing the connection between anger and justified violence without having to depict anything more than a well-known and well-respected protagonist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Diekmann |first=Stefanie |url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/guesteditors/story/0,14481,1201733,00.html |title=Hero and superhero |date=April 24, 2004 |location=London, United Kingdom |newspaper=The Guardian |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WX1zzKKs?url=http://arts.guardian.co.uk/guesteditors/story/0,14481,1201733,00.html |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics'', [[Les Daniels]] addresses the Hulk as an embodiment of cultural fears of radiation and nuclear science. He quotes Jack Kirby thus: "As long as we're experimenting with radioactivity, there's no telling what may happen, or how much our advancements in science may cost us." Daniels continues, "The Hulk became Marvel's most disturbing embodiment of the perils inherent in the [[Atomic Age|atomic age]]."&lt;ref name=DanielsMarvel&gt;{{Cite book|last=Daniels|first=Les|authorlink = Les Daniels|title= Marvel: Five Fabulous Decades of the World's Greatest Comics |publisher= [[Abrams Books|Harry N. Abrams]]|date= 1991|location= New York, New York|page= 89|isbn= 9780810938212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Comic Book Nation'', Bradford Wright alludes to Hulk's counterculture status, referring to a 1965 ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' magazine poll amongst college students which "revealed that student radicals ranked [[Spider-Man]] and the Hulk alongside the likes of [[Bob Dylan]] and [[Che Guevara]] as their favorite revolutionary icons." Wright goes on to cite examples of his anti-authority symbol status. Two of these are "The Ballad of the Hulk" by [[Jerry Jeff Walker]], and the ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' cover for September 30, 1971, a full color [[Herb Trimpe]] piece commissioned for the magazine.&lt;ref name="Nation"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Goldberg |first=Jonah |url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMyYTQ4NTc5ZTU1Y2U0ZDc4ZjhmZmIwMmRhZjNjNDg= |title=Spin City |date=May 7, 2002 |work=National Review Online |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WX9jU6iE?url=http://article.nationalreview.com/?q=MDMyYTQ4NTc5ZTU1Y2U0ZDc4ZjhmZmIwMmRhZjNjNDg= |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hulk has been caricatured in such [[List of animated television series|animated television series]] as ''[[The Simpsons]]'',&lt;ref name=IAmFuriousYellow&gt;{{Cite episode |series= [[The Simpsons]]|title=[[I Am Furious Yellow]] |airdate= April 28, 2002|season=13|number= 18|credits = [[John Swartzwelder|Swartzwelder, John]] (writer); [[Chuck Sheetz|Sheetz, Chuck]] (director)|network = [[Fox Broadcasting Company]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Robot Chicken]]'', and ''[[Family Guy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode | title= [[Chitty Chitty Death Bang]]|series= [[Family Guy]]|credits= [[Danny Smith (writer)|Smith, Danny]] (writer); [[Dominic Polcino|Polcino, Dominic]] (director)|network= Fox Broadcasting Company|airdate= April 18, 1999|season= 1|number=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and such [[comedy]] [[television program|TV series]] as ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite episode |series=[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]|credits= [[Ben Elton|Elton, Ben]], [[Rik Mayall|Mayall, Rik]], and [[Lise Mayer|Mayer, Lise]] (writers); Posner, Geoff (director)|title= [[Summer Holiday (The Young Ones episode)|Summer Holiday]]|seriesno= 2|number= 6| airdate= June 19, 1984}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character is also used as a cultural reference point for someone displaying anger or agitation. For example, in a 2008 ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' review of an ''[[EastEnders]]'' episode, a character is described as going "into Incredible Hulk mode, smashing up his flat."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title=We love telly: We love soaps | newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] | location=London, United Kingdom | date=February 5, 2008 | last=Quigley | first=Maeve | page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hulk, especially his alter-ego Bruce Banner, is also a common reference in rap music. The term was represented as an analogue to marijuana in [[Dr. Dre]]'s ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.songmeanings.net/songs/view/14877/= Some L.A. Niggaz]" from ''[[2001 (Dr. Dre album)|2001]]''. [[Dr. Dre]]. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; while more conventional references are made in [[Ludacris]] and [[Jermaine Dupri]]'s popular single "[[Welcome to Atlanta]]".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.metrolyrics.com/welcome-to-atlanta-lyrics-jermaine-dupri.html= Welcome to Atlanta]" from ''[[Instructions (album)|Instructions]]'' and ''[[Word of Mouf]]''. [[Jermaine Dupri]] and [[Ludacris]]. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2003 [[Ang Lee]]-directed ''[[Hulk (film)|Hulk]]'' film saw discussion of the character's appeal to [[Asian American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Marchetti |first=Gina |url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/68 |title=Hollywood Taiwan |journal=Film International |volume=2 |issue=6 |date=November 2004 |pages=42–51 |issn=1651-6826 |doi=10.1386/fiin.2.6.42 |accessdate=March 23, 2008 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5WXGSuwQb?url=http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node%2F68 |archivedate=March 23, 2008 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Taiwanese-born Ang Lee commented on the "subcurrent of repression" that underscored the character of The Hulk, and how that mirrored his own experience: "Growing up, my artistic leanings were always repressed—there was always pressure to do something 'useful,' like being a doctor." Jeff Yang, writing for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', extended this self-identification to Asian American culture, arguing that "the passive-aggressive streak runs deep among Asian Americans—especially those who have entered creative careers, often against their parents' wishes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yang |first=Jeff |url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/gate/archive/2006/06/01/apop.DTL |title=Look ...

There have been explorations about the real world possibility of Hulk's gamma-radiation based origin. In ''The Science of Superheroes'', Lois Grest and Robert Weinberg examined Hulk's powers, explaining the scientific flaws in them. Most notably, they point out that the level of [[gamma radiation]] Banner is exposed to at the initial blast would induce radiation sickness and kill him, or if not, create significant cancer risks for Banner, because hard radiation strips cells of their ability to function. They go on to offer up an alternate origin, in which a Hulk might be created by biological experimentation with [[adrenal gland]]s and [[green fluorescent protein|GFP]]. Charles Q. Choi from LiveScience.com further explains that unlike the Hulk, gamma rays are not green; existing as they do beyond the visible spectrum, gamma rays have no color at all that we can describe. He also explains that gamma rays are so powerful (the most powerful form of electromagnetic radiation and 10,000 times more powerful than visible light) that they can even convert energy into matter&amp;nbsp;– a possible explanation for the increased mass that Bruce Banner takes on during transformations. "Just as the Incredible Hulk 'is the strongest one there is,' as he says himself, so too are gamma ray bursts the most powerful explosions known."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=Choi | first=Charles Q. | title=Gamma Rays: The Incredible, Hulking Reality | publisher=LiveScience | date=June 11, 2008 | url=http://www.livescience.com/strangenews/080611-incredible-hulk.html|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140409043518/http://www.livescience.com/2590-gamma-rays-incredible-hulking-reality.html|archivedate= April 9, 2014|deadurl= no|accessdate=June 12, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Marvel characters by the same name==
Prior to the debut of the Hulk in May 1962, Marvel had earlier monster characters that used the name "Hulk", but had no direct relation.

* Debuting in ''[[Strange Tales]]'' #75 (June 1960), was a huge robot built by Albert Poole called the Hulk, which was actually armor that Poole would wear. In modern-day reprints, the character's name was changed to ''Grutan''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/poolealbertst.htm|title= The Hulk (Albert Poole)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= September 11, 2010 |publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171213/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix4/poolealbertst.htm|archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First appearing in ''[[Journey Into Mystery]]'' #62 (Nov. 1960) was ''[[Xemnu|Xemnu the Living Hulk]]'', a huge, furry alien monster.&lt;ref&gt;DeFalco "1960s" in Gilbert (2008), p. 79: "The lead story of [''Journey into Mystery''] issue #62, 'I Was a Slave of the Living Hulk', introduced a giant monster called the Hulk&amp;nbsp;– similar in name only to the future Hulk."&lt;/ref&gt; Coincidentally, the character's debut story was also illustrated by Jack Kirby. The character reappeared in issue #66 (March 1961). Since then the character has been a mainstay in the Marvel Universe, and was renamed [[Xemnu]] the Titan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/xemnuthetitan.htm|title= Xemnu the Titan|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= March 15, 2012|publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171435/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/xemnuthetitan.htm|archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A huge, orange, slimy monster was featured in a movie called ''The Hulk'' in ''Tales to Astonish'' #21 (July 1961). In modern-day reprints, the character's name was changed to the ''Glop''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/hulkgloptta.htm|title= Hulk (Glop)|first= Jeff|last= Christiansen|date= February 8, 2006|publisher= The Appendix to the Handbook of the Marvel Universe|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121120171154/http://www.marvunapp.com/Appendix3/hulkgloptta.htm|archivedate=November 20, 2012 |deadurl= no|accessdate= February 12, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- WHAT "PEACE MISSION"?  CLARIFY --&gt;

==Other academic and creative works==
Hussain Ali Yousafi wrote and directed many [[Hazaragi]]-language dramas (writing 25 plays),&lt;ref&gt;http://tnnhazara.org/pay_may06.pdf Hussain Ali Yousafi's interview on ''paygham e tanzeem'' May 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and acted in them as well.

==Assassination==
Hussain Ali Yousafi was shot by unknown in Quetta on 26 January 2009.

===Reactions to his assassination===
Various political leaders from [[Pakistan]], ''such as [[Asif Ali Zardari]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66056&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-10-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219231505/http://www.app.com.pk/en_/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=66056&amp;Itemid=2 |archivedate=2012-02-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and abroad condemned this political assassination.  In reaction, [[Hazara people|Hazaras]] and others took part in protests and rallies in different countries. Demonstrations and protests were recorded in [[Pakistan]] and [[Afghanistan]], as well as [[Canada]], [[Australia]], [[Europe]], and the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/urdu/pakistan/story/2009/02/090204_hazara_bal_us_rh.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hazara Democratic Party]] organized an All Parties Conference (APC) on 8 February 2009 in Quetta, focused on the restoration of peace and condemnation of Yousafi's killing.  The meeting was attended by a wide variety of Pakistani political parties, to include the [[National Party (Pakistan)]], [[Balochistan National Party (Mengal)|Balochistan National Party]]{{dn|date=September 2018}}, and  [[Pakistan Muslim League]].

The Hazara Democratic Party announced in a press conference at [[Quetta Press Club]] (1 February 2009), &lt;blockquote&gt;
The Party's supreme council has decided on a title for HDP Chairman Hussain Ali Yousafi: ''Shaheed Chairman'' (Martyr Chairman) for his historic political and social services.

== Professional wrestling career ==

=== Early career (1968 – 1981) ===
Snuka opted to go into the more lucrative career of professional wrestling due to the uncertainty of his making a living in bodybuilding.&lt;ref&gt;World Wrestling Federation (Producer), Snuka, J. (Writer), &amp; Graham, D. (Director). (1982). Spectrum wrestling [Motion picture]. USA: World Wrestling Federation.&lt;/ref&gt; While working at [[Dean Higuchi#Dean.27s Gym|Dean Ho's gym]] in Hawaii, Snuka met many of the wrestlers who worked in the South Pacific region and decided to try the business.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt; Snuka made his debut as Jimmy Kealoha fighting Maxwell "Bunny" Butler in [[Hawaii]] in 1970. He later moved to the mainland and wrestled for [[Don Owen (wrestling promoter)|Don Owen]]’s [[Pacific Northwest Wrestling|NWA Pacific Northwest]] territory where he held the belt as Heavyweight Champion six times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|publisher=Simon and Schuster| page= 79| isbn= 1451604505| first=Brian|last=Solomon|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He first won the title by pinning [[Apache Bull Ramos|Bull Ramos]] on November 16, 1973.&lt;ref name=book62&gt;{{cite book|page=62|isbn=1617499803|publisher=Triumph|title=Superfly: The Jimmy Snuka Story| first= Jimmy| last= Snuka|year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was in this territory that Reiher transformed himself into Jimmy Snuka. Snuka also held the NWA Pacific Northwest Tag Team Championship six times with partner [[Dutch Savage]]. Snuka also had a two-year feud with another rookie, [[Jesse Ventura|Jesse "The Body" Ventura]].&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;

Snuka also wrestled in several other [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) regions, including [[World Class Championship Wrestling |Texas]]. In 1977, he won both the Texas Heavyweight and Tag Team titles. Snuka then left for the [[Jim Crockett Promotions|Mid-Atlantic]] where he formed a tag team with [[Paul Orndorff]]. In their first television match they defeated the NWA World Tag Team Champions [[Jack Brisco|Jack]] and [[Jerry Brisco]] in a non-title bout. Orndorff and Snuka defeated [[Baron von Raschke]] and [[Greg Valentine]] to become the tag team title holders in 1979. On September 1, 1979, Snuka defeated [[Ricky Steamboat]] to hold the United States title. Snuka also formed a tag team with [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]] while with this promotion.

=== World Wrestling Federation (1982–1985) ===
[[File:JimmysnukaatMapleleafgardens1981.jpg|thumb|left|Jimmy Snuka in 1981 at a wrestling event in the Maple Leaf Gardens arena in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.]]
In January 1982, Snuka entered the [[World Wrestling Entertainment|World Wrestling Federation]] (WWF) as a [[Heel (professional wrestling)|villainous character]] under the guidance of [[Lou Albano|Captain Lou Albano]]. Snuka lost several title shots at [[WWE Championship|WWF Champion]] [[Bob Backlund]], including a [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|steel cage match]] at [[Madison Square Garden]] on June 28, 1982 in which Snuka leapt from the top of the cage, and onto Backlund who managed to escape the cage for the win just seconds prior.&lt;ref name= Cawthon-History /&gt;{{rp|369}} The contest was declared [[PWI Match of the Year|Match of the Year]] by ''[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]]''.&lt;ref name= Cawthon-History /&gt;{{rp|369}}

Even though Snuka portrayed a violent villain, he won fans because of his athletic style.&lt;ref name=museum/&gt;&lt;ref name=stevens&gt;{{cite web|title=Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka vs. Ray 'The Crippler' Stevens: December 28, 1982|website= TheHistoryofWWE.com | url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/snukastevensreview.htm|accessdate=August 7, 2015|first=Sheldon|last=Kane III|date=August 17, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a storyline in 1982, [[Buddy Rogers (wrestler)|Buddy Rogers]] told Snuka that Albano was cheating him financially, and as a result, Snuka fired Albano. Snuka took on Rogers as his manager during the feud with Albano, [[Freddie Blassie]], and [[Ray Stevens (wrestler)|Ray Stevens]]. The attack solidified Snuka's new role as a [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] seeking to settle the score.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=WWE Legends|publisher= Simon and Schuster |page= 80| first= Brian| last= Solomon| year= 2010|isbn=1451604505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snuka defeated Stevens in the majority of the series of matches between the two.&lt;ref name=wwf82&gt;{{cite web| first= Graham| last= Cawthon| accessdate= 2015-08-07| website= TheHistoryofWWE.com |title= Rings Results: 1982 |url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/82.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also faced several other of Albano's wrestlers,&lt;ref name=goodbadugly&gt;{{cite book| first= Bert Rudolph|last=Sugar|first2=George|last2=Napolitano|isbn=0-8317-3912-6|title= The Pictorial History of Wrestling: The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|year=1984|publisher=Gallery Books|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; and defeated Albano in a steel cage match in Madison Square Garden.&lt;ref name=goodbadugly/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=168|title=The Squared Circle: Life, Death, and Professional Wrestling |first= David| last= Shoemaker| publisher= Penguin| year= 2013| isbn= 1101609745}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snuka also feuded with [[Don Muraco]] in 1983, which began after Snuka entered the ring for a match against [[Don Kernodle]] on the June 18 episode of ''[[WWF Championship Wrestling|Championship Wrestling]]'' while Muraco, the [[WWE Intercontinental Championship|Intercontinental Heavyweight Champion]], was being interviewed. Muraco, enraged at the perceived lack of respect, confronted Snuka at ringside, triggering a brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Graham| last= Cawthon| title= Ring Results: 1983 |website= TheHistoryofWWE.com | accessdate= 2015-08-10 |url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/83.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; This feud led to a defining moment of Snuka's career on October 17, 1983, in a steel cage match at Madison Square Garden. The match ended in a loss for Snuka, but afterward he dragged Muraco back into the ring and connected with the most famous ''Superfly Splash'' of his career, off the top of the {{convert|15|ft|m|sing=on}} high steel cage.&lt;ref name="Foley, Mick p.34"&gt;Foley, Mick.

In June 1984, Snuka became embroiled in a feud with one of the WWF's top villains, [[Roddy Piper|"Rowdy" Roddy Piper]]. In a segment of ''Piper's Pit'', Piper hit Snuka on the back of the head with a coconut.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f4wonline.com/more/more-top-stories/96-wwe-news/40642-wwf-tuesday-night-titans-episode-3-review-rowdy-roddy-piper-hits-jimmy-superfly-snuka-with-the-coconut-jesse-ventura-lou-thesz-and-ivan-putski |publisher=Figure Four Wrestling |title=WWF Tuesday Night Titans Episode 3 Review |date=2015-01-06 |first=Joshua |last=Molina |accessdate=2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.heraldnews.com/article/20150801/SPORTS/141109343/?Start=2 |title=Chewing the Turnbuckle: 'Rowdy' Roddy Piper talks about visiting Fall River, hitting 'Superfly' Snuka in the head with a coconut, his amazing movie fight with Keith David, and Georgia Championship Wrestling |work= [[The Herald News]]| location= Fall River, Massachusetts |date=2015-08-01 |first=Greg |last=Sullivan| access-date= January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The attack led to a series of grudge matches between the two that were played out over venues across the US throughout the summer of 1984. In late 1984, Snuka entered a [[Drug rehabilitation|rehabilitation]] facility; the WWF created a storyline in which Piper had broken Snuka's neck by hitting him over the head with a chair.&lt;ref name= meltzer /&gt;&lt;ref name= superstars34&gt;{{cite book |first=Daniel |last=Cohen |first2=Susan |last2=Cohen |title=Wrestling Superstars |isbn=0-671-60648-4 |year=1985 |publisher=Archway |page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sam Fatu|The Tonga Kid]], who was [[kayfabe|billed]] as Snuka's nephew, continued the feud on Snuka's behalf.&lt;ref name= superstars34 /&gt;

The remainder of Snuka's initial WWF stint would see him frequently tangling with Piper one way or another, often via tag matches or wrestling Piper's closest ally, [[Bob Orton, Jr.]] Snuka defeated Orton at ''[[The War to Settle the Score]]'' on February 18, 1985; an injury during the match forced Orton to wear a cast on his left arm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/msg2-18-85review.htm|accessdate=2015-08-12|publisher=The History of WWE| first= Alexander |last= Settee| date= 2008-09-18| title= The War To Settle The Score: February 18, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Graham| last= Cawthon| url= http://www.thehistoryofwwe.com/85.htm|accessdate=2015-08-11|website= TheHistoryofWWE.com |title= Ring Results: 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; which he continued to wear after the injury healed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= WWE| title= Bob Orton, Jr.|url=http://www.wwe.com/superstars/bobortonjr |accessdate= 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feud played a small part in the first ever [[WrestleMania (1985)|WrestleMania]] in March 1985, when Snuka acted as a cornerman for [[Hulk Hogan]] and [[Mr. T]] when they defeated Piper and [[Paul Orndorff]] (with Orton in their corner).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher= WWE|title=Full WrestleMania I Results|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/wrestlemania/1/results| accessdate= 2015-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Snuka left the WWF in July 1985,&lt;ref name= dictionary /&gt; though he still appeared in cartoon form when ''[[Hulk Hogan's Rock 'n' Wrestling]]'' premiered in September.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |website= TV.com |url= http://www.tv.com/shows/hulk-hogans-rock-n-wrestling/cast/ |accessdate=2015-08-10 |title=Hulk Hogan's Rock 'N' Wrestling}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=WrestleCrap: The Very Worst of Professional Wrestling |page=48 |first=R.D. |last=Reynolds |year=2003 |publisher=ECW Press |isbn=1-55490-544-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snuka's next notable match took place at [[List of ECW supercards and pay-per-view events#1994|The Night The Line was Crossed]] in 1994, where he faced rising star [[Tommy Dreamer]] in an infamous match. During the match, Dreamer kicked out of a [[Pin (professional wrestling)|pinfall]] attempt by Snuka after a ''[[Professional wrestling aerial techniques#Splash|Superfly Splash]]'', thus marking one of the few times in wrestling history that an opponent kicked out of Snuka's finishing move.&lt;ref&gt;The first opponent to kick out from Snuka's finishing move was [[Kevin Von Erich]] during a televised non-title match on ''Georgia Championship Wrestling''; aired 5 Sep 1981&lt;/ref&gt; Snuka still managed to win by delivering three splashes.

Snuka was inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame|WWF Hall of Fame]] [[WWE Hall of Fame (1996)|class of 1996]].&lt;ref name= WWEbio /&gt; Afterward, he competed at the [[Survivor Series (1996)|1996 Survivor Series]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| publisher= World Wrestling Entertainment|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/survivorseries/history/1996/results/|title=Full Event Results: Survivor Series 1996|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snuka received a lifetime achievement award from WWE at Madison Square Garden on WWE Raw, August 26, 2002.

In 2005, he appeared at the ''WWE Homecoming'', where he delivered a Superfly Splash to [[Rob Conway]]. He was a part of the [[Taboo Tuesday (2005)|Taboo Tuesday]] pay-per-view, where fans voted for him (ahead of Kamala and [[Jim Duggan]]) to team with [[Nick Dinsmore|Eugene]] against Conway and [[Travis Tomko|Tyson Tomko]].&lt;ref name= WWEbio /&gt; Snuka won the match, pinning Conway after a Superfly Splash.

He appeared at the 2007 WWE draft edition of ''Raw'' in a vignette for [[Vince McMahon]] appreciation night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=One Wild Night|publisher=World Wrestling Entertainment|url=http://www.wwe.com/shows/raw/archive/06112007/mainarticle|date=2007-06-11|accessdate=2015-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 24, 2007, Snuka was introduced as [[Sgt.

In 2008, Snuka appeared in the [[Royal Rumble (2008)|Royal Rumble]]. He was in the match less than 5 minutes and primarily focused his efforts on onetime nemesis, [[Roddy Piper]]. Both were quickly eliminated by the next entrant, [[Glenn Jacobs|Kane]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_24339.shtml |first= James| last= Caldwell|title=Caldwell's WWE Royal Rumble Report 1/27: Ongoing "virtual time" coverage of debut HD PPV |accessdate= August 10, 2015|date=January 27, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the March 2, 2009 episode of ''Raw'', he was attacked by [[Chris Jericho]] during a parody of ''Piper's Pit''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Wrestleview|first=Hunter|last=Golden|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-raw-results/11605-raw-results-3209|title=Raw Results 3/2/09|accessdate=2015-08-13|date=2009-03-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was part of a storyline where Jericho was disrespecting and attacking legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| page= 104| publisher= Penguin|year=2014|title=The Best in the World: At What I Have No Idea|first=Chris|last=Jericho|isbn=0698162145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks later, on the March 16, 2009 episode of ''Raw'', Snuka, Roddy Piper, [[Ric Flair]] and [[Ricky Steamboat]] attacked Jericho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-wrestling-results/wwe-raw-results/11234-raw-results-31609|title=Raw Results 3/16/09|publisher=Wrestleview|first=Hunter|last=Golden|accessdate=2015-08-13|date=2009-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At [[WrestleMania XXV]] on April 5, 2009, Snuka teamed with Steamboat and Piper to face Jericho in a Legends of WrestleMania Handicap match with Flair in their corner. Snuka was the first eliminated by Jericho, who eventually won the match.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Pro Wrestling Torch|url=http://pwtorch.com/artman2/publish/PPV_Reports_5/article_31196.shtml|first=Wade|last=Keller|title=Keller's WrestleMania 25 Results|accessdate=2015-08-10|date=2009-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snuka made an appearance on an "old school" edition of ''Raw'' in November 2010, where he stood by his daughter [[Tamina Snuka|Tamina]], in the corner of [[The Usos]] during their match against [[Santino Marella]] and [[Vladimir Kozlov]], which would be his final WWE appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| website= Wrestleview.com| first= Adam| last= Martin| first2= David| last2= Stephens |url= http://www.wrestleview.com/wwe-results/raw-results/18777-raw-results-111510|title=Raw Results – 11/15/10| accessdate= 2015-08-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Following his [[#Nancy Argentino death|arrest in September 2015]], WWE suspended his Legends contract (a long-term deal to make infrequent, non-wrestling appearances) and removed his Hall of Fame page from its website.&lt;ref name=RS&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.rollingstone.com/sports/news/jimmy-snukas-contract-suspended-by-wwe-after-murder-charge-20150903|title=Jimmy Snuka's Contract 'Suspended' by WWE After Murder Charge|first= James| last= Montgomery|work=Rolling Stone|accessdate=September 20, 2015| date= September 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Snuka never stood trial due to his poor health, and after he died in January 2017, Snuka was honored with a video package, which is common for ex-WWE stars who have died, but was considered controversial by some people, due to the apparent murder of his girlfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://popculture.com/wwe/2017/01/24/wwe-jim-ross-apologizes-for-controversial-jimmy-snuka-comments/|title=WWE: Jim Ross Apologizes For Controversial Jimmy Snuka Comments|work=WWE|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Independent circuit and retirement (1996–2015) ===
Snuka continued to spend much of his time with East Coast Wrestling organizations through the late 1990s and into the 2000s. During this time, he wrestled the [[Metal Maniac]] in a series of matches that spanned across many independent wrestling promotions, winning most of these matches. On August 15, 1997, Snuka defeated [[Bill Eadie|The Masked Superstar]] at the ''IWA Night of the Legends'' show in [[Kannapolis, North Carolina]] via disqualification when his opponent hit special guest referee [[Ricky Steamboat]].&lt;ref&gt;Apter, Bill.

=== Nancy Argentino death ===
On May 10, 1983, a few hours after defeating [[José Estrada Sr.|José Estrada]] at a WWF TV taping at the [[Lehigh County]] Agricultural Hall in [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]], Snuka placed a call for an ambulance. When emergency personnel arrived at his room at the George Washington Motor Lodge, they found that his girlfriend, Nancy Argentino, had been injured. She was transported to Allentown's Sacred Heart Medical Center, where she died shortly after of "undetermined craniocerebral injuries." The coroner's report stated that Argentino, 23, died of traumatic brain injuries consistent with a moving head striking a stationary object. Autopsy findings show Argentino suffered more than two dozen cuts and bruises — a possible sign of serious domestic abuse — on her head, ear, chin, arms, hands, back, buttocks, legs, and feet. Forensic pathologist Isidore Mihalakis, who performed the autopsy, wrote at the time that the case should be investigated as a homicide until proven otherwise. Deputy Lehigh County coroner Wayne Snyder later said, "Upon viewing the body and speaking to the pathologist, I immediately suspected [[crime|foul play]] and so notified the district attorney."&lt;ref name=fresh&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.mcall.com/2013-06-28/news/mc-allentown-jimmy-snuka-grand-jury-20130628_1_nancy-argentino-argentino-family-motel-room|title=DA taking 'fresh look' at death of 'Superfly' Snuka mistress| work= The Morning Call|last1= Clark| first1= Adam| first2= Kevin| last2= Amerman|accessdate=August 8, 2015|date=June 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snuka was the only suspect involved in the subsequent investigation. Although charges were not pressed at the time against Snuka, the case was left officially open. In 1985, Argentino’s parents won a $500,000 default judgment against Snuka in [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania|U.S. District Court]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Snuka appears not to have ever paid, claiming financial inability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Muchnick|first=Irv|isbn=1550227610|title=Wrestling Babylon: Piledriving Tales of Drugs, Sex, Death, and Scandal| year=2007|publisher= ECW Press|pages=125–131}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 28, 2013, Lehigh County District Attorney Jim Martin announced that the still-open case would be reviewed by his staff.&lt;ref name= fresh /&gt; On January 28, 2014, Martin announced that the case had been turned over to a [[grand jury]].&lt;ref name= review&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-jimmy-snuka-girlfriend-death-grand-jury-20140128,0,967904,full.story|title=Grand jury to review death of Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka's girlfriend|work=The Morning Call|last1= Clark| first1= Adam| first2= Kevin| last2= Amerman|accessdate=August 8, 2015| date= January 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kirwan II said would be much more helpful in preparing Snuka's case than a hearing would have been.&lt;ref name= forward&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-jimmy-snuka-nancy-argentino-hearing-20151007-story.html |title= Attorney: Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka 'looking forward to clearing his name'| first1= Manuel, Jr.| last1= Gamiz| first2= Peter| last2= Hall| work= The Morning Call |date= October 7, 2015| access-date= January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2015, Snuka pleaded not guilty before Judge Kelly Banach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2015/11/02/22568523.html |website=canoe.com |title=Jimmy Snuka pleads not guilty to murdering girlfriend in 1983 |first=David |last=Dekok |agency=Reuters |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151103201633/http://slam.canoe.com/Slam/Wrestling/2015/11/02/22568523.html |archivedate=November  3, 2015 |date=November 2, 2015 |access-date=January 19, 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A hearing to determine Snuka's competency for trial began in May 2016.

=== Illness and death ===
In August 2015, Snuka's wife, Carole, announced that he was diagnosed with [[stomach cancer]]. As a result, he had surgery to remove his lymph nodes, part of his stomach and all apparent cancer. She said they both expected he would fully recover after "a long road ahead".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/2015/08/03/wife-jimmy-superfly-snuka-diagnosed-with-stomach-cancer/|title=Wife: Jimmy 'Superfly' Snuka diagnosed with stomach cancer|publisher=FoxNews|accessdate=August 8, 2015|date=August 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following [[#Nancy Argentino death|his arrest]], his attorney, William E. Moore, told reporters Snuka has [[dementia]], stemming from wrestling-related injuries, to the point of being unfit for trial,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/jimmy-superfly-snuka-unfit-murder-trial-lawyer-article-1.2346455 |title= Jimmy (Superfly) Snuka’s lawyer argues all those years getting bashed in the ring make him unfit to stand trial for girlfriend’s 1983 murder| first1= Edgar| last1= Sandoval | first2= Larry| last2= McShane| work= New York Daily News| date= September 2, 2015| access-date= January 19, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a judge ultimately agreed.&lt;ref name= CBS /&gt;  

In July 2016, Snuka, represented by his wife, was part of a [[class action]] lawsuit filed against WWE which alleged that wrestlers incurred "long term neurological injuries" and that the company "routinely failed to care" for them and "fraudulently misrepresented and concealed" the nature and extent of those injuries. The suit is litigated by attorney Konstantine Kyros, who has been involved in a number of other lawsuits against WWE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/sports/breaking/ct-wwe-cte-lawsuit-20160719-story.html|title=Dozens of wrestlers sue WWE over CTE, effects of traumatic brain injuries| last= Bieler| first= Des| work= [[Chicago Tribune]] |accessdate= July 20, 2016|date=July 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a court document filed by Kyros in November 2016, Snuka was diagnosed with "[[chronic traumatic encephalopathy]] or a similar disease". WWE challenged the filing, stating that "no medical report was included" in it.  Since [[Chris Benoit double-murder and suicide|the September 2007 autopsy on Chris Benoit that detected he had CTE]], the diagnosis has become a major talking point in the industry, as over 60 wrestlers or estates of deceased wrestlers have entered into litigation against the WWE, according to Kyros. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/09/19/lawsuit-against-wwe-concussions-thrown-out/| title= Judge throws out lawsuit against WWE by ex-pro wrestlers over concussions|last=Rapaport |first=Daniel |work= Sports Illustrated |accessdate=November 25, 2017| date= November 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawsuit was dismissed by US District Judge [[Vanessa Lynne Bryant]] in September 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.denverpost.com/2018/09/19/lawsuit-against-wwe-concussions-thrown-out/| title= Judge throws out lawsuit against WWE by ex-pro wrestlers over concussions|last=Collins|first=Dave|work= [[The Denver Post]] |accessdate=October 22, 2018| date= September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision is currently being appealed by Konstantine Kyros of Kyros Law Offices, PC, which is currently representing the wrestlers and their estates.

On December 2, 2016, it was announced that Snuka was in hospice and had six months left to live, due to a [[terminal illness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mcall.com/news/breaking/mc-jimmy-snuka-competency-review-20161202-story.html|title= Testimony: Jimmy Snuka in hospice, has 6 months to live |last= Schroeder|first=Laurie Mason|work=The Morning Call|accessdate=January 15, 2017 |date=December 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died on January 15, 2017, at age 73 in [[Pompano Beach, Florida|Pompano Beach]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/controversial-wrestler-jimmy-superfly-snuka-dead-73-n707151| title= Controversial Wrestler Jimmy ‘Superfly’ Snuka Dead at 73|last=McCausland|first=Phil|website= NBCNews.com |accessdate=January 15, 2017| date= January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional biography==
Johnny Lawrence was born in 1967. He moved to the upscale neighborhood of [[Encino, Los Angeles|Encino, California]], after his mother Laura married Hollywood producer Sid Weinberg. Johnny had no friends and was ridiculed by his stepfather, especially after quitting drum and magic lessons. He often used his [[Walkman]] to drown out Sid's heckling. One day in 1979, while riding his bicycle, a 12-year-old Johnny discovered the original Cobra Kai [[dojo]] and spent the next five years learning [[karate]] under [[sensei]] John Kreese.

==Appearances==
===''The Karate Kid'' (1984)===
In ''[[The Karate Kid]]'', Johnny is the top student of the Cobra Kai dojo, leader of the Cobra Kai gang, and two-time defending champion of the All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships tournament. Prior to the events of the film, he broke up with classmate Ali Mills after a two-year relationship. One night at a beach, Johnny confronts Ali over their breakup, but New Jersey native [[Daniel LaRusso]] interferes with the argument, and Johnny attacks him after Daniel sucker punches him in the face. Within the next few weeks, Johnny and his Cobra Kai gang harass Daniel in and out of school. It stops for a while, but Daniel soaks Johnny with a hose while he is rolling a [[Cannabis|joint]] at the Halloween dance, causing Johnny and the other Cobras to chase him down and beat him up until Mr. Miyagi, the maintenance man of Daniel's apartment, beats up the gang to save Daniel. The next day, Mr. Miyagi confronts Kreese and proposes to have Daniel and Johnny's feud settled in the upcoming tournament. Kreese agrees, but warns that if they do not show up at the tournament, both Daniel and Mr. Miyagi will be declared fair game to Cobra Kai. 

At the tournament, Johnny advances to the finals, scoring three unanswered points against a highly skilled opponent. When Daniel reaches the semi-finals, Kreese instructs Bobby Brown, one of his more compassionate students and the least vicious of Daniel's tormentors, to put Daniel out of commission. Bobby reluctantly does an illegal kick to Daniel's knee, getting himself disqualified while Johnny looks at Kreese in disgust. As Johnny is about to be declared the winner by default, Ali informs the tournament announcer that Daniel will fight in the final round. During the fight, Daniel gets the upper hand and gives Johnny a bloody nose. Kreese orders Johnny to sweep Daniel's leg, an unethical move. Fearing his sensei, Johnny hits Daniel's bad leg with an elbow strike and receives a warning from the referee. Upon the restart of the round, Johnny loses the match after Daniel lands a [[crane kick]] to his face. Having gained respect for his nemesis, Johnny gives Daniel the trophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=haRTAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134&amp;dq=crane+kick&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjsocaLwqXYAhUFmbQKHZN0Ae8Q6AEIMjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=crane+kick&amp;f=false |title=The Films of John G.

===''The Karate Kid Part II'' (1986)===
In ''[[The Karate Kid Part II]]'', Kreese harshly reprimands Johnny for losing to Daniel, breaking his second-place trophy in the process. The other Cobra Kai students plead for Kreese to let go of his stranglehold on Johnny until Mr. Miyagi intervenes in the incident. Mr. Miyagi dodges Kreese's punches, causing Kreese to injure his hands from breaking two car windows. He further humiliates Kreese by squeezing his nose. Following the incident, Johnny and his friends decide to leave the Cobra Kai dojo forever.

===''Cobra Kai'' (2018–)===
In ''[[Cobra Kai]]'', which takes place 34 years after the first film, Johnny is a down-on-his-luck alcoholic loner who is divorced and estranged from his teenage son Robby while struggling to make a living as a handyman in the [[San Fernando Valley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2018/05/09/cobra-kai-ralph-macchio-and-billy-zabka-on-reigniting-their-classic-karate-kid-rivalry|title=Cobra Kai: Ralph Macchio and Billy Zabka on Reigniting Their Classic Karate Kid Rivalry|first=David|last=Griffin|date=9 May 2018|publisher=IGN|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appears to be oblivious to most current technology after the 1990s, as he still carries a [[Clamshell design|flip phone]] and is unfamiliar with the [[Internet]] and social media platforms such as [[Facebook]]. One night, Johnny saves his teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz from a group of rich bullies at a strip mall after they shove Miguel against his red [[Pontiac Firebird (third generation)|Pontiac Firebird]], but is arrested in the process. He is bailed out by Sid, who offers to buy him out of his life with an undisclosed sum of money. Realizing he needs to reorganize his life, Johnny uses the money to reopen the Cobra Kai dojo, with Miguel as his first student. After Miguel beats up the rich bullies in the school lunchroom, dozens of other students flock to the dojo. 

Johnny tries to enter his dojo in the upcoming All Valley Under-18 Karate Championships tournament, but he discovers that Cobra Kai is serving a lifetime ban due to the ruthless actions of Kreese, Terry Silver, and their student Dynamite Mike Barnes from ''[[The Karate Kid Part III]]''. Johnny approaches the All Valley Committee and explains that his dojo is nothing like the original, considering that Kreese has been dead for years and he has never had any association with Silver or Barnes. Instead, Johnny explains that his dojo is under his sole authority and he endeavors to make a difference to students who have been bullied all their lives. Despite objections by Daniel, who serves as a member of the committee, the board votes to lift the ban and allow Cobra Kai to enter the tournament. As the dojo gains more students, Johnny earns enough money to keep it afloat and pay back Sid, vowing never to return to him again.

With that success, Johnny trains his dojo with even more rigor. However, his conflict with Daniel is exacerbated by a series of misunderstandings, culminating with Daniel's foolish cousin destroying Johnny's car and assaulting him supposedly in Daniel's name. Enraged, Johnny comes to Daniel's home to assault him, but Daniel's wife, Amanda, manages to quickly defuse the conflict by inviting Johnny to breakfast to discuss the matter peacefully and persuading her husband to give Johnny a car from the trade-in lot of his dealership as compensation. While test driving a [[Dodge Challenger#Third generation (2008–present)|2009 Dodge Challenger R/T]], Johnny and Daniel make considerable progress coming to terms, until their return to Daniel's residence leads to Johnny discovering that Robby is Daniel's protege. At that point, Johnny shoves Daniel in a rage, only to have Robby defend his teacher.

At the All Valley tournament, both Miguel and Eli (nicknamed Hawk) make it to semi finals, along with Robby. When Robby and Hawk fight, Hawk is disqualified for injuring Robby's shoulder with an illegal attack, leaving Robby and Miguel to meet in the final match. When Miguel ruthlessly exploits Robby's shoulder against his wishes, Johnny realizes that his teaching methods have been corrupting his students. Miguel wins the tournament and thanks Johnny for his guidance, but Johnny is too dejected by his actions to celebrate. He confronts Robby before he can leave the arena and apologizes to him, which Robby accepts with reasonable politeness. Later that night, his old sensei, John Kreese shows up at the dojo, telling him the real story is just beginning.

==Reception==
The character has been mostly positively received. Initially, he was seen a typical 1980s movie villain. Since the turn of the 21st century, he has being seen as a sort of sympathic antihero especially since the character's reappearance in ''Cobra Kai''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.salon.com/2018/06/17/the-way-of-fatherhood-cobra-kai-style-watch-this-show-today-with-your-dad-or-your-kids/|title=The Way of Fatherhood, as seen in "Cobra Kai"|date=17 June 2018|publisher=Salon|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2010/06/11/the_nuanced_villains_of_the_original_karate_kid.html?via=gdpr-consent|title=The Nuanced Villains of the Original Karate Kid|first=John|last=Swansburg|date=11 June 2010|publisher=|accessdate=21 June 2018|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalpost.com/entertainment/movies/who-was-the-real-bully-in-the-karate-kid-daniel-or-johnny|title=Who was the real bully in The Karate Kid – Daniel or Johnny?|date=24 August 2015|publisher=National Post|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://kotaku.com/proof-that-daniel-was-the-real-bully-in-the-karate-kid-1726074110|title=Proof That Daniel Was The Real Bully In The Karate Kid|first=Gergo|last=Vas|publisher=Kotaku|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The perception that Johnny Lawrence was the real victim was parodied in ''[[How I Met Your Mother]]'' in the episode "[[The Bro Mitzvah]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/03/billy-zabka-himym-karate-kid-psych-interview.html|title=Billy Zabka on How I Met Your Mother, the Zabkatage, and Sweeping the Leg|date=31 March 2014|publisher=Vulture|accessdate=22 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable people who follow the [[straight edge]] lifestyle. Straight edge is a [[subculture]] and [[subgenre]] of [[hardcore punk]] whose adherents refrain from using alcohol, tobacco, and other recreational/non-prescribed drugs ([[marijuana]], [[MDMA]], [[LSD]], [[cocaine]], [[heroin]], etc.). It was a direct reaction to the sexual revolution, hedonism, and excess associated with [[punk rock]].&lt;ref name="exclaim"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://exclaim.ca/Features/Research/straight_edge_punk-complicated_contradictions_of_straight |title=The Complicated Contradictions of Straight Edge Punk |last=Sutherland|first=Sam |date=June 30, 2006 |publisher=''[[Exclaim!]]'' |accessdate=February 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Josh|last=Krist|title=White Punks on Hope|url=http://www.phoenixnewtimes.com/1996-08-22/music/white-punks-on-hope/2|accessdate=22 February 2010|newspaper=[[Phoenix New Times]]|date=22 August 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; For some, this extends to not engaging in [[promiscuity|promiscuous sex]], following a [[vegetarian]] or [[vegan]] diet, and not using caffeine or prescription drugs.&lt;ref name=exclaim/&gt;

[[File:Meeting of the Lagimodieres and First Nations People.png|thumb|250px|Meeting of Marie-Anne and [[Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière]] with [[First Nations]] people, c. 1807]]
'''Marie-Anne Lagimodière''' (née '''Gaboury'''; 2 August 1780 – 14 December 1875) was a [[French-Canadian]] woman noted as both the grandmother of [[Louis Riel]],&lt;ref&gt; {{ cite web | url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/jean-louis-riel/ | title=Jean-Louis Riel | author = Ismène Toussaint | publisher=[[ The Canadian Encyclopedia]] | accessdate= 31 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as the first woman of European descent to travel to and settle in what is now [[Western Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;Lester, Tanya. "A Strong Woman". ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=tkqTiVPDpEYC Indian Record]''. Vol. 48-50. Oblate Fathers; 1985. p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life ==

Gaboury was born in [[Maskinongé, Quebec]], a village near modern [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]].&lt;ref name="Siggins2009"&gt;Maggie Siggins. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=PUtfRQb5ULoC Marie-Anne: The Extraordinary Life of Louis Riel's Grandmother]''. McClelland &amp; Stewart; 13 October 2009. {{ISBN|978-1-55199-325-6}}. p. unpaged.&lt;/ref&gt; As a young woman she kept house for a priest there until her marriage on 21 April 1806 to [[Jean-Baptiste Lagimodière]].&lt;ref name="Manitoba1888"&gt;Historical and Scientific Society of Manitoba. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=fzREAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA23-PA1 Transaction&amp;#91;s&amp;#93;]''. 1888. p. 23–.&lt;/ref&gt; Lagimodière was originally from nearby [[Saint-Ours, Quebec|Saint-Ours]]; he had become a [[Coureur des bois]] employed in the [[fur trade]] by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] in [[Rupert's Land]].

== Travels in the west ==

Immediately following their marriage, and in defiance of the custom of the time, Gaboury travelled to the west with her new husband.  They went first to the area near the confluence of the [[Assiniboine River|Assiniboine]] and [[Red River of the North|Red Rivers]] near what would later become the [[Red River Colony]], and, eventually, modern [[Winnipeg, Manitoba]]. They wintered at a [[Métis people (Canada)|Métis]] encampment near [[Pembina, North Dakota|Pembina]] (under British sovereignty at the time but now in [[North Dakota]]), where the first of her eight children was born on 6 January 1807.&lt;ref name="YoungbergHolmlund2003"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=XhHUzUwJtA4C&amp;pg=PA17 Inspiring Women: A Celebration of Herstory]''. Coteau Books; 2003. {{ISBN|978-1-55050-204-6}}. p. 17–.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following spring, the Lagimodières travelled to the valley of the [[Saskatchewan River]], settling eventually in what is now northern [[Saskatchewan]], where they remained until 1811, living a semi-nomadic lifestyle among other French-Canadian trappers and their native wives. During this period, Marie-Anne accompanied her husband on many trapping and [[American bison|buffalo]] hunting expeditions, often venturing as far west as present-day [[Alberta]].&lt;ref name="Merritt1999"&gt;Susan E. Merritt. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=G1DFQKkqfwAC Her story III: women from Canada's past]''. Vanwell Publishing Limited; 1999. {{ISBN|978-1-55125-037-3}}. p. 28-30.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LunnMoore2016"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=1-nyDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA114 The Story of Canada]''. Scholastic Canada, Limited; 27 September 2016. {{ISBN|978-1-4431-1954-2}}. p. 114–.&lt;/ref&gt; Her second child was born on the open [[prairie]] shortly after her horse had bolted towards a herd of buffalo,&lt;ref name="Millar2000"&gt;Nancy Millar. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=D8b4dEcUENsC&amp;pg=PA158 Once Upon a Wedding: Stories of Weddings in Western Canada, 1860-1945, for Better Or Worse]''. Bayeux Arts; 2000. {{ISBN|978-1-896209-33-3}}. p. 158–.&lt;/ref&gt; and on another occasion she fought and shot a large [[bear]] that had attacked one of their companions.

The young family was once taken prisoner while trapping by [[Tsuu T'ina]] tribesmen because of their association with local [[Cree]]. Although they managed to escape on horseback, they were pursued for five days until reaching the safety of Fort des Prairie (also known as Fort Augustus, a counterpart to [[Fort Edmonton]]) near modern [[Edmonton, Alberta]].

Before his marriage, Jean-Baptiste had previously been involved {{lang|fr|[[marriage 'à la façon du pays'|à la façon du pays]]}} [in the style of the country] with a native woman who had borne his children. Marie-Anne was tolerant and accepting of the children arising from this previous relationship, although the other woman was jealous and reportedly threatened to poison her.&lt;ref name="Lennox2013"&gt;Doug Lennox. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=xBBMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT2520 Now You Know Absolutely Everything: Absolutely every Now You Know book in a single ebook]''. Dundurn; 6 December 2013. {{ISBN|978-1-4597-2478-5}}. p. 2520–.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this incident, the Lagimodières generally had good relationships with the [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Aboriginal peoples]] they encountered. Marie-Anne was often regarded as an object of curiosity by the Natives during her travels, as she was invariably the first white woman they had ever seen – some were even led to believe that she possessed supernatural powers.

== Return to the Red River ==

On hearing that [[Thomas Douglas, 5th Earl of Selkirk|Lord Selkirk]] was establishing a permanent colony at the Red River, they returned to help establish the new [[Red River Colony]] in the spring of 1812.&lt;ref name="Silversides2005"&gt;Brock Silversides. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ley-LL3RiIMC&amp;pg=PA6 Fort de Prairies: The Story of Fort Edmonton]''. Heritage House Publishing Co; 2005. {{ISBN|978-1-894384-98-8}}. p. 6–.&lt;/ref&gt; The early history of the settlement was characterized by struggles between the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] and its rival, the [[North West Company]], culminating in the [[Battle of Seven Oaks (1816)|Battle of Seven Oaks]] in 1816. Although the Lagimodières managed to avoid involvement with the violent confrontations, Jean-Baptiste was asked by HBC representative [[Colin Robertson (fur trader)|Colin Robertson]] to take news of the events to Lord Selkirk. Over the winter of 1815–1816, Lagimodière travelled over 2,900 kilometers on horseback and on foot in fulfillment of this mission. During this time, Marie-Anne was obliged to seek shelter among the aboriginal tribes when the Nor'Westers took possession of [[Fort Douglas (Canada)|Fort Douglas]]. On his return from the east, Jean-Baptiste was taken prisoner by the Nor'Westers and was imprisoned in [[Fort William, Ontario|Fort William]] until August 1816. The Lagimodières were not reunited until September 1816, after the unrest had subsided.

In recognition of his service, Lord Selkirk awarded Jean-Baptiste a tract of land near the Red River, which the Lagimodières successfully homesteaded for many years.&lt;ref name="(Alta.)Committee2004"&gt;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=JWWo___pkQUC&amp;pg=PA278 Naming Edmonton: From Ada to Zoie]''. University of Alberta; 2004. {{ISBN|978-0-88864-423-7}}. p. 278–.&lt;/ref&gt; They had six more children, including, in 1822, Julie Lagimodière, the future mother of [[Louis Riel]].&lt;ref name="Fromhold"&gt;Joachim Fromhold. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=g9XmAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA177 Alberta History - The Old North Trail (Cree Trail), 15,000 Years of Indian History: 1750-1822]''. Lulu.com; {{ISBN|978-1-105-96418-3}}. p. 177–.&lt;/ref&gt; Dying at age 95 in 1875, Marie-Anne lived to see [[Manitoba]] become part of the [[Canadian Confederation]] following Riel's actions during the [[Red River Rebellion]] of 1869–1870.

== Legacy ==
She is sometimes remembered as the "Grandmother of the Red River", and many of the [[Métis people]] of the [[Canadian Prairies]] can trace their ancestry to her.

[[École Marie-Anne-Gaboury]], a [[French immersion]] [[elementary school]] in [[St. Vital, Manitoba|St. Vital]], [[Winnipeg]], [[Manitoba]] was named in her honour, as is [[Rue Marie Anne Gaboury]] in [[Bonnie Doon, Edmonton|Bonnie Doon]], [[Edmonton]], [[Alberta]] which is the home to the French-language section of the [[University of Alberta]], the [[University of Alberta Faculté Saint-Jean|Campus Saint-Jean]].

The 1978 Canadian feature film ''[[Marie-Anne (film)|Marie-Anne]]'' tells a fictionalized story of "the first white woman in Western Canada".

{{About|a sociological group|the Jewish denomination also known as "Masorti"|Conservative Judaism}}
'''Masortim''' ({{lang-he-n|מסורתיים}}, lit. "Traditional [people]", also known as '''''Shomrei Masoret''''', {{Hebrew|שומרי מסורת}}, "upholders of tradition")' is an [[Israel]]i term&lt;ref name="forward"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Guttman |first=Nathan |date=9 March 2016 |title=Pew Report: Meet the Masorti, Israel’s ‘Traditional’ Tribe |url=https://forward.com/news/335410/pew-report-meet-the-masorti-israels-traditional-tribe/ |magazine=[[The Forward]] |location=[[New York City]] |publisher=Rachel Fishman Feddersen}}&lt;/ref&gt; of self-definition, describing the [[Israeli Jews]] who perceive and define themselves as neither strictly [[Orthodox Judaism|religious]] (''[[Religion in Israel#Israeli terms of Religious degrees|Dati]]'') nor secular (''[[Hiloni]]'').&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt;

{{Jews and Judaism sidebar |Culture}}

== Group ==
Masortim observe a number of ''[[minhag]]im'' and several basic religious commandments that are the most recognizable symbols of the [[Jewish]] tradition. In doing so, they seek to express their affinity to the [[Jews|Jewish people]] and especially their will to continue their families' religious customs and traditions, as they maintain that there is a need to preserve the traditional [[Value (ethics)|value]]s and customs, in order to guard the continuity of the existence of the Jewish people.{{Citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Masortim are distinct from [[Conservative Judaism]], which is sometimes called ''Masorti Judaism''.

The majority of ''Shomrei Masoret'' are [[Mizrahi Jews]], i.e. those of oriental origin (i.e. [[Middle East]], [[Central Asia]] and [[North Africa]]). The exact number of the ''Masortim'' is hard to determine, since it is based upon the self-definition of the participants in surveys. However, according to [[Israel Central Bureau of Statistics]], as of 2006, 39% of the Jewish population within Israel define themselves as Masortim.&lt;ref&gt;Yaacov Yadgar: ''Judaism, Israeli Forms of''. In: Judith Reesa Baskin (editor): ''The Cambridge Dictionary of Judaism and Jewish Culture''. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge 2011, {{ISBN|978-0-521-82597-9}}, S. 342.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pew Research Center]] estimates the masorti at 29% of Jews in Israel (or 23% of all Israeli adults).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2016/03/08/israels-religiously-divided-society/ |title=Israel’s Religiously Divided Society |date=8 March 2016 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Traditions==
''Shomrei Masoret'' perceive the preservation of the Jewish tradition, minhagim, and family customs, as an educational and a [[Family values|Family value]].

The tradition, minhagim, and family customs is also relevant in terms of the Jewish denomination of origin affiliation, and thus the percentage of ''Shomrei Masoret'' is especially high among the Mizrahi denomination of origin affiliation. Many of them (and their offspring) define themselves as ''Shomer Masoret'' (or ''Masorati''), even if some or part of their lifestyle's customs are generally accounted as secular (''[[Hiloni]]''), still, they pay heed to preserving and keeping the Jewish Tradition heritage as it was observed in their or their parents' country of origin. In that conjunction, one should mention the political party of ''[[Shas]]'' (a religious-Orthodox Mizrahi-denomination political party), who raised the banner of "{{Hebrew|להחזיר עטרה ליושנה}}" (''Restore Past Glory''), a slogan that swept many non-religious-Orthodox Mizrahi-denomination voters, who, nevertheless, see the importance of preserving their Jewish Tradition denomination.

One may not find many [[Ashkenazi]] (European origin) Israelis defining themselves as ''Shomer Masoret'' (or ''Masorati''). This is because, among other reasons, the dichotomy that was created after the [[Age of Enlightenment]], between Secular, Reform and Orthodox European Jews, was a dichotomy that did not exist among the Middle Eastern Jews.

==The Traditionalist and Tradition Keeper distinguishing qualities==
Masortim are not a denomination of Judaism but rather a sociological group that exists only in Israel,&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt; and their attitude towards the religious observance has much do with one's personal preferences and tendencies, and in the context of their desire to see themselves as part of the comprehensive Jewish religious system, without being obligated to full observance of the [[Mitzvah|religious commandments]] ([[613 commandments|613 Mitzvot]]).&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt; Every Masorti has his/her own level of observance, which depends only on one's own free will and one's personal selection of what is perceived by him/her as a relevant religious commandment, tradition or custom of [[Orthodox Judaism]].&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt;

Nevertheless, one may ascribe to the majority of them, a notable distinguishing quality – the preservation of the basic Jewish traditional ''minhagim'', that are accounted as the most recognizable elements of Orthodox Judaism:&lt;ref name="forward" /&gt;

* [[Kashrut]] observance – Many Masortim give heed not to eat [[pork]], [[shellfish]], or any other non-Kosher food, and observe the separation of [[Milk and meat in Jewish law|Milk and meat]] kitchen activities and dishes.
* [[Kiddush]] Shabbat – a weekly family dinner on the eve of every [[Shabbat]], and sanctification ([[Kiddush]]) of the entering day of Shabat, over a Kiddush-cup of wine.
* [[Mezuzah]] – affixing a Mezuzah at the house's front door.
* Attending their [[synagogue]]s on Shabbat and on the most recognizable Jewish festivals (such as: [[Rosh Hashanah]], [[Yom Kippur]] etc.), on regular basis. Some even wear the [[Tefillin]] every morning.
* Following Orthodox traditions and maintaining an Orthodox atmosphere on family events, such as  weddings, [[Bar Mitzva]], and [[Brit milah]].
* Usually, the male does not wear a [[kippah]]/yarmulke (Only on Shabbat and Jewish festivals), and thus does not appear observant-religious. Some keep a yarmulke within their pocket or in their car, instead of wearing it, as to be ready for any event or time that the Shabbat or a Jewish festival has come and thus is time for them to pull out the yarmulke and start observing, or so they will be ready to go to the synagogue at any given time, as well as attend a wedding or any other event with a religious aspect in it.

'''Mathew Charles''' "'''Matt'''" '''Lamb''' (5 January 1948 – 7 November 1976) was a Canadian [[spree killer]] who, in 1967, avoided Canada's [[capital punishment in Canada|then-mandatory death penalty]] for [[Murder|capital murder]] by being found [[mental disorder defence|not guilty by reason of insanity]]. Abandoned by his teenage mother soon after his birth in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario, Lamb suffered an abusive upbringing at the hands of his step-grandfather, leading him to become emotionally detached from his relatives and peers. He developed violent tendencies that manifested themselves in his physical assault of a police officer at the age of 16 in February 1964, and his engaging in a brief shoot-out with law enforcement ten months later. After this latter incident he spent 14 months, starting in April 1965, at [[Kingston Penitentiary]], a [[Correctional Service of Canada#Security classification of offenders|maximum security prison]] in eastern Ontario.

Seventeen days after his release from jail in June 1966, Lamb took a shotgun from his uncle's house and went on a shooting spree around his East Windsor neighbourhood, killing two strangers and wounding two others. He was charged with capital murder, which under the era's [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] called for a mandatory death penalty, but he avoided this fate when the court found, in January 1967, that he had not been sane at the time of the incident. He was committed for an indefinite time in a psychiatric unit. Over the course of six years in care at [[Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene|Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre]]'s Oak Ridge facility he displayed a profound recovery, prompting an independent five-man committee to recommend to the [[Executive Council of Ontario]] that he be released, saying that he was no longer a danger to society. The Council approved Lamb's release in early 1973 on the condition that he spend a year living and working under the supervision of one of Oak Ridge's top psychiatrists, Elliot Barker.

Lamb continued to show improvement, becoming a productive labourer on Barker's farm and earning the trust of the doctor's family. With Barker's encouragement, Lamb joined the [[Rhodesian Security Forces|Rhodesian Army]] in late 1973 and fought for the [[list of historical unrecognized states|unrecognised]] government of [[Rhodesia]] (modern-day Zimbabwe) for the rest of his life. He started his service in the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]], and won a place in the crack [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Special Air Service]] unit in 1975, but was granted a transfer back to his former regiment a year later. Soon after he was promoted to [[Lance corporal|lance-corporal]], Lamb was [[killed in action]] on 7 November 1976 by an errant shot from one of his own men. He received what ''[[Newsweek]]'' called "a hero's funeral"&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; in the Rhodesian capital, [[Harare|Salisbury]], before his ashes were returned to Windsor and buried by his relatives.

==Early life==
[[File:Windsor Ontario skyline.jpg|thumb|[[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario lies on the border between Canada and the United States, directly opposite [[Detroit]], Michigan, from where it is seen in this 2007 photograph. The two cities are separated by the [[Detroit River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|City of Windsor}}&lt;/ref&gt;|alt=A landscape photograph of a modern North American city beside a river, taken from the other side of the water at a distance of perhaps 300 metres. A number of high-rise buildings are visible as well as a paved promenade on the waterfront.]]

Mathew Charles Lamb was born in [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]], Ontario on 5 January 1948, the only child of a 15-year-old mother who abandoned him soon after birth. Raised by an assortment of grandparents, aunts and uncles,&lt;ref name=windsorstardeath2/&gt; he rarely saw his mother while growing up and never knew his father, who died in the United States while Lamb was young. Lamb spent most of his childhood with his maternal grandmother and her new husband Christopher Collins at their home on York Street in the South Central neighbourhood of Windsor, where his presence was resented by the step-grandfather Collins.&lt;ref name="aboutaman"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Sutton|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to interviews with relatives, friends and neighbours conducted by Lamb's legal counsel Saul Nosanchuk in the mid-1960s, Collins subjected the boy to sustained emotional and physical abuse, beating him and frequently calling him a "little [[wikt:bastard|bastard]]".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; The direction of this violence was not limited to Lamb himself, however; he often witnessed his step-grandfather and grandmother fighting while he was still a small boy.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk6772"&gt;{{Harvnb |Nosanchuk |1999 |pp=67–72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamb started exhibiting violent traits of his own from an early age. Nosanchuk writes that the young boy lured his cousins into his bedroom, locked them in a closet and threatened them. On one occasion he followed through with these threats and beat one of his cousins so badly that medical attention was required at a local hospital.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; "I remember once," said Greg Sweet, a childhood friend, "when he was about seven years old, he held a knife to a smaller kid and made him eat dog faeces".&lt;ref name=meankid/&gt; Lamb first attended Colbourne School in [[Tecumseh, Ontario|Tecumseh]], where Collins later said he appeared to be normal.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; School staff agreed, later telling the ''[[Windsor Star]]'' that he rarely got into trouble, and was capable, but unable to concentrate for extended periods.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt;

Starting with [[Eighth grade#Canada and the United States|Grade 8]], when he was 13, Lamb went to St Jude's School in Windsor, where the other pupils found him to be distant and quiet. According to a fellow pupil, he spurned attempts by the other children to include him in their social circles. For example, Lamb once refused an invitation to a party, saying that he "didn't like to dance."&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; Developing a keen interest in weapons, Lamb began to carry a knife to school, which he had little hesitation in showing off. He also became fascinated with firearms; according to Sweet, he and Lamb "always had guns, from the time [they] were about 12 years old".&lt;ref name=meankid/&gt; Sweet later told the ''Windsor Star'' that police were not informed when, as a teenager, Lamb strolled down a residential street "firing a shotgun at the houses of people he didn't like".&lt;ref name=meankid/&gt; Sweet also said that around this time Lamb assembled a collection of bullets and wrote the names of various local policemen on them. Lamb's hobby even extended to crude bombs, which he taught himself to produce using parts of various weapons. When he accidentally detonated one of these concoctions during preparation his leg was sprayed with shrapnel.&lt;ref name=meankid/&gt;

On 10 February 1964, barely a month after he turned 16, Lamb confronted a physically imposing&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; police sergeant outside the [[Windsor Arena]] and, in front of a large crowd of people, leapt upon the far larger man and repeatedly punched him in the face. According to journalist Bob Sutton's account in the ''Windsor Star'' (published three years later), Lamb did this "for no apparent reason".&lt;ref name=windsorstardeath2/&gt;&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; Lamb was convicted of assault under the [[Juvenile Delinquents Act]] and served six months at the House of Concord, a young offenders' unit near [[London, Ontario|London]], Ontario, run by the [[Salvation Army]]. Upon his release, Lamb was sent by his step-grandfather to live in East Windsor with his uncle, Earl Hesketh. With Hesketh's support, Lamb briefly attended [[Assumption College School]], where apart from a dislike for learning Latin, he performed creditably. However, with no real motivation to study, the boy soon dropped out to look for work. He was unable to hold down a permanent job and drifted through a series of short-term engagements, none lasting more than three months.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt;

==Kingston Penitentiary==
On the evening of 24 December 1964, Lamb smashed the front window of Lakeview Marine and Equipment, a sporting goods store in Tecumseh, and stole three revolvers and a double-barrelled shotgun. Using one of the revolvers, he fired twice on a police constable and the shop's co-owner, missing both times. The officer returned several shots, leading Lamb to come forward with his hands raised. "Don't shoot. I give up," he said.&lt;ref name=convictionjan1965/&gt; He then showed the constable where he had hidden the other two handguns and the shotgun. Lamb, who turned 17 during the trial, was tried and convicted as an adult for "breaking, entering and theft ... [and] possession of a .22 calibre revolver, dangerous to public peace".&lt;ref name="convictionjan1965"&gt;{{Harvnb

|pp=73–75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magistrate J. Arthur Hanrahan sentenced him to two years at [[Kingston Penitentiary]], a [[Correctional Service of Canada#Security classification of offenders|maximum security prison]].&lt;ref name=convictionjan1965/&gt; According to Nosanchuk's account, the severity of the sentence was unusual for a first-time adult offender who had not caused anybody physical harm. Hanrahan, Nosanchuk writes, must have deemed Lamb beyond rehabilitation.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7375/&gt; The boy arrived at the penitentiary in April 1965.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt;

Psychiatric examinations and psychological tests conducted on Lamb at Kingston revealed an extremely immature young man who was strongly drawn to weapons. The prison doctors noted that the boy was very aggressive, did not tolerate discipline and had very little control over his behaviour.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7375/&gt; Soon after he arrived, Lamb assaulted another prisoner and had to be put into solitary confinement. The prison's director of psychiatry, George Scott, said that the boy had shown signs of "an obvious mental breakdown".&lt;ref name=windsorstardeath2/&gt;&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; Not long after this, Lamb knelt beside his bed and pushed a broom handle into his rectum. When he was discovered in this state by a guard, Scott examined the boy immediately, having to sedate him to do so. "I think this young man is developing a mental illness of [[hypomania|hypomanic]] nature," he wrote in his report.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7375/&gt; In further interviews conducted by Scott, Lamb related what the doctor described as "elaborate fantasies involving robberies, fights, and shootings that demonstrated enormous hostility".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7375/&gt;

Lamb attempted suicide several times and for years afterwards bore scars where he had tried to slit his wrists.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; According to Nosanchuk, by early March 1966 the prisoner's behaviour "bordered on [[psychosis|psychotic]]".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7375/&gt; During this month he threw food at an officer and was once again found with a broomstick in his rectum, this time dragging it around the floor of his cell and laughing. When Scott sedated Lamb and questioned him on the latter incident, the boy said he had just been trying to annoy the guard on duty. Scott once again noted his concern that Lamb was developing a hypomanic condition, a mania of low intensity, and on 18 March committed him to Kingston Psychiatric Hospital for a month. Scott wrote in his report to the hospital that he was not sure whether Lamb's condition was genuine or whether he was just putting on an act.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7375/&gt;

Lamb returned to the penitentiary on 18 April 1966 with a report saying that, if released, he would probably relapse into [[recidivism]]. Scott grew nervous as Lamb's release date approached: he believed that allowing Lamb to return home could be dangerous for the community, but at the same time he was not certain about the young man's psychiatric state, describing it as "borderline" or "marginal".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7375/&gt; Lamb had, Scott noted, shown some minor improvement since his time in the hospital. Even discounting this, the symptoms observed in Lamb were not consistent and the doctor did not think he had evidence conclusive enough to certify Lamb as mentally unsound. He even still considered that the boy could just be playing immature games with the penal system. In this uncertainty, Scott resolved that he could not bar Lamb's release. The 18-year-old boy left Kingston on 8 June 1966, ten months ahead of schedule, and returned home to Windsor. He was taken in by another uncle, Stanley Hesketh, who lived at 1912 Ford Boulevard. Lamb secured a job as a woodworker on his release and after starting work showed no signs of irregular conduct.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt;

==Shooting spree==
===Incident===
Seventeen days after his release from Kingston Penitentiary, on the evening of 25 June 1966, Lamb discovered a shotgun in his uncle's house. He took the weapon and left the house shortly before 22:00 [[Eastern Time Zone|Eastern Time]], then walked a single block north along Ford Boulevard and hid behind a tree outside number 1872. Six young people—Edith Chaykoski, 20, her 22-year-old brother Kenneth, his wife and three friends, 21-year-old Andrew Woloch, Vincent Franco and Don Mulesa—were heading south from 1635 Ford Boulevard on their way to a bus stop on Tecumseh Road when they approached the tree behind which Lamb was hiding at about 22:15. Lamb suddenly stepped out in front of the strangers, pointed the shotgun at them and said "Stop. Put up your hands!"&lt;ref name=chargeyouthambushslayer/&gt; When Edith Chaykoski stepped forward, towards Lamb, he shot her in the abdomen. Woloch then moved and was hit in the stomach by a second shot, which also wounded Kenneth Chaykoski. Lamb then ran across the street to 1867 Ford Boulevard and fired on a girl whose silhouette he had spotted in a side doorway of the house; his target, 19-year-old Grace Dunlop, was injured. As law enforcement and medical assistance were summoned, Lamb strolled away and walked two blocks before knocking on a door, which he had seemingly chosen at random. Pointing the shotgun at the elderly lady who lived there, Ann Heaton, he threatened to kill her. When Heaton cried out to her husband Forrest to phone the police, Lamb fled, throwing the shotgun over the old couple's fence into a field. He returned to the Hesketh house and went to sleep.&lt;ref name="chargeyouthambushslayer"&gt;{{Harvnb

Edith Chaykoski died from her wounds at Windsor Metropolitan Hospital at about 05:30 on 26 June.&lt;ref name=chargeyouthambushslayer/&gt; Police searched the neighbourhood during the morning and found the shotgun where Lamb had thrown it. They identified it as Hesketh's and concluded that the 18-year-old must have taken it and gone on a [[spree killer|shooting spree]] the previous day. Lamb was arrested at 15:30 on 26 June and charged with the [[murder|capital murder]] of Edith Chaykoski.&lt;ref name=chargeyouthambushslayer/&gt; Under the terms of Canadian law at that time, he faced a [[capital punishment in Canada|mandatory death penalty]] if convicted. When Woloch's injuries also proved fatal at 14:45 on 11 July 1966, his murder was added to Lamb's charge.&lt;ref name="secondvictimdies"&gt;{{Harvnb

===Psychiatric examination===
On the morning of 27 June 1966, Lamb appeared without legal counsel at [[Essex County, Ontario|Essex County]] Magistrate's Court in Windsor, where he was remanded for psychiatric examination.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; As he was being escorted from the courthouse at around noon, the boy attempted to escape custody and, when restrained, begged the officers to shoot him.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; A private psychiatrist from Windsor, Walter Yaworsky, gauged the teenager's mental state in an interview starting at 12:30. Yaworsky said that Lamb was "hyperactive and agitated";&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7577/&gt; he was unable to sit still and periodically rose from his seat and paced around the room. He was silent for a few minutes, apparently irritated, then began laughing as if in a state of euphoria. When questioned by Yaworsky directly, Lamb did not appear concerned about the interview: he treated his murder charge lightly and when asked about his spell in Kingston Penitentiary began laughing.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk7577"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nosanchuk
|1999
|pp=75–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After dismissing a few more questions as "unimportant", the 18-year-old giggled childishly and said he "needed a lawyer".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7577/&gt; Lamb's conversation with the doctor continued incoherently, with Lamb "leaping from topic to topic",&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7577/&gt; in Yaworsky's words. The young man continued to rise and pace around the room as the interview went on; he spoke in a casual, off-hand manner, giving non-specific answers to the doctor's questions and describing people especially vaguely. When asked about his parents, he simply said "I don't remember."&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7577/&gt; Yaworsky then inquired where his mother was, leading the boy to laugh as he replied, "I don't remember. Somewhere."&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7577/&gt; When the doctor finally asked directly about the night of the shootings, Lamb said that he could not recall shooting anybody and that all he remembered was going home in a taxi, then being awoken by his uncle shaking him.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7577/&gt;

When the interview ended at 13:35, the doctor noted that he found Lamb's hour-long maintenance of this seemingly hypomanic behaviour "remarkable".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7577/&gt; Simulation on Lamb's part was unlikely, Yaworsky believed, and lack of memory credible. The doctor wrote in his report that Lamb had been "suffering from a disease of the mind" at the time of the shootings, which had caused him to be in a kind of dream world, outside of reality.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; Standing before the magistrate that same afternoon, Yaworsky testified that Lamb was mentally unsound and not fit to stand trial. The magistrate once again remanded Lamb, this time to custody at [[Mental Health Centre Penetanguishene|Penetanguishene Mental Health Centre]] for a minimum of 30 days.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; Lamb was again examined on 29 June 1966, this time by James Dolan, the Clinical Director of Psychiatry at [[St. Thomas, Ontario|St Thomas]] Elgin General Hospital.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt;

Lamb described the incident for Dolan in far more detail. He said that on 25 June he had finished his woodworking job at 15:00, refused to work overtime (having put in 62 hours that week), then drunk six beers at home during the afternoon and gone to sleep at 21:00. He woke up soon after, he said, and loaded his uncle's shotgun, intending to kill himself. "Next thing I knew," he continued, "I was on the street."&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; He told Dolan that he had seen people "as if they were on television".&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; He heard the sound of a gun being fired as if it were coming from far away, and remembered a voice that was not his own saying "Put up your hands".&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; He then remembered hearing the dim, far-off gun again, a vision of a terrified man standing before him, then yet another shot. He told Dolan he remembered crossing the street, seeing a girl's outline in a doorway and "somehow" shooting at her.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; Lamb then said he had fired at a passing car, and that "everything seemed unreal."&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; He said that the next thing he had memory of was confronting an elderly lady at a house nearby, suddenly thinking "what the hell am I in here for" and leaving.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; He concluded his account by saying that he had hailed a cab from the corner of Pillette and Tecumseh Road and gone back to his uncle's house.&lt;ref name="windsorstarreportoftrial"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Windsor Star
|1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After 30 days, on 27 July, the staff at Penetanguishene still deemed him unfit to stand trial, but by 27 August 1966 his state had improved enough for the doctors to allow his return to custody at Windsor. The doctors reported that he could now face the court—they said that the young man was now able to understand what the proceedings against him meant, and capable of working alongside a legal advisor.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; Because Lamb could not afford legal counsel, Justice Saul Nosanchuk was assigned by a local [[legal aid]] plan to advise him in the upcoming trial. Nosanchuk says that Lamb had "no hesitation" in signing a paper authorising the justice to represent him.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt;

===Mental disorder defence===
{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=He did not really appear to be deeply concerned as to what would happen to him as a result of the charge against him even though he faced the death penalty if convicted of capital murder. He seemed quite prepared to let justice take its course.|source=&lt;small&gt;Justice [[Saul Nosanchuk]] describes his first interview with Lamb&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt;&lt;/small&gt;|quoted = 1}}

Nosanchuk quickly resolved that the only way to win the case and prevent the teenager from being [[hanging|hanged]] was to explore the background and circumstances both of the incident and of Lamb himself with a view to a [[mental disorder defence]]. At their first interview together, Nosanchuk says that Lamb was a "slightly built, almost frail, quiet and detached 18-year-old ... very boyish in appearance. He had an exceedingly polite demeanour. He was most appreciative and grateful that I had undertaken his defence."&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; When Nosanchuk asked the boy about the events of 25 June, Lamb became hesitant, disjointed and confused in his conversation; "he seemed to view these events as if he was not really involved in them," Nosanchuk recalled.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; Lamb said that although he did have a faint recollection of what had happened, he could not remember taking the shotgun, loading it or shooting anybody. He said that earlier during the afternoon on 25 June he had watched a film on television in which somebody had shot and killed several people, but did not make clear whether he had been re-enacting this. The lawyer then asked Lamb to discuss his personal background, childhood and family. The 18-year-old was very reluctant to do so and when he did, Nosanchuk says that the boy seemed emotionally detached from the relatives and events he described.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt;

Lamb appeared to the justice to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was no doubt that he had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and there was no evidence of provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to [[manslaughter]] were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed [[amnesia]] for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened "in detail".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7779/&gt; He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk6772/&gt; He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he "clearly did not have any real underlying feeling of remorse".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7779/&gt; He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or [[psychopathy|psychopathic]] personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the [[Criminal Code (Canada)|Criminal Code]] and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk7779"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nosanchuk

|pp=77–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Nosanchuk was still not certain that he would attempt to defend Lamb on mental grounds. In Ontario at that time, a defendant found not guilty under these terms remained imprisoned indefinitely unless an order for his release came from the province's [[Executive Council of Ontario|Executive Council]], acting on the advice of a Review Board including a Supreme Court Judge. Yaworsky warned Nosanchuk that even if he used an insanity defence and won, Lamb would probably be committed to an institution for the criminally insane for life. It was still possible for the lawyer to approach the prosecution and propose a [[plea bargain]], offering to plead guilty to non-capital murder, which would result in life imprisonment for Lamb but allow a parole hearing after 10 years. In any case, Nosanchuk could not use the case he had prepared unless he first received unequivocal written instruction from his client to plead insanity. Having been given a week by his counsel to consider the matter, Lamb wrote to Nosanchuk that he wished to attempt a mental disorder defence. The boy made clear his understanding that if he were found not guilty under these terms, the state still had the right to detain him for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7779/&gt;

Nosanchuk then considered whether or not to call Lamb to the stand on his own behalf at the trial. He already had a strong defence, with five psychiatrists firmly behind him as well as George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary, who had agreed to testify on his behalf. The lawyer considered the boy's probable reaction to a cross-examination by the prosecution in court. Lamb appeared calm and collected on the surface, and had so far answered questions about right and wrong in a somewhat rational way. Although the doctors had been able to see Lamb's answers for what they really were, Nosanchuk feared that Lamb's appearance could actually lead the jury to believe that he was sane, which might lead to a guilty verdict and the gallows. He therefore did not call Lamb to the stand.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7779/&gt;

==Trial==
After a brief preliminary hearing starting on 8 October 1966, during which Lamb reportedly showed no signs of emotion,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Windsor Star
|8 October 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; the young man's trial for capital murder began on 16 January 1967 at Essex County Courthouse in Windsor. Because of the charge's severity, the case was heard by a judge and jury under the auspices of [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice|Ontario's Supreme Court]], which chose Justice Alexander Stark to preside.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; The trial started with Lamb pleading not guilty to the capital murder of Edith Chaykoski and Andrew Woloch; Nosanchuk then opened his mental disorder defence under Section 562 of the Canadian Criminal Code. Stark gave an order allowing all relevant psychiatric doctors to remain, then allowed the Crown to open its case against Lamb.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7980/&gt;

===Testimonies and cross-examinations===
;Prosecution
The prosecutor, Eugene Duchesne [[Queen's Counsel|QC]], began his case by calling Mathew Lamb's uncle, Stanley Hesketh, to the stand. Hesketh testified that three hours after the shootings his nephew had told him that he "must have done it".&lt;ref name=nosanchuk7980/&gt; He said that since his nephew had come to live with him following his release from prison, he had always been exceptionally polite and helpful to his family. However, during the morning of 26 June Lamb had for the first time been hesitant, not giving full answers to questions and generally acting in a less open manner. Duchesne then called witnesses of the shootings, who agreed unanimously that Lamb had been unhurried, cool and collected. When cross-examined by Nosanchuk about this unusual calmness, they said that Lamb had appeared very distant and did not seem to have any bearing on what was happening around him: one of the witnesses said that Lamb had not appeared to even notice a very loud party in progress across the street. Heaton said that the boy had looked frightened and had fled without reason when she called to her husband. The police officers who arrested Lamb also agreed that the defendant had been unusually cool and silent. Hesketh told the court that when he had come home his nephew had been fast asleep in bed.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk7980"&gt;{{Harvnb

;Defence
The defence began to present its psychiatric evidence on the third day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his examination of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed "poor [[wiktionary:broad#Noun|broad]]", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having "giggled" at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then "felt fuzzy" when he fired the gun.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; Yaworsky quoted Lamb: "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out."&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt;

In his cross-examination of the two doctors, Duchesne cited the psychological reports filed on Lamb at Penetanguishene in 1966, which had determined Lamb to have an IQ of 125, far above most of his 18-year-old peers.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt; The prosecutor proposed that it was not beyond Lamb, with his psychopathic personality and high level of intelligence, to invent a story of amnesia and confusion to avoid responsibility for satisfying his dangerous impulses by consciously killing people. Both Yaworsky and Dolan said that although this was possible, they were each sticking to their original conclusions made in the days following the incident.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk81"&gt;{{Harvnb

{{Quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=... we isolated him at his own request because he was afraid of what he might do. Lamb had two totally different personalities.

John Robinson, the governor of Essex County Jail, was then called by the defence. Robinson testified that during Lamb's time in the county jail, his conduct had been impeccable except for an incident five weeks before the trial, on 10 December 1966, when he had, for no apparent reason, gone on what Robinson called a "rampage".&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; In an episode lasting three hours, the defendant had smashed over 100 windows, set fire to blankets and broken plumbing, causing cells to flood. "I was amazed by what I saw," Robinson said. "The pupils were dilated like someone who comes in heavy on narcotics—except their eyes appear sunk in and his were bulged out."&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt;&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; George Scott of Kingston Penitentiary then told the court that Lamb lived in a fantasy dream world, which had existed in his mind since early childhood, and had been in a pre-psychotic state when released from jail on 8 June 1966. This, he said, had boiled over into an "acute [[Schizoid personality disorder|schizoid]] episode" on the night of the shootings.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; In cross-examination, Scott was pressed as to why he had allowed Lamb's release from Kingston if this was the case; he replied that although the prison officers had been concerned about Lamb's mental state on his release, there had not been conclusive grounds to certify him insane at that time.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt;

Three more psychiatrists from Penetanguishene were then called by Nosanchuk. George Darby told the court that in his conversations with Lamb the defendant had changed his story three times. He considered Lamb to be anti-social, aggressive and psychopathic—unable to appreciate the incident's consequences with any depth of feeling. Elliot Barker then testified that Lamb had told him in an interview that he treated all people "like bugs"&lt;ref name=nosanchuk8184/&gt; except for his uncle and grandmother; killing a human being, Barker told the court, meant nothing more to Lamb than swatting a fly. Barry Boyd then confirmed what Barker had said, and quoted something Lamb had told him in an interview: "I hate everybody on the street. I probably will kill someone else before I die—it doesn't bother me—it's like killing a bug."&lt;ref name=nosanchuk8184/&gt; Elizabeth Willet, a psychologist from the Penetanguishene unit, then testified that in her tests Lamb had indeed been revealed to have a high IQ, but had also been shown to have the emotional maturity of a small child, aged between 3 and 6. He had few [[defence mechanism]]s, she said, and when confronted by impulses acted them out almost without exception and without appreciating their consequences.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk8184"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nosanchuk
|1999
|pp=81–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Prosecution
Duchesne now called on Basil Orchard and Wilfred Boothroyd to counter the defence's evidence. Orchard, another doctor from Penetanguishene, testified that Lamb had suddenly abandoned any show of amnesia during an interview in August 1966. He saw no evidence that Lamb was insane and said that he was simply a young man with strong impulses who sometimes could not control them. Boothroyd, of [[Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre|Sunnybrook Hospital]] in Toronto, then spoke, arguing that Lamb had been acting out strong feelings of anger and bitterness and fully intended to kill the people he confronted, knowing and understanding what that meant. Lamb, he said, was capable of all kinds of emotion and was perfectly able to understand the nature of what he had done. Justice Stark intervened during Boothroyd's testimony, asking how he could give a reliable opinion on Lamb when he had never examined him. He also remarked that his opinion was contrary to every doctor who had testified so far.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk84"&gt;{{Harvnb

Nosanchuk gave his final statement to the court first. Speaking for the defence, he reminded the jury that every one of the doctors speaking on Lamb's behalf had originally been engaged by the state and that Yaworsky was the only one not employed in the public sector. He conceded that the defendant's actions were senseless and violent, but stressed that if found not guilty by reason of insanity, Lamb would stay in custody and could be kept in psychiatric care for the rest of his life if necessary. He argued that Lamb's actions on the evening of 25 June 1966 clearly made no sense and asked the jury to carefully consider them: the victims were not known to Lamb; Lamb made no attempt to disguise himself; Lamb acted alone; Lamb had nothing to gain from the act; Lamb inexplicably diverted his fire from the original group to a shadow in a doorway; Lamb then chose another house at random and threatened to kill the occupant, then left without doing anything; Lamb made no attempt to hide the weapon, leaving it in a nearby field where it would surely be found; then, finally, the boy simply went home to bed as if nothing had happened. Was this, Nosanchuk asked, the behaviour of a premeditated killer, or of a profoundly disturbed young man who did not appreciate what he was doing?&lt;ref name=nosanchuk8386/&gt;

In response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a "well-reasoned argument", which the jury paid rapt attention to.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk8687/&gt; Duchesne declared that the incident had been the cold, calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex-convict, released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti-social psychopath. The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne said that this was possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted should be enough to incur criminal responsibility, even taking the psychiatric evidence into account. Finding Lamb not guilty by reason of insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk8687/&gt;

===Verdict===
Justice Stark then reviewed the evidence and advised the jury that in his opinion the weight of psychiatric evidence favoured the defence; however, he reminded them, it was up to them to decide. The jury retired at 16:30 on 20 January 1967 to make their decision, and returned to the courtroom shortly before 19:00 to give their verdict. They found Lamb to be not guilty by reason of insanity. Lamb showed no reaction when the verdict was read.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt;&lt;ref name=nosanchuk8687/&gt;

As had been made clear several times before and during the trial, Lamb's court victory did not make him a free man. He was escorted by police back to Penetanguishene and placed in the hospital's maximum security unit at Oak Ridge, where he was to remain indefinitely pending an order from the Ontario Executive Council.&lt;ref name=aboutaman/&gt;

Elliot Barker, the head of Oak Ridge's therapeutic division,&lt;ref name=globeandmail10nov1976/&gt; had already interviewed Lamb in 1966 and spoken on his behalf at his trial.&lt;ref name=windsorstarreportoftrial/&gt; The doctor had arrived at Penetanguishene in 1959, and in 1965 stepped up his efforts to reform the unit's programmes, which on his arrival were still based around the traditional methods of [[Antipsychotic|neuroleptic]] tranquillisation and [[electroconvulsive therapy]], supplemented by long periods of isolation for each inmate. Barker innovated a programme whereby the patients could spend more of their time in each other's company, in a more natural environment; he believed that the key to overcoming these illnesses was communication. "My original vision," he writes, "was that I wasn't really dealing with patients. I thought we could evolve a social structure where people could resolve the internal conflicts in community."&lt;ref name=nielsen177180/&gt; Barker's "Social Therapy Unit" (STU), initially made up exclusively of young male psychopaths and schizophrenics of normal intelligence, began in September 1965, with a programme of 80 hours of treatment a week, focussing on cures brought about by mutual cooperation and interaction.&lt;ref name="nielsen177180"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nielsen
|2000
|pp=177–180}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joan Hollobon, the medical editor of the Toronto ''[[The Globe and Mail|Globe and Mail]]'', volunteered in 1967 to spend two days at Oak Ridge as if she were a patient, and afterwards heaped praise on the inmates, saying that they were "pioneering a brave and exciting experiment in self-government and self-therapy ... [displaying] individual responsibility, co-operation with colleagues and authority, and acceptance of rules reached by consensus."&lt;ref name="nielsen183"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nielsen
|2000
|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1968 the unit created a "Total Encounter Capsule", which was a windowless, soundproofed room, {{convert|8|ft}} wide and {{convert|10|ft}} long, with green-painted walls, a green wall-to-wall mat on the floor and a ceiling containing a [[one-way mirror]]. It was empty apart from a sink and lavatory. In one of the earliest uses of videotape in therapy, television cameras were trained through the mirrored ceiling and through holes in the walls. Liquid nourishment was provided through drinking straws that were built into the door. The Capsule's purpose, Barker writes, was to provide "a place of undisturbed security where a small group of patients could focus on issues they felt important enough to warrant the exclusion of the usual physical and psychological distractions."&lt;ref name=nielsen182/&gt; Though participation in the STU programme was required, entering the Capsule was voluntary, and each patient could choose how many days he spent inside.&lt;ref name=nielsen182/&gt; Groups numbered between two and seven and stayed in the room for as little as 24 hours or for sustained periods as long as 11 days.&lt;ref name="nielsen190"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nielsen
|2000
|p=190}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Barker believed that they were more inclined to reveal their inner selves if unclothed, the inmates entered the Capsule naked. To further encourage communication, they were administered with [[Lysergic acid diethylamide|LSD-25]]. The room was lit at all times, making day indistinguishable from night. While members of the programme were inside the Capsule, other patients operated the room and watched over those inside, running the cameras, keeping records and maintaining an appropriate room temperature.&lt;ref name="nielsen182"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nielsen

|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his arrival in January 1967, Lamb enthusiastically took part and thrived in Barker's new programmes, becoming, the Montreal ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|Gazette]]'' writes, "a model inmate".&lt;ref name="gazette10nov1976"&gt;{{Harvnb
|The Gazette
|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became widely respected by his fellow patients and was successfully nominated as the ward's "patient therapist". "He was helpful to the other patients," Barker told the ''Globe and Mail'', "and they looked up to him."&lt;ref name=globeandmail10nov1976/&gt; Barker elaborated on this subject in an interview with the ''Windsor Star'', telling them that during 1972 Lamb had been "one of the most respected therapists in the hospital".&lt;ref name=windsorstardeath2/&gt; Lamb started a newspaper at Oak Ridge, for which he wrote articles while also encouraging others to contribute.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk89"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nosanchuk
|1999
|p=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barker and his colleagues were so impressed by the young man's progress that they began to take him to lectures at [[Ontario Police College]] in [[Aylmer, Ontario|Aylmer]], where they introduced him as evidence of rehabilitation's potential.&lt;ref name=windsorstardeath2/&gt; After about five years at Oak Ridge, the matter of Lamb's liberty was taken up by a five-man Advisory Review Board made up of [[Ontario Superior Court of Justice|Ontario Supreme Court]] Justice Edson Haines, two independent psychiatrists unrelated to Lamb's case, a lawyer and a lay person.&lt;ref name="nosanchuk90"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Nosanchuk

|p=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The advisory board's recommendation that Lamb be released was approved by the Ontario Executive Council in early 1973; the board gave him a clean bill of health and said he was no longer dangerous.&lt;ref name=globeandmail10nov1976/&gt;

===Release and further improvement===

The conditions of Lamb's release were that he must spend a year living with the Barker family on their 200-acre (0.80&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;km; 0.31&amp;nbsp;sq&amp;nbsp;mi) farm, under the doctor's observation. The former inmate proved to be an industrious labourer, helping to fence the property and becoming one of the farm's best workers. Barker and his wife came to trust Lamb so closely that they allowed him to babysit their three-year-old daughter, who became very attached to the young man.&lt;ref name=ronson73/&gt; During his time living and working on the farm, Lamb read a number of books on psychiatry, including ''[[The Mask of Sanity]]'' by [[Hervey M. Cleckley]], which affected him particularly.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk90/&gt; He told the doctor that he had come to terms with his condition as a psychopath and that he wished to go overseas and do something purposeful with his life. At the same time, he considered a career in the military, which Barker supported.&lt;ref name=ronson73/&gt; "He wanted that kind of life," Barker later told the ''Globe and Mail''. "He really seemed to need the ''[[morale|esprit de corps]]'' of an army organisation."&lt;ref name=globeandmail10nov1976/&gt; When Egypt and Syria attacked Israel on 6 October 1973, starting the [[Yom Kippur War]], Lamb thought he had found his calling—using money he had saved from his labourer's salary and gifts from his grandmother, he bought [[State of Israel Bonds]] and, with Barker's encouragement, travelled to Israel to volunteer for the [[Israel Defense Forces]]. However, after hitch-hiking to the Israeli lines, Lamb became disillusioned by conversations he had with the soldiers there, many of whom were loath to fight and wanted to go home.&lt;ref name=nosanchuk90/&gt; He applied anyway, but was turned down because of his psychiatric history.&lt;ref name="ronson79"&gt;{{Harvnb

On his way to Australia in October 1973, Lamb stopped off in South Africa and [[Rhodesia]] (today Zimbabwe), where he cut his travels short to enlist in the [[Rhodesian Security Forces|Rhodesian Army]].&lt;ref name=gazette10nov1976/&gt;&lt;ref name="calgaryherald"&gt;{{Harvnb

|pp=1–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like most of the foreign volunteers in the Rhodesian forces, Lamb mustered into the [[Rhodesian Light Infantry]] (RLI), an all-white heliborne commando battalion engaged largely in counter-insurgency operations. He and the other foreign soldiers received the same pay and conditions of service as the Rhodesians they served alongside.&lt;ref name="binda186188"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Binda
|2008
|pp=186–188}}&lt;/ref&gt; "In many respects the RLI was a mirror of the [[French Foreign Legion]], in that recruiters paid little heed as to a man's past and asked no questions," writes Chris Cocks, a veteran of the unit, "and like the Foreign Legion, once in the ranks, a man's past was irrelevant."&lt;ref name=binda126/&gt; So it proved for Lamb; keeping his past a secret, he became a highly regarded and popular member of 3 Commando, RLI,&lt;ref name="binda126"&gt;{{Harvnb

Lamb visited his aunt and uncle in Windsor on leave in May 1975, "proudly wearing his uniform", journalist Tony Wanless writes.&lt;ref name=windsorstardeath2/&gt; Turned out in the RLI's tartan green ceremonial dress and [[green beret]],&lt;ref name="binda34and48"&gt;{{Harvnb

|pp=34, 48}}&lt;/ref&gt; he was conspicuous walking along [[Ouellette Avenue]], one of the city's main thoroughfares. Coincidentally, a funeral procession was being held for Edith Chaykoski's grandmother along that very street at the same time, leading Edith's younger brother Richard to spot Lamb on the pavement. The soldier remained oblivious, but his presence horrified the Chaykoski family. "He had the uniform and looked a little different," Richard told the ''Windsor Star'' a year later, "but I never forgot his face."&lt;ref name=meankid/&gt; Chaykoski's mother was so upset by the incident that for some time afterwards she refused to leave the house alone.&lt;ref name="meankid"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Wanless
|11 November 1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; While staying with the Hesketh family, Lamb went to see Barker and told him that serving in the Rhodesian security forces had enriched him personally and made him respect himself for the first time. Because of this he wished to forget about his previous life in Canada; in particular he said he "didn't want it associated with his adopted country".&lt;ref name=globeandmail10nov1976/&gt; He expressed his concern that if he were killed or captured, the Canadian press might reveal his prior history and embarrass the Rhodesian Army, the Canadian government and the Penetanguishene mental hospital. However, he said, he felt great loyalty towards Rhodesia and would still go back to continue his service.&lt;ref name="globeandmail10nov1976"&gt;{{Harvnb
|Bruner
|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lamb was deeply saddened by the bias he perceived the Western media to have against the Rhodesian government and army, but was reportedly conspicuous for leaping to the defence of any black Rhodesians he thought were receiving bad treatment. "He sympathised with the blacks," Barker told the ''Windsor Star'', "but believed that chaos would result if they took over immediately. He used to scrap with other soldiers who treated blacks badly. He was very bright and knew the blacks would eventually take over the country."&lt;ref name=windsorstardeath2/&gt;

Soon after his furlough to Canada, Lamb was transferred from the RLI to the elite [[Rhodesian Special Air Service|Special Air Service]] (SAS) unit in September 1975.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; There he trained as a paratrooper and, after passing selection, found himself in a vastly different role to the one he had become used to during his time in the RLI. Rather than taking part in the RLI's fast and furious [[Fireforce]] counter-strike procedures, he found himself taking part in covert reconnaissance actions, "acting as eyes and ears," as Barbara Cole writes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|Cole
|2000
|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wishing to see more action, Lamb requested a posting back to the RLI, which was granted; he rejoined 3 Commando.&lt;ref name="association"&gt;{{Harvnb
|RLI Regimental Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1976, at the age of 28, he was promoted to [[Lance corporal|lance-corporal]] and took command of a "stick" of four men from 12 Troop, 3 Commando on Fireforce duty on Operation ''Thrasher'', which covered Rhodesia's eastern highlands against guerrilla activity.&lt;ref name="binda198"&gt;{{Harvnb

In the late afternoon of 7 November 1976, three insurgents from a group of seven were spotted by an Army observation post in the Mutema Tribal Trust Lands, just south-west of [[Birchenough Bridge]] in [[Manicaland]] province. Fireforce was called up and the Rhodesians readied themselves to fly out by helicopter and engage the guerrillas.&lt;ref name=binda198/&gt; There were eight four-man "stops" involved in a Fireforce, and on this occasion Lamb headed Stop 2. Just before they left, Lamb ran over to Lance-Corporal Phil Kaye, the leader of Stop 3, and shouted over the noise of the aircraft. "They are going to get me this time," he yelled, sardonically; "Just you watch, Phil Kaye!"&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; Kaye and his [[FN MAG|MAG]] gunner, Trooper Pat Grogan, waved away this comment and told Lamb to get moving. "Go nail [[gook]]s!"&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; Kaye called after Lamb as he and the rest of Stop 2 took off aboard their [[Aérospatiale Alouette III|Alouette III]] gunship. Lamb's men were an 18-year-old [[national service]] MAG gunner of Portuguese-Rhodesian extraction named Trooper Soares; Trooper Cornelius Olivier, a 20-year-old Rhodesian regular who carried an [[FN FAL]] battle rifle; and Trooper Tony Rok, an Australian [[Vietnam veteran]], aged 28 and also equipped with an FN. Lamb carried the stick's radio on his back with his FN FAL ready in his hands.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;

Stop 2 landed, formed up into a sweep line and marched carefully to the north alongside a dry riverbed. As darkness fell, just as they came to a widening in the riverbed, they were suddenly fired upon by an unseen foe. All four men dropped to the ground to avoid being hit. The Canadian lance-corporal called for covering fire from Soares, which he provided as Lamb and Rok rose to their feet and cautiously moved forward. A dark figure suddenly ran across the soldiers' line of sight, between Lamb and the riverbed, and from a distance of about 16 paces Olivier reflexively swung his rifle around and let off a frenzied, imprecise burst of fire. Mortally wounded by two errant shots through the chest, Lamb stumbled, slumped to the ground and lay face-down in a heap. One of the bullets exited through the back of his body, smashing the radio he had been carrying. He died almost instantly. Meanwhile, the [[Professional revolutionaries|cadres]] ahead ran headlong into Stop 1, led by Sergeant Derrick Taylor, and were all killed in the ensuing fire fight. Taylor's stick sustained no casualties. When the battle was over, Stops 1 and 3 joined Olivier, Rok and Soares and waited beside Lamb's lifeless body all night until it could be evacuated by helicopter to the local hospital at [[Chipinge District|Chipinga]].&lt;ref name=binda198/&gt; The death was officially recorded as "[[killed in action]]", with no reference to [[friendly fire]].&lt;ref name="binda527"&gt;{{Harvnb

==Reactions to death; military funeral and burial==
{{Quote box|align=right|width=33%|quote=... his comrades gave him a hero's funeral.

As Lamb had predicted, his death provoked stories in the Canadian local and national media that strongly stressed his history of violence and insanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb

|1976}}&lt;/ref&gt; It even caused a heated debate in the Canadian [[House of Commons of Canada|House of Commons]] over why, considering his personal history in Ontario and subsequent service in the armed forces of a country Canada did not recognise, Lamb had been issued a valid [[Canadian passport]] and allowed to renew it on 26 April 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb
|House of Commons of Canada

In Rhodesia, by contrast, Lamb was posthumously held in very high regard by the men who had served alongside him. His photograph in full dress uniform was placed on 3 Commando's Wall of Honour and remained there until the RLI was disbanded in 1980.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt; When the story of his earlier life in Canada was run by the ''[[The Herald (Zimbabwe)|Rhodesia Herald]]'', the paper received numerous strongly worded letters from soldiers who refused to believe it. They demanded a printed retraction and apology, which the ''Herald'' gave soon after to preempt any further scandal.&lt;ref name="newsweek"&gt;{{Harvnb

No members of his family were present. His coffin, draped in [[Flag of Rhodesia|the Rhodesian flag]] and topped with a large bouquet of flowers, was carried on a [[Limbers and caissons|gun carriage]] to Warren Hills Cemetery, on the western outskirts of the city, where soldiers of the RLI fired three volleys of shots and senior officers saluted as the coffin was carried to the crematorium on the shoulders of eight RLI men.&lt;ref name=newsweek/&gt; Lamb's ashes were afterwards returned to his relatives in Windsor, Ontario, where they were buried alongside the remains of his grandmother.&lt;ref name=hughes/&gt;&lt;ref name="leaderpost2"&gt;{{Harvnb

'''Matt Clark''' is a fictional character from the American [[CBS]] soap opera ''[[The Young and the Restless]]''. The role was originated by [[Eddie Cibrian]] in May 1994, who left the show in 1996. After Russell Lawrence briefly playing the character in 2000, [[Rick Hearst]] took over the role that year, departing in 2001 after the character was killed off. Hearst returned for several appearances as an apparition. Matt was known as an antagonistic villain who created problems for [[Nick and Sharon|Nick and Sharon Newman]], beginning when they were teens in high school. He raped both [[Sharon Newman|Sharon Collins]] and [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Amy Wilson|Amy Wilson]], and framed [[Nicholas Newman]] for multiple crimes.

==Casting and characterization==
[[File:RickHearst cropped.jpg|thumb|150px|upright|left|[[Rick Hearst]] played Matt Clark from 2000 to 2001.]]
[[Eddie Cibrian]] was hired to portray recurring character Matt Clark in May 1994. In October of that year, he signed a three-year contract with the series.&lt;ref name="Star-News" /&gt; Cibrian said that he believed the writers "were going to turn the story into something bigger" and wanted to keep it going.&lt;ref name="Star-News" /&gt; The character exited in 1996 after nearly three years. Russell Lawrence became the next actor in the role, portraying Matt in 2000.&lt;ref name="Times1" /&gt; However, he was replaced a few months later with [[Rick Hearst]] who debuted in October 2000. Hearst was familiar with the soap opera genre, having played [[Alan-Michael Spaulding]] on ''[[Guiding Light]]'' for several years prior. ''[[TimesDaily]]'' wrote: "Expect the storyline of the vengeful Matt to be stepped up with Hearst in the role".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Toby|title=Soaps make important additions|journal=[[TimesDaily]]|date=October 27, 2000|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=20001027&amp;id=WnAeAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=X8kEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5851,3659601&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 30, 2015|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]|location=Florence, Alabama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cibrian found the role challenging and said: "Unfortunately there are people in the world like Matt. That’s why they put this in the script, so people could be aware."&lt;ref name="Star-News" /&gt;

==Storylines==
As a high school senior in 1994, Matt Clark dates Sharon Collins and develops a bitter rivalry with [[Nicholas Newman]] ([[Joshua Morrow]]) who ends up winning Sharon from him. A fight between Matt and Nick results in Nick being badly beaten. Shortly thereafter, Matt rapes Sharon, causing her to sink into a depression. Matt then dates [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Amy Wilson|Amy Wilson]] ([[Julianne Morris]]), Sharon's best friend. Reacting to Nick and Sharon becoming king and queen of their high school Polynesian dance, Matt exposes Sharon's secret: that she is not a virgin, and had given up a baby for adoption when she was 16. While Nick is briefly angry at Sharon, he forgives her and the pair become engaged. After Sharon confesses to Nick that Matt raped her, just prior to their planned wedding, Nick goes after Matt, but instead finds him lying in a pool of blood on his apartment floor, having been shot. Nick is arrested, while Matt survives and falsely claims that Nick shot him. After a trial, Nick is found guilty and sentenced to 15 years in prison. Nick's father [[Victor Newman]] ([[Eric Braeden]]) tracks down Amy in a mental institution, who has been suffering from [[PTSD]]. Amy reveals that she was the person who shot Matt after he raped her. Nick is acquitted and Matt leaves town in 1996.&lt;ref name="Storyline"&gt;{{cite web|title=Revenge: Matt Clark|url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/plots-blog/1000489/|website=[[CBS.com]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=April 5, 2015|archiveurl=http://www.freezepage.com/1428240620VWYFROIBJH?url=http://www.cbs.com/shows/the_young_and_the_restless/plots-blog/1000489/|archivedate=April 5, 2015|date=March 25, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, Matt Clark surfaces in town under the alias of Carter Mills, having had plastic surgery to change his appearance, and begins working at Nick and Sharon's coffeehouse. Carter uses [[The Young and the Restless characters (1990s)#Tricia Dennison|Tricia Dennison]] ([[Sabryn Genet]]), a woman he slept with, to frame Nick for selling drugs. Sharon grows close with Carter while Nick is in jail. Carter nearly succeeds in raping Sharon by using a [[date rape]] drug, but Nick arrives home and his plans are thwarted. [[Paul Williams (character)|Paul Williams]] ([[Doug Davidson]]) begins searching for Matt Clark, realizing that he may have had plastic surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Soaps|journal=[[The Item]]|date=April 6, 2001|page=9|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1980&amp;dat=20010406&amp;id=XE4wAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=C6oFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6414,1393628&amp;hl=en|accessdate=April 5, 2015|publisher=Osteen Publishing Co.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carter later meets Sharon at a cabin in the woods and tries to rape her there, but is stopped when Victor arrives. Tricia drives off with Carter in her car but deliberately drives off a cliff in an attempt to kill them both. While Tricia survives the crash, Carter had fatal injuries. Carter pulls out his own breathing tube, killing himself, and framing Nick for his murder. Nick is implicated in Carter's murder, but is ultimately found not guilty.&lt;ref name="Global" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Storyline" /&gt;

Just before Matt's death, he lied to Nick, telling him that he had raped Sharon. Sharon becomes pregnant, and Nick demands a paternity test, which she refuses (not wanting to harm the child). After a fight with Nick, Sharon runs after him and trips over a chair. The fall causes her to give birth prematurely to a stillborn baby. A paternity test confirmed that Nick was the father, not Matt.

==Reception==
Both Cibrian and Hearst became popular for their portrayals of Matt.&lt;ref name="Xfinity"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bibel|first1=Sara|title=Deep Soap: Power Plays|url=http://xfinity.comcast.net/blogs/tv/2009/07/27/deep-soap-power-plays/|website=[[Xfinity]]|publisher=[[Comcast Corporation]]|accessdate=April 5, 2015|date=July 27, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, soap opera journalist Seli Groves of ''[[The Beaver County Times]]'' newspaper opined that it was likely for Matt to return one day, writing that "characters with this sort of seething history are often recalled from soap limbo". A message published in the newspaper by a viewer named Andrea P. described the character of Matt as "a real rat", but with the observation that Cibrian "played it so well".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Groves|first1=Seli|title=Speaking of Soaps|journal=[[The Beaver County Times]]|date=September 8, 1996|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2002&amp;dat=19960908&amp;id=P5JUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=YTsNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5056,1863203&amp;hl=en|accessdate=March 31, 2015|publisher=[[Calkins Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Lawrence was cast in the role, Toby Goldstein of ''[[TimesDaily]]'' noted that Matt was "likely to bring misery to Nick and Sharon's lives".&lt;ref name="Times1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldstein|first1=Toby|title=Lots of fresh faces around time|journal=[[TimesDaily]]|date=July 14, 2000|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1842&amp;dat=20000714&amp;id=fmseAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZskEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4140,1769583&amp;hl=en|accessdate=April 5, 2015|publisher=[[Tribune Media Services]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Global Television Network|Global TV]]'s Aaron Hagey-MacKay included the character's death on a list of the "Top drunken, brutal, mysterious and volcanic deaths of Y&amp;R".&lt;ref name="Global"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagey-MacKay|first1=Aaron|title=Top drunken, brutal, mysterious and volcanic deaths of Y&amp;R|url=http://www.globaltv.com/theyoungandtherestless/latest/top-drunken-brutal-mysterious-and-volcanic-deaths-of-yr/|website=[[Global Television Network]]|publisher=[[Shaw Media]]|accessdate=April 5, 2015|date=September 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' called Matt an "evil rapist",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carter|first1=Alan|title=Who'll win Daytime Emmy Awards?|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2002/05/15/wholl-win-daytime-emmy-awards|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|publisher=[[Time Inc.]]|accessdate=April 5, 2015|date=May 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; while Sara Bibel of [[Comcast|Xfinity]] argued in 2009 that the character was written out due to being a rapist, stating that the soap opera was "the one show with a zero tolerance for sexual assault".&lt;ref name="Xfinity" /&gt;

'''Mend-Ooyo Gombojav''' is a Mongolian writer, poet and calligraphist. He was born into a herder's family in [[Dariganga, Sükhbaatar]], [[Mongolia]], in 1952. Mend-Ooyo lives in [[Ulaanbaatar]], Mongolia, and directs the Mongolian Academy of Culture and Poetry.

Mend-Ooyo is quoted saying: "My life is the mirror of Mongolia. I grew up in the classic nomadic way of life, then moved to the city. But even after all these years I am not a city person. All my dreams are about the countryside, and I feel like I am living in a birdcage. Now I am planning to move back to the countryside. I just hope Mongolia will too."&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt;

== Career ==
He started his career&lt;ref name="Mend-Ooyo" /&gt; in 1970, as an elementary school teacher in the border village of Zamiin Uud, Dornogovi aimag, in the far south east of Mongolia. For ten years, from 1978, he was the editor-in-chief for the arts and cultural programmes on Mongolian State radio and television, In 1988 he became a professional writer with the Mongolian Writer's Union.

After the [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia]], Mend-Ooyo became the Chief Project Lead and driving force behind the reconstruction of the [[Migjid Janraisig]] complex at [[Gandantegchinlen Monastery]] in [[Ulaanbaatar]]. At that time he was also a member of the Mongolian National Committee of UNESCO, and, successively, executive director, vice-president and president of the Mongolian Cultural Foundation. From 1998-2000 he sat as Chairman of the governmental Culture and Arts Agency.

In 2002 he became Life member of the World Academy of Arts and Culture. In 2004 he joined the board of the Mongolian Art Council.&lt;ref name="ACM" /&gt; In 2005 he founded the Mongolian culture, literature and poetry magazine ''GUNU'',&lt;ref name="GUNU" /&gt; for which he also acted as the editor-in-chief. In that same year he became president of the Mongolian Academy of Culture and Poetry.&lt;ref name="MACP" /&gt; In 2006 he became the President of the 26th World Congress of Poets in Mongolia. He joined in fellow residency program in Civitella Ranieri Foundation in 2014, and also led the World Poetry Days in Mongolia in 2017.

In 1996, Mend-Ooyo earned a Master's degree at the University of Arts and Culture in Mongolia. In 2002, he was granted a Doctorate of Literature by the World Academy of Arts and Culture.&lt;ref name="WAAC" /&gt; In 2008, he became professor of Arts and Culture at the Institute of International Studies of the [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]]. In 2015, the University of Arts and Culture, Mongolia granted him Honorary doctor for his achievement in literature.

== Poetry ==
Mend-Ooyo started writing poems at the age of thirteen. In an interview for the WSJ he explains he became interested in writing, thanks in part to Dorjiin Gombojav. D.Gombojav was a controversial poet and translator who had alienated officials in Ulaanbaatar. He was sent, as punishment, to teach at the remote rural school Mend-Ooyo attended. Mend-Ooyo related to the interviewer that he wrote his first lines of poetry under D.Gombojav’s guidance. "He taught me the importance of Mongolian language and our traditions," he says.&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt;

In the late 1970s, he was one of the founder members of the underground literary group GAL (''Fire'').&lt;ref name="GAL" /&gt; Mend-Ooyo explained that at the time, communist censors wouldn’t let groups meet. "They were always watching us, so we had to be very careful and meet in people's homes at night."&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt; The GAL group, active in the late 1970s and early 1980s, included mainly Mend-Ooyo, [[Ochirbatyn Dashbalbar]] and D.Nyamsüren. Though GAL was "organised around the so-called Dariganga Three", others were at times involved as well.&lt;ref name="GALHurelbaatar" /&gt; According to Simon Wickham-Smith, they "came to dominate the poetry scene during the subsequent ten or fifteen years, and their work is vital for a proper understanding of recent literary history in Mongolia."&lt;ref name="GALsws" /&gt;

GAL transformed during the 1980s into an "independent flow of literary writing called ''GUNU''",&lt;ref name="GALHurelbaatar" /&gt; whose writers "nowadays exercise(s) the greatest influence on Mongolian literature."&lt;ref name="GALHurelbaatar" /&gt;

In the 1980s, Mend-Ooyo  was allowed to publish some of his poetry after it was vetted by officials.&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt; Later, in 1988, Mend-Ooyo became a member of the Mongolian Writers' Union.&lt;ref name="MWUmem" /&gt;

In 1980, he published his first book of poetry, ''The Bird of Thought''. Many were to follow. After the [[1990 Democratic Revolution in Mongolia]] and the end of single-party communist rule, he started to publish more of his work, "including the writing that espoused his pastoral roots and eventually became his best-known poems."&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt; Since his first book, he has published over twenty other books of poetry, and over a dozen novels and children's books.

''Altan Ovoo'' (''Golden Hill'') is an ongoing work of poetic fiction that has become one of the most influential pieces of contemporary Mongolian literature. First published in 1993, its fifth edition was published in 2010. ''Altan Ovoo'' has been translated into English by Simon Wickham-Smith in 2007.&lt;ref name="AltanOvoo" /&gt; According to Wickham-Smith, Mend-Ooyo has referred to this book as his most important work. Mend-Ooyo constantly rearranges and edits "the elements of the narrative, to such an extent that it seems sometimes to be more an experimental novel (à la B.S. Johnson perhaps) than a work by a romantic and deeply traditional Central Asian writer," explains Wickham-Smith.

''Altan Ovoo'' has been the focus of Simon Wickham-Smith's Ph.D. dissertation at the University of Washington. He explains that "Mend-Ooyo's poetic novel ''Altan Ovoo'' offers a vision of nomadic literature based as much on the history and worldview of Mongol nomadic herders as on the late twentieth century Mongolia, poised between Soviet-influenced socialism and Euro-American democratic capitalism, in which it was written."  In his dissertation, Wickham-Smith presents "''Altan Ovoo'' as a prism through which the ideas on which nomadic culture is based can be shown as being central to the self-image of Mongolia's people, both in relation to the past and to the future."&lt;ref name="SWSdiss" /&gt;

''Gegeenten'' (''The Holy One''), published in 2012,&lt;ref name="Gegeenten" /&gt; is a modern example of the traditional Mongolian genre of [[namtar]], non-canonical biographies of Buddhist saints intended to be read by common people.&lt;ref name="PIAC57" /&gt; Mend-Ooyo explains that ''Gegeenten'' tells the story of the Noton Hutagt [[Dulduityn Danzanravjaa]]. It tells "of his realisation of, and how he expressed, the secret wisdom in the teaching and practise of the historical Buddha and his descendents."&lt;ref name="GBlurb" /&gt; The story, according to the writer, "also reveals how Danzanravjaa's life speaks to Mongol intellectual culture and the nomadic tradition of the Gobi area in which he lived, and how this tradition is an expression of the land and the environment in which he lived." According to Maria Petrova,&lt;ref name="MPetrova" /&gt; ''Gegeenten'' "can be called the first prose work, where the image of the great Gobi Noenkhutukhta (sic) and poet D.Ravzhi (sic) found artistic expression."&lt;ref name="PIAC57" /&gt;

In addition to his poetry and his novels, Mend-Ooyo has also written over half a dozen research books, with topics ranging from Old Mongol script to poetry critiques, Dariganga folklore and consumer culture amongst the Mongolian nomads.

Mend-Ooyo's work has been translated into over thirty languages, including English, Japanese, Hungarian, Russian, Chinese, Dutch, German and French.

Mend-Ooyo writes his poetry by hand. He tried to write his poetry on the computer. He says of this experience: "It was amazing how easy and peaceful it was to erase what I had written, to begin again, to change words and to rearrange them, and to adjust the rhythm of a poem. When I had finished my poem, I printed it out. I read it. The spirit with which I had been born was missing, there was no mental engagement in it."&lt;ref name="3S2" /&gt; And: "I understood that my manuscript was the soul of my poem, the source of its spiritual power. A writer's manuscript is the calligraphy which shows the unrepeatable beating of their heart, the pathway through their warm life."&lt;ref name="3S2" /&gt;

== Awards ==
Mend-Ooyo has been awarded many prizes from literary organizations around the world. Most notably, he has been named Distinguished cultural figure of Mongolia, by decree of the President of Mongolia in 1996; received the Award of the Mongolian Writers' Union in 1999; and was named Best Man of the Year 2001, and honoured as one of the nine most renowned people in Mongolia. In 2001, Mend-Ooyo was awarded the ''Altan Ud'' (''Golden Feather'') award, Mongolia's Writer of the Year.&lt;ref name="AD2001" /&gt; In 2006, the year of the 800th Anniversary of Great Mongolian Empire, Mend-Ooyo was awarded the Anniversary medal by the President of Mongolia.

In 2014, Mend-Ooyo was artist in residence at the Civitella Ranieri Foundation in Umbria, Italy.&lt;ref name="CivRan" /&gt;

== Calligraphy ==

While his fame is mainly based on his poetry, Mend-Ooyo has also found acclaim as a calligrapher, specialising in traditional [[Mongolian calligraphy]]. His work has been exhibited in Mongolia in the ''Poetry and Calligraphy'' exhibition in Ulaanbaatar in 2006; the 2007 ''Coming Time'' poetry and calligraphy exhibition in the Zanabazar Museum in Ulaanbaatar; the 2010 ''Crystal Temple of Mend-Ooyo’s soul'' poetry and calligraphy exhibition in the Mongolian Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar, opened by the Mongolian President [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]].

In 2011, the ''Дэлхий ээж'' (''Delhii eej'': ''Earth Mother'', ''Mother Earth'', or ''World Mother'') poetry and calligraphy exhibition was held in the Mongolian Modern Art Gallery in Ulaanbaatar, in collaboration with another calligrapher, D.Battömör. Before setting out creating some sixty calligraphies, Battömör first read two of Mend-Ooyo's (''All Shining Moments'' and ''A Patch of White Mist'') for inspiration. Together they choose the calligraphies they thought best expressed in calligraphic form Mend-Ooyo's verse. The poems were then written into the calligraphies in manuscript (as opposed to draw them with a brush). Afterwards, Battömör and Mend-Ooyo stamped their seals on these calligraphies.&lt;ref name="3S2" /&gt; This exhibition traveled to Japan in 2012, where it showed at the [[Kyoritsu Women's University]] in Tokyo.&lt;ref name="KWU" /&gt;

In 2012, Mend-Ooyo showed his calligraphy in ''The Steppe'' calligraphy exhibition at the Art House Center in Ulaanbaatar.

Also in 2012, fourteen of his calligraphy works, curated by S.Sumiya&lt;ref name="Sumiya" /&gt; were exhibited in the Museum Café of the [[Allard Pierson Museum]] in [[Amsterdam]], The [[Netherlands]] during a Mongolia Festival which was held against the backdrop of the museum exhibition ''Horse &amp; Rider - From Homer to Genghis Khan''.&lt;ref name="APM" /&gt;

In 2014, Mend-Ooyo participated in the joint calligraphy exhibition ''Sky, Sun and Partnership'', held at the Blue Moon Art Gallery, in celebration of the 40th anniversary of Mongolian-Japanese cultural relations. The line-up of artists included public figures such as the Mongolian President [[Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj]], then Mongolian Prime Minister [[Norovyn Altankhuyag]] and the Japanese Prime Minister [[Shinzō Abe]].&lt;ref name="SSP" /&gt; The ''Sky, Sun, Partnership'' exhibition traveled to Japan in March, 2015. Mend-Ooyo opened the exhibition, which was held at the Itochu Aoyama Art Square.&lt;ref name="SSP2" /&gt; Some of the exhibited pieces were to be auctioned for charity, the proceeds donated to volunteer groups to support the recovery of the area affected by the 2011 [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Great East Japan earthquake]].&lt;ref name="SSP2a" /&gt;

== Themes in Mend-Ooyo's poetry ==
Mend-Ooyo's writing deals with the life of Mongolia's nomadic herders, their culture and cultural knowledge. In his style and thematic material, he seeks to express the melody and richness of the Mongol language and nomadic society.

Mend-Ooyo explains his work in his short essay ''My Gentle Lyric''&lt;ref name="GentleLyric" /&gt; - translated by S.Sumiya&lt;ref name="Sumiya" /&gt; - thus: "I have long been absorbed by the fundamental nature of my nomadic ancestors, believing in them, favouring and cherishing their quiet, gentle melody. The gentle melody is the nature of my poetry. The wheels of the wooden cart which turn without harming the grass, the quiet character of the elders who avoid stepping on the flowers, the trust of the nomads who have no locks on their doors... it seems that the short road to purity lies here."

As the poet [[Ruth O'Callaghan]] explains in her foreword to Mend-Ooyo's book of poetry ''A Patch of White Mist''&lt;ref name="WhiteMist" /&gt; Mend-Oyoo's poetry is rooted in his Mongolian heritage. According to O'Callaghan, Mend-Ooyo "engages us not only with a superb lyricism but also a profound philosophy" based in Buddhism. Where most people would settle for a philosophy that fits easily and neatly in this modern world, Mend-Ooyo courageously "continues on his quest to discover his own unique position [...] for his existence," in the process crossing impossible boundaries. Mend-Ooyo's philosophy - as he words it in his poetry - is fuelled by Buddhism. Meditation stokes in him a deep empathy with the whole of creation. This profound life-long involvement with Buddhism is the source of Mend-Ooyo's strength; a strength that "an urgency to Mend-Ooyo's poetry in his chronicling of his pursuit of selfhood that is so lucidly and lyrically expressed."

Born into a herdsman's family in [[Dariganga, Sükhbaatar]], [[Mongolia]], in 1952, Mend-Ooyo grew up riding horses and tending sheep, moving over the steppe by camel caravan. Today, he leads a life very different from his childhood, moving across the world by air plane, his mobile phone constantly ringing and his office in Ulaanbaatar crowded by many Mongolian and foreign visitors. Yet, his heart remains faithful to the old ways of the steppe. Despite his achievements, Mend-Ooyo's is acutely aware that "to leave behind one's heritage is to court disaster."

O'Callaghan explains that Mend-Ooyo's poetry weaves a rich tapestry that will live long in the mind of the Western reader. Mend-Ooyo explores the intimate connection between "the personal and the universal." He expresses himself with delicate perception and a gift for language. Western readers will be excited to find that Mend-Ooyo's poetry offers an "informative, introductory insight into the Mongolian psyche – a psyche which embraces the topography not simply of Mongolia or even the universe but of the world beyond this world, an 'otherness' which travels with the poet as surely as his nomadic ancestors."

Simon Wickham-Smith - translator and currently a lecturer at Rutgers University in New Jersey, USA - in his foreword to Mend-Ooyo's children's book ''Quickwit The Camel'',&lt;ref name="Quickwit" /&gt; explains Mend-Ooyo's philosophy as the expression of the "profound relationship between Mongolians and the landscape of their country, its physical and historical contours, its spiritual and cultural traditions and, most importantly perhaps, its visionary pathways." He continues to explain that for Mongolians, their landscape is their ancestors. Especially in his book ''Golden Hill'' does Mend-Ooyo present - both in poetry and in prose - an admixture of dream, myth, cultural and social history, memoir, (auto)biography, and natural history.

In an interview Simon Wickham-Smith says: "The idea of traditional Mongolian culture is paramount to Mend-Ooyo. He is trying to keep the nomadic spirit alive in spite of modernization" He adds "Mr. Mend-Ooyo is arguably the most important poet in Mongolia today, and certainly the one with the most presence, though some of the newer generation might say he is a bit stuck in the past."&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt;

In the same article for the WSJ, Bavuudorj Tsogdorj,&lt;ref name="MWUmem" /&gt; 43 years old and an exponent of the younger generation of Mongolian poets, expresses his believe that "his increasingly urbanized countrymen will eventually appreciate their nomadic tradition." He continues: "Younger poets are now writing with European thoughts and styles, but they will come back to Mongolian poetry and thoughts someday. At that time Mend-Ooyo will be really valuable." He adds: "Mend-Ooyo is Mongolia’s poetry representative — he is a genuine nomadic poet."&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt;

Today, Mend-Ooyo puts his energy into rethinking the modern Mongolian way of life. In an interview he explains that "he envisions a 21st-century nomadic community in which schools, health care and markets move with the people, allowing them to maintain their mobility while providing some of the benefits of contemporary society." As he says it: "It's my dream to build it." And: "The reason nomads come to the cities is to get education for their children, hospital access. We want to allow nomads to be more modern, to use cellphones and Internet. Keep the old life, just make it better."&lt;ref name="WSJb" /&gt;

== Opinions and Comments ==
“''Mend-Ooyo is an artist, full of good deeds, spreading the best of Mongolian culture and customs to the public nationally and internationally as his fame echoes not only across Mongolia but also beyond our borders.''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Mongolian President Elbegdorj Tsakhia’s speech at the order of Chinghis Khaan award ceremony. 2015.11.12&lt;/sub&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''Gombojav dispune de darul meditaţiei versulsău stậrneşte cititorul, il pune pe ganduri, transmitandu-i propriile trairi passionale, intr-o comuniune intima cu elementele primordial ale naturii, cu insasi viata, intr-un registru lucid, calm, dar profubd emotional.''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Anthologia poeziei universal de astazi, Editura EUROPA Craiova, Romania. 2014  ISBN (10)978-973-1874-01-2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''It is a poetry that starts from a concrete fact and transforms into a timeless art. The elements that compose it stop having a date, lose their significance and become symbols that recover the imagination as a temperature and fruity sensation of life, forging itself with its most intense expression. It is time without intermediaries through which we arrive at the presence of the unknown, to the true mystery of poetry where the end resembles the beginning. This present never happens in a linear time even if it seems so. It opens a path in space, makes the immensity navigable. That is why I love the meaning of his verbal prayer, that hidden power he has of returning to the everyday, to the rumor of his words, to that innocent smile of his poetic voice where everything remains insinuated, confessed, said.''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Justo Jorge Padron, Spanish poet. “Mend-ooyo, el gran poeta contemporáneo de Mongolia” suplemento de  caudernos del matemático n° 50, ISSN 1132-2403, Madrid. 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;“''"The Holy One" (Gegeenten) is a most impressive and skilfully-written literary novel, free from any petty constraints, and as close to a true account as we have had during the last hundred years of culture and history. In today's world we have the freedom to write pieces which show how wisdom and behavior are connected, such as an elite writer like Mend-Oyoo does by examining and revealing the facts and scholarship, and by unpacking the rumors and the history, and this most striking of works has indeed reached such a level.”''&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''Prof.Dr.Ch.Biligsaihan Literary critic, Unuudur, newspaper, 10.10.2012''&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''More than any other extended piece of contemporary Mongolian literature, G Mend-Ooyo’s Altan Ovoo (Golden Hill) expresses the profound relationship between Mongolians and the landscape of their country, its physical and historical contours, its spiritual and cultural traditions and, most importantly perhaps, its visionary pathways.  For Mongolians, their landscape is their ancestors, and Altan Ovoo (Golden Hill) presents in poetry and prose an admixture of dream, myth, history (cultural and social), memoir, auto/biography, and natural history.''
	He is constantly rearranging and editing the elements of the narrative, to such an extent that it seems sometimes to be more an experimental novel (à la B S Johnson perhaps) than a work by a romantic and deeply traditional Central Asian writer.''”''&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr.Simon Wickham-Smith /UK/ Translator and scholar of Mongolian lliterature
“Translator’s introduction” Golden Hill, 2007, p xi&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''In the centre of the image system is the Altan Ovoo – mythical world mountain Sumeru, which connects Earth and Sky, upper, middle and lower worlds. The coexistence of secular and sacral worlds, the union of real and mythical spheres, poetical style, the usage of prose and poetry give the work by G.Mend-Ooyo mystical enchantment. This was also noted by Mongolian and European readers and literary critics. To my mind, modern presentation of traditional legends and ballades by G.Mend-Ooyo is a conscious author’s position. It demonstrates creative usage of folklore in Modern Mongolian literature.''”&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr. Petrova M.P scholar of Mongolian study  /Saint-Petersburg State University, Russia/ Old Legends in Modern Literature: Mystical Enchantment of G.Mend-Ooyo’s Works.

Your Poem “I am coming to you” is Super, a Millennium Poem.''”  &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr. Krishna Srinivas. Founder of World Congress of Poets, President of World Poetry Society, Founder and Editor-in-chief of POET magazine&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''I would like to add that I consider you to be a poet of the first order. Your poem “I am coming to You” thrilled my heart and soul. You are “seeking for the eternal song the essence of love.” You are not only a poet but also a genuine seeker of the highest Truth. I do hope that we may one day meet together in your beloved Mongolia. Mend-Ooyo is a profoundly spiritual seer-poet. His mantric poems immediately transport the readers into the Heart of Eternity’s Infinity.''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Sri Chinmoy. Poet, Composer, Painter, and Perfect Enlightener. “Poetry – A Heaven Climbing Song, lecture” 15p, 2007&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''There is an evident explosion in the images and in the lyricism of an encased world, a recovery of terrestrial love with that added and confronted duality: that of tenderness and absence. His gaze sees man in time, disguised at times by simple simplicity, always has the strength of the humble and the magnitude of the true and essential. Sometimes it has a point of hallucination, silence, revelation and prophecy that knows very well the loneliness of man, turning the question into destiny and destiny into a question that teaches us to interrogate.''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Justo Jorge Padron, Spanish poet. “Mend-ooyo, el gran poeta contemporáneo de Mongolia” suplemento de caudernos del matemático n° 50, issn 1132-2403, Madrid. 2013&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''...His poems are really thrilling. As Emerson says this poet is incredible. The poet is incredible, inexplicable. The poet works to an end above his will and by means, too, which is out of his will...''”&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr. Justice S. Mohan. Poet, India 2006&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

“''In his new book, The Crystal Temple of Meaning, G Mend-Ooyo, a poet of peace and spirituality, brings to a level of mental stillness whomever enters this temple, pure and elegant as crystal, and singing with thought.  His intention is to compare this volume of poems with a bright and calming temple…''”&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr Tadanori Matsuda . Professor of Literature /Japan/2005&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''G Mend-Ooyo’s work, the basis of his poetry, is simple:  it is, as the name of his book suggests, that Nomads are Coming from the Horizon.  The point where Heaven and Earth meet, the mutual worship of nature and human beings, intuition and the gently melody of the inner mind – this is the Golden Hill of his wisdom, in all that he writes there is the poetry of nomads and the memory of nomadism.  Mend-Ooyo’s poetic œuvre is the essence and mentality of the Mongol nomad, it is the call of Heaven, its writing  is the sweet melody of the Mongol vertical script, and its magic waves of poetry are valued throughout the world.''”&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr U. Hurelbaatar . Critic,  head of the Mongol Center for Literary Research /Mongolia/&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;“''When I finished reading this book of poetry, G Mend-Ooyo’s In Timeless Light, I recalled something said by Martin Heidegger in his book Holzwege.  He wrote, “In this time of confusion, how heavy is the poet’s burden! And when I read the first poem in this book, “Connective Meaning,” I had the thought that Mend-Oyoo has found indeed what the poet might in fact be able to do in our current time of confusion. So the poet and his poetic works are clearly revealing the inner world of human qualities.  The poetry leads us back to the source.  And thus we consider clearly the difference between intention and reality.  It for sure is this poet’s bright and undying world which is manifest in us.”''&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr Shi Chao-yin. Louvain University, Belgium, 2007&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''G Mend-Ooyo’s poetry has developed through his investigation of viewpoint and is able to express life through the simplicity of his language.  And so the particular attitude of nomadic poetry is brought closer to the world stage.  In other words, through his poetic work, which is the contemplation and worship of that meaning which reveals what is secret and which grants perspective, the special characteristics of oriental poetry are revealed.''”&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr D Tseveendorj. Researcher, critic and Professor of Literature, 2007&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''G Mend Ooyo, is a superb writer, essentially is a poet who inscribes his lyric in both, poets and prose. His book entitled “Altan Ovoo (Golden Hill)” is a master piece which transports the readers into the steppes, people, history, and mystery of Mongolia. In the book nature and mind are united and presented in a poetic suggestive symbiosis…''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Prof. Ernesto Kahan, poet, Nobel Peace Prize Winner, 1985 /Izreal&amp;Argentina/2008&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''You are such a great and absolutely first class poet. You have such a sharp eagle eye to notice this and express it in such a way that it irradiates all the optimism of your heart. Your “Altan Ovoo” is a loud shrill to us all that we can be still feel optimistic and never should go downhill into a morass or a chaotic overkill of the beauty, goodness and other treasures we can find around us in the world, especially in our native country but everywhere where we look and try to understand deeper the idyll of God’s creation…''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Prof. Imre P.Zsoldos. Poet, translator /Hungary/  2008&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;“''Dr G Mend-Ooyo is immersed in nature and his poems are not free from it. It would be more apt so say that nature is his forte…''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Prof. S.P.Guruparan. Political Science Presidency Colledge, Chennai, India 2006&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''…His poems are wonderful indepth meaning in simple language will attract the attention of the common people.”''&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr.Va.Mu.Sethuraman. Poet. Tamil Nadu, Chennai, India 2006&lt;br&gt;&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;“''Mend-Oyoo’s poetry is firmly rooted within his Mongolian heritage – a heritage that is simultaneously embedded within and distinct from the entire universe. Hence, from the very opening poem In Search Of Myself the poet engages us not only with a superb lyricism but also a profound philosophy that has obviously been garnered over many decades of reflective study.''” &lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Ruth O’Callaghan. Poet and publisher, UK, 2010&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''The poetry book /All Shining moments/ is wonderful to see. I found the introduction very interesting. The poetry is great, and very different from things I have read. The poets speak a lot about nature and space and the sky… obviously Mongolian influences, and I only wish I could hear the poems spoken in Mongolian. I think they would sound beautiful.''”&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Lesley Cowan. USA. 11 Nov, 2005.&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;br&gt;“''In particular, his work Altan Ovoo is a sincere, transparent poem of the true nomads and a magical poetic work expressing the aspiration for the safeguard of the natural essence and spiritual immunity of humankind and of the Mongols, who are being polluted and drowned in the urbanized social civilization...''”&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;sub&gt;Dr., Prof. Ya.Baatar. Critic /Mongolia/2005&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Comedy style==
Abdul Rashid switches from surreal to satirical in his dichotomy of being a middle-class educated man yet simultaneously a street-smart urban youth while avoiding clichés when dealing with topics such as being a black Muslim in South London. He switches accent and languages, speaking French, [[Patois]], [[Urdu]] and [[Somali language|Somali]] and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]] and blends them into his material.&lt;ref name="comedycv"/&gt;&lt;ref name="flavourmag"&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=http://www.flavourmag.co.uk/ones-to-watch/|title=Ones to watch|work= |location= |publisher=''Flavour Magazine''|date=20 November 2009|accessdate=1 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Octavia Estelle Butler''' (June 22, 1947{{spaced ndash}}February 24, 2006) was an African-American [[List of science-fiction authors|science-fiction writer]]. A multiple recipient of both the [[Hugo award|Hugo]] and [[Nebula award|Nebula]] awards, she became in 1995 the first science-fiction writer to receive a [[MacArthur Fellowship]].&lt;ref name= "kindafter1"&gt;Crossley, Robert.

Boston: Beacon, 2004. {{ISBN|0807083690}}&amp;nbsp;(10)&amp;nbsp;{{ISBN|978-0807083697}}&amp;nbsp;(13)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= macfound&gt;{{cite web|title= Octavia Butler|url= https://www.macfound.org/fellows/505/| website= MacArthur Foundation Fellows|accessdate= October 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler was born in [[Pasadena, California]]. After her father died, she was raised by her widowed mother. Extremely shy as a child, Octavia found an outlet at the library reading fantasy, and in writing.  As a teen she began writing science fiction.  She attended community college during the [[Black Power movement]], and while participating in a local writer's workshop was encouraged to attend the [[Clarion Workshop]], which focused on science fiction.  

She soon sold her first stories and by the late 1970s had become sufficiently successful as an author that she was able to pursue writing full-time.  Her books and short stories drew the favorable attention of the public and awards judges.  She also taught writer's workshops, and eventually relocated to [[Washington (state)|Washington]]. Butler died of a stroke at the age of 58. Her papers are held in the research collection of the [[Huntington Library]].

== Early life ==
Octavia Estelle Butler was born on June 22, 1947, in [[Pasadena, California]], the only child of Octavia Margaret Guy, a housemaid, and Laurice James Butler, a shoeshine man. Butler's father died when she was seven. Octavia was raised by her mother and maternal grandmother in what she would later recall as a strict [[Baptists|Baptist]] environment.&lt;ref name= Gant&gt;Gant-Britton, Lisbeth. "Butler, Octavia (1947– )", in Valerie Smith (ed.), ''African American Writers'', 2nd edn. Vol. 1. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 2001. 95–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up in the racially integrated community of Pasadena allowed Butler to experience cultural and ethnic diversity in the midst of [[racial segregation]]. She accompanied her mother to her cleaning work, where the two entered white people's houses through back doors, as workers. Her mother was treated poorly by her employers.&lt;ref name= "EAAW"&gt;"Butler, Octavia E.

From an early age, an almost paralyzing shyness made it difficult for Butler to socialize with other children. Her awkwardness, paired with a slight [[dyslexia]]&lt;ref name= "obit"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/01/books/01butler.html | title=Octavia E.

At the age of 10, she begged her mother to buy her a [[Remington Rand|Remington]] typewriter, on which she "pecked [her] stories two fingered".&lt;ref name=PosObs /&gt; At 12, she watched the televised version of the film ''[[Devil Girl from Mars]]'' (1954) and concluded that she could write a better story. She drafted what would later become the basis for her [[Patternist series|Patternist]] novels.&lt;ref name= "McCaffery"/&gt; Happily ignorant of the obstacles that a black female writer could encounter,&lt;ref name=Belle&gt;Belle, Dixie-Anne. "Butler, Octavia Estelle (1947–2005)," in Carole Boyce Davies (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of the African Diaspora: Origins, Experiences, and Culture'', Vol. 1. Santa Barbara, CA: ABC-CLIO, 2008. 235–236.&lt;/ref&gt; she became unsure of herself for the first time at the age of 13, when her well-intentioned aunt Hazel said: "Honey ... Negroes can't be writers." But Butler persevered in her desire to publish a story, even asking her junior high school science teacher, Mr. Pfaff, to type the first manuscript she submitted to a science fiction magazine.&lt;ref name="PosObs"/&gt;&lt;ref name= Logan&gt;Logan, Robert W. "Butler, Octavia E.", in Darlene Clark Hine (ed.), ''Black Women in America: A Historical Encyclopedia'', 2nd edn.  Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

After graduating from [[John Muir High School]] in 1965, Butler worked during the day and attended [[Pasadena City College]] (PCC) at night.&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;  As a freshman at PCC, she won a college-wide short-story contest, earning her first income ($15) as a writer.&lt;ref name=PosObs /&gt; She also got the "germ of the idea" for what would become her novel ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]''. An African-American classmate involved in the [[Black Power|Black Power Movement]] loudly criticized previous generations of African Americans for being subservient to whites. As Butler explained in later interviews, the young man's remarks were a catalyst leading her to respond with a story providing historical context for the subservience, showing that it could be understood as silent but courageous survival.&lt;ref name="Rowell"/&gt;&lt;ref name= See&gt;See, Lisa, "PW Interviews: Octavia E. Butler", ''Publishers Weekly''. December 13, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, Butler graduated from PCC with an associate of arts degree with a focus in History.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;&lt;ref name= Pfeiffer /&gt;

== Rise to success ==
Although Butler's mother wanted her to become a secretary in order to have a steady income,&lt;ref name=Rowell /&gt; Butler continued to work at a series of temporary jobs. She preferred less demanding work that would allow her to get up at two or three in the morning to write. Success continued to elude her. She styled her stories after the white-and-male-dominated science fiction she had grown up reading.&lt;ref name=EAAW /&gt;&lt;ref name=PosObs /&gt; She enrolled at [[California State University, Los Angeles]], but switched to taking writing courses through [[UCLA]] Extension.

During the Open Door Workshop of the [[Writers Guild of America|Screenwriters' Guild of America]], West, a program designed to mentor minority writers, her writing impressed one of the teachers, noted science-fiction writer [[Harlan Ellison]]. He encouraged her to attend the six-week [[Clarion Workshop|Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop]] in [[Clarion, Pennsylvania]]. There, Butler met the writer [[Samuel R. Delany]], who developed as a longtime friend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last= Davis | first=Marcia | url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/02/27/AR2006022701585_pf.html | title=Octavia Butler, A Lonely, Bright Star Of the Sci-Fi Universe | work=Washington Post' | date=February 28, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also sold her first stories: "[[Childfinder]]" to Ellison, for his anthology ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]'' (still unpublished), and [[Crossover (short story)|"Crossover"]] to Robin Scott Wilson, the director of Clarion, who published it in the 1971 Clarion anthology.&lt;ref name="Gant" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Pfeiffer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2014/07/10/320746103/an-unexpected-treat-for-octavia-e-butler-fans|title=An 'Unexpected' Treat For Octavia E.

For the next five years, Butler worked on the series of novels that later become known as the [[Patternist series]]: ''[[Patternmaster]]'' (1976), ''[[Mind of My Mind]]'' (1977), and ''Survivor'' (1978). In 1978, she was finally able to stop working at temporary jobs and live on her writing.&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer /&gt; She took a break from the Patternist series to research and write ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979), and then finished the series with ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'' (1980) and ''[[Clay's Ark]]'' (1984).

Butler's rise to prominence began in 1984 when "[[Speech Sounds]]" won the [[Hugo Award]] for Short Story and, a year later, ''[[Bloodchild]]'' won the Hugo Award, the [[Locus Award]], and the ''Science Fiction Chronicle'' Reader Award for Best Novelette.  In the meantime, Butler traveled to the [[Amazon rainforest|Amazon]] rainforest and the Andes to do research for what would become the ''Xenogenesis'' trilogy: ''Dawn'' (1987), ''Adulthood Rites'' (1988), and ''Imago ''(1989).&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer /&gt; These stories were republished in 2000 as the collection ''[[Lilith's Brood]].

During the 1990s, Butler worked on the novels that solidified her fame as a writer: ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'' (1993) and ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]'' (1998). In 1995, she became the first science-fiction writer to be awarded a [[John D. and Catherine T. MacArthur Foundation]] [[MacArthur Fellows Program|fellowship]], an award that came with a prize of $295,000.&lt;ref name="Holden"&gt;Holden, Rebecca J, and Nisi Shawl.

In 1999, after her mother's death, Butler moved to [[Lake Forest Park, Washington]]. ''The Parable of the Talents'' had won the Science Fiction Writers of America's [[Nebula Award]] for Best Science Novel and she had plans for four more Parable novels: ''Parable of the Trickster'', ''Parable of the Teacher'', ''Parable of Chaos'', and ''Parable of Clay''. However, after several failed attempts to begin ''The Parable of the Trickster'', she decided to stop work in the series.&lt;ref name=Mehaffy&gt;Butler, Octavia E. {{"'}}Radio Imagination': Octavia Butler on the Politics of Narrative Embodiment."

==Writing career==

===Early stories, Patternist series, and ''Kindred'': 1971–1984===

Butler's first work published was ''Crossover'' in the 1971 Clarion Workshop anthology. She also sold the short story ''Childfinder'' to Harlan Ellison for the anthology ''[[The Last Dangerous Visions]]''. "I thought I was on my way as a writer", Butler recalled in her short fiction collection ''[[Bloodchild and Other Stories]]''. "In fact, I had five more years of rejection slips and horrible little jobs ahead of me before I sold another word."&lt;ref name=ACO&gt;Butler, Octavia E. "Afterword to Crossover." ''Bloodchild and Other Stories''. New York, NY: Seven Stories Press. 1996. p.&amp;nbsp;120.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Starting in 1974, Butler worked on a series of novels that would later be collected as the [[Patternist series]], which depicts the transformation of humanity into three genetic groups: the dominant Patternists, humans who have been bred with heightened telepathic powers and are bound to the Patternmaster via a psionic chain; their enemies the Clayarks, disease-mutated animal-like superhumans; and the Mutes, ordinary humans bonded to the Patternists.&lt;ref name=Mehaffy /&gt;
 
The first novel, ''[[Patternist series#Patternmaster (1976)|Patternmaster]]'' (1976), eventually became the last installment in the series' internal chronology. Set in the distant future, it tells of the coming-of-age of Teray, a young Patternist who fights for position within Patternist society and eventually for the role of Patternmaster.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;
 
Next came ''[[Mind of My Mind]]'' (1977), a prequel to ''Patternmaster'' set in the 20th century. The story follows the development of Mary, the creator of the psionic chain and the first Patternmaster to bind all Patternists, and her inevitable struggle for power with her father Doro, a parapsychological vampire who seeks to retain control over the psionic children he has bred over the centuries.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer /&gt;

}}The third book of the series, ''[[Survivor (Octavia Butler novel)|Survivor]]'', was published in 1978. The titular survivor is Alanna, the adopted child of the Missionaries, fundamentalist Christians who have traveled to another planet to escape Patternist control and Clayark infection. Captured by a local tribe called the Tehkohn, Alanna learns their language and adopts their customs, knowledge which she then uses to help the Missionaries avoid bondage and assimilation into a rival tribe that opposes the Tehkohn.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bogstad&gt;Bogstad, Janice. "Octavia E. Butler and Power Relations." ''Janus'' 4.4 (1978–79): 28–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

After ''Survivor'', Butler took a break from the Patternist series to write what would become her best-selling novel, ''[[Kindred (novel)|Kindred]]'' (1979) as well as the short story "Near of Kin" (1979).&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt; In ''Kindred'', Dana, an African-American woman, is transported from 1976 Los Angeles to early 19th-century Maryland. She meets her ancestors: Rufus, a white slave holder, and Alice, a black freewoman forced into slavery later in life. In "Near of Kin" the protagonist discovers a taboo relationship in her family as she goes through her mother's things after her death.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

In 1980, Butler published the fourth book of the Patternist series, ''[[Wild Seed (novel)|Wild Seed]]'', whose narrative became the series' origin story. Set in Africa and America during the 17th century, ''Wild Seed'' traces the struggle between the four-thousand-year-old parapsychological vampire Doro and his "wild" child and bride, the three-hundred-year-old shapeshifter and healer Anyanwu. Doro, who has bred psionic children for centuries, deceives Anyanwu into becoming one of his breeders, but she eventually escapes and uses her gifts to create communities that rival Doro's. When Doro finally tracks her down, Anyanwu, tired by decades of escaping or fighting Doro, decides to commit suicide, forcing him to admit his need for her.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

In 1983, Butler published "Speech Sounds", a story set in a post-apocalyptic Los Angeles where a pandemic has caused most humans to lose their ability to read, speak, or write. For many, this impairment is accompanied by uncontrollable feelings of jealousy, resentment, and rage. "Speech Sounds" received the 1984 [[Hugo Award for Best Short Story]].&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

In 1984, Butler released the last book of the Patternmaster series, ''[[Clay's Ark]]''. Set in the [[Mojave Desert]], it focuses on a colony of humans infected by an extraterrestrial microorganism brought to Earth by the one surviving astronaut of the spaceship Clay's Ark. As the microorganism compels them to spread it, they kidnap ordinary people to infect them and, in the case of women, give birth to the mutant, [[sphinx]]-like children who will be the first members of the Clayark race.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;

===''Bloodchild'' and the Xenogenesis trilogy: 1984–1989===
Butler followed ''Clay's Ark'' with the critically acclaimed short story "Bloodchild" (1984). Set on an alien planet, it depicts the complex relationship between human refugees and the insect-like aliens who keep them in a preserve to protect them, but also to use them as hosts for breeding their young. Sometimes called Butler's "pregnant man story", "Bloodchild" won the Nebula, Hugo, and Locus Awards, and the Science Fiction Chronicle Reader Award.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

Three years later, Butler published ''Dawn'', the first installment of what would become known as the [[Lilith's Brood|Xenogenesis trilogy]]. The series examines the theme of alienation by creating situations in which humans are forced to coexist with other species to survive and extends Butler's recurring exploration of genetically-altered, hybrid individuals and communities.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;&lt;ref name= Mehaffy /&gt;  In ''Dawn'', protagonist Lilith Iyapo finds herself in a spaceship after surviving a nuclear apocalypse that destroys Earth. Saved by the [[Oankali]] aliens, the human survivors must combine their DNA with an ooloi, the Oankali's third sex, in order to create a new race that eliminates a self-destructive flaw in humans—their aggressive hierarchical tendencies.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt; Butler followed Dawn with "[[The Evening and the Morning and the Night]]" (1987), a story about how certain female sufferers of "Duryea-Gode Disease", a genetic disorder which causes [[dissociative state]]s, obsessive self-mutilation, and violent psychosis, are able to control others afflicted with the disease.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

''Adulthood Rites'' (1988) and ''Imago'' (1989) the second and the third books in the Xenogenesis trilogy,  focus on the predatory and prideful tendencies that affect human evolution, as humans now revolt against Lilith's Oankali-engineered progeny. Set thirty years after humanity's return to Earth, ''Adulthood Rites'' centers on the kidnapping of Lilith's part-human, part alien child, Akin, by a human-only group who are against the Oankali. Akin learns about both aspects of his identity through his life with the humans as well as the Akjai. The Oankali-only group becomes their mediator, and ultimately creates a human-only colony in Mars.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt; In ''Imago'', the Oankali create a third species more powerful than themselves: the shape-shifting healer Jodahs, a human-Oankali ooloi who must find suitable human male and female mates to survive its metamorphosis and finds them in the most unexpected of places, in a village of renegade humans.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer /&gt;

===The Parable series: 1993–1998===
In the mid-1990s, Butler published two novels later designated as the Parable (or Earthseed) series. The books depict the struggle of the Earthseed community to survive the socioeconomic and political collapse of 21st-century America due to poor environmental stewardship, corporate greed, and the growing gap between the wealthy and the poor.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Omry&gt;Omry, Keren. "''Octavia Butler (1947–2006)''", in Yolanda Williams Page (ed.), ''Encyclopedia of African American Women Writers'', Westport, CT: Greenwood, 2007. 64–70.&lt;/ref&gt; The books propose alternate philosophical views and religious interventions as solutions to such dilemmas.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;

The first book in the series, ''[[Parable of the Sower (novel)|Parable of the Sower]]'' (1993), features a fifteen-year-old protagonist named Lauren Oya Olamina, and is set in a dystopian California in the 2020s. Lauren, who suffers from a syndrome causing her to literally feel any physical pain she witnesses, decides to escape the corruption and corporatization of her community of Robledo. She forms a new belief system, Earthseed, in order to prepare for the future of the human race on another planet. Recruiting members of varying social backgrounds, Lauren relocates her new group to Northern California, naming her new community "Earthseed".&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

Her 1998 follow-up novel, ''[[Parable of the Talents (novel)|Parable of the Talents]]'', is set sometime after Lauren's death and is told through the excerpts of Lauren's journals as framed by the commentary of her estranged daughter, Larkin.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt; It details the takeover of Earthseed by right-wing fundamentalist Christians, Lauren's attempts to survive their religious "re-education", and the final triumph of Earthseed as a community and a doctrine.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Allbery&gt;Allbery, Russ. [http://www.eyrie.org/~eagle/reviews/books/0-446-61038-0.html "''Review of Parable of the Talents''"]. ''Eyrie.org''. April 5, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In between her Earthseed novels, Butler published the collection ''[[Bloodchild and Other Stories]]'' (1995), which includes the short stories "Bloodchild", "The Evening and the Morning and the Night", "Near of Kin", "Speech Sounds", and "Crossover", as well as the non-fiction pieces "Positive Obsession" and "''Furor Scribendi''".&lt;ref name=Calvin&gt;Calvin, Ritch.

===Late stories and ''Fledgling'': 2003–2005===
{{further|Symbiosis in fiction}}

After several years of writer's block, Butler published the short stories "Amnesty" (2003) and "The Book of Martha" (2003), and her second standalone novel, ''Fledgling'' (2005). Both short stories focus on how impossible conditions force an ordinary woman to make a distressing choice.&lt;ref name=Curtis&gt;Curtis, Claire P. "Theorizing Fear: Octavia Butler and The Realist Utopia." ''Utopian Studies'' 19.3 (2008): 411–431. {{JSTOR|20719919}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In "Amnesty", an alien abductee recounts her painful abuse at the hand of the unwitting aliens, and upon her release, by humans, and explains why she chose to work as a translator for the aliens now that the Earth's economy is in a deep depression. In "The Book of Martha", God asks a middle-aged African-American novelist to make one important change to fix humanity's destructive ways. Martha's choice—to make humans have vivid and satisfying dreams—means that she will no longer be able to do what she loves, writing fiction.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt; These two stories were added to the 2005 edition of ''Bloodchild and Other Stories''.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

Butler's last publication during her lifetime was ''[[Fledgling (novel)|Fledgling]]'', a novel exploring the culture of a vampire community living in mutualistic symbiosis with humans.&lt;ref name=EAAW /&gt; Set on the West Coast, it tells of the coming-of-age of a young female hybrid vampire whose species is called Ina. The only survivor of a vicious attack on her families that left her an amnesiac, she must seek justice for her dead, build a new family, and relearn how to be Ina.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

== Death ==
During her last years, Butler struggled with [[writer's block]] and depression, partly caused by the side effects of medication for high blood pressure.&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt;&lt;ref name=BLC&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Butler, Octavia 1947–2006 |title=Black Literature Criticism: Classic and Emerging Authors since 1950 |editor-first= Jelena O. | editor-last = Krstovic |edition=2nd  |volume=Vol. 1 |location= Detroit |publisher=Gale |year=2008 |pages= 244–258 |work=Gale Virtual Literature Collection |ISBN= 9 781 41443 1703 |via= Google Books |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dZchmwEACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; She continued writing and taught at Clarion's Science Fiction Writers' Workshop regularly. In 2005, she was inducted into [[Chicago State University]]'s International Black Writers Hall of Fame.&lt;ref name=EAAW /&gt;

Butler died outside of her home in [[Lake Forest Park, Washington]], on February 24, 2006 at the age of 58.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Contemporary news accounts were inconsistent as to the cause of her death, with some reporting that she suffered a fatal stroke, while others indicated that she died of head injuries after falling and striking her head on her walkway.  Another suggestion, backed by ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' magazine, is that a stroke caused the fall and hence the head injuries.&lt;ref name=locus-obit&gt;{{cite journal |title= Obituaries |work=[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]] |issn= 0047-4959 |issue= 4.543 |volume=56}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Themes==

=== The critique of present-day hierarchies ===
In multiple interviews and essays, Butler explained her view of humanity as inherently flawed by an innate tendency towards hierarchical thinking which leads to intolerance, violence and, if not checked, the ultimate destruction of our species.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer /&gt;&lt;ref name=AEW&gt;"Butler, Octavia E.", ''American Ethnic Writers'', Revised edn. Vol. 1. Pasadena, CA: Salem Press, 2009. 168–175.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Simple peck-order bullying", she wrote in her essay "A World without Racism",&lt;ref name=WWR&gt;[https://www.npr.org/programs/specials/racism/010830.octaviabutleressay.html "A World without Racism."] ''NPR Weekend Edition Saturday''. September 1, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; "is only the beginning of the kind of hierarchical behavior that can lead to racism, sexism, ethnocentrism, classism, and all the other 'isms' that cause so much suffering in the world." Her stories, then, often replay humanity's domination of the weak by the strong as a type of parasitism.&lt;ref name="AEW"/&gt; These "others", whether aliens, vampires, superhuman, or a slave masters, find themselves defied by a protagonist who embodies difference, diversity, and change, so that, as John R. Pfeiffer notes "[i]n one sense [Butler's] fables are trials of solutions to the self-destructive condition in which she finds mankind."&lt;ref name=Pfeiffer /&gt;

=== The remaking of the human ===

In his essay on the sociobiological backgrounds of Butler's ''Xenogenesis'' trilogy, J. Adam Johns describes how Butler's narratives counteract the death drive behind the hierarchical impulse with an innate love of life (biophilia), particularly different, strange life.&lt;ref name=Johns&gt;Johns, J. Adam. "Becoming Medusa: Octavia Butler's ''Lilith's Brood'' and Sociobiology." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37.3 (2010): 382–400.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, Butler's stories feature gene manipulation, interbreeding, miscegenation, symbiosis, mutation, alien contact, non-consensual sex, contamination, and other forms of hybridity as the means to correct the sociobiological causes of hierarchical violence.&lt;ref name=Ferreira&gt;Ferreira, Maria Aline. "Symbiotic Bodies and Evolutionary Tropes in the Work of Octavia Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37. 3 (November 2010): 401–415.&lt;/ref&gt; As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, "[i]n [Butler's] narratives the undoing of the human body is both literal and metaphorical, for it signifies the profound changes necessary to shape a world not organized by hierarchical violence."&lt;ref name=Kilgore&gt;Kilgore, De Witt Douglas and Ranu Samantrai. "A Memorial to Octavia E. Butler." ''Science Fiction Studies'' 37.3 (November 2010): 353–361. {{JSTOR|25746438}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary maturity achieved by the bioengineered hybrid protagonist at the end of the story, then, signals the possible evolution of the dominant community in terms of tolerance, acceptance of diversity, and a desire to wield power responsibly.&lt;ref name="AEW"/&gt;

=== The survivor as hero ===
Butler's protagonists are disenfranchised individuals who endure, compromise, and embrace radical change in order to survive. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai note, her stories focus on minority characters whose historical background makes them already intimate with brutal violation and exploitation, and therefore the need to compromise to survive.&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt; Even when endowed with extra abilities, these characters are forced to experience unprecedented physical, mental, and emotional distress and exclusion to ensure a minimal degree of agency and to prevent humanity from achieving self-destruction.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;&lt;ref name="Belle"/&gt; In many stories, their acts of courage become acts of understanding, and in some cases, love, as they reach a crucial compromise with those in power.&lt;ref name="AEW"/&gt; Ultimately, Butler's focus on disenfranchised characters serves to illustrate both the historical exploitation of minorities and how the resolve of one such exploited individual may bring on critical change.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt;

=== The creation of alternative communities ===
Butler's stories feature mixed communities founded by African protagonists and populated by diverse, if similar-minded individuals. Members may be humans of African, European, or Asian descent, extraterrestrial (such as the N'Tlic in [[Bloodchild and Other Stories|"Bloodchild"]]), from a different species (such as the vampiric Ina in [[Fledgling (novel)|''Fledgling'')]], and cross-species (such as the human-Oankali Akin and Jodahs in the [[Lilith's Brood|''Xenogenesis trilogy'')]]. In some stories, the community's hybridity results in a flexible view of sexuality and gender (for instance, the polyamorous extended families in [[Fledgling (novel)|''Fledgling'')]]. Thus, Butler creates bonds between groups that are generally considered to be separate and unrelated, and suggests hybridity as "the potential root of good family and blessed community life".&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt;

=== Relationship to Afrofuturism ===
Butler's work has been associated with the genre of [[Afrofuturism]],&lt;ref name=Sinker&gt;Sinker, Mark. "Loving the Alien." ''The Wire'' 96 (February 1992): 30–32.&lt;/ref&gt; a term coined by Mark Dery to describe "speculative fiction that treats African-American themes and addresses African-American concerns in the context of 20th-century technoculture".&lt;ref name=Bould&gt;Bould, Mark. "The Ships Landed Long Ago: Afrofuturism and Black SF", ''Science Fiction Studies'' 34.2 (July 2007): 177–186. {{JSTOR|4241520}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics, however, have noted that while Butler's protagonists are of African descent, the communities they create are multi-ethnic and, sometimes, multi-species. As De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai explain in their 2010 memorial to Butler, while Butler does offer "an afro-centric sensibility at the core of narratives", her "insistence on hybridity beyond the point of discomfort" exceeds the tenets of both black cultural nationalism and of "white-dominated" liberal pluralism.&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
Most critics praise Butler for her unflinching exposition of human flaws, which she depicts with striking realism. ''[[The New York Times]]'' regarded her novels as "evocative" and "often troubling" explorations of "far-reaching issues of race, sex, power".&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction]]'' called her examination of humanity "clear-headed and brutally unsentimental"{{citation needed|date=March 2016}} and ''[[Village Voice]]''{{'}}s [[Dorothy Allison]] described her as "writing the most detailed social criticism" where "the hard edge of cruelty, violence, and domination is described in stark detail".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=The Future of Female: Octavia Butler's Mother Lode|last=Allison|first=Dorothy|date=December 19, 1989|work=The Village Voice|access-date=|page=67}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Locus (magazine)|Locus]]'' regarded her as "one of those authors who pay serious attention to the way human beings actually work together and against each other, and she does so with extraordinary plausibility".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Parable of the Sower: Synopses &amp; Reviews|url=http://www.powells.com/book/parable-of-the-sower-9780446675505|website=Powell's|accessdate= March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Houston Post]]'' ranked her "among the best SF writers, blessed with a mind capable of conceiving complicated futuristic situations that shed considerable light on our current affairs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dawn: Synopses &amp; Reviews|url=http://www.powells.com/book/dawn-9780446603775|website=Powell's|accessdate= March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars, on the other hand, focus on Butler's choice to write from the point of view of marginal characters and communities and thus "expanded SF to reflect the experiences and expertise of the disenfranchised".&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt; While surveying Butler's novels, critic [[Burton Raffel]] noted how race and gender influence her writing: "I do not think any of these eight books could have been written by a man, as they most emphatically were not, nor, with the single exception of her first book, ''Pattern-Master'' (1976), are likely to have been written, as they most emphatically were, by anyone but an African American."&lt;ref name="Raffel" /&gt; Robert Crossley commended how Butler's "feminist aesthetic" works to expose sexual, racial, and cultural chauvinisms because it is "enriched by a historical consciousness that shapes the depiction of enslavement both in the real past and in imaginary pasts and futures".&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt;

Butler has been praised widely for her spare yet vivid style, with ''Washington Post Book World'' calling her craftsmanship "superb".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title=Mysteries of the Mayans|last=Grant|first=Richard|date=July 31, 1988|work=Washington Post|page=X8|via=Nexis Uni}}&lt;/ref&gt; Burton Raffel regards her prose as "carefully, expertly crafted" and "crystalline, at its best, sensuous, sensitive, exact not in the least directed at calling attention to itself".&lt;ref name=Raffel&gt;Raffel, Burton. "Genre to the Rear, Race and Gender to the Fore: The Novels of Octavia E. Butler." ''Literary Review'' 38.3 (Spring 1995): 454–61.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence==
In interviews with Charles Rowell and Randall Kenan, Butler credited the struggles of her working-class mother as an important influence on her writing.&lt;ref name=Rowell /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kenan"&gt;Butler, Octavia E. "An Interview with Octavia E. Butler." Randall Kenan. ''Callaloo'' 14.2 (1991): 495–504. {{JSTOR|2931654}}. {{doi|10.2307/2931654}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Because Butler's mother received little formal education herself, she made sure that young Butler was given the opportunity to learn by bringing her reading materials that her white employers threw away, from magazines to advanced books.&lt;ref name=PosObs /&gt; She also encouraged Butler to write. She bought her daughter her first typewriter when she was 10 years old, and, seeing her hard at work on a story, casually remarked that maybe one day she could become a writer, causing Butler to realize that it was possible to make a living as an author.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt; A decade later, Mrs. Butler  would pay more than a month's rent to have an agent review her daughter's work.&lt;ref name=PosObs /&gt; She also provided Butler with the money she had been saving for dental work to pay for Butler's scholarship so she could attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, where Butler sold her first two stories.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

A second person to play an influential role in Butler's work was American writer [[Harlan Ellison]]. As a teacher at the Open Door Workshop of the Screen Writers Guild of America, he gave Butler her first honest and constructive criticism on her writing after years of lukewarm responses from composition teachers and baffling rejections from publishers.&lt;ref name="Belle"/&gt; Impressed by her work, Ellison suggested she attend the Clarion Science Fiction Writers Workshop, and even contributed $100 towards her application fee. As the years passed, Ellison's mentorship became a close friendship.&lt;ref name=Holden /&gt;

== Point of view ==
Butler began reading science fiction at a young age, but quickly became disenchanted by the genre's unimaginative portrayal of ethnicity and class as well as by its lack of noteworthy female protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;Smith Foster, Frances. "Octavia Butler's Black Female Future Fiction." ''Extrapolation'' 23.1 (1982): 37–49.&lt;/ref&gt; She then set to correct those gaps by, as De Witt Douglas Kilgore and Ranu Samantrai point out, "choosing to write self-consciously as an African-American woman marked by a particular history"&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt;—what Butler termed as "writing myself in".&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt; Butler's stories, therefore, are usually written from the perspective of a marginalized black woman whose difference from the dominant agents increases her potential for reconfiguring the future of her society.&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt;

== Audience ==
Publishers and critics have labelled Butler's work as science fiction.&lt;ref name=Gant /&gt; While Butler enjoyed the genre deeply, calling it "potentially the freest genre in existence",&lt;ref name=Beal&gt;Butler, Octavia. "''Black Scholar'' Interview with Octavia Butler: Black Women and the Science Fiction Genre." Frances M. Beal. ''Black Scholar'' (Mar/Apr. 1986): 14–18. {{JSTOR|41067255}}.&lt;/ref&gt; she resisted being branded a genre writer.&lt;ref name="Logan"/&gt; Her narratives have drawn attention of people from varied ethnic and cultural backgrounds.&lt;ref name="Belle"/&gt; She claimed to have three loyal audiences: black readers, science-fiction fans, and feminists.&lt;ref name="Kilgore"/&gt;

==Interviews==
[[Charlie Rose]] interviewed Octavia Butler in 2000 soon after the award of a MacArthur Fellowship. The highlights are probing questions that arise out of Butler's personal life narrative and her interest in becoming not only a writer, but a writer of science fiction. Rose asked, "What then is central to what you want to say about race?" Butler's response was, "''Do'' I want to say something central about race? Aside from, 'Hey we're here!'?" This points to an essential claim for Butler that the world of science fiction is a world of possibilities, and although race is an innate element, it is embedded in the narrative, not forced upon it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/3662 "Charlie Rose: A Conversation with Octavia Butler"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224103141/http://www.charlierose.com/view/interview/3662 |date=December 24, 2013 }}, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview by Randall Kenan, Butler discusses how her life experiences as a child shaped most of her thinking. As a writer, she was able to use her writing as a vehicle to critique history under the lenses of feminism. In the interview, she discusses the research that had to be done in order to write her bestselling novel, ''Kindred''.  Most of it is based on visiting libraries as well as historic landmarks with respect to what she is investigating. Butler admits that she writes science fiction because she does not want her work to be labeled or used as a marketing tool. She wants the readers to be genuinely interested in her work and the story she provides, but at the same time she fears that people will not read her work because of the "science fiction" label that they have.&lt;ref name="Kenan"/&gt;

In an interview with Joshunda Sanders, Butler commented on the space race and its influence on her work. She noted, "I think of the space race as a way of having a nuclear war without having one." She claimed that Ronald Reagan believed a nuclear war against the Soviet Union was winnable. Butler admitted to being very confused by this idea, and said that it contributed to her idea for the Xenogenesis books. She said "there must be something basic, something really genetically wrong with us if we're falling for this stuff." Butler then commented on how she felt a real fear about nuclear war during the Cold War and that these ideas had a real influence on some of her early works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inmotionmagazine.com/ac04/obutler.html|title=Interview with Octavia Butler|website=In Motion Magazine|first=Joshunda|last=Sanders|date=March 14, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with Marilyn Mehaffy and AnaLouise Keating, for [[The Society for the Study of the Multi-Ethnic Literature of the United States|MELUS]], Octavia Butler talked about how biology is used to keep groups of people out of power. She said, "[w]hat's made of biology is that the people who are in power are going to figure out why this is a good reason for them to stay in power. Look at the tests that show that  women have better linguistic abilities: Yet, how many of our ambassadors are women? How many of the politicians are women? This is not looked at; instead, the argument goes that women don't have the mathematical abilities ... every now and then. So we're much more likely now to be penalized for whatever we're assumed not to have. We're much more likely to find that whatever little genetic thing that's discovered is going to be used against us."&lt;ref name=Mehaffy /&gt; The issue of biology defining women and what they can and can't do has long been a part of feminism.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cliohistory.org/click/body-health/bodies/#c2376 "Women's Bodies: A Short Introduction"].

The Honourable '''Paul Joseph Ngei''' (18 October 1923 – 15 August 2004) was a [[Kenya]]n politician who was imprisoned for his role in the anti-colonial movement, but who went on to hold several government ministerial positions after Kenya became independent.

==Early life==
Ngei was born at [[Kiima Kimwe]] near [[Machakos]] township, [[Kenya]]. He was the grandson of paramount chief Masaku after whom the town and the district were named. The family moved from Kiima Kimwe to a new settlement at [[Kangundo]] Division in a small village called Mbilini in 1929. This was a mountainous area with good rainfall for agriculture. His father had been converted to Christianity by the [[Africa Inland Mission]].

Ngei attended primary school at DEB Kangundo from 1932, intermediate school at Kwa Mating'i in Machakos town from 1936, and [[Alliance High School (Kenya)|Alliance High School]] in [[Kiambu District]]. He then joined the army in the [[King's African Rifles]] (KAR) for a four-year stint. After that he enrolled at [[Makerere University]] in Uganda as a journalism student from 1948–1950.

==Anti-colonial activism==
The anti-colonial movement gathered mometum in Kenya in the 1940s. A political upsurge led to the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Mau rebellion]], which involved several tribes: the [[Luo (family of ethnic groups)|Luo]]s, [[Nandi people|Nandi]]s, [[Maasai people|Maasai]], [[Kamba people|Kamba]], [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]]s, [[Meru people|Merus]] and [[Embu people|Embus]].

The declaration of a state of emergency in October 1952 led to the arrest of Ngei, [[Jomo Kenyatta]] and others. Ngei earned Kenyatta's undying friendship when, during their imprisonment in [[Lodwar]], Ngei physically stopped a colonial jailer from beating up Kenyatta by seizing the whip and challenging the jailer to beat him (Ngei) first. The "[[Kapenguria Six]]" included Fred Kubai, [[Bildad Kaggia]], [[Achieng Oneko]] and Kung'u Karumba. The last surviving member, Oneko, died on 9 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;''Daily Nation'', 10 June 2007: ''[http://www.nationmedia.com/dailynation/nmgcontententry.asp?category_id=1&amp;newsid=100004 Achieng Oneko dies, aged 87]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mashujaa Day]], which until recently was known as [[Kenyatta Day]] is a national holiday in Kenya held every year to commemorate the detention of the six on 20 October 1952.&lt;ref&gt;''Kenya Times'', 23 October 2005: ''[http://www.timesnews.co.ke/23oct05/nwsstory/opinion2.html Kenyatta Day a sad reminder of Kenya's distorted history] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060519042817/http://www.timesnews.co.ke/23oct05/nwsstory/opinion2.html |date=19 May 2006 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

They were released nine years later, in 1961, two years before Kenya gained independence.&lt;ref name="dishonour"&gt;''[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]'', 16 August 2004: {{cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/august/mon16082004/headlines/news15080401.htm |title=''A colourful career ends in dishonour'' |accessdate=2007-09-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927174953/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/august/mon16082004/headlines/news15080401.htm |archivedate=27 September 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year Ngei established the [[African People's Party]].

Ngei's history generates much interest when examined within the context of these post-[[World War II]] protest politics that eventually ushered in independence for Kenya. These were protest politics characterised by party politics and violence as was manifested by the Mau Mau rebellion. Ngei lived and actively participated in both of these facets of Kenya's historical trajectory.

He came from the Akamba people of Kenya, who were the driving force for the first political protest against the British in 1937 led by Samuel Muindi Mbingu.

==Government positions==
Ngei was the [[Kangundo Constituency]] MP from 1969 to 1990.&lt;ref&gt;Center for Multiparty Democracy: [http://www.cmd.or.ke/images/Politics%20and%20Paliamenterians%20in%20Kenya.pdf Politics and Parliamentarians in Kenya 1944–2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081028212845/http://www.cmd.or.ke/images/Politics%20and%20Paliamenterians%20in%20Kenya.pdf |date=28 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He served throughout the Jomo Kenyatta government from 1964–1978 as a cabinet minister and in the post-Kenyatta government led by President [[Daniel arap Moi]] from 1978–1990 where he held several ministerial positions. In 1990 he was ruled bankrupt by court and consequently had to give up his parliamentary seat.&lt;ref name="dishonour"/&gt;

==Funeral==
Ngei died in August 2004 at the age of 81 after suffering from [[diabetes]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', 16 August 2004: {{cite web |url=http://www.eastandard.net/archives/august/mon16082004/headlines/news15080415.htm |title=''Freedom hero Paul Ngei is dead'' |accessdate=2007-10-10 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010045833/http://www.eastandard.net/archives/august/mon16082004/headlines/news15080415.htm |archivedate=10 October 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A mausoleum was built in Mbilini, Kangundo, the constituency he had served for 27 years, by the Kenyan government and unveiled in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;''The Standard'', 12 August 2006: ''[http://www.eastandard.net/InsidePage.php?id=1143956678 MP accuses Government of neglecting freedom heroes]{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}''&lt;/ref&gt;  On 20 October 2016, the president of the Republic of Kenya unveiled a statue in honour of Paul Ngei at Chumvi town which is in the junction that leads to Machakos from the Mombasa Highway. This was during the celebrations of the year's Heroes' Day which were held in Machakos. The Jubilee Government committed to have national days celebrated outside the capital, Nairobi.

Frank Sinatra met Nancy Rose Barbato (March 25, 1917 – July 13, 2018) when he was nineteen, and they were married on February 4, 1939, in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]], Barbato's home town.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rough Guide to Frank Sinatra'', Chris Ingham, pg 9&lt;/ref&gt;  Their wedding was held at Our Lady of Sorrows Church at 93 Clerk Street, after which the newlyweds resided in an apartment house at 137 Bergen Avenue. Their first child, their elder daughter [[Nancy Sinatra]], was born on June 8, 1940, and their son, Francis Wayne Sinatra, known as [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]], was born on January 10, 1944. Both children were born at the [[Frank Hague#President maker|Margaret Hague Hospital]] in Jersey City.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cityofjerseycity.org/sinatra.shtml "Frank Sinatra's Jersey City Connection"], CityofJerseyCity.org. Accessed June 30, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following their move to [[Hollywood, Los Angeles]], [[California]], Sinatra errantly strayed from his marriage into extra-marital affairs, the first known with [[Marilyn Maxwell]]. These affairs also became public knowledge and caused great embarrassment to Nancy Barbato Sinatra, who considered calling off their marriage then and had an abortion when she became pregnant in 1946.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, pg 10, as related in Tina Sinatra's memoir&lt;/ref&gt; A third child, [[Tina Sinatra|Christina Sinatra]], known as "Tina", was born on June 20, 1948.

Nancy Barbato Sinatra and Frank Sinatra announced their separation on [[Valentine's Day]], February 14, 1950, with Frank's additional extra-marital affair with [[Ava Gardner]] compounding his transgressions and becoming public knowledge once again. After originally just seeking a [[legal separation]], Frank and Nancy Sinatra decided some months later to file for divorce, and this divorce became legally final on October 29, 1951. Frank Sinatra's affair and relationship with Gardner had become more and more serious, and she later became his second wife.

What was perhaps less widely known was the fact of Sinatra’s continuing visits; his long, confiding late-night phone calls; and the convivial family dinners on birthdays, holidays and many other occasions.   “Throughout the many years after they split, my grandfather came to visit whenever his crazy life would allow it,” Mrs. Sinatra’s granddaughter A. J. Lambert wrote in a 2015 remembrance in Vanity Fair. “I can remember times when she would be on the phone with her ex-husband, and the next thing I knew some eggplant was coming out of the freezer to thaw so that she could make him some sandwiches when he showed up.”   She remained profoundly private, uttering barely a word in public about her life with Sinatra, though their mutual feelings were clear, her granddaughter recalled, to those who knew them best.&lt;ref name="Barbatodeath"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/14/obituaries/nancy-barbato-sinatra-dead.html|title=Nancy Barbato Sinatra, 101, an Idol’s First Wife and Lasting Confidante, Dies|author=Margalit Fox|website=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

“I know he never stopped loving her,” Ms. Lambert wrote. “And I know she never stopped loving him.”&lt;ref name="Barbatodeath"/&gt; 

Nancy Barbato Sinatra died in 2018 at the age of 101, she was never remarried and having outlived not only her ex-husband, but also her son Frank Jr. as well, who died in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nj.com/hudson/index.ssf/2018/07/nancy_sinatra_sr_jersey_city_native_and_former_wif.html|title=Nancy Sinatra Sr., Jersey City native and former wife of Frank Sinatra, dies at 101|last=McDonald|first=Corey W.|date=14 July 2018|publisher=[[NJ.com]]|accessdate=14 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ava Gardner===
[[File:Eiganotomo-avagardner-dec1953.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ava Gardner]], Sinatra's wife from 1951 to 1957]]
Kitty Kelley claims that Sinatra had first seen photographs of [[Ava Gardner]] in a magazine and had sworn that he would marry her. Ruth Rosenthal, a friend of Gardner's, stated that Gardner initially detested him upon meeting him at MGM, finding him to be "conceited, arrogant and overpowering". Their similarities, however, from vices like smoking, drinking hard liquor and cursing, to their volatile tempers and love of violent sports, soon became apparent.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=155}} Sinatra separated from Nancy on Valentine's Day 1950, after he confessed to his passionate affair with Gardner, and she subsequently locked him out of the house and hired a lawyer.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=162}} Although Nancy initially refused to divorce him, Sinatra was eventually granted a divorce in Nevada in October 1951, and subsequently obtained a marriage license in Pennsylvania, marrying Gardner in a small ceremony on November 7, 1951.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=189-91}} A turbulent marriage, with many well-publicized fights and altercations,{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=202}} and an abortion in November 1952,{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=133}} the couple formally announced their separation on October 29, 1953 through MGM.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=229}} Gardner filed for divorce in June 1954, at a time when she was dating matador [[Luis Miguel Dominguín]], but the divorce wasn't settled until July 1957.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=239}} Sinatra blamed Peter Lawford for the split, who had dated Gardner before, and it took six years for Sinatra to forgive him. He was inconsolable in the fall of 1953 after the split, and according to Kelley, on November 18, Van Heusen found him in the elevator of his 57th Street apartment with his wrists slashed.{{efn|Kelley states that this was covered up by his representatives who told the press he had been admitted to hospital, suffering from "complete physical exhaustion, severe loss of weight, and a tremendous amount of emotional strain", and that he had simply had an accident with a broken glass.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=208}}}}{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=230}} Sinatra took responsibility for Gardner's business affairs long after the split, and was still dealing with her finances in 1976.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=486}} When she fell into financial difficulty in later years, Sinatra paid $50,000 towards her medical bills.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=119}} Gardner's power in Hollywood helped Sinatra get cast in ''[[From Here to Eternity]]'' (1953) and his subsequent [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]] helped revitalize Sinatra's film career.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, pg41&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mia Farrow===

Sinatra married actress [[Mia Farrow]] on July 19, 1966, when she was 21 and he was 50. At the time, Sinatra was enjoying a wave of renewed popularity as the song "[[Strangers in the Night]]" returned him to the top of the ''Billboard'' charts only seventeen days later. They met on the set of Sinatra's film, ''[[Von Ryan's Express]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; She agreed to appear in his 1968 film, ''[[The Detective (1968 film)|The Detective]]'', but when she reneged as her filming schedule for ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'' overran, Sinatra served her divorce papers in front of the cast and crew.&lt;ref&gt;Ingham, p. 81&lt;/ref&gt; They were divorced in Mexico in August 1968. In an interview for the November 2013 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', Farrow said that she and Sinatra "never really split up" and answered "possibly" when asked if her son [[Ronan Farrow|Ronan]] might be Sinatra's.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/10/mia-farrow-children-family-scandal "Exclusive: Mia Farrow and Eight of Her Children Speak Out on Their Lives, Frank Sinatra, and the Scandals They've Endured"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131031041558/http://www.vanityfair.com/online/daily/2013/10/mia-farrow-children-family-scandal |date=2013-10-31 }}. ''Vanity Fair''. October 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Barbara Marx===

On July 11, 1976, Sinatra married [[Barbara Sinatra|Barbara Blakeley Marx]] (1927-2017) (formerly married to [[Zeppo Marx]], the straight man in the [[Marx Brothers|Marx brothers']] act&lt;ref&gt;Nash, Eric P. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9507E4D61531F93BA25751C0A9679C8B63 "Books in Brief: Nonfiction"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', February 18, 2001. Accessed January 7, 2008. "Sinatra's last wife, Barbara Marx, who had been married to Zeppo, ''the unfunny Marx brother,'' is depicted as the wicked stepmother, isolating the aging star from friends and family, persuading him to change his will and failing to notify the children in his last hours."&lt;/ref&gt;), who converted to Catholicism to marry him. She remained his wife until his death, although her relations with Sinatra's children were consistently portrayed as stormy, something [[Nancy Sinatra]] confirmed when she publicly claimed that Barbara had not bothered to call Frank's children even when the end was near, although they were close by, and the children missed the opportunity to be at their father's bedside when he died.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/nancy-sinatra/news/nancy-sinatra-blames-final-wife-for-dad-franks-death Nancy Sinatra - Nancy Sinatra Blames Final Wife For Dad Frank'S Death&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationships==
Sinatra had numerous extra-marital affairs, the first of which was with blonde starlet Alora Gooding from October 1940 while in Hollywood, his "first big love away from home" according to Nick Sevano.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=62-3}} Next followed Rita Maritt, a 16-year-old [[Long Island]] debutante, the daughter of an oil baron, and Mary Lou Watts, a wealthy socialite.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=63-4}} Gossip magazines published details of affairs with the likes of [[Lana Turner]] and [[Marilyn Maxwell]].{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=127}}

===Lana Turner===
Summers and Swan claimed that Turner had gushed of a "very serious affair" between the two, and that they had only faked splitting up their relationship to oblige to MGM's concerns.{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=144}} Turner later denied the claims in her 1992 autobiography, saying that "the closest things to dates Frank and I enjoyed were a few box lunches at MGM".{{Sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=157}}

===Judy Garland===

Sinatra and [[Judy Garland]] remained good friends up until her death in 1969, but on only two occasions were the two legendary singers romantically involved. The first was in 1949, when Garland was recovering from a nervous breakdown and the two went on a romantic rendezvous in the Hamptons (Garland was still married to director [[Vincente Minnelli]]). The second was during one of Garland's many separations from her third husband [[Sid Luft]] in 1955. Sinatra had just come off his messy separation from Ava Gardner and was spotted in Garland's company until Luft found out.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Lauren Bacall===
Sinatra was very close to [[Lauren Bacall]]. According to Kelley, her husband [[Humphrey Bogart]] believed that Sinatra was in love with Bacall and failed to attend the Sands on Bacall's 32nd birthday out of jealousy, though the two men were on good terms.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=265-68}} Sinatra and Bacall were frequently seen together in public throughout 1957, and on March 11, 1958, they reportedly became engaged, though Sinatra denied intending to marry her.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=276}}

===Juliet Prowse===

Sinatra was also engaged to [[India]]-born South African actress and dancer [[Juliet Prowse]] for a short while from fall 1961 to early 1962, before Sinatra broke the engagement late that year because Prowse refused to give up her career. The two first met on the set of the 1960 film ''[[Can-Can (film)|Can-Can]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frank Sinatra: his wives and girlfriends in pictures|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/culturepicturegalleries/10353095/Frank-Sinatras-wives-and-lovers-in-pictures.html?frame=2691534|work=Daily Telegraph}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marilyn Monroe ===

Sinatra met  [[Marilyn Monroe]] in 1954 (while he was still married to Ava Gardner, although some sources say that Sinatra and Monroe first met several years earlier)  and was a friend of Monroe's second husband [[Joe DiMaggio]], and after DiMaggio and Monroe divorced, he joined his friend DiMaggio and the writer [[James Bacon (author)|James Bacon]] on a raid set up by DiMaggio himself in pursuit of his ex-wife (Monroe) and her lover Hal Schafer, and instead of raiding their apartment, they raided the apartment of another woman, whose name was Florence Kotz.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} In summer of 1961, Sinatra saw Monroe again and began an affair with her, and Monroe talked about marrying Sinatra, but Sinatra broke off the affair in fall of 1961 (around the same time he saw Juliet Prowse).{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}}

===Angie Dickinson===

Sinatra was romantically involved with [[Angie Dickinson]] off and on for ten years from around 1954 to 1964. "We had an incredible 'like' for each other" and "a very comfortable relationship", stated Dickinson in 1999, adding that if they'd had "a burning love affair" then the romance might not have lasted as long.{{Citation needed|date=June 2012}} The two remained friends until Sinatra's 1998 death.

==Children==
Sinatra had three children with his first wife, Nancy Barbato: [[Nancy Sinatra]] (born June 8, 1940), [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]] (born January 10, 1944 and died March 16, 2016), and [[Tina Sinatra|Christina "Tina" Sinatra]] (born June 20, 1948). Although Sinatra did not remain faithful to his wife, he was by many accounts a devoted father.

On December 8, 1963, [[Frank Sinatra Jr.]] was [[List of famous kidnappings|kidnapped]].&lt;ref name="jr_kidnapping"&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen|first=Mike|title=Man who stole Sinatra|url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/65576|accessdate=29 September 2010|newspaper=The Roanoke Times|date=18 May 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130202044029/http://www.roanoke.com/news/roanoke/wb/65576|archivedate=2 February 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sinatra paid the kidnappers' $240,000 ransom demand (even offering $1,000,000 though the kidnappers bizarrely turned down this offer), and his son was released unharmed on December 10. Because the kidnappers demanded that Sinatra call them only from [[pay phone]]s, Sinatra carried a roll of dimes with him throughout the ordeal, and this became a lifetime habit. The kidnappers were subsequently apprehended and convicted.&lt;ref name="jr_kidnapping" /&gt; A movie called ''Stealing Sinatra'' was made about the incident. The radio program ''[[This American Life]]'' interviewed one of the kidnappers, [[Barry Keenan]], in the 2002 episode "Plan B".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thisamericanlife.org/radio-archives/episode/205/plan-b | title=205: Plan B | publisher=[[This American Life]] | date=February 1, 2002 | accessdate=May 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Julie Sinatra (born Julie Ann Maria Lyma on February 10, 1943) claims to be Sinatra's daughter through an unacknowledged affair that he had with a showgirl, Dorothy Bunocelli, in the 1940s. She legally changed her last name to Sinatra in 2000.&lt;ref name="Interview with Julie Sinatra"&gt;http://www.dougiethompson.com/frank-sinatra.htm Interview with Julie Sinatra&lt;/ref&gt; Awarded $100,000 by the Sinatra estate in 2002,&lt;ref name="Interview with Julie Sinatra"/&gt; elements of her story concerning her mother's trip to Cuba with Sinatra have been disputed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.contactmusic.com/news.nsf/article/sinatra%20biographers%20question%20new%20lovechild%20claims_1004038 Frank Sinatra - Sinatra Biographers Question New Lovechild Claims&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview for the November 2013 issue of ''Vanity Fair'', Farrow said that she and Sinatra "never really split up" and answered "possibly" when asked if her son [[Ronan Farrow]] might be Sinatra's.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

==Personality==
[[File:Frank Sinatra in 1957.jpg|thumb|right|Sinatra in 1957]]

In his spare time, Sinatra enjoyed listening to classical music, and would attend concerts when he could.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=92}} He also liked opera, particularly [[Luciano Pavarotti]], and told himself, "I'm just a wop baritone. This guy can really sing".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=Introduction xii}} In return, music critic [[Henry Pleasants (music critic)|Henry Pleasants]] said that he had rarely interviewed an opera singer who did not have a collection of Sinatra's recordings.{{sfn|Lees|1998|pp=91-92}} Jo-Caroll Dennison commented that Sinatra had "great inner strength", and that his energy and drive was "enormous". {{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=151}} A workaholic, he reportedly only slept for four hours a night on average.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=16}} Rojek considers him to have been an "overtly sexual performer, caressing the microphone and standing in a suggestive manner".{{Sfn|Rojek|2004|p=31}} Impeccable with his dress{{efn|Sinatra always dressed immaculately, both in his professional and private life. He believed that as he was the best, he had to give his best to the audience, and would wear expensive custom-tailored tuxedos on stage as a sign of respect and to look important.{{sfn|Santopietro|2008|p=53}}}} and cleanliness, while with the Tommy Dorsey band he developed the nickname "Lady Macbeth", because of frequent showering and switching his outfits.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=59}} He enjoyed golf, and would often play with golf champion [[Ken Venturi]] at the course in Palm Springs, where he lived.{{sfn|Sinatra|1986|p=242}}

Throughout his life, Sinatra had mood swings and bouts of mild to severe [[Depression (mood)|depression]],{{sfn|Sinatra|Coplon|2000|p=47}} admitting to an interviewer in the 1950s that "I have an over-acute capacity for sadness as well as elation".{{sfn|Summers|Swan|2010|p=218}} Avoiding solitude and unglamorous surroundings at all costs, he struggled with the conflicting need "to get away from it all, but not too far away."{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|p=485}} [[Anthony Quinn]] once stated that he had a "cruel streak in his personality", but that he still loved him as he was "what all men are and not one man in a million ever is".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=321-22}} Sinatra's mood swings often developed into violence, directed at people he felt had crossed him, particularly journalists who gave him scathing reviews, publicists and photographers. He received negative press for fights with Lee Mortimer in 1947, photographer Eddie Schisser in [[Houston]] in 1950, and Judy Garland's publicist [[Jim Byron]] in 1954, whom he reportedly referred to as a "fucking parasite".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=249-50}} Yet Sinatra was known for his generosity, particularly after his comeback. When [[Lee J. Cobb]] nearly died from a heart attack in June 1955, Sinatra flooded him with "books, flowers, delicacies", paid his hospital bills, and visited him daily, telling him that his finest acting was yet to come.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=251-52}} In another instance, after a heated argument with manager Bobby Burns, rather than apologize, Sinatra bought him a brand new [[Cadillac]].{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=53}}

In a 1963 interview with ''[[Playboy]]'' magazine, Sinatra stated that his belief in God was similar to [[Albert Schweitzer]], [[Bertrand Russell#Views on religion|Bertrand Russell]] and [[Albert Einstein's religious views|Albert Einstein]] in that had a "respect for life&amp;nbsp;– in any form", but didn't believe in "a personal God to whom I look for comfort or for a natural on the next roll of the dice".&lt;ref name=religion&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sinatrafamily.com/forum/showthread.php/29275-Frank-Sinatra-s-1963-Playboy-Magazine-Interview|title=Frank Sinatra's February 1963 Playboy Magazine Interview|last=Hyams|first=Joe|date=February 1963|work=[[Playboy]]|accessdate=August 19, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Kelley, he was critical of the church on numerous occasions, and had thought it hypocritical in Hoboken that Italians had to attend a different church from the Irish and Germans.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=493}} Though turned off by organized religion at times, however, Sinatra had a deep faith that became public when he turned to the Catholic Church for healing after his mother died in a plane crash late in his career. He died as a practicing Catholic and had a Catholic burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20125409,00.html|title=A Swinger with Swagger|work=People|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cal Neva Lodge==
In 1960, Sinatra bought a share in the [[Cal Neva Lodge &amp; Casino]], straddling the border between Nevada and California on the shores of [[Lake Tahoe]]. Though it only opened between June and September, Sinatra built the Celebrity Room theater, which attracted the likes of the other Rat Pack members, [[Red Skelton]], [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[Victor Borge]], [[Joe E. Lewis]], [[Lucille Ball]],  [[Lena Horne]], Juliet Prowse,  the [[McGuire Sisters]] and others. By 1962 he reportedly held a 50% share in the hotel.{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=347-48, 355}} Sinatra's gambling license was temporarily stripped by the [[Nevada Gaming Control Board]] in 1963 after mobster Sam Giancana was spotted on the premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Griffith |first=Martin |url=https://www.usatoday.com/travel/destinations/2010-03-31-lake-tahoe-rat-pack-casino_N.htm |title=Frank Sinatra's Lake Tahoe casino shuts down |work=USA Today |date=March 31, 2010 |accessdate=July 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to ongoing pressure from the FBI and Nevada Gaming Commission and mobster control of casinos,  and trouble with the [[American Mafia|Mafia]],  Sinatra agreed to give up his share in Cal Neva and the Sands.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=362}}

==Alleged organized-crime links==

[[File:LuckyLucianoSmaller.jpeg|thumb|upright|Mugshot of mobster [[Lucky Luciano]] in 1936]]
Sinatra became the stereotype of the "tough [[working-class]] [[Italian American]]", something which he embraced. He commented that he would "probably have ended in a life of crime" if it had not been for his interest in music.{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=50}} According to one writer, [[Eddie Fisher (singer)|Eddie Fisher]] once remarked that Sinatra "wanted to be a hood" and had once told him that "I'd rather be a don of the [[American Mafia|Mafia]] than president of the United States". However, Peter Lawford had said that Sinatra only referred to them as the "boys" or "the Outfit", rather than the "Mafia".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=294-5}}

In Sinatra's early days, mafia boss [[Willie Moretti]] helped him for kickbacks and was reported to have intervened in releasing him from his contract with Tommy Dorsey.{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=420}} Sinatra was present at the Mafia [[Havana Conference]] in 1946,{{sfn|Sifakis|2005|p=419}} and one newspaper published the headline "Shame, Sinatra" regarding his connection with [[Lucky Luciano]].{{sfn|Lahr|2000|p=63}} Kelley claims that [[Phyllis McGuire]] referred to [[Sam Giancana]] and Sinatra as the "best of friends", saying that they would often play golf together in Nevada and visit each other.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=296}} She also quotes Jo-Carrol Silvers in saying that both Sinatra and her husband Phil Silvers "adored [[Bugsy Siegel]] so much", and would boast to friends about him and how many people he had killed. She also claimed that Silvers had told her that "like Bugsy, Frank had a Mafia Redneck mentality", with their shared love of high-living and grandiose plans in Las Vegas.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=124-5}} Kelley claims that Sinatra and mobster Joseph Fischetti had been good friends from 1938 onward, and acted like "Sicilian brothers".{{sfn|Kelley|1986|p=135}} She also states that Sinatra and Hank Sanicola were financial partners in the gossip magazine ''Hollywood Night Life'' with [[Mickey Cohen]], a West Coast mobster; she claims that Sinatra funded $15,000 into the magazine to "get back at Hollywood".{{Sfn|Kelley|1986|p=176}}
[[File:Bugsy Siegel.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Mugshot of [[Bugsy Siegel]] in 1928]]

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] kept records amounting to 2,403 pages on Sinatra, becoming a natural target with his alleged Mafia ties, his ardent [[New Deal]] politics, and his friendship with [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1075739|title=Sinatra: The FBI Files|publisher=NPR|accessdate=June 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; They kept him under surveillance for almost five decades beginning in the 1940s. The documents include accounts of Sinatra as the target of death threats and [[extortion]] schemes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/daily/march99/sinatra7.htm|title=AKA Frank Sinatra|publisher=The Washington Post Magazine|accessdate=June 14, 2008|date=March 6, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI documented that Sinatra was losing esteem with the Mafia as he grew closer to President Kennedy, whose brother Bobby was leading a crackdown on organized crime. They wiretapped Giancana's conversations, and found that Giancana no longer trusted Sinatra after he had been spotted with Kennedy.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=327-9}} Their purported friendship finally came to an end in 1963 following the Nevada Gaming Commission's investigation into the casinos. According to Kelley, Giancana blamed Sinatra for the ordeal.{{sfn|Kelley|1986|pp=363-64}}

The FBI's secret dossier on Sinatra was released in 1998 in response to [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] requests.{{sfn|Kaplan|2011|pp=446-7}} Sinatra frequently denied personal and professional links with [[organized crime]] figures such as Bugsy Siegel, [[Carlo Gambino]], Sam Giancana, Lucky Luciano, and Joseph Fischetti,&lt;ref name=mafia&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/special_report/1998/05/98/sinatra/94360.stm|title=Mafia reports dogged Sinatra|date=May 15, 1998|accessdate=May 15, 2008|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; despite the many connections and anecdotes reported. He vehemently declared that "any report that I fraternised with goons or racketeers is a vicious lie".{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=49}} In January 1967, he stood before a Las Vegas grand jury investigating mobster influence in the casinos and denied any financial exploits with Giancana.{{sfn|McNally|2015|p=49}}

'''Ruth Eisemann Schier''' (born 1941 or 1942&lt;ref name="trutv"&gt;[http://www.crimelibrary.com/gangsters_outlaws/outlaws/gary_krist/4.html The Einstein of Crime], the story of [[Gary Stephen Krist]] from a [[truTV]] website&lt;!--She was 26 in Sept 1968--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;) was the first woman to appear on the [[FBI]]'s [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives|Ten Most Wanted list]].  

==Biography==
Schier was born in [[Honduras]], the daughter of [[Austria]]n-[[Jewish refugees]] living there after escaping [[Nazi]] persecution. She was a graduate of [[National University of Mexico]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900442-2,00.html The Girl in the Box], a December 27, 1968 article from ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine&lt;/ref&gt; and was a graduate student at the [[University of Miami]]'s [[Rosenstiel School of Marine and Atmospheric Science|Institute of Marine Science]] when she met [[Gary Stephen Krist]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,900496,00.html Making an Impact], a January 3, 1969 article from ''[[Time magazine]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Schier was [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives by year, 1968|added to the list in 1968]], for participating in the [[kidnapping]]-for-ransom of land heiress [[Barbara Jane Mackle]] in [[Decatur, Georgia]] in a plan concocted by her boyfriend, Krist. He was arrested two days later, but Schier eluded police for 79 days before being apprehended in [[Norman, Oklahoma]] on March 5, 1969.&lt;ref name="trutv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |agency= |title=Woman on F.B.I.'s Wanted List Is Seized in Georgia Kidnapping.

While Schier was in prison, [[Gene Miller]], in collaboration with Mackle, wrote about the crime in ''83 Hours Till Dawn''.&lt;ref&gt;''83 Hours Till Dawn'' ({{LCCN|74139045}})&lt;/ref&gt; Schier served four years of her sentence and was [[parole]]d in 1973 on condition of [[deportation]] to her native [[Honduras]].

'''Shay Healy''' (born March 1943) is an [[Irish people|Irish]] songwriter, broadcaster and journalist. He is best known for his role as host of [[Nighthawks (TV series)|''Nighthawks'']], a [[RTÉ Television]] chat show of the late 1980s and early 1990s, and for composing "[[What's Another Year]]", Ireland's winning entry in the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 Eurovision Song Contest]].

==Early life==
Shay Healy was raised along with his five siblings in [[Sandymount]] in [[Dublin]]. His father, Seamus, was a civil servant and part-time stage actor who performed at the [[Abbey Theatre|Abbey]] and [[Olympia Theatre, Dublin|Olympia]] theatres. His mother, Máirín Ní Shúilleabháin, was a singer of [[Folk music of Ireland|Irish traditional songs]].&lt;ref name="name4"&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Shay Healy", 26 July 1980&lt;/ref&gt; She also wrote plays and stories and encouraged young Shay's early talent for writing. This led to his first appearance at the age of fifteen on the Irish national radio station, [[RTÉ Radio 1|Radió Éireann]], reading a self-penned article.&lt;ref&gt;''On The Road'', p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Healy has had a varied career to date, never focusing too intently on any one of his various professional interests. Of his tendency to diversify he has commented: "I know it infuriates some people when you don't pigeonhole yourself, but I don't take on anything that won't stand up to public scrutiny."&lt;ref name="name1"/&gt;

===Songwriting===
Healy first received attention as a performer of his own "songs of social significance" during the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Dublin Folk and Ballad Concert", 10 October 1966&lt;/ref&gt; Later he wrote comedy songs for [[Billy Connolly]],&lt;ref name="name4"/&gt; including "The Orient Express-a tale of intrigue and cross dressing", "The Shitkickers Waltz", and "The Country &amp; Western Supersong".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obrien.ie/music/on-the-road|title=The O'Brien Press - On the Road - From Tara to Tiananmen Square by way of Chuck Berry By Shay Healy|author=|date=|website=www.obrien.ie|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Healy achieved his greatest success as a songwriter with "What's Another Year", which won the [[Eurovision Song Contest 1980|1980 Eurovision Song Contest]]. Over the course of the next fifteen years, the song earned him a total of £250,000.&lt;ref name="name2"&gt;''The Irish Times'', "THE MULTI-MEDIA ARTIST: Shay Healy", 28 December 1995&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983 his song, "Edge Of The Universe", sung by [[Linda Martin]], was the overall winner of the [[Castlebar Song Contest]]. Under the name of '''Crack''', he and Dave Pennefather released a [[Parody music|parody song]] called "Silly Fellow", which was about [[Paul McCartney]]'s arrest and jail experience in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishrock.org/irodb/bands/healy-shay.html|title=Irish Rock Discography: Shay Healy|author=|date=|website=www.irishrock.org|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{unreliable source?|date=December 2013}}

===Musical theatre===
In 1977, Healy branched into musical theatre with the script, co-written with [[Niall Toibin]], for a stage production entitled ''The King''. This was a show based on the life and music of [[Elvis Presley]] and was premiered at the [[Cork Opera House]] two months after the singer's death.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "'The King' at the Cork Opera House", 18 October 1977&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Healy's [[rock opera]], ''The Knowledge'', failed to receive commercial backing and was premiered in [[Dundalk]] by an amateur group in January 1989.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Broadway? No, try Dundalk", 14 January 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

Healy was more successful with his musical, ''The Wiremen'', which received its premiere on 4 May 2005 at Dublin's [[Gaiety Theatre, Dublin|Gaiety Theatre]] in a production by John McColgan and [[Moya Doherty]] that ran for six weeks. ''The Wiremen'' tells the story of the introduction of electricity into [[County Mayo]] during the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Singing power to the people", 7 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2010 the show was revived in an amateur production by the [[Birr, County Offaly|Birr]] Stage Guild.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.offalyexpress.ie/notes/Birr.6163298.jp|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120918021711/http://www.offalyexpress.ie/notes/Birr.6163298.jp|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 September 2012|title=''Offaly Express'', March 18, 2010|author=|date=|website=offalyexpress.ie|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasting===
Healy joined [[RTÉ Television]] in 1963 as a trainee cameraman.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Countdowns, cameras and orgies", 21 December 1991&lt;/ref&gt; Within five years he had moved to the other side of the lens with appearances on programmes such as ''Twenty Minutes With...'', ''Ballad Sheet'' and ''Hoot'nany''.

Between 1988 and 1992 Healy hosted [[Nighthawks (TV series)|''Nighthawks'']], a late-night satirical chat show broadcast on [[RTÉ Two]], which he later described as "the best four years of my working life".&lt;ref&gt;''On The Road'', p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1992, the show became embroiled in political controversy as a result of Healy's interview with former [[Fianna Fáil]] [[Minister for Justice and Equality|Justice Minister]] [[Seán Doherty (Roscommon politician)|Seán Doherty]]. During the interview, Doherty revealed that some members of the cabinet with whom he served in [[Government of the 23rd Dáil|1982]] had been aware of his order to [[Irish phone tapping scandal (1983)|
illegally tap the phones of a number of Irish journalists]]. The revelation led to the resignation of [[Taoiseach]] [[Charles Haughey]] a few weeks later.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Obscure hints on 'Nighthawks' led to Haughey's darkest hour", 25 January 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Irish Examiner'', "Telephone bugs that toppled a Taoiseach", 10 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1995, RTÉ terminated Healy's contract.&lt;ref name="name2"/&gt; One of his last shows for the station was ''Where Are They Now?'' in which he interviewed former celebrities whose fame had largely faded.&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "RTE makes home-produced television drama 'a priority'", 9 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Healy then set up his own production company which made a series of television documentaries. His 1995 TV documentary on Irish musician, [[Phil Lynott]], ''The Rocker'', was broadcast on [[RTÉ Two]] and [[BBC Two]], and later released as a DVD.&lt;ref name="name2"/&gt; In 1998, Healy made two half-hour documentaries for the RTÉ One television series, ''Against The Odds''. The series focused on individuals who had overcome adversity in their lives. Healy's two films featured an actor, Chris Burke, who was born with [[dwarfism]], and a singer, [[Ronan Tynan]], whose legs were amputated when he was twenty.&lt;ref name="name1"&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Success in a small way", 7 March 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the other TV programmes Healy presented were ''Reach For The Stars'' (1971), ''Hullaballoo'' (1977), ''The Birthday Show'' (1993-1995), and ''Beastly Behaviour'' (1998-1999).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/archives/profiles/healy-shay/|title=Healy, Shay|author=|date=|website=RTÉ Archives|accessdate=22 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Healy has won two [[Jacob's Awards]]. He received the first in 1984 for ''Strawberry Fields Forever'', a radio documentary series on the 1960s in Ireland, which he presented and Siobhan McHugh produced. His second award came in 1989 for his television work.

In 2007, Healy joined the judging panel on [[TG4]]'s talent show, ''[[Glór Tíre]]''.

===Writing===
In the early 1960s, Healy became Folk Correspondent for ''Spotlight'', an Irish pop music weekly, and he continued to write for the magazine until its demise in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;''On The Road'', pp. 23–4&lt;/ref&gt; He currently writes a weekly column for the ''[[Irish Daily Mail]]''.

''The Stunt'' is the title of Healy's debut novel, published in 1992. It deals with the Irish rock scene and was described by one reviewer as "a more truthful... representation (of) the Irish music scene than ''[[The Commitments (novel)|The Commitments]]''".&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Times'', "Live rock", 6 March 1993&lt;/ref&gt; His second novel, ''Green Card Blues'', is set among the illegal Irish immigrant community in New York City.

In 2005 ''On The Road'', Healy's memoir of his life in showbusiness, was published.

==Personal life==
Healy was married to Dymphna Errity from September 1967&lt;ref&gt;''On The Road'', p. 32&lt;/ref&gt; up to her death on 10 July 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.superannrte.ie/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5802:death-of-dympna-healy-wife-of-colleague-shay-healy&amp;catid=31&amp;Itemid=104 superannRTE.ie] (accessed 25 September 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; They have two sons, Oisin and Fionain.&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Independent'', "What's another decade?", 21 December 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Healy was diagnosed with the degenerative disorder, [[Parkinson's disease]].&lt;ref&gt;''Sunday Independent'', "Presenting with Parkinson's", 18 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

== Congressional career ==

=== House of Representatives ===

Before being elected to the Senate in 1998, she represented the district of [[Malabon City]]-[[Navotas, Metro Manila|Navotas]] at the [[House of Representatives of the Philippines|House of Representatives]] for three consecutive terms, from 1987-1998.

At the Lower House, she authored, and co-authored about 280 bills (79 were enacted into laws) and proposed 101 local and national resolutions (20 were adopted). She became the Assistant Majority Floor Leader during the [[8th Congress of the Philippines|8th Congress]] in 1987 and during the [[10th Congress of the Philippines|10th Congress]] in 1995, becoming the first woman Assistant Majority Floor Leader in the history of the Lower House.

Oreta ran as Congresswoman in Malabon in the 2016 elections; but lost to former representative Frederico "Ricky" Sandoval II.

=== Senate ===

In the [[Philippine general election, 1998|1998 National Elections]], she was elected senator under the opposition [[Laban ng Makabayang Masang Pilipino]] (LAMMP) banner. In the three years she was in office, Senator Aquino-Oreta filed 197 [[Senate Bill]]s (authored and co-authored) and resolutions.

She participated in the [[EDSA 2|impeachment trial]] of former president [[Joseph Estrada]] and was one of the senators who voted against the opening of the so-called "second envelope." After the vote, she was caught on camera doing a jig, which earned her the nickname "dancing queen" and offended some people. She apologized for the incident in a widely-broadcast political advertisement.  She subsequently ran for the Senate and was defeated. She has not been elected to public office since.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gmanews.tv/story/35540/In-new-TV-ad-Tessie-Oreta-says-sorry-for-dancing-queen-episode GMANews.TV - Tessie Oreta: Sorry for 'dancing queen' episode - Nation - Official Website of GMA News and Public Affairs - Latest Philippine News - BETA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mb.com.ph/issues/2007/03/27/MAIN2007032790553.html Manila Bulletin Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas H. Chilton''' (August 14, 1899 – September 15, 1972) was a [[chemical engineer]] and professor. He is considered a founder of modern [[chemical engineering]] practice and lectured widely around the world. He received numerous awards, including an honorary [[doctorate]] and the [[President's Certificate of Merit]]. In 1994, [[DuPont]] named a laboratory in [[Wilmington, Delaware]] for him.

== Biography ==
Thomas Hamilton Chilton was born in [[Greensboro, Alabama]], son of a [[Methodist Episcopal]] clergyman, poet and hymnodist,&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;George E. Holbrook, [http://www.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=578&amp;page=19 Biography of Thomas Hamilton Chilton] ''Memorial Tributes: National Academy of Engineering'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;1, pp. 19-25 (1979). The National Academies Press. Retrieved May 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Claudius Lysias Chilton, and Mabel Pierce Chilton. He was given the middle name Hamilton to honor a friend of the family.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}} Chilton grew up in [[Montgomery, Alabama]] with the peculiar distinction of being the ninth child of a ninth child of a ninth child. Two older brothers founded Paragon Press and put him to work at a printing press, [[typesetting|setting type]] by hand, which taught him to be attentive to detail.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He attended [[Sidney Lanier High School]] in Montgomery, where he heard an employee of [[Thomas Edison]] explain how to make synthetic [[phonograph record]]s. This sparked an interest in chemical engineering.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Chilton attended the [[University of Alabama]] for two semesters, quitting to earn money for tuition. He moved to New York City&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; in 1917, moving in with his eldest brother. He attended [[Columbia University]], graduating in 1922 with a degree in chemical engineering.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He began work as a research chemist in New York, receiving his first patent.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; In 1925, he joined [[DuPont]] in [[Wilmington, Delaware]], beginning what became a 35-year career leading its chemical research.&lt;ref name="dupont"&gt;[http://www2.dupont.com/Heritage/en_US/1930s_dupont/1930s_indepth.html "Chemical Engineering: 1930's"] DuPont. Retrieved May 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Chilton began his career just as chemical engineering was becoming established as its own discipline&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dupont" /&gt; and he is considered to be one of the founders of modern chemical engineering practice.&lt;ref name="award"&gt;[http://www.erpt.org/wilmsect/chilton.html "The Thomas H. Chilton Award"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927173339/http://www.erpt.org/wilmsect/chilton.html |date=2011-09-27 }} Educational Resources for Particle Technology. Retrieved May 8, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He and a colleague developed the [[Chilton and Colburn J-factor analogy|Chilton-Colburn analogy]], which became a fundamental principle of chemical engineering.&lt;ref name="dupont" /&gt; Chilton was known for his work on [[fluid flow]], [[heat transfer]], [[distillation]] and [[absorption (chemistry)|absorption]].&lt;ref name="c&amp;en"&gt;[http://pubs.acs.org/doi/pdf/10.1021/cen-v037n035.p100 "Chilton Retires" (abstract)] Chemical &amp; Engineering News Archives (August 31, 1959). Retrieved May 9, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; He began lecturing at universities in 1937.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Chilton worked at DuPont from 1925–1959, leading its chemical research. During [[World War II]], he worked with the [[Manhattan Project]] and he was involved with the original design of the first [[atomic energy]] plant, the [[Hanford Engineer Works]]. At the invitation of his colleague and friend, [[Enrico Fermi]],{{citation needed |date=May 2011}} Chilton was among the select group of scientists to witness the first self-sustaining [[nuclear reaction]] at [[Stagg Field]] on December 2, 1942. After the war, he became involved in the [[Savannah River Plant]], then the largest [[nuclear power]] plant ever built by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Upon his retirement, Chilton, who was known for being very particular about punctuation, was presented by his co-workers with a book that was entirely bereft of punctuation until the back of the book, where there was a page of periods, commas, [[semicolon]]s, colons and other punctuation, accompanied by an invitation for him to insert them at his discretion.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Chilton was active in the [[American Institute of Chemical Engineers]]&lt;ref name="award" /&gt; and served as its president in 1951.&lt;ref name="dupont" /&gt; Following his career at DuPont, Chilton was a [[visiting professor]] and lecturer all over the world, including the [[University of Kyoto]] and [[Nagoya University]], where he was a [[Fulbright]] lecturer; the [[University of New South Wales]] in Australia; and universities in [[Toulouse]] and [[Nancy, France]], again as a Fulbright lecturer.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He also lectured at the [[Birla Institute of Technology]] in [[Pilani]], India and the [[University of Natal]] in [[South Africa]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; His stints at American universities included the [[University of California, Berkeley]], [[Georgia Tech]], the [[University of Delaware]], the [[University of Washington]], the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]] and the University of Alabama.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Chilton died in [[Bonn]], Germany while traveling with his second wife.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Awards and recognition ==
Chilton was awarded an [[honorary degree|honorary]] [[Doctor of Science]] from the [[University of Delaware]] in 1943.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; He received several awards from his [[alma mater]], the Charles Frederick Chandler Medal in 1939, the Egleston Medal in 1942 and in 1950, the [[University Medal]], which was presented to him by President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; In 1948, he received the [[President's Certificate of Merit]] for his contributions to the [[National Defense Research Committee]]. Chilton was posthumously awarded the [[Lavoisier Medal]] for excellence. In 1994, the building where he had conducted much of his work for DuPont was named after him.&lt;ref name="award" /&gt;

== Personal ==
Chilton spoke fluent French and enjoyed [[classical music]]. He had a collection of [[Reversal film|photographic slides]] from his world travels. As a boy Tomas began the hobby of collecting [[automobile license plate]]s. Eventually, he was recognized as having the world's largest collection (some 4,500) from all over the United States and around the world. In 1967, an article about this amazing collection appeared in [[Sports Illustrated]].&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; His first wife was Cherridah McLemore and after her death, he married Elizabeth C. Rhinehart, who, along with her late husband, had been friends of the Chiltons for decades.

Thomas H. Chilton is a grandson of [[William Parish Chilton]], a member of the congress of the [[Confederate States of America]] and the [[Chief Justice]] of the [[Alabama Supreme Court]]. In 1967 he published a genealogical reference called "Antecedents and Descendants of William Parish Chilton, 1810 - 1871". "&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt; [[Bart Chilton]], a former commissioner on the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], is his grandson.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704463504575301100366245966 CFTC's Energy-Industry Gadfly Gets His Way"] ''The Wall Street Journal'' (June 12, 2010).

[[Old Norse]] '''Yngvi''', [[Old High German]] '''Inguin''' and [[Old English]] '''Ingƿine''' are names that relate to a [[Lists of deities|theonym]] which appears to have been the older name for the god [[Freyr]]. [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] '''*Ingwaz''' was the legendary ancestor of the [[Ingaevones]], or more accurately ''Ingvaeones'', and is also the reconstructed name of the [[Elder Futhark]] [[runes|rune]] ᛜ and [[Anglo-Saxon runes|Anglo-Saxon]] rune ᛝ, representing ''ŋ''.

A [[torc]], the so-called "[[Ring of Pietroassa]]", part of a late third to fourth century [[Goths|Gothic]] [[hoard]] discovered in [[Romania]], is inscribed in much-damaged runes, one reading of which is ''gutanī [i(ng)]wi[n] hailag'' "to Ingwi[n] of the Goths holy".&lt;ref name="North1997"&gt;{{cite book|last=North|first=Richard|title=Heathen Gods in Old English Literature|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X_LKUIqNvPQC&amp;pg=PP140|year=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-55183-0|page=132 and note 16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{further|Fraujaz}}
Old Norse ''Yngvi'' as well as Old High German ''Inguin'' and Old English ''Ingƿine'' are all derived from the [[Proto-Germanic language|Proto-Germanic]] *Ingwaz. Sound changes in late-Proto-Germanic transformed *Ingwaz into *Ingwi(z) in the [[nominative case]] and *''Ingwin'' in the [[accusative case]]. That his epithet *[[Fraujaz]] appears in Old Norse compounds ''Ingvifreyr'' and ''Ingunarfreyr'', as well as in Old English ''fréa inguina'', both of which mean 'Lord of the Inguins', i.&amp;nbsp;e. the god [[Freyr]], strongly indicates that the two deities are either the same or were syncretized at some very early period in the Germanic migration (or possibly before). The Ingvaeones, who occupied a territory roughly equivalent to modern [[Denmark]], [[Frisia]] and the [[Low Countries]] at the turn of the millennium, were mentioned by [[Pliny the Elder]] in his ''[[Natural History (Pliny)|Natural Histories]]'' as one of "five Germanic tribes". [[Tacitus]] asserts their descent from the three sons of [[Mannus]] or *[[Mannaz]], the Proto-Germanic 'first man', of whom *Ingwaz may have been one. Other names that retain the [[theonym]] are ''Inguiomerus'' or ''[[Ingemar]]'' and ''[[Yngling]]'', the name of an old Scandinavian dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. for a grammar of Proto-Germanic from the University of Texas at Austin: {{cite web |url=http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/pgmc03.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-03-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070623163039/http://www.utexas.edu/cola/centers/lrc/books/pgmc03.html#3_7_1 |archivedate=2007-06-23 |df= }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''{{transl|Runr|ŋ}}'' rune [[Image:Runic letter ingwaz.svg|frameless|12px]] (with variants [[Image:Runic letter ingwaz variant.svg|frameless|12px]] and [[Image:Runic letter ingwaz variant.png|frameless|12px]]) together with [[Peorð]] and [[Eihwaz]] is among the problematic cases of runes of uncertain derivation unattested in early inscriptions. The rune first appears independently on the ''futhark'' row of the [[Kylver Stone]], and is altogether unattested as an independent rune outside of such rows. There are a number of attestations of the ''{{transl|Runr|i&amp;#x361;ŋ}}'' [[bind rune]] [[Image:ing bindrune.png|frameless|12px]] or [[Image:Ing bindrune variant.png|frameless|12px]] (the "lantern rune", similar in shape to the Anglo-Saxon  [[Jēran|gēr]] rune {{runic|ᛄ}}), but its identification is disputed in most cases, since the same sign may also be a [[cipher runes|cipher rune]] of [[wynn]] or [[thurisaz]]. The earliest case of such an ''{{transl|Runr|i&amp;#x361;ŋ}}'' bindrune of reasonably certain reading is the inscription ''{{transl|Runr|mari&amp;#x361;ŋs}}'' (perhaps referring to the "Mærings" or [[Ostrogoths]]) on the silver buckle of Szabadbattyán, dated to the first half 5th century and conserved at the [[Hungarian National Museum]] in Budapest.&lt;ref&gt;J.H. Looijenga, [http://dissertations.ub.rug.nl/FILES/faculties/arts/1997/j.h.looijenga/thesis.pdf ''Runes Around The North Sea And On The Continent Ad 150-700''], Ph.D. dissertation, [[Groningen]] 1997, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Old English rune poem]] contains these obscure lines:

:{{runic|ᛝ}} ''{{lang|ang|Ing ƿæs ærest mid Eástdenum}}''
:''{{lang|ang|geseƿen secgum, oð he síððan eást}}''
:''{{lang|ang|ofer ƿæg geƿát. ƿæn æfter ran.}}''
:''{{lang|ang|þus Heardingas þone hæle nemdon.}}''

:"{{runic|ᛝ}} Ing was first amidst the [[East Danes]]
:so seen, until he went eastward
:over the sea. His wagon ran after.
:Thus the Heardings named that hero."

== Norse mythology ==
In [[Norse mythology]], Yngvi, alternatively spelled Yngve, was the progenitor of the [[Yngling]] lineage, a legendary dynasty of [[Sweden|Swedish]] kings, from whom also the earliest historical [[Norway|Norwegian]] kings claimed to be descended. Yngvi is a name of the god [[Freyr]], perhaps Freyr's true name, as ''freyr'' means 'lord' and has probably evolved from a common invocation of the god.

In the ''[[Íslendingabók]]'' (written in the early twelfth century by the Icelandic priest [[Ari Þorgilsson]]) ''Yngvi Tyrkja konungr'' 'Yngvi king of [[Seljuq dynasty|Turkey]]' appears as the father of [[Njörðr]] who in turn is the father of Yngvi-Freyr, ancestor of the Ynglings. According to the ''[[Skjöldunga saga]]'' (a lost epic from 1180–1200, saved only partially in other sagas and later translation) [[Odin]] came from Asia and conquered Northern Europe. He gave Sweden to his son Yngvi and Denmark to his son [[Skjöldr]]. Since then the kings of Sweden were called Ynglings and those of Denmark [[Scylding|Skjöldungs]].

In the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' (late twelfth century, by [[Saxo Grammaticus]]) and in the ''[[Ynglinga saga]]'' (ca. 1225, by [[Snorri Sturluson]]), Freyr is euhemerized as a king of Sweden. In the ''Ynglinga saga'', Yngvi-Freyr reigned in succession to his father [[Njörðr]] who had&amp;nbsp;– in this variant&amp;nbsp;– succeeded Odin. In the ''[[Historia Norwegiæ]]'' (written around 1211), in contrast, Ingui is the first king of Sweden, and the father of a certain [[Njörðr|Neorth]], in his turn the father of [[Freyr|Froyr]]: "Rex itaque Ingui, quem primum Swethiæ monarchiam rexisse plurimi astruunt, genuit Neorth, qui vero genuit Froy; hos ambos tota illorum posteritas per longa sæcula ut deos venerati sunt. Froyr vero genuit Fiolni, qui in dolio medonis dimersus est […]"

In the introduction to his ''[[Edda]]'' (originally composed around 1220) Snorri Sturluson claimed again that Odin reigned in Sweden and relates: "Odin had with him one of his sons called Yngvi, who was king in Sweden after him; and those houses come from him that are named Ynglings." Snorri here does not identify Yngvi and Freyr, although Freyr occasionally appears elsewhere as a [[sons of Odin|son of Odin]] instead of a son of Njörðr.

In the ''[[Skáldskaparmál]]'' section of his ''[[Prose Edda]]'' Snorri brings in the ancient king [[Halfdan the Old]] who is the father of nine sons whose names are all words meaning "king" or "lord" in [[Old Norse]], as well as of nine other sons who are the forefathers of various royal lineages, including "Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are descended". But rather oddly Snorri immediately follows this with information on what should be four other personages who were not sons of Halfdan but who also fathered dynasties, and names the first of these again as "Yngvi, from whom the Ynglings are descended". In the related account in the ''Ættartolur'' "Genealogies" attached to ''[[Hversu Noregr byggðist]]'', the name ''Skelfir'' appears instead of ''Yngvi'' in the list of Halfdan's sons.

The ''Ynglinga Saga'' section of Snorri's ''[[Heimskringla]]'' (around 1230) introduces a second Yngvi, son of [[Alaric and Eric|Alrekr]], who is a descendant of Yngvi-Freyr and who shared the Swedish kingship with his brother Álf (''see'' [[Yngvi and Alf]]).

==Given names and family names==
The element ''Ing(o)-'' was widely used in [[Germanic name]]s from an early period; it is not clear whether it originally referred to the [[Ingaevones]], or to the god Yngwi directly. ''[[Inguiomer]]'' was a relative of the Cheruscan [[Arminius]] in the first century. ''Ingundis'' was a wife of the Frankish king [[Chlothar I]], whose son [[Charibert I]] married an ''Ingoberga'' (all in the sixth century). Other combinations such as masculine ''Inguin'', ''Ingulf'', ''Ingobald'', feminine ''Inghildis'', ''Ingedrudis'', ''Ingoflidis'', as well as the short forms ''Ingo'' (masculine) and ''Inga'' (feminine) are recorded in the early medieval period (seventh to ninth centuries).&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Förstemann, [https://archive.org/stream/altdeutschesnam00frgoog#page/n412/mode/1up 780-787 ''Altdeutsches namenbuch''], vol. 1, Fürstemann: Nordhausen 1856, col. 779 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; In Scandinavia and Germany, and areas where these groups settled, names beginning with ''Ing'' survived into modern usage, e.g.[[Ingmar (disambiguation)|Ingmar]], [[Ingvar]], [[Ingvild]], [[Ingeborg]], [[Ingrid (given name)|Ingrid]], [[Ingegerd]] and the family name Ingalls.

{{Japanese name|Komaki}}
{{nihongo|'''Ōmi Komaki'''|小牧 近江|Komaki Ōmi|extra=11 May 1894 – 29 October 1978}} was the [[pen-name]] of a scholar and translator of [[French literature]] in [[Taishō period|Taishō]] and [[Shōwa period]] Japan. His real name was '''Komaki Ōmiya'''.

==Early life==
Komaki was born in what is now part of [[Akita, Akita|Akita city]], [[Akita prefecture]], as the son of a politician. He dropped out of middle school in order to accompany his father to an international conference of legislators in France, and stayed on, working his way through the Law Department of [[Paris University]]. He was greatly influenced by the philosophy of [[Romain Rolland]] and the ''[[Clarté (France)|Clarté]]'' ("Clarity") movement of the French novelist, [[Henri Barbusse]], which encouraged him to participate in [[pacifist]] activities.

==Literary career==
Komaki returned to Japan in 1919 and founded the [[literary magazine]] ''[[Tane Maku Hito]]'' ("The Sowers") in October 1921, named after the famous painting by the French artist [[Jean-François Millet]]. He used this as his platform to promote his [[pacifist]] and [[Marxist]] ideals through poems and essays, many of which he wrote. He was one of the first Japanese members of [[Comintern]], and a pioneer in the [[Proletarian literature]] movement. The movement attracted the attention of [[Arishima Takeo]], and other noted leftist writers. In 1924 another literary magazine ''Bungei Sensen'' ("Literary Battlefront") spun out from the original ''Tane Maku Hito'' group.

When Komaki had spare time from promoting [[communist revolution]] and avoiding the [[Tokubetsu Kōtō Keisatsu|thought police]], he worked at translating works of [[French literature]] into [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. His most noted works are translations of [[Charles-Louis Philippe]]'s ''Dans la Petite Ville'' and [[André Gide]]'s biography, ''Charles-Louis Philippe''.

After World War II, Komaki became a professor at [[Hosei University]], and continued to pursue his pacifist and Marxist philosophies.

His works include ''Ikoku no Senso'' (Other Countries’ Wars) and ''Furansu Kakumei Yobanashi'' (Evening Conversations on the [[French Revolution]]).
 
Komaki relocated from Tokyo to [[Kamakura, Kanagawa|Kamakura]], [[Kanagawa prefecture]] in 1925. He later spent some years in [[French Indochina]], but returned after World War II to Kamakura, where he lived until his death in 1978 at the age of 84.
