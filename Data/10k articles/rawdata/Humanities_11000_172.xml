'''''26 October 1993''''' is an artwork created in 1993 as a collaboration between English artists [[Henry Bond]] and [[Sam Taylor-Johnson|Sam Taylor-Wood]], both of whom were involved in the [[Young British Artists]] scene of contemporary art. It is a [[pastiche]] or remaking of a well-known photographic portrait of [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] that was made by [[Annie Leibovitz#John Lennon 1980|Annie Leibovitz]] a few hours before [[Death of John Lennon|Lennon's murder]].

==Production and critical reception==
[[Image:Annie Leibovitz Lennon Ono December 1980.jpg|thumb|left|125px|Annie Leibovitz's original 1980 photo.]]
[[Image:Rolling Stone January 22 1981 cover.png|thumb|left|125px|Annie Leibovitz's photo on the cover of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'']]

The photo "made a splash in the British art scene in 1993."&lt;ref&gt;Richard Corliss, "[http://www.time.com/time/arts/article/0,8599,2024434,00.html Nowhere Boy: Lennon and McCartney Before the Beatles]," Time/CNN, 8 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The work was exhibited as part of the exhibition [[Brilliant!]] held at the [[Walker Art Center]], Minneapolis, USA, in 1995.

In his 2001 book ''[[High Art Lite]]'', art historian [[Julian Stallabrass]] states that the Bond/Taylor-Wood version offers a "reversal of gender roles" (however, the original also has Lennon and Ono in the same position). Stallabrass also states that:&lt;blockquote&gt;
The work refers to naïve 1960s idealism, though not entirely mockingly, rather asking the viewer to contrast the situation in the 1990s with the 1960s ... for such artists, it is clear we are living in a time of the twilight of ideals.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Stallabrass ''High Art Lite'' (London: Verso, 1999), p. 140-141. Snippet view available on [https://books.google.com/books?id=OFmpiCWcglcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=high+art+lite&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=in%20which%20they%20recast%20the%20famous&amp;f=false Google books].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Commenting on the photo-work in 2010, Taylor-Wood said: &lt;blockquote&gt;The bizarre thing is that I'd completely forgotten about that piece until it was brought up in an interview ... I don't remember what drove us to make it. Must have been high concept in there somewhere, but God knows what it was. I guess there's a running interest in male vulnerability in my work, so maybe it's just that.&lt;ref&gt;Josef Braun, "[http://www.vueweekly.com/film/story/nowhere_boy/ Nowhere Boy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120406081906/http://www.vueweekly.com/film/story/nowhere_boy/ |date=6 April 2012 }}," ''Vue Weekly'', 1 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The authorship of this artwork has been contested with both artists, at different times, assuming control of the image and asserting origination/intellectual property; indeed, it has been suggested that the photographer that the pair hired to shoot the photograph also later claimed authorship of it.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Denson,''Going Back to Start, Perpetually: Playing the Nomadic Game in the Critical Reception of Art'', in: 'Parkett', no. 40/41, 1994, p. 153. See, for example, Germano Celant (ed.) ''Sam Taylor-Wood'', Milan: Fondazione Prada, 1998, p.33, where the image appears attributed to Taylor-Wood; whereas, in Joshua Decter (ed.) ''Don't Look Now'', New York: Thread Waxing, 1994, p. 15, the same photo appears attributed to Bond alone.&lt;/ref&gt;

The photograph is 23in x 19in (58.5 x 48.5&amp;nbsp;cm.); on 23 October 2001, the photograph was offered at an art auction held by [[Christie's|Christie's Auctioneers]], "work number five from an edition of five," sold for $15,059.&lt;ref&gt;Christie's Auction results online:[http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;pos=2&amp;intObjectID=3117599&amp;sid=e5ff7817-656b-4f44-8651-b517468bc20e Lot 297/Sale 9218].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Corny Concerto''''' is a 1943 [[United States|American]] [[animated cartoon|animated]] collection of [[short film|two musical segments]] produced by [[Warner Bros. Cartoons|Leon Schlesinger Productions]] and distributed by [[Warner Bros.]]  It was directed by [[Bob Clampett]], written by [[Frank Tashlin]], animated by [[Robert McKimson]] and released as part of the ''[[Merrie Melodies]]'' series on September 18, 1943. A parody of [[Walt Disney Pictures|Disney]]'s 1940 feature ''[[Fantasia (1940 film)|Fantasia]]'', the film uses two of [[Johann Strauss II|Johann Strauss]]' best known waltzes, ''[[Tales from the Vienna Woods#Waltz|Tales from the Vienna Woods]]'' and ''[[The Blue Danube]]'', adapted by the cartoon unit's music director, [[Carl Stalling]] and orchestrated by its arranger and later, Stalling's successor, [[Milt Franklyn]]. Long considered a classic for its sly humor and impeccable timing with the music, it was voted # 47 of the [[50 Greatest Cartoons]] of all time by members of the animation field in 1994. The title, in tune with the name of the unit's other cartoon series, ''[[Looney Tunes]]'', suggests another Disney titling parody, that of the pioneering series ''[[Silly Symphonies]]''.

This was the first WB cartoon ever to feature more than two of their major characters in starring roles (though not all appeared on screen at the same time). [[Elmer Fudd]] appears as the musicologist/composer (as [[Deems Taylor]] was in ''Fantasia'') introducing each segment. The first segment, ''Tales from the Vienna Woods'', stars [[Bugs Bunny]] and [[Porky Pig]], the former as the prey and the latter (in his third color cartoon) as the hunter. This is one of only two cartoons in which both Bugs and Porky appear (the other, ''[[Dumb Patrol]]'' (1964) features Porky only briefly). In addition, a number of people consider the main character in the second segment, ''The Blue Danube'', to be a "baby" version of [[Daffy Duck]]. This is also the second time the Warner Bros. studio had lampooned ''Fantasia''; ''[[Pigs in a Polka]]'' from 1942 had given a similar treatment to the works of [[Johannes Brahms]], with the [[Three Little Pigs]] as the stars.

==Plot==
===Opening scene: introduction===
The film's name is explained in the first shot as [[Carnegie Hall]], here called "Corny-gie Hall", becomes the setting for the stately appearance of a distinguished [[musicologist]], most notably exemplified by [[Deems Taylor]], who introduced ''Fantasia''. Pyotr Tchaikovsky's [[Piano Concerto No. 1 (Tchaikovsky)|Piano Concerto No. 1]] is heard over the opening credits. The "eminent personality" here, presented in the same grandiose fashion as Taylor, turns out to be none other than [[Elmer Fudd]] (voiced by [[Arthur Q. Bryan]]) who, while wearing Deems Taylor-style eyeglasses, although notably oversized, exhibits all of his own familiar mannerisms, including the nervous giggle and characteristic [[Rhotacism (speech impediment)|rhotacism]]: ''"And as we hear the whythmic stwains of the haunting wefwain, wisten to the wippwing whythm of the woodwinds, as it wolls awound and awound, and it comes out here..."''(quoting the lyrics to the popular song ''[[The Music Goes Round and Round]]''). In a staple of cartoon humor, Elmer is unable to control his starched tuxedo shirt front, which keeps rolling up in the manner of a window shade into his face while he tries to introduce the ''Vienna Woods'' segment. He finally rips it away with one last giggle before the first segment. Returning for the introduction of the slightly-longer ''Blue Danube'' segment, he holds the ripped away tuxedo shirt front in place to cover himself in front, until he waves his arms to introduce the ''Blue Danube'', causing his trousers to fall down and eliciting a final giggle of embarrassment. The two introductions contain the only spoken words in the cartoon since, apart from a few isolated non-verbal vocal sounds and sound effects, the soundtrack of the musical segments consists of the Strauss waltzes.

===Tales from the Vienna Woods===
In tune with the rhythm of Strauss' waltz, [[Porky Pig]] and his unnamed hunting dog are in the presumed woods of the title, as Porky, in the role usually reserved for Elmer Fudd's rabbit/duck hunter character, holds up the sign "I'm hunting that [[profanity|@!!*@]] rabbit!!" (which turns out to be none other than [[Bugs Bunny]]) and the dog holds a sign of his own which simply states "DITTO". Other than the 1930s incarnation of Porky hunting a [[Bugs Bunny]] prototype in [[Ben "Bugs" Hardaway]]'s and [[Cal Dalton]]'s ''[[Porky's Hare Hunt]]'' (1938), this is Porky's sole outing as a "rabbit hunter", but since both Porky and Bugs are also bereft here of their familiar voices, the primary motivator of the plot becomes the expressiveness of the characters' "balletic performance". The "@!!*@ rabbit", to the beat of the music, chomps on his carrots, lifting his foot out of the hole to press the pedal to open the lid of his "Rabbit Rubbish" receptacle, tossing carrot stubs in and closing the lid. This alerts Porky's dog, who points to Bugs' hiding hole. Bugs' hands emerge from the hole, holding a book entitled [[Emily Post]] Etiquette, then turns to a page that states "It ain't polite to point!" at which he then slams the book shut on the spherical nose at the tip of the dog's snout. Bugs then emerges from his hole, standing on a theater-style elevated platform, pirouettes out like a ballerina, dance kicks the dog in the face and ties his tail to a tree, making the dog spring back and crash into the flimsy stump, breaking it over his head which knocks him senseless and causes him to burble his lips with his finger like a baby.

Porky and the dog hide in a bush, only to find Bugs already there. Bugs confuses the duo and makes the dog jump in the bush, then runs out and pretends to be the dog, pointing to the bush. The dog pops out just before Porky pulls the trigger, followed by Bugs' grabbing the shotgun and throwing it into a tree's knothole, where a squirrel, irked by the entry of the object into his abode, fires the weapon. The impact of the gunshot causes each main character to assume his own fatal wounding. As Porky and the dog examine themselves and find no bullet mark, Bugs, appearing to be mortally hit, falls to the ground. Porky and the dog start mourning him, with the dog preparing a first aid kit while Porky tries to undo Bugs' fingers around his chest. However, once he does so, Bugs is revealed to have a baby blue bra underneath. Emitting a scream of feminine modesty, he rises as a ballerina wearing a [[ballet tutu|tutu]] and [[pointe shoes]] that matches the same color of his bra, slapping Porky's face three times, ties them to each other with the bra, flipping his tutu to revealed his pink bloomers to the audience, and gracefully dances off into the distance, falling at the end of his dance, and leaving his two antagonists with puzzled and dismayed expressions on their faces.

===The Blue Danube===
Set upon a cartoon representation of the title waterway, this parody of Disney's [[Silly Symphony]] cartoon, ''[[The Ugly Duckling (1939 film)|The Ugly Duckling]]'', is perfectly timed to the strains of the Strauss waltz. As the story opens, a mother swan is gliding with her brood, when a small black duck (which some animation historians have described as a possible representation of baby [[Daffy Duck]], pre-dating ''[[Baby Looney Tunes]]'' by nearly 60 years) tries to join them. The mother angrily makes eyes at him and swats him away, and he swims away with a big red handprint on his backside. When the lonesome little duckling tries again, using his underwater bubble tactic, the mother becomes even angrier at the little pest, now floating encased in a big bubble, and slaps him back to the water.

A large [[buzzard]] in a "[[Hipster (1940s subculture)|hep cat]]" hairdo spots the troupe using his eyes which can extend and adjust to focus like [[binoculars]]. He hangs up an "Out To Brunch" sign and swoops down for his meal. Swimming behind them to the rhythm of the music, he sprinkles salt and pepper on one of the little swans, but the pepper makes the baby swan sneeze. Then, one by one, the buzzard picks off the baby swans (the third one propelled by a tiny outboard motor). He also picks up the little black duck, but immediately puts him back, stamping the apparently unpalatable creature with, as befits a [[World War II]] cartoon, a "Rejected (unfit-for-military-service) [[4F (military conscription)|4F]]" label. The mother swan turns around and, seeing her charges gone, panics, looks all over and lifts a rock and peers underneath it only to see the little duckling, and slams it back down on him, and then falls into a faint. The duckling tries to revive her by splashing her with a bucketful of the water she's already lying in, and sees the buzzard taking the baby swans away, and becomes enraged. Suddenly turning into a super-duck-fighter-plane, briefly shown [[morphing|morphed]] into a representation of the [[P-40]] Warhawk fighter, he takes to the sky after the buzzard in hot pursuit, zooming past a clasp of trees which suddenly become alive as they react to the passing object. The buzzard sees the enraged duckling chasing him and literally turns yellow, dropping the baby swans, each of whom opens a little parachute on the way down, allowing them to drop safely. The duckling loops around and smashes head-on into the buzzard, now seemingly a symbolic representation of our wartime enemies and, as the buzzard is knocked out, hands him a drum of [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] and drops him from the sky. The impact with the ground causes the TNT drum to explode, killing the buzzard who is then seen strumming on a harp and floating towards some form of afterlife, held aloft by a balloon tied to his tail.

The final scene shows the heroic black duckling, savior of the family, as part of the mother swan's brood, quacking along to the rhythm of the waltz's finalé&amp;mdash;with only his own little reflection in the water not paying attention. While the duckling himself turned off in another direction along with mother swan and her brood, his reflection happily quacks along with the music swimming straight, banging into a tree, then frantically zig-zags to catch up to him as the cartoon fades out.

==Analysis==

''Fantasia'' was marketed to [[highbrow]] music fans; the Looney Tunes staff responded by violating the ivory tower of classical music and concert hall culture. The short parodies both ''Fantasia'''s [[Silly Symphonies]]-derived balletic approach to storytelling. Elmer Fudd stands in for [[Deems Taylor]] and in an anti-highbrow gag, his [[dickey (garment)|starched shirtfront]] keeps erupting from his shirt to hit him on the face. This sets the stage for a comedic approach to storytelling.&lt;ref name="Goldmark"&gt;Goldmark (2002), p. 107-108&lt;/ref&gt;

==Availability==
The short can be seen on disc 4 of the ''[[Looney Tunes Golden Collection: Volume 2]]'' DVD set and also appears in the documentary ''[[Bugs Bunny: Superstar]]''. It can also be found on "The Golden Age of Looney Tunes Vol. 1" laserdisc, and the "Looney Tunes Collectors Edition: Musical Masterpieces" VHS.

Since most of this cartoon has fallen into [[public domain]] (with the exception of the brief quotation of “The Music Goes Round and Round”), it has made frequent appearances on many gray-market VHS and DVD cartoon releases.

'''Alfred G. Gerteiny''' (born 1930) is an American author and scholar of [[Middle Eastern studies|Middle Eastern]] and [[African Studies]], a specialist on the [[Islamic Republic of Mauritania]], the [[Proposals for a Palestinian state|Palestinian issue]], and International Terrorism. Gerteiny posits that the "imposition" of Israel in Palestine by the International Community was an unprecedented historical blunder, and U.S. blind support of Israel, its strategy, policies and practices in the Occupied Territories as instrumental to the instability and chaos in the Middle East. Gerteiny shares with Richard Arens,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gerteiny|first1=Alfred G|title=Professor Richard Arens: In Memoriam|url=http://www.quinnipiac.edu/prebuilt/pdf/SchoolLaw/LawReviewLibrary/04_6UBridgeportLRev1(1985).pdf|website=Quinnipiac University Law School|publisher=Law School Review|accessdate=23 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chaim Shatan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arens|first1=Richard|title=Genocide in Paraguay|date=1976|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780877220886|page=116}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Richard Falk—UN Special Rapporteur on Palestine Human Rights—among other, the belief that these practices may amount to genocide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerteiny|first1=Alfred|title="Justice And The Palestinians" in JUSTICE: Interdisciplinary and Global Perspectives|date=1988|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lamham, MD|isbn=0819170933|pages=226–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the interpretive comments of the progenitor of the UN Genocide Convention, Raphael Lemkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lemkin|first1=Raphael|title=Axis Rule in Occupied Europe|date=1944|publisher=Carnegie Endowment for International Peace|location=New York, N.Y.|isbn=9781584779018|pages=79–80|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerteiny considers that the two states solution to the conflict in Palestine is fundamentally flawed, not only because of the intractable mutual claim to the whole former mandate by the warring parties, but also because of its fundamental meaning and importance to Judaism, Christianity and Islam, the 3 branches of the Abrahamic Tradition. He has suggested that a more practical and equitable solution may be one patterned after the Helvetic model—an internationally neutralized "Holy Land Confederation," with Jewish, Christian and Muslim cantons, and with Jerusalem as capital.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gerteiny|first1=Alfred|title="Justice And The Palestinians" in JUSTICE Interdisciplinary and Global Perspectives|date=1988|publisher=University Press of America|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=0819170933|pages=269–272}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''the Terrorist Conjunction,'' he further argues that "bad foreign policy choices, when coupled with grievances in the Middle East, are a fuel that triggers terrorizing violence."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Costa|first1=Christopher P.|title=A Review of "Alfred G. Gerteiny. The Terrorist Conjunction: The United States, the Israelo-Palestinian Conflict and al-Qa'ida"|journal=Terrorism and Political Violence|volume=21|issue=4|pages=642–4|doi=10.1080/09546550903256663}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before devoting his academic focus on the Middle East, Gerteiny was best known for his field work in, and expertise on the Islamic Republic of Mauritania hitherto unknown African territory, which mysteries he reported in books and journal articles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bruchhaus|first1=Eva-Marie|title=Mauritania by Alfred G. Gerteiny|journal=Journal of Modern African Studies|date=1968|volume=6|issue=2|pages=276–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an academic, Gerteiny emphasized the fundamental importance of Tenure, Academic Freedom and Collegiality in the pursuit of truth, particularly at institutions of higher learning, and as president of the University of Bridgeport's Chapter of the American Association of University Professors, he led the longest higher education faculty strike in U.S. history&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Magner|first1=Denise K|title=3 Months Into a Bitter Faculty Strike at U. of Bridgeport, Unionists and Administrators Ask: What Price Victory|journal=The Chronicle of Higher Education|date=November 28, 1990|volume=XXXVII|issue= 13|pages=A18, A20}}&lt;/ref&gt; in defense of these values, ultimately losing  tenure and position,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins|first1=Denis|title=The Longest Faculty Strike in U.S. Higher Education: Perspectives from Key Participants|journal=Journal of Academic Ethics|date=2003|volume=1|issue=3|pages=1:233–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with the striking faculty.

==Early life and education==
Gerteiny was born in [[Heliopolis (Cairo suburb)|Heliopolis]], Egypt, where he was reared in the family’s French cultural tradition. He is the son of Officier d'Académie Georges J. Gerteiny, Secrétaire de l’Institut Français d’Archaéologie Orientale du Caire, and of Nabiha Sophie.

After completing the primary education cycle at the Heliopolis Jesuit school, Gerteiny graduated from the [[Lycée Français du Caire]], and in Europe, from Institut d'Etude et de Recherches Diplomatique de Paris (ILERI)http://www.ileri.fr/. He also took specialized courses at the [[Hague Academy of International Law]]. In New York, he attended [[Columbia University]]'s Middle East Institute, and in 1963 was awarded a Ph.D. in Contemporary History from [[St. John's University (New York City)|St. John's University]]. Gerteiny lectured and conducted graduate seminars at St. John's University's African Studies Center,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Forty-nine New Scholars to Teach at U.B.|publisher=The Bridgeport Post|date=11 May 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as at the University of Bridgeport where he served as chairman of History; he also lectured worldwide.

'''Amarna letter EA 288''', titled: ''"Benign Neglect,"''&lt;ref&gt;[[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] 1987, 1992. ''The Amarna Letters.'' EA 289, ''"Benign Neglect"'', pp. 330-332.&lt;/ref&gt; is a tall, finely-inscribed [[clay tablet]] letter, approximately 7.5 in tall x 4.5 in wide, broken into two pieces, from [[Abdi-Heba]] the mayor/ruler of [[Jerusalem]], of the mid 14th century BC [[Amarna letters]]. The scribe of his six letters to Egypt were penned by the "[[Jerusalem scribe]]"; EA 288 is a moderately long, and involved letter.

The [[Amarna letters]], about 300, numbered up to EA 382, are a mid 14th century BC, about [[1350 BC]] and 20–25 years later, [[Text corpus|correspondence]]. The initial corpus of letters were found at [[Akhenaten]]'s city [[Akhetaten]], in the floor of the [[Bureau of Correspondence of Pharaoh]]; others were later found, adding to the [[text corpus|body]] of letters.

Letter EA 288 (also see here-(Obverse): [https://cdli.ucla.edu/search/search_results.php?SearchMode=Text&amp;ObjectID=P271089]), is numbered VAT 1643, from the [[Vorderasiatisches Museum Berlin]].

''A summary of letter structure:'' EA 288 begins with a short address to the Pharaoh. Immediately, 3 [[segue]] paragraphs begin the letter, as "dramatic statements" by the [[Jerusalem scribe]] (and [[Abdi-Heba]]); a fourth [[segue]]d statement follows. Then the purpose of the letter begins, covering the second half of the letter's ''obverse'' and the ''reverse''.

Paragraphs I-VIII (IX), complete the letter's obverse (as seen in photo).

'''''An Outline Dictionary of Maya Glyphs: With a Concordance and Analysis of Their Relationships''''' is a [[monograph]] study of the [[Maya script]] by [[William E. Gates]], first published in 1931. The inventory of glyphs used in Gates' analysis was compiled and drawn from the [[Madrid Codex (Maya)|Madrid]], [[Dresden Codex|Dresden]] and [[Paris Codex|Paris codices]], rather than from monumental inscriptions and [[stela]]e. It was published at a time when the Maya script remained wholly undeciphered and the type of [[writing system]] the script represented was unknown and much debated among Mayanists. Gates' work represented one of the major attempts in this pre-decipherment era of Mayanist scholarship to catalogue and analyse Maya glyphs as a prelude to uncovering their meaning. In comprehensiveness it was later superseded by [[Günther Zimmermann]]'s ''[[Die Hieroglyphen der Maya-Handschriften]]'' (1956), and then in particular by [[J. Eric S. Thompson]]'s ''[[A Catalogue of Maya Hieroglyphs]]'' (1962), which became established as the ''de facto'' standard catalogue and analysis of its day.

Once it was realised in the latter half of the 20th century that the Maya script was largely [[logosyllabic]] in nature, Mayanist epigraphers beginning with [[Yuri Knorozov]] began a process of breakthroughs in the script's decipherment. Other key contributions and realisations&amp;mdash;such as establishing that the stelae texts recorded actual history and real personages and events&amp;mdash;led to the decipherment of a significant number of glyphs and texts, particularly from the 1970s onwards. While many of the interpretations put forward in the early catalogues by Gates ''et al.'' have been made redundant by the modern knowledge of the script, catalogues such as Gates' have retained their significance and utility as references and records&amp;mdash;particularly for [[Maya calendar|calendrical]] and astronomical data and interpretation.

The original edition was limited to 207 copies. The book was subsequently reprinted by [[Dover Publications|Dover]] in 1978, and by [[Kessinger Publishing|Kessinger]] in 2003.

The '''Anti-Rent War''' (also known as the '''Helderberg War''') was a tenants' revolt in [[upstate New York]] in the period 1839–1845. The Anti-Renters declared their independence from the [[Manorialism|manor]] system run by [[patroon]]s, resisting tax collectors and successfully demanding land reform.

==Events==
The incident began with the death of [[Stephen Van Rensselaer III]] in 1839. Van Rensselaer, who was described as having "...proved a lenient and benevolent landowner" was the [[patroon]] of the region at the time, and was a descendant of Kiliaen Van Rensselaer, the first patroon of the [[Manor of Rensselaerswyck]]. During his life, he preferred to allow rents to accumulate or to accept partial payment when tenants were in financial constraints.  However, his leases also included a "quarter-sale" provision, which required tenants who sold their leases to pay Van Rensselaer one fourth of the sale price or one additional year's rent. The patroons owned all the land on which the tenants in the [[Hudson Valley]] lived, and used this [[Feudalism|feudal]] lease system to maintain control of the region. When he died, Van Rensselaer's will directed his heirs to collect outstanding rents and "quarter sale" payments to apply to the estate debts. When the heirs attempted to collect, tenants could not pay the amounts demanded, could not secure a favorable payment schedule from the heirs, and could not obtain relief in the courts, so they revolted. 

The first mass meeting of tenant farmers leading to the Anti-Rent War was held at the top of the [[Helderberg Escarpment|Helderberg]] mountains in [[Berne, New York]] on July 4, 1839. They issued a declaration of independence, promising: "We will take up the ball of the Revolution where our fathers stopped it and roll it to the final consummation of freedom and independence of the masses."&lt;ref name=Miller1967&gt;Miller (1967), pp. 66–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1839 the Anti-Renters repulsed a 500-man posse led by Albany County sheriff Michael Artcher and including [[William Marcy]] and [[John Van Buren]]. Governor [[William Seward]] threatened the rebels with 700 militiamen and obtained their surrender. However, an insurrection continued to smolder. Disguised "Calico Indians" resisted tax collection and law enforcement, sometimes tarring and feathering their enemies.&lt;ref name=Miller1967 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Summerhill2007&gt;Thomas Summerhill, "Anti-Rent Wars (New York)", in ''Encyclopedia of U.S. Labor and Working-class History'' Vol. 1, ed.

In January 1845, one hundred and fifty delegates from eleven counties assembled at St. Paul's Lutheran Church&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.bernehistory.org/churchDetails.asp?ID=4 |title=Berne, NY: history |accessdate=April 15, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105084345/http://www.bernehistory.org/churchDetails.asp?ID=4 |archivedate=November 5, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Berne to call for political action to redress their grievances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Christman|first=Henry|title=Tin Horns and Calico, a Decisive Episode in the Emergence of Democracy|isbn=0-685-61130-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Results==
The Anti-Rent War led to the creation of the Antirenter Party, which had a strong influence on [[New York State]] politics from 1846–51.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Holt, The Rise and Fall of the American Whig Party: Jacksonian Politics and the Onset of the Civil War, NY: Oxford U Press, 1999, 240-42, 299,591-91,647,655-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Newly elected governor [[Silas Wright]] moved in 1845 to stamp out the Calico Indians, and pushed for a law which outlawed disguises.&lt;ref name=Summerhill2007 /&gt; 

Trials of leaders of the revolt, charged with riot, conspiracy and robbery, were held in 1845. Participants as counsel in the trials included [[Ambrose L. Jordan]], as leading counsel for the defense, and [[John Van Buren]], the state attorney general, who personally conducted the prosecution. At the first trial, the jury came to no conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bradbury |first=Anna Rossman |date=1908 |title=History of the City of Hudson, New York |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNcwAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA147 |location=Hudson, NY |publisher=Record Printing and Publishing |page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a re-trial in September 1845, the two leading counsels started a fist-fight in open court. Both were sentenced by the presiding judge, Justice John W. Edmonds, to "solitary confinement in the county jail for 24 hours." At the conclusion of the trial, one defendant, Smith A. Boughton, was sentenced to life imprisonment. After the election of [[John Young (governor)|John Young]] as governor, who had the support of the Anti-Renters, he pardoned Boughton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Adams |first=Arthur G. |date=2003 |title=The Hudson Through the Years |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=As5tyLSVC5wC&amp;pg=PA243 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Fordham University Press |page=243 |isbn=978-0-8232-1676-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[New York Constitution#Constitutional Convention of 1846|New York Constitution of 1846]] added provisions for tenants' rights, abolishing feudal tenures and outlawing leases lasting longer than twelve years.&lt;ref name=Miller1967 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Summerhill2007 /&gt; The remaining manors dissolved quickly as the patroons sold off the lands.&lt;ref name=Miller1967 /&gt;

Browman |publisher=Haskins Laboratories |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Haskins Laboratories]] and [[Louis M. Goldstein]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yale.edu/linguist/faculty/louis.html |title=Linguistics |publisher=Yale University |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Yale University]] and Haskins. The theory identifies theoretical discrepancies between [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] and aims to unify the two by treating them as low- and high-dimensional descriptions of a single system.

Unification can be achieved by incorporating into a single model the idea that the physical system (identified with phonetics) constrains the underlying abstract system (identified with phonology), making the units of control at the abstract planning level the same as those at the physical level.

The plan of an utterance is formatted as a gestural score, which provides the input to a physically based model of speech production - the task dynamic model of [[Elliot Saltzman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bu.edu/sargent/about/faculty/physical-therapy/saltzman/ |accessdate=December 7, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220181630/http://www.bu.edu/sargent/about/faculty/physical-therapy/saltzman/ |archivedate=December 20, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haskins.yale.edu/staff/saltzman.html |title=Elliot Saltzman |publisher=Haskins Laboratories |accessdate=2013-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gestural score graphs locations within the [[vocal tract]] where constriction can occur, indicating the planned or target degree of constriction. A computational model of speech production developed at [[Haskins Laboratories]] combines articulatory phonology, task dynamics, and the Haskins [[articulatory synthesis]] system developed by [[Philip Rubin]] and colleagues.

An '''artist's impression''' or '''artist's interpretation''' is the representation of an object or a scene created by an artist, when no other accurate representation is available. It could be an image, a sound, a video or a model. Artist's impressions are often created to represent concepts and objects that cannot be seen by the naked eye; that are very big, very small, in the past, in the future, fictional, or otherwise abstract in other ways. For example, in architecture, artists' impressions are used to showcase the design of planned buildings and associated landscape.&lt;ref name="BobMargaret2004"&gt;{{cite book | author1=Bob Giddings | author2=Margaret Horne | title=Artists' Impressions in Architectural Design | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ekhXDjNF2bkC&amp;pg=PA1 | accessdate=24 May 2013 | date=9 March 2004 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | isbn=978-0-203-36246-4 | pages=1–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artists' impressions are particularly prominent in [[space art]].&lt;ref name="NASA's Space Art Program"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://newatlas.com/how-are-planets-painted/42763/ |title=Artist's Impression: How to Paint a Planet |last=Powell |first=Dominic |date=2016-04-16 |website=New Atlas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Battle of the Grapevine Creek''' was a short battle between two large armed groups of the Hatfield family and the McCoy family which was the last offensive event during the [[Hatfield–McCoy feud]] and marked the beginning of the Hatfields' defeat in the feud between the two families.

==Battle==
Shortly after the capture and murder of Jim Vance in January 1888, the Hatfield family, led by [[Devil Anse Hatfield]], prepared for one last major offensive against the McCoy family in order to gain revenge for the killing of Jim Vance and to achieve victory over the McCoy family to end the feud. When news of the Hatfields' preparations for war reached the McCoy side, the Hatfields were already en route to invade the McCoy territory, so Frank Phillips, the leader of the McCoy posse, rounded up every able man he could and led his posse to intercept the invading Hatfields. Both sides eventually met around the area of the Grapevine Creek on the West Virginia side of the [[Tug Fork River]] and began exchanging shots at each other. One group of the McCoy side managed to lure the Hatfields into one area of the battlefield while another group of McCoys moved to outflank them, which caused the Hatfields to suffer multiple casualties and made them retreat. A number of Hatfields did not manage to escape and were taken prisoner by the McCoys.

==Aftermath==
As a result of the McCoys scoring victory over the Hatfields and taking multiple prisoners both from the battle and prior to the battle, they put all of the Hatfield prisoners on trial with the permission of the Kentucky government for the various crimes they had committed during the feud, mainly the murder of the [[Randall McCoy]]'s sons for killing Ellison Hatfield and the killing of one of his daughters during the New Year's Eve massacre. All the Hatfields were found guilty and sent to prison except for Cottontop Ellison Mounts, the illegitimate son of Ellison Hatfield, who was [[Capital punishment|sentenced to death]] as it was he who was proved to have killed Randall McCoy's daughter.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7973">The '''Bridgewater Triangle''' refers to an area of about {{convert|200|mi2|km2}} within southeastern [[Massachusetts]] in the [[United States]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bridgewaterpubliclibrary.org/historical_tidbits.htm Bridgewater Historical tidbits&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070606043216/http://www.bridgewaterpubliclibrary.org/historical_tidbits.htm |date=2007-06-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; claimed to be a site of alleged [[paranormal phenomena]], ranging from [[UFO]]s to [[poltergeists]], orbs, balls of fire and other spectral phenomena, various [[bigfoot]]-like sightings, giant snakes and "[[Thunderbird (cryptozoology)|thunderbirds]]."

== Location  ==
Specific boundaries of the Bridgewater Triangle were first defined by cryptozoologist [[Loren Coleman]] (who coined the term) in the 1970s, and then in his book ''Mysterious America.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.simonandschuster.com/Mysterious-America/Loren-Coleman/9781416527367]&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote that the Bridgewater Triangle encompasses the towns of [[Abington, Massachusetts|Abington]], [[Rehoboth, Massachusetts|Rehoboth]] and [[Freetown, Massachusetts|Freetown]] at the points of the triangle, and [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], [[Whitman, Massachusetts|Whitman]], [[West Bridgewater, Massachusetts|West Bridgewater]], [[East Bridgewater, Massachusetts|East Bridgewater]], [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]], [[Middleboro, Massachusetts|Middleboro]], [[Dighton, Massachusetts|Dighton]], [[Berkley, Massachusetts|Berkley]], [[Raynham, Massachusetts|Raynham]], [[Norton, Massachusetts|Norton]], [[Easton, Massachusetts|Easton]], [[Lakeville, Massachusetts|Lakeville]], [[Seekonk, Massachusetts|Seekonk]], and [[Taunton, Massachusetts|Taunton]] inside the triangle. Similar claims have been made about an area in neighboring Vermont called the [[Bennington Triangle]].

== Historic places and landmarks ==

*'''Hockomock Swamp''' - Central to the area is [[Hockomock Swamp]], which means "the place where spirits dwell."&lt;ref name="boston2005"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/articles/2005/10/30/tales_from_the_swamp/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Ross A. | last=Muscato | title=Tales from the swamp | date=October 30, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Paranormal claims==
Common to most of these areas is a mix of reported phenomena that includes reports of UFOs, mysterious animals and hominids,{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="enterprise.southofboston.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://enterprise.southofboston.com/articles/2006/10/25/news/news/news06.txt |df= }}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; ghosts and poltergeists, and animal mutilations.
*'''Bigfoot sightings''': There have been several reported sightings of a bigfoot-like creature in the triangle, usually near the Hockomock swamp.
*'''Thunderbird sightings:''' Giant birds or [[pterodactyl]]-like flying creature with wingspans 8–12 feet are claimed to have been seen in Hockomock Swamp and neighboring Taunton, including a report by Norton Police Sergeant Thomas Downy.{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="enterprise.southofboston.com"/&gt;
*'''Animal mutilations''': Various incidents of animal mutilation have been reported, particularly in Freetown and Fall River, where local police were called to investigate mutilated animals believed to be the work of a cult. Two specific incidents in 1998 were reported: one in which a single adult cow was found butchered in the woods; the other in which a group of calves were discovered in a clearing, grotesquely mutilated as if part of a ritual sacrifice.{{Dead link|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="NewStandard: 11/1/98"/&gt;
*'''Native American curses:''' According to one tale, the Native Americans had cursed the swamp centuries ago because of the poor treatment they received from the Colonial settlers.{{Dead link|date=August 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyplace.com/specials/kingphilip.htm |title=Archived Document |accessdate=2010-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071026061648/http://www.historyplace.com/specials/kingphilip.htm |archivedate=2007-10-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A revered object of the [[Wampanoag people]], a belt known as the wampum belt was lost during [[King Philip's War]]. Legend says that the area owes its paranormal unrest to the fact that this belt was lost from the Native people.&lt;ref name="Haunted Objects" /&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=September 2014}}

'''Centralisation''' (British) or '''centralization''' (both British and American) is the process by which the activities of an organization, particularly those regarding planning and decision-making, become concentrated within a particular geographical location  group. This moves the important decision-making and planning powers within the center of the organisation.

The term has a variety of meanings in several fields. In [[political science]], centralisation refers to the concentration of a government's power—both geographically and politically—into a [[centralized government]].

==Centralisation in politics==

===History of the centralisation of authority===
''Centralisation of authority'' is defined as the systematic and consistent concentration of authority at a central point or in a person within the organization.&lt;ref&gt;Acharya, A. (2012). ''What are the advantages and disadvantages of centralization of authority ?.'' [online] Preservearticles.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.preservearticles.com/201101143291/advantages-and-disadvantages-of-centralisation-of-authority.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; This idea was first introduced in the [[Qin Dynasty]] of China. The Qin government was highly bureaucratic and was administered by a hierarchy of officials, all serving the First Emperor, [[Qin Shi Huang]].&lt;ref&gt;Ancientmilitary.com, (2012). ''Ancient China Government.'' [online] Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.ancientmilitary.com/ancient-china-government.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt; The Qin Dynasty practised all the things that [[Han Fei]]zi taught, allowing Qin Shi Huang to own and control all his territories, including those conquered from other countries. Zheng and his advisers ended feudalism in China by setting up new laws and regulations under a centralized and bureaucratic government with a rigid centralization of authority. Under this system, both the military and government thrived. This was because talented individuals were more easily identified and picked out to be trained for specialized functions.&lt;ref&gt;Bachman, D., Bickers, R., Carter, J., de Weert, H., Elders, C., Entenmann, R. and Felton, M. (2007). ''World and Its Peoples: Eastern and Southern Asia. New York: Marshall Cavendish'', p.36.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation of authority in ancient Chinese government===
* The monarchical power is the supreme power in the empire. The emperor monopolizes all the resources in the country; his personality and abilities decide the prosperity of the country. This autocratic system allows for faster decision-making and avoids complex solutions to problems that arise. One disadvantage is that courtiers, who compete for the emperor's favor, are able to amass power for themselves, leading to internal strife.(Jin and Liu, 1992)&lt;ref&gt;Jin, G. and Liu, Q. (1992). ''The Cycle of Growth and Decline - On the Ultrastable Structure of Chinese Society: Chapter 7''. 2nd ed. Hong Kong: The Chinese University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The administrative department has highly centralized power. The duties of each bureaucratic occupation are not clearly defined, leading to inefficiencies as functionaries manage the government and effectively rule the country.

===Idea of centralisation of authority===
The acts for the implementation are needed after delegation. Therefore, the authority for taking the decisions can be spread with the help of the delegation of the authority.

The centralisation of authority can be done immediately, if complete concentration is given at the decision-making stage for any position. The centralisation can be done with a position or at a level in an organisation. Ideally, the decision-making power is held by a few individuals.

===Advantages and disadvantages of the centralisation of authority===
Centralisation of authority has several advantages and disadvantages. The benefits include:

# Responsibilities and duties are well defined within the central governing body.
# Decision-making is very direct and clear.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Singh, K. (2015). ''What is Centralization and De-Centralization of the Authority? | Total MBA Guide.'' [online] Mbaofficial.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.mbaofficial.com/mba-courses/principles-of-management/what-is-centralization-and-de-centralization-of-the-authority/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The central power maintains a large "encompassing interest" in the welfare of the state it rules since it stands to benefit from any increase in the state's wealth and/or power.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Olson|first=Mancur|date=1993-01-01|title=Dictatorship, Democracy, and Development|jstor=2938736|journal=The American Political Science Review|volume=87|issue=3|pages=567–576|doi=10.2307/2938736}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, the incentives of state and ruler are aligned.

Disadvantages, on the other hand are as follows:

# Decisions may be misunderstood while being passed on and lower position departments do not have the decision-making power, therefore it requires an efficient and well-organized top department.
# Attention and support for each department or city may not be balanced.
# Delay of work information may result in inefficiency of the government.
# Discrepancies in the economy and information resources between the centre and other places are significant.&lt;ref&gt;Fujii, G. (2010). ''藤井厳喜WEBサイト | Fujii's Focus For Future 公式ブログ.'' [online] Gemki-fujii.com. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.gemki-fujii.com/blog/2010/000641.html&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 4 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;
# Excludes actors at the local and provincial levels from the prevailing system of governance, reducing the capacity of the central government to resolve disputes or design effective policies requiring local knowledge and expertise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sawyer|first=Amos|date=2004-09-01|title=Violent conflicts and governance challenges in West Africa: the case of the Mano River basin area|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-modern-african-studies/article/violent-conflicts-and-governance-challenges-in-west-africa-the-case-of-the-mano-river-basin-area/05EB21C20F63C87E8E9319952E5A6455|journal=The Journal of Modern African Studies|volume=42|issue=3|pages=437–463|doi=10.1017/S0022278X04000266|issn=1469-7777}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in economy==
===Relationship between centralisation (i.e. concentration of production) and capitalism===
{{Main|Capitalism#Concentration and centralisation|Capital accumulation#Concentration and centralization}}
As written in V.I. Lenin’s book, ''Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism'', "The remarkably rapid concentration of production in ever-larger enterprises are one of the most characteristic features of capitalism."&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Lenin, V. (1939). ''Imperialism, the highest stage of capitalism.'' New York: International Publishers,  pp.12-54.&lt;/ref&gt; He researched the development of production and decided to develop the concept of production as a centralised framework, from individual and scattered small workshops into large factories, leading the capitalism to the world. This is guided by the idea that once concentration of production develops into a particular level, it will become a monopoly, like party organisations of Cartel, Syndicate, and Trust.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* Cartel - In economics, a cartel is an agreement between competing firms to control prices or exclude entry of a new competitor in a market. It is a formal organisation of sellers or buyers that agree to fix selling prices, purchase prices, or reduce production using a variety of tactics.&lt;ref&gt;O’Sullivan, A. and Sheffrin, S. (2003). ''Economics.'' Needham, Mass.: Prentice Hall, p.171.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Syndicate - A syndicate is a self-organising group made up of individuals, companies, corporations or entities formed to transact some specific business, to pursue or promote a shared interest.
*Trust - "A trust is . . . simply the case of one person holding the title of property, whether land or chattels, for the benefit of another, termed a beneficiary. Nothing can be more common or more useful. But the word is now loosely applied to a certain class, of commercial agreements and, by reason of a popular and unreasoning dread of their effect, the term itself has become contaminated."&lt;ref&gt;Theodore, D. (1888). "The Legality of "Trusts". ''Political Science Quarterly'', 3(592).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centralisation in business studies==
Most businesses deal with issues relating to the specifics of centralization or decentralization of decision-making. The key question is either whether the authority should manage all the things at the centre of a business (centralised), or whether it should be delegated far away from the centre (decentralised).

The choice between centralised or decentralised varies. Many large businesses necessarily involve some extent of decentralisation and some extent of centralisation when it begins to operate from several places or any new units and markets added.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, J. (2014). ''Centralised versus decentralised structures | Business | tutor2u.'' [online] Beta.tutor2u.net. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://beta.tutor2u.net/business/reference/centralised-versus-decentralised-structures&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Features of centralisation in management===
# Top level managers concentrate and reserve the decision-making power.
# Execution decided by the top level management with the help from the other levels of management.
# Lower levels management do the jobs which directed and controlled by the top managers.'''(BMS Team, 2013)'''&lt;ref&gt;BMS Team, (2013). ''Important Features of centralization | BMS.co.in.'' [online] BMS.co.in : Bachelor of Management Studies. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.bms.co.in/important-features-of-centralization/&lt;/nowiki&gt; [Accessed 5 Nov. 2015].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Chimariko''' is an [[extinct language|extinct]] [[language isolate]] formerly spoken in northern [[Trinity County, California|Trinity County]], California, by the inhabitants of several independent communities. While the total area claimed by these communities was remarkably small, Golla (2011:87–89) believes there is evidence that three local dialects were recognized: ''Trinity River Chimariko,'' spoken along the [[Trinity River (California)|Trinity River]] from the mouth of South Fork at Salyer as far upstream as Big Bar, with a principal village at [[Burnt Ranch, California|Burnt Ranch]]; ''South Fork Chimariko,'' spoken around the junction of South Fork and Hayfork Creek, with a principal village at [[Hyampom, California|Hyampom]]; and ''New River Chimariko,'' spoken along New River on the southern slopes of the [[Trinity Alps]], with a principal village at [[Denny, California|Denny]].

== Genetic relations ==

Proposals linking Chimariko to other languages in various versions of the hypothetical Hokan family have been advanced. [[Roland Dixon]] suggested a relationship between Chimariko and the [[Shastan languages|Shastan]] and [[Palaihnihan]] families. [[Edward Sapir]]'s famous [[Classification schemes for indigenous languages of the Americas#Sapir (1929): Encyclopædia Britannica|1929 classification]] grouped Chimariko with Shastan, [[Palaihnihan languages|Palaihnihan]], [[Pomoan]], and the [[Karuk]] and [[Yana language|Yana]] languages in a Hokan sub-grouping known as ''Northern Hokan''. A ''Kahi'' family consisting of Chimariko, [[Shasta language|Shastan]], Palaihnihan, and [[Karuk language|Karuk]] has been suggested (appearing also within Sapir's 1929 ''Northern Hokan''). Most specialists currently find these relationships to be undemonstrated, and consider Chimariko to remain best considered an isolate.&lt;ref&gt;Jany (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documentary History==

Stephen Powers collected the first word list from Chimariko speakers in 1875 (Golla, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;89). Soon after, Jeremiah Curtin documented a substantial amount of information (p.&amp;nbsp;89). Roland Dixon began work on the Chimariko language in the early 1900s, when there were few remaining speakers. Dixon worked with two: Mrs. Dyer and a man who was named Friday.&lt;ref name="reviewDixon"&gt;{{cite news | last = Sapir |first = Edward |year = 1911 |origyear=1990 | title = Review of Roland B.

Later, extensive documentation on the language was carried out by [[J.P. Harrington]], who worked with [[Sally Noble]], the last speaker of the language.&lt;ref name="surviving2002"&gt;{{cite book | last = Luthin | first = Herbert | title = Surviving through the Days | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2002 | isbn = 978-0-520-22270-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; None of this work has been published, but slides of all of Harrington's work can be viewed on the [[Smithsonian Institution]]'s website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John P.

The last Chimariko speaker was Martha Ziegler who died in the 1950s (Golla, 2011, p.&amp;nbsp;89). According to Golla, "[m]odern Chimariko descendants, organized as the Tsnungwe Tribe (from Hupa ''cʰe:niŋxʷe:'' 'Ironside Mountain people') and seeking federal acknowledgement, consider both Hupa and Chimariko to be their heritage languages, but emphasize Hupa for purposes of cultural revitalization" (p.&amp;nbsp;89). There are no programs available to either teach or revitalize Chimariko from its current status of extinct (p.&amp;nbsp;89).

=== Syllables ===

Chimariko shares syllabic similarities with other languages in Northern California. The most common syllable structures for Chimariko are CV and CVC, with the largest possible structures being CCVC or CVCC.&lt;ref&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morphology==
Noun incorporation is present in Chimariko.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun 44&lt;/ref&gt; The verbs have prefixes, suffixes and a circumfix.&lt;ref&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."p.185&lt;/ref&gt;

==Grammatical characteristics==
Because the documentary corpus of Chimariko was limited, the description of the grammar of the language was not complete.&lt;ref name="reviewDixon"/&gt; However, general observations were made.

Among the recorded grammatical characteristics are the following: Chimariko had [[reduplication]] in many nominal forms, particularly in the names of [[fauna]] (e.g., ''tsokoko-tci'' "bluejay", ''himimitcei'' "grouse"). Like many American languages (such as [[Shasta language|Shasta]], [[Maidu language|Maidu]], [[Wintu language|Wintun]], as well as [[Shoshoni language|Shoshoni]], [[Siouan]], and [[Pomo languages|Pomo]]), Chimariko verbs had a series of [[instrumental]] and body-part [[prefix]]es, indicating the particular body part or object with which an action was carried out.&lt;ref name="reviewDixon"/&gt; Instrumentals are attached at the beginning of the verb root and often occur with a suffix which indicates the motion in the verb, such as ''-ha'' "up", ''-hot'' "down", and ''-usam'' "through".&lt;ref name="Dixon"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dixon|first=Roland Burrage|date=1910|title=The Chimariko Indians and Language|journal=University of California publications in American archaeology and ethnology|volume=5|issue=5|pages=293–380}}&lt;/ref&gt;

List of instrumentals from Dixon:&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;

| me- || with the head
|-
| mitci- || with the foot
|-
| tcu- || with a round object
|-
| tu- || with the hand
|-

Chimariko does not use numeral classifiers.&lt;ref&gt;Conathan p.11&lt;/ref&gt; Also lacking is a clear pattern to indicate control.&lt;ref&gt;Jany(2007)"Chimariko..."&lt;/ref&gt;

|}&lt;ref&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."p.69&lt;/ref&gt;

===Numerals===
According to Carmen Jany, "no other language has the exact same system as Chimariko".&lt;ref&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."p.114&lt;/ref&gt; Chimariko uses both a [[decimal]] and [[quinary]] numeral systems.&lt;ref&gt;p114&lt;/ref&gt; Numerals appear in noun phrases, do not take affixes (except for the determinative suffix ''-lle''), can either follow or precede the noun, and can appear without a noun.&lt;ref&gt;p.112-113&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space, Time, Modality===
There are two demonstrative pronouns in Chimariko indicating "here" and "there". ''Qè-'' indicates here, or near the speaker, and ''pa-'' indicates there, or a distance from the speaker.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; To indicate "this" and "that", the intensive suffix ''-ut'' is added: 
: This:  ''qèwot'', ''qât''
: That:  ''pamut'', ''paut'', ''pât''&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt;

There are many directional suffixes:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| ''-ktam/-tam'' || 'down'
|-
| ''-ema/-enak'' || 'into'
|-
| ''-ha'' || 'up'
|-
| ''-hot'' || 'down'
|-
| ''-lo'' || 'apart'
|-
| ''-ro'' || 'up'
|-
| ''-sku'' || 'towards'
|-
| ''-smu'' || 'across'
|-
| ''-tap'' || 'out'
|-
| ''-tku/-ku'' || Cislocative ('towards here')
|-
| ''-tmu/-mu'' || Transmotional ('towards there')
|-
| ''-kh'' || 'motion towards here'
|-
| ''-m'' || 'motion towards there'
|-
| ''-tpi'' || 'out of'
|-
| ''-xun/-xunok'' || 'in, into'
|-
| ''-qʰa'' || 'along'
|-
| ''-pa'' || 'off, away'
|-
| ''-qʰutu'' || 'into water'
|-
| ''-čʼana'' || 'to, toward'
|-
| ''-čama'' ||'in, into'
|}&lt;ref&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."pp.247-248&lt;/ref&gt;

The modal system in Chimariko is abundant.&lt;ref name="Jany,2007Chimariko...p.206"&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."p.206&lt;/ref&gt; Modal suffixes attach at the very end of a verb after all other suffixes are applied and generally don't occur with aspectual suffixes.&lt;ref name="Jany,2007Chimariko...p.206"/&gt; The modal suffixes function as interrogatives, negatives, dubitatives, speculatives, conditionals, emphatics, potentials, potential futures, purposive futures, optatives, desideratives, imperatives, admonitives, intensives, inferentials, resultatives, and evidentials.&lt;ref&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."pp.206-209&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sentence Structure===
The research available indicates a variation in opinion about Chimariko's word order. Dixon claimed that usual word order is SVO or SOV, but in some cases the object precedes the subject, especially when the subject is pronominal.&lt;ref name=Dixon /&gt; Jany claims that word order is not rigid but is mainly verb-final.&lt;ref&gt;Jany,(2007)"Chimariko..."pp.258-263&lt;/ref&gt; The clauses are separated by brackets and the verbs are bolded in the following example:
     ''ʔawaidače xowonat, šičel hiwontat''
     ''[ʔawa-ida-če   '''x-owo-na-t''']        [šičel '''h-iwonta-t''']''
     home-POSS-LOC  NEG-stay-NEG-ASP    horse 3-ride-ASP
     'She does not stay at home, she goes around on horseback.'&lt;ref&gt;p258&lt;/ref&gt;
Inside noun phrases, there is variation in order of modifiers and the noun; sometimes the noun comes before other elements of the phrase, sometimes after.&lt;ref&gt;p264&lt;/ref&gt; When dealing with possession, the subject always precedes the object.&lt;ref&gt;p265&lt;/ref&gt;

===Case===
Chimariko has an agent/patient case system.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun p.213&lt;/ref&gt; For first persons, agent and patient are differentiated in both transitive and intransitive clauses, and third persons are not.&lt;ref&gt;Jany (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;  Person hierarchy in the argument structure is present as well where speech act participants are favored over third persons.&lt;ref&gt;Jany (2007)p.266&lt;/ref&gt;
     ''mokoxanaˀ''
     '''''m'''-oko-xana-ˀ''
     2SG-tattoo-FUT-Q
     'Are you going to tattoo her?'&lt;ref&gt;Jany (2007)p.270&lt;/ref&gt;
      2&gt;3 =&gt; 2

===Possession===
Chimariko differentiates alienable and inalienable possession.&lt;ref name="Jany 2007"&gt;Jany 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Alienable possessions such as objects and kinship are marked by suffix, while inalienable possessions such as body parts are marked by prefix, on the possessed.
{| class="wikitable"
|-
!  !! Prefixed/Inalienable !! Suffixed/Alienable
|-
| 1SG 'my' || ''čʰ-'' || ''-ˀe/-ˀi''
|-
| 2SG 'your' || ''m-'' || ''-mi''
|-
| 3SG 'his/her' || ''h-'' || ''-ita/-ye''
|-
| 1PL 'our' || ''čʰa-'' || ''-čʰe''
|-
| 2PL 'your' || ''qʰ-'' || ''-qʰ''
|-
| 3PL 'their' || ''h-'' || ''-ita''
|} &lt;ref name="Jany 2007"/&gt;

Examples from JP Harrington field notes (Jany 2007) contrasting alienable and inalienable possession:
     ''čʰ-uweš''         'my horn'(deer says)
     ''noˀot huweš-ˀi''  'my horn' (Frank says)

===Complementation===
In Chimariko, there is no grammatical complementation, however there are a few strategies to convey semantic complementation including separate clauses, verbal affixes, the use of attitude words, and using the desiderative ''imiˀna'' 'to want'.&lt;ref name="Jany, 2007"&gt;Jany, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples from Jany (2007):
     '''Complements with utterance predicates (separate clauses)''':
     ''himisamdudaˀn sideˀw''
     [''himisamdu-daˀn''] ['''''si-deˀw''''']
     devil-INF         say-DER
     'It must have been the devil, they said.' (complement is bolded; clauses are in brackets)

     '''Desiderative imiˀna ‘to want’ with clausal arguments'''
     ''yuwom imiˀnan''
     ''y-uwo-m     imiˀna-n''
     1SG.A-go-DIR  want-ASP
     ‘I want to go home’

===Relative Clauses===
In Chimariko, relativization can be done one of two ways - using a special verb suffix ''-rop/-rot'' to form internally headed clauses, and or by a headless relative clause. There is a relative pronoun ''map'un'' that is sometimes used.&lt;ref name="Jany, 2007"/&gt;
JP Harrington field note example found in Jany (2007):
     ''map’un hokoteˀrot yečiˀ ˀimiˀnan''
     ''['''map’un'''    h-oko-teˀ-'''rot'''] y-ečiˀ     ˀi-miˀn-an''
     that.one   3-?-DER-DEP    1SG.A-buy  1SG-want-ASP
     I want to buy that engraved one.
     The relative clause is in brackets. '''map’un''' is the head.

The '''''Confutatio Augustana''''' was the [[Roman Catholic]] refutation ([[confutation]]) of the ''[[Augsburg Confession]]'', often referred to in the theological literature as simply the ''Confutatio''.

On 25 June 1530 the Protestant [[Imperial States]] of the realm met at the [[Diet of Augsburg]], and presented [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] with the Augsburg Confession, largely the work of [[Philipp Melanchthon]] setting out the doctrines and practices of the church in the [[Protestation at Speyer|Protestant principalities]]. The emperor commissioned the papal theologians to prepare a response. An initial version of the ''Confutatio'' was rejected by the emperor, as excessively polemic and verbose. In formulating the ''Confutatio'', the lead was taken by Johann Eck. On 3 August 1530, the final version was read at the Diet. The ''Confutatio'' clearly rejected the statements of the Augsburg Confession, and called for a return to the Roman doctrine.

In other respects, however, the ''Confutatio'' found common ground with the Augsburg Confession. Emperor Charles V refused to hand over the text to the Protestants, unless they agreed not to respond, which they refused. But the Protestants had transcribed it as it was read. Melanchthon responded with the ''[[Apology of the Augsburg Confession]]'', completed in 1531, but not presented to the emperor.

The distinction is used regularly in [[metaphysics]] and in [[philosophy of language]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://semanticsarchive.net/Archive/DU3YTgyN/Attributive,%20referential,%20de%20dicto%20and%20de%20re.pdf Semantics Archive] discussion&lt;/ref&gt;

The literal translation of the phrase "''de dicto''" is "about what is said",&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/de-dicto&lt;/ref&gt; whereas ''de re'' translates as "about the thing".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/de-re?q=de+re&lt;/ref&gt; The original meaning of the Latin locutions may help to elucidate the living meaning of the phrases, in the distinctions they mark. The distinction can be understood by examples of intensional contexts of which three are considered here: a context of thought, a context of desire, and a context of [[modal logic|modality]].

==Context of thought==
There are two possible interpretations of the sentence "Peter believes someone is out to get him".  On one interpretation, 'someone' is unspecific and Peter suffers a general paranoia; he believes that it is true that a person is out to get him, but does not necessarily have any beliefs about who this person may be.  What Peter believes is that the predicate 'is out to get Peter' is satisfied.  This is the ''de dicto'' interpretation.

On the ''de re'' interpretation, 'someone' is specific, picking out some particular individual.  There is some person Peter has in mind, and Peter believes that person is out to get him.

In the context of thought, the distinction helps us explain how people can hold seemingly self-contradictory beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;  Say [[Lois Lane]] believes [[Clark Kent]] is weaker than [[Superman]].  Since Clark Kent is Superman, taken ''de re'', Lois's belief is untenable; the names 'Clark Kent' and 'Superman' pick out an individual in the world, and a person (or super-person) cannot be stronger than himself.  Understood ''de dicto'', however, this may be a perfectly reasonable belief, since Lois is not aware that Clark and Superman are one and the same.

==Context of desire==

Consider the sentence "Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County". It could be read either ''de dicto'' or ''de re''; the meanings would be different. One interpretation is that Jana wants to marry the tallest man in Fulsom County, whoever he might be.  On this interpretation, what the statement tells us is that Jana has a certain unspecific desire; what she desires is that a certain situation should obtain, namely, ''Jana's marrying the tallest man in Fulsom County''.  The desire is directed at that situation, regardless of how it is to be achieved.  The other interpretation is that Jana wants to marry a certain man, who in fact happens to be the tallest man in Fulsom County.  Her desire is for ''that man'', and she desires herself to marry ''him''.  Again, the first interpretation, "Jana desires that she marry the tallest man in Fulsom County", is the ''de dicto'' interpretation. The second interpretation, "Of the tallest man in Fulsom County, Jana desires that she marry him", is the ''de re'' interpretation.

Another way to understand the distinction is to ask what Jana would want if the man who was the tallest man in Fulsom County, at the time the original statement was made, were to lose his accolade to a 9 foot tall immigrant, such that he was no longer the tallest man in Fulsom County.  If she continued to want to marry that man &amp;ndash; and, importantly, perceived this as representing no change in her desires &amp;ndash; then she could be taken to have meant the original statement in a ''de re'' sense.  If she no longer wanted to marry that man but instead wanted to marry the ''new'' tallest man in Fulsom County, and saw this as a continuation of her earlier desire, then she meant the original statement in a ''de dicto'' sense.

==Context of modality==
The number of discovered [[chemical element]]s is 118. Take the sentence "The number of chemical elements is necessarily greater than 100". Again, there are two interpretations as per the ''de dicto''/''de re'' distinction. According to the ''de dicto'' interpretation, even if the inner workings of the atom could differ, there could not be fewer than 100 elements. The second interpretation, ''de re'', is that things could not have gone differently with the number 118 turning out to be fewer than 100. Intuitively, this claim is true. Of all the ways the world could have turned out, presumably there are no possibilities wherein 118 is fewer than 100. That 118 is greater than 100 is a necessary fact. The ''de dicto'' interpretation seems to yield a false statement. The ''de re'' interpretation seems to yield a true statement.

Another example: "The [[President of the USA]] in 2001 could not have been [[Al Gore]]". This claim seems false on a ''de dicto'' reading. Presumably, things could have gone differently, with the [[SCOTUS|Supreme Court]] not [[Bush v. Gore|claiming]] that Bush had won the [[United States presidential election, 2000|election]]. But it looks more plausible on a ''de re'' reading. After all, we might skeptically wonder of [[George W. Bush]] whether ''he'' could have been Al Gore. Indeed, assuming that ''being George Bush'' is an essential feature of George Bush and that this feature is incompatible with being Al Gore, a ''de re'' reading of the statement is true.

==Representing ''de dicto'' and ''de re'' in modal logic==
{{also|Vivid designator}}
In [[modal logic]] the distinction between ''de dicto'' and ''de re'' is one of scope. In ''de dicto'' claims, any existential [[Quantification (logic)|quantifiers]] are within the scope of the modal operator, whereas in ''de re'' claims the modal operator falls within the scope of the existential quantifier. For example:

{| border="0"
| ''De dicto'':
| &lt;math&gt;\Box \exists{x} Ax&lt;/math&gt;
| Necessarily, some ''x'' is such that it is ''A''
|-
| ''De re'':
| &lt;math&gt;\exists{x} \Box Ax&lt;/math&gt;
| Some ''x'' is such that it is necessarily ''A''
|}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2735">The '''extended projection principle''' ('''EPP''') is a [[Linguistics|linguistic]] hypothesis about [[Subject_(grammar)|subjects]].  It was proposed by [[Noam Chomsky]] as an addendum to the [[projection principle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
| last       = Chomsky
| first      = Noam

}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The basic idea of the EPP is that clauses must contain a [[noun phrase]] or [[determiner phrase]] in the subject position (i.e. in the [[Specifier (linguistics)|specifier]] of a [[tense phrase]] or [[inflectional phrase]] or in the specifier of a [[verb phrase]] in languages in which subjects don't [[Raising (linguistics)|raise]] to TP/IP, e.g. [[Welsh language|Welsh]]).

==Details==
Most verbs require meaningful subjects—for example, "kick" in "Tom kicked the ball" takes the subject "Tom".  However, other verbs do not require (and in fact, do not permit) meaningful subjects—for example, one can say "it rains" but not "the sky rains".  The EPP states that regardless of whether the main predicate assigns a meaningful [[theta role]] to a subject, a subject must be present syntactically.  As a result, verbs which do not assign external theta roles will appear with subjects that are either [[dummy pronoun]]s (e.g. expletive "it," "there"), or ones which have been moved into subject position from a lower position (e.g. subject of an embedded clause which comes after the verbs like ''seem'', ''appear'' etc. ).

Examples which have been proposed to be the result of expletive subject insertion in accordance with the EPP:

#It seemed that John would never calm down.
#It ( rains / snows / hails / etc. ) frequently in Quebec.
#There seems to be a problem with the radiator.

Notice that in all of these the overt subject has no ''referential'' reading.

In languages that allow [[pro-drop]] (such as Spanish or Italian), the empty category [[Empty_category#pro (little pro)|''pro'']] (not to be confused with Big [[PRO (linguistics)|PRO]]) can fulfill the requirement of the EPP.

McCloskey (1996) proposed that there is one group of languages that lacks the EPP: the [[verb–subject–object|VSO]] languages (like Irish), which appear not only to lack expletives, but also to lack [[syntactic movement|movement]] operations triggered by the EPP.&lt;ref&gt;McCloskey, James (1996).  "Subjects and subject positions in Irish."  In Robert D. Borsley and Ian G. Roberts (eds.), ''The syntax of the Celtic languages: a comparative perspective'', pp. 241-283.  Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="63481">An '''extrajudicial killing''' (also known as '''extrajudicial execution''') is the killing of a person by governmental authorities without the sanction of any [[Judiciary|judicial proceeding]] or legal process. [[Extrajudicial punishment]]s are mostly seen by humanity to be unethical, since they bypass the [[due process]] of the legal jurisdiction in which they occur.{{Citation needed|date=April 2016}} Extrajudicial killings often target leading political, trade union, dissident, religious, and social figures and are only those carried out by the [[State (polity)|state]] government or other state authorities like the armed forces or police, as extra-legal fulfillment of their prescribed role.

Section 3(a) of the [[United States]] [[Torture Victim Protection Act]] contains a definition of extrajudicial killing:

{{quote|a deliberate killing not authorized by a previous judgment pronounced by a regular constituted court affording all the judicial guarantees which are recognized as indispensable by civilized peoples. Such term, however, does not include any such killing that, under international law, is lawfully carried out under the authority of a foreign nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Congressional Record, V. 147, Pt. 6, May 9, 2001 to May 21 2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hCYK7X_SqHIC&amp;pg=PA7897|date=October 2005|publisher=United States Government Printing Office|page=7897|id=GGKEY:2126SDPKSFJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The legal exclusion in the sentence that starts "Such term, however ..." covers the killing of [[enemy combatant]]s and others who are not protected under international law from extrajudicial killing.}} }}

[[Argentina]]'s dictatorial government during the 1976–1983 period used extrajudicial killings systematically as way of crushing the opposition in the so-called "[[Dirty War]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-131783-2009-09-15.html Veinticinco años del informe de la Conadep] {{sp icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; or what is known in Spanish as ''La Guerra Sucia''.

In 1999 [[Belarus]]ian opposition leaders [[Yury Zacharanka]] and [[Viktar Hanchar]] together with his business associate [[Anatol Krasouski]] disappeared. Hanchar and Krasouski disappeared the same day of a broadcast on state television in which President [[Alexander Lukashenko]] ordered the chiefs of his security services to crack down on “opposition scum”. Although the [[State Security Committee of the Republic of Belarus]] (KGB) had them under constant surveillance, the official investigation announced that the case could not be solved. The disappearance of journalist [[Dzmitry Zavadski]] in 2000 has also yielded no results. Copies of a report by the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe, which linked senior Belarusian officials to the cases of disappearances, were confiscated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=16 Years of Silence: Enforced Disappearances in Belarus Must Be Investigated |url=http://blog.amnestyusa.org/europe/16-years-of-silence-enforced-disappearances-in-belarus-must-be-investigated/  | newspaper=[[Amnesty International]]|date=18 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Human Rights Watch]] claims that Zacharanka, Hanchar, Krasouski and Zavadski likely became victims of extrajudicial executions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=World Report: Belarus:

These included Manuel Contreras, the former head of Chile's [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|National Intelligence Directorate]] (DINA), which served as Pinochet's [[Secret police|secret police.]] He was behind numerous assassinations and human rights abuses such as the 1974 abduction and [[forced disappearance]] of Socialist Party leader [[Victor Olea Alegria]]. Some of the killings were also coordinated with other right-wing dictatorships in the Southern Cone in the so-called [[Operation Condor]]. There were reports of United States' Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) involvement, particularly within its activities in Central and South America that promoted anti-Communist coups.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Ops: The Rise of Special Forces in the CIA, the SAS, and Mossad|last=Geraghty|first=Tony|publisher=Pegasus Books|year=2012|isbn=9781605987613|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While CIA's complicity was not proven, American dollars supported the regimes that carried out extrajudicial killings such as the Pinochet administration.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CIA, for instance, helped create DINA and the agency admitted that Contreras was one of its assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Predatory States: Operation Condor and Covert War in Latin America|last=McSherry|first=Patrice|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc.|year=2005|isbn=9780742536876|location=Lanham, MD|pages=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== El Salvador ==
During the [[El Salvador Civil War|Salvadoran civil war]], death squads achieved notoriety when far-right vigilantes assassinated Archbishop [[Óscar Romero]] for his social activism in March 1980. In December 1980, [[1980 murders of U.S. missionaries in El Salvador|four Americans—three nuns and a lay worker—were raped and murdered]] by a military unit later found to have been acting on specific orders. Death squads were instrumental in killing hundreds of peasants and activists, including such notable priests as [[Rutilio Grande]]. Because the death squads involved were found to have been soldiers of the Salvadoran military, which was receiving U.S. funding and training from American advisors during the [[Jimmy Carter|Carter]] administration, these events prompted outrage in the U.S. and led to a temporary cutoff in military aid from the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration,{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} although death squad activity stretched well into the Reagan years (1981–1989) as well.

== Honduras ==
Honduras also had death squads active through the 1980s, the most notorious of which was [[Battalion 316]].  Hundreds of people, including teachers, politicians and union bosses, were assassinated by government-backed forces. Battalion 316 received substantial support and training from the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bal-negroponte1a-story.html|title=When a wave of torture and murder staggered a small U.S. ally, truth was a casualty.|first=Gary Cohn and Ginger|last=Thompson|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iran ==
{{See also|Chain Murders of Iran}}

In 1953 a regime was installed through the efforts of the American [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British [[MI6]] in which the Shah (hereditary monarch) [[Mohammad Reza Pahlavi]] used [[SAVAK]] death squads (also trained by the CIA) to imprison, torture and/or kill hundreds of dissidents.  After the [[Iranian Revolution|1979 revolution]] death squads were used to an even greater extent by the new Islamic government. In 1983, the CIA gave the Supreme Leader of Iran—[[Ruhollah Khomeini|Ayatollah Khomeini]]—information on [[KGB]] agents in Iran. This information was probably used. The Iranian government later used death squads occasionally throughout the 1970s, 1980s, and 1990s; however by the 2000s it seems to have almost entirely, if not completely, ceased using them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/tehranbureau/2009/12/the-chain-murders-1988-1998.html|title=The Chain Murders|date=December 14, 2009|accessdate=October 29, 2018|website=Tehran Bureau|publisher=PBS|last=Sahim|first=Muhammad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Iraq ==
[[Iraq]] was formed by the partition and domination of various tribal lands by the British in the early 20th century. Britain granted independence to Iraq in 1932, on the urging of [[Faisal I of Iraq|King Faisal]], though the British retained military bases and transit rights for their forces. [[King Ghazi]] of Iraq ruled as a figurehead after King Faisal's death in 1933, while undermined by attempted military coups, until his death in 1939. The United Kingdom invaded Iraq in 1941 (see [[Anglo-Iraqi War]]), for fear that the government of [[Rashid Ali al-Gaylani]] might cut oil supplies to Western nations, and because of his links to the [[Axis powers]]. A military occupation followed the restoration of the Hashemite monarchy, and the occupation ended on October 26, 1947. Iraq was left with a national government led from [[Baghdad]] made up of [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] ethnicity in key positions of power, ruling over an ad-hoc nation splintered by tribal affiliations. This leadership used death squads and committed massacres in Iraq throughout the 20th century, culminating in the dictatorship of Saddam Hussein.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailykos.com/storyonly/2006/9/13/14133/1410/|title=History of Iraq: 1933 - 1939|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country has since become increasingly partitioned following the [[Iraq War]] into three zones: a [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Kurdish ethnic zone]] to the north, a Sunni center and the [[Shia Islam|Shia]] ethnic zone to the south. The [[Secularism|secular]] [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] [[Ba'ath Party|Baathist]] leadership were replaced with a provisional and later constitutional government that included leadership roles for the Shia (Prime Minister) and Kurdish (President of the Republic) peoples of the nation. This paralleled the development of ethnic militias by the Shia, Sunni, and the Kurdish ([[Peshmerga]]).

There were [[death squad]]s formed by members of every ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=U.S. cracks down on Iraq death squads |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/WORLD/meast/07/24/iraq.main/index.html |publisher=CNN |date=2006-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the national capital of Baghdad some members of the now-Shia police department and army (and militia members posing as members of police or armed forces) formed unofficial, unsanctioned, but long-tolerated death squads.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/Iraq/Story/0,,1869439,00.html |work=The Guardian |location=London |title=US patrols to weed out militias posing as Iraqi police |first=Peter |last=Beaumont |date=September 11, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; They possibly had links to the Interior Ministry and were popularly known as the 'black crows'.

The victims of these attacks were predominantly young males who had probably been suspected of being members of the Sunni [[insurgency]]. Agitators such as Abdul Razaq al-Na'as, Dr. Abdullateef al-Mayah, and Dr. Wissam Al-Hashimi have also been killed. These killings are not limited to men; women and children have also been arrested and/or killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='25,000 civilians' killed in Iraq |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4692589.stm |publisher=BBC |date=2005-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these killings have also been part of simple robberies or other criminal activities.

A feature in a May 2005 issue of the magazine of the ''New York Times'' claimed that the U.S. military had modelled the "Wolf Brigade", the Iraqi interior ministry police commandos, on the death squads used in the 1980s to crush the left-wing insurgency in [[El Salvador]].&lt;ref name=Nytimes050501&gt;{{cite news |title=The Way of the Commandos |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/01/magazine/01ARMY.html?ei=5088&amp;en=f0604488a64924cd&amp;ex=1272686400&amp;pagewanted=all&amp;position= |publisher=The New York Times |date=2005-05-01 |first=Peter |last=Maass |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Western news organizations such as [[Time (magazine)|''Time'']] and [[People (magazine)|''People'']] disassembled this by focusing on aspects such as probable [[militia]] membership, religious ethnicity, as well as uniforms worn by these squads rather than stating the [[United States]]-backed Iraqi government had death squads active in the Iraqi capital of Baghdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/4719252.stm |publisher=BBC News |title=Iraq 'death squad caught in act' |date=February 16, 2006 |accessdate=May 2, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Soviet Union and Russia ==
In [[Bolshevist Russia|Soviet Russia]] since 1918 [[Cheka]] was authorized to execute "counterevolutionaries" without trial. Hostages were also executed by Cheka during the [[Red Terror]] in 1918–1920.

The [[Chronology of Soviet secret police agencies|successors of Cheka]] also had the authority for extrajudicial executions. In 1937–38 hundreds of thousands where executed extrajudicially during the [[Great Purge]] under the lists approved by [[NKVD troika]]s. In some cases the Soviet special services did not arrest and then execute their victims but just secretly killed them without any arrest. For example, [[Solomon Mikhoels]] was murdered in 1948 and his body was run over to create the impression of a traffic accident. The Soviet special services also conducted extrajudicial killings abroad, most notably of [[Leon Trotskiy]] in 1940 in [[Mexico]], [[Stepan Bandera]] in 1959 in Germany, [[Georgi Markov]] in 1978 in London.

In the [[Russian Federation]], a number of journalist murders were attributed to public administration figures, usually where the publications would reveal their involvement in large corruption scandals.

It has been regarded that the [[Alexander Litvinenko assassination theories|Alexander Litvinenko]] murder was linked to Russian special forces.

USA and UK intelligence agents reportedly claim that Russian assassins, some possibly at orders of the government, are behind at least fourteen [[targeted killing]]s on British soil that police called non-suspicious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/uk-police-evidence-russian-assassins-behind-14-suspicious-deaths-british-soil-boris-berezovsky-scot-a7793151.html|title=UK authorities 'overlooked' evidence linking Russia to deaths on British soil|date=16 June 2017|work=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legality of killings such as in the [[death of Osama bin Laden]] in 2011 have been brought into question. In that case, the US defended itself claiming the killing was not an assassination but an act of "National Self Defense".&lt;ref name=OBLQ&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lewis|first1=Aiden|title=Osama Bin Laden: Legality of Killing questioned|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372|accessdate=June 16, 2017|agency=BBC News|publisher=BBC News|date=May 12, 2011|ref=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-13318372}}&lt;/ref&gt;
There had been just under 2,500 assassinations by targeted [[drone strike]]  by 2015, and these too have questioned as being extrajudicial killings.&lt;ref name="Drone Strikes"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Serle|first1=Jack|title=Almost 2,500 now killed by cover US drone strikes|url=https://www.thebureauinvestigates.com/stories/2015-02-02/almost-2-500-now-killed-by-covert-us-drone-strikes-since-obama-inauguration-six-years-ago-the-bureaus-report-for-january-2015|website=The Bureau|accessdate=May 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Galactic Derelict''''' is a science fiction novel by American writer [[Andre Norton]], the second in her '' Time Traders'' series. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Schlobin, Roger C. |author2=Harrison, Irene R. |title=Andre Norton: A Primary and Secondary Bibliography |ISBN=0-915368-64-1 |publisher=NESFA Press |location=Framingham, Massachusetts |year=1994 |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first published in 1959, and as of 2012, had been reprinted in eight editions. It is part of Norton's ''Forerunner'' universe.

''Galactic Derelict'' continues the series’ premise, an encounter between Western heroes and a mysterious alien race that has used time travel to alter Earth. This novel shifts between present day and the time of [[Folsom tradition|Folsom Man]], some 10,000&amp;nbsp;years ago.

''[[Kirkus Reviews]]'' comments for this novel “Andre Norton has no peer in his [&amp;#x200B;[[sic]]&amp;#x200B;] chosen field of science fiction for teenagers ... [here] there’s a hint of racial antagonism.” (The novel has pointed comments about racism against American Indians.)

In the 2000 republished version Norton changed the word Reds to Russians. No change was made in the story.

==Plot==
While seeking water for his cattle Travis Fox enters a little known canyon in the Arizona desert and gets captured by three men, one of whom he recognizes as Dr.&amp;nbsp;Gordon Ashe, an archaeologist. After discovering that Fox studied archaeology and had done some digging in the very canyon they now occupy, the men have him cleared through security and offer to make him part of their team. Then Ashe tells him that he will be joining an expedition 10,000&amp;nbsp;years into the past to look for a spaceship.

Disguised as Folsom hunters, Fox, Ashe, and Ross Murdock travel into the past to scout out the area around the wreckage of an alien starship, a sphere perhaps 120&amp;nbsp;feet in diameter. They find the wreck near a lake and then, across a ridge, they find a smaller spaceship intact, its crew of Baldies dead. After receiving the scouts’ report via transtemporal telegraph, Major Kelgarries, the project’s director, and several technicians come into the past and examine the small ship, determining that they can shift it directly into the present.

Fox, Ashe, and Murdock serve as roving sentries in the area around the smaller globeship as technicians build a time transfer cage around it. The ash from a volcanic explosion and a stampede of mammoths drive the three men into the ship with Case Renfry, an electronics technician, on the day the transfer is to be made. An earthquake triggers the transfer, bringing the ship into the present, and then the ship’s preset autopilot, jolted into action, takes the ship into space.

After carrying the men through hyperspace, the ship lands on a planet where faltering robots refuel the ship. Another leap through hyperspace brings the ship to the second planet of an alien solar system. The ship lands in a desert, sits for a couple of days, and then blasts off on a course that takes it to the system’s Earth-like third planet. Upon landing the ship indicates that the voyage has ended by ejecting a small discus from its autopilot.

Renfry attempts to understand the autopilot and to rewind the course “tape” while the three time agents explore the jungle-draped ruins of a once-great city, in which they have landed. After several weeks Renfry believes that he has succeeded and he attempts to launch the ship. The ship runs its course in reverse, pausing on the desert planet and the refueling station, and brings the four men back to Earth, landing on the very spot from which they had blasted off.

==Reviews==
Unaware that Norton was a woman, the reviewer at ''Kirkus Review'' (1&amp;nbsp;October1959  issue) wrote: 
{{bquote|Andre Norton has no peer in his chosen field of science fiction for teenagers. This time his [&amp;#x200B;[[sic]]&amp;#x200B;] story involves an expedition in both time and space, as some young scientists – and a chance-involved "rider for the Double&amp;nbsp;A", Travis, who had been a student in the field of archaeology, set forth on a journey to repossess a lost space ship. Where their journey takes them provides breathless adventures in other worlds, with other-world creatures. Ingenuity, basic knowledge flexibly applied, and dauntless courage provide the handholds for success and a safe (though somewhat shattered) return. There's a hint of racial antagonism – a chip on the shoulder attitude at the start – for Travis is an Apache but it has a negligible part in the story, though Travis' background and training stand him in good stead.&lt;ref name="kirkusreviews.com"&gt;https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/andre-norton/galactic-derelict/&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Floyd C. Gale]] of ''[[Galaxy Science Fiction]]'' rated the novel five stars out of five for children, stating that it had "All the classic elements that make a good juvenile – or a good adult book, for that matter – are present in full measure in ''Galactic Derelict''". He concluded that it was "a top-notch science-adventure yarn".&lt;ref name="gale196006"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://archive.org/stream/Galaxy_v18n05_1960-06#page/n149/mode/2up |title=Galaxy's 5 Star Shelf |last=Gale |first=Floyd C. |date=June 1960 |magazine=Galaxy Science Fiction |pages=151-155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''garden-path sentence''' is a grammatically correct [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]] that starts in such a way that a reader's most likely interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a [[parsing|parse]] that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning. "Garden path" refers to the saying "[[wikt:lead someone down the garden path|to be led down [or up] the garden path]]", meaning to be deceived, tricked, or seduced.

Such a sentence leads the reader toward a seemingly familiar meaning that is actually not the one intended. It is a special type of sentence that creates a momentarily ambiguous interpretation because it contains a word or phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways, causing the reader to begin to believe that a phrase will mean one thing when in reality it means something else. When read, the sentence seems ungrammatical, makes almost no sense, and often requires rereading so that its meaning may be fully understood after careful parsing.

==Examples==
* "The horse raced past the barn fell."
*: This frequently used, classic example of a garden-path sentence is attributed to [[Thomas Bever]]. The sentence is hard to parse because ''race'' can be interpreted as a finite verb or as a passive participle. The reader initially interprets ''raced'' as the main verb in the simple past, but when the reader encounters ''fell'', they are forced to re-analyse the sentence, concluding that ''raced'' is being used as a past participle and ''horse'' is the direct object of the subordinate clause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Humorous Garden-Paths: A Pragmatic-Cognitive Study |last= Dynel |first=Marta|isbn=978-1-443-81228-3 |url= https://books.google.de/books?id=Ol1JDAAAQBAJ |date= 2009 |publisher= Cambridge Scholars Publisher |pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sentence could be replaced by ''The horse that was raced past the barn fell'', where ''that was raced past the barn'' tells the reader which horse is under discussion.&lt;ref name = "Bever (1970)"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bever |first1=Thomas G. |authorlink1=Thomas Bever |editor1-last=Sanz |editor1-first=Montserrat |editor2-last=Laka |editor2-first=Itziar |editor3-last=Tanenhaus |editor3-first=Michael K. |title=Language Down the Garden Path: The Cognitive and Biological Basis for Linguistic Structures |series=Oxford Studies in Biolinguistics |publisher=Oxford University Press |date=1 January 2001 |orig-year=Originally published in R. Hayes (ed.) ''Cognition and Language Development (New York: Wiley &amp; Sons, 1970, 279–362) |pages=1–80 |chapter=The cognitive basis for linguistic structures (reprint) |isbn=978-0-199-67713-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such examples of initial ambiguity resulting from a "reduced relative with [a] potentially intransitive verb" (''The horse raced in the barn fell.'') can be contrasted with the lack of ambiguity for a non-reduced relative (''The horse '''that was''' raced in the barn fell.'') or with a [[reduced relative clause|reduced relative]] with an unambiguously transitive verb (''The horse frightened in the barn fell.''). As with other examples, one explanation for the initial misunderstanding by the reader is that a sequence of phrases tends to be analysed in terms of the frequent pattern: ''[[agent (grammar)|agent]]'' – ''action'' – ''[[patient (grammar)|patient]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |pages=7–8|last1=Bever |first1=David J. |last2=Bever |first2=Thomas G. |authorlink2=Thomas Bever|title= Sentence Comprehension: The Integration of Habits and Rules |publisher= Bradford Books |date= 2001 |isbn=978-0-262-70080-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The old man the boat."
*: This is another common example that has been the subject of psycholinguistic research and has been used to test the capabilities of artificial intelligence efforts.&lt;ref name = "Washington Post (2016)"&gt;{{cite web | last1= Guo |first1=Jeff |title= Google’s new artificial intelligence can’t understand these sentences. Can you? |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/wonk/wp/2016/05/18/googles-new-artificial-intelligence-cant-understand-these-sentences-can-you/ |date= 18 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The difficulty in correctly parsing the sentence results from the fact that readers tend to interpret ''old'' as an adjective. Reading ''the'', they expect a noun or an adjective to follow, and when they then read ''old'' followed by ''man'' they assume that the phrase ''the old man'' is to be interpreted as ''determiner'' – ''adjective'' – ''noun''. When readers encounter another ''the'' following the supposed noun ''man'' (rather than the expected verb),{{efn|Experiments that measured readers' reaction times after each word indicated that "the reaction time following the disambiguating word [''the'' or ''washed'' following ''man''] is significantly greater for the garden path than for the normal sentence."&lt;ref name = "Di Sciullo (2005)"/&gt;}} they are forced to re-analyse the sentence. This example of initial ambiguity (''The old man the boat.'') can be contrasted with the lack of ambiguity of a similar but unambiguous sentence where ''man'' is followed by a verb (''The old man washed the boat''). As with other examples, one explanation for the initial misunderstanding by the reader is that a sequence of words or phrases tends to be analysed in terms of a frequent pattern: in this case: ''determiner'' – ''adjective'' – ''noun''.&lt;ref name = "Di Sciullo (2005)"&gt;{{cite book |pages=225–226|last1= Di Sciullo |first1=Anna-Maria |title= UG and External Systems: Language, Brain and Computation |publisher= Benjamins |date= 2005 |isbn= 978-9-027-22799-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families."
*: This is another commonly cited example.&lt;ref name = "Petrie (2016)"&gt;{{cite book |page=463|last1= Petrie |first1=H. |last2= Darzentas |first2=J. |last3= Walsh |first3=T. |title= Universal Design 2016: Learning from the Past, Designing for the Future: Proceedings of the 3rd International Conference on Universal Design (UD 2016), York, United Kingdom, August 21 – 24, 2016|publisher= IOS Press|date= 2016|isbn= 978-1-614-99684-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the previous sentence, the initial parse is to read ''the complex houses'' as a noun phrase, but ''the complex houses married'' does not make semantic sense (houses do not marry) and ''the complex houses married and single'' makes no sense at all (after ''married and...'', the expectation is another verb to form a compound predicate). The correct parsing is ''The complex'' [noun phrase] ''houses'' [verb] ''married and single soldiers'' [noun phrase] ''and their families'' [noun phrase]. Rephrased, the sentence could be rewritten as ''The complex provides shelter for the soldiers, married or single, as well as their families''.

==Parsing==
When reading a sentence, readers will analyze the words and phrases they see and make inferences about the sentence’s grammatical structure and meaning in a process called parsing. Generally, readers will parse the sentence chunks at a time and will try to interpret the meaning of the sentence at each interval. As readers are given more information they make an assumption of the contents and meaning of the whole sentence. With each new portion of the sentence encountered, they will try to make that part make sense with the sentence structures that they have already interpreted and their assumption about the rest of the sentence. The garden-path sentence effect occurs when the sentence has a phrase or word with an [[semantic ambiguity|ambiguous meaning]] that the reader interprets in a certain way, and when they read the whole sentence there is a difference in what has been read and what was expected. The reader must then read and evaluate the sentence again to understand its meaning. The sentence may be parsed and interpreted in different ways due to the influence of pragmatics, semantics, or other factors describing the extralinguistic context.&lt;ref&gt;Reisberg, D. (2010). Cognition: Exploring the science of the mind. (4 ed.). New York, NY: W.W. Norton &amp; Company, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Parsing strategies===
Various strategies can be used when parsing a sentence, and there is much debate over which parsing strategy humans use. Differences in parsing strategies can be seen from the effects of a reader attempting to parse a part of a sentence that is ambiguous in its syntax or meaning. For this reason, garden-path sentences are often studied as a way to test which strategy humans use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hickok |first=Gregory |title=Parallel parsing: Evidence from reactivation in garden-path sentences |journal=Journal of Psycholinguistic Research Journal of Psycholinguistic Research |year=1993 |volume=22 |issue=2 |pages=239–250 |doi=10.1007/BF01067832 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/tm436pt0525g7423/ |accessdate=16 November 2012 |issn=0090-6905}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two debated parsing strategies that humans are thought to use are serial and parallel parsing.

====Serial====
Serial parsing means that the reader makes one interpretation of the ambiguity, and continues to parse the sentence in the context of that interpretation. The reader will continue to use the initial interpretation as reference for future parsing until disambiguating information is given.&lt;ref name=Meng&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Meng |first1=Michael |last2=Bader | first2=Markus |title=Ungrammaticality detection and garden path strength: Evidence for serial parsing |journal=Language and Cognitive Processes |year=2000 |volume=15 |issue=6 |pages=615–666 |doi=10.1080/016909600750040580 |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/016909600750040580 |accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parallel====
Parallel parsing means that the reader generates multiple interpretations of the sentence and stores them until disambiguating information is given, at which point only the correct interpretation is maintained.&lt;ref name=Meng /&gt;

==Reanalysis of a garden-path sentence==
When ambiguous nouns appear, they can function as both the object of the first item or the subject of the second item. In that case the former use is preferred. It is also found that the reanalysis of a garden-path sentence gets more and more difficult with the length of the ambiguous phrase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ferreria | first1 = F. | last2 = Henderson | first2 = J. | year = 1991 | title = Recovery from misanalyses of garden-path sentences | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 30 | issue = 6| pages = 725–745 | doi=10.1016/0749-596x(91)90034-h}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recovery strategies===
A research paper published by Meseguer, Carreiras and Clifton (2002) stated that intensive eye movements are observed when people are recovering from a mild garden-path sentence. They proposed that people use two strategies, both of which are consistent with the selective reanalysis process described by Frazier and Rayner in 1982. According to them, the readers predominantly use two alternative strategies to recover from mild garden-path sentences. 
* The more common one includes the regression of eyes from the first disambiguation directly to the main verb of the sentence. Then the readers reread the remaining of the sentence, fixating their eyes to the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence).
* The lesser-used strategy includes the regression from the first disambiguation directly to the adverb.&lt;ref&gt;Meseguer, E., Carreiras, M., &amp; Clifton, C. (2002). Overt reanalysis strategies and eye movements during the reading of mild garden path sentences. Published in partnership with the Psychonomic Society, 30(4), 551–561.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Partial reanalysis===
Partial reanalysis occurs when analysis is not complete. Frequently, when people can make even a little bit of sense of the later sentence, they stop analyzing further so the former part of the sentence still remains in memory and does not get discarded from it.

Therefore, the original misinterpretation of the sentence remains even after the reanalysis is done; hence participants' final interpretations are often incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Patson | first1 = N. D. | last2 = Darowski | first2 = E. S. | last3 = Moon | first3 = N. | last4 = Ferreria | first4 = F. | year = 2009 | title = Lingering misinterpretations in garden-path sentences: Evidence from a paraphrasing task | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages = 280–285 | doi=10.1037/a0014276}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Brain processing in computation==
&lt;!-- "Disfluency" is used but not defined --&gt;
One way to determine the brain processes involved is the use of brain [[electrophysiology]]. Brain electrophysiology is used to study the impact of disfluencies{{clarify|date=February 2013}} in sentence processing by the brain, which specifically use [[event-related potentials]] (ERPs). ERPs are voltages generated by the brain that can be measured through a device placed on the scalp. It is also observed that specific components of the ERPs can be associated with the activation of different and specific linguistic processes of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Osterhout, L., McLaughlin, J., Kim, A., Greenwald, R., &amp; Inoue, K. (2004). Sentences in
the brain: Event-related potentials as real-time reflects of sentence comprehension and language learning. In M. Carreiras &amp; C. Clifton, Jr. (Eds.), The on-line study of sentence comprehension: Eyetracking ERP and beyond. Psychology Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Within ERPs, [[P600 (neuroscience)|P600]] is the most important component. Its activation occurs when the parser comes across a syntactic violation such as ''The broker persuaded to sell the stock''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osterhout | first1 = L. | last2 = Holcomb | first2 = P. | year = 1992 | title = Event-related brain potentials elicited by syntactic anomaly | url = | journal = Journal of Memory and Language | volume = 31 | issue = | pages = 785–804 | doi=10.1016/0749-596x(92)90039-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; or when the parser synthesizes an unsatisfactory disambiguation on an ambiguous string of words such as ''The doctor charged the patient was lying''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Osterhout | first1 = L. | last2 = Holcomb | first2 = P. J. | last3 = Swinney | first3 = D. A. | year = 1994 | title = Brain potentials elicited by garden-path sentences: Evidence of the application of verb information during parsing | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 20 | issue = | pages = 786–803 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.20.4.786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the activation of P600 marks the parser's attempt to revise the sentence's structural mis-match or ambiguity. However it is also observed that the activation of P600 may be low or completely absent if the parser is asked to pay attention only to the semantic aspects of a sentence either through an explicit instruction&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hahne | first1 = A. | last2 = Friederici | first2 = A. D. | year = 2002 | title = Differential task effects on semantic and syntactic processes as revealed by ERPs | url = | journal = Cognitive Brain Research | volume = 13 | issue = | pages = 339–356 | doi=10.1016/s0926-6410(01)00127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; or through the use of specific words as a way to force a semantic analysis of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gunter | first1 = T. C. | last2 = Friederici | first2 = A. D. | last3 = Schriefers | first3 = H. | year = 2000 | title = Syntactic gender and semantic expectancy: ERPs reveal early autonomy and late interaction | url = | journal = Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience | volume = 12 | issue = | pages = 556–568 | doi=10.1162/089892900562336}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of yet another study conducted by Osterhout in 1997 reveal that the activation of P600 varies with the parser's own attentions to the syntactic violations of the sentence.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=Osterhout, L. |pmid=9299074 |year=1997 |title=On the brain response to syntactic anomalies: Manipulations of word position and word class reveal individual differences |journal=Brain &amp; Language |volume=59 |pages=494–522 |doi=10.1006/brln.1997.1793}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The effects of disfluency==
[[Speech disfluency|Disfluent]] sentences have a direct effect on the way a sentence structure is built in the parser's mind. Depending on its location within a sentence, a disfluency either aids in the computation of a sentence or forces the parser to linger on the sentence for a longer period of time. It is observed that the more an individual lingers on an incorrect parse, the more it is likely that the sentence will end up being interpreted incorrectly. It also appears{{clarify|date=November 2013}} that the presence of a disfluency in a sentence—caused by filled and long silent parses—does not elicit the P600. Instead, it elicits another [[Event-related potential|ERP]] component, N400, which gets activated when people try to integrate a new word into the preceding sentence's context.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Maxfield|first=Nathan D.|author2=Justine M. Lyon |author3=Elaine R. Silliman |title=Disfluencies along the garden path: Brain electrophysiological evidence of disrupted sentence processing|journal=Brain and Language|date=November 2009|volume=111 | issue = 2|pages=86–100|doi=10.1016/j.bandl.2009.08.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4843">'''GlobaLex''' is an online publication of the Hauser Global Law School Program at the [[New York University School of Law]] providing research tools for [[comparative law]], [[international law]], and the laws of various jurisdictions around the world. It was launched in 2005 by editor-in-chief Mirela Roznovschi, then NYU Law School's Foreign and International Law Reference Librarian, with the support of professor [[Joseph H. H. Weiler]] and dean [[Richard Revesz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?referer=https://duckduckgo.com/&amp;httpsredir=1&amp;article=1069&amp;context=ijli|first=Heidi Frostestad|last=Kuehl|title=GlobaLex: A Unique and Valuable Tool for International Law Research|journal=International Journal of Legal Information|volume=34|issue=3|date=2006|accessdate=April 24, 2018|ref=harv|page=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roznovschi conceived of the project while in [[Armenia]] as a guest instructor in [[legal research]], and in 2003 after her return to NYU, she discussed the idea with Weiler, who came up with the name.&lt;ref name="Ford"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.asil.org/sites/default/files/ILRIG_Informer_Issue_2012.pdf|first=Don|last=Ford|title=Happy Birthday GlobaLex|magazine=International Legal Research Informer|issue=Winter|year=2012|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

GlobaLex publishes articles both on topical areas, such as treaty research (particularly ''[[travaux préparatoires]]''), regional trade agreements in Africa, or the [[TRIPS Agreement]], as well as guides to the laws of specific jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuehl|2006|p=474}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007, GlobaLex had coverage of more than 80 jurisdictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.aallnet.org/mm/Publications/spectrum/archives/Vol-11/pub_sp0706/pub-sp0706-guides.pdf|first=Mimi|last=Vollstedt|title=Guides for the World: GlobaLex offers a simple, yet rich, web site of foreign, comparative, and international law guides|magazine=AALL Spectrum|date=June 2007|accessdate=April 24, 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160421173335/http://www.aallnet.org/mm/Publications/spectrum/archives/Vol-11/pub_sp0706/pub-sp0706-guides.pdf|archivedate=April 21, 2016|ref=harv|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012, that had expanded to a total of 195 research guides, including 144 guides for specific jurisdictions, 15 comparative law guides, and 32 international law guides.&lt;ref name="Ford"/&gt; As editor-in-chief, Roznovschi was responsible for finding authors who are experts in their topic areas to write guides to specific jurisdictions or topic areas, and to supervise the process of writing the article. Some authors write a guide in a foreign language and have it translated into English, with the whole process often taking as long as a year. GlobaLex pays a small honorarium to authors to offset basic expenses.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vollstedt|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2017, Lucie Olejnikova replaced Roznovschi as editor-in-chief following the retirement of the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slaw.ca/2018/01/24/new-developments-in-international-legal-information-resources/|first=Lyonette|last=Louis-Jacques|title=New Developments in International Legal Information Resources|magazine=Slaw: Canada's Online Legal Magazine|date=January 24, 2018|accessdate=April 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of GlobaLex's breadth, [[law librarian]]s frequently recommend it as a valuable resource for legal research.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kuehl|2006|p=482}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commenters in 2007 noted that the depth of coverage varied greatly by jurisdiction and that greater standardization would be helpful.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Vollstedt|2007|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2016 review evaluated GlobaLex favorably under [[information search process]] criteria, though criticized it for its lack of current awareness tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Xiaomeng Alex|last=Zhang|title=A tale of two resources: Foreign Law Guide v.

== Description ==
The tomb measures 20×20 meters. The outside walls are of mud-brick construction. The interior is divided into nine bays, each originally covered by a dome. The columns and the arches that divide the bays are decorated in deeply carved [[stucco]], depicting a wide variety of designs, stylistically comparable to [[Abbasid]] decoration in [[Mesopotamia]].&lt;ref&gt;Archaeological gazetteer of Afghanistan (Title in French: Catalogue des sites archeologiques d'Afghanistan), Warwick Ball, Volume I &amp; II, Editions Recherche sur les civilisations, Paris, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In modern times, pilgrims visit the tomb of an obscure saint, Haji Pyada, who was also buried there in the 15th century.

[[File:Car rolling in a crash (AM 81275-1).jpg|thumb|Chrysler rolling in a crash.]]
'''Hell Drivers''' -  numerous automobile thrill-based productions performing at fairs and racetracks by various squads of stunt drivers since the 1930s. Earl "Lucky" Teter was the first to coin the phrase ''Hell Drivers'', when he began touring his show in 1934. Hell Drivers provided audiences with a show filled with precision driving and deliberate crashes.  

Featured stunts included driving cars on two wheels, crashing through flaming barricades, and jumping an automobile ramp to ramp through mid air.  For many years, Hell Drivers were used to demonstrate the dependability of a manufacturer's automotive product. Major Hell Driver automotive sponsors have included [[Chevrolet]], [[Dodge]], [[Chrysler]], [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]], [[American Motors Corporation|AMC]], [[Nash Motors|Nash]], and [[Toyota]].

Later thrill shows coining the phrase "Hell Drivers" were launched by such drivers and race promoters as [[Jack Kochman]], [[John Francis "Irish" Horan]], [[Danny Fleenor]], Geoff Williams and [[Joie Chitwood]]. Chitwood bought Teter's Hell Drivers from Teter's widow after Teter was killed in a jump in 1943. Ford Motor Company supplied cars and financed Chitwood for several years until the mid 50's when Chitwood switched to Chevrolet after unsuccessfully trying Plymouth for a year. 

General Manager of Kochman's troupe was Bob Conto. Conto, a native of Malone, New York in the state's North Country was a former radio-television announcer whose staccato delivery kept pace with the 50-mile per hour events.

The Danish city of Aalborg is known internationally as the world's centre of Hell Drivers

Currently, the only traditional new-car stunt show in the United States is the Black Cat Hell Drivers, produced by Johnny Wisner.

There is a current documentary produced by filmmaker Dan T. Hall and Vizmo Films about the life and times of Lucky Teter.

'''History of Saudi Arabia &amp; Wahabism''' (2014) is an English-Language book translated by [[Anwar Haroon]]. The origin of this book is an Urdu-Language book “Tareekh Najad-o-Hijaz”&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Najad &amp; Hijaz: Saudi Arabia|author=Qadri, A.Q.|publisher=Urdu-Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J76QBQAAQBAJ|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; witten by Mufti Abdul Qayyum Qadri Hazarvi (died 2003) from Pakistan. However this English version has been published from [[United States of America]].&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of Saudi Arabia &amp; Wahabism|author=Haroon, A.|date=2014|publisher=Xlibris US|isbn=9781493181476|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RklwAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA4|page=4|accessdate=2017-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}}

==Style==
Anwar Haroon has painted the [[Wahhabism]] as Terrorism in his preface, actually he played a role of a critic of [[Saudi Arabia]] &amp; [[Wahhabism]]. He writes in preface, on Wahabis:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Now they have changed their title from Wahabis to Ahl e Hadeeth and now as Salafis, they are given generous aid from Saudi Arabia and other Middle East countries and they are misguiding the young generation of the Muslims around the world and mass killing in the name of jihad is ongoing by Al Qaida, Taliban and many others.    l got serious in finding out the cause of this bloody change and I happened to read the book “Tareekh Najad-o-Hijaz” written in Urdu language. The book also gives the details about Wahabisim, so it is named as “History of Saudi Arabia and Wahabisim. Further I have added photographs and illustrations of concerned people, historical places and mosques in this regard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Holger Pedersen 1867-1953.png|thumb|Holger Pedersen in 1937]]
'''Holger Pedersen''' ({{IPA-da|hʌlɡɐ ˈpeðˀɐsn̩|lang}}; 7 April 1867 – 25 October 1953) was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[linguistics|linguist]] who made significant contributions to language science and wrote about 30 authoritative works concerning several languages.

He was born in Gelballe, Denmark, and died in [[Hellerup]], next to [[Copenhagen]].

== Education and academic career ==

''(Principal source: Koerner 1983)''

Pedersen studied at the [[University of Copenhagen]] with [[Karl Verner]], [[Vilhelm Thomsen]], and [[Hermann Möller]]. He subsequently studied at the [[University of Leipzig]] with [[Karl Brugmann]], [[Eduard Sievers]], [[Ernst Windisch]], and [[August Leskien]].

In the fall of 1893, Pedersen enrolled at the University of Berlin, where he studied with [[Johannes Schmidt (linguist)|Johannes Schmidt]]. The following year he studied Celtic languages and Sanskrit with [[Heinrich Zimmer (Celticist)|Heinrich Zimmer]] at the [[University of Greifswald]].

In 1895 he spent several months in the [[Aran Islands]] in Ireland to study the conservative form of [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]] spoken there.

Pedersen submitted his doctoral dissertation to the University of Copenhagen in 1896. It dealt with [[aspiration (phonetics)|aspiration]] in [[Irish language|Irish]]. It was accepted and published in 1897. The dissertation committee included Vilhelm Thomsen and [[Otto Jespersen]].

Also in 1897, Pedersen took a position as a lecturer on [[Celtic languages]] at the University of Copenhagen. In 1900 he became a reader in [[historical linguistics|comparative grammar]] there. In 1902 he was offered a professorship at the [[University of Basel]], which he declined, but was able at the same time to persuade the University of Copenhagen to establish an extraordinary professorship for him (Koerner 1983:xii). Pedersen also turned down the offer in 1908 of a professorship at the [[University of Strasbourg|University of Strassburg]] (ib.). Following the retirement of Vilhelm Thomsen in 1912, Pedersen acceded to Thomsen's [[professor|chair]] at the University of Copenhagen. He remained at the University of Copenhagen for the rest of his life.

== Contributions to linguistics ==

In 1893, Pedersen traveled to [[Corfu]] with Karl Brugmann to study [[Albanian language|Albanian]] in place. Subsequently, Pedersen published a volume of Albanian texts collected on this journey (1895). The publication was due to the recommendation of Brugmann and Leskien (Koerner 1983:x). He continued to publish work on Albanian for many years thereafter. Pedersen's work on Albanian is often cited in [[Vladimir Orel]]'s ''Albanian Etymological Dictionary'' (1995).

Among students of the [[Celtic languages]] Pedersen is best known for his ''Vergleichende Grammatik der keltischen Sprachen'', 'Comparative Grammar of the Celtic Languages', which is still regarded as the principal reference work in Celtic [[historical linguistics]].

His ''Hittitisch und die anderen indoeuropäischen Sprachen'', 'Hittite and the Other Indo-European Languages', represented a significant step forward in Hittite studies, and is often relied on in Friedrich's ''Hethitisches Elementarbuch'' (2d ed. 1960), the standard handbook of [[Hittite language|Hittite]].

Also influential was his ''Tocharisch vom Gesichtspunkt der indoeuropäischen Sprachvergleichung'', 'Tocharian from the Viewpoint of Indo-European Language Comparison'. For example, [[André Martinet]] (2005:179n) states that his discussion of sound changes in [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]] is "''fondé sur la présentation du tokharien par Holger Pedersen''," 'based on the presentation of Tocharian by Holger Pedersen'.

It was Pedersen who formulated the [[Ruki sound law|ruki]] law, an important sound change in [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]].

He is also known for the description of [[Pedersen's law|Pedersen's Law]], a type of accentual shift occurring in Baltic and Slavic languages (1933a).

Pedersen endorsed the [[laryngeal theory]] (1893:292) at a time when it "was regarded as an eccentric fancy of outsiders" (Szemerényi 1996:123). In his classic exposition of the theory, [[Émile Benveniste]] (1935:148) credits Pedersen as one of those who contributed most to its development, along with [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], [[Hermann Möller]], and [[Albert Cuny]].

Two of Pedersen's theories have been receiving considerable attention in recent times after decades of neglect, often known today under the names of the [[glottalic theory]] and the [[Nostratic languages|Nostratic]] theory.

== Origin of the glottalic theory ==

In a work published in 1951, Pedersen pointed out that the frequency of ''b'' in [[Proto-Indo-European language|Indo-European]] is abnormally low. Comparison of languages, however, shows that it would be normal if it had once been the equivalent voiceless [[stop consonant|stop]] ''p'', which is infrequent or absent in many languages.

He also posited that the Indo-European voiced aspirates, ''bh dh gh'', could be better understood as voiceless aspirates, ''ph th kh''.

Pedersen therefore proposed that the three stop series of Indo-European, ''p t k'', ''bh dh gh'', and ''b d g'', had at an earlier time been ''b d g'', ''ph th kh'', and ''(p) t k'', with the voiceless and voiced non-aspirates reversed.

This theory attracted relatively little attention until the American linguist [[Paul Hopper]] (1973) and the two Soviet scholars [[Tamaz V. Gamkrelidze]] and [[Vyacheslav Ivanov (philologist)|Vyacheslav V. Ivanov]] proposed, in a series of articles culminating in a major work by Gamkrelidze and Ivanov published in 1984 (English translation 1995), that the Indo-European ''b d g'' series had originally been a [[ejective consonant|glottalized]] series, ''p' t' k'.'' Under this form, the theory has attracted wide interest. There seems to be a good chance that it will endure in one form or another.

== Origin of the Nostratic theory ==

Pedersen seems to have first used the term "Nostratic" in an article on Turkish phonology published in 1903. The kernel of Pedersen's argument for Nostratic in that article was as follows (1903:560-561; "Indo-Germanic" = Indo-European):

::Grønbech considers it possible p. 69 that the Turkish word for "goose" could be borrowed from Indo-Germanic (Osm. ''kaz'' Yak. ''xās'' Chuv. ''xur''). There are in my view three possibilities with regard to this word: coincidence, borrowing, and kinship. One must also reckon with this last possibility. Very many language stocks in Asia are without doubt related to the Indo-Germanic one; this is perhaps valid for all those languages which have been characterized as Ural–Altaic. I would like to unite all the language stocks related to Indo-Germanic under the name "Nostratic languages." The Nostratic languages occupy not only a very large area in Europe and Asia but also extend to within Africa; for the Semitic-Hamitic languages are in my view without doubt Nostratic. With regard to the proof of the relationship of the Nostratic languages, not only must all root etymologies and in general all etymological frivolities be kept at a distance, but one should in general not concern oneself with heaping up a mass of material. One should rather limit oneself to the rational consideration of a series of pronouns, negatives, in part also numerals which can be traced through several language stocks (in Turkish one is reminded of the Indo-Germanic by the negation ''-ma'', ''-mä'' and the word-initial interrogative particle ''m'', the interrogative pronoun ''kim'', the pronoun of the first person ''män'', the verbal ending of the 1. sing. ''-m'', 1. plur. ''-myz'', ''-miz'' and the ending ''-jin'' in the 1. sing. of the "optative," very reminiscent of the Indo-Germanic subjunctive [with the optative affix ''-a-'', ''-ä-''], the pronoun of the 2. sing. ''sän'' [cp. the IdG. verbal ending ''-s''], the causative formation with ''-tur-'' [cp. IdG. ''-tōr'' nomen agentis; the Indo-Germanic causative also appears as if it were derived from a nomina agentis of the φορός type], the nomina actionis like Orkh. ''käd-im'' "clothing," several numerals: Orkh. ''jiti'' "7," ''jitm-iš'' "70," [with ''j'' = IdG. ''s'' as in Proto-Turk. *''jib-'' "approach," Osm. ''jyldyz'' "Star": to Indo-Germanic word for "sun," ''jat-'' "lie": IdG. word for "sit"]; Proto-Turk. ''bǟš'' "5" [with ''š'' = IdG. ''-q&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;e''; cp. Osm. ''piš-'' "be cooked," IdG. *''peq&lt;sup&gt;u&lt;/sup&gt;eti'' "cooks"] etc., etc.). I resist the temptation to enter into this question in more detail.

Pedersen’s last sentence should be understood as referring to the article he was writing, not the rest of his career. Although he defined the Nostratic family, he himself never produced the work of synthesis the concept seemed to call for. That would await the work of the Russian scholars [[Vladislav Illich-Svitych|Illich-Svitych]] and [[Aharon Dolgopolsky|Dolgopolsky]] in the 1960s for its first iteration. Nevertheless, Pedersen did not abandon the subject. He produced a substantial (if overlooked) article on Indo-European and Semitic in 1908. He produced a detailed argument in favor of the kinship of Indo-European and Uralic in 1933. In effect, the three pillars of the Nostratic hypothesis are [[Indo-Uralic languages|Indo-Uralic]], [[Ural–Altaic languages|Ural–Altaic]], and [[Hermann Möller|Indo-Semitic]]. Pedersen produced works on two of these three, so the impression is incorrect that he neglected this subject in his subsequent career. His interest in the Nostratic idea remained constant amid his many other activities as a linguist.

English "Nostratic" is the normal equivalent of German ''nostratisch'', the form used by Pedersen in 1903, and Danish ''nostratisk'' (compare French ''nostratique''). His 1931 American translator rendered ''nostratisk'' by "Nostratian," but this form did not catch on.

In his 1931 book, Pedersen defined Nostratic as follows (1931:338):

::As a comprehensive designation for the families of languages which are related to Indo-European, we may employ the expression ''Nostratian languages'' (from Latin ''nostrās'' "our countryman").

In his view, [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] was most clearly related to [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], with "similar, though fainter, resemblances" to [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]], and [[Manchu language|Manchu]]; to [[Yukaghir languages|Yukaghir]]; and to [[Eskimo–Aleut languages|Eskimo]] (1931:338). He also considered Indo-European might be related to [[Semitic languages|Semitic]] and that, if so, it must be related to [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Hamitic]] and possibly to [[Basque language|Basque]] (ib.).

In modern terms, we would say he was positing [[genetic relationship (linguistics)|genetic relationship]] between Indo-European and the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]], [[Altaic languages|Altaic]], Yukaghir, Eskimo, and [[Afro-Asiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] language families. (The existence of the Altaic family is controversial, and few would now assign Basque to Afro-Asiatic.)

However, in Pedersen's view the languages listed did not exhaust the possibilities for Nostratic (ib.):

::The boundaries for the Nostratian world of languages cannot yet be determined, but the area is enormous, and includes such widely divergent races that one becomes almost dizzy at the thought. (...) The question remains simply whether sufficient material can be collected to give this inclusion flesh and blood and a good clear outline.

The development of '''Indian logic''' dates back to the ''[[anviksiki]]'' of Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE) the [[Vyakarana|Sanskrit grammar]] rules of [[Pāṇini]] (c. 5th century BCE); the [[Vaisheshika]] school's analysis of [[atomism]] (c. 6th century BCE to 2nd century BCE); the analysis of [[inference]] by [[Nyāya Sūtras|Gotama]] (c. 6th century BC to 2nd century CE), founder of the [[Nyaya]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]]; and the [[tetralemma]] of [[Nagarjuna]] (c. 2nd century CE). [[Indian philosophy|Indian]] logic stands as one of the three original traditions of [[logic]], alongside the [[Organon|Greek]] and the [[Chinese logic]]. The Indian tradition continued to develop through to early modern times, in the form of the [[Navya-Nyāya]] school of logic.

The [[Nasadiya Sukta]] of the ''[[Rigveda]]'' ([[Mandala 10|RV 10]].129) contains [[ontological]] speculation in terms of various logical divisions that were later recast formally as the four circles of ''[[Tetralemma|catuskoti]]'': "A", "not A", "A and 'not A'", and "not A and not not A".&lt;ref&gt;[[Subhash Kak|S. Kak]] (2004). ''The Architecture of Knowledge''. CSC, Delhi.&lt;/ref&gt;

Medhatithi Gautama (c. 6th century BCE) founded the ''anviksiki'' school of logic.&lt;ref&gt;S. C. Vidyabhusana (1971). ''A History of Indian Logic: Ancient, Mediaeval, and Modern Schools''.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Mahabharata]]'' (12.173.45), around the 4th century BCE to 4th century CE, refers to the ''anviksiki'' and ''tarka'' schools of logic. {{IAST|[[Pāṇini]]}} (c. 5th century BCE) developed a form of logic (to which [[Boolean logic]] has some similarities) for his formulation of [[Vyakarana|Sanskrit grammar]]. Logic is described by [[Chanakya]] (c. 350-283 BCE) in his ''[[Arthashastra]]'' as an independent field of inquiry ''anviksiki''.&lt;ref&gt;R. P. Kangle (1986). ''The Kautiliya Arthashastra'' (1.2.11). Motilal Banarsidass.&lt;/ref&gt;

==The schools==
===Vaisheshika===
{{Main|Vaisheshika}}
Vaisheshika, also Vaisesika, (Sanskrit: वैशेषिक) is one of the six [[Hindu philosophy|Hindu schools]] of [[Indian philosophy]]. It came to be closely associated with the Hindu school of logic, Nyaya. Vaisheshika espouses a form of atomism and postulates that all objects in the physical universe are reducible to a finite number of atoms. Originally proposed by [[Kanada (philosopher)|Kanāda]] (or Kana-bhuk, literally, atom-eater) from around the 2nd century BCE.

===Catuskoti===
{{Main|Catuskoti}}
In the 2nd century, the [[Buddhist philosophy|Buddhist]] philosopher [[Nagarjuna]] refined the ''Catuskoti'' form of logic. The Catuskoti is also often glossed ''[[Tetralemma]]'' (Greek)  which is the name for a largely comparable, but not equatable, 'four corner argument' within the tradition of [[Classical logic]].

===Nyaya===
{{Main|Nyaya}}
''Nyāya'' (''ni-āyá'', literally "recursion", used in the sense of "[[syllogism]], inference") is the name given to one of the six orthodox or ''[[astika]]'' schools of Hindu philosophy — specifically the school of logic.

The Nyaya school of philosophical speculation is based on texts known as the ''[[Nyaya Sutras]]'', which were written by [[Akṣapāda Gotama|Gotama]] in around the 2nd century CE. The most important contribution made by the Nyaya school to modern Hindu thought is its methodology. This methodology is based on a [[system of logic]] that has subsequently been adopted by most of the other Indian schools (orthodox or not), much in the same way that [[Western philosophy]] can be said to be largely based on [[Aristotelian logic]].

Followers of Nyaya believed that obtaining valid knowledge was the only way to obtain release from suffering. They therefore took great pains to identify valid sources of knowledge and to distinguish these from mere false opinions. According to the Nyaya school, there are exactly four sources of knowledge (pramanas): perception, inference, comparison and testimony. Knowledge obtained through each of these can, of course, still be either valid or invalid. As a result, Nyaya scholars again went to great pains to identify, in each case, what it took to make knowledge valid, in the process creating a number of explanatory schemes. In this sense, Nyaya is probably the closest Indian equivalent to contemporary analytic philosophy.

===Jain logic===
{{Further|Anekantavada|Syadvada|Jain philosophy}}
[[Jainism]] made its own unique contribution to this mainstream development of logic by also occupying itself with the basic epistemological issues, namely, with those concerning the nature of knowledge, how knowledge is derived, and in what way knowledge can be said to be reliable.  Jain logic developed and flourished from 6th century BCE to 17th century CE. According to Jains, the ultimate principle should always be logical and no principle can be devoid of logic or reason. Thus one finds in the [[:Category:Jain texts|Jain texts]], deliberative exhortations on any subject in all its facts, may they be constructive or obstructive, inferential or analytical, enlightening or destructive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last =Hughes | first =Marilynn | title =The voice of Prophets | publisher =Lulu.com | year =2005 | location =Morrisville, North Carolina | series =Volume 2 of 12 | isbn =1-4116-5121-9 }} P. 590&lt;/ref&gt; In the process, the Jains came out with their doctrines of [[Relativism|relativity]] used for logic and reasoning:
*[[Anekantavada|Anekāntavāda]]&amp;nbsp;– the theory of relative pluralism or manifoldness;
*[[Syadvada|Syādvāda]]&amp;nbsp;– the theory of conditioned predication and;
*[[Nayavada|Nayavāda]]&amp;nbsp;– The theory of partial standpoints.

These [[Jain philosophy|Jain philosophical]] concepts made most important contributions to the ancient [[Indian philosophy]], especially in the areas of skepticism and relativity.&lt;ref&gt;*{{cite book | last =McEvilley | first =Thomas | title =The Shape of Ancient Thought: Comparative Studies in Greek and Indian Philosophies | publisher =Allworth Communications , Inc. | year =2002 | location =New York | isbn =1-58115-203-5 }} p335"&lt;/ref&gt;

Following is the list of Jain philosophers who contributed to Jain Logic:
*[[Kundakunda]] (2nd century CE), exponent of Jain mysticism and [[Anekantavada#Nayav.C4.81da|Jain nayas]] dealing with the nature of the soul and its contamination by matter, author of [[Pancastikayasara|Pañcāstikāyasāra]] (Essence of the Five Existents), the [[Pravacanasara|Pravacanasāra]] (Essence of the Scripture) and the [[Samayasara|Samayasāra]] (Essence of the Doctrine).
*[[Umasvati|Umāsvāti]] or Umasvami (2nd century CE), author of first Jain work in Sanskrit, [[Tattvartha Sutra|Tattvārthasūtra]], expounding the [[Jain philosophy]] in a most systematized form acceptable to all sects of Jainism.
*[[Siddhasen Diwakar|Siddhasena Divākara]] (5th century CE), Jain logician and author of important works in Sanskrit and Prakrit, such as, Nyāyāvatāra (on Logic) and Sanmatisūtra (dealing with the seven Jaina standpoints, knowledge and the objects of knowledge)
*[[Haribhadra]] (8th century CE), a Jaina thinker, author and great proponent of [[Anekantavada|anekāntavāda]] and classical yoga, as a soteriological system of meditation in Jaina context. His works include {{IAST|Ṣaḍdarśanasamuccaya}} and Yogabindu.
*[[Hemacandra]] (1089–1172 CE) - a Jaina thinker, author, historian, grammarian and logician. His works include [[Yogaśāstra]] and Trishashthishalakapurushacharitra.
*[[Yasovijaya|Yaśovijaya Gaṇi]] (1624–88 CE)&amp;nbsp;– Jain logician and considered as intellectual giant to contribute to Jaina philosophy.
*[[Acharya Mahapragya]] (1920–2010 CE);– Jain logician and considered as intellectual giant and encyclopedia to contribute to Jaina philosophy.The Eminent Scholar of Philosophy, Dr. Daya Krishna has recognized Acharya Shri Mahapragya as the most knowledgeable person on the subject of Jain Logic.His Book "New Dimensions in Jaina Logic" is the one of the best work on the subject in modern era.Acharya Mahapragya is known for his enlightening discourses. In 1975, he was specially invited to deliver a series of nine lectures on Jain Logic at the University of Rajasthan at Jaipur. The University published these lectures in the form of a book entitled ‘Jain Nyay Ka Vikas’. His books on the subjects mainly include ‘Jain Darshan-Mannan aur Mimansa’, ‘Jain Dharma Aur Sanskriti’, ‘Jain Darshan and Anekantvad’, ‘Jain Dharma aur Darshan’, and many more. His books have a unique combination of simplicity in expression and originality.

===Buddhist logic===
{{Main|Buddhist logic}}
Indian Buddhist logic (called [[Pramana]]) flourished from about 500 CE up to 1300 CE.  The three main authors of Buddhist logic are [[Vasubandhu]] (400–800 CE), [[Dignāga]] (480–540 CE), and [[Dharmakīrti]] (600–660 CE). The most important theoretical achievements are the doctrine of [[Trairūpya]] (Skrt. त्रैरूप्य) and the highly formal scheme of the [[Hetucakra]] (Skrt. हेतुचक्र) ("Wheel of Reasons") given by [[Dignāga]]. There is a still living tradition of Buddhist logic in the Tibetan Buddhist traditions, where logic is an important part of the education of monks.

===Navya-Nyaya===
{{Main|Navya-Nyāya}}
The Navya-Nyāya or Neo-Logical darśana (school) of Indian philosophy was founded in the 13th century CE by the philosopher [[Gangesha Upadhyaya]] of [[Mithila (India)|Mithila]]. It was a development of the classical Nyāya darśana. Other influences on Navya-Nyāya were the work of earlier philosophers [[Vācaspati Miśra]] (900–980 CE) and [[Udayana]] (late 10th century).

Gangeśa's book [[Tattvacintāmaṇi]] ("Thought-Jewel of Reality") was written partly in response to Śrīharśa's Khandanakhandakhādya, a defence of Advaita Vedānta, which had offered a set of thorough criticisms of Nyāya theories of thought and language. In his book, Gangeśa both addressed some of those criticisms and – more importantly – critically examined the Nyāya darśana himself. He held that, while Śrīharśa had failed successfully to challenge the Nyāya realist ontology, his and Gangeśa's own criticisms brought out a need to improve and refine the logical and linguistic tools of Nyāya thought, to make them more rigorous and precise.

Tattvacintāmani dealt with all the important aspects of Indian philosophy, logic, [[set theory]], and especially [[epistemology]], which Gangeśa examined rigorously, developing and improving the Nyāya scheme, and offering examples. The results, especially his analysis of cognition, were taken up and used by other darśanas.

Navya-Nyāya developed a sophisticated language and conceptual scheme that allowed it to raise, analyse, and solve problems in logic and epistemology. It systematised all the Nyāya concepts into four main categories: sense or perception (pratyakşa), inference (anumāna), comparison or similarity ([[upamāna]]), and testimony (sound or word; śabda).

This later school began around [[East India|eastern India]] and [[Bengal]], and developed theories resembling modern logic, such as [[Gottlob Frege]]'s "distinction between sense and reference of proper names" and his "definition of number," as well as the Navya-Nyaya theory of "restrictive conditions for universals" anticipating some of the developments in modern [[set theory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Some Comparisons Between Frege's Logic and Navya-Nyaya Logic|author=Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=36|issue=4|date=June 1976|pages=554–563|publisher=International Phenomenological Society|jstor=2106873|quote=This paper consists of three parts. The first part deals with Frege's distinction between sense and reference of proper names and a similar distinction in Navya-Nyaya logic. In the second part we have compared Frege's definition of number to the Navya-Nyaya definition of number. In the third part we have shown how the study of the so-called 'restrictive conditions for universals' in Navya-Nyaya logic anticipated some of the developments of modern set theory.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Udayana in particular developed theories on "restrictive conditions for universals" and "[[Infinity|infinite]] regress" that anticipated aspects of modern set theory. According to Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Some Comparisons Between Frege's Logic and Navya-Nyaya Logic|author=Kisor Kumar Chakrabarti|journal=Philosophy and Phenomenological Research|volume=36|issue=4|date=June 1976|pages=554–563|publisher=International Phenomenological Society|jstor=2106873}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|In the third part we have shown how the study of the so-called 'restrictive conditions for universals' in Navya-Nyaya logic anticipated some of the developments of modern set theory. [...] In this section the discussion will center around some of the 'restrictive conditions for universals (''jatibadhaka'') proposed by Udayana. [...] Another restrictive condition is ''[[anavastha]]'' or vicious infinite regress. According to this restrictive condition, no universal (''jati'') can be admitted to exist, the admission of which would lead to a vicious infinite regress. As an example Udayana says that there can be no universal of which every universal is a member; for if we had any such universal, then, by hypothesis, we have got a given totality of all universals that exist and all of them belong to this big universal. But this universal is itself a universal and hence (since it cannot be a member of itself, because in Udayana's view no universal can be a member of itself) this universal too along with other universals must belong to a bigger universal and so on ad infinitum. What Udayana says here has interesting analogues in modern set theory in which it is held that a set of all sets (i.e., a set to which every set belongs) does not exist.}}

==Influence of Indian logic on modern logic==
In the late 18th-century British scholars began to take an interest in Indian philosophy and discovered the sophistication of the Indian study of inference. This process culminated in [[Henry Thomas Colebrooke|Henry T. Colebrooke's]] ''The Philosophy of the Hindus: On the Nyaya and Vaisesika Systems'' in 1824,&lt;ref&gt;Colebrooke, Henry Thomas "Essays on the Religion and Philosophy of the Hindus" London: Williams and Norgate, 1858 available online at https://archive.org/details/essaysonreligio00colegoog&lt;/ref&gt; which provided an analysis of inference and comparison to the received [[Aristotelian logic]], resulting in the observation that the Aristotelian [[syllogism]] could not account for the Indian syllogism. [[Max Mueller]] contributed an appendix to the 1853 edition of [[William Thomson (bishop) | Thomson]]'s ''Outline of the Laws of Thought'', in which he placed Greek and Indian logic on the same plane: "The sciences of Logic and Grammar were, as far as history allows us to judge, invented or originally conceived by two nations only, by Hindus and Greeks."&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, Max "Of Indian Logic" Appendix To Thomson's Laws of Thought, London: Longmans Green and Co 1853 online at https://archive.org/details/anoutlinenecess03thomgoog&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonardon Ganeri has observed that this period{{which?|date=August 2016}} saw [[George Boole]] (1815-1864) and [[Augustus De Morgan]] (1806-1871) make their pioneering applications of algebraic ideas to the formulation of logic (such as [[algebraic logic]] and [[Boolean logic]]), and has suggested that these figures were likely to be aware of these studies in xeno-logic, and further that their acquired awareness of the shortcomings of propositional logic are likely to have stimulated their willingness to look outside the system.

Indian logic attracted the attention of many Western scholars, and had an influence on pioneering 19th-century logicians such as [[Charles Babbage]] (1791-1871), [[Augustus De Morgan]], and particularly [[George Boole]], as confirmed by Boole's wife [[Mary Everest Boole]] in an "open letter to Dr Bose" titled "Indian Thought and Western Science in the Nineteenth Century" written in 1901:&lt;ref&gt;Boole, Mary Everest "Collected Works" eds E M Cobham and E S Dummer London, Daniel 1931. Letter also published in the Ceylon National Review in 1909, and published as a separate pamphlet "The Psychologic Aspect of Imperialism" in 1911.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Indian logic: a reader|author= Jonardon Ganeri|publisher= [[Routledge]] | location = Richmond, Surrey | orig-year= 2001 | year = 2013|isbn= 9781136119385 |page= vii | editor1-last = Ganeri | editor1-first = Jonardon | quote = The modern study of classical Indian systems of logic began with H. T. Colebrook's "discovery" of the Hindu syllogism - a schema for correct reasoning as described in the early Indian texts. The report of his discovery to the Royal Asiatic Society in 1824 led to a flurry of interest in Indian logic in the next thirty years, attracting the attention of even the best logicians of the time, people like Boole and De Morgan.
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Morgan himself wrote in 1860 of the significance of Indian logic: "The two races which have founded the mathematics, those of the Sanscrit and Greek languages, have been the two which have independently formed systems of logic."&lt;ref&gt;
De Morgan, Augustus "Syllabus of a proposed system of logic", London : Walton and Maberly 1860; online at https://archive.org/details/syllabusofpropos00demoiala
&lt;/ref&gt;

Mathematicians became aware of the influence of Indian mathematics on the European.  For example, [[Hermann Weyl]] wrote: "Occidental mathematics has in past centuries broken away from the Greek view and followed a course which seems to have originated in India and which has been transmitted, with additions, to us by the Arabs; in it the concept of number appears as logically prior to the concepts of geometry. [...] But the present trend in mathematics is clearly in the direction of a return to the Greek standpoint; we now look upon each branch of mathematics as determining its own characteristic domain of quantities."&lt;ref&gt;Weyl, Hermann "The Theory of Groups and Quantum Mechanics", 1950, p.viii; online at https://books.google.co.za/books?id=jQbEcDDqGb8C&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jarmo'''  Ancient Assyria (Qal'at Jarmo) is a prehistoric [[archeological site]] located in [[Iraq]] on the foothills of the [[Zagros Mountains]]. It lies at an altitude of 800&amp;nbsp;m above sea-level in a belt of [[oak]] and [[pistachio]] woodlands. Excavations revealed that Jarmo was an [[agriculture|agricultural]] community dating back to 7090 BC. It was broadly contemporary with such other important [[Neolithic]] sites such as [[Jericho]] in the southern [[Levant]] and [[Çatal Hüyük]] in [[Anatolia]].

== Discovery and excavation ==
The site was originally discovered by the Iraqi Directorate of Antiquities in 1940, and later became known to archaeologist [[Robert Braidwood]] from the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]]. At the time, he was looking for suitable places to research the origins of the [[Neolithic Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oi.uchicago.edu/pdf/oip105.pdf] L. S. Braidwood et al., Prehistoric Archeology Along the Zagros Flanks, Oriental Institute Publications 105, 1983, {{ISBN|0-918986-36-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Robert J. Braidwood, The Iraq-Jarmo Project of the Oriental Institute of the University of Chicago, Season 1954-1955, Verlag nicht ermittelbar, 1954&lt;/ref&gt;Braidwood worked as part of the Iraq-Jarmo programme for three seasons, those of 1948, 1950–51 and 1954–55; a fourth campaign, to be carried out in 1958-59 did not come about because of the [[14 July Revolution]]. During the excavations in Jarmo in 1954-55, Braidwood used a multidisciplinary approach for the first time, in an attempt to refine the research methods and clarify the origin of the domestication of plants and animals. Among his team were a geologist, Herbert Wright, a palaeo-botanist, [[Hans Helbaek]], an expert in pottery and radio-carbon dating, Frederic Mason, and a zoologist, Charles Reed, as well as a number of archaeologists. The interdisciplinary method was subsequently used in all serious field work in archaeology.

== Jarmo, the village ==
[[File:Jarmo personal adornments, 1 carnelian beads, 2 turquoise bead, 3 clay beads, 4 stone bracelets, 5 pendants of clay, stone, and shell - Oriental Institute Museum, University of Chicago - DSC06938.JPG|thumb|Personal adornments from Jarmo - [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute]]]]

The excavations exposed a small village, covering an area of 12,000 to 16,000 m², and which has been dated (by carbon-14) to 7090 BC, for the oldest levels, to 4950 BC for the most recent. The entire site consists of twelve levels. Jarmo appears to be two older, permanent Neolithic settlements and, approximately, contemporary with [[Jericho]] or the Neolithic stage of [[Shanidar]]. The high point is likely to have been between 6,200 and 5,800 BC. This small village consisted of some twenty five houses, with adobe walls and sun-dried mud roofs, which rested on stone foundations, with a simple floor plan dug from the earth. These dwellings were frequently repaired or rebuilt. In all, about 150 people lived in the village, which was clearly a permanent settlement. In the earlier phases there is a preponderance of objects made from stone, [[silex]]- using older styles- and [[obsidian]]. The use of this latter material, obtained from the area of [[Lake Van]], 200 miles away, suggests that some form of organized trade already existed, as does the presence of ornamental shells from the [[Persian Gulf]]. In the oldest level baskets have been found, waterproofed with pitch, which is readily available in the area.

== Agriculture and cattle farming ==
Agricultural activity is attested by the presence of stone sickles, cutters, bowls and other objects, for harvesting, preparing and storing food, and also by receptacles of engraved marble. In the later phases instruments made of bone, particularly perforating tools, buttons and spoons, have been found. Further research has shown that the villagers of Jarmo grew wheat of two types, emmer and einkorn, a type of primitive barley and lentils (it is common to record the domestication of grains, less so of pulses). Their diet, and that of their animals, also included species of wild plant, peas, acorns, carob seeds, pistachios and wild wheat. Snail shells are also abundant. There is evidence that they had domesticated goats, sheep and dogs. On the higher levels of the site pigs have been found, together with the first evidence of pottery.

== Pottery and religion ==
Jarmo is one of the oldest sites at which [[pottery]] has been found, appearing in the most recent levels of excavation, which dates it to the 7th millennium BC. This pottery is handmade, of simple design and with thick sides, and treated with a vegetable solvent. There are clay figures, zoomorphic or anthropomorphic, including figures of pregnant women which are taken to be fertility goddesses, similar to the [[Mother Goddess]] of later Neolithic cultures in the same region.

'''Jean de Menasce''' (1902&amp;ndash;1973) was a [[French Catholicism|French Catholic]] priest, of the [[Dominican Order]], as well as an author and academic. He came from Jewish Egyptian and French parentage. Over his lifetime he mastered fifteen languages, including [[Hebrew]], [[Syriac language|Syriac]], and [[Middle Persian|Pahlavi]]. He was in the Catholic contingent among Jewish and Protestant leaders at an important post-war [[Seelisberg Conference|interfaith conference]]. Menasce wrote as a [[Theology|theologian]], and as a scholar of [[Middle Eastern studies]], especially regarding [[Judaism]], and the [[Zoroastrian]] religion.&lt;ref&gt;See text below for source referrals.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Jean de Menasce was born in [[Alexandria]] on 24 December 1902 into a well-established family in the [[Jews of Egypt|Jewish community of Egypt]]. His father, ''Baron'' Félix de Menasce, a banker with Austro-Hungarian links, was in fact the head of the Jewish community in Alexandria; he had been raised to the peerage by the Emperor of Austria. Jean's mother was French from a Spanish line.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce".&lt;/ref&gt; A cousin of Jean de Menasce was the writer and diplomat [[Georges Cattaui]], six years his senior.&lt;ref&gt;Ph. Gignoux et A. Tafazzoli, "J. P. de Menasce 1902-1973 Biographie", pp.vii-viii (Jewish family of Egypt, mother); p. vii, n.2 (G. Cattaui).&lt;/ref&gt; A second cousin was the composer and pianist [[Jacques de Menasce]].

After the local lycée français, Jean de Menasce remained in Cairo studying at its French School of Law. Thereafter he continued his education in Europe, at [[Oxford University]] and at the [[Sorbonne]]. During the course of his student years, de Menasce had left behind his religious beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce" (Cairo background; loss of beliefs).&lt;/ref&gt; 

At Oxford's [[Balliol College]], he was a classmate of the future novelist [[Graham Greene]], who also would convert to Catholicism in 1926. Menasce translated into French works of the English poet [[T. S. Eliot]], a friend. ln 1922 he made the French translation of a book by the philosopher [[Bertrand Russel]], whom he knew as a fellow member of [[Lady Ottoline Morrell]]'s salon at Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;Anaël Levy, "Jean de Menasce: juif, sioniste, prétre" at p.4 (Oxford literary personalities).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce" (schools; Eliot, Russell). Hastings mentions that Russell would publish his ''Why I am not a Christian'' in 1927, and then speculates: "Was he perhaps driven to write it by news of the Christian conversion of his brilliant young Jewish philosopher friend?"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Philippe Gignoux, "Menasce" (2014). He translated Eliot's "The Waste Land".&lt;/ref&gt; From the poetry of [[John Donne]], the 17th-century [[Anglican Church|Anglican]] priest, he had also made French versions.&lt;ref&gt;''La Nouvelle Revue Française'', 10e année No. 115 N. S., 1er Avril 1923.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus he already enjoyed some recognition when in 1926 he became a convert to [[Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux et Tafazzoli, "J. P. de Menasce 1902-1973 Biographie", pp. vii-viii (schools, Donne, Scheler).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion==
In the meantime, de Menasce had continued to study law and philosophy at the Sorbonne in Paris. Then, while pursuing his nurtured interest in Zionism, [[Haim Weizman]], a secular family friend and future President of Israel, appointed him secretary of the Zionist Bureau in Geneva. He then traveled to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Avon, ''Les Frères prêcheurs en Orient : Les dominicains du Caire'', p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Returning to Paris, de Menasce entered a period of personal spiritual crisis, and painful growth. He began his lifelong friendship with the Catholic philosopher [[Jacques Maritain]] and his Jewish wife Raissa, both converts from [[agnosticism]] twenty years earlier. Another decisive new friend was [[Louis Massignon]], a scholar whose 4-volume study of the Islamic mystic [[Al-Hallaj]] had just been published.&lt;ref&gt;Massignon, ''La Passion de Hallaj. Martyr mystique de l'Islam'', 1922.&lt;/ref&gt; Massignon, also a convert, had met de Menasce at the ''La Revue juive'' [The Jewish Review].&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce" (Weizman; Maritain, Massignon).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avon, ''Les Frères prêcheurs en Orient : Les dominicains du Caire'' (''La Revue juive'' and Massignon).&lt;/ref&gt;

In this learned milieu, in an atmosphere of intense spiritual awareness, de Menasce converted.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, "Jean de Menasce: juif, sioniste, prétre" at 3, 5 (de Menasce's academic friends are described as "philsémite chrétiens").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce". Hastings states, "This new circle of friends provided the human context within which de Menasce discovered God and Christ... ."&lt;/ref&gt; During his inquiring approach to Christianity with Massignon he had discussed the mystics [[Theresa of Avila]] and [[Francis of Assisi]]. He had also followed the modern naisance of Jewish-Christian dialogue.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, "Jean de Menasce: juif, sioniste, prétre" at pp. 3, 4-5, 6-9 (Jewish-Christian dialogue [de Menasce combatted antisemitism]).&lt;/ref&gt; After his [[baptism]] he spent the first months writing his book on [[Hasidic Judaism|Hassidism]], ''Quand Israel aime Dieu''.&lt;ref&gt;This work by de Menasce was not published until 1931 (see Bibliography). Perhaps an English title: When Israel befriended God.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Adrian Hastings]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The book was "an exceptionally beautiful study of Jewish Hasidic holiness. It was, in a way, his farewell tribute to the religion of his ancestors, but one feels that he was able to make it only after he had rediscovered the God of Israel through the discovery of Jesus as Messiah."&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce" (quote).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He then spent two years in Cairo at his father's request. In 1930 he entered the [[Dominican Order]]. His formation for the priesthood was conducted in Belgium at [[:fr:Le Saulchoir]] de Kain, and he was ordained in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux et Tafazzoli, "J. P. de Menasce 1902-1973 Biographie", p. viii (his baptism), and note 6 (his "très belle" book on the Hassidim, ''Quand Israël aime Dieu'').&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Avon, ''Les Frères prêcheurs en Orient : Les dominicains du Caire'' (baptism and Massignon).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce" (baptism; book; Cairo; ordination).&lt;/ref&gt;

==As scholar-priest==

===Roles in the Church===
Following an earlier suggestion of Massignon, Fr. Jean de Menasce pursued studies in the [[Syriac language]]. It led him into the academic world of religious studies, eventually becoming a professor.&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux, "Menasce" (2014). He studied Syriac at the Catholic Institute of Paris.&lt;/ref&gt; "The relationship of Christianity to Judaism and Islam, and to all the great world religions was central to his [[missiology]]." Hence his scholarly affinity to the [[Islamic studies by author (non-Muslim or academic)|Islamists]] Massignon, Abd-el Jalil, and [[Louis Gardet]], as well as [[Hendrik Kraemer]]. In this context de Menasce approached the theme of [[Catholic missions]] after [[World War II|the second world war]]. "The relationship of Christianity to Judaism and Islam, and to all the great world religions was central to his [[missiology]]."&lt;ref&gt;Marc R. Spindler, "Menasce, Pierre Jean de 1902-1973 Catholic (Dominican) Egypt" (missiology quote; Islamists).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cf., Levy, "Jean de Menasce: juif, sioniste, prétre" at p. 7 (de Menasce delicately deferred opposition to the conversion of Jews).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The priest and professor exerted an important influence within the wide horizons of French Catholic intellectual life. De Menasce was a close friend of the art critic [[:fr:Stanislas Fumet]], of the essayist [[Charles Du Bos]], and of the ill-fated writer [[Maurice Sachs]], in addition to the above philosopher Jacques Maritain. Menasce also participated in the [[Neo-Thomism|neo-Thomist]] revival within his Church, following Cardinal [[Charles Journet]] and Professor Maritain among others.&lt;ref&gt;GoldenMap.com, "Jean de Menasce".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spindler, "Menasce, Pierre Jean de 1902-1973 Catholic (Dominican) Egypt".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;20th-century [[Francophone]] philosophers [[Étienne Gilson]] and [[Joseph Maréchal]] also influenced Neo-Thomism. In light of [[Vatican II]], and especially [[Nouvelle Théologie]], the movement's context was largely redefined. Cf., William F. Murphy, [http://www.pcj.edu/journal/essays/18_2_Murphy.PDF "Thomism and Nouvelle Théologie: A dialogue renewed?"] in ''Josephinum Journal of Theology,'' v. 18/1: pp. 1-36 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jewish-Christian relations===
De Menasce was continuously involved in fostering  [[Jewish-Christian relations]]. He played a major role in its evolution during the painful yet persistently hopeful post-war years.&lt;ref&gt;Levy, "Jean de Menasce: juif, sioniste, prétre" at 3, 8-9. He regarded his conversion as an opportunity to foster a Jewish-Christian presence in the new state of Israel.&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, de Menasce lectured on contemporary Jewish thought, e.g., that of philosopher [[Emmanuel Levinas]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, "Jean de Menasce: juif, sioniste, prétre" at pp. 7-9 (Seelisberg), p. 6 (Lévinas). Evidently during the war Jews were safe in "Fribourg des réfugiés" (p.7).&lt;/ref&gt;

He was one of nine Catholic participants among the seventy Jewish and Christian leaders at the [[Seelisberg Conference]] on the [[Shoah]] in 1947. This international religious gathering in Switzerland addressed the world of pain and grief left by the searing ideological conflict. Sponsored by the [[International Council of Christians and Jews]] (ICCJ), it faced [[antisemitism]], seeking to heal wounds and to bridge divides, recent and ancient.&lt;ref&gt;Cf., {{cite web|url=http://www.jcrelations.net/An_Address_to_the_Churches__Seelisberg__Switzerland__1947.2370.0.html?id=720&amp;L=3&amp;searchText=An+Address+to+the+Churches&amp;searchFilter=%2A|title=International Conference of Christians and Jews. Seelisberg, Switzerland, 1947. An Address to the Churches|accessdate=14 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Zoroastrian studies===
In [[Iranology|Iranian studies]] de Menasce excelled. He became a recognized expert, a leader in the field. In the late 1930s he had studied with [[Émile Benveniste]] in Fribourg. During the war he prepared his translation of the [[Shikand-gumanic Vichar|Škand-Gumānīk Vičār]] by Mardan-Farrukk, a ninth century [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]]. The book included transcriptions of the text in [[Pahlavi scripts|Pahlavi]] and in [[Pazand]], a glossary, and his extensive annotations. He scrutinized the comparative theology of this polemical work, which consciously employs reason to criticize the monotheism of Jews, Christians, and Muslims. Each of its chapters is introduced, translated into French, and followed by commentary. The clarity of his language was remarkable. The book was dedicated to his teacher and friend, Professor Benveniste.&lt;ref&gt;Jean de Menasce, ''[[Shikand-gumanic Vichar|Škand-Gumānīk Vičār]]'' (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux et Tafazzoli, "J. P. de Menasce 1902-1973 Biographie", pp. viii-x. (Benveniste; the ''SVG'').&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1947 the [[University of Paris]] invited him to give a series of seminars at the [[Sorbonne]] on the Zoroastrian texts, the [[Denkard|Denkart]]. His work here was published in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;A collection of his essays, ''Une Encyclopédie mazdiénne, le Dēnkart'' (1958).&lt;/ref&gt; Menasce was a leader in investigating the [[epigraphy]] of the [[Sasanian Empire]]. With [[Henry Corbin]] and [[Gilbert Lazard]] he was a founder of the Association pour l'advancement de études iraniennes.&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux, ''Menasce" (2014): epigraphy, founder.&lt;/ref&gt; His academic production on Zoroastrian subjects accumulated, including an article on imperial Sasanid law.&lt;ref&gt;de Menasce, "Feux et fondations pieuses dans le droit sassanide" (1964).&lt;/ref&gt; 

De Menasce illustrated points of convergence between Zoroastrian theological reasoning and the Muslim philosophic school of [[Mu'tazila]], whereby the deity Allah would be understood as divorced from "all cause" [''toute causalité''] of evil in the world. He probed [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine's]] period as a [[Manichean]], a dualist religion derived in part from Zoroastrianism; Augustine later converted to Christianity and became a [[Church Father]].&lt;ref&gt;de Menasce, "Augustin manichéen" (1956).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux, "Menasce" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt; His continued study of the Denkart eventually resulted in further seminars at the Sorbonne in 1962-1964, and the posthumous publication of his work on the Denkart's third book.&lt;ref&gt;de Menasce, ''Le Troisième Livre du [[Dēnkart]]'' ([1973], 1984).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux et Tafazzoli, "J. P. de Menasce 1902-1973 Biographie", pp. xi-xiv. (Sorbonne seminars, Sassanid law, Mu'tazila, ''Troisième Livre'').&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publications and posts===
The published works of de Menasce include books and articles on subjects including: theology, philosophy, law, [[history of religions]], Zoroastrianism, and also [[Judaism]], [[Zionism]], and [[Hassidism]].&lt;ref&gt;Levy, "Jean de Menasce: juif, sioniste, prétre" at p. 9. His pro-Israel concerns seemed to include a society of converted Jews who'd nonetheless remain Jews to the Zionist state.&lt;/ref&gt; His reputation could rest on his translations alone, made into French from several different languages.&lt;ref&gt;Among his translations was a book by [[Max Scheler]], the 20th-century German [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in 1936 he had served as professor at the [[University of Fribourg]] in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;de Menasce, ''Škand-Gumānīk Vičār'' (1945).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hastings, "The Legacy of Pierre Jean de Menasce".&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939 in Paris he became research professor for the religions of ancient Iran. In 1945 de Menasce participated in founding the journal ''Nouvelle Revue de Science Missionaire/Neue Zeitschrift für Missionswissenschaft''.&lt;ref&gt;Spindler, "Menasce, Pierre Jean de 1902-1973 Catholic (Dominican) Egypt" (the journal was edited by Johannes Beckmann).&lt;/ref&gt;  1954-1955, he taught at [[Harvard University|Harvard]], and at [[Princeton University|Princeton]], where he renewed his friendship with Jacques Maritain. From 1949 until 1970 he was Director of Studies at l'[[École pratique des hautes études]] in Paris;&lt;ref&gt;Éditions du Cerf, "Jean de Menasce (1902-1973)".&lt;/ref&gt; here an academic chair had been created especially for him.&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux, "Menasce" (2014).&lt;/ref&gt;

==An appreciation, his passing==
A Muslim colleague said of him, "[H]e made possible a degree of communication amongst us that would have been much more difficult in his absence." After suffering strokes in 1959 and 1969, Father de Menasce died at the age of 70 in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Gignoux et Tafazzoli, "J. P. de Menasce 1902-1973 Biographie", p. xi (strokes), p. xv (quote of H. Mahamedi).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Starting text of this article translated 11 July 2012 from "Jean de Menasce" at [[Wikipédia francophone]].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kyle Meredith Phillips Jr.''' (May 20, 1934, Cabot, Vermont – August 7, 1988, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania) was a leading [[United States|American]] [[Etruscologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richard|first1=De Puma|title=Necrology|journal=American Journal of Archaeology|date=1989|volume=93|pages=239–40}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phillips was educated at [[Bowdoin College]] (A.B. ''cum laude'' 1956) and [[Princeton University]] (M.A. 1959, Ph.D. 1962). At Princeton he studied with [[Erik Sjöqvist]]. In 1962 he also joined the faculty of [[Bryn Mawr College]]. Having excavated with the Princeton team at [[Morgantina]] in Sicily, Phillips decided to start a new project. Based on advice from [[Ranuccio Bianchi Bandinelli]], Phillips embarked on the excavation of an [[Etruscan Civilization|Etruscan]] center at [[Poggio Civitate]] near [[Murlo]], [[Siena]] in 1966.&lt;ref name="Phillips1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kyle Meredith Phillips|title=In the Hills of Tuscany: Recent Excavations at the Etruscan Site of Poggio Civitate (Murlo, Siena)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vVNoAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1993|publisher=University Museum, University of Pennsylvania|isbn=978-0-934718-96-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Here Phillips discovered a monumental complex whose interpretation remains controversial, despite ongoing fieldwork. In 1994 a monograph entitled ''Murlo and the Etruscans. Art and society in Ancient Etruria'' appeared in Phillips's honor.&lt;ref name="PumaSmall1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Daniel De Puma|author2=Jocelyn Penny Small|title=Murlo and the Etruscans: Art and Society in Ancient Etruria|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q7tSe2hNKlwC&amp;pg=PR29|year=1994|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-13910-0|pages=29–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, which has many contributions by Etruscologists, includes a list of his publications and a posthumously published article.

A  cult of personality uses various techniques, including [[mass media]], [[propaganda]], [[the arts]], [[patriotism]], and government-organized demonstrations and rallies to create an heroic image, of a leader, often inviting worshipful behavior through uncritical flattery and praise.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Adrian Teodor|last=Popan|title=The ABC of sycophancy : structural conditions for the emergence of dictators' cults of personality |date=August 2015 |doi=10.15781/T2J960G15 |url=https://repositories.lib.utexas.edu/bitstream/handle/2152/46763/POPAN-DISSERTATION-2015.pdf |accessdate=7 September 2018 |language=en |id=|hdl=2152/46763|pages=196–213|website=The University of Texas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Afghanistan==
[[Nur Muhammad Taraki]] of the ruling [[People's Democratic Party of Afghanistan|communist party]] served as [[President of Afghanistan]] from 1978 to 1979, when he told people to refer to him titles such as the "Great Leader".&lt;ref&gt;''Russia's Muslim Frontiers. New Directions in Cross-Cultural Analysis'' by Dale F. Eickelman, 1993. Page 123.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1990s, warlord general [[Abdul Rashid Dostum]], who controlled most of northern Afghanistan, created a somewhat cult of personality in the region.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/rashid-dostum-the-treacherous-general-9224857.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albania==
Long time ruler of [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|communist Albania]] [[Enver Hoxha]] had what the [[OECD]] called "an overwhelming cult of personality and an ultra-centralised, authoritarian form of decision-making".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Reviews of National Policies for Education:South Eastern Europe|author=[[OECD]]|year=2003|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=9789264100725|page=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=X1jWAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hoxha was widely portrayed as a genius who commented on virtually all facets of life from culture to economics to military matters. Statues were erected in cities. Each schoolbook required quotations from him on the subjects being studied. The ruling party of the time, the [[Party of Labour of Albania]], honored him with titles such as Supreme Comrade, Sole Force and Great Teacher.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}  When Hoxha died in 1985, [[Ramiz Alia]] took power. [[Robert D. McFadden]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that Alia's policies of liberalization were "too little, too late", and the country descended into [[Albanian Civil War|violent anarchy]]. Alia served one year in prison for corruption, but the anarchy prevented further charges from being brought against the former Communist regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/08/world/europe/ramiz-alia-former-ruler-of-albania-dies-at-85.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title=Ramiz Alia, an Enforcer for a Dictator and Later Ruler of Albania, Dies at 85|last=McFadden|first=Robert D.|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 7, 2011|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Argentina==
{{See also|Peronism}}

[[Juan Domingo Perón]], elected three times as [[President of Argentina]], and his second wife, [[Eva Duarte de Perón]], were immensely popular among many of the Argentine people, and to this day they are still considered icons by the leading [[Justicialist Party]]. Followers of the Peróns praised their efforts to eliminate poverty and dignify labor, while their detractors considered them [[demagogue]]s and dictators. To achieve their political goals, the Peronists had to unite around the head of state. As a result, a personality cult developed around both Perón and his wife.&lt;ref&gt;''Politics and Education in Argentina'', 1946-1962, by Mónica Esti Rein; trans by Martha Grenzeback. Published by M. E. Sharpe, Armonk, NY/London, 1998, p. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Azerbaijan==

==Brazil==
During the [[Vargas Era]], the Brazilian Department of Information and Propaganda (DIP) promoted a [[Messiah]]-style image of Brazilian dictator [[Getúlio Vargas]] by broadcasting propaganda every day and by showing him as "saviour of the Brazilian people".

[[File:Chiang KaiShek Portrait Tiananmen Beijing.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Portrait of [[Chiang Kai-shek]] on [[Tiananmen]] before the [[Chinese Communist Revolution|Communist takeover]]]]
A personality cult in the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] was centered on the [[Kuomintang]] party founder [[Sun Yat-sen]], and his successor, Generalissimo [[Chiang Kai-shek]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The personality cult of Chiang Kai-shek went further after the republican government fled to [[Taiwan]]. He was usually referred to as "Lord Chiang" (蔣公) in public and a [[Tai tou|space between the characters of his name and title]] was required in printed materials. Articles in textbooks and songs glorifying him were commonly seen in Taiwan before 1987.
[[File:Mao Zedong Statue in North China.jpg|thumb|160px|right|Statue of [[Mao Zedong]] in modern [[China]]]]
The [[People's Republic of China]] under [[Chairman of the Communist Party of China|Chairman]] [[Mao Zedong]] can also be considered a cult of personality,{{according to whom|date=March 2017}} the most obvious symbol of which is his massive portrait situated on the north end of [[Tiananmen Square]]. The [[culture of the People's Republic of China]] before 1978 was highly influenced by the personality cult of Mao Zedong{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} which reached its peak during the [[Cultural Revolution]]. Mao was referred to as "the great leader Chairman Mao" (伟大领袖毛主席) in public and he was entitled "the great leader, the great supreme commander, the great teacher and the great helmsman" (伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的导师、伟大的舵手) in Cultural Revolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J5QbQpQTegwC&amp;pg=PA421|title=A glossary of political terms of the People's Republic of China |year=1995|location=|page=639|accessdate=2012-08-01|isbn=9789622016156|author1=Li|first1=Gucheng}}&lt;/ref&gt; Badges and books of his quotations were mass-produced. Most people were required to recite the Quotations of Chairman Mao and printed material at that time usually quoted Mao's words in bold as well as in the preface. The Loyalty dance (忠字舞) was also introduced during the Cultural Revolution which lasted from 1966 to 1976.

The cult of personality continued for a short time after Mao's death. His successor, Chairman [[Hua Guofeng]] also practiced the cult of personality{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} and he was referred to as "the brilliant leader Chairman Hua" (英明领袖华主席). [[Chinese economic reform|Reforms]] in 1978 led to a deconstruction of Mao's cult status and the [[Communist Party of China|Chinese Communist Party]] under [[Deng Xiaoping]] and his successors such as [[Jiang Zemin]] and [[Hu Jintao]] were averse to a [[:zh:毛澤東崇拜|Mao cult]] of personality style of rule lest it recreate the chaos of the Cultural Revolution.

==Colombia==
Former president [[Álvaro Uribe Vélez]] became the center of a Cult of Personality in [[Colombia]] in the later years of the country's armed conflict. Supporters refer to him as "The Great Colombian" in spite of his family's ties to the [[Medellín Cartel]] and the numerous human rights scandals that marred his presidency. After Uribe failed to amend the constitution that would allow him to stay in power for a third term in 2010, he founded a political party that uses the former president's silhouette as logo. The party's attempts to be named after its "only leader" were thwarted in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semana.com/opinion/articulo/fanatismo-por-alvaro-uribe/524937|title=La deificación del senador Uribe|work=Semana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was reported that one of [[Fidel Castro]]'s dying wishes was not to have buildings or streets named after him, and that statues of him not be erected, in order to avoid a cult of personality, it is generally believed{{cn|date=October 2018}} that such a cult had already developed by the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;Bamat, Joseph (December 5, 2018) [http://www.france24.com/en/20161205-cuba-fidel-castro-cult-personality-last-battle "Is Castro's battle to avoid a personality cult destined to fail?"] ''[[France 24]]''.

This tradition has been continued by [[Teodoro Obiang Nguema Mbasogo]] who has been accused of building his own personality cult. As evidence of this, in July 2003, the state-operated radio declared that Obiang was "the country's [[God (word)|god]]" and that he had "all power over men and things."  It added that the president was "in permanent contact with the Almighty" and that he "can decide to kill without anyone calling him to account and without going to [[hell]]."  He personally made similar comments in 1993. Macías had also proclaimed himself a god.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Equatorial Guinea's 'God' |accessdate=1 November 2007 |publisher=[[BBC]] |date=26 July 2003 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/3098007.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obiang has encouraged his cult of personality by ensuring that public speeches end with well-wishing for himself rather than end with well-wishing for the republic. Many important buildings have a presidential lodge, many towns and cities have streets commemorating Obiang's coup against Macías, and many people wear clothes with his face printed on them.&lt;ref&gt;Maass, Peter (2005) [http://motherjones.com/politics/2005/01/obiang-equatorial-guinea-oil-riggs "A Touch of Crude"] ''Mother Jones'' 30 (1):&amp;nbsp;pp.&amp;nbsp;48–89&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Silverstein"&gt;Silverstein, Ken (2010) [http://www.petroleumworld.com/sati10061901.htm "Saturday Lagniappe: UNESCO for Sale: Dictators allowed to buy their own prizes, for the right price"] ''Petroleumworld'', originally published by ''Harpers Magazine'', 2 June 2010, archived at [http://www.freezepage.com/1287676231QTNSPIRBQH?url=http://www.petroleumworld.com/sati10061901.htm Freezepage]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indonesia==
During the [[Guided Democracy in Indonesia|Guided Democracy era]], there was a personality cult around [[President of Indonesia|President]] [[Sukarno]]. He was made [[president for life]] by the [[People's Consultative Assembly|MPRS]] in 1963. His ideological writings on Manipol-USDEK and NASAKOM became mandatory subjects in Indonesian schools and universities, while his speeches were to be memorized and discussed by all students. All newspapers, the only radio station ([[Radio Republik Indonesia|RRI]], government-run), and the only television station ([[TVRI]], also government-run) were made into "tools of the revolution" and functioned to spread Sukarno's messages. Sukarno developed a [[personality cult]], with the capital of newly acquired [[Western New Guinea|West Irian]] renamed to [[Jayapura|Sukarnapura]] and the highest peak in the country was renamed from Carstensz Pyramid to [[Puncak Jaya|Puntjak Sukarno (Sukarno Peak)]].

Sukarno was popularly referred to as ''bung'' ("comrade"), and he painted himself as a man of the people who carried the aspirations of Indonesia and dared to take on the West.&lt;ref name="Witton_28"&gt;{{harvp|Witton|2003|p=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some other titles were given to him, like "Great Leader of the Revolution".  When [[Suharto]] became president, Sukarno's cult and roles were erased by the new government in [[de-Soekarnoization]] policy.

The [[New Order (Indonesia)|New Order]] government created some propaganda, in which President Suharto is depicted as the "main hero" during the [[General Offensive of 1 March 1949|1949 General Offensive]], as well as during the [[30 September Movement]]. He was also granted the title of ''Bapak Pembangunan'' (Father of Development) in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;Rock (2003), p.3&lt;/ref&gt; In September 1998, four months after the [[fall of Suharto]], Information Minister [[Yunus Yosfiah]] declared that the ''[[Pengkhianatan G30S/PKI]]'' film would no longer be compulsory viewing material, reasoning that it was an attempt to manipulate history and create a cult with Suharto as the protagonist.

==Iraq==

As a sign of his consolidation of power as [[Iraq]]'s dictator, [[Saddam Hussein]]'s personality cult pervaded Iraqi society. He had thousands of portraits, posters, statues and murals erected in his honor all over Iraq.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1990-09-05/news/9003140468_1_saddam-hussein-iraqis-arab|title=Hussein`s Dark Side Enshrouded|last=Franklin|first=Stephen|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|date=September 5, 1990|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His face could be seen on the sides of office buildings, schools and classrooms, airports, and shops, as well as on all denominations of Iraqi currency (the [[Iraqi dinar|dinar]]). Saddam's personality cult reflected his efforts to appeal to the various elements in Iraqi society. This was seen in his variety of apparel: he appeared in the costumes of the [[Bedouin]], the traditional clothes of the Iraqi peasant (which he essentially wore during his childhood), and even appeared in [[Kurdish clothing]], but he also appeared in Western suits fitted by his favorite tailor, projecting the image of an urbane and modern leader. Sometimes he would also be portrayed as a devout [[Muslim]], wearing a full headdress and robe, praying towards [[Mecca]], but most often he was depicted wearing a military uniform.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Göttke, F. ''Toppled'', Rotterdam: Post Editions, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

An international airport, a university, a bridge, a dam, a stadium, an art centre, a street, an urban district (Saddam-city), a rocket and other objects were named after him. Saddam even had many well-decorated (by golden flush toilets) palaces for his own private use. People brought many gifts to Saddam that were collected in a special palace. According to his order, every tenth brick of reconstructed ancient buildings (including [[Nebuchadnezzar]]'s palace) was marked with his name or signature. His biography and his literary works were required reading in schools and Ba'ath party functioneers examined students' knowledge of them.{{Clarify|date=January 2014}} Many written songs, novels, scientific and propaganda articles were devoted to him. State TV was broadcast with his image in the background and a mosque at the corner of the screen and it very often showed him, or his hands being kissed by children and other people.

After the fall of his regime, made visible by the toppling of his statue on Firdous Square in Baghdad on April 9, 2003, all statues of Saddam were destroyed.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; All other aspects of his cult were dissolved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2009/04/saddam-husseins/|title=Saddam Hussein's Statue of Limitations|last=Sher|first=Lauren|work=[[ABC News]]|date=April 9, 2009|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Italy==

[[File:Propaganda.JPG|thumb|160px|right|[[Benito Mussolini]] in a poster promoted by fascist [[propaganda]] with the motto: "Win and we shall win"]]
The cult of [[Il Duce]] of fascist Italy [[Benito Mussolini]] was in many respects the unifying force of the fascist regime, acting as a common denominator for various political groups and social classes in both the fascist party and the wider Italian society. A basic slogan proclaimed that Mussolini was always right ({{lang-it|Il Duce ha sempre ragione}}). Endless publicity revolved around him. He was generally portrayed in a ''[[Machismo|macho]]'' manner, although he could also appear as a [[Polymath|Renaissance man]], a military man, a family man, or even as a [[Commoner|common man]]. This reflected his presentation as a universal man, expert in all subjects; a light was left on his office long after he was asleep as a part of fascist propaganda in order to present him as an [[insomnia]]c owing to his driven to work nature. Mussolini himself oversaw which photographs could appear, rejecting some, for instance, because he was not sufficiently prominent in a group. Legends of Mussolini defying death during the [[First World War]] and surviving assassination attempts were circulated in order to give the dictator a mythical, immortal aura. In addition to depicting Mussolini as being chosen by God, the regime presented him as having omnipotent, godlike or superhuman powers. His image proclaimed that he had improved the Italian people morally, materially, and spiritually. Even before his seizure of power, he was proclaimed the Duce in song. The [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|war on Ethiopia]] was presented as a revival of the [[Roman Empire]], with Mussolini as [[Augustus]].

With the entry of media [[tycoon]] [[Silvio Berlusconi]] into [[Italian politics]] in the [[2000s (decade)|2000s]], some critics claimed that a new kind of cult of personality was in place, favored by Berlusconi's three national television networks and newspapers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/06/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-varie-2/silvio-canzoni/silvio-canzoni.html|title="Silvio forever sarà, Silvio è genialità" il culto della personalità diventa canzone - Politica - Repubblica.it|work=repubblica.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the hymn of Berlusconi's movements [[Forza Italia]] and [[People of Freedom]] was ''Meno male che Silvio c'è'', literally "Thank goodness for Silvio".&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|WXf-YbsSh0Y|Meno male che Silvio c'è video ufficiale inno campagna PDL}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://100passijournal.info/20-anni-fa-la-discesa-in-campo/|title=Berlusconi: vent'anni fa la "discesa in campo"|work=100 passi journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to that, Berlusconi often described himself as the [[Jesus Christ]] of Italian politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4707368.stm|title=BBC NEWS - Europe - Berlusconi says 'I am like Jesus'|work=bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1874098_1874099_1874126,00.html | work=Time | title=Top 10 Worst Silvio Berlusconi Gaffes | date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; These attitudes were seen by public opinion as clear examples of the new political style that Berlusconi brought into [[Italy]], focused on the leader's [[charisma]], cult of personality and media domination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://forum.giovani.it/politica/118744-culto-personalita-italia.html|title=Giovani.it|work=giovani.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silvio Berlusconi was [[Prime Minister of Italy]] for three terms and four governments. He governed the country for a total of almost ten years (less than one year in 1994–1995; five years in 2001–2006; and three and a half years in 2008–2011).

==Kazakhstan==
President [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]] is the subject of a state sponsored personality cult in [[Kazakhstan]], where he has assumed the title "Leader of the Nation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lilis|first1=Joanna|title=Kazakhstan's Nazarbayev Cult Hijacks Winter Fun|url=http://www.eurasianet.org/node/67954|website=www.eurasianet.org|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kazakhstan's new holiday boosts Nazarbayev's personality cult|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2012/12/01/kazakhstan-new-holiday-boosts-nazarbayev-personality-cult/|publisher=Fox News|accessdate=26 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Laos==
A cult of personality is centered around the founders of the [[Lao People's Democratic Republic]], [[Kaysone Phomvihane]] and the less prominent [[Prince Souphanouvong]] since their deaths in the early 1990s as there were no personality cults bestowed to them during their time in power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/08/06/world/laos-capital-defies-time-and-change.html|title=Laos Capital Defies Time And Change|last=Kamm|first=Henry|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=1995-08-06|accessdate=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kaysone's portrait is displayed on public government buildings as well as on [[Laotian Kip]] bills. There is a museum built in [[Vientiane]] in order to honor Kaysone's life. Statues are also erected in his honor. [[Souphanouvong]]'s name and face are also seen in memorials, museums, and statues all across Laos, with a university being named after him in [[Luang Prabang]]. Due to Souphanouvong's past position as only a figurehead president and leader of the communist [[Pathet Lao]] movement with Kaysone holding the real power over Laos, the display of Souphanouvong's personality cult are seen with much lesser prominence than Kaysone.

==Libya==

A cult of personality devoted to Colonel [[Muammar Gaddafi]] existed in [[Libya]] [[History of Libya under Muammar Gaddafi|during his rule]].{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} His face appeared on a wide variety of items, including postage stamps, watches, and school satchels. Quotations from ''[[The Green Book (Libya)|The Green Book]]'' appeared on a wide variety of places, from street walls to airports and even on pens, and they were also put to [[pop music]] for public release.

Gaddafi claimed that he disliked the personality cult surrounding him, but he tolerated it because the Libyan people adored him.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} Biographers Blundy and Lycett believed that he was "a [[Populism|populist]] at heart".{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=20}} Throughout Libya, crowds of supporters would turn up to public events at which he appeared; described as "spontaneous demonstrations" by the government, there are recorded instances of groups being coerced or paid to attend.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=16}}

He was typically late to public events, and he would sometimes not show up at all.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=17}} Although Bianco thought that he had a "gift for oratory",{{Sfn|Bianco|1975|p=7}} he was considered a poor orator by biographers Blundy and Lycett.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=18}} Biographer [[Daniel Kawczynski]] noted that Gaddafi was famous for his "lengthy, wandering" speeches,{{sfn|Kawczynski|2011|p=191}} which typically involved criticizing [[Israel]] and the U.S.{{sfn|Blundy|Lycett|1987|p=17}}

He inherited, however, a few titles such as 'Great Sun of the 21st century,' 'Marshal,' or his father's title 'Great Leader' [widaehan ryŏngdoja].

In the [[Philippines]], many local politicians engage in some sort of cult of personality. The most famous are those of former [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who was dictator from 1972 to 1986 and the [[Aquino family]]. They are often branded as "epalitiko" by the media, which is a contraction of the words ''epal'' (slang for "attention-grabber"), and ''pulítiko'' ("politician"). They put their images and their names on billboards of government projects. They also print tarpaulins, usually with their images in order to establish a sense of connection with their constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/763279/bishop-wants-anti-epal-bill-cover-politicians-holiday-greetings|title=Bishop wants anti-'epal' bill to cover politicians' holiday greetings}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.journal.com.ph/index.php/news/national/57283-luistro-has-no-problem-with-epal-politicians |title=Luistro has no problem with 'epal' politicians &amp;#124; National |publisher=Journal.com.ph |date=2013-09-01 |accessdate=2013-09-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130906195147/http://www.journal.com.ph/index.php/news/national/57283-luistro-has-no-problem-with-epal-politicians |archivedate=2013-09-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=VERA Files |url=http://ph.news.yahoo.com/blogs/the-inbox/posters-epal-politicians-ordered-removed-052148943.html |title=Posters of 'epal' politicians ordered removed &amp;#124; The Inbox - Yahoo!

==Poland==
{{Main article|Józef Piłsudski's cult of personality}}
A cult of personality developed in [[Poland]] around the figure of [[Józef Piłsudski]], a Polish military commander and politician, starting from the [[interwar period]] and continuing after his death in 1935 until the present day. During the interwar period, Piłsudski's personality cult was propagated by the state media, which described him as a masterful strategist and a political visionary, and associated him with his role in regaining Polish independence in the aftermath of [[World War I]], and his leadership in the ensuing [[Polish–Soviet War]]. It has survived decades of repression, particularly during the era of [[People's Republic of Poland|communist rule]].

In modern Poland, Piłsudski is recognized as an important and largely positive figure in [[History of Poland|Polish history]]. [[Polish Independence Day]] is commemorated on November 11, the date when Piłsudski assumed power in Poland after the First World War.
The [[Law and Justice]] party builds the cult of the deceased  president [[Lech Kaczyński]]

[[File:Personality Cult Romania 1986.jpg|thumb|Nicolae Ceaușescu and his wife Elena in 1986]]
In 1986 ''[[The New York Times]]'' reporter, [[David Binder (journalist)|David Binder]] stated that [[Socialist Republic of Romania|Romanian]] dictator [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] presided over "a cult of personality that has equaled, or even surpassed, those of [[Stalin's Russia]], [[Mao's China]] and [[Josip Broz Tito|Tito]]'s [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/magazine/the-cult-of-ceausescu.html|title=The Cult of Ceausescu|last=Binder|first=David|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=November 30, 1986|accessdate=November 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the personality cult surrounding Kim Il-sung in North Korea, it started with the 1971 [[July Theses]] which reversed the liberalization of the 1960s and imposed a strict nationalist ideology. Initially, the cult of personality was only focused on Ceaușescu himself; however, by the early 1980s, his wife [[Elena Ceaușescu|Elena]] was also a focus of the cult even to the extent that she got credit for scientific achievements which she could never have accomplished. It remained in force until the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|overthrow of the regime in 1989]] and the couple's execution.

{{quote|Comrades, the cult of the individual acquired such monstrous size chiefly because Stalin himself, using all conceivable methods, supported the glorification of his own person.... One of the most characteristic examples of Stalin's self-glorification and of his lack of even elementary modesty is the edition of his Short Biography, which was published in 1948.

This book is an expression of the most dissolute flattery, an example of making a man into a godhead, of transforming him into an infallible sage, "the greatest leader", "sublime strategist of all times and nations". Finally no other words could be found with which to lift Stalin up to the heavens.

We need not give here examples of the loathsome adulation filling this book. All we need to add is that they all were approved and edited by Stalin personally and some of them were added in his own handwriting to the draft text of the book.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news | title = The Cult of the Individual | url = https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2007/apr/26/greatspeeches2 | accessdate = 2012-09-02 | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Nikita | last=Khrushchev | date=26 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some authors (e.g., [[Alexander Zinovyev]]) have argued that [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s rule was also characterized by a cult of personality, though unlike Stalin, Brezhnev did not initiate large-scale persecutions in the country. One of the aspects of Leonid Brezhnev's cult of personality was his obsession with titles, rewards and decorations, leading to his inflated decoration with medals, orders and so on.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. http://oldgazette.ru/kopravda/21021978/01-1.html.&lt;/ref&gt; This was often ridiculed by the ordinary people and led to the creation of many [[Russian political jokes#Brezhnev|political jokes]].

Some journalists and Russian oppositionists argue that there is now a cult of personality around [[Vladimir Putin]] (see also [[Putinism]]). Currently, one-fourth of the Russian population believes that a cult of personality reminiscent of Soviet Union-era leaders has developed around Vladimir Putin, while another thirty percent believed that there were increasing signs of a personality cult surrounding Putin.

A cult of personality surrounded [[Francisco Franco]] during his [[Francoist Spain|Falangist regime]]. During his regime, he was depicted like a [[King of Spain|king]], for example, he wore the uniform of a captain general (a rank traditionally reserved for the king), resided in the royal [[Pardo Palace]], appropriated the kingly privilege of walking beneath a [[baldachin|canopy]], and his portrait appeared on most Spanish coins. Indeed, although his formal titles were Jefe del Estado (Head of State) and ''Generalísimo de los Ejércitos Españoles'' ([[Generalissimo]] of the Spanish Armed Forces), he was referred to as ''Caudillo de España por la gracia de Dios,'' ([[By the Grace of God]], the Leader of Spain). ''Por la Gracia de Dios'' is a technical, legal formulation which states sovereign dignity in [[absolute monarchy|absolute monarchies]], and it had only been used by monarchs before Franco used it himself.

In Turkey, founder of the Turkish Republic [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] is commemorated by a myriad of memorials throughout the country, such as the [[Atatürk International Airport]] in Istanbul, the [[Atatürk Bridge]] over the [[Golden Horn]] (Haliç), the [[Atatürk Dam]], and [[Atatürk Olympic Stadium|Atatürk Stadium]]. His titles include Great Leader (Ulu Önder),  Eternal Commander (Ebedî Başkomutan), Head Teacher (Baş Öğretmen), and Eternal Chief (Ebedî Şef). Atatürk statues have been erected in all Turkish cities by the Turkish Government, and most towns have their own memorial to him. His face and name are seen and heard everywhere in Turkey; his portrait can be seen in all public buildings, in all schools and classrooms, on all school textbooks, on all [[Turkish lira]] banknotes, and in the homes of many Turkish families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Faces of the State: Secularism and Public Life in Turkey|last=Navaro-Yashin|first=Yael|year=2002|publisher=[[Princeton University Press]]|isbn=0-691-08845-4|pages=196–99|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the exact time of his death, on every 10 November, at 09:05, most vehicles and people in the country's streets pause for one minute in remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Kiss, Bow, Or Shake Hands: How to Do Business in Sixty Countries|last=Morrison|first=Terry|author2=Conaway, Wayne A.|year=1994|publisher=Adams Media|isbn=1-55850-444-3|url=|page=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, the [[s:tr:5816 sayılı kanun|Turkish Parliament issued a law (5816)]] outlawing [[s:tr:5816 sayılı kanun#1.1|insults to his reminiscence]] ({{lang-tr|hatırasına alenen hakaret}}) or [[s:tr:5816 sayılı kanun#1.2|destruction of objects]] representing him, which is still in force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Turkey: Terrorism, Civil Rights, and the European Union|last=Yonah|first=Alexander|year=2007|publisher=[[Routledge]]|isbn=0-415-44163-3|url=|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ihbarweb.org.tr|title=İhbar Web |publisher=İhbar Web |accessdate=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created to denounce the websites that violate this law, and the Turkish government as of 2011 has filters in place to block websites deemed to contain materials insulting to his memory.

A number of scholarly papers and peer-reviewed articles have assessed the personality cult that some claim has developed around U.S. president [[Donald Trump]]. One is in a paper that appeared in the 2016 [[American Political Science Association]] Annual Meeting. In the paper, Sarah Oates, from the [[University of Maryland]] [[Philip Merrill College of Journalism]], and Wendy W. Moe, from the [[University of Maryland]] [[Robert H. Smith School of Business]], discussed the subject broadly and then stated that "during the 2016 Presidential primaries, the 'cult of personality' candidate, Trump, won the primary."&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2830195 ''Donald Trump and the 'Oxygen of Publicity': Branding, Social Media, and Mass Media in the 2016 Presidential Primary Elections.''] Sarah Oates and Wendy W. Moe. [[American Political Science Association]]. 25 August 2016. p.21. Accessed 3 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Another is in a book by [[University of Dayton]] distinguished professor of history [[Larry Schweikart]] and political commentator and author [[Joel Pollak]]. In their book, ''How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution'', they state that "some conservatives looked forward to Trump's defeat as a chance to rid the GOP of the insufficiently conservative insurgents who were bringing it to defeat by choosing a candidate who was a mere reality-show Hollywood celebrity, a lifetime liberal who was hijacking their party and their cause with a vain cult of personality."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=PWvYDQAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT6 ''How Trump Won: The Inside Story of a Revolution.''] [[Joel Pollak]] and [[Larry Schweikart]]. Regnery Publishing. 2017. p.6. Accessed 3 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; A third was written by [[Ethnology|ethnologist]]s Jonathan Rosa and Yarimar Bonilla who wrote, "although we do not minimize the devastating impact that [Trump] administration's policies will have, or the new president's ominous behavior, we are wary of exceptionalizing the current moment. Our goal is thus to deprovincialize Trump, that is, to locate his election within broader historical, political, and economic assemblages of which it is but one part."..."This effort might include [studying] Trump's [[xenophobia]], [[bombast]], and cult of personality, reminiscent of leaders in South Africa, Gambia, Uganda, Libya, and Zimbabwe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/amet.12468 | volume=44 | issue=2 | title=Deprovincializing Trump, decolonizing diversity, and unsettling anthropology | year=2017 | journal=American Ethnologist | pages=201–208 [201] | last1 = Rosa | first1 = Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, stressing Trumps's own actions towards strengthening his own cult of personality, [[University of London|University of London U.S. Centre on American Politics and Policy]]'s Daniel Kato noted that "according to [[political theorist]] [[Hannah Arendt]]'s thinking Trump may yet hunker down, drawing strength from the resistance to him, and continue to consolidate his cult of personality."&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.lse.ac.uk/usappblog/2017/02/08/political-philosophy-suggests-that-trump-will-either-double-down-on-his-behaviour-or-eventually-give-in-to-institutional-opposition/ ''Political philosophy suggests that Trump will either double down on his behavior or eventually give in to institutional opposition.''] Daniel Kato.

According to Tomas Straka of [[Andres Bello University]], Chávez's cult of personality began following the [[1992 Venezuelan coup d'état attempts]] which Chávez led, with Straka explaining that some Venezuelans "saw no solution to their most fundamental problems and they saw in Chávez a savior, or an avenger of those groups that had no hope".&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; Since the beginning of Chávez's tenure in 1999, the Venezuelan government manipulated the Venezuelan public with social programs depicting him as a great leader for the people.&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; The struggles that Chávez endured throughout his presidency, such as the [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt]], also drew compassion from his followers which boosted his support.&lt;ref name=ABCcult/&gt; By the time of Chávez's death, speculation about potential Chavista reactions to his death were compared to the sorrow felt by those in [[North Korea]] who mourned the death of [[Kim Jong-il]],&lt;ref name=ABCcult&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rueda|first1=Manuela|title=The Cult Following of Venezuela's Hugo Chávez|url=http://abcnews.go.com/ABC_Univision/News/venezuelas-hugo-chavez-cult-created/story?id=18186070|accessdate=11 December 2015|agency=[[ABC News]]|date=11 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with one scholar of Latin America from the [[University of California Santa Barbara]], Juan Pablo Lupi, stating that the creation of Chávez's cult of personality was "very well-staged, all this process of myth-making and appealing to the feelings and religious sentiment of the people. This is something that is quasi-religious".&lt;ref name="HuffPoAPVen"/&gt; The creation of Chávez's cult of personality was a strategy used by his government to maintain legitimacy before and after his death.&lt;ref name="HuffPoAPVen"/&gt;&lt;ref name=VICEstrange/&gt;

==Vietnam==
[[File:Ho Chi Minh statue.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Ho Chi Minh]] statue in front of the City Hall of [[Ho Chi Minh City]]]]
The [[Vietnam]]ese communist regime has continually maintained a personality cult around [[Ho Chi Minh]] since the 1950s in the [[North Vietnam|North]], and it was later extended to the [[South Vietnam|South]] after [[Vietnamese reunification|reunification]], which it sees as a crucial part of its propaganda campaign surrounding Ho and the Party's past. Ho Chi Minh is frequently glorified in schools by schoolchildren. Opinions, publications and broadcasts that are critical of Ho Chi Minh or that identify his flaws are banned in Vietnam, and the commentators are arrested or fined for "opposing the people's revolution". Ho Chi Minh is even glorified to a religious status as an "immortal saint" by the [[Communist Party of Vietnam|Vietnamese Communist Party]], and some people "worship the President", according to a BBC report.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

The former capital of South Vietnam, Saigon, was officially renamed [[Ho Chi Minh City]] on 1 May 1975, one day after its [[Fall of Saigon|capture]], which officially ended the [[Vietnam War]].&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-18328455 | title=Uncle Ho's legacy lives on in Vietnam | first=Viv | last=Marsh | work=BBC News | date=6 June 2012 | accessdate=2 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Yugoslavia==
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}

[[Josip Broz Tito]] (in power from 1945 until 1980) developed cult of personality around himself. His cult is described as a combination of a "peasant chief, protector and the legendary hero".&lt;ref&gt;Apor, Behrends, Jones, Rees (2004). The Leader Cult in Communist Dictatorships: Stalin and the Eastern Bloc. Palgrave Macmillan&lt;/ref&gt; During his lifetime, his cult of personality included, among other things, [[List of places named after Josip Broz Tito|naming places after him]] (including four cities), celebrations of his birthday (including [[Relay of Youth]]), widespread use of his portraits, writing his name in landscapes, so they can be seen from the air, etc.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/30-years-after-his-death-titos-legacy-lives-on-in-the-balkans-1960884.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.titomanija.com.ba/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=213&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zaire==
[[Mobutu Sese Seko]] used his cult of personality to create a god-like public image of himself in [[Zaire]], which today is the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. Mobutu created a [[totalitarian state]], amassed massive wealth for himself and presided over the [[Economy of the Democratic Republic of the Congo#Zaire|economic deterioration of his country]] and [[human rights abuses]].

He used mass media communications to entrench his rule.&lt;ref&gt;"Mobutu Sese Seko". The Columbia Electronic Encyclopedia. Columbia University Press. 2012. Retrieved 30 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mobutu embarked on a campaign of pro-African cultural awareness and in 1972, he formally changed his name to Mobutu Sese Seko Nkuku Ngbendu Wa Za Banga ("The all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake.")&lt;ref&gt;There are multiple translations of the full name, including "the all-powerful warrior who, because of his endurance and inflexible will to win, will go from conquest to conquest leaving fire in his wake", "the earthy, the peppery, all-powerful warrior who, by his endurance and will to win, goes from contest to contest leaving fire in his wake" and "the man who flies from victory to victory and leaves nothing behind him"&lt;http://www.plexoft.com/SBF/N04.html#Sese&gt; and "the all-powerful warrior who goes from conquest to conquest, leaving fire in his wake" (Wrong, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lyla Pinch Brock''' is a Canadian [[Egyptologist]], specializing in epigraphy.  She lives in [[Saissac]], France.

She has taken part in a number of archaeological projects, including the [[Tell Borg Project]] and [[the Theban Mapping Project]] [for full listing, see references below]. On behalf of the [[Royal Ontario Museum]] she was responsible for epigraphy in the tomb of Amenmose ([[TT89]]) and wholly responsible for excavating and conserving the tomb of [[Anen]] ([[TT120]]). She also cleared and conserved [[KV55]] from 1992 - 1996. During excavation of the tomb in 1993, she discovered an [[ostracon]] painted with part of the original plan of the tomb among other objects. The pottery from this job has recently been published.
She was married to [[Edwin C. Brock]] who was also an Eyptologist until his death in 2015.&lt;ref name=Symposium&gt;{{cite web|url=http://symposium.thessea.org/2015/09/sad-news-ted-brock/|title=Sad News: Ted Brock|work=SSEA 2015 Symposium|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160125005314/http://symposium.thessea.org/2015/09/sad-news-ted-brock/|archivedate=2016-01-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter von Bohlen''' (9 March 1796, in Wüppels, in the [[Wangerland]] Gemeinde – 6 February 1840, in [[Halle (Saale)|Halle]]) was a [[Germany|German]] [[oriental studies|Orientalist]] and [[Indologist]]. He was a professor at the [[University of Königsberg]].

He spent the first 20 years of his life in strained circumstances. His talents and perseverance attracted attention, and he obtained admission to the [[Hamburg]] [[Gymnasium (school)|gymnasium]]. He afterward studied the Eastern languages at [[University of Halle|Halle]] and [[University of Bonn|Bonn]]. He then obtained an appointment at Königsberg, first in 1825 as extraordinary, and afterward in 1830 as ordinary professor of oriental literature.

==Works==
Bohlen has left many works which fully support his title to the high place which he held among Oriental scholars. One of his most important works is entitled ''Das alte Indien'' (Old India, 2 vols., 1830–31). Other publications of his are ''Die Genesis historisch-kritisch erläutert'' (Genesis explained critically and historically, 1835) and editions of [[Bhartrihari]]'s ''Sententiae'' (1833) and [[Kalidasa]]'s ''Ritusanhara'' (1840). The details of Bohlen's life are given with great minuteness and honesty in his ''Autobiography'' (Königsberg, 1841), which is full of interest, and cannot be read without producing a full conviction that he was no less distinguished by his amiability in private life than by his literary acquirements.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3812">In [[politics]], a '''regime''' (also known as "'''régime'''", from the original French spelling) is the [[form of government]] or the set of rules, cultural or [[social norms]], etc. that regulate the operation of a government or institution and its interactions with society.

==Usage==

While the word ''régime'' originates as a synonym for any type of government, modern usage has given it a negative [[connotation]], implying an [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] government or [[dictatorship]]. Webster's definition states that the word ''régime'' refers simply to a form of government,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/regime Regime] as defined in the [[Merriam–Webster]] website&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Oxford English Dictionary]] defines ''regime'' as "a government, especially an authoritarian one".&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/regime?q=regime Regime] as defined in the [[Oxford English Dictionary]]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Contemporary academic usage of the term "regime" is broader than popular and journalistic usage, meaning "an intermediate stratum between the government (which makes day-to-day decisions and is easy to alter) and the state (which is a complex bureaucracy tasked with a range of coercive functions)."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merip.org/mer/mer273/breakdown-gcc-initiative Breakdown of the GCC Initiative]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[global studies]] and [[international relations]] the concept of ''regime'' is also used to name international regulatory agencies (see [[International regime]]), which lie outside of the control of national governments. Some authors thus distinguish analytically between institutions and regimes while recognizing that they are bound up with each other:

::{{cquote|Institutions as we describe them are publicly enacted, relatively-enduring bodies of practice, procedures and norms, ranging from formalized legal entities such as the WTO to more informal but legally-buttressed and abiding sets of practices and regimes such as the liberal capitalist market. The key phrases here are ‘publicly enacted’ and ‘relatively enduring’. The phrase ‘publicly enacted’ in this sense implies active projection, legal sanction, and often as not, some kind of opposition.&lt;ref name="James_Palen"&gt;{{Cite book | year= 2007 | last1= James | first1= Paul | authorlink= Paul James (academic) | last2= Palen | first2= Ronen | title= Globalization and Economy, Vol. 3: Global Economic Regimes and Institutions | url= https://www.academia.edu/4251331/Globalization_and_Economy_Vol._3_Global_Economic_Regimes_and_Institutions_editor_with_Ronen_Palan_Sage_Publications_London_2007 | publisher= Sage Publications | location= London | page=xiv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In other words, regimes can be defined as sets of protocols and norms embedded either in institutions or institutionalized practices – formal such as states or informal such as the "liberal trade regime" – that are publicly enacted and relatively enduring.&lt;ref name="James_Palen"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5402">'''Reverential capitalization''' is the practice of capitalizing words, particularly pronouns, that refer to a deity or divine being, in cases where the words would not otherwise have been capitalized:

{{quote|and God calleth to the light 'Day,' and to the darkness He hath called 'Night;' and there is an evening, and there is a morning&amp;nbsp;— day one.|Genesis 1:5, Young's Literal Translation (1862)}}

In this example, "God" is in capitals because it is, like "Day" or "Night", a noun which is here a proper name, whereas "He" is an example of reverential capitalization, since while proper names are capitalized universally, reverence for any particular divinity—belief therein implied on the part of the author who capitalizes pronouns in reference to such being—is not universal. In short, when pronouns are capitalized which usually are lowercase, this usually implies that the writer personally reveres and regards as a deity the antecedent of that pronoun.

Nouns, which are not proper names, can also be capitalized out of reverence of the entity they refer to. Such examples include "the Lord", "the Father", "the Creator".

==Capitalizing nouns==

Capitalization, punctuation, and spelling were not well standardized in early [[Modern English]]; for example, the 1611 [[King James Bible]] has:

{{quote|For our heart shall reioyce in him: because we haue trusted in his holy name.|Psalms 33:21}}

In the 17th and 18th centuries, it became common to capitalize all nouns, as is still done in some other Germanic languages such as [[German orthography#Spelling of nouns|in German]]:

{{quote|By this Time it blew a terrible Storm indeed[...]|Defoe, Robinson Crusoe, 1719}}

{{quote|For through him our Heart is glad, since we trust in his holy Name.|Psalms 33:21, Quaker Bible, 1764}}

In languages that capitalize all nouns, reverential capitalization of the first two letters or the whole word can sometimes be seen. The following is an example from Danish, which capitalized nouns until 1948.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=73010 Retskrivningsreformen af den 22. marts 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|''{{lang|da|Vi troe paa en eeneste GUD, en almægtig Skaber af alle Ting, saavel synlige som u-synlige, og paa en HErre JEsum Christum, GUds eeneste Søn, fød af Faderen[...]}}'' – Ludvig Holberg, Almindelig Kirke-Historie, 1738&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbergordbog.dk/ordbog?query=GUd GUd, Holberg Dictionary]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://holbergsskrifter.dk/holberg-public/view?docId=kirkehist%2FKh.page&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;brand=&amp;chunk.id=bd1chap4 Ludvig Holberg, Almindelig Kirke-Historie, 1738, p. 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

(Translation) We believe in the one and only GOD, an almighty Creator of all Things, visible as well as invisible, and in a LOrd JEsus Christ, GOd's only Son, born of the Father[...] – Ludvig Holberg, Almindelig Kirke-Historie, 1738}}

Note that some instances are in all caps (''{{lang|da|GUD}}'' "GOD"), and some begin with two capital letters (''{{lang|da|HErre}}'' "LOrd", ''{{lang|da|JEsum}}'' "JEsus"). Some words that could also be said to refer to an almighty being begin with a single capital (''{{lang|da|Skaber}}'' "Creator", ''{{lang|da|Christum}}'' "Christ", ''{{lang|da|Faderen}}'' "the Father"), but so do all other nouns (''{{lang|da|Ting}}'' "Things"). This type of reverential capitalization varies within a single sentence and would also be dependent on the author and the publisher of a work.

The convention of capitalizing nouns was abandoned in English, and one of the people who were influential in this was Benjamin Blayney, who produced a 1769 edition of the Bible in which nouns were not capitalized—possibly simply to save space on the printed page.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Campbell, Bible: The Story of the King James Version 1611–2011&lt;/ref&gt; In the 19th century, it became common to capitalize pronouns referring to the Christian God, in order to show respect:

{{quote|For in Him doth our heart rejoice, For in His holy name we have trusted.|Psalms 33:21, Young's Literal Translation (1862)}}

In the 20th century this practice became far less common:

{{quote|For our heart rejoices in him, because we have trusted in his holy name.|Psalms 33:21, [[World English Bible]] (1997)}}

Today there is no widely accepted rule in English on whether or not to use reverential capitalization. Different house styles have different rules given by their style manuals. Reverential capitalization is not to be used, for example, according to the style guidelines set by the [[Chicago Manual of Style]]&lt;ref&gt;The Chicago Manual of Style, 15e, University of Chicago Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; or the [[Associated Press Stylebook]]. It is prescribed, for example, by the [[US Government Printing Office]] Style Manual (2008).&lt;ref name="gpo"&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/search/pagedetails.action?granuleId=&amp;packageId=GPO-STYLEMANUAL-2008&amp;fromBrowse=true |title=U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual |entry=3.3, Religious Terms |page=36 |publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office |accessdate=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This capitalization rule is also customarily applied in [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] and other [[languages of the Philippines]], despite being considered nonstandard and inconsistent by purists who contend that this rule is applied only in English.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19116">The conception of the [[separation of powers]] has been applied to the United Kingdom and the nature of its [[executive (government)|executive]] ([[UK government]], [[Scottish Government]], [[Welsh Government]] and [[Northern Ireland Executive]]), [[Judiciary|judicial]] ([[Judiciary of England and Wales|England and Wales]], [[Judiciary of Scotland|Scotland]] and [[Judiciary of Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]]) and [[Legislature|legislative]] ([[UK Parliament]], [[Scottish Parliament]], [[National Assembly for Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]) functions. Historically, the apparent merger of the executive and the legislature, with a powerful [[Prime Minister (UK)|Prime Minister]] drawn from the largest party in parliament and usually with a safe majority, led theorists to contend that the separation of powers is not applicable to the United Kingdom. However, in recent years it does seem to have been adopted as a necessary part of the [[UK constitution]].

The [[independence of the judiciary]] has never been questioned as a principle, although application is problematic. Personnel have been increasingly isolated from the other organs of government, no longer sitting in the [[House of Lords]] or in the [[Cabinet (UK)|Cabinet]]. The court's ability to legislate through [[precedent]], its inability to question validly enacted law through [[legislative supremacy]] and [[Parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], and the role of the [[European integration|Europe-wide institutions]] to legislate, execute and judge on matters also define the boundaries of the UK system.

==Approach==
Although the United Kingdom recognises [[parliamentary sovereignty in the United Kingdom|parliamentary sovereignty]], writers have stressed the importance of the [[independence of the judiciary]] in establishing the [[rule of law]], among them [[Trevor Allan (legal philosopher)|Trevor Allan]].&lt;ref name="ewing81"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; The role of the [[separation of powers]] has changed with the rise of judicial involvement in the affairs of government.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; [[Albert Venn Dicey]], writing in 1915 in ''[[Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution]]'', described the separation of powers as "the offspring of a double misconception".&lt;ref&gt;Dicey (1915). p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently [[Ivor Jennings|Sir Ivor Jennings]] has argued that it is of little relevance,&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;  and, faced with the role of the executive within the legislature, some authors describe only the independence of the judiciary as evidence that the model applies to the modern United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Few critics of the applicability of the separation of powers to the United Kingdom question the basic division.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 10&amp;ndash;11.&lt;/ref&gt;
The separation of powers has come under the stress of increasing government intervention into social issues outside its former remit dominated by administration and foreign and military policy &amp;ndash; the creation of [[big government]].&lt;ref name="drewry191"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt;  This has been seen by some as having led to a weakening of the concept of [[government]], replaced with the concept of governance.{{clarify|date=January 2017}} This lends itself to a more flexible approach considering the wide variation in the sorts of things that the "executive" does.&lt;ref name="drewry192"&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt; A similar approach is to take an approach of [[public choice theory]]. The self-interest of political actors, under this theory, bridges the separate sections of government, drawing upon the approach of the [[Committee on Standards in Public Life]] which applies the same rules to different organs, although heir approach to judges is separate.&lt;ref&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). pp. 11&amp;ndash;12.&lt;/ref&gt; Either theory would accept that there are wider decision making processes which are not restricted to a single branch of government.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). pp. 192&amp;ndash;193.&lt;/ref&gt; Another important idea is that variations within each separate part of government are as significant as differences in approach between branches, and require similar consideration.&lt;ref name="daintith12"&gt;Daintith, Page (1999). p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, [[Lord Mustill]] summarised the prevailing modern viewpoint in the 1995 judgment, ''[[R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union|R. v Home Secretary ex parte Fire Brigades Union]]'':&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v Secretary of State for the Home Department ex parte Fire Brigades Union'' [1995] 2 AC 513 at 567.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
It is a feature of the peculiarly UK conception of the separation of powers that Parliament, the executive and the courts each have their distinct and largely exclusive domain. Parliament has a legally unchallengeable right to make whatever laws it thinks right. The executive carries on the administration of the country in accordance with the powers conferred on it by law. The courts interpret the laws and see that they are obeyed.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Division between organs of parliament==
The [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] creates law through the authority of the [[Queen-in-Parliament]], securing the support of at least the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]], and usually the [[House of Lords]] as well &amp;ndash; although since the passing act of the [[Parliament Act 1911]] this has not been necessary.&lt;ref name="ewing82"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Under the [[European Communities Act 1972 (UK)|European Communities Act 1972]], the organs of the [[European Communities]] to legislate for the United Kingdom was recognised, by virtue of that Act. The power to create [[primary legislation]] has also been devolved to [[Scottish parliament|Scottish]] and [[National Assembly for Wales|Welsh parliament]]s and to government ministers and local authorities to create [[secondary legislation]].&lt;ref name="ewing82"/&gt;

The executive comprises all official and public authorities (including [[local authorities]]) that govern the UK, from initiating and implementing legislation to the running of local and national services, such as [[waste collection|rubbish collection]]s and the [[police in the United Kingdom|police]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 83.&lt;/ref&gt; The civil service remains non-partisan (having little in common with the Cabinet and Prime Minister in that respect).&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; The executive also exercises a number of powers under the [[Royal Prerogative in the United Kingdom|Royal Prerogative]], including [[foreign relations]]; many other actions are taken in the sovereign's name, from whom executive power is derived. The [[Council of the European Union|Council]] and the  [[EU Commission|Commission]] of the [[European Union]] also exercise executive power, as do [[devolved government]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; Within the executive, there is no longer a clear elected&amp;ndash;non-elected divide: decision-makers are of both sorts since the widening of the government's remit.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which the Civil Service serves the government, rather than usurping it, is one character of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Drewry in Jowell, Oliver (eds.) (2011). p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

The judicial function determines the outcome of disputes and performs minor legislative and administrative functions. It oversees both public and private law through [[Civil court|civil]] and [[criminal court]]s and a variety of [[tribunal]]s.&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt; The [[Human Rights Act 1998]] has placed a requirement that courts take into account the jurisprudence of the [[European Court of Human Rights]].&lt;ref name="ewing83"/&gt;

The introduction of a tax is a [[legislature|legislative]] function; collecting tax is an [[executive (government)|executive]] and administrative function; settling tax disputes is a judicial function, as is [[judicial review]] of executive decisions.&lt;ref name="ewing81"/&gt; However, such an approach does not in itself enlighten what each role entails: the audit of public expenditure was a judicial function in the fourteenth century; an executive one in the eighteenth; and is now a legislative function. This is not in itself a measure of efficiency or good process, or what the function actually entails.&lt;ref name="daintith12"/&gt;

The separation of powers may require, depending on interpretation, that the membership of the three powers must be separate; that one of the three powers does not control the work of another; or that one organ of government should not exercise the powers of another. Keeping all three roles separate is seen as both theoretically and practically impossible.&lt;ref name="ewing87"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislature and executive==

The legislature and executive have a close relationship in the UK constitution. This led  [[Walter Bagehot]] to declare the "nearly complete fusion" of the roles in the nineteenth century. Other writers have stressed that the harmonisation of the legislature and executive does not preclude their distinctiveness.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; By convention, [[Minister (government)|government minister]]s are drawn from one of the two houses; the weight of democratic responsibility entails that most come from the House of Commons.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt; There is, however, a limit on their number.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; Most other members of the executive are excluded from holding legislative office, including the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Civil Service]], the [[British Armed Forces|armed forces]], and the police, some of whom are prevented from becoming involved in any political affairs. The crossover in personnel is effectively limited to ministers.&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; The Prime Minister wields considerable power on behalf of the executive, as party leader and chief spokesperson for government policy.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

When the government has a clear majority it wields a lot of power to push through legislation. A 1978 [[Select committee (Westminster system)|Select Committee]] report suggested:&lt;ref name="bradley88"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The balance of advantage between Parliament and Government is so weighted in favour of Government that it is inimical to the proper working of our parliamentary democracy.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Between 1979 and 2010, the government had a safe majority which made the scrutiny of the government more difficult, although not impossible. The government could rely on its legislation being passed, although in some cases this did not happen.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt; The [[Conservative&amp;ndash;Liberal Democrat coalition]] complicated the party structure, since the [[leader of the Liberal Democrats]], [[Nick Clegg]], served as  [[Deputy Prime Minister]] under a [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="drewry192"/&gt; However, the legislature can oust a government through a [[vote of no confidence]], as happened in [[1979 vote of no confidence in the government of James Callaghan|1979]].&lt;ref name="ewing87"/&gt; This was driven by a growth in the political party structure, enforced through party discipline, as increased suffrage meant a far wider remit of government policy platforms.&lt;ref name="drewry191"/&gt;

[[Secondary legislation]] &amp;ndash; where Parliament passes limited legislative rights to the executive through an [[Act of Parliament]] &amp;ndash; is also problematic, although necessary for the efficient working of government. Legal rules should be relatable to the Acts of Parliament on which they are based, but this is not always possible. Proper scrutiny of government actions under secondary legislation is needed to prevent abuse.&lt;ref name="bradley88"/&gt;

==Executive and judiciary==
The [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]] remains an independent court, despite being organisationally part of the executive. The [[Lord Chancellor]], a member of the [[UK Cabinet|Cabinet]] is no longer a judge since the [[Constitutional Reform Act 2005]].  The [[Attorney General for England and Wales|Attorney General]] ([[England and Wales]]) and the [[Lord Advocate]] ([[Scottish law|Scotland]]) have "quasi-judicial roles" but are part of the executive.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 88&amp;ndash;89.&lt;/ref&gt;

In terms of control, the [[independence of the judiciary]] is confirmed through statute, constitutional convention, and weight of opinion. In England and Wales, judges in [[superior courts]] cannot be arbitrarily dismissed by the executive, instead serving whilst in "good behaviour".&lt;ref name="ewing89"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; Those in lower courts have similar protection from dismissal without due cause. Most members of tribunals cannot be dismissed by members of the government department of which they form part. This is important in cases of [[judicial review]] and other judicial methods of preventing government abuse of power.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt;

The judiciary undertake minor legislative functions in the form of court procedure, which, whilst the performance of a conflicting power, strengthens their independence. Tribunals are tied, but remain independent from, the executive. Government departments adjudicate on many decisions, and are required to take principles such as fairness and transparency into account in return.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; The courts provide only one method of dispute resolution, albeit one that is important where the government is one party and independence is necessary. The picture of which decision-making processes should be assigned to which body is complicated.&lt;ref name="ewing89"/&gt; There remain problems with the scope of role of the [[UK Home Secretary|Home Secretary]] in the [[penal system]] and judicial decisions with regard to sentencing.&lt;ref name="ewing90"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Nolan LJ, in ''[[M v Home Office]]'', noted that:&lt;ref&gt;M v Home Office [1992] QB 270 at 314.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The proper constitutional relationship of the executive with the courts is that the courts will respect all acts of the executive within its lawful province, and that the executive will respect all decisions of the courts as to what its lawful province is.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In matters such as Extradition of British nationals, courts must first consent and the [[Home Secretary]] must agree and sign an Extradition Order or the individual cannot be extradited. A recent example of this is autistic computer-hacker [[Gary McKinnon]] being extradited to the United States. The courts decreed that he could be extradited and that it would not harm him. However the [[Home Secretary]] announced that she refused to sign the order as she believed it would harm his life rights and could lead to him committing suicide.

==Judiciary and legislature==
The judges of the [[UK Supreme Court|Supreme Court]] do not sit in the House of Lords. Until 2009, the judges appointed as [[Law Lords]] formed part of the House of Lords in Parliament. The creation of the Supreme Court ended confusion in name of both capacities. No [[Member of Parliament (UK)|Member of Parliament]] may hold a full-time position in the judiciary.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt;

The departure of the judiciary from the [[House of Lords]] has led to greater tension between the government, Parliament and the courts, as the senior judges are no longer able to amend and speak on Bills and Peers are no longer able to question the judges and thereby hold them to account.

The legislature retains the right to impeach members of the judiciary by agreement of both houses, but this has only happened once in three hundred years. There are restrictions on the criticism of judges in parliament.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; Courts are bound to interpret Acts of Parliament, even retrospectively, and [[legislative supremacy]] dictates that they cannot declare properly enacted law invalid. They are not bound by other resolutions of either house.&lt;ref name="ewing90"/&gt; The European Communities Act 1972 places a legislature-imposed requirement on the judiciary to follow European case law in relevant matters.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). pp. 90&amp;ndash;91.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] allows the courts to make a [[declaration of incompatibility]], they cannot disapply legislation.&lt;ref name="ewing91"&gt;Bradley, Ewing (2007). p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each House of Parliament retains the right to punish offenders within its walls (including [[exclusive cognisance]]), with the potential to cause conflict.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt; However, ''[[R v Chaytor]]'' confirmed that right was limited in scope, and that it was the court that decided what that scope was.&lt;ref name="chaytor"&gt;''R v Chaytor''. [2010] [[UK Supreme Court|UKSC]] 52.&lt;/ref&gt; It was considered very unlikely that parliament would seek to protect those guilty of a crime unrelated to parliamentary business in this way.&lt;ref name="chaytor"/&gt; The courts have also exercised a quasi-legislative power through [[precedent]] &amp;ndash; for example, ending the [[marital rape]] exemption in ''[[R v R (Rape: marital exemption)]]''.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''R v R (Rape: marital exemption)'' [1992] 1 AC 599.&lt;/ref&gt; There is particular scope for the identification and application of personal liberties, and some cases have shaped the judiciary&amp;ndash;legislature relationship.&lt;ref name="ewing91"/&gt;

The '''Sovi Basin''' is located in [[Naitasiri Province]], on the island of [[Viti Levu]], the largest island in [[Fiji]]. Covering approximately 19,600 hectares, the basin is blanketed by a well-preserved tropical lowland forest, which is Fiji's largest and most biologically diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sovi Basin - UNESCO World Heritage Centre|url=http://whc.unesco.org/en/tentativelists/1374/|website=whc.unesco.org|publisher=UNESCO World Heritage Centre|accessdate=28 May 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sovi basin resides within the Polynesia/Micronesia biodiversity hotspot, one of 34 hot spots throughout the globe. The site is to be protected in a partnership between [[Fiji Water]] and [[Conservation International]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20071107005364/en/FIJI-Water-Announces-Sustainable-Growth-Initiative-Commitment Fiji Water Announces Sustainable Growth Initiative With Commitment To Help Mitigate Global Climate Change]&lt;/ref&gt; The rainforest, wilderness area and high

[[Irish language|Irish]] is a main home, work or community language for approximately 2% of the population of the [[Republic of Ireland]];&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;http://www.cso.ie/en/media/csoie/releasespublications/documents/population/2017/7._The_Irish_language.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; the population of the Republic of Ireland was shown as 4,761,865 in the 2016 census.
The 2011 census in [[Northern Ireland]] showed that Irish is the home language of 0.2% of people, with 6% of people able to speak Irish to varying degrees (see [[Irish language in Northern Ireland]]). One in four people (~1.7 million) on the island of Ireland claims to understand Irish to some extent. Estimates of fully native Irish language speakers range from 40,000 up to 80,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Linguistic Minorities in Multilingual Settings: Implications for Language Policies |first=Christina |last=Bratt Paulston |publisher=J.

[[Image:Quadrangle, National University of Ireland, Galway.jpg|thumb|The [[National University of Ireland, Galway]] (NUIG, formerly UCG). NUIG is a centre of academic work in the Irish language and is also adjacent to the Connemara Gaeltacht.]] Over 65,000 students on the island of Ireland are attending Irish-language medium education at pre-school, primary, secondary and third-level. Irish-language medium pre-schools are known as [[Naíonra]]í while Irish-language medium primary and secondary schools are known as [[Gaelscoileanna]] and [[Gaelcholáiste|Gaelcholáistí]]. Additionally over 25,000 second-level students from across Ireland attend Irish language-medium summer colleges in the Gaeltacht every year, generally for periods of three weeks.

Irish is the least widely spoken among the 24 [[Languages of the European Union#Irish|official languages of the European Union]]. [[Irish language outside Ireland|The use of the language in the Irish diaspora]] has been declining steadily.

Irish speakers outside the Gaeltacht include both second-language speakers and native speakers who were raised and educated through Irish. They are sometimes known as {{lang|ga|Gaeilgeoirí}} and constitute an expanding minority, though of uncertain size. They are predominantly urban dwellers. Present trends make it likely that they represent the future of the language and a guarantee of its survival.

Recent research suggests that urban Irish is developing in a direction of its own and that Irish speakers from urban areas can find it difficult to understand Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Ó Broin|title=Schism fears for Gaeilgeoirí|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/weekend/2010/0116/1224262447899.html|publisher=Irishtimes.com|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is related to an urban tendency to simplify the phonetic and grammatical structure of the language.&lt;ref name="irishtimes.com"/&gt; The written standard remains the same for both groups, and urban Irish speakers have made notable contributions to an extensive modern literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.litriocht.com/ |title=Gach leabhar Gaeilge i gCló - Irish Books |publisher=Litriocht.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that {{lang|ga|Gaeilgeoirí}} tend to be more highly educated than monolingual English speakers, and enjoy the benefits of language-based networking, leading to better employment and higher social status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market|journal=The Economic and Social Review|volume=40|date=2009|pages=435–460|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html|publisher=Ideas.repec.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though this initial study has been criticised for certain assumptions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beo.ie/ |title=Beo! - Meán Fómhair 2014 |publisher=Beo.ie |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; the statistical evidence supports the view that such bilinguals enjoy certain educational advantages; and the 2016 Republic of Ireland census noted that daily Irish language speakers were more highly educated than the population generally in Ireland. Of those daily Irish speakers who had completed their education, 49 per cent had a third level degree or higher at university or college level. This compared to a rate of 28 per cent for the state overall.&lt;ref name="cso.ie"&gt;http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/ilg/&lt;/ref&gt;

While the number of fluent urban speakers is rising (largely because of the growth of urban Irish-medium education), Irish in the Gaeltacht grows steadily weaker. The 2016 census showed that inhabitants of the officially designated Gaeltacht regions of Ireland numbered 96,090 people: down from 96,628 in the 2011 census. Of these, 66.3% claimed to speak Irish, down from 68.5% in 2011; and only 21.4% or 20,586 people said they spoke Irish daily outside the education system.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It was estimated in 2007 that, outside the cities, about 17,000 people lived in strongly Irish-speaking communities, about 10,000 people lived in areas where there was substantial use of the language, and 17,000 people lived in "weak" Gaeltacht communities. In no part of the Gaeltacht was Irish the only language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oceanfm.ie/onair/donegalnews.php?articleid=000002629 |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090105154755/http://www.oceanfm.ie/onair/donegalnews.php?articleid=000002629 |archivedate=5 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Complete or functional monolingualism in Irish is now restricted to a relatively small number of children under school age.

A comprehensive study published in 2007 on behalf of Údarás na Gaeltachta found that young people in the Gaeltacht, despite their largely favourable view of Irish, use the language less than their elders. Even in areas where the language is strongest, only 60% of young people use Irish as the main language of communication with family and neighbours, and English is preferred in other contexts.&lt;ref name="pobail.ie"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangalaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht: Piomhthátal agus Moltaí|date=2007|url=http://www.pobail.ie/ie/AnGhaeltacht/AnStaidearTeangeolaioch/file,8677,ie.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=Pobail.ie|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110222101323/http://www.pobail.ie/ie/AnGhaeltacht/AnStaidearTeangeolaioch/file,8677,ie.pdf#|archive-date=22 February 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study concluded that, on current trends, the survival of Irish as a community language in Gaeltacht areas is unlikely. A follow-up report by the same author published in 2015 concluded that Irish would die as a community language in the Gaeltacht within a decade.&lt;ref name="udaras.ie"&gt;{{cite web|title=''Nuashonrú ar an Staidéar Cuimsitheach Teangeolaíoch ar Úsáid na Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht: 2006–2011|date=2015|url=http://www.udaras.ie/media/pdf/002910_Udaras_Nuashonr%C3%BA_FULL_report_A4_FA.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=udaras.ie|accessdate=2015-06-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 the Irish government launched the [[20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030]] which is designed to strengthen the language in all areas and greatly increase the number of habitual speakers. This includes the encouragement of Irish-speaking districts in areas where Irish has been replaced by English.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plean2028.ie/en/node/14] {{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2015 independent report on the Gaeltacht commissioned by Údarás na Gaeltachta, however, does not regard this strategy as likely to be successful without a radical change in policy at national level.

On 13 June 2005, the EU foreign ministers unanimously decided to make Irish an official [[Languages of the European Union|language of the European Union]]. The new arrangements came into effect on 1 January 2007, and Irish was first used at a meeting of the EU Council of Ministers, by Minister [[Noel Treacy]] [[Teachta Dála|TD]], on 22 January 2007.

==Republic of Ireland==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:DublinAirportBilingualSignage.jpg|thumb|Bilingual sign in English and Irish at [[Dublin Airport]]]] --&gt;
The vast majority of Irish in the Republic are, in practice, monolingual English speakers. Habitual users of Irish fall generally into two categories: traditional speakers in rural areas (a group in decline) and urban Irish speakers (a group that is expanding).  
  
The number of native Irish-speakers in Gaeltacht areas of the Republic of Ireland today is a smaller fraction of the population than it was at independence. Many Irish-speaking families encouraged their children to speak English as it was the language of education and employment; by the nineteenth century the Irish-speaking areas were relatively poor and remote, though this very remoteness helped the language survive as a vernacular. There was also continuous outward migration of Irish speakers from the Gaeltacht (see related issues at [[Irish diaspora]]).

A more recent contributor to the decline of Irish in the Gaeltacht has been the immigration of English speakers and the return of native Irish speakers with English-speaking partners. The Planning and Development Act (2000) attempted to address the latter issue, with varied levels of success. It has been argued that government grants and infrastructure projects have encouraged the use of English:&lt;ref name="homepage.ntlworld.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://homepage.ntlworld.com/r.a.mccartney/baile_nua/migration.html |title=The state has anglicised the Gaeltacht by encouraging the immigration of English-speakers |publisher=Homepage.ntlworld.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303212112/http://homepage.ntlworld.com/r.a.mccartney/baile_nua/migration.html |archivedate=3 March 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; "only about half Gaeltacht children learn Irish in the home... this is related to the high level of in-migration and return migration which has accompanied the economic restructuring of the Gaeltacht in recent decades".&lt;ref name="homepage.ntlworld.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Irish Language in a Changing Society: Shaping The Future'', p. xxvi.&lt;/ref&gt; In a last-ditch effort to stop the demise of Irish-speaking in Connemara in Galway, planning controls have been introduced on the building of new homes in Irish-speaking areas. New housing in Gaeltacht areas must be allocated to English-speakers and Irish-speakers in the same ratio as the existing population of the area. It was reported on Nuacht RTÉ and Nuacht TG4 in November 2017 that most councils with Gaeltacht areas have not implemented this policy though since it came in.

===Claimed number of Irish speakers===

According to the 2016 Republic of Ireland census 73,803 people speak the Irish language daily in the Republic of Ireland outside the education system including 20,586 people who speak it every day in the Gaeltacht outside the education system. However, only 8,068 census 2016 forms were completed in Irish.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Some Irish speakers have called for the census form to be provided solely in bilingual format every five years to make the Irish language version easier for Irish-speaking citizens to avail of.

This is a '''List of [[Subdivisions of Ireland|Irish counties]]''' by the percentage of those professing some ability in the Irish language in the Republic of Ireland in the 2016 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cso.ie/en/releasesandpublications/ep/p-cp10esil/p10esil/ilg/ |title=  CSO Census of Population 2016 – Profile 10 Education, Skills and the Irish Language
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census did not record Irish speakers living outside of the Republic of Ireland.

===Law and public policy===

[[Image:geill sli.jpg|250px|thumb|A Géill Slí ("Yield") sign in [[An Rinn]] in [[County Waterford|Waterford]]]]

In 2002 the Government of Ireland published the first draft of a bill aimed at providing more services of a higher quality through Irish in the public sector. The bill was passed unanimously by both the Dáil and the Seanad in summer 2003. On 14 July 2003, An tUachtarán (President) signed the [[Official Languages Act 2003]] into law, and the provisions of the Act were gradually brought into force over a phased period of several years and are still not phased in fully. This was the first time the provision of services in general through Irish by the state system was placed on a statutory footing. It is hoped that the first Official Languages Act Amendments Bill will be brought before the Irish Houses of Parliament in 2018.

The aim of the Official Languages Act 2003 is to increase and improve in an organised manner, over a period of time, the quantity and quality of services provided for the public through Irish by public bodies. The Office of [[An Coimisinéir Teanga]] ( ''The Language Commissioner'') was established under the Official Languages Act as an independent statutory office operating as an ombudsman's service and as a compliance agency.
In 2006 the government announced a 20-year strategy to help Ireland become a substantially more [[bilingual]] country which was launched on 20 December 2010. This involves a 13-point plan and encouraging the use of language in all aspects of life. It aims to strengthen the language in both the Gaeltacht and the Galltacht (see [[20-Year Strategy for the Irish Language 2010-2030]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/1219/language.html?rss |title=Govt announces 20-year bilingual strategy - RTÉ News |publisher=RTÉ.ie |date=2006-12-19 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Government of Ireland, {{cite web|url=http://www.pobail.ie/en/IrishLanguage/StatementontheIrishLanguage2006/file,7802,en.pdf |title=Statement on the Irish Language 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110519011856/http://www.pobail.ie/en/IrishLanguage/StatementontheIrishLanguage2006/file%2C7802%2Cen.pdf |archivedate=19 May 2011 |df= }}&amp;nbsp;{{small|(919&amp;nbsp;KB)}}. Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Constitution====
Article 8 of the Constitution states the following:
{{quotation|
# The Irish language as the national language is the first official language.
# The English language is recognised as a second official language.
# Provision may, however, be made by law for the exclusive use of either of the said languages for any one or more official purposes, either throughout the State or in any part thereof.}}

The interpretation of 8.3 has been problematical and various judgments have cast more light on this matter.

In 1983 Justice Ó hAnnluain noted that Irish is referred to in the present Constitution as 'the first official language' and that the Oireachtas itself can give priority to one language over the other. Until that time it should be assumed that Irish is the first official language, and that the citizen is entitled to require that it be used in administration.&lt;ref&gt;[Translation] The State (Mac Fhearraigh) v. Mac Gamhna (1983) T.É.T.S 29&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1988 Justice Ó hAnnluain said it was fair to provide official forms in both Irish and English.&lt;ref&gt;Ó Murchú v. Registrar of Companies and the Minister for Industry and Trade [1988] I.R.S.R (1980–1998) 42&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001 Justice Hardiman said that "the individual who seeks basic legal materials in Irish will more than likely be conscious of causing embarrassment to the officials from whom he seeks them and will certainly become conscious that his business will be much more rapidly and efficaciously dealt with if he resorts to English. I can only say that this situation is an offence to the letter and spirit of the Constitution''."
&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[Translation] Hardiman, J. – Judicial Review – Supreme Court. Ref : Ó Beoláin v.Fahy [2001] 2 I.R. 279&lt;/ref&gt; In the same judgement he stated his opinion that it was improper to treat Irish less favourably than English in the transaction of official business.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

In 2009, however, Justice Charleton said that the State has the right to use documents in either language and that there is no risk of an unfair trial if an applicant understands whichever language is used.&lt;ref&gt;Charleton J., The High Court,[2009] IEHC 188&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Justice Macken said that there was a constitutional obligation to provide to a respondent all Rules of Court in an Irish language version as soon as practicable after they were published in English.&lt;ref&gt;Macken J., The Supreme Court,[2010] IESC 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish text of the Constitution takes precedence over the English text (Articles 25.4.6° and 63). However, the second amendment included changes to the Irish text to align it more closely with the English text, rather than vice versa. The Constitution provides for a number of Irish language terms that are to be used even in English.

====Place names====
{{see also|Place names in Ireland}}

The [[Placenames Order (Gaeltacht Districts)|Placenames Order]]/{{lang|ga|An tOrdú Logainmneacha (Ceantair Ghaeltachta)}} 2004 requires the original Irish placenames to be used in the Gaeltacht on all official documents, maps and roadsigns. This has removed the legal status of those placenames in the Gaeltacht in English. Opposition to these measures comes from several quarters, including some people in popular tourist destinations located within the Gaeltacht (namely in [[Dingle]]) who claim that tourists may not recognise the Irish forms of the placenames.

[[File:Bunbeg - R258 - geograph.org.uk - 1177841.jpg|thumb| Roadsign in [[An Bun Beag]] Gaoth Dobhair]]

Following a campaign in the 1960s and early 1970s, most road-signs in Gaeltacht regions have been in Irish only. Most maps and government documents did not change, though Ordnance Survey (government) maps showed placenames bilingually in the Gaeltacht (and generally in English only elsewhere). Most commercial map companies retained the English placenames, leading to some confusion. The Act therefore updates government documents and maps in line with what has been reality in the Gaeltacht for the past 30 years. Private map companies are expected to follow suit.

Beyond the Gaeltacht, only English placenames were officially recognised (pre 2004). But further placenames orders have been passed to enable both the English and Irish placenames to be used. An example of present inconsistency is the village of [[Straffan]], designated variously as {{lang|ga|An Srafáin}}, {{lang|ga|An Cluainíní}} and {{lang|ga|Teach Strafáin}}. In the 1830s [[John O'Donovan (scholar)|John O'Donovan]] listed it as "Srufáin"&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey Letters of County Kildare, co-authored by John O'Donovan.&lt;/ref&gt; The nearby village of [[Kilteel]] was "Cill tSile" for centuries, meaning "The church of Saint Síle", but since 2000 it has been shown as "Cill Cheile", which does not carry the same meaning.

[[Irish vehicle registration plates]] are bilingual: the county of registration is shown in Irish above the plate number as a kind of [[surtitle]], and is encoded from English within the plate number. For example, a Dublin plate is subtitled ''Baile Átha Cliath'' and the plate number includes '''D'''.

[[Conradh na Gaeilge]] has expressed concern over the proposed introduction of [[postcode]]s, which, similarly, may use abbreviations based on English language place names, although people sending mail would still be able to use [[Ireland postal addresses|addresses]] in Irish. It has advocated that postcodes should either consist solely of numbers, as in many other bilingual countries, or be based on [[Place names in Irish|Irish language names]] instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishpressreleases.ie/2008/11/11/irish-postcodes-should-be-irish-based-says-conradh-na-gaeilge |accessdate=1 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721125101/http://www.irishpressreleases.ie/2008/11/11/irish-postcodes-should-be-irish-based-says-conradh-na-gaeilge |archivedate=21 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Cost====
The cost of implementing a "Bilingualism Policy" has been queried both in Ireland and elsewhere. In Britain Lord Browne of Belmont asked the British Government what the cost was of implementing the Welsh Language Act 1993 throughout statutory agencies and departments in Wales. Lord Evans of Temple Guiting replied that "Departments and public bodies varied in the level of Welsh language service which they were providing or planning to provide prior to the 1993 Act. Since they would have been accommodated within existing budgets, it is not possible to make an assessment of any additional costs flowing specifically from the requirements of the Act."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Department of the Official Report (Hansard), House of Lords, Westminster |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200607/ldhansrd/text/70614w0003.htm#07061430000025 |title=Lords Hansard text for 14 Jun 200714 Jun 2007 (pt 0003) |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2011 comment on Irish education, [[Edward M. Walsh|Professor Ed Walsh]] deplored the fact that the State spends about €1,000,000,000 p.a. on teaching Irish, although it was not specified how he arrived at this figure. He called for a

&lt;blockquote&gt;…phased reallocation of part of the €1 billion committed each year to teaching Irish is a good place to start. All students should be introduced to the Irish language at primary level, but after that resources should be directed only to those who have shown interest and commitment. The old policies of compulsion that have so inhibited the restoration of the language should be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/education/2011/0125/1224288222124.html|title=Finding the muscle to fix our failing education system|publisher=Irishtimes.com|date=25 January 2011|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Professor Walsh's remarks provoked further comment for and against his suggestion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/0223/1224290627846.html | work=The Irish Times | title=Plan for optional Leaving Cert Irish | date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/letters/2011/0207/1224289182420.html | work=The Irish Times | title=Fixing the education system | date=2 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Companies using Irish===

Most private companies in Ireland have no formal Irish language provision. [[Tesco Ireland]] and some [[SuperValu (Ireland)|SuperValu]] stores have some in-store Irish signage. [[Tedcastles Oil Products|Top Oil]] garages have some Irish language signage in their garages and [[O'Briens Irish Sandwich Bars|O'Briens]] sandwich cafés have Irish language "Fáilte" ("Welcome") signs in their cafés. [[Bank of Ireland]] [[Automated teller machine|ATM]]s in many places have an Irish Language option and [[Allied Irish Banks|AIB]] ATM's display some Irish. Samsung phones have an Irish Language option and Meteor has also begun to offer an Irish language voicemail option to its customers. People corresponding with state bodies can send and receive correspondence in Irish or English although this provision is not complete in some semi-state companies yet. The [[ESB Group|ESB]], Irish Rail/[[Iarnród Éireann]] and [[Irish Water]]/Uisce Éireann have Irish-speaking customer support representatives and offer both Irish and English language options on their phone lines, along with written communication in both languages. These services are being phased in to all State organisations. The Emergency response number 112 or 999 also have agents who deal with emergency calls in both languages. Fuji Film have introduced an Irish language interface option to all Fuji Film kiosks around the world.

All state companies are obliged to have bilingual signage and stationery and have Irish language options on their websites with the Official Languages Act 2003 although these provisions have not been fully implemented in some state companies. [[InterCity (Iarnród Éireann)]] and [[Commuter (Iarnród Éireann)]] trains, [[Luas]] trams and [[Bus Éireann]] and [[Dublin Bus]] buses display the names of their destinations bilingually and their internal signage and automated oral announcements on their vehicles are bilingual and tickets can be ordered from Luas ticket machines in Irish along with in some other languages.

Many of the main social media forum websites have Irish language options. These include Facebook, Twitter, Google, Gmail and Wordpress.
Several computer software products also have an Irish language option. Prominent examples include [[Microsoft Office]],&lt;ref name=microsoft /&gt; [[KDE]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kde.ie/ga.php

[[Hiberno-English]] has been heavily influenced by the Irish language, and words derived from Irish, including whole phrases, continue to be a feature of English as spoken in Ireland: {{lang|ga|Slán}} ("goodbye"), {{lang|ga|Slán abhaile}} ("get home safely"), {{lang|ga|Sláinte}} ("good health"; used when drinking like "bottoms up" or "cheers"). The term ''[[Crack (craic)|craic]]'' has been popularised in a [[Gaelicisation|Gaelicised]] spelling: "How's the ''craic?''" or "What's the craic?" ("how's the fun?"/"how is it going?").

[[Taibhdhearc na Gaillimhe|An Taibhdhearc]] based in Galway is the national Irish language theatre. There is also a theatre [[Amharclann Ghaoth Dobhair]] based in the Donegal Gaeltacht. Sometimes plays through Irish are performed in other venues in Ireland.

Most public bodies have Irish language or bilingual names. [[An Post]], the Republic's postal service, displays Irish place names outside their offices along with most of their internal signage with equal prominence in both Irish and English and continue to have their stamps issued in Irish and display [[place names in Irish]] on their postmarks as well as recognise addresses printed or written in Irish. Other examples of State bodies or companies with Irish names include Bus Éireann and Bord na Móna. Traditionally, the private sector has been less supportive. Tesco Ireland have announced that their new main aisle signage will be bilingual when new shops of theirs open and when current monolingual English language signage is getting replaced and they are also considering bringing in an Irish language option on their self-service checkouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Éanna Ó Caollaí |url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/consumer/tesco-puts-the-fada-back-into-shopping-1.1733773 |title=Tesco puts the fada back into shopping |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2014-03-22 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.advertiser.ie/galway/article/64667/get-bilingual-and-get-more-notice-for-your-local-business |title=Get bilingual and get more notice for your local business |publisher=Advertiser.ie |date=2013-10-24 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Top Oil garages have Irish language signage in their garages and O'Briens sandwich cafés have "Fáilte" ("Welcome") signs on their doors. In contrast, the "100% Irish" [[SuperValu (Ireland)|SuperValu]] on the other hand have no Irish signs in many of their stores as do not many Lidl, Aldi, Marks &amp; Spencer and most international retailers in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland and indeed even most Irish owned retailers or companies. In Galway the inaction of most businesses to incorporate the Irish language into their services e.g. on signage despite the county having a large Gaeltacht area led to the establishment of [[Gaillimh le Gaeilge]] ("Galway with Irish") in the city. They have had a lot of success in promoting the Irish language in the business and commercial sector in the city. There is now a Cill Dara le Gaeilge organisation in Kildare and Gnó Mhaigh Eo in Mayo working with the business sectors in those counties also and it is envisaged that there will be many other such organisations set up in other Irish counties.

In 2016 it was announced that Galway City, Dingle and Letterkenny would be the first recognised [[Bailte Seirbhísí Gaeltachta]] (Gaeltacht Service Towns) under the [[Gaeltacht Act 2012]] subject to them adopting and implementing approved language plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.duchasandaingin.ie |title= Dúchas, Daingean Uí Chúis website |accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.donegalnow.com/news/letterkenny-announced-as-gaeltacht-service-town/124490 |title= Letterkenny announced as Gaeltacht Service Town - Donegal Now |accessdate= 24 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that more areas will be designated as formal Bailte Seirbhísí Gaeltachta in the future.

In 2018 it was announced that five areas outside the Gaeltacht on the island of Ireland are going to be formally recognised as the first [[Líonraí Gaeilge]] (Irish Language Networks) under the Gaeltacht Act 2012. The areas are Belfast, Loughrea, Carn Tóchair, Ennis and Clondalkin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.clare.fm/podcasts/ennis-recognised-lionra-gaeilge/?lang=en |title=Ennis Recognised As Líonra Gaeilge- Clare FM |accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.irishnews.com/news/northernirelandnews/2018/02/23/news/irish-speaking-areas-in-north-set-for-official-status-for-first-time-1262319/?lang=en |title=Irish-speaking areas in north set for official status for first time- The Irish News |accessdate= 2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.forasnagaeilge.ie/ceim-stairiuil-phobal-labhartha-na-gaeilge-taobh-amuigh-den-ghaeltacht/?lang=en |title= Historical Step for Irish Language Speaking Communities outside of the Gaeltacht- Foras na Gaeilge |accessdate= 22 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foras na Gaeilge have also said that they hope to award the status of Líonraí Gaeilge on other areas in the future.

Signage in Irish may be viewed as a gesture of goodwill towards the language. It does not necessarily imply that any of the staff in a particular establishment can speak Irish.

Thanks in large part to [[Gael-Taca]] and Gaillimh le Gaeilge a significant number of new residential areas are named in Irish today in a lot of counties in the Republic of Ireland. What may be surprising to many people is that these initiatives only really kicked off in a big way since the early 1990s when Galway City councillors passed a policy that all new residential areas in the Galway City Council area would be named solely in Irish. The initiatives spread to most other Irish counties during the [[Celtic Tiger]] 2000's property boom in Ireland in large part also thanks to the Gael-Taca free service to property developers to give them some optional choices of names in Irish for their developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.slideshare.net/DarrenJPrior/preasriteas-lnasa-2009|title=Residential e-project Darren J.

Prior website }}&lt;/ref&gt; A lot of counties in Ireland have proportionally few solely Irish language named areas though including the capital Dublin and four counties in Northern Ireland have none. There have been few new residential areas built in Ireland outside the [[Greater Dublin Area]] since the [[Great Recession]].

In an effort to increase the use of the Irish language by the State, the [[Official Languages Act 2003|Official Languages Act]] was passed in 2003. This act ensures that state bodies have to have services through the medium of Irish for Irish speakers; bilingual signage, websites and stationery. Major publications issued by state and semi-state bodies must also be available in both official languages. In addition, the Office of [[An Coimisinéir Teanga]] (The Language Commissioner) has been set up to act as an [[ombudsman]] with regard to equal treatment for both languages. The Official Languages Act is being implemented on a phased basis. The Official Languages Amendment Bill (2015) was expected to be brought before the Irish houses of Parliament before the end of the Fine Gael-Labour Government's 2011-2016 term in office but now is expected to be left to the next Government to bring in. The bill has been drafted and it is expected that amongst other changes in future it will be legal for Government Departments and local Government major reports or publications to be exclusively available in Irish or English only.

=== Media ===

{{Main|List of Irish language media}}

==== Radio ====

[[File:Raidío na Gaeltachta, Casla - geograph.org.uk - 1269978.jpg|thumb| [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]] Casla Conamara]]

Irish has a significant presence in radio. [[RTÉ Raidió na Gaeltachta]] (Gaeltacht radio) has gone beyond its original brief, covering not only the Gaeltacht but also national and international news and issues. It broadcasts across the island of Ireland on FM, although the station and all of its studios are based in the Republic of Ireland. There are also two Irish language-medium community radio stations [[Raidió na Life]] in Dublin and [[Raidió Fáilte]] in Belfast, the former being an older more recognised important training station for those wishing to work in radio professionally. There is also an internet radio station for young people called [[Raidió Rí-Rá]] which is available in some areas on [[Digital audio broadcasting|DAB]] which hopes to receive a national license on FM and there is an internet radio station in Galway Raidió na dTreabh which hopes to receive a community radio license to broadcast across Galway on FM.

All radio stations in the Republic of Ireland are obliged to have Irish language programming according to the [[Broadcasting Act 2009]]. Most commercial radio stations in the Republic have a weekly Irish language programme. [[RTÉ]] radio stations have daily Irish language programmes or reports- in most cases carrying Nuacht (News) reports through Irish.

The other community radio stations in Ireland usually have at least one Irish-language programme per week, depending on the number of employees or volunteers who speak it. Near FM, the community radio station covering north-east Dublin City, broadcasts "Ar Mhuin na Muice" five days a week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.youtube.com/user/ArMhuinnaMuiceNearFM |title=Ar Mhuin na Muice- Near FM |publisher=YouTube |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[BBC Northern Ireland]] broadcasts an Irish-language service called ''Blas''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/northernireland/irish/blas// |title=Northern Ireland - Irish Language - Blas |publisher=BBC.co.uk |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Television ====

[[File:Tg4logo.png|thumb|[[TG4]] The national Irish language television station based in Baile na hAbhann in Conamara]]

The Irish-language television station [[TG4]] offers a wide variety of programming, including dramas, rock and pop shows, a technology show, travel shows, documentaries and an award-winning soap opera called ''[[Ros na Rún]]'', with around 160,000 viewers per week. TG4  provides their Irish speakers with information while also giving them the opportunity to voice their opinions to the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Iarfhlaith|date=2016-06-30|title=Irish-language broadcasting: history, ideology and identity|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/016344370202400601|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=24|issue=6|pages=739–757|doi=10.1177/016344370202400601}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015 TG4 reported that overall it has an average share of 2% (650,000 daily viewers) of the national television market in the Republic of Ireland.&lt;ref name=TG4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tg4.ie/en/corporate/background.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150427085633/http://www.tg4.ie/en/corporate/background.html |archivedate=27 April 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This market share is up from about 1.5% in the late 1990s. The Ofcom 2014 annual report for Northern Ireland said that TG4 had an average share of 3% of the market in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/binaries/research/cmr/cmr14/NI_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; TG4 delivers 16 hours a day of television from an annual budget of €34.5 million.

[[Cúla 4]] is a children's television service broadcast in the mornings and afternoons on TG4. There is also a stand-alone children's digital television channel available with the same name with the majority of programmes in Irish and with a range of home-produced and foreign dubbed programmes.

[[RTÉ News Now]] is a 24-hour digital television news service available featuring national and international news. It broadcasts mostly English language news and current affairs and also broadcasts Nuacht RTÉ the daily RTÉ 1 Irish language news television programme.

=====Literature=====
{{Main|Modern literature in Irish}}
Though Irish is the language of a small minority, it has a distinguished modern literature. The foremost prose writer is considered to be [[Máirtín Ó Cadhain]] (1906–1970), whose dense and complex work has been compared to that of [[James Joyce]]. Two major poets are [[Seán Ó Ríordáin]] (1907–1977) and the lyricist and scholar [[Máire Mhac an tSaoi]] (b. 1922). There are many less notable figures who have produced work as well.

In the first half of the 20th century the best writers were from the Gaeltacht or closely associated with it. Remarkable autobiographies from this source include ''An tOileánach'' ("The Islandman") by [[Tomás Ó Criomhthain]] (1856–1937) and ''Fiche Bliain ag Fás'' ("Twenty Years A'Growing") by [[Muiris Ó Súilleabháin]] (1904–1950).

Irish has also proved to be an excellent vehicle for scholarly work, though chiefly in such areas as Irish language media commentary and analysis; literary criticism and historical studies.

There are several publishing houses which specialise in Irish-language material and which together produce scores of titles every year.

===== Religious texts =====
[[Bible translations into Irish|The Bible has been available in Irish]] since the 17th century through the [[Church of Ireland]]. In 1964 the first [[Roman Catholic]] version was produced at [[Maynooth]] under the supervision of Professor Pádraig Ó Fiannachta and was finally published in 1981.&lt;ref&gt;An Bíobla Naofa (Maynooth 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Church of Ireland]] [[Book of Common Prayer]] of 2004 is available in an Irish-language version.

===== Periodicals =====

Irish has an online newspaper called ''[[Tuairisc.ie]]'' which is funded by Foras na Gaeilge and advertisers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tuairisc.ie|title=Schmidt agus Gatland i mbun na cleasaíochta cheana, ach ní haon cúis mhagaidh an comhtholgadh|work=Tuairisc.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt; This replaces previous Foras na Gaeilge-funded newspapers which were available both in print and online. The newspapers ''[[Foinse]]'' (1996-2013) and ''Gaelscéal'' (2010-2013) ceased publication in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;'An Ghaeilge: bás nó beatha?', Derry Journal, 1 November 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1984 and 2003 there was a Belfast-based Irish language weekly newspaper ''Lá'' which relaunched as ''[[Lá Nua]]'' and ran as a daily national newspaper between 2003 and 2008 and had a readership of several thousand. The board of Foras na Gaeilge announced they were ending funding to the newspaper in late 2008 and the newspaper folded soon after.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nuacht.com/index.tvt |title=nuacht.com |publisher=Nuacht.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Irish News]]'' has two pages in Irish every day. The ''[[Irish Times]]'' has an Irish-language page called "Bileog" published on Mondays and they publish several other articles in Irish and some Irish language news in English on their Irish language ''Treibh'' page on their website. The ''Irish Independent'' publishes an Irish language supplement called "Seachtain" on Wednesdays and the ''[[Irish Daily Star]]'' publish an article in Irish on Saturdays. The immigrants' newspaper ''[[Metro Éireann]]'' also has an article in Irish every issue, as do many local papers throughout the country.

Several magazines are published in the language. These include the "flagship" monthly review ''Comhar'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iriscomhar.com |title=Comhar Teoranta |publisher=Iriscomhar.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an interest in new literature as well as current affairs and ''An tUltach'' a magazine by the Ulster branch of [[Conradh na Gaeilge]]. A quarterly magazine [[An Gael]],&lt;ref name="angaelmagazine1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angaelmagazine.com |title=An Gael - Irisleabhar Idirnáisiúnta na Gaeilge |publisher=Angaelmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to Comhar, is published in North America. The only culture and lifestyle magazine in Irish directed chiefly to a younger readership is [[Nós]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nos.ie/ |title=NÓS |publisher=nos.ie |date= |accessdate=2016-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Contemporary music and comedy====
The revival of Irish traditional folk music in the sixties may initially have hindered the creation of contemporary folk and pop music in Irish. Traditional music, though still popular, now shares the stage with modern Irish-language compositions, a change due partly to the influence of [[Seachtain na Gaeilge]].  Yearly albums of contemporary song in Irish now appear. However, it should be pointed out that all of these latter songs are translations from the English and not original compositions. The artists have included Mundy, The Frames, The Coronas, The Corrs, The Walls, Paddy Casey, Kíla, Luan Parle, Gemma Hayes, Bell X1 and comedian/rapper Des Bishop. The Irish-language summer college Coláiste Lurgan has made popular video versions in Irish of English-language pop songs.&lt;ref&gt;A link is available at Coláiste Lurgan: lurgan.biz.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two Irish-language radio programmes series specialising in popular music that are broadcast on many of the generally English medium commercial radio stations in Ireland, both created by Digital Audio Productions: [[Top 40 Oifigiúil na hÉireann]] and [[Giotaí]]. Top 40 Oifigiúil na hÉireann (Ireland's Official Top 40) was first broadcast in 2007.

It has become increasingly common to hear Irish top 40 hits presented in Irish by radio stations normally associated with English: East Coast FM, Flirt FM, Galway Bay FM, LM FM, Midwest Radio, Beat 102 103, Newstalk, Red FM, Spin 1038, Spin South West and Wired FM.

[[Electric Picnic]], a music festival attended by thousands, features DJs from the Dublin-based Irish-language radio station Raidió na Life, as well as celebrities from Irish-language media doing sketches and comedy. [[Dara Ó Briain]] and [[Des Bishop]] are among the latter, Bishop (an American by origin) having spent a well-publicised year in the Conamara Gaeltacht to learn the language and popularise its use.

===Education===

==== Gaeltacht schools ====
There are 127 Irish-language primary and 29 secondary schools in the Gaeltacht regions, with over 9,000 pupils at primary level and over 3,000 at secondary receiving their education through the medium of Irish. There are also around 1,000 children in Irish language preschools or ''Naíonraí'' in the regions.

In Gaeltacht areas education has traditionally been through Irish since the foundation of the state in 1922 but some schools are run through English today (in areas where there is not substantial community use of Irish). A certain number of students in the Gaeltacht areas are L1 (first language) Irish speakers, but even in the Gaeltacht areas the language was taught as an L2 (second) language while English was taught as an L1 language from 1922 until 2017. Professor David Little had commented:

{{quote|..the needs of Irish as L1 at post-primary level have been totally ignored, as at present there is no recognition in terms of curriculum and syllabus of any linguistic difference between learners of Irish as L1 and L2.}}

In 2015 Minister for Education and Skills [[Jan O'Sullivan]] TD announced that there would be a comprehensive change in the instruction and teaching of Irish in Gaeltacht schools which would include an updated curriculum for students and more resources. In 2016 [[Taoiseach]] [[Enda Kenny]] launched the State 'Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022' which has come into operation on a phased basis since September 2017. The policy document is the first time the State and Department of Education have recognised the different linguistic needs of Gaeltacht primary and second-level L1 Irish-speaking students. The policy represents a fundamental change in education in the Gaeltacht, while also allowing current schools who teach through English in the regions to opt-out of continuing to be Gaeltacht schools. Since September 2017 new students in the majority of Gaeltacht schools are being taught a new Irish Junior Certificate subject tailored for L1 speakers of Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=28 October, 2016 - Government Launches Policy on Gaeltacht Education 2017-2022}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is expected that a new Irish language Leaving Certificate subject directed at L1 speakers of Irish will come into the same schools in 2020.

==== Irish-medium education outside the Gaeltacht ====
{{Main|Gaelscoil|Gaelcholáiste}}
There has been rapid growth in an alternative school system (mostly urban) in which Irish is the language of instruction. Such schools (known as ''[[Gaelscoil]]eanna'' at primary level) enjoy strong support from elements of the urban professional class, but are also found in disadvantaged areas. Their success is due to limited but effective community support and a professional organisational administrative infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/ |title=Gaelscoileanna – Irish Medium Education |publisher=Gaelscoileanna.ie |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Gaeloideachas logo.jpg|thumb|Gaelscoileanna and Irish language-medium schools in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented by Gaeloideachas and An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta &amp; Gaelscolaíochta or COGG in the Republic of Ireland and by Gaeloideachas and Comhairle na Gaelscolaíochta in Northern Ireland.]]

In 1972, outside the Irish-speaking areas, there were only 11 such schools at primary level and five at secondary level. Now there are 180 Gaelscoileanna at primary level and 31 Gaelcholáistí and 17 Aonaid Ghaeilge (Irish language units) at second level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaelscoileanna.ie/en/about/statistics// |title=Scoileanna : Gaelscoileanna – Irish Medium Education |publisher=Gaelscoileanna.ie |date=2015 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; These schools educate over 50,000 students and there is now at least one in each of the 32 traditional counties of Ireland. There are also over 4,000 children in Irish-medium preschools or ''Naíonraí'' outside the Gaeltacht.

These schools have a high academic reputation, thanks to committed teachers and parents. Their success has attracted other parents who seek good examination performance at a moderate cost. The result has been termed a system of "positive social selection," with such schools giving exceptional access to tertiary education and commensurate employment. An analysis of "feeder" schools (which supply students to tertiary level institutions) has shown that 22% of the Irish-medium schools sent all their students on to tertiary level, compared to 7% of English-medium schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Language and Occupational Status: Linguistic Elitism in the Irish Labour Market|journal=The Economic and Social Review|volume=40|date=2009|page=446|url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eso/journl/v40y2009i4p435-460.html|publisher=Ideas.repec.org|accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since September 2017 new students in Irish language-medium secondary schools are taught a new L1 Irish language subject for their Junior Certificate which is specially designed for Irish language-medium schools. It is expected that a new L1 Irish language subject for Leaving Certificate students in Irish language-medium schools will be brought in&lt;!--not a mistake--&gt; in 2020.

[[An Foras Pátrúnachta]] are the largest patron body of gaelscoileanna in the Republic of Ireland.

==== Irish summer colleges ====

There are 47 Irish-language summer colleges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishsummercolleges.com/about.htm |accessdate=3 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100125231552/http://www.irishsummercolleges.com/about.htm |archivedate=25 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These supplement the formal curriculum, providing Irish language courses, and giving students the opportunity to be immersed in the language, usually for a period of three weeks. Some courses are college-based but generally  make use of host families in [[Gaeltacht]] areas under the guidance of a ''[[bean an tí]]'' for second level students. Students attend classes, participate in sports, art, drama, music, go to ''[[céilidh|céilithe]]'' and other [[summer camp]] activities through the medium of Irish. As with conventional schools, the Department of Education establishes the boundaries for class size and teacher qualifications. Over 25,000 second level students from all over Ireland attend Irish-language summer colleges in the Gaeltacht every Summer. Irish language summer colleges for second level students in the Gaeltacht are supported and represented at national level by [[CONCOS]]. There are also shorter courses for adults and third level students in a number of colleges.

==== Irish in English-medium schools ====
The Irish language is a compulsory subject in government-funded schools in the Republic of Ireland and has been so since the early days of the state. At present the language must be studied throughout secondary school, but students need not sit the examination in the final year. It is taught as a second language (L2) at second level, to native (L1) speakers and learners (L2) alike.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncca.ie/uploadedfiles/Publications/Languagesdiscussionpaper.pdf|format=PDF|title=Language in the Post-Primary Curriculum|date=November 2003|publisher=Ncca.ie|accessdate=2015-03-31|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717190511/http://www.ncca.ie/uploadedfiles/Publications/Languagesdiscussionpaper.pdf#|archive-date=17 July 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; English is offered as a first (L1) language only, even to those who speak it as a second language. The curriculum was reorganised in the 1930s by Father Timothy Corcoran SJ of [[University College Dublin|UCD]], who could not speak the language himself.&lt;ref&gt;Professor R. Comerford, ''Ireland'' (Hodder Books, London 2003) p145.&lt;/ref&gt;

In recent years the design and implementation of compulsory Irish have been criticised with growing vigour for their ineffectiveness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://universitytimes.ie/?p=1707 |title=The University Times &amp;#124; Head-to-Head: The Irish Language Debate |publisher=Universitytimes.ie |date=2011-02-21 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2007, the Minister for Education, [[Mary Hanafin]], announced that more attention would be given to the spoken language, and that from 2012 the percentage of marks available in the Leaving Certificate Irish exam would increase from 25% to 40% for the oral component.&lt;ref&gt;Department of Education &amp; Science, 11 March 2007, [http://www.education.ie/home/home.jsp?maincat=10861&amp;pcategory=10861&amp;ecategory=10876&amp;sectionpage=13637&amp;language=EN&amp;link=link001&amp;page=1&amp;doc=34715 Minister Hanafin announces increase in marks for Oral Irish to 40% in exams]. Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This increased emphasis on the oral component of the Irish examinations is likely to change the way Irish is examined.&lt;ref&gt;''Independent'', 12 July 2007.

Retrieved on 13 October 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, there is still a strong emphasis on the written word at the expense of the spoken, involving analysis of literature and poetry and the writing of lengthy essays and stories in Irish for the (L2) [[Irish Leaving Certificate|Leaving Certificate]] examination.

Extra marks of 5–10% marks are awarded to students who take some of their examinations through Irish, though this practice has been questioned by the Irish Equality Authority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

It is possible to gain an exemption from learning Irish on the grounds of time spent abroad or a learning disability, subject to Circular 12/96 (primary education) and Circular M10/94 (secondary education) issued by the [[Department of Education and Skills (Ireland)|Department of Education and Science]]. Over half the students granted an exemption from studying Irish for the Leaving Certificate because of a learning difficulty in the three years up to 2010 sat or intended to sit for other European language examinations such as French or German.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Irish exempt students sit for other languages|publisher=The Irish Times|date=14 April 2010|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/ireland/2010/1224268309255.html|accessdate=2 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Irish Academy]]'s 2006 conference on "Language Policy and Language Planning in Ireland" found that the study of Irish and other languages in Ireland was declining. It was recommended, therefore, that training and living for a time in a Gaeltacht area should be compulsory for teachers of Irish. No reference was made to the decline of the language in the Gaeltacht itself. The number of second level students doing "higher level" Irish for the Irish Leaving Certificate increased from 15,937 in 2012 to 22,400 in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/more-students-taking-higher-level-subjects-and-fewer-failing-1.3187599|title=More students taking higher level subjects and fewer failing"- The Irish Times 16.8.17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://tuairisc.ie/an-riachtantas-gaeilge-do-na-colaisti-muinteoireachta-bainte-amach-ag-88-de-dhaltai-ardteiste/|title=An riachtantas Gaeilge do na coláistí múinteoireachta bainte amach ag 88% de dhaltaí Ardteiste"- Tuairisc.ie 18.8.18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Debate concerning compulsory Irish====
{{anchor|Compulsory Irish}}
The abolition of compulsory Irish for the Leaving Certificate has been a policy advocated twice by [[Fine Gael]], a major Irish party which more recently won power in the 2011 general election as part of a coalition with the [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]]. This policy was the cause of disapproving comment by many Irish language activists before the election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Donncha Ó hÉallaithe Donncha Ó hÉallaithe |url=http://www.beo.ie/alt-litir-oscailte-chuig-enda-kenny-td.aspx |title=Beo! - Litir Oscailte Chuig Enda Kenny T.D |publisher=Beo.ie |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 [[Enda Kenny]], leader of Fine Gael, called for the language to be made an optional subject in the last two years of secondary school. Kenny, despite being a fluent speaker himself (and a teacher), stated that he believed that compulsory Irish has done the language more harm than good. The point was made again in April 2010 by Fine Gael's education spokesman [[Brian Hayes (politician)|Brian Hayes]], who said that forcing students to learn Irish was not working, and was actually driving young people away from real engagement with the language. The question provoked a public debate, with some expressing resentment of what they saw as the coercion involved in compulsory Irish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://irishtimes.com/blogs/ultach/2010/2010/4/15/compulsory-irish/ |title=Ultach " 'Compulsory' Irish |publisher=Irishtimes.com |date=2010-04-15 |accessdate=2015-03-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120718002639/http://irishtimes.com/blogs/ultach/2010/2010/4/15/compulsory-irish/ |archivedate=18 July 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the incoming Tánaiste [[Eamon Gilmore]] from the Labour Party in this book "Inside the Room" published in 2015 Enda Kenny tried to persuade him in the government formation negotiations in 2011 for Irish to become optional for the Leaving Certificate but he would not agree to it. No other main parties in Ireland are in favour of Irish becoming optional for the Leaving Certificate and it is questionable if Fine Gael will advocate in favour of the policy again in future manifestos if no other parties whom they may share power with in Government are also in favour of the policy. Fine Gael now places primary emphasis on improved teaching of Irish, with greater emphasis on oral fluency rather than on the rote learning that characterises the current system. 
 
In 2014 just over 7,000 students chose not to sit their Irish Leaving Cert exams, down from almost 14,000 in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irishtimes.com/news/education/more-is-more-as-number-of-students-taking-irish-and-science-increase-1.1894918|title=More is more as number of students taking Irish and science increase|date=13 August 2014|work=The Irish Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the Government abolished the requirement for barristers and solicitors to pass a written Irish language examination before becoming eligible to commence professional training in the Kings Inns or Blackhall Place. A Government spokesman said it was part of a move to abolish requirements which were no longer practical or realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.independent.ie/national-news/compulsory-irish-rule-to-be-lifted-for-lawyers-1225748.html | work=Irish Independent | title=Compulsory Irish rule to be lifted for lawyers | date=21 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bar Council and Law Society run compulsory oral Irish language workshops as part of their professional training courses.

====Irish at tertiary level in Ireland====
There are third level courses offered in Irish at all universities ([[University College Cork|UCC]], [[Trinity College Dublin|TCD]], [[University College Dublin|UCD]], [[Dublin City University|DCU]], [[University of Limerick|UL]], [[National University of Ireland Maynooth|NUIM]], [[National University of Ireland, Galway|NUIG]], [[University of Ulster|UU]], [[Queen's University of Belfast|QUB]]). Many of these universities also have thriving Irish language departments, such as the [[National University of Ireland|NUI]] constituent universities, UL, UCC, DCU, UCD and TCD.
The national [[Union of Students in Ireland]] has a full-time Irish language officer. Most universities in the Republic have Irish-language officers elected by the students.

University College Cork (UCC) maintains a unique site where old texts of Irish relevance in several languages, including Irish, are available in a scholarly format for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/celt/ |title=CELT: The online resource for Irish history, literature and politics |publisher=Ucc.ie |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Northern Ireland ==&lt;!-- This section is linked from [[Ulster Scots language]] --&gt;
{{Main|Irish language in Northern Ireland}}
[[File:Irish language medium school sign Newry.jpg|thumb|Sign for Irish-medium primary school in [[Newry]]]]
As in the Republic, the Irish language is a [[minority language]] in Northern Ireland, known in Irish as {{lang|ga|Tuaisceart Éireann}}.

There are 36 [[Gaelscoileanna]]; 2 [[Gaelcholáiste|Gaelcholáistí]] and 3 Aonaid Ghaeilge in English-medium Post-Primary Schools in Northern Ireland.

Attitudes towards the language in Northern Ireland have traditionally reflected the political differences between its two divided communities. The language has been regarded with suspicion by [[Unionists (Ireland)|Unionists]], who have associated it with the Roman Catholic-majority Republic, and more recently, with the [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] movement in Northern Ireland itself. Erection of public street signs in Irish were effectively banned under laws by the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]], which stated that only English could be used. Many republicans in Northern Ireland, including [[Sinn Féin]] President [[Gerry Adams]], learned Irish while in prison, a development known as the ''Jailtacht''.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Feldman. ''Formations of Violence: The Narrative of the Body and Political Terror in Northern Ireland.''U of Chicago P, 1991. Chapter 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the language was taught in Catholic secondary schools (especially by the [[Congregation of Christian Brothers|Christian Brothers]]), it was not taught at all in the controlled sector, which is mostly attended by Protestant pupils. Irish-medium schools, however, known as ''[[Gaelscoil]]eanna'', were founded in [[Belfast]] and [[Derry]] and the Gaelscoileanna movement has since expanded to across much of Northern Ireland similar to its expansion in the Republic of Ireland. An Irish-language newspaper called ''Lá'' (later called ''[[Lá Nua]]'') produced by The Andersonstown News Group (later called [[Belfast Media Group]]) was also established in Belfast in 1984 and ran as a daily newspaper between 2003 and 2008. The paper is no longer produced due to a decision by Foras na Gaeilge to cease funding it in late 2008. [[BBC Radio Ulster]] began broadcasting a nightly half-hour programme in Irish in the early 1980s called ''Blas'' ("taste, accent") and [[BBC Northern Ireland]] also showed its first TV programme in the language in the early 1990s. BBC Northern Ireland now have an Irish Language Department in their headquarters in Belfast.

In 2006 [[Raidió Fáilte]] Northern Ireland's first Irish language community radio station started broadcasting to the Greater Belfast Area and is one of only two Irish language community radio stations on the island of Ireland- the other being [[Raidió na Life]] broadcasting in Dublin. In October 2018 the station moved to a state-of-the-art new building on the junction of the Falls Road and the Westlink motorway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://nos.ie/meain/raidio/nil-foirgneamh-raidio-nios-fearr-in-eirinn/ |title= ‘NÍL FOIRGNEAMH RAIDIÓ NÍOS FEARR IN ÉIRINN’ Raidió Fáilte ag craoladh ó stiúideo úrnua- NÓS |accessdate= 10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fye3eEhTiTg |title= Raidió Fáilte in 2018- Raidió na Life &amp; Near FM podcast |accessdate= 10 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Ultach Trust]]'' was established with a view to broadening the appeal of the language among Protestants, although [[Democratic Unionist Party|DUP]] politicians like [[Sammy Wilson (politician)|Sammy Wilson]] ridiculed it as a "[[leprechaun]] language".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

[[Ulster Scots dialects|Ulster Scots]], promoted by some [[Ulster loyalism|loyalists]], was, in turn, ridiculed by nationalists and even some [[Unionism (Ireland)|Unionists]] as "a [[Do it yourself|DIY]] language for [[Orange Institution|Orangemen]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Irish received official recognition in Northern Ireland for the first time in 1998 under the [[Belfast Agreement|Good Friday Agreement]]'s provisions on "parity of esteem". A cross-border body known as ''[[Foras na Gaeilge]]'' was established to promote the language in both Northern Ireland and the Republic, taking over the functions of the previous Republic-only {{lang|ga|Bord na Gaeilge}}. The Agreement (and subsequent implementation measures and memoranda) also contained specific provisions regarding the availability of the Irish language television service [[TG4]] signal in Northern Ireland. In 2001, the British government ratified the [[European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages]] in respect to Irish in Northern Ireland. In March 2005, TG4 began broadcasting from the Divis transmitter near Belfast, as a result of an agreement between the [[Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (Ireland)|Department of Foreign Affairs]] in the Republic of Ireland and the UK [[Northern Ireland Office]]. Following Digital Switchover for terrestrial television transmissions in both parts of Ireland in 2012,  TG4  is now carried on Freeview HD for viewers in Northern Ireland (channel 51) as well as to those households in Border areas that have spillover reception of the ROI Saorview platform (channel 104).  TG4 also continues to be  available on other TV delivery platforms across Northern Ireland: Sky (channel 163)  and Virgin Cable customers in Belfast  (channel 877).

[[File:Ascaill Naomh Pádraigcrop.jpeg|thumb|Bilingual (Irish/English) street sign in Newry, [[Co. Down]].]]
[[Belfast City Council]] has designated the Falls Road area (from Milltown Cemetery to Divis Street) as the [[Gaeltacht Quarter]] of Belfast, one of the four cultural quarters of the city. There are a growing number of Irish-medium schools throughout Northern Ireland (e.g. see photo above). [[Forbairt Feirste]] work with the business sector across Belfast to promote the Irish language in the business sector and have been very successful in Nationalist areas.

In February 2018 Foras na Gaeilge announced that Belfast and Carn Tóchair in Derry are going to be designated as being two of the first formal ''Líonraí Gaeilge'' (Irish Language Networks) outside the Gaeltacht. The other areas to be designated as the first formal Líonraí Gaeilge are Loughrea, Ennis and Clondalkin.

Under the [[St Andrews Agreement]], the UK Government committed to introduce an Irish Language Act. Although a consultation document on the matter was published in 2007, the restoration of devolved government by the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]] later that year meant that responsibility for language transferred from London to Belfast. In October 2007, the then [[Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure|Minister of Culture, Arts and Leisure]], [[Edwin Poots|Edwin Poots MLA]] announced to the Assembly that he did not intend to bring forward an Irish language Bill. The debate over a proposed ''Acht na Gaeilge'' or Irish Language Act has been a central bone of contention between Sinn Féin and the DUP since early 2017 in their efforts to reestablish the Northern Ireland Executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-38601181

Irish speakers in Northern Ireland are represented by [[POBAL]] who are the umbrella organisation for the [[Irish Language movement|Irish language movement]] in Northern Ireland. POBAL work closely with other Irish language organisations across the island of Ireland. They share the same name with a Republic of Ireland State company but are a separate organisation.

==Outside Ireland==
{{Main|Irish language outside Ireland}}

Irish is no longer used as a community language outside Ireland, but has retained a certain status abroad as an academic subject. It is also used as a vehicle of journalism and literature. A small number of activists teach and promote the language in countries to which large numbers of Irish have migrated.

Irish is taught as a degree subject in a number of tertiary institutions in North America and northern Europe, and at the [[University of Sydney]] in Australia. The [[University of Auckland]] in New Zealand teaches it as an extension course.

The organisation Coláiste na nGael&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colaiste-na-ngael.com/ |title=Irish language in Britain and London |publisher=Colaiste-na-ngael.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; plays a major part in fostering the Irish language in Britain. North America has several groups and organisations devoted to the language. Among these are [[Daltaí na Gaeilge]] and the [[North American Gaeltacht]]. In the Antipodes the main body is the Irish Language Association of Australia, based in Melbourne.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaeilgesanastrail.com/ |accessdate=3 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711062635/http://www.gaeilgesanastrail.com/ |archivedate=11 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The websites maintained by these groups are supplemented by a number of sites and blogs maintained by individuals.

Irish-language publications outside Ireland include two online publications: a quarterly American-based journal called ''An Gael'',&lt;ref name="angaelmagazine1"/&gt; and a fortnightly newsletter from Australia called ''An Lúibín''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaeilgesanastrail.com/ |title=Cumann Gaeilge na hAstráile |publisher=Gaeilgesanastrail.com |date= |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Irish at tertiary level internationally ===
In 2009 the Irish government announced funding for third-level institutions abroad who offer or wish to offer Irish language courses. There are thirty such universities where the Irish language is taught to students. Furthermore, scholarships for international studies in the Irish language can be attained by the [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright Commission]] and Ireland Canada University Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icuf.ie/ |title=Ireland Canada University Foundation |publisher=Icuf.ie |date=2013-10-17 |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaeilge.ie/The_Irish_Language/The_Irish_Language_Abroad.asp |accessdate=6 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131113065345/http://www.gaeilge.ie/The_Irish_Language/The_Irish_Language_Abroad.asp |archivedate=13 November 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On St. Patrick's Day 2014 the language learning app [[Duolingo]] announced the release of its new Irish language learning course. As of April 2018 the course had been downloaded by 4.27 million users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.duolingo.com/register |title= Duolingo website register}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://twitter.com/duolingo/status/975041989078147075 |title= Tweet by Duolingo on St. Patricks Day 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data from 2016 showed 53% of learners were from the U.S; 23% were from Ireland; 10% were from the U.K and 5% were from Canada.&lt;ref name.&lt;ref name="irishtimes"&gt;{{cite news|title=Ar fheabhas!

In 2016 Irish President Michael D.

'''''Sunset Overdrive''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[third-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Insomniac Games]] and published by [[Microsoft Studios]]. It was announced at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2013]], and released worldwide for Xbox One in October 2014 and for Microsoft Windows in November 2018. The game is set in 2027, in a fictional [[metropolis]] called Sunset City. The player controls an employee of FizzCo, who has to fight off the OD, short for Overcharge Drinkers: humans who have turned into mutants after drinking FizzCo's energy drink beverage. In the dystopian Sunset City the player character can wall-run, use [[zip-line]]s, and [[grind rail]]s to swiftly navigate through it, with a large arsenal of weapons to use. The game also has a [[cooperative multiplayer]] mode called ''Chaos Squad'', which tasks players to complete a series of missions with seven players. As the game puts emphasis on momentum, the game does not feature any cover system.

The development of the game began in 2010 when Insomniac completed ''[[Resistance 3]].'' After the project was green-lit internally, the studio partnered with Microsoft Studios, which helped fund the game and allowed Insomniac to keep the rights to the franchise. Insomniac described the game as a "celebration of games", as the team took inspiration from different sources, including ''[[Prince of Persia]]'', ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'' and ''[[Tony Hawk's Pro Skater]]'', though at its early stage of development the team took inspirations from ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]'' instead. The game is set in a post-apocalyptic future, but the team depicted it as an "awesomepocalypse" that turns the game's initial world depiction into a "playground" for players. ''Sunset Overdrive'' is powered by Insomniac's internal engine, previously used in ''[[Fuse (video game)|Fuse]]'', one of their previous games.

The game received generally positive reviews, with praise for its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, the game was criticized for the lack of a compelling story or innovative quest design. It received numerous nominations, including Best Xbox Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. The game was supported with multiple [[downloadable content]], including the story-based ''The Mystery of the Mooil Rig'' and ''Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine'', after the game's release.

== Plot ==
On July 13, 2027, FizzCo releases its new energy drink, OverCharge Delirium XT (also known as OCD), exclusively in Sunset City. In an attempt to sell OCD faster, FizzCo skipped health regulation protocols, leading to the drink being so toxic that anyone who drinks it transforms into a violent, [[boil]]-covered mutant known as an Overcharge Drinker (OD). In order to cover up the deception, FizzCo claims that a viral outbreak has  happened and quarantines the whole city, preventing anyone from entering or exiting. The player, a FizzCo employee who works in the sanitation division, is saved from an attacking OD by Walter, a fellow survivor; the player is unaffected by the drink, as they were not allowed to attend the launch party for OCD, later referred to as "Horror Night".

Upon learning that Walter is creating a plane to escape the quarantine, the player obtains the aid of Sam and the Oxfords, a group of rich but lazy geniuses. After multiple errands, the Oxfords build a propeller to complete the plane. The player joins Walter in his plane to escape the city and reveal the truth about the outbreak. At the last second, Walter notices an [[invisible wall]] preventing their escape and pushes the player out of the plane before dying in the subsequent crash.

Still planning to escape, the player aids Troop Bushido, [[Scouting|scouts]] living in a [[samurai]] museum, and the Fargarths, a group of [[Live action role-playing game|larpers]]. In thanks, the two groups design and build a ship out of garbage which tricks the FizzCo sensors and allow them past. As the player is about to escape, they learn that FizzCo robots are attacking the Oxfords and Troop Bushido in order to kill all witnesses. The player returns to Sunset City and rescues the survivors. Sam informs the player that there is a deadly superweapon in FizzCo headquarters, which the player is able to break into after obtaining the help of Las Catrinas, a trio of [[La Calavera Catrina|skeleton]]-themed [[Mexican Americans|Mexican American]] cheerleaders caring for the children's ward of a hospital, by recruiting a band fronted by [[King Buzzo]] (voiced and [[mocap]]ped by the real [[Melvins]] singer)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://paulsemel.com/exclusive-interview-sunset-overdrive-guest-star-melvins-singerguitarist-buzz-osborne/ |title=Exclusive Interview: Sunset Overdrive Guest Star (And Melvins Singer/Guitarist) Buzz Osborne |last1=Semel |first1=Paul |date=November 10, 2014 |website=paulsemel.com |publisher= |access-date=May 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; to perform for the children.

The player rallies the four factions to attack FizzCo headquarters, and attempts to destroy FizzCo HQ by riding a giant bottle of OCD into it (reminiscent of [[Dr. Strangelove]]). The player is killed in the blast, and the factions mourn them. However, the player stops the credits rolling after this scene to complain how depressing the ending is, and decides to change it. The player survives in this ending, and it is revealed that the FizzCo building is a robot that is meant to destroy the city to cover up the OCD outbreak. The player destroys the robot and has milk and crackers with the other survivors. After the credits, however, computers in the FizzCo headquarters automatically activate a protocol sending FizzCo helicopters full of OCD around the world.

==Development==

===Origin===
''Sunset Overdrive'' was developed by Insomniac Games, which had mainly developed games for [[PlayStation|PlayStation consoles]]. Drew Murray and Marcus Smith, the game's creative directors, began brainstorming ''Sunset Overdrive'' after the completion of ''Resistance 3'' in 2011. They presented their ideas to Insomniac's owners and CEO [[Ted Price]], outlining a project that would borrow influences from the documentary ''Hyena Men of Kenya'', ''[[Tank Girl]]'' comics, the novel ''[[I Am Legend (novel)|I Am Legend]]'', the British television series ''[[The Young Ones (TV series)|The Young Ones]]'', Halloween masks from the 1960s, and [[Lego]]. The initial presentation failed to generate interest, but Murray and Smith were asked to come back a week later to explain how the game would actually be played. In their second presentation, they explained their vision of a game featuring fast-paced action that would be "the rock and roll end times". According to Smith this confused some team members who thought that they were making ''[[Brütal Legend]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN XB1 interview"/&gt;

The team received approval after their second presentation. After ''Sunset Overdrive'' was green-lit internally, Insomniac had to pitch it to a number of publishers. Insomniac wanted to retain brand ownership, causing some firms to opt out of publishing it. Murray and Smith traveled to Microsoft Studios a number of times to pitch the game to them. The main pitch began with the playing of "[[Kick Out the Jams (song)|Kick Out the Jams]]" by [[MC5]], and ended with Murray: "...on top of a chair, mimicking how the game was going to play, and the last minute heroics." Microsoft was eager to work with Insomniac and agreed to fund and publish the game.&lt;ref name="IGN XB1 interview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/09/how-sunset-overdrive-became-an-xbox-one-exclusive |title=How Sunset Overdrive Became an Xbox One Exclusive |date=May 9, 2014 |last=Moriarty |first=Colin |publisher=[[Ziff Davis]] |work=[[IGN]] |accessdate=May 11, 2014 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIHXRkC?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/09/how-sunset-overdrive-became-an-xbox-one-exclusive |archivedate=November 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The team originally did not want to make it a console exclusive, but they were impressed by Microsoft's philosophy toward the development of Xbox One, and the capabilities of [[Xbox Live]] features, which allow the initiation of a "two-way dialogue" with players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/xboxone/sunset_overdrive/news/insomniac_explains_reasons_behind_sunset_overdrives_xbox_one-exclusivity.html|title=Insomniac explains reasons behind Sunset Overdrive's Xbox One-exclusivity|first=James|last=Orry|work=VideoGamer.com|date=June 17, 2013|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130915214024/http://www.videogamer.com/xboxone/sunset_overdrive/news/insomniac_explains_reasons_behind_sunset_overdrives_xbox_one-exclusivity.html|archivedate=September 15, 2013|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===
Choosing a name for the game was the first thing the team did before starting development. They decided on the name ''Sunset Overdrive'' because they felt it was unique, and captured the feeling of the "grindhouse" from the 1970s.&lt;ref name="Sunsetname"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-08-sunset-overdrive-was-originally-the-insomniac-version-of-dayz|title=Sunset Overdrive was originally "the Insomniac version of DayZ"|first=Stace|last=Harman|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuITuush?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-08-sunset-overdrive-was-originally-the-insomniac-version-of-dayz|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was originally conceived as an open world&lt;ref name="TPInt"/&gt; [[survival game]] similar to ''[[DayZ (mod)|DayZ]]''. The initial version of the game did not feature the traversal system, nor the unusual weapons included in the final version, and was described as "grounded" by Murray. In this version, players were tasked with scavenging resources during daytime, and defending their base at night. This later evolved to become the game's cooperative multiplayer mode. It employed the animation model from Insomniac's previous game, ''Fuse''. The direction of the game changed after the team watched a video based on [[Gorillaz]], and Murray gave up the idea of a realistic survival game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/how-a-gorillaz-video-and-jet-set-radio-inspired-su/2300-6418874/|title=How a Gorillaz Video and Jet Set Radio Inspired Sunset Overdrive|first=Aaron|last=Sampson|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=May 20, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIOVqWR?url=http://www.gamespot.com/videos/how-a-gorillaz-video-and-jet-set-radio-inspired-su/2300-6418874/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then asked the team to start prototyping ideas for a game that they thought would work. Some team members came up with the idea of having skateboarding elements in the game, which led the development team to start working and experimenting with a new traversal system. In hindsight, Murray described the shift in focus as an "organic, evolutionary process".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/16/sunset-overdrive-was-originally-the-insomniac-version-of-dayz|title=Sunset Overdrive Was Originally The Insomniac Version Of DayZ|first=Mitch|last=Dyer|work=[[IGN]]|date=September 16, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIUY8Tq?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/16/sunset-overdrive-was-originally-the-insomniac-version-of-dayz|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the game's development progressed, the team began to draw on elements from other video game franchises such as ''[[Prince of Persia]]'', ''[[Jet Set Radio]]'', and ''Tony Hawk's Pro Skater'',&lt;ref name="Polyf"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/8/5692070/sunset-overdrive-xbox-one-insomniac-games|title=Sunset Overdrive turns the post-apocalypse into an energy drink-fueled party|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIY27v7?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/8/5692070/sunset-overdrive-xbox-one-insomniac-games|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and put the emphasis on momentum.&lt;ref name="momentum"/&gt;

In 2013, the team had released ''Fuse'', which was a critical and commercial failure. The team now reflected on the reasons for its poor reception, and felt that they should go back to Insomniac's roots — developing unusual titles with vibrant visuals — instead of another dark shooter like ''Fuse''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/8/5684982/sunset-overdrive-fuse-insomniac-games|title=How Insomniac learned from Fuse and got its groove back with Sunset Overdrive|first=Michael|last=McWhertor|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIZ3jA9?url=http://www.polygon.com/2014/5/8/5684982/sunset-overdrive-fuse-insomniac-games|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also thought that ''Sunset Overdrive'''s stylization should reflect the personality of the company, and that building a world that has a sense of humor and irreverence was something the team was eager to do.&lt;ref name="Polygon: turns a city"/&gt; [[Ted Price]], CEO of Insomniac Games, described it as a game Insomniac had wanted to develop for a long time. The game's producer, Bryan Intihar, called it: "...the game [they've] been meaning to make for 20 years."&lt;ref name="Polyf"/&gt; Microsoft supported it and shared the same vision and the idea of creating something new.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/11/10/insomniacs-ted-price-on-sunset-overdrive-working-with-microsoft-and-more/|title=Insomniac's Ted Price on Sunset Overdrive, working with Microsoft, and more|first=Jeff|last=Grubb|work=[[VentureBeat]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIbPVsw?url=http://venturebeat.com/2014/11/10/insomniacs-ted-price-on-sunset-overdrive-working-with-microsoft-and-more/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Price, Insomniac wanted to "break the rules of shooters". He felt that the [[History of video game consoles (seventh generation)|last generation]] of shooters had established a formula of staying behind cover for defense, and leaning out from it to attack. He wanted to change that pattern with ''Sunset Overdrive''&lt;ref name="GIInterview1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sunset_overdrive/b/xboxone/archive/2014/05/08/insomniac-s-ted-price-talks-open-world-lessons-learned-from-fuse.aspx|title=Insomniac’s Ted Price Talks Open World, Lessons Learned From Fuse|first=Tim|last=Turi|work=[[Game Informer]]|date=May 8, 2014|accessdate=October 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIdVOZ8?url=http://www.gameinformer.com/games/sunset_overdrive/b/xboxone/archive/2014/05/08/insomniac-s-ted-price-talks-open-world-lessons-learned-from-fuse.aspx|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by encouraging players to attack in an aggressive manner and to focus on momentum. To accomplish this, the team developed a city that supported parkour and fast movements.&lt;ref name="breaking rules"/&gt; They also hoped that with the introduction of a [[History of video game consoles (eighth generation)|new generation]] of video game consoles, they could establish a new standard for the genre which would "retrain" shooter fans playing the game.&lt;ref name="TPInt"/&gt;

Smith compared ''Sunset Overdrive''{{'}}s gameplay to [[pinball games]], where a player's every movement has consequences, and the on-screen chaos created by players is based on their actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-sunset-overdrive-is-like-pinball/1100-6422689/|title=How Sunset Overdrive Is Like Pinball|first=Daniel|last=Hindes|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 2, 2012|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIf91B7?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-sunset-overdrive-is-like-pinball/1100-6422689/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's combat and traversal elements were originally separate from each other, but were later connected as the team began to think that: "shooting while grinding was fun". The combination of these aspects led the studio to adjust the game's world design. The team calculated how the city should be designed so that it could support both combat and traversal. As a result, they ensured that the world was built in modular 4x4 blocks, and that no surface featured an angle that was between 26 and 45 degrees. Furthermore, the team considered how long grinds should be, and decided that they should be at least 8 meters in length. The grinds were designed to be longer than usual in enemy-concentrated areas so as to allow additional time for players to consider both combat and traversal options. In order to encourage experimentation, the game features a vertical map-design, in which the difficulty the enemies' players face increases as they move towards higher ground.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-08-insomniacs-sunset-overdrive-is-a-shooter-that-plays-like-jet-set-radio|title=How Insomniac's Sunset Overdrive mixes gunplay with rail-grinds|first=Stace|last=Harman|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=May 8, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuImlDD9?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-05-08-insomniacs-sunset-overdrive-is-a-shooter-that-plays-like-jet-set-radio|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insomniac described the game as "a celebration of games", in which the team pushed existing concepts in a new direction.&lt;ref name="noone"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sunset-overdrive-dev-says-no-one-has-ever-made-a-g/1100-6422576/|title=Sunset Overdrive Dev Says No One Has Ever Made a Game Like This|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=September 26, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuInl0hN?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/sunset-overdrive-dev-says-no-one-has-ever-made-a-g/1100-6422576/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides drawing influences from ''Prince of Persia'', ''Tony Hawk's Pro Skater'' and ''Jet Set Radio'' series of games for the game's traversal system, they drew influences from ''[[Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Adventure]]'' for their "Next-Gen Respawn" system, ''[[Scott Pilgrim]]'' and ''[[The Omega Man]]''&lt;ref name="IBT"/&gt; for the game's setting, and ''[[Peggle]]'' when they were creating the game's weaponry. The game's humor was inspired by Insomniac's own game series ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank]]'' and ''[[Spyro the Dragon (series)|Spyro the Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name="Polygon: turns a city"/&gt; There are also references to other pop culture icons such as ''[[Breaking Bad]]'' and ''[[Portal (video game series)|Portal]]''. Despite that, Smith said that the game would be completely different from ''[[The Last of Us]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-exclusive-sunset-overdrive-is-the-opposit/1100-6422690/|title=Xbox One Exclusive Sunset Overdrive is "The Opposite of The Last of Us" says Insomniac|first=Daniel|last=Hines|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=October 2, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuIqlHiR?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-one-exclusive-sunset-overdrive-is-the-opposit/1100-6422690/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game's character creator function allowed players to create different kinds of combinations in an [[Avatar (computing)|avatar]]. The team ensured that there were many customization options, including allowing players to "dress like a crazy person". The developers felt that this feature would suit the story, because the game's city enters a state of anarchy, where [[social norms]] no longer exist.&lt;ref name="USG"/&gt; The team wanted the character creator to feature diversity, so that players could build an avatar based on their own choices. They found the process of introducing diversity challenging. As a result, a system was developed that broke the character creator down into three different categories: mainstream, street (emo and goth), and costume. The team originally added [[role-playing games]]-styled stats to the game's costumes, but later decided to scrap that so that players "would just choose what they thought looked cool."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/25/sdcc-14-the-cool-character-customization-of-sunset-overdrive|title=SDCC 14: The Cool Character Customization Of Sunset Overdrive|first=Evan|last=Campbell|work=[[IGN]]|date=July 25, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuJBz5vi?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/07/25/sdcc-14-the-cool-character-customization-of-sunset-overdrive|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also wanted it to represent the game's characteristics: "intensity", "fun in the end times" in a "dynamic and vibrant world". There were three different iterations of the cover art, with major changes made to the game's protagonist throughout its development, as the studio struggled with the protagonist's portrayal.

Price called ''Sunset Overdrive'' the biggest game the studio had worked on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/sunset-overdrive-dev-its-the-biggest-game-weve-ever-made|title=Sunset Overdrive Dev: 'It's The Biggest Game We've Ever Made'|first=Luke|last=Karmali|work=[[IGN]]|date=September 25, 2014|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuJJFfHF?url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/25/sunset-overdrive-dev-its-the-biggest-game-weve-ever-made|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As it was the first open world game developed by Insomniac they had to deploy new design and development skills to produce it. The time and resources needed to develop the game also expanded significantly.&lt;ref name="TPInt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-28-sunset-overdrive-the-ted-price-interview|title=Sunset Overdrive: the Ted Price interview|first=Wesley|last=Yin-Poole|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=September 28, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuJN08Pi?url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-09-28-sunset-overdrive-the-ted-price-interview|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; While developing the game's world, the team broke it down into 10 to 11 hexes and zones. They are classified into three different types: low resolution zones, shadow zones, and mission zones, and they overlap each other so that they can keep all zones loaded at the same time. Sunset City had three different iterations. In the early stages, it was called Greenlight City, based on [[Burbank, California]]. This version of the city featured interior structures that could be explored by players, and existed when the game's core concept revolved around "scavenge, craft, defend". This city was replaced with "Razor City" when skateboarding, which later became oil slicks and trampolines, was introduced to the game. Razor City was "Neo-Tokyo"-styled, but was later replaced by Sunset City which was more organized. While designing the game's [[artificial intelligence]], the team thought that the game's enemies must force players to use the traversal system while simultaneously engaging in combat with them. Because of the game's vertical design, the enemies were designed to adopt the game's vertical map-design. The team also developed a “nav position tracker”, which programmed these enemies to detect the location of players and find an ambush point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/244865/How_Insomniac_squeezed_lastgen_tech_to_build_the_openworld_Sunset_Overdrive.php|title=How Insomniac squeezed last-gen tech to build the open-world Sunset Overdrive|first=Bryant|last=Francis|work=[[Gamasutra]]|date=June 3, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuJOyay5?url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/244865/How_Insomniac_squeezed_lastgen_tech_to_build_the_openworld_Sunset_Overdrive.php|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, this idea was dropped as being confusing and overly-chaotic. The team wanted to achieve a "high energy vibe" for this title and the resulting soundtrack features a lot of [[punk rock]] and [[electronic dance music]]. Fourteen different bands and artists were hired to perform the music often avoiding using [[musical instruments]] and writing lyrics for the game instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sunset-overdrive-soundtrack-arrives-tomorrow-h/1100-6424366/|title=New Sunset Overdrive Soundtrack Arrives Tomorrow, Hear Some Tracks Now|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=December 22, 2014|accessdate=October 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuJlCZeF?url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-sunset-overdrive-soundtrack-arrives-tomorrow-h/1100-6424366/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game's soundtrack was also inspired by works from [[FIDLAR]], [[DZ Deathrays]] and [[Ty Segall]].&lt;ref name="dynamic sound"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/decoding-the-secret-sauce-in-sunset-overdrives-soundtrack/|title=Kick Out The Jams, MOFOS: Secrets of Sunset Overdrive's Punktastic Soundtrack|first=Mike|last=Mettler|work=iDigitalTimes|date=November 7, 2014|accessdate=October 2, 2015|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6cuJmwPGy?url=http://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/decoding-the-secret-sauce-in-sunset-overdrives-soundtrack/|archivedate=November 9, 2015|deadurl=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Sunset Overdrive'' received positive reviews. It received aggregated scores of 83% from [[GameRankings]] based on 63 reviews&lt;ref name="GR"/&gt; and 81/100 from [[Metacritic]] based on 89 reviews.&lt;ref name="MC"/&gt;

The game's tone was praised by reviewers. Daniel Bischoff from [[Game Revolution]] praised the game's comedic elements describing them as "contemporary". He added that the game is one of the rare few that made him laugh while playing.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; Sam Prell from [[Joystiq]] appreciated the humor, and thought that its quality was boosted by the performance of the voice-actors. His opinion was echoed by Peter Brown from [[GameSpot]], who found the voice acting in the game entertaining and believable.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; However, Prell considered some humorous moments "hit-or-miss".&lt;ref name="JoystiqRev"/&gt; Andrew Reiner from ''[[Game Informer]]'' described the game as a "full circle", in which Insomniac has incorporated all the elements from their previous game into this one. As a result, he thought that while the story emphasized comedy, it successfully reflected some pressing issues existing in society.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Mollie L Patterson from ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' appreciated the game's humor, but noted that it would not be able to satisfy every type of player.&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt; Arthur Gies from ''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'' described the story as "gleefully stupid", and commended the self-aware narrative.&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt; Chris Carter from [[Destructoid]] praised the jokes featured in the game. However, he disliked the story, which he thought failed to offer motivation for players to complete the game.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt;

''Sunset Overdrive''{{'}}s gameplay was also commended by many reviewers. Prell compared the game favorably to ''[[Jet Grind Radio]]'', ''[[Saints Row The Third]]'', ''[[Infamous (video game)|Infamous]]'', and ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank]]''. He singled out the traversal system, which he thought was fluid and well-executed. He added that the fast travel system was not useful in this game, since players can find a lot of fun by simply traveling between different locations in the game's world. He thought that all of the game's systems intertwined with each other, and ultimately made the game a complete and worthwhile experience.&lt;ref name="JoystiqRev"/&gt; Reiner echoed similar thoughts, and considered getting around ''Sunset City'' fun for players. He added that the traversal system increased the game's replay value. However, he was disappointed by the game's occasionally repetitive mission design.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Sliva and Brown shared similar thoughts, with the latter saying that the game featured too many fetch quests.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt;&lt;ref name="IGN Rev"/&gt; Patterson disliked the game's traversal; he found that the system was frustrating at times. However, he thought that this problem  lessened as players unlocked new moves and skills.&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt; Gies felt overwhelmed by the traversal options. He added that Insomniac had successfully created a system that was accessible for ordinary players, while creating challenges for those who want to master the system. However, he noted the camera system may not able to track the movement of the character accurately. He further commended the game's world design, and described it as one of the most "navigationally sophisticated" worlds he had ever experienced in a game.&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt;  Bischoff considered the shooting mechanic "loose", but thought that the problem was overshadowed by the game's forgiving aiming and steady difficulty curve.&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; Lucas Sullivan also criticized the mechanic, calling it "inconsistent".&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt;

The customization options received acclaim. Bischoff praised the arsenal of weapons featured in the game, which he thought was deep, interesting, and creative, benefited by the Amps system, which added additional complexity to them. Prell described it as the "king" of the game. He praised the game's ability to allow players to customize their characters, and considered the weapons featured "varied", and thought they enhanced the game with personality.&lt;ref name="JoystiqRev"/&gt; Reiner thought that all of the weapons featured in the game were fun to use, and that the amps system made experimenting with different weapons rewarding.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Patterson also commended the game's weapons though he was initially skeptical about them.&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt; Gies thought that the customization options allowed players to play the game as they preferred, and described the character creator as "flexible".&lt;ref name="PolyRev"/&gt; Marty Sliva from [[IGN]] praised the Amp upgrade system, which he felt encouraged players to try out unusual ways to experiment with it.&lt;ref name="IGN Rev"/&gt;

The game's art style was applauded. Bischoff praised the colorful graphics and the different graphical effects featured in the game. He further praised the game's presentation, which he thought would lead "the Xbox One console’s personality this generation."&lt;ref name="GameRev"/&gt; Reiner compared the colorful graphics of the game to ''[[Sesame Street]]'', and thought the bright colors "[electrified] the screen". Reiner also praised the "Next-Gen Respawn" system, and the protagonist's animation.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Sliva praised the design of the city, as he thought it featured a unique artistic style, and aided the traversal system. He added that the game's visuals "pop", and compared them to the "Easter Bunny on an acid trip".&lt;ref name="IGN Rev"/&gt; Carter praised the variety existing within the game's world, which he considered has prevented the game's world from being repetitive, and made landmarks easily recognizable.&lt;ref name="Destruct"/&gt; Brown thought that the game did not look realistic, but felt this did not stop the game from being one of the best-looking games available for the console.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt; Sullivan also praised the use of colors, which he found was organic and vibrant.&lt;ref name="GRadarRev"/&gt; 

The game's multiplayer received mixed reviews. Prell thought that the mission-design was varied, and the voting system kept the mode from being repetitive. He also praised the interconnected structure between the single-player and multiplayer, noting that the items that could be carried over from multiplayer to campaign made the mode feel rewarding for players. Reiner thought that the action featured in this mode is satisfying, but thought that the system lacked enough depth and complexity to engage players.&lt;ref name="GIRev"/&gt; Patterson echoed similar thoughts, and felt that the ability of players to switch between the campaign and the Chaos Squad mode made the multiplayer mode a rewarding experience.&lt;ref name="EGMRev"/&gt; Brown criticized the mode, saying that its difficulty was not properly scaled.&lt;ref name="GSpotRev"/&gt;

The game was the second best-selling game in the UK on its release, and was outsold by ''[[FIFA 15]]''. In its second week of release, it was the eighth best-selling game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.engadget.com/2014/11/10/uk-charts-cod-advanced-warfare-finally-fishes-out-fifa/|title=UK Charts: CoD Advanced Warfare dethrones FIFA|first=Sinan|last=Kubba|work=[[Engadget]]|date=November 10, 2014|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2014-11-03-sunset-overdrive-debuts-second-in-uk-chart|title=Sunset Overdrive debuts second in UK chart|first=Tom|last=Phillips|work=[[Eurogamer]]|date=November 3, 2016|accessdate=April 11, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Talehunt''' is a community that allows people to write, read, and post very [[short stories]]. It is available as a [[mobile app]] (the TaleHunt App) on both Android and iPhone mobile platforms. In Talehunt, any user can create an account and post [[Narrative|stories]], [[fan fiction]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://creativepathwaysfiction.blogspot.in/2015/10/tale-hunt-microfiction-under-250.html|title=Tale Hunt: Microfiction under 250 characters|last=Bennett|first=E.R.G.|date=2015-11-06|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Poetry|poems]], which are under 250 characters in length.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://daily-iowan.com/2016/02/01/few-characters-but-characters/|title=FEW CHARACTERS, BUT CHARACTERS |last=Flair|first=Justus|date=2016-02-01|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows anyone to write very short "tales" (also known as Stories) and build a fanbase of followers, giving people the chance to have their creative works available to a wider audience. This will also help new and upcoming writers to get an audience for their creative writing.&lt;ref name=Reese&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailyuw.com/arts_and_leisure/article_bb5d4a78-ca31-11e5-96d6-f3810282f36e.html|title=TaleHunt App to promote very short stories|last=Reese|first=Madelyn|date=2016-02-03|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://englishinlife.wordpress.com/2015/11/06/can-you-write-a-story-with-250-characters/|title=CAN YOU WRITE A STORY WITH 250 CHARACTERS? |last=Saglam|first=Ridvan|date=2015-11-06|work=Publishers Weekly}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone who likes to read microstories can follow good writers in Talehunt to view all their upcoming stories. Tales in Talehunt may include that of undiscovered writers, published writers, new writers, and aspiring writers. Around 55% of Talehunt users are from the United States, and the rest are from various parts of the world, including Europe and Asia.

== History ==
The early beta version of Talehunt was available by the end of 2015. The app was officially released January 2016.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;

== Design ==
The app has a minimalist design which is simple&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://issuu.com/underthefable/docs/final_copy_-/25?e=17481284/31672631|title=Test Driving the App|last=Ward|first=Adam|date=2015-11-01|work=Publishers Monthly}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is reflected in its logo: a quill and a scribble on a dark green background.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt; The dark green theme is intended to make the TaleHunt App user-friendly and pleasant to read. Once in the app, even before logging in, the user can immediately read other users' short stories and follow the writer if the user liked the tale. Once followed, all stories will show up in the personal timeline, which is customized for each user based on the people he or she follows. Each author also has their own page, which includes their username, profile photo, follow button, number of followers, number of users followed, and a feed of all of the author's stories.&lt;ref name=Reese/&gt;

{{Anthropology}}
'''Transpersonal anthropology''' is a subdiscipline of [[cultural anthropology]] and [[transpersonal studies]]. It studies the relationship between [[altered states of consciousness]] and [[culture]].

==Definition and context==
According to Walsh and Vaughan,&lt;ref name="Walsh &amp; Vaughan 1993"&gt;Walsh, R. and F. Vaughan. On transpersonal definitions. ''Journal of Transpersonal Psvchology'', 25:199-207, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; who proposed several definitions of the transpersonal field in the early 1990’s, «Transpersonal anthropology is the cross-cultural study of transpersonal phenomena and the relationship between consciousness and culture.» Charles Laughlin,&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"&gt; Laughlin, C. D. (2013). The ethno-epistemology of transpersonal experience: The view from transpersonal anthropology. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 32(1), 43–50.&lt;/ref&gt; a founder of the field of Transpersonal anthropology, has defined the discipline as «the cross-cultural study of transpersonal experiences, including the sociocultural evocation, interpretation, and utility of transpersonal experiences, and their involvement in defining social roles».

As with [[transpersonal psychology]], the field is much concerned with altered states of consciousness (ASC) and [[transpersonal experience]]. However, the field differs from mainstream transpersonal psychology in taking more cognizance of cross-cultural issues—for instance, the roles of [[Mythology|myth]], [[ritual]], [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], and [[Literature|texts]] in evoking and interpreting extraordinary experiences.&lt;ref name="Young &amp; Goulet 1994"&gt;Young, David E. and J.-G. Goulet (1994) ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences''. Peterborough: Broadview Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"&gt; Sheppard, E. (2006) "Our worlds beyond." ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 10 ,(1):63-70. &lt;/ref&gt; has noted how transpersonal anthropology can be said to have begun in the USA in the 1970s. By the mid-eighties the discipline was described as a «young and growing field» by commentators.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"&gt; Valle, Ronald S. &amp; Harari, Carmi. Current developments in...Transpersonal Psychology. ''The Humanistic Psychologist'' 11, Vol. 13, NO. 1, Winter 1985&lt;/ref&gt; There was, by this time, also a development at the organizational level, in the form of the ''Association of Transpersonal Anthropology'', with  its supporting publication, the ''Phoenix''.&lt;ref name="Valle &amp; Harari 1985"/&gt; According to Hunter,&lt;ref name="Hunter 2015"&gt; Hunter, Jack. "Between Realness and Unrealness": Anthropology, Parapsychology and the Ontology of Non-Ordinary Realities. ''DISKUS'' 17.2 (2015), 4-20 (The Journal of the British Association for the Study of Religions)&lt;/ref&gt; the parallel field of [[Anthropology of Consciousness]] grew out of the transpersonal perspective, including Transpersonal anthropology.

Central to the development of the field has been the work of anthropologist [[Charles D. Laughlin]], who is considered to be one of the primary founders of the discipline.&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "&gt; Hartelius, Glenn. The Imperative for Diversity in a Transpersonal Psychology of the Whole Person. ''International Journal of Transpersonal Studies'', 33(2), 2014, pp. iii-iv&lt;/ref&gt; However, Shepard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; also notes the contributions of Ihsan Al-Issa, &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"&gt;Al-Issa, Ihsan . (1995). "The Illusion of Reality and Reality of Illusion." ''[[British Journal of Psychiatry]]'' 166 (3)368-373.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Edith Turner (anthropology)|Edith Turner]],&lt;ref name="Turner 1996"&gt;Turner, Edith (1996) ''The Hands Feel It: Healing and Spirit Presence Among a Northern Alaskan People''. DeKalb, IL: Northern Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; wife of the anthropologist  [[Victor Turner]].

==Contributions to academic theory==
One of the  contributions of Laughlin to anthropological theory is a differentiation between so-called monophasic and polyphasic cultures. According to this theory polyphasic cultures are open to altered states of consciousness, and tries to integrate these experiences into their worldview, while monophasic cultures, typical  of technocratical societies, are largely closed to these alternative states of mind.&lt;ref name="Laughlin 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hartelius 2014 "/&gt; Laughlin has published extensively on the topic of Transpersonal anthropology, and has addresses several issues within the field, including methodology.&lt;ref name="Laughlin MacManus Shearer 1983"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D., McManus, John and Shearer, Jon  (1983) "Dreams, Trance and Visions: What a Transpersonal Anthropology Might Look Like".  ''Phoenix:  Journal of Transpersonal Anthropology'' 7 (1/2):141-159.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1988"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1988) "Transpersonal Anthropology: Some Methodological Issues."  ''Western Canadian Anthropology'' 5:29-60.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994a"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Psychic Energy and Transpersonal Experience: A Biogenetic Structural Account of the Tibetan Dumo Practice," in ''Being Changed by Cross-cultural Encounters: The Anthropology of Extraordinary Experiences'' (ed. by D.E. Young and J.-G. Goulet).  Peterborough: Broadview Press, pp.&amp;nbsp;99–134.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994b"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Transpersonal Anthropology, Then and Now."  ''Transpersonal Review'' 1(1): 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Laughlin 1994c"&gt;Laughlin, Charles D. (1994) "Apodicticity:  The Problem of Absolute Certainty in Transpersonal Anthropology."  ''Anthropology &amp; Humanism'' 19(2): 1-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The work of Al-Issa &lt;ref name="Al-Issa 1995"/&gt; has dealt with the topic of hallucinations, and the cultural aspects of them. Here, Al-Issa notes how not all cultures have negative views on hallucinations. Cross-cultural differences are noted by Al-Issa in sensory modalities most commonly encountered in hallucinations.

The field also includes the theories of anthropologist Dennis Gaffin whose contribution is a re-conceptualization of fairyology and the [[fairy]]-faith within the context of anthropology.&lt;ref name="Leykam 2013"&gt; Leykam, A. E. Book Review: Running with the fairies: towards a transpersonal anthropology of religion. ''Choice'' ; Middletown  Vol. 50, Iss. 6,  (Feb 2013): 1099. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Butler 2015"&gt; Butler, Jenny. Book Review: Gaffin, Dennis. 2013. Running with the Fairies: Towards a Transpersonal Anthropology of Religion. ''Fieldwork in Religion'', 10.2 (2015), 252–254&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheppard&lt;ref name="Sheppard 2006"/&gt; explains how Edith Turner's interpretations of her husband's field studies among the [[Ndembu]] in [[Zambia]] also can be interpreted as belonging to transpersonal anthropology, insofar as her interpretations of their [[healing ritual]]s were transpersonal.

==Criticism==

Sheppard &lt;ref name="Sheppard 2007"&gt;Sheppard, E. (2007). Anthropology and the development of the transpersonal movement: Finding the transpersonal in transpersonal anthropology. ''Transpersonal Psychology Review'' 11(1) 59-69 {{ISSN|1366-6991}}.&lt;/ref&gt; has published an article criticising transpersonal anthropology, at least as it has typically been practiced in contemporary scholarship. Her criticisms include its lack of a systematic conceptual base; its over-emphasis on shamanism; the difficulty in studying non-Western cultures that have been truly immune to Western influences and the question of the extent to which transpersonal anthropology has really addressed [[altered states of consciousness]].

The '''Water Tribunal of the plain of Valencia''', also known as the '''Tribunal of Waters''' ({{lang-ca-valencia|Tribunal de les Aigües de València}}) is an institution of Justice to settle disputes arising from the use of irrigation water by farmers in several Irrigation Communities ({{lang-ca-valencia|Comunitats de Regants}}) and [[canal]]s (''Quart'', ''Benàger i Faitanar'', ''Tormos'', ''Mislata'', ''Mestalla'', ''Favara'', ''Rascanya'', ''Rovella'' and ''Xirivella'')&lt;ref name=Website&gt;{{cite web|title=Acequias of Valencia|url=http://www.tribunaldelasaguas.org/en/|website=Tribunal de las Aguas de la Vega de Valencia|accessdate=2 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Horta de València]].

In 2009 it was chosen along with the [[Council of Wise Men of the plain of Murcia]] as [[intangible cultural heritage]] by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Irrigators’ tribunals of the Spanish Mediterranean coast: the Council of Wise Men of the plain of Murcia and the Water Tribunal of the plain of Valencia|url=http://www.unesco.org/culture/ich/RL/00171|publisher=UNESCO Culture Sector |accessdate=27 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proceedings of the Tribunal==
The Tribunal is a [[customary court]]. It consists of one representative, called a trustee, from each of the Irrigation Communities—nine in total—and one among them is elected president for a period of two years. Every Thursday the Tribunal meets in public and an administrative session at the Casa Vestidor at the [[Plaça de la Mare de Déu]] of [[Valencia]] to discuss various issues, mainly the distribution of water. On public holidays that fall on a Thursday, the Water Court meets on the preceding Wednesday &lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitvalencia.com/en/what-to-visit-valencia/monuments/list-of-monuments/monument/7834&lt;/ref&gt;. That is when the bailiff, with the permission of the president, calls for cases from each of the canals in turn, with the traditional phrase "''denunciants de la sèquia de...!''" ("claimants from the irrigation canal of...!"). The trial takes place quickly and is completely in [[Valencian]].&lt;ref name="Proceedings"&gt;{{cite web|title=The proceedings|url=http://www.tribunaldelasaguas.org/en/el-tribunal-ing/funcionamiento-ing|website=Tribunal de las Aguas de la Vega de Valencia|accessdate=24 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Each complainant puts his case before the Tribunal, and then the accused defends himself and answers questions. It is then when the Tribunal, with the exception of the trustee of the canal in question (to ensure fairness) decides the guilt of the defendant, and if so found, it is the trustee of the canal who imposes the penalty for the offender, according to the ''Bylaws of the Irrigation Communities'' ({{lang-ca-valencia|Ordenances de la pròpia Comunitat de Regants}}). 
The court is purely oral—there is nothing done in writing and no records are kept.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.valenciavalencia.com/sights-guide/sights-listings/tribunal-aguas-water-court.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Tribunal de les Aigües Valencia.JPG|thumb|''Tribunal de las Aguas'' by [[Bernardo Ferrándiz]], 1865]]
The Tribunal's origin is not fully known, although it is likely to have evolved from previous [[Al-Andalus|Andalusian]] traditions. Some historians such as [[José Vicente Gómez Bayarri]] placed its origins in Roman times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasprovincias.es/valencia/prensa/20091115/opinion/agricultura-tribunal-aguas-valencia-20091115.html|title=La agricultura y el Tribunal de las Aguas en la Valencia musulmana|publisher=Las Provincias|trans-title=Agriculture and Water Court in Muslim Valencia|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most widespread theory, but without any historical basis, is owed to [[Francisco Javier Borrull]]. His hypothesis is that there was already a precedent in Roman times, but its foundation as it operates today occurred during the reigns of the Caliphs [[Abd-ar-Rahman III]] and [[Al-Hakam II]], specifically in 960. Borrull's reason was that during the reign of these two Caliphs was an era of complete peace on the Iberian peninsula, and therefore it must have been founded then. In fact, the millennial anniversary of the founding of the Water Tribunal took place in 1960, led by [[Vicente Giner Boira]], legal adviser to the Tribunal at the time, and leading proponent of this theory in the twentieth century.

'''Yohualichan''' (''Yohualican'' or ''House of Night'' in [[Nahuatl]]) is a [[Pre-Columbian era|Pre-Columbian]] archaeological site located in [[Cuetzalan del Progreso (municipality)|Cuetzalan del Progreso]] in the Mexican state of [[Puebla]].

Yohualican and the larger nearby city of [[El Tajín]] both reached a cultural and political epoch during the [[Classic period]] and are both believed to have been constructed and populated by the [[Totonac people]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.inah.gob.mx/zonas/114-zona-arqueologica-de-yohualichan|title=Zona Arqueológica de Yohualichan|website=www.inah.gob.mx|language=es-es|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oem.com.mx/elsoldepuebla/notas/n3246063.htm|title=Organización Editorial Mexicana|website=www.oem.com.mx|language=en|access-date=2017-04-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the end of the Classic Period, the nomadic [[Chichimeca|Chichimecas]] begin migrating into the modern day [[Valley of Mexico]] around the year 1200. From then on, Yohualican would come under pressure from these migratory tribes and would begin to fall into a gradual decline.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
