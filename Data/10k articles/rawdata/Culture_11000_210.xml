The pouch is large and comfortable for the baby. The mother can bring the child from back to front for [[breastfeeding]] or for [[human waste|eliminatory function]]s without exposure to the elements.&lt;ref name = "McCord" /&gt; This traditional eastern Arctic Inuit parka, designed to keep the child warm and safe from [[frostbite]], wind and cold, also helps to develop bonding between mother and child.&lt;ref name = "Karetak"&gt;{{Citation

==The making of the amauti==
The amauti can be made from a variety of materials including [[pinniped|seal]]skin, [[caribou]] skin or [[Melton Mowbray#Melton cloth|duffle cloth]] (a thick [[wool]]len cloth) with a windproof outer shell. Children continue to be commonly carried in this way in the eastern Arctic communities of [[Nunavut]] and [[Nunavik]], but the garment is sometimes seen in the [[Northwest Territories]], [[Greenland]], [[Labrador]], [[Russian Arctic]] and [[Alaska]]. Cloth amautiit have gradually displaced skin garments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The child's placement in the garment==

Many external viewers think that the child is carried in the hood of the amauti, and this erroneous depiction can be seen in many works of art.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallery.ca/en/see/collections/artwork.php?mkey=5270 Frances Loring, National Gallery of Canada]&lt;/ref&gt; This is not the case. The hood is enlarged in an amauti to permit both child and mother to be covered together, while the child is actually carried in the enlarged and extended back of the garment. The child rides with his or her belly against the mother's back and with knees bent. The garment is secured at the waist with a tie or belt which prevents the child from slipping down from the pouch. The weight of the child is carried across the shoulders of the garment although this weight is typically re-distributed by two more ties which form a "v" from the collar bone, with the base secured by the tie at the waist.  A final tie attaches to the front edge of the hood, permitting the mother to either open the hood for a curious child to emerge and take in the surroundings, or to pull the hood across closing the child away from the wind and elements.

==Winter and summer clothing==
[[Image:Baby Carriage 2002-08-02 (cut).jpg|thumb|left|Inuit woman wearing an amautiq (long-tailed style, ''angijuqtaujaq'') while pushing a [[baby transport|baby carriage]] in 2002 in [[Cape Dorset]], [[Nunavut]].]]
[[Image:Inuit Amautiq 1995-06-15.jpg|thumb|Two Inuit women wearing amautiit (skirted style, akuliq) in 1995 in [[Nunavut]].]]

There are usually two styles of amauti: long-tailed style ''angijuqtaujaq'', like a dress (shown on the right, with the two women); and skirted style ''akulik'', a longer back with a stylized tail-like hem at the back (shown on the left picture-white). Hood shape, decoration and tail shape all speak to the region of origin of an amauti. The sleeves and hem on a winter amauti are trimmed with solid colour stripes which emphasize the feminine/maternal cut, and the swing of the "tail".  The winter amauti is classically seen with a white cotton cover (silapak), but also in other solid colours, with an inner duffle inner layer, also trimmed, in a darker solid colour.

In the past, the longer amauti tails were decorated with [[amulet|talisman]]s such as beads, shells and pierced coins, although dispproval of these talismans as "heathen" by the church reduced the frequency within which they were used. The talismans were said to attract spirits to the swinging tail and thus protect the [[ovary|ovaries]] (and fertility), located at the front, from attracting spirit attentions.

Not shown are the more modern summer amauti which have no sleeves, less insulation, and permit a child to be carried while berry picking or in other summer occupations. They are also used during the winter months of the year, used with an oversized parka covering both mother and baby. The summer amauti is typically made from quilted cloth in any number of patterns.

==Amauti as style==

Recently an amauti beaded by Ooloosie Ashevak, the daughter-in-law of well-known Inuit artist, [[Kenojuak Ashevak]], sold at auction for $19,200 at Waddington's after being estimated at $4,000 to $6,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.waddingtons.ca/auctions/view.php?id=23april2007i&amp;sub=session1&amp;o=60&amp;lot=0066 |title=Waddington's Auction House |access-date=2007-05-06 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928165048/http://www.waddingtons.ca/auctions/view.php?id=23april2007i&amp;sub=session1&amp;o=60&amp;lot=0066 |archive-date=2007-09-28 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His research started with a rethinking of [[dependency theory]] in the framework of [[quantitative data]] and [[statistical analysis]] and work on poverty in the leading industrialized countries.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Political Science Quarterly]]'', 1978, Vol. 93, No. 2 (Summer, 1978), pp. 277-299; Rose Gauger, 1980 ''Wird die Barbarei siegen?

His doctoral thesis at [[Salzburg University]] on "The limits to growth theory" &lt;ref&gt;Die Grenzen der Wachstumstheorie. Vienna Institute for Development, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; was dedicated to the empirical analysis of dependency, income inequality, and social development in up to 40 countries of the world, with country studies for [[Brazil]] and [[Yugoslavia]].&lt;ref&gt;''Weltwirtschaftsordnung und Entwicklungspolitik: Plädoyer für Dissoziation''. Frankfurt: Suhrkamp Verlag KG, 1977, various editions&lt;/ref&gt; Following the logic of trying to identify the structures, which block [[Third-World]] development in the [[industrialized countries]], he then researched on Austrian [[arms exports]] to Third World countries, based on United States [[Arms Control and Disarmament Agency]] figures.&lt;ref&gt;These arguments in turn led to a considerable debate on Austria’s arms exports, taken up by the Austrian Deputy of the Green Party, [[Peter Pilz]], (1988). ''Die Panzermacher: die österreichische Rüstungsindustrie und ihre Exporte''. Verlag für Gesellschaftskritik.&lt;/ref&gt;

His [[habilitation thesis]] focused on [[multiple regression]] models of global development, based on data from the [[World Bank]] and Volker Bornschier as well as the ''World Handbook of Political and Social Indicators III'', and tests the relevance of socio-liberal approaches to world development, already inherent in the writings of classical social democratic development theories in Europe in the 1930s with [[multiple regression]] and [[canonical correlation]] models.&lt;ref&gt;Reviews in ''Schweizerische Zeitschrift für Soziologie'', 1988, 14, 2: 354-359 (Michael Nollert); ''[[Das Argument]]'', 1989, 173: 134-136 Hans-Heinrich Nolte; Vierteljahresberichte.

Later work dealt with Russia and the global [[Kondratieff cycle]];&lt;ref&gt;Tausch, Arno 1991 ''Russlands Tretmuehle. Kapitalistisches Weltsystem, lange Zyklen und die neue Instabilitaet im Osten''.

 «L'entrée dans une phase descendante de l'économie mondiale» devrait accroître «l'incertitude» politique » [[Le Monde]], Mardi 21 Mars 2017 stated on Korotayev, Grinin and Tausch's work on Kondratieff cycles: ''"First, according to our three authors: the upward economic phase that began in the mid-1980s ended; it is in the process of making way for a downward phase which should begin to manifest its effects from the years 2015-2018, that is to say as soon as the exit of our great crisis of 2008 begins. This is to explain part of the unexpected character of our uncertainty. Concerning the relationship between this last phase of economic growth and armed conflicts, it seems to confirm Kondratieff's hypothesis. The entry into a downward phase of the world economy should aggravate this trend while increasing the uncertainty of its forms. [...] This panorama is certainly not enough to reduce these unexpected uncertainties, but it already contributes to better understand them by identifying several of their origins."''.

== Critique ==

Although the concept of "[[unequal exchange]]", as developed by Kohler and Tausch &lt;ref&gt;Köhler, G. and A. Tausch 2002. Global Keynesianism: unequal exchange and global exploitation, Huntington NY: Nova Science&lt;/ref&gt; has become one of the standard definitions in "[[world system theory]]" &lt;ref&gt;for a development of the Kohler/Tausch concept of [[unequal exchange]] in the framework of the [[commodity chain]], see the paper of the Turkish economist [[Cem Somel]] from the [[Middle East Technical University]], Ankara: [[Department of Social Protection]]; more on the Kohler/Tausch work on Global Keynesianism in [[Robert H Jackson]]; [[Georg Sørensen]] Introduction to international relations: theories and approaches. Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2013, p. 179-207 and Don A. Clelland: Surplus drain and dark value in the modern world system. In: Routledge Handbook of World-Systems Analysis (Editor: [[Salvatore Babones]]) page 198-204 [[Routledge]], London and New York: 2012: {{ISBN|041556364X}} / {{ISBN|9780415563642}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in critical studies on [[globalization]] and [[sustainable development]],&lt;ref&gt;see [[Vincentas Giedraitis]] and associates: Feeling the heat: Financial crises and their impact on global climate change. Perspectives of Innovations, Economics and Business, PIEB (Perspectives of Innovations, Economics and Business, PIEB), issue: 1(4) / 2010, pages: 710,on www.ceeol.com&lt;/ref&gt; the Turkish economist [[Turan Subasat]] ([[Izmir University]]) recently criticized this concept by saying that international prices are formed in a complex manner and lower international prices for low income countries cannot simply be considered as evidence for unequal exchange.&lt;ref&gt;Turan Subasat (2013). Can Differences in International Prices Measure Unequal Exchange in International Trade? Competition and Change, Volume 17, Issue 4 (October 2013), pp. 372-379&lt;/ref&gt;

The Austrian political scientist [[Thomas Schmidinger]], writing in the official journal of the [[Austrian Political Science Association]], [[Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft]],&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Schmidinger. 2011. "Arno Tausch: Armut und Radikalität? Soziologische Perspektiven zur Integration der Muslime in Europa basierend auf dem „World Values Survey“ und dem „European Social Survey“ ''Österreichische Zeitschrift für Politikwissenschaft'' (ÖZP) 1/2011, S. 100 – 101&lt;/ref&gt; on Tausch's attempts to measure Muslim opinions in Europe &lt;ref&gt;Arno Tausch: Armut und Radikalität? Soziologische Perspektiven zur Integration der Muslime in Europa basierend auf dem „World Values Survey“ und dem „European Social Survey“. Europäischer Hochschulverlag. Bremen 2010, {{ISBN|978-3-941482-76-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; comes to the conclusion:

''"Tausch attempts to redress the lack of serious qualitative and quantitative social research by using data from the [[World Values Survey]] and the [[European Social Survey]]. He speaks even of a "forensic political science " and a "forensic sociology" (p 9). He rightly criticizes that neither the European Union nor the national states in Europe provide adequate resources for such research. Really to resolve this lack of data, a whole team of long-term research would have been necessary. Right here, however, Tausch shows that he [also] does not have enough data and therefore his approach - as he himself writes in the introduction - is "forensic". Who really wants to get more secure data in the debate on Islam in Europe should invest in a large-scale study conducted in a methodologically sound way, which should not examine only the Muslim population, but also appropriate comparison groups from the non-Muslim population."''

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2697">'''Banu Najjar''' (Arabic: بنو نجّار, "sons of the carpenter") or '''Banu al-Najjar''' is the name of several unrelated historical and modern-day tribes throughout the [[Arab world]]. The individual tribes vary in religious composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.yabeyrouth.com/8073-%D8%A2%D9%84-%D9%86%D8%AC%D9%91%D8%A7%D8%B1-2|access-date=20 October 2018|title=Banu Najjar}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Islamic history==
One Banu Najjar group is mentioned in the [[Constitution of Medina|Charter of Medina]], and the Banu Najjar of Medina were the maternal clan of Muhammad's grandfather [[Abdul-Muttalib]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title= The Life, Work, and Character of Mohammed |last1=Power|first1=Edmond|journal= Studies: An Irish Quarterly Review |volume=3|issue=10|year=1914|pages=142–159}}&lt;/ref&gt; Islamic historians like [[Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani]] and [[al-Tabari]] list them as a clan of the large [[Banu Khazraj]] tribe of Medina. Al-Asqalani states that their ancestor was Taymallah ibn Thalabah ibn Amr ibn al-Khazraj.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Hajar al-Asqalani (1986). [[Fath al-Bari]]. page 144.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The History of al-Tabari Vol. 6: Muhammad at Mecca|last1=al-Tabari|first1=Abu Jafar|page=125|isbn=9780887067075}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banu Najjar had at least three sub-clans.&lt;ref name="Peters"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Arabs and Arabia on the Eve of Islam (Volume 3)|editor=FE Peters|pages=130–134, 153|chapter=Idol Worship in Pre-Islamic Medina|publisher=Routledge|year=2014|isbn=9781351894807}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before Islam, the Banu Najjar of Medina mainly practiced traditional Arab polytheism, and owned [[Cult image|idols]] named Samul, Husa, and at-Tamm that were destroyed after the clan converted to Islam.&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt; They may have had a [[Mawla|tribal alliance]] with some of the Jews of Medina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Guillaume|first1=Alfred|title=New light on the life of Muhammad|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|pages=427–428|volume=26|issue=2|year=1963}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Peters" /&gt;

Muhammad initially settled with them when he [[Hegira|emigrated]] from [[Mecca]] to Medina. The [[Al-Masjid an-Nabawi|Prophet's Mosque]] was later built in the tribe's garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/55/37|title=Sahih Bukhari|access-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Banu Najjar are praised in a hadith attributed to Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sunnah.com/bukhari/78/83|title=Sahih Bukhari|access-date=20 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Big Boogey Adventure'' premiered in the United States on March 30, 2007, and in the UK on February 14, 2007, and was released on [[DVD]] in the U.S. on April 3, 2007.

==Plot==
In the future, in a dystopian Endsville, an evil being known as the "Lord of Horror" orders his henchmen to go back in time to eliminate Billy and Mandy and prevent them from reaching a powerful hand-like artifact that the Lord of Horror has in his possession. Billy and Irwin of this time hope their past selves can stop the Lord of Horror's evil plans.

Two weeks prior, [[Grim Reaper|Grim]] is sued for [[dereliction of duty]] by his old rival, the [[Bogeyman|Boogey Man]], the former having failed to reap General Skarr thanks to an intervention from Billy and Mandy. Grim and the children (including Irwin) are set to be exiled by the Underworld Court and placed in the custody of Boogey, with Grim being stripped of his job and powers and Numbuh 3 of ''[[Codename: Kids Next Door]]'' as his [[Court appointment|court-appointed]] replacement. Boogey reveals it was part of his plan to steal Horror's Hand, an artifact capable of bringing people's deepest fears to life and transforming anyone who conquers their fear into the scariest and most powerful being in existence; Boogey himself believes that with its power, children will fear him again. The group eventually escapes and plans to obtain the hand for themselves for various reasons (Grim believes it will get him his job back, Mandy sees it as the way to conquer the world, Irwin thinks it will help him win Mandy's heart and Billy just wants to use it to get a candy bar).

Both groups eventually reach where the hand is held, where they meet Horror the Ancient (guest star [[George Segal]]), a living [[statue]] that cut off the hand -originally his left hand- having placed his fears within it. To obtain the hand, two rivaling groups must embark on a race across the Cannibal Run - the most dangerous section of the [[River Styx]] - as well as facing their worst fears. Grim and the children win and scrape to obtain the hand. Billy, Irwin and Mandy are easily subdued by their respective worst nightmares (a spider-clown-mailman hybrid, telling jokes to wild bears and growing up into an optimistic woman married to Irwin), leaving Grim to claim the hand unaffected, revealing he lived his worst nightmare every day - living with Billy and Mandy. The hand however is almost immediately stolen by Boogey (who uses it to scare Grim to pieces, though Grim actually blew himself up on purpose). Believing he has won, Boogey turns out to be incapable of facing his worst fear, realizing that he is not at all scary (Grim actually turned the hand's power off right after he picked it up). He suffers [[amnesia]] after a series of accidents, and ends up afraid of everything. Billy also reveals that he and his friends obtained what they wanted all along without the need for Horror's Hand.

After the Underworld Court arrive to make one last attempt to banish Grim forever, Mandy insistently makes them reinstate Grim as the Grim Reaper, because he saved them from a future ruled by Boogey, but also because Numbuh 3 was too much of an optimist to actually reap anyone. In the end, a naked, cut up, future Billy appears before them to warn that if Mandy had used Horror's Hand, she would have taken over the world in two weeks, becoming the Lord of Horror from his time. Grim decides to put the hand in his trunk to ensure that that future never comes to pass. Future Billy eventually goes back to the future to make sure that things were set right.

The [[End credits|credits]] roll, showing that General Skarr used the hole in his chest to keep birds, Mandy became the new Captain of Boogey's ship, Numbah 3 started her own Reaper-for-hire service, Dracula stole Grim's scythe, and Billy eventually became [[President of the United States]].

The [[epilogue]] shows how Billy went back to the future to find that it hasn't changed as Fred Fredburger has obtained Horror's Hand from Grim's magic trunk and took over the world as the new Lord of Horror.

==Production==
Creating the film was the first time that [[Maxwell Atoms]] had created anything with a length of over one hour. That, along with creating the regular season was challenging for him. Boogey Man was chosen as the [[villain]] for the film because he was a lesser villain that had a relationship with Grim. This was because Atoms was given the idea to follow a storyline similar to ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'' by a Cartoon Network representative. The role of Numbuh Three was originally supposed to be taken up by [[Pamela Anderson]], but she did not take the part. Afterwards, he decided to use Numbuh Two, who is innocent, as a sneak preview of ''The Grim Adventures of the Kids Next Door'', but ended being suggested by Tom Warburton that Numbuh Three be used instead. Atoms also used some Nintendo cameos in the later part of this TV movie, such as when Boogey Man [[Kidnapping|kidnaps]] Mandy he makes a "warp pipe" appear and its [[sound effect|SFX]] is used when he goes into it&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t%3D106645 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-08-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071014111633/http://forum.newsarama.com/showthread.php?t=106645 |archivedate=2007-10-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title track "Land of the Dead" was written and performed by [[Voltaire (musician)|Voltaire]]. It is Voltaire's second collaboration for ''The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy'', the first being on the episode "Little Rock of Horrors" with the song "[[BRAINS!]]".

==Home media==
The film was released on [[DVD]] by [[Warner Home Video]] in the United States on April 3, 2007. The DVD contains both anamorphic wide screen and modified full screen versions with 5.1 surround sound and regular stereo sound. Special features include the original "Bully Boogie" episode that Boogey originally debuted in and interviews with the voice actors.&lt;ref name="dvdverdict.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/billyandmandy.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120306022110/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/billyandmandy.php |archivedate=2012-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
The film received generally positive reviews from critics. Dennis Prince of DVD Verdict reviewed the movie saying, "All told, Billy &amp; Mandy's Big Boogey Adventure is a gift from Atoms, and an indulgence of all the goodness and gooeyness that has made the series a top draw on Cartoon Network. Despite the boogers, bare buttocks, and boorish humor, this court finds no real crime has been committed. Case dismissed".&lt;ref name="dvdverdict.com"/&gt; [[MaryAnn Johanson]], of The Flick Filospher reviewed the movie saying "'Full-length movie. Full of boogers!' promises the blobby green sticker on the DVD. And it's true. But somehow, the tons of gross-out potty humor manages to be delightfully goofy -- perhaps it's the irresistibly cheerful spin cartoonist Maxwell Atoms puts on his demented twisting of kiddie cartoons"&lt;ref&gt;http://www.flickfilosopher.com/blog/2007/05/billy_mandys_big_boogey_advent.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was nominated for an [[Annie Award]] for Best Music in an Animated Television Production.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bcdb.com/cartoon/97847-Billy_Mandys_Big_Boogey_Adventure.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Inspiration Awards''' (BIAs) are a set of industry awards celebrating achievement in the [[creative industries]] of the United Kingdom, organised by David Yarnton, the UK managing director for [[Nintendo]]. The inaugural awards took place at a ceremony in London on 23 April 2010. The awards, in the shape of a gold statue of [[Boudica]], were presented in a number of categories including art, design, entertainment, fashion and science. All proceeds of the awards are to be donated to various charities.

==History==
With the UK in a recession in the late 2000s, and with a steadily declining manufacturing industry and little natural resources, the creative sector was believed to be the basis for future growth, and was as of 2010 was estimated to already contribute £110billion to the economy per annum, contribute two million jobs, and number over businesses classed as creative.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt;

The BIAs were initiated by David Yarnton, the UK managing director for [[Nintendo]].&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt; He was of the opinion that "The UK is the creative capital of the World" and it was "about time that the UK creative sector was recognised for its achievements".&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt; He was of the belief that, although a world leader in the creative industries, Britain had a tendency to understate its achievements, and thus sought to correct that.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt; The BIAs were therefore created to recognise those who have already contributed to Great Britain's "economic, social and artistic development through creative endeavor", and highlight the opportunities Britain offered in the creative industries.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=BIAHome/&gt;

On the eve of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 United Kingdom general election]] campaign, on 16 March 2010 the BIAs attracted the support of the Prime Minister [[Gordon Brown]], Conservative Party leader [[David Cameron]] and Liberal Democrat Party leader [[Nick Clegg]].&lt;ref name=BIA16Mar2010Release/&gt;&lt;ref name=NewStatesman8Apr2010/&gt; The inaugural BIAs were to be presented in a daytime ceremony at The Brewery near [[Barbican Centre]] in London on 23 April 2010 ([[St George's Day]]).&lt;ref name=BIAEvent/&gt; The nominees in each category were announced on 14 April 2010.&lt;ref name=DailyExpress14Apr2010PrintEdition/&gt;

Attendees of the ceremony, hosted by [[Richard Madeley]], included nominees David Arnold, Michael Eavis and Gareth Pugh, as well as [[Phillip Schofield]], [[Ant and Dec]], [[Helen Skelton]] and [[Andy Akinwolere]].&lt;ref name=AttendeesWireImages/&gt;

==The Award==
The BIA is given "In recognition of an individual, company or groups contribution to the Creative Economy of Great Britain and the Inspiration that they give to others".&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; Individual awards are to be presented in categories for the Film; Television; Music; Fashion; Arts; Design; Innovation, Enterprise and Industry; Science and Technology; and Interactive Entertainment industry sectors, as well as a Special Recognition award.&lt;ref name=BIACategories/&gt;

The BIAs use the symbol of [[Boudica]] as their logo and award. Described by the BIA organisers as a "forward looking woman who inspired others around her",&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; Boudica was a queen of the ancient tribe of the [[Iceni]] of present-day [[Norfolk]], who in AD 60 or 61 led them and neighbouring tribes in a revolt against the authority of [[Gaius Suetonius Paulinus]], the [[Governors of Roman Britain|Roman Governor of Britain]], before ultimately being defeated.

The award itself is a gold statue of the stylised version of Boudica depicted in the BIA logo.&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt; The logo shows this stylistic representation of Boudica moving forward using four shades of colour, symbolising England, [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]] "moving forward together as one."&lt;ref name=BIAAbout/&gt;

'''''Butt-Ugly Martians''''' is an [[Americans|American]] [[computer animation|computer-animated]] [[television series]], which aired on [[Nickelodeon]] in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Things Are Getting Ugly |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 9, 2001|url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,104681,00.html|accessdate=2010-11-16|first=JENNIE JAMES|last=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; There were also three video games based on the series named ''[[Butt-Ugly Martians: Zoom or Doom|Butt Ugly Martians: Zoom or Doom]]'' for [[PlayStation 2]], ''Butt-Ugly Martians: B.K.M. Battles'' for [[Game Boy Advance]], and ''Butt-Ugly Martians: Martian Boot Camp'' for [[Personal computer|PC]]. The franchise also had a toy line by Hasbro.

The plot of the series begins when the Butt-Ugly Martians (B.U.M.) are forced to invade planets for the evil Emperor Bog, but when they are sent to Earth they become addicted to American culture. Deciding not to hurt Earth, they simply ''pretend'' to be occupying the planet for Bog. They are shown around by their Earthling friends: Mike, Cedric, and Angela. The Butt-Ugly Martians continue to hang out on Earth as long as Emperor Bog never finds out. The show ran for 26 episodes before being cancelled on March 4 of the same year.

==Characters==

===Main===
* '''B-Bop A-Luna''' (voiced by [[Charlie Schlatter]]) – Commander B-Bop A-Luna is the diplomat and leader of the Butt-Ugly Martians. Brave, showy, and a little big headed (although increasingly less as the show went on), B-Bop can always be trusted to think up a good cover story and look convincing doing it. He's a natural leader, able to get even the most cowardly characters behind him even when he's not entirely sure what to do. Nevertheless, B-Bop can think on the fly and usually comes up with a plan that works. He also has a bit of a temper; 2T and Do-Wah are usually the two to calm him down. He is more tactile than the other two Martians. B-Bop is officially the commanding officer of 2T and Do-Wah in the Martian Fleet (he is occasionally addressed as "Commander" by the two). He wears a yellow uniform and a Yellow BKM suit. His age (along with 2T and Do-Wah's) are not revealed. It's assumed that the three are teenagers, although they refer to Mike, Cedric and Angela as kids.
* '''2T Fru-T''' (voiced by [[Rob Paulsen]]) – 2T Fru-T is the mechanic (described on the BUM merchandise as a "tech officer", he is most likely a lieutenant as he is of lower status than B-Bop but higher than Do-Wah) for the Butt-Uglies and inventor of BKM. Sometimes B.Bop and Do-Wah can pick on 2T although they are his friends. A mechanical prodigy, 2T is the MacGyver of Martians and has been able to construct anything from invisibility rays to the BKM (Butt Kicking Mode) suits using parts that were immediately available. He often finds himself at the mercy of sub-standard parts sent to him by Dr. Damage, but these never slow him down for long. 2T is a bit socially inept, often forgetting Earth colloquialisms and fading into technical jargon when it's not necessary. He's also a bad liar under stress, although he can think of a good cover story whenever B-Bop is indisposed. He's usually calm, but has been known to snap at his friends whenever he feels betrayed (this may be insecurity; one episode has him stopping Muldoon in his usual slew of anti-alien insults with a cracking voice, as if he's about to cry). He wears a blue uniform and a Blue BKM suit.
* '''Do-Wah Diddy''' (voiced by [[Jess Harnell]]) – Corporal Do-Wah Diddy is the fun Martian of the Butt-Uglies. Do-Wah has a huge appetite and loves milkshakes, hamburgers, junk food and all other unhealthy foods. Not surprisingly, Do-Wah is the fattest of the Martians (although not obese). Despite a prominent belly, Do-Wah has super-Martian strength (Martians on the show are stronger than humans by themselves, so this is a particularly powerful statement). Despite his thickness (or possibly because of it), he is extraordinarily sweet and usually the first to look on the bright side and find the good in people. Do-Wah has a light crush on Angela, the show's only female human. Do-Wah Diddy wears a red uniform and a Red BKM suit, and the merchandise gave his rank as a corporal. 
* '''Shaboom Shabooma''' (voiced by [[Kath Soucie]]) – A female Martian secret agent. Dr. Damage mind-controlled her and sent her to Earth to remove the trio's ability to BKM so his new robot could destroy them. Luckily, 2T was able to locate the device controlling her to protect the earth and free her. She's aware of the trio's defection but keeps it a secret, and it's often implied that the Butt-Uglies have crushes on her. 
* '''Michael "Mike" Ellis''' (voiced by Rob Paulsen) – A red-headed, green eyed 13-year-old boy, Mike is the unofficial and sometimes debatable leader of the human friends of the Martians. A typical [[teenager]], Mike enjoys TV, junk food, hoverboarding, and the newest pop music. Mike is prone to bouts of big headedness, much like B-Bop, but can also get his confidence shattered readily whenever he's upset. Mike's also a pessimist at times, but is the first to jump in and take charge whenver the situation calls for it. Along the course of the show, Mike has been exposed to deadly radiation, electrocuted, kidnapped (twice), and subjected to several other unearthly threats. Mike hates it when people call him "Mikey".
* '''Angela Young''' (voiced by Kath Soucie) – The only female human ever shown on the show. Angela is level-headed and smart, often the voice of reason to the more reckless male characters on the show. Much to Mike's dismay, she is also very good at video games (breaking another stereotype in the process) and once saved the world with her skills with a joystick. Angela is typically considered beautiful by other alien species, and has been kidnapped twice as a result. Both instances had her fighting her kidnapper, but being rescued by the Martians anyway. Not quite a tomboy, Angela will sometimes "squeak" when she talks, especially when she's excited. Angela acknowledges that Do-Wah has a crush on her; whether she likes him back romantically is debatable.
* '''Cedric Cyles''' (voiced by [[Ogie Banks]]) – A 12-year-old boy, Cedric hangs out with Mike and Angela (he was moved forward in school, which explains his age and his height). Cedric has big glasses and, for some reason, brown eyes that reflect silver if the light hits them the right way (this was most likely an animation glitch or the light reflecting off of his glasses, as it is never addressed on the show). He is a technical wizard akin to 2T, although he is more of a computer hacker than a mechanic. Cedric also has incredible aim, able to hit very small targets from very far away. Cedric tends to make corny jokes which either go unheard or make him the target of strange looks. Cedric can be very nervous, and is sometimes seen wringing his hands in worry. Surprisingly, Cedric is obsessed with fame and, more importantly, fortune, with his quest for money leading to almost callousness towards his friends (although, in the end, he always pulls through). Overall, he's a good person. Cedric was never given a last name on the show.
* '''Stoat Muldoon''' (voiced by [[Robert Stack]]) – Stoat Muldoon is an overly zealous alien hunter who discovers the martians on Earth several times throughout the series, but every time he has, the Martians have outwitted him and erased his memory. He has an underground base in the middle of the desert where he broadcasts his television show and dedicates his time to studying paranormal activity. Throughout most of the series, Stoat Muldoon is considered the antagonist of the show, but on a few special occasions, he joins forces with the Martians to defeat Emperor Bog and Dr. Damage. He is also allergic to nuts. His name is a reference to another famous alien obsesser, [[Fox Mulder]] of the ''X-Files''. He is not evil, merely over-eager. Although he seems to be rather incompetent, he is a very brave man, as when the children were threatened by Klaktor, he put himself in danger to protect them despite having no weapon.
*'''Dog''' – Their robot pet dog that can fly and seems to always find a way to get the martians out of trouble.

===Enemies===
* '''Emperor Bog''' (voiced by [[S. Scott Bullock]]) – The evil but foolish ruler of the Martian populace, Bog is often fooled by the Butt-Ugly Martians' fake progress reports. He has little tolerance for imperfection, his idea of perfection being everything going according to what he wants. In short, Bog is little more than a whiny, spoiled brat. As the show progressed, Bog became more suspicious of his "loyal subjects". He likes to roll his R's. He is incredibly lazy, admitting to not even having to pluck his own nose hair, but for some reason has prominent abs and pecs.
* '''Dr. Damage''' (voiced by S. Scott Bullock) – Bog's more intelligent right-hand-man, Damage (pronounced "da-MAHJ") constantly suspects that the Butt-Uglies are up to something. He's usually right, but rarely noticed. Damage develops many instruments, machines and mutant creatures to conquer Earth, but these are usually destroyed by the Butt-Uglies, making Damage look like a fool in the process. He constantly insults Bog behind his back, despite Bog usually hearing him, and so always has to make up a compliment that sounds vaguely like what he was saying (e.g. "Royal nincompoop" becomes "loyal troops" in the first episode). He has also, on some occasions, tried to overthrow Emperor Bog as Martian Emperor. However, Emperor Bog eventually found out about this ambition and punished Damage by making him wash and wax every ship on their base, with Shaboom and Infi-Knight watch him to make sure that he did the job right.
* '''Jax The Conqueror''' – A warlord who despises Martians, but after being defeated and imprisoned by B-Bop and the others pretends to be willing to help them invade Earth to get a chance for revenge. He pilots a ship called the Doom Jax which is impervious to Martian weaponry. He has been "destroyed" three times in the series run, but always manages to come back.
* '''Humanga''' – A giant alien villain who is the only player of an alien game called Toget. Humanga has won as many games as the Butt-Uglies themselves.
* '''Infi-Knight''' – A four-armed robotic warrior created by Damage to speed the Earth invasion along. Probably the Butt-Uglies' most powerful enemy.
* '''Koo Foo''' – The last surviving member of an alien race. His race was an evil species that tried to conquer the whole universe 2000 Earth years ago before mysteriously vanishing. His crashed ship was submerged in the desert and believed to be a pyramid due to its shape. Muldoon accidentally released him at the same time the Martians arrived to destroy him. He took Angela to save her from danger but the Martians thought he was kidnapping her. It was eventually revealed that Koo Foo was not evil like the rest of his kind and had left the swarm of ships before crashing on Earth. He says he does not want to fight or hurt anyone. The Martians do not believe him until Angela points out that they themselves are different from almost all of their species. Koo Foo leaves in peace. He reappears as a one-off at Do-Wah's birthday party in the comic series.
* '''Gorgon''' – A fire-breathing lizard-like alien characterized by the ability to change into or possess others and a TERRIBLE smell. He speaks with a hiss.
* '''Klaktor''' – A Reconabot ([[portmanteau]] for "reconnaissance robot") that the Butt-Uglies defeated in the first episode, though he reappeared later in the series. Can fall apart and reassemble himself at will. This trait turned into a common sight gag; his action figure is equipped with ejectable arms.

The '''Dmanisi skull''', also known as '''Skull 5''' or '''D4500''', is one of five ''[[Homo erectus]]'' skulls discovered in [[Dmanisi]], [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]. Described in a publication in October 2013, it is estimated to be about 1.8 million years old and is the most complete skull of a [[Pleistocene]] ''[[Homo]]'' species,&lt;ref name=article&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Complete Skull from Dmanisi, Georgia, and the Evolutionary Biology of Early Homo |author=David Lordkipanidze, Marcia S.

The skull has been the cause of a paleontological controversy that is still ongoing as of 2017: many hominin fossils thought to be from different species such as ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' or ''[[Homo habilis]]'' may not have been separate species at all. Rather, they may have been a single evolving [[Lineage (evolution)|lineage]].&lt;ref name=nature /&gt;

== Discovery of the skull ==
[[File:Dmanissi, Georgia ; Homo georgicus 1999 discovery map.png|thumb|[[Dmanisi]] geographical localization in the middle of the [[Caucasus]]]]
In 1991, Georgian scientist [[David Lordkipanidze]] found traces of early human occupation in the cave at [[Dmanisi]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]]: a hamlet and an [[archaeological site]] about {{convert|90|km|mi}} southwest of the country's capital, [[Tbilisi]]. Since then, five early hominin skulls have been discovered at the site. '''Skull 5''', found in 2005, is the most complete specimen of them all. After further analysis, it was coupled with its [[mandible]] (D2600) found 5 years earlier. The final analysis of the discovery took many years and was only published in 2013.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

== Description of the skull ==
[[File:Amb. Bass-with D.Lordkipanidze at Dmanisi.JPG|thumb|[[David Lordkipanidze]] (centre) on the archeological site at [[Dmanisi]], 2010]]
Despite a brain volume the size of a large [[Australopithecus]] male, ({{convert|546|cm3|in3}}) all the characteristics of [[Homo erectus]] are clearly visible on '''Skull 5'''. The [[Neurocranium|braincase]] sizes of the other Dmanisi skulls are between {{convert|601|cm3|in3}} and {{convert|730|cm3|in3}}.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

The cranial superstructures of '''Skull 5''', which are prominent and massive, suggest that it was probably a male. Its face is one of the largest of any human ancestor discovered to date.&lt;ref name=article/&gt; The [[zygomatic arch]]es are massive with the right one displaying many traces of deformations, probably due to fractures and injuries. Researchers estimate that the height of the individual was between {{convert|146|cm|ft}} and {{convert|166|cm|ft}} and his weight between {{convert|47|kg|lb}} and {{convert|50|kg|lb}}.&lt;ref name=article /&gt;

== Dating ==
[[File:Dmanisi_stone_tool_1.jpg|thumb|Stone tools found on the [[Dmanisi]] [[paleontological]] site]]
Until the 1980s, scientists assumed that [[hominins]] had been restricted to the African continent for the whole of the [[Early Pleistocene]] (until about 0.8 [[Megaannum#SI prefix multipliers|Ma]]), only migrating out during a phase named [[Out of Africa I]]. Thus, the vast majority of archaeological effort was disproportionately focused on Africa.&lt;ref name = "Lahr 2010"&gt;Lahr, M.M., 2010. “Saharan Corridors and Their Role in the Evolutionary Geography of ‘Out of Africa I’”. In: A. Baden et al. (Eds.), Out of Africa I: The First Hominin Colonization of Eurasia. Springer Netherlands, 27–46.&lt;/ref&gt; The  Dmanisi archeological site is the earliest hominin site out of Africa and the analysis of its [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] showed that some hominins, chiefly the ''[[Homo erectus#Homo erectus georgicus|Homo erectus georgicus]]'' had left [[Africa]] as far back as 1.85 million years ago. All of the 5 skulls are roughly the same age.&lt;ref name=article/&gt;

Consequently, the paleontological significance of the [[Radiocarbon dating|dating]] of the Dmanisi skulls is major. It is worth noting that it was not associated with the discovery of skull 5, but with another specimen found at the same site, the [[D2700|Dmanisi Skull 3]], also known as D2700.

== Controversy and significance of the discovery==

The Dmanisi skulls, especially '''Skull 5''' with its comparatively tiny {{convert|546|cm3|in3}} brain compared to other skulls found at the site, suggests that the earliest species of the genus ''[[Homo]]'' were actually subspecies of the species ''erectus''.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; The variation in [[Morphology (archaeology)|morphology]] of all the Dmanisi skulls is so large that had they been discovered on different archaeological sites, they most likely would have been classified as different species. However, all Dmanisi skulls have the same age and have been found at exactly the same place.

Faced with the wide variation between '''Skull 5''' and the other Dmanisi skulls, Georgian and University of Zurich researchers were prompted to examine normal variations in modern human skulls and chimpanzees skulls. They found that while they looked different from one another, the great variations among all Dmanisi skulls were no greater than those seen among modern people and among chimpanzees.&lt;ref name=article /&gt; Consequently, it was entirely possible that such a discrepancy could be found in ''Homo erectus''.

This discovery led the scientists to suggest that two species of early hominins, ''[[Homo rudolfensis]]'' and  ''[[Homo habilis]]'', were actually both ''[[Homo erectus]]''.&lt;ref name=nature /&gt; This is an ongoing debate among the scientific community.&lt;ref name=National_Geographic&gt;{{cite news |last=Switek |first=Brian |date=17 October 2013 |title= Beautiful Skull Spurs Debate on Human History |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/10/131017-skull-human-origins-dmanisi-georgia-erectus/ |newspaper= National Geographic |accessdate=22 September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25795">The '''documentation of cultural property''' is a critical aspect of [[collections care]].  As stewards of [[cultural property]], [[museum]]s collect and preserve not only objects but the research and documentation connected to those objects, in order to more effectively care for them.  Documenting [[cultural heritage]] is a collaborative effort.  Essentially, [[registrar (museum)|registrars]], [[collection manager]]s, [[Conservator-restorer|conservator]]s, and [[curator]]s all contribute to the task of recording and preserving information regarding collections. There are two main types of documentation museums are responsible for: records generated in the registration process—accessions, loans, inventories, etc. and information regarding research on objects and their historical significance.  Properly maintaining both types of documentation is vital to preserving cultural heritage.&lt;ref&gt;Reibel, D. (2008). Documentation. In ''Registration Methods for the Small Museum'', 4th ed. Walnut Creek, CA: Alta Mira Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Arkiv2.jpg|thumb|Historical paper files]]

==History==
[[File:Personal Computer 774.JPG|thumb|Computer databases have become essential to the documentation of cultural property]]
Practices for recording information about museum collections began developing in the late eighteenth century.  Early collection control systems evolved from library prototypes, borrowing the idea of a sequential numbering system and accession ledgers to connect objects and the information about those objects.  In the mid 1900s, formal registration training programs began appearing, and standards for documenting cultural collections were established.  It was not until the late 1990s when computers became commonplace that any other major breakthroughs occurred in the documentation and object tracking methods of museums.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Rebecca A. (2010). History of Registration. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 2-11). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of documentation==
A comprehensive object file contains many different types of documentation, following the object through its life cycle.  Some of the various events or facets of an object's life that require documentation are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;Longstreth-Brown, Kittu &amp; R.A. Buck. (2010). Types of Files. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 150-154). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Accessions===
Acquiring objects, whether temporarily for loan or consideration or permanently for the collection, requires a great deal of documentation.  Once an institution accepts responsibility for the care of an object, certain legal obligations are imposed: the item must be properly stored, maintained, conserved, and made available for the benefit of the public.&lt;ref&gt;Malaro, Marie C. (2012). The Acquisition of Objects--Accessioning.  ''A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections'', (pp. 57-113). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   Documenting activities pertaining to the stewardship of cultural property can be helpful in recording and assessing the fulfillment of these obligations.  Before an object even arrives at an institution, the first piece of documentation produced is an '''Initial Custody Agreement'''.  This document contains contact information for the owner/source of the object; intention for the outcome of this transaction—gift, loan, purchase, or bequest; responsibilities for insurance, packing, and shipping; and a description of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Buck, Rebecca A. (2010). Initial Custody and Documentation.  In R.A. Buck and J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 38-43). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt; If the object is to be formally accessioned into the permanent collection, a '''Transfer of Title''' is also required upon the object's arrival.  The documentation required for a transfer of title could be a Deed of Gift or a sale slip.  As part of the standard accessioning process, '''condition reports''' are also created, numbers are assigned and marked, and photographs can be taken.  These initial documents are the beginning of the object's file.  If supplementary documentation, such as '''Donor and [[Provenance]] Questionnaires''' and research files pertaining to the object's history or context/art historical significance are available, they can be included in the file as well. Documentation of the provenance of a work of art has long been a valuable component of art historical research.  In addition to providing insight into the history of art collecting, it can serve as a way to authenticate an object and determine conservation priorities.&lt;ref&gt;Daly, Karen D. (2010). Provenance Research in Museum Collections. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 62-77). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventories===
The creation and maintenance of a reliable, accurate, and up-to-date [[inventory]] is critical to any collecting institution.  Institutions document their collections in order to preserve them and make them accessible to the public.  Inventories support the responsible stewardship and preservation of cultural property by identifying objects that require conservation, identifying objects that may require improved storage conditions in order to prevent or mitigate deterioration, documenting the location and movement history of an object for security purposes, documenting the collection in the event of a catastrophic loss, enabling and inviting research on the collection, identifying poorly or undocumented objects so that they may be better researched and documented, identifying missing objects so that appropriate action may commence, and facilitating day-to-day management of the collection.&lt;ref&gt;McCormick, Maureen. (2010). Inventory. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 300-306). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because inventories can require a sizable commitment of time and planning from staff, a complete, comprehensive inventory is usually conducted anywhere between every five to ten years.  In between complete inventories, partial inventories and spot checks are conducted.

===Loans and exhibitions===
Other events in an object's life that require standard documentation procedures are loans—both outgoing and incoming—and exhibitions.  Before an object is approved for either loan or exhibition, a '''condition report''' is usually recorded to determine whether the object is fit for travel and display.  Condition reports provide valuable information about an object's state of preservation at a particular moment in time.  They can be conducted by both collections managers/registrars and conservators, and can be crucial in benchmarking the types and/or rate of deterioration and documenting an object's condition history in order to prepare for its care in the future.  Condition reports document any obvious blemishes, instabilities, old repairs, and pre-existing conditions.&lt;ref&gt;Demeroukas, Marie. (2010). Condition Reporting. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp.223-232). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some of the tools needed to conduct examinations and thoroughly document an object's condition are soft lead pencils, examination forms, a camera, a cloth tape measure, clean white cotton or [[nitrile]] gloves, padded muslin rolls and blocks, a flashlight, [[ultraviolet]] light, and magnification.

When considering outgoing loans, institutions can also request a '''General Facility Report''' form to verify that the borrowing museum meets the lending institution's minimum standards of climate control and security.  Once a loan is approved, a '''loan agreement''' is drafted, which is a binding legal document detailing the minimum requirements of care while the object is in the borrower's possession, packing and transportation arrangements, insurance requirements, guidelines for reproduction and credit, and any other special provisions agreed upon by both institutions.  Additional documentation that can accompany travelling objects could also include specific '''packing instructions''' with diagrams and an itemized '''shipping receipt''' or '''[[bill of lading]]'''.  Copies of all of these documents are stored in the exhibition files, as well as the object's permanent file.  An exhibition file could also contain checklists, gallery layouts and lists of object locations, conservation records, computer reports, installation photographs, gallery climate and pest-monitoring records, purchase requisitions, and correspondence relating to the exhibition.

===Conservation treatment===
[[File:Bronze Hui before and after conservation.jpg|thumb|Before and after photographs of a conservation treatment, Bronze Hui sculpture]]
Documenting conservation treatments is a crucial part of managing collections.  There is documentation required pre-treatment, e.g., '''proposals''' and '''examination results'''; documentation required post-treatment--'''reports''' ; and photographs, which visually document the process before, during, and after treatment.  In order to determine the conservation priorities and ideal state of an object, the conservator first consults historical/cultural research and conducts and documents a physical examination of the object.  Physical examinations can be useful in understanding materials composition and causes of deterioration, and when properly documented, can provide a reference for future conservators.  Proposals also document the justifications for the proposed course of action and treatment goals, using both physical and contextual rationale.  Before any treatment begins, the object is thoroughly photographed to document the "before" state.  Once the initial stages of the treatment and cleaning have commenced, more photographs are taken to document the "actual state" of the object, free of compensations and old varnishes.

During treatment, conservators also document the materials they used, reactions that occurred, information on reversibility, etc.  Much of this information can also be summarized in a  '''laboratory master report''', which records information that may not be included in final reports, such as reasoning for methods, factors that determine choice of treatment and changes in methodology, material safety data sheets, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Barbara. (2010). Documentation and Treatment. In ''Conservation Treatment Methodology'', (pp. 379-417). CreateSpace Independent Publishing Platform.&lt;/ref&gt;  Final reports can contain this information as well but in less technical detail.  A final report consists of "after" photographs, a summary of the work completed compared to the goals of treatment, and the conservator's contact information in case future conservators working on the object have questions about the previous work completed.  Any documentation of conservation treatments is also stored in the object's permanent file for ease of accessibility and retrievability.

===Curatorial and art historical information===
Documentation describing the art historical context and significance of an object is important to maintain for research purposes.  Typically curators develop this research and catalog their notes in the object file. They often publish their results as well, in order to advance the field and bring new understanding or interpretations to various art historical subjects.  Many collections professionals benefit from the creation and maintenance of well-organized art historical documentation and research files.  Conservators use this documentation in determining an ideal state for their treatment goals based on artistic intent and historical value.  Collections managers use contextual documentation to determine the best storage and handling methods for objects depending on historical use.  And other curators and researchers use this information to develop exhibitions and to learn about aesthetic and cultural motives, as well as technical qualities of objects.

===Risk management===
Identifying the risks that an institution faces and documenting the policies and measures in place to mitigate those risks is an important aspect of collections stewardship.  Having a comprehensive, written [[emergency response (museum)|'''Emergency response''']] plan and '''[[Integrated pest management]]''' program, improves the museum's ability to minimize overall risk to the collections.  Institutions also transfer the assumption of potential risks through the use of  '''[[Insurance]]'''.  Museums document and track the amount of insurance coverage they carry on each collection and/or object, as well as any specific provisions or exclusions.  Any associated documentation needed for insurance claims, such as [[Art valuation|'''valuations''']] and appraisals can also be kept in the object file.

Another facet of managing an institution's risks, involves diligently documenting and tracking the '''[[copyright]]''' status of each object in the collection.  In order to avoid copyright infringement and costly legal problems, museum professionals develop standard processes for recording and updating copyright statuses of objects.

===Deaccessions===
When an institution decides to deacession a cultural artifact, documentation discussing the process of consideration for this decision is required.  The institution documents the value of the object, the reasons why it is no longer appropriate for the collection; namely: out of context, deteriorated beyond usefulness, duplicate of another object, etc., and how disposal of the artwork will be executed—private sale, auction, donation to another museum, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Martha &amp; Antonia Moser. (2010). Deaccessioning. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore, ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (p. 100-108). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;  Written collecting and deaccession policies and procedures that clearly outline the collection priorities and acceptable rationale for deaccessions are also documented for the museum's records.  This protects the museum from potential backlash when objects are removed from the collection.&lt;ref&gt;Malaro, Marie. (2012) The Disposal of Objects--Documentation Needed to Support Proposed Deaccessions. ''A Legal Primer on Managing Museum Collections'', (pp. 248-272). Washington, DC: Smithsonian Institution Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Documenting contemporary art==
Documenting contemporary art requires a non-traditional approach.  As artists increasingly use more ephemeral materials, installations, and digital content to meet their creative needs, the approach to defining the parameters of these new works and how to document them has necessarily evolved.  "Traditionally, the documentation of artwork has focused on materiality and issues of authenticity.  Materials are undeniably important to the way we understand art.  A working knowledge of and familiarity with various media will allow a registrar to forecast storage needs, foster collections care, and recommend exhibition guidelines...but the conceptual core remains the essence of the work.  The new challenge is how to effectively document a conceptual work."&lt;ref&gt;Schlemmer, Mark B. (2010). Documenting Contemporary Art. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 78-84). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;   New strategies for capturing the conceptual core of contemporary artworks include recording perceptions of the work itself, documenting artist questionnaires and interviews to gain insight into intent and philosophy, and recording videos of installation and de-installation processes.

==Cataloging standards==
Adhering to cataloging standards while creating and maintaining documentation is necessary for uniformity and accessibility.  "Standards not only promote the recording of information consistently but are also fundamental to retrieving it efficiently. They promote data sharing, improve content management, and reduce redundant efforts. In time, the accumulation of consistently documented records across multiple repositories will increase access to content by maximizing research results. Ultimately, uniform documentation will promote the development of a body of cultural heritage information that will greatly enhance research and teaching in the arts and humanities."&lt;ref&gt;Baca, M. et al. (2006). ''Cataloging Cultural Objects: A Guide to Describing Cultural Works and Their Images''. Chicago, IL: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;  Standards can dictate processes like numbering and measuring, as well as data entry methods like choosing which categories of information to include (metadata sets), which words to use (thesauri and authority lists), and how to format data content.

===Numbering and marking===
Numbering and marking an object (usually with the object's accession number) is part of the initial cataloging process, which also includes standard procedures for measuring, photographing, and examining the condition of objects.  Marking an object with its accession number (or temporary number if the object will not become part of the permanent collection) is how the object is identified and linked to its documentation.  In order to track museum collections, to differentiate between permanent, loan, and subsidiary collections, and to provide access to the documentation of objects in the collection, systematic numbering schemes are used and each unique number is marked or tagged on the objects and prominently noted on all documentation associated with the objects.  There are many ways to mark objects with their numbers.  Depending on the type of object and desired permanence of the mark, some of the preferred methods include: archival quality paper tags with pencil, barrier coat with ink or paint, adhered labels, labels sewn with cotton tape, Reemay, or [[Tyvek]], pencil directly on object (recommended for paper and photographs mostly), and Bar codes/[[RFID]] technology.

===Categories and authority lists===
Another way of controlling collections information to promote accessibility is utilizing standard formats of required data elements and preferred terminology when describing and documenting works of art, architecture, and cultural artifacts, as well as their images.&lt;ref&gt;Harpring, Patricia. (2009) ''Cataloging Cultural Objects''. Retrieved April 18, 2015. http://www.getty.edu/research/tools/vocabularies.pdf{{dead link|date=December 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  There are numerous guides available for determining which descriptive information is necessary to an object file and how to format that information for ease of accessibility—Categories for the Description of Works of Art (CDWA), Cataloging Cultural Objects (CCO), etc.  There are also a number of authority lists and thesauri available to documentation professionals, which can be very helpful in choosing preferred terminology in describing cultural objects.  The [[Getty Research Institute]] has created comprehensive vocabularies, including The Art and Architecture Thesaurus (AAT), The Getty Thesaurus of Geographic Names (TGN), The Cultural Objects Name Authority (CONA), and The Union List of Artist Names (ULAN).  Other valuable tools for professionals documenting cultural property are [http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Main_Page CAMEO] and the [http://www.conservation-wiki.com/wiki/Lexicon American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works' Lexicon Project], which are collaborative efforts designed to define and standardize terms used in the description of objects and materials used to conserve objects.

==Documentation management systems==
In order to effectively manage all the documentation required to care for collections, organized systems are necessary.  In the early days of museum registration simple paper ledgers were used to track objects, and documentation was stored in file cabinets.  Since computers became more commonplace however, practices have evolved and very technologically advanced systems now exist to manage all aspects of collection management in one place.&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne &amp; P. Sully. (2010). Computerized Systems. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 161-183). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===CMS===
Implementation of a Collections Management System (CMS) is now customary in museums of all specialties and sizes.  A CMS is a database that can track object locations, prepare exhibition lists, create forms (insurance, shipping, loan, etc.), and organize conservation, publication, exhibition, provenance and curatorial information in files on the computer.  All the data and documentation that was previously stored in paper object files is now entered or scanned into the CMS.  (Paper copies can still be kept for archival purposes.)  A flexible and robust CMS is capable of safely and securely storing information about collections objects, while simultaneously enhancing the capacity to share and disseminate cultural information to vast audiences via the internet.

===DAMS===
Another system that is fundamental to controlling and preserving collections documentation is a Digital Asset Management System (DAMS).  A DAMS is digital archive that can hold resources (images, audio, and text) as well as the metadata used to describe them.  These systems make organization, identification, and retrieval of images and other files more efficient.  DAMS are also easily integrated with CMSs, so that as information on the CMS is cataloged and updated, it automatically synchronizes with the DAMS.

==Preservation==
Creating good, well-organized records is a successful start, but preserving that documentation for the benefit of future generations is also paramount.  Some methods of initiating long-term preservation of both digital and paper files are delineated below.
[[File:Straubing 001 (200).JPG|thumb|Institutional Archive]]

===Archives===
Many institutions maintain archives of their important documents.  Documentation pertaining to the institution itself, as well as collections documentation is stored in the institutional archive or the library.  Sometimes paper copies of collections files are stored offsite for extra safety and security (and for space considerations).  An archive of collections information can have its own collecting policy and arrangement, unrelated to the way documents are organized in the current collections files.  It is up to the [[Archivist]] to decide how to preserve and organize this collection of documents.  Storage requirements for the various types of files in an archive (paper records, photographic material, electronic media, magnetic tape, etc.) are critical to the long-term preservation of the materials.

===Backup===
Information in museum documentation is often duplicated in multiple locations, in order to protect against loss of data.  Backups are performed on a regular schedule and stored in separate systems or locations.  Data can be duplicated and stored automatically on the system server or copied to external media, such as magnetic tape, optical disks, external hard drives, etc.  "For long-term backup, 'live storage' is the most reliable method.  The data are continuously rewritten in multiple electronic or physical locations, ensuring that information is not degrading from the effects of time or the failure of one single piece of hardware."&lt;ref&gt;Quigley, Suzanne &amp; P. Sully. (2010). Computerized Systems. In R.A. Buck &amp; J.A. Gilmore (Eds.), ''Museum Registration Methods 5th Edition'', (pp. 161-183). Washington, DC: AAM Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Data transfer===
Another strategy for ensuring the long-term stability of digital files is to periodically migrate data from one form of media to another—usually from an outdated medium to a more current format.  This process applies to both file formats and storage media.  Simply transferring data from one medium to another, such as from a CD to DVD, without changing the format of the file, is also a form of preservation called '''Refreshing'''.  Documentation of any file conversions or media transfers is stored in the records as well for historical reference.

[[File:Nordkirchen-100415-12272-Trinkender.jpg|thumb|300px|The act of drinking portrayed in statuary—the figure employs a traditional [[waterskin]].]]
'''Drinking''' is the act of [[Ingestion|ingesting]] [[water]] or other [[liquid]]s into the body through the mouth. Water is required for many of life’s physiological processes. Both excessive and inadequate water intake are associated with health problems.

==Methods==

===In humans===
When a [[liquid]] is poured into an open human mouth, the [[swallowing]] process is completed by [[peristalsis]] which delivers the liquid to the stomach; much of the activity is abetted by gravity. The liquid may be poured from the hands or [[drinkware]] may be used as vessels. Drinking can also be performed by acts of [[inhalation]], typically when imbibing hot liquids or drinking from a spoon. Infants employ a method of suction wherein the lips are pressed tight around a source, as in [[breastfeeding]]: a combination of breath and tongue movement creates a vacuum which draws in liquid.&lt;ref name=Flint137&gt;Flint, pp. 137–138.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===In aquatic animals===
[[Amphibian]]s and [[aquatic animal]]s which live in [[freshwater]] do not need to drink: they absorb water steadily through the skin by [[osmosis]].&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;&lt;ref name=Curtis569&gt;Curtis, p. 569.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Saltwater fish]], however, drink through the mouth as they swim, and purge the excess salt through the gills.&lt;ref name=Curtis569/&gt;

===In land animals===
[[File:Cat_lapping_water_off_ground_in_slow_motion.gk.webm|thumb|Slow motion video of a cat lapping water]]
By necessity, [[terrestrial animal]]s in captivity become accustomed to drinking water, but most free-roaming animals stay hydrated through the fluids and moisture in fresh food.&lt;ref name=Mayer59&gt;Mayer, p. 59.&lt;/ref&gt; When conditions impel them to drink from bodies of water, the methods and motions differ greatly among species.&lt;ref name=Broom105&gt;Broom, p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many [[desert animals]] do not drink even if water becomes available, but rely on eating [[succulent plant]]s.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

Cats, canines, and ruminants all lower the neck and lap in water with their powerful tongues.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt; Cats and canines lap up water with the tongue in a spoon-like shape.&lt;ref name=Smith238&gt;Smith, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruminants and most other herbivores partially submerge the tip of the mouth in order to draw in water by means of a plunging action with the tongue held straight.&lt;ref name=Smith237&gt;Smith, p. 237.&lt;/ref&gt; Cats drink at a significantly slower pace than ruminants, who face greater natural predation hazards.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt; Uniquely, elephants draw water into their trunks and squirt it into their mouths.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

Most birds scoop or draw water into the [[Buccal cavity|buccal]] areas of their bills, raising and tilting their heads back to drink. An exception is the common pigeon which can suck in water directly by inhalation.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;

==Hydration and dehydration==
[[File:Drinking Bee2.jpg|thumb|Drinking can be observed in many insect species.&lt;ref name=Broom105/&gt;]]
{{Main|Tissue hydration|Dehydration}}
Like nearly all other life forms, humans require water for [[tissue hydration]]. Lack of hydration causes [[thirst]], a desire to drink which is regulated by the [[hypothalamus]] in response to subtle changes in the body's [[electrolyte]] levels and blood volume. A decline in total [[body water]] is called [[dehydration]] and will eventually lead to death by [[hypernatremia]]. Methods used in the [[management of dehydration]] include assisted drinking or [[oral rehydration therapy]].

An overconsumption of water can lead to [[water intoxication]], which can dangerously dilute the concentration of salts in the body. Overhydration sometimes occurs among athletes and outdoor laborers, but it can also be a sign of disease or damage to the hypothalamus. A persistent desire to drink inordinate quantities of water is a psychological condition termed [[polydipsia]]. It is often accompanied by [[polyuria]] and may itself be a symptom of [[Diabetes mellitus]] or [[Diabetes insipidus]].&lt;ref name=Provan120&gt;Provan, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human water requirements===
A daily intake of water is required for the normal physiological functioning of the [[human body]]. The [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] recommends a daily intake of ''total water'': not necessarily by drinking but by consumption of water contained in other [[beverage]]s and foods. The recommended intake is 3.7 liters (appx. 1 gallon) per day for an adult male, and 2.7 liters (appx. 0.75 gallon) for an adult female.&lt;ref name=USDA2011&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=3&amp;tax_subject=256&amp;topic_id=1342&amp;level3_id=5140 |title=Dietary Guidance |author=[[National Academy of Sciences]] |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |work=USDA Food and Nutrition Information Center |accessdate=31 August 2013 |quote=Redirects to the NAS report, [http://www.iom.edu/Global/News%20Announcements/~/media/442A08B899F44DF9AAD083D86164C75B.ashx Dietary Reference Intakes: Electrolytes and Water] (PDF) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120429140007/http://fnic.nal.usda.gov/nal_display/index.php?info_center=4&amp;tax_level=3&amp;tax_subject=256&amp;topic_id=1342&amp;level3_id=5140 |archivedate=29 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources, however, claim that a high intake of fresh [[drinking water]], separate and distinct from other sources of moisture, is necessary for good health – eight servings per day of eight fluid ounces (1.8 liters, or 0.5 gallon) is the amount recommended by many [[nutritionist]]s,&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/health/treatments/healthy_living/nutrition/healthy_water.shtml |title=Healthy living – Water |author=Greenhalgh, Alison |year=2001 |publisher=[[BBC]] |work=BBC Health |accessdate=31 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although there is no scientific evidence supporting this recommendation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://ajpregu.physiology.org/cgi/content/full/283/5/R993 |title=Drink at least eight glasses of water a day: Really?

==Alcoholic beverages==
{{Main|Alcoholic drink}}
The term “drinking” is often used [[Metonymy|metonymically]] for the consumption of [[alcoholic beverage]]s. Most cultures throughout history have incorporated some number of the [[List of alcoholic beverages|wide variety of "strong drinks"]] into their meals, celebrations, ceremonies, [[Toast (honor)|toasts]] and other occasions.&lt;ref&gt;Gately, pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence of fermented drinks in human culture goes back as early as the [[Neolithic]] Period,&lt;ref&gt;Patrick, Clarence Hodges. ''Alcohol, Culture, and Society''. AMS Press, 1952, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; and the first pictorial evidence can be found in Egypt around 4,000 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hanson|first1=David|title=Ancient Period|url=http://www2.potsdam.edu/alcohol/Controversies/1114796842.html#.VICKF9xH1FI|website=History of Alcohol and Drinking around the World|publisher=State University of New York|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Alcohol consumption]] has developed into a variety of well-established [[drinking culture]]s around the world. Despite its popularity, alcohol consumption poses significant health risks. [[Alcohol abuse]] and the addiction of [[alcoholism]] are common maladies in developed countries worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Status Report on Alcohol and Health|url=http://www.who.int/substance_abuse/publications/global_alcohol_report/msbgsruprofiles.pdf|website=World Health Organization|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=4 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A high rate of consumption can also lead to [[cirrhosis]], [[gastritis]], [[gout]], [[pancreatitis]], [[hypertension]], various forms of [[cancer]], and numerous other illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;Fiebach, p. 387.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Dust and Shadow: An Account of the Ripper Killings by Dr. John H. Watson''''' is a [[Sherlock Holmes pastiches|Sherlock Holmes pastiche]] novel by [[Lyndsay Faye]] which pits [[Sherlock Holmes]] against [[Jack the Ripper]].&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2009/apr/29/entertainment/et-rutten29/2 'Dust and Shadow' by Lyndsay Faye] at ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is Faye's first novel&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lyndsayfaye.com/bio/ Lyndsay Faye bio]&lt;/ref&gt; and it has the blessing of Conan Doyle's heirs.&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

== Title ==
The book takes its name from [[Horace]]'s epigram, "We are but dust and shadow" (''Pulvis et umbra sumus''), which Holmes quotes in the novel.
 
== Summary ==
''In a [[foreword]], writing in 1939, the elderly [[Dr. Watson]] decides to leave his manuscript account of the Ripper killings to his estate for publication after his death.  The account was confidential until then, but Watson feels it important that the true facts be known, since the deceased [[Sherlock Holmes]], for once in his life, was wrong when he predicted that "the world has already forgotten [the Ripper]."''

Holmes and Watson are called to the countryside by [[Inspector Gregson]] to look into the disappearance of a valuable ring from the home of a Baron's family.  The "solution" is unsatisfactory: Holmes deduces that the Baron himself has stolen the ring, having already pawned several items of value to pay for his gambling debts, and even being forced to rob the grave of his prematurely deceased wife.  When confronted, the Baron surrenders the ring, then kills himself in shame.  Holmes claims to Gregson that the case is unsolvable, while planning to return the ring anonymously in the mail, but is nonplussed when one of Gregson's young constables points out clues that Holmes himself took pains to conceal from Gregson.  Returning to [[Baker Street]], Holmes receives an anonymous threatening note.

A few months later, Watson is horrified by the news of [[Mary Ann Nichols]]'s murder and mutilation, but Holmes dismisses it as an isolated incident.  However, when [[Annie Chapman]] is murdered in a similar manner, and [[Inspector Lestrade]] asks for help, Holmes is forced to notice the similarities between the two killings, and predicts that more will follow if the killer is not stopped.  Investigating the murder scenes in [[Whitechapel]], Holmes and Watson meet Mary Ann Monk, a casual friend of Mary Nichols, who agrees to spy on their behalf.  After a few nights, she excitedly claims to have identified the killer, from tavern gossip, as a soldier named Johnny Blackstone, on leave from his regiment.

In spite of their efforts, Holmes, Watson, and the police, are unable to prevent the murders of [[Elizabeth Stride]] and [[Catherine Eddowes]].  Holmes interrupts the killer in the process of murdering Stride, and suffers a near-fatal stab wound without being able to catch the man.  Worse, newspaper stories suggest that Holmes himself is the killer, based on his proximity to each of the murder scenes.  Holmes also receives another anonymous note from the killer, identifying himself as "Jack the Ripper."

Patient investigation leads Holmes to an elementary solution that horrifies Watson, Monk, and Lestrade: "Johnny Blackstone" is a false persona created to throw him off the trail, and the Ripper is actually a policeman, Constable Edward Bennett, able to escape the scenes of his crimes by re-donning his uniform, and able to anonymously supply the newspapers with credible tips about Holmes's whereabouts and activities that make him look guilty.  The Ripper decided that it was vitally important to neutralize Holmes as a threat to him, but by going to such lengths to do so, he has inadvertently revealed his own identity.

Despite this breakthrough, Holmes and Watson's [[stakeout]] only leads them to the site of [[Mary Jane Kelly]]'s murder, with no clues as to Bennett's current whereabouts.  They return home demoralized, but receive a lucky break when Bennett's newspaper contact arrives on their doorstep in a panic, admitting that he followed Bennett to his current hideout, seeing gruesome relics that confirmed he is the Ripper.

Holmes and Watson lie in wait at the hideout, actually the run-down home of Bennett's mother, who is blind and semi-deranged (from her ramblings, Holmes and Watson guess that Edward's madness resulted from his abusive father, and that Edward turned on his father and killed him when Edward was still a child).  Realizing Bennett has left a kerosene fire burning in the basement, Holmes and Watson hustle Mrs. Bennett out of the house just before it explodes into flames.  Realizing from Mrs. Bennett that Edward's latest victim is being held upstairs, Holmes re-enters the home and rescues Mrs. Monk, drugged into a stupor but still alive.  Injured and disoriented, they are confronted by Bennett, who charges at them.  Watson draws his revolver and shoots Bennett dead, before passing out.

The [[Home Secretary]] and Sherlock's brother [[Mycroft Holmes|Mycroft]], fearing a total breakdown of public order if the truth becomes known, order Lestrade to cover up the Ripper's identity, and keep the official investigation open, indefinitely. However, Lestrade privately confirms to the rest of [[Scotland Yard]] that the case is solved.  Knowing that Holmes's role in stopping the killings can never be publicly acknowledged, Lestrade and the detective force privately gift him with a commemorative cigarette case, to replace the one the Ripper took as a trophy.  Holmes is warmed by this heartfelt praise, from law enforcement professionals, more than he ever could be by any official accolades.

==Reception==
Reviews of ''Dust and Shadow: An Account of the Ripper Killings by Dr. John H Watson'' have been largely positive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://foggyfoot.blogspot.com/2009/10/dust-and-shadows-by-lindsey-faye.html |title=Dust and Shadow by Lyndsay Faye |accessdate=5 April 2011 |publisher=The Foggy Foot Review }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/4543979-dust-and-shadow |title=Dust and Shadow: An Account of the Ripper Killings by Dr. John H.

Tim Rutton, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', stated "she gets the critical component – Watson's voice – right."&lt;ref name="latimes"/&gt;

[[Caleb Carr]], who himself penned a Sherlock Holmes pastiche entitled ''[[The Italian Secretary]]'', remarked "Where others have failed, Lyndsay Faye's extremely impressive [[debut novel]] succeeds, on every level, providing thrilling entertainment without blatant exploitation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://books.simonandschuster.com/Dust-and-Shadow/Lyndsay-Faye/9781416583301 ''Dust and Shadows''] at [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chicago Center for Literature and Photography gave the novel an 8.9 out of 10.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cclapcenter.com/2009/07/book_review_dust_and_shadow_by.html ''Dust and Shadow''] at CCLaP&lt;/ref&gt;

There are primary schools on most of the inhabited islands. Secondary schools are located on some of the islands with students travelling to live at their school.

A further 135 students are enrolled at St Joseph’s College in [[Tabwiroa]] and 23 students at Steven Whitmee High School in [[Morikao]], making 370 secondary school students in total.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt; The two high schools at Morikao and Tabuiroa accommodate students from all over Kiribati who have passed the entrance examinations to get into the schools.&lt;ref name="A2012"/&gt;

St. Joseph's College was founded in 1939. Its alumni include both current President [[Anote Tong]], and previous incumbent [[Teburoro Tito]].

There are primary schools and secondary schools operated by the Christian denominations including the [[Roman Catholic Church]] (such as St. Joseph's College) and the [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints|Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], (such as Moroni High School in [[South Tarawa]], of which [[Waitea Abiuta]] has been the headmaster).

The Kiribati Teacher College and King George V and  Elaine Bernachi School, the Government High School, are in [[Bikenibeu]] in [[South Tarawa]].&lt;ref name="ST2012"&gt;{{cite web| last =  | first = | work= Office of Te  Beretitent - Republic of Kiribati Island Report Series|title= 6.

Higher education is expanding; students may seek technical, teacher or marine training, or study in other countries. To date, most choosing to do the latter have gone to Fiji to attend [[University of the South Pacific]], and those wishing to complete medical training have been sent to Cuba.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-172788770.html Pacific Magazine: I-Kiribati Students Perform Well In Cuba], Pacific Islands Broadcasting Association, 24 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of the South Pacific has a campus in Kiribati for distant/flexible learning, but also to provide preparatory studies towards obtaining certificates, diplomas and degrees at other campus sites.

==Schools==
[[Kiribati Ministry of Education]] is the education ministry. Kiribati has 94 elementary schools, 24 junior high schools, and 16 senior high schools.

'''Haplogroup I-M438''', also known as '''I2''' (and until 2007 as I1b), is a human DNA [[Y-chromosome]] [[haplogroup]], a subclade of [[Haplogroup I-M170]]. Haplogroup I-M438 originated some time around 26,000–31,000&amp;nbsp;BCE and has two primary subclades: I-L460, I-L596 and I-L147.

The haplogroup reaches its maximum frequency in the [[Dinaric Alps]] in [[Eastern Europe]] (especially in the [[Balkans]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grasgruber|first=Pavel|last2=Popović|first2=Stevo|last3=Bokuvka|first3=Dominik|last4=Davidović|first4=Ivan|last5=Hřebíčková|first5=Sylva|last6=Ingrová |first6=Pavlína |last7=Potpara|first7=Predrag|last8=Prce|first8=Stipan|last9=Stračárová|first9=Nikola|date=2017-04-01|title=The mountains of giants: an anthropometric survey of male youths in Bosnia and Herzegovina|url=http://rsos.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/4/4/161054|journal=Royal Society Open Science |volume=4|issue=4|pages=161054|doi=10.1098/rsos.161054|pmid=28484621|issn=2054-5703|bibcode=2017RSOS....461054G |pmc=5414258}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Examples of [[basal (phylogenetics)|basal]] I-M438* have been found in males from [[Crete]] and [[Sicily]].

==Origin &amp; prehistoric presence==
Basal I2* (I-M438*) has been found in ancient remains from [[Franchthi cave|Frankthi cave]], in the eastern Peloponnese region of Greece. Along with its modern presence in Crete and Sicily, this may suggest that the haplogroup originated in the Eastern Mediterranean {{citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Haplogroup I2a may be the [[haplogroup]] of the first anatomically modern humans to inhabit Europe, Cro-Magnon. A 2015 study found haplogroup I2a in 13,000 year old remains from the [[Azilian]] culture (at modern [[Bichon]], Switzerland).&lt;ref name="nature.com"&gt;http://www.nature.com/ncomms/2015/151116/ncomms9912/full/ncomms9912.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Haplogroup I2a was the most frequent Y-DNA among western European mesolithic hunter gatherers (WHG) belonging to Villabruna Cluster. A 2015 study found haplogroup I2a in 13,500 year old remains from the [[Azilian]] culture (at modern [[Bichon]], Switzerland). [[Mass migration]]s of Middle Eastern farmers during Neolithic and Indo-Europeans during Bronze Age greatly decreased frequncy of I2 in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.eupedia.com/europe/Haplogroup_I2_Y-DNA.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2017/05/theres-no-such-thing-pure-european-or-anyone-else&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/ancient-dna-reveals-genetic-continuity-between-stone-age-and-modern-populations-in-east-asia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nature.com"/&gt;

Subclades of I2a1 (I-P37.2), namely I-M423 and I-M26 have been found in remains of western European hunter gatherers dating from 10,000 to 8,000 years [[before present]] respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ancestraljourneys.org/mesolithicdna.shtml] Mesolithic Western Eurasian DNA&lt;/ref&gt;

=====I-L621=====
I-L621 is typical of the [[South Slavs|South Slavic]] populations of south-eastern [[Europe]], being highest in [[Bosnia-Herzegovina]] (&gt;50%) in [[Bosniaks]] and [[Croats]].&lt;ref name="Figure 3"/&gt; There is also a high concentration of I-L621 in north-east [[Romania]] and [[Moldova]]. Several groups have determined the common occurrence of this subclade in the [[South Slavic languages|South Slavic]]-speaking populations to be the result of "pre-Slavic" [[paleolithic]] settlement in the region.

===I-M223===
[[Haplogroup]] I2a2a (ISOGG 2014). The age of YSTR variation for the I-M223 [[subclade]] is 13.2±2.7 kya&lt;ref name="familytreedna.com"/&gt; and 12.3±3.1 kya.&lt;ref name="Peter Underhill 2007 pp. 33-42"/&gt; I-M223 has a peak in Germany and another in eastern Sweden, but also appears in [[Romania]]/[[Moldova]], Russia, Greece, Italy and around the Black Sea.&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Chiaroni et al., Y chromosome diversity, human expansion, drift, and cultural evolution, PNAS (2009), [http://www.pnas.org/content/106/48/20174/suppl/DCSupplemental corrected supplementary information].&lt;/ref&gt; Haplogroup I2a2a has been found in over 4% of the population only in [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]], [[Denmark]], [[Scotland]], and [[England]] (excluding [[Cornwall]]) – also the southern tips of [[Sweden]] and [[Norway]] in Northwest Europe; the provinces of [[Normandy]], [[Maine (province)|Maine]], [[Anjou]], and [[Perche]] in northwestern [[France]]; the province of [[Provence]] in southeastern France; the regions of [[Tuscany]], [[Umbria]], and [[Latium]] in [[Italy]]; [[Moldavia]] and the area around Russia's [[Ryazan Oblast]] and [[Mordovia]] in Eastern Europe. Of historical note, both haplogroups I-M253 and I-M223 appear at a low frequency in the historical regions of [[Bithynia]] and [[Galatia]] in [[Turkey]]. Haplogroup I2a2a also occurs among approximately 1% of [[Sardinia]]ns. The subclade divergence for M223 occurred 14.6±3.8 kya (Rootsi 2004).

Haplogroup I-M223 can be further subdivided in several subclades designated in the Y2012 ISOGG tree as follows:
* Haplogroup I-M223 with no further known [[Genetic polymorphism|polymorphisms]],
* Haplogroup I-M284 defined by M284 polymorphism and including an [[undergroup]] Haplogroup I-L126 reserved for individuals derived for the L126/S165, L137/S166 polymorphisms, *Haplogroup I-L701 associated with L701 polymorphism, and Haplogroup I-Z161 denoting individuals derived for the Z161 polymorphism.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}}

====I-M284====
Haplogroup I2a2a1a1 (ISOGG 2014). I-M284 has been found almost exclusively among the population of [[Great Britain]], suggesting that the [[clade]] may have arisen in that island. I-M284 is comparatively rare in [[Ireland]] except in the north-east. In regard to north-east Ireland, the presence of this subclade ''"provides some tentative evidence of ancient flow with eastern areas that could support the idea that the [[La Tene culture]] was accompanied by some migration."''&lt;ref name=mcevoybradley/&gt; Where it is found in those of Irish descent with Gaelic surnames, this suggests an ancestor who arrived in Ireland from Celtic Britain.&lt;ref name=mcevoybradley&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Men with several Gaelic surnames such as McGuinness and McCartan bear this subclade, family groups that have a historically recorded 6th-century common ancestor, thus it is not the result of known recent gene flow between Britain and Ireland.&lt;ref name=mcevoybradley/&gt; While subclades of I-M284 are atypical of Ireland they are relatively common in continental Europe.&lt;ref name=mcevoybradley/&gt; The observed mutational divergence between men with this subclade suggests its foundation very approximately at 300 BC, thus dates and geography are circumstantially but not securely associated with [[Iron Age]] continental Europe.&lt;ref name=mcevoybradley/&gt;

====I-CTS10057====
Continentals. Mother Haplogroup for group I-Z161 (Continental 1 and 2) and I-L701 group (Continental 3). Around 10.000 years old.

=====I-Z161=====
Haplogroup I2a2a1b2 (ISOGG 2014). Z161+ defines the I2 Continental clade (except Continental 3). Its age is estimated around 7,000 years old. It is mainly found in North Europe, especially in Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, and England. In Northwest Sicily it can also be found; this is believed to be due to remnants of a Norman settlement.

=====I-L701=====
Called Continental 3. Continental 3 has a wide distribution. Found in Central Europe from Germany, Austria to Poland, Romania and Ukraine, but also in lower frequencies in Greece, Italy, France, Spain, England, Ireland, and Armenia. It may have been disseminated in part by the [[Goths]]. It is nearly absent from Scandinavia and Scotland.

The '''Head of Nefertem''' (also known as the '''Head from the Lotus Bloom''' or '''Tutankhamun as the Sun God''') was found in the tomb of [[Tutankhamun]] ([[KV62]]) in the [[Valley of the Kings]] in West [[Thebes, Egypt|Thebes]]. It depicts the King ([[Pharaoh]]) as a child and dates from the [[Eighteenth dynasty of Egypt|18th dynasty]] ([[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom]]). The object received the find number of 8 and today is displayed with the inventory number JE 60723 in the [[Egyptian Museum]] in [[Cairo]].

== Discovery ==
The discovery of the Head of [[Nefertem]] is controversial, since [[Howard Carter]] did not document the piece in his excavation journal. The Head was found in 1924 by [[Pierre Lacau]] and [[Rex Engelbach]] in [[KV4]] (the tomb of [[Ramses XI]]), which was used as a storehouse for the excavation efforts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebanmappingproject.com/sites/browse_tomb_818.html|title=KV 4 (Rameses XI)|author=Theban Mapping Project|accessdate=2018-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; among the bottles in a box of red wine.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Hoving: ''Tutankhamun: The Untold Story.'' pp. 318–324.&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, Carter was not in Egypt on account of the strike and closure of Tutankhamun's tomb and the withdrawal or cancellation of the excavation license of [[George Herbert, 5th Earl of Carnarvon|Lord Carnarvon]]'s widow Lady Almina. Carter later stated that he had found the head among the rubble in the entry corridor of KV62.&lt;ref&gt;Zahi Hawass: ''King Tutankhamun. The Treasures Of The Tomb.'' p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; In his first season of excavations, the head was not mentioned; at the time Carter only noted partially broken and full-standing [[alabaster]] vessels and vases of painted clay in the entrance-way. There is not even photographic documentation of the head in the excavation journal as there is for other pieces found in the tomb.&lt;ref&gt;Griffith Institute, Oxford,[http://www.griffith.ox.ac.uk/gri/4sea1not.html ''Howard Carter's diaries and journals. Part 1: October 28 to December 31, 1922. The first excavation season in the tomb of Tutankhamun.'' 25 and 26 November 1922]&lt;/ref&gt; These facts not only led to further disputes in the study of Egyptian antiquities, but also aroused the suspicion in some quarters to this day that Carter had attempted to steal the head.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Austilat, ''[http://www.tagesspiegel.de/kultur/ausstellungen/Archaeologie;art2652,3008610 ''Archäologie: Retter oder Räuber?''] In ''[[Tagesspiegel]]'' 22 January 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==
[[File:Tutankhamun emerging from lotus flower.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Tutankhamun]] as Nefertem emerging from a blue lotus bloom, [[Egyptian Museum, Cairo]]]]
The partially damaged head of Nefertem is carved out of wood and is {{convert|30|cm}} high. The stucco coating is painted red, though large sections have been damaged - Carter attributed this to its seizure by Egyptian authorities in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;The Griffith Institute, Oxford. ''Tutankhamun: Anatomy of an Excavation. The Howard Carter Archives''. "Head of the King", Carter No. 008&lt;/ref&gt; The eyebrows, the typically Egyptian [[kohl (cosmetics)|kohl]] eye liner, and the pupils of the bust were painted in dark blue. The head of the king is completely shaved, but shaven stubble in the form of black paint is visible. The head has Tutankhamun's facial features and depicts him as a child. As on his golden deathmask, Tutankhamun's ears are pierced.

Of all the artefacts found to date, this head is the only depiction of him as a child.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Peter Munro: ''Tutanchamun als Sonnengott.'' In the exhibition catalogue ''Tutanchamun in Köln.'' p. 140.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Significance ==
The sculpture depicts the Pharaoh in the guise of [[Nefertem]], the god of the dawning sun.&lt;ref&gt;I.E.S. Edwards, ''Tutankhamun: His Tomb and its Treasures''. New York: The Metropolitan Museum of Art &amp; Alfred A. Knopf, Inc., 1976, 18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zahi Hawass. ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs''. Washington, DC: National Geographic, 2005, 81&lt;/ref&gt; The child-god [[Nefertem]] springs from a [[Nymphaea caerulea|blue lotus]], which was associated with the revival of the Sun in the morning because its buds close at night and reopen at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Zahi Hawass. ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs''. Washington, DC: National Geographic, 2005, 64&lt;/ref&gt; The blue base of the bust symbolises the primordial waters from which the sun rose at the beginning of creation. The Pharaoh was closely associated with the Sun, but the depiction of him in the guise of this particular solar deity was meant to magically guarantee that the Pharaoh would be reborn once more, just as the Sun is reborn at dawn.&lt;ref&gt;Zahi Hawass. ''Tutankhamun and the Golden Age of the Pharaohs''. Washington, DC: National Geographic, 2005, 15&lt;/ref&gt;

== In Egyptian art ==
Like the depictions of the daughters of [[Akhenaten]] and [[Nefertiti]] found at [[Tell el-Amarna]], the head of Nefertem has the elongated head and neck wrinkles typical of [[Amarna art]]. This suggests that the creation of the head occurred during the [[Amarna period]]. The depiction of the king as a child is among the most beautiful of all [[Egyptian art]] from the end of the 18th dynasty.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; The head of Nefertem has been exhibited in travelling exhibitions of selected original finds from the tomb of Tutankhamun, including, among others, [[Exhibitions of artifacts from the tomb of Tutankhamun#The Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972–1981)|the Treasures of Tutankhamun (1972–1981)]].&lt;ref&gt;Exhibition catalogue ''Tutanchamun in Köln.'' von Zabern, Mainz 1980, {{ISBN|3-8053-0438-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23790">"'''Health 2.0'''" is a term introduced in the mid-2000s, as the subset of [[health care]] technologies mirroring the wider [[Web 2.0]] movement. It has been defined variously as including social media, user-generated content, and cloud-based and mobile technologies. Some Health 2.0 proponents see these technologies as empowering patients to have greater control over their own health care and diminishing [[medical paternalism]]. Critics of the technologies have expressed concerns about possible misinformation and violations of patient privacy,

==History==
Health 2.0 built on the possibilities for changing [[health care]], which started with the introduction of [[eHealth]] in the mid-1990s following the emergence of the [[World Wide Web]]. In the mid-2000s, following the widespread adoption both of the Internet and of easy to use tools for communication, [[social network]]ing, and [[self-publishing]], there was spate of media attention to and increasing interest from patients, clinicians, and medical librarians in using these tools for health care and medical purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The Economist |title=Health 2.0: Technology and society: Is the outbreak of cancer videos, bulimia blogs and other forms of 'user generated' medical information a healthy trend? |date=September 6, 2007 |pages= 73–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Giustini" /&gt;

Early examples of Health 2.0 were the use of a specific set of Web tools ([[blogs]], email list-servs, online communities, [[podcast]]s, search, tagging, [[Twitter]], videos, [[wikis]], and more) by actors in health care including doctors, patients, and scientists, using principles of [[open source]] and user-generated content, and the power of networks and social networks in order to personalize health care, to collaborate, and to promote health education.&lt;ref name="jmir.org"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hughes B, Joshi I, Wareham J | year = | title = Health 2.0 and Medicine 2.0: Tensions and Controversies in the Field | url = http://www.jmir.org/2008/3/e23/ | journal = Journal of Medical Internet Research | volume = 10 | issue = 3| page = e23 | doi=10.2196/jmir.1056}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possible explanations why health care has generated its own "2.0" term are the availability and proliferation of Health 2.0 applications across health care in general, and the potential for improving [[public health]] in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Crespo, R. 2007. [[Virtual community|Virtual Community]] [[Health promotion|Health Promotion]]. Preventing [[Chronic (medicine)|Chronic Disease]], 4(3): 75&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current use== 
While the "2.0" moniker was originally associated with concepts like collaboration, openness, participation, and [[social networking]],&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Eysenbach G [http://www.jmir.org/2008/3/e22/ Medicine 2.0: Social Networking, Collaboration, Participation, Apomediation, and Openness]. J Med Internet Res 2008;10(3):e22&lt;/ref&gt; in recent years the term "Health 2.0" has evolved to mean the role of [[Software as a service|Saas]] and [[Cloud computing|cloud]]-based technologies, and their associated applications on multiple devices. Health 2.0 describes the integration of these into much of general clinical and administrative workflow in health care. As of 2014, approximately 3,000 companies were offering products and services matching this definition, with [[venture capital]] funding in the sector exceeding $2.3 billion in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Krueger; 
Providers, Trackers, &amp; Money: What You Need to Know About Health 2.0 
http://thehealthcareblog.com/blog/2014/01/14/providers-trackers-money-what-you-need-to-know-about-health-2-0/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions ==

The "traditional" definition of "Health 2.0" focused on technology as an enabler for care '''collaboration''': "The use of social software t-weight tools to promote collaboration between patients, their caregivers, medical professionals, and other stakeholders in health."&lt;ref&gt;Adapted from Jane Sarasohn-Kahn's "Wisdom of Patients" report, by Matthew Holt, Last updated June 6, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, [[Indu Subaiya]] redefined Health 2.0&lt;ref&gt;Subaiya/Holt; Introduction &amp; Definition of Health 2.0, Health 2.0 Europe Conference 2011: http://www.health2con.com/tv/?p=2047&amp;viddlertime=572.524&lt;/ref&gt;  as the use in health care of new cloud, Saas, mobile, and device technologies that are:

#Adaptable technologies which easily allow other tools and applications to link and integrate with them, primarily through use of accessible [[Application programming interface|APIs]]  
#Focused on the user experience, bringing in the principles of [[user-centered design]]
#Data driven, in that they both create data and present data to the user in order to help improve decision making

This wider definition allows recognition of what is or what isn't a Health 2.0 technology. Typically, enterprise-based, customized client-server systems are not, while more open, cloud based systems fit the definition. However, this line was blurring by 2011-2 as more enterprise vendors started to introduce cloud-based systems and native applications for new devices like smartphones and tablets.

In addition, Health 2.0 has several competing terms, each with its own followers—if not exact definitions—including [[Connected Health]], [[Digital Health]], [[Medicine 2.0]], and [[mHealth]]. All of these support a goal of wider change to the health care system, using technology-enabled system reform—usually changing the relationship between patient and professional.:
#[[Personalized search]] that looks into the long tail but cares about the user experience
#Communities that capture the accumulated knowledge of patients, caregivers, and clinicians, and explains it to the world
#Intelligent tools for content delivery—and transactions
#Better integration of data with content

==Wider health system definitions==
In the late 2000s, several commentators used Health 2.0 as a moniker for a wider concept of system reform, seeking a participatory process between patient and clinician: "New concept of health care wherein all the constituents (patients, physicians, providers, and payers) focus on health care value (outcomes/price) and use competition at the medical condition level over the full cycle of care as the catalyst for improving the safety, efficiency, and quality of health care".&lt;ref&gt;Last updated on May 25, 2007 Scott Shreeve, MD - January 24, 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Health 2.0 defines the combination of health data and health information with (patient) experience, through the use of ICT, enabling the citizen to become an active and responsible partner in his/her own health and care pathway.&lt;ref&gt;"Patient 2.0 Empowerment", Lodewijk Bos, Andy Marsh, Denis Carroll, Sanjeev Gupta, Mike Rees, Proceedings of the 2008 International Conference on Semantic Web &amp; Web Services SWWS08, Hamid R. Arabnia, Andy Marsh (eds), pp.&amp;nbsp;164–167, 2008, http://www.icmcc.org/pdf/ICMCCSWWS08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Health 2.0 is participatory healthcare. Enabled by information, software, and communities that we collect or create, we the patients can be effective partners in our own healthcare, and we the people can participate in reshaping the health system itself.&lt;ref&gt;Ted Eytan MD, June 6, 2008, http://www.tedeytan.com/2008/06/13/1089&lt;/ref&gt;

Definitions of [[Medicine 2.0]] appear to be very similar but typically include more scientific and research aspects—Medicine 2.0: "Medicine 2.0 applications, services and tools are Web-based services for health care consumers, caregivers, patients, health professionals, and biomedical researchers, that use Web 2.0 technologies as well as semantic web and virtual reality tools, to enable and facilitate specifically social networking, participation, apomediation, collaboration, and openness within and between these user groups.&lt;ref&gt;Eysenbach, Gunther.

== Overview ==
[[File:Swan Health 2.0 model.jpg|thumb|A model of Health 2.0]]
Health 2.0 refers to the use of a diverse set of technologies including [[Connected Health]], [[electronic medical records]], [[mHealth]], [[telemedicine]], and the use of the Internet by patients themselves such as through [[blog]]s, [[Internet forum]]s, online communities, patient to physician communication systems, and other more advanced systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caldwell|first=Aya|last2=Young|first2=Anna|last3=Gomez-Marquez|first3=Jose|last4=Olson|first4=Kristian R.|date=2016-08-01|title=Global Health Technology 2.0|journal=IEEE Pulse|volume=2|issue=4|pages=63–67|doi=10.1109/MPUL.2011.941459|issn=2154-2317|pmid=21791404}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Antheunis|first=Marjolijn L.|last2=Tates|first2=Kiek|last3=Nieboer|first3=Theodoor E.|date=2013-09-01|title=Patients' and health professionals' use of social media in health care: motives, barriers and expectations|journal=Patient Education and Counseling|volume=92|issue=3|pages=426–431|doi=10.1016/j.pec.2013.06.020|issn=1873-5134|pmid=23899831}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key concept is that patients themselves should have greater insight and control into information generated about them. Additionally Health 2.0 relies on the use of modern cloud and mobile-based technologies.

Much of the potential for change from Health 2.0 is facilitated by combining technology driven trends such as Personal Health Records with social networking —"[which] may lead to a powerful new generation of health applications, where people share parts of their electronic health records with other consumers and 'crowdsource' the collective wisdom of other patients and professionals."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Traditional models of medicine had patient records (held on paper or a proprietary [[computer system]]) that could only be accessed by a physician or other [[Health profession|medical professional]]. Physicians acted as gatekeepers to this information, telling patients test results when and if they deemed it necessary. Such a model operates relatively well in situations such as acute care, where information about specific blood results would be of little use to a [[Laity|lay person]], or in general practice where results were generally benign. However, in the case of complex chronic diseases, [[Mental illness|psychiatric disorders]], or diseases of unknown etiology patients were at risk of being left without well-coordinated care because data about them was stored in a variety of disparate places and in some cases might contain the opinions of healthcare professionals which were not to be shared with the patient. Increasingly, [[medical ethics]] deems such actions to be [[Paternalism|medical paternalism]], and they are discouraged in [[Medicine|modern medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bassford|first=H. A.|date=1982-01-01|title=The justification of medical paternalism|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|volume=16|issue=6|pages=731–739|issn=0277-9536|pmid=7089608|doi=10.1016/0277-9536(82)90464-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McCullough|first=Laurence B.|date=2011-02-01|title=Was bioethics founded on historical and conceptual mistakes about medical paternalism?|journal=Bioethics|volume=25|issue=2|pages=66–74|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8519.2010.01867.x|issn=1467-8519|pmid=21175709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A hypothetical example demonstrates the increased engagement of a patient operating in a Health 2.0 setting: a patient goes to see their [[primary care physician]] with a presenting complaint, having first ensured their own [[medical record]] was up to date via the Internet. The treating physician might make a diagnosis or send for tests, the results of which could be transmitted directly to the patient's electronic medical record. If a second appointment is needed, the patient will have had time to research what the results might mean for them, what diagnoses may be likely, and may have communicated with other patients who have had a similar set of results in the past. On a second visit a referral might be made to a specialist. The patient might have the opportunity to search for the views of other patients on the best specialist to go to, and in combination with their primary care physician decides who to see. The specialist gives a diagnosis along with a prognosis and potential options for treatment. The patient has the opportunity to research these treatment options and take a more proactive role in coming to a joint decision with their healthcare provider. They can also choose to submit more data about themselves, such as through a personalized genomics service to identify any [[risk factors]] that might improve or worsen their prognosis. As treatment commences, the patient can track their health outcomes through a data-sharing patient community to determine whether the treatment is having an effect for them, and they can stay up to date on research opportunities and [[clinical trial]]s for their condition. They also have the [[social support]] of communicating with other patients diagnosed with the same condition throughout the world.

== Level of use of Web 2.0 in health care ==
Partly due to weak definitions, the novelty of the endeavor and its nature as an entrepreneurial (rather than academic) movement, little [[Empirical research|empirical evidence]] exists to explain how much Web 2.0 is being used in general. While it has been estimated that nearly one-third of the 100 million Americans who have looked for health information online say that they or people they know have been significantly helped by what they found,&lt;ref&gt;Levy, M. 2007. Online Health. Assessing the Risk and Opportunity of Social and One-to-One Media.  Jupiter Research. Accessed at http://www.jupiterresearch.com/bin/item.pl/research:vision/103/id=98795/ on 20/1/2008&lt;/ref&gt; this study considers only the broader use of the Internet for health management.

A study examining physician practices has suggested that a segment of 245,000 physicians in the U.S are using Web 2.0 for their practice, indicating that use is beyond the stage of the [[Diffusion (business)|early adopter]] with regard to physicians and Web 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;Manhattan Research, LLC. 2007.

== Types of Web 2.0 technology in health care ==
[[Web 2.0]] is commonly associated with technologies such as podcasts, [[RSS (file format)|RSS feeds]], [[social bookmarking]], weblogs ([[health blog]]s), wikis, and other forms of [[many-to-many]] publishing; [[social software]]; and [[web application]] programming interfaces (APIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boudry|first=Christophe|date=2015-04-01|title=Web 2.0 applications in medicine: trends and topics in the literature|journal=Medicine 2.0|volume=4|issue=1|pages=e2|doi=10.2196/med20.3628|pmid=25842175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism of the use of Web 2.0 in health care==
Hughes ''et al.'' (2009) argue there are four major tensions represented in the literature on Health/Medicine 2.0. These concern:&lt;ref name="jmir.org" /&gt;
# the lack of clear definitions
# issues around the loss of control over information that doctors perceive
# safety and the dangers of inaccurate information
# issues of ownership and privacy
Several criticisms have been raised about the use of Web 2.0 in health care.

The '''inscrutability or indeterminacy of reference''' (also '''referential inscrutability''') is a thesis propounded by 20th century [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosopher]] [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] in his book ''[[Word and Object]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, Willard Van Orman (1960): ''Word and Object''. MIT Press; {{ISBN|0-262-67001-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The main claim of this theory is that any given sentence can be changed into a variety of other sentences where the parts of the sentence will change in what they reference{{how?|date=March 2016}}, but they will nonetheless maintain the meaning of the sentence as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/&lt;/ref&gt; The {{cfy|text=referential relation is inscrutable|date=March 2016}}, because it is subject to the {{cfy|text=background language|date=March 2016}} and {{cfy|text=ontological commitments|date=March 2016}} of the speaker.

== Status among Quine's other theories ==
Along with the [[holophrastic indeterminacy]], the inscrutability of reference is the second kind of indeterminacy that makes up Quine's thesis about the [[indeterminacy of translation|indeterminacy of (radical) translation]]. While the inscrutability of reference concerns itself with single words, Quine does not want it to be used for propositions, as he attacks those in another way.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Benjamin Bayer|Bayer, Benjamin]]: [http://www.benbayer.com/quine-skepticism.pdf Quine's Pragmatic Solution to Skeptical Doubts]. July 6, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; He challenges the translation or referential scrutability of whole sentences, proposing his idea of the indeterminacy of translation. In order to accomplish this, Quine makes the statement that there is a so-called holophrastic indeterminacy, which tells that there are always multiple translations of one sentence, {{cfy|text=which are not only different in the meaning of the single parts of them, but moreover is the whole meaning of both translations dissimilar.|date=March 2016}} {{cfy|text=According to Quine, there is no way to give an example for holophrastic indeterminacy, because it affects the whole, and every language. Therefore, one has to blindly accept the validity of this hypothesis, or try to make sense of it via reflecting upon the idea|date=March 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Peter Hylton|Hylton, Peter]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine/#IndTra Willard van Orman Quine]. In: [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], April 9, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; This theory, linked with the inscrutability of reference make up the main characteristics of the indeterminacy of translation.
The inscrutability of reference can also be used in a more extended way, in order to explain Quine's theory of [[ontological relativity]]. We are told that, if we try to determine what the referential object of a certain word is, our answer will always be relative to our own ''{{cfy|text=background language|date=March 2016}}''. Now, as Quine sees it, this idea is not only limited to language, but applies also for scientific questions and philosophical ones. For example, if we are proposed a philosophical theory, we can never definitely {{cfy|text=characterize the [[ontological commitment]]s of it|date=March 2016}}. The most we can do, is to adapt this theory to our current ''background philosophy'', that is {{cfy|text=the theory of which we have already accepted the ontological commitments|date=March 2016}}.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Michael J. Loux|Loux, Michael J.]]: ''Metaphysics – A Contemporary Introduction''. London: Routledge, 3rd edition, 2006, p. 278f.&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this theory, Quine was often regarded as a [[relativism|relativist]], or even a [[scientific skepticism|scientific skepticist]]. He, however, insisted that he belongs in neither of these categories,&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Geert Keil|Keil, Geert]]: ''Quine zur Einführung''. Hamburg: Junius, 1st edition, 2002, 75ff.&lt;/ref&gt; and some authors see in the inscrutability of reference an underdetermination of relativism.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Chris Swoyer|Swoyer, Chris]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/relativism/#2.6 ''Relativism'']. In: [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], February 2, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

== {{anchor|Gavagai}}Illustration by the use of ''gavagai'' ==
In his indeterminacy of translation theory Quine claims that, if one is to translate a language, there are always several alternative translations, of which none is more correct than the other.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Keil (2002), 75ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A [[radical translation]] is therefore impossible. As a special part of this theory the inscrutability of reference indicates that, in trying to find out to which object a certain word (also sentence, sign etc.) of a language refers, there is never only one single possibility. That is even the case, if the possibilities that come into consideration lie very close together. Quine's example of the word "gavagai" is used to illustrate this. Note that it is also applied at the indeterminacy of translation, but has traditionally been introduced to point up referential inscrutability. The ''gavagai'' [[thought experiment]] tells about a linguist, who tries to find out, what the expression ''gavagai'' means, when uttered by a speaker of a yet unknown, native language upon seeing a rabbit. At first glance, it seems that ''gavagai'' simply translates with ''rabbit''. Now, Quine points out that the background language and its referring devices might fool the linguist here, because he is misled in a sense that he always makes direct comparisons between the foreign language and his own. However, when shouting ''gavagai'', and pointing at a rabbit, the natives could as well refer to something like ''undetached rabbit-parts'', or ''rabbit-[[Trope (philosophy)|tropes]]'' and it would not make any observable difference. The behavioural data the linguist could collect from the native speaker would be the same in every case, or to reword it, several translation hypotheses could be built on the same sensoric stimuli. Hence, the reference between the term ''gavagai'' and its referring object is language- or framework-dependent, and therefore inscrutable. Quine regards this discovery as trivial, because it is already a widely accepted fact that all the different things one word might refer to can be switched out, because of their [[proxy function]]s.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Ibid.&lt;/ref&gt;
Quine does not want to show that those native speakers might speak in interestingly different ways and we cannot know about it, but rather that there is nothing to be known. Not only is it impossible to discern, by any method, the correct translation and referential relation of ''gavagai'', but, in fact, there is not even a correct answer to this question.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Loux (2006), p. 274ff.&lt;/ref&gt; To make sense of the word ''gavagai'' either way, the linguist simply has to assume that the native speaker does not refer to complicated terms like ''rabbits-tropes''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Reed Loar|Loar, Reed]]: [http://www.rit.edu/cla/philosophy/quine/inscrutability_reference.html ''inscrutability of reference''].&lt;/ref&gt; The finding, then, that ''gavagai'' means ''rabbit'' is not really a translation, but merely a common sense interpretation.
It is important to note that indeterminacy and inscrutability not only occur in the course of translating something from a native, unknown language into a familiar one, but among every language. This holds also for languages which are quite similar, like [[German language|German]] and [[Dutch language|Dutch]], and even for speakers of the same language. One cannot with certainty say, what exactly his/her conversational partner refers to, when that person is talking about a rabbit. We commonly use the [[homophonic rule]] in those cases, i.e., if one utters ''rabbit'', we assume s/he uses it in the same way we do. But, as has been shown, there are multiple possibilities which can be indistinguishable from one another.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Swoyer (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; This also applies in our own case. We ourselves do not know what it is we are referring to in using the word ''rabbit'', that is because there is, in Quine's word, ''no fact of the matter'' at all. One must not, however, use different possible referential objects in the same translation, because they are incommensurable and the resulting translation hypothesis would contain logical fallacies.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Keil (2002), 75ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-realist interpretation ==
[[Hilary Putnam]] uses Quine's thesis about the inscrutability of reference to challenge the traditional Realist's view that there is a mind-independent world to which our propositional attitudes refer (e.g. when we talk about or think of something, these things exist not in our minds, but in said mind-independent world). This traditional view implies a [[correspondence theory of truth]] and might simply be called [[Realism in international relations theory|Realism]] about [[Being]]. While [[Michael Dummett]] already tried to show that the correspondence theory fails to obtain in some particular cases, Hilary Putnam is far more radical, for he claims that this theory fails in every case it is tried to be applied. On Putnam's account, the idea that we refer with our sentences and statements to a mind-independent, nonlinguistic world is an illusion. Further he claims that the problem to deal with is a language philosophical one and uses Quine's inscrutability of reference theory to clarify his point of view. He suggests, that, because the referential objects of a language are always inscrutable, the Realist's idea of a mind-independent world is fallacious, because it presupposes distinct referential relations from language to objects in the mind-independent world.&lt;ref&gt;cf. Loux (2006), p. 272ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Application in the sorites paradox ==
The inscrutability of reference is also used in the [[sorites paradox]]. The classic example for the sorites paradox mentions a heap of wheat grains of which grains are taken away one by one, until at one time there's only a single grain left. This raises the question of where the line is to be drawn. How long does the heap remain a heap, are two grains still a heap? When one is talking about a heap s/he obviously no proper definition of it ready to hand{{clarify|date=August 2013}}. The referential object of ''heap'' is inscrutable, in the sense that there is no such thing and it is not even necessary for the use of the term ''heap''.&lt;ref&gt;cf. [[Dominic Hyde|Hyde, Dominic]]: [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/sorites-paradox/#4.3 ''Sorites Paradox'']. In: [[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]], January 17, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russophone.png|thumb|right|400px|[[Russophone]]s worldwide, who often use the Internet in Russian language]]

'''Internet in Russian''' (also '''Russian Internet''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|русский Интернет}}), known as '''[[Runet]]'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://slovari.yandex.ru/рунет/Интернет/Рунет/ Интернетско-русский разговорник]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a part of the Internet that uses the [[Russian language]]. Geographically, it reaches all continents, including [[Antarctica]] (Russian scientists on [[Bellingshausen Station]]&lt;ref name="1a"&gt;[http://www.livejournal.ru/themes/id/11797 LiveJournal: Discover global communities of friends who share your unique passions and interests]. Livejournal.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;), but mostly it is based in Russia.

According to reports conducted by [[Yandex]], Russian is the primary language of 91% of Russian websites (in Yandex's list). In the autumn of 2009, Runet contained about 15 million sites (estimated to be about 6.5% of the entire Internet).&lt;ref name="yandex1"&gt;[http://company.yandex.ru/researches/reports/ya_content_09.xml Контент Рунета]. Company.yandex.ru.&lt;/ref&gt;

Domains with a high proportion of the Russian language include [[.su]], [[.ru]], [[.рф]], [[.ua]], [[.by]], [[.kz]].

Russian is used on 89.8% of .ru sites and on 88.7% of the [[former Soviet Union]] domain, .su. Russian is the most used language of websites of several countries that were part of the former Soviet Union: 79.0% in Ukraine, 86.9% in Belarus, 84.0% in Kazakhstan, 79.6% in Uzbekistan, 75.9% in Kyrgyzstan, and 81.8% in Tajikistan.&lt;ref name="w3techs1"&gt;[http://w3techs.com/blog/entry/russian_is_now_the_second_most_used_language_on_the_web Russian is now the second most used language on the web]. W3techs.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
The 59.7 million Russian-speaking Internet users, represent 3% of global Internet users. Russia is ranked 9th in the world&lt;ref name="1a" /&gt; for number of users and 4th (with 4.8%) for number of Russian-language content.&lt;ref&gt;[http://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/content_language/all Usage Statistics of Content Languages for Websites, April 2012]. W3techs.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Russia surpassed Germany as the biggest Internet market in Europe, with 50.8 million users.&lt;ref name="2a"&gt;[http://blogs.ft.com/beyond-brics/2011/11/14/russian-internet-biggest-in-europe-will-earnings-follow/#axzz2aoLvwwxa Russian internet biggest in Europe; will earnings follow? | beyondbrics]. Blogs.ft.com (14 November 2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2013, it was announced that Russian is the second most used language on the web.&lt;ref name="w3techs1"/&gt;

==Researches==
[[Harvard University]]'s [[Berkman Center]] conducts regular researches of Russian language web distinguished by [[Cyrillic script in Unicode|Cyrillic encoding]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/research/russia|title=Impact of the Internet on Russian Politics, Media, and Society - Berkman Klein Center|website=cyber.law.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, there are papers named "Mapping Russian Twitter",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2012/mapping_russian_twitter|title=Mapping Russian Twitter - Berkman Klein Center|website=cyber.law.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Mapping RuNet Politics and Mobilization"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cyber.law.harvard.edu/publications/2010/Public_Discourse_Russian_Blogosphere|title=Public Discourse in the Russian Blogosphere: Mapping RuNet Politics and Mobilization - Berkman Klein Center|website=cyber.law.harvard.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "RuNet Echo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globalvoices.org/-/special/runet-echo/|title=Global Voices · Citizen media stories from   RuNet Echo|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are Russian internet-reviewing newspapers called TheRunet, Runetologia and others.

'''Ironmongery''' originally referred, first, to the manufacture of [[iron]] goods and, second, to the place of sale of such items for domestic rather than industrial use. In both contexts, the term has expanded to include items made of [[steel]], [[aluminium]], [[brass]], or other [[metal]]s, as well as [[plastic]]s.

The term '''ironmonger''' as a supplier of [[consumer goods]] is still widely used in [[Great Britain]], the US equivalent being "[[hardware store]]". Many [[architectural ironmongery]] items (for example, door handles, locks, hinges, etc.) are also manufactured for [[wholesale]] and commercial use in offices and other buildings.

==History==
Dealing in ironware has a long tradition, dating back to the first recorded use of the metal to fashion useful objects as long ago as 1200 BC, and studying the movement of such goods around the world, often over long distances, has provided valuable insight into early societies and trading patterns.

By [[Middle Ages|the Middle Ages]], skilled metalworkers were highly prized for their ability to create a wide range of things, from weaponry, tools and implements to more humble domestic items, and the local [[blacksmith]] remained the principal source of ironmongery until [[Industrial Revolution|the Industrial Revolution]] saw the introduction of [[mass production]] from the late 18th century. In the areas where [[wrought iron|ironware]] and [[Nail (engineering)|nails]] were manufactured, particularly the [[Black Country]], an ironmonger was a manufacturer operating under the [[domestic system]], who put out iron to [[blacksmith|smiths]], nailers, or other metal workers, and then organised the distribution of the finished products to [[retailers]].

In the second half of the 19th century, Victorian ironmongery offered a treasurehouse of appealing metalwork, with elaborate manufacturers’ catalogues offering literally thousands of objects to meet each and every need, almost all of which sought to combine practicality with pleasing design.
[[File:Moir Token.JPG|thumb|left|200px|[[Obverse and reverse|Obverse]] of a penny [[Token coin|token]] of [[Joseph Moir]], advertising "wholesale and retail ironmongery," 1850.]]

The second half of the 20th century saw the steady decline of ironmongers’ shops. Although every small town in Britain used to have at least one, their fate has mirrored that of many traditional emporia. The number of ironmongers has fallen dramatically with the advent of DIY superstores that offer a complete range of ironmongery and associated products under one roof, and more recently the arrival of comprehensive [[mail order]] catalogues and internet suppliers.

However, there has been a simultaneous revival in the fortunes of old-style hand-forged ironmongery, with strong interest in the authentic restoration of period homes leading to demand for items such as traditional iron door handles, [[Doorknob|door knobs]], [[door knockers]], letter plates, locks, hinges, hooks, cabinet fittings and window furniture. There has even been renewed use of  “blacksmith nails” – four-sided hand-made rosehead nails. This is typical of a trend that has seen greater appreciation of designs that have stood the test of time, that has allowed hand-forged ironmongery to find a much wider application than use in property restoration – although the practice of incorporating traditional ironmongery into contemporary housing has been helped by thoroughly modern techniques like galvanising and [[powder coating]] to inhibit [[rust]].

==Other uses of the term 'ironmonger'==

In some areas, "ironmonger" is also slang for an [[arms dealer]], giving rise to numerous fictional characters by the name.

The collection ''[[I, Robot]]'' also contains a linking text at the beginning and end of the book, and in between some (but not all) of the stories, which form a framing story not found anywhere else.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A play by Asimov called ''The Story Machine'', which is an adaptation of his short story "[[Someday (short story)|Someday]]", was published in the February 1958 issue of ''Plays''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/sf_fantasy_story_list.html#The%20Story%20Machine Asimovonline: The Story Machine]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 Asimov wrote a comic strip called "Star Empire" (art by [[Charles Schneeman]]). The first page appeared in the May 1990 issue of ''[[Argosy (magazine)|Argosy]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storypilot.com/asimov2.html Storypilot.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/sf_fantasy_story_list.html#Star%20Empire Asimovonline.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldcat.org/title/argosy-vol-3-no-1/oclc/241309685 WorldCat.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/index/t322.htm#A18329 The Locus Index to Science Fiction, 1984–1998]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Stories never anthologised===

Five published stories were never included in Asimov's own books. They were however included in other anthologies.&lt;ref&gt;"Half-Baked Publisher's Delight" (1974), "[[Getting Even (short story)|Getting Even]]" (1980), "The Turning Point" (1988), "The Lost Dog" (1988) and "Ho! Ho! Ho!" (1989).&lt;/ref&gt;

Nine science fiction stories have never been collected in any book:
*"[[Question (short story)|Question]]" (''Computers and Automation'', March 1955) had an ending which was similar to another author's 1952 story (although the rest of the story was different), and when this was pointed out to Asimov he promised never to publish it again, a promise he kept.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovreviews.net/Stories/Story425.html "Question"] at AsimovReviews.net&lt;/ref&gt; By that time the story had already been reprinted in the April 30, 1957, issue of ''[[Science World (magazine)|Science World]]''.
*"[[The Portable Star]]" (''Thrilling Wonder Stories'', Winter 1955) was Asimov's least favourite story, and was anthologised without his permission&lt;ref name="Asimovonline FAQs"&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/asimov_FAQ.html#literary5 Asimovonline FAQs]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovreviews.net/Stories/Story211.html "The Portable Star" at Asimovreviews.net]&lt;/ref&gt; in a magazine, ''A Treasury of Great Science Fiction Stories'' no. 1 (1964). (It has since been reprinted in ''Thrilling Wonder Stories'', Summer 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?78068 ISFDb]&lt;/ref&gt;)
*"[[A Woman's Heart (short story)|A Woman's Heart]]" (''Satellite'', June 1957) was never collected because of Asimov's disdain for it.&lt;ref name="Asimovonline FAQs"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovreviews.net/Stories/Story312.html "A Woman's Heart" at Asimovreviews.net]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[The Covenant (short story)|The Covenant]]" (''[[Fantastic Story Magazine]]'', July 1960) was a five-part round-robin story to which five different authors contributed. Asimov wrote the second part.&lt;ref name="The Covenant"/&gt; (It was reprinted in a magazine in 1966, ''Most Thrilling Science Fiction Ever Told Number 2''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?80886 ISFDb]&lt;/ref&gt;)
*"[[The Man Who Made the 21st Century]]" (''Boys' Life'', October 1965)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovreviews.net/Stories/Story163.html "The Man Who Made the 21st Century"] at Asimovreviews.net&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[Party by Satellite]]" (''The Saturday Evening Post'', May 1974)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/sf_fantasy_story_list.html#Party%20By%20Satellite Asimovonline: Party by Satellite]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovreviews.net/Stories/Story324.html "Party by Satellite" at Asimovreviews.net]&lt;/ref&gt; (Original title "The Third Dream.")
*"[[Strike! (short story)|Strike!]]" (''Omni'', January 1979) (reprinted in the magazine ''The Best of Omni Science Fiction No. 4'')&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isfdb.org/cgi-bin/title.cgi?93406 Strike! at ISFDb]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[The Super Runner]]" (''Runner's World'', October 1982)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/sf_fantasy_story_list.html#The%20Super%20Runner Asimovonline: The Super Runner]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"[[The Ten-Second Election]]" (''Omni'', November 1984)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/sf_fantasy_story_list.html#The%20Ten-Second%20Election Asimovonline: The Ten-Second Election]&lt;/ref&gt;

20 mystery stories have also never been anthologised.&lt;ref name="Asimovonline: Union Club Mysteries"&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/uc_story_list.html Asimovonline: Union Club Mysteries]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/misc_story_list.html Asimovonline: Miscellaneous story list]&lt;/ref&gt; Of these, all but one are [[The Union Club Mysteries|Union Club]] mystery stories&lt;ref name="Asimovonline: Union Club Mysteries"/&gt; (for a list, see [[The Union Club Mysteries]]). "[[Zip Code (short story)|Zip Code]]" (1986) is a mystery story featuring the boy detective character Larry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asimovonline.com/oldsite/short_fiction_larry_index.html Asimovonline: Larry Mystery Stories Index]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Unpublished stories==

Nine stories which Asimov wrote early in his career were never published anywhere, and are now lost:
# (1938)&lt;ref name="early-asimov-1-14"/&gt; "Cosmic Corkscrew" (9,000 words)
# (1938)&lt;ref name="early-asimov-1-33"/&gt; "This Irrational Planet" (3,000 words)
# (1938)&lt;ref name="early-asimov-1-50"/&gt; "Paths of Destiny" (6,000 words)
# (1938)&lt;ref name="early-asimov-1-50"/&gt; "Knossos in Its Glory" (6,000 words)
# (1939)&lt;ref name="early-asimov-1-105"/&gt; "The Decline and Fall" (6,000 words)

# (1941)&lt;ref name="early-asimov-2-147"/&gt; "Masks" (1,500 words)

In the 1972 anthology ''[[The Early Asimov]]'', Asimov listed two other stories which he thought had also been lost:&lt;ref name="early-asimov-1-appendix"/&gt; "[[The Weapon (short story)|The Weapon]]" (1938) and "[[Big Game (short story)|Big Game]]" (1941). However, they were subsequently found and collected in ''[[In Memory Yet Green]]'' (1979) and ''[[Before the Golden Age]]'' (1974), respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Asimov, I. |date=1980|title=In Memory Yet Green|publisher= Avon |pages= 339–340}} (Originally published by Doubleday, 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Asimov, I. |year=1974|title=Before the Golden Age}} (Orbit Books edition, 1976, pp. 147–148.)&lt;/ref&gt; (They are included in the above list of published stories.)

===Series===
====''Black Tide Rising''====
Series based on a [[zombie apocalypse]], but dealing with living, near-rabid, infected humans rather than the living dead. The story centers around a family of survivalists (mother, father, and two teenage daughters) who get early warning of the plague and escape by boat, only to realize that they are the best hope for others stranded at sea.

====''Paladin of Shadows''====
This is a series of contemporary era [[techno-thriller]]s, much like [[Tom Clancy]]'s works but with less politics and a closer to the ground level and action focus.

Ringo has stated that these novels stem from a nagging idea between contracted books. He believed the concept was too over-the-top and offensive to be of much interest to his usual audience, and so wrote the first book with no intention of publishing it, as a way to get the idea out of his head. However, during interactions with fans, he mentioned the unpublished story and was surprised that the premise was met with enthusiasm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://johnringo.nitro.gen.nz/FAQ/PaladinofShadowsFAQ.aspx |title=Paladin of Shadows FAQ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220201513/http://johnringo.nitro.gen.nz/FAQ/PaladinofShadowsFAQ.aspx |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Paladin of Shadows'' series contain graphic scenes of rape, bondage, torture, and underage sex, as Ringo's protagonist's anti-terrorism missions butt heads with harsh economic realities of commercial sexual slavery in Eastern Europe and its connection to funding arms for terrorist organizations.

The central hero, Michael Harmon (A.K.A. Mike Jenkins, A.K.A. Ghost), is a self-proclaimed [[Sadomasochism|sadist]], repressed rapist, former United States Navy [[Boatswain's Mate (US Navy)|Boatswain's Mate]] [[Petty officer, first class|1st Class]], and [[United States Navy SEAL selection and training|a trainer of US Navy SEALs]]. While walking after a class on the campus of the [[University of Georgia]], he witnesses a woman being kidnapped. He impulsively follows the kidnapper and rescues several abducted women and earns the gratitude of several nations, a small fortune, and a series of high-level political connections in the process of experiencing a life change.  The work is, in fact, three connected anti-terrorism novellas spanning about a year, backstory omitted from the last two, where'' 'Jenkins' ''takes on a certain [[James Bond]]-style sole operator/loose cannon role. The work features scenes involving the interception of two nuclear devices, saving Paris and Washington, D.C., while featuring a travelogue through part of the seamier sides of the Balkans and European parts of the former Soviet Union.
 
In the second work, he buys an estate in eastern Europe (the country of [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] to be specific) that has an entailed ancient warrior tribe, called the Keldera, who bestow on him the honorific "The Kildar" (Warlord, Baron, or similar title). The Keldera aid him in reducing tensions in the Caucasus. Again the book shows a life transition, this time from a sole shooter to a local, politically connected, warlord. In subsequent books, the tribe, now being trained up into a superb light company, goes operational and is employed as a deniable black ops force by the United States for the next several works. By ''A Deeper Blue'', some of the Keldaran force has been trained in both [[Scuba diving|SCUBA]] and [[HALO jump]]s; while ''Tiger by the Tail'' shows the force on an extended training mission in the Pacific gradually being trained ''en toto'' as a force equivalent to U.S. Navy SEAL Teams&amp;mdash;but with Company strength.

Other major/recurring characters in the ''Paladin of Shadows'' series include Charles Adams, a retired SEAL [[Master chief petty officer|Master Chief]], intel specialist and former [[United States Marine Corps|USMC]] Sergeant Patrick Vanner, [[United States Army War College]] graduate Colonel David Nielson, a retired [[Special Forces (United States Army)|Special Ops]] Civil Affairs Specialist who serves as Mike's ''de facto'' Chief of Staff and the only American officer on his senior staff, Captains Kasey Bathlick and Tamara Wilson (call signs Dragon and Valkryie), two Marine Corps helicopter pilots, Captain John Hardesty, a charter pilot for Chatham Aviation in England/former [[Royal Air Force]] Major/[[Squadron leader]] who frequently flies Mike around the globe, Colonel Bob Pierson, the Office of Strategic Operations Liaison at [[the Pentagon]] who serves as one of Mike's primary contacts within the United States government, 2nd Lieutenant Britney "Bambi" Harder, who was rescued by Mike in "Ghost" and by "A Deeper Blue" is a junior intelligence officer at [[United States Special Operations Command]] Headquarters, [[MacDill Air Force Base]], Florida, Anastasia Rakovitch, a [[Sadomasochism|masochistic]] 26-year-old Russian-born woman given to the Kildar by an Uzbek sheikh who now serves as his harem manager, Daria Koroleva, the Kildar's personal assistant, Katya "Cottontail" Ivanova, the sociopathic man-hating whore-turned-spy and assassin, and David and Amanda Cliff, the [[President of the United States|President]] and [[First Lady of the United States]].

'''Latin American art''' is the combined artistic expression of South America, Central America, the Caribbean, and [[Mexican art|Mexico]], as well as Latin Americans living in other regions.

The art has roots in the many different [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous cultures]] that inhabited the Americas before European colonization in the 16th century. The indigenous cultures each developed sophisticated artistic disciplines, which were highly influenced by religious and spiritual concerns. Their work is collectively known and referred to as [[Pre-columbian art]]. The blending of Native American, African and European cultures has resulted in a unique mestizo tradition.

During the colonial period, a mixture of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] traditions and European influences (mainly due to the Christian teachings of [[Franciscan]], [[Augustinian]] and [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] friars) produced a very particular Christian art known as [[Indochristian art]]. In addition to [[Native American art|indigenous art]], the development of Latin American visual art was significantly influenced by Spanish, [[Portugal|Portuguese]],  and French and Dutch [[Baroque painting]]. In turn Baroque painting was often influenced by the [[Italian masters]].

The [[Cuzco School]] is viewed as the first center of European-style painting in the Americas. In the 17th and 18th centuries, Spanish art instructors taught [[Quechua people|Quechua]] artists to paint religious imagery based on classical and [[Renaissance]] styles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museuhistoriconacional.com.br/ingles/mh-e-104.htm The "Cusquenha" Art.] Museu Histórico Nacional. (retrieved 30 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In eighteenth-century [[New Spain]], Mexican artists along with a few Spanish artists produced paintings of a system of racial hierarchy, known as [[casta]] paintings. It was almost exclusively a Mexican form however, one set was produced in Peru. In a break from religious paintings of the preceding centuries, casta paintings were a  secular art form. Only one known casta painting by a relatively unknown painter, [[Luis de Mena]], combines castas with Mexico's [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]; this being an exception. Some of Mexico's most distinguished artists painted casta works, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]]. Most casta paintings were on multiple canvases, with one family grouping on each. There were a handful of single canvas paintings, showing the entire racial hierarchy. The paintings show idealized family groupings, with the father being of one racial, the mother of another racial category, and their offspring being a third racial category. This genre of painting flourished for about a century, coming to an end with Mexican independence in 1821, and the abolition of legal racial categories.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, ''Casta Painting'', New Haven: Yale University Press 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the seventeenth century, The Netherlands had captured the rich sugar-producing area of the Portuguese colony of Brazil (1630–1654). During that period, Dutch artist [[Albert Eckhout]] painted a number of important depictions of social types in Brazil. These depictions included images of indigenous men and women, as well as still lifes.&lt;ref&gt;Dawn Ades, "Nature, Science, and the Picturesque" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820–1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, 64–65.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientific expeditions approved by the Spanish crown began exploring Spanish America where its flora and fauna were recorded. Spaniard [[José Celestino Mutis]], a medical doctor and horticulturalist and follower of Swedish scientist [[Carl Linnaeus]], led an expedition starting in 1784 to northern South America, the expedition is known as the ''Expedición Botánica de Nueva Granada''. Local artists were Ecuadorean Indians, who  produced five thousand color drawings of nature, all being published. The crown chartered expedition whose purpose was scientific recording of the natural beauty and wealth of Nature, was a departure from the long traditional religious art.&lt;ref&gt;Stanton L. Catlin, "Traveller-Reporter Artists and the Empirical tradition in Post Independence Latin American Art" in ''Art in Latin America: The Modern Era, 1820-1980'', London: South Bank Center 1989, pp. 43-45, color plate 3.2 p. 44.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most important scientific expedition was that of [[Alexander von Humboldt]] and French botantist [[Aimé Bonpland]]. They traveled for five years throughout Spanish America (1799-1804), exploring and recording scientific information as well as the attire and lifestyles local populations.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander von Humboldt, ''Voyage de Humboldt et de Bonpland, Première Partie; Relation Historique: Atlas Pittoresque: 'Vues de Cordillères et monuments de peuples indigènes de l'Amérique', Paris 1810.&lt;/ref&gt;  Humboldt's work became an inspiration and template for continuing scientific work in the nineteenth century, as well as traveller reporters who recorded the scenes of everyday life.

===Historiography of colonial art and architecture===
The history of Latin American art has generally been written by those with training in art history departments. However, the concept of "visual culture" has now brought scholars trained in other disciplines to write the histories of art. As with the history of indigenous peoples, for many years there was a focus on either the pre-Columbian period (Olmec, Maya, Aztec, Inca) art production, then a leap to the twentieth century. More recently, the colonial era and the nineteenth century have developed as fields of focus. Visual culture as a field increasingly crosses disciplinary boundaries. Colonial architecture has been the subject of a number of important studies.&lt;ref&gt;George Kubler, ''Mexican Architecture of the Sixteenth Century''. 2 vols.

Colonial art has a long tradition, especially in Mexico, with there being publications of Manuel Toussaint.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Toussaint, ''Arte colonial en México''.  Mexico: Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México, Instituto de Investigaciones Estéticas, 1948. 5th edition 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; In recent years, there has been a boom in publications on colonial art, with some useful overviews being published in recent years.&lt;ref&gt;Damian Bayon and Murrillo Marx, ''History of South American Colonial Art and Architecture''.

==Modernism==
[[File:Cristobal Rojas 01.JPG|thumb|''La Muerte de Girardot en Bárbula'', by Venezuelan painter [[Cristóbal Rojas (artist)|Cristóbal Rojas]], oil, 1883]]
[[Modernism]], a Western art movement typified by the rejection of traditional classical styles. This movement holds an ambivalent position in Latin American art. Not all countries developed modernized urban centers at the same time, so Modernism's appearance in Latin America is difficult to date. While Modernism was welcomed by some, others rejected it. Generally speaking, the countries of the [[Southern Cone]] were more open to foreign influence, while countries with a stronger indigenous presence such as Mexico, Peru, Ecuador, and Bolivia were resistant to European culture.&lt;ref name="Smith"&gt;Lucie-Smith, Edward. Latin American Art of the 20th Century. London: Thames and Hudson Ltd, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

A landmark event for Modernism in the region was, the ''Semana de Arte Moderna'' or [[Modern Art Week]], a festival that took place in São Paulo, Brazil, in 1922, marking the beginning of Brazil's Modernismo movement. "[T]hough a number of individual Brazilian artists were doing modernist work before the Week, it coalesced and defined the movement and introduced it to Brazilian society at large."

==Constructivist movement==
[[File:Discovery of the Land1.jpg|left|thumb|Brazilian artist [[Candido Portinari]],Study for ''Discovery of the Land'' mural at the [[Library of Congress]], Washington, D.C.]]
In general, the artistic [[Eurocentrism]] associated with the colonial period began to fade in the early twentieth century, as Latin Americans began to acknowledge their unique identity and started to follow their own path.

From the early twentieth century onward, the art of Latin America was greatly inspired by [[Constructivism (art)|Constructivism]].{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} It quickly spread from Russia to Europe, and then into Latin America. [[Joaquín Torres García]] and [[Manuel Rendón]] have been credited with bringing the Constructivist Movement from Europe, to Latin America.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

After a long and successful career in Europe and the United States, Joaquín Torres-García, returned to his native Uruguay in 1934, where he heavily promoted Constructivism. Attracting a circle of experienced peers and young artists as followers in Montevideo, in 1935 he founded the Asociación de Arte Constructivo as an art center and exhibition space for his circle. The venue was closed in 1940 due to a lack of funding. In 1943, he opened the Taller Torres-García, a workshop and training center that operated until 1962.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"&gt;Barnitz, Jacqueline. ''Twentieth Century Art of Latin America''.

==Muralism==
{{See also|Mexican muralism}}
[[File:Orozco Mural Omniciencia 1925 Azulejos.jpg|thumb|[[José Clemente Orozco]], Mural ''Omniciencia'', 1925]]Muralism or Muralismo is an important artistic movement generated in Latin America. It is popularly represented by the [[Mexican muralism]] movement of [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Rufino Tamayo]]. In [[Art of Chile|Chile]], [[José Venturelli]] and [[Pedro Nel Gómez]] were influential muralists. [[Santiago Martinez Delgado]] championed muralism in [[Colombia]], as did Gabriel Bracho in Venezuela. In the Dominican Republic, Spanish exile [[José Vela Zanetti]] was a prolific muralist, painting over 100 murals in the country. The Ecuadorian artist [[Oswaldo Guayasamín]] (a student of Orozco), the Brazilian [[Candido Portinari]], and Bolivian [[Miguel Alandia Pantoja]] are also noteworthy. Some of the most impressive ''Muralista'' works can be found in Mexico, Colombia, New York, San Francisco, Los Angeles, Chicago and Philadelphia. Mexican Muralism "enjoyed a type of prestige and influence in other countries that no other American art movement had ever experienced."&lt;ref&gt;Sullivan, Edward. ''Latin American Art.'' London: Phaidon Press, 2000. {{ISBN|978-0-7148-3980-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through Muralism, artists in Latin America found a distinctive art form that provided for political and cultural expression, often focusing on issues of social justice related to their indigenous roots.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

==''Generación de la Ruptura''==
''[[Generación de la Ruptura]],'' or "Rupture Generation," (sometimes simply known as "Ruptura") is the name given to an art movement in Mexico in 1960s in which younger artists broke away from the established national style of Muralismo. Born out of the desire of younger artists for greater freedom of style in art, this movement is marked by expressionistic and figurative styles. Mexican artist José Luis Cuevas is credited with initiating the ''Ruptura''. In 1958, Cuevas published a paper called ''La Cortina del Nopal'' ("The Cactus Curtain"), which condemned Mexican muralism as overly political, calling it "cheap journalism and harangue" rather than art.&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt; Representative artists include [[José Luis Cuevas]], Alberto Gironella, and Rafael Coronel.
                                                                                            [[File:A.Reveron.png|thumb|A.Reveron]]
===Nueva Presencia===
''Nueva Presencia'' ("new presence") was an artist group founded by artists Arnold Belkin and Fancisco Icaza in the early 1960s. In response to WWII atrocities such as the [[Holocaust]] and the atomic bomb, the artists of Nueva Presencia shared an anti-aesthetic rejection of contemporary trends in art and believed that the artist had a social responsibility. Their beliefs were outlined in the Nueva Presencia manifesto, which was published in the first issue of the poster review of the same name. "No one, especially the artist, has the right to be indifferent to the social order."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; Members of the group included Francisco
Corzas (b. 1936), Emilio Ortiz (b. 1936), Leonel Góngora (b.1933), Artemio Sepúlveda (b. 1936), and José Muñoz, Francisco Corzas, and photographer Ignacio "Nacho" López.

===Otra Figuración===
&lt;!-- [[Otra Figuración]] redirects to this heading. --&gt;
''Otra Figuración'' (Other Figuration) was an Argentine artist group and commune formed in 1961, and disbanded in 1966. Members [[Rómulo Macció]], [[Ernesto Deira]], [[Jorge de la Vega]], and [[Luis Felipe Noé]] lived together and shared a studio in Buenos Aires. Artists of Otra Figuración worked in an expressionistic abstract figurative style featuring vivid colors and collage. Although Otra Figuración were contemporaries of Nueva Presencia, there was no direct contact between the two groups.&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; People who are sometimes associated with the group are [[Raquel Forner]], [[Antonio Berni]], Alberto Heredia, and [[Antonio Seguí]].

==Surrealism==
The French poet and founder of Surrealism, [[André Breton]], after visiting Mexico in 1938, proclaimed it to be "the surrealist country par excellence."&lt;ref name="Barnitz"/&gt; [[Surrealism]], an artistic movement originating in post-World War I Europe, strongly impacted the art of Latin America. This is where the mestizo culture, the legacy of European conquer over indigenous peoples, embodies contradiction, a central value of Surrealism.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"&gt;Baddeley, Oriana &amp; Fraser, Valerie. Drawing the Line: Art and Cultural Identity in Contemporary Latin America. London: Verso, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

The widely known Mexican painter [[Frida Kahlo]] painted self-portraits and depictions of traditional Mexican culture in a style that combines [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Symbolism (arts)|Symbolism]] and [[Surrealism]]. Although, Kahlo did not commend this label, once saying, "They thought I was a Surrealist, but I wasn't. I never painted dreams. I painted my own reality."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/9000295/Frida-Kahlo-Surrealist-Conflict&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's work commands the highest selling price of all Latin American paintings, and the second-highest for any female artist.&lt;ref&gt;Moses, Tai. [http://www.metroactive.com/papers/metro/11.09.95/Frieda-9545.html Saint Frida.] ''MetroActive: Books.'' 9 Nov 2005 (retrieved 18 April 2009)&lt;/ref&gt; Other female Mexican Surrealists include [[Leonora Carrington]] (a British woman who relocated to Mexico) and [[Remedios Varo]] (a Spanish exile). Mexican artist [[Alberto Gironella]], Chilean artists [[Roberto Matta]], [[Mario Carreño Morales]], and [[Nemesio Antúnez]], Cuban artist [[Wifredo Lam]], and Argentinean artist [[Roberto Aizenberg]] have also been classified as Surrealists.

==Styles and trends==

===Figuration===
European classical art styles have made a long-lasting impression on the art of Latin America. Into the twentieth century, many Latin American artists continued to be schooled in the traditional 19th-century style, resulting in a continued emphasis on figurative work. Due to the far reach of figuration, the work often spans upon a number of different styles such as [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], [[Pop art]], [[Expressionism]], and [[Surrealism]], only naming a few. While these artists confront issues that range from the personal to the political, many have a shared interest in indigenous issues and the heritage of European cultural imperialism.

===Parody and sociopolitical critique===
[[File:Posada2.Catrina.jpeg|thumb|left|[[José Guadalupe Posada]] (Mexico) ''La Calavera Catrina'']]
Art in Latin America has often been used as a means of social and political critique. Mexican graphic artist [[José Guadalupe Posada]] drew harsh images of Mexican elites as skeletons, [[calavera]]s. This was done prior to the [[Mexican Revolution]], strongly influencing later artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]].
[[File:UsElections Obama Latuff.png|thumb|180px|'' 'McCain - Obama presidential race' '' by Brazilian cartoonist [[Carlos Latuff]]]]

A common practice among Latin American figurative artists is to parody Old Master paintings, especially those of the Spanish court produced by [[Diego Velázquez]] in the 17th century. These parodies serve a dual purpose, referring to the artistic and cultural history of Latin America, and critiquing the legacy of European cultural imperialism in Latin American nations. Two notable artists who frequently employed this technique are [[Fernando Botero]] and [[Alberto Gironella]].

Colombian figurative artist [[Fernando Botero]], whose work features unique "puffy" figures in various situations addressing themes of power, war, and social issues, has used this technique to draw parallels between current governing bodies and the Spanish monarchy. His 1967 painting ''The Presidential Family'', is an early example. The painting, echoing [[Diego Velázquez]]'s 1656 Spanish court painting ''[[Las Meninas]]'' (The Maids of Honor), contains a self-portrait of Botero standing behind a large canvas. The thick, "puffy" presidential family, decked out in fashionable finery and staring blandly out of the canvas, appear socially superior, drawing attention to social inequality.&lt;ref name="BaddeleyFraser"/&gt; According to Botero, his "puffy" figures are not meant to be satirical. He painted a powerful series of canvases, which are based on photos of torture by the U.S. military of Iraqi prisoners at [[Abu Ghraib]] prison.
&lt;!-- [[File:Abughraib.jpg|thumb|Fernando Botero, ''Abu Ghraib,'' 2005, oil on canvas. Botero painted the abuses of [[Abu Ghraib]] between 2004 and 2005 as a permanent accusation]] --&gt;.
: ''The deformation you see is the result of my involvement with painting. The monumental and, in my eyes, sensually provocative volumes stem from this. Whether they appear fat or not does not interest me. It has hardly any meaning for my painting. My concern is with formal fullness, abundance. And that is something entirely different.''&lt;ref name="Smith"/&gt;

Mexican painter and collagist [[Alberto Gironella]], whose style mixes elements of [[Surrealism]] and [[Pop art]], also produced parodies of official Spanish court paintings. He completed dozens of versions of Velásquez's ''Queen Mariana'' from 1652. Gironella's parodies critique the Spanish rule of Mexico by incorporating subversive imagery. ‘’La Reina de los Yugos’’ or "The Queen of Yokes" (1975–81) depicts Mariana with a skirt made of upside-down ox yokes, signifying both Spanish dominance over Mexico's indigenous peoples, and those people's subversion of Spanish rule. The yokes are rendered useless by being upturned. "[Gironella's] hallmark was the use of particular Spanish Grocery cans (sardines, mussels, etc.) in his works, and soda bottle caps nailed or glued around the rim of his paintings."

==Photography==
[[File:GuerrilleroHeroico.jpg|thumb|left|''[[Guerrillero Heroico]]''&lt;br /&gt;Picture taken of [[Che Guevara]] by [[Alberto Korda]] on March 5, 1960, at the [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'']] memorial service.]]

Photographers captured on film, indigenous peoples as well as distinct social types, such as the [[gaucho]]s of Argentina. A number of Latin Americans have made significant contributions to modern photography. [[Guillermo Kahlo]] photographed Mexican colonial buildings and infrastructure, such as the railway bridge at Metlac. [[Agustín Casasola]] himself took many images of the [[Mexican Revolution]], and compiled an extensive archive of Mexican photos. Other photographers include indigenous Peruvian [[Martín Chambi]], Mexican [[Graciela Iturbide]], and Cuban [[Alberto Korda]], famous for his iconic image of [[Che Guevara]]. [[Mario Testino]] is a noted fashion photographer. In addition, a number of non-Latin American photographers have focused on the area, including [[Tina Modotti]] and [[Edward Weston]] in Mexico. Guatemalan national [[María Cristina Orive]] has worked in Argentina with [[Sara Facio]]. Ecuadoran [[Hugo Cifuentes]] has garnered attention.

The '''Latin Grammy Hall of Fame''' is a [[hall of fame]] established by the [[Latin Recording Academy]]  to recognize "early recordings of lasting qualitative or historical significance that were released more than 25 years ago". LARAS is also the same organization that distributes the [[Latin Grammy Award]]s.&lt;ref name="lghof"/&gt; The albums and songs are picked by a panel of recording-arts professionals, such as [[musicologists]] and historians, and selected from all major categories of [[Latin music (genre)|Latin music]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Inaugural Latin Grammy(R) Hall of Fame Inductees Announced|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inaugural-latin-grammyr-hall-of-fame-inductees-announced-71845682.html|website=PR Newswire|accessdate=June 11, 2016|date=August 27, 2001|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160807050954/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/inaugural-latin-grammyr-hall-of-fame-inductees-announced-71845682.html|archivedate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Heraldic achievement}}
The '''law of heraldic arms''' (or laws of [[heraldry]]) governs the "bearing of arms", that is, the possession, use or display of arms, also called [[coat of arms|coats of arms]], coat armour or armorial bearings. Although it is believed that the original function of coats of arms was to enable [[knights]] to identify each other on the battlefield, they soon acquired wider, more decorative uses. They are still widely used today by countries, public and private institutions and by individuals. The earliest writer on the law of arms was [[Bartolus de Saxoferrato]]. The officials who administer these matters are called [[pursuivant]]s, [[herald]]s, or [[King of Arms|kings of arms]] (in increasing order of seniority). The law of arms is part of the law in countries which regulate heraldry, although not part of [[common law]] in England and in countries whose laws derive from English law.

==Right to bear arms==
[[File:Grant of arms2.jpg|240px|thumb|Illustration from a manuscript [[grant of arms]] by [[Philip II of Spain]] to Alonso de Mesa and Hernando de Mesa, signed 25 November 1566.  Digitally restored.]]
According to the usual description of the law of arms, coats of arms, armorial badges, flags and standards and other similar emblems of honour may only be borne by virtue of ancestral right, or of a [[grant of arms|grant]] made to the user under due authority. ''Ancestral right'' means descent in the male line from an ancestor who lawfully bore arms. ''Due authority'' has, since late medieval times, been the Crown or the State.

In the United Kingdom and Commonwealth, the Crown's prerogative of granting arms is delegated to one of several authorities depending on the country. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland, the authority to grant arms is delegated to the Kings of Arms of the [[College of Arms]], under the direction of the [[Earl Marshal]]. In Scotland, this authority is delegated to [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] at his or her own discretion. In Canada, it is exercised by [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]] under the direction of the [[Governor-General of Canada]].

In Ireland, unlike the position in the United Kingdom, a grant of arms from an official authority is not a legal prerequisite to the use of arms.  For example, heraldic symbols and coats of arms that existed pre-1552 and afterwards belonged to the Gaelic tradition may continue in use, as well as arms without any official basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=MacLysaght|first=Edward|title=Irish Families|isbn=0716523647}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Spain, whilst the power to grant new arms is restricted to the king, the [[Cronista Rey de Armas|Cronistas de Armas]] (Chroniclers of Arms) have the power to certify arms within the province(s) of their appointment. As of 2008, there is currently only one, with authority only in the provinces of [[Castile and León]].

==Law of arms as part of the general law==

While the degree to which the general law recognises arms differs, in both England and Scotland a grant of arms confers certain rights upon the grantee and his (or her) heirs, even if they may not be easily protected. No person may lawfully have the same coat of arms as another person in the same heraldic jurisdiction although in England the bearing of identical arms without differencing marks by descendants from a common armigerous ancestor has been widespread and tolerated by the College of Arms.

Although the common law courts do not regard coats of arms as either property or as being defensible by action, armorial bearings are a form of property nevertheless, generally described as ''tesserae gentilitatis'' or insignia of gentility. Armorial bearings are incorporeal and impartible [[hereditament]]s, inalienable, and descendable according to the law of arms. Generally speaking (there have been very rare examples of patents in which the arms are granted to descend with some different limitation), this means they are inherited by the issue (male and female) in the male line of the grantee, though they can be inherited as quarterings by the sons of an [[heraldic heiress]], where there is no surviving male heir, provided her issue also have a right to bear arms in their own male line.

===Ireland===
In Ireland the granting of arms to Irish citizens or to those who can prove Irish ancestry is considered to be a cultural tradition which is allowed through the Office of the [[Chief Herald of Ireland]]. This Office was established under the English Crown in 1552 as the Ulster King of Arms and was converted to the Chief Herald's Office after the 1937 [[Constitution of Ireland]].

The Office of Chief Herald was given statutory force in the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.irishstatutebook.ie/1997/en/act/pub/0011/sec0013.html#sec13&lt;/ref&gt;  However some doubts remained as to the effectiveness of the 1997 Act and proposals for further legislative amendment have been made by individual public representatives.  For example, on 8 May 2006 Senator Brendan Ryan introduced the Genealogy &amp; Heraldry Bill, 2006,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oireachtas.ie/documents/bills28/bills/2006/2306/b2306s.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; in Seanad Éireann (Irish Senate) to this end.

===England and Wales===
In England and Wales, the law of arms is regarded as a part of the laws of England, and the common law courts will take judicial notice of it as such. These dignities, as they are called, have legal standing. But the law of arms is not part of the common law and the common law Courts have no jurisdiction over matters of dignities and [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|honours]], such as armorial bearings, or peerages. In this respect the law of arms was most influenced by the civil law and may be regarded as similar to the ecclesiastical law, which is a part of the laws of England influenced by canon law, but not part of the common law.

In England the exclusive jurisdiction of deciding rights to arms, and claims of descent, is vested in the [[Court of Chivalry]]. As the substance of the common law is found in the judgments of the common law Courts, so the substance of the Law of Arms can only be found in the customs and usages of the Court of Chivalry. However, the records of this are sparse, not least because the Court never gave reasoned judgments (the Lord Chief Justice who sat in 1954 offering the sole exception to this, no doubt because of his professional background as a common law Judge).  The procedure was based on that of the [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]], but the substantive law was recognised to be English, and peculiar to the Court of Chivalry.

Until 1945 coats of arms (engravings, public paintings, etc.) were taxed, with no distinction made in the statute between arms granted by the College of Arms or those which were self-assumed.

===Scotland===
The law of arms as understood in Scotland consists of two principal parts, the rules of heraldry (such as blazoning), and the law of heraldry. In contrast to the position in England, the Law of Arms is a branch of the civil law. A coat of arms is [[incorporeal]] heritable property, governed, subject to certain specialities, by the general law applicable to such property. The possession of armorial bearings is therefore unquestionably a question of property. The misappropriation of arms is a real injury, actionable under the common law of Scotland.

===Canada===
The Canadian law of arms is now regulated by the [[Canadian Heraldic Authority]].

===Denmark===
In Denmark the unlawful use of coats of arms and other insignia of Danish and foreign authorities is a criminal offence (Danish Criminal Code §§ 132-133). Non-official coats of arms are not protected. A specific rendition of a coat of arms is protected through copyright law and a coat of arms can be used as a trademark and will thus be protected by trademark law. There is no official heraldic authority for private arms in Denmark. Most insignia used by municipalities are regulated by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State (an office under the Danish National Archives). Registration by the Heraldic Consultant to the Danish State is a prerequisite for protection of official Danish insignia under the Criminal Code's §§ 132-133. Protection of an insignia in terms of trademark law requires registration by the trademark authorities. If an insignia is registered by the Heraldic Consultant, trademark rights are automatically acquired as well.

During the [[Absolute monarchy|Absolutist]] era, arms of nobility were granted by the King's herald, but this office was dissolved in 1849 when the absolutist era ended. Since then, the only way to acquire coats of arms in Denmark is through assumption.

===Norway===
{{main|Norwegian heraldry}}
The national arms and the royal arms arms sort under the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Norway)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], and military arms are a matter of the heads of each branch of the Norwegian Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen:The Heraldry of the Norwegian Armed Forces,''Genealogica &amp; Heraldica Lisboa 1986'', Lisboa 1989, Vol. 2, p. 179-185&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Archives of Norway]] are the heraldic authority for the royal approbation of [[List of coats of arms of Norway|municipal arms]].&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen: Règles pour utilisation des armoiries communales en Norvège", ''Archivum Heraldicum'' (1-2) 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; Public arms are protected by the [[Penal Code (Norway)|Norwegian Penal Code]], article 328.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovdata.no/all/hl-19020522-010.html#328 Straffeloven, § 328] at [[Lovdata]].&lt;/ref&gt; The same article prohibits as well unauthorised use of foreign public arms and some distinctive signs of international organizations.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen:The Concept of the Coat of Arms in Norwegian Legislation", ''Kongressbericht'', Stuttgart 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

There exists no official authority for private arms and the question of legal protection of private arms has not been asked to a Norwegian legal court.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen:"On taking the family arms of others", ''Genealogica et Heraldica – Wien 14.19. September 1970'' (Congress Report) Vienna 1972
.&lt;/ref&gt; Personal arms, family arms and other private arms have been self assumed in Norway since the Middle Ages, without any grants, interference or protests from the public authorities.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Cappelen: ''Norske Slektsvåpen'', Oslo 1969 pages 25-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Germany===
In Germany the arms relate to a family, and so a name, and not to an individual. The right to the arms passes from the original bearer to those of his legitimate direct descendants by a male line. Since 1918 heraldic affairs are handled under the Civil Law.  The right to arms is now considered analogous to the right to names, expressed in the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch]] § 12; this interpretation was confirmed in 1992 by the [[Federal Court of Justice of Germany]]. Thus, if one has the right to certain arms, that right is protected by the courts. Personal arms are protected as a part of the name if the arms are officially recorded and published.

===Italy===
Speaking very generally, Italian coats of arms may be said to be familial rather than personal. A formal system for indicating cadency is unknown outside the [[House of Savoy]]. In Italy there has been no official regulation of familial coats of arms or titles of nobility since abolition of the [[Consulta Araldica]] in 1948, and that body addressed itself primarily to state recognition of titles of nobility rather than the heraldry of untitled armigers such as nobili (untitled nobles) and patrizi (of the patriciates in the former city-states). Until the unification of the country in the decade leading to 1870, the issuance and use of familial coats of arms was exercised rather loosely in the various Italian states, with each region applying its own laws, and the principal focus was titles of nobility or (before circa 1800) feudal rights. Indeed, upon ennoblement, a count or baron not from an armigerous family might actually assume his own, original coat of arms without recourse to any authority.  For this reason, actual grants of arms were very rare. There is no complete armory of Italian coats of arms, though certain authors, most importantly  [[Giambattista Crollalanza]], compiled references which appear to be nearly complete. Until the establishment of the republic (1946) and its constitution two years later, most coats of arms in Italy appertained to noble families, whether titled or not, although a number of blazons were identified with cittadini (burghers) whose families had used these for a century or more.  The ''Blasonario'' contemplated by the Consulta Araldica would have been an official compilation of blazons (i.e. an armory) but, unfortunately, it was still in a very early draft stage when the monarchy fell in 1946. In 1967 the Constitutional Court ruled that nobiliary and heraldic matters were "outside the scope of the law". Italy's concordat with the [[Holy See|Vatican]] in 1984, revising the [[Lateran Treaties]], abrogated the article whereby Italy recognises Papal titles.

===South Africa===
Under South African law, which is Roman–Dutch, all citizens have the right to assume and bear arms as they please, provided they do not infringe the rights of others (e.g. by bearing the same arms). The [[Bureau of Heraldry]] has the power to register coats of arms to protect against misuse, but registration of arms is voluntary.

===United States===
In the United States protection of coats of arms is for the most part limited to specific units of the armed forces, with a few exceptions. [[George Washington]],  in personal correspondence, expressed opposition to establishment of a national heraldic authority, though he made use of his own ancestral arms. Personal coats of arms may be freely assumed but the right to these blazons is not protected in any way. It is possible that a coat of arms could be successfully protected as a [[trademark]] or [[service mark]], but, in general, such protection is reserved for commercial use as a mark connected with a good or service, and not as a heraldic coat of arms. For example, the [[University of Texas at Austin]] has registered&lt;ref&gt;US Trademark Serial No. 73321841&lt;/ref&gt; its emblem and coat of arms for use in its capacity as an institution of higher education. Moreover, such protection presumes a specific graphic design or work of art, while blazon is a description which may be widely interpreted artistically.  A specific coat of arms could be protected by [[copyright]] as a pictorial, graphic or sculptural work.  The usual requirements of originality and artistic creativity would need to be met; neither notice nor registration is required but may be advisable.

==Enforcement of the law of arms==

===England: Court of Chivalry===
{{main|Court of Chivalry}}
In England the officer with power to adjudicate on legal aspects of the law of arms is the Earl Marshal, whose court is known as the Court of Chivalry. The court was established some time prior to the late fourteenth century with jurisdiction over certain military matters, which came to include misuse of arms.

Its jurisdiction and powers were successively reduced by the common law courts to the point where, after 1737, the Court ceased to be convened and was in time regarded as obsolete and no longer in existence.  That understanding was authoritatively overturned, however, by a revival of the Court in 1954, when the [[Earl Marshal]] appointed the then [[Lord Chief Justice]] to sit as his surrogate.  The Lord Chief Justice Lord Goddard confirmed that the Court retained both its existence and its powers, and ruled in favour of the suit before him.

However, in his judgement (''Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties'' [1955] P 133) Lord Goddard suggested that

:if this court is to sit again it should be convened only where there is some really substantial reason for the exercise of its jurisdiction.

In 1970, [[Arundel Herald Extraordinary]] advised [[Wolfson College, Oxford]] (who were considering whether to invoke a controversial University privilege in order to avoid paying for a grant of arms) that the effect of Lord Goddard’s dictum “must make any further sitting of the court unlikely even for a cause of instance; and the revival of causes of office, which were obsolescent even in the seventeenth century, would be more difficult still.” (quoted in “The Coat of Arms of Wolfson College Oxford” by Dr Jeremy Black ''The College Record'' 1989–90).

In 1984, [[Garter King of Arms]] declined to ask the Court to rule against the assumption of unauthorised arms by a local authority, doubting whether the precedents would give jurisdiction (''A New Dictionary of Heraldry'' (1987) Stephen Friar p 63).

Hence, although the Law of Arms undoubtedly remains part of the law of England, and although the Court of Chivalry in theory exists as a forum in which it may be enforced, there is difficulty in enforcing the law in practice (a point made in ''Re Croxon, Croxon v Ferrers'' [1904] Ch 252, [[Arthur Kekewich|Kekewich]] J).  The absence of a practical remedy for the illegal usurpation of arms in the law of England does not mean that there are no rights infringed, merely that it is not within the jurisdiction of the common law courts to act and that the court that is so empowered does not now sit.

===Scotland: Court of the Lord Lyon===
{{main|Court of the Lord Lyon}}
In Scotland, [[Lord Lyon King of Arms]] is the judge of the Lyon Court, which has jurisdiction over all heraldic matters. An act of the Scottish parliament in 1592 made the unauthorised use of arms a criminal offence and gave Lyon the responsibility to prosecute such misuse, though in practice this might not be legal today. Unlike the Court of Chivalry, the Court of the Lord Lyon is very much alive, and is fully integrated into the Scottish legal system.

==Arms conferring nobility==
In England a grant of arms does not [[Ennoblement|ennoble]] a grantee in itself, but is a recognition of rank or status and, therefore, an authoritative confirmation of it.  An armiger (one who has the right to bear arms) is deemed to be of the status of a [[gentleman]], and in England, many of the suits in the Court of Chivalry were decided on that basis.  He may of course be of higher rank, as [[esquire]], knight, peer, or prince.

In contrast, a coat of arms in Scotland is often, not without controversy, said to be a [[fief]] annoblissant, similar to a Scottish territorial [[peerage]] or [[Scottish feudal barony|barony]]. Under Sir [[Thomas Innes of Learney]] (Lord Lyon King of Arms 1945–1969), wording was introduced into every Scottish [[patent]] of arms which states that the grantee "and his successors in the same are, amongst all Nobles and in all Places of Honour to be taken, numbered, accounted and received as Nobles in the Noblesse of Scotland".  These claims, strongly championed by Innes of Learney himself and by other writers, have now found broad acceptance amongst legal commentators as correctly representing the Law of Arms in Scotland (for example, ''The Stair Encyclopaedia of Scots Law''  (vol. 11, p.&amp;nbsp;548, para. 1613)), but are challenged by others, some of whom are reluctant to place a grant of arms on the same legal plane as a feudal barony or peerage.

In 2008, the so-called nobility clause seen in Scottish grants of arms since the days of Lord Lyon Innes of Learney was dropped and is no longer included in new grants of arms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cheshire-heraldry.org.uk/weblog/2008/07/18/as-he-giveth-so-shall-he-take-away/|title=As he giveth, so shall he take away.|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the European continent, there is a clear difference between noble arms and [[burgher arms]].

In most countries, scholars agree that a coat of arms is an indication of nobility, but that (in times past) simply assuming a coat of arms did not ennoble the [[armiger]]. In certain countries (viz. the Italian states pre-1860), armorial heraldry was not strictly regulated, while titles of nobility were.

As a generality, most nobles, whether titled or not, have coats of arms, hence the widely held perception of heraldry as an aristocratic trapping.

==Assumption of arms==
While in the continent of Europe assumption of arms has mostly remained free, in some countries arms may not be assumed or changed at will. In particular, there is some basis for the claim that it is unlawful to assume arms in England and Wales without the authority of the Crown. This is the view of the College of Arms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college-of-arms.gov.uk/About/12.htm|title=Registering a Pedigree - College of Arms|publisher=|accessdate=5 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is supported by some dicta in court cases, including ''In re Berens'', [1926] Ch. 596, 605–06, and ''Manchester Corporation v Manchester Palace of Varieties Ltd,'' [1955] P. 133 (the only modern decision of the Court of Chivalry). However, there is no holding by a modern court directly on point. For cases considering the question but not deciding it, see ''Austen v. Collins'', 54 L.T.R. 903 (Ch. 1886); ''In re Croxon'', [1904] Ch. 252.

However, the assumption of arms has in every age been common, and became particularly so after the [[College of Arms]] ceased to obtain warrants to search out the illegal use of armory by roving enquiries known as the [[Heraldic visitation|Visitations]], the last of which took place at the end of the seventeenth century.  The interpretation and application of modern legal principles (such as freedom of expression) have also influenced this, and the annual tax on coats of arms was repealed in 1945.

''Burke's General Armory'' (last edition 1884) is said to contain arms attributed to 60,000 families (''The Upper Classes; Property and Privilege in Britain'' J. Scott (1982) p 91).  But it has been calculated that there were only 9,458 armigerous families in 1798 (''The Nobility of the English Gentry'' J. Lawrence (1824)) and a total of 8,320 grants of arms made in the 19th century (''English Nobility:  the Gentry, the Heralds and the Continental Context'' M J Sayer (1979)), which implies, albeit on an extremely rough and ready basis, about 40,000 assumptions of arms.

'''Mill Creek chert''' is a type of [[chert]] found in [[Southern Illinois]] and heavily exploited by members of the [[Mississippian culture]] (800 to 1600 CE).&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI/&gt; [[Artifact (archaeology)|Artifacts]] made from this material are found in [[archaeological site]]s throughout the [[American Midwest]] and Southeast. It is named for a village and stream near the quarries, [[Mill Creek, Illinois]] and Mill Creek, a [[tributary]] of the [[Cache River (Illinois)|Cache River]].&lt;ref name=QUARRY/&gt; The chert was used extensively for the production of utilitarian tools such as hoes and spades, and for polished ceremonial objects such as [[bifaces]], spatulate celts and [[Ceremonial mace|maces]].

==History==
[[File:Cahokia diorama of flint knapper HRoe 2010.jpg|thumb|Diorama at [[Cahokia]] of flintknapper at work on hoes and bifaces]]
''[[Chert]]'' is a [[siliceous]] (silica) stone, a variety of [[quartz]] similar to [[flint]] but more brittle. It naturally occurs as large, flat, elliptically shaped [[Nodule (geology)|nodules]] in [[Creek bed|creek beds]], and sometimes as hill-top [[Residuum (geology)|residuum]]. The nodules were formed as part of the Ullin limestone formation during the [[Mississippian age|Mississippian geologic period]] (roughly 359 to 318 million years ago). Mill Creek Chert is a tough, coarse-grained chert, usually brown or gray in color, and occurs as large tabular shaped nodules, a shape used by members of the [[Mississippian culture]] for the manufacture of broad bifaces such as [[Hoe (tool)|hoes]], [[spade]]s, and ceremonial maces and spuds.&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI&gt;{{Cite web|url= http://www.museum.state.il.us/exhibits/agriculture/htmls/technology/hand_tools/tech_hand_na.html|title=Illinois Agriculture-Technology-Hand tools-Native American Tools|accessdate =2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIUHISTORY&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southernmostillinoishistory.net/mississippian.htm|title= Mill Creek chert, Millstone Bluff, Kincaid Mounds:900 to 1550 AD|accessdate =2010-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, [[archaeologists]] began realizing that in the hilly lands of [[Southern Illinois]]  was the location for the [[quarrying]] and production centers -- one of the greatest in [[Prehistory|prehistoric]] North America for this type of stone.&lt;ref name=QUARRY/&gt; The sites were located near Mill Creek, Illinois, a village in [[Union County, Illinois|Union County]], located between [[Jonesboro, Illinois|Jonesboro]] and [[Cairo, Illinois|Cairo]]  on the [[Alexander County, Illinois|Alexander County]] line.&lt;ref name=SIUHISTORY/&gt; From this collection of sites, known colloquially as the "Indian Diggings", [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]] quarried, worked into tools and [[Blank (archaeology)|blanks]], and exported this stone to the wider Mississippian world. The chert found here was one of the major exported raw materials of the Mississippian culture and its distribution and procurement was one of the largest mining and production efforts organized during the Mississippian period.&lt;ref name=QUARRY/&gt; The raw material was dug up in the quarries and then transported to small hamlets for production in hoes, spades and blanks. Archaeologists believe they were then transported to and traded at regional mound centers such as the Hale Site, a [[palisade]]d village with a [[platform mound]] and a [[burial mound]]. From these local sites they were then transported and traded at sites even further afield. These materials were some of the most widely exchanged items during this period,&lt;ref name=QUARRY&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Quarry to Cornfield-The Political Economy of Mississippian Hoe Production|author=Charles R. Cobb|publisher=[[University of Alabama Press]]|year=2000|isbn=0-8173-1050-9|pages=15–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; with especially large amounts transported to the [[American Bottom]] region. Examples are numerous at [[Cahokia]], where it was especially prized for hoes and spades,&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI/&gt; but finds have been made in locations as distant as  [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] and [[Moundville Archaeological Site|Moundville]].

==Types of use==
[[File:Mill Creek Chert hoe distribution HRoe 2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|A map showing the geographical distribution and frequency of Mill Creek chert finds]]
The most common tools made from Mill Creek chert were digging implements. The physical properties of the stone and its ability to absorb repeated use without breaking as often as other stone, made it especially suitable for these types of tools.&lt;ref name=ILLINOISAGRI/&gt; The Mississippian cultures heavy dependence on [[maize]] agriculture and their monumental architecture ([[platform mound]]s, [[moat]]s and embankments) made such tools especially valuable. Three main varieties of Mississippian culture hoes have been found, differentiated by their shape, oval, flared and notched. The oval and flared varieties were hafted to L-shaped wooden handles, such as the one wielded by the [[Birger figurine]]. The notched version was probably hafted as a spade. Another advantageous property of the Mill Creek chert was the large size of the nodules, which meant that the corresponding tools could be large. Some hoes were up to {{convert|60|cm|in}} in length.&lt;ref name=QUARRY2&gt;{{Cite book|title=From Quarry to Cornfield-The Political Economy of Mississippian Hoe Production|author=Charles R.

The other main use for the chert was large ceremonial bifaces, spatulate [[Celt (tool)|celts]] and stone maces. These were ritual objects which often display a high degree of craftmanship. Unlike the hoes and other utilitarian tools, the ritual objects were often ground and polished to a high degree of finish.&lt;ref name=QUARRY2/&gt; Many [[Southeastern Ceremonial Complex]] artworks depict figures wielding these ceremonial items, especially the sword shaped ceremonial bifaces and maces. As with the hoes, these artifacts could also be quite large, with some of the swordlike bifaces being up to {{convert|50|cm|in}} in length. These ritual objects have been found throughout the [[American Bottom]], the Lilbourn Site in [[New Madrid County, Missouri]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csasi.org/2004_october_journal/2004_selected_pictures_from_the_october_journal.htm|title=Central States Archaeological Societies-Selected Pictures from the 2004 October Journal|accessdate =2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as far away as [[Spiro Mounds|Spiro]] and [[Gahagan Mounds Site|Gahagan Mounds]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/ancestors/early.html|title=Early Caddo, A.D. 800-1200|accessdate =2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caddoan Mississippian culture]] sites in [[Oklahoma]] and [[Louisiana]].

'''Mirambika - Free Progress School''', is an alternative education inspired school that is based on the Integral Philosophy of Sri Aurobindo and The Mother. It is situated at the Sri Aurobindo Ashram campus in New Delhi. The process of learning at Mirambika is based on the view that each individual comes into life with an evolutionary purpose and corresponding potentialities: educating means drawing out this potential.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Balachandran|first1=Kamala|title=Daring to differ|url=http://www.thehindu.com/thehindu/quest/200308/stories/2003080900060400.htm|accessdate=22 February 2016|issue=Quest|newspaper=The Hindu|date=9 August 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the school is not formally affiliated with any board, the students are free to appear for the school leaving examinations conducted by the [[National Institute of Open Schooling]].

==History==
In 1981, Mirambika (Mira, from the name Mira Alfasa of the `Mother,' the disciple of Sri Aurobindo, and Ambika meaning "mother" in Sanskrit) was conceived, in an attempt to implement the educational agenda of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother. It started with 57 children and today, after two decades it has managed to hold the number at under 150.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Mirambika- -Brochure|url = http://www.mirambika.org/Pgcw011.htm|website = www.mirambika.org|access-date = 2016-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Scarification by Lestyn Flye.jpg|thumb|Forms of modern western body modification adopted from "primitive", traditional cultures]]
'''Modern primitives''' or '''urban primitives''' are people in [[Developed country|developed]] and culturally altered [[List of former European colonies|post-colonial nations]] who engage in [[body modification]] rituals and practices while making reference or homage to the [[rite of passage]] practices in "[[primitive cultures]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/12/1210_041210_tattoos_2.html National Geographic - Ancient and Modern Tattoos Celebrated in Photography Book]&lt;/ref&gt; These practices may include [[body piercing]], [[tattooing]], [[play piercing]], [[flesh hook]] [[suspension (body modification)|suspension]], [[corset training]], [[scarification]], [[branding persons|branding]], and [[Self-harm|cutting]]. The motivation for engaging in these varied practices may be personal growth, [[rite of passage]], or [[spirituality|spiritual]] or sexual curiosity.

Roland Loomis, also known as [[Fakir Musafar]], is considered the father of the modern primitive movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/5541 Gauntlet – decorating the Modern Primitive] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070520193215/http://gauntlet.ucalgary.ca/story/5541 |date=2007-05-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1989 [[RE/Search]] book ''[[Modern Primitives (book)|Modern Primitives]]'' is largely responsible{{Clarify|date=May 2009}} for the promotion of the concept of modern primitivism.

'''Moghol''' (or '''Mogholi'''; [[Dari language|Dari]]: {{nq|مُغُلی}}) is a possibly extinct [[Mongolic language]] once spoken in the region of [[Herat]], [[Afghanistan]], in the villages of Kundur and Karez-i-Mulla. The speakers were the [[Moghol people]], who numbered 2,000 members in the 1970s. They descend from the remnants of [[Genghis Khan|Genghis Khan's]] Mongol army stationed in Afghanistan in the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.asiafront.com/news/698/language_of_speaking_in_afghanistan.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the 1970s, when the German scholar Michael Weiers did fieldwork on the language, few people spoke it, most knew it passively and most were older than 40. It is unknown if there are still speakers of the language.&lt;ref name=Weiers&gt;Michael Weiers.  2003.  "Moghol," ''The Mongolic Languages''.  Ed. Juha Janhunen.  Routledge Language Family Series 5.  London: Routledge. Pages 248–264.&lt;/ref&gt;

The language has been strongly influenced by [[Persian language|Persian]] in its phonology, morphology and syntax, causing Weiers to state that it has the appearance of a "true Inner Asian [[creole language]]".&lt;ref name=Weiers/&gt;

==Grammar==
Moghol grammar shows substantial influence from Persian languages, having borrowed even word classes not found in other Mongolic languages: the parts of speech are nouns, verbs, adjectives, pronouns, prepositions, adverbs and conjunctions. 

Nouns are marked for number and case. Verbs are marked for person, number, tense-aspect and mode. Adjectives inflect for the comparative and superlative degree with the Persian suffixes -''tar'' and -''tariin'', but not for number and case. 

===Phonology===
Moghol's phonology is influenced by [[Tajik_language|Tajik]]. It has a system of six vowel qualities with no length contrast: /i e a u o ɔ/.&lt;ref name=Weiers/&gt;

:One sign I give you, if near her you happen to be

:I'm sick and do not care
:I'm sick, but my concern is the love of God
:This disease I give (therefore) no attention.

{{Use mdy dates|date=October 2015}}

The field of [[music education]] contains a number of [[Learning theory (education)|learning theories]] that specify how students learn music based on behavioral and [[cognitive psychology]].&lt;ref name="Taetle 279"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 279. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classical Learning Theory==
While formal music education has roots going at least as far back as the Hebrews in Egypt&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 5"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  or the ancient Greeks,&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 9"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 9.&lt;/ref&gt; challenges arose as music became more specialized and technically complex after the 5th century BCE in Ancient Greece and as the development of notation shifted music education from training in singing to training in music reading.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 24-25"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Educators and theorists such as [[Odo of Cluny]] and [[Guido of Arezzo|Guido d'Arezzo]] in the  10th and 11th centuries explored methods to teach these new developing notational practices.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 24-25"/&gt; Academic interest in music education lessened by the [[Renaissance]] as universities abandoned music as a part of their curriculum in the mid 16th century,&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 29-30"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 29-30.&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[Protestant Reformation]] later brought some changes to music education, [[Martin Luther]] among other individuals suggesting that music, poetry, and history be added to standard education curriculum.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 32"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 32.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 17th century, [[John Amos Comenius]] recommended music education for religious purposes and designed a methodology to do so, as [[Richard Mulcaster]] encouraged universal education including singing and playing as standard curriculum.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 34-36"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 34-36.&lt;/ref&gt; By the 19th century the conservatory model became more common outside of Italy alongside a number of choir schools which provided education as well as practical music experience.&lt;ref name = "Mark and Gary 2007, 38"&gt;Michael L. Mark and Charles L. Gary, ''A History of American Music Education, Third Edition'' (2007: New York: Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education), 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==

Mainstream pedagogy and examination of how students learn theory rose to prominence in the 20th century by theorists and educators beginning with [[Émile Jaques-Dalcroze]], [[Zoltán Kodály]], and [[Carl Orff]], and followed by [[Shinichi Suzuki (violinist)|Shinichi Suzuki]], [[Edwin Gordon]], and [[Valeri Brainin]] among others. Later research into [[learning theory (education)|educational learning theories]] in the 1960s places emphasis on [[Behaviorism|behavioral]], [[Cognitivism (psychology)|cognitive]], and [[Constructivism (philosophy of education)|constructivist]] thinking.&lt;ref name="Taetle 280"&gt;Laurie Taetle and Robert Cutietta, ''Learning Theories as Roots of Current Musical Practice and Research'', 280. [http://www.posgrado.unam.mx/musica/lecturas/educacion/Learning%20theories.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tanglewood Symposium]] of 1967 and the [[Music Educators National Conference]] Goals and Objective Project in 1969 were other early examples of the growing movement of applying modern developments in sequencing curriculum.&lt;ref name = "Taetle 280"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mark"&gt;Mark, M. Contemporary music education (2nd ed.) (New York: Schirmer Books, 1986)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Behavioral learning theories and music education===

[[File:Peeler 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|A fixed blade, Australian and Y peeler]]

[[File:Benutzung eines Kartoffelschäler.gif|thumb|Using a Peeler]]

A '''peeler''' ('''potato peeler''' or '''vegetable peeler''') is a [[List of food preparation utensils|kitchen tool]] consisting of a slotted metal blade attached to a handle that is used to remove the outer skin or [[Peel (fruit)|peel]] of certain [[vegetable]]s, often [[potato]]es and [[carrot]]s, and [[fruit]]s such as [[apple]]s, [[pear]]s, etc. A [[paring knife]] may also be used to peel vegetables.  A peeler differs from a knife in that the blade has a slot cut into it, which is sharpened on the inside edge, while the other side prevents the blade from cutting too far into the vegetable.

==Overview==
There are numerous designs of peelers used today. Most handheld peelers are either straight or Y-type, while the particular designs vary depending on region and personal preference.

==Straight peelers==
A straight peeler has the blade parallel to the handle, resembling a [[knife]]. The blade may be fixed or pivoting. The Lancashire and  French ''Econome'' designs contain a fixed blade which does not pivot. The Lancashire often has a round wooden handle wrapped in string, and is often single edged, though there are dual edged variants. The ''Econome'', invented in 1928 by Victor Pouzet, entails a unique blade design that features two slits.&lt;ref&gt;Néel-Farina, F., "80 ans de corvée de pommes de terre," [[La Montagne (newspaper)|''La Montagne'']], Dec. 23, 2010, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

File:Vegetable peeler 01.jpg|A fixed blade Y peeler, common in China
File:Sparschaeler Rex Star.jpg|Zena Star (top) and Rex (bottom) peelers
&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Swivel peelers===
Swivel peelers have the blade mounted on a pivot.  Thus the angle of the blade is self-adjusted as pressure is applied, increasing ease of use.

The Jonas peeler, designed in Sweden in 1953, is a straight design with a pivoting blade attached to the end of an oblong metal loop handle, which is held like a knife.  A shaft runs through the length of the handle. The blade has two edges to enable use in either direction, and by either hand. While often copied, the original is still made by Linden Sweden.  For many decades, it has been the standard type of peeler in the United States.

==Y peelers==
[[File:Chef uses a Y peeler to peel a lime.jpg|thumb|A chef uses a Y peeler to peel a lime]]
A Y peeler or speed peeler has a blade perpendicular to its handle, a design closely resembling a [[safety razor]].  It is used with a similar action to a razor, shaving off skin in strips parallel to the handle. Most speed peelers have an 'eye gouger' beside the blade, a loop of metal used to dig out eyes and blemishes from the potato.

A particularly famous example of this variety is the Zena Rex peeler, invented in 1947 by Alfred Neweczerzal of [[Davos]], [[Switzerland]].  Considered an icon of Swiss design, it was featured on a 2004 Swiss postage stamp.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissworld.org/en/know/innovation_switzerland/rex_the_king_of_all_vegetable_peelers/&lt;/ref&gt; It has a one piece aluminum handle and a pivoting carbon steel blade with dual edges.  The stainless steel handled variant, the Zena Star peeler, was the model popularized by legendary New York City street hawker [[Joe Ades]].

==Other types==
[[File:Apple peeler with potato 01 Pengo.jpg|thumb|A potato being peeled with a mechanical apple peeler]]
A mechanical apple peeler is a crank operated device that peels apples and optionally cores and slices them in one motion. When the slicer is enabled it cuts a normal apple into a helical shape. It is designed to work on apples but will also peel a number of other fruits and vegetables such as pears, beetroot, potatoes, cucumbers and thick carrots.

==Industrial peelers==

In an industrial setting, potatoes may be peeled using steam jets to loosen the surface skin, followed by a dry abrasion.&lt;ref&gt;Food Industries Manual. 1997. M. D. Ranken, C. Baker, R. C. Kill {{ISBN|0-7514-0404-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The process may also involve treatment with [[lye]] to soften the outer skin. One type of mechanical peeler, the Magnascrubber, tumbles the potatoes on rollers with rubber studs, which removes the skin. Similar tumbling units with variously sized disc-shaped studs are used for peaches, tomatoes, beets and carrots.&lt;ref&gt;Industrial Pollution Control: Issues and Techniques. 1992. Nancy J.

A '''"self-made man"''' (later expanded to include "self-made women") is a classic phrase first coined on February 2, 1832 by United States senator [[Henry Clay]] who referred to the self-made man in the United States senate, to describe individuals in the manufacturing sector whose success lay within the individuals themselves, not with outside conditions. [[Benjamin Franklin]], one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], has been described as the greatest exemplar of the self-made man. Inspired by Franklin's autobiography, [[Frederick Douglass]] developed the concept of the self-made man in a [[Self-Made Men|series of lectures]] that spanned decades starting in 1859. Originally, the term referred to an individual who arises from a poor or otherwise [[disadvantaged]] background to eminence in financial, political or other areas by nurturing qualities, such as perseverance and hard work, as opposed to achieving these goals through [[Inheritance|inherited fortune]], family connections, or other privileges. By the mid-1950s, success in the United States generally implied "business success".

According to the 2017 "World Ultra Wealth Report" by research company [[Wealth-X]], self-made individuals, mainly men, have "largely driven" global "wealth creation" from 1997 through 2017. The report noted that while there are an increasing number of women who are designated as high net worth, most inherited their wealth and only a small percentage sourced their wealth as self-made.

In the intellectual and [[cultural history of the United States]], the idea of the self-made man as an archetype or cultural ideal has been criticized by some as being a [[myth]] or a [[cult]].

==Origins==
[[File:Benjamin Franklin by Joseph Duplessis 1778.jpg|left|thumb|Benjamin Franklin. c. 1785. Oil by Duplessis]]Benjamin Franklin, one of the [[Founding Fathers of the United States]], has been described as "undoubtedly the original self-made man."&lt;ref name="Slate_2014"&gt;{{cite news|last=Swansburg|first=John|title=The Self-Made Man: The story of America’s most pliable, pernicious, irrepressible myth |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/history/2014/09/the_self_made_man_history_of_a_myth_from_ben_franklin_to_andrew_carnegie.html|work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]|date=September 29, 2014 |access-date=November 12, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the greatest exemplar of the "self-made man".&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt; Both the [[American Dream]] and the self-made man concepts are inextricably linked and are rooted in American history. Franklin's autobiography was described by the editor of the 1916 edition, as the "most remarkable of all the remarkable histories of our self-made men".&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt; His autobiography, which was dedicated to his son [[William Franklin]], with the first chapter based on a 1771 letter to William,&lt;ref name="Franklin_HarvardClassics"&gt;{{Citation| title = Benjamin Franklin, his autobiography| last = Franklin | first = Benjamin| publisher = P.F.

Franklin's introduced the archetypal self-made man through his own life story in which in spite of all odds he overcame his low and humble origins and inherited social position—his father was candle-maker—to re-invent himself through self-improvement based on a set of strong moral values such as "industry, economy, and perseverance"&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt;{{rp|143}} thereby attaining "eminence" in the classic rags to riches narrative. Franklin's maxims as published in his ''Autobiography'' provide others, specifically his own son, with strategies for attaining status in the United States, described as a "land of unequaled opportunity" in the last quarter of the 18th century.&lt;ref name="Franklin_HarvardClassics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pine_1916_BFB_HR_GP"/&gt;{{rp|143}}

In his 1954 book entitled ''The Self-Made Man in America: The Myth of Rags to Riches'', Irvin G.

If it were true, would gentlemen prefer ·supporting foreign accumulations of wealth, by that description of industry, rather than their own country? But is it correct? The joint stock companies of the North, as I understand them, are nothing more than associations, sometimes of hundreds, by means of which the small earnings of many are brought into a common stock; and the associates, obtaining corporate privileges, are enabled to prosecute, under one superintending head, their business to better advantage. Nothing can be more essentially democratic, or better devised to counterpoise the influence of individual wealth. In Kentucky, almost every manufactory known to me is in the hands of enterprising self-made men, who have acquired whatever wealth they possess by patient and diligent labor. Comparisons are odious, and, but in defence, would not be made by me. But is there more tendency to aristocracy in a manufactory, supporting hundreds of freemen, or in a cotton plantation, with its not less numerous slaves, sustaining, perhaps, only two white families-that of the master and the overseer?}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|100}}

One cannot be “made” by the help of a father, teacher, mentor, etc.…, but must rise by one’s own grit, determination, discipline, and opportunism. The irony is that they have made themselves free from bounds and possessions, in a sense impoverished, so that they can then begin to acquire power and wealth on their own. The key is to acquire those possessions and power without help.

[[File:Frederick Douglass, head-and-shoulders portrait, facing right, ca 1850-1860 edit.jpg|left|thumb|Frederick Douglass, photographed between 1850 and 1860.]]Frederick Douglass developed the concepts in a series of lectures "[[Self-Made Men]]" from 1859 onward, for example 1895,&lt;ref name="Douglass_1895_selfmademen"&gt;{{cite web |series=The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress: Speech, Article, and Book File |title=Self-Made Men: Address before the Students of the Indian Industrial School |quote="Self-made men […] are the men who owe little or nothing to birth, relationship, friendly surroundings; to wealth inherited or to early approved means of education; who are what they are, without the aid of any of the favoring conditions by which other men usually rise in the world and achieve great results."|location=Carlisle, Pennsylvania |agency=Library of Congress |year=1895}}Folder 1 of 16 (Series: Speech, Article, and Book File—B: Frederick Douglass, Undated)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|549–50}} which were published and archived in "The Frederick Douglass Papers at the Library of Congress".

{{Sex differences}}
'''Sex differences in humans''' have been studied in a variety of fields. In humans, [[biological sex]] is determined by five factors present at birth: the presence or absence of a [[Y chromosome]], the type of [[gonad]]s, the [[Sex steroid|sex hormones]], the internal reproductive anatomy (such as the [[uterus]]), and the [[Human genitalia|external genitalia]].&lt;ref name="KnoxSchacht2011"&gt;Knox, David; Schacht, Caroline. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=iVOXAp27iQkC&amp;pg=PT64 Choices in Relationships: An Introduction to Marriage and the Family]''. 11 ed. Cengage Learning; 2011-10-10 [cited 17 June 2013]. {{ISBN|9781111833220}}. p. 64–66.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Genetic sex]] is determined solely by the presence or absence of a Y chromosome. 

Sex differences generally refer to traits that are [[sexually dimorphic]]. A subset of such differences is hypothesized to be the product of the evolutionary process of [[sexual selection]].&lt;ref name="Mealey, L. 2000"&gt;Mealey, L.  (2000). Sex differences. NY: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geary, D. C. (2009) Male, Female: The Evolution of Human Sex Differences.  Washington, D.C.: American Psychological Association&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medicine==
{{main|Sex differences in medicine}}
Sex differences in medicine include sex-specific diseases, which are [[disease]]s that occur ''only'' in people of one [[sex]]; and sex-related diseases, which are diseases that are more usual to one sex, or which manifest differently in each sex. For example, certain [[autoimmune disease]]s may occur predominantly in one sex, for unknown reasons. 90% of [[primary biliary cirrhosis]] cases are women, whereas [[primary sclerosing cholangitis]] is more common in men. Gender-based medicine, also called "gender medicine", is the field of medicine that studies the biological and physiological differences between the human sexes and how that affects differences in disease. Traditionally, medical research has mostly been conducted using the male body as the basis for clinical studies. Similar findings are also reported in the sport medicine literature where males typically account for &gt;60% of the individuals studied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Where are all the female participants in Sports and Exercise Medicine research?|journal = European Journal of Sport Science|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1536-7290|pmid = 24766579|pages = 847–851|volume = 14|issue = 8|doi = 10.1080/17461391.2014.911354|first = Joseph T.|last = Costello|first2 = Francois|last2 = Bieuzen|first3 = Chris M.|last3 = Bleakley}}&lt;/ref&gt; The findings of these studies have often been applied across the sexes and healthcare providers have assumed a uniform approach in treating both male and female patients. More recently, medical research has started to understand the importance of taking the sex into account as the symptoms and responses to medical treatment may be very different between sexes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.columbia-stmarys.org/19301.cfm |title=Women, Men, and Medicine: We're Not Equal |author1=Cuozzo, Karen |author2=Bratman, Steven (reviewer) |publisher=EBSCO Publishing |date=September 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710061518/http://www.columbia-stmarys.org/19301.cfm |archivedate=July 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neither concept should be confused with [[sexually transmitted disease]]s, which are diseases that have a significant probability of transmission through sexual contact.

Sex-related illnesses have various causes:{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}
* [[Sex-linked]] genetic illnesses
* Parts of the [[reproductive system]] that are specific to one sex
* Social causes that relate to the [[gender role]] expected of that sex in a particular society.
* Different levels of prevention, reporting, diagnosis or treatment in each gender.

==Physiology==
{{main|Sex differences in human physiology}}
Sex differences in human physiology are distinctions of physiological characteristics associated with either male or female humans. These can be of several types, including direct and indirect. Direct being the direct result of differences prescribed by the Y-chromosome, and indirect being a characteristic influenced indirectly (e.g., hormonally) by the Y-chromosome. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is a term for the [[phenotype|phenotypic]] difference between males and females of the same species.

Direct sex differences follow a [[bimodal distribution]]. Through the process of [[meiosis]] and [[fertilization]] (with rare exceptions), each individual is created with zero or one Y-chromosome. The complementary result for the X-chromosome follows, either a double or a single X. Therefore, direct sex differences are usually binary in expression (although the deviations in complex biological processes produce a menagerie of exceptions). These include, most conspicuously, male (vs female) [[gonads]].

Indirect sex differences are general differences as quantified by [[empirical data]] and [[statistics|statistical]] analysis. Most differing characteristics will conform to a [[bell distribution|bell-curve]] (i.e., normal) distribution which can be broadly described by the mean (peak distribution) and standard deviation (indicator of size of range). Often only the mean or mean difference between sexes is given. This may or may not preclude overlap in distributions. For example, most [[males]] are taller and stronger than [[females]],&lt;ref name="Gustafsson"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gustafsson A, Lindenfors P|lastauthoramp=yes | year=2004 | title=Human size evolution: no allometric relationship between male and female stature | journal=Journal of Human Evolution | volume=47 | pages=253–266 | doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2004.07.004 | pmid=15454336 | issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but an individual female could be taller and stronger than an individual male. The extents of these differences vary across societies.&lt;ref name="Birke, Lydia 2001"&gt;Birke, Lydia. The Gender and Science Reader ed. Muriel Lederman and Ingrid Bartsch. New York, Routledge, 2001. 306-322&lt;/ref&gt;

The most obvious differences between males and females include all the features related to reproductive role, notably the endocrine (hormonal) systems and their physiological and behavioral effects, including gonadal differentiation, internal and external genital and breast differentiation, and differentiation of muscle mass, height, and hair distribution. There are also differences in the structure of specific areas of the [[Human brain|brain]]. For example, on average, the [[Sexually dimorphic nucleus|SDN]] ([[INAH 3|INAH3]] in humans) has been repeatedly found to be considerably larger in males than in females.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savic|first=Ivanka|last2=Garcia-Falgueras|first2=Alicia|last3=Swaab|first3=Dick F.|date=2010-01-01|title=Sexual differentiation of the human brain in relation to gender identity and sexual orientation|journal=Progress in Brain Research|volume=186|pages=41–62|doi=10.1016/B978-0-444-53630-3.00004-X|issn=1875-7855|pmid=21094885|series=Progress in Brain Research|isbn=9780444536303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychology==
{{main|Sex differences in human psychology}}
Research on biological sex differences in human psychology investigates cognitive and behavioral differences between [[men]] and [[women]]. This research employs experimental tests of [[cognition]], which take a variety of forms. Tests focus on possible differences in areas such as [[IQ]], spatial reasoning, [[aggression]], [[emotion]], and brain structure and function.

Chromosomal make up is important in human psychology. Women have two X chromosomes while males have an X and Y chromosomal structure. The X chromosome is much more active than Y and it affects behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Heredity Theory Says Intelligence in Males is 'Like Mother, Like Son'|last = Tanoyouye|first = Elyse|journal = Wall Street Journal|date =June 28, 1996|pmid = |page=B1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic researchers theorize that the X chromosome may contain a gene responsible for sociability.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB866070665214215000 |title = Hey guys, for your next party, try borrowing women's genes|last = Langreth|first = Robert|date = 1997|journal = Wall Street Journal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|date=June 2018}}

Most IQ tests are constructed so that there are no overall score differences between females and males.

Because social and environmental factors affect brain activity and behavior, where differences are found, it can be difficult for researchers to assess whether or not the differences are [[innate]]. Studies on this topic explore the possibility of social influences on how both sexes perform in cognitive and behavioral tests. [[Stereotype]]s about differences between men and women have been shown to affect a person's behavior (this is called [[stereotype threat]]).&lt;ref name="Fine"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fine|first=Cordelia|authorlink=Cordelia Fine|title = [[Delusions of Gender|Delusions of Gender: How Our Minds, Society, and Neurosexism Create Difference]]| publisher =W.

In his book titled ''Gender, Nature, and Nurture'', psychologist Richard Lippa found that there were large differences in women's and men's preferences for realistic occupations (for example, mechanic or carpenters) and moderate differences in their preferences for social and artistic occupations. His results also found that women tend to be more people-oriented and men more thing-oriented.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lippa|first=Richard A.|title=Gender, nature, and nurture|year=2005|publisher=Erlbaum|location=Mahwah, NJ [u.a.]|isbn=0-8058-5344-8|pages=12–44|edition=2.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartung &amp; Widiger (1998) found that many kinds of mental illnesses and behavioral problems show gender differences in prevalence and incidence. "Of the 80 disorders diagnosed in adulthood for which sex ratios are provided, 35 are said to be more common in men than in women (17 of which are substance related or a [[paraphilia]]), 31 are said to be more common in women than men, and 14 are said to be equally common in both sexes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hartung|first=CM|author2=Widiger, TA |title=Gender differences in the diagnosis of mental disorders: conclusions and controversies of the DSM-IV.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|date=May 1998|volume=123|issue=3|pages=260–78|pmid=9602559|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.123.3.260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Differences in male and female jealousy can also be observed. While female jealousy is more likely to be inspired by emotional infidelity, male jealousy is most likely to be brought on by sexual infidelity. A clear majority of approximately 62% to 86% of women reported that they would be more bothered by emotional infidelity and 47% to 60% of men reported that they would be more bothered by sexual infidelity.&lt;ref name="Pietrzak 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pietrzak, Laird, Stevens, Thompson|first=Robert, James, David, Nicholas|title=Sex differences in human jealousy: A coordinated study of forced-choice, continuous rating-scale, and physiological responses on the same subjects|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=March 2002|pages=83–94|url=http://resolver.scholarsportal.info/resolve/10905138/v23i0002/83_sdihj|accessdate=21 March 2013|doi=10.1016/s1090-5138(01)00078-2|volume=23|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Janet Shibley Hyde]] from the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] introduced the gender similarities hypothesis, which suggests that males and females are similar on most, but not all, psychological variables. The research focused on cognitive variables (for example, reading comprehension, mathematics), communication (for example, talkativeness, facial expressions), social and personality (for example, aggression, sexuality), psychological well-being, and motor behaviors. Using results from a review of 46 meta-analyses, she found that 78% of gender differences were small or close to zero. A few exceptions were some motor behaviors (such as throwing distance) and some aspects of sexuality (such as attitudes about casual sex), which show the largest gender differences. She concludes her article by stating: "It is time to consider the costs of overinflated claims of gender differences. Arguably, they cause harm in numerous realms, including women’s opportunities in the workplace, couple conflict and communication, and analyses of self-esteem problems among adolescents."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hyde|first=Janet Shibley|title=The Gender Similarities Hypothesis|journal=American Psychologist|date=September 2005|volume=60|issue=6|pages=581–592|doi=10.1037/0003-066X.60.6.581|pmid=16173891}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyde also stated elsewhere that "variations ''within'' genders are greater than variations ''between'' genders."&lt;ref name=tugend&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tugend|first1=Alina|title=Engendering Sons|journal=[[California (magazine)|California]]|url=http://alumni.berkeley.edu/california-magazine/winter-2014-gender-assumptions|issue=Winter 2014|page=50}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 Irina Trofimova&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Trofimova|first=Irina|title=A study of the dynamics of sex differences in adulthood. |journal=[[International Journal of Psychology]] |date= 2012|volume=47|issue=|pages=47, 1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported “middle age – middle sex” phenomenon and suggested that the significant female advantage in verbal fluency and male advantage in physical power fade after age 25 in an asymmetric manner. She pointed out to several other studies on humans and other primates showing a levelling of sex differences in sociability and physical strength. Males and females might indeed have different timings of maturation of physical and verbal systems: according to McGuinness and Pribram (1978) during the first two years of life talking and walking rarely occur simultaneously, which suggests that these two abilities compete for the same set of neural connections, or that one type of neural organization inhibits the other. This coincides with the higher mobility of boys, accompanied by their lower rates of speech development in childhood, in comparison to girls. These different timings in maturation appear as sex differences in early age, and likely level off in later adulthood (Barbu, Cabanes, &amp; Le Maner-Idrissi, 2011). This middle age – middle sex phenomenon might explain why meta-analytic reports and several experimental studies of verbal abilities and dominance using adult participants reported no sex differences.

===Crime===
{{main|Sex differences in crime}}

Statistics have been consistent in reporting that men commit more criminal acts than women.&lt;ref name="Carrabine"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Eamonn Carrabine, Paul Iganski, Maggy Lee|title=Criminology: A Sociological Introduction|publisher=[[Psychology Press]]|isbn=0415281679|year=2004|page=88|accessdate=August 7, 2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJm4AIc4sZEC&amp;pg=PA88|quote=Statistics repeatedly show that many more men than women commit crimes.

Some differing explanations include men's [[evolutionary]] tendency toward risk and violent behavior, sex differences in activity, [[social support]], and [[gender inequality]].

Despite the difficulty of interpreting them, [[crime statistics]] may provide a way to investigate such a relationship from a [[gender differences]] perspective. An observable difference in crime rates between men and women might be due to social and cultural factors, crimes going unreported, or to biological factors (for example, [[testosterone]] or sociobiological theories). Taking the nature of the crime itself into consideration may also be a factor. Crime can be measured by such data as arrest records, imprisonment rates, and surveys. However, not all crimes are reported or investigated. Moreover, some studies show that men can have an overwhelming bias against reporting themselves to be the victims of a crime (particularly when victimized by a woman), and some studies have argued that men reporting [[intimate partner violence]] find disadvantageous biases in law enforcement.&lt;ref&gt;"[M]en who are involved in disputes with their partners, whether as alleged victims or as alleged offenders or both, are disadvantaged and treated less favorably than women by the law-enforcement system at almost every step."

===Education===
{{main|Sex differences in education}}
[[File:Map3.7Education Discrepancy compressed.jpg|right|thumb| 400px| A world map showing countries by gender education disparity, 2010.]]
Sometimes and in some places, there are sex differences in educational achievement. This may be caused by [[sexism|sex discrimination]] in law or culture, or may reflect natural differences in the interests of the sexes.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, Jennifer. "Gender, Education and." Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology. Ritzer, George (ed). Blackwell Publishing, 2007. Blackwell Reference Online. 31 March 2008 &lt;http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433113_ss1-16&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Leadership===
{{main|Sex differences in leadership}}
Research has been undertaken to examine whether or not there are sex differences in leadership. Until recently, leadership positions have predominantly been held by men. Women were rarely seen in senior [[leadership]] positions leading to a lack of data on how they behave in such positions.&lt;ref name="Ascited"&gt;as cited in {{cite journal | last1 = Andersen | first1 = J. A. | last2 = Hansson | first2 = P. H. | year = 2011 | title = At the end of the road? On differences between women and men in leadership behavior | url = | journal = Leadership and Organization Development Journal | volume = 32 | issue = 5| pages = 428–441 | doi=10.1108/01437731111146550}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two main lines of research contradict one another, the first being that there are significant sex differences in leadership and the second being that gender does not have an effect on leadership.

Women and men have been surveyed by Gallup each year concerning workplace topics, and when questioned about preferences of a female boss or a male boss, women chose a preference for a male boss 39% of the time, compared to 26% of men displaying preference for a male boss.  Only 27% of females would prefer a boss of the same gender.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.businessweek.com/articles/2014-10-16/women-dislike-having-female-bosses-more-than-men-do Women Prefer Male Bosses Even More Than Men Do] Bloomberg, October 16, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  This preference, among both sexes, for male leadership in the workplace has continued unabated for sixty years, according to the survey results.

===Religion===
{{main|Sex differences in religion}}
Sex differences in religion can be classified as either "internal" or "external." Internal religious issues are studied from the perspective of a given religion, and might include religious beliefs and practices about the roles and rights of men and women in government, education and worship; beliefs about the sex or gender of deities and religious figures; and beliefs about the origin and meaning of human gender. External religious issues can be broadly defined as an examination of a given religion from an outsider's perspective, including possible clashes between religious leaders and laity;&lt;ref&gt;Juschka, Darlene. "Gender." In ed. J. Hinnels. The Routledge Companion to the Study of Religion. 2nd ed.  New York: Routledge, 2010:245-258.&lt;/ref&gt; and the influence of, and differences between, religious perspectives on social issues. For example, various religious perspectives have either endorsed or condemned alternative family structures, homosexual relationships, and abortion.&lt;ref&gt;

===Social capital===
{{main|Sex differences in social capital}}
Sex differences in social capital are differences between men and women in their ability to coordinate actions and achieve their aims through trust, norms and networks.&lt;ref name=laurie&gt;Laurie, Nina; Andolina, Robert; and Radcliffe, Sarah (2005) 'Ethnodevelopment: Social Movements, Creating Experts and Professionalising Indigenous Knowledge in Ecuador' Antipode 37(3): 470-496&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social capital]] is often seen as the missing link in development; as social networks facilitate access to resources and protect the commons, while cooperation makes markets work more efficiently.&lt;ref name="putnam"&gt;Putnam, Robert. (1993) Making Democracy Work. Civic Traditions in Modern Italy. Princeton University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Social capital has been thought of as women's capital as whereas there are gendered barriers to accessing economic capital, women's role in family, and community ensures that they have strong networks. There is potential that the concept can help to bring women's unpaid 'community and household labor',&lt;ref name=moser&gt;Moser, Caroline (1993) Gender Planning and Development: Theory, Practice and Training London and New York: Routledge&lt;/ref&gt; vital to survival and development, to the attention of economists.

Sex differences in suicide have been shown to be significant; there are highly asymmetric rates of attempted and completed suicide between males and females.&lt;ref name=udry&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2061790 |first1=J.

===Financial risk-taking===

Sex differences in financial decision making are relevant and significant. Numerous studies have found that women tend to be financially more risk-averse than men and hold safer [[Portfolio (finance)|portfolios]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bajtelsmit| first1 = Vickie L | last2 = Bernasek| first2 = Alexandra| year = 1996| title = Why Do Women Invest Differently Than Men?| journal = Journal of Financial Counseling and Planning | volume = 7| pages = 1–10 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adhikari| first1 = Binay K | last2 = O'Leary| first2 = Virginia E | year = 2011| title = Gender Differences in Risk Aversion: A Developing Nation’s Case| url = https://www.dropbox.com/s/ehk7iwzukwu0kw4/Gender%20Differences%20Risk%20Aversion%20-%20Nepal.pdf?dl=0  | journal = Journal of Personal Finance | volume = 10|issue = 2| pages = 122–147}}&lt;/ref&gt; A May 3, 2015 article in the Wall Street Journal by Georgette Jasen reported that "when it comes to investing, men sometimes have their way of doing things, and women have different ways."&lt;ref&gt;Georgette Jasen, May 3, 2015, WSJ online.  https://www.wsj.com/articles/male-investors-vs-female-investors-how-do-they-compare-1430709406&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarly research has documented systematic differences in financial decisions such as buying investments versus insurance, donating to ingroups versus outgroups (such as terrorism victims in Iraq versus USA), spending in stores,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kurt | first1 = Didem | last2 = Inman | first2 = J.

"The duality of human existence: An essay on psychology and religion." (1966).&lt;/ref&gt; according to this theory, due to factors such as socialization, males are typically more agentic (focus on self, upside potential, aggressiveness) and females typically more communal (focus on others, downside potential, and nurturing). This framework robustly explains many financial decision making outcomes.

The '''Society for Advancing Philosophical Enquiry and Reflection in Education (SAPERE)''' is a [[Charitable organization|charity]] that promotes [[Philosophy for Children]] as an [[education]]al [[methodology]] in the [[United Kingdom|UK]]. It is based at the Culham Innovation Centre, Abingdon, [[England]], and its Chair is [[Elizabeth Jones, QC]].

Philosophy for Children (P4C) is a powerful intervention which has been found through many research studies to have both cognitive and social impact on children and schools. P4C was launched in the UK by SAPERE in 1992 and now reaches 4,000 new teachers and 60-70,000 children a year in UK.  P4C is centred on philosophical enquiry, where a trained teacher encourages children to think and reason as a group.

SAPERE's mission is to advance the educational, personal and social development of young people, especially those facing disadvantage, through the promotion of P4C. The organisation's work gained national prominence in 2015 when Durham University School of Education published results of a randomised control trial of P4C with over 3,000 primary school students. The study was sponsored by the [https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/ Education Endowment Foundation]. The [https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/evaluation/projects/philosophy-for-children/ study] found that P4C advanced attainment for all students and had a particularly strong impact on children from disadvantaged backgrounds.

'''''Superhero League of Hoboken''''' is an [[Adventure game|adventure]] and [[role-playing video game]] developed and published by [[Legend Entertainment]]. Designed by [[Steve Meretzky]], the game combines the [[superhero]], [[comedy]] and [[post-apocalyptic science fiction|post-apocalypse]] [[genre]]s. It was available on both [[floppy disk]] and [[CD-ROM]]. It uses 256 colour [[2D computer graphics|2D graphics]].

==Setting==
In the future, the world is ravaged by wars, [[nuclear disaster]]s and [[pollution]]. [[Mutation]]s become common, resulting to individuals and creatures with [[mutant (fictional)|mutant]] [[superpower]]s who unite in crime and become [[supervillain]]s. However other individuals decide to unite their powers for the common good and become [[superhero]]es.

The game is set in the post-apocalyptic [[New Jersey]]-[[New York (state)|New York]]-[[Pennsylvania]] [[Tri-state area]], where the player controls a team of off-beat and often useless superheroes who battle a number of strange enemies, most notably the evil Dr. [[Entropy]], a human [[jack-in-the-box]] with plans to bring [[Civil disorder|chaos]] in the world.

The missions in the game were typically bizarre and often satirised present-day society.

==Characters==
Anytime the player can choose their off-beat team from a retinue of characters. The off-beat protagonist is the [[red tape|Crimson Tape]], whose power is to make organizational charts. His off-beat companions are the Iron Tummy, who can eat any amount of spicy food without suffering intestinal distress, Treader Man who is a fantastic swimmer, the Tropical Oil Man, who defeats villains by giving them high [[cholesterol]], the Oxide Man who can damage mechanical enemies such as robots etc.

Every character has three stats which help him in battle: '''Brawn''' stat determines weapon damage, '''Brains''' affects the effectiveness of super powers, and '''Toughness''' is the character's defense.

Each character can be taught or achieve secondary [[superpower]]s by drinking colored liquids bought or found anywhere in the game. Superpowers mostly are used in combat, although the superpowers of some characters are just a part of the plot (e.g. for solving certain puzzles).

==Development==
Due to designer [[Steve Meretzky]]'s heavy freelance workload during development of ''Superhero League of Hoboken'', he contracted a friend to help with the game's programming in the last months of 1993.&lt;ref name=meretzkycgo&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050324032240/http://cdmag.com/articles/030/176/meret_inter.html | url=http://cdmag.com:80/articles/030/176/meret_inter.html | title=Steve Meretzky | date=November 23, 2000 | author=Shif, Gil Alexander | work=[[Computer Games Magazine]] | archivedate=March 24, 2005 | deadurl=yes | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Meretzky, ''Superhero League of Hoboken'' sold only 20,000-25,000 copies, which he considered "pretty disappointing."&lt;ref name=gamedesigntheory&gt;{{cite book | last=Rouse III | first=Richard | title=[[Game Design: Theory and Practice|Game Design: Theory &amp; Practice Second Edition]] | publisher=Wordware Publishing | at=192 | year=2005 | isbn=1-55622-912-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trent Ward of ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' called the game "an exciting mix of adventure and role-playing, perfect for the gamer who's more concerned with game play than graphics." He stated that it "isn't a game that will change the face of entertainment for years to come, but in the end it really is pretty good fun."&lt;ref name=pcgamerus /&gt;

Writing in ''[[PC Gamer UK]]'', James Leach summarized ''Superhero League of Hoboken'' as "good", but he believed that those who "don't like the surrealism ... will soon get bored."&lt;ref name=pcgameruk /&gt;

''[[Computer Gaming World]]''{{'}}s August 1994 preview of the game stated that "Legend has gone beyond the boundaries of graphic adventures and interbred their taditional fare with elements of computer role-playing".&lt;ref name="wilson199408"&gt;{{Cite magazine

The editors remarked that ''Superhero League of Hoboken'' "broke most of the rules", and that its "goofy dialogue and storyline, and well-balanced gameplay, make for a wild ride through designer Steve Meretzky's left-of-center imagination."&lt;ref name=cgwpremier1995&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[Computer Gaming World]] | title=The ''Computer Gaming World'' 1995 Premier Awards |date=May 1995 | issue=130 | pages=35, 36, 38, 40, 42, 44 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sydel Finfer Silverman Wolf''' (born May 20, 1933) is an American [[anthropologist]] notable for her work as a researcher, writer, and advocate for the archival preservation of anthropological research.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fic|first1=Christy|title=Register to the Papers of Sydel Silverman|date=September 2011|publisher=[[National Anthropological Archives]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Suitland, Maryland|url=http://anthropology.si.edu/naa/fa/silverman.pdf|format=Finding aid}}&lt;/ref&gt; Silverman's early research focused on the study of complex societies and the history of anthropology.&lt;ref name=Maryland-SilvermanBio-2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Revitalizing CoPAR for the Digital Age: Workshop Participants|url=http://archivescollaboratory.umd.edu/copar-participants/|website=ARCLab – The Archives Collaboratory|publisher=iSchool at the University of Maryland|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work involved conducting anthropological research in [[Central Italy]], with a focus on traditional [[agrarian system]]s, [[land reform]], and [[festivals]] in [[central Italy]]. She later became active as an administrator, advocating for the study of cultural anthropology and an important force within the community where she organized discussions and symposia around the topic of preserving the anthropological records.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlantic-AnthropologicalRecordsArchiving-2012&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fic|first1=Christy|title=Sydel Silverman and Her Quest to Preserve Anthropological Records|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2012/01/sydel-silverman-and-her-quest-to-preserve-anthropological-records/251396/|work=[[The Atlantic]]|date=January 16, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life and education ==
Silverman was born in the [[North Lawndale, Chicago|Lawndale]] neighborhood on the west side of Chicago, Illinois, to Joseph Finfer, a rabbi and kosher shohet butcher, and Elizabeth Finfer (née Bassman), a cook.&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-USCensus-1930&gt;{{cite web|title=Elizebeth Finfer United States Census, 1930|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:XSGC-DDD|website=[[FamilySearch]]|date=1930}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FamilySearch-USCensus-1940&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydelle Finfer United States Census, 1940|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KWB5-MDZ|website=[[FamilySearch]]|date=1940}}&lt;/ref&gt; The youngest of seven children, her family was [[Orthodox Jewish]] and was very poor. Her parents came from [[Lithuania]] when they were adults.&lt;ref name=CurrentAnthropology-Interview-1999&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Creed|first1=Gerald W.|title=An Interview with Sydel Silverman|jstor=10.1086/300089|journal=[[Current Anthropology]]|date=December 1999|volume=40|issue=5|pages=699–712|doi=10.1086/300089|publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]], [[Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research]]|issn=0011-3204|oclc=4644928651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silverman's interest in anthropology began at an early age, thanks in part to her uncle Hirshel Bassman. With her uncle, Silverman explored ideas such as mysticism and "oriental religions."&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-Memoirs-2008&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silverman|first1=Sydel|title="Memoirs" Sydel Silverman Papers: Box 42|date=2008|publisher=[[National Anthropological Archives]], [[Smithsonian Institution]]|location=Suitland, MD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1951, Silverman graduated from high school and began her studies at the [[University of Illinois]] at Navy Pier as a pre-med student. After two years of study, she applied to the [[University of Chicago]]'s program in Committee on Human Development. She was admitted through a special exam and began her studies at the [[University of Chicago]] in [[biology]], [[psychology]], and sociology-anthropology. In 1957, Silverman received a master's degree from the Committee on Human Development. Her thesis, ''The Female Climacterium'' was published the same year.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;

In 1957, Silverman enrolled at the PhD program in [[Anthropology]] at [[Columbia University]]. [[Conrad Arensberg]]'s work in the [[Mediterranean]], as well as a personal interest in the region, led Silverman to select Italy as the focus of her dissertation research.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-Memoirs-2008 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McG. Thomas|first1=Robert|title=Conrad Arensberg, 86, Dies; Hands-On Anthropologist|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/02/16/nyregion/conrad-arensberg-86-dies-hands-on-anthropologist.html|publisher=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career ===
Silverman's dissertation research was focused in the Italian village of [[Monte Castello di Vibio|Montecastello di Vibio]]. Her work in this region began in August 1960. Silverman's research was extraordinarily timely.  Firstly, her work was one of the initial social-anthropological studies of the region, (Central Italy).  In addition, her work from this time is noteworthy as it describes the [[mezzadria]], the traditional agrarian system of the region. Shortly after Silverman's research, the mezzadria was abolished by law.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011" /&gt;

In 1963, Silverman received a PhD in [[Anthropology]] from [[Columbia University]]. Her dissertation was called ''Landlord and peasant in an Umbrian community''.  Her dissertation was subsequently used as the basis of her first book, ''Three bells of civilization : the life of an Italian hill town''.  This early work remains one of Silverman's most-cited contributions in the academic community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sydel Silverman|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?q=Sydel+Silverman+&amp;btnG=&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=0%2C33&amp;oq=silver|website=Google Scholar}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to her book, Silverman's dissertation research was the foundation of several additional journal articles.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011" /&gt;

Some of Silverman's photography from this period, (specifically 1960–1961), including photographs by her late husband [[Melvin Silverman]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mel Silverman (Melvin Frank Silverman)|url=http://www.artoftheprint.com/artistpages/silverman_mel_frank_thevillage.htm|website=Art of the Print}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be viewed online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sappino|first1=Marco|title=Ritratti, Riti, Ritrovi: Le Fotografie di Sydel Silverman a Monte Castello di Vibio nel 1960–1961|url=http://www.montecastellodivibio.gov.it/life/news/le-fotografie-di-sydel-silverman-a-monte-castello-di-vibio-nel-1960-1961|website=Benvenuto a Monte Castello di Vibio|language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Teaching ===
[[Queens College]] (1962–1975)
After completing her PhD, Silverman was hired as a teacher by [[Queens College]] in New York City and continued her research in Italy.  From 1962–1975 she taught at [[Queens College]].  During that time, Silverman's research included a 1967 study of land reform in the South of Italy, and several field seasons in Central Italy focused on a comparative study of competitive regional festivals.  From this time, Silverman's publications on [[Palio of Siena]] are the most noteworthy.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlantic-AnthropologicalRecordsArchiving-2012 /&gt; It was at Queens College that Silverman began her career as an administrator when she was elected as Department Chair in 1970.

=== Administration ===
[[Graduate Center, CUNY]] (1975–1986)
From 1975–1986 Silverman was the Executive Officer of the [[CUNY]] PhD Program in Anthropology.  Under her leadership, the program rose from disorganization and threat of disbandment to being considered one of the top ten anthropology doctoral programs in the United States of America.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;&lt;ref name=Atlantic-AnthropologicalRecordsArchiving-2012 /&gt; For a time, Silverman was also the acting Dean of Graduate Studies for CUNY.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maeroff|first1=Gene|title=Education; City U. Graduate School Gains High Rank|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/science/education-city-u-graduate-school-gains-high-rank.html|publisher=The New York Times|date=June 14, 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wenner-Gren Foundation]] (1987–1999)
During the next stage of her career, Silverman moved to the [[Wenner-Gren Foundation]] where she was appointed to the position of President of the Foundation, serving from 1987–1999. While at Wenner-Gren, Silverman was the spokesperson for the organization, advocating for the field of anthropology as well as overseeing administrative tasks including fellowship and grant funding.  Silverman organized twenty-five international symposia during her years at Wenner-Gren.  These symposia became the topic of her 2002 book, ''The Beast on the Table'' which offers a rich narrative concerning the living history of anthropology.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;

Outside of her fieldwork, advocacy, and administrative work, Silverman's other major research interest has been on anthropology itself—particularly the history of anthropology and the practice of anthropology.  In addition to what has already been discussed, Silverman's work at Wenner-Gren also included an effort to preserve anthropological records.&lt;ref name=Atlantic-AnthropologicalRecordsArchiving-2012 /&gt;

Silverman has authored and edited an impressive assortment of books related to anthropology. A selected bibliography is included below, and more detailed descriptions of a number of her books has been provided by Archivist [[Christy Fic]] in the Register to the Papers of Sydel Silverman.  Silverman's work in this area has spanned the course of her long career, and has continued into her retirement in 1999.&lt;ref name=Smithsonian-SilvermanPapers-2011 /&gt;

Silverman is President Emerita of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research and Professor Emerita of Anthropology at the City University of New York.&lt;ref name=Maryland-SilvermanBio-2016 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emeritus Faculty|url=https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Anthropology/Faculty/Emeritus-Faculty|website=Anthropology Department|publisher=City University of New York (CUNY)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life ==
In December 1953, Silverman married the painter Mel Silverman. They were married until his death in 1966.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-MelSilverman-Obit-1966&gt;{{cite news|title=Mel Silverman, Painter, was 35; Collagist Who Made Prints and Lithographs Dies|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1966/09/17/121031452.pdf|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 17, 1966|page=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1972, Silverman married anthropologist, [[Eric Wolf]]. They were married until his death in 1999.&lt;ref name=NYTimes-EricWolf-Obit-1999&gt;{{cite news|last1=McG. Thomas Jr.|first1=Robert|title=Eric R.

In addition to two stepchildren from Wolf's first marriage, the couple have two children, Eve Silverman and film producer, [[Julie Yorn]].&lt;ref name=NYTimes-EricWolf-Obit-1999 /&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimes-JulieYornWedding-1996&gt;{{cite news|title=Weddings: Julie Silverman And Kevin Yorn|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1996/07/07/style/weddings-julie-silverman-and-kevin-yorn.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=July 7, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Merchant Princes''''' is a [[science fantasy]] and [[alternate history]] series by British writer [[Charles Stross]].  There are currently eight novels in the series, with another forthcoming.  In the series, there exists a number of [[Parallel universe (fiction)|parallel worlds]] all of which are on the same geographical Earth, but with different societies at different points of development.  Members of a certain [[bloodline]] can travel between these worlds along with their immediate possessions.  The series largely follows Miriam Beckstein, a technology journalist raised in a familiar "normal" Earth, who discovers she was born in a parallel world and is a member of this bloodline.  She quickly becomes entangled in political maneuvering and assassination plots with her estranged family.  Miriam uses modern technology and investigative journalism to attempt to stay a step ahead.

The implications of this world-traveling ability are thoroughly explored by the series.  The ability to take clothing and held items across allows a phenomenally lucrative import/export trade between worlds; wielders of this power have used it to become wealthy.  Invaluable modern technology and medicine can be shipped to the feudal world; illegal drugs can be shipped in a world where the [[DEA]] has no power; and packages or messages that would take months to deliver by horseback can simply be mailed via FedEx in the modern world.  This power has implications for security and crime as well, since it is now possible to commit a crime then disappear into thin air, and difficult to lock someone up in any effective manner.  It also means there is immense social pressure on members of the genetic bloodline to breed with other compatible members to increase the likelihood of the ability manifesting.

The first six novels in the series were released from 2004 to 2010, and take place in 2002&amp;ndash;2004 of an alternate present.  The books were later re-released in 2014 as ''A Merchant Princes Omnibus'', a trilogy of three books with each book a combination of two of the original novels: ''The Bloodline Feud'' (books 1 and 2), ''The Traders' War'' (books 3 and 4), and ''The Revolution Trade'' (books 5 and 6).&lt;ref name="torbloodline"&gt;[http://www.torbooks.co.uk/blog/2013/04/11/charles-stross-introduces-the-bloodline-trade CHARLES STROSS INTRODUCES: THE BLOODLINE TRADE]&lt;/ref&gt;  The re-release also included a considerable amount of editing and rewriting by Stross, although no major plot changes.  A new trilogy began in 2017 with the release of ''Empire Games'' featuring new characters and updating the year in-setting to 2020.

The first three novels of the series collectively won the Sidewise Award for Alternate History in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uchronia.net/sidewise/complete.html#pagebox Past Winners and Finalists],  Sidewise Award for Alternate History&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development and themes==
According to Stross, in 2001, he had already sold two books to the publisher [[Ace Books]], ''[[Singularity Sky]]'' and ''[[Iron Sunrise]]''.  Ace also had the right of first refusal to any future science fiction books Stross would publish, and would likely only publish one book of his a year so as not to have his books compete against themselves.&lt;ref name="strosspm" /&gt;  His agent advised him that if he wished to sell more books without breach of contract and also to avoid self-cannibalization, he should branch out genres, and encouraged Stross to try his hand at a [[fantasy]] series. Stross was hesitant, but gave it a shot. He wanted to be original but not "too original" and create something hard to market. He decided his series would be his own spin on both the works of [[Roger Zelazny]]'s ''[[The Chronicles of Amber]]'', which featured a hero with special world-travelling powers, as well as the "Paratime" works of [[H. Beam Piper]], which features an organization with the power to basically raid and exploit multiple alternate histories. The main world to be visited would also be a feudal one more out of the Renaissance, as per many other fantasy stories.&lt;ref name="strosspm"/&gt;   Stross chose to intentionally limit the scope of "magical" powers to solely the world-travelling.  Stross was able to sell his new fantasy series to [[Tor Books]], and would later adjust his contract with Ace to specifically exclude ''The Merchant Princes''. This allowed Stross to explain the magic in the series with background sci-fi without worrying about breach of contract, but also satisfying his desire for a consistent explanation of what was "really" going on behind the scenes.&lt;ref name="strosspm"&gt;Stross, Charles. [http://www.antipope.org/charlie/blog-static/2010/03/post-mortem.html Post mortem].&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the themes that Stross wanted to explicitly explore in the series was that of the [[development trap]], or more generally [[developmental economics]], the issues involved in helping poor and stratified societies to rapidly "catch up."  Economist [[Paul Krugman]] wrote on the series that Stross noticed that "the fantasy thought experiment, in which someone brings modern science and technology to a backward society, isn't a fantasy. It is, instead, something that's been tried all across the very real [[Third World]]," to mixed success at best. While some countries such as South Korea became rich powerhouses, others such as Thailand have only modernized somewhat, and some states like Somalia remain desperately poor, just with access to cell phones and guns. The case of the [[Arab states of the Persian Gulf|Gulf oil states]] such as Saudi Arabia remain a special case, with a fabulously privileged upper class able to be educated abroad and get cutting-edge medical care and the like, but not expanding the economy of their societies beyond the treasure trove that is their wealth from natural resources - which is compared with the Clan's treasure trove from interdimensional trade.  Krugman qualified his praise of the economics with a proviso that the books "are, first and foremost, great fun" with a "rollicking plot," and not a bland essay about the implications of such trade.&lt;ref name="krugman"&gt;Krugman, Paul.

'''''The Family Trade''''' is the first book of ''The Merchant Princes'', published in 2004.  It introduces the reader to technology journalist Miriam Beckstein, who finds herself in a parallel world in which her extended family holds power.

Miriam's adoptive mother Iris gives her a shoebox filled with items that belonged to Miriam's birth mother, a [[Jane Doe (pseudonym)|Jane Doe]] who died mysteriously when Miriam was only a baby.  Among other items, Miriam finds a locket.  Inside is a design not unlike a [[Celtic knot]], and when she focuses on it, she is transported to a parallel world of a feudal Massachusetts whose technology is mostly in the [[Dark Ages (historiography)|Dark Ages]]—except for the men on horses armed with guns, and an upper class that has access to "imported" baubles from Miriam's normal Earth.

Miriam quickly finds herself caught up in the feuds of her estranged family, which calls itself the Clan.  The Clan has used the genetic ability to travel back and forth between the two worlds to build a lucrative import/export trade, and enrich themselves.  However, their founder and progeny were from the feudal world, and thus their [[wikt:mores|mores]] and beliefs are as well; they are content to merely enrich themselves, and seek to ingratiate themselves to the local nobility, rather than to help the commonfolk.  The easy money from their power also complicates reform.  Miriam compares them to Saudi princes who visit the United States and Europe, but think in an entirely different way.  The Clan's most profitable transport is currently drugs, which bothers Miriam both for ethical reasons, and in her belief that the Clan could do far better.  She decides to attempt to reform the business from within, while dodging the various assassination plots hatched against her.  She also understands that the drug trade will only last so long; anonymity and carrying large amounts of raw cash are growing steadily more suspicious.

Miriam finds a number of potential allies in her travels.  They include Paulie, a research assistant from her former job with some experience in the field of law; Roland, a distant relation, economist, and potential love interest who would also like to be free of the Clan's machinations and prefers the United States to the feudal Gruinmarkt; Duke Angbard Lofstrom, Miriam's uncle and head of security for the Clan, as well as leader of its Boston operations; Olga, a young and flighty noble who helps explain to Miriam the politics and notables of Gruinmarkt; and Briliana and Kara, two lesser noble ladies-in-waiting assigned to Miriam's service in Gruinmarkt's capital of Niejwein.

Reviews of the book often note its rather abrupt ending.&lt;ref name="strosspm" /&gt;  This is because both it and ''The Hidden Family'' were originally written as one novel, but that novel was then split for brevity's sake, as 600 pages was too long.&lt;ref name="torbloodline" /&gt;  ''The Family Trade'' placed fifth in the annual [[Locus Award|Locus Poll]] for best fantasy novel.&lt;ref name=locus&gt;[http://www.locusmag.com/SFAwards/Db/NomLit132.html#5043 ''Locus'' Index to SF Awards]&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Family Trade'' and ''The Hidden Family'' were later released together as ''The Bloodline Feud'', with some editing and adjustments.&lt;ref name="torbloodline" /&gt;

'''''The Hidden Family''''' is the second book of ''The Merchant Princes'', published in 2005.  It completes the story began in ''The Family Trade'' of Miriam Beckstein's attempts to understand and explore the new worlds she has access to.  As the title suggests, the existence of families with the power to "worldwalk" unknown to the Clan comes of importance in this book, as a shadow war to undermine the Clan continues.  The story also includes Miriam's exploration of a third world largely unknown to the Clan, where Massachusetts is part of "New Britain" and the British monarchy fled to America; this nation has roughly [[Edwardian era|Edwardian]] mores and 1930s technology.  The existence of this third world also complicates security expectations, as it provides an angle to attack the Clan from locations which might seem safely guarded in both worlds, but are unguarded in the third world.

In ''The Hidden Family'', Miriam correctly hypothesizes that the Clan civil war that took place around the time she was born was caused and intensified by a third party - a distant branch of the Clan that, while weaker, was unknown and had access to a different world.  They were thus able to perform attacks that seemed as if they must come from a rival world-walker within the Clan, but actually came from the Hidden Family.  Miriam also believes this third party to be behind the attack on her birth mother.  For reasons she can't entirely understand, this branch family considers her existence a threat as well.  Miriam also has to contend with elements in the Clan who distrust her.  She is warned that in 6 months, a large Clan meeting will occur at Beltaigne, and her rivals - including her own blood grandmother Hildegarde - are likely to motion to have her declared incompetent, which would deny her the funds held in trust that was her inheritance.  Lastly, Miriam believes that Duke Lofstram's security forces have a mole working for the Hidden Family, after several security lapses and attempts on her life that seemed to know too much.

Both to research the hidden family, as well as to build her own personal base of power separate from the alternative of marrying a Clan noble and throwing herself under his faction's protection, most of the book concerns Miriam's efforts in New Britain.  Miriam gained access to it via taking a New Britain locket off one of the hidden assassins who attacked her at the end of ''The Family Trade''.  There, she ships gold - tightly regulated under [[mercantilist]] beliefs that the government requires a large supply of bullion - and allies with the [[Levellers]], dissidents from the Royal government who demand something like the rights secured in the American Revolution in Miriam's world.  Erasmus Burgeson, a Leveller quartermaster and pawnshop owner, helps set Miriam up with false identity papers, and Miriam moves on to her next money-making plan.  After shipping gold to get some initial funds, she will instead ship ideas.  She buys a business and begins to take old [[patent]]s from the 1900s-1950s unfamiliar to New Britain there, and sell rights to the ideas.

''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' in their review said "Stross continues to mix high and low tech in amusing and surprising ways. However, while giving a gritty SF portrait of the marvels of modern market economics and correcting the too pretty portrait of too many medieval fantasy lands, he sometimes overlooks the realities that constrain both. Still, less historically minded readers can lose themselves in Miriam's attempts to survive the Clan's equally dangerous high-stakes business and social games. Stross weaves a tale worthy of [[Robert Ludlum]] or [[Dan Brown]]."&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly"&gt;{{cite journal|date=April 25, 2005|title=THE HIDDEN FAMILY: Book Two of Merchant Princes|journal=Publishers Weekly|volume= 252|issue= 17|pages=43|issn=0000-0019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Roland Green reviewing the book for [[Booklist]] compared it to the early novels in Roger Zelazny's ''[[The Chronicles of Amber|Amber]]'' series.&lt;ref name="Green"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Green|first=Roland|date=June 1, 2005|title=The Hidden Family|journal=Booklist|volume= 101|issue= 19/20|pages=1769|issn=0006-7385}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''The Hidden Family'' was a finalist for the 2006 [[Prometheus Award]].&lt;ref name="urlLibertarian Futurist Society"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lfs.org/novel_nominees.htm |title=Libertarian Futurist Society |author= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date= |work= |publisher= |pages= |language= |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/5c5Cjkzz1|archivedate= 2008-11-04|quote= |accessdate=2008-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Clan Corporate''''' is the third book of ''The Merchant Princes'', published in 2006.  It is the first part of the series' second story.  In ''The Clan Corporate'', Miriam Beckstein runs into trouble.  Her experimental corporation in New Britain has been somewhat abandoned with other Clan minders overseeing it, officially due to concerns she might be assassinated, but actually due to political rivalries.  The truce between the Clan and the Lee Family of New Britain seems to hold, at least.  The Clan still does not trust the upstart; Miriam is largely kept isolated in the first parallel world of Gruinmarkt, a virtual prisoner, and unable to travel unchaperoned.  Miriam escapes surveillance for a time and finds out about the "insurance policy", a plot by the more modernizing faction of the Clan to create hundreds more world-walkers by offering mass artificial insemination at compromised sperm banks, then attempt to recruit the resulting children.  She stirs up enough trouble in her investigations that she is quickly re-imprisoned, her activities even more strongly circumscribed than before.

On normal Earth, a parallel subplot involves Mike Fleming, a [[DEA]] cop who dated Miriam in the past.  Mike is pulled into a secret government task force that is investigating the Clan's activities; from the US Government's perspective, the Clan is "transdimensional narcoterrorists".  This "Family Trade Organization" has a key asset in the Clan defector from the first two books who had arrived seeking a witness protection program.  The defector's aid helps the government arrest other Clan couriers, seize Clan assets, and begin to compile an English - Hochsprache dictionary.  This language study will allow agents to communicate if they can reach Gruinmarkt via captured couriers outfitted with [[Battle Royale (film)|Battle Royale]]-esque time bombs on their heads.  &lt;!-- Yes, that's actually the reference they make in the book. --&gt;  The government is also alarmed to learn that the Clan possesses nuclear weapons, while Mike is concerned by the quasi-legality and loose morality of the operation.  The plan goes awry as their defector source begins to grow restless and realizes that he is being held by the military now, not by law enforcement, and witness protection is not forthcoming.  In a desperate bid to take a hostage and escape, both the defector and Mike's co-worker Pete are killed.

A trapped Miriam learns her fate: she is to be spared for her indiscretions, but only to be tied down in a political marriage, the only thing that can satisfy the more conservative instincts of the Clan.  The Clan seeks to tie itself to the royal family so that it can rule Gruinmarkt.  The King's two sons each have problems; the eldest son Egon has a cruel streak and is known as the "Pervert", while the youngest son Creon has [[Phenylketonuric|PKU]] and is considered an "Idiot" after being poisoned with sweetener at a young age.  Egon does not bear the recessive world-walker genes from the Clan-member that had managed to sneak into the royal line, while Creon does, thus making the Clan favor Creon.  Miriam's great-uncle Henryk, the king's head of spies, explains that if she marries Creon, his affliction would not affect his children, so she could produce potential world-walker Clan members to eventually reign.  Miriam is treated by a Clan fertility doctor and reluctantly goes forward with the plan after she is threatened with her ailing mother losing access to medical care, despite her strong aversion to marrying for "duty".

In the final act, Clan allies gather for the banquet to celebrate the forced engagement of Miriam and Creon.  Agent Fleming is sent by the government to the banquet as well as part of a plan to make contact with her and turn her into an informant, posing as a captured West Coast courier.  All the plans fall to pieces when the anti-Clan Prince Egon launches a [[coup d'etat|coup]], correctly fearing he would be denied the succession and potentially murdered had Creon produced an heir.  The King and Creon are slain; Miriam escapes to New Britain; and Mike is captured by Miriam's mother Patricia and her ally Olga.

Reviews noted that ''The Clan Corporate'' suffers from a similar issue as the first book; it is clearly the first part of a two-part story, and ends on a cliffhanger with its plot threads still hanging.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7653-0930-3 The Clan Corporate: Book Three of the Merchant Princes]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sfsite.com/08a/cc229.htm The Clan Corporate]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Merchant's War''''' is the fourth book of ''The Merchant Princes'', published in 2007.  Protagonist Miriam Beckstein is on the run in the world of New Britain after narrowly escaping an attack in Gruinmarkt.  The Clan itself struggles with a war on two fronts: one against Prince Egon's coup forces for control of Gruinmarkt, and another against the secretive US government taskforce investigating the Clan.

In New London, the equivalent of New York City on Earth and Niejwein in Gruinmarkt, Miriam seeks out one of Erasmus Burgeson's Leveler contact Lady Bishop for aid and shelter.  The situation in New Britain is not good: the King has dismissed Parliament, another colonial war rages overseas, and the Treasury is paying its bills by printing money, leading to [[stagflation]].  The Levelers wish to create a democratic system, but are wary of moving until the burst of war-fueled government support wears off.  Miriam still fears elements of the Clan out to murder her.  She reconnects with Erasmus, dodges both Clan agents and the police, recovers her laptop she stowed into Boston, and heads west with Erasmus to meet a noted Leveler intellectual and leader.  However, Miriam feels strangely sick, especially while briefly world-walking to Gruinmarkt to evade the police.

Duke Angbard Lofstrom of the Clan charges his agent Briliana d'Ost with recovering Miriam, or, failing that, to ensure she no longer poses a threat to the Clan.  The situation is complicated by the fact that Miriam's mother seemingly arranged for her to be artificially inseminated by Prince Creon during her examinations, meaning she is pregnant with the heir to the throne.  Pregnant world-walkers cannot safely travel if their child would be a world-walker themselves, though, and Miriam comes from a world where [[Roe v. Wade|abortion is legal]] if she were to find out about her condition.  Angbard also summons Huw, an MIT grad student, and charges him with investigating both the lockets and exploration of potential new worlds.  Experimentation had largely been forbidden for fear of losing valuable couriers before, but with their base in the United States under threat, the Clan needs to seek out alternative options.  Huw and his staff discover that the Lee family Locket, while ineffective in Massachusetts and New York in the United States, works in Maryland, and leads to a fourth world in the grip of an Ice Age with polar sheets covering the northern States.  The fourth world is seemingly empty, but shows signs of a highly advanced, dead civilization.

On normal Earth, Mike Fleming recovers from his injuries sustained in the escape from Miriam's wedding banquet.  Luckily for him, the infection in his leg is not [[Antimicrobial resistance|resistant to penicillin]], as overuse of antibiotics has not affected Gruinmarkt's bacteria.  While Fleming recovers, the viewpoint character shifts to Colonel Eric Smith, his superior.  Eric is considerably more ruthless than Fleming in his viewpoint and morality.  He is introduced to government scientists that have figured out how to send tiny cell samples on their own without need for captured Clan couriers; managing attempts to use Mike's contact Olga to negotiate over the Clan's nuclear weapons; and attempting to hunt down (with the help of [[Nuclear Emergency Support Team|NIRT]]) a potential nuclear weapon that is already a ticking time bomb in Boston planted by the defector.  In the long term, the government seeks to deal with [[peak oil]] via potentially invading alternate-universe Texas.

Prince Egon confounds the Clan with intelligent tactics designed to minimize the Clan's advantages in technology and firepower.  He immediately takes to the field, keeping moving with a small detachment; does not dress in royal frippery, but as a normal officer, and keeps [[body double]]s around; and has an elite guard armed with modern Earth weapons such as [[MP5]]s.  All this renders assassinating him chancy.  In battlefield strategy, he splits his forces into small groups which raid Clan manors, execute anyone vaguely related to the Clan, then melt back into the forest.  This causes panicked requests for aid from the Clan's lesser allies, spreading the Clan forces thinly; this is compared to the [[strategic hamlet]]s in the Vietnam War, where similar insurgency tactics were used.  After spreading the Clan out, Egon seeks to concentrate the core Clan members so they can be wiped out; this requires a risky concentration of his own forces, but through misdirection and treachery, he and his ally Baron Otto Neuhalle takes the key Hjalmar Palace the Clan held.  It is not known if he has a world-walker ally keeping him informed, or he is adeptly using information gained from his grandmother on the Clan's powers and limitations.

The Family Trade Organization under Colonel Eric Smith eventually finds the planted nuke, as well as tracks down enough Clan members to find them planning to retake the Hjalmar Palace.  The Clan is forced to act in haste; they do retake the Palace, but at the cost of being unable to return to the United States easily in that location.  Miriam and Erasmus arrive in California, but finds a deadly reception from the British Sheriff who has orders for their arrest.  Briliana, Huw, and Huw's assistants sweep in to save Miriam and ambush the police with advanced American weaponry.  Miriam is offered a path back to the Clan and to aid the "progressive" faction against the conservatives.

''Publishers Weekly'' as well as other reviewers praised the book, although thought the addition of the government subplot meant that the characterization was spread a little too thinly with not enough room to develop all the characters' plots.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-7653-1671-4 ''The Merchants' War''].

The term is derived from [[Wilson Tucker]], a pioneering [[United States|American]] [[science fiction]] writer, [[science fiction fandom|fan]] and [[science fiction fanzine|fanzine]] editor, who made a practice of using his friends' names for minor characters in his stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Brave New Words: The Oxford Dictionary of Science Fiction|author=Jeff Prucher|year=2007|isbn=|pages=342|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baen|first=Jim|title=The Tucker Circle|url=http://www.baensuniverse.com/tucker.html|work=Jim Baen's Universe|accessdate=8 January 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512062621/http://www.baensuniverse.com/tucker.html|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, Tucker named a character after [[Lee Hoffman]] in his novel ''[[The Long Loud Silence]]'', and after [[Walt Willis]] in ''Wild Talent''.&lt;ref name=tuckerisms&gt;{{cite web|last1=Langford|first1=David|title=Tuckerisms|url=http://sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/tuckerisms|website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction|publisher=Gollancz|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable examples ==
[[H. P. Lovecraft]]'s acquaintance [[Robert Bloch]] published "The Shambler from the Stars", in the September 1935 ''[[Weird Tales]]''; its unnamed, doomed protagonist is a weird-fiction author closely resembling Lovecraft. As a genial return, Lovecraft's "The Haunter of the Dark", published in the December 1936 ''Weird Tales'', introduces [[Robert Harrison Blake]], who shares Bloch's [[Milwaukee]] street address and is killed off in an equally horrible fashion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |encyclopedia= [[The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction]] |url= http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/tuckerisms |author= Langford, David R. |authorlink= David Langford |editor= [[John Clute]], [[Peter Nicholls (writer)|Peter Nicholls]] |title= Tuckerisms|date= November 10, 2014 |edition= Online |publisher=St Martin's Griffin |location=New York |isbn=0-312-09618-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloch wrote a third story after Lovecraft's death, "The Shadow from the Steeple" (1950), in which the events of the first two stories are further explored.

[[Harry Harrison (writer)|Harry Harrison]]'s ''To the Stars'' character: "Old Lundwall, who commands the ''Sverige'', should have retired a decade ago, but he is still the best there is." [[Sam J Lundwall]] is a well-known [[Sweden|Swedish]] science fiction publisher and writer, as well as the godfather of Harrison's daughter, and ''Sverige'' is the Swedish word for Sweden.

A tuckerization can also be the use of a person's character or personal attributes with a new name as an in-joke, such as Ian Arnstein in [[S. M. Stirling]]'s ''[[Island in the Sea of Time]]'' trilogy, clearly modeled on his good friend [[Harry Turtledove]], albeit an alternate history Turtledove.

In most cases, tuckerization is used for "bit parts" (minor characters), an opportunity for the author to create an [[Homage (arts)|homage]] to a friend or respected colleague. But sometimes an author will attach a friend's name, description, or identifiable characteristics to a major character, and in some novels nearly all the characters represent friends, colleagues, or prominent persons the author knows. When this happens, tuckerization can rise to the level of a [[roman à clef]]. [[Larry Niven]] and [[Jerry Pournelle]] have done this at least twice:

* ''Inferno'', in which about half the people the main character meets are famous people.
* ''[[Fallen Angels (science fiction novel)|Fallen Angels]]'', nearly everybody who assists the effort to return the "angels" (astronauts) to orbit is either a well-known fan (Jenny Trout = [[Filk music|filksinger]], author, and political activist [[Leslie Fish]]), a friend of Niven &amp; Pournelle (Dan Forrester = [[Dan Alderson]]), or somebody who paid (through donation to a fan charity) for the privilege of appearing in the book. In this case, it can be argued that the first and second categories are not true tuckerizations, since the individual's real names are not used (however recognizable many of them may be). &lt;!-- If you think this is "original research", read the book. If you're not an SF fan, get one to help you. --&gt;

A similar effect is seen in Niven's collaboration with [[David Gerrold]], ''[[The Flying Sorcerers]]''; all the gods are well known science fiction or media personalities (Ouells = [[H. G. Wells]], Rotn'bair = [[Star Trek]] creator [[Gene Roddenberry]], etc.).

In the early 1930s, before [[Jerry Siegel]] and [[Joe Shuster]] created the comic-book superhero ''[[Superman]]'', they wrote and illustrated a fanzine story, "[[The Reign of the Superman]]", featuring a super-powered villain. This story includes one of the very first tuckerizations: a character named after [[Forrest J Ackerman]].

More recent examples include the many science fiction and military novelists whose names are borrowed in the [[Axis of Time]] by [[John Birmingham]], and the Lachlan Fox thriller series by [[James Clancy Phelan]].  [[Philip K. Dick]] employed tuckerization in his short story "Waterspider", in which he sent fellow author [[Poul Anderson]] ahead in time to a future where science fiction authors were seen as having precognitive abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Minority Report: 18 Classic Stories |last=Dick|first=Philip K.|date=2002|publisher=Citadel Press Books|pages=176–198|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Fiona Kelleghan]], a science fiction critic, has been tuckerized a few times by authors whom she wrote about: in ''[[Corrupting Dr. Nice]]'' by [[John Kessel]], in ''Galveston'' by [[Sean Stewart]], in ''Run'' by [[Douglas E. Winter]], twice in the ''[[WWW Trilogy]]'' by [[Robert J. Sawyer]] (once as a character under her maiden name, "Feehan", and once as her real-world self), and in ''Spondulix'' by [[Paul Di Filippo]].

British science fiction writer [[Simon R. Green]] repeatedly tuckerizes ''[[Ansible (magazine)|Ansible]]'' editor David Langford, killing him off in various grisly ways and then gleefully notifying ''Ansible'' about the latest killing. Similarly, science fiction fan Joe Buckley, who maintains a website dedicated to detailing information about the publications of [[Baen Books]], has been tuckerized in books by a number of Baen authors, including [[Eric Flint]] and [[David Weber]], dying a variety of unpleasant deaths. Weber has also tuckerized various other fans and authors, including Flint, [[Timothy Zahn]], and [[Jordin Kare]], even crewing one small spacecraft with a collection of [[hearts]]-playing [[Chattanooga, Tennessee|Chattanooga]]-based science fiction fans.

In a lengthy, commutative ''[[quid pro quo]]'', novelist Henry Sutton of [[Norwich]], [[England]] (b. 1963),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://authorities.loc.gov/cgi-bin/Pwebrecon.cgi?AuthRecID=2243050&amp;v1=1&amp;HC=2&amp;SEQ=20141215113008&amp;PID=E081CwgIGuLjbRzfQi_1qDMjbTv9kVT |author= [[Library of Congress]] Authorities |date= |title= Sutton, Henry, 1963- |publisher= Library of Congress |accessdate= January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; tuckerizes [[David R.

He needs to do something. |accessdate= January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[in-joke]] is that Slavitt used to use the pseudonym Henry Sutton to write erotic, science fiction and/or [[Thriller (genre)|thriller]] and [[crime novel]]s.

== Legacy ==

Many [[science fiction authors]] auction off tuckerizations at [[science fiction conventions]] with the proceeds going to charity.&lt;ref&gt;[[Patrick Nielsen Hayden|Nielsen Hayden, Patrick]].

"Charity auction for characters names in forthcoming sf novels by great writers" ''[[boingboing]]'' November 28, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tuckerization ''contra'' biographical fiction ==

Tuckerization should not be confused with the inclusion of living or deceased real persons in fiction, either as major or minor characters. This form of story is called [[Biography in literature#Biographical fiction|biographical fiction]].  Some examples include:

* ''[[Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter (novel)|Abraham Lincoln, Vampire Hunter]]'' is a 2010 [[biographical]] [[action (fiction)|action]] [[horror fiction|horror]] novel by [[Seth Grahame-Smith]]. The story includes such historical characters as [[Abraham Lincoln]], his first love [[Ann Rutledge]], his wife [[Mary Todd Lincoln]], his son [[William Wallace Lincoln]], vampire hunters [[Edgar Allan Poe]] and [[William H. Seward]], and [[Stephen A. Douglas]].
* [[Chelsea Quinn Yarbro]], in the 1984 novel ''[[Warday]]'' by [[Whitley Strieber]] and James Kunetka,  appears as a friend of Whitley; Streiber and Kunetka are themselves on a scientific journey.
* ''Walt and Emily'', a novella about [[Emily Dickinson]] and [[Walt Whitman]], is a story in [[Paul Di Filippo]]'s 1995 collection ''The Steampunk Trilogy''. The two previous novels of the collection likewise include [[Queen Victoria]] in the first, "Victoria", and [[Louis Agassiz]] in the second, "Hottentots".
* ''[[The Agony and the Ecstasy (novel)|The Agony and the Ecstasy]]'' (1961) is a biographical novel of [[Michelangelo Buonarroti|Michelangelo]] written by American author [[Irving Stone]]. An earlier novel, ''[[Lust for Life (novel)|Lust for Life]]'' (1934), is a [[biographical novel]] written by Irving Stone based on the famous Dutch painter, [[Vincent van Gogh]], and his hardships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Krebs |first= Albin |title= Irving Stone, Author of ''Lust for Life'', Dies at 86 |work= [[The New York Times]] |date= August 28, 1989 |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/28/obituaries/irving-stone-author-of-lust-for-life-dies-at-86.html |access-date= January 31, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Forrest J. Ackerman]] in various novels, etc.

The '''White Ensign''', at one time called the '''St George's Ensign''' due to the simultaneous existence of a cross-less version of the flag, is an [[ensign]] flown on British [[Royal Navy]] [[Royal Navy ships|ships]] and [[shore establishment]]s. It consists of a red [[St George's Cross]] on a white field with the [[Union Flag]] in the upper canton.

The White Ensign is also flown by [[yacht]]s of members of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] and by ships of [[Trinity House]] escorting [[Monarchy of the United Kingdom|the reigning monarch]].

In addition to the United Kingdom, several other nations have variants of the White Ensign with their own national flags in the canton, with the St George's Cross sometimes being replaced by a naval badge omitting the cross altogether. Yachts of the [[Royal Irish Yacht Club]] fly a white ensign with an Irish tricolour in the first quadrant and defaced by the crowned harp from the [[Heraldic Badge of Ireland]]. The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]] and the Commissioners' flag of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]] place the Union emblem in the first quarter of a white field, omitting the overall red St George's Cross, but are not ensigns for use at sea.

==History==
[[File:Invincible Armada.jpg|thumb|320px|Striped ensigns flying on English and Spanish galleons in 1588: (enlarge image for detailed view)]]
[[File:48 NATO fleet entering Stavanger Norway April 1975.jpg|thumb|250px|The White Ensign flying from a Royal Navy vessel.]]
[[File:Royal Marine, 1914.jpg|thumb|250px|A [[Royal Marine]] holding up the White Ensign aboard {{HMS|Pegasus|1897|6}}, during the [[Battle of Zanzibar]] (20 September 1914).]]

English naval ensigns were first used during the 16th century, and were often striped in green and white (the Tudor colours), but other colours were also used to indicate different squadrons, including blue, red and tawny brown. (These striped ensigns can be seen in use on both English and Spanish warships in contemporary paintings of the 1588 [[Spanish Armada]] battles). Later, there was usually a St George's Cross in the upper canton, or sewn across the field as on the modern White Ensign. These striped ensigns continued in use under the Stuart kings: the Naval ensign of 1623 is described as having "15 horizontal stripes alternately blue, white and yellow with a Cross of St George in the canton". This design fell out of use after 1630, with the introduction of the Red, White and Blue ensigns. The use of stripes continued in the red and white of both the [[East India Company|flag of the Honourable East India Company]], adopted in 1600, and of the 1775 [[Grand Union Flag]] that formed the basis for the modern [[flag of the United States of America]], and the red, white and blue striped ensign that serves as the [[flag of Hawaii]].

The first recognisable White Ensign appears to have been in use during the 16th century, consisting of a white field with a broad St George's cross, and a second St. George's cross in the canton. By 1630 the white ensign consisted of simply a white field, with a small St George's cross in the canton, which was consistent with the red and blue ensigns of the time. In 1707, the St. George's cross was reintroduced to the flag as a whole, though not as broad as before, and the [[Union Flag]] was placed in the canton. There was also a version of this flag without the overall St George's cross, which appears to have been for use in home waters only, though this flag appears to have fallen out of use by 1720. In 1801, after the [[Act of Union 1800]], the flag was updated to include the new Union Flag in the canton, and so took on the form as used today. The blue field of the Union Flag was darkened at this time at the request of the [[Admiralty]], in the hope that the new flags would not require replacing as often as the previous design, due to fading of the blue. Throughout this period, the proportions of the flags changed. In 1687, the then [[Secretary of the Admiralty]], [[Samuel Pepys]], instructed that flags be of the ratio 11:18 (18&amp;nbsp;inches long for each breadth, 11&amp;nbsp;inches at the time). In the early 18th century, the breadth of cloth had been reduced to 10&amp;nbsp;inches, so the flags became 5:9. In 1837, the breadth was reduced for the final time to 9&amp;nbsp;inches, giving the current ratio of 1:2.

Throughout this period in the history of the Royal Navy, the White Ensign was one of three ensigns in use, with each one being assigned to one of the three squadrons of the navy, according to its colour (red, white and blue, with red being the most senior and blue the least). Ships flew the colour of ensign corresponding to the squadron to which they were attached, which was in turn determined by the seniority of the admiral under whose command the ship sailed (a rear admiral of the red was senior to a rear admiral of the white).

In 1864 the Admiralty decided to end the ambiguity caused by the Red Ensign being both a [[civil ensign]] and a naval ensign, and the White Ensign was reserved to the [[Royal Navy]]; the relevant [[Order in Council]] retained the option to use Red or Blue Ensigns in HM Ships if desired.

Royal Navy ships and submarines wear the White Ensign at all times when underway on the surface. The White Ensign may also be worn on a [[Gaff rig|gaff]], and may be shifted to the starboard [[yardarm]] when at sea. When alongside, the White Ensign is worn at the stern, with the Union Jack flag flown as a [[Maritime flag|jack]] at the bow, during daylight hours.

The White Ensign is worn at the mastheads when Royal Navy ships are dressed on special occasions such as the Queen's birthday, and may be similarly be worn by foreign warships when in British waters when dressed in honour of a British holiday or when firing a salute to British authorities.  The White Ensign may also be worn by the boats of commissioned ships. Yachts of the [[Royal Yacht Squadron]] and the Trinity House vessels when escorting the [[British Sovereign|British Monarch]] ([[King of the United Kingdom|King]] or [[Queen of the United Kingdom|Queen]] of the [[United Kingdom]]) are also permitted to wear the White Ensign.&lt;ref&gt;

This includes the [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] Anglican Church in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London, England|London]], which is the [[parish church]] of the [[Admiralty]]. The Ensign is also displayed on the [[Cenotaph]] alongside the [[Union Jack]] flag (for the [[British Army]]) and the [[Royal Air Force Ensign]], in memory of the dead in the World Wars.  Special permission was granted to any individual or body to fly the White Ensign to mark [[Trafalgar Day]] and the victory in the naval [[Battle of Trafalgar]] on its 201st anniversary in 2006.  

The [[United States Navy|U.S. Navy]] destroyer {{USS| Winston S. Churchill|DDG-81|2}} is the only U.S. warship to fly the White Ensign along with the [[Flag of the United States|Stars and Stripes]] to honour her British namesake, the former [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|prime minister]]{{cn|date=December 2016}}.   [[Isambard Kingdom Brunel|Isambard Kingdom Brunel's]] {{SS|Great Britain}}, although a merchant ship, appears to have worn (and still bears and flies, preserved in dry dock as a historical exhibit / museum ship) the White Ensign, apparently because its first master (an ex-Royal Navy man) brought it with him.

===Commonwealth of Nations===

The White Ensign was historically used, in its unaltered form, by the naval forces of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, with the [[Blue Ensign]] of each of these [[British Dominions|Dominions]] (as they were then known) as a jack. In 1965, with the adoption of the Maple Leaf [[Canadian flag]], Canada stopped using the White Ensign on its naval vessels in favour of the new flag. Following a reorganisation of the Canadian armed forces in 1968, a new "white ensign" was adopted, incorporating the Canadian flag in the canton and a badge in the fly. This flag, however, was until 2013 not used as the ensign, but as the jack, and also as the basis of the queen's colours of the Royal Canadian Navy. In May 2013 the Canadian "white ensign" became the ensign and the national flag the jack. Many Canadian veterans' organisations still use the original White and Blue Ensigns unofficially as symbols of history and heritage.

During Australia's involvement in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]], the RAN modified the White Ensign (1967) to create a uniquely Australian ensign which would avoid any confusion with UK vessels; Britain was not involved in the conflict.  New Zealand followed suit in 1968.  The modified RAN and RNZN White Ensigns incorporate the Union Flag in the first quarter, but with the [[Southern Cross]] designs from each national flag (blue stars for the RAN and red stars for the RNZN) replacing St. George's Cross.

Several other Commonwealth navies also use naval ensigns with a visual connection to the White Ensign. For example, the Indian Navy and the [[South African Navy]] have both retained a cross on a white field, with their own national flag in the canton, in place of the Union Flag. The Royal Indian Marine (Royal Indian Navy from 1934) used the unaltered White Ensign as its ensign from 1928 until 26 January 1950, when India became a republic within the Commonwealth. After that date, the RIN became the Indian Navy and the Union Jack in the canton was replaced with the Indian Tricolour. Apart from a brief period from 2001–2004, the Indian Navy has retained its variant of the White Ensign with one minor modification: the addition of the [[Lion Capital of Asoka]] crest in gold at the centre of the cross. Effective from 15 August 2014, the Indian national motto ''"Satyameva Jayate"'' ("Truth Alone Triumphs") will be added in gold script below the crest, correcting a long-standing omission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/indian-navy-correct-anomaly-satyameva-jayate-pranab-mukherjee-aamir-khan/1/375586.html | title =Indian Navy to finally include Satyameva Jayata below national emblem on its flag and crest | publisher = IndiaToday| date = 8 August 2014 | accessdate = 8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from being flown by the [[Arleigh Burke class destroyer]] {{USS|Winston S.

===Non military usage===
[[File:Flag of the British Antarctic Territory.svg|thumb|right|The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]]]]
The [[Flag of the British Antarctic Territory]] is a white ensign defaced with the territory's [[Coat of Arms of the British Antarctic Territory|coat of arms]]. This is the only white ensign in use by a [[British Overseas Territory]].

A White Ensign, without [[Saint Patrick's Saltire]], defaced with a blue lighthouse in the fly, is the Commissioners' flag of the [[Northern Lighthouse Board]]. This flag is unique as it uses a pre-1801 Union Flag in the canton.

The [[burgee]] of the Royal Naval Tot Club of Antigua and Barbuda is sometimes misidentified as a White Ensign; the burgee is a white swallowtail pennant (similar to a [[Royal Navy]] [[Commodore (Royal Navy)|Commodore]]'s) with the [[Union Flag]] is use until 1801 in the upper hoist canton.

In the 19th and early 20th century, steamers of the [[Furness Railway]] on [[Lake Windemere]] flew the white ensign "as the admiralty only exercised jurisdiction over the high seas" and "repeated requests from the admiralty to desist were met with polite refusals"&lt;ref&gt;Peascod, Herbert &amp; Quayle (2009) "The lake windemere Cruise" Railway Bylines 15/2 Jan 2010, pp54-61&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Government Ensign of the Bahamas.svg|thumb|right|The Government Ensign of the [[Bahamas]]]]

The [[Bahamas]] uses a variant of its white ensign, with a blue cross instead of the red Cross of St George found on the military ensign, as a government and 'non combatant' ensign, serving a similar purpose to the [[United Kingdom|UK]]'s [[Blue Ensign]].

'''William Lloyd Garrison''' (December {{notatypo|10}}, 1805 – May 23, 1879) 
&lt;!-- Encyclopedia Britannica says Dec 10 for the DOB. Please do not alter this without providing a more reliable source --&gt; 
was a prominent American [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]], journalist, [[suffragist]], and social reformer. He is best known as the editor of the abolitionist newspaper ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', which he founded with [[Isaac Knapp]] in 1831 and published in Massachusetts until slavery was abolished by Constitutional amendment after the [[American Civil War]]. He was one of the founders of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]], and promoted "immediate emancipation" of [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] in the United States.

Born in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], Garrison began his newspaper career as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He became involved in the anti-slavery movement in the 1820s, and over time he rejected both the [[American Colonization Society]] and the gradualist views of most others involved in the movement. Garrison co-founded ''The Liberator'' to espouse his abolitionist views, and in 1832 he organized the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]]. This society expanded into the American Anti-Slavery Society, which espoused the position that slavery should be immediately abolished. Garrison also emerged as a leading advocate of women's rights, which prompted a split in the abolitionist community. In the 1870s, Garrison became a prominent voice for the [[Women's suffrage in the United States|women's suffrage movement]].

==Early life and education==
[[File:William Lloyd Garrison by Southworth and Hawes, c1850.png|upright|thumb|left|Garrison circa 1850]]
Garrison was born on December 10, 1805, in [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]],&lt;ref&gt;Ehrlich, Eugene and Gorton Carruth. ''The Oxford Illustrated Literary Guide to the United States''. New York: Oxford University Press, 1982: 53. {{ISBN|0-19-503186-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; the son of immigrants from the British colony of [[New Brunswick]], in present-day Canada. Under [[An Act for the relief of sick and disabled seamen]], Abijah Garrison, a merchant sailing pilot and master, had obtained American papers and moved his family to Newburyport in 1806. The U.S. [[Embargo Act of 1807]], intended to injure Great Britain, caused a decline in American commercial shipping. The elder Garrison became unemployed and deserted the family in 1808. Garrison's mother was Frances Maria Lloyd, reported to have been tall, charming, and of a strong religious character. She started referring to their son William as Lloyd, his middle name, to preserve her family name. She died in 1823, in the city of [[Baltimore, Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;Henry Mayer, "All on Fire: William Lloyd Garrison and the Abolition of Slavery", (New York: St. Martin's Press, 1998), 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison sold home-made lemonade and candy as a youth, and also delivered wood to help support the family. In 1818, at 13, Garrison began working as an apprentice compositor for the ''[[Newburyport Herald]].'' He soon began writing articles, often under the pseudonym ''[[Aristides]].'' Aristides was an Athenian statesman and general nicknamed "the Just." After his apprenticeship ended, Garrison and a young printer named [[Isaac Knapp]] bought their own newspaper in 1826, the short-lived ''Free Press''. One of their regular contributors was poet and abolitionist [[John Greenleaf Whittier]]. In this early work as a small town newspaper writer, Garrison acquired skills he would later use as a nationally known writer, speaker and newspaper publisher. In 1828, he was appointed editor of the ''National Philanthropist'' in [[Boston|Boston, Massachusetts]], the first American journal to promote legally-mandated temperance.

==Career==
{{Slavery}}

===Reformer===
At the age of 25, Garrison joined the anti-slavery movement, later crediting the 1826 book of [[Presbyterian Church|Presbyterian]] [[John Rankin (abolitionist)|Reverend John Rankin]], ''Letters on Slavery'', for attracting him to the cause.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, p.&amp;nbsp;58&lt;/ref&gt; For a brief time he became associated with the [[American Colonization Society]], an organization that promoted the resettlement of free blacks to a territory (now known as [[Liberia]]) on the west coast of Africa. Although some members of the society encouraged granting freedom to slaves, others considered relocation a means to reduce the number of already free blacks in the United States. Southern members thought reducing the threat of free blacks in society would help preserve the institution of slavery. By late 1829–1830, "Garrison rejected colonization, publicly apologized for his error, and then, as was typical of him, he censured all who were committed to it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=William E.|last=Cain|title=William Lloyd Garrison and the fight against Slavery: Selections from the Liberatoa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Genius of Universal Emancipation''===
Garrison began writing for and became co-editor with [[Benjamin Lundy]] of the [[Quaker]] newspaper ''[[Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'' in [[Baltimore]], Maryland. With his experience as a printer and newspaper editor, Garrison changed the layout of the paper and handled other operation issues. Lundy was freed to spend more time touring as an anti-slavery speaker. Garrison initially shared Lundy's gradualist views, but while working for the ''Genius'', he became convinced of the need to demand immediate and complete emancipation. Lundy and Garrison continued to work together on the paper in spite of their differing views. Each signed his own editorials.

Garrison introduced "The Black List," a column devoted to printing short reports of "the barbarities of slavery—kidnappings, whippings, murders."&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, 119&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, Garrison reported that [[Francis Todd]], a shipper from Garrison's home town of [[Newburyport, Massachusetts]], was involved in the domestic [[slave trade]], and that he had recently had slaves shipped from Baltimore to [[New Orleans]] in the [[coastwise trade]] on his ship the ''Francis''. (This was thoroughly legal, although the US had in 1807 prohibited the international slave trade from Africa.)

Todd filed a suit for libel in Maryland against both Garrison and Lundy; he thought to gain support from pro-slavery courts. The state of Maryland also brought criminal charges against Garrison, quickly finding him guilty and ordering him to pay a fine of $50 and court costs. (Charges against Lundy were dropped on the grounds that he had been traveling when the story was printed.) Garrison refused to pay the fine and was sentenced to a jail term of six months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Masur|first1=Louis|title=1831, Year of Eclipse|date=2001|publisher=Hill and Wang|location=New York|edition=7th}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was released after seven weeks when the anti-slavery philanthropist [[Arthur Tappan]] donated the money for the fine. Garrison decided to leave Baltimore, and he and Lundy amicably agreed to part ways.

===''The Liberator''===
In 1831, Garrison returned to New England, where he co-founded a weekly anti-slavery newspaper, ''[[The Liberator (anti-slavery newspaper)|The Liberator]]'', with his friend Isaac Knapp.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Boston Directory |year=1831 |url=https://archive.org/stream/stimpsonsbostond3132adam#page/4/mode/1up |quote=Garrison &amp; Knapp, editors and proprietors Liberator, 10 Merchants Hall, Congress Street }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first issue, Garrison stated:

{{quote|I am aware that many object to the severity of my language; but is there not cause for severity? I will be as harsh as truth, and as uncompromising as justice. On this subject, I do not wish to think, or speak, or write, with moderation. No! No! Tell a man whose house is on fire to give a moderate alarm; tell him to moderately rescue his wife from the hands of the ravisher; tell the mother to gradually extricate her babe from the fire into which it has fallen;—but urge me not to use moderation in a cause like the present. I am in earnest—I will not equivocate—I will not excuse—I will not retreat a single inch—{{em|and I will be heard}}. The apathy of the people is enough to make every statue leap from its pedestal, and to hasten the resurrection of the dead.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/Willis/Civil_War/documents/Liberator.html William Lloyd Garrison, ''The Liberator'' (Inaugural editorial)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040329190225/http://www.sewanee.edu/faculty/Willis/Civil_War/documents/Liberator.html |date=March 29, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Paid subscription to ''The Liberator'' was always smaller than its circulation. In 1834 it had two thousand subscribers, three-fourths of whom were blacks. Benefactors paid to have the newspaper distributed to influential statesmen and public officials. Although Garrison rejected physical force as a means for ending slavery, his critics took his demand for immediate emancipation literally. Some believed he advocated the sudden and total freeing of all slaves, and considered him a dangerous fanatic. [[Nat Turner]]'s slave rebellion in Virginia just seven months after ''The Liberator'' started publication fueled the outcry against Garrison in the South. A North Carolina grand jury indicted him for distributing incendiary material, and the Georgia Legislature offered a $5,000 reward for his capture and conveyance to the state for trial.

Among the anti-slavery essays and poems which Garrison published in ''The Liberator'' was an article in 1856 by a 14-year-old [[Anna Elizabeth Dickinson|Anna Dickinson]].

''The Liberator'' gradually gained a large following in the northern states. By 1861 it had subscribers across the North, as well as in England, Scotland, and Canada. It was received in state legislatures, governor's mansions, Congress, and the White House. After the end of the Civil War and the abolition of slavery by the [[Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Thirteenth Amendment]], Garrison published the last issue (number 1,820) on December 29, 1865, writing a "Valedictory" column. After reviewing his long career in journalism and the cause of abolitionism, he wrote:

{{quote| The object for which the ''Liberator'' was commenced—the extermination of chattel slavery—having been gloriously consummated, it seems to me specially appropriate to let its existence cover the historic period of the great struggle; leaving what remains to be done to complete the work of emancipation to other instrumentalities, (of which I hope to avail myself,) under new auspices, with more abundant means, and with millions instead of hundreds for allies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fair-use.org/the-liberator/1865/12/29/valedictory Valedictory (1865-12-29): by William Lloyd Garrison&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]. The first part of the column included the following: "Commencing my editorial career when only twenty years of age, I have followed it continuously till I have attained my sixtieth year—first, in connection with ''The Free Press'', in Newburyport, in the spring of 1826; next, with ''The National Philanthropist'', in Boston, in 1827; next, with ''The Journal of the Times'', in Bennington, Vt., in 1828–9; next, with ''[[The Genius of Universal Emancipation]]'', in Baltimore, in 1829–30; and, finally, with the ''Liberator'', in Boston, from January 1, 1831, to January 1, 1866;—at the start, probably the youngest member of the editorial fraternity in the land, now, perhaps, the oldest, not in years, but in continuous service,—unless [[William Cullen Bryant|Mr. Bryant]], of the [[New York Evening Post|New York ''Evening Post'']], be an exception. ..."&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Helen Eliza Benson Garrison.png|thumb|upright|Portrait of Garrison's wife, Helen Eliza Benson]]

===Organization and reaction===
In addition to publishing ''The Liberator'', Garrison spearheaded the organization of a new movement to demand the total abolition of slavery in the United States. By January 1832, he had attracted enough followers to organize the [[New-England Anti-Slavery Society]] which, by the following summer, had dozens of affiliates and several thousand members. In December 1833, abolitionists from ten states founded the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] (AAS). Although the New England society reorganized in 1835 as the Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society, enabling state societies to form in the other New England states, it remained the hub of anti-slavery agitation throughout the antebellum period. Many affiliates were organized by women who responded to Garrison's appeals for women to take active part in the abolition movement. The largest of these was the [[Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society]], which raised funds to support The Liberator, publish anti-slavery pamphlets, and conduct anti-slavery petition drives.

The purpose of the American Anti-Slavery Society was the conversion of all Americans to the philosophy that "Slaveholding is a heinous crime in the sight of God" and that "duty, safety, and best interests of all concerned, require its ''immediate abandonment'' without expatriation."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in: Clifton E. Olmstead (1960): ''History of Religion in the United States''. Englewood Cliffs, N.J., p. 369&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, on September 4, 1834, Garrison married Helen Eliza Benson (1811–1876), the daughter of a retired abolitionist merchant. The couple had five sons and two daughters, of whom a son and a daughter died as children.
[[File:WilliamLloydGarrison.JPG|thumb|left|upright|William Lloyd Garrison, engraving from 1879 newspaper]]

The threat posed by anti-slavery organizations and their activity drew violent reaction from slave interests in both the Southern and Northern states, with mobs breaking up anti-slavery meetings, assaulting lecturers, ransacking anti-slavery offices, burning postal sacks of anti-slavery pamphlets, and destroying anti-slavery presses. Healthy bounties were offered in Southern states for the capture of Garrison, "dead or alive".&lt;ref&gt;David Brion Davis, ''Inhuman Bondage. The Rise and Fall of Slavery in the New World'', Oxford University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0195140737}}, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 21, 1835, a mob of several thousand surrounded the building housing Boston's anti-slavery offices, where Garrison had agreed to address a meeting of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society after the fiery British abolitionist [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] was unable to keep his engagement with them. Mayor [[Theodore Lyman (militiaman)|Theodore Lyman]] persuaded the women to leave the building, but when the mob learned that Thompson was not within, they began yelling for Garrison. Lyman was a staunch anti-abolitionist but nonetheless wanted to avoid bloodshed and suggested Garrison escape by a back window while Lyman told the crowd Garrison was gone.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 201–04&lt;/ref&gt; The mob spotted and apprehended Garrison, tied a rope around his waist, and pulled him through the streets towards [[Boston Common]], calling for tar and feathers. The mayor intervened and had Garrison arrested and rushed off to the [[Leverett Street Jail]] for his own protection.

===The woman question and division===
[[File:Anne Whitney, William Lloyd Garrison.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anne Whitney]], ''William Lloyd Garrison'', 1879, [[Massachusetts Historical Society]]]]
Garrison's appeal for women's mass petitioning against slavery sparked a controversy over women's right to a political voice. In 1837, women abolitionists from seven states convened in New York to expand their petitioning efforts and repudiate the social mores that proscribed their participation in public affairs. That summer, sisters [[Angelina Grimké]] and [[Sarah Grimké]] responded to the controversy roused by their public speaking with treatises on woman's rights – Angelina's "Letters to Catherine E. Beecher"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/letterstocather00beecgoog "Letters to Catherine E. Beecher"], Knapp (1838), Boston&lt;/ref&gt; and Sarah's "Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman"&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/lettersonequali00grimgoog "Letters on the Equality of the Sexes and Condition of Woman"], Knapp (1838), Boston&lt;/ref&gt; – and Garrison published them first in ''The Liberator'' and then in book form. Instead of surrendering to appeals for him to retreat on the "woman question," Garrison announced in December 1837 that ''The Liberator'' would support "the rights of woman to their utmost extent." The Massachusetts Anti-Slavery Society appointed women to leadership positions and hired Abby Kelley as the first of several female field agents.

In 1840, Garrison's promotion of woman's rights within the anti-slavery movement was one of the issues that caused some abolitionists, including New York brothers [[Arthur Tappan]] and [[Lewis Tappan]], to leave the AAS and form the [[American and Foreign Anti-Slavery Society]], which did not admit women. In June of that same year, when the [[World Anti-Slavery Convention]] meeting in London refused to seat America's women delegates: Garrison, Charles Lenox Remond, Nathaniel P. Rogers and William Adams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Seldon|first1=Horace|title=The 'Women's Question' and Garrison|url=http://www.theliberatorfiles.com/the-woman-question-and-garrison/|website=The liberator files|accessdate=9 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; refused to take their seat as delegates as well, and joined the women in the spectator's gallery. The controversy introduced the woman's rights question not only to England, but also to future woman's rights leader [[Elizabeth Cady Stanton]], who attended the convention as a spectator accompanying her delegate-husband, [[Henry B. Stanton]].

Although Henry Stanton had cooperated in the Tappans' failed attempt to wrest leadership of the AAS from Garrison, he was part of another group of abolitionists unhappy with Garrison's influence—those who disagreed with Garrison's insistence that because the U.S. Constitution was a pro-slavery document, abolitionists should not participate in politics and government. A growing number of abolitionists—including Stanton, [[Gerrit Smith]], [[Charles Turner Torrey]], and [[Amos A. Phelps]]—wanted to form an anti-slavery political party and seek a political solution to slavery. They withdrew from the AAS in 1840, formed the Liberty Party, and nominated [[James G. Birney]] for president. By the end of 1840, Garrison announced the formation of a third new organization, the [[Friends of Universal Reform]], with sponsors and founding members including prominent reformers [[Maria Weston Chapman|Maria Chapman]], [[Abby Kelley|Abby Kelley Foster]], Oliver Johnson, and [[Amos Bronson Alcott]] (father of [[Louisa May Alcott]]).{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

Although some members of the Liberty Party supported woman's rights, including [[women's suffrage]], Garrison's ''Liberator'' continued to be the leading advocate of woman's rights throughout the 1840s, publishing editorials, speeches, legislative reports and other developments concerning the subject. In February 1849, Garrison's name headed the women's suffrage petition sent to the Massachusetts legislature, the first such petition sent to any American legislature, and he supported the subsequent annual suffrage petition campaigns organized by Lucy Stone and Wendell Phillips. Garrison took a leading role in the May 30, 1850, meeting that called the first National Woman's Rights Convention, saying in his address to that meeting that the new movement should make securing the ballot to women its primary goal.&lt;ref&gt;"Women's Rights Convention," ''Liberator'', June 7, 1850&lt;/ref&gt; At the national convention held in Worcester the following October, Garrison was appointed to the National Woman's Rights Central Committee, which served as the movement's executive committee, charged with carrying out programs adopted by the conventions, raising funds, printing proceedings and tracts, and organizing annual conventions.&lt;ref&gt;Million, Joelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ydeGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q ''Woman's Voice, Woman's Place: Lucy Stone and the Birth of the Women's Rights Movement.''] Praeger, 2003. {{ISBN|0-275-97877-X}}, pp. 104, 109, 293 note 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Controversy===
In 1849, Garrison became involved in one of Boston's most notable trials of the time. [[Washington Goode]], a black seaman had been sentenced to death for the murder of a fellow black mariner, Thomas Harding. In ''The Liberator'' Garrison argued that the verdict relied on "circumstantial evidence of the most flimsy character&amp;nbsp;..." and feared that the determination of the government to uphold its decision to execute Goode was based on race. As all other death sentences since 1836 in Boston had been commuted, Garrison concluded that Goode would be the last person executed in Boston for a capital offense writing, "Let it not be said that the last man Massachusetts bore to hang was a colored man!" Despite the efforts of Garrison and many other prominent figures of the time, Goode was hanged on May 25, 1849.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Garrison became famous as one of the most articulate, as well as most radical, opponents of slavery. His approach to emancipation stressed "moral suasion," non-violence, and passive resistance. While some other abolitionists of the time favored gradual emancipation, Garrison argued for "immediate and complete emancipation of all slaves." On July 4, 1854, he publicly burned a copy of the Constitution, condemning it as "a Covenant with Death, an Agreement with Hell," referring to the compromise that had written slavery into the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;''Boston Daily Atlas'', July 6, 1854, Issue 4; col D.(Accessed via Infortrac on 9/5/2012)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1855, his eight-year alliance with [[Frederick Douglass]] disintegrated when Douglass converted to political abolitionists' view that the document could be interpreted as being anti-slavery.

Garrison's outspoken anti-slavery views repeatedly put him in danger. Besides his imprisonment in Baltimore and the price placed on his head by the State of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], he was the object of vituperation and frequent death threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/William_L._Garrison|title=William L. Garrison - Ohio History Central|website=www.ohiohistorycentral.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the eve of the Civil War, a sermon preached in a Universalist chapel in [[Brooklyn]], New York, denounced "the blood thirsty sentiments of Garrison and his school; and did not wonder that the feeling of the South was exasperated, taking as they did, the insane and bloody ravings of the Garrisonian traitors for the fairly expressed opinions of the North."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Brooklyn Daily Eagle]]'', Dec. 31, 1860, p. 3; the paper pronounced this an "admirable discourse."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:William Lloyd Garrison carte de visite.jpeg|thumb|left|upright|Photograph of Garrison]]

===After abolition===
After the United States abolished slavery, Garrison announced in May 1865 that he would resign the presidency of the [[American Anti-Slavery Society]] and offered a resolution declaring victory in the struggle against slavery and dissolving the society. The resolution prompted sharp debate, however, led by his long-time friend [[Wendell Phillips]], who argued that the mission of the AAS was not fully completed until black Southerners gained full political and civil equality. Garrison maintained that while complete civil equality was vitally important, the special task of the AAS was at an end, and that the new task would best be handled by new organizations and new leadership. With his long-time allies deeply divided, however, he was unable to muster the support he needed to carry the resolution, and it was defeated 118–48. Declaring that his "vocation as an Abolitionist, thank God, has ended," Garrison resigned the presidency and declined an appeal to continue. Returning home to [[Boston]], he withdrew completely from the AAS and ended publication of ''The Liberator'' at the end of 1865. With Wendell Phillips at its head, the AAS continued to operate for five more years, until ratification of the [[Fifteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]] granted voting rights to black men. (According to Henry Mayer, Garrison was hurt by the rejection, and remained peeved for years; "as the cycle came around, always managed to tell someone that he was ''not'' going to the next set of [AAS] meetings" [594].){{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

[[File:Lloyd Garrison dinner bill of fair.JPG|thumb|upright|Dinner bill of fare for Lloyd Garrison, Franklin Club, [[Young's Hotel (Boston)|Young's Hotel]], Boston, October 14, 1878.]]
After his withdrawal from AAS and ending ''The Liberator'', Garrison continued to participate in public reform movements. He supported the causes of [[civil rights]] for [[African American|blacks]] and woman's rights, particularly the campaign for suffrage. He contributed columns on [[Reconstruction Era|Reconstruction]] and civil rights for ''The Independent'' and ''[[The Boston Journal]]''.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

In 1870, he became an associate editor of the women's suffrage newspaper, the ''Woman's Journal'', along with [[Mary Livermore]], [[Thomas Wentworth Higginson]], [[Lucy Stone]], and [[Henry B. Blackwell]]. He served as president of both the [[American Woman Suffrage Association]] (AWSA) and the Massachusetts Woman Suffrage Association. He was a major figure in New England's woman suffrage campaigns during the 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;Merk, Lois Bannister, "Massachusetts and the Woman Suffrage Movement." Ph.D. diss., Harvard University, 1958, Revised, 1961, pp. 14, 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1873, he healed his long estrangements from [[Frederick Douglass]] and [[Wendell Phillips]], affectionately reuniting with them on the platform at an AWSA rally organized by Abby Kelly Foster and Lucy Stone on the one hundredth anniversary of the [[Boston Tea Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 614&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Charles Sumner]] died in 1874, some Republicans suggested Garrison as a possible successor to his Senate seat; Garrison declined on grounds of his moral opposition to taking office.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 618&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life and death==
Garrison spent more time at home with his family. He wrote weekly letters to his children and cared for his increasingly ill wife, Helen. She had suffered a small stroke on December 30, 1863, and was increasingly confined to the house. Helen died on January 25, 1876, after a severe cold worsened into [[pneumonia]]. A quiet funeral was held in the Garrison home. Garrison, overcome with grief and confined to his bedroom with a fever and severe [[bronchitis]], was unable to join the service. [[Wendell Phillips]] gave a eulogy and many of Garrison's old abolitionist friends joined him upstairs to offer their private condolences.{{Citation needed|date=November 2017}}

Garrison recovered slowly from the loss of his wife and began to attend [[Spiritualist]] circles in the hope of communicating with Helen.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 621&lt;/ref&gt; Garrison last visited England in 1877, where he met with [[George Thompson (abolitionist)|George Thompson]] and other longtime friends from the British abolitionist movement.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 622&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:WilliamLloydGarrisonGrave.jpg|thumb|Grave of William Lloyd Garrison]]

Suffering from kidney disease, Garrison continued to weaken during April 1879. He moved to New York to live with his daughter Fanny's family. In late May, his condition worsened, and his five surviving children rushed to join him. Fanny asked if he would enjoy singing some hymns. Although he was unable to sing, his children sang favorite hymns while he beat time with his hands and feet. On May 24, 1879, Garrison lost consciousness and died just before midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 626&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison was buried in the [[Forest Hills Cemetery]] in Boston's [[Jamaica Plain]] neighborhood on May 28, 1879. At the public memorial service, eulogies were given by [[Theodore Dwight Weld]] and [[Wendell Phillips]]. Eight abolitionist friends, both white and black, served as his pallbearers. Flags were flown at half-staff all across [[Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 627–628&lt;/ref&gt; [[Frederick Douglass]], then employed as a [[United States Marshal]], spoke in memory of Garrison at a memorial service in a church in Washington, D.C., saying, "It was the glory of this man that he could stand alone with the truth, and calmly await the result."&lt;ref&gt;Mayer, 631&lt;/ref&gt;

Garrison's namesake son, [[William Lloyd Garrison II|William Lloyd Garrison]] (1838–1909), was a prominent advocate of the [[Georgism|single tax]], free trade, women's suffrage, and of the repeal of the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]]. His second son, [[Wendell Phillips Garrison]] (1840–1907), was literary editor of ''[[The Nation]]'' from 1865 to 1906. Two other sons (George Thompson Garrison and Francis Jackson Garrison, his biographer and named after abolitionist [[Francis Jackson (abolitionist)|Francis Jackson]]) and a daughter, [[Fanny Garrison Villard|Helen Frances Garrison]] (who married [[Henry Villard]]), survived him. Fanny's son [[Oswald Garrison Villard]] became a prominent journalist and a founding member of the [[NAACP]].

The '''Working People's Art Class''' (WPAC), founded by [[Edward Rupert Burrowes]] in 1945, was the first established art institution in the colony of [[British Guiana]], now the country of [[Guyana]].{{sfn|Brief on the Burrowe's School of Art}}
A number of well-known Guyanese artists were taught at the WPAC.

==Foundation==

Burrowes started to lead Working People's Free Art Classes in 1945 and formally founded the WPAC organization in 1948.{{sfn|Turner|2000|p=331}}{{sfn|Dabydeen|2010|p=169}}
The name drew the attention of the British authorities, who were concerned that the classes might be a front for a communist organization. They sent two detectives to join the class and see what was going on. One of them, Inspector John Campbell, became interested in drawing and painting and continued with the WPAC, later participating in exhibitions.{{sfn|Greaves|2007}}
By 1947, there were 86 students enrolled in the free WPAC, which had started in [[Georgetown, Guyana|Georgetown]] in April that year.{{sfn|Caribbean Commission|1947|p=238}}

==Operation==

The WPAC was an institution in which common working people could develop their artistic skills.{{sfn|Cambridge|2004}}
As well as teaching the people art history and appreciation, the WPAC contributed to developing a national consciousness, an awareness of the country and its peoples.{{sfn|Seymour|1977|p=38}}
It was funded by businesses and institutions.
Burrowes was the only teacher, and gave classes on traditional Western artistic methods to anyone who chose to attend in whatever space he could find.{{sfn|Turner|2000|p=331}}
The [[British Council]] became interested in the WPAC, and provided help in the form of ₤50 worth of art materials annually, materials that could not otherwise be obtained in [[British Guiana]], as it was then.{{sfn|Greaves|2007}}
The WPAC put on annual shows.
In 1954 its exhibition of paintings and sculpture had contributions from the WPAC and from the Guianese Art Group, the Friday Art Club and the Young Contemporaries' Art Club, as well as from one or two individual artists.{{sfn|Smith|1955|p=331}}
The WPAC continued until 1956.{{sfn|Turner|2000|p=331}}

==Influence==

The WPAC helped a number of Guyanese artists at the start of their career.
In 1947 [[Donald Locke]] attended a Working People's Art Class taught in Georgetown by Burrowes, which inspired him to take up painting.{{sfn|Renowned Artist...}}
Locke later contributed regularly to WPAC exhibitions, and became a secretary or assistant to Burrowes in the early 1950s.{{sfn|Locke|2007}}
[[Stanley Greaves]] was another Guyanese artist who attended the WPAC as a teenager and later became well known.{{sfn|Walmsley|2004}}
[[Emerson Samuels]] was another artist who studied at the WPAC.{{sfn|Samuels made...}}
The painter [[Aubrey Williams]] studied with E. R. Burrowes in the Working People's Art Class after returning from a two-year term with the Agriculture department in which he had lived with indigenous people in the jungle.{{sfn|Williams|Walmsley|1990|p=106}}

'''Zemiology''' is the study of social harms. Zemiology gets its name from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ζημία ''zēmía'', meaning "[[harm]]".&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004"&gt;Hillyard, P. (with C. Pantazis, S. Tombs and D. Gordon) (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', London: Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
It originated as a [[critique]] of [[criminology]] and the notion of [[crime]]. In contrast with "individual-based harms" such as [[theft]], the notion of social harm or social injury incorporates harms caused by [[nation state]]s and [[Corporation|corporations]].&lt;ref&gt;Schwendinger, H. and Schwendinger, J. (1970) "Defenders of order or guardians of human rights" ''Issues in Criminology''&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have received increased attention from critical academics such as [[Neo-Marxism|neo-Marxists]] and [[Feminism|feminists]] who have sought to create an independent field of study, separate from criminology, that studies the harms that affect individuals' lives that are not considered to be criminal or are rarely [[Criminalization|criminalised]] such as [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]] misselling, [[poverty]] and [[unemployment]].&lt;ref name="Hillyard, P. 2004" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Special Issue of Crime, Law and Social Change (2007, vol 48: 1-2)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zemiological critique of criminology and crime==
Hillyard and Tombs outline a number of criticisms of criminology and crime:&lt;ref&gt;see chap 2 (2004) ''Beyond Criminology: Taking Harm Seriously'', Pluto Press&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Crime has no [[Ontology|ontological]] reality" – Crime is a [[Construct (philosophy)|construct]] and is based on social judgements. However, there are no central properties that pertain to the notion of crime; therefore, what is a crime will vary across time and space.
* "Criminology perpetuates the myth of crime" – Criminology is based upon the notion of crime, which fails to adequately address the social construction of the concept. Therefore, criminology's continued use of the notion within its frame of analysis perpetuates the myth that crimes are distinct acts that may be understood as separate social phenomena.
* "Crime consists of many petty events" – In a large proportion of reported crimes, the harms endured by victims, if there are any, are minimal.{{Clarify|reason=vague|date=April 2015}} Hence Hillyard and Tombs argue that "the definitions of crime in the [[criminal law]] do not reflect the only or the most dangerous of antisocial behaviours."
* "Crime excludes many serious harms" – Many events and incidents which cause serious harm are either not part of the criminal law or, if they could be dealt with by it, are either ignored or handled without resort to it. The undue attention given to events which are defined as crimes distracts attention from more serious harm (such as [[pollution]] or poverty).
* {{Double single}}Crime control' is ineffective" – Hillyard and Tombs have argued that the methods and approach to crime control have patently failed. They believe the criminal justice system is unsuccessful in fulfilling its aims and in reforming criminal offenders. It appears that the criminal justice system sees there is only one solution to crime control, and that is a [[prison]] [[Sentence (law)|sentence]]; however, it is questionable whether this actually resolves certain crimes in society.
* {{Double single}}Crime' gives legitimacy to the expansion of crime control" – Since the early 1990s, governments have emphasised crime control as a key concern, and crime control has increased faster than any other area of public expenditure.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Consequently, security firms have increasingly sought to provide services to the burgeoning penal state. It is argued that these private interests have played a key part in the expansion of prison, as means to deal with social problems.
* "Contrasting 'crimes{{Single double}} – The criminal law uses different tests to determine whether a crime has been committed. The principal test is the concept of ''[[mens rea]]'' – the guilty mind – which applies to the individual but not exclusively. However, these tests are not objective and often rely on subjective judgements about an individual's actions. ''Mens rea'' has to be judged by proxy, examining both a person's words and deeds. This becomes an even more complex task when applying the test an organisation, particularly as the harms caused by organisations result from the actions or inactions of a number of individuals and omission rather than intent. Therefore, harms caused by organisations are rarely criminalised.
* "Criminalisation and punishment inflict pain" – The criminal justice system has many stages which inflict pain in a discrete manner: defining, classifying, broadcasting, disposing and punishing the offender. Furthermore, these processes create wider social problems which bear no or little relationship to the initial crime and the original pain that was caused. For example, they may lead to loss of jobs, family problems or [[ostracism]].

==Harms of the criminal justice system==
Hillyard and Tombs argue that the criminal justice system fails to protect people from criminal harms whilst inflicting serious harms on those people who travel through the system. These harms often outweigh the harm caused by the original crime. However, current criminal justice policy within countries like the UK continues to champion the use of prison as a means to deal with social problems. In 2002, the UK prison population was 80,144. The population rate, per hundred thousand of national population, for England and Wales was 139. These figures are high compared to the rest of Europe in terms of overall numbers; however, looking at prison population rate, they are similar to many other countries in Europe. Italy, Spain, France, Romania and Belarus each had prison populations of around 50,000 in 2001–2002. Only Poland and the Ukraine had prison populations higher than that of the UK, at 82,173 and 198,885 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090325005045/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs2/r188.pdf |date=March 25, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These rising prison numbers however do not necessarily reflect a rise in crime. Overall, since 1995 there has been a reduction in total crime. The [[British Crime Survey]] has shown that the overall crime experienced by households has declined by 42% which is the equivalent to eight million fewer crimes. More specifically, domestic burglary has fallen by 59%, vehicle theft has decreased by 61% and violent crimes have experienced a reduction of 41%. According to these figures it appears that the reason for the growth in the prison population is not due to a rise in crime.
In spite of the faith demonstrated by politicians in the criminal justice system, it would appear{{Says who|date=April 2015}} that the criminal justice system seems to fail in its own terms. The probability of a criminal re-offending is determined by external factors including having a stable family life, a home and a job. All of these are arguably weakened by a prison sentence. The [[Social Exclusion Task Force|Social Exclusion Unit]] has demonstrated that prison fails to rehabilitate on a dramatic scale with two thirds of prisoners re-offending within 2 years of release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lifechangeuk.com/PDF%5CSEU%20-%20Reducing%20re-offending%20by%20ex-prisoners.pdf www.lifechangeuk.com: reducing re-offending by ex-prisoners]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a prison place costs £37,000 per annum.

=== Relation of welfare benefits to prison population ===

Concern has been expressed{{By whom|date=April 2015}} that the prison is being used as a mechanism to deal with social problems as spending on welfare benefits and services has decreased. Downes and Hansen argue that a country's welfare spending and prison population are inversely related, meaning that a country with high spending on welfare has a lower prison population and vice versa. Portugal, for example, has 147 prisoners per 100,000 people but spend only 18.2% of their GDP on welfare. This is quite a contrast to Scandinavian states, such as Sweden, whose prison population is 60 prisoners per 100,000 people as they spend 31% of GDP on welfare. During the 1990s the UK, whose spending on welfare is 20.8% GDP, saw an increase of 40% in the number of custodial sentences passed out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crimeandjustice.org.uk/opus304.html|title=Welfare and punishment. The relationship between welfare spending and imprisonment|work=crimeandjustice.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is arguably reflected in the composition of the UK's prison population. For example, almost half of the prison population in Britain has been diagnosed with 3 or more mental disorders.&lt;ref name="revdoor"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|title=Documents - Revolving Doors Agency|work=revolving-doors.org.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090107032201/http://www.revolving-doors.org.uk/documents/reports/Prisons_Britains_Social_Dustbin_070915.pdf|archive-date=7 January 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those prisoners diagnosed with a mental health problem: 50% of these prisoners are not registered with a GP; 42% of men with a psychotic disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 79% of men with a personality disorder received no emotional or mental support in the previous year before imprisonment; 46% have been arrested having never received any benefits despite their disorder; over a third are sleeping rough and over two thirds are not in education or training.&lt;ref name="revdoor"/&gt;

==Broadening perceptions of harm==
=== Physical harm ===

The zemiological or social harm approach attempts to broaden public and sociological focus to [[wikt:vicissitude#Noun|vicissitudes]] of daily life in capitalist society; some of these harms, they argue, are more harmful than those caused by crime. Approximately 1,000 people a year are murdered in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf www.homeoffice.gov.uk: crime 0607 Summary] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090324214809/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/crime0607summ.pdf |date=March 24, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are a number of events that cause large amounts of physical harm and even death, which are rarely considered crime or criminalised. In the UK there are around 40,000 serious road accidents in the UK every year. This is equivalent to a jumbo jet crashing every month. In 2002 3,431 people were killed on Britain’s roads and 35,976 seriously injured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/insideout/southeast/series7/cars.shtml|title=BBC Inside Out - Car Crash|work=bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, 81,562 cases of food poisoning were reported and the majority of these cases are believed to have been contracted in food prepared outside the home.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news/pressreleases/2002/feb/campaign www.food.gov.uk campaign]{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, The [[Labour Force Survey]] found that 228 people were killed while working due to a work-related incident and 2.2 million people with illnesses in the UK believed their condition was made worse by their past or current job.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |title=www.hse.gov.uk |access-date=2014-01-10 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110181600/http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/lfs/lfs0708.pdf |archive-date=2014-01-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A growing phenomenon affecting workers' health is stress. A report issued by the British [[Health and Safety Executive]] found that 16% of workers were working over 60 hours a week.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} Similarly, the [[Department of Trade and Industry (United Kingdom)|Department of Trade and Industry]] found that 19% of men visited doctors for stress related problems, with that figure rising to 23% in men over 40. Also, the [[Trade Union Congress]] found 10% of work-based personal injury cases were stress-related.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazards.org/workedtodeath/dropdead.pdf www.hazards.org]&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[Department of Health]] there were 3500 deaths occurring from the effects of [[Sulfur dioxide#Safety|sulphur dioxide]] and 8100 deaths were caused due to [[Particulate#Health effects|particulate matter]] in the air in July 2002.&lt;ref&gt;See: {{cite web|url=http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm#results |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 10, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807174942/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/statementsreports/airpol7.htm |archivedate=August 7, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Homeowners ===

Equally, the financial costs theft and burglary are outweighed when one considers wider financial harms. For example, thousands of homeowners have been sold [[endowment mortgage]]s without any likely means of repaying them. More than 3 million homeowners face the likelihood that their endowment policy, when it matures, will be worth too little to pay off the mortgage. 60% of endowment mortgages are not on track to cover the original debt and 39,000 complainants looking to receive approximately £126 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/money/2002/oct/27/endowments.observercashsection|title=Endowed with a sense of fear|author=Helen Monks|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Today{{When|date=April 2015}} in Britain 9.5 million people cannot afford adequate housing conditions, 8 million cannot afford one or more essential good, 7.5 million people do not have enough money to attend social activities and 4 million do not receive proper nutrition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bristol.ac.uk/poverty/pse/sum_find.htm|title=1999 PSE - Summary Findings|work=bristol.ac.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responding to social harms ==

Whilst the UK and other liberal democracies spend large resources on their respective criminal justice systems, other regulatory and policy responses remain less well funded considering the extent and the serious nature of the harms they seek to prevent. This is illustrated through the following case examples.

=== Regulating the minimum wage ===

The minimum wage was introduced in 1998 to combat the problem of in-work poverty and inequality. The act established for the first time in the UK a minimum hourly rate of pay. In order, to guarantee that workers received the wage an enforcement structure was created using two methods. These were worker-led [[Industrial Tribunal]] claims and the minimum wage enforcement teams ([[Inland Revenue]]). Few workers have used the employment tribunals to recover money because many victims of breach of minimum wage are vulnerable, for example, ethnic minorities, youth, uneducated and non-unionsed workers. A more likely channel of action is the minimum wage enforcement teams, which are run by the Inland Revenue. These teams have a number of powers including power of entry into workplaces and seizure of employers' records. In order to enforce these regulations through a ‘pyramid of sanctions’,&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34"&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34),&lt;/ref&gt; which include: enforcement order, penalty enforcement and prosecution under criminal law. The enforcement order requests the employer to repay the worker any underpayment. If the employer refuses to comply with this requirement, penalty enforcement is issued which orders the firm to not only repay the worker (s), but to also pay a substantial fine. However, if the employer still refuses payment, as a consequence they will face prosecution under criminal law. This action can, however be seen as ineffective as only two companies have ever been prosecuted for such offences. The low rates of enforcement action are demonstrated below.

&lt;ref&gt;Low Pay Commission http://www.lowpay.gov.uk/lowpay/rep_a_p_index.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated by the [[Low Pay Commission]] that 146,000–219,000 workers are not receiving the wage they are legally entitled too. It has been suggested that the reasons for relate to the limited resources available to the Inland Revenue Enforcement Teams.&lt;ref&gt;Pemberton, S (2008) 'Regulating the minimum wage: a social harm perspective', Criminal Justice Matters, 74(1), (pp. 32-34)&lt;/ref&gt; The Inland Revenue Enforcement Team consists of 16 compliance teams, each with 3 to 8 officers, based in fourteen towns and cities throughout the UK. In 1999 there were 115 Inspectors which meant that a workplace could expect to be inspected once every 30 years.&lt;ref name="Pemberton, S 2008 pp. 32-34" /&gt;

=== Policy responses to inequality ===

Inequality has grown in countries like the UK since the beginning of the 1980s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}} It is argued that this growth in inequality has had a series of deleterious and harmful effects. These include children’s life chances, mental health, physical health, crime and social well being.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009"&gt;Wilkinson RG, Pickett KE. (2009) ''The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better''. London: Penguin&lt;/ref&gt; Using the example of physical, numerous studies have demonstrated that those from lower socio economic classes have lower life expectancy.&lt;ref name="Wilkinson RG 2009" /&gt; For instance a recent{{When|date=April 2015}} research study that investigated differences in health in the 678 electoral wards of the northern region of England found that death rates were four times as high in the poorest 10 per cent of wards as they were in the richest 10 per cent. In the 1980s more and more households fell into poverty and by the early 1990s one in three children lived below the poverty line.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008"&gt;Toynbee P &amp; Walker D (2008) Unjust rewards. London: Granta&lt;/ref&gt;

Inequality is a harm that is perceived{{By whom|date=April 2015}} as an inherent and largely unpreventable feature of our society. Yet a number of academics attribute the current levels of inequality in the UK to a series of policy decisions that have been made over the last 30 years.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"&gt;Gordon, D. &amp;  Pantazis, C. (1997) Breadline Britain in the 1990s. Aldershot: Ashgate Publishing&lt;/ref&gt; The reasons for the growing levels of inequality are numerous. The poorest groups in society have seen their income and wealth affected by developments such as the decreasing value of benefits in real terms, the deregulation of labour markets etc., whilst the rich have seen their wealth grow primarily as a result of the changes made in the UK tax system since 1979.&lt;ref name="Gordon, D. 1997"/&gt; In particular, the top rate of income tax was cut by the [[Premiership of Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher government]] in the first post-1979 election budget from 83% to 60%. Then it was cut to 40%. Moreover, tax havens have increased and become common place which has enabled wealthy individuals and companies to avoid taxation regimes. In fact, tax consultants Grant Thornton estimated that the UK’s 54 billionaires paid income tax of only £14.7 million in 2006. At least 32 paid no income tax at all. In contrast, according to the [[Institute for Fiscal Studies]], £3.4 billion a year would lift enough families out of poverty to hit [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour’s]] pledge of halving child poverty by 2010.&lt;ref name="Toynbee P 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article658376.ece|title=Login|work=timesonline.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating environmental harm ===

It is estimated that 24,000 lives are prematurely ended due to the effects of air pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513065011/http://www.advisorybodies.doh.gov.uk/comeap/ |date=May 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, these health consequences are estimated to cost the UK £29,000 per life year lost in "good" health, £15,000 per life year lost in "poor" health and £1,900–£2,000 per hospital admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|title=Defra UK-AIR - air pollution information for the UK|work=airquality.co.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100218064758/http://www.airquality.co.uk/annualreport/annualreport2007.php|archive-date=18 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the harm caused by air pollution the UK has a poor record in responding to air pollution. The [[European Union#Environment|European Union]] is currently{{When|date=April 2015}} considering prosecuting the British government for breaching air pollution laws. Air pollution near in a number of locations has been recorded at twice the UN's [[World Health Organization]] maximum recommended level, which has consequently infringed EU air quality laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2009/jan/02/air-pollution-laws-britain-eu|title=UK faces court case over air pollution breaches|author=John Vidal|work=the Guardian|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, the Environment Agency, the UK's principal environmental regulator, has what some{{Who|date=April 2015}} may consider to be a poor record of prosecuting infringements of environmental standards. For example, there were 29,627 "substantiated" pollution incidents in 2003, of which 1337 were considered serious by the agency. However, in the same year the agency prosecuted 266 companies, 61 resulted in fines over £10,000. The average fine for companies was £8,412, down from £8,622 in 2002. There are approximately 20,000 incidents each year in the UK and around 250 prosecutions, which means there is a one in eighty chance of company being prosecuted for these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environment-agency.gov.uk/|title=Environment Agency - GOV.UK|work=environment-agency.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regulating health and safety at work ===

Large numbers of people each year lose their lives due to injuries and diseases that result from their work. In 2007–08, 229 workers were killed at work, whilst 136,771 other injuries to employees were reported under [[Reporting of Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous Occurrences Regulations|RIDDOR]] and 299,000 reportable injuries occurred, according to the Labour Force Survey. In addition, 2.1 million people were suffering from an illness they believed was caused or made worse by their current or past work. It is believed that 2056 people died of [[asbestos]] related diseases contracted through their work activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/statistics/causdis/asbestos.htm|title=Statistics - Asbestos related disease|work=hse.gov.uk|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these large scale harms, the principal regulatory in the UK, the Health and Safety Executive, has faced continuing cuts, most notably the 2006 £5.6m reduction in the [[Health and Safety Executive|HSE]] budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hazards.org/commissionimpossible/safetychips.htm|title=HSE is broke - Hazards Magazine issue 96|work=hazards.org|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has had major implications for the ability of the HSE to regulate workplaces with a decreasing numbers of regulatory contacts. A recent [[Trades Union Congress|TUC]] report argued that: &lt;blockquote&gt;Around 85 per cent of major injuries reported to HSE are never investigated ... there is only so much that the 500 or so inspectors in HSE's Field Operations Division (FOD) can achieve. This means that very serious career-ending accidents go unpunished simply because there is no one to gather the evidence. The number of prosecutions is now half what it was in the early 1990s – this simply means that more employers are getting away with it, not that they are more compliant.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071003120740/https://www.tuc.org.uk/h_and_s/tuc-12542-f0.cfm |date=October 3, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
