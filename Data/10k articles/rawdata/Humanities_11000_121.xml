'''''Acting Shakespeare''''' is a one-man show of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespearean]] [[monologue]]s interspersed with theatrical anecdotes devised and performed by [[Ian McKellen]]. McKellen first performed the recital in [[Scandinavia]] in 1980 and later performed it throughout the world. It was broadcast by [[PBS]] in 1982. For the 1984 [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] engagement, McKellen received the [[Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show]] and a [[Tony Award]] nomination. He received internationally rave reviews with some calling him "The new Olivier" and "The greatest classical actor of our generation". The most recent performance was in [[Jersey Opera House]] in 1990.

In 1993 McKellen developed another one-man show, 'A Knight Out' (using the play on word as a result of his being knighted in 1991) but this time focusing, as well as stage roles, his now ever increasing film roles. As with Acting Shakespeare he toured around England, Europe and America to great acclaim.

A predecessor of this show's format was Sir [[John Gielgud]]'s [[Ages of Man (play)]] which consisted of Gielgud in front of an audience with a mixture of both speeches and anecdotes.

'''''An Old Woman Dozing''''' (circa 1656) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Nicolaes Maes]]. It is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium]].

The woman is dozing over a book and on the table next to her is a [[lace pillow]] for [[bobbin lace]]. Lace pillows were a favorite subject by Maes, who painted them with their owners:

&lt;/gallery&gt;

This painting was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1914, who wrote; "99. AN OLD WOMAN DOZING OVER HER BOOK. 
She is in black with a white cap. She sits on a chair facing the spectator. 
Her spectacles are in her right hand, which rests on a Bible in her lap.

{{place of articulation}}

The field of '''articulatory phonetics''' is a subfield of [[phonetics]].  In studying [[articulation (phonetics)|articulation]], phoneticians explain how humans produce speech [[sound]]s via the interaction of different [[physiological]] structures.

Generally, articulatory phonetics is concerned with the transformation of [[aerodynamic]] [[energy]] into [[Acoustics|acoustic]] energy. Aerodynamic energy refers to the airflow through the [[vocal tract]]. Its [[Potential energy|potential]] form is [[air pressure]]; its [[Kinetic energy|kinetic]] form is the actual [[Dynamics (physics)|dynamic]] airflow. Acoustic energy is variation in the air pressure that can be represented as [[sound waves]], which are then perceived by the human [[auditory system]] as sound.&lt;ref&gt;Note that although sound is just air pressure variations, the variations must be at a high enough rate to be perceived as sound. If the variation is too slow, it will be inaudible.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Components==

The vocal tract can be viewed through an aerodynamic-[[biomechanic]] model that includes three main components:

# air cavities
# pistons
# air valves

Air [[body cavity|cavities]] are containers of air [[molecule]]s of specific [[volume]]s and [[mass]]es. The main air cavities present in the articulatory system are the supraglottal cavity and the subglottal cavity. They are so-named because the [[glottis]], the openable space between the [[vocal folds]] internal to the [[larynx]], separates the two cavities. The supraglottal cavity or the orinasal cavity is divided into an [[human oral cavity|oral subcavity]] (the cavity from the glottis to the [[lip]]s excluding the nasal cavity) and a [[nasal cavity|nasal subcavity]] (the cavity from the velopharyngeal port, which can be closed by raising the [[Soft palate|velum]]). The subglottal cavity consists of the [[Vertebrate trachea|trachea]] and the [[lung]]s. The [[atmosphere]] external to the articulatory stem may also be considered an air cavity whose potential connecting points with respect to the body are the nostrils and the lips.

[[Piston]]s are initiators. The term ''initiator'' refers to the fact that they are used to initiate a change in the volumes of air cavities, and, by [[Boyle's Law]], the corresponding air [[pressure]] of the cavity. The term ''initiation'' refers to the change. Since changes in air pressures between connected cavities lead to airflow between the cavities, initiation is also referred to as an ''[[airstream mechanism]]''. The three pistons present in the articulatory system are the larynx, the [[tongue]] body, and the physiological structures used to manipulate lung volume (in particular, the floor and the walls of the [[chest]]). The lung pistons are used to initiate a [[pulmonic]] airstream (found in all human languages). The larynx is used to initiate the [[glottalic]] airstream mechanism by changing the volume of the supraglottal and subglottal cavities via vertical movement of the larynx (with a closed glottis). [[Ejective]]s and [[implosive]]s are made with this airstream mechanism. The tongue body creates a velaric airsteam by changing the pressure within the oral cavity: the tongue body changes the mouth subcavity. [[Click consonant]]s use the velaric airstream mechanism. Pistons are controlled by various [[muscle]]s.

[[Valve]]s regulate airflow between cavities. Airflow occurs when an air valve is open and there is a pressure difference between the connecting cavities. When an air valve is closed, there is no airflow. The air valves are the vocal folds (the glottis), which regulate between the supraglottal and subglottal cavities, the velopharyngeal port, which regulates between the oral and nasal cavities, the tongue, which regulates between the oral cavity and the atmosphere, and the lips, which also regulate between the oral cavity and the atmosphere. Like the pistons, the air valves are also controlled by various muscles.

== Initiation ==
To produce any kind of sound, there must be movement of air. To produce sounds that people can interpret as spoken words, the movement of air must pass through the vocal cords, up through the throat and, into the mouth or nose to then leave the body. Different sounds are formed by different positions of the mouth—or, as linguists call it, "the oral cavity" (to distinguish it from the nasal cavity).

== The two classes of sounds ==
Sounds of all languages fall under two categories: Consonants and Vowels.

=== Consonants ===
Consonants are produced with some form of restriction or closing in the vocal tract that hinders the airflow from the lungs. Consonants are classified according to where in the vocal tract the airflow has been restricted. This is also known as the place of articulation.

==== Places of articulation ====
{{Main|Place of articulation}}
Movement of the tongue and lips can create these constrictions and by forming the oral cavity in different ways, different sounds can be produced.

=====Bilabial=====
Bilabial sounds are produced with both lips, such as [b], [m], and [p].

=====Labiodental=====
[f] and [v] are articulated by placing the upper teeth against the lower lip.

=====Interdental=====
[θ] and [ð] are both spelled as "th" (θ as in think) (ð as in the). They are pronounced by inserting the tip of the tongue between the teeth.

=====Alveolar=====
[t] [d] [n] [s] [z] [l] [r] are produced in many ways where the tongue is raised towards the alveolar ridge.

[t, d, n] the tip of the tongue is raised and touches the ridge.

[s, z] the sides of the front of the tongue are raised, but the tip is lowered so that air escapes over it.

[l] the tip of the tongue is raised while the rest of the tongue remains down, permitting air to escape over its sides. Hence, [l] is called a lateral sound (âm biên).

[r] [IPA ɹ] curl the tip of tongue back behind the alveolar ridge, or bunch up the top of the tongue behind the ridge, the air escapes through the central part of the mouth.

=====Palatal=====
[ʃ] [ʒ] [tʃ] [dʒ] [j] are produced by raising the front part of the tongue to the palate.

=====Velar=====
[k] [ɡ] [ŋ] are produced by raising the back part of the tongue to the soft palate or the velum.

=====Uvular=====
[ʀ] [q] [ԍ] these sounds are produced by raising the back of the tongue to the uvula. The 'r' in French and German may be an uvular trill (symbolized by [ʀ]). The uvular sounds [q] and [ԍ] occur in Arabic. These do not normally occur in English.

=====Glottal=====
[h] [ʔ] the sound [h] is from the flow of air coming from an open glottis, past the tongue and lips as they prepare to pronounce a vowel sound, which always follows [h]. if the air is stopped completely at the glottis by tightly closed vocal cords the sound upon release of the cords is called a glottal stop [ʔ].

===Vowels===
Vowels are produced by the passage of air through the [[larynx]] and the [[vocal tract]]. Most vowels are [[Voice (phonetics) | voiced]] (i.e. the vocal folds are vibrating). Except in some marginal cases, the vocal tract is open, so that the airstream is able to escape without generating fricative noise.

Variation in vowel quality is produced by means of the following articulatory structures:

====The larynx====
The larynx is used to differentiate voiced and voiceless vowels.&lt;ref name="Laver"&gt;"Laver, John ''Principles of Phonetics'', 1994, Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[pitch (music) |pitch]] of the vowel is changed by altering the frequency of vibration of the [[vocal folds]]. In some languages there are contrasts among vowels with different [[phonation]] types.&lt;ref name = "SOWL"&gt; "Peter Ladefoged and Ian Maddieson ''The Sounds of the World's Languages'', 1996, Blackwell; {{ISBN|0-631-19815-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pharyngeal area====
Vowels may be made [[pharyngealization|pharyngealized]] (also ''epiglottalized'', ''sphincteric'' or ''strident'') by means of a [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|retraction of the tongue root]].&lt;ref name="SOWL"/&gt;{{RP|306-310}} Vowels may also be articulated with [[Advanced and retracted tongue root|advanced tongue root]].&lt;ref name = "Laver"/&gt;{{rp|298}} There is discussion of whether this vowel feature (ATR) is different from the Tense/Lax distinction in vowels. &lt;ref name = "SOWL"/&gt;{{rp|302-6}}
====Soft palate (velum)====
Vowels are normally produced with the [[soft palate]] raised so that no air escapes through the nose. However, vowels may be [[Nasal vowel | nasalized]] as a result of lowering the soft palate. Many languages use nasalization contrastively. &lt;ref name="SOWL"/&gt;{{rp|298-300}}
====Tongue====
The tongue is a highly flexible organ that is capable of being moved in many different ways. For vowel articulation the principal variations are [[Vowel#height | vowel height]] and the dimension of [[Vowel#backness|backness]] and [[Front vowel | frontness]].&lt;ref name = "SOWL"/&gt;. A less common variation in vowel quality can be produced by a change in the shape of the front of the tongue, resulting in a [[R-coloured vowel|rhotic]] or rhotacized vowel. &lt;ref name = "SOWL"/&gt;
====Lips====
The lips play a major role in vowel articulation. It is generally believed that two major variables are in effect: [[Roundedness | lip-rounding]] (or labialization) and [[Roundedness#types of rounding |lip protrusion]].

==Airflow==

[[File:Larynx external en.svg|thumb|350px|Larynx, anterolateral view]]
[[File:Gray960.png|thumb|250px|Larynx, superior view (bottom = anterior)]]
[[File:Gray959.png|thumb|250px|Larynx, lateral view (left = posterior)]]

For all practical purposes, [[temperature]] can be treated as [[Constant (mathematics)|constant]] in the articulatory system. Thus, [[Boyle's Law]] can usefully be written
as the following two equations.

: &lt;math&gt;P_1 V_1 = P_2 V_2 \,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;Stated in a less abbreviatory fashion: pressure&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; × volume&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = pressure&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; × volume&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\frac{V_1}{(V_1+\Delta V)}=\frac{(P_1+\Delta P)}{P_1}&lt;/math&gt; &lt;ref&gt;volume&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; divided by sum of volume&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and change in volume = sum of pressure&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and the change in pressure divided by pressure&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

What the above equations express is that given an initial [[pressure]] ''P''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and [[volume]] ''V''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; at time 1 the [[product (mathematics)|product]] of these two values will be equal to the product of the pressure ''P''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and volume ''V''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; at a later time 2. This means that if there is an increase in the volume of cavity, there will be a corresponding decrease in pressure of that same cavity, and vice versa. In other words, volume and pressure are [[inversely proportional]] (or negatively correlated) to each other. As applied to a description of the subglottal cavity, when the lung pistons contract the lungs, the volume of the subglottal cavity decreases while the subglottal air pressure increases. Conversely, if the lungs are expanded, the pressure decreases.

A situation can be considered where (1) the vocal fold valve is closed separating the supraglottal cavity from the subglottal cavity, (2) the mouth is open and, therefore, supraglottal air pressure is equal to atmospheric pressure, and (3) the lungs are [[Muscle contraction|contracted]] resulting in a subglottal pressure that has increased to a pressure that is greater than atmospheric pressure. If the vocal fold valve is subsequently opened, the previously two separate cavities become one unified cavity although the cavities will still be aerodynamically isolated because the glottic valve between them is relatively small and constrictive. [[Pascal's Law]] states that the pressure within a system must be equal throughout the system. When the subglottal pressure is greater than supraglottal pressure, there is a pressure inequality in the unified cavity. Since pressure is a [[force]] applied to a [[surface area]] by definition and a force is the product of [[mass]] and [[acceleration]] according to [[Newton's Second Law of Motion]], the pressure inequality will be resolved by having part of the mass in air [[molecule]]s found in the subglottal cavity move to the supraglottal cavity. This movement of mass is airflow. The airflow will continue until a pressure equilibrium is reached. Similarly, in an [[ejective consonant]] with a [[glottalic]] [[airstream mechanism]], the lips or the tongue (i.e., the buccal or lingual valve) are initially closed and the closed glottis (the laryngeal piston) is raised decreasing the oral cavity volume behind the valve closure and increasing the pressure compared to the volume and pressure at a resting state. When the closed valve is opened, airflow will result from the cavity behind the initial closure outward until intraoral pressure is equal to [[atmospheric pressure]]. That is, air will flow from a cavity of higher pressure to a cavity of lower pressure until the equilibrium point; the pressure as [[potential energy]] is, thus, converted into airflow as [[kinetic energy]].

==Sound sources==

Sound sources refer to the conversion of aerodynamic energy into acoustic energy. There are two main types of sound sources in the articulatory system: periodic (or more precisely semi-periodic) and aperiodic. A periodic sound source is vocal fold vibration produced at the glottis found in vowels and voiced consonants. A less common periodic sound source is the vibration of an oral articulator like the tongue found in alveolar trills. Aperiodic sound sources are the turbulent noise of fricative consonants and the short-noise burst of plosive releases produced in the oral cavity.

===Periodic sources===

* Non-vocal fold vibration: 20–40 [[hertz]] (cycles per second)
* Vocal fold vibration
** Lower limit: 70–80 Hz modal (bass), 30–40 Hz creaky
** Upper limit: 1170 Hz (soprano)

====Vocal fold vibration====

* [[larynx]]:
** [[cricoid cartilage]]
** [[thyroid cartilage]]
** [[arytenoid cartilage]]
** [[Arytenoid muscle|interarytenoid muscles]] (fold adduction)
** [[posterior cricoarytenoid muscle]] (fold abduction)
** [[lateral cricoarytenoid muscle]] (fold shortening/stiffening)
** [[thyroarytenoid muscle]] (medial compression/fold stiffening, internal to folds)
** [[cricothyroid muscle]] (fold lengthening)
** [[hyoid bone]]
** [[sternothyroid muscle]] (lowers thyroid)
** [[sternohyoid muscle]] (lowers hyoid)
** [[stylohyoid muscle]] (raises hyoid)

===Palatography===

In order to understand how sounds are made, experimental procedures are often adopted. [[Palatography]] is one of the oldest instrumental phonetic techniques used to record data regarding articulators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ladefoged |first=Peter |title=A Course In Phonetics |edition=3rd |page=60 |publisher=Harcourt Brace College Publishers |date=1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In traditional, static palatography, a speaker's palate is coated with a dark powder.  The speaker then produces a word, usually with a single consonant.  The tongue wipes away some of the powder at the place of articulation.  The experimenter can then use a mirror to photograph the entire upper surface of the speaker's mouth.  This photograph, in which the place of articulation can be seen as the area where the powder has been removed, is called a palatogram.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.linguistics.ucla.edu/faciliti/facilities/physiology/palatography.html Palatography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology has since made possible [[electropalatography]] (or EPG).  In order to collect EPG data, the speaker is fitted with a special prosthetic palate, which contains a number of electrodes.  The way in which the electrodes are "contacted" by the tongue during speech provides phoneticians with important information, such as how much of the palate is contacted in different speech sounds, or which regions of the palate are contacted, or what the duration of the contact is.

'''Battir''' ({{lang-ar|&lt;big&gt;بتير&lt;/big&gt;}}) is a [[State of Palestine|Palestinian]] village in the [[West Bank]], 6.4&amp;nbsp;km west of [[Bethlehem]], and southwest of [[Jerusalem]]. It was inhabited during the [[Byzantine empire|Byzantine]] and Islamic periods, and in the Ottoman and British Mandate censuses its population was recorded as primarily Muslim. In former times, the city lay along the route from Jerusalem to [[Bayt Jibrin]]. Battir is situated just above the modern route of the [[Jaffa–Jerusalem railway]], which served as the [[1949 Armistice Agreements|armistice line]] between [[Israel]] and [[Jordan]] from 1949 until the [[Six-Day War]], when it was occupied by [[Israel]]. In 2007, Battir had a population of about 4,000.

In 2014, Battir was inscribed in the [[List of World Heritage Sites in Western Asia|UNESCO World Heritage Site]], as ''Land of Olives and Vines — Cultural Landscape of Southern Jerusalem, Battir''.

==History==
===Antiquity===
{{Main|Betar (fortress)}}
[[Betar (fortress)|Ancient Betar]], whose name Battir preserves, was a second-century [[Jewish]] village and fortress, the site of the final battle of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]]. The modern Palestinian village is built north east the ancient site ''Khirbet el-Yahud'' (Arabic, meaning "ruin of the Jews" ) and "is unanimously identified with Betar, the last stronghold of the Second Revolt against the Romans, where its leader, [[Simon bar Kokhba|Bar-Kokhba]], found his death in 135 CE."&lt;ref&gt;David Ussishkin, "[http://www.tau.ac.il/humanities/archaeology/projects/proj_past_betar.html Soundings in Betar, Bar-Kochba's Last Stronghold]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="D. Ussishkin 1993, pp. 66-97"&gt;D. Ussishkin, Archaeological Soundings at Betar, Bar-Kochba's Last Stronghold, Tel Aviv 20, 1993, pp. 66-97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;K. Singer, Pottery of the Early Roman Period from Betar, Tel Aviv 20, 1993, pp. 98-103.&lt;/ref&gt; "A modern agricultural terrace follows the line of the ancient fortification wall".&lt;ref name="D. Ussishkin 1993, pp. 66-97"/&gt; There is a tradition that the village is also the site of the tomb of the [[Tannaic]] sage [[Eleazar of Modi'im]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2933&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=346 אוצר מסעות - יהודה דוד אייזענשטיין] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121002045002/http://www.hebrewbooks.org/pdfpager.aspx?req=2933&amp;st=&amp;pgnum=346 |date=October 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[mosaic]] from the late [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] or early Muslim period was found in Battir.&lt;ref name="Dauphin"&gt;Dauphin, 1998, p. 911&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ottoman era===
In 1596, Battir appeared in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] [[Defter|tax registers]] as a village in the ''[[Nahiya]]'' of Quds in the ''[[Liwa (Arabic)|Liwa]]'' of [[Jerusalem|Quds]]. It had a population of 24 households and two bachelors, all [[Muslim]]s, and paid taxes on wheat, summer crops or fruit trees, and goats or beehives; a total of 4,800 [[Akçe]]. All of the revenue went to a [[Waqf]].&lt;ref&gt;Hütteroth and Abdulfattah, 1977, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1838 it was noted as ''Bittir'', a Muslim village in the ''Beni Hasan'' district, west of Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 3, 2nd appendix, p. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearch03robiuoft#page/123/mode/1up 123]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Robinson and Smith, 1841, vol 2, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/biblicalresearc00smitgoog#page/n346/mode/1up 324]-325&lt;/ref&gt;

French explorer [[Victor Guérin]] visited the place in 1860s,&lt;ref&gt;Guérin, 1869, p. [https://archive.org/stream/descriptiongogr03gugoog#page/n398/mode/1up 387] ff&lt;/ref&gt; while an Ottoman village list from about 1870 showed that Battir had a population of 239, in a total of 62 houses, though that population count included men, only. It was further noted that it had "a beautiful spring flowing through the courtyard of the [[mosque]]".&lt;ref&gt;Socin, 1879, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde01deut#page/148/mode/1up 148] It was also noted as located in the ''Beni Hasan'' district&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hartmann, 1883, p. [https://archive.org/stream/bub_gb_BZobAQAAIAAJ#page/n930/mode/1up 122] also noted 62 houses&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' in 1883 described Battir as a moderate sized village, on the precipitous slope of a deep valley.&lt;ref name=SWP20&gt;Conder and Kitchener, 1883, SWP III, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/surveyofwesternp03conduoft#page/20/mode/1up 20]-21&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1896 the population of ''Bettir'' was estimated to be about 750 persons.&lt;ref&gt;Schick, 1896, p. [https://archive.org/stream/zeitschriftdesde19deut#page/n232/mode/1up 125]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 20th century, Battir's development was linked to its location alongside the [[Jaffa–Jerusalem railway|railroad to Jerusalem]], which provided access to the marketplace as well as income from passengers who disembarked to refresh themselves en route.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ags.ou.edu/~bwallach/documents/A%20Window%20on%20the%20West%20Bank.pdf A Window on the West Bank], by Bret Wallach&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Battir04.png|thumb|right|Village women going to market, 1913]]

===British Mandate era===
In the [[1922 census of Palestine]], conducted by the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate authorities]], Batir had an all Muslim population of 542 persons,&lt;ref&gt;Barron, 1923, Table VII, Sub-district of Jerusalem,  p. [https://archive.org/stream/PalestineCensus1922/Palestine%20Census%20%281922%29#page/n16/mode/1up   14]&lt;/ref&gt; increasing in the [[1931 census of Palestine|1931 census]] to 758; 755 Muslims, two Christians and one Jew, in 172 houses.&lt;ref name="Census1931"&gt;Mills, 1932, p. [https://archive.org/details/CensusOfPalestine1931.PopulationOfVillagesTownsAndAdministrativeAreas 37]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Village Statistics, 1945|1945 statistics]] the population of Battir was 1,050, all Muslims,&lt;ref name=1945p24&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics, 1945, p. [http://cs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/VSpages/VS1945_p24.jpg 24]&lt;/ref&gt; with a total of 8,028 [[dunam]]s of land according to an official land and population survey.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20I/Jerusalem/Page-056.jpg 56]&lt;/ref&gt; Of this, 1,805 dunams were plantations and irrigable land, 2,287 for cereals,&lt;ref&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20II/Jerusalem/Page-101.jpg 101]&lt;/ref&gt; while 73 dunams were built-up (urban) land.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Palestine, Department of Statistics. ''Village Statistics, April, 1945.'' Quoted in Hadawi, 1970, p. [http://www.palestineremembered.com/download/VillageStatistics/Table%20III/Jerusalem/Page-151.jpg 151]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Jordanian era===
In the wake of the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]], Battir came under [[Jordan]]ian rule.

During the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War|1948 war]], most of the villagers had fled, but Mustafa Hassan and a few others stayed. At night they would light candles in the houses, and in the morning they would take out the cattle. When nearing the village, the Israelis thought Battir was still inhabited and gave up attacking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.faz.net/aktuell/politik/ausland/palaestinenserdorf-battir-widerstand-durch-denkmalschutz-11794439.html| title=Palästinenserdorf Battir: Widerstand durch Denkmalschutz| date= June 21, 2012| author= Hans-Christian Rößler| work=Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung| language=German| access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Green Line (Israel)|armistice line]] was drawn near the railroad, with Battir ending up just meters to the east of [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|Jordan's border with Israel]]. At least 30% of Battir's land lies on the Israeli side of the Green Line, but the villagers were allowed to keep it in return for preventing damage to the railway,&lt;ref name=barrier/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; thus being the only Palestinians officially allowed to cross into Israel and work their lands before the [[Six-Day War]].&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.464599"/&gt;

The Jordanian census of 1961 found 1,321 inhabitants in Battir.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Jordan, Department of Statistics, 1964, p. [http://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/~bdm/yabber/census/JordanCensusPages/JordanCensus1961-p23.pdf 23]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Post-1967===
After the [[Six-Day War]] in 1967, Battir came under [[Israeli-occupied territories|Israeli occupation]]. The population in the 1967 census was 1445.&lt;ref name=67census&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.levyinstitute.org/pubs/1967_census/vol_1_tab_2.pdf |title=The 1967 Census of the West Bank and Gaza Strip: A Digitized Version |author=Perlmann, Joel |date=November 2011 – February 2012 |website=[[Levy Economics Institute]] |publisher= |access-date=24 June 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the signing of the [[Oslo II Accord|1995 accords]], it has been administered by the [[Palestinian National Authority]] (PNA). Battir is governed by a village council currently administrated by nine members appointed by the PNA. 23.7% of Battir land is defined as [[Area B]], while the remaining 76.3% was defined as [[Area C (West Bank)|Area C]] in the same accords.&lt;ref name="ARIJ"/&gt;

In 2007, Battir had a population of 3,967,&lt;ref name="PCBS"/&gt; in 2012 the population was estimated at about 4,500.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url= http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=561121| title=Palestine readying to propose Battir for UNESCO protection| publisher=Ma'an News Agency|date=February 1, 2013 | access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Battir is located 6.4&amp;nbsp;km (horizontal distance) north-west of Bethlehem on a hill above Wadi el-Jundi (lit. "Valley of the Soldier"), which runs southwest through the Judean hills to the coastal plain. The [[Palestine Exploration Fund]]'s ''Survey of Western Palestine'' in 1883 described the city's natural defenses, saying its houses stand upon rock terraces, having a rocky scarp below; thus from the north the place is very strong, whilst on the south a narrow neck between two ravine heads connects the hill with the main ridge.&lt;ref name=SWP20/&gt; At an altitude of around 760 m above sea level,&lt;ref name="ARIJ"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.ochaopt.org/documents/opt_arij_villageprofile_Battir.pdf| title= Battir Village Profile| publisher=The Applied Research Institute – Jerusalem| date=2010| access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Battir's summers are temperate, and its winters mild with occasional snowfall. The average annual temperature is 16&lt;sup&gt;o&lt;/sup&gt; C.

===Ancient irrigation system and terraces===
Battir has a unique irrigation system that utilizes man-made terraces and a system of manually diverting water via sluice gates.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-18012895 West Bank barrier threatens villagers' way of life]. ''[[BBC News]]''. 2012-05-09.&lt;/ref&gt; The Roman-era network is still in use, fed by seven springs which have provided fresh water for 2,000 years.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/26/world/middleeast/palestinian-village-tries-to-protect-landmark.html?pagewanted=all A Palestinian Village Tries to Protect a Terraced Ancient Wonder of Agriculture]. ''[[The New York Times]]''. 2012-06-25.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=545813 Threatened village proposed as next UNESCO world heritage site]. ''[[Ma'an News Agency]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The irrigation system runs through a steep valley near the Green Line where a section of the Ottoman-era [[Hejaz Railway]] was laid. Battir's eight main clans take turns each day to water the village's crops. Hence a local saying that in Battir "a week lasts eight days, not seven."&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; According to anthropologist Giovanni Sontana of [[UNESCO]], "There are few, if any, places left in the immediate region where such a traditional method of agriculture remains, not only intact, but as a functioning part of the village."&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

[[File:Bitar1893.jpg|thumb|right|Battir's ancient terraces, 1893]]

In 2007, the village of Battir sued the [[Israeli Defense Ministry]] to try to force them to change the planned route of the [[Israeli West Bank barrier]] which would cut through part of Battir's 2,000-year-old irrigation system, which is still in use.&lt;ref name=barrier/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; The [[Israel Nature and Parks Authority]] (INPA), which approved the fence’s original route in 2005, changed its mind and wrote in a 13-page policy paper that Battir’s terraces were also an Israeli heritage site and should be carefully safeguarded,&lt;ref name="Tablet"/&gt; stating that agricultural terraces around Battir attesting to millennia-old methods of farming in the region will be irreversibly harmed by the fence, no matter how narrow its route. It was the first time an Israeli government agency expressed opposition to the construction of a segment of the fence.&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.464599"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/for-first-time-israeli-state-agency-opposes-segment-of-west-bank-separation-fence-1.464599| title=For first time, Israeli state agency opposes segment of West Bank separation fence| author= Zafrir Rinat | work=Haaretz| date= September 13, 2012| access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This affidavit was one of four expert opinions that contended the fence would decimate the unique farming system, and in early May 2013, the Israeli High Court of Justice ruled that the Defense Ministry must explain “why should the route of the separation barrier in the Battir village area not be nullified or changed, and alternately why should the barrier not be reconfigured.” The Defense Ministry has to submit a new plan for securing the border that will not destroy Battir by July 2, 2013.&lt;ref name="Tablet"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.tabletmag.com/jewish-news-and-politics/133899/land-for-peace-battir?all=1| title=Land for Peace in the Battle Over Millennia-Old Palestinian Farming Terraces| author=Daniella Cheslow| work=Tablet Magazine| date=June 10, 2013| access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A separate petition against the separation barrier has also been filed by the nearby Jewish city [[Beitar Illit]], fearing that it would prevent them from expanding the settlement.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web| url=http://www.english.rfi.fr/middle-east/20130312-historic-palestinian-agricultural-village-fights-separation-wall| date=March 12, 2013 | title=Historic Palestinian village fights Israel's separation wall | author=Ruth Michaelson | work=Radio France Internationale| access-date=June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 [[UNESCO]] awarded Battir a $15,000 prize for "Safeguarding and Management of Cultural Landscapes" due to its care for its ancient terraces and irrigation system.&lt;ref name=barrier&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:PPGB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13EC90164E2955F0&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=West Bank Barrier Threatens Farms|publisher=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=May 14, 2012|author=Daniella Cheslow|access-date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, the Palestinian National Authority sent a delegation to UNESCO headquarters in [[Paris]] to discuss the possibility of adding Battir to its [[World Heritage List]]. The PNA's deputy minister of tourism, Hamadan Taha, said that the organization wants to "maintain it as a Palestinian and humanitarian heritage," making special note of its historic terraces and irrigation systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:WXNA&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=13F1D3FBE4FEBFB8&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0D663DC0A81A15EA|title=PNA intensifies efforts to add more sites to World Heritage list|publisher=Xinhua News Agency|date=May 30, 2012|access-date=August 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; the nomination of Battir was blocked at the last minute because the formal submission was too late.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In a document concerning the damage the separation barrier would do to the area, the Israel Nature and Parks Authority (INPA) noted "The struggle of our neighbors to name the area a World Heritage Site places us in an embarrassing position, and we should work together with them to protect the landscape."&lt;ref name="Haaretz1.464599"/&gt;

In January 2015, according to the village mayor Akram Badir, the Israeli Supreme Court rejected the [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] request to build the separation barrier through the village &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maannews.net/eng/ViewDetails.aspx?ID=751709 'Israeli Supreme Court rules against separation wall in Battir,'] [[Ma'an News Agency]] 4 January 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Archaeology==
[[File:Roman_Inscription_found_near_Bettir_in_19th_century.jpg|thumb|right|Roman Inscription found near Battir mentioning the 5th and 11th Roman Legions]]An old Roman bath fed by a spring is located in the middle of the village.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt; Archaeologist [[David Ussishkin|D. Ussishkin]] dates the village to the Iron Age, and states that at the time of the Revolt it was a village of between one and two thousand people chosen by Bar Kochba for its spring, defensible hilltop location, and proximity to the main Jerusalem-Gaza road.&lt;ref name="D. Ussishkin 1993, pp. 66-97"/&gt; A Roman inscription was also discovered near one of the city's natural springs on which are inscribed the names of the [[Legio V Macedonica|Fifth Macedonian Legion]] and the [[Legio XI Claudia|Eleventh Claudian Legion]], which said legions presumably took part in the siege of the city during [[Hadrian|Emperor Hadrian]]'s reign.&lt;ref&gt;Clermont-Ganneau, 1899, pp. [https://archive.org/stream/archaeologicalre01cler#page/463/mode/1up 463]-470.&lt;/ref&gt;

There isn't any evidence of habitation in the period immediately after the Revolt.&lt;ref name="D. Ussishkin 1993, pp. 66-97"/&gt;

'''''Botticelli Inferno''''' is a 2016 Italian-German [[documentary film]] directed by Ralph Loop. The film is part of the project ''Great Art Cinema'' and analyses one of the most mysterious works of [[Sandro Botticelli]], the ''Map of Hell'' in the ''[[Divine Comedy Illustrated by Botticelli]]'' in the [[Vatican Library]].&lt;ref name="arte.sky.it"/&gt;&lt;ref name="artemagazine"&gt;{{cite web|title=Grande Arte al Cinema "Botticelli. Inferno", il 7,8,9 novembre 2016|url=http://www.artemagazine.it/appuntamenti/item/2416-grande-arte-al-cinema-botticelli-inferno-il-7-8-9-novembre-2016|website=artemagazine.it}}&lt;/ref&gt; The map was originally part of an [[Divine Comedy illustrated by Botticelli|illustrated manuscript]] of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Divine Comedy]]'', featuring artwork by Botticcelli.

The film was edited in the facilities of [[TV Plus]], Medea Film, and Nexo Digital.&lt;ref name="artemagazine"/&gt; It attempts to shed light on Botticelli's motivation for drawing his ''Map of Hell'', and, in the process, to reveal the dark, and less well known, side of the Renaissance master who is famous for painting ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]''.

== Plot ==

Botticelli had created 102 drawings based on the writings of [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' depicting Dante's vision of Hell.&lt;ref name="artemagazine"/&gt; One of those drawings, the ''Map of Hell'', shows the suffering of the condemned souls at the various levels of Hell, is analysed by art experts and their conclusions are presented in the film.&lt;ref name="artemagazine"/&gt; 

When the director of the film, Ralph Loop, saw Botticelli's exhibitions in Berlin and London in 2015, he became so fascinated with the ''Map of Hell'' that he decided to make a film about it.&lt;ref name="Zeit Online"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Wenke Husmann|title="Inferno": Ein infernalischer Herbst|url=http://www.zeit.de/kultur/film/2016-10/film-inferno-dante-botticelli-dan-brown/seite-2|publisher=Zeit Online|date=13 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Ron Howard]]'s ''[[Inferno (2016 film)|Inferno]]'', the ''Map of Hell'' is shown briefly as a projection on a wall, while Ralph Loop's film is dedicated to examining the map and its history in detail.&lt;ref name="Zeit Online"/&gt; 

The film attempts to shed light on what motivated Botticelli to draw the ''Map of Hell'', and, in doing so, to reveal the dark, and less well known, side of the [[Renaissance]] master who is famous for painting ''[[The Birth of Venus]]'' and ''[[Primavera (painting)|Primavera]]''.&lt;ref name="artemagazine"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trovacinema"&gt;{{cite web|title=Botticelli. Inferno|url=http://trovacinema.repubblica.it/film/botticelli-inferno/490100/|publisher=trovacinema.repubblica.it}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The drawing is about 30 by 40 centimetres and in the film it is examined by a glove-wearing German art historian inside the [[air-conditioned]] vaults of the [[Apostolic Palace|Vatican]]. A letter from Friedrich Lippmann, director of [[Kupferstichkabinett Berlin]], who in 1882 brought 85 of Botticelli's 102 drawings to the museum, is also shown in the film. A high-performance [[Image scanner|digital scanner]] is used in the film to reveal details in the map which could not be discerned by the human eye.&lt;ref name="arte.sky.it"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Zeit Online"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nexo"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nexo Digital presenta Botticelli Inferno|url=http://www.nexodigital.it/botticelli-inferno/|publisher=Nexo Digital}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Locales ==
The film was shot on location in the Vatican, the [[Uffizi Gallery]] in [[Florence]], the [[Vatican Library]], London, Berlin and Scotland.&lt;ref name="cinemamontreal.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Botticelli Inferno|url=https://www.cinemamontreal.com/movies/botticelli-inferno-2016|website=cinemamontreal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
[[File:Sandro Botticelli - La Carte de l'Enfer.jpg|thumb|380px|The ''Map of Hell'' painting by Botticelli is the subject of the film.]]
''[[Die Zeit]]'' comments that the film is worth seeing "as a background for the blockbuster [Ron Howard's film] – or instead." and further comments that Ron Howard's film only briefly shows a projection of the map, while in Ralph Loop's film the viewer can "marvel at the miracle in detail". The reviewer further asks "A whole film about a darkly colored drawing of just 30 by 40 centimeters, centuries old – is not that terribly dry?" concluding that "In fact, the small film is not meant to provide new insights to art scientists. But it entertains us non-experts in the best possible [way] with the little material that can be filmed in this subject so we see shots of Florence and Rome...". ''Die Zeit'' finally concludes, "Anyone who can free himself from such perfectly overworked vision of hell, recognizes Botticelli's painting [for] what it still is: infernal[ly] good."&lt;ref name="Zeit Online"/&gt;

''Spielfilm.de'' comments that the film will be interesting to "[a]lmost anyone who has a passion for exciting thriller costumes or unsolved secrets (the history of art and culture)". The critic further comments "[o]n the one hand, [Loop] provides a comprehensive insight into the time of Botticelli – at all times, friendly, and comprehensible. And also for cinema-goers, to whom Botticelli and his art so far were largely foreign." Concerning the technology employed to scan the map details, the reviewer remarks that "[f]or the documentary "Botticelli Inferno", the [map] was illuminated with a high-performance scanner. This makes shading, coloring, details and hidden messages visible in an unprecedented way. Things that hitherto remained hidden from the eye." The review also mentions that the film employs a [[Grammatical person|first-person]] narration technique, when referring to Botticelli, that makes the viewer feel close to the artist. The critic goes on to conclude that the film is: "a masterly, artfully documented work of art, [about] one of the most mysterious works of art in history."&lt;ref name="spielfilm.de"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kritik: Botticelli Inferno (2016)|url=http://www.spielfilm.de/filme/3003431/botticelli-inferno/kritik|website=spielfilm.de}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[AlloCiné]]'' comments that "''Botticelli – Inferno'' transports viewers into another world: a journey to the underworld through the nine levels of hell, as described by Dante. "Only by traveling through hell and purgatory we can reach paradise and emerge to see the stars again"
Do not miss this unique event, specially created for cinema."&lt;ref name="allocine.fr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Botticelli Inferno|url=http://www.allocine.fr/film/fichefilm_gen_cfilm=250096.html|website=allocine.fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Release ==
The film was released in Italy in November 2016.&lt;ref name="artemagazine"/&gt;

'''Bride service''' has traditionally been portrayed in the [[Anthropology|anthropological]] literature as the service rendered by the [[bridegroom]] to a bride's family as a [[bride price]] or part of one (see [[dowry]]). Bride service and [[bride wealth]] models frame anthropological discussions of [[kinship]] in many regions of the world.&lt;ref&gt;

==Patterns==
Patterns of [[matrilocal]] post-marital residence, as well as the practice of temporary or prolonged bride service, have been widely reported for [[indigenous peoples]] of the [[Amazon basin]].&lt;ref&gt;

The length of uxorilocal residence and the duration of bride service are contingent upon negotiations between the concerned parties, the outcome of which has been characterized as an enduring commitment or permanent [[debt]].&lt;ref name=Rosengren&gt;{{cite book |title=In the eyes of the beholder: Leadership and the social construction of power and dominance among the Matsigenka of the Peruvian Amazon |date=1987 |page=127 |last=Rosengren |first=Dan |publisher=Göteborgs etnografiska museum |location=Göteborg}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gow&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gow |first=Peter |date=December 1989 |title=The perverse child: Desire in a native Amazonian subsistence economy |journal=Man |volume=24 |number=4 |pages=299–314}} &lt;/ref&gt; The [[Power (sociology)|power]] wielded by those who “give” wives over those who “take” them is also said to be a significant part of the political relationships in societies where bride service obligations are prevalent.&lt;ref name="Rivière 1997"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Rivière |first=Peter G |date=1977 |title=Some problems in the comparative study of Carib societies |encyclopedia=Carib-speaking Indians: culture, society, and language |editor-last=Basso |editor-first=Ellen B. |location=Tucson |publisher=University of Arizona Press |page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mentore |first=George P. |date=September 1987 |title=Waiwai women: the basis of wealth and power |journal=Man |volume=22 |number=3 |pages=511–27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rather than seeing affinity in terms of a "compensation" model whereby individuals are exchanged as [[Object (philosophy)|object]]s, Dean’s (1995) research on Amazon bride service among the [[Urarina]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dean |first=Bartholomew |url=http://www.upf.com/book.asp?id=DEANXS07 |title=Urarina Society, Cosmology, and History in Peruvian Amazonia |location=Gainesville |publisher=University Press of Florida |date=2009 |isbn=978-0-8130-3378-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; demonstrates how differentially situated subjects negotiate the politics of [[marriage]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Dean |first=Bartholomew |title=Forbidden fruit: infidelity, affinity and bride service among the Urarina of Peruvian Amazonia |journal=Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute |volume=1 |number=1 |date=March 1995 |pages=87–110 |url=https://www.academia.edu/24961221}}&lt;/ref&gt;
==Example==
An example of bride service occurs in the [[Hebrew Bible]], {{bibleverse||Genesis|29:16-29|NIV}}, when [[Jacob]] labored for [[Laban (Bible)|Laban]] for fourteen years to marry [[Rachel]]. Originally the deal was seven years, but Laban tricked Jacob by giving him [[Leah]] on their wedding day, so Jacob had to work another seven years to obtain the girl he had originally fallen in love with, Rachel.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2950">The '''Center for Advanced Study in Theoretical Linguistics''' (CASTL) was established in 2002 as a [[Center of Excellence]] by the [[Norwegian Research Council]]. It is located in [[Tromsø]], Norway, and is housed at the [[University of Tromsø]]. CASTL was founded by a core group of internationally respected linguists in Tromsø, and the funding made available by the Norwegian Research Council has since enabled the Center to more than double its staff size.

==Objectives==
The center's objective is to explore the limits and nature of linguistic variation, focusing mainly on syntax and phonology but also branching into morphology and semantics. All natural languages are of relevance to this study. The center has been exploring a methodology which can be referred to as "Selective Global Comparison," an approach in which a relatively small number of unrelated languages are examined in depth in order to determine the nature of the variation which distinguishes them. This methodology is distinct from usual work in [[linguistic typology]], which tends to compare many languages at a relatively superficial level of description, and from microcomparative studies, which tend to compare closely related languages at a level of great detail.

==Organizational structure==
At any given time there are about twenty to twenty-five doctorate holding linguists working on CASTL-related projects in Tromsø. There are also twelve to fifteen PhD students and some number of Master's students. In addition, CASTL is the center of a broad international network of current linguistic research, for example as the administrative host of the NORMS project (a Nordic Center of Excellence in Microcomparative Scandinavian Syntax) and the EGG school and other international ventures. It is therefore one of the largest centers dedicated to theoretical linguistic research in the world.

==Recent Research==
Recent research at CASTL has focused on (among other things) the nature of grammatical linguistic categories and their relationship to functional structure, the structure of inventories of phonological segments, and the nature of verb movement.

'''[[Children]] and [[adolescent]]s in the [[United States]]''' can be regarded as one [[age group]] in the [[demographics of the United States]].

In 2010 it was estimated that 20.2% of the [[population of the United States]] were 0–14 years old (30,305,704 females and 31,639,127 males).&lt;ref&gt;[[CIA World Factbook]]: {{cite web |url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/us.html |title=CIA - The World Factbook -- United States |accessdate=2010-02-16 |publisher=CIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concerns from parents==
According to a survey of parents in 2011, the issues of greatest concern for children are as follows, with percentages of adults who rate each item as a "big problem":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.med.umich.edu/mott/npch/pdf/081511toptenreport.pdf]{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} 5th annual survey by C.S. Mott Children’s Hospital, the University of Michigan Department of Pediatrics and Communicable Diseases, and the University of Michigan Child Health Evaluation and Research (CHEAR) Unit.&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Childhood obesity in the United States|Childhood obesity]]: 33%
#[[Drug abuse]]: 33%
#[[Youth_smoking|Tobacco smoking]]: 25%
#[[Teenage pregnancy in the United States|Teen pregnancy]]: 24%
#[[Bullying]]: 24%
#[[Internet safety]]: 23%
#[[Stress (biology)|Stress]]: 22%
#[[Alcohol abuse]]: 20%
#[[Driving accident]]s: 20%
#[[Sexting]]: 20%

==Sexuality==
{{Main|Adolescent sexuality in the United States}}
Adolescent sexuality in the United States relates to the [[human sexuality|sexuality]] of American adolescents and its place in American society, both in terms of their feelings, [[Adolescent sexual behavior|behaviors]] and development and in terms of the response of the [[Federal government of the United States|government]], educators and interested groups.

==Youth rights==
{{see|History of youth rights in the United States}}
The [[National Youth Rights Association]] is the primary youth rights organization in the United States, with local chapters across the country and constant media exposure. The organization known as [[Americans for a Society Free from Age Restrictions]] is also an important organization. [[The Freechild Project]] has gained a reputation for interjecting youth rights issues into organizations historically focused on [[youth development]] and [[youth service]] through their consulting and training activities. The [[Global Youth Action Network]] engages young people around the world in advocating for youth rights, and [[Peacefire]] provides [[technology]]-specific support for youth rights activists.

[[Choose Responsibility]] and their successor organization, the [[Amethyst Initiative]], founded by Dr. [[John McCardell, Jr.]], exist to promote the discussion of the drinking age, specifically. Choose Responsibility focuses on promoting a legal drinking age of 18, but includes provisions such as education and licensing. The Amethyst Initiative, a collaboration of college presidents and other educators, focuses on discussion and examination of the drinking age, with specific attention paid to the culture of alcohol as it exists on college campuses and the negative impact of the drinking age on alcohol education and responsible drinking.

'''Commonly misspelled English words'''&lt;ref name=AskO/&gt; ([[British English|UK]]: '''misspelt words''') are words that are often unintentionally [[misspelling|misspelled]] in general writing.
A selected list of common words is presented below, under ''[[#Documented list of common misspellings|Documented list of common misspellings]]''.
&lt;!-- ---------------------------------------------------------
  -- NOTE: This is a Wiki "article" about COMMONLY misspelled

Although the word "common" is subjective depending on the situation, the focus is on general writing, rather than in a specific field. Official spellings also vary by country or region, with some rejecting the [[American and British English spelling differences|American or British variants]] as incorrect for the region.&lt;ref name="AskO"&gt;{{Cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Within a particular field of study, such as [[computer graphics]], other words might be more common for misspelling, such as "[[pixel]]" misspelled as "pixle" (or variants "[[cesium]]" and "caesium"). Sometimes words are purposely misspelled, as a form in [[slang]], [[abbreviation]]s, or in song [[lyrics]], etc.

In general writing, some words are frequently misspelled, such as the incorrect spelling "concensus"&lt;ref name=YD/&gt; for "consensus"&lt;ref name="MWconc"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
found in numerous webpages on the Internet.&lt;ref name=YD/&gt; Other common misspellings include "equiptment" (for "equipment"),&lt;ref name=YD/&gt;&lt;ref name="MWequip"&gt;
  "Merriam-Webster Online" (results for misspelling as "equiptment"),

== Unlimited misspellings ==
Because many words can be extended with prefixes (such as "un-" or "anti-" or "re-") or suffixes (such as "-ly" or "-ing" or "-ness"), a comprehensive list of words prone to misspelling would contain thousands of variations from combining prefixes or suffixes (or both) added to the root words. To limit the scope to common words, the top 350 words are considered (according to various sources).

== Documented list of common misspellings ==
The following list, of about 350 words, is based on documented lists&lt;ref name=YD/&gt;&lt;ref name=ACpA/&gt; of the top 100, 200, or 400&lt;ref name=LM/&gt; most commonly misspelled words in all variants of the English language, rather than listing every conceivable misspelled word. Each word is followed by examples of misspellings:

=== A–B ===

== Common causes of misspellings ==
=== Mispronunciation ===
[[Mispronunciation]] is known to be one of the most common causes of misspelling.&lt;ref name="HP"&gt;
  "How to Prepare for the Canadian GED High School Equivalency
  Exam", Murray Rockowitz, Dale Shuttleworth, et al.,
  2002, {{ISBN|0-7641-1789-0}}, p. 177, Google Books webpage:
  [https://books.google.com/books?id=-rYF_vl1L6kC&amp;pg=&lt;!--
  --&gt;PA177&amp;lpg=PA177&amp;dq=%22common+causes+of+misspelling%22&amp;&lt;!--
  --&gt;source=bl&amp;ots=iIHK5wv299&amp;sig=&lt;!--
  --&gt;5n4JliszvUM3EKPiRYJPy7LD9LU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;&lt;!--
  --&gt;resnum=1&amp;ct=result  GoogleB-9LU].
&lt;/ref&gt;
Hence, [[phonetic]] misspelling is common, once a word is mispronounced. For example, the word ''realize'' may be misspelled as "relize".

=== Typing errors ===
Some spelling errors are introduced because the typing of certain people is not perfect, such as
* letters are doubled, or more frequently double letters tripled, such as "betwween" and "betweeen"
* letters are singled, such as "betwen"
* keys are transposed, so "because" becomes "becuase". ''(see [[Teh]])''
Some of the errors listed may be due to mistyping rather than ignorance, for example "solider" for "soldier".

These misspellings rarely happen in handwritten text.{{Citation needed|date=January 2015}}

=== Homophones ===
Two (or more) differently spelt words with different meanings are [[homophone]]s if they are nonetheless pronounced the same; e.g., "right", "rite", "wright", and "write"; "read" (most [[Grammatical tense|tenses]] of verb) and "reed"; "read" ([[past tense|past]], [[past participle]]) and "red". This list includes only a few homophones although incorrect use of homophones is a very common error; the following words from the list are all good English words, though often incorrectly used in place of their homophones:

{{Div col|colwidth=10em}}
* advice
* affect
* artic (colloquial UK usage for "[[articulated lorry]]")
* aweful
* breath
* calender
* capital
* dose
* its
* lightening
* loose
* loosing
* planing
* principal
* rime
* solider
* stoping
* they're
* wether
* you're
{{div col end}}
[[Spell checker]]s do not detect incorrect use of homophones.

=== Personal names ===
Personal names and [[surname]]s may be pronounced like a standard English word, but with different spelling: "balance" and "John Ballance"; "war" and "Evelyn Waugh"; "marshal" and "George Marshall". Personal names do, of course, generally start with a capital letter.

=== Foreign writers ===
A misspelling in English might be made by someone used to a different spelling in another language; for example, "address" is translated "adresse" in French and German. Many Spanish words are similar or identical to English words, but with an "n" inserted, or replacing an "m", leading to errors: "inmigrant" from "inmigrante", "cementery" from "cementerio", "confortable".  The English word 'loose' reasonably looks like it should be pronounced as 'lose' to Germans, as in German the lone 's' often has the sound of an English 'z', and a lone 'o' in English very seldom has the 'oo' sound.

=== Apostrophes ===
There can be confusion over a plural possessive form. If the singular is "book's title" and the plural "books' titles", the latter can appear as "book's", or even "books's". The plural can be written with an erroneous apostrophe ("[[grocer's apostrophe]]" in Britain): "apple's and pear's". [[Elision]] can lead to misspelling: "doesn't", where the apostrophe represents the elided "o", can be misspelled "does'nt".

'''Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles''' '''(CCSCLA)''' is a non-profit 501(c)3 community-based organization whose mission is to work for social justice and economic and environmental change within the South Central community.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccscla.org/about/|title=About  – Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles|website=ccscla.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; CCSCLA works to involve community members in identifying social, economic, and environmental areas of concern to them, and give them the tools necessary to engage with institutions, such as industries or political leaders, to enact change.

The designation of 501(c)3 signifies the organization’s area of concentration. This area consists of the Santa Monica freeway to the North, the Harbor Freeway to the West, Slauson Avenue to the South and Alameda to the East. It includes the Vermont Central neighborhood and Central Avenue Corridor. Since its founding, CCSCLA has expanded its work into other low-income neighborhoods, including Watts and Compton. At the time of its founding, CCSCLA’s area of concentration had one of the highest populations of African Americans in Los Angeles.

CCSCLA felt it needed to develop a base in order to enact substantial change. Starting in 1990, they began to organize block clubs&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kleinman|first=Dan|year=2011|title=The New Neighborhood Block Club Manual|url=http://chicago47.org/wp-content/uploads/the-new-neighborhood-block-club-manual.pdf|journal=The New Neighborhood Block Club Manual|volume=|pages=4|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; throughout the Vernon-Central Area. To date, CCSCLA has been able to organize 57 block clubs. The primary issue of concern among all block clubs is the conditions of streets. Alleys in CCSCLA’s area of concern were considered to be the worst in Los Angeles in the organization's beginning stages.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== History ==

{{Empty section|date=May 2017|Founding=Founding}}The Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles was founded in 1985 by Robin Cannon and Charlotte Bullock in order to form a group to protest the construction of a waste incinerator known as the LANCER within the predominately low income, colored community. By 1987, its construction was successfully thwarted protests by the CCSCLA being large contributing factor to the decision. 

Since dismantling the LANCER, CCSCLA has broadened its mission, fighting to better the communities of South Central LA with a number of programs that still exist today. This includes campaigns fighting against environmental hazards in the community, alleyway clean ups, affordable housing projects, and youth programs. 
== Environmental Justice and CCSCLA ==
Born from the recognition that environmental hazards are unequally distributed across the United States (poor and colored communities in close proximity, and richer and white communities safely farther away) the Environmental Justice movement seeks to draw attention to and rectify these harms. This understanding, that poor and colored communities are disproportionately being exposed to environmental hazards, has been brought about by dozens of studies completed in the last thirty years.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=From the Ground Up: Environmental Racism and the Rise of the Environmental Justice Movement|last=Cole|first=Luke W.|last2=Foster|first2=Sheila R.|publisher=New York University Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=New York and London|pages=10–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice]] as a political movement is constituted of events and strategies aimed at achieving social and economic justice in regards to the environmental hazards plaguing marginalized communities.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  President Bill Clinton’s [https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12898-federal-actions-address-environmental-justice Executive Order 12898] on Environmental Justice in 1994 adopted the work of the movement and created federal government policy.  The order required federal agencies to work to identify and address “disproportionately high adverse health or environmental effects of their policies on low-income people and people of color.” and “look for ways to prevent discrimination by race, color or national origin in any federally funded programs dealing with health or the environment.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.epa.gov/laws-regulations/summary-executive-order-12898-federal-actions-address-environmental-justice|title=Summary of Executive Order 12898 - Federal Actions to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations|last=EPA,OA,OP,ORPM,RMD|first=US|website=www.epa.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nrdc.org/stories/environmental-justice-movement|title=The Environmental Justice Movement|work=NRDC|access-date=2017-03-29|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the recognition of the federal government and the adoption of the theories developed in response to the [[Environmental justice|Environmental Justice Movement]], the movement itself is largely characterized by grassroots activism.

Community based groups are fighting specifically against environmental hazards that are placed in close proximity to their communities that have negative health effects on their surrounding populations.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; CCSCLA is cited as a defining community activist group for the movement.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Agyeman, J., Bullard, R., &amp; Evans, B. (2003). Towards Just Sustainabilities: Perspectives and Possibilities . In Just Sustainabilities: Development in an Unequal World (pp. 323-332). Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;'''Winton, S. (2010). Concerned Citizens: Environmental (In)Justice in Black Los Angeles. In Black Los Angeles: American Dreams and Racial Realities (pp. 343-359). New York, NY.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  CCSCLA set an example on how to mobilize a marginalized community by forming coalitions and networking within their affected community.  In this way CCSCLA was able to organize local business owners, lawyers, and legislators into a collective force invested in fighting for environmental justice.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; CCSCLA first mobilized in response to the proposed construction of the LANCER incinerator, and were pushed to use this community based approach because of the denial of support from mainstream environmental groups (MEGs). [[Sierra Club|The Sierra Club]] and [[Environmental Defense Fund]] specifically refused to aid CCSCLA because CCSCLA was dealing with “a community health issue, not an environmental one.”&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, William. ''Uncommon Ground: Rethinking the Human Place in Nature''. New York: W.W. Norton &amp; Co, 1996. Print. (299)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Fueling this dismissal of a request for aid was the neglect of MEGs to acknowledge the theoretical understandings of the Environmental Justice Movement- that "social inequality and imbalances of power are at the heart of environmental degradation resource depletion pollution and even overpopulation."&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; CCSCLA continues to affect community change today and in doing so they continue to challenge the narrow definition of environment that is currently utilized by many MEGs. CCSCLA accomplishes this by focusing on the intersectionality of race, concentrated poverty, social isolation, and environmental health.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bullard, Robert D. ''Dumping in Dixie: Race, Class, and Environmental Quality''. Boulder: Westview Press, 1994. Print. (23)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccscla.org/environment/|title=Environment – Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles|website=ccscla.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  CCSCLA comments on what the "environment" entails for them: "CCSCLA realize that the environment consists of more than just hazardous waste, chemicals, and air quality control; our environment is also the quality of our housing stock, the conditions of our schools and the safety of our neighborhoods"&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;

== Primary Interests ==

=== Affordable Housing ===
It is CCSCLA's belief that empowering and growing the community of South Central Los Angeles both economically and socially will in turn better the environmental conditions of the area.  Their involvement in providing and protecting affordable housing started with their fight against the demolition of affordable housing for the construction of a school.  They won the case and went on to start sponsoring and constructing affordable housing developments.  CCSCLA is able to not only provide affordable housing units, but they also employ community members and local businesses during the construction and set up community programs within the developments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scced.org/sust_orgs/urbanorg.html|title=Urban Environment Organizations|website=www.scced.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccscla.org/housing-2/|title=Housing &amp; Economic Development  – Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles|website=ccscla.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Youth Development ===
CCSCLA invests in educating and benefiting the youth populations of South Central Los Angeles.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://ccscla.org/outreach-development/|title=Youth Outreach &amp; Development – Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles|website=ccscla.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training and cultivating the youth population of the community is important for its sustainability.  CCSCLA not only provides programs for youth recreation, but also education on the community issues, and programs for professional development.  The most notable programs CCSCLA has created are: People Organizing for Workplace and Environmental Rights (POWER), The Entertainment Industry Training Program (EITP), and The Antes Columbus Youth Football Club in partnership with the Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

=== Environmental Health ===
Through its dealings and defeat of the LANCER project, CCSCLA members realized that there is more to the environment than just hazardous waste, chemicals, and air quality control- "our environment is also the quality of our housing stock, the conditions of our schools and the safety of our neighborhoods. All of these factors effect how we are able to happily co-exist in the same community."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

CCSCLA continues to work on environmental issues such as recycling, the cleaning of alleyways and streets, childhood lead poisoning prevention, storm drain protection, used motor oil recycling, teen worker rights, among others affecting community members' quality of life.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

CCSCLA states that they will conduct further environmental awareness workshops within communities as the need and topics for them present themselves.

=== Public Health ===
The environmental justice issues which CCSCLA is involved in raise several concerns along the lines of public health. Because of the close proximity of developments such as incinerators, plants, and/or factories to places in which people live in south central LA, residents are at increased risk of developing health problems relating to prolonged exposure to pollution and toxins.

Part of CCSCLA's work within the community is to raise awareness and promote community engagement of environmental justice issues—this involves not only environmental upkeep and well being, but the health of residents in these communities as well. CCSCLA hopes that in spreading awareness, [[health literacy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://health.gov/communication/literacy/quickguide/factsbasic.htm|title=Health Literacy - Fact Sheet: Health Literacy Basics|website=health.gov|access-date=2017-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; will increase within communities involved.

=== Industry Development ===

== Projects/Campaigns ==

=== LANCER ===
In the summer of 1985, Robin Cannon and Charlotte Bullock established CCSCLA is response to the proposed construction of the Los Angeles City Energy Recovery (LANCER) municipal waste incinerator. The waste facility would burn million of tons of waste during its operation causing concern for citizens of the pollutants that would be emitted. Cannon and Bullock were concerned South Central Los Angeles was chosen for the incinerator’s location because of the community's high unemployment rate, low average income, and high population of people of color.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Unequal Protection: Environmental Justice &amp; Communities of Color|last=Hamiliton|first=Cynthia|publisher=Sierra Club|year=1994|isbn=0-87156-380-0|location=San Francisco|pages=207-210}}&lt;/ref&gt; The LANCER was to be built in a vacant lot, near Jefferson High School and a public recreation center in a residential area of 16,000 people. LANCER was estimated to cost $170 million to construct. According to The Los Angeles Times, facility would employ highly trained and specialized personnel that would mostly live outside of the community so its construct would not provide jobs for those living near LANCER. In June 1987, Los Angeles mayor Tom Bradley announced that the LANCER project would not be completed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Black Los Angeles: American Dreams and Racial Realities|last=Winton|first=Sonya|publisher=NYU Press|year=2010|isbn=9780814737347|location=New York CIty|pages=343-353}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== CCSCLA v. LA Unified School District ===
Fabiola Tostado, Maria Perez, and Nevada Dove, three teenage students living in south central Los Angeles, stood up to protest the development and opening of Jefferson New Middle School, a new school planned to be built in their community. The school was projected to open in 1997—the students were able to hold off its opening until 1998, and also shed light on many problems existing with the school’s location.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

According to the research the teens did, the building site of the school was located on toxic land and was to be placed across from a former plant which was put on the Superfund cleanup list. Melanie Dove, mother of one of the teens Nevada Dove, was an organizer of Concerned Citizens of South-Central LA at the time, contributing to CCSCLA’s involvement in the situation. The teens’ actions raised public awareness of the build on toxic land, and brought to light discrepancies in the building company’s plans. As a result, a new law was put into place which became effective January 1, 2000, stating: “henceforth, all school sites will be fully evaluated and made safe before school construction ever begins”.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; The Concerned Citizens helped shed light on over 12 other school sites around Los Angeles suffering from similar problems of officials’ oversight in constructing in polluted zones. Their efforts garnered the attention of their senator at the time, Tom Hayden (D- Los Angeles), who involved himself with the problem of building schools on contaminated grounds on a federal level.

The issue of building on polluted land is far from solved- the teenagers explained that students ended up attending the community middle school even after concerns were voiced, and experienced symptoms of the pollution negatively affecting their health. In this instance, they were not able to stop the LA Unified School District from the building of Jefferson New Middle School, but their influence extended beyond this instance. This situation brought the movement of environmental justice to light within the south central LA community, and set an empowering example for young people to have the ability to educate themselves and stand up to federal officials ignoring their concerns.

=== Alley Clean Up Program ===
Alleys in CCSCLA’s area of concern were considered to be the worst in Los Angeles around the time of its founding. They are used for illegal trash dumping, sites for drug trafficking and crime, and have little to no lighting. Block club participants submitted a petition to the city of Los Angeles demanding that alleys be cleaned, closed to traffic, and fenced off with access only to residents of these communities. This petition resulted in alley clean ups and closures that prevent crime and illegal dumping. CCSCLA also entered into a pilot program with the city of Los Angeles to train community residents, including those formerly incarcerated, to do alley clean up and pothole repair. Fifteen community residents were ultimately given full-time, permanent employment through this pilot program.

=== POWER ===
POWER, or People Organizing for Workplace and Environmental Rights, is a youth program sponsored by CCSCLA sine May 1998.  POWER is a joint program between [[Jefferson High School (Los Angeles)|Jefferson High School]], [[Fremont High School (Los Angeles)|Fremont High School]], and the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California at Los Angeles]]- [http://losh.ucla.edu/ Labor Occupational Safety and Health].&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; CCSCLA worked in conjunction with UCLA-LOSH to create the program curriculum to effectively educate the students on the issues facing their community and to give them the skills to translate the environmental education they receive to action in the community.  It is CCSCLA's aim to empower students to take charge of and be responsible for their neighborhood, workplace, school, and home.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; A notable achievement of the program was the forced closure of a contaminated school site for the entirety of a year while environmental remediation was conducted.  The youth received national acclaim for their efforts in [[Time (magazine)|TIME Magazine]] which published an article titled "Don’t Mess Around with the Toxic Crusaders".&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;Brown, D.E. (1999). Don’t Mess Around with the Toxic Crusaders. Time. 153 (16), 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Antes Columbus Youth Football Club ===
ACYFC, founded through a partnership between CCSCLA and Los Angeles Metropolitan Churches (LMC) is an effort to bring the community together and provide a positive extracurricular activity for youth.  For ages 5–19, the ACYFC provides uniforms, equipment, and team organization with no cost to the players.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  Taking the club a step further, CCSCLA also implemented training programs for sports related business and jobs including: venue management, broadcast recording and editing, concessions management, referee training, league administration, and manufacturing and retail of uniforms.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.guidestar.org/profile/95-4247392|title=Concerned Citizens of South Central Los Angeles - GuideStar Profile|website=www.guidestar.org|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In addition, CCSCLA has been able to provide two synthetic soccer fields for play in the Vernon Central community.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; In 2002 CCSCLA helped facilitate the Nike donation of a synthetic field to [https://www.google.com/maps/place/1501+E+41st+St,+Los+Angeles,+CA+90011/@34.0089705,-118.2498548,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x80c2c88bed9c250f:0xcc954b82ad881bc0!8m2!3d34.0089705!4d-118.2476661 Ross Snyder Park]&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.globalsynturf.com/b/parks-in-la-artificial-grass/1033/|title=18 Parks in LA with Artificial Grass|website=Artificial Grass, Synthetic Turf - Global Syn-Turf|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.csrwire.com/press_releases/24909-Nike-and-US-Soccer-Foundation-Dedicate-Soccer-Field|title=Nike and US Soccer Foundation Dedicate Soccer Field – Press Releases on CSRwire.com|website=www.csrwire.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and facilitated the collection of resources to develop a field for [https://carverms-lausd-ca.schoolloop.com/cms/page_view?d=x&amp;piid=&amp;vpid=1344704518620 George Washington Carver Middle School].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mo.laschools.org/fis/planning/documents/view/2006-2007-s-e-p-amendments/Board_Report_No._354-06_07_Carver_MS_Field.pdf|title=Board_Report_No._354-06_07_Carver_MS_Field|last=|first=|date=2017-03-29|website=mo.laschools.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Entertainment Industry Training Program (EITP) ===
Beginning in 1997, the mission of EITP is to get inner city kids (ages 13–18) acquainted with jobs in the entertainment industry.  Kids work with professionals from the industry on a television or film project during workshops twice a week. Topics of the workshops include:  producing, writing, directing, set design, production management, location scouting, props, music composing, hair and make-up design, wardrobe, art directing, script supervision, stage direction, camera operation, and video editing etc.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; Notable projects produced in the past include: public service announcement- “Choices”, music video for a neighborhood teen, POWER Youth Documentary, and Fame 2000- stage direction and video taping.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;  The EITP program had been partially sponsored by DreamWorks SKG and Sony Pictures Entertainment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.la-youth.org/EITPdesc.html|title=LA Youth Supportive Services, Inc.|website=www.la-youth.org|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Healthcare for community members affected by pollution created from LANCER ===
Pollution created from LANCER and like projects has severely affected the health of members of South Central Los Angeles communities. Inhabitants of these communities are largely racial and/or ethnic minorities of low-income. Mothers in these communities explain that they and their children already face pre-existing health conditions unable to be addressed because of the cost and accessibility of the current healthcare system—conditions such as asthma, influenza, cancer, heart disease, and/or pneumonia.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Ailments of community members are magnified through added health problems caused by pollution in the environment of south-central inhabitants (such as trash-burning from incinerators, chemical exposure from power plants, etc.).

=== Juanita Tate Market Place ===
In April 2014 the Juanita Tate Marketplace opened in Southern Los Angeles in honor of the late [[Juanita Tate|Juanita Tate,]] a member of CCSCLA. The shopping center took nearly two decades to build&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-vacant-lots-20170423-story.html|title='It looks bad. It’s dangerous.'

The retail shopping center is built on a brownfield that was formerly a scrap yard and recycling center. In April 2015 the marketplace was sold to private investors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/juanita-tate-marketplace-sold-to-private-investors-300073925.html|title=Juanita Tate Marketplace Sold to Private Investors|last=|first=|date=April 28, 2015|work=PR Newswire|access-date=April 28, 2017|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voting for the law in Russian Parliament==
The bill was proposed by "[[United Russia]]" deputy {{Interlanguage link multi|Ekaterina Lakhova|ru|3=Лахова, Екатерина Филипповна}}.  The bill passed the [[State Duma]] on 21 December 2012 and the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]] on 27 December 2012.&lt;ref name=rianovosti&gt;{{cite news|title=Russian State Duma Passes Anti-US Adoption Bill|url=http://en.ria.ru/politics/20121221/178311481.html|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=moscownews&gt;{{cite news|last=Burghardt |first=David |title=Russian parliament passes anti-US adoption law |url=http://themoscownews.com/russia/20121226/191064431.html |accessdate=28 December 2012 |newspaper=[[The Moscow News]] |date=26 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115032758/http://themoscownews.com/russia/20121226/191064431.html |archivedate=15 January 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Duma in first reading one was against ([[Ilya Ponomarev]]); in second reading 4 against ([[Ilya Ponomarev]], [[Dmitry Gudkov]], [[Valery Zubov]], [[Sergey Anatolyevich Petrov|Sergei Petrov]] - all from "[[A Just Russia]]" faction); in third and last reading - 8 against (same plus [[Andrei Ozerov]] from "A Just Russia", [[Oleg Smolin]] and [[Zhores Alferov]] from [[Communist Party of the Russian Federation|Communist Party of Russia]], [[Boris Reznik]] from "[[United Russia]]").&lt;ref name=forbes&gt;{{cite news|title=Who voted against Dima Yakovlev law|url=http://www.forbes.ru/sobytiya-photogallery/231313-kto-golosoval-protiv-zapreta-na-usynovlenie-amerikantsami-rossiiskih-si/photo/1|newspaper=[[Forbes]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=secondread&gt;{{cite web|title=List of votes on Dima Yakovlev law|url=http://ilya-ponomarev.livejournal.com/553090.html|last=Ponomarev|first=Ilya|publisher=[[LiveJournal]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Federation Council just one against - [[Larisa Ponomareva]] (mother of [[Ilya Ponomarev]]).

The [[United States Department of State]] said in a press release that it "deeply regret Russia’s passage of a law ending inter-country adoptions between the United States and Russia".&lt;ref name=USdeptofState&gt;{{cite news|last=Ventrell|first=Patrick|title=Statement on Russia's Yakovlev Act|url=https://www.state.gov/r/pa/prs/ps/2012/12/202401.htm|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=[[United States Department of State]]|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Ambassador to Russia]] [[Michael McFaul]] said that the law will "link the fate of orphaned children to unrelated political issues."&lt;ref name=foxnews&gt;{{cite news|title=Putin signs bill banning Americans from adopting Russian children|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2012/12/27/russia-putin-says-intends-to-sign-anti-us-adoptions-bill-into-law/|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=[[Fox News]]|date=28 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesake==
In the State Duma, the law was informally named after '''Dima Yakovlev''' (born '''Dmitry Yakovlev'''), a Russian toddler who was adopted by Miles Harrison of Virginia. The child was renamed '''Chase Harrison''' while in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2008/12/16/AR2008121600924.html |title=On Stand, Man Tells Of Son's Death in Car |publisher=Washingtonpost.com |date= 17 December 2008|accessdate=2012-12-29 |first=Tom |last=Jackman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2008, less than three months after he arrived in America, Dima died while he was strapped into his adoptive father's car. He had been left alone for nine hours in the car as his father had forgotten to take him to daycare service.

Following trial, Harrison was acquitted of [[involuntary manslaughter]] by a Circuit Court judge in [[Fairfax County, Virginia]], on January 2009. The case became national news in Russia, highlighting abuse cases involving Russian children adopted by American parents. Following the child's death, Russian federal prosecutors opened an investigation into the circumstances of the incident, while Russian authorities called to restrict or end the adoption of Russian children by Americans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Russian Furor Over U.S. Adoptions Follows American’s Acquittal in Boy’s Death|author=Ellen Barry|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/04/world/europe/04adopt.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=3 January 2009|accessdate=25 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 December 2012, Governor of [[Pskov Oblast]] Andrei Turchak suspended two officials pending an investigation into their roles in the adoption of Dima Yakovlev.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20121228/178465730.html |title=Russian Local Officials Suspended over Dima Yakovlev Case &amp;#124; Russia &amp;#124; RIA Novosti |publisher=En.rian.ru |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reactions==
Russian human rights ombudsman [[Vladimir Lukin]] said that the law will be contested in Russian constitutional courts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.interfax.co.uk/russia-military-news/dima-yakovlev-law-will-be-contested-in-constitutional-court-lukin-part-2-2/ |title=Dima Yakovlev law will be contested in Constitutional Court |publisher=Interfax.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2012-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Support===
The [[Russian Orthodox Church]] supports the law. Church spokesman Vsevolod Chaplin said that the orphans adopted by American citizens "won't get a truly Christian upbringing and that means falling away from the Church and from the path to eternal life, in [[Kingship and kingdom of God|God's kingdom]]".&lt;ref name=theobserver&gt;{{cite news|last=Elder|first=Miriam|title=Church backs Vladimir Putin's ban on Americans adopting Russian children|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/30/russian-church-backs-putin-adoption-ban|accessdate=30 December 2012|newspaper=[[The Observer]]|date=29 December 2012|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the independent ''[[Moscow Times]]'', the ban has grown increasingly popular among the Russian public.&lt;ref name="moscow times"/&gt;

[[File:1794 Anville Map of Ancient Egypt - Geographicus - Egypt-anville-1794.jpg|thumb|[[Jean Baptiste Bourguignon d'Anville]]'s 1765 map of Ancient Egypt was a significant advance in the [[cartography]] of the subject, allowing readers to understand ancient and modern sites more clearly than previously. It was the primary map used in the 1809–29 [[Description de l'Égypte]].{{sfn|Thompson|2015|p=85|ps=: “Ancient and modern Egypt became easier to conceptualize because of the prolific French cartographer Jean-Baptiste Bourguignon d’Anville (1697–1782). The greatest mapmaker of his age, Bourguignon d’Anville also had a special interest in ancient geography, one that he wrote would not permit me to neglect Egypt, this country so celebrated in antiquity." Instead of copying older maps and blindly replicating their errors and speculations as had long been the practice he sought reliable data and was content to leave spaces blank rather than fill them with conjectural features. He had no firsthand experience with Egypt, but he carefully pored over every available source modern ancient and Arab as he explained in his ‘’Memoires sur l’Egypte ancienne et moderne’’ (1766). Bourguignon d’Anville’s map of Egypt allowed readers to see the relationship of ancient and modern sites much more clearly than before. It continued in use well into the nineteenth century. Although the cartographers of Napoleon’s Egyptian expedition made a more accurate map, it was declared a state secret and Bourguignon d’Anville’s map was printed in its place in the great ‘’Description de l’Egypte.’’”}}]]
'''Egyptology''' (from ''Egypt'' and [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] {{lang|grc|[[wiktionary:-λογία|-λογία]]}}, ''[[wiktionary:-logia|-logia]]''. {{lang-ar|[[wiktionary:علم المصريات|علم المصريات]]}}) is the study of [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[History of Egypt|history]], [[Egyptian language|language]], [[Ancient Egyptian literature|literature]], [[Ancient Egyptian religion|religion]], [[Ancient Egyptian architecture|architecture]] and [[Art of ancient Egypt|art]] from the 5th millennium BC until the end of its native religious practices in the 4th century AD. A practitioner of the discipline is an "[[List of Egyptologists|Egyptologist]]". In Europe, particularly on the [[Continental Europe|Continent]], Egyptology is primarily regarded as being a [[philology|philological]] discipline, while in North America it is often regarded as a branch of [[archaeology]].

==History==

===First explorers===
The first explorers were the ancient Egyptians themselves. [[Thutmose IV]] restored the Sphinx and had the dream that inspired his restoration carved on the famous [[Dream Stele]]. Less than two centuries later, Prince [[Khaemweset]], fourth son of [[Ramesses II]], is famed for identifying and restoring historic buildings, tombs and temples including the pyramid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egyptology.com/niankhkhnum_khnumhotep/index.html  © Greg Reeder] retrieved GMT23:48.3.9.2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Graeco-Roman Period===
Some of the first historical accounts of Egypt were given by [[Herodotus]], [[Strabo]], [[Diodorus Siculus]] and the largely lost work of [[Manetho]], an [[Egyptians|Egyptian]] priest, during the reign of [[Ptolemy I]] and [[Ptolemy II]] in the 3rd century BC. The Ptolemies were much interested in the work of the ancient Egyptians, and many of the Egyptian monuments, including the pyramids, were restored by them (although they built many new temples in the Egyptian style). The Romans also carried out restoration work in Egypt.

===Middle Ages===
Throughout the Middle Ages travelers on a [[pilgrimage]] to the [[Holy Land]] would occasionally deviate to visit sites within Egypt, which would include Cairo and its environs, where the [[Holy Family]] was thought to have fled, and the great Pyramids, which were thought to be [[Joseph's Granaries]], built by the Hebrew patriarch to store grain during the years of plenty.  A number of their accounts (''[[Itineraria]]'') have survived and offer insights as to conditions in their respective time periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicole|last=Chareyron|title=Pilgrims to Jerusalem in the Middle Ages|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York City|date=2005|ISBN=0231132301|pages=127–97}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European explorers===
European exploration and travel writings of ancient Egypt commenced from the 13th century onward, with only occasional detours into a more scientific approach, notably by [[Claude Sicard]], [[Benoît de Maillet]], [[Frederic Louis Norden]] and [[Richard Pococke]]. In the early 17th century, [[John Greaves]] measured the pyramids, having inspected the broken Obelisk of Domitian in Rome, then destined for the Earl of Arundel's collection in London.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|first=Edward|last=Chaney|authorlink=Edward Chaney|chapter=Roma Britannica and the Cultural Memory of Egypt: Lord Arundel and the Obelisk of Domitian|encyclopedia=Roma Britannica: Art Patronage and Cultural Exchange in Eighteenth-Century Rome|editor1-first=David|editor1-last=Marshall|editor2-first=Karin|editor2-last=Wolfe|editor3-first=Susan|editor3-last=Russell|publisher=British School at Rome|date=2011|ISBN=978-0904152555|pages=147–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to publish the illustrated ''Pyramidographia'' in 1646, while the [[Society of Jesus|Jesuit]] scientist-priest [[Athanasius Kircher]] was perhaps the first to hint at the phonetic importance of Egyptian hieroglyphs, demonstrating [[Coptic language|Coptic]] as a vestige of [[Egyptian language|early Egyptian]], for which he is considered a "founder" of Egyptology.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book|first=Thomas|last=Woods|title=How the Catholic Church Built Western Civilization|publisher=Regenery|location=Washington DC|date=2005|ISBN=0-89526-038-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century, with [[Napoleon]]'s scholars' recording of Egyptian flora, fauna and history (published as ''[[Description de l'Egypte (1809)|Description de l'Egypte]]''), the study of many aspects of ancient Egypt became more scientifically oriented. The British captured Egypt from the French and gained the [[Rosetta Stone]]. Modern Egyptology is generally perceived as beginning about 1822.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|first=Brien|last=Foerster|url=http://hiddenincatours.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/Lost-Ancient-Technology-Of-Egypt-Brien-Foerster.pdf|title=Lost Ancient Technology Of Egypt|date=2014|website=hiddenincatours.com|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern Egyptology==
[[File:Monumenti dell'Egitto e della Nubia-plate-0083.jpg|thumbnail|right|Hieroglyphs and depictions transcribed by [[Ippolito Rosellini]] in 1832]]
Egyptology's modern history begins with the [[French campaign in Egypt and Syria|invasion of Egypt]] by [[Napoleon Bonaparte]]. The subsequent publication of [[Description de l'Égypte]] between 1809 and 1829 made numerous ancient Egyptian source materials available to Europeans for the first time.&lt;ref name="Saylor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Egyptology|url=http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ARTH201-Egyptology-FINAL.pdf|publisher=Saylor.org|accessdate=6 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-François Champollion]], [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] and [[Ippolito Rosellini]] were some of the first Egyptologists of wide acclaim. The German [[Karl Richard Lepsius]] was an early participant in the investigations of Egypt; mapping, excavating, and recording several sites. Champollion announced his general decipherment of the system of Egyptian [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphics]] for the first time, employing the Rosetta Stone as his primary aid. The Stone's decipherment was a very important development of Egyptology. With subsequently ever-increasing knowledge of Egyptian writing and language, the study of [[Ancient Egypt]]ian civilization was able to proceed with greater academic rigour and with all the added impetus that comprehension of the written sources was able to engender. Egyptology became more professional via work of [[William Matthew Flinders Petrie]], among others. Petrie introduced techniques of field preservation, recording, and excavating. [[Howard Carter]]'s expedition brought much acclaim to the field of Egyptology. Many highly educated amateurs now also travelled to Egypt, however, including women such as [[Harriet Martineau]] and [[Florence Nightingale]], who both left accounts of their travels, which revealed learned familiarity with all the latest European Egyptology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Edward|last=Chaney|authorlink=Edward Chaney|chapter=Egypt in England and America: The Cultural Memorials of Religion, Royalty and Revolution|title=Sites of Exchange: European Crossroads and Faultlines|editor1-first=Maurizio|editor1-last=Ascari|editor2-first=Adriana|editor2-last=Corrado|publisher=Rodopi, Amsterdam and New York|location=Amsterdam, Netherlands|date=2006|pages=39–74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the modern era, the [[Supreme Council for Antiquities|Ministry of State for Antiquities]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/main.htm The Ministry of State for Antiquities] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927213419/http://www.sca-egypt.org/eng/main.htm |date=2011-09-27 }} retrieved 18:55GMT 3.10.11&lt;/ref&gt; controls excavation permits for Egyptologists to conduct their work. The field can now use [[Geophysical survey (archaeology)|geophysical methods]] and other applications of modern sensing techniques to further Egyptology.

==Academic discipline==
[[Image:Papyrus Ani curs hiero.jpg|thumb|right|A section of the [[Papyrus of Ani]] showing [[cursive hieroglyphs]]]]
Egyptology was established as an [[academic discipline]] through the research of [[Emmanuel de Rougé]] in France, [[Samuel Birch]] in England, and [[Heinrich Brugsch]] in Germany.  In 1880, [[Flinders Petrie]], another British Egyptologist, revolutionized the field of archaeology through controlled and scientifically recorded excavations. Petrie's work determined that Egyptian culture dated back as early as 4500 BC. The British [[Egypt Exploration Fund]] founded in 1882 and other Egyptologists promoted Petrie's methods.  Other scholars worked on producing a hieroglyphic dictionary, developing a Demotic lexicon, and establishing an outline of ancient Egyptian history.&lt;ref name="Saylor" /&gt;

In the United States, the founding of the [[University of Chicago Oriental Institute|Oriental Institute]] at the University of Chicago and the expedition of [[James Henry Breasted]] to Egypt and Nubia established Egyptology as a legitimate field of study. In 1924, Breasted also started the [[Epigraphic Survey (Oriental Institute)|Epigraphic Survey]] with the goal of making and publishing accurate copies of monuments.  In the late 19th and early 20th century the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]]; the [[University of Pennsylvania]]; the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]; the Brooklyn Institute of Fine Arts; and the Institute of Fine Arts, New York University also conducted 
excavations in Egypt, expanding American collections.&lt;ref name="Saylor" /&gt;

Some universities and colleges offer degrees in Egyptology. In the United States, these include the [[University of Chicago]], [[Brown University]], [[New York University]], [[Yale University]] and [[Indiana University - Bloomington]]. There are also many programmes in the United Kingdom, including those at the [[University of Oxford]], the [[University of Cambridge]], [[Swansea University]], the [[University of Liverpool]], and the [[University of London]]. While Egyptology is widely studied in continental Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Where to Study Egyptology|url=http://www.guardians.net/egypt/education/egyptology_universities.htm|work=Guardian's Egypt|accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; only [[Leiden University]] offers English taught degree programs in Egyptology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/egyptology/en/introduction|title=Egyptology, Introduction ~ Masters in Leiden|website=en.mastersinleiden.nl|access-date=2017-01-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118214145/http://en.mastersinleiden.nl/programmes/egyptology/en/introduction|archive-date=2017-01-18|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule''''' (''Foreign Languages and University'') is a triannual [[academic journal]] published by the [[German Association of University Language Centers]].

==History==
The journal was created in 1968 under the title ''AKS-Rundbrief'' (= AKS-Circular) by the German Association of University Language Centers. Being a practice-oriented journal in the first phase of its existence, it has developed into an academic, at times empirical, journal throughout the years.

==Content and scope==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' covers [[second language acquisition]], [[language education]], and [[applied linguistics]], with [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]], [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Italian language|Italian]], and [[German language|German]] as foreign languages being the potential target languages. Intercultural analyses represent an important part as well. Publication languages are German as well as any of the languages mentioned above.

==Publication and editors==
''Fremdsprachen und Hochschule'' is published triannually by the German Association of Language Centers, which is a sub-organization of the [[European Association of Language Centers]]. There are three editors, with manuscripts requiring two positive votes.

==Article types==
In addition to academic [[Article (publishing)|articles]], [[book review]]s on relevant publications, including newly published [[textbook]]s, are also included. In addition, the journal publishes [[call for papers|calls for papers]] and [[academic conference]] announcements. The journal also serves as an information and publication platform for [[UNIcert]] - the international education and certification system for foreign languages taught at universities, which was founded in [[Germany]] and whose headquarters are located there.

'''Georg Friedrich Strass''' ({{lang-fr|Georges Frédéric Strass}}; 29 May 1701, [[Wolfisheim]] near [[Strasbourg]] - 22 December 1773) was an [[Alsace|Alsatian]] [[jeweler]] and inventor of imitation [[gemstones]]. He is best known as the inventor of the [[rhinestone]], called ''strass'' in many European languages, from a particular type of [[crystal]] he found in the river [[Rhine]].

He used mixtures of [[bismuth]] and [[thallium]] to improve the refractive quality of his imitations, and altered their colors with [[metal]] [[salt (chemistry)|salt]]s. The imitations were, in his view, so similar to real gems that he invented the concept of the "simulated gemstone" to describe them. He considerably improved his gems' brilliance by gluing metal foil behind them. This foil was later replaced with a vapor-deposited mirror coating.

Strass opened his own business in 1730, and devoted himself wholly to the development of [[diamond simulant|imitation diamonds]]. Due to his great achievements, he was awarded the title "King's Jeweler" in 1734.

He was a partner in the jewellery business of Madame Prévot. He continued improving his artificial gemstones during this time. His work was in great demand at the court of King [[Louis XV of France]], and he controlled a large market for artificial gems.

Wealthy through his businesses, he was able to retire comfortably at age 52.

The '''Iraq Institute for Strategic Studies''' is an Iraqi research institute focusing on political, socio-economic, religious, and gender issues in Iraq.

==Overview==

IIST was founded in London, England in 1993 as The Iraqi Cultural Forum (ICF), a research group that organized academic conferences and seminars to study Iraq and the wider Middle East. The ICF was initiated by a host of London-Paris based Iraqi scholars and writers, supported by Birkbeck College and the School of Oriental and African Studies (SOAS) of London University.

After the 2003 demise of the Ba'ath regime, the ICF made the decision to move to its native land, Iraq. It was renamed, the Iraqi Institute for Strategic Studies (IIST).

==Training==

The Major Training Courses for 2010-2011 included Young Researchers, Media, Women's Rights, Women NGOs, Management, and Leadership I and II, and Public Integrity I and II.

'''Khirasara''' is an archaeological site belonging to the [[Indus Valley Civilization]]. This site is located in [[Nakhatrana Taluka]] of [[Kutch district]] in the western [[India]]n state of [[Gujarat]]. It is located on the bank of Khari river. The site is 85 km from [[Bhuj]], the district headquarter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pokharia|first=Anil K.|last2=Agnihotri|first2=Rajesh|last3=Sharma|first3=Shalini|last4=Bajpai|first4=Sunil|last5=Nath|first5=Jitendra|last6=Kumaran|first6=R.

==Excavations==
During 1976-77 exploration, an [[Archaeological Survey of India]] official discovered a big cubical weight, chunks of pottery, sprinklers and spouts of red polished ware from the site.&lt;ref name="toi1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2009-11-02/vadodara/28083565_1_excavation-branch-harappan-period-asi|title=ASI to take up excavation in Kutch's Khirasara|last=Rupera|first=Prashant|date=2 November 2009|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=7 August 2010|location=Vadodara}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2009, a team from the [[Vadodara]] division of the Archaeological Survey of India started excavation at this site after the discovery of a 300&amp;nbsp;m² fortification wall.

==Findings==
Specimens of fine perforated pottery were discovered from the site during the excavation.&lt;ref name="toi2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-08-07/india/28296605_1_harappan-sprinklers-and-spouts-dholavira|title=As good as Dholavira?|last=Jaisinghani|first=Bella|date=7 August 2009|work=[[The Times of India]]|accessdate=11 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seals found at this site are exhibited at [[Kutch Museum]].

A "warehouse" found at the site had 14 parallel walls. The warehouse measured 28 metres by 12 metres while the walls had an average length of 10.8 metres and 1.55 metres breadth. Its structure above the walls was made of wood and daub.&lt;ref name="Subramanian 2013"/&gt; Houses have been found signifying beautiful residence of the community. Rectangular shaped rooms, connected to each other and furnace for cooking; and foundation pillars have also been found. The walls of the houses are made with bricks and mud. For making footpath outside the houses mud, pieces of vessels, shells and small stones have been used.

Bone pots (used to preserve ash and bones after death) and pieces of shells have been recovered from the rooms. Unearthed some fine specimens of perforated pottery, which will be matched with the items recovered from other [[Harappa]]n sites in order to identify and date them. The ones found in the upper layer are likely to belong to a later period while the ones found in the deeper layer will be older. The "[[subsistence pattern]]," or the trade and livelihood options of the lost colony will also become known after further excavations.

It is known now that it was a major industrial hub of the mature Harappan period and it flourished from circa 2600 to 2200 BCE.&lt;ref name="Subramanian 2013"&gt;{{cite web | last=Subramanian | first=T.

'''''Trial by Jury''''', or '''''Laying Down the Law''''' as it is commonly known, is an oil-on-canvas painting from [[1840 in art|1840]] by the English painter [[Sir Edwin Landseer]], which satirises the legal profession. It depicts dogs in the roles of members of the court with a [[poodle|French poodle]] centre stage as the judge. The painting was inspired by a chance comment by a judge, while at dinner with Landseer, that the French poodle belonging to amateur artist and renowned socialite, the [[Alfred Guillaume Gabriel, Count D'Orsay|Count d'Orsay]], "would make a capital Lord Chancellor".

Landseer was a member of the [[Royal Academy]] and had become famous for his paintings and drawings of animals. His later works include ''[[Monarch of the Glen (painting)|The Monarch of the Glen]]'', an iconic and much-reproduced painting of a stag in the [[Scottish Highlands|Highlands]], and the sculptures of the lions at the foot of [[Nelson's Column]] in [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].

He completed ''Trial by Jury'' in 1840 — it was exhibited at the Royal Academy in the same year and was acquired by [[William Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire]], who had Landseer add his [[spaniel|Blenheim spaniel]], Bony, into the scene behind the [[greyhound]]. Early copies of the painting can be seen with Bony absent. The original now hangs in the Sculpture Gallery at [[Chatsworth House]]. The poodle has been variously identified as representing [[Lord Brougham]], who had been [[Lord Chancellor]] from 1830 to 1834, or [[Lord Lyndhurst]], who had held the post three times (1827&amp;ndash;1830, 1834&amp;ndash;1835, and 1841&amp;ndash;1846).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="47626">The '''minimum driving age''' is the minimum age at which a person may obtain a [[driver's licence]] to lawfully drive a motor vehicle on public roads. That age is determined by and for each jurisdiction and is most commonly set at 18 years of age, but learner drivers may be permitted on the road at an earlier age under supervision. Before reaching the minimum age for a driver's licence or anytime afterwards, the person wanting the licence would normally be tested for driving ability and knowledge of road rules before being issued with a licence, provided he or she is above the minimum driving age. Countries with the lowest driving ages (17 and below) are Canada, El Salvador, Iceland, Israel, Malaysia, New Zealand, the Philippines, the United Kingdom (Mainland), United States and Zimbabwe. In several jurisdictions in the United States and Canada, drivers can be as young as 14.

Most jurisdictions recognise driver's licences issued by another jurisdiction, which may result in a young person who obtains a licence in a jurisdiction with a low minimum driving age being permitted to drive in a jurisdiction which normally has a higher driving age.

The minimum age may vary depending on vehicle type. This list refers to the minimum driving age for a motor vehicle with a maximum authorized mass not exceeding 3,500 [[kilogram|kg]] and designed and constructed for the carriage of no more than eight passengers in addition to the driver (not including a trailer).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4538">A '''Lord Advocate's Reference''' is a [[Procedural law|procedure]] by which the [[Lord Advocate]], can refer a [[point of law]] which has arisen during the course of [[solemn proceedings]], to the [[High Court of Justiciary]] sitting as the [[Court of Criminal Appeal]], for a determination. The Lord Advocate is the [[Law Officers of the Crown|senior law officer]] of the [[Scottish Government]] and [[Prosecutor|chief public prosecutor]] and head of the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service]] in [[Scotland]].

Lord Advocate's References used to be particularly important, because prior to the coming into force of sections 73-76 of the [[Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010]], a trial judge sitting alone in solemn proceedings and bound by appeal court [[precedent (law)|precedent]] had to rule on points of law without a [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown]] right of appeal. This resulted in several controversial verdicts of [[acquittal]], especially in relation to no case to answer submissions tendered under section 97 of the [[Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

== Statutory provisions ==
The opinions expressed by the court in response to the reference do not affect the original verdict of the court from which the reference originated, but rather, serve to clarify or develop the interpretation of a particular point of law for the benefit of future proceedings. Lord Advocate's references commonly arise out of [[Scottish criminal trials|criminal trials]] which involve the interpretation of new or complex issues of [[Scots law]]. There is no time limit for the reference to be submitted to the court.&lt;ref name="Faculty"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oag.gov.uk/oag/files/Faculty%20of%20Advocates.pdf|title=Response by the Faculty of Advocates to the request for further consultation by the Office of the Advocate General for Scotland|publisher=Faculty of Advocates|accessdate=8 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of the Lord Advocate to refer points of law to the High Court of Justiciary for an opinion, is provided for by section 123 of the ''Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995'', which states:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite legislation UK|type=act|year=1995|chapter=46|act=Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|text=(1) Where a person tried on indictment is acquitted or convicted of a charge, the Lord Advocate may refer a point of law which has arisen in relation to that charge to the High Court for their opinion;... (5) The opinion on the point referred under subsection (1) above shall not affect the acquittal or, as the case may be, conviction in the trial.|sign=Section 123|source=Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995}}

The [[Criminal charge|panel (accused)]] at the trial diet from which the reference originates has a statutory right to be present at the hearing either in person, or represented by an [[Faculty of Advocates|advocate]]. If they decline to appear or be represented, the court will appoint counsel to act at the hearing as ''[[amicus curiae]]''. The cost of any counsel or ''amicus curiae'' must be met by the Lord Advocate, following a determination of fees payable by the [[Auditor of the Court of Session]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is also common for the [[Advocate General for Scotland]] to be represented at a Section 123 hearing.{{Citation needed|date=May 2017}}

Section 74 of the ''Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010'' introduced the right of the [[Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service|Crown]] to appeal against decisions of a court in solemn proceedings to dismiss a charge on the basis of ''no case to answer'' (under Section 97 of the ''Criminal Procedure (Scotland) Act 1995''), and the right of the Crown to appeal against determinations on the sufficiency of evidence, and acquittals based on sufficiency of evidence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite legislation Scotland|type=act|year=2010|chapter=13|act=Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mega Babies''''' is a [[Television in Canada|Canadian]]-[[Television in the United States|American]] [[animated series]] created by the Tremblay brothers, Christian and Yvon, who previously had made the [[Hanna-Barbera|H-B]]'s show ''[[SWAT Kats: The Radical Squadron]]''. It is produced by [[CinéGroupe]] and [[Landmark Entertainment Group]] in association with [[Sony Wonder]].&lt;ref&gt;"{{cite web |url=http://www.cinegroupe.ca/english_v2/indexhtml.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-01-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071009020632/http://www.cinegroupe.ca/english_v2/indexhtml.html |archivedate=2007-10-09 |df= }} ," ''[[CinéGroupe]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was broadcast on [[Fox Family Channel]] and [[Teletoon]]. The show was also aired in UK on [[Sky One]]'s weekday mornings and later repeated on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] on weekend mornings between 2001 and 2002.

==Synopsis==
The show is about a trio of babies who are [[superhero]]es that fight off evil monsters and aliens. Their names are Meg, Derrick and Buck and their care-giver's name is Nurse Lazlo. The show takes place in Your City, USA.

After their birth, they are brought to an orphanage.  When the entire solar system aligned itself, the babies and their nurse were struck by lightning.  The babies were given super strength and other powers, and Nurse Lazlo's IQ rose.

The show uses a lot of [[toilet humor]] based on snot, [[vomit]], feces, flatulence, drool, [[Basilic vein|veins popping out of muscular parts]], and various other bodily fluids coming from the cast.

==Voice actors==
Buck was voiced by [[Sonja Ball]], Dean Hagopian voiced many male characters, Laura Teasdale did Derrick's voice, Meg was voiced by [[Jaclyn Linetsky]], and [[Bronwen Mantel]] voiced Nurse Lazlo.

Even though the voice acting was done in [[Montreal]], the voice directing was done by [[Vancouver]] based veteran voice actor and voice director [[Terry Klassen]] who has done voiceovers for many animated television series and films such as voicing Krillin in the [[Ocean Studios|Ocean]] dubbed version of ''[[Dragon Ball Z]]''. Klassen has also voice directed over works such as ''[[Ed, Edd n Eddy]]'', ''[[Johnny Test]]'', ''[[Cardcaptors]]'', several ''[[Barbie (film series)|Barbie]]'' films, and more recently, ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic]]''. This was the only time Klassen has ever voice directed an animated project outside of Vancouver. During the later episodes [[Terrence Scammell (Canadian actor)|Terrence Scammell]] who also voiced several characters in the series as well as providing the main title narration took over as voice director. Scammell has also done many voice acting roles for film, television and video games in both Montreal and [[Ottawa]], Ontario.

==Video game==
Entitled with the same name, this video game based on the show was developed and published by [[2K Play|Global Star Software]] in 2000, exclusively for [[Personal computer|PC]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museumofplay.org/online-collections/22/52/109.11301 109.11301: Mega Babies | video game | PC Games | Video Games | Online Collections | The Strong]&lt;/ref&gt;

He worked 1928 to 1933 as a director/conductor of the Broadcasting Orchestra in [[Bucharest]]. In 1944 he became vice-president of the society of Romanian composers: however, he soon came under the reproach of formalism into criticism of the new communist government. In 1953, he was rehabilitated and reallowed to join the Composers' Union.{{Clarify|date=September 2010}}

He composed six [[ballet]]s, one [[symphony]], two major [[orchestra]] works, [[chamber-music]]al works, and many pieces of piano, [[choir]] music, and [[vocal music]].

[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|350px|Different approaches toward resolving the mind–body problem]]

The '''mind–body problem''' is a philosophical problem concerning the relationship between thought and consciousness in the human mind and the brain as part of the physical body. It is distinct from the question of how mind and body function chemically and physiologically since that question presupposes an interactionist account of mind-body relations.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|title=Rene Descartes: The Mind-Body Distinction|date=|website=Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=|issn=2161-0002|quote=The real distinction of mind and body based on their completely diverse natures is the root of the famous mind-body problem: how can these two substances with completely different natures causally interact so as to give rise to a human being capable of having voluntary bodily motions and sensations?|last1=Skirry|first1=Justin|accessdate=20 December 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161119144904/http://www.iep.utm.edu/descmind/#H4|archivedate=19 November 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This question arises when mind and body are considered as distinct, based on the premise that the mind and the body are fundamentally different in nature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The problem was addressed by [[René Descartes]] in the 17th century, resulting in [[Cartesian dualism]], and by pre-[[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian]] philosophers,&lt;ref name="Young"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=RC Olby |editor2=GN Cantor |editor3=JR Christie |editor4=MJS Hodges |title=Companion to the History of Modern Science |publisher=Taylor and Francis |year=1996 |pages=702–11 |isbn=0415145783 |chapter=The mind–body problem |url=http://human-nature.com/rmyoung/papers/pap102h.html |author=Robert M.

A variety of approaches have been proposed. Most are either [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]] or [[Monism|monist]]. Dualism maintains a rigid distinction between the realms of mind and matter. [[Monism]] maintains that there is only one unifying reality, substance or essence in terms of which everything can be explained.

Each of these categories contain numerous variants. The two main forms of dualism are [[substance dualism]], which holds that the mind is formed of a distinct type of substance not governed by the laws of physics, and [[property dualism]], which holds that mental properties involving conscious experience are fundamental properties, alongside the fundamental properties identified by a completed physics. The three main forms of monism are [[physicalism]], which holds that the mind consists of matter organized in a particular way; [[idealism]], which holds that only thought truly exists and matter is merely an illusion; and [[neutral monism]], which holds that both mind and matter are aspects of a distinct essence that is itself identical to neither of them. [[Psychophysical parallelism]] is a third possible alternative regarding the relation between mind and body, between interaction (dualism) and one-sided action (monism).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Parallelism, Psychophysical |volume=20 |page=762}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several philosophical perspectives have been developed which reject the mind–body dichotomy. The [[historical materialism]] of [[Karl Marx]] and subsequent writers, itself a form of physicalism, held that consciousness was engendered by the material contingencies of one's environment.&lt;ref&gt;K. Marx, A Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy, Progress Publishers, Moscow, 1977, with some notes by R. Rojas.&lt;/ref&gt; An explicit rejection of the dichotomy is found in French [[structuralism]], and is a position that generally characterized post-war [[Continental philosophy]].&lt;ref name=Turner&gt;{{cite book |title=The Body and Society: Explorations in Social Theory |author=Bryan S. Turner |page=78 |quote=...a rejection of any dualism between mind and body, and a consequent insistence on the argument that the body is never simply a physical object but always an embodiment of consciousness. |isbn=1412929873 |year=2008 |publisher=Sage Publications |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FYKjzsc6SkAC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The absence of an empirically identifiable meeting point between the non-physical mind (if there is such a thing) and its physical extension has proven problematic to dualism, and many modern philosophers of mind maintain that the mind is not something separate from the body.&lt;ref name="Kim1"&gt;{{cite book

An ancient model of the mind known as the Five-Aggregate Model explains the mind as continuously changing sense impressions and mental phenomena.&lt;ref name=Aggregates&gt;{{cite journal |author=Karunamuni N.D. |title=The Five-Aggregate Model of the Mind |journal=SAGE open |volume=5 |issue=2 |date=May 2015 |url=http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |doi=10.1177/2158244015583860 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921004343/http://sgo.sagepub.com/content/spsgo/5/2/2158244015583860.full.pdf |archivedate=2016-09-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Considering this model, it is possible to understand that it is the constantly changing sense impressions and mental phenomena (i.e., the mind) that experiences/analyzes all external phenomena in the world as well as all internal phenomena including the body anatomy, the nervous system as well as the organ brain. This conceptualization leads to two levels of analyses: (i) analyses conducted from a third-person perspective on how the brain works, and (ii) analyzing the moment-to-moment manifestation of an individual’s mind-stream (analyses conducted from a first-person perspective). Considering the latter, the manifestation of the mind-stream is described as happening in every person all the time, even in a scientist who analyses various phenomena in the world, including analyzing and hypothesizing about the organ brain.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt;

==Mind–body interaction and mental causation==
Philosophers David L. Robb and John F. Heil introduce mental causation in terms of the mind–body problem of interaction:
{{quote|Mind–body interaction has a central place in our pretheoretic conception of agency. Indeed, mental causation often figures explicitly in formulations of the mind–body problem. Some philosophers insist that the very notion of psychological explanation turns on the intelligibility of mental causation. If your mind and its states, such as your beliefs and desires, were causally isolated from your bodily behavior, then what goes on in your mind could not explain what you do. If psychological explanation goes, so do the closely related notions of agency and moral responsibility. Clearly, a good deal rides on a satisfactory solution to the problem of mental causation [and] there is more than one way in which puzzles about the mind's "causal relevance" to behavior (and to the physical world more generally) can arise.

[René Descartes] set the agenda for subsequent discussions of the mind–body relation. According to Descartes, minds and bodies are distinct kinds of "substance". Bodies, he held, are spatially extended substances, incapable of feeling or thought; minds, in contrast, are unextended, thinking, feeling substances. If minds and bodies are radically different kinds of substance, however, it is not easy to see how they "could" causally interact. [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elizabeth of Bohemia]] puts it forcefully to him in a 1643 letter:
&lt;blockquote&gt;how the human soul can determine the movement of the animal spirits in the body so as to perform voluntary acts—being as it is merely a conscious substance. For the determination of movement seems always to come about from the moving body's being propelled—to depend on the kind of impulse it gets from what sets it in motion, or again, on the nature and shape of this latter thing's surface. Now the first two conditions involve contact, and the third involves that the impelling thing has extension; but you utterly exclude extension from your notion of soul, and contact seems to me incompatible with a thing's being immaterial...&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Elizabeth is expressing the prevailing mechanistic view as to how causation of bodies works. Causal relations countenanced by contemporary physics can take several forms, not all of which are of the push–pull variety.&lt;ref name="sep-mental-causation"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |first=David |last=Robb |first2=John |last2=Heil |editor=Edward N. Zalta |title=Mental Causation |encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |year=2009 |edition=Summer 2009 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2009/entries/mental-causation/}}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Robb and John Heil|"Mental Causation" in ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''}}

Contemporary [[neurophilosopher]] Georg Northoff suggests that mental causation is compatible with classical formal and final causality.&lt;ref name=Northoff&gt;{{cite book |title=Philosophy of the Brain: The Brain Problem |author=Georg Northoff |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CJq4QDixIg0C&amp;pg=PT148&amp;lpg=PT148 |publisher=John Benjamins Publishing |isbn=1588114171 |year=2004 |edition=Volume 52 of Advances in Consciousness Research |pages=137–139 |quote=The restriction of causality to 'efficient causality' lead to the neglect of 'goal-orientation' since it was no longer necessary within [that] framework. Not considering 'goal-orientation' resulted in the neglect of 'embedment' and the consequential presupposition of 'isolation' with separation between brain, body, and environment. Neglecting 'embedment' lead to the equation of perception/action with sensory impression/movement which could be well accounted for by 'efficient causality'. Accordingly, since dominated by 'efficient causality', qualia and intentionality, as related to perception/action rather than to sensory impression/movement, were excluded from science and consequently regarded [as] purely philosophical problems. Analogous to 'final causes', 'formal causes' were eliminated as well. 'Efficient causality' is not compatible with 'embedded coding' [which] is necessarily tied with 'formal causality' and 'final causality'... Finally, the possibility of mental causation remains incompatible with 'efficient causality'. It can, however, be properly described by 'formal and final causality'.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologist, theoretical neuroscientist and philosopher, [[Walter Jackson Freeman III|Walter J. Freeman]], suggests that explaining mind–body interaction in terms of "circular causation" is more relevant than linear causation.&lt;ref name=Pockett&gt;{{cite book |title=Does Consciousness Cause Behavior? |editor1=Susan Pockett |editor2=WP Banks |editor3=Shaun Gallagher |chapter=Consciousness, intentionality and causality |author=Walter J Freeman |publisher=MIT Press |year =2009 |isbn=0262512572 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=G5CaTnNksgkC&amp;pg=PA4 |pages=4–5, 88–90 |quote=Walter Freeman, with his usual originality, suggest that we may be looking at the whole thing in completely the wrong way when we ask whether consciousness causes or is caused by neural activity. He suggests that circular causation is a more relevant concept in this regard than linear causation. Consciousness and neural activity are certainly interdependent, but it is impossible in principle to say that either causes the other. Thus the whole concept of consciousness as agent is simply a misreading of the true situation.}} Through my readings in physics and philosophy, I learned the concept of circular causality, which invokes hierarchical interactions of immense numbers of semiautonomous elements such as neurons, which form nonlinear systems. These exchanges lead to the formation of macroscopic population dynamics that shapes the pattern of activity of the contributing individuals. Circular causality departs so strongly from the classical tenets of necessity, invariance, and precise temporal order that the only reason to call it that is to satisfy the human habitual need for causes. The most subtle shift is the disappearance of agency, which is equivalent to loss of Aristotle's efficient cause. The very strong appeal of agency to explain events may come from the subjective experience of cause and effect that develops early in human life, before the acquisition of language .the question I raise here is whether brains share this property with other material objects in the world. The answer I propose is that assignment of cause and effect to one's self and to others having self-awareness is entirely appropriate, but that investing insensate objects with causation is comparable to investing them with teleology and soul.
The further question is: Does it matter whether or not causality is assigned to objects? The answer is "Very much." Several examples are given of scientific errors attributed to thinking in terms of linear causality. The most important, with wide ramifications, is the assumption of universal determinacy, by which the causes of human behavior are limited to environmental and genetic factors, and the causal power of self-determination is excluded from scientific consideration.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[neuroscience]], much has been learned about correlations between brain activity and subjective, conscious experiences. Many suggest that neuroscience will ultimately explain consciousness:

{{quote|Cognitive science today gets increasingly interested in the embodiment of human perception, thinking, and action. Abstract information processing models are no longer accepted as satisfactory accounts of the human mind. Interest has shifted to interactions between the material human body and its surroundings and to the way in which such interactions shape the mind. Proponents of this approach have expressed the hope that it will ultimately dissolve the Cartesian divide between the immaterial mind and the material existence of human beings (Damasio, 1994; Gallagher, 2005). A topic that seems particularly promising for providing a bridge across the mind–body cleavage is the study of bodily actions, which are neither reflexive reactions to external stimuli nor indications of mental states, which have only arbitrary relationships to the motor features of the action (e.g., pressing a button for making a choice response). The shape, timing, and effects of such actions are inseparable from their meaning. One might say that they are loaded with mental content, which cannot be appreciated other than by studying their material features. Imitation, communicative gesturing, and tool use are examples of these kinds of actions.&lt;ref name="Goldenberg2008"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Morsella, E. |editor2=Bargh, J.A. |editor3=Gollwitzer, P.M. |first=Georg |last=Goldenberg |year=2008 |title=Oxford Handbook of Human Action |chapter=Chapter 7, How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia |series=Social Cognition and Social Neuroscience |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |isbn=9780195309980 |lccn=2008004997 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zFP1AZYlNmcC&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Georg Goldenberg|"How the Mind Moves the Body: Lessons From Apraxia" in ''Oxford Handbook of Human Action''}}

===Neurobiology and neurophilosophy===

If such animals, for instance, were magically given the power of language, would their communities evolve an intelligence as subtly discriminating as ours?

Dennett addresses these questions from an evolutionary perspective.  Beginning with the macromolecules of DNA and RNA, the author shows how, step-by-step, animal life moved from the simple ability to respond to frequently recurring environmental conditions to much more powerful ways of beating the odds, ways of using patterns of past experience to predict the future in never-before-encountered situations.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
have focused primarily on the body rather than the mind. In this context, neuronal correlates may be viewed as causing consciousness, where consciousness can be thought of as an undefined property that depends upon this [[complex systems|complex]], adaptive, and highly interconnected biological system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Squire |first=Larry R. |authorlink=Larry Squire |title=Fundamental neuroscience |edition=3rd |publisher=[[Academic Press]] |year=2008 |page=1223 |isbn=0-12-374019-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it's unknown if discovering and characterizing neural correlates may eventually provide a theory of consciousness that can explain the first-person experience of these "systems", and determine whether other systems of equal complexity lack such features.

The massive parallelism of neural networks allows redundant populations of neurons to mediate the same or similar percepts. Nonetheless, it is assumed that every subjective state will have associated neural correlates, which can be manipulated to artificially inhibit or induce the subject's experience of that conscious state. The growing ability of neuroscientists to manipulate neurons using methods from molecular biology in combination with optical tools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Adamantidis A.R. |author2=Zhang F. |author3=Aravanis A.M. |author4=Deisseroth K. |author5=de Lecea L. |year=2007 |title=Neural substrates of awakening probed with optogenetic control of hypocretin neurons |journal=Nature}}&lt;/ref&gt; was achieved by the development of behavioral and organic models that are amenable to large-scale genomic analysis and manipulation. Non-human analysis such as this, in combination with imaging of the human brain, have contributed to a robust and increasingly predictive theoretical framework.

===Arousal and content===
[[File:NeuralCorrelatesOfConsciousness2.jpg|thumb|right|Midline structures in the brainstem and thalamus necessary to regulate the level of brain arousal.

To be conscious ''of'' something, the brain must be in a relatively high state of arousal (sometimes called ''vigilance''), whether awake or in [[REM sleep]]. Brain arousal level fluctuates in a [[circadian rhythm]] but these natural cycles may be influenced by lack of sleep, alcohol and other drugs, physical exertion, etc. Arousal can be measured behaviorally by the signal amplitude required to trigger a given reaction (for example, the sound level that causes a subject to turn and look toward the source). High arousal states involve conscious states that feature specific perceptual content, planning and recollection or even fantasy. Clinicians use scoring systems such as the [[Glasgow Coma Scale]] to assess the level of arousal in patients with ''impaired states of consciousness'' such as the [[coma|comatose state]], the [[persistent vegetative state]], and the [[minimally conscious state]]. Here, "state" refers to different amounts of externalized, physical consciousness: ranging from a total absence in coma, persistent vegetative state and [[general anesthesia]], to a fluctuating, minimally conscious state, such as sleep walking and [[epileptic]] seizure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Schiff |first=Nicholas D. |date=November 2004 |contribution=The neurology of impaired consciousness: Challenges for cognitive neuroscience. |editor-last=Gazzaniga |editor-first=Michael S. |editor-link=Michael Gazzaniga |edition=3rd |title=The Cognitive Neurosciences |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=0-262-07254-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many nuclei with distinct chemical signatures in the [[thalamus]], [[midbrain]] and [[pons]] must function for a subject to be in a sufficient state of brain arousal to experience anything at all. These nuclei therefore belong to the enabling factors for consciousness. Conversely it is likely that the specific content of any particular conscious sensation is mediated by particular neurons in the cortex and their associated satellite structures, including the [[amygdala]], [[thalamus]], [[claustrum]] and the [[basal ganglia]].

==Historical background==
The following is a very brief account of some contributions to the mind–body problem.

===The Buddha===
{{See also|Gautama Buddha|Buddhism and the body|Pratītyasamutpāda}}

The Buddha (480–400 B.C.E), founder of [[Buddhism]], described the mind and the body as depending on each other in a way that two sheaves of reeds were to stand leaning against one another&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html Nalakalapiyo Sutta: Sheaves of Reeds] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160503051913/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/sn/sn12/sn12.067.than.html |date=2016-05-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and taught that the world consists of mind and matter which work together, interdependently. Buddhist teachings describe the mind as manifesting from moment to moment, one thought moment at a time as a fast flowing stream.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The components that make up the mind are known as the five aggregates (i.e., material form, feelings, perception, volition, and sensory consciousness), which arise and pass away continuously. The arising and passing of these aggregates in the present moment is described as being influenced by five causal laws: biological laws, psychological laws, physical laws, volitional laws, and universal laws.&lt;ref name="Aggregates"/&gt; The Buddhist practice of [[mindfulness]] involves attending to this constantly changing mind-stream.

Ultimately, the Buddha's philosophy is that both mind and forms are conditionally arising qualities of an ever-changing universe in which, when [[Nirvana (Buddhism)|nirvāna]] is attained, all phenomenal experience ceases to exist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html Rohitassa Sutta: To Rohitassa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110512204617/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.045.than.html |date=2011-05-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[anatta|anattā]] doctrine of the Buddha, the conceptual self is a mere mental construct of an individual entity and is basically an impermanent illusion, sustained by form, sensation, perception, thought and consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html The Five Aggregates: A Study Guide] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917193707/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/study/khandha.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha argued that mentally clinging to any views will result in delusion and stress,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html Sabbasava Sutta: All the Fermentations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060625214552/http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.002.than.html |date=1899-01-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; since, according to the Buddha, a real self (conceptual self, being the basis of standpoints and views) cannot be found when the mind has clarity.

===Plato===
{{See also|Plato|Theory of forms}}
[[Plato]] (429–347 B.C.E.) believed that the material world is a shadow of a higher reality that consists of concepts he called Forms. According to Plato, objects in our everyday world "participate in" these Forms, which confer identity and meaning to material objects. For example, a circle drawn in the sand would be a circle only because it participates in the concept of an ideal circle that exists somewhere in the world of Forms. He argued that, as the body is from the material world, the soul is from the world of Forms and is thus immortal. He believed the soul was temporarily united with the body and would only be separated at death, when it would return to the world of [[Theory of forms|Forms]]. Since the soul does not exist in time and space, as the body does, it can access universal truths. For Plato, ideas (or Forms) are the true reality, and are experienced by the soul. The body is for Plato empty in that it can not access the [[theory of forms|abstract reality]] of the world; it can only experience shadows. This is determined by Plato's essentially [[Rationalism|rationalistic]] [[epistemology]].{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

===Aristotle===
{{Main|Aristotle}}
For [[Aristotle]] (384–322 BC) ''mind'' is a faculty of the ''soul''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gendlin|2012b|page=121–122}}&lt;div align=left&gt;432a1-2&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=right&gt;'''Hence''' the soul is '''as''' the hand is; '''for&lt;br&gt;the hand is a tool of tools''', and&lt;br&gt;'''the nous is a form of forms'''&lt;br&gt;(ὥστε ἡ ψυχὴ ὥσπερ ἡ χείρ ἐστιν· καὶ γὰρ η χεὶρ ὄργανόν&lt;br&gt;ἐστιν ὀργάνων)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aristotle now lets this aspect of nous and hand define a new term which he does not use anywhere else, so far as I know.  The hand is “a tool of tools.” The nous is a “form of forms.” The hand and the soul are unique in this respect.  Let us see further what this means.&lt;br&gt;
Aristotle seems to say that the nous is a form, but on closer inspection we find that it is not, or at least not the usual kind.  Nous is a maker of forms.  A “form of forms” is like a tool of tools, like a living body’s organ that makes tools. Nous is certainly not itself the sort of form that it makes.  The hand is not a made tool (it would have to be made by yet another hand).&lt;br&gt;'''In Greek “tool” and “organ” are the same word.  So we see: ”In the phrase “tool of tools” the first use of the word stands for a living organ, the second for an artificially made tool.''' In II-4 he says “all natural bodies are tools (organs) of the soul’s,” (both as food and as material from which to make tools).  In English we would say that the '''hand is the organ of tools.'''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hicks|1907|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/aristotledeanima005947mbp#page/n629/mode/2up p. 542]}}&lt;br&gt; '''431b230&amp;ndash;432a14.''' To sum up: the soul is in a manner the universe of things, which is made up of things sensible and things intelligible: and knowledge is in a manner identical with its object, the intelligible; sense with its object, the sensible. This statement calls for further explanation. Sense and knowledge, whether potential or actual, are distributed over things potential or actual, as the case may be. In the soul, again, the sensitive faculty and the cognitive faculty are potentially their respective objects. These objects must therefore exist in the soul, not indeed as concrete wholes, form and matter combined, which is impossible: it must be the ''forms'' of things which exist in the soul. Thus within the soul intellect is the form of forms, i.e. of intelligible forms, and sense the form of sensibles, precisely as in the body the hand is the instrument of instruments, i.e. the instrument by which other instruments are acquired.&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the soul, he said:
{{quote|It is not necessary to ask whether soul and body are one, just as it is not necessary to ask whether the wax and its shape are one, nor generally whether the matter of each thing and that of which it is the matter are one. For even if one and being are spoken of in several ways, what is properly so spoken of is the actuality.| ''De Anima'' ii 1, 412b6–9|}}

In the end, Aristotle saw the relation between soul and body as uncomplicated, in the same way that it is uncomplicated that a cubical shape is a property of a toy building block. The soul is a property exhibited by the body, one among many. Moreover, Aristotle proposed that when the body perishes, so does the soul, just as the shape of a building block disappears with destruction of the block.&lt;ref name=Shields&gt;{{cite web |author=Shields, Christopher |title=Aristotle's Psychology |work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Spring 2011 Edition)|editor=Edward N.

===Influences of Eastern monotheistic religions===
{{main|Dualistic cosmology|Gnosticism}}
In [[religious philosophy]] of Eastern monotheism, dualism denotes a [[binary opposition]] of an idea that contains two essential parts. The first formal concept of a "mind-body" split may be found in the ''"[[divinity]] - [[secularity]]"'' dualism of the ancient Persian religion of [[Zoroastrianism]] around the mid-fifth century BC. [[Gnosticism]] is a modern name for a variety of ancient dualistic ideas inspired by [[Judaism]] popular in the first and second century AD.  These ideas later seem to have been incorporated into  [[Galen]]'s ''"tripartite soul"''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Researchgate:Galen and the tripartite soul] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that led into both the Christian sentiments &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html Early Christian writings:Galen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170531173126/http://www.earlychristianwritings.com/galen.html |date=2017-05-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; expressed in the later [[Augustinian theodicy]] and [[Avicenna]]’s  [[Platonism in Islamic Philosophy]].

===Thomas Aquinas===
{{Main|Thomas Aquinas}}
Like [[Aristotle]], [[St. Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) believed that the mind and the body are one, like the seal and the wax are one, and it is therefore pointless to ask whether they are one.  However, (referring to "mind" as "the soul") he asserted that the soul persists after the death of the body in spite of their unity, calling the soul "this particular thing".  Since his view was primarily theological rather than philosophical, it is impossible to fit it neatly within either the category of [[physicalist]] or [[Dualism (philosophy of mind)|dualist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=McInerny |first1=Ralph |last2=O'Callaghan |first2=John |title=Saint Thomas Aquinas |journal=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |date=Summer 2018 |url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2018/entries/aquinas/ |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Descartes===
{{Main|René Descartes}}
[[René Descartes]] (1596–1650) believed that mind exerted control over the brain ''via'' the [[pineal gland]]:

His posited relation between mind and body is called [[Cartesian dualism]] or [[substance dualism]]. He held that ''mind'' was distinct from ''matter'', but could influence matter. How such an interaction could be exerted remains a contentious issue.

===Kant===
{{Main|Immanuel Kant}}
For [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (1724–1804) beyond ''mind'' and ''matter'' there exists a world of ''a priori'' forms, which are seen as necessary preconditions for understanding. Some of these forms, space and time being examples, today seem to be pre-programmed in the brain.

===Huxley===
{{Main|Thomas Huxley}}
For [[Thomas Huxley|Huxley]] (1825–1895) the conscious mind was a by-product of the brain that has no influence upon the brain, a so-called [[Epiphenomenalism|epiphenomenon]].

===Whitehead===
{{Main|Alfred North Whitehead}}
[[Alfred North Whitehead|A. N. Whitehead]] advocated a sophisticated form of [[panpsychism]] that has been called by [[David Ray Griffin]] ''[[Panpsychism#Panexperientialism|panexperientialism]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., Ronny Desmet and [[Michel Weber]] (edited by), ''[https://www.academia.edu/279940/Whitehead._The_Algebra_of_Metaphysics Whitehead.

===Popper===
{{Main|Karl Popper}}
For [[Karl Popper|Popper]] (1902–1994) there are ''three'' aspects of the mind–body problem: the worlds of matter, mind, and of the creations of the mind, such as [[mathematics]]. In his view, the third-world creations of the mind could be interpreted by the second-world mind and used to affect the first-world of matter. An example might be [[radio]], an example of the interpretation of the third-world (Maxwell's [[electromagnetic theory]]) by the second-world mind to suggest modifications of the external first world.
{{quote|The body–mind problem is the question of whether and how our thought processes in World 2 are bound up with brain events in World 1. ...I would argue that the first and oldest of these attempted solutions is the only one that deserves to be taken seriously [namely]: World 2 and World 1 interact, so that when someone reads a book or listens to a lecture, brain events occur that ''act'' upon the World 2 of the reader's or listener's thoughts; and conversely, when a mathematician follows a proof, his World 2 ''acts'' upon his brain and thus upon World 1. This, then, is the thesis of body–mind interaction.&lt;ref name=Popper&gt;

===Searle===
{{Main|John Searle}}
For [[John Rogers Searle|Searle]] (b. 1932) the mind–body problem is a [[false dichotomy]]; that is, mind is a perfectly ordinary aspect of the brain.  
{{quote|According to Searle then, there is no more a mind–body problem than there is a macro–micro economics problem. They are different levels of description of the same set of phenomena.

In [[linguistics]], '''morphosyntactic alignment''' is the grammatical relationship between [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s—specifically, between the two [[Argument (linguistics)|argument]]s (in English, subject and object) of [[transitive verb]]s like ''the dog chased the cat'', and the single argument of [[intransitive verb]]s like ''the cat ran away''. English has a ''[[subject (grammar)|subject]],'' which merges the more active argument of transitive verbs with the argument of intransitive verbs, leaving the ''[[object (grammar)|object]]'' distinct; other languages may have different strategies, or, rarely, make no distinction at all. Distinctions may be made [[morphology (linguistics)|morphologically]] (through [[grammatical case]] or [[agreement (linguistics)|verbal agreement]]), [[syntax|syntactically]] (through [[word order]]), or both.

For example, in English, in ''the dog chased the cat'' (transitive verb, two arguments), and in ''the bird flew'' (intransitive verb, one argument), 'dog' and 'bird' are both subjects, which is shown by their appearance before the verb, while 'cat' is different, an object, coming after the verb. Not all languages treat 'dog' and 'bird' as equivalent the way English does: in some 'cat' and 'bird' will be equivalent, while 'dog' is different, and there are yet other systems.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

== Semantics and grammatical relations ==

Transitive verbs have two core arguments, labelled '''A''' (the more active or in-control) and '''O''', which in a language like English are [[subject (grammar)|subject]] (A) and [[object (grammar)|object]] (O). [[Intransitive verb]]s have a single core argument, labelled '''S''', which in English (but not in all languages) is also a subject. 

(The label P is sometimes used in place of O. Note that while the labels S, A, O, and P originally stood for "subject", "[[agent (grammar)|agent]]", "object", and "[[patient (grammar)|patient]]" respectively, the concepts of S, A, and O/P are distinct both from the traditional [[grammatical function|grammatical relations]] "subject" and "object", and from the [[thematic relation]]s "agent" and "patient": an A or S need not be an agent or subject, an O need not be a patient, even in a language where they usually are.)

Generally, not all three of these labelled arguments (S, A, O) are distinct. In most languages, two are treated one way (such as the subject in English, which covers S and A) and the third is distinct (as the object in English, which covers O). That is, the labels are abstractions. They help illustrate the similarities and differences between languages, but are not real in all but a handful. There is no reality to S vs A in English, for example, only between S/A and O; in other languages, A will be realized, but not S vs O. 

The best-known system is the English type, with a distinct O (object). These are called ''nominative–accusative'' languages, or just ''accusative'' languages, after the [[nominative case|nominative]] and [[accusative case|accusative]] cases, which are how A/S and O are distinguished in Latin. The best known of the other systems is the ''ergative'' system, named after the [[ergative case]], which is how A is marked in many languages (such as [[Inuit languages|Inuit]] and [[Basque language|Basque]]) which distinguish A from S/O. Yet other systems are found in many Native American languages and in the Philippines. Many Australian languages will sometimes be one, and sometimes another, depending on the situation.

The principal types, or ''alignments'', so called because S is said to "align" with either A (as in English) or O (as in Inuit languages) are summarized here. The distinction between the two most common systems is expanded upon in the next section. For further information, including the rarer systems, see the individual articles.

# '''Nominative–accusative''' (or '''accusative''') '''alignment''' treats the S argument of an intransitive verb like the A argument of transitive verbs, with the O argument distinct (&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''S'''&lt;/span&gt; = &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''A'''&lt;/span&gt;; &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''O'''&lt;/span&gt; separate) (see [[nominative–accusative language]]). In a language with morphological case marking, an S and an A may both be unmarked or marked with the [[nominative case]] while the O is marked with an [[accusative case]] (or sometimes an [[oblique case]] used for [[dative case|dative]] or [[instrumental case|instrumental]] case roles also), as occurs with nominative ''-us'' and accusative ''-um'' in Latin:  ''Juli&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''us'''&lt;/span&gt; venit'' "Julius came"; ''Juli&lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;'''us'''&lt;/span&gt; Brut&lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;'''um'''&lt;/span&gt; vidit'' "Julius saw Brutus". Languages with nominative–accusative alignment can detransitivize transitive verbs by demoting the A argument and promoting the O to be an S (thus taking nominative case marking); it is called the [[passive voice]]. Most of the world's languages have accusative alignment. &lt;br&gt;An uncommon subtype is called '''marked nominative''' or '''[[nominative–absolutive language|nominative–absolutive]]'''. In such languages, the subject of a verb is marked for nominative case, but the object is unmarked, as are citation forms and objects of prepositions. Such alignments are clearly documented only in northeastern Africa, particularly in the [[Cushitic languages]], with and the southwestern United States and adjacent parts of Mexico, in the [[Yuman languages]].
# '''Ergative–absolutive''' (or '''ergative''') '''alignment''' treats an intransitive argument like a transitive O argument (S=O; A separate) (see [[ergative–absolutive language]]). An A may be marked with an [[ergative case]] (or sometimes an [[oblique case]] used also for the [[genitive case|genitive]] or [[instrumental case|instrumental]] case roles) while the S argument of an intransitive verb and the O argument of a transitive verb are left unmarked or sometimes marked with an [[absolutive case]]. Ergative–absolutive languages can detransitivize transitive verbs by demoting the O and promoting the A to an S, thus taking the absolutive case, called the [[antipassive voice]]. About a sixth of the world's languages have ergative alignment. The best known are probably Inuit and Basque.
# '''Fluid''' (or '''semantic''') '''alignment''' (see [[active–stative language]]s) treats the arguments of intransitive verbs like the A argument of transitives (like English) in some cases and like transitive O arguments (like Inuit) in other cases (S&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt;=A; S&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;=O). For example, in Georgian, ''Mariam'''ma''' imğera'' "Mary (-ma) sang", ''Mariam'' shares the same narrative case ending as in the transitive clause ''Mariam'''ma''' c'eril'''i''' dac'era'' "Mary (-ma) wrote the letter (-i)", while in ''Mariam'''i''' iq'o Tbilisši revolutsiamde'' "Mary (-i) was in Tbilisi up to the revolution", ''Mariam'' shares the same case ending (-i) as the object of the transitive clause. Thus, the arguments of intransitive verbs are not uniform in its behaviour. &lt;br&gt;The reasons for treating intransitive arguments like A or like O usually have a semantic basis. The particular criteria vary from language to language and may be either fixed for each verb or chosen by the speaker according to the degree of volition, control, or suffering of the participant or to the degree of sympathy that the speaker has for the participant.
# '''[[Austronesian alignment]]''', also called '''Philippine-type alignment''', is found in the [[Austronesian languages]] of the Philippines, Borneo, Taiwan, and Madagascar. These languages have both accusative-type and ergative-type alignments in transitive verbs. They are traditionally (and misleadingly) called "active" and "passive" voice because the speaker can choose to use either one rather like active and passive voice in English. However, because they are not true [[grammatical voice|voice]], terms such as "agent trigger" or "actor focus" are increasingly used for the accusative type (S=A) and "patient trigger" or "undergoer focus" for the ergative type (S=O). (The terms with "trigger" may be preferred over those with "focus" because these are not [[focus (linguistics)|focus]] systems either; morphological alignment has a long history of confused terminology). Patient-trigger alignment is the default in most of these languages. For either alignment, two core cases are used (unlike passive and antipassive voice, which have only one), but the same morphology is used for the "nominative" of the agent-trigger alignment and the "absolutive" of the patient-trigger alignment so there is a total of just three core cases: common S/A/O (usually called ''nominative,'' or less ambiguously ''[[direct case|direct]]''), ''ergative'' A, and ''accusative'' O. Some Austronesianists argue that these languages have ''four'' alignments, with additional "voices" that mark a [[locative case|locative]] or [[benefactive case|benefactive]] with the direct case, but most maintain that these are not core arguments and thus not basic to the system.
#'''Direct alignment''': a very few languages make no distinction among agent, patient, and intransitive arguments, leaving the hearer to rely entirely on context and common sense to figure them out. This S/A/O case is called ''direct'', as it sometimes is in Austronesian alignment.
#'''Tripartite alignment''': some others, called '''[[tripartite language]]s''', use a separate case or syntax for each argument, which are conventionally called the [[accusative case]], the [[intransitive case]], and the [[ergative case]]. The [[Nez Perce language]] is a notable example.
#'''Transitive alignment''': certain [[Iranian language]]s, such as [[Rushani language|Rushani]], distinguish only transitivity (in the past tense), using a ''[[transitive case]]'' for both A and O, and an ''intransitive case'' for S. That is sometimes called a ''double-oblique'' system, as the transitive case is equivalent to the accusative in the non-past tense.

The direct, tripartite, and transitive alignment types are all quite rare. The alignment types other than Austronesian and Fluid can be shown graphically like this:

[[Image:MorphSyntAlign.svg]]

In addition, in some languages,  both nominative–accusative and ergative–absolutive systems may be used, split between different grammatical contexts, called [[split ergativity]]. The split may sometimes be linked to [[animacy]], as in many [[Australian Aboriginal languages]], or to [[grammatical aspect|aspect]], as in [[Mayan languages]]. A few Australian languages, such as [[Diyari language|Diyari]], are split among accusative, ergative, and tripartite alignment, depending on animacy.

A popular idea, introduced in Anderson (1976),&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Stephen. (1976). On the notion of subject in ergative languages. In C. Li. (Ed.), ''Subject and topic'' (pp. 1–24). New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; is that some constructions universally favor accusative alignment while others are more flexible. In general, behavioral constructions ([[argument control|control]], [[raising (linguistics)|raising]], [[relative clause|relativization]]) are claimed to favor nominative–accusative alignment while coding constructions (especially case constructions) do not show any alignment preferences. This idea underlies early notions of ‘deep’ vs. ‘surface’ (or ‘syntactic’ vs. ‘morphological’) ergativity (e.g. Comrie 1978;&lt;ref&gt;Comrie, Bernard. (1978). Ergativity. In W. P. Lehmann (Ed.), Syntactic typology: Studies in the phenomenology of language (pp. 329–394). Austin: University of Texas Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Dixon 1994&lt;ref&gt;Dixon, R. M. W. (1994). Ergativity. Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;): many languages have surface ergativity only (ergative alignments only in their coding constructions, like case or agreement) but not in their behavioral constructions or at least not in all of them. Languages with [[syntactic ergativity|deep ergativity]] (with ergative alignment in behavioral constructions) appear to be less common.

== Ergative vs. accusative ==

Ergative languages contrast with ''nominative–accusative'' languages (such as English), which treat the objects of transitive verbs distinctly from other core arguments.

These different arguments can be symbolized as follows:

* '''O''' = most patient-like argument of a transitive clause (also symbolized as '''P''')
* '''S''' = sole argument of an intransitive clause
* '''A''' = most agent-like argument of a transitive clause

The S/A/O terminology avoids the use of terms like "subject" and "object", which are not stable concepts from language to language. Moreover, it avoids the terms "agent" and "patient", which are semantic roles that do not correspond consistently to particular arguments. For instance, the A might be an [[experiencer]] or a source, semantically, not just an [[agent (grammar)|agent]].

The relationship between ergative and accusative systems can be schematically represented as the following:

{| class="wikitable" cellpadding="5"
| &amp;nbsp;
! Ergative–absolutive
! Nominative–accusative
|-
| '''O'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;same&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;different&lt;/span&gt;
|-
| '''S'''
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;same&lt;/span&gt;

| &lt;span style="color:#800000"&gt;different&lt;/span&gt;
| &lt;span style="color:#008000"&gt;same&lt;/span&gt;
|}

The following [[Basque language|Basque]] examples demonstrate ergative–absolutive case marking system:

| '''Translation:'''

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;

|} 

In Basque, ''gizona'' is "the man" and ''mutila'' is "the boy". In a sentence like 
''mutila gizonak ikusi du'', you know who's seeing whom because -k is always added to the one doing the seeing. So this means 'the man saw the boy'. To say 'the boy saw the man', just add the "-k" to the boy: ''mutilak gizona ikusi du''.

With a verb like ''etorri'' "come" there's no need to tell "who's coming whom", so no -k is ever added. "The boy came" is 'mutila etorri da'. 

To contrast with a nominative–accusative language, [[Japanese language|Japanese]] marks nouns with a different case marking:

:{| cellpadding="6" style="line-height: 1em;"

| '''Translation:'''

| &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;
| colspan="2" | 'The man saw the child.'
|} 

In this language, in the sentence "man saw child", the one doing the seeing (''man'') may be marked with ''ga'', which works like Basque  "-k" (and the one who is seen may be marked with ''o''). However, in the sentences like ''the child arrived'', where there's no need of telling "who arrived whom", there may be a ''ga''. This is unlike Basque, where "-k" is completely forbidden in such sentences.

'''Neoclassicism''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] νέος ''nèos'', "new" and [[Latin]] ''classicus'', "of the highest rank")&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=neo-classical| title=Etymology of the English word "neo-classical"| accessdate=2016-05-09| publisher=myetymology.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is the name given to Western [[Cultural movement|movements]] in the decorative and visual arts, literature, theatre, music, and architecture that draw inspiration from the "classical" art and culture of [[classical antiquity]]. Neoclassicism was born largely thanks to the writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]], at the time of the rediscovery of [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], but its popularity spread all over Europe as a generation of European art students finished their [[Grand Tour]] and returned from Italy to their home countries with newly rediscovered Greco-Roman ideals.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.it/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1189&amp;dq=neoclassicism+originated+in.Rome&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCl9eT0cLVAhVLDcAKHSy7B1cQ6AEIKjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=neoclassicism%20originated%20in.Rome&amp;f=false]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://archiv.ub.uni-heidelberg.de/artdok/volltexte/2010/978 The road from Rome to Paris. The birth of a modern Neoclassicism]&lt;/ref&gt; The main Neoclassical movement coincided with the 18th-century [[Age of Enlightenment]], and continued into the early 19th century, laterally competing with [[Romanticism]]. In architecture, the style continued throughout the 19th, 20th and up to the 21st century.

European Neoclassicism in the [[visual art]]s began c. 1760 in opposition to the then-dominant [[Rococo]] style. Rococo architecture emphasizes grace, ornamentation and asymmetry; Neoclassical architecture is based on the principles of simplicity and symmetry, which were seen as virtues of the arts of [[Ancient Rome|Rome]] and [[Ancient Greece]], and were more immediately drawn from 16th-century [[Renaissance|Renaissance Classicism]]. Each "neo"-classicism selects some models among the range of possible classics that are available to it, and ignores others. The Neoclassical writers and talkers, patrons and collectors, artists and sculptors of 1765–1830 paid homage to an ''idea'' of the generation of [[Phidias]], but the sculpture examples they actually embraced were more likely to be Roman copies of Hellenistic sculptures. They ignored both Archaic Greek art and the works of [[Late Antiquity]]. The "Rococo" art of ancient [[Palmyra]] came as a revelation, through engravings in Wood's ''The Ruins of Palmyra''. Even Greece was all-but-unvisited, a rough backwater of the [[Ottoman Empire]], dangerous to explore, so Neoclassicists' appreciation of Greek architecture was mediated through drawings and engravings, which subtly smoothed and regularized, "corrected" and "restored" the monuments of Greece, not always consciously.

==History==
Neoclassicism is a revival of the many styles and spirit of classic antiquity inspired directly from the classical period,&lt;ref name=Irwin&gt;{{cite book |title = Neoclassicism A&amp;I (Art and Ideas)| last=Irwin| first=David G.| publisher =  Phaidon Press|year = 1997 | pages = | isbn=978-0-7148-3369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; which coincided and reflected the developments in [[philosophy]] and other areas of the Age of  Enlightenment, and was initially a reaction against the excesses of the preceding [[Rococo]] style.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 17-25; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt; While the movement is often described as the opposed counterpart of [[Romanticism]], this is a great over-simplification that tends not to be sustainable when specific artists or works are considered. The case of the supposed main champion of late Neoclassicism, [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]], demonstrates this especially well.&lt;ref&gt;A recurring theme in Clark: 19-23, 58-62, 69, 97-98 (on Ingres); Honour, 187-190; Novotny, 86-87&lt;/ref&gt; The revival can be traced to the establishment of formal archaeology.&lt;ref name=Lingo&gt;{{cite book |title = François Duquesnoy and the Greek ideal| last=Lingo| first=Estelle Cecile| publisher = Yale University Press; First Edition|year = 2007| pages = [https://books.google.com/books?id=Wlq67ikF0OEC&amp;pg=PA161&amp;dq=Winckelmann+Neoclassicism&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zGxFT-GiPMHWiAKY_dypDg&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=Winckelmann%20Neoclassicism&amp;f=false 161]| isbn=978-0-300-12483-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Classical Savannah: fine &amp; decorative arts, 1800-1840| last=Talbott | first=Page| publisher = University of Georgia Press |year = 1995| pages = 6| isbn=978-0-8203-1793-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Johann Joachim Winckelmann (Anton von Maron 1768).jpg|thumb|left|250|Johann Joachim Winckelmann, often called "the father of archaeology"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Culture and values: a survey of the humanities| last=Cunningham, Reich| first= Lawrence S., John J. | publisher = Wadsworth Publishing; 7 edition|year = 2009| pages = 104 | isbn=978-0-495-56877-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The writings of [[Johann Joachim Winckelmann]] were important in shaping this movement in both architecture and the visual arts. His books ''Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture'' (1750) and ''Geschichte der Kunst des Alterthums'' ("History of Ancient Art", 1764) were the first to distinguish sharply between Ancient Greek and Roman art, and define periods within Greek art, tracing a trajectory from growth to maturity and then imitation or decadence that continues to have influence to the present day. Winckelmann believed that art should aim at "noble simplicity and calm grandeur",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 57-62, 61 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; and praised the idealism of Greek art, in which he said we find "not only nature at its most beautiful but also something beyond nature, namely certain ideal forms of its beauty, which, as an ancient interpreter of [[Plato]] teaches us, come from images created by the mind alone". The theory was very far from new in Western art, but his emphasis on close copying of Greek models was: "The only way for us to become great or if this be possible, inimitable, is to imitate the ancients".&lt;ref&gt;Both quotes from the first pages of "Thoughts on the Imitation of Greek Works in Painting and Sculpture"&lt;/ref&gt;

With the advent of the [[Grand Tour]], a fad of collecting [[antiquities]] began that laid the foundations of many great collections spreading a Neoclassical revival throughout Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = In Pursuit of Ancient Pasts: A History of Classical Archaeology in the Nineteenth and Twentieth Centuries| last= Dyson| first=Stephen L.| publisher = Yale University Press |year = 2006| pages = xii | isbn=978-0-300-11097-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Neoclassicism" in each art implies a particular canon of a "classical" model.

In English, the term "Neoclassicism" is used primarily of the visual arts; the similar movement in [[English literature]], which began considerably earlier, is called [[Augustan literature]]. This, which had been dominant for several decades, was beginning to decline by the time Neoclassicism in the visual arts became fashionable. Though terms differ, the situation in French literature was similar. In music, the period saw the rise of [[classical music]], and "Neoclassicism" is used of [[Neoclassicism (music)|20th-century developments]]. However, the operas of [[Christoph Willibald Gluck]] represented a specifically Neoclassical approach, spelt out in his preface to the published score of ''[[Alceste (Gluck)|Alceste]]'' (1769), which aimed to reform opera by removing [[ornamentation (music)|ornamentation]], increasing the role of the chorus in line with [[Greek tragedy]], and using simpler unadorned melodic lines.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mengs, Urteil des Paris.jpg|thumb|[[Anton Raphael Mengs]], ''[[Judgement of Paris]]'', c. 1757, bought by [[Catherine the Great]] from the studio]]

The term "Neoclassical" was not invented until the mid-19th century, and at the time the style was described by such terms as "the true style", "reformed" and "revival"; what was regarded as being revived varying considerably. Ancient models were certainly very much involved, but the style could also be regarded as a revival of the [[Renaissance]], and especially in France as a return to the more austere and noble [[Baroque]] of the age of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], for which a considerable nostalgia had developed as France's dominant military and political position started a serious decline.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 11, 23-25&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres|Ingres]]'s coronation portrait of Napoleon even borrowed from Late Antique [[consular diptych]]s and their [[Carolingian art|Carolingian]] revival, to the disapproval of critics.

Neoclassicism was strongest in [[architecture]], [[sculpture]] and the [[decorative arts]], where classical models in the same medium were relatively numerous and accessible; examples from ancient painting that demonstrated the qualities that Winckelmann's writing found in sculpture were and are lacking. Winckelmann was involved in the dissemination of knowledge of the first large Roman paintings to be discovered, at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]] and, like most contemporaries except for [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], was unimpressed by them, citing [[Pliny the Younger]]'s comments on the decline of painting in his period.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 44-46; Novotny, 21&lt;/ref&gt;

As for painting, Greek painting was utterly lost: Neoclassicist painters imaginatively revived it, partly through bas-relief friezes, mosaics and pottery painting, and partly through the examples of painting and decoration of the High Renaissance of [[Raphael]]'s generation, frescos in Nero's ''[[Domus Aurea]]'', [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]], and through renewed admiration of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. Much "Neoclassical" painting is more classicizing in subject matter than in anything else. A fierce, but often very badly informed, dispute raged for decades over the relative merits of Greek and Roman art, with Winckelmann and his fellow Hellenists generally the winning side.&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 43-62&lt;/ref&gt;

==Painting and printmaking==
[[File:(20) Flaxman Ilias 1795, Zeichnung 1793, 194 x 338 mm.jpg|thumb|Print of a drawing by [[John Flaxman]] of a scene in [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', 1795]]

It is hard to recapture the radical and exciting nature of early Neoclassical painting for contemporary audiences; it now strikes even those writers favourably inclined to it as "insipid" and "almost entirely uninteresting to us"—some of [[Kenneth Clark]]'s comments on [[Anton Raphael Mengs]]' ambitious ''Parnassus'' at the [[Villa Albani]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 20 (quoted); Honour, 14; [[:File:Mengs Parnasus.jpg|image of the painting]] (in fairness, other works by Mengs are more successful)&lt;/ref&gt; by the artist who his friend Winckelmann described as "the greatest artist of his own, and perhaps of later times".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 31-32 (31 quoted)&lt;/ref&gt; The drawings, subsequently turned into [[old master print|prints]], of [[John Flaxman]] used very simple line drawing (thought to be the purest classical medium&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 113-114&lt;/ref&gt;) and figures mostly in profile to depict ''[[The Odyssey]]'' and other subjects, and once "fired the artistic youth of Europe" but are now "neglected",&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 14&lt;/ref&gt; while the [[history painting]]s of [[Angelica Kauffman]], mainly a portraitist, are described as having "an unctuous softness and tediousness" by [[Fritz Novotny]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 62&lt;/ref&gt;  Rococo frivolity and Baroque movement had been stripped away but many artists struggled to put anything in their place, and in the absence of ancient examples for history painting, other than the [[Ancient Greek pottery|Greek vases]] used by Flaxman, [[Raphael]] tended to be used as a substitute model, as Winckelmann recommended. 
[[File:David-Oath of the Horatii-1784.jpg|thumb|left|[[Jacques-Louis David]], ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'', 1784]]

The work of other artists, who could not easily be described as insipid, combined aspects of Romanticism with a generally Neoclassical style, and form part of the history of both movements.  The German-Danish painter [[Asmus Jacob Carstens]] finished very few of the large mythological works that he planned, leaving mostly drawings and colour studies which often succeed in approaching Winckelmann's prescription of "noble simplicity and calm grandeur".&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 51-54&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Carstens' unrealized schemes, the [[etching]]s of [[Giovanni Battista Piranesi]] were numerous and profitable, and taken back by those making the [[Grand Tour]] to all parts of Europe. His main subject matter was the buildings and ruins of Rome, and he was more stimulated by the ancient than the modern. The somewhat disquieting atmosphere of many of his ''Vedute'' (views) becomes dominant in his series of 16 prints of ''Carceri d'Invenzione'' ("Imaginary Prisons") whose "oppressive cyclopean architecture" conveys "dreams of fear and frustration".&lt;ref&gt;Clark, 45-58 (47-48 quoted); Honour, 50-57&lt;/ref&gt; The Swiss-born [[Henry Fuseli|Johann Heinrich Füssli]] spent most of his career in England, and while his fundamental style was based on Neoclassical principles, his subjects and treatment more often reflected the "Gothic" strain of [[Romanticism]], and sought to evoke drama and excitement.

Neoclassicism in painting gained a new sense of direction with the sensational success of [[Jacques-Louis David]]'s ''[[Oath of the Horatii]]'' at the [[Paris Salon|Paris Salon of 1785]]. Despite its evocation of republican virtues, this was a commission by the royal government, which David insisted on painting in Rome. David managed to combine an idealist style with drama and forcefulness. The central perspective is perpendicular to the picture plane, made more emphatic by the dim arcade behind, against which the heroic figures are disposed as in a [[frieze]], with a hint of the artificial lighting and staging of [[opera]], and the classical colouring of [[Nicholas Poussin]]. David rapidly became the leader of French art, and after the [[French Revolution]] became a politician with control of much government patronage in art. He managed to retain his influence in the [[Napoleon]]ic period, turning to frankly propagandistic works, but had to leave France for exile in Brussels at the [[Bourbon Restoration]].&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 34-37; Clark, 21-26; Novotny, 19-22&lt;/ref&gt;

David's many students included [[Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres]], who saw himself as a classicist throughout his long career, despite a mature style that has an equivocal relationship with the main current of Neoclassicism, and many later diversions into [[Orientalism]] and the [[Troubadour style]] that are hard to distinguish from those of his unabashedly Romantic contemporaries, except by the primacy his works always give to drawing. He exhibited at the Salon for over 60 years, from 1802 into the beginnings of [[Impressionism]], but his style, once formed, changed little.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 39-47;Clark, 97-145; Honour, 187-190&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sculpture==
[[File:Canova-Hebe 30 degree view.jpg|thumb|260px|''Hebe'' by [[Canova]] (1800–05), in the appropriately Neoclassical surroundings of the [[Hermitage Museum]]]]
If Neoclassical painting suffered from a lack of ancient models, Neoclassical sculpture tended to suffer from an excess of them, although examples of actual Greek sculpture of the "classical period" beginning in about 500 BC were then very few; the most highly regarded works were mostly Roman copies.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378&lt;/ref&gt; The leading Neoclassical sculptors enjoyed huge reputations in their own day, but are now less regarded, with the exception of [[Jean-Antoine Houdon]], whose work was mainly portraits, very often as busts, which do not sacrifice a strong impression of the sitter's personality to idealism. His style became more classical as his long career continued, and represents a rather smooth progression from Rococo charm to classical dignity. Unlike some Neoclassical sculptors he did not insist on his sitters wearing Roman dress, or being unclothed. He portrayed most of the great figures of the Enlightenment, and travelled to America to produce a [[George Washington (Houdon)|statue of George Washington]], as well as busts of [[Thomas Jefferson]], [[Benjamin Franklin|Ben Franklin]] and other luminaries of the new republic.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 378–379&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chinard, Gilbert, ed., Houdon in America'' Arno PressNy, 1979, a reprint of a book published by Johns Hopkins University, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Antonio Canova]] and the Dane [[Bertel Thorvaldsen]] were both based in Rome, and as well as portraits produced many ambitious life-size figures and groups; both represented the strongly idealizing tendency in Neoclassical sculpture. Canova has a lightness and grace, where Thorvaldsen is more severe; the difference is exemplified in their respective groups of the ''Three Graces''.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 379-384&lt;/ref&gt; All these, and Flaxman, were still active in the 1820s, and Romanticism was slow to impact sculpture, where versions of Neoclassicism remained the dominant style for most of the 19th century.

An early Neoclassicist in sculpture was the Swede [[Johan Tobias Sergel]].&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 384-385&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Flaxman]] was also, or mainly, a sculptor, mostly producing severely classical reliefs that are comparable in style to his prints; he also designed and modelled Neoclassical ceramics for [[Josiah Wedgwood]] for several years. [[Johann Gottfried Schadow]] and his son [[Rudolph Schadow|Rudolph]], one of the few Neoclassical sculptors to die young, were the leading German artists,&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 388-389&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Franz Anton von Zauner]] in Austria. The late Baroque Austrian sculptor [[Franz Xaver Messerschmidt]] turned to Neoclassicism in mid-career, shortly before he appears to have suffered some kind of mental crisis, after which he retired to the country and devoted himself to the highly distinctive "character heads" of bald figures pulling extreme facial expressions.&lt;ref&gt;Novotny, 390-392&lt;/ref&gt; Like Piranesi's ''Carceri'', these enjoyed a great revival of interest during the age of [[psychoanalysis]] in the early 20th century. The Dutch Neoclassical sculptor [[Mathieu Kessels]] studied with Thorvaldsen and worked almost exclusively in Rome.

Since prior to the 1830s the United States did not have a sculpture tradition of its own, save in the areas of tombstones, weathervanes and ship figureheads,&lt;ref&gt;Gerdts, William H., ''American Neo-Classic Sculpture: The Marble Resurrection'',  Viking Press, New York, 1973 p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; the European Neoclassical manner was adopted there, and it was to hold sway for decades and is exemplified in the sculptures of  [[Horatio Greenough]], [[Hiram Powers]], [[Randolph Rogers]] and [[William Henry Rinehart]].

Neoclassicism first gained influence in England and France, through a generation of French art students trained in Rome and influenced by the writings of Winckelmann, and it was quickly adopted by progressive circles in other countries such as Sweden and Russia. At first, classicizing decor was grafted onto familiar European forms, as in the interiors for [[Catherine the Great|Catherine II]]'s lover, [[Grigory Orlov|Count Orlov]], designed by an Italian architect with a team of Italian ''[[stucco|stuccadori]]'': only the isolated oval medallions like cameos and the [[bas-relief]] overdoors hint of Neoclassicism; the furnishings are fully Italian Rococo.

A second Neoclassic wave, more severe, more studied (through the medium of [[engraving]]s) and more consciously archaeological, is associated with the height of the [[Napoleon|Napoleonic Empire]]. In France, the first phase of Neoclassicism was expressed in the "Louis XVI style", and the second in the styles called "Directoire" or [[Empire style|Empire]]. The Rococo style remained popular in Italy until the Napoleonic regimes brought the new archaeological classicism, which was embraced as a political statement by young, progressive, urban Italians with republican leanings.{{according to whom|date=March 2013}}

In the decorative arts, Neoclassicism is exemplified in Empire furniture made in Paris, London, New York, Berlin; in [[Biedermeier]] furniture made in Austria; in [[Karl Friedrich Schinkel]]'s museums in Berlin, Sir [[John Soane]]'s Bank of England in London and the newly built "[[United States Capitol|capitol]]" in Washington, D.C.; and in [[Josiah Wedgwood|Wedgwood]]'s [[bas relief]]s and "black basaltes" [[vase]]s. The style was international; Scots architect [[Charles Cameron (architect)|Charles Cameron]] created palatial Italianate interiors for the German-born [[Catherine II the Great]], in Russian St. Petersburg.

Indoors, Neoclassicism made a discovery of the genuine classic interior, inspired by the rediscoveries at [[Pompeii]] and [[Herculaneum]]. These had begun in the late 1740s, but only achieved a wide audience in the 1760s,&lt;ref name="Gontar"&gt;Gontar&lt;/ref&gt; with the first luxurious volumes of tightly controlled distribution of ''[[Le Antichità di Ercolano]]'' (''The Antiquities of Herculaneum''). The antiquities of Herculaneum showed that even the most classicizing interiors of the [[Baroque]], or the most "Roman" rooms of [[William Kent]] were based on [[basilica]] and [[temple]] exterior architecture turned outside in, hence their often bombastic appeatrance to modern eyes: [[pediment]]ed window frames turned into [[gilding|gilded]] mirrors, fireplaces topped with temple fronts. The new interiors sought to recreate an authentically Roman and genuinely interior vocabulary. Techniques employed in the style included flatter, lighter motifs, sculpted in low [[frieze]]-like relief or painted in monotones ''[[Camaïeu|en camaïeu]]'' ("like cameos"), isolated medallions or vases or busts or ''[[bucrania]]'' or other motifs, suspended on swags of laurel or ribbon, with slender arabesques against backgrounds, perhaps, of "Pompeiian red" or pale tints, or stone colors. The style in France was initially a Parisian style, the ''[[Goût grec]]'' ("Greek style"), not a court style; when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] acceded to the throne in 1774, [[Marie Antoinette]], his fashion-loving Queen, brought the "Louis XVI" style to court. However, there was no real attempt to employ the basic forms of Roman furniture until around the turn of the century, and furniture-makers were more likely to borrow from ancient architecture, just as silversmiths were more likely to take from ancient pottery and stone-carving than metalwork: "Designers and craftsmen ... seem to have taken an almost perverse pleasure in transferring motifs from one medium to another".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 110–111, 110 quoted&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Château de Malmaison - Appartement de Joséphine 003.jpg|thumb|[[Château de Malmaison]], 1800, room for the [[Joséphine de Beauharnais|Empress Joséphine]], on the cusp between [[Directoire style]] and [[Empire style]]]]

From about 1800 a fresh influx of Greek architectural examples, seen through the medium of etchings and engravings, gave a new impetus to Neoclassicism, the [[Greek Revival]]. At the same time the [[Empire style]] was a more grandiose wave of Neoclassicism in architecture and the decorative arts. Mainly based on Imperial Roman styles, it originated in, and took its name from, the rule of [[Napoleon]] in the [[First French Empire]], where it was intended to idealize Napoleon's leadership and the French state. The style corresponds to the more bourgeois [[Biedermeier]] style in the German-speaking lands, [[Federal architecture|Federal style]] in the United States,&lt;ref name="Gontar"/&gt; the [[Regency style]] in Britain, and the ''Napoleon style'' in Sweden. According to the art historian [[Hugh Honour]] "so far from being, as is sometimes supposed, the culmination of the Neo-classical movement, the Empire marks its rapid decline and transformation back once more into a mere antique revival, drained of all the high-minded ideas and force of conviction that had inspired its masterpieces".&lt;ref&gt;Honour, 171–184, 171 quoted&lt;/ref&gt; An earlier phase of the style was called the [[Adam style]] in Great Britain and "Louis Seize", or Louis XVI, in France.

Neoclassicism continued to be a major force in [[academic art]] through the 19th century and beyond—a constant antithesis to [[Romanticism]] or [[Gothic revival]]s —, although from the late 19th century on it had often been considered anti-modern, or even reactionary, in influential critical circles.{{who|date=March 2013}} The centres of several European cities, notably [[Saint Petersburg|St. Petersburg]] and [[Munich]], came to look much like museums of Neoclassical architecture.

Gothic revival architecture (often linked with the Romantic cultural movement), a style originating in the 18th century which grew in popularity throughout the 19th century, contrasted Neoclassicism. Whilst Neoclassicism was characterized by Greek and Roman-influenced styles, geometric lines and order, Gothic revival architecture placed an emphasis on medieval-looking buildings, often made to have a rustic, "romantic" appearance.

==Neoclassical gardens==
In England, Augustan literature had a direct parallel with the Augustan style of landscape design. The links are clearly seen in the work of [[Alexander Pope]]. The best surviving examples of Neoclassical English gardens are [[Chiswick House]], [[Stowe House]] and [[Stourhead]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Turner|first=Turner|title=British gardens: history, philosophy and design, Chapter 6 Neoclassical gardens and landscapes 1730-1800|year=2013|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=978-0415518789|pages=456}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neoclassicism and fashion==

In fashion, Neoclassicism influenced the much greater simplicity of women's dresses, and the long-lasting fashion for white, from well before the French Revolution, but it was not until after it that thorough-going attempts to imitate ancient styles became fashionable in France, at least for women. Classical costumes had long been worn by fashionable ladies posing as some figure from Greek or Roman myth in a portrait (in particular there was a rash of such portraits of the young model [[Emma, Lady Hamilton]] from the 1780s), but such costumes were only worn for the portrait sitting and [[masquerade ball]]s until the Revolutionary period, and perhaps, like other exotic styles, as undress at home. But the styles worn in portraits by [[Juliette Récamier]], [[Joséphine de Beauharnais]], [[Thérésa Tallien]] and other Parisian trend-setters were for going-out in public as well. Seeing Mme Tallien at the opera, [[Charles Maurice de Talleyrand|Talleyrand]] quipped that: "''Il n'est pas possible de s'exposer plus somptueusement!''" ("One could not be more sumptuously undressed"). In 1788, just before the Revolution, the court portraitist [[Louise Élisabeth Vigée Le Brun]] had held a Greek supper where the ladies wore plain white Grecian tunics.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244&lt;/ref&gt; Shorter classical hairstyles, where possible with curls, were less controversial and very widely adopted, and hair was now uncovered even outdoors; except for evening dress, [[bonnet (headgear)|bonnet]]s or other coverings had typically been worn even indoors before. Thin Greek-style ribbons or fillets were used to tie or decorate the hair instead.

Very light and loose dresses, usually white and often with shockingly bare arms, rose sheer from the ankle to just below the bodice, where there was a strongly emphasized thin hem or tie round the body, often in a different colour. The shape is now often known as the [[Empire silhouette]] although it predates the [[First French Empire]] of Napoleon, but his first Empress Joséphine de Beauharnais was influential in spreading it around Europe. A long rectangular shawl or wrap, very often plain red but with a decorated border in portraits, helped in colder weather, and was apparently laid around the midriff when seated—for which sprawling semi-recumbent postures were favoured.&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;  By the start of the 19th century, such styles had spread widely across Europe.

Neoclassical fashion for men was far more problematic, and never really took off other than for hair, where it played an important role in the shorter styles that finally despatched the use of wigs, and then white hair-powder, for younger men. The trouser had been the symbol of the barbarian to the Greeks and Romans, but outside the painter's or, especially, the sculptor's studio, few men were prepared to abandon it. Indeed, the period saw the triumph of the pure trouser, or [[trousers|pantaloon]], over the ''cullottes'' or [[knee-breeches]] of the [[Ancien Régime]]. Even when David designed a new French "national costume" at the request of the government during the height of the Revolutionary enthusiasm for changing everything in 1792, it included fairly tight leggings under a coat that stopped above the knee. A high proportion of well-to-do young men spent much of the key period in military service because of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]], and military uniform, which began to emphasize jackets that were short at the front, giving a full view of tight-fitting trousers, was often worn when not on duty, and influenced cilivian male styles.

The trouser-problem had been recognised by artists as a barrier to creating contemporary [[history painting]]s; like other elements of contemporary dress they were seen as irredeemably ugly and unheroic by many artists and critics. Various strategems were used to avoid depicting them in modern scenes. In ''[[James Dawkins (antiquarian)|James Dawkins]] and [[Robert Wood (antiquarian)|Robert Wood]] Discovering the Ruins of [[Palmyra]]'' (1758) by [[Gavin Hamilton (artist)|Gavin Hamilton]], the two gentleman antiquaries are shown in [[toga]]-like Arab robes.  In ''[[Watson and the Shark]]'' (1778) by [[John Singleton Copley]], the main figure could plausibly be shown nude, and the composition is such that of the eight other men shown, only one shows a single [[breeches|breeched]] leg prominently.  However the Americans Copley and [[Benjamin West]] led the artists who successfully showed that trousers could be used in heroic scenes, with works like West's ''[[The Death of General Wolfe]]'' (1770) and Copley's ''[[The Death of Major Peirson, 6 January 1781]]'' (1783), although the trouser was still being carefully avoided in ''[[The Raft of the Medusa]]'', completed in 1819.

Classically inspired male hair styles included the [[Bedford Crop]], arguably the precursor of most plain modern male styles, which was invented by the radical politician [[Francis Russell, 5th Duke of Bedford]] as a protest against a [[Duty on Hair Powder Act 1795|tax on hair powder]]; he encouraged his friends to adopt it by betting them they would not. Another influential style (or group of styles) was named by the French "à la Titus" after [[Titus Junius Brutus]] (not in fact the Roman Emperor [[Titus]] as often assumed), with hair short and layered but somewhat piled up on the crown, often with restrained quiffs or locks hanging down; variants are familiar from the hair of both [[Napoleon]] and [[George IV of England]]. The style was supposed to have been introduced by the actor [[François-Joseph Talma]], who upstaged his wigged co-actors when appearing in productions of works such as [[Voltaire]]'s ''[[Brutus (tragedy)|Brutus]]'' (about [[Lucius Junius Brutus]], who orders the execution of his son Titus).  In 1799 a Parisian fashion magazine reported that even bald men were adopting Titus wigs,&lt;ref&gt;Hunt, 243&lt;/ref&gt; and the style was also worn by women, the ''[[Journal de Paris]]'' reporting in 1802 that "more than half of elegant women were wearing their hair or wig ''à la Titus''.&lt;ref&gt;Rifelj, 35&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later "Neoclassicisms"==
[[File:NatGal.jpg|thumb|The West building (1941) of the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, with the East Building (1978) and the [[United States Capitol]] visible behind and to the left]]
{{Classicism}}
In American architecture, Neoclassicism was one expression of the [[American Renaissance]] movement, ''ca.'' 1890–1917; its last manifestation was in [[Beaux-Arts architecture]], and its very last, large public projects were the [[Lincoln Memorial]] (highly criticized at the time), the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, D.C. (also heavily criticized by the architectural community as being backward thinking and old fashioned in its design), and the [[American Museum of Natural History]]'s Roosevelt Memorial. These were considered stylistic anachronisms when they were finished. In the British Raj, Sir [[Edwin Lutyens]]' monumental city planning for [[New Delhi]] marks the glorious sunset of Neoclassicism. World War II was to shatter most longing for (and imitation of) mythical, heroic times.

Conservative [[modernist]] architects such as [[Auguste Perret]] in France kept the rhythms and spacing of columnar architecture even in factory buildings. Where a [[colonnade]] would have been decried as "reactionary", a building's [[pilaster]]-like [[fluting (architecture)|fluted]] panels under a repeating [[frieze]] looked "progressive". [[Pablo Picasso]] experimented with classicizing motifs in the years immediately following [[World War I]], and the [[Art Deco]] style that came to the fore following the 1925 Paris ''Exposition des Arts Décoratifs'', often drew on Neoclassical motifs without expressing them overtly: severe, blocky [[commode]]s by [[Émile-Jacques Ruhlmann|É.-J. Ruhlmann]] or [[Louis Süe|Süe]] &amp; [[André Mare|Mare]]; crisp, extremely low-relief friezes of damsels and gazelles in every medium; fashionable dresses that were draped or cut on the bias to recreate Grecian lines; the art dance of [[Isadora Duncan]]; the [[Streamline Moderne]] styling of U.S. post offices and county court buildings built as late as 1950; and the [[Dime (United States coin)|Roosevelt dime]].

There was an entire 20th-century movement in the Arts which was also called Neo-classicism. It encompassed at least music, philosophy and literature. It was between the end of World War I and the end of World War II. (For information on the musical aspects, see [[20th century classical music#Neoclassicism|20th-century classical music]] and [[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]]. For information on the philosophical aspects, see [[Great Books]].)

This literary Neoclassical movement rejected the extreme romanticism of (for example) [[Dada]], in favour of restraint, religion (specifically Christianity) and a reactionary political program. Although the foundations for this movement in [[English literature]] were laid by [[T. E. Hulme]], the most famous Neoclassicists were [[T. S. Eliot]] and [[Wyndham Lewis]]. In Russia, the movement crystallized as early as 1910 under the name of [[Acmeism]], with [[Anna Akhmatova]] and [[Osip Mandelshtam]] as the leading representatives.

===In music===
[[Neoclassicism (music)|Neoclassicism in music]] is a 20th-century movement; in this case it is the [[classical music | Classical]] and [[baroque music | Baroque]] musical styles of the 17th and 18th centuries, with their fondness for Greek and Roman themes, that were being revived, not the music of the ancient world itself. (The early 20th century had not yet distinguished the Baroque period in music, on which Neoclassical composers mainly drew, from what we now call the Classical period.) The movement was a reaction  in the first part of the 20th century to the disintegrating chromaticism of late-Romanticism and Impressionism, emerging in parallel with musical Modernism, which sought to abandon key tonality altogether. It manifested a desire for cleanness and simplicity of style, which allowed for quite dissonant paraphrasing of classical procedures, but sought to blow away the cobwebs of Romanticism and the twilit glimmerings of [[Impressionism in music | Impressionism]] in favour of bold rhythms, assertive harmony and clean-cut sectional forms, coinciding with the vogue for reconstructed "classical" dancing and costume in [[ballet]] and [[physical education]]. 

The 17th-18th century dance suite had had a minor revival before [[World War I]] but the Neoclassicists were not altogether happy with unmodified diatonicism, and tended to emphasise the bright dissonance of suspensions and ornaments, the angular qualities of 17th-century modal harmony and the energetic lines of countrapuntal part-writing. [[Respighi, Ottorino | Respighi's]] ''Ancient Airs and Dances'' (1917) led the way for the sort of sound the Neoclassicists aspired to. Although the practice of borrowing musical styles from the past has not been uncommon throughout musical history, art musics have gone through periods where musicians used modern techniques coupled with older forms or harmonies to create new kinds of works. Notable compositional characteristics are: referencing diatonic tonality, conventional forms (dance suites, concerti grossi, sonata forms, etc.), the idea of absolute music untramelled by descriptive or emotive associations, the use of light musical textures, and a conciseness of musical expression. In classical music, this was most notably perceived between the 1920s and the 1950s. [[Igor Stravinsky]] is the best-known composer using this style; he effectively began the musical revolution with his Bach-like [[Octet (Stravinsky)|Octet for Wind Instruments]] (1923). A particular individual work that represents this style well is [[Sergei Prokofiev|Prokofiev]]'s [[Classical Symphony]] No. 1 in D, which is reminiscent of the symphonic style of [[Joseph Haydn|Haydn]] or [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]. [[Neoclassical ballet]] as innovated by [[George Balanchine]]  de-cluttered the Russian Imperial style in terms of costume, steps and narrative, while also introducing technical innovations.

=== Architecture in Russia and the Soviet Union ===
[[File:Ostdv5.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ostankino Palace]], designed by [[Francesco Camporesi]] and completed in 1798, in Moscow, Russia]]
In 1905–1914 Russian architecture passed through a brief but influential period of [[Russian neoclassical revival|Neoclassical revival]]; the trend began with recreation of Empire style of [[Alexander I of Russia|alexandrine]] period and quickly expanded into a variety of neo-[[Renaissance]], [[palladian architecture|palladian]] and modernized, yet recognizably classical schools. They were led by architects born in the 1870s, who reached creative peak before World War I, like [[Ivan Fomin]], [[Vladimir Shchuko]] and [[Ivan Zholtovsky]]. When economy recovered in the 1920s, these architects and their followers continued working in primarily [[modernism (architecture)|modernist]] environment; some (Zholtovsky) strictly followed the classical canon, others (Fomin, Schuko, [[Ilya Golosov]]) developed their own modernized styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=ft1g5004bj&amp;brand=eschol |title=The Origins of Modernism in Russian Architecture |publisher=Content.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2012-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arkhangelskoe Estate Aug2012 buildings 03.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Arkhangelskoye estate]].]]

With the crackdown on architects' independence and official denial of modernism (1932), demonstrated by the international contest for the [[Palace of Soviets]], Neoclassicism was instantly promoted as one of the choices in [[Stalinist architecture]], although not the only one. It coexisted with moderately modernist architecture of [[Boris Iofan]], bordering with contemporary [[Art Deco]] (Schuko); again, the purest examples of the style were produced by Zholtovsky school that remained an isolated phenomena. The political intervention was a disaster for [[Constructivist architecture|constructivist]] leaders yet was sincerely welcomed by architects of the classical schools.

Neoclassicism was an easy choice for the USSR since it did not rely on modern construction technologies ([[steel frame]] or [[reinforced concrete]]) and could be reproduced in traditional [[masonry]]. Thus the designs of Zholtovsky, Fomin and other old masters were easily replicated in remote towns under strict material [[rationing]]. Improvement of construction technology after World War II permitted Stalinist architects to venture into skyscraper construction, although stylistically these skyscrapers (including "exported" architecture of [[Palace of Culture and Science]], [[Warsaw]] and the [[Shanghai]] International Convention Centre) share little with the classical models. Neoclassicism and neo-Renaissance persisted in less demanding residential and office projects until 1955, when [[Nikita Khrushchev]] put an end to expensive Stalinist architecture.

===Architecture in the 21st century===
{{Main|New Classical Architecture}}
[[File:Schermerhorn.jpg|thumb|right|[[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]], 2006]]

After a lull during the period of modern architectural dominance (roughly post-World War II until the mid-1980s), Neoclassicism has seen something of a resurgence.

As of the first decade of the 21st century, contemporary Neoclassical architecture is usually classed under the umbrella term of [[New Classical Architecture]]. Sometimes it is also referred to as Neo-Historicism or Traditionalism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://arch-tour.blogspot.com/2009/03/neo-classicist-architecture.html Neo-classicist Architecture. Traditionalism. Historicism.]&lt;/ref&gt; Also, a number of pieces of [[postmodern architecture]] draw inspiration from and include explicit references to Neoclassicism, [[Antigone District]] and the [[National Theatre of Catalonia]] in [[Barcelona]] among them. [[Postmodern architecture]] occasionally includes historical elements, like columns, capitals or the tympanum.

For sincere traditional-style architecture that sticks to regional architecture, materials and craftsmanship, the term [[Vernacular architecture|Traditional Architecture]] (or vernacular) is mostly used. The [[Driehaus Architecture Prize]] is awarded to major contributors in the field of 21st century traditional or classical architecture, and comes with a prize money twice as high as that of the modernist [[Pritzker Prize]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://architecture.nd.edu/about/driehaus-prize/ Driehaus Prize for New Classical Architecture at Notre Dame SoA] – ''Together, the $200,000 Driehaus Prize and the $50,000 Reed Award represent the most significant recognition for classicism in the contemporary built environment.''; retained March 7, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, various contemporary public buildings are built in Neoclassical style, with the 2006 [[Schermerhorn Symphony Center]] in [[Nashville]] being an example.

In Britain, a number of architects are active in the Neoclassical style. Examples of their work include two university libraries: [[Quinlan Terry]]'s Maitland Robinson Library at [[Downing College]] and Robert Adam Architects' [[Sackler Library]].

'''Ocotelolco''' (sometimes spelled '''Ocotelulco'''), in pre-Columbian [[Mexico]], was one of the four independent [[altepetl]] (polities) that constituted the confederation of [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcallan]]. The site is in the present day state of [[Tlaxcala]] in central [[Mexico]].

==History==
Ocotelolco was the second of the four altepetl to be founded. At the time of the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico]] it was, along with [[Tizatlan (Altepetl)|Tizatlan]], the most powerful of the four allied communities. Where Ocotelolco held the economical power, having the main market in the region, Tizatlan had the military power and commanded the Tlaxcallan armies. 

When the Spanish arrived in Mexico Ocotelolco was ruled by [[Maxixcatzin]]. Through a series of political events Ocotelolco finally achieved dominance over Tizatlan at the end of the conquest.

'''Reinhard Rudolf Karl Hartmann''' is a [[lexicography|lexicographer]] and [[applied linguistics|applied linguist]]. Until the 1970s, [[lexicographers]] worked in relative isolation, and Hartmann is credited with making a major contribution to lexicography&lt;ref&gt;Robert Burchfield (1989) in the Foreword of the Festschrift issued on the occasion of the 15th anniversary of the Exeter University Language Centre and the 5th of the Dictionary Research Centre as well as Hartmann's 50th birthday, ''Lexicographers and their Works'' ed. by G. James (Volume 14, Exeter Linguistic Studies, University of Exeter Press) p. vii.&lt;/ref&gt; and fostering interdisciplinary consultation between reference specialists.&lt;ref&gt;Terry C. Falla (2005) "A conceptual framework for a new Comprehensive Syriac–English Lexicon" in ''Foundations for Syriac Lexicography: Proceedings of the First International Syriac Language Project Meeting'' ed. by B. Turner (Cambridge: Gorgias Press) p. 65, n. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

R.R.K. Hartmann is co-author of the standard texts ''Dictionary of Language and Linguistics'' (1972) and the ''Dictionary of Lexicography'' (1998); the former has been translated into Chinese, the latter into Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;The Literati Club/Reference Reviews 1999 award for excellence as 'best specialist reference work' was given to the editors of the ''Dictionary of Lexicography''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hartmann has also produced works on a wide range of linguistic and lexicographic topics (see list of Publications below). Two selections of his essays have been published in Kuwait (2004) and Germany (2007).

==Career==
Reinhard Hartmann was born on 8 April 1938 in [[Vienna]], [[Austria]], as the son of Walther and Gerta Hartmann. He obtained a degree at the [[Vienna University of Economics and Business Administration]], where he later wrote a doctoral dissertation on public economy control and auditing, studied at the [[University of Vienna]], where he was awarded a diploma in English translation, and was a postgraduate student at [[Southern Illinois University]], where he received an M.A. in international economics.

In 1964, Hartmann moved to Manchester where he married Lynn Warren and where their children Nasim and Stefan were born. He started his career with an appointment as lecturer in modern languages at the [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]]. This was followed in 1968 by a lectureship in applied linguistics at the [[University of Nottingham]]. From 1974 onwards, Hartmann held senior posts in the Language Centre and the School of English at the [[University of Exeter]], where he also organised a number of influential conferences, such as ''LEXeter ’83'' which led to the creation of the ''European Association of Lexicography'' (EURALEX), the ''International Journal of Lexicography'' and the book series ''Lexicographica Series Maior'' (of which he was one of the co-editors from 1984 to 2008, during which period 134 volumes were published). He attended 12 of the 13 biennial congresses that have been held since 1983, contributing papers at half of them and acting as first secretary and fourth president.&lt;ref&gt;He has been given honorary life membership for his services to EURALEX.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hartmann has also been involved in the founding of AFRILEX (Johannesburg 1995) and ASIALEX (Hong Kong 1997). Other conferences he hosted at Exeter include one on the history of lexicography (Hartmann 1986), which demonstrated that lexicographic traditions differ considerably by dictionary types and languages, and one on lexicography in Africa (Hartmann 1990).  He has acted as a consultant to a number of bodies,&lt;ref&gt;E.g. research councils such as the National Endowment for the Humanities and the British Council, publishers such as Oxford U.P. and Benjamins, and selection panels for conferences such as EURALEX congresses.&lt;/ref&gt; received a number of grants and fellowships to spend time abroad&lt;ref&gt;Visiting fellowships held at the Humanities Research Centre of the ANU in Canberra (1977), the State University of New York at Binghamton (1985), the University of Waterloo (Ontario) Centre for the New OED (1985), the European Translation Centre at Straelen and the Institut fuer deutsche Sprache in Mannheim (1986), the School of English and Linguistics at Macquarie University in Sydney (1994), the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (1997), and the China Foreign Affairs University in Beijing (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; and to participate in various initiatives to promote the discipline.&lt;ref&gt;ERASMUS grant 1990/1991 to start M.A. programmes in lexicography at various universities in Europe; Thematic Network Project in the Area of Languages with a Sub-project on Dictionaries in Language Learning in Europe (Hartmann 1999).&lt;/ref&gt; He also welcomed several visiting scholars for periods at Exeter University.&lt;ref&gt;The list includes Alan Kirkness (New Zealand), Colin Yallop (Australia), Rufus Gouws (South Africa), Olga Karpova (Russia), Alan Turney, Isamu Hayakawa and Masaaki Ohsugi (Japan), Xiaojun Heng and Jianping Wu (China).&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements have been recorded in several international directories,&lt;ref&gt;The ''Linguisten-Handbuch'' (1994), the ''Kenkyusha Biographical Dictionary of English Linguistics and Philology'' (1995), the ''International Who's Who in Translation and Terminology'' (1995), the ''Who's Who in Lexicography'' (1996), and the ''Dictionary of International Biography'' (34th edition 2007).&lt;/ref&gt; and he is a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts and of the Chartered Institute of Linguists.

While at Exeter, Hartmann supervised over 45 M.A. and 30 Ph.D. dissertations,&lt;ref&gt;Some of these Exeter postgraduates have moved on to make an impact on their respective specialisms and countries, notably Fred Weeks, Jon Mills, Mersedeh Proctor and Martin Stark (UK), Peter Sharpe (UK and Japan), Gregory James, Philip Benson, Li Lan, Tan Zaixi and Jacqueline Lam (UK and Hong Kong), [[Barbara Kipfer]] (USA), Evanthia Tsiouris and Agapios Oikonomidis (Greece), Ibrahim Al-Besbasi (Libya), Turki Diab (UAE), Nazih Kassis (Israel), Takashi Kanazashi, Kusujiro Miyoshi and Yuri Komuro (Japan), and Young-kuk Jeong (Korea).&lt;/ref&gt; specialising on such aspects as [[dictionary criticism]] (evaluating their many different features), [[dictionary history]] (tracing their varying traditions), [[dictionary typology]] (classifying their different genres), [[dictionary use]] (observing the reference skills needed to access information), [[contrastive linguistics]], [[translation]] and [[bilingual lexicography]].

Upon his retirement in 2001, the Dictionary Research Centre that Hartmann had established at the [[University of Exeter]] was transferred to the [[University of Birmingham]] where he was awarded the title of Honorary Professor of Lexicography in the School of English. Since 2007, Hartmann has been consolidating his various lists of conferences, institutions, dictionary projects, dissertations, and periodicals into an International Directory of Lexicography Institutions.

{{Contract law}}

A '''retainer agreement''' is a [[work for hire]] [[contract]]. It falls between a [[one-off]] contract and [[permanent employment]], which may be [[full-time]] or [[part-time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Waters|first1=Erika|title=How to Do a Retainer Agreement|url=http://smallbusiness.chron.com/retainer-agreement-43296.html|website=Texas Chronicle|publisher=[[Hearst Newspapers, LLC]]|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its distinguishing feature is that the client or [[customer]] pays in advance for [[professional]] work to be specified later. The purpose of a retainer fee is to ensure payment for future services or work to be rendered.

A retainer agreement may incorporate other contractual provisions regarding the performance of services, or the parties may potentially enter into additional contracts that define the other terms of their working relationship. A retainer fee may be paid on a fixed, pre-negotiated rate or on a variable hourly rate depending on the nature of retainer and also, the practice of the professional being retained.

==Legal services==
It is common for a person seeking the services of a [[lawyer]] (attorney) to pay a retainer ("retainer fee") to the lawyer, to see a case through to its conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retainer|url=http://legal-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/retainer|website=The Free Dictionary|publisher=Farlex, Inc.|accessdate=26 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A retainer can be a single advance payment or a recurring (e.g. monthly) payment.&lt;ref name="ell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Lawyer Fee Agreements and Retainers|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/consumer-protection/lawyer-fee-agreements-and-retainers|website=ExpertLaw.com|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=19 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Absent an agreement to the contrary, a retainer fee is refundable if the work is not performed.&lt;ref name="ell"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lane|first1=Mary|title=Retaining the professional retainer when the client is in financial distress|url=https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=df17b6c0-5d8e-462c-a138-accf76dcaaf8|website=Lexology|accessdate=26 September 2017|date=29 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The retainer agreement may serve as the basis of authority for a legal advocate. It may limit a lawyer's authority to specific tasks or services, as opposed to providing authority for general purposes. For example, if a lawyer is hired for purposes of litigation, during litigation the advocate will normally be authorized by the client to accept service of documents for which personal service upon the client is not required. In addition to being formally described in a retainer agreement, a client's grant of authority to an attorney may be implied, apparent or usual through the normal practice of the legal professional in providing representation to a client.&lt;ref&gt;See Watts v The Official Solicitor 1936 1 All ER 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7303">'''Robert Burnett Hall''' (July 18, 1896 - April 4, 1975), born in [[Espanola, New Mexico]], was an American geographer known for his work on Japan. He taught for most of his career at [[University of Michigan, Ann Arbor]].

==Honors and positions==
The Japanese government conferred on him the [[Order of the Rising Sun]], and the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]], the highest decoration granted to a foreigner by Japan. He was one of seven foreign geographers, and the only American, honored by the Silver Medal of the [[Tokyo Geographical Society]]. He served in Japan as the representative of the [[Asia Foundation]] 1955- 1960, and founding director of University of Michigan Center for Japanese Studies, 1947-1957.{{sfnb|GoslingKish|2011}} He received the "Meritorious Contribution" award from the [[Association of American Geographers]] in   1956.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aag.org/cs/honors Honors of the Association of American Geographers]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and academic career==
Hall joined the United States Army in 1913 and rose to the rank of Captain as an intelligence officer in France during [[World War I]]. After the  war, he became a student at the University of Michigan in 1920, where he obtained his Bachelor's, Master's and in 1927 Doctor's degree in the Department of Geography. His doctoral thesis was based on field work in Haiti. He became Instructor in 1923, the year the Department attained independent status, and was promoted to Professor in 1938.{{sfnb|GoslingKish|2011}}

In 1928 Hall did his first field work in Japan. When the Second World War began, Hall was studying the Japanese immigrants who had gone to Latin America. He was commissioned a Lieutenant-Colonel in the United States Army, directing operations of the [[Office of Strategic Services]], first on the Pacific Coast, later in the China-India theater, where he was promoted to the rank of Colonel {{sfnb|GoslingKish|2011}}

Following the war he returned to University of Michigan. He was president of the [[Association for Asian Studies]] in 1951 and served for many years on the board of the [[Social Science Research Council]], including several years as chairman. The fifteen students he directed in their doctoral work chose Japan as the subject of their theses.{{sfnb|GoslingKish|2011}}

==Building Area Studies==
Hall worked to develop the interdisciplinary study of Asia through the [[Area Studies]] approach, both at [[University of Michigan]] and through the Association for Asian Studies and the Social Science Research Council.  When he was appointed Director of the Center for Japanese Studies in 1947, he made clear that his policy was that the Center would train students in an additional strength, not one which would be an alternative to training in a discipline and that Area Studies would not drain students away from the established departments. The Center's executive committee included members from the departments of Anthropology, Fine Arts, Economics, and the Oriental Studies Program.{{sfnb|Center for Japanese Studies|2013}}

Hall's study, ''Area Studies: With Special Reference to Their Implications for Research in the Social Sciences'', published in 1947 for the SSRC, drew up the arguments in favor of the approach in order to organize government and foundation support.{{sfnb|Hall|1947}}

The Center established a research program in [[Okayama]], Japan, in 1950. The program was partly made possible when Hall met directly with  [[Douglas MacArthur]], head of the American Occupation of Japan. He later received a telegram from the General saying that the project "appears to be boldly planned and soundly conceived" and should "result in a body of knowledge which will prove of inestimable value..." Hall stayed in Japan as representative of the Asia Foundation until 1960.{{sfnb|Center for Japanese Studies|2013}}

After spending part of his [[national service]] from 1949 to 1950 in [[Egypt]] and [[Jordan]] as a second lieutenant in the Royal Tank Regiment, he went up to [[Keble College, Oxford|Keble College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] to read [[Philosophy, Politics and Economics]], obtaining a BA in 1953. He then went on to obtain a master's degree from [[Harvard University]] in Far Eastern Regional Studies in 1955, studying with [[John King Fairbank]], who supported his career as a China scholar.

He worked as a journalist on the staff of the ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Sunday Telegraph]]'' from 1955 to 1961 specialising in China, and also reported for [[BBC]] television ''[[Panorama (TV series)|Panorama]]'' from 1963 to 1965. He was editor of ''[[The China Quarterly]]'' from 1959 to 1968, and a non-resident fellow of [[St Antony's College, Oxford]] from 1965 to 1968. In 1969 he was a senior research fellow at [[Columbia University]] in [[New York City]], and in 1971 he returned to England to hold a similar fellowship at the [[Chatham House|Royal Institute of International Affairs]]. He was also the founding co-presenter of [[BBC World Service]] "24 Hours" in 1971.

==Political career==
In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1966|1966 general election]], MacFarquhar fought the [[Ealing South (UK Parliament constituency)|Ealing South]] constituency for the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] but failed to dislodge the sitting [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] MP. Two years later, he was Labour candidate who attempted to retain the [[Meriden (UK Parliament constituency)|Meriden]] seat in a [[Meriden by-election, 1968|by-election]]; he was on the wrong end of an 18.4% [[swing (politics)|swing]] at the height of the [[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] government's unpopularity.

Following the defeat of [[George Brown, Baron George-Brown|George Brown]] in 1970 and favourable boundary changes, MacFarquhar was selected to fight the [[Belper (UK Parliament constituency)|Belper]] constituency, and at the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February 1974 general election]] succeeded in winning the seat from its sitting Conservative MP [[Geoffrey Stewart-Smith]]. Although he won, there was an estimated swing of 4% to the Conservatives had the same boundaries applied in the previous election.

MacFarquhar proved a moderate figure, in line with Brown's views. He abstained on a vote to remove the disqualification of left-wing Labour councillors in [[Clay Cross]] who had broken council housing laws enacted by the previous Conservative government. However, there were exceptions: he also abstained on a vote to increase the [[Civil list]] payments on 26 February 1975. He acted as [[Parliamentary Private Secretary]] (PPS) to [[David Ennals]], a minister of the state at the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]], and retained the job when Ennals was promoted to be [[Secretary of State for Social Services]]. He was made a member of the Select Committee on Science and Technology.

==After Parliament==
In 1978 MacFarquhar resigned his office as PPS after voting against the Government.  In that year, he became a Governor of the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]], a [[University of London]] constituent body. The post gave him a job which he could do if he lost his seat. In the [[United Kingdom general election, 1979|1979 general election]], MacFarquhar did indeed lose by 800 votes, and returned to academia and broadcasting (returning to "24 Hours" for a year).

He remained involved in politics and his moderate beliefs made him increasingly uncomfortable in the Labour Party: on 22 October 1981 he announced that he had joined the [[Social Democratic Party (UK)|Social Democratic Party]]. He fought the [[South Derbyshire (UK Parliament constituency)|South Derbyshire]] seat, which contained most of then-abolished Belper, for the SDP in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1983|1983 general election]], and nearly succeeded in beating the Labour candidate, although the seat was easily won by the Conservatives.

==Subsequent academic career==
&lt;!-- In 1981 he was awarded a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] by the University of London.  --&gt;He was a fellow of the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] in Washington D.C. in 1980-81 and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences since 1986. In 1980-1983, he was a Leverhulme Research Fellow from 1980 until 1983.

In 1986-1992, MacFarquhar was Director of the [[Fairbank Center for Chinese Studies]] at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref&gt;Suleski, Ronald Stanley. (2005). ''The Fairbank Center for East Asian Research at Harvard University,'' p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; He was a Walter Channing Cabot Fellow at Harvard in 1993-1994. He is the Leroy B. Williams Professor of History and Political Science, Emeritus.

He is a scholar of Chinese politics from the founding of the People's Republic through the Cultural Revolution. Volume three of his study ''The Origins of the Cultural Revolution: The Coming of the Cataclysm 1961-1966'' (1997) won the [[Joseph Levenson Book Prize]] for 1999.

'''Sanford Meisner''' (August 31, 1905 – February 2, 1997), also known as Sandy, was an American [[actor]] and acting teacher who developed an approach to acting instruction that is now known as the [[Meisner technique]].&lt;ref&gt;Krasner (2000, 142–146) and Postlewait (1998, 719).&lt;/ref&gt; While Meisner was exposed to [[method acting]] at the [[Group Theatre (New York City)|Group Theatre]], his approach differed markedly in that he completely abandoned the use of [[affective memory]], a distinct characteristic of method acting. Meisner maintained an emphasis on "the reality of doing", which was the foundation of his approach.&lt;ref&gt;Longwell, Meisner (1987, 9–10)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born in [[Brooklyn]], Meisner was the oldest child of Hermann Meisner, a [[Fur clothing#Processing of fur|furrier]], and Bertha Knoepfler, both [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[immigrant]]s who came to the United States from [[Hungary]].&lt;ref&gt;Jackson (2002).&lt;/ref&gt; His younger siblings were Jacob, Ruth, and Robert. To improve Sanford's health during his youth, his family took a trip to the [[Borscht Belt|Catskills]]. However, while there his brother Jacob contracted [[bovine]] [[tuberculosis]] from drinking [[unpasteurized]] milk and died shortly thereafter. In an interview many years later, Meisner later identified this event as "the dominant emotional influence in my life from which I have never, after all these years, escaped."&lt;ref&gt;Longwell and Meisner (1987, 5).&lt;/ref&gt; Blamed by his parents for Jacob's  death, the young Meisner became isolated and withdrawn, unable to cope with feelings of guilt for his brother's death.

He found release in playing the family [[piano]] and eventually attended the Damrosch Institute of Music (now the [[Juilliard School]]) where he studied to become a concert pianist. When the [[Great Depression]] hit, Meisner's father pulled him out of music school to help in the family business in New York City's [[Garment District, Manhattan|Garment District]]. Meisner later recalled that the only way he could endure days spent lugging bolts of fabric was to entertain himself by replaying, in his mind, all the classical piano pieces he had studied in music school. Meisner believed this experience helped him develop an acute sense of sound, akin to [[perfect pitch]]. Later, as an acting teacher, he often evaluated his students' scene work with his eyes closed (and his head dramatically buried in his hands). This trick was only partly for effect; the habit, he explained, actually helped him to listen more closely to his students' work and to pinpoint the true and false moments in their acting.

After graduation from high school, Meisner pursued acting professionally, which had interested him since his youth. He had acted at the [[Lower East Side]]'s [[Chrystie Street]] [[Settlement House]] under the direction of [[Lee Strasberg]], who was to play an important role in his development. At 19, Meisner heard that the [[Theatre Guild]] was hiring teenagers. After a brief interview, he was hired as an extra for ''They Knew What They Wanted''. The experience deeply affected him and he realized that acting was what he had been looking for in life. He and Strasberg both appeared in the original Theatre Guild production of the Rodgers and Hart review ''[[The Garrick Gaieties]]'', from which the song "Manhattan" came.

==Group Theatre==
[[File:Group-Theatre-1938.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Sanford Meisner (back row, fourth from left) with members of the Group Theatre in 1938]]
Despite his parents' misgivings, Meisner continued to pursue a career in acting, receiving a scholarship to study at the [[Theatre Guild|Theatre Guild of Acting]]. Here he encountered once again [[Harold Clurman]] and [[Lee Strasberg]]. Strasberg was to become another of the century's most influential acting theorists and the father of [[method acting]], an acting technique derived, like Meisner's own, from the [[Stanislavski's system|system]] of [[Konstantin Stanislavski]]. The three became friends. In 1931, Clurman, Strasberg, and Cheryl Crawford (another Theatre Guild member) selected 28 actors (one of whom was Meisner) to form the [[Group Theatre (New York City)|Group Theatre]]. This company exerted an influence on the entire art of acting in the United States. Meisner summered with the Group Theatre at their 1936 rehearsal headquarters at [[Pine Brook Country Club]] in the countryside of [[Nichols, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=xglC324UIUgC&amp;pg=PA153 ''Elia Kazan: A Life'', Elia Kazan, Da Capo Press, 1997, p. 153]&lt;/ref&gt;

Meisner, along with a number of other actors in the company, eventually resisted Strasberg's preoccupation with [[affective memory]] exercises. In 1934, fellow company member [[Stella Adler]] returned from private study with Stanislavski in Paris and announced that Stanislavski had come to believe that, as part of a rehearsal process, delving into one's past memories as a source of emotion was only a last resort and that the actor should seek rather to develop the character's thoughts and feelings through physical action, a concentrated use of the imagination, and a belief in the "given circumstances" of the text. As a result, Meisner began to focus on a new approach to the art of acting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cie-azot.com/stages-et-formations-1/m%C3%A9thode-meisner/|title=Compagnie AZOT - Méthode Meisner|website=www.cie-azot.com|language=fr|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

When the Group Theatre disbanded in 1940, Meisner continued as head of the acting program at the [[Neighborhood Playhouse]] in New York, at which he had taught since 1935.&lt;ref&gt;Postlewait (1998, 719).&lt;/ref&gt; In teaching he found a level of fulfillment similar to that which he had found in playing the piano as a child. At the Playhouse he developed his own form of method acting that was based on Stanislavski's system, Meisner's training with Lee Strasberg, and on Stella Adler's revelations about the uses of the imagination. Today that approach is called the [[Meisner technique]]. It was during these early years at The 
Neighborhood Playhouse that Meisner was briefly married to the young actress Peggy Meredith, who appeared in several Broadway productions.

The [[Actors Studio]] was founded in 1947 by two ex-Group Theatre actors [[Elia Kazan]] and [[Robert Lewis (director)|Robert Lewis]], and [[Cheryl Crawford]].  Strasberg initially had not been asked to join the group, while Meisner was among the first instructors to teach at the studio. However, by 1951, after Kazan moved to Hollywood to focus on his directorial career, Strasberg became the group's artistic director. In the following years, many students of the Actors Studio became well known in the film industry. Strasberg's later insistence that he had trained them distressed Meisner enormously, creating an animosity with his ex-mentor that continued until Strasberg's death.

==Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2016}}
In 1935, Meisner joined the faculty of The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre and continued as the Director of the Acting Department until his retirement in 1990, and served as Director Emeritus until his death in 1997. In 1928, The Neighborhood Playhouse School of the Theatre opened its doors. The first class of only nine students had the privilege of being taught by theatre luminaries [[Martha Graham]], [[Louis Horst]], [[Laura Elliott]], and [[Agnes de Mille]]. Over his years or teaching at the Playhouse, this founding member of The Group Theatre developed and refined what is now known as the Meisner Technique: "To live truthfully under given imaginary circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.meisnerinternational.com/what-is-meisner/ "What is Meisner"], Meisner International&lt;/ref&gt; The Meisner Technique is a step-by-step procedure of self-investigation for the actor now widely recognized as one of the foremost acting techniques taught today. 

Notable students and alumni of The Neighborhood Playhouse under Sanford Meisner's instruction include: [[Dylan McDermott]], [[James Caan]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Tony Randall]], [[Sydney Pollack]], [[David Mamet]], [[Connie Britton]], [[Brian Geraghty]], [[Leslie Moonves]], [[Sherie Rene Scott]], [[Chris Noth]], [[Tucker Smallwood]], [[Mary Steenburgen]], [[Betsy von Furstenberg]], [[Allison Janney]], [[Jennifer Grey]], [[Ashlie Atkinson]], [[Christopher Meloni]], [[Alex Cole Taylor]], and many more.

==Meisner/Carville School of Acting==
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2016}}
In 1983, Meisner and his life partner James Carville founded the Meisner/Carville School of Acting on the Caribbean island of [[Bequia]]. Students from all around the world came every summer to participate in a summer intensive with Meisner. The Meisner/Carville School of Acting operated on the island and, beginning in 1985, also in [[North Hollywood, Los Angeles|North Hollywood]]. Meisner split his time between the Neighborhood Playhouse in New York and the two school locations. In spring of 1995, The Meisner/Carville School of acting was then succeeded by [[The Sanford Meisner Center for the Arts]], a theater company and school in North Hollywood&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-05-30/entertainment/ca-10183_1_sanford-meisner-center|title=Sanford Meisner Center Adopts 'Think-Tank' Role|last=McCULLOH|first=T.

===Notable students===
{{refimprove section|date=August 2015}}
Throughout his career, Meisner worked with, and taught, students who became well known, such as [[Sandra Bullock]], [[David Duchovny]], [[James Franco]], [[Michelle Pfeiffer]], [[Naomi Watts]], [[Tom Cruise]], [[Alec Baldwin]], [[Jon Voight]], [[Dylan McDermott]], [[Eileen Fulton]], [[James Caan]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Gregory Peck]], [[Eli Wallach]], [[Jack Lord]], [[Bob Fosse]], [[Diane Keaton]], [[Robert Duvall]], [[Lee Grant]], [[Peter Falk]], [[Jeff Goldblum]], [[Grace Kelly]], [[James Doohan]], [[Tony Randall]] and [[Sydney Pollack]].  Pollack together with [[Charles E. Conrad]] served as Meisner's senior assistants. The technique is helpful not just for actors, but also for directors, writers, and teachers. A number of directors also studied with him, among them [[Sidney Lumet]] and [[John Frankenheimer]], and writers such as [[Arthur Miller]] and [[David Mamet]].

{{div col end}}

==Film and television appearances==
Though he rarely appeared on film, he performed in ''[[Tender Is the Night (film)|Tender Is the Night]]'', ''[[The Story on Page One (film)|The Story on Page One]]'', and ''[[Mikey and Nicky]]''. His last acting role was in the season one episode of the television medical drama ''[[ER (TV series)|ER]]'', "Sleepless in Chicago". Actor [[Noah Wyle]] worked with him and referred to the experience as the highlight of his career.

==Personal life and death==
Meisner's two marriages, to Peggy Meredith (née Meyer) and Betty Gooch, respectively, ended in divorce. Meisner, who was [[gay]], spent the remainder of his life with partner James Carville.

In 1970 Meisner was diagnosed with [[throat cancer]] and underwent a [[laryngectomy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.backstage.com/news/obituaries_78/ |title=Obituaries|website=backstage.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; After that operation he lived for nearly three more decades, until February 1997, when he died in his sleep at the age of 91 at his home in [[Sherman Oaks, Los Angeles]].

==The Meisner technique==
{{main article|Meisner technique}}
Meisner's unusual techniques were considered both unorthodox and effective. Actor Dennis Longwell wrote of sitting in on one of Meisner's classes one day, when Meisner brought two students forward for an acting exercise. They were given a single line of dialogue, told to turn away, and instructed not to do or say anything until something happened to make them say the words (one of the fundamental principles of the Meisner technique). The first student's line came when Meisner approached him from behind and gave him a strong pinch on the back, inspiring him to jump away and yelp his line in pain. The other student's line came when Meisner reached around and slipped his hand into her blouse. Her line came out as a giggle as she moved away from his touch.&lt;ref&gt;Longwell and Meisner (1987, 34).&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of the Meisner technique has often been described as getting actors to "live truthfully under imaginary circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;Silverberg (1994, 9).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dr. Sara C. Bisel''' (1932&amp;ndash;1996) was a physical [[anthropologist]] and classical [[archaeologist]] who played a prominent role in early scientific research at [[Herculaneum]], a Mediterranean coastal town destroyed by the 79 AD eruption of [[Mount Vesuvius]].  Her pioneering work in the chemical and physical analysis of skeletons yielded new insights into the nutrition and health of ancient populations.  This was considered ground-breaking and helped advance the field of [[paleodemography]].

== Life and work ==
Born Sara Louise Clark on May 13, 1932, in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]], Dr. Bisel grew up in western Pennsylvania. She graduated from [[Carnegie-Mellon University]] in Pittsburgh with a bachelor's degree in nutrition and biochemistry. She married [[Harry Bisel]], a [[Mayo Clinic]] medical oncologist, and lived in [[Rochester, Minnesota]] from 1963.

At the [[University of Minnesota]], she earned a master's degree in classical area studies, with a specialization in Greek archaeology, and a Ph.D. in physical anthropology.  She was awarded a fellowship by the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1977 and conducted independent research funded by the Smithsonian Institution and the [[National Geographic Society]] from 1981 to 1988. She was a Visiting Scientist at the Mayo Clinic, and a Research Associate and Fellow at the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

The author of numerous articles published in scholarly and professional journals, she taught at the University of Minnesota, the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and the [[American School of Classical Studies]] in Athens, Greece. She worked on various sites throughout [[Greece]], [[Turkey]], [[Israel]] and [[Italy]].

Her work at [[Herculaneum]] established her international reputation as an authority on ancient health and nutrition.

Sara Bisel died on 4 February 1996.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2112">'''Soil and grain''' (Chinese: [[wikt:社|社]][[wikt:稷|稷]] ''sheji''; Japanese: 社稷 ''shashoku'') was a common political term in East Asia for the [[State (polity)|state]]. Altars of soil and grain were constructed alongside ancestral altars. Local kings performed ceremonies of soil and grain to affirm their sovereignty at [[Beijing Shejitan]] and [[Seoul Sajiktan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8qvY8pxVxcwC&amp;pg=PA371&amp;dq=%22soil+and+grain%22&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_brr=0&amp;ei=pdgKS7jIO4mENt_D5K4P#v=onepage&amp;q=%22soil%20and%20grain%22&amp;f=false A comparative study of thirty city states]&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been rendered "gods of soil and grain" in English, owing to its associations of prayer and supernatural possibilities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zqdHRAY4hAUC&amp;pg=PA138&amp;lpg=PA138&amp;dq=%22gods+of+soil+and+grain%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZkKLiYIMJq&amp;sig=JcMKmqtfnB-o9yYsUn2ECcvcBcY&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Qt8KS63NGZGsMau_pcEK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22gods%20of%20soil%20and%20grain%22&amp;f=false Hymes: Way and Byway (Google Books)]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Warring States period]], ministers defied the emperor by claiming a greater loyalty to the "soil and grain".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zhpLJgHZMTQC&amp;pg=PA164&amp;dq=%E7%A4%BE%E7%A8%B7&amp;lr=lang_en&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=0 Envisioning eternal empire: Chinese political thought of the Warring States era]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fotothek df pk 0000130 005.jpg|thumb|A mower with a scythe cuts a swathe through the crop.]]
[[File:Swather.jpg|thumb|A mechanical swather]]
A '''swathe''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|eɪ|ð}}: rhymes with "bathe") or '''swath''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|w|ɒ|θ}}: rhymes with "cloth") is the width of a [[scythe]] stroke or a mowing-machine blade, the path of this width made in mowing or the mown grass or grain lying on such a path.
The mower with a scythe moves along the mowing-edge with the uncut grass to the right and the cut grass laid in a neat row to the left, on the previously mown land.  The swathe width depends on the blade length, the nature of the crop and the mower but is usually about 1.5 metres wide.  Mowing may be done by a team of mowers, usually starting at the edges of a [[meadow]] then proceeding clockwise leaving a series of staggered swathes and finishing in the middle.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.motherearthnews.com/homesteading-and-livestock/how-to-use-a-scythe-zmaz81mjzraw.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

The mower swings the scythe steadily in long, left handed arcs ending in front of the mower and depositing the cut grass neatly to the left.  The mower takes a small step forward and repeats the motion, proceeding with a steady rhythm, stopping at frequent intervals to hone the blade.  The correct technique has a slicing action on the grass, cutting a narrow strip, leaving a uniform [[crop residue|stubble]] on the ground and forming a regular [[windrow]] on the left.

The scythe has generally been replaced by machinery such as the [[swather]] pictured, or [[combine harvester]] which still leaves a swathe to its left but is very much wider than the scythe.  Early in the introduction of machinery it was still necessary for mowers with scythes to open up a swathe wide enough to take the machine before it could start

== Swath width ==

By analogy, '''Swath width''' also refers to the width of any repetitively cut or treated strip.  For example, the strip of the [[Earth]]’s surface from which geographic data are collected by a moving vehicle such as a [[satellite]], aircraft or ship in the course of swath mapping. The [[longitude|longitudinal]] extent of the swath is defined by the motion of the vehicle with respect to the surface, whereas the swath width is measured perpendicularly to the longitudinal extent of the swath. Note that swath width is also cited in the context of [[sonar]] specifications. It is measured and represented in metres or kilometres.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7924">{{Wiktionary|theme}}
In contemporary [[literary studies]], a '''theme''' is the central topic a text treats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation
| url = http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/200321?rskey=8toWeL&amp;result=1&amp;isAdvanced=false#eid
| title = Oxford English Dictionary
| work = 
| publisher = 
| accessdate = January 26, 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Themes  can be divided into two categories: a work's ''thematic concept'' is what readers "think the work is about" and its ''thematic statement'' being "what the work says about the subject".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Griffith| first = Kelley| title = Writing Essays about Literature| place = | publisher = Cengage Learning| year = 2010| edition = 8| page =40| language =| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=a05Efo1hOa4C&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=| isbn =1428290419| accessdate=  February 10, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common contemporary understanding of theme is an idea or point that is central to a story, which can often be summed in a single word (e.g. love, death, betrayal). Typical examples of themes of this type are conflict between the individual and society; coming of age; humans in conflict with technology; [[nostalgia]]; and the dangers of unchecked ambition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Kirszner| first = Laura G. | last2 =Mandell| first2 =Stephen R.| title = Fiction: Reading, Reacting, Writing| publisher =Paulinas| year =1994| pages =3–4| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=VzojstMHtY0C&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=| isbn =015501014X | accessdate=February 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{examples needed |date=March 2013}} A theme may be exemplified by the actions, utterances, or thoughts of a character in a novel. An example of this would be the thematic idea of loneliness in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'', wherein many of the characters seem to be lonely. It may differ from the thesis—the text's or author's implied worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Weitz| first = Morris| title = Shakespeare Survey| publisher =Cambridge University Press| volume = 28| year = 2002| chapter = Literature Without Philosophy: "Antony and Cleopatra"| page =30| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=-CdmtQURHc8C&amp;pg=PA30&amp;dq=| isbn =0521523656| accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{example needed | march 2013}}

A story may have several themes. Themes often explore historically common or cross-culturally recognizable ideas, such as ethical questions, and are usually implied rather than stated explicitly. An example of this would be whether one should live a seemingly better life, at the price of giving up parts of one's humanity, which is a theme in [[Aldous Huxley|Aldous Huxley’s]] ''Brave New World''. Along with [[Plot (narrative)|plot]], [[Character (arts)|character]], [[Setting (fiction)|setting]], and [[Style (fiction)|style]], theme is considered one of the [[literary element|components]] of [[fiction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Obstfeld|2002|pp=1,65,115,171}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Techniques==
Various [[Literary technique|techniques]] may be used to express many more themes.

===Leitwortstil===
''Leitwortstil'' is the repetition of a wording, often with a theme, in a narrative to make sure it catches the reader's attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last= Pinault| first= David| title= Story Telling Techniques in the "Arabian Nights"| publisher= Brill| series= Studies in Arabic Literature| volume= 15| year= 1992| page= 18| url= https://books.google.com/books?id=guHmLGJMbg4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq= | isbn= 9004095306 | accessdate= February 10, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of a leitwortstil is the recurring phrase, "So it goes", in [[Kurt Vonnegut]]'s novel ''[[Slaughterhouse-Five]]''. Its seeming message is that the world is [[deterministic]]: that things only could have happened in one way, and that the future already is predetermined. But given the anti-war tone of the story, the message perhaps is on the contrary, that ''things could have been different''. A non-fictional example of leitwortstil is in the book ''Too Soon Old, Too Late Smart: Thirty True Things You Need to Know Now'' written by Gordon Livingston, which is an anthology of personal anecdotes multiple times interjected by the phrases "Don't do the same thing and expect different results", "It is a bad idea to lie to yourself", and "No one likes to be told what to do".

===Thematic patterning===
''Thematic patterning'' means the insertion of a recurring motif in a narrative.&lt;ref&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 22. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, various scenes in [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Of Mice and Men]]'' are about loneliness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation| last = Scalia| first = Joseph E.| last2 =Shamblin| first2 =Lena T. &amp; Research and Education Association | title =  John Steinbeck's Of mice and men| place =Piscataway, N.J | publisher =Research &amp; Education Association | year =2001| page =13| url = https://books.google.com/books?id=96WfEbkKIKAC&amp;pg=PA85&amp;dq=| isbn =087891997X | accessdate= February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thematic patterning is evident in ''[[One Thousand and One Nights]]'',&lt;ref name="Heath"&gt;{{citation|first=Peter|last=Heath|title=Reviewed work(s) ''Story-Telling Techniques in the Arabian Nights'' by David Pinault|journal=[[International Journal of Middle East Studies]]|volume=26|issue=2|date=May 1994|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|pages=358–360 [359–60]|doi=10.1017/s0020743800060633}}&lt;/ref&gt; an example being the story of "The City of Brass". According to David Pinault, the overarching theme of that tale, in which a group of travelers roam the desert in search of ancient brass artifacts, is that "riches and pomp tempt one away from God".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"&gt;Pinault, David. 1992. ''Story-telling techniques in the Arabian nights''. Leiden: Brill. p. 23. {{ISBN|9004095306}}&lt;/ref&gt; The narrative is interrupted several times by stories within the story. These include a tale recorded in an inscription found in the palace of Kush ibh Shaddad; a story told by a prisoner about Solomon; and an episode involving Queen Tadmur's corpse. According to Pinault, "each of these minor narratives introduces a character who confesses that he once proudly enjoyed worldly prosperity: subsequently, we learn, the given character has been brought low by God ... These minor tales ultimately reinforce the theme of the major narrative".&lt;ref name="Pinault_23"/&gt;

== Examples ==
Some common themes in literature are "love," "war," "revenge," "betrayal,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Baldick|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; "patriotism," "grace," "isolation," "motherhood," "forgiveness," "wartime loss,"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Carey|Snodgrass|1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; "treachery," "rich versus poor," "appearance versus reality," and "help from other-worldly powers."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Brown|Rosenberg|1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''This Is Gonna Hurt''''' is the second [[studio album]] by [[Sixx:A.M.]], a side project of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]], released on May 3, 2011. Like the first album which served as a companion soundtrack to [[Nikki Sixx]]' first book ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', this album is a companion to the book of the same name, Sixx's second book, which was released on April 12, 2011. However, unlike its predecessor, this album does not contain any spoken word. [[Walmart]] refused to stock the album in stores because of the album's cover art, which features a heart with nails through it.

==Release==
The lead single from the album is "[[Lies of the Beautiful People]]" and was released on March 1, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eddietrunk.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/426828/pid/400512 Mötley Crüe's Nikki Sixx "This Is Gonna Hurt" To Be Released On April 12th] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710170520/http://www.eddietrunk.com/index.cfm/pk/view/cd/NAA/cdid/426828/pid/400512 |date=2011-07-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first single "Lies of the Beautiful People" premiered on Sixx's radio show website "Sixx Sense" on February 16, 2011, and went on sale on March 1.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120908005448/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=154081 BLABBERMOUTH.NET – SIXX: A.M.: 'Lies Of The Beautiful People' Video Released - Feb. 16, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; The album was released on May 10, 2011, after being pushed back from a March 22, 2011, release date.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=145540 BLABBERMOUTH.NET – NIKKI SIXX: New Book 'This Is Gonna Hurt' Tentatively Due In March - Sep. 4, 2010] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111121095726/http://www.roadrunnerrecords.com/blabbermouth.net/news.aspx?mode=Article&amp;newsitemID=145540 |date=2011-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thovarimala Ezhuthupara''' is a remotely located [[rock shelter]] in the [[Wayanad district]] of [[Kerala]] in [[India]].The rare historic treasure at Thovarimala near here, throwing light into human habitation. Pre-historic stone age petroglyphs dating from around 1000 BC and after had been discovered here at a height of 500&amp;nbsp;m on Thovarimala. One can see the new stone age rock engravings on the walls of these natural cave and pretty of nature from top of Thovarimala. The rare historic treasure at Thovarimala throwing light into human habitation in the Wayanad area since ancient times, is yet to receive the protection of agencies like Archaeology Department, which preserves the [[Edakkal Caves]] just five km away. The carvings, found on the upper side of the cave, depict few geometrical figures, an arrow, and one carving closely resembles a female genital organ.
Recently more writings were located in this cave. The name Ezhuthupara means, "writings on the stone."

{{Environmental law}}

The term ‘'''wild law'''’ was first coined by [[Cormac Cullinan]], to refer to human laws that are consistent with [[Earth jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discovering the meaning of Earth jurisprudence|publisher= Legalbrief |url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=2002082769459999|date= August 27, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; A wild law is a law made by people to regulate human behaviour that privileges maintaining the integrity and functioning of the whole Earth community in the long term, over the interests of any species (including humans) at a particular time.

==Background==

[[File:Amazon Rainforest-bird site.jpg|thumb|right|240px|[[Amazon Rainforest]] in Brazil.]]

Wild laws are designed to regulate human participation within this wider community.  They seek to balance the rights and responsibilities of humans against those of other members of the community of beings within the [[natural environment]] that constitutes Earth (e.g. [[plants]], animals, [[rivers]], and [[ecosystems]]) in order to safe-guard the rights of all the members of the Earth [[community]].

Wild laws may be distinguished from laws based on the understanding that Earth is a conglomeration of objects which human beings are entitled to exploit for their exclusive benefit (e.g. most property laws).  The development of wild laws is motivated partially by the belief that it is desirable, and essential to the survival of many species (probably including humans), for us to change our relationship with the natural world from one of exploitation to a more ‘democratic’ participation in a community of other beings.  This requires laws that firstly, recognise that other members of the Earth community have [[rights]], and secondly, restrain humans from unjustifiably infringing those rights (as is done within the human community).

==Applications and consensus==

As a field, wild law cannot easily be categorised within traditional legal categories (e.g. [[substantive law|substantive]], [[procedural law|procedural]], [[private law|private]] or [[public law]]).  It is perhaps better understood as an approach to [[good governance|human governance]], rather than as a branch of law or a collection of laws.

A conference based on the concept of wild law was held in November 2005 at the [[University of Brighton]], UK. The conference was chaired by former Environment Minister [[Michael Meacher]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and speakers included Jacqueline McGlade, head of the [[European Environment Agency]] and Lynda Warren of the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Former Environment Minister leads debate on 'Wild Law'|date=14 November 2005|url=http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2005/051114wildlaw.php?PageId=825|publisher=[[University of Brighton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2006, a conference based on the book ''Wild Law'' by Cormac Cullinan was held at the University of Brighton, UK, and organised jointly by [[UKELA]] and [[Environmental Law Foundation|ELF]]. 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law' and was chaired by John Elkington (of [[SustainAbility]] and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, [[Norman Baker]] MP (former [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] Environment Spokesman), [[Satish Kumar]] (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).

"A ‘Wild Law’ Response to Climate Change" workshop was held in September 2007 to develop a practical approach for applying Wild Law principles which are already helping shift legal processes in the US and South Africa.  Organised by [[UKELA]], with support from [[Environmental Law Foundation|ELF]] and the [[Gaia Foundation]], London and sponsored by [[The Body Shop]].  Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire in the UK, with internationally renowned speakers [[Cormac Cullinan]], author of ''Wild Law'', [[Brian Goodwin|Professor Brian Goodwin]], visiting scholar and teacher on MSc in Holistic Science, at the [[Schumacher College]], International Centre for Ecological Studies, Devon, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of The [[Center for Food Safety]] in USA and founder of the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]], Peter Roderick, director of the Climate Justice Programme and was [[Friends of the Earth]]'s lawyer in London from 1996.

The "’Wild Law’ - Ideas into Action" residential workshop is to be held in September 2008, to launch the first phase of international research by the [[UKELA]] and the [[Gaia Foundation]] to identify Wild Law in practice and provide a Wild Law toolkit for decision makers and practitioners. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire, UK, workshop leaders include: [[Mellese Damtie]], Ethiopian lawyer and biologist, former Dean of the Legal Department at Ethiopia's Civil Service College, [[Andrew Kimbrell]], public interest attorney, activist and author, executive director of the Centre for Food Safety in USA and founder of the [[International Centre for Technology Assessment]]; and [[Professor Lynda Warren]], emeritus professor at [[Aberystwyth University]], environmental consultant and the research supervisor. Also participating, research paper coordinators, Begonia Filgueira, of Gaia Law Ltd and ERIC Ltd, and Ian Mason, practising barrister and Director of the [[Earth Jurisprudence Resource Centre]]; [[Cormac Cullinan]], an environmental lawyer based in Cape Town, South Africa, author of ''Wild Law'', director of the leading South African environmental law firm, Cullinan and Associates Inc., and CEO of EnAct International, an environmental governance consultancy; and [[Ng’anga Thiong’o]], legal and policy adviser for Kenyan community NGO, [[Porini]], and formerly to Green Belt Movement and Nobel prize winner, [[Wangari Maathai]]. This event is facilitated by Elizabeth Rivers, former commercial lawyer and professional facilitator, and Vicki Elcoate, Executive Director of UKELA.
