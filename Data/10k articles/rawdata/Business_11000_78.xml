== History ==

=== Legal initial situation ===
Until introduction of ADHGB German commercial law reflected the political splintering of Germany.

==== Preußisches Allgemeines Landrecht ====
The [[General state laws for the Prussian states|Preußisches Allgemeines Landrecht]] (ALR) of 1794 (English ''Prussian General Land Law'') applied to Prussian state territory.
Legal provisions for burgher classes („Bürgerstände“) could be found in Eighth Title (''Achter Titel''). This comprised rules for craftsmen (''Handwerker'') (§§&amp;nbsp;179 to 400) in addition to these for artists and fabricants (''Künstler und Fabrikanten'') (§§&amp;nbsp;401 to 423) and for merchants (§§&amp;nbsp;475 to 712).
Here §§&amp;nbsp;475 bis 496 ALR defined characteristics of a merchant. §§&amp;nbsp;497 bis 545 ALR affected factors and [[dispatcher]]s (''Faktoren und Disponenten'') whereby [[procuration]] (''Prokura),'' a special power of attorney, could be found in §§&amp;nbsp;498 et seq. ALR.

§§&amp;nbsp;546 to 553 ALR dealt with merchant assistant and apprentices (''Handlungsdienern und Lehrlingen''), §§&amp;nbsp;562 to 613 ALR with trading books (''Handelsbücher'') and §§&amp;nbsp;614 to 683 ALR with companies (''Handlungsgesellschaften''). Mecantile interests (''Kaufmännische Zinsen'') werde regulated by §§&amp;nbsp;684 to 697 ALR, brokerages (''Provisionen'') by §§&amp;nbsp;698 to 701 ALR and merchant recommendations (''Kaufmännische Empfehlungen'') by §§&amp;nbsp;702 ti 712 ALR.

==== Code de commerce ====
In areas west of the Rhine and in [[Baden]] (as an annex to Badisches Landrecht (engl. ''Baden Land Law'') of 1810&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Hartmut Oetker, in:  Claus-Wilhelm Canaris, Mathias Habersack, Carsten Schäfer (Hrsg.) ''Staub HGB'', Bd. 1, 5. Aufl., 2009, Einleitung Rz. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;) French Code de commerce of 1808 ruled.

==== Particular law und Common law ====
Apart from that Particular law (''Patrikularrecht'') or subsidiary Common law, here [[Jus commune|ius commune]], (''Gemeines Recht'') were applied.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Thomas Henne: Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsgesetzbuch.igital (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Draft of 1849 ===
Preliminary works for ADHGB can be traced back to 1848/49. 
Already [[Paulskirche Constitution]] of 28 March 1849 provided in § 64 inter alia establishing a General Commercial Code. On 2 December 1848 a commission had started preparations previously.

In March 1849 finally the „Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches für Deutschland“ (Draft of a general commercial code for Germany)&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Theodor Baums: ''Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches für Deutschland (1848/1849)'', Heidelberg 1982, p. 59 ff.; [http://reader.digitale-sammlungen.de/de/fs1/object/display/bsb10290733_00007.html Entwurf eines allgemeinen Handelsgesetzbuches für Deutschland, Frankfurt a.M. 1849.]&lt;/ref&gt; was presented. 
After the Prussian King [[Frederick William IV of Prussia|Friedrich Wilhelm IV]] had rejected the imperial crown, that he was offered on 4 April 1849, the constitutional project miscarried. In the same year Commission dissolved.

=== The ADHGB===

==== Nuremberg HGB-Commission ====
On a proposal from the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]] the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]] (''Bundesversammlung'' also ''Bundestag'') of the [[German Confederation]] establish a commission, that should elaborate a commercial code. That was 21 February 1856. [[Maximilian II of Bavaria|King Maximilian II Joseph of Bavaria]] is said to have motivated the project in person.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Christoph Bergfeld: ''Preußen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch'', in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), . 101 (107) Fn. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; The Prussian deputy for the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]] [[Otto von Bismarck]] thereby voted not against the application against, what contravene with the instruction form the Prussian Prime Minister [[Otto Theodor von Manteuffel]] &lt;ref&gt;('''German''') ibid., p. 101 (108).&lt;/ref&gt; Also on the suggestion of [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]] not Frankfurt am Main, Federal Assembly's official seat, but the ancient trading town Nuremberg was chosen as conference venue.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') ibid. p. 101 (109).&lt;/ref&gt; So the working group should go down in history as Nuremberg HGB-Commission (''Nürnberger HGB-Kommission'').&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Cf. only Karsten Schmidt, in: Karsten Schmdit, ''Münchener Kommentar zum HGB'', 3. Auflage, München 2010, Vorbemerkungen zu §&amp;nbsp;1 Rz. 21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The commission presided by the Bavarian Ministry of Justice Friedrich von Ringelmann was in session as of January 1857. Also numerous merchants belonged to the commission.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Christoph Bergfeld: ''Preußen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch'', in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), p. 101 (110).&lt;/ref&gt; 
German mercantile community and jurists thereby pronounced against Code de commerce as a model for ADHGB, because it was pre-industrial characterized and thus been overtaken by circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Ibid., p. 101 (108 et seq.).&lt;/ref&gt;
Instead a Prussian draft war favoured as a working basis.

==== Resolution on ADHGB ====
On 31 May 1861 this "Nuremberg Draft" (''„Nürnberger Entwurf“'')&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Gerhard Köbler: ''Deutsche Rechtsgeschichte – Ein systematischer Grundriss'', 6. Aufl., München 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; of an Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was recommended to be introduced in the individual states by the General Assembly of the German Confederation.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Hartmut Oetker, in:  Claus-Wilhelm Canaris, Mathias Habersack, Carsten Schäfer (Hrsg.) ''Staub HGB'', Bd. 1, 5. Aufl., 2009, Einleitung Rz. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; As of 1861 ADHGB apllied in German Confederation´s member states as inentical right. Some federal states, like the Free City of [[Hamburg]], even declared ADHGB applicable for legal transactions (''Rechtsgeschäfte'') without merchant participation.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Christoph Bergfeld: ''Preußen und das Allgemeine Deutsche Handelsgesetzbuch'', in: Ius Commune, Bd. XIV (1987), p. 101 (113).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Development after 1866 ===
[[German Confederation]] was dissolved in Augsburg on 23 August 1866. ADHGB persisted in the former federal states.

==== Germany ====
[[File:Norddeutsches Bundesgesetzblatt 1869 032 379.jpg|thumbnail|right|Announcement for the North German Confederation (1869)]]
[[North German Confederation]] took over ADHGB by federal act (''Bundesgesetz'') on 5 June 1869.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''')[https://de.wikisource.org/wiki/Gesetz,_betreffend_die_Einf%C3%BChrung_der_Allgemeinen_Deutschen_Wechsel-Ordnung,_der_N%C3%BCrnberger_Wechsel-Novellen_und_des_Allgemeinen_Deutschen_Handelsgesetzbuches_als_Bundesgesetze Bundesgesetzblatt of North German Confederation 1869 p. 379 - 381.]&lt;/ref&gt; ADHGB remained in force in [[German Empire]] in accordance with Imperial Act (Reichsgesetz) of 16 April 1871.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Reichsgesetzblatt 1871, p. 63; The Act of 22 April 1871 ordered that for the [[Kingdom of Bavaria]], Reichsgesetzblatt 1871, p. 63.&lt;/ref&gt; Supreme court for the interpretation of ADHGB was Reichoberhandelsgericht (ROHG, English ''Imperial Higher Commercial Court'', until 1871 Bundesoberhandelsgericht, English ''Federal Higher Commercial Court"), that later was merged in [[Reichsgericht]] (english ''Imperial Court of Justice'').
ADHGB was replaced in German Empire by the [[Handelsgesetzbuch]] (HGB, english ''Commercial Code''), that was legislated on 10 May 1897. The HGB came into force together with the [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]] on 1 January 1900.

==== Austria ====
The ADHGB was introduced as Allgemeines Handelsgesetzbuch (AHGB) (english General Commercial Code) in the [[Austrian Empire|Empire of Austria]] on 1863(österreichisches Reichsgesetzblatt 1/1863). After establishment of the [[Austria|Republic of Austria]] it was applied until the annexation to the German Realm on 13 Märch 1938. Then it was gradually replaced by the Handelsgesetzbuch (HGB).

==== Liechtenstein ====
The Allgemeines Deutsches Handelsgesetzbuch (ADHGB) was assumed by the [[Liechtenstein|Principality of Liechtenstein]] by the act of 16 Septembre 1865. To the present day its binding law.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Kundmachung vom 21. Oktober 1997 des Allgemeinen deutschen Handelsgesetzbuches, [https://www.gesetze.li/lilexprod/ifshowpdf.jsp?lgblid=1997193000&amp;version=2&amp;signed=n&amp;tablesel=0 LGBl. 1997 Nr. 193]. The ADHGB was originally announced by the act of 16 Septembre 1865, Landesgesetzblatt 10/1865&lt;/ref&gt;
Large parts however were replaced by the Personen- und Gesellschaftsrecht (PGR, english ''Personal and Corporation Law'') on 19 February 1926. The ADHGB has still practical significance for the sectors procurators (''Prokuristen''), authorized representative (''Handlungsbevollmächtigte''), commercial brokers (''Handelsmäkler'') and trading activities (''Handelsgeschäfte'').&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Elisabeth Berger: ''Rezeption im liechtensteinischen Privatrecht unter besonderer Berücksichtigung des ABGB'', 2. Aufl., Wien 2011, p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Content ==
With its basic concept&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Thomas Henne: Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsgesetzbuch.igital (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; ADHGB pursues preponderantly an objektive system represented by [[Levin Goldschmidt]], that defines merchant (Kaufmann) objektive by means of  legally standardized trading activities (Handelsgeschäfte). Orientation on professional conduct according to [[Johann Heinrich Thöl]] was clearly rejected.

== Reception ==

=== Germany ===
In the absence of a "Allgemeines Deutsches Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch" (english ''General German Civil Code'') ADHGB included also general rules for representation (''Stellvertretung'') (Art. 52-56 ADHGB), fulfilling (''Erfüllung'') (Art. 324-336 ADHGB) and [[Bill of sale|purchase agreement]] (''Kaufvertrag'') (Art. 337-359 ADHGB), that should be "a landmark template" (''„richtungweisende Vorlage“'') for future [[Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch|Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch (BGB)]].&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') ''Oetker, Hartmut'', in:  Canaris, Claus-Wilhelm /Habersack, Mathias /Schäfer, Carsten (Hrsg.) Staub HGB, Bd. 1, 5. Aufl., 2009, Rz. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Japan ===
The German jurist Hermann Rösler authored a draft of a commercial code for Japan in 1884, that was influenced by the ADHGB.&lt;ref&gt;Kon Sik Kim: Codification in East Asia. Commercial Law, in Wen-Yeu Wang: ''Codification in East Asia. Selected Papers from the 2nd IACL Thematic Conference,'' Cham 2014, p. 64; Wilhelm Röhl: ''History Of Law In Japan Since 1868'', Leiden 2005, p. 355 seq.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Turkey ===
Turkish law also was shaped by the ADHGB.&lt;ref&gt;('''German''') Thomas Henne: Handelsgesetzbuch, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsgesetzbuch.igital (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evaluations and comments ==
For [[Levin Goldschmidt]]&lt;ref&gt;Levin Goldschmidt quoted from ('''German''') Karl-Otto Scherner: Handelsrecht, in: Albrecht Cordes, Heiner Lück, Dieter Werkmüller (Hrsg.), ''Handwörterbuch zur deutschen Rechtsgeschichte'', www.HRGdigital.de/HRG.handelsrecht (21. November 2015).&lt;/ref&gt; ADHGB was "the most thoroughly and best of existing European Commercial Codes" (''„gründlichste und beste unter den vorhandenen Europäischen Handelsgesetzbüchern“'').

'''Bert Willis Karlsson''' (born 21 June 1945, in [[Skövde]], [[Västra Götaland County]]) is a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[record company]] manager, [[entrepreneur]], former [[politician]] ([[Member of Parliament]] 1991-1994) and front figure of the [[New Democracy (Sweden)|New Democracy]] (''Ny Demokrati'') party. 

As the owner and manager of the record company [[Mariann Grammofon AB]], Karlsson became a familiar face to the Swedish public as the man behind [[Carola Häggkvist]]. In 1984 he started [[Skara Sommarland]], a theme park. 

In 1991, Karlsson and count [[Ian Wachtmeister]] started the [[populism|populist]] political party ''[[Ny Demokrati|New Democracy]]''. Attracting major media attention, and with a patriotic platform, the party received 6.7 percent of the vote in the [[Swedish parliamentary election, 1991|parliamentary election]] in September. With no previous political experience, Karlsson suddenly found himself elected to the [[Parliament of Sweden|Riksdag]] as a [[Member of Parliament]].

When ''New Democracy'' imploded due to internal struggles and failed in the [[Swedish parliamentary election, 1994|1994 parliamentary election]] Karlsson went back to being a full-time businessman. He has started the popular Swedish [[reality television]] show [[Fame Factory]], (a programme somewhat similar to the British show [[Pop Idol]]), in which he played an important role. Many Mariann artists have entered [[Melodifestivalen]], the Swedish qualifications for the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. From 1978 to 2005, approximately 120 songs from Karlsson's record company competed, and 14 of these went on to represent Sweden in the Eurovision Song contest. Mariann artists include [[Herreys]] and [[Charlotte Perrelli]], who went on to win the Eurovision Song Contest ([[Eurovision Song Contest 1984|1984]] and [[Eurovision Song Contest 1999|1999]], respectively).

In March 2005, Karlsson filled out an application for membership in the [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberal People's Party]] during a television interview. When the party immediately responded with criticism of him, calling the move a media stunt, he did not go through with his application.

Karlsson was a judge in the first five seasons of the TV show "[[Talang Sverige|Talang]]" on [[TV4 (Sweden)|TV4]], the Swedish version of [[America's Got Talent]], between 2007–2011.

'''Paul David Hewson''', [[Order of the British Empire|KBE]] [[Order of Liberty|OL]] (born 10 May 1960), known by his stage name '''Bono''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɒ|n|oʊ}}), is an Irish singer-songwriter, musician, [[venture capitalist]], businessman, and philanthropist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Bono-A-Global-Rock-Star-and-Activist|title=Bono: A Global Rock Star and Activist.|work=[[Oprah.com]]|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is best known as the lead vocalist and primary lyricist of [[Rock music|rock]] band [[U2]].

Bono was born and raised in [[Dublin]], Ireland. He attended [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]] where he met his future wife, [[Ali Hewson|Alison Stewart]], as well as schoolmates with whom he founded U2 in 1976.&lt;ref name=MacphistoNet /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2Clayton /&gt;  Bono soon established himself as a passionate frontman for the band through his expressive vocal style and grandiose gestures and songwriting. His lyrics are known for their social and political themes, and for their religious imagery inspired by his [[Christianity|Christian]] beliefs.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt;&lt;ref name=Stockman /&gt; During U2's early years, Bono's lyrics contributed to the group's rebellious and spiritual tone.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; As the band matured, his lyrics became inspired more by personal experiences shared with the other members.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; As a member of U2, Bono has received 22 [[Grammy Awards]] and has been inducted into the [[Rock and Roll Hall of Fame]].

Bono is well known for his activism for social justice causes, both through U2 and as an individual. He is particularly active in campaigning for Africa, for which he co-founded DATA, [[EDUN]], the [[ONE Campaign]], and [[Product Red]].&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=NationalPrayerBreakfast /&gt; In pursuit of these causes, he has participated in benefit concerts and met with influential politicians.&lt;ref name=NationalPrayerBreakfast /&gt;&lt;ref name=Time1986 /&gt;&lt;ref name=05312005RollingStone /&gt; Bono has been praised for his philanthropic efforts;&lt;ref name=2006Nobel&gt;Mellgren, D.

==Early life==
Bono was born in the [[Rotunda Hospital]], Dublin, on 10 May 1960.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Bono: In the Name of Love |last=Wall |first=Mick |year=2006 |publisher=Andre Deutsch Ltd |isbn= 978-0-233-00177-7 |page= 17 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RupSPwAACAAJ |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in the [[Northside (Dublin)|Northside]] suburb of [[Finglas]]&lt;ref name="Bono - Evening Herald"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.herald.ie/entertainment/around-town/its-where-i-shaped-my-future-says-bono-3324323.html |title=It's where I shaped my future, says Bono |newspaper=[[Evening Herald]] |publisher=Herald.ie |date=12 December 2012 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with his brother (who is eight years older than Bono) by their mother, Iris (née Rankin), a member of the [[Church of Ireland]], and their father, Brendan Robert "Bob" Hewson, a [[Roman Catholic]].&lt;ref name=MacphistoNet&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macphisto.net/theband/biography/bonobio.html|title=U2 Biography—Bono|publisher=Macphisto.net|year=2006|accessdate=3 May 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; His parents initially agreed that the first child would be raised [[Anglican]] and the second Catholic.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire by Dunphy"&gt;{{cite book|title=Unforgettable Fire: The Definitive Biography of U2|first=Eamon|last=Dunphy|publisher=Warner Books|isbn=0-446-51459-4|location=New York|year=1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bono was the second child, he also attended Church of Ireland services with his mother and brother.&lt;ref name="Unforgettable Fire by Dunphy" /&gt;

[[File:Bonavoxshop.JPG|thumb|left|The hearing aid shop, Bonavox, that provided Hewson with the nickname "Bono Vox".]]
He went to the local primary [[Glasnevin National School]].&lt;ref&gt;Matthews (2008), p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; Bono's mother died on 10 September 1974, after suffering a [[cerebral aneurysm]] at her father's funeral.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; Many U2 songs, including "[[I Will Follow]]", "[[Mofo (song)|Mofo]]", "[[Three (U2 EP)|Out of Control]]", "[[Lemon (U2 song)|Lemon]]" and "[[Tomorrow (U2 song)|Tomorrow]]" focus on the loss of his mother.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=010197DailyTelegraph&gt;{{cite news|title=Growing Up With U2|newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|first=Neil|last=McCormick|date=1 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Schruers&gt;{{cite journal|title=U2: Small Victories in a Rock and Roll Struggle of Sound and Emotion Report|first=Fred|last=Schruers|date=May 1983|magazine=[[Musician (magazine)|Musician Magazine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bono attended [[Mount Temple Comprehensive School]], a multi-denominational school in [[Clontarf, Dublin|Clontarf]]. During his childhood and adolescence, Bono and his friends were part of a [[surrealist]] street gang called "Lypton Village". Bono met one of his closest friends, [[Guggi]], in Lypton Village.&lt;ref name="U2 by U2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=U2 by U2|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-077674-9|authors=Edge, Adam Clayton, Larry Mullen Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The gang had a ritual of nickname-giving. Bono had several names: first, he was "Steinhegvanhuysenolegbangbangbang",&lt;ref name="U2 by U2"/&gt; then just "Huyseman", followed by "Houseman", "Bon Murray", "Bono Vox of O'Connell Street", and finally just "Bono".&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono"&gt;{{cite book|last=Assayas|first=Michka|title=Bono on Bono: Conversations with Michka Assayas|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=0-340-83276-2|location=London|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Bono Vox" is an alteration of ''Bonavox'', a [[Latin]] phrase which translates to "good voice". It is said he was nicknamed "Bono Vox" by his friend [[Gavin Friday]]. He initially disliked the name; however, when he learned it translated to "good voice", he accepted it. Hewson has been known as "Bono" since the late 1970s. Although he uses Bono as his stage name, close family and friends also refer to him as Bono, including fellow band members.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;

After he left school, his father Bob Hewson, told him he could live at home for one year but if he was not able to pay his own way, he would have to leave the house.&lt;ref name="U2 by U2" /&gt;

==Personal life==
[[File:Obama and Bono.jpg|thumb|Bono and his wife, Ali Hewson, with President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] at [[Nelson Mandela]]'s [[Funeral of Nelson Mandela|funeral]] in South Africa, December 2013]]

Bono was a close friend to [[INXS]] frontman [[Michael Hutchence]].

Bono is almost never seen in public without sunglasses, as he suffers from [[glaucoma]].&lt;ref name=bono_glaucoma&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ellis-Petersen|first1=Hannah|title=Bono: I've had glaucoma for past 20 years|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2014/oct/17/bono-glaucoma-20-years-u2-dark-glasses|accessdate=17 October 2014|work=The Guardian|date=17 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; During a ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' interview he stated:

''Bob Dylan Chronicles, vol. I, Simon &amp; Schuster, N.Y. (2004) p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the late 1980s or early 90s, Bono bought a top-floor duplex apartment in Manhattan's [[The San Remo|San Remo]] apartment building from [[Steve Jobs]] for $15&amp;nbsp;million. Jobs had renovated it for his own use, but never moved in.&lt;ref name=Isaacson&gt;{{cite book|last=Isaacson|first=Walter|title=Steve Jobs|year=2011|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York, NY|isbn=978-1-4516-4853-9|pages=180}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, Bono was given an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.upenn.edu/pennnews/news/recording-artistactivist-bono-deliver-commencement-address-university-pennsylvania |title=Penn News &amp;#124; Recording Artist/Activist Bono to Deliver Commencement Address at University of Pennsylvania |publisher=Upenn.edu |date=15 March 2004 |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2010, Bono suffered a spinal injury while preparing for a U2 tour, and was taken to a German clinic in [[Munich]] for emergency [[neurosurgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10139846.stm|title=Bono's back surgery puts U2 dates in jeopardy|publisher=The BBC|date=21 May 2010|accessdate=21 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="postp-1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/bono-discharged-from-hospital|title=Bono Discharged From Hospital|publisher=U2.com|date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The North American leg of the tour was postponed and rescheduled for 2011.&lt;ref name="postp-2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/north-american-leg-postponed |title=North American Leg Postponed |publisher=U2.com |date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.u2.com/news/title/north-american-dates-will-be-rescheduled-in-2011 |title=North American Dates Will Be Rescheduled in 2011 |publisher=U2.com |date=25 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 November 2014, Bono was involved in a "high energy bicycle accident" when he attempted to avoid another rider. Bono was rushed to [[NewYork–Presbyterian Hospital]]/[[Weill Cornell Medical Center]]'s Emergency Department and underwent "multiple X-rays and CAT scans" followed by five hours of surgery. Bono suffered fractures of the shoulder blade, humerus, orbit and pinky finger. Orthopedic trauma surgeon Dean Lorich, MD, stated that "[Bono] was taken urgently to the operating room... where the elbow was washed out and debrided, a nerve trapped in the break was moved and the bone was repaired with three metal plates and 18 screws."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/bono-intensive-therapy-bike-injury-20141119|title=Bono Treated With Metal Plates, 'Intensive Therapy' After Bike Injury|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|first=Jason|last=Newman|date=19 November 2014|accessdate=29 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/injured-bono-keeps-his-head-down-as-hes-seen-for-the-first-time-since-emergency-surgery-after-bike-crash/| work= evoke.ie| title= Injured Bono keeps his head down as he's seen for the first time since emergency surgery after bike crash| date= 24 December 2014| access-date= 6 May 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091753/http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/injured-bono-keeps-his-head-down-as-hes-seen-for-the-first-time-since-emergency-surgery-after-bike-crash/| archive-date= 18 May 2015| dead-url= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono posted to U2's official website, "As I write this, it is not clear that I will ever play guitar again," as reported in ''[[Cycling Weekly]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cyclingweekly.co.uk/news/latest-news/cycling-injuries-mean-bono-may-never-play-guitar-150598|title=Cycling Injuries mean Bono May Never Play Guitar Again|publisher=Cycling Weekly|accessdate=1 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/bonos-guitar/| work= evoke.ie| title= Bono's guitar playing days may be over after cycling accident| date= 2 January 2015| access-date= 6 May 2015| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20150518091749/http://www.evoke.ie/showbiz/bonos-guitar/| archive-date= 18 May 2015| dead-url= yes| df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 1976, Bono, [[The Edge|David Evans ("The Edge")]], his brother [[Dik Evans|Dik]] and [[Adam Clayton]] responded to an advertisement on a bulletin board at Mount Temple posted by fellow student [[Larry Mullen, Jr.|Larry Mullen Jr.]] to form a rock band. The band had occasional jam sessions in which they did covers of other bands. Tired of long guitar solos and hard rock, Bono wanted to play [[The Rolling Stones]] and [[Beach Boys]] songs.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} The band could not play covers very well, so they started writing their own songs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Henke|first=James |title=Blessed Are the Peacemakers|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=9 June 1983 |issue=397|pages=11–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The band went by the name "Feedback" for a few months, before changing to "The Hype" later on. After Dik Evans left the group to join another local band, the [[Virgin Prunes]], the remaining four officially changed the name from "The Hype" to "[[U2]]". Initially Bono sang, played guitar and wrote the band's songs. He said of his early guitar playing in a 1982 interview, "When we started out I was the guitar player, along with the Edge—except I couldn't play guitar. I still can't.

Bono writes the lyrics for almost all U2 songs, which often have social and political themes.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.atu2.com/band/bono/ |title = Bono: Biography from @U2 |publisher = atU2.com |accessdate = 19 November 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His lyrics frequently allude to a religious connection or meaning, evident in songs such as "[[Gloria (U2 song)|Gloria]]" from the band's album ''[[October (U2 album)|October]]'' and "[[I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For]]" from ''[[The Joshua Tree]]''.&lt;ref name=Stockman&gt;Stockman (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; During the band's early years, Bono was known for his rebellious tone which turned to political anger and rage during the band's ''[[War (U2 album)|War]]'', ''The Joshua Tree'' and ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'' eras.&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; Following the [[Remembrance Day bombing|Enniskillen bombing]] that left 11 dead and 63 injured on 8 November 1987, the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|Provisional IRA]] paramilitaries threatened to kidnap Bono.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; IRA supporters also attacked a vehicle carrying the band members.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; These acts were in response to his speech condemning the Enniskillen bombing during a live performance of "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]".&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; The singer had been advised to cut his on-stage outburst from the ''Rattle and Hum'' film, but it was left in.&lt;ref name=RattleandHum&gt;{{cite video |people = Hamlyn, Michael (producer), and Joanou, Phil (director) |year = 1988 |title = [[Rattle and Hum]] |medium = Motion picture |location = United States |publisher = [[Paramount Pictures]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also featured in the film is footage of Bono spray-painting a monument during an outdoor performance; Bono was forced to pay a fine.

U2's sound and focus dramatically changed with their 1991 album, ''[[Achtung Baby]]''. Bono's lyrics became more personal, inspired by experiences related to the private lives of the members of the band.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt; During the band's [[Zoo TV Tour]] several of [[Zoo TV Tour#Bono's stage personas|his stage personas]] were showcased; these included "The Fly", a stereotypical rock star; "Mirror Ball Man", a parody of American [[televangelists]]; and "MacPhisto", a combination of a corrupted rock star and the [[Satan|Devil]].&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ATU2comBonoBio /&gt;

During performances, Bono attempts to interact with the crowd as often as possible. He is known for pulling audience members onto the stage or moving himself down to the physical level of the audience.&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt; At the [[Live Aid|Live Aid concert]] in 1985, Bono leapt off the stage and pulled a woman from the crowd to dance with her as the band played "[[Bad (U2 song)|Bad]]". In 2005, during U2's [[Vertigo Tour]] stop in Chicago, he pulled a boy onto the stage during the song "[[An Cat Dubh / Into the Heart]]".&lt;ref name="Bono on Bono" /&gt;&lt;ref name=VertigoDVD&gt;{{cite video |people = O'Hanlon, Ned (producer), and Hamilton, Hamish (director) |year = 2005 |title = [[Vertigo 2005: Live From Chicago]] |medium = Motion picture |location = United States |publisher = 3DD Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono has often allowed fans to come on stage and perform songs with the band.

Bono has won numerous awards with U2, including 22 [[Grammy award]]s and the [[60th Golden Globe Awards#Best Original Song|2003 Golden Globe award for best original song]], "[[The Hands That Built America]]", for the film ''[[Gangs of New York]]''.&lt;ref name=Grammy&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title=&amp;winner=u2&amp;year=0&amp;genreID=0&amp;hp=1 |title=Grammy Winners List: Artist&amp;nbsp;– U2 |work=[[Grammy Award|Grammy.com]] |publisher=[[The Recording Academy]] |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mqfKCOyt?url=http://www.grammy.com/GRAMMY_Awards/Winners/Results.aspx?title= |archivedate=17 January 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=HFPA&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www1.hfpa.org/browse/member/28459 |title=Award Search&amp;nbsp;– Bono |publisher=[[Hollywood Foreign Press Association]] |accessdate=19 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070926225607/http://www1.hfpa.org/browse/member/28459 |archivedate=26 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the live broadcast of the Golden Globe ceremony, Bono called the award "really, really fucking brilliant!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boliek |first=Brooks |title=Appeals court throws out FCC indecency ruling |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9177e066be8bee44d835017eb6e0cda7 |date=5 June 2007 |accessdate=1 August 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070707012358/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/news/e3i9177e066be8bee44d835017eb6e0cda7 |archivedate=7 July 2007 |deadurl=no |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, the [[Parents Television Council]] condemned Bono for his profanity and started a campaign for its members to file complaints with the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=PTC condemns NBC |publisher=[[Parents Television Council]] |date=20 January 2003 |url=http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/release/2003/0120.asp |accessdate=16 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211001/http://www.parentstv.org/PTC/publications/release/2003/0120.asp |archivedate=30 September 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Bono's use of "fuck" violated FCC indecency standards, the FCC refused to fine NBC because the network did not receive advance notice of the consequences of broadcasting such profanity and the profanity in question was not used in its literal sexual meaning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last = Ahrens |first = Frank |title = FCC Says Bono Profanity Violated Standards, but Won't Fine NBC |pages = E1 |work = The Washington Post |date = 19 March 2004 |url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn?pagename=article&amp;contentId=A6242-2004Mar18&amp;notFound=true |accessdate = 16 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1999, Bono has become increasingly involved in campaigning for third-world debt relief and raising awareness of the plight of Africa, including the AIDS pandemic.

In a speech containing biblical references, Bono encouraged the care of the socially and economically depressed. His comments included a call for an extra one percent [[tithe]] of the United States' national budget. He brought his Christian views into harmony with other faiths by noting that Christian, Jewish, and [[Muslim]] writings all call for the care of the widow, orphan, and stranger. President Bush received praise from the singer-activist for the United States' increase in aid for the African continent.

Theroux, who lived in Africa as a [[Peace Corps]] Volunteer, added that "the impression that Africa is fatally troubled and can be saved only by outside help—not to mention celebrities and charity concerts—is a destructive and misleading conceit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/15/opinion/15theroux.html|title=The Rock Star's Burden|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=22 September 2014|first=Paul|last=Theroux|date=15 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Elsewhere, Bono has been criticised, along with other celebrities, for "[ignoring] the legitimate voices of Africa and [turning] a global movement for justice into a grand orgy of [[narcissistic]] philanthropy".&lt;ref name="movement_robbed"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ahmad |first=Muhammad Idrees |title=Live 8&amp;nbsp;– A movement robbed of its colours |publisher=Campaign for Press and Broadcasting Freedom |date=15 August 2005 |url=http://keywords.dsvr.co.uk/cpbf_newsite/body.php?subject=international&amp;id=1104 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20090427161025/http://keywords.dsvr.co.uk/cpbf_newsite/body.php?subject=international&amp;id=1104 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=27 April 2009 |accessdate=5 March 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When trade laws prevent you from selling the food you grew, you are not free ... When you are a monk in Burma this very week, barred from entering a temple because of your gospel of peace ... well, then none of us are truly free''". Bono donated the $100,000 prize to the organisation.

Bono was a special guest editor of the July 2007 issue of ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine. The issue was named "The Africa Issue: Politics &amp; Power" and featured an assortment of 20 different covers, with photographs by [[Annie Leibovitz]] of a number of prominent celebrities, political leaders, and philanthropists.

[[File:Bono with Barack Obama.jpg|thumb|Bono meeting with US President [[Barack Obama]] in 2010.]]
In an article in Bloomberg Markets in March 2007, journalists [[Richard Tomlinson]] and Fergal O'Brien noted that Bono used his band's 2006 Vertigo world tour to promote his [[ONE Campaign]] while at the same time "U2 was racking up $389&amp;nbsp;million in gross ticket receipts, making Vertigo the second-most lucrative tour of all time, according to Billboard magazine ... Revenue from the Vertigo tour is funnelled through companies that are mostly registered in Ireland and structured to minimise taxes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/marketsmag/bono.pdf|title=Bloomberg Markets, "Bono Inc", March 2007|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further criticism came in November 2007, when Bono's various charity campaigns were targeted by Jobs Selasie, head of [[African Aid Action]]. Selasie claimed that these charities had increased corruption and dependency in Africa because they failed to work with African entrepreneurs and grassroots organisations, and as a result, Africa has become more dependent on international handouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nme.com/news/bono/32704|title=Bono and Bob Geldof increase Africa's problems say charity|date=23 November 2007|work=NME.COM|accessdate=22 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bono responded to his critics in ''Times Online'' on 19 February 2006, calling them "cranks carping from the sidelines. A lot of them wouldn't know what to do if they were on the field.

Bono was among those cited in the [[Paradise Papers]] after he was named as a passive minority investor in Nude Estates, which bought a shopping mall in Lithuania in 2007 and transferred ownership to Nude Estates 1 in Guernsey in an apparent attempt to avoid tax. Bono welcomed the subsequent investigation by the Lithuanian tax authority, stating that he welcomed transparency and had personally campaigned for it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Paradise Papers: Bono says he welcomes investigation into offshore investment| url = https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/bono-paradise-papers-u2-tax-offshore-investment-guernsey-malta-shopping-mall-statement-latest-a8044541.html | newspaper = The Independent | date = 8 November 2017 |first = Roisin | last = O'Connor | accessdate = 10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nude Estates paid €53,000 in taxes and fines after the investigation was completed and Bono severed ties with the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title =

'''Brookfield Properties Retail Group''' (abbreviated '''BPRG''') is an American retail [[real estate investment trust]] headquartered in [[Chicago]], [[Illinois]]. It is a subsidiary of [[Brookfield Property Partners]] and the successor of General Growth Properties (GGP), which was founded in 1954 and acquired by Brookfield in 2018. Brookfield acquired Rouse Properties in 2016, which was merged into BPRG with the completion of the GGP acquisition. Its portfolio consists of 163 [[shopping mall]]s in the United States comprising approximately {{convert|146000000|ft}} of [[Floor area (building)|gross leasable area]]; this accounts for all of Brookfield's retail properties in the country, except for the retail space at [[Brookfield Place (New York City)|Brookfield Place]] in [[New York City]], which is managed directly by [[Brookfield Asset Management]].

==History of General Growth==
===1954&amp;ndash;1999===
[[Image:GeneralGrowthProperties.png|150px|thumb|left|General Growth logo pre-2010]]
General Growth was founded in [[Iowa]] by three brothers, [[Martin Bucksbaum|Martin]], [[Matthew Bucksbaum|Matthew]] and Maurice Bucksbaum,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Strom |first1=Stephanie | title=Martin Bucksbaum, 74, Pioneer In Shopping Center Development | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/10/obituaries/martin-bucksbaum-74-pioneer-in-shopping-center-development.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |date=July 10, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1954 as General Management.&lt;ref name=matthew&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2013-11-29/news/ct-obit-matthew-bucksbaum-met-20131129_1_shopping-malls-john-bucksbaum-martin-bucksbaum | title=Matthew Bucksbaum, 1926-2013 | first=Bob | last=Goldsborough | publisher=[[Chicago Tribune]] | date=November 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, they borrowed $1.2&amp;nbsp;million to develop their first shopping center, Town &amp; Country Shopping Center in [[Cedar Rapids, Iowa]], in order to open a fourth location for the grocery store founded by their father.&lt;ref name=martin&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/10/obituaries/martin-bucksbaum-74-pioneer-in-shopping-center-development.html | title=Obituaries: Martin Bucksbaum, 74, Pioneer In Shopping Center Development | first=Stephanie | last=Strom | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=July 10, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1964, the company owned 5 malls and moved its headquarters to [[Des Moines, Iowa]].&lt;ref name=matthew/&gt; In 1970, General Management became General Growth Properties (GGP) and became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]].&lt;ref name=matthew/&gt; In 1984, the company sold its holdings to [[Equitable Real Estate Investment Management]] for $800 million in the largest-ever single-asset real estate transaction to date, but retained the [[property management]] of the assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.icsc.org/sct/newswire/matthew-bucksbaum-87-pioneer-and-philanthropist | title=Matthew Bucksbaum, 87, pioneer and philanthropist | publisher=[[International Council of Shopping Centers]] | date=November 26, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, the company acquired Center Companies, creating the fourth-largest shopping center management company in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/09/30/business/company-news-shopping-center-groups-combine.html | title=Shopping Center Groups Combine |  work=[[Associated Press]] | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=September 30, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nrei&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.nreionline.com/mag/general-growth-lives-its-name-and-then-some | title=General Growth lives up to its name and then some | first=Ben | last=Johnson  | publisher=National Real Estate Investor | date=January 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, the company once again became a [[public company]] via an [[initial public offering]], raising $400 million.&lt;ref name=nrei/&gt; In 1994, the company purchased a 40% interest in Centermark Properties from [[Prudential Financial]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1993/11/04/business/company-news-prudential-will-sell-centermark.html | title=Prudential Will Sell Centermark | first=JOSHUA | last=MILLS | publisher=[[The New York Times]] | date=November 4, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1993/11/03/Investors-to-buy-Prudentials-shopping-malls-for-1-billion/6277752302800/ | title=Investors to buy Prudential's shopping malls for $1 billion | publisher=[[United Press International]] | date=November 3, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the company sold 25% of its 40% stake, yielding a profit of over $100 million.

In 2000, the company moved its headquarters from Des Moines to Chicago.&lt;ref name=matthew/&gt; The company occupied a historic building on North [[Wacker Drive]] designed by architectural firm [[Graham, Anderson, Probst &amp; White]], that was later demolished.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.chicagoarchitecture.info/Building/1247/General_Growth_Building.php |title=General Growth Building, Chicago | website=Chicago Architecture Info}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the company acquired [[The Rouse Company]], which owned 37 regional shopping malls and [[Howard Hughes Corporation]], a land development company, for $7.2 billion in cash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20041112005572/en/General-Growth-Properties-Completes-Merger-Rouse-Company | title=General Growth Properties, Inc.

In 2009, the company missed a deadline to repay $900 million in loans backed by two Las Vegas properties, putting the company in danger of filing for [[bankruptcy]] protection.

Various news sources suggest Chaleo was born in [[central Thailand]] at some point between 1922 and 1932.&lt;ref name="NYT-20120318"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Segal|first1=David|title=Chaleo Yoovidhya, Who Created Red Bull Beverage, Is Dead| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/19/business/chaleo-yoovidhya-dies-created-red-bull-energy-drink.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=The New York Times|date=2012-03-18|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The New York Times'' notes that three birthdates have been put forward by different sources: "''The Nation'', a Thai newspaper, reported that he was 90, while several other news media outlets in Thailand said he was 88. ''[[Forbes]]'' recently put his age at 80." BBC News states, "Mr Chaleo was born of poor Chinese immigrant parents in the northern province of Phichit, reportedly in 1932, local media say".&lt;ref name="BBC-20120317"&gt;{{cite news|title=Red Bull creator and Thai tycoon Chaleo Yoovidhya dead|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/business-17416385|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=BBC News|date=2012-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Australian'' and ''Time'' say he was 89.&lt;ref name="Australian-20120319"&gt;{{cite news|title=Thai billionaire inventor of Red Bull Chaleo Yoovidhya dies aged 89|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/thai-billionaire-inventor-of-red-bull-chaleo-yoovidhya-dies-aged-89/news-story/8cbdc736278663f6f07439c15730891d|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=The Australian|date=2012-03-19|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Horn|first1=Robert|title=Duck Farmer to Billionaire: Red Bull Co-Founder Dies|url=https://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2109386,00.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=Time|date=2012-03-18|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Telegraph'' and ''The Independent'' say he was born in 1923 to a poor Thai-Chinese family that raised ducks and traded fruit in [[Phichit Province|Phichit]].&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Childs|first1=Martin|title=Chaleo Yoovidhya: Recluse who created the Red Bull energy drink|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/chaleo-yoovidhya-recluse-who-created-the-red-bull-energy-drink-7579362.html|accessdate=9 January 2018|work=The Independent|date=2012-03-21|format=Obituary}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was an immigrant from [[Hainan]].

With little formal education, he worked for his parents, then moved to [[Bangkok]]. He became an [[antibiotics]] salesman, before quitting to set up his own small pharmaceutical company, TC Pharmaceuticals, in the early-1960s.&lt;ref name="TCP-History"&gt;{{cite web|title=History|url=https://www.tcp.com/en/about/history.php#1956-1967|website=T.C. Pharma (TCP)|accessdate=9 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321" /&gt; Later, after a claimed stroke of "divine inspiration", he developed an energy-boosting beverage that was first introduced in 1976. The logo depicts two large, red bulls charging each other, which are not [[cattle]], but wild [[gaur]], a bovine species native to Southeast Asia called ''krathing'' (กระทิง) in Thai. 

[[Dietrich Mateschitz]], an Austrian salesman for a German company, found the drink cured his [[jet lag]],&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321" /&gt; and entered into partnership with Chaleo in 1984.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-20120319" /&gt; In 1987, the two launched an export version labelled "Red Bull", for which Chaleo provided the original formula (adapted for Western tastes under Mateschitz's guidance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VrO3O0h6I0wC |title=Asian Brand Strategy: How Asia Builds Strong Brands |last1=Roll |first1=Martin |isbn=9780230513068 |page=199 |publisher=Springer |date=17 October 2005 |accessdate=24 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and Mateschitz the marketing. Each put up US$500,000 for 49 per cent of the Red Bull energy drink franchise, with Chaleo's son, [[Chalerm Yoovidhya|Chalerm]], owning the remaining two per cent.&lt;ref name="Independent-20120321" /&gt; Chaleo continued to own TC Pharmaceuticals, which manufactured other energy drinks in Thailand, and was part-owner of [[Piyavate Hospital]], a private hospital in Thailand.

The Yoovidhya family co-owns the sole authorized importer of [[Ferrari]] cars into Thailand.

'''Cognos''' (Cognos Incorporated) was an [[Ottawa]], [[Ontario]]-based [[company (law)|company]] making [[business intelligence]] (BI) and [[performance management]] (PM) [[software]].  Founded in 1969, at its peak Cognos employed almost 3,500 people and served more than 23,000 customers in over 135 countries until being acquired by [[IBM]] on January 31, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://techcrunch.com/2007/11/12/acquisitions-ibm-buys-cognos-microsoft-buys-musiwave/ |title=Acquisitions: IBM Buys Cognos, Microsoft Buys Musiwave |date=Nov 12, 2007 |last=Riley |first=Duncan }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ibm.cioreview.com/news/migrating-to-selfservice-bi-with-ibm-cognos-nid-24574-cid-117.html|title=Migrating to Self-service BI with IBM Cognos|last=Review|first=CIO|work=CIOReview|access-date=2018-06-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; While no longer an independent company, the Cognos name continues to be applied to IBM's line of [[List of IBM products#Middleware and applications|business intelligence and performance management products]].

==History==
Cognos was founded in 1969 by Alan Rushforth and Peter Glenister.&lt;ref name="VoyerRyan1994"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roger Voyer|author2=Patti Ryan|title=The new innovators: how Canadians are shaping the knowledge-based economy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jg_8NhCOLTEC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=15 September 2011|date=1 January 1994|publisher=James Lorimer &amp; Company|isbn=978-1-55028-463-8|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Michael U. Potter joined Cognos in 1972, and was its Chief Executive Officer from 1975 until 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography - Mr Michael U Potter|url=http://www.rcaf-arc.forces.gc.ca/en/article-template-biography.page?doc=mr-michael-u-potter/hlrp4hm6|publisher=Royal Canadian Air Force|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It began as a [[Consultant|consulting]] company for the Canadian federal government and offered its first software product, QUIZ, in 1979. During the Canadian recession in the 1980s, Cognos shifted its focus from consulting to software sales.

Originally Quasar Systems Limited, it adopted the Cognos name in 1982. Cognos is a fragment scissored off the Latin word "cognosco," which means "knowledge from personal experience".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/cognos-incorporated-usa#ixzz2FdFIn0jzOn Gale Directory of Company Histories]&lt;/ref&gt; Cognos became a public company in August 1986 trading on the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] as CSN and on the [[NASDAQ]] as COGN. Its independent existence ended on January 31, 2008, when Cognos was acquired by [[IBM]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/23423.wss IBM Completes Acquisition of Cognos February 1, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, Ron Zambonini was named CEO and brought new marketing strategies. Cognos grew successful with its business intelligence products for [[local area network]]s (LAN), but new Internet technologies had come into the BI industry faster than the company had anticipated. After Cognos issued a notice informing shareholders of a slowdown in growth, many sold their shares, causing prices to fall quickly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.answers.com/topic/cognos-incorporated-usa |title=Company History: Cognos, Inc. |accessdate=October 14, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=July 2016}}{{When|date=July 2016}}

This prompted Cognos to build its web technology through the [[takeover|acquisition]] of other companies rather than internal [[research and development]]. In September 2007, Cognos announced that it would be acquiring [[Applix]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.specialtypub.com/startit/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=6077&amp;SECTION=2 Cognos Plans Acquisition ''Start-IT Magazine'' September 13, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071122145344/http://www.specialtypub.com/startit/article.asp?ARTICLE_ID=6077&amp;SECTION=2 |date=November 22, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It had previously acquired Right Information Systems ([[4Thought]]), Interweave (Impromptu Web Query), Relational Matters (DecisionStream), Scientific Time Sharing Corporation (LEX2000), NoticeCast, Adaytum, Frango, DataBeacon, and Celequest.

In January 2010, as part of a reorganization of IBM Software Group, software from Cognos and recently acquired [[SPSS]] were brought together to create the [[Business Analytics]] division.

On December 31, 2013,  UNICOM Systems, a division of [[UNICOM Global]]  acquired the [[PowerHouse (programming language)|PowerHouse product line]] including PowerHouse 4GL Server, Axiant® 4GL and PowerHouse Web®,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Woodie |first=Alex |url=http://www.itjungle.com/fhs/fhs012114-story07.html |title=Unicom Adds HP3000 Biz with Cognos ADT Buy |work=Four Hundred Stuff |date=2014-01-21 |accessdate=2016-03-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so Powerhouse products would no longer be part of the IBM product set.

==Federal investigation==
In August 2007, the Massachusetts state Information Technology Division awarded Cognos a $13 million contract for performance management software. This followed a 2006 $4.5 million state contract awarded to Cognos by the [[Massachusetts Department of Education]]. These contracts came under scrutiny from the State Ethics Commission and the office of state [[Inspector General#United States|Inspector General]] [[Gregory Sullivan]] when several conflicts of interest surrounding [[Speaker (politics)|Speaker]] of the [[Massachusetts House of Representatives]] [[Salvatore DiMasi]] and his accountant [[Richard Vitale]] came to light.

In the course of these investigations, a payoff from former Cognos sales executive [[Joseph Lally]] in the amount of $600,000 was found to have been made to Vitale's company [[WN Advisors]]. Vitale and WN Advisors were not registered as state lobbyists and did not disclose the payments, the bulk of which were apparently made on the same day that the state wired funds for the multimillion-dollar contracts to Cognos. The disposition of the funds has not been disclosed and the State has rescinded the contracts. IBM, who now owns Cognos, has refunded the improperly awarded $13 million paid to Cognos.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/03/10/software_contract_called_improper/ |title=Software contract called improper |date=March 10, 2008 |last=Estes |first=Andrea |work=The Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A second close associate of DiMasi's, lawyer Steven Topazio, was placed on a two-year $5,000 a month retainer for unspecified purposes. This retainer stopped the same month as the second Cognos contract was awarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2008/12/17/cognos_deals_face_federal_scrutiny/ Cognos Deals Face Federal Scrutiny] December 17, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to the payoffs made to close associates of DiMasi, it is known that Vitale helped arrange a below-market mortgage for DiMasi, which violated state Ethics laws.

On December 17, 2008, ''[[The Boston Globe]]'' confirmed that the State investigations were being joined by a Federal [[Grand Jury]] probe investigating the allegations and potential violations of Federal law.  On June 2, 2009, DiMasi, Vitale, Lally, and Cognos lobbyist [[Richard McDonough]] were indicted "on a battery of...corruption charges" as a result of that probe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2009/06/03/dimasi_three_associates_indicted_on_state_contract_rigging_charges/ DiMasi, 3 associates charged with rigging of state contracts] June 3, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition of Cognos by IBM==
In 2007, following [[SAP AG|SAP]]'s acquisition of [[Business Objects]] and [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]]'s acquisition of [[Hyperion Solutions]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://business.timesonline.co.uk/tol/business/industry_sectors/technology/article2858402.ece |title=IBM acquires Cognos for $5bn |date=November 12, 2007 |last=Blakely |first=Rhys |location=London |work=The Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; IBM announced its acquisition of Cognos in November for $4.9 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-13505_3-9815471-16.html |title=IBM buys Cognos for $4.9 billion as industry consolidation hits overdrive |date=November 12, 2007 |last=Asay |first=Matt |work=CNet News}}&lt;/ref&gt; It continued to operate as a wholly owned subsidiary (Cognos, an IBM company) until January 1, 2009, when it was absorbed into [[IBM Infosphere]] product line under [[IBM Information Management Software]] brand within the company's Software Group. The software is now called "IBM Cognos Analytics" and "IBM Planning Analytics" or CA and PA.

==BI market==
IBM's purchase of Cognos and other business intelligence software vendors was a step in establishing IBM as a BI "megavendor" (along with Oracle, Microsoft, and SAP).  This consolidation may prove beneficial for customers to have fewer vendors to deal with, but this raises concerns about integration of the software as more vendors are bought out by the big four. Another challenge is maintaining the same level of customer service. [[Gartner]] interprets the lower ratings given in "customer experience" for IBM Cognos and SAP Business Objects as a result of post-acquisition issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/systems_management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222600994 |title=SAP Questions Gartner BI Magic Quadrant Ranking |date=February 3, 2010 |last=Henschen |first=Doug}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Due to many consolidations in the BI industry, there are only a few independent "pure-play" vendors remaining ([[SAS Institute Inc.|SAS]] and [[MicroStrategy]] being the largest).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/global-cio/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=202805190 |title=What IBM's Cognos Acquisition Means For The BI Market And Its Customers |date=November 12, 2007 |last=Weier |first=Mary Hayes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
On October 26, 2015, at the IBM Insight conference in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], IBM leadership [http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/47942.wss announced] a redesigned user experience for its flagship Cognos Business Intelligence software. The redesign will be version 11 and an upgrade from Cognos Business Intelligence 10.x.  The differentiation in the version 11 release also required renaming to IBM Cognos Analytics, based on the same self-service design principles as Watson Analytics. The redesigned Cognos product also features smarter search that works in-context.

On October 25, 2010, at the Business Analytics Forum in [[Las Vegas, Nevada|Las Vegas]], IBM General Manager for Business Analytics and former Cognos CEO Rob Ashe announced IBM Cognos 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-03.ibm.com/press/us/en/pressrelease/32858.wss|title=IBM Unveils New Information Management And Analytics Software To Help Organizations Gain Faster Insight For Smarter Business Outcomes|publisher=IBM|accessdate=24 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A significant upgrade to IBM Cognos 8 BI, this new software brings together social collaboration and analytics for business users to gain real-time intelligence in a single, user-friendly interface — online or through mobile devices such as iPad, iPhone and BlackBerry devices.

==Recognition==
IBM Cognos 8 BI has won numerous awards including the eWEEK Excellence Award in Analytics and Reporting, the LOTUS ADVISOR "Editor's Choice" Award, and TechTarget's SearchCRM.com 2005 Product of the Year.

In 2007, Cognos was named one of [[Canada's Top 100 Employers]], as published in [[Maclean's]] magazine, one of only a handful of software development companies to receive this honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eluta.ca/einfo?en=Cognos+Incorporated&amp;ri=a2baf9fd8013a601f7f4949c9b164ac0&amp;rk=9e94dbb1b2641331e5a85c7d340e66e9|archive-url=https://archive.is/20120729230650/http://www.eluta.ca/einfo?en=Cognos+Incorporated&amp;ri=a2baf9fd8013a601f7f4949c9b164ac0&amp;rk=9e94dbb1b2641331e5a85c7d340e66e9|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2012-07-29|title=Reasons for Selection, 2007 Canada's Top 100 Employers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to being acquired, Cognos had been named to the InformationWeek 500, chosen as one of START-IT Magazine's "Hottest Companies of 2006" and won "Best of Information On Demand Showcase" as part of the IBM Information Management Awards.

Cognos, now as IBM Cognos Software, continues to rank in the Leaders quadrant of [[Gartner]]'s Magic Quadrant for Business Intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.informationweek.com/news/software/systems_management/showArticle.jhtml?articleID=222600994 |title=SAP Questions Gartner BI Magic Quadrant Ranking |date=February 3, 2010 |last=Henschen |first=Doug |quote=Recapping the MQ leaders quadrant, Oracle and Microsoft led on ability to execute while IBM Cognos and SAP BusinessObjects led on completeness of vision.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1907">The '''core business''' of an organization is an idealized construct intended to express that organization's "main" or "essential" activity.  

The [[corporation|corporate]] trend in the mid-20th Century, of acquiring new enterprises and forming [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]]s, enabled [[corporation]]s to reduce costs funds and similar investment vehicles, and sometimes the following of a popular trend among corporate management seeking to appeal to current and impress investors.

Core business process means that a business's success depends not only on how well each department performs its work, but also on how well the company manages to coordinate departmental activities to conduct the core business process, which is;

1. '''The market-sensing process'''
Meaning all activities in gathering marketing intelligence and acting on the information.

2. '''The new-offering realization process'''
Covering all activities in research, development and launching new quality offerings quickly and within budget.

3. '''The customer acquisition process'''
all the activities defining the target market and prospecting for new customers

4. '''The customer relationship management process'''
all the activities covering building deeper understanding, relationships and offerings to individual customers.

5. '''The fulfillment management process'''
all the activities in receiving and approving orders, shipping out on time and collecting payment.

To be successful, a business needs to look for competitive advantages beyond its own operations. The business needs to look at the competitiveness value chain of suppliers, distributors and customers. Many companies today have partnered with specific suppliers and distributors to create a superior value delivery network.

'''FIRJAN System''' is a network of private nonprofit organization with more than ten thousand associates. Its mission is to promote business [[competitiveness]], [[education]] and [[quality of life]] of industrial workers and the whole society, in the state of [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/sistemafirjan/info|title=Sistema FIRJAN – Missão|accessdate=6 June 2014|website=FIRJAN System}}&lt;/ref&gt; FIRJAN System consists of five institutions that work in an integrated manner for the growth of the industry of RJ. Together, [[Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro|FIRJAN]], [[Industrial Center of Rio de Janeiro|Industrial Center of Rio de Janeiro (CIRJ)]], [[Industry Social Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro|Industry Social Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro (SESI Rio)]], [[National Industrial Training Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro|National Industrial Training Service of the State of Rio de Janeiro (SENAI Rio)]] and [[Euvaldo Lodi Institute of Rio de Janeiro|Euvaldo Lodi Institute of Rio de Janeiro (IEL Rio)]] promote actions in economic, political and social levels to ensure a prominent position to the state on the national scenery. Today, all institutions act as [[service provider]]s to enterprises and society.

== Organizations ==

FIRJAN System thus acts in an integrated way through the five organizations that comprise it:

=== FIRJAN ===

FIRJAN develops and coordinates studies, researches and projects to guide the actions of industrial promotion and new investments in the state. Its themed corporate boardrooms and sectoral entrepreneurial forums discuss trends and launch guidelines for actions of support and advice to enterprises. Today, more than 80 industrial unions are affiliated to FIRJAN, representing more than 10,000 businesses around the Rio de Janeiro state.

=== CIRJ ===

CIRJ enables the associated companies access (in special conditions) to the services offered by the five institutions of FIRJAN System. Its goal is to promote business competitiveness and protect the interests of members. The service is personalized.

=== SENAI Rio ===

O SENAI Rio promove aprendizagem industrial, qualificação e especialização de trabalhadores por meio de cursos diversos. Possui uma rede de 42 unidades operacionais fixas – entre elas, cinco Centros de Tecnologia de referência nacional e regional – e 30 unidades móveis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.firjan.org.br/data/pages/40288094212F79010121304737895C0A.htm |title=Unidades do SENAI |accessdate=10 June 2014 |website=Sistema FIRJAN |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140515085859/http://www.firjan.org.br/data/pages/40288094212F79010121304737895C0A.htm |archivedate=15 May 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== SESI Rio ===

SESI Rio develops actions to promote health, education, sports, leisure and culture targeted to workers, businesses and society in general. The institution also operates in the areas of [[occupational Safety and Health]] and [[environmental protection]]. It has 30 operating units distributed throughout the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firjan.org.br/data/pages/40288094212F790101213047376A5C05.htm |title=Unidades do SESI |accessdate=10 June 2014 |website=FIRJAN System |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809194119/http://www.firjan.org.br/data/pages/40288094212F790101213047376A5C05.htm |archivedate=9 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== IEL Rio ===

IEL Rio promotes business training and develops  projects to encourage [[entrepreneurship]], contributing to the industry's [[modernization]] and growth. Moreover, it seeks to unite universities and research institutions to the business world.

== Pilars ==

=== Business competitiveness ===

Directed to businesses' economy and sustainable development, it covers topics that go from [[microeconomic|micro]]/[[macroeconomic]] and [[investment]]s to segmented studies in areas such as [[electrical energy]], [[broadband]], [[natural gas]] and [[nanotechnology]]. And if the interest is the tax management and the development of the [[municipalities of Brazil]], there are the studies ''Fiscal Management FIRJAN Index (IFGF)'' and ''Municipal Development FIRJAN Index (IFDM)'', respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agenda21itaborai.com.br/o-municipio/sistema-firjan/|title=Sistema FIRJAN|accessdate=6 June 2014|website=Agenda 21 Itaboraí}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides, FIRJAN System awards industrial [[good manufacturing practices]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.institutocarbonobrasil.org.br/noticias5/noticia=734155|title=Políticas de meio ambiente em debate no Sistema FIRJAN|accessdate=6 June 2014|website=Instituto Carbono Brasil}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offers consultancy to companies of all sizes, in various fields (such as legal and environmental&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noticiasdenovaiguacu.com/2013/10/sistema-firjan-orienta-micro-e-pequenos-empresarios-sobre-gestao-ambiental.html|title=Sistema FIRJAN orienta micro e pequenos empresários sobre gestão ambiental|accessdate=6 June 2014|website=Notícias de Nova Iguaçu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In all actions, its objective is to stimulate "the generation of new businesses, new markets, access to strategic information for competitiveness improvement, as well as the spread of specialized studies that promote the economic development of enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.monitormercantil.com.br/index.php?pagina=Noticias&amp;Noticia=152554&amp;Categoria=EMPRESAS|title=I Can participa de evento na Baixada|accessdate=6 June 2014|date=19 May 2014|website=Monitor Mercantil}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of these studies include the periodic analysis of scenarios for the coming years in the Brazilian manufacturing sector, which implies mapping the "foreign and domestic investments and pointing out opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.simmmerj.org.br/index.php/noticias/75-governador-sergio-cabral-participa-do-dia-da-industria-no-sistema-firjan|title=Governador Sérgio Cabral participa do Dia da Indústria no Sistema FIRJAN|date=3 June 2013|accessdate=6 June 2014|website=SIMMMERJ – Sindicato das Indústrias Metalúrgicas, Mecânicas e de Metal Elétrico no Estado do Rio de Janeiro}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, conducted by the [[Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro]], was inspired by the [[creative industry in Brazil]] to analyze the growth prospects&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.cultura.gov.br/economiacriativa/mapeamento-da-industria-criativa-no-brasil-firjan/ |title=Mapeamento da Industria Criativa no Brasil – FIRJAN |date=21 November 2012 |accessdate=10 June 2014 |last=Davila |first=Marcelo |website=Brazilian Ministry of Culture |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808062504/http://www2.cultura.gov.br/economiacriativa/mapeamento-da-industria-criativa-no-brasil-firjan/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the professions related to knowledge and innovation in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|URL=http://www.revistadigital.com.br/2011/12/a-inovacao-na-era-da-economia-criativa/|title=A inovação na era da Economia Criativa|date=1 December 2011|accessdate=10 June 2014|website=Revista Digial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education ===

This field of activity includes the actions of both SESI Rio and SENAI Rio. ''SESI School'' operates from kindergarten to high school, presenting plays as one of its educational resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radioitaperunafm.com/site/2014/05/16/teatro-sesi-apresenta-em-itaperuna-o-esquecimento-global/ |title=Teatro SESI apresenta em Itaperuna "O Esquecimento Global" |accessdate=6 June 2014 |website=Rádio Itaperuna FM |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140808051544/http://radioitaperunafm.com/site/2014/05/16/teatro-sesi-apresenta-em-itaperuna-o-esquecimento-global/ |archivedate=8 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Besides, learning numbers is easier with the playful initiatives of [[SESI Mathematics]] program, which applies to SESI schools, SENAI units and [[State school|public schools]] as well.

The professional training targets industry segments such as the automotive, the drinks, the electronic and the graphic.

Both school courses are enhanced through the ''Connectivity Program'', which employs new educational technologies to improve teaching and learning.

The technological graduation (upper level) is up to the ''SENAI Rio Faculty'', which trains technicians for the job market.

For the development of Rio's companies – as regards to management, processes, products and services – there are the ''Technology Centers SENAI Rio'', focused on the areas of automation/simulation, welding, food/drinks and environment. Both for consultancy and for vocational training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.petronoticias.com.br/archives/34623|title=Sistema FIRJAN faz parceria com ANP visando formação profissional|date=15 August 2013|accessdate=6 June 2014|website=Petronotícias}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common activity of the two entities is the ''Conecta Seminar'', which every year gathers authorities, students and teachers to reflect on the role of the teacher and find the best way of incorporating information technology in education. Partnerships with other institutions are also established to strengthen further the education and citizenship programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.futura.org.br/o-futura/parceiros-mantenedores/firjan/|title=FIRJAN e Futura: parceiros na promoção da cidadania e da educação|accessdate=6 June 2014|website=Canal Futura}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Quality of life ===

FIRJAN System promotes quality of life through services and programs. The SESI Rio units spread throughout the state offer an infrastructure conducive to leisure, sports, health and culture to society.

In addition to the actions carried out in its unities, the entity conducts the program ''Global Action'', a campaign that provides services to populations in need of basic services in the areas of health (such as eye examination and identification of blood type), citizenship (such as [[Cadastro de Pessoas Físicas|CPF]] issuing and legal advice) leisure, culture and sports (such as handicrafts, choral presentation and sports activities). In communities pacified by the [[Pacifying Police Unit|UPP]], the [[SESI Citizenship]] program makes a similar work, i.e., promotes education, sports, leisure and culture to the locals, only permanently and ''in loco''.

When the goal is to foment access to art, ''Cultural SESI Rio'' steps in. It is a program that offers music, theater, dance and other activities at popular prices. Noteworthy are the ''SESI's X-Everything Cultural'', annual event that promotes various artistic events with free admission, and the ''SESI In Jazz Festival'', gathering which unites renowned artists and new talents of Jazz.

== History ==

In order to foment the Brazilian industry, in 1831 it was founded the ''Helper Society of the National Industry'' (Sain).&lt;ref group="note"&gt;It marks "the origin of the class representation of the industrial sector in Brazil" and, in the 1870s, it sponsored the first Industrial School in Brazil (the one that about one century later became [[SENAI]]).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Livro 170"/&gt; This [[private company]] has served for 50 years as an advisory body to the [[Federal Government]], especially in economic affairs of the [[Empire of Brazil]]. In 1850 – with the extinction of the Board of Trade, Agriculture, Factories and Navigation – Sain also became plants and [[invention]]s organ granting, which Sain itself considered an obstacle to industrial development.

Discontented, industrials associated with Sain requested review of statutes and policies so that they met their interests. In Rio, who defended the interests of the textile sector was the ''Industrial Center of Cotton Spinning and Weaving'', but it lacked a body that would unify all representatives of the domestic industry. This happened when Sain joined the Center in 1904 to be the Industrial Center of Brazil (CIB), which strongly advocated the customs tariff.&lt;ref name="Livro 180"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Heilbron|first1=J.|last2=Barbosa|first2=E. C.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Sistema FIRJAN - 180 anos da indústria brasileira – de 1827 ao séc XXI|publisher=EMC Edições|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World War I ===

With the advent of World War I, Brazil's industry eventually benefited in the medium term. As the country was a great importer of processed products from countries at war and these, in turn, drastically reduced [[exports]] to focus in their warfare, Brazil was forced to replace imports, thus expanding national industrial park.

"Of the 3,400 industrial establishments existing in 1910, it moved 10 years later to 13,600, with the number of workers rising from 150 thousand to 275 thousand, while the industrial output value increased from 769 000 to 3 million ''contos de réis''."&lt;ref name="Livro 170"&gt;{{Citation|last1=Beloch|first1=I.|last2=Fagundes|first2=L. R.|lastauthoramp=yes|title=Sistema FIRJAN: a história dos 170 anos da representação industrial no Rio de Janeiro, 1827-1997|publisher=Memória Brasil Projetos Culturais Ltda.|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Getúlio Vargas ===

In the 1920s, the country was investing in infrastructure ([[hydroelectric]], [[ports]], [[telephony]] and railways) and entrepreneurs imported technology to meet the desire for the most-wanted products at that time. But the big change came a few years later, when Vargas took power in 1930.

To meet both the workers and the entrepreneurs, he created the ''Ministry of Labour, Industry and Commerce'', an industrial [[nationalist]] policy.
* &lt;u&gt;Benefits for workers&lt;/u&gt;: through new legislation, he set the [[working time]] in eight hours and regulated the labor of women and children. He also created [[social insurance]] institutes and transformed simple labour into [[wage labour]];
* &lt;u&gt;Benefits for businessmen&lt;/u&gt;: he invested in industries, new technologies and diversification of the economy, going against the dominant [[oligarchies]].

=== The birth of the entities ===

In 1931, the ''Industrial Center of Brazil (CIB)'' became the ''Industrial Federation of Rio de Janeiro (Firj)'' to represent Rio de Janeiro's [[Secondary sector of the economy|secondary sector]] class. Less than two years later the ''Industrial Confederation of Brazil'' (who inherited the acronym ''CIB'') was founded, and in 1938, it became the ''National Confederation of Industry''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;CNI now coordinates 27 industrial federations (of the 26 Brazilian states and the Federal District) and represents about 1,300 employer's syndicates. Headquartered in Brasília and with an office in São Paulo, the Confederation "makes suggestions for the construction and improvement of policies and laws that strengthen the productive sector and modernize the country."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.portaldaindustria.com.br/cni/institucional/2012/03/1,1739/conheca-a-cni.html|title=Conheça a CNI|accessdate=14 March 2014|website=Portal da Indústria}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 stepped in the ''Industrial Unions Federation in Federal District (FSIDF)'', which in 1941 was renamed ''Industry Federation of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJ)''.&lt;ref name="Livro 170"/&gt;

It was not by chance that its growth kept on strong during this period: "The industrial establishments, which were in number 13 thousand in 1920, came to 50,000 in 1940, with the value of industrial production evolving in the same period from 3.2 million to 17.5 million ''contos de réis''."&lt;ref name="Livro 170"/&gt;

=== Gaspar Dutra, SESI e SENAI ===

However, with the overthrow of Vargas and the entry of [[Eurico Gaspar Dutra]], government investments fell in the second sector, causing the stagnation of the domestic industry. But this ''[[laissez-faire]]'' economic policy ceased with the end of dollar reserves, in 1947. Immediately after the World War II, Dutra requested CNI to create the ''Industry Social Service (SESI)'' – to improve the conditions of workers in areas such as housing, health and transport, aiming at [[social inclusion]] and [[citizenship]] – and the ''National Industrial Training Service (SENAI)'' – to "imbue workers with the work ethic by which industrials love to be guided", i.e., order, dedication and commitment. Regional departments of both "would be operationalized by the state industry federations."&lt;ref name="Livro 170"/&gt;

=== Vargas, BNDES and Petrobras ===

In 1951 Vargas takes power and invests again in the basic industry, transport and energy. It is worth mentioning two major actions in this regard: 
* The creation of the [[National Bank for Economic and Social Development]] (BNDES) in 1952 to [[finance]] industrial enterprises and infrastructure;
* The constitution of [[Petrobras]] in 1953 to operate in activities related to the oil, natural gas and derivatives sector.

=== Juscelino Kubitschek ===

After the death of Vargas, [[Juscelino Kubitschek]] assumed in 1956 and "announced his ''Plano de Metas'', primarily aimed at the sectors of energy (43.4% of the planned investments), transportation (29 6%), basic industry (20.4%) and food (6.6%)."&lt;ref name="Livro 180"/&gt; With [[developmentalism]] on the agenda, [[ferrous metallurgy]], oil production and hydropower grew a lot.

=== Até os dias de hoje ===

Since then, FIRJ evolved and strengthened its activities: in 1958 it changed its name to '''Federation of Industries of the Federal District'''; in 1960 it became '''Federation of Industries of the State of Guanabara (Fiega)''' and, in 1975, became known as '''Federation of Industries of the State of Rio de Janeiro (FIRJAN)''', the current name. But the '''FIRJAN System''' was implemented only in 1994, when united under a single network: [[Industry Federation of the State of Rio de Janeiro|FIRJAN]], [[CIRJ]] and related entities [[SESI Rio]], [[SENAI Rio]] and [[IEL Rio]] – respectively created in 1975, 1941, 1943, 1946 and 1969.&lt;ref name="Livro 170"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32529">The '''Forbes Global 2000''' is an annual ranking of the top 2,000 [[public companies]] in the world by ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine. The ranking is based on a mix of four metrics: [[sales]], [[Profit (accounting)|profit]], [[asset]]s and [[Market capitalization|market value]].{{r|method}} The list has been published since 2003.

The Forbes Global 2000 is a useful indicator of which are the leading public companies in the world, but it is only an interpretation, as only public companies are listed. The results are not definitive; any change to the criteria would produce a different list.

==2018 list==
In 2018, the ten largest companies as calculated by this method were:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/global2000/#e1cb533335d8|title=Global 2000: The World’s Largest Public Companies|publisher=Forbes.com|accessdate=November 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Global strategy''' as defined in business terms is an organization's strategic guide to [[globalization]]. Such a connected world, allows a business’s revenue to not be to be confined by borders. A business can employ a global business strategy&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inwhatlanguage.com/blog/global-business-strategy/|title=Why A Global Business Strategy Is Necessary For Global Domination!|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reap the rewards of trading in a worldwide market. 

==Description==
A sound global strategy should address these questions: what must be (versus what is) the extent of market presence in the world's major markets? How to build the necessary global presence? What must be AND (versus what is) the optimal locations around the world for the various value chain activities? How to run global presence into a global competitive advantage? The “International” classification of a global business strategy is employed by companies who may sell in foreign markets, but their primary focus is on their home market. These companies may include international strategies in their business model to increase sales, but they know that their main target consumer is local.   &lt;ref&gt;Vijay Govindarajan and Anil K. Gupta 'The Quest for Global Dominance: Transforming Global Presence into Global Competitive Advantage' Jossey-Bass. (2008). p. 20-21&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
Academic research on global strategy came during the 1980s, including work by [[Michael Porter]] and Christopher Bartlett &amp; [[Sumantra Ghoshal]]. Among the forces perceived to bring about the globalization of competition were convergences in economic systems and technological change, especially in information technology, that facilitated and required the coordination of a multinational firm's strategy on a worldwide scale.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Porter (ed.) 'Competition in Global Industries' Harvard Business School Press. (1986)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Christopher A 1989"&gt;Christopher A. Bartlett and Sumantra Ghoshal 'Managing across Borders: The Transnational Solution' Harvard Business School Press. (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Industries==
A global strategy may be appropriate in industries where firms are faced with strong pressures for cost reduction but with weak pressures for local responsiveness. Therefore, it allows these firms to sell a standardized product worldwide. However, [[fixed cost]]s ([[capital (economics)|capital]] equipment) are substantial. Nevertheless, these firms are able to take advantage of scale economies and [[experience curve effects]], because it is able to mass-produce a standard product, which can be exported (providing that demand is greater than the costs involved).

Global strategies require firms to tightly coordinate their product and pricing strategies across international markets and locations, and therefore firms that pursue a global strategy are typically highly centralized.&lt;ref name="Christopher A 1989"/&gt;

==Aspects==
A global strategy involves thinking in an integrated way about all aspects of business-its suppliers, production sites, markets, and competition. It involves assessing every product or service from the perspective of both domestic and international market standards. It means embedding international perspectives in product formulations at the point of design, not as afterthoughts. It means meeting world standards even before seeking world markets and being world class even in local markets. It means deepening the company's understanding of local and cultural differences in order to become truly global. &lt;ref&gt;Kanter, R. M., &amp; Dretler, T. D. (1998, November). "Global strategy" and its impact on local operations. The Academy of Management Executive, 12 (4), pp. 60-68. &lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hussein Bakry Gazzaz''' (Born March 10, 1925) is a [[Saudi Arabia]]n [[Entrepreneur|businessman]] who founded the [[Gazzaz Department Stores]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goliath.ecnext.com/coms2/product-compint-0000933344-page.html|title=Hussein Bakry Gazzaz and Company Ltd. company profile|publisher=Goliath Business Knowledge|accessdate=2009-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; chain in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

Gazzaz is [[Marriage|married]] to Suraya Ezz, an Egyptian of Turkish descendant. The couple have 10 children, Samy, Laila, Nariman, Assim, Nadia, Mohamed, Aida, Osama, Hala and Gehan.

His brother Salah Gazzaz who founded sub branches for the stores in Jeddah married Fatma Kanakri. The couple had 7 children Nabil, Nabila, Faten,Waheed,Eman,Samir and Jamal.

==History==
Gazzaz attended Tah'deer El Be'that school; however, he left school at the age of 13 to pursue employment. Gazzaz's first business, a small counter in the hallway of Bab Ziyadah Makkah, was established in 1942. Gazzaz also worked for 2 years within the Saudi [[Finance minister|Ministry of Finance]]. Gazzaz gained experience and insight into diverse [[Economics|economic principles]] and [[business model]]s through his employment within the Ministry of Finance.

In 1946, Gazzaz expanded his business to become the first agent in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) to import Ca Train De Paris, an exclusive French fragrance. Many business owners in KSA found it difficult to obtain high-end luxury items from Europe; however, through writing personal letters to the directors of designer-brand companies Gazzaz developed a network of European contacts who supplied him with luxury goods. Subsequently, Gazzaz's business expanded to include imported perfumes, cosmetics, gift items and other luxury products.

As of May 2012, there were 35 Gazzaz Department Stores in KSA.

==President Jacques Chirac==
The President of France Jacques Chirac gave Hussein Gazzaz the medal of honor for being the biggest importer of cosmetics in the Middle East in the 90's.

==Charity work==
Sheikh Hussein invested more than 30 million Saudi Riyals for helping poverty and distributing medical aids.

==Poem dedicated to Makkah==
At the opening of "Gazzaz Maison" in the holy city of Makkah. The city Hussein Gazzaz was born in, Hussein Gazzaz dedicated this poem to his beloved city and its people:

''"Makkah Oh dearest of lands
I am Back though I have never been away

Even when away you are always in my heart

Makkah I have returned

To pay back some of your favours

Makkah I am back

with love and longing for boyhood

A never quenched longing to the Holy House you embrace.

Makkah I am back

with "Gazzaz Maison"

A proof of the sincerity of your beloving son."''

Hussein Bakry Gazzaz

'''IR35''' refers to the [[United Kingdom]]'s anti-avoidance tax legislation designed to tax "disguised employment" at a rate similar to employment. In this context, "disguised employees" means workers who receive payments from a client via an intermediary, for example, their own [[limited company]], and whose relationship with their client is such that had they been paid directly they would be employees of the client.

Before IR35 was introduced, workers who owned their own limited companies were allowed to receive payments from clients direct to the company and to use the company revenue as would any small company. Company profits could be distributed as dividends, which are not subject to [[National Insurance]] payments. Workers could also save tax by splitting ownership of the company with family members in order to place income in lower tax bands. (This latter practice was recommended by government publications advising on setting up family businesses, but attacked as tax fraud by other government departments, notably the [[HM Treasury|Treasury]]. It came under separate, ultimately unsuccessful attack in 2007, see [[S660A]].) Professional advisors now do not recommend that family members are allocated shares in the company unless they perform a significant role in the business (not just the bookkeeping).

On 20 May 2010, the new [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]]/[[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[coalition]] government's ''Programme for Government'' announced a commitment to "review IR 35, as part of a wholesale review of all small business taxation, and seek to replace it with simpler measures that prevent tax avoidance but do not place undue administrative burdens or uncertainty on the self-employed, or restrict labour market flexibility."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/@dg/@en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |title=The Coalition: our programme for government |date=May 2010 |publisher=HM Government |accessdate=2010-05-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110612015906/http://www.direct.gov.uk/prod_consum_dg/groups/dg_digitalassets/%40dg/%40en/documents/digitalasset/dg_187876.pdf |archivedate=12 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 March 2011 the [[Office of Tax Simplification]] recommended that the Treasury should suspend IR35 or compel [[HM Revenue and Customs]] (HMRC) to make changes to its implementation until wider structural reform to integrate Income Tax and NIC is introduced. After that, the Chancellor announced the Government would keep IR35 'as is' during Budget 2011, but with changes to HMRC administration and to create a new IR35 Forum. This IR35 Forum has achieved little since it was created and there appears to be little interest in the published monthly meeting minutes.

== Background and contents ==
In 1999, as part of that year’s Budget, the UK’s [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]], [[Gordon Brown]], announced that measures would be introduced to counter tax avoidance by the use of so-called "personal service companies". Properly known as the "Intermediaries Legislation", it is more commonly referred to by the consecutively numbered Inland Revenue (now [[HMRC]]) budget press release number 35 in which it was announced (i.e. the 35th Inland Revenue news release of that budget&lt;ref name="ir35index"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk/budget/1999/nrindex.html | title = Budget 99 News Release Index | author =&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; | date = 9 March 1999 | website = [[HM Treasury]] | access-date = 1 June 2018 | archive-url = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/19991009125918/http://www.hm-treasury.gov.uk:80/budget/1999/nrindex.html | archive-date = 9 October 1999 }}&lt;/ref&gt;), titled ''Countering Avoidance in the Provision of Personal Services''.&lt;ref name="ir35"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ir35/jreview.htm | work = HM Revenue and Customs | title = IR35: Countering Avoidance in the Provision of Personal Services - Judgment of court case CO/2302/00  | date = 2 April 2001 | accessdate=2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The press release &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ir35/ir35.htm | work = HM Revenue and Customs | title = IR35: Press Release dated 9 March 1999 | accessdate = 2010-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; was issued on 9 March 1999, the same day as the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]]'s Budget Statement.

IR35 came into force throughout the UK in April 2000. Although it was part of that year's Finance Act and was not law at the start of the Financial Year, the Act backdated its commencement to 6 April 2000. The legislation has been consolidated in the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and in the [[Statutory Instrument]] Social Security Contributions (Intermediaries) Regulations 2000, SI 2000/727. The Finance Act 2017 implements changes in the process for determining the amount of Income Tax and National Insurance to be deducted.

Historically, it had been advantageous for the owners of a small limited companies to take all of their wages in one month, thereby only incurring NI contributions once (up to the monthly ceiling) instead of paying a regular contribution every month like most employees. This ploy had been circumvented some years prior to the introduction of IR35 by imposing NI on the ''total'' annual income of directors as if it were spread over the year, even if only paid by one payment. The increased usage of dividend payments instead of wages was partly a reaction to this change. An additional sense of grievance felt by those who were driven to incorporate, for whatever reason, was the large disparity between the National Insurance burden on companies and employees (&gt;20% if the employer's contribution is included) and that imposed on the self-employed.

The stated aim of the measure was to prevent workers from setting up limited companies via which they would work effectively as [[employees]], but saving on Income Tax and National Insurance. The so-called "Friday to Monday" scenario, that it was possible for a worker to leave a job on Friday and return on Monday to be doing the same work for the same company, but, as a contractor via their own limited company paying a dividend as opposed to earnings which would incur less Income Tax and no payment of National Insurance  and was cited in the press release&lt;ref name="ir35"/&gt; as the anomaly being corrected. In such a scenario, [[HM Revenue and Customs]] would be allowed to "look through" the contractual arrangement between the worker’s company and the client company and to formulate a "hypothetical contract" which showed that the worker was a "disguised employee". The fee paid to the worker’s company would then be taxed as a salary. Normal employment status rules should be applied when considering IR35 status and the view of HM Revenue and Customs can be successfully challenged.

In reality the majority of one-person limited companies have to operate through an agency.  This means that the agency have the contractual agreement with their client to supply an individual.  The agency then has a contract with the one-person limited company to supply the services. 
The responsibility for determining and deducting the correct rates of Income Tax and National Insurance lies with the worker or company but under the Finance Act 2017, where a public authority engages the worker, the responsibility for making this determination and deducting the correct amounts transfers to the public authority for payments made on or after 6 April 2017.&lt;ref&gt;"Public sector off-payroll workers" in [[House of Commons]], [https://www.publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201617/cmagenda/budget_resos_170308.pdf Resolutions to be moved by the Chancellor of the Exchequer], 8 March 2017, accessed 2 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "personal service company" is not defined in law, but it is used by the UK government to refer to "someone who works through their own limited company" as opposed to someone who is self employed and pays Class 2 and Class 4 National Insurance.&lt;ref&gt;HMRC, [https://www.gov.uk/guidance/public-authorities-using-a-personal-service-company Public authorities: using a personal service company], published 3 February 2017, accessed 2 April 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support==
The main arguments adduced in favour of IR35 are that:&lt;ref name="ir35"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press Release dated 23 September 1999 by the Chancellor&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Press Release 14/00 from HMRC&lt;/ref&gt;
* there are clearly cases of "Friday to Monday" &amp;mdash; leaving on Friday as an employee and returning on Monday to the same job as a hired consultant &amp;mdash; which would be considered to be avoiding the payment of the correct Income Tax and National Insurance;
* it is considered unfair that two workers performing the same tasks should pay different rates of Income Tax and National Insurance, when there is no real difference between their working arrangements; and
* the personal service company pays Corporation Tax on the dividends paid to the disguised worker operating through his personal service company and is considerably lower than personal Income Tax.  Dividends do not attract National Insurance so therefore the worker would pay no National Insurance.

The "Friday to Monday" argument was semi-valid in 1999 when vast numbers of IT contractors fled into contracting as demand increased significantly. To retain the same workers, companies needed to offer them contracts. Although it is worth noting that as contractors they were paid considerably more, and generated more tax than before.

The argument about workers doing the same tasks paying the same tax is one that has often been used, but it has no basis in law. The type of work being done is irrelevant, and only the nature of the relationship between workers and hirer is examined in the courts.

The dividend tax regime was changed in April 2016, pretty much wiping out the tax advantage for contractors, who now pay roughly the same amount of tax as an employee when considering the corporation tax and dividend taxes combined. The remaining issue for Government is that hirers do not pay employers NI of 13.8% when hiring the self-employed.

==Criticism==
IR35 has been strongly criticised by several bodies, including former [[Ernst &amp; Young]] tax partner Anne Redston.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.accountancyage.com/aa/news/2036756/budget-2011-ir35-stay&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the key criticisms levelled at the measure include:
* IR35 does not achieve its stated aim of taxing those within IR35 at the same level as employees since those within IR35 also pay Employers NI in addition to Employees NI. This results in much higher levels of tax being paid by those within IR35.
* Its complexity and its harmful impact on many small companies which exist for reasons other than tax avoidance or evasion. These include many companies owned by IT professionals, who often have many short-term contracts rather than one steady engagement.
* That its effects extend far beyond the Friday to Monday scenario envisaged in the original press release, which indeed has never been discussed much since.
* Each contract that the Intermediary company undertakes is viewed separately, which means that one contract with client A could be considered disguised employment and a contract with client B considered to be non employment. HMRC are reluctant to give an opinion on a contract at the time of signing the agreement on the basis that the actual working terms and conditions in reality could be considerably different to the terms of the agreement. 
* Many contracts between the Intermediary company and the client company are generic and rarely go into the details of the actual nature of the work to be undertaken and the working arrangements between the two parties.
* That it is unjust that workers in small family businesses should be taxed as if they were employed by their clients, yet not receive any of the legal, state and other benefits received by "normal" employees.
* HMRC require the Intermediary company to state whether it is inside or outside IR35 on the annual P35 declaration leaving the company with the responsibly to engage an expert to decide the company's tax liability.
* Many business now feed off these Intermediary companies promising that they will help negotiate an IR35 friendly contract, however it is not just the contract that HMRC considers but the actual working arrangements between the worker and the client business.
* There is little evidence that it raises any significant amount of money.
* It renders small businesses uncompetitive with large consultancies and encourages the use of off-shoring avoidance schemes, most of which HMRC has now closed, leaving the worker with a huge tax bill.
* The calculation of a "deemed payment" under the legislation is considered very complex: the calculation involves 11 separate stages, some of which are recursively dependent on others.
* The introduction of IR35 combined with its complexity and ambiguity, led many freelancers into a number of Tax Planning schemes that led to a further loss of revenue to HMRC.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} however over the recent years these tax planning schemes have been closed down by HMRC.
In May 2017, NHS Improvement backtracked on previous guidance that all NHS agency and locum workers would be included in the IR35 taxation laws. The new guidance stated that NHS organisations should assess employees on a "case by case basis" &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://nursingnotes.co.uk/government-u-turns-ir35-tax-rules/|title=Government backtracks on IR35 taxation rules for healthcarestaff|date=2017-05-31|work=NursingNotes|access-date=2017-06-01|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Many NHS locums such as nurses, physiotherapists and doctors below consultant level in the NHS are automatically deemed to be employees. Many workers in the social services sector also supply their services through their own limited companies which would be considered disguised employment by HMRC.

==Effectiveness==
It is hard to judge the effectiveness of the legislation, since as of 2010 the UK [[Inland Revenue]] have not published any figures. On 6 January 2004 [[Dawn Primarolo]] was asked in Parliament how many investigations under the IR35 regulation have (a) been initiated, (b) resulted in additional revenue and (c) been concluded without securing additional revenue. In a written answer she replied that it was not possible with any accuracy to isolate data relating solely to this legislation.&lt;ref name=Hansard6Jan04&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200304/cmhansrd/vo040106/text/40106w03.htm|publisher=[[Hansard]] |date= 6 Jan 2004|title= 6 Jan 2004: Column 224W}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 15 June 2009 in the House of Commons Labour MP [[Terry Rooney]] (Bradford North) asked the Chancellor of the Exchequer "how many investigations concerning IR35 were launched in each of the last five years; and how many of them resulted in (a) prosecution, (b) an increase in tax due and (c) no further action". [[Kitty Ussher]] speaking for the Chancellor replied, "The intermediaries legislation, commonly known as 'IR35', was introduced with effect from 6 April 2000 to counter the avoidance of employed levels of tax and national insurance by individuals providing their services through intermediaries. Disclosure of HM Revenue and Customs' compliance data relating to the legislation would result in a risk of non-compliance with the legislation. Accordingly I am not able to provide the data requested."&lt;ref&gt;[https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200809/cmhansrd/cm090615/text/90615w0012.htm#09061531000015 Hansard 15 June 2009 : Column 53W ]&lt;/ref&gt; The July 2009 issue of ''IT Now'', the [[British Computer Society]] magazine, reported that between April 2002 and March 2008 the Government had raised £9.2 million under IR35 legislation compared to the £220 million that it was initially expected.&lt;ref&gt;''IT Now'' - Vol 51, Part 4 - [[British Computer Society]], Swindon - {{ISSN|1746-5702}} - July 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revenue raised==
The initial regulatory impact assessment for IR35 in 1999 stated that HMRC expected the measure to generate £220 million per year in National Insurance contributions, and a further £80 million in income tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/ria/amendedria.pdf | title = The Welfare Reform and Pensions Bill Regulatory Impact Statement - National Insurance: Service Provision Through Intermediaries | date = October 1999 | work = Inland Revenue | accessdate=2010-07-13}} National Insurance figure is at the top of page 5, overall revenue is in paragraph numbered 41 on page 12, from which the tax figure of £80 million has been derived by subtracting £220 million National Insurance&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 Jan 2004 Dawn Primarolo was asked by the [[Shadow Cabinet|Shadow]] [[Paymaster General]] [[Mark Prisk]] MP about additional revenue secured from investigations under IR35. She replied that "Establishing whether or not the intermediaries legislation applies is undertaken as part of the Inland Revenue's Employer Compliance Review programme. As such it is not possible with any accuracy to isolate data relating solely to this legislation." She gave a similar answer when asked about administration and employment costs.&lt;ref name=Hansard6Jan04/&gt;

In May 2009 the Professional Contractors Group received a reply to a request under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] to HMRC, asking just how much tax revenue IR35 had in fact raised for the exchequer. The FOI reply revealed that in the tax years 2002/03 to 2007/08, IR35 directly raised just £9.2 million. This equates to an average of around only £1.5 million per tax year, less than 1% of the expected amount. It is not clear whether this includes the NI contribution, or is just income tax.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/05/22/ir35_tax_revenues/ The Register]&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011 a [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]] request revealed that the number of cases reviewed had fallen from 158 (year ending April 2007) to 12 in year ending April 2010 and 23 in year ending April 2011. The same document also gives the "tax yield received for the requested years" as having fallen from £1,906,619 to £219,180.  No details are given for the costs of the investigations or the costs of collecting the tax. It is not clear whether this figure relates to the revenue raised from investigations, or the total revenue from IR35. No figures were given for the cost of administrating the tax, or the cost of the investigations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/freedom/ir35-status-enqs.htm HMRC website]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Industrial management''', as a field of [[business administration]], studies the structure and organization of [[Industry|industrial]] companies. It comprises those fields of business administration that are necessary for the success of companies within the [[manufacturing]] sector and the encompassing services (primarily [[operations management]], [[marketing]], and [[financial management]]).

== Term industrial company ==
The term industrial company is generally applied to a manufacturing firm that – contrary to a crafts business – produces consumer durables in [[Factory|factories]] from raw materials in mass and serial production ([[division of labour]]) using modern manufacturing machines.

== History of industrial management ==
The precursor of the study field industrial management was [[factory]] management. It had a strong similarity with technical [[Business administration|management]] and was geared towards the engineering fields. Parallel to this, there was also a factory management that was more in the area of business economics. This dealt with the organizational questions of factory and [[office administration]] as well as financial [[accounting]], e.g. the factory [[bookkeeping]] and late also [[management accounting]].

The term and the contents of present-day industrial management were strongly influenced by the establishment of MIT School of Industrial Management in 1952 (renamed the [[MIT Sloan School of Management|Sloan School of Management]] in 1964 after its benefactor, Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., MIT graduate and then-chairman of General Motors). MIT School of Industrial Management set itself the goal of educating the "ideal manager" through this (post)graduate management program.

== Course of studies ==
Graduate programs in industrial management draw on Sloan’s idea and provide engineers with a strategic management education with a focus on production management, marketing, financial management, human resources as well as commercial law – supplemented by [[corporate governance]], [[corporate social responsibility]] and [[sustainability]] topics. The primary goal is to enable students and professionals to take a holistic approach to industry management.

Most graduate studies in industrial management are full-time [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] degree programs that, in addition to a preferably engineering bachelor’s degree, also require several years of professional experience. In general, students spend the first year of their degree acquiring both a working knowledge of management functions and the analytical skills needed to practice them. After the second year, students usually seek internships and pursue elective courses, which often go towards a specialization in their master’s thesis.

Study programs in industrial management are very popular in economies with a high value of manufacturing output, such as the United States and Germany. Especially German research universities incorporate a large number of advanced courses in engineering in their graduate program in industrial management and are, thus, more like [[Master of Engineering|M.Eng.-]] programs. On the other hand, U.S. universities and [[Vocational university|universities of applied sciences]] in Germany offer MBA programs in industrial management that follow more the original idea of Sloan and emphasize hands-on application of theory.

Indian institutes such as National Institute of Industrial Engineering (NITIE) Mumbai, offers two year full time residential course PGDIM - Post Graduate Diploma in Industrial Management which is equivalent to MBA.

'''The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India''' ('''ICAI''') is the  national [[professional accounting body]] of [[India]]. It was established on 1 July 1949 as a [[statutory body]] under the [[Chartered Accountants Act, 1949]] enacted by the [[Parliament]] (acting as the provisional [[Parliament of India]]) to regulate the profession of [[Chartered Accountancy]] in India. ICAI is the second largest professional Accounting &amp; Finance body in the world. ICAI is the only licensing cum [[Regulatory agency|regulating body]] of the [[financial audit]] and [[accountancy]] profession in India. It recommends the [[accounting standards]] to be followed by companies in India to [[National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards|National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards (NACAS)]]. and sets the accounting standards to be followed by other types of organisations. ICAI is solely responsible for setting the Standards on Auditing (SAs) to be followed in the [[financial audit|audit]] of [[financial statements]] in India. It also issues other technical standards like [[Standards on Internal Audit]] (SIA), [[Corporate Affairs Standards]] (CAS) etc. to be followed by practicing Chartered Accountants. It works closely with the [[Government of India]], [[Reserve Bank of India]] and the [[Securities and Exchange Board of India]] in formulating and enforcing such standards.

Members of the Institute are known as ''Chartered Accountants''. However, the word chartered does not refer to or flow from any [[Royal Charter]]. Chartered Accountants are subject to a published [[Code of Ethics]] and professional standards, violation of which is subject to disciplinary action. Only a member of ICAI can be appointed as statutory auditor of a company under the [[Companies Act, 2013]]. The management of the Institute is vested with its Council with the president acting as its Chief Executive Authority. A person can become a member of ICAI by taking prescribed examinations and undergoing three years of practical training. The membership course is well known for its rigorous standards. ICAI has entered into [[mutual recognition agreement]]s with other professional accounting bodies worldwide for reciprocal membership recognition.
ICAI is one of the founder members of the [[International Federation of Accountants]] (IFAC), [[South Asian Federation of Accountants]] (SAFA), and [[Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants]] (CAPA). ICAI was formerly the provisional jurisdiction for [[XBRL International]] in India. In 2010, it promoted eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) India as a section 25 company (now section 8 of Companies Act, 2013) to take over this responsibility from it. Now, eXtensible Business Reporting Language (XBRL) India is an established jurisdiction of XBRL International Inc.

The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India was established under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 passed by the Parliament of India with the objective of regulating accountancy profession in India.&lt;ref name="act"&gt;Act No. XXXVIII of 1949. See  [http://www.mca.gov.in/Ministry/actsbills/pdf/The_Chartered_Accountants_Act_2006.pdf "Chartered Accountants Act 1949 as amended in 2006"]&lt;/ref&gt; ICAI is the third largest professional accounting body in the world in terms of membership only to the ACCA and [[AICPA]].&lt;ref&gt;Ranking of Accountancy bodies as per [http://worldranking.blogspot.com/2009/08/top-professional-accountancy-bodies.html World Ranking Guide Blog]&lt;/ref&gt; It prescribes the qualifications for a Chartered Accountant, conducts the requisite examinations and grants license in the form of [[Professional certification|Certificate of Practice]]. Apart from this primary function, it also helps various government agencies like [[Reserve Bank of India|RBI]], [[Securities and Exchange Board of India|SEBI]],{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} [[Ministry of Corporate Affairs (India)|MCA]], [[Comptroller and Auditor General of India|CAG]], [[Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority|IRDA]], etc. in policy formulation. ICAI actively engages itself in aiding and advising economic policy formulation. For example, It has submitted its suggestions on the Companies Bill, 2009. It also examines the various taxation laws, rules, regulations, circulars, notifications, etc. which may be enacted or issued by the Government from time to time and to send suitable memoranda containing suggestions for improvements in the respective legislation. The government also takes the suggestions of ICAI as expert advice and considers it favorably. ICAI presented an approach paper on issues in implementing Goods and Service Tax in India to the [[Minister of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]]. In response to this, [[Minister of Finance (India)|Ministry of Finance]] has suggested that ICAI take a lead and help the government in implementing [[Goods and Services Tax (India)|Goods and Services Tax]] (GST).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Finmin eyes ICAI role in GST roll-out|url=http://www.financialexpress.com/news/finmin-eyes-icai-role-in-gst-rollout/330443/|accessdate=10 February 2011|newspaper=The Financial Express|date=3 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is because of this active participation in formulation economic legislation, it has been designated by A. P. J. Abdul Kalam as a "''Partner in Nation Building''".
Nonetheless, with the advent of globalisation and foreign investment, in India, ACCA has constantly gained ground and is currently, standing as tough competition to the ICAI, even though negotiations have been made in the past.

==International Affiliations==

ICAI is a founder member of the [[International Federation of Accountants]](IFAC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Founding Members of IFAC|url=http://www.ifac.org/History/founding_member_bodies.php|publisher=International Federation of Accountants|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Asian Federation of Accountants]] (SAFA),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of SAFA Member Institutions |url=http://www.esafa.org/About/MemberMain.aspx |publisher=South Asian Federation of Accountants |accessdate=14 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110124135616/http://www.esafa.org/About/MemberMain.aspx |archivedate=24 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants]] (CAPA) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Members of CAPA from India|url=http://www.capa.com.my/section.cfm?id=24|publisher=Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants|accessdate=14 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915140531/http://www.capa.com.my/section.cfm?id=24|archivedate=15 September 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and International Innovation Network (IIN). ICAI is an Associate member of the Chartered Accountants Worldwide, Member of International Valuation Standards Council (IVSC).

==Motto and mission==
[[Image:CAlogo.jpg|thumb|200px|New CA Logo for exclusive use by Chartered Accountants]]
The [[motto]] of the ICAI is '''''Ya Aeshu Suptaeshu Jagruti''''' [Sanskrit].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icai.org/new_post.html?post_id=163&amp;c_id=192]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[motto]] literally means "a person who is awake in those that sleep". It is a [[quotation]] from the [[Upanishads]] (Kathopanishad). It was given to the ICAI at the time of its formation in 1949 by [[Sri Aurobindo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=ICAI Logo was conceptualised by Sri Aurobindo|journal=The Chartered Accountant|date=July 2006|volume=55|issue=01|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a part of its emblem. CA. C. S. Shastri, a Chartered Accountant from [[Chennai]] went to Sri Aurobindo and requested him through a letter to give an emblem to the newly formed Institute of which he was an elected member from the [[Southern India]]. In reply to this request, Sri Aurobindo gave him the emblem with a [[Garuda]], the [[Hindu Mythology|mythical]] eagle in the centre and a quotation from the Upanishad:Ya Aeshu Suptaeshu Jagruti. The emblem along with the motto was placed at the first meeting of the Council of the Institute and was accepted amongst many other emblems placed by other members of the Council.

Apart from its emblem, ICAI also has a separate logo for its members. As a part of a brand building exercise, ICAI introduced this separate new CA logo for the use of its members in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New logo for Indian CAs – an initiative in brand building|url=http://www.labnol.org/india/knowledge/new-logo-for-indian-cas-an-initiative-in-brand-building/771/|publisher=Digital Inspiration|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo is free for use by all members of ICAI subject to certain conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidelines to use CA Logo|url=http://www.icai.org/resource_file/9061announ1040.pdf|publisher=ICAI|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logo was launched by the then Minister of Corporate Affairs, [[Prem Chand Gupta]] at the occasion of the Chartered Accountant Day (1 July) in the presence of the then President of ICAI Sunil Talati. Members of ICAI cannot use the ICAI emblem, but they are encouraged to use the CA logo instead on their official stationery.

The Mission of the ICAI as stated by it is: “The Indian Chartered Accountancy profession will be the Valued Trustees of World Class Financial Competencies, Good Governance and Competitiveness.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mission of ICAI |url=http://www.esafa.org/About/MemberMain.aspx |work=Member details |publisher=South Asian Federation of Accountants |accessdate=9 February 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009141024/http://www.esafa.org/About/MemberMain.aspx |archivedate=9 October 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Image:GDA Certificate.png|thumb|200px|Government Diploma in Accountancy Certificate]]
The Companies Act, 1913 passed in [[British Raj|pre-independent India]] prescribed various books which had to be maintained by a Company registered under that Act. It also required the appointment of a formal [[Auditor]] with prescribed qualifications to audit such records. In order to act as an auditor a person had to acquire a restricted certificate from the local government upon such conditions as may be prescribed. The holder of a restricted certificate was allowed to practice only within the province of issue and in the language specified in the restricted certificate. In 1918 a course called Government Diploma in Accountancy was launched in Bombay (now known as [[Mumbai]]). On passing this diploma and completion of three years of articled training under an approved accountant, a person was held eligible for grant of an unrestricted certificate. This certificate entitled the holder to practice as an auditor throughout India. Later on the issue of restricted certificates was discontinued in the year 1920.

In the year 1930 it was decided that the [[Government of India]] should maintain a register called the Register of Accountants. Any person whose name was entered in such register was called a ''Registered Accountant''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Accountancy Profession in India|year=1973|isbn=978-0-439-41111-0|author=G.P.Kapadia}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later on a board called the Indian Accountancy Board was established to advise the [[Governor General of India]] on accountancy and the qualifications for auditors. However it was felt that the accountancy profession was largely unregulated, and this caused lots of confusion as regards the qualifications of auditors.
Hence in the year 1948, just after [[Partition of India|independence in 1947]], an expert committee was created to look into the matter.&lt;ref&gt;Government of India Notification No.22-A(8)47 dated 1 May 1948. Copy of the notification available in page 28, July 2010 edition of The Chartered Accountant journal&lt;/ref&gt; This expert committee recommended that a separate [[autonomous]] association of accountants should be formed to regulate the profession. The Government of India accepted the recommendation and passed the Chartered Accountants Act in 1949 even before India became a republic. Under section 3 of the said Act, ICAI is established as a [[body corporate]] with [[perpetual succession]] and a [[Company seal|common seal]].

Unlike most other [[Commonwealth of Nations|commonwealth countries]], the word chartered does not refer to a [[royal charter]], since India is a republic. At the time of passing the Chartered Accountants Act, various titles used for similar professionals in other countries were considered, such as [[Certified Public Accountant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Against Discrimination: Struggle for the Designation of Chartered|journal=The Chartered Accountant|date=July 2010|volume=59|series=1|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many accountants had already acquired membership of the [[Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales]] and other Chartered Societies of Great Britain and were practising as Chartered Accountants. This had created some sort of brand value. This designation inherited a public impression that Chartered Accountants had better qualifications than Registered Accountants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Against Discrimination: Struggle for the Designation of Chartered|journal=The Chartered Accountant|date=July 2010|volume=59|series=1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hence the accountants were very stern in their stand that, the Indian accountancy professionals should be designated only as Chartered Accountants. After much debate in the [[Indian Constituent Assembly]], the controversial term, chartered was accepted. When the [[Chartered Accountants Act, 1949]] came into force on 1 July 1949, the term [[Chartered Accountant]] superseded the title of Registered Accountant. This day is celebrated as Chartered Accountants day every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CA Day: Chartered Accountants Day India Celebrations July 1|url=http://www.weeksupdate.com/2009/07/ca-day-chartered-accountants-day-india.html|publisher=Weeksupdate.com|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Membership==
Members of the Institute are known as Chartered Accountants. Becoming a member requires passing the prescribed examinations, three years of practical training (known as [[articled clerk|articleship]]) and meeting other requirements under the Act and Regulations. A member of ICAI can use the title CA before his/her name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Now, chartered accountants can prefix `CA' to their name|url=http://www.thehindubusinessline.in/2006/01/28/stories/2006012801280700.htm|accessdate=10 February 2011|newspaper=The Hindu Business Line|date=27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A member of ICAI may either be an [[Associate Chartered Accountant]] (A.C.A.) or a [[Fellow Chartered Accountant]] (F.C.A.) based on his experience. Further based on holding Certificate of Practice, they may also be classified as practising and non-practicing Chartered Accountants. As of December 2017, the Institute has {{formatnum:2,80,221}} members out of which {{formatnum:1,89,707}} are Associates and 90,514 are Fellows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICAI Key Statistics|url=http://220.227.161.86/30987key-statistics.pdf|publisher=ICAI|accessdate=27 March 2015}}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The B.N. Chaturvedi Family is credited to be the only family in India to be Chartered Accountants in 5 Generations. [https://resource.cdn.icai.org/9933578-579.pdf]

===Associates and fellows===
Any person who is granted membership of the Institute becomes an Associate Chartered Accountant and is entitled to use the letters A.C.A. after his name. Generally, associates are members of the Institute with less than 5 years of membership after which they become entitled to apply for being a fellow member. Some associate members, particularly those not in practice, often voluntarily chose not to apply to be a fellow due to a variety of reasons.

An associate member who has been in continuous practice in India or has worked for a commercial or government organisation for at least five years and meets other conditions as prescribed can apply to the Institute to get designated as a "Fellow". A fellow Chartered Accountant is entitled to use the letters FCA. after his name. Responsibilities and voting rights of both types of members remain the same but only fellows can be elected to the Council and Regional Councils of ICAI.  Fellows are perceived as enjoying a higher status due to their longer professional experience.

=== Practicing Chartered Accountants. ===
Any member wanting to engage in public practice has to first apply for and obtain a ''Certificate of Practice'' from the Council of ICAI.&lt;ref&gt;Section 6 of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 provides, "No member of the Institute shall be entitled to practise (whether in India or elsewhere) unless he has obtained from the Council a certificate of practice".&lt;/ref&gt; Only members holding a Certificate of Practice may act as auditors or certify documents required by various tax and financial regulatory authorities in India. Once a member obtains a Certificate of Practice, his responsibility to the society increases manifold. The ethical principles applicable to a practising CA provided in first and second schedule of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 are more rigorous than the ones applicable to non-practicing CAs or both.

In India an individual Chartered Accountant, a [[Partnership|firm]] or a [[Limited liability partnership|Limited Liability Partnership]] of Chartered Accountants can practice the profession of Chartered Accountancy.[https://www.charteredclub.com/cas-forming-llps-now-allowed-to-become-statutory-auditors/]

==Role of Chartered Accountants==
Chartered Accountants enjoy a [[statutory monopoly]] in audit of financial statements under the Companies Act, 2013, [[Indian Income Tax Act, 1961|Income Tax Act, 1961]] and various other statutes in India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mca.gov.in/Ministry/actsbills/pdf/Companies_Act_1956_Part_1.pdf Section 226(1)] of Companies Act, 2013 requires that an auditor be a Charterednt.&lt;/ref&gt; Financial statements audited by a [http://www.certicom.in chartered accountant] are presumed to have been prepared according to [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] in India (otherwise the [[audit report]] should be modified). However, not all Chartered Accountants work in audit. Firms of accountants provide varied business services, and many accountants are employed in commerce and industry.  Their areas of expertise include [[Financial Reporting]], [[Financial Audit|Auditing and Assurance]], [[Corporate Finance]], [[Investment Banking, Financial Modelling]], [[Equity Research]]. [[Fund Management]], [[Credit Analysis]], [[Capital Markets]], [[Arbitration]], [[Risk Management]], [[Economics]], [[Strategic/Management Consultancy]], [[Management Accounting]], [[Information Systems Audit]], [[Corporate Law]], [[Direct Tax]], [[Indirect Tax]] and [[valuation (finance)|valuation of businesses]]..{{citation needed|date=June 2011}}{{importance inline|date=June 2011}} Apart from the field of professional practice, many CAs work in the industry and commerce in financial and general management positions such as CFO and CEO.

==Council of the Institute==
[[Image:ICAI Regional Councils.png|thumb|200px|[[Map]] of [[India]] showing the [[jurisdiction]]s of the five Regional Councils of ICAI]]
The management of the affairs of the Institute is undertaken by a Council constituted under the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949.&lt;ref name="act"/&gt; The Council consists of 32 elected fellow members and up to 8 members nominated by the [[Government of India]]. The elected members of the council are elected under the [[single transferable vote]] system by the members of the institute. The Council is re-elected every 3 years. The Council elects two of its members to be president and vice-president who hold office for one year. The president is the chief executive Authority of the Council.&lt;ref&gt;Section 12(2) of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 provides, "The President shall be the chief executive Authority of the Council"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidents===
ICAI's first president was CA G.P. Kapadia (1949 to 1952). CA Naveen N. D. Gupta is the current president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India (ICAI) has elected CA. 12|url=http://pib.nic.in/newsite/erelease.aspx?relid=92187|publisher=Press Information Bureau, Government of India|accessdate=14 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=List of Presidents of India|url=http://www.icai.org/new_post.html?post_id=220|publisher=Institute of Chartered Accountants of India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Code of Ethics ==
The Institute has a detailed code of ethics and actions in contravention of such code results in disciplinary action against the erring members. The Institute publishes a Members Hand book containing the Chartered Accountants Act 1949, [[Chartered Accountants Regulation 1988]], Professional Opportunities for Members – an Appraisal, Code of Ethics and Manual for members. These together form the basis of regulation of the profession. The Council also has a [[Peer Review Board]] that ensures that in carrying out their professional attestation services assignments, the members of the Institute (a) comply with the Technical Standards laid down by the Institute and (b) have in place proper systems (including documentation systems) for maintaining the quality of the attestation services work they perform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Code of Ethics|date=January 2009|publisher=The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|isbn=978-81-8441-180-5|page=365|url=http://www.icai.org/resource_file/20238code_of_ethics-2009.pdf|edition=11th|accessdate=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disciplinary process ==
The Disciplinary Directorate, the Board of [[Discipline]], and the Disciplinary [[Committee]] form the foundation of the disciplinary process of the Institute. These [[entity|entities]] are [[quasi-judicial]] and have substantial powers like that of a [[Civil Court]] to [[summon]] and enforce attendance or require discovery and production of documents on [[affidavit]] or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Section 21C of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949&lt;/ref&gt; The Disciplinary Directorate is headed by an officer designated as Director ([[Discipline]]). On receipt of any information or [[complaint]] that a member has allegedly engaged in any [[misconduct]], the Director (Discipline) shall arrive at a [[prima facie]] [[opinion]] whether or not there is any misconduct. If the Director (Discipline) is of the opinion that the misconduct is covered by the items listed in the first schedule of the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949, he shall refer the case to the Board of Discipline. If he is of the Opinion that the case is covered by the Second Schedule or both schedules of the CA Act, he will refer the case to the Disciplinary Committee. If the Board of Discipline finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the register of members for up to three months or impose a fine up to {{INR}}1,00,000/-. If the Disciplinary Committee finds a member guilty of professional or other misconduct, it may at its discretion reprimand the member, remove the name of the member from the register of members permanently or impose a fine up to {{INR}}5,000/-.  Any member aggrieved by any order may approach the [[Appeal|Appellate]] Authority.

It should be born in mind that this disciplinary proceeding is not in lieu of or alternative for criminal proceedings in a court. Criminal proceedings against a Chartered Accountant and disciplinary action by ICAI are two separate issues and one need not wait for another to be completed first.&lt;ref&gt;As decided in case law: Talluri Srinivas Vs. The Institute Of Chartered Accountants of India 2010 (174) DLT 537 by the Delhi High Court with reference to the [[Mahindra Satyam|Satyam Computer Services Limited]] scam&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Recent actions ===
One of the most recent (2009–10) public actions of The ICAI Disciplinary Committee was proceedings for professional misconduct against two auditors from the firm [[Price Waterhouse]] partners for wrongly auditing and inflating the financial statements of [[Mahindra Satyam|Satyam Computer Services Limited]]. The [[Supreme Court of India]] (November 2010) rejected a plea by the two charged auditors to stay the proceedings by the ICAI Disciplinary committee. The court's order came in response to the pleas of the charged auditors seeking a stay on the disciplinary proceedings against  them on the ground that it violated their [[Fundamental rights|fundamental right]] against self-incrimination under Article 20 (3) of the [[Constitution of India]].

Other publicized actions included, the [[SEBI]] referred case of brokerage firm, [[Karvy]], in which the internal auditors, Haribhakti &amp; Co (an associate of BDO). were held guilty of negligence for failing to detect thousands of demat accounts being opened with the same address. The Committee has also taken action against members for alleged irregularities in the books of [[Maytas]] Properties and Maytas Infra and the role played by their auditors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Maytas fraud to be probed |url=http://www.deccanchronicle.com/city/maytas-fraud-be-probed-981 |accessdate=14 February 2011 |newspaper=Deccan Chronicle |date=20 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110204025607/http://www.deccanchronicle.com/city/maytas-fraud-be-probed-981 |archivedate=4 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The names of the members found guilty of misconduct are published in ICAI's website. The ICAI website lists 35 as the number of cases in which inquiry was completed by the Disciplinary Committee in the past one year since February 2010. The list of members held guilty of professional or other misconduct is published periodically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Persons/Members found guilty under First &amp; Second Schedule.|url=http://www.icai.org/new_post.html?post_id=6400|publisher=The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|accessdate=15 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Request for more power===
Many of the recent financial frauds and scams relate to organisations that had multinational accounting firms as their auditors. These multinational firms cannot legally practice in India but they are practising in India by surrogate means, operating through tie-ups with local firms, though the partners involved are from India, since only a member of the Institute can be an auditor of an Indian entity. The example for this is an elaborate list, Price Waterhouse in case of Global Trust Bank Scam, again Price Waterhouse in Satyam Computer Services Limited scam, Ernst and Young in the Maytas case.  ICAI lacks jurisdictional powers to punish these or for that matter any firm, as under its current regulations it only has the power to proceed against individual members. The Institute has asked the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, Government of India to grant additional powers so that it may proceed against firms whose partners or employees are frequent offenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ICAI to seek power to punish audit firms with govt nod|url=http://www.business-standard.com/india/news/icai-to-seek-power-to-punish-audit-firmsgovt-nod/405728/|accessdate=14 February 2011|newspaper=Business Standard|date=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ICAI also has sent a proposal to the Government of India to amend the Chartered Accountants Act, 1949 in order to enable to it to impose a fine of {{INR}}1,00,00,000/- on audit firms if they are found guilty of colluding with companies to commit a fraud.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=ICAI wants Rs1 crore fine on erring audit firms|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/news-by-industry/services/consultancy-/-audit/icai-wants-rs-1-crore-fine-on-erring-audit-firms/articleshow/7483893.cms|accessdate=14 February 2011|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=12 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After obtaining the certificate the person could designate himself as an ''Accounting Technician''. This Certification was introduced to help a large number of students who were unable to complete the CA Final Examinations and obtain membership'''.(This course is also undergoing changes)'''

ICAI has entered into agreement with [[Indira Gandhi National Open University]], to help CA students acquire a [[Bachelor of Commerce|Bachelor's degree]] by writing  a few papers. For example, a bachelor's degree in Commerce can be obtained from IGNOU with a major in Accounting and Finance provided the student is able to provide the grades received in CPT and IPCC and pass the term end examination conducted by IGNOU. This initiative has helped a lot of students attain both the degrees without any duplication of subjects and credits.

(For details regarding the new scheme and course curriculum, please refer to the Prospectus at the link &lt;nowiki&gt;https://resource.cdn.icai.org/45785bos35964.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;)&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icai.org/post.html?post_id=10259|title=ICAI - The Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|website=ICAI|access-date=2016-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership through MRA===

The Institute maintains a placement portal on its web site for qualified members and partially qualified students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.placement.icai.org/ Placement portal] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160320115748/http://www.placement.icai.org/ |date=20 March 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is supplemented with campus placement events and advertising through its professional journals and website.

In early 2010, the ICAI placed three of its freshly qualified Associates, at a record annual salary of US$160,000 each, at Singapore-based agriculture supply chain major [[Olam International]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chartered Accountant top salary zooms to Rs70 lakh|url=http://articles.economictimes.indiatimes.com/2010-03-06/news/27614623_1_chartered-accountants-campus-recruitment-salary|accessdate=12 March 2011|newspaper=The Economic Times|date=6 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technical standards==
ICAI formulates and issues technical standards to be followed by Chartered Accountants and others. Non-compliance of these standards by the members will lead to disciplinary action against them. The technical standards issued by ICAI includes, Accounting Standards, Engagement and Quality Control Standards, Standards on Internal Audit, Corporate Affairs Standard, Accounting Standards for Local Bodies, etc.

===Accounting Standards {{anchor|Accounting Standards}}===
{{As of|2010}}, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India has issued 32 Accounting Standards. These are numbered AS-1 to AS-7 and AS-9 to AS-32 (AS-8 is no longer in force since it was merged with AS-26).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Accounting Standards issued by the ICAI|url=http://www.icai.org/post.html?post_id=474|publisher=Accounting Standards Board|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Compliance with accounting standards issued by ICAI has become a statutory requirement with the notification of Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006 by the Government of India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mca.gov.in/Ministry/notification/notification_comp_Acct.html Companies (Accounting Standards) Rules, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt; Before the constitution of the [[National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards]] ([[NACAS]]), the institute was the sole accounting standard setter in India. However [[NACAS]] is not an independent body. It can only consider accounting standards recommended by ICAI and advise the Government of India to notify them under the Companies Act, 2013. Further the Accounting Standards so notified are applicable only to companies registered under the companies act, 2013. For all other entities the accounting standards issued the ICAI continue to apply.

====Convergence with IFRS====
{{main|Indian Accounting Standards}}
The inception of the idea of [[Convergence of accounting standards|convergence]] of Indian [[Generally accepted accounting principles|GAAP]] with [[IFRS]] was made by the Prime Minister of India [[Dr. Manmohan Singh]] by committing in [[G20]] to align Indian accounting standards with IFRS. As per the original roadmap for implementation of IFRS-converged Ind AS issued by the Government of India, initially Ind AS were expected to be implemented from the year 2011. However, keeping in view the fact that certain issues including tax issues were still to be addressed, the Ministry of Corporate Affairs decided to postpone the date of implementation of Ind AS. For smooth transition to IFRS, ICAI has taken up the matter of convergence with the [[National Advisory Committee on Accounting Standards]] and various regulators such as the [[Reserve Bank of India|RBI]], [[Securities and Exchange Board of India|SEBI]] and [[Insurance Regulatory and Development Authority|IRDA]], [[Central Board of Direct Taxes|CBDT]]. [[IASB]], the issuer of IFRS, is also supporting the ICAI in its endeavours towards convergence. ICAI has revised/formulated Ind AS on the basis of the amendments and new IFRS issued by the IASB subsequent to February 2011. IFRS-converged Indian Accounting Standards (Ind AS) has been implemented in India in a phased manner from 1 April 2015 being the voluntary date of adoption of Ind AS. The mandatory application of Ind AS has been restricted to listed and unlisted companies with a net worth of Rs. 500 crore and above from the accounting year beginning on or after 1 April 2016.  With effect on 1 April 2017, all listed companies and unlisted companies having net worth of Rs. 250 crore and above would be required to prepare their financial statements in accordance with the applicable Ind AS.  Banks and NBFCs are also required to implement Ind AS on 1 April 2018 onwards based on the criteria of net worth.

In order to ensure that these standards are implemented in the same spirit in which these have been formulated, ICAI has been providing guidance to members through its various initiatives such as issuance of Educational Materials on Ind AS containing Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs). For addressing transition and implementation related queries clarifications on a timely basis are also being issued by the ICAI. Queries raised are also addressed through Support-desk for implementation of Ind AS. Apart from this, Certificate Course on Ind AS, In-house training programmes on Ind AS for corporate and regulatory bodies are also being organised to educate and train the members on these standards

===Engagement and Quality Control Standards {{anchor|Engagement and Quality Control Standards}}===
Engagement and Quality Control Standards comprises the following Standards:
1 Standards on Auditing (SAs), to be applied in the audit of historical financial information. 
2 Standards on Review Engagements (SREs), to be applied in the review of historical financial information. 
3 Standards on Assurance Engagements (SAEs), to be applied in assurance engagements, other than audits and reviews of historical financial information.
4  Standards on Related Services (SRSs), to be applied to engagements involving application of agreed-upon procedures to information, compilation engagements, and other related services engagements, as may be specified by the ICAI.
The aforesaid Standards are collectively known as Engagement Standards.
5. Standards on Quality Control (SQCs) - These Standards are to be applied for all services covered by the Engagement Standards as described above.
{{As of|October 2017}} ICAI has issued 46 Engagement and Quality Control Standards (formerly known as Auditing and Assurance Standards) covering various topics relating to [[financial audit|auditing]] and other engagements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Auditing, Review and Other Standards (formerly known as AAS) – Complete Text|url=http://www.icai.org/post.html?post_id=450&amp;c_id=141|publisher=Auditing and Assurance Standards Board of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of India|accessdate=12 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; These standards have been harmonized with the [[International Standards]] issued by the [[International Auditing and Assurance Standards Board|IAASB]] of the [[International Federation of Accountants|IFAC]] except for two standards i.e. ISA 600 and ISAE 3000 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=D.S.Rawat|title=Students' Guide to Auditing Standards|year=2011|publisher=Taxmann|location=Preface to Fourteenth Edition|isbn=978-81-7194-826-0|pages=I-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''J. Paul Getty Trust''' is one of world's wealthiest art institutions with an estimated endowment in 2017 of [[United States dollar|$US]]&amp;nbsp;6.9 billion.&lt;ref name="Endowment"&gt;Getty Trust Fiscal Year Endowment, http://www.getty.edu/about/governance/pdfs/fyendowment.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  Based in [[Los Angeles, California]], it operates the [[J. Paul Getty Museum]], which has two locations, the [[Getty Center]] in Los Angeles and the [[Getty Villa]] in [[Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles|Pacific Palisades]] district of [[Los Angeles, California]]. Its other programs are the [[Getty Foundation]], the [[Getty Research Institute]], and the [[Getty Conservation Institute]].

With an estimated 1.6 million visitors per year, the trust operates one of the most visited museums in the United States. The trust also provides grants and training to other museums and cultural institutions. The trust has a library, publications program and visiting scholar program. The trust's conservation program is dedicated to advancing conservation practice through the creation and delivery of knowledge. However, since 2008, the trust has scaled back the scope of its activities in response to financial challenges.

==History==
The J. Paul Getty Museum Trust was established by oilman [[J. Paul Getty]] in 1953. Getty founded the [[Getty Oil]] Company, and in 1957 ''[[Fortune (magazine)|Fortune]]'' magazine named him the [[Wealthiest Americans (1957)|richest living American]].&lt;ref&gt;List of 76 said to hold above 75 millions. ''New York Times'', October 28, 1957.&lt;/ref&gt; At his death, he was worth more than $2 billion.&lt;ref name=Lenzner&gt;Lenzner, Robert. ''The great Getty: the life and loves of J. Paul Getty, richest man in the world''. New York: Crown Publishers, 1985. {{ISBN|0-517-56222-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Getty died in 1976&lt;ref name=NYTobit&gt;Whitman, Alden. [https://www.nytimes.com/learning/general/onthisday/bday/1215.html J. Paul Getty dead at 83; amassed billions from oil.] ''New York Times'', June 6, 1976. Retrieved September 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and left the bulk of his estate, including nearly $660 million worth of stock in [[Getty Oil]], to the J. Paul Getty Museum Trust. Legal conflicts over the will took years to resolve, but in 1982 the trust finally received Getty's full [[bequest]]. The trust began to add a number of new programs in 1982, and in February 1983, it petitioned the court to change its name to the J. Paul Getty Trust.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Russell, House of Getty (London: BBC Audiobooks America, 1987); ARTnews, April 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 [[Barry Munitz]] was named the president and CEO of the trust.&lt;ref&gt;Vince Stehle, "New View From the Top of the Art World's Hill,' ''The Chronicle of Philanthropy'', October 22, 1998, pp. 9–10.&lt;/ref&gt; He began work in January 1998, succeeding [[Harold M. Williams]], the first [[president]] of the Getty Trust, who oversaw construction of the $1 billion [[Getty Center]] designed by architect [[Richard Meier]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurt Andersen, "A City on a Hill," ''The New Yorker'', September 29, 1997, pp. 66–72.&lt;/ref&gt;  With an endowment of $4.2 billion, the Getty Trust is the wealthiest art institution in the world.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;Edward Wyatt, "Getty Fees and Budget Reassessed," ''The New York TImes'', April 30, 2009, p. C1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Early in his tenure, Munitz reorganized the Getty Trust, closing two of the institution's six programs—the Getty Information Institute and the Getty Education Institute. To deal with long-run financial issues, he sought to cultivate relationships with donors and corporate partners. His leadership became increasingly controversial as the Getty Trust was embroiled in numerous controversies relating to the [[provenance]] of various [[antiquities]] in the Getty Museum's collections and Munitz' expense account. In the midst of an investigation by the California Attorney General,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Munitz resigned in 2006 and was forced to "forgo his severance package of more than $2 million, and reimburse the Getty Trust for $250,000 after alleged improprieties including lavish expense account spending."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Filler, "The Getty: For Better and Worse." ''The New York Review of Books'', November 16, 2006, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 4, 2006, the trust announced the hiring of art historian [[James N. Wood]], the former Director of the [[Art Institute of Chicago]], as the trust's new president and CEO, replacing Barry Munitz, who was forced to step down earlier in the year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,958526,00.html The Big Payoff], ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/12/04/AR2006120400940.html Wood to Take Over J. Paul Getty Trust], ''[[The Washington Post]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, after a substantial drop in the trust's assets, Wood cut nearly 100 employees at the trust's various operations, most at the Getty Museum. Fees for parking at the museum and the [[Getty Villa]] were raised by 50% to $15.&lt;ref&gt;Wyatt, Ed.

The '''Jasmine''' family is an [[United States|American]] family notable for its entrepreneurial endeavors in the [[Northeastern United States|U.S. Northeast]].{{Cn|date=January 2015}}  The family garnered modest prominence through its business as the major distributor of fresh produce in [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] era [[New York City]].  Until the 1920s, the Jasmine food goods trade became an innovator in using the railroads to carry produce, preserved foods, and wine from [[California]] to markets and vendors in the [[Tri-State Region|New York tri-state area]].  Most early Jasmine family interests were sold and incorporated into [[the Great Atlantic and Pacific Tea Company]] in 1899, allowing that company to vastly expand its holdings and stores in the [[New York metropolitan area]].  Since the 1920s, the Jasmine family has been involved in philanthropy, including support for [[Catholic schools]] and education.{{Cn|date=January 2015}}

==History==
The progenitor of the Jasmines in the United States was Gaetano Jasmine.{{Cn|date=January 2015}}  Upon arrival in America, Jasmine stayed briefly in [[Harford County, Maryland|Harford County]] at the insistence of [[Henry Tighlman Paca]], a descendant of [[William Paca]], before setting out for [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]] where he began to organize his food trade.  After the war, he became a [[citizenship|citizen]] and settled on East 89th Street in New York's [[Upper East Side]].{{Cn|date=January 2015}}

===The Twentieth Century===
The family has declined in prominence as it has become widely scattered and disunited in the [[Northeastern United States]] and throughout the country.{{Cn|date=January 2015}}

Norman W. Schwebius, a relative of the Jasmine family by marriage, owned and operated the last [[Bridgeport, New Jersey]] carriage shop and fittings factory for vehicles intended as an industry alternative to the automobile until 1935.{{Cn|date=January 2015}}

[[Baron]] '''Johan August Gripenstedt''' (11 August 1813 – 13 July 1874) was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] businessman and politician. During his political career, Gripenstedt was a member of the Swedish [[Riksdag of the Estates|Estates Assembly]] (as a representative of the [[nobility]]) from 1840 to 1848, [[Minister without Portfolio]] from 1848 to 1856, [[Minister for Finance (Sweden)|Minister for Finance]] from 1856 to 1866, and [[Parliament of Sweden|Member of Parliament]] from 1867 to 1873. He is best known for his ten years tenure as Minister for Finance, during which he introduced many [[Economic liberalism|liberal economic]] reforms and fought for issues such as [[free trade]] and state owned railways.

== Early life and military career ==
Johan August Gripenstedt was born in the [[Holstein|Duchy of Holstein]], then part of the [[German Confederation]], where his parents lived at the time. His father Jakob Gripenstedt was a retired [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]. His mother Helena Kristina (née Weinschenck) was the daughter of a German physician. The Gripenstedt family's earliest descendandt was a man named Hieronimus Berger, born in the [[Courland]] region of modern-day [[Latvia]], who immigrated to Sweden and was [[Ennoblement|ennobled]] with name Gripenstedt in 1691.

Johan August Gripenstedt came to Sweden with his family at the age of four. He grew up at the estate of [[Gräfsnäs]] in [[Västergötland]] and later, when the estate's [[fee tail]] ended following his uncle's death in 1821, at the nearby estate of [[Holmängen]]. Gripenstedt and his brothers were educated at home, and following his examination in the spring of 1827 he was registered at [[Uppsala University]]. However, Gripenstedt's plans for a civilian career promptly changed and in 1828 he left the university for the [[Military Academy Karlberg|Royal War Academy]] in [[Stockholm]]. After completing his education at the Royal War Academy, Gripenstedt became a [[Second Lieutenant]] at the [[Göta Artillery Regiment]] in [[Gothenburg]], in 1831. Following further education at the Marieberg Upper Military School from 1832 to 1835, Gripenstedt was in 1837 promoted to the rank of Lieutenant and, in 1841, to the rank of [[Artillery Staff Officer]]. At this time however, Gripenstedt had already started a new career as a politician. In 1846 he was at his own request released from military service.

== Politics and entrepreneurship ==
Gripenstedt first entered politics as a representative of the [[Swedish nobility|nobility]] at the [[Riksdag of the Estates|Riksdag]] of 1840–1841. He soon distinguished himself as a skillful speaker and was elected to the parliament's [[Committee on the Accords (Swedish Riksdag)|Committee on the Accords]] ({{lang-sv|bevillningsutskottet}}). Through his marriage into the [[Anckarswärd family]] in 1842, Gripenstedt became affiliated with the "liberal landowners'"-faction of the parliament, led by [[Carl Henrik Anckarswärd]]. In the end of 1841, Gripenstedt was elected to the parliament's powerful [[Committee on the Constitution (Swedish Riksdag)|Committee on the Constitution]], which at this time worked on a new representative reform. As opposed to the conservative group of the parliament, Gripenstedt was a strong adherent of [[Election#Difficulties with elections|free elections]] and [[general suffrage]] long before this was realized in Sweden. During start of the Riksdag of 1847, Gripenstedt was elected to the [[Committee of the State (Swedish Riksdag)|Committee of the State]].

As a trustee of Carl Henrik Anckarswärd, and later as the owner of estates such as [[Nynäs Castle]] in [[Södermanland]], Gripenstedt became a successful entrepreneur within the grain exports and iron industry.

In 1848 Gripenstedt was selected, to many's surprise, by King [[Oscar I of Sweden|Oscar I]] to serve as [[Minister without Portfolio]] ({{lang-sv|konsultativt statsråd}}) in his cabinet. The post was first offered to the conservative [[Jacob Nils Tersmeden]], who declined, and King Oscar wanted to rejuvenate his cabinet why he selected Gripenstedt instead. Gripenstedt also served as acting [[Minister for Finance (Sweden)|Minister for Finance]] from 10 January to 21 October 1851. On 28 May 1856 he was appointed as (permanent) Minister for Finance. Influenced by French liberal thinkers such as [[Alexis de Tocqueville]] and [[Frédéric Bastiat]], Gripenstedt was a leading proponent of [[free trade]] and other liberal reforms. He succeeded in getting the Swedish parliament to gradually abolish [[tariff]]s and reduce customs duties. In 1865 he signed trade agreements with France, the [[Zollverein|German Customs Union]] and [[Prussia]], which resulted in greatly reduced customs duties on many products. His optimistic descriptions in the Swedish parliament in 1857 of the economic situation of the country, the so-called "flower paintings" ({{lang-sv|blomstermålningarna}}), paved the way for a fast expansion of the [[Rail transport in Sweden|Swedish railroad network]], which was financed by loans on the international market.

Gripenstedt opposed an activist [[foreign policy]], which he saw as a threat to the economic stability of the country. As the [[Denmark|Danish]]-[[German Confederation|German]] conflict over the [[Schleswig-Holstein Question]] grew more tense, Gripenstedt and then [[Prime Minister for Justice]] [[Louis De Geer (1818-1896)|Louis De Geer]] (also a devoted liberal) stopped King [[Charles XV of Sweden|Charles]]' plan for Swedish military support in the [[Second Schleswig War|upcoming war]].

[[Image:Johan August Gripenstedt, Svenska Familj-Journalen.png|thumb|250px|Johan August Gripenstedt]]

Following his retirement as Minister for Finance on 4 July 1866, Gripenstedt served as a member of the [[lower house]] of the new bicameral [[Parliament of Sweden|parliament]] from 1867 to 1873. He died in [[Stockholm]] on 13 July 1874 (aged sixty), following a long period of illness. He is buried at [[Bälinge Church, Uppsala|Bälinge Church]] in [[Södermanland]].

== Family life ==
Gripenstedt married his wife Eva Anckarswärd, the oldest daughter of Colonel [[August Anckarswärd]] and Sofia Ulrika Anckarswärd (née [[Bonde]]), in 1842. Together with his wife he had five children.

== Titles and honours ==
Gripenstedt was elected a member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] ({{lang-sv|Kungliga Vetenskapsakademien}}) in 1858. He was ennobled by King Charles as a [[baron]] ({{lang-sv|friherre}}) on 4 May 1860.

== Legacy ==
Gripenstedt is widely seen as one of the most decisive and influential persons in Swedish political history. As a great speaker and with a good sense of political intrigues and tactics, Gripenstedt was successful in almost everything that he took on. He is not only credited as the one who initiated and guided Sweden's transition to a [[Capitalism|capitalist]] economy, but also as one of the main architects of the "liberal revolution" of the 1800s. His reforms changed Sweden definitely into a new direction of liberalized economy and free trade. These new policies ultimately paved the way for the [[Industrialization of Sweden|Swedish industrialization]]. The period from 1870 to 1970 is commonly referred to in Swedish history as the "[[Hundred Years of Growth]]". During this period Sweden developed from one of the poorest countries in Europe to one of the richest and most prosperous countries in the world.

In the book ''[[Historiens 100 viktigaste svenskar]]'' ("100 Most Important Swedes in History"), written by Niklas Ekdal and Petter Karlsson, Gripenstedt was ranked as the twelfth most important Swede in history.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last1=Ekdal |first1=Niklas |last2=Karlsson |first2=Petter |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Historiens 100 viktigaste svenskar |publisher=Forum |place=[[Stockholm]] |year=2009 |isbn=978-91-37-13402-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Luis Álvarez Renta''' (born April 9, 1950) is a Dominican economist. Álvarez Renta was found liable by a federal jury in [[Miami]] of civil [[racketeering]] and illegal money transfers in a conspiracy to loot [[Baninter]] bank during its final months of existence in 2003, for which Álvarez Renta was ordered to pay $177 million to Dominican authorities in November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Barranco+Kircher+&amp;+Vogelsang+Announces+Luis+Alvarez+Renta+Will+Appeal...-a0138579604  The Free Library]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Luis Rafael Álvarez Renta was born in [[Caracas, Venezuela]]. His father, Virgilio Álvarez Saviñón, was a renowned and wealthy Dominican engineer who had been forced into exile during the dictatorship of [[Rafael Leónidas Trujillo]] in the Dominican Republic. Arriving in Venezuela with twenty dollars and a suitcase, Álvarez Saviñón was able to re-establish his fortune in Venezuela. It was said that in Caracas, "anywhere you looked something had been built by Virgilio Álvarez."

His mother, Thelma Renta, was the sister of fashion designer [[Oscar de la Renta]], and a major social figure in the Dominican Republic in her own right.

Álvarez Renta studied in Venezuela and the Dominican Republic, eventually earning a full scholarship to a Dominican University. He was also able to study in the United States, attending both the [[University of Michigan]] and [[Washington University]] in [[St. Louis]]. His performance in university did not go unnoticed, and he was offered scholarships for graduate work at both [[Cornell University]] in Ithaca, New York, and at the [[MIT Sloan School of Management]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]]. He attended MIT Sloan and received a Masters in Finance. He would later establish a professorship there.

During his early career, Álvarez Renta was offered a number of jobs in the United States. He chose, instead to return to the Dominican Republic. At first, he engaged in the public sector, serving as Sub-Secretary of State for Industry and Commerce, advisor emeritus to the Presidency for Commerce and Finance, and director of CEDOPEX, the oversight agency for Dominican exports.

Having completed his work in the public sector, Álvarez Renta opened his own firm, Luis Álvarez Renta &amp; Asociados, an investment banking firm focused on mergers and acquisitions. For the following thirty-three years, Álvarez Renta was known as the "King Midas" of the Dominican Republic, since his deals always made both sides significant amounts of money. Since the financial sector in the region was underdeveloped, he was often on both sides of a deal, as he was one of the only people in the region with the technical expertise required to process major corporate transactions.

As such, Álvarez Renta essentially created the marketplace for mergers and acquisitions in the Caribbean region, and became very wealthy in the process. An estimate of his wealth made during his divorce case in 2000 placed it at $148 million, although many believed it to be much more than that at the time.

Prior to the Baninter banking scandal, Álvarez Renta had accompanied former Dominican President [[Hipólito Mejía]] on many of his trips abroad, and was appointed ambassador to France on April 2, 2003. He decided to accept the appointment as part of his retirement, in order to effect positive change for the country by helping it negotiate a Free Trade Agreement with the European Union.

However, after Governor José Lois Malkún of the [[Banco Central de la República Dominicana|Central Bank of the Dominican Republic]]’s announcement that Álvarez Renta was involved in the Baninter debacle, Álvarez Renta resigned the post in order to avoid a dispute between President Mejia and his advisors.

In response to the announcement, Álvarez Renta took out full-page advertisements in the press, in which he declared he was innocent of all the charges made by the Central Bank. He also claimed to have ended his dealings with Baninter almost two years before its failure in 2003. Álvarez Renta was the only Dominican businessperson who is mentioned by name in the Central Bank report. The report said that overdrafts and loans totaling [[Dominican peso|RD]]$3.83 billion were erased at the start of this year in favor of the company Bankinvest, S.A., presided and managed by Luis Álvarez Renta.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dr1.com/news/2003/dnews051503.shtml DR1 Daily News-Short-term ambassadorial stay]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Continuing Education==

One of the major keys to Álvarez Renta’s success was his commitment to continuing education. After graduating from MIT, he would go on to receive advanced degrees and certificates from such schools as the [[Harvard Business School]] and the [[Wharton School of Business]] at the [[University of Pennsylvania]].

This allowed Álvarez Renta to take new financial technologies and transplant them to the Caribbean marketplace. As an example, he is credited with introducing the "you set the price, I decide whether to buy or sell" process of negotiation to the region. His involvement at such a structural level in the development of the economic systems in the region ultimately made it possible for him to become successful.

==Doubts about Baninter==

Recently, many have expressed doubts about Álvarez Renta’s involvement in the Baninter scandal. He was accused by an administration that ended up being overrun with major corruption charges in a speech written by another financier, Andres Dauhajre, Jr., who had been an advisor to President Mejia and a lifelong rival of Álvarez Renta’s.

At the time of the accusation, Álvarez Renta stood to make US$100 million as part of the sale of a company he had bought that held exclusive contracts for the sale of duty-free items at every Dominican airport. Mejia's administration had challenged those contracts and lost, and many people were interested in acquiring them before the company's sale to a Spanish conglomerate was completed. (As a sidenote, these contracts would become a large part of the execution process in the lawsuit against Álvarez Renta in the United States, and were eventually turned over to the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic.)

The total amount that Álvarez Renta supposedly stole from Baninter was roughly US$59 million. It is presumably difficult to imagine him needing the money.

Álvarez Renta was also the only person in the scandal who was concurrently sued in the United States. Since the U.S. Federal Court is unable to compel testimony from Dominican citizens residing in the Dominican Republic (and none would testify voluntarily), Álvarez Renta claimed to be unable to call even a single witness in his own defense.

Ten of the original eleven charges filed in the criminal action against Álvarez Renta in the Dominican Republic were dropped before trial.

Álvarez Renta was responsible for trying to salvage Baninter by negotiating a merger with another Dominican bank, Banco del Progreso. The merger, which was approved by the Monetary Board of the Dominican Republic, was later undone by the Central Bank.

==After the Miami verdict==
After being found liable in the [[U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida]] in November 2005, Álvarez Renta expressed that he blames former Baninter president Baez Figueroa for the colossal fraud that brought down the bank and all but decimated the [[Dominican economy]] in 2003. Álvarez Renta, who has been closely associated with the banking collapse, claimed he had no part in it and that Ramon Baez Figueroa and his deputy Marcos Baez Cocco were those responsible.&lt;ref&gt;DR1 Daily News-[http://dr1.com/news/2005/dnews111705.shtml#9 Renta blames Baez Figueroa]&lt;/ref&gt; Proceedings in the Dominican Republic began on April 3, 2006 against Baninter's former president Ramon Báez Figueroa and the executives Vivian Lubrano and [[Marcos Báez Cocco]], Luis Álvarez Renta and [[Jesus Maria Ferrúa]]. The defense is headed by the famed attorney [[Marino Vinicio Castillo]], whose primary argument is that the authorities under Mejia's presidency (2000–2004) caused the bank's collapse.

On April 7, 2006 the Dominican Government announced it would offer legal and psychological support to former [[Miss Dominican Republic 1987]],  Carmen Rita Perez Pellerano, in her demand that her ex-husband, Álvarez Renta, stop harassing her and that she be awarded custody of their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dominicantoday.com/dr/this-and-that/2006/4/7/12212/Government-will-support-ex-beauty-queen-divorcing-the-convicted-Alvarez | title=Government will support ex-beauty queen divorcing the convicted Alvarez Renta | work=[[Dominican Today]] | date=7 April 2006 | accessdate=December 12, 2012 | location=Santo Domingo}}&lt;/ref&gt; Álvarez-Renta won the case on the note that Ms. Perez was declared psychologically unfit to take care of their, at the time, 7-year-old daughter.

On July 16, 2008 L.A.R. was sent to the prison at Najayo, [[San Cristóbal, Dominican Republic|San Cristóbal]] (south), to begin serving a 10-year prison sentence.

Sentencing judge Saulo Ysabel Díaz issued the custody order around 7 p.m. July 16, after almost 12 hours of discussion with the condemned and his lawyers, who asked the court to reduce his sentence and that he be allowed to serve his time in prison in the jail at Aras Nacionales, [[Villa Mella]].

Álvarez Renta arrived early Thursday morning at Díaz's office in the company of his lawyers.

==Dealings with the presidencial candidate==
It was later discovered that Álvarez Renta was the president of Maravedi, a company owned by [[Miguel Vargas Maldonado]], the candidate of the [[Dominican Revolutionary Party|PRD]] for the next presidential elections. That company was used to defraud the estate during the first years of the decade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hoy.com.do/article.aspx?id=142489 Bienvenidos al Hoy Digital&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080304002750/http://www.hoy.com.do/article.aspx?id=142489 |date=2008-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Neva Goodwin Rockefeller''' (born June 1, 1944) is co-director of the [[Global Development And Environment Institute]] (GDAE) at [[Tufts University]], where she is a research associate at [[the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/about_us/researchers.html#goodwin|title=GDAE Researchers|work=tufts.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; and director of the Social Science Library: Frontier Thinking in Sustainable Development and Human Well-Being.&lt;ref name=sslib /&gt;

Goodwin works towards a contextual economics theory that will have more relevance to contemporary real-world social and ecological concerns than does the dominant economic paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/publications/ngcont-ec1.pdf  Some Defining Characteristics of Contextual Economics]&lt;/ref&gt; To this end, Goodwin is the lead author of two introductory university-level economics textbooks as well as online teaching modules,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/education_materials/modules.html GDAE Teaching Modules on Social and Environmental Issues in Economics]&lt;/ref&gt; along with editing two six-part series among other publications (see [[Neva Goodwin#Scholarship|below]]).

Goodwin is also involved with efforts to motivate business to recognize social and ecological health as significant, long-term corporate goals. She is involved in [[socially responsible investing]]&lt;ref name=rock /&gt; and served in leadership roles at organizations such as, most recently, the [[New Economy Coalition]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://neweconomy.net/directors New Economy Coalition]&lt;/ref&gt; Winrock International Institute for Agricultural Development, [[Ceres (organization)|Ceres]], and the [[Sustainable Endowments Institute]].&lt;ref name="Neva R.

== Scholarship ==

Goodwin is active in a variety of attempts to systematize and institutionalize an economic theory – "contextual economics" – that will have more relevance to contemporary real-world social and ecological concerns than does the dominant economic paradigm, along with university-level curriculum for these approaches and results, and action and policy to implement these understandings. Her work ranges across climate change, labor relations, and feminist economics (where she helped develop the notion of the [[Core sphere]] of production). She also seeks a deeper theoretic understanding from exposure to on-the-ground experiments in alternative socio-economic institutional design.

She is the lead author of two introductory college-level textbooks: ''Microeconomics in Context''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0765638800|title=Microeconomics in Context - |work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae/publications/textbooks/microeconomics.html Microeconomics in Context (at GDAE)]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Macroeconomics in Context'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QMMqBwAAQBAJ&amp;source=gbs_book_other_versions|title=Macroeconomics in Context - Neva Goodwin, Jonathan M.

She is also the editor of two six-part book series: ''Evolving Values for a Capitalist World'' (University of Michigan Press),&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.press.umich.edu/browse/series/UM94 Evolving Values for a Capitalist World - The University of Michigan Press]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/publications/evolving_values/index.html GDAE - Evolving Values series]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Frontier Thinking in Economic Thought'' (Island Press).&lt;ref&gt;[http://islandpress.org/frontier-issues-economic-thought Frontier Thinking in Economic Thought | Island Press] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150415144234/http://islandpress.org/frontier-issues-economic-thought |date=2015-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ase.tufts.edu/gdae/publications/frontier_series/index.html GDAE (Frontier Issues in Economic Thought)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''One California''' is a {{convert|133.5|m|abbr=on}}, 32-[[storey|story]] office [[skyscraper]] completed in 1969 in the [[Financial District, San Francisco|Financial District]] of [[San Francisco]], [[California]]. It is the [[List of tallest buildings in San Francisco|31st-tallest building]] in the city. The architect of the building was [[Welton Becket Associates]].

==History==

The building was constructed on the site of the previously demolished [[Fife Building]], and was one of the earliest modern skyscrapers constructed in the city. It was the fifth tallest building in San Francisco when it was completed, but is no longer in the top 30.&lt;ref&gt;[[List of tallest buildings in San Francisco]]&lt;/ref&gt; One California was one of three buildings, the other two being [[555 California Street]] and [[McKesson Plaza]], that was featured in a 1970 ''[[Newsweek]]'' article widely thought to have coined the term "[[Manhattanization]]".&lt;ref name=emporis/&gt;

In 1995, Shorenstein became the sole owner of the tower and invested US$5 million in an extensive lobby and plaza renovation.&lt;ref name="sfbt-1995"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.accessmylibrary.com/article-1G1-16765471/shorenstein-solo-run-real.html |title=Shorenstein's solo run: real estate firm inks refinancing and buyout deals |work=San Francisco Business Times |author=Ginsberg, Steve |date=March 3, 1995 |accessdate=March 11, 2013 |quote=Workers have already taken down the building's Mutual Benefit Life sign and will put up AirTouch's logo in April.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Corporate signage===
One California is one of very few&lt;ref group=note&gt;[[425 California Street]] and the [[Bank of California Building (San Francisco)|Bank of California Tower]] are other examples.&lt;/ref&gt; downtown office skyscrapers in San Francisco to feature corporate signage at the top of the tower.  When it was constructed, the building's signage read "[[Mutual Benefit Life]]" for the insurance company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.flickr.com/photos/philip_wgtn/3289906106/sizes/o/ |title=Downtown SF Aug 1971 |publisher=Flickr |author=philip_wgtn_nz}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some time after the building went up, the San Francisco Planning Code was changed to prohibit signs above {{convert|100|ft}} on new buildings.&lt;ref name=zoning&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sf-planning.org/Modules/ShowDocument.aspx?documentid=5909 |title=Letter of Determination - One California Street |date=January 25, 2007 |author=Lawrence B. Badiner, Zoning Administrator |accessdate=March 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Existing buildings were grandfathered in and allowed for replacing signs as long as the new sign is no larger in surface area and projection than the existing sign.&lt;ref name=zoning/&gt;

After Mutual Benefit Life went out of business, the building's sign was changed in April 1995&lt;ref name="sfbt-1995"/&gt; to the logo for [[AirTouch]], which had its headquarters in the building.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/19980222065911/http://www.airtouch.com/airtouch/contact/ Contact Information]." [[AirTouch]]. Retrieved on January 10, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2005, the AirTouch signs were removed and replaced with the current [[US Bank]] logo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiderglobal.com/press_cal.html |title=Spider Delivers on Rigging Commitments for Sign Replacement Project |work=SafeWorks, LLC |date=October 7, 2005 |accessdate=March 11, 2013 |quote=All rigging moves were required to be completed during the day under tight time and safety constraints to enable the contractor to perform the replacement of the existing 'Airtouch' signs with the new 'US Bank' signs under lights at night.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pacific Shores Center''' is a [[High tech|high-tech]] [[business park]] located in [[Redwood City, California|Redwood City]], [[California]], adjacent to the [[Port of Redwood City]].

==History==
The property that Pacific Shores Center was developed on had many uses through the years from part of the Redwood City Harbor Company to cement production to being part of saltworks with [[Leslie Salt]].&lt;ref name="bcdc"&gt;{{cite web|author1=San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission|authorlink1=San Francisco Bay Conservation and Development Commission|title=Review of Port Priority Use Areas and Marine Terminal Designations in the San Francisco Bay Area Seaport Plan|url=http://www.bcdc.ca.gov/planning/reports/ReviewOfPortPriorityUseAreasAndMarineTerminalDesignationsInTheSFBayAreaSeaportPlan_June1994.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=3 June 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In {{Date|1990}} the [[Teachers' Retirement System of the State of Illinois]] bought {{convert|116|acre}} of land adjacent to the Port of Redwood City and [[Westpoint Slough]] and formed the Pacific Shores Center Partnership to develop it.&lt;ref name="biz1999"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Graebner|first1=Lynn|title=Table finally set for huge Redwood City project|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanjose/stories/1999/08/02/story4.html|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=Silicon Valley Business Journal|publisher=[[The Business Journals]]|date=1 Aug 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="openc"&gt;{{cite web|title=PACIFIC SHORES CENTER LIMITED PARTNERSHIP|url=https://opencorporates.com/companies/us_de/2249694|website=[[OpenCorporates]]|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
After many years of planning Redwood City and the partnership had a complete development agreement with plans for a land swap, that decreased the total property to {{convert|106|acre}}, and public shore space to allow for public use of parts of the property.&lt;ref name="rwcagmt"&gt;{{cite web|author1=[[Redwood City]]|title=Development Agreement|url=http://documents.redwoodcity.org/publicweblink/DocView.aspx?dbid=0&amp;id=17824&amp;cr=1|website=Redwood City Documents|accessdate=6 March 2017|date=26 October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In {{Date|November 1999}} [[Jay Paul Company]] entered into an agreement to buy the rights for the project by outbidding several other competing developers with a {{currency|90million|USD}} bid.&lt;ref name="90mil"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Robson|first1=Douglas|title=Peninsula land fetches $90M|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/1999/11/29/story1.html|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=San Francisco Business Times|publisher=[[The Business Journals]]|date=28 November 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By early 2000 with the buildings not even complete; [[Excite#Excite.40Home|Excite@Home]], [[Openwave|Phone.com]], [[Informatica|Informatica Corp]], and [[Broadvision|BroadVision Inc.]] had all signed leases. Demand at the time caused rent prices to increase for the center as well.&lt;ref name="biz2000"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Lynn Graebner|author2=Douglas Robson|title=Big Peninsula project nearly full before it starts|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sanfrancisco/stories/2000/03/13/story5.html|accessdate=6 March 2017|work=San Francisco Business Times|publisher=[[The Business Journals]]|date=12 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At this time there were plans for a ferry service to connect [[San Francisco]] and [[Alameda, California]] to an adjacent ferry terminal to mitigate traffic concerns at the time with so many of the expected workers to be projected commuting.&lt;ref name="ferry2000"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pence|first1=Angelica|title=Redwood City Seaway / Peninsula port hopes to offer ferry service to S.F., East Bay|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Redwood-City-Seaway-Peninsula-port-hopes-to-3304073.php|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=[[SF Gate]]|date=3 July 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By {{Date|April 2002}} the burst of the [[Dot-com bubble]] had decreased demand for office space and the center previously estimated to fill completely was sitting with a vacancy rate of 65%.&lt;ref name="vacancy"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jimenez|first1=Jorge|title=New Tenant at Pacific Shores|url=https://www.costar.com/News/Article/New-Tenant-at-Pacific-Shores/38266|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=[[CoStar Group]]|date=23 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However fortunes changed and in late 2006 the campus was sold from Jay Paul to [[Starwood Capital Group]] for over {{currency|800million|USD}} for the center which had hit 90% capacity. Tenants at the time included [[Eidos Interactive]], [[PDL BioPharma]], [[DreamWorks Animation]], Threshold Pharmaceutical, Openwave, [[Symantec]], and engineering firm [[Rudolph and Sletten]].&lt;ref name="sale2006"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Conrad|first1=Katherine|title=Pacific Shores Center sold for about $800M|url=http://www.eastbaytimes.com/2006/12/13/pacific-shores-center-sold-for-about-800m/|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=[[East Bay Times]]|date=13 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The following year two of the buildings, specifically the ones PDL BioPharma was located within, were sold to Shorenstein Properties for an undisclosed sum, for the first time making Pacific Shores Center to have more than one owner.&lt;ref name="sale2007"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hollis|first1=Robert|title=DEAL OF THE WEEK: 1400-1500 Seaport Blvd., Redwood City / Shorenstein buys more office space|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/DEAL-OF-THE-WEEK-1400-1500-Seaport-Blvd-2600151.php|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=[[SF Gate]]|date=24 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[San Mateo County]] filed a lawsuit in August 2009 over a tax dispute with the Center. County officials claimed that the sale of property in 2006 never had the property transfer taxes paid while the Center argued over the county tax code.&lt;ref name="salesuit"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bishop|first1=Shaun|title=San Mateo County sues office complex owners in tax dispute|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/2009/08/20/san-mateo-county-sues-office-complex-owners-in-tax-dispute-2/|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=20 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starwood Capital ran into issues with overdue debt in {{Date|2012}} and brought in [[The Blackstone Group|Blackstone]] with an ownership stake. Starwood also sold off two of the buildings at the complex to Informatica for {{currency|148.5million|USD}}.&lt;ref name="blackstone"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sadovi|first1=Maura Webber|title=Pacific Shores Positioning|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203833004577249730377746176|accessdate=8 March 2017|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=29 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In {{Date|2014}}, [[Google]] bought the six buildings, over half the center, at {{convert|934200|sqft}} of office space, which Starwood and Blackstone owned, for {{currency|585million|USD}}.&lt;ref name="googlebuy"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Hui-yong Yu|author2=Brian Womack|title=Google Grows With $1.6 Billion in California Office Deals|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2014-10-25/google-grows-with-1-6-billion-in-california-office-deals|website=[[Bloomberg L.P.]]|accessdate=8 March 2017|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Shortly after Google's purchase, Shorenstein Properties sold the two buildings they owned to DivcoWest Properties for about {{currency|260million|USD}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7046">A '''product manager''' is a professional role which is responsible for the development of products for an organization, known as the practice of [[product management]]. For both physical products and virtual ones such as software, product managers work to define the business strategy behind a product, as well as specifying its functional requirements. 

==Definition==
Diverse interpretations regarding the role of the product manager are the norm, and thus precisely defining the scope of the role is often difficult. The product manager title is often used in many ways to describe drastically different duties and responsibilities. Even within the [[high-tech]] industry where [[product management]] is better defined, the product manager's job description varies widely among companies. This is due to tradition and intuitive interpretations by different individuals.

A product manager considers numerous factors such as intended customer or user of a product, the products offered by the competition, and how well the product fits with the company's business model. Generally, a product manager may manage one or more tangible product lines. However, the term may be used to describe a person who manages intangible products, such as music, information, and services. In the financial services industry (banking, insurance etc.), product managers manage products (for example, credit card portfolios), their profit and loss, and also determine the business development strategy.

In some companies, the product manager also performs the functions of similar roles, such as:

* [[Product marketing]] manager: may perform all [[Marketing communications|outbound marketing]] activities in the older sense of the term
* [[Project manager]]: may perform all activities related to schedule and resource management
* [[Program manager]]: may perform activities related to schedule, resource, and cross-functional execution
* [[Product owner]]: a popular role in Agile development methodology, may perform all activities related to a self-encapsulated feature or feature set plan, development and releases.
* Technical product manager (TPM): similar to product owner, but may perform all activities from technology perspective.
* [[Product designer]]: closer to UX designer but more focus on entire function flows.

== Product management in software development ==

The role of the product manager was originally created to manage the complexity of the product lines of a business, as well as to ensure that those products were profitable. Product managers can come from many different backgrounds, because their primary skills involve working well with customers and understanding the problems the product is intended to solve.&lt;ref name="Geracie2010a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Geracie|title=Take Charge Product Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SgULkK_S6UC|date=July 2010|publisher=Greg Geracie|isbn=978-0-615-37927-2|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A product manager is responsible for orchestrating the various activities associated with ensuring that a product is delivered that meets users' needs. A software product manager's role varies as the software moves through its lifecycle; earlier in the development process the product manager meets the intended audience of the product to engage in [[requirements elicitation]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zieliński|first=Krzysztof|title=Software Engineering: Evolution and Emerging Technologies|year=2005|publisher=IOS Press|location=Amsterdam|isbn=1-58603-559-2|pages=215|edition=2nd printing.|author2=Szmuc, Tomasz }}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas later in the lifecycle the product manager's primary focus may be in [[acceptance testing]] of the product. Throughout all the stages of the product development process, the product manager represents the needs of end-users, evaluates market trends and competition, and uses this information to determine what features to build.  For example, a product manager may decide a feature is needed because users are asking for it, or because the feature is needed to stay competitive.  In order to facilitate this decision making process the product manager may set out a vision for the product or a general framework for making product decisions. The product manager also ensures an atmosphere of cohesiveness and focused collaboration between all the members of the team, all in the interest of driving the product forward.&lt;ref name="Cohen2010a"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Cohen|title=Agile Excellence for Product Managers: A Guide to Creating Winning Products with Agile Development Teams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoX8lOdSWWQC|year=2010|publisher=Happy About|isbn=978-1-60773-074-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Product managers are often thought of as sitting at the intersection of business, design, and technology.

Within an [[agile software development]] environment day-to-day responsibilities of a product manager include creating and prioritizing the product backlog, which is a list of things to be done by the development team. The product backlog is often made up of [[user story|user stories]], "a placeholder for a conversation between the product manager... and the development team." These are brief narrative descriptions of what a feature should do, including a checklist of items that are required to be in place in order for the feature to be considered done, called the [[Acceptance testing|acceptance criteria]]. The details of how the feature is developed are worked out by developers and designers. At the end of the development sprint, the product manager is responsible for verifying that the acceptance criteria have been met; only then is the work on the feature officially done.&lt;ref name="Cohen2010b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Cohen|title=Agile Excellence for Product Managers: A Guide to Creating Winning Products with Agile Development Teams|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IoX8lOdSWWQC|year=2010|publisher=Happy About|isbn=978-1-60773-074-3|page=57}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable individuals who have held the role of product manager in a software development company include [[Sundar Pichai]] (CEO of [[Google]]) [[Marissa Mayer]] (former CEO of [[Yahoo!]]), [[Premal Shah]] (president of [[Kiva (organization)|Kiva.org]]), [[Reid Hoffman]] (founder of [[LinkedIn]]), and [[Kevin Systrom]] (founder of [[Instagram]]).

The need for a separate product manager role depends on the size of an organization; in smaller organizations, the CEO may take on the responsibilities of product manager.&lt;ref name="Geracie2010b"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Geracie|title=Take Charge Product Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SgULkK_S6UC|date=July 2010|publisher=Greg Geracie|isbn=978-0-615-37927-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reinhold Rücker Angerstein''', born October 25, 1718 at [[Vikmanshyttan]], dead January 5, 1760 in [[Stockholm]], was a [[Sweden|Swedish]] [[metallurgy|metallurgist]], [[civil servant]] and [[entrepreneur]].
 
Angerstein was a member of an old family of Swedish [[Iron Masters]], of [[Germans|German]] descent. He passed his matriculation in [[Uppsala]] 1727 and then worked as an auditor at the [[Swedish Board of Mines]] (Bergskollegium) between 18 and 24 years of age.
 
At the age of 31 he started a series of long journeys abroad, financed by the [[Swedish Association of Iron Masters]] (Jernkontoret). From these trips he wrote extensive and illustrated travel accounts back to [[Sweden]]. He primarily described technical and economic observations from mining and from Iron and Steel Works. Between 1749 and 1757 he was constantly travelling, with only few short spells in [[Sweden]]: in [[Germany]], [[Austria]], [[Italy]], [[France]], [[Portugal]], [[Belgium]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Britain]].

After returning to Sweden he got a position at Bergskollegium as Director of Steelworks (Direktör för rikets gröfre svartsmide). There exist illustrations also from his inspection tours of Swedish Iron Works. Towards the end of his life he purchased the [[Vira bruk|Vira Iron Works]] in [[Uppland]] in 1757, northeast of Stockholm, renowned for forging of weapons for the army. He had far-reaching plans to extend this plant, but had no time to implement them before his death in 1760.

Between 1753 and 1755 he visited [[England]] and [[Wales]], where he was considered an industrial spy. His visit to [[Sheffield]] was brief, less than a day, and it has been suggested that he was driven out of the town for showing too much interest in the crucible process newly invented by [[Benjamin Huntsman]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120712001541/http://hri.shef.ac.uk/huntsman/history_stage8.html materialising Sheffield&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Richard Lucian Page''' (December 20, 1807 &amp;ndash; August 9, 1901) was a [[United States Navy]] officer who joined the [[Confederate States Navy]] and later became a [[History of Confederate States Army Generals#Brigadier general|brigadier general]] in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the American Civil War.

==Early life==

Richard L. Page was born in [[Clarke County, Virginia]] on December 20, 1807 to William Byrd Page (1768-1812) and Ann (Lee) Page (b.1776). He has a [[maternal]] cousin in the future Confederate Full General [[Robert E. Lee]] and a [[paternal]] cousin of the poet [[Thomas Nelson Page]]. Another maternal relative is [[Charles Lee (Attorney General)|Charles Lee]] who was [[U.S. Attorney General]] during the [[Washington Administration]] and the [[John Adams Administration]]. He attended the common schools in Clarke County and in [[Alexandria, Virginia]].

==Early Military Service==

Richard Lucian Page joined the [[U.S. Navy]] as a midshipman on March 12, 1824, and his first assignment in 1824–1825 was on board the {{USS|John Adams|1799|6}} of the U.S. Navy West Indies Squadron led by Commodore [[David Porter (naval officer)|David Porter]]. In 1825, he was ordered to the {{USS|Brandywine||6}} and was with the crew when it carried General [[Marquis de Lafayette]] back to [[France]] under the leadership of U.S. Navy Captain [[Charles Morris (naval officer)|Charles Morris]]. Now in [[Europe]], Midshipman Page was transferred to the {{USS|Constitution||6}} where he served with this U.S. Navy [[Mediterranean Squadron (United States)|Mediterranean Squadron]] ship until it returned to the port of [[Boston, Massachusetts]] on [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]], 1828.

Page's next assignment came on the {{USS|Constellation|1797|6}} after which he prepared for his naval examination. In 1830-1834, Passed Midshipman and Sailing Master Richard Page served on board the {{USS|Concord|1828|6}} with the U.S. Navy Mediterranean Squadron.

On March 26, 1834, Richard Page was commissioned a U.S. Navy Lieutenant and was ordered to serve on the {{USS|Enterprise|1831|6}} which was going overseas. He was then transferred to the {{USS|Ontario|1813|6}}, then transferred back to the ''Enterprise'' and then finally landing on the {{USS|Peacock|1828|6}} which brought him back to the United States of America in October, 1837. After his around-the-world tour of duty, Lieutenant Page was given a two-years leave of absence to visit Europe in 1837-1839.

Upon returning to duty in 1839, Page will serve at the [[Gosport Navy Yard]] as an ordnance officer. During this tour of duty at Norfolk, he married a local woman, Alexina Taylor, in 1841; they would have four children. After duty at the navy yard, he then took to the seas again on board the {{USS|Macedonian|1836|6}} for two years. In 1844-1845, he was back with the U.S. Navy Mediterranean Squadron on board the {{USS|Fairfield|1828|6}}. Upon returning to the United States in 1845, he served with the docked {{USS|Pennsylvania|1837|6}} at the U.S. Navy Norfolk Naval Ship Yard.

==The Mexican American War And Afterwards==

During the [[Mexican–American War]] of 1846–1848, he served for two years as Lieutenant Commander on board the {{USS|Independence|1814|6}}. This ship served as the flagship for U.S. Navy Pacific Squadron Commander, Commodore [[William Shubrick]].

After this war, in 1849–1852, he was back doing ordnance duty at the U.S. Navy Norfolk Navy Ship Yard. Then in 1852–1854, Lieutenant Commander Page served as commander of the {{USS|Perry|1843|6}} with the U.S. Navy [[Africa Squadron]]. Upon returning from Africa, Page was back at Norfolk, this time as an executive officer and a Member of the Retiring Board.

On September 14, 1855, U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Richard Page was promoted to commander in the midst of his 1854–1857 service while at [[Norfolk, Virginia]]. In 1857–1859, Commander Page was with the U.S. Navy [[East India Squadron]] serving as commander of the {{USS|Germantown|1846|6}}. Then he returned to Norfolk where serve from 1859 to 1861.

As soon as the [[Commonwealth of Virginia]] ceded from the Union, U.S. Navy Commander Richard Lucian Page resigned his rank and office while at the Navy Yard.

==With The Confederates==

Now out of the U.S. Navy, Richard L. Page next served as a naval aide-de-camp to the [[Governor of Virginia]] [[John Letcher]] with special duties to organize a State of Virginia Navy. While in this Office, Page supervised the building of fortifications at the mouth of the [[James River]] as well as those on the [[Nansemond River]] and on the [[Pagan River]].

On June 10, 1861, Richard Page received a commission as a Confederate States of America Navy Commander. Prior to the evacuation at [[Norfolk, Virginia]], he served at the ship yard. Upon being promoted to C.S. Navy captain a short time later, Page went on to establish the ordnance and construction depot located at [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], which he would largely manage during the period of 1861–1864. During this time of 1861–1864, however, he would also briefly be in command of C.S. Navy forces at [[Savannah, Georgia]], and would also be active in the [[Battle of Port Royal]] in November 1861, where he served on the {{ship|CSS|Savannah|gunboat|6}} under the fleet command of C.S. Navy squadron Flag Officer [[Josiah Tattnall]].

Then on March 1, 1864, Richard Page left the C.S. Navy to join the C.S. Army; he got a commission as a C.S. Army brigadier general. He was then assigned to take command of the outer defenses of the C.S. Army held location at [[Mobile Bay, Alabama]] and would set up his headquarters at [[Fort Morgan (Alabama)|Fort Morgan]].

Brigadier General Page was in command of the Confederate garrison that controlled Fort Morgan, Alabama during the Union's attacks on Mobile Bay. Fort Morgan withstood the Union attack on April 5, 1864, but was besieged on April 9.

Then on August 8, 1864, a 10,000-man and 200-cannon Union task force arrived to challenge Page's 400-man and 26-cannon Confederate force. Union task force staff summoned Page and told him to surrender; he replied that he would defend the fort to the end. Federal troops then moved their works closer to the outdated fort for the next two weeks. Then on August 22, 1864, heavy Union cannon fire replaced the lighter cannon fire of the previous two weeks. For the next 12 hours, 3,000 Union cannon shells were thrown at the fort. This Union cannon fire started some fires in the fort and threatened to ignite the Confederate powder magazine, and so the defenders put the powder kegs in the cisterns. On August 23 Brigadier General Richard Lucian Page unconditionally surrendered the fort, because his troops had little usable gunpowder. Indignant, he broke his sword over his knee instead of surrendering his sword to the Federals. Page's situation was further worsened when he was suspected of destroying munitions and works within the fort after he had agreed to surrender.

He was arrested by the Federal authorities and imprisoned at [[Fort Delaware]] on [[Pea Patch Island]] until September 1865.&lt;ref name=Routledge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=John D.|title=The Routledge Encyclopedia of Civil War Era Biographies |page=444 |date=2013 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=9780415878036 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_wpKWzSmvUC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Late life==
Page returned to Norfolk after the war, eventually becoming superintendent of public schools from 1875 to 1883.&lt;ref name=Routledge/&gt;

He died in [[Blue Ridge Summit, Pennsylvania]], on August 9, 1901&lt;ref name=DANFS&gt;{{cite DANFS |title=Richard L. Page |url=https://www.history.navy.mil/research/histories/ship-histories/danfs/r/richard-l-page-.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is buried in Cedar Grove Cemetery, [[Norfolk, Virginia]].

==Honors==
In ''Confederate Military History: Volume 3'' [[Clement A. Evans]], himself a former C.S. Army Brigadier General, was moved to write the following on the defense of Fort Morgan in August 22–23 of 1864, "The defense of Fort Morgan, under the command of (Brigadier) General Page, is one of the most celebrated instances of heroism in the history of the war."

The {{USS|Richard L. Page|FFG-5|6}}, a [[Brooke-class frigate]] built for the United States Navy in 1965, was named in his honor.&lt;ref name=DANFS/&gt;

'''Risk and strategic consulting''' refers to the provision of information, [[analysis]] and associated services in the field of international [[politics]] and [[economics]], with the aim of providing a better understanding of the risks and opportunities facing businesses, [[government]]s and other groups. 

In contrast to [[management consulting]], which primarily concerns internal organization and performance, risk and strategic consulting aims to provide clients with an improved understanding of the political and economic climate in which they operate. Most such consultancy is focused on those developing countries and emerging markets in which political and business risks may be greater, harder to manage, or harder to assess. Risk and strategic consulting is sometimes carried out alongside other activities such as corporate investigation, [[forensic accounting]], employee screening or vetting, and the provision of security systems, training or procedures. Some of the largest groups in the industry include [[Kroll Inc.]] and [[Control Risks Group]], though the size and range of consultancies varies widely, with groups such as [[Black Cube]] and [[Hakluyt &amp; Company]] providing boutique services. 

Risk and strategic consultancy does not generally involve the operational 'risk assessment' carried out by many companies and consultancies. Risk assessment in this sense covers the identification and management of commercial, operational and technical risks within existing operations or known markets. Risk and strategic consultancy also concerns countries and concerns similar to those of interest to [[private military companies]], though the two industries are distinct. Risk and strategy consultancies should not be confused with international lobbying or advocacy groups, though there are occasional overlaps. Clients of risk and strategic consulting firms include companies, governments and government agencies, charities and non-government organizations, academic institutions and individuals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2110">The '''Rushmore Drilling Index''' (RDI) and '''Rushmore Estimated Drilling Days''' (REDD) are popular analytical tools developed in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.rigzone.com/news/article.asp?a_id=72342| title=Rigzone: Operators Welcome New Global Drilling Difficulty Index}}&lt;/ref&gt; owned by [[Rushmore Reviews]], to assist [[Oil_well|well]] planners.

==History==
The RDI is an analytical tool based on [[Rushmore Reviews]] extensive global drilling database of [[Offset Well Data|offset wells]], and is available to oil and gas companies who participate in the Reviews. The index is an entirely objective tool, and essentially estimates the speed it will take to drill a well after the user supplies the equation with 8-10 characteristics. The drilling speed is converted into an index number, ranging from 10 (easiest) to over 200 (most difficult). The resulting RDI number can then be used as a point of reference for well planning.&lt;ref name=oe200911&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slb.com/~/media/Files/drilling/industry_articles/200911_oe_operation_support_center.pdf|last=Offshore Engineer|title=Putting It All Together|magazine=Offshore Engineer|date=November 1, 2009|page=55|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307143856/http://www.slb.com/~/media/Files/drilling/industry_articles/200911_oe_operation_support_center.pdf|archivedate=March 7, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The REDD was developed alongside the RDI by combining the most significant coefficients into a formula. Once the user has supplied the equation with 8-10 characteristics, it provides a P50 estimate of the number of days and ‘average’ Operator would take to drill a well.

The '''Stix family''' is a prominent American [[American Jews|Jewish]] family from [[St. Louis, Missouri]].  William Stix, the progenitor, founded Rice-Stix, Inc., a manufacturer and wholesaler of dry goods that was described as the largest business in St. Louis at the time of the 1904 [[St. Louis World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="CohenPhilanthropist"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Robert|title=Ernest W. Stix, Jr. 95; businessman, artist, philanthropist|url=http://www.stljewishlight.com/obituaries/article_4bed76ec-f4eb-11e0-ae1e-001cc4c03286.html|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=[[St. Louis Jewish Light]]|date=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The firm, in St. Louis since 1879, moved in 1889 to a new headquarters in a [[Richardsonian Romanesque]] building designed by [[Isaac S. Taylor]] at 1000 Washington Avenue.&lt;ref name="WashingtonSt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Rice and Stix Dry Goods Company building at 1000 Washington Avenue|url=http://collections.mohistory.org/resource/141192|publisher=Missouri Historical Museum|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;   By 1907 Rice-Stix owned the entire block between 10th and 11th, and between St. Charles and Washington streets, the largest footprint of any downtown merchant. Rice and Stix was the largest manufacturer of clothing in the United States in the 1950s. In 1955 Rice-Stix was sold to Reliance Manufacturing Co. in New York, in turn, Reliance manufacturing was acquired by Safle Bros., Inc.&lt;ref name="CohenPhilanthropist"/&gt;

The family was active in rescuing European Jews from the Nazi [[Holocaust]] by obtaining visas for them to emigrate to the United States.  Among the families they helped was the family of 2017 Nobel Laureate in physics, [[Rainer Weiss]], who came as a child refugee on a visa obtained by the Stix family.&lt;ref name="WeissOral History"&gt;{{cite news|title=Interview with Ranier Weiss|url=http://oralhistories.library.caltech.edu/183/1/Weiss_OHO.pdf|accessdate=3 October 2017|publisher=CalTech Oral History Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ernest W. Stix, Sr. (d. 1955) succeeded his father as head of Rice-Stix in 1916, his death in 1955 triggeried the sale of the family business.&lt;ref name="CohenPhilanthropist"/&gt;

Ernest Stix 's cousin, Charles Stix, was a so-founded of St.. Louis's  [[Stix Baer &amp; Fuller]]  department store.&lt;ref name="CohenPhilanthropist"/&gt;

Ernest W. Stix, Jr., son of Ernest W. Stix, Sr., was a philanthropist.&lt;ref name="CohenPhilanthropist"/&gt;

'''Tuariki John Edward Delamere''' (born 9 December 1951) is a former New Zealand politician. He served as an MP from 1996 to 1999, and was a member of [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] for the duration of his term.

==Early life==
Delamere was born in 1951 at a military hospital in [[Papakura]], and was educated in [[Tauranga]], attending [[Tauranga Boys' College]]. In 1967 and 1969, he was recognised as the top [[Māori people|Māori]] student in New Zealand. He then attended [[Washington State University]] on an athletic scholarship. Delamere obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1974. He later obtained an [[Master of Business Administration|MBA]] from [[Long Island University]].

For a time, Delamere served in the [[United States Army]], stationed at [[Fort Leonard Wood, Missouri]]. He later joined the staff at the [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] military academy. After leaving the United States, Delamere worked as chief financial officer for [[Polynesian Airlines]]. He also held a number of [[bureaucracy|bureaucratic]] roles.

Delamere has also been successful in sporting events; setting records{{clarify|date=July 2013}} in [[long jump]] and [[triple jump]], and representing New Zealand in those events in the [[1974 Commonwealth Games]] at Christchurch. At Washington State,  he pioneered the technique of a full somersault in long jump competitions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reid|first1=Ron|title=The Flip that lead to a Flap|url=https://www.si.com/vault/1974/07/29/616167/the-flip-that-led-to-a-flap|website=Sports Illustrated|accessdate=20 March 2018|language=EN|date=29 July 1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand First==

{{NZ parlbox footer}}
Delamere entered politics in the [[New Zealand general election, 1996|1996 elections]], when he successfully stood as a candidate for the [[New Zealand First]] party in the [[Te Tai Rawhiti]] electorate, defeating Sir [[Peter Tapsell (New Zealand politician)|Peter Tapsell]] and becoming one of the group known as the ''[[Tight Five]]''. Immediately after being elected, he was appointed to [[Cabinet of New Zealand|Cabinet]] as part of New Zealand First's coalition deal with the [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]]. Among the roles he held during his ministerial career were those of Minister of Immigration, Minister of Pacific Island Affairs, Associate [[Minister of Finance (New Zealand)|Minister of Finance]], and Associate [[Minister of Health (New Zealand)|Minister of Health]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://tuariki-delamere.epik.com/bio Tuariki Delamere Bio]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}. Epik. Accessed 3 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1998, the coalition between New Zealand First and the National Party began to break apart, and significant tensions emerged in New Zealand First itself. On 11 August, it was claimed by [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]] MP [[Rodney Hide]] that Delamere was planning a coup against New Zealand First leader [[Winston Peters]], an allegation which Delamere denied. Two days later, Delamere acknowledged that he had been exploring the possibility a new political party based around the so-called "tight five", New Zealand First's group of Māori MPs (not counting Peters himself). When Peters was sacked from Cabinet, Delamere openly supported the move, and pledged his support to the National Party government regardless of his party's stance. Delamere formally resigned from New Zealand First on 18 August 1998, saying that the party would be better known as "Winston First".

==Independent and Te Tawharau==
As an independent, Delamere continued to support the National government, and retained his ministerial portfolios.

On 22 December 1998, Delamere announced gay and lesbian couples applying for [[permanent residency]] would have the same rights as straight de facto couples: a change [[Max Bradford]], when Minister of Immigration, stated was too difficult.

In late 1999, however, he lost his role as Minister of Immigration after a scandal regarding the application of immigration rules. Specifically, it emerged that Delamere had approved [[permanent residency]] for a group of [[China|Chinese]] businessmen provided they invested generously in various Māori development schemes. Delamere was widely criticised for using his authority to ensure that money was given to certain groups. Delamere himself claimed that his actions were a perfectly reasonable method of addressing Māori development needs. Although he lost the immigration portfolio, he retained his other roles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL0404/S00248.htm A Second Look At The Leadership Of Richard Prebble]&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before the [[New Zealand general election, 1999|1999 elections]], Delamere joined the small Māori [[Te Tawharau]] party, giving it its first representation in Parliament. He had previously declined to join the [[Mauri Pacific]] party, established by five other former New Zealand First MPs (including three of his "tight five" colleagues). Shortly prior to the election, Delamere announced that his party would support only a Labour Party government on confidence and supply if it won seats in the new Parliament. This was at odds with Delamere's unwavering support of the legislative programme of the Shipley Administration. In the elections, Delamere contested the new [[Waiariki (New Zealand electorate)|Waiariki]] electorate &amp;mdash; he placed second, with 20.01% of the vote. The winner was [[Mita Ririnui]] of the [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]]. He was also placed second on the [[party list]] of the [[Mana Māori Movement]], which Te Tawharau was affiliated with, but the party did not win any seats.

==Private sector==
Since leaving Parliament, Delamere has established himself as an immigration consultant, founding the company of Tuariki Delamere &amp; Associates. He also owns a successful cabaret restaurant in Auckland, Finale Restaurant and Cabaret.

In 2000 Delamere rejoined the [[New Zealand National Party]], the party he had started his political career with. However he ruled out a return to Parliament to concentrate on his business concerns.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_148326"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=148326 |title=National's waka nets Waitai |author=Young, Audrey |date=19 August 2000 |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March and November 2005, Delamere appeared in court on charges of fraud. The trial began in the High Court in Auckland on 7 February 2007.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10422848"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10422848 |title=Former minister in court for fraud |date=7 February 2007 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a 4-week trial, the jury found him not guilty of all charges after less than 2 hours of delibiration on 2 March 2007.&lt;ref name="NZ_Herald_10426672"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/nz/news/article.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=10426672 |title=Ex-immigration minister cleared of fraud |date=2 March 2007 |agency=[[NZPA]] |work=[[The New Zealand Herald]] |accessdate=25 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''William H. Regnery II''' (born February 1941) is an American heir to a multi-million dollar fortune, and a political activist and donor. He is the founder of the [[National Policy Institute]], a white nationalist/supremacist think tank that has been credited with expanding the [[Alt-right]].

==Early life==
William H. Regnery II was born in February 1941.&lt;ref name="Moneyman"&gt;{{Cite news|first1=Aram|last1=Roston|first2=Joel|last2=Anderson|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/aramroston/hes-spent-almost-20-years-funding-the-racist-right-it|title=The Moneyman behind the alt-right|work=BuzzFeed|access-date=October 22, 2017|date=July 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandfather, [[William H. Regnery]], was a "textile magnate, banker, and philanthropist in Chicago."&lt;ref name="Moneyman"/&gt; His uncle, Henry, in 1947 founded [[Regnery Publishing]],&lt;ref name="Individual"/&gt; which the Regnery family sold in 1993.&lt;ref name="Sold"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.regnery.com/about/|title=About Regnery Publishing|access-date=2017-10-22|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regnery enrolled at the [[University of Pennsylvania]], where he studied Political Science; however, he dropped out before graduation.&lt;ref name="Moneyman"/&gt; He was in charge of the family business "for only 15 months", but he was later sued by his family, who subsequently sold the business.&lt;ref name="Moneyman"/&gt;

==Activism==
While in college, Regnery was an active member of the [[Intercollegiate Studies Institute]].&lt;ref name="Moneyman"/&gt; He also worked on [[Barry Goldwater]]'s [[Barry Goldwater presidential campaign, 1964|1964 presidential campaign]].&lt;ref name="Moneyman"/&gt;

Regnery founded the [[Charles Martel Society]], a non-profit organization based in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], in 2001.&lt;ref name="makingsense5859"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hawley|first1=George|title=Making Sense of the Alt-Right|date=2017|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York|isbn=9780231185127|pages=58–59|oclc=987742156|quote=Despite its innocuous name, NPI has since its inception been a white-nationalist organization.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="enterprisewhitenationalistsraisemillions"&gt;{{cite news|title=White nationalists raise millions with tax-free charities|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/246584534/?terms=%22William%2BH.%2BRegnery%2BII%22|accessdate=October 24, 2017|work=Enterprise-Journal|location=McComb, Mississippi|date=December 22, 2016|page=A7|via=[[Newspapers.com]]|registration=yes|quote=The Georgia-based Charles Martel Society was founded by wealthy publisher William H.

Regnery founded the [[National Policy Institute]], an [[Identitarian]]&lt;ref name="makingsense5859"/&gt; [[think tank]] now based in [[Alexandria, Virginia]], in 2005. He hired [[Richard B. Spencer]] to run it.&lt;ref name="Moneyman"/&gt;

Regnery is described by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]] as "a prime mover and shaker in white nationalism" and "famously reclusive".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2004/all-white-dating-service-planned "All-White Dating Service Planned"], ''Southern Poverty Law Center'', Summer 2004&lt;/ref&gt; They add that he has worked to organize and fund a racist and anti-semitic network of publishers, websites and groups.&lt;ref name="Individual"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/individual/william-h-regnery-ii|title=William H. Regnery II|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
Regnery resides in [[Boca Grande, Florida]].&lt;ref name="Moneyman"/&gt;

According to George Hawley, an assistant professor of Political Science at the [[University of Alabama]], Regnery "seems to be the black sheep of the family, and he generally avoids the public spotlight."&lt;ref name="makingsense5859"/&gt;
