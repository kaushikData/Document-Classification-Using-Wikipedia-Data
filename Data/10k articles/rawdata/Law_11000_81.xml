      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4207">The '''ASCAP boycott''' was a [[boycott]] of the [[American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers]] (ASCAP) by radio broadcasters, due to license fees. From another perspective, it was a boycott of radio broadcasters by ASCAP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Pitt |first1=Ivan L. |title=Direct Licensing and the Music Industry: How Technology, Innovation and Competition Reshaped Copyright Licensing |date=2015 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9783319176536 |page=vi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wv-4CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PR6&amp;dq=%22ASCAP+boycott%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj77KOklbLeAhUOKqwKHW_UDMsQ6AEINjAC#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ASCAP%20boycott%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=2 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; "concerned about the unlicensed radio broadcast of its members' material ..."&lt;ref name="hos"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bayles |first1=Martha |title=Hole in Our Soul: The Loss of Beauty and Meaning in American Popular Music |date=1996 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226039596 |page=109 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pmcaVNZNF-cC&amp;pg=PA109&amp;dq=%22ASCAP+boycott%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj77KOklbLeAhUOKqwKHW_UDMsQ6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ASCAP%20boycott%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1931 and 1939, ASCAP increased royalty rates charged to broadcasters some 448%.&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Lessig]].[http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/larry_lessig_says_the_law_is_strangling_creativity.html "Larry Lessig on laws that choke creativity]" (minute 6:00), [[TED (conference)|TED]] Talk, 2007. Retrieved 20 August 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1940, when ASCAP tried to double its license fees, radio broadcasters prepared to resist their demands by enforcing a boycott of ASCAP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Schneider |first1=John |title=This Boycott Changed American Music |url=https://www.radioworld.com/columns-and-views/this-boycott-changed-american-music |website=RadioWorld |publisher=Future plc |accessdate=2 November 2018 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181102002556/https://www.radioworld.com/columns-and-views/this-boycott-changed-american-music |archivedate=2 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and inaugurating a competing royalty agency, [[Broadcast Music Incorporated]] (BMI).&lt;ref name="bms"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Maslon |first1=Laurence |title=Broadway to Main Street: How Show Tunes Enchanted America |date=2018 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199832545 |page=59 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhlnDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63&amp;dq=%22ASCAP+boycott%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj77KOklbLeAhUOKqwKHW_UDMsQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22ASCAP%20boycott%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=1 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a ten-month period lasting from January 1 to October 29, 1941, no music licensed by ASCAP (1,250,000 songs) was broadcast on [[NBC]] nor [[CBS]] radio stations. Instead, the stations played songs in the [[public domain]], regional music and styles (like [[rhythm and blues]] or country) that had been traditionally disdained by ASCAP. And it resulted in a lot of classical compositions being recorded by the big bands.

When  the differences between ASCAP and the broadcasters were resolved, ASCAP agreed to settle for a lower fee{{specify}} than they had initially demanded.&lt;ref&gt;Elijah Wald, ''How The Beatles Destroyed Rock'n'Roll'', p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

"[[Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair]]", an 1854 [[song]], was a notorious beneficiary of the ASCAP boycott. According to ''[[Time (magazine)|Time Magazine]]'', "So often had BMI's Jeannie [sic] With the Light Brown Hair been played that she was widely reported to have turned grey."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=No Letup|date=27 January 1941 |publisher=''[[Time Magazine]]''|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,801239,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another beneficiary was [[Glenn Miller]]'s "[[the Song of the Volga Boatmen]]".&lt;ref name=pc2b&gt;{{Pop Chronicles 40s|2|B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Accommodation''' is a legal obligation entered into as a gratuitous favor without [[consideration]], such as a [[signature]] guaranteeing payment of a [[debt]]. This is sometimes called an accommodation endorsement.

The bill '''H.R. 1580''' ({{USBill|113|HR|1580}})(long title: "To affirm the policy of the United States regarding Internet governance") was a bill introduced into the [[United States House of Representatives]] in the [[113th United States Congress]].  The bill primarily listed a series of Congressional "findings" regarding the [[internet]], its use, and the way it has been governed.  Finally, the bill affirms that "it is the policy of the United States to preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs the Internet."

==Provisions/Elements of the bill==
''This section is primarily composed of the exact text of H.R. 1580 as it was first introduced.''&lt;ref name=1580sum&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1580 - Summary|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1580|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

'''SECTION 1. FINDINGS.'''
The [[113th United States Congress]] finds the following:
:(1) Given the importance of the [[Internet]] to the [[World economy|global economy]], it is essential that the Internet remain stable, secure, and free from government control.
:(2) The world deserves the access to knowledge, services, commerce, and communication, the accompanying benefits to economic development, education, and health care, and the informed discussion that is the bedrock of democratic [[Self-governance|self-government]] that the Internet provides.
:(3) The structure of Internet governance has profound implications for competition and trade, [[democratization]], [[Freedom of speech|free expression]], and access to information.
:(4) Countries have obligations to protect [[human rights]], whether exercised online or offline.
:(5) The ability to innovate, develop technical capacity, grasp economic opportunities, and promote freedom of expression  online is best realized in cooperation with all stakeholders.
:(6) Proposals have been, and will likely continue to be, put forward at international regulatory bodies that would fundamentally alter the [[Internet governance|governance]] and operation of the Internet.
:(7) The proposals would attempt to justify increased government control over the Internet and could undermine the current multistakeholder model that has enabled the Internet to flourish and under which the private sector, civil society, academia, and individual users play an important role in charting its direction.
:(8) The proposals would diminish the freedom of expression on the Internet in favor of government control over content.
:(9) The position of the United States Government has been and is to advocate for the flow of information free from  government control.
:(10) This Administration and past Administrations have made a strong commitment to the multistakeholder model of Internet  governance and the promotion of the global benefits of the Internet.

'''SEC. 2. POLICY REGARDING INTERNET GOVERNANCE.'''
It is the policy of the United States to preserve and advance the successful multistakeholder model that governs the Internet.

''End legislation text.''

==Procedural history==

===House===
H.R. 1580 was introduced into the House of Representatives by [[Greg Walden|Rep. Greg Walden (R-OR)]] on April 16, 2013.&lt;ref name="1580sum"/&gt;  The bill was referred to the [[United States House Committee on Energy and Commerce]] and then the [[United States House Energy Subcommittee on Communications and Technology]].

As of May 13, 2013, the bill had 32 co-sponsors, all of them original co-sponsors that had signed up as co-sponsors on April 16, 2013.&lt;ref name=1580cosponsors&gt;{{cite web|title=H.R. 1580 - Cosponsors|url=http://beta.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/house-bill/1580/cosponsors|publisher=United States Congress|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Of these co-sponsors, 26 were [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] and 6 were [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref name="1580cosponsors"/&gt;

A [[Congressional Budget Office]] report from May 2, 2013, indicated that "based on information from the Federal Communications Commission and the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, CBO estimates that implementing the bill would not have an effect on spending subject to appropriation because the workloads of those agencies would not be affected."&lt;ref name=1580cbo&gt;{{cite web|title=CBO H.R. 1580|url=http://www.cbo.gov/publication/44123|publisher=Congressional Budget Office|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The bill was reported out of committee on May 3, 2013, alongside [http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-113hrpt50/pdf/CRPT-113hrpt50.pdf House Report 113-50].  The House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] announced on Friday May 10, 2013, that H.R. 1580 would be considered the following week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Majority Leader 5-13-13 |url=http://majorityleader.gov/floor/5-13-13.pdf |publisher=House Majority Leader |accessdate=13 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015230409/http://majorityleader.gov/floor/5-13-13.pdf |archivedate=15 October 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Debate and discussion==

The [[Internet Association]], a [[lobbying]] organization, released a statement on April 18, 2013 expressing its support for the legislation.  In their statement, they argued that "the unique nature of the Internet – free from government control and governed by multiple stakeholders – has unleashed unprecedented entrepreneurialism, creativity, innovation, and freedom far beyond imagination. Preserving a free Internet for all people is essential to the preservation of political and economic liberty."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Internet Association’s Statement on H.R. 1580, A Bill to Affirm the Policy of the United States Regarding Internet Governance.|url=http://internetassociation.org/the-internet-associations-statement-on-h-r-1580-a-bill-to-affirm-the-policy-of-the-united-states-regarding-internet-governance/|publisher=Internet Association|accessdate=13 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Section 2 of the legislation text was altered during the committee process in order to gain support from Congressional Democrats.&lt;ref name=eggerton1&gt;{{cite news|last=Eggerton|first=John|title=House E&amp;C Unanimously Approves Global Internet Freedom Bill|url=http://www.multichannel.com/technology/house-ec-unanimously-approves-global-internet-freedom-bill/142786|accessdate=13 May 2013|newspaper=Multi Channel News|date=April 17, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The original concluding statement of the bill included the phrase "free from government control" seen in the [https://web.archive.org/web/20140728185652/http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/sites/default/files/documents/Text-HR-Affirm-US-Internet-Governance-2013-4-10.pdf Discussion Draft].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bill Text of H.R.___, "A bill to affirm the policy of the United States regarding Internet governance" |url=http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=document/bill-text-of-hr-a-bill-to-affirm-the-policy-of-the-united-states-regarding-internet-governa |publisher=Democrats - Committee on Energy and Commerce |accessdate=13 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140731010441/http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=document%2Fbill-text-of-hr-a-bill-to-affirm-the-policy-of-the-united-states-regarding-internet-governa |archivedate=31 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Henry Waxman|Rep. Henry Waxman (D-CA)]] stated that Democrats objected to the language because they fears it would restrict the [[Federal Communications Commission]] and its ability to enforce its own rules of [[Net neutrality in the United States|network neutrality]].&lt;ref name="eggerton1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11476">The '''[[Attorney General]] for Northern Ireland''' is the chief legal adviser to the [[Northern Ireland Executive]] for both civil and criminal matters that fall within the devolved powers of the [[Northern Ireland Assembly]]. The Attorney General for Northern Ireland is also responsible for appointing the Director and Deputy Director of the [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.attorneygeneralni.gov.uk/about-us|website=Attorney General for Northern Ireland|accessdate=24 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original post was formed in 1921 with the establishment of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] and was always held by an [[Ulster Unionist Party]] MP.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/administration.html The Government of Northern Ireland: Attorney General]&lt;/ref&gt; A Deputy Attorney General briefly held office in 1946, when the post was held by [[Edmond Warnock|Edmond Warnock MP]] (21 June – 11 September).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.election.demon.co.uk/stormont/administration.html The Government of Northern Ireland: Deputy Attorney General]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Attorney General for England and Wales]] performed the role of Attorney General for Northern Ireland after the prorogation of the [[Parliament of Northern Ireland]] in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Section 1(2) of the Northern Ireland (Temporary Provisions) Act 1972 and section 10 of the Northern Ireland Constitution Act 1973&lt;/ref&gt; These office-holders were always [[United Kingdom Government]] Ministers.

A '''biogenic substance''' is a product made by or of life forms. The term encompasses constituents, secretions, and metabolites of [[plants]] or [[animal]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biomedical Applications of Polymeric Materials and Composites|last1=Raju Francis|first1= D. |last2=Sakthi |first2=Kumar|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In context of [[molecular biology]], biogenic substances are referred to as [[biomolecule|biomolecules]]. 

==Examples==
*[[Coal]] and [[Petroleum|oil]] are possible examples of constituents which may have undergone changes over [[geologic time]] periods.
*[[Chalk]] and [[limestone]] are examples of secretions (marine [[animal shell]]s) which are of geologic age.
*[[grass]] and [[wood]] are biogenic constituents of contemporary origin.
*[[Pearls]], [[silk]] and [[ambergris]] are examples of secretions of contemporary origin.
*Biogenic [[neurotransmitters]].

== Abiogenic (opposite) ==
An '''abiogenic''' substance or process does not result from the present or past activity of living [[organism]]s. Abiogenic products may, e.g., be [[mineral]]s, other [[inorganic compound]]s, as well as simple [[organic compound]]s (e.g. [[Methane#Extraterrestrial_methane|extraterrestrial methane]], see also [[abiogenesis]]).

{{refimprove|date=December 2017}}
'''Carl Joachim Friedrich''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|r|iː|d|r|ɪ|k}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfʀiːdʀɪç|lang}}; born June 5, 1901, [[Leipzig]], [[German Empire]] – September 19, 1984, [[Lexington, Massachusetts]]) was a German-American professor and [[political theorist]].

His writings on [[law]] and [[constitutionalism]] made him one of the world's leading political scientists in the post-[[World War II]] period. He is one of the most influential scholars of [[totalitarianism]].

==Biography==
Born on June 5, 1901, in Leipzig, the site of the first significant defeat of the Napoleonic armies, Friedrich was the son of renowned professor of medicine [[Paul Leopold Friedrich]], the inventor of the surgical rubber glove, and a Prussian countess of the von [[Bülow]] family. He attended the [[Gymnasium Philippinum]] from 1911 to 1919, where he received an elite German secondary education focusing on classical languages and literature (at his American naturalization proceeding, he described his religion as "[[Homer]]"). Friedrich studied under [[Alfred Weber]], the brother of [[Max Weber]], at the [[University of Heidelberg]], where he graduated in 1925, having also attended several other universities and even put in a brief stint working in the Belgian coal mines.

Friedrich's family had strong ties to the [[United States]]. His brother, Otto Friedrich, went on to become an industrialist prominent in the German rubber industry. Both brothers lived and studied in America on and off immediately after [[World War I]], but Carl elected to remain in the United States and Otto to return to Germany. They temporarily broke off relations during the 1940s because of Otto's allegiance to the Nazi party and prominent role in German industry during the Third Reich, but they reestablished contact after the end of [[World War II]].

In the 1920s, while a student in the United States, Carl founded, and was president of, the [[German Academic Exchange Service]], through which he first met the love of his life, Lenore Pelham, also a writer and then a student at [[Rockford College]], outside [[Chicago]]. The two later married. In 1926, he was appointed as a lecturer in Government at [[Harvard University]]. He received his Ph.D. from Heidelberg in 1930. When [[Hitler]] came to power, he decided to remain in the United States and become a naturalized citizen. He was appointed Professor of Government at Harvard in 1936.

Friedrich's main areas of thought were the problems of leadership and bureaucracy in government, public administration, and comparative political institutions. An extremely popular lecturer, Friedrich also wrote prolifically, producing 31 volumes on political history, government, and philosophy and editing another 22 (then the second most in Harvard's history). In the 1930s, Professor Friedrich also played a leading role, with one of his students, the then-unknown [[David Riesman]], by his side, in efforts to help Jewish scholars, lawyers, and journalists who were fleeing Nazi Germany and other Fascist regimes resettle in the United States. He persuaded one of them, the pianist [[Rudolf Serkin]], to give a concert at his farm in [[Brattleboro, Vermont]], an event which led to the establishment of the [[Marlboro Music School and Festival|Marlboro Music Festival]].

An expert on German constitutional law and the conditions surrounding its breakdown, Friedrich supported [[representative democracy]]. He strongly opposed direct democracy, however, particularly the use (or misuse) of referendums, as leading to totalitarianism. He stressed the necessity for maintaining the rule of law, supplemented by a strong infrastructure of civil institutions, and was highly suspicious of grass-roots popular movements.

During World War II, Friedrich helped found the [[School of Overseas Administration]] to train officers for military work abroad and served as its director from 1943 to 1946. He also served on the Executive Committee of the Council for Democracy, concerned with convincing the American people of the necessity for fighting totalitarianism and with strengthening national morale.

Friedrich, who was arguably the most knowledgeable scholar in his field (of German Constitutional history) of his time, was endowed with a healthy self-regard. Indeed, some of his colleagues at Harvard regarded him as a "somewhat hybristic person who was overly confident of his own abilities."&lt;ref&gt;Edmund Spevack, ''Allied Control and German Freedom: American Political and Ideological Influences on the Framing of the West German Basic Law (Grundgesetz)'' (Munster: Verlag), p. 192.&lt;/ref&gt;

Friedrich was the author of an article "Poison in Our System" for the June 1941 issue of the ''Atlantic Monthly'', criticizing ''Songs For John Doe'', an album of songs against Roosevelt's peacetime draft (issued in May 1941, before Hitler's Germany had declared war on the United States), by the [[Almanac Singers]], who included the then twenty-one-year-old [[Pete Seeger]], performing under the pseudonym 'Pete Bowers'. Friedrich was apparently as alarmed by the potential for uncontrolled spread of such topical songs as he was by their (fairly innocuous by current standards) content, and opined that "mere" legal suppression would be an inadequate antidote, calling for the establishment of civilian pressure groups to take cultural countermeasures:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
These recordings are distributed under the innocuous appeal: "Sing out for Peace". Yet they are strictly subversive and illegal. . . The three records sell for one dollar and you are asked to "play them in your home, play them in your union hall, take them back to your people." Probably some of these songs fall under the criminal provisions of the Selective Service Act, and to that extent it is a matter for the Attorney-General. But you never can handle situations of this kind democratically by mere suppression. Unless civic groups and individuals will make a determined effort to counteract such appeals by equally effective methods, democratic morale will decline.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in {{cite web |url=http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-02-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130603002452/http://www.peteseeger.net/poison.htm |archivedate=2013-06-03 |df= }} Copies of ''Songs for John Doe'' were destroyed later that same year after Hitler invaded the USSR. Military intelligence and the FBI searched for this supposedly "subversive" material but were unable to find any copies, only locating the Almanac Singers themselves the following year. By that time Hitler had declared war on the USA and the Almanacs (and virtually all Americans) now fully supported the war, and had even issued another album, ''Dear Mr. President'', (in January 1942, after Pearl Harbor) of songs to that effect.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

From 1946 to 1948, Friedrich served as Constitutional and Governmental Affairs Adviser to the Military Governor of Germany, General [[Lucius D. Clay]]. He advised the American military on the [[denazification]] of [[Occupied Germany]] and participated in work leading to the drafting of the West German Basic Law and the creation of Germany's [[States of Germany|States' constitutions]]. He later advised on the constitutions of [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Virgin Islands]], and [[Israel]], among others. Between 1955 and 1971, Friedrich was Eaton Professor of the Science of Government at Harvard University and Professor of Political Science at the University of Heidelberg from 1956 to 1966.

He taught alternately at Harvard and Heidelberg until his retirement in 1971. He later taught at the [[University of Manchester]] and [[Duke University]], among others. He also served as president of the [[American Political Science Association]] in 1962 and of the [[International Political Science Association]] from 1967-70. In 1967, Friedrich was awarded the Knight Commander's Cross of the [[Federal Cross of Merit|German Order of Merit]] by the President of the Federal Republic of Germany.

Professor Friedrich's many students included such noted political theorists as [[Judith Shklar]], [[Benjamin Barber]], and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]].

==Ideas==
Friedrich's concept of a "good democracy" rejected [[basic democracy]] as totalitarian. Some of the assumptions of Friedrich's theory of totalitarianism, particularly his acceptance of [[Carl Schmitt]]'s idea of the "constitutional state", are viewed as potentially anti-democratic by [[Hans J. Lietzmann]]. Schmitt believed that the sovereign is above the law. [[Klaus von Beyme]] sees the main focus of Friedrich's theories as the "creation and preservation of robust institutions". This can be seen as influencing his work on the creation of Germany's States' constitutions. His best guess as to when this might occur was the year 2000.{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}

'''Concerned United Birthparents, Inc.''' (CUB), a [[not for profit|non-profit]] organization established in 1976, is one of two primary nationwide organizations offering support to the biological parents of adopted people in the United States. The organization is credited with the creation of the term "birthparent."

==History==

In the 1970s, support groups for mothers and for adoptees began to proliferate. The first groups were sponsored by adoptees' rights organizations, such as the [[Adoptees' Liberty Movement Association]] (ALMA), which was founded by adoptee Florence Fisher in 1971. Soon after, in 1976, Concerned United Birthparents (CUB) was founded by surrendering mother Lee Cambell.&lt;ref name=Fessler&gt;A. Fessler, ''The Girls Who Went Away: The Hidden History of Women Who Surrendered Children for Adoption in the Decades Before Roe v. Wade.'' New York: Penguin Books. 2006; pg. ???&lt;/ref&gt; The original mission was "to provide support for birthparents who have relinquished a child to adoption; to provide resources to help prevent unnecessary family separations; to educate the public about the life-long impact on all who are touched by adoption; and to advocate for fair and ethical adoption laws, policies, and practices."

A 2003 revision of this statement formally extended CUB’s area of emphasis to include "all family members separated by adoption rather than birth parents alone.&lt;ref name=Herman&gt;Ellen Herman, [http://pages.uoregon.edu/adoption/people/CUB.htm "Concerned United Birthparents,"] The Adoption History Project, University of Oregon, pages.uoregon.edu/&lt;/ref&gt;  "CUB grew rapidly in the late 1970s and early 1980s, drawing new members from around the country."&lt;ref name=Solinger&gt;Rickie Solinger, ''Beggers and Choosers: How the Politics of Choice Shapes Adoption, Abortion, and Welfare in the United States.'' New York: Hill and Wang, 2001; pp. 70-92, 107-120.&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of mid-2013 CUB maintained headquarters in [[Encinitas, California]]. The group currently has 10 chapters and over 400 members around the United States.&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;

CUB is actively interested in search-related issues, and new members may insert free ads in the organization's newsletter. CUB members believe adoption is not always necessary, especially when the birthparent's problem is a temporary one, such as inadequate finances or lack of emotional support. The members can provide assistance to birthparents for whom adoption is not the first choice yet who see no other answer. The organization also works for changes in adoption policy.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Adamec and William Pierce, [http://encyclopedia.adoption.com/entry/Concerned-United-Birthparents-Inc-CUB/89/1.html "Concerned United Birthparents, Inc. (CUB),"] ''Encyclopedia of Adoption.'' Second Edition. Facts on File, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term "Birthparents"==

According to adoption historian Ellen Herman, CUB organizer Lee Campbell and her co-founders were the first to coin the term "birthmother" (and by extension "birthparents") in an effort to describe the relationship between the biological parents and the child put up for adoption in a new way.&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt; The term was introduced as a compromise between "natural mother" and "biological mother."&lt;ref name=Herman /&gt;

According to Campbell:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We didn't want to upset adoptive parents with ‘natural.’ And ‘biological’ now made us gag. 'Biological,' we felt, was descriptive of a mechanical incubator or unfeeling baby machine. 'Birth' was the key. With 'birth parents' as one word...we were like other one-word progenitors, like grandparents."&lt;ref&gt;Lee Campbell in Solinger, ''Beggars and Choosers,'' page unspecified, quoted in Claud, [http://www.adoptionbirthmothers.com/the-origin-of-the-word-birthmother/ "The Origin of the Word Birthmother," Musings of the Lame: My Life as a BirthMother and What I Learned Too Late,"] www.adoptionbirthmothers.com/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Edward M. Fuller &amp; Company''' was a prominent [[New York City|New York]] [[stock brokerage]]. Founded in 1914 and owned by the sole partners William Frank McGee and Edward M. Fuller, by 1922 it was the largest brokerage on the [[Little Board]]. The firm went bankrupt in 1922, resulting in a high-profile legal case and indictments against the former partners.

==History==
===Founding and new branches===

The [[New York City]] brokerage firm Edward M. Fuller &amp; Company was founded in 1914.&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless/&gt; The firm joined as a member of the [[Consolidated Stock Exchange of New York]] in February 1918,&lt;ref name=nyt-infolost/&gt; and remained listed as of 1922.&lt;ref name=amex&gt;{{cite book |last=Sobel |first=Robert  |date= |title=AMEX: A History of the American Stock Exchange |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SzJ39Bi9G6oC&amp;pg=PA31&amp;lpg=PA31&amp;dq=%22William+Silkworth%22+consolidated+-duncan&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TjElxkRj7W&amp;sig=QFTEWwy9R0qDEnbo1-CHv0UUoPU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjLgOq18JPTAhXJLmMKHdu9BzAQ6AEIGjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22William%20Silkworth%22%20consolidated%20-duncan&amp;f=false |location= |publisher= |page=30 |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1922, it was the largest brokerage house on the Consolidated Exchange, with only two members of the firm: Edward M. Fuller and W. F. McGee. There were two offices in New York, one uptown and one at 50 Broad Street.&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless/&gt; By late June 1922, it had successful branches in [[Chicago]], [[Boston]], [[Cleveland]], [[Pittsburgh]], and [[Uniontown, Pennsylvania]]. The firm had the accounts of 1,500 to 1,800 people, with 2,100 customers in Chicago.&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=E.M.

Fuller's office remained at 50 Broad Street. That month, a woman was given a suspended sentence for threatening Fuller with a non-existent gun at his office over an alleged agreement between her, the brokerage, and [[Arnold Rothstein]].&lt;ref name=nyt-mercy&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=June 16, 1922 |title=Mercy for Unruly Woman; Miss Black Gets Suspended Sentence for Annoying Broker. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1922/06/16/archives/mercy-for-unruly-woman-miss-black-gets-suspended-sentence-for.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bankruptcy===
In February 1922 all trading records at the Consolidated Stock Exchange were broken after months of good business. Later that month, however, several brokerages and firms within the exchange failed "without warning," shocking the industry.&lt;ref name=amex/&gt; In mid-July a new series of unexpected failures occurred at Consolidated, including Edward M. Fuller &amp; Company,&lt;ref name=amex/&gt; which failed on June 27, 1922&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless/&gt; for $6,000,000.&lt;ref name=outsiders-nyt&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1923/06/28/archives/hint-outsiders-got-fullers-millions-creditors-attorney-calls-on.html&lt;/ref&gt; In the bankruptcy petition filed in the U.S. District Court in New York, assets were estimated at $250,000 and liabilities at $500,000. The ''New York Times,'' however, reported that the Chicago outlook was that there were negligible assets to offset the customer claims totaling $1,250,000. Hays, St. John &amp; Moore of 43 Exchange Place were hired as attorneys for the firm.&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless/&gt; 

On June 27, 1922, the firm was suspended from the Consolidated Exchange, with Consolidated president [[William S. Silkworth]] attributing the suspension to "reckless and unbusinesslike methods" and a failure to meet commitments.&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless/&gt; To explain the failure, Silkworth also argued that Edward Fuller had been hit hard in Mexican Petroleum stock.&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless/&gt; However, as W. S. Silkworth's brother George Silkworth had been a partner at Fuller, accusations of insider corruption abounded.&lt;ref name=amex/&gt;  Fuller of [[Great Neck, New York]] did not comment on the failure, while his partner William F. McGee of 73rd Street was also unavailable that day. According to the ''Times'', the next day employees filtered in to find no executives explaining the failure, and everything except furniture removed from the office spaces. The ''Times'' also repeated the rumor that the firm's private files had been broken into and circulated directly after the failure, possibly by a clerk.&lt;ref name=nyt-reckless/&gt;

===Fuller bankruptcy case===
{{Main|Fuller case|l1=''Fuller case''}}
On August 2, 1922, District Attorney Banton was denied access to the books of E. M. Fuller Co. to use in pursuing a case against the firm.&lt;ref name=nyt-access&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=August 3, 1922 |title=Court Denies Banton Use of Fuller Books; Stipulation Made by Brokers When They Failed Upheld by Judge Hand. |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1922/08/03/archives/court-denies-banton-use-of-fuller-books-stipulation-made-by-brokers.html| work=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=May 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Albert Ottinger]] began working on an [[Fuller case|investigation into the Fuller bankruptcy]] in December 1922 out of the Anti-Fraud Bureau in New York.&lt;ref name=amex/&gt; The Ottinger investigation began in late May.&lt;ref name=amex/&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-infolost&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1923/05/22/archives/reports-on-fuller-to-exchange-lost-made-when-broker-now-in-jail.html&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[William S. Silkworth|William Silkworth]] testified about the bankruptcy on June 6, 1923&lt;ref name=amex/&gt; and on June 7 he appeared in the Criminal Courts Building.&lt;ref name=silkworth-target&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date=June 7, 1923 |title=Silkworth, Target of Censure, to Quite the Consolidated.

McKenna failed to implicate Silkworth in the Fuller bankruptcy, he did uncover irregularities in Silkworth's personal finances. The irregularities showed he had made large deposits in March 1922, some related to the Fuller account.&lt;ref name=amex/&gt; 

In mid June 1923, Edward M. Fuller plead guilty to bucketing customers orders. He appeared on June 18, 1923 before Coffin to "reveal the methods of his firm" and the names of his superiors, and the superiors of his partner W. Frank McGee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1923/06/18/archives/fuller-to-reveal-higherups-today-bucket-shop-disclosures-expected.html&lt;/ref&gt; William Silkworth resigned as Consolidated president on June 21, 1923 and soon after went on a "long vacation."&lt;ref name=amex/&gt; After examining the papers of the firm, on June 27, 1923, William M. Chadbourne, counsel for the 4,000 creditors of E.M. Fuller Co., informed [[United States District Attorney]] William Hayward and [[District Attorney]] [[Joab H. Banton]] that the firm had committed "crimes other than bucketing."&lt;ref name=outsiders-nyt/&gt; Edward M. Fuller and William F. McGee were sent to jail on June 6, 1927 by General Session Judge Charles C. Nott.&lt;ref name=nyt-prisontoday&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=FULLER AND M'GEE GO TO PRISON TODAY; Judge Refuses Appeal for a Further Stay of Sentence Imposed Four Years Ago.

The division felt the two men had lost their citizenship through their felony conviction, and that a provision of law deemed them unfit.&lt;ref name=nyt-tobar&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=TO BAR FULLER AND McGEE.; Division of Licenses Reported Averse to Them as Realty Brokers. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1928/06/19/archives/to-bar-fuller-and-mcgee-division-of-licenses-reported-averse-to.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |location= |date=June 18, 1928 |access-date=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Estate planning''' is the process of anticipating and arranging, during a person's life, for the management and disposal of that person's [[Estate (law)|estate]] during the person's life and at and after death, while minimizing gift, estate, generation skipping transfer, and income tax.&lt;ref name="moses"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moses|first1=A. L.|last2=Pope|first2=Adele J.|title=Estate Planning, Disability, and the Durable Power of Attorney|journal=South Carolina Law Review|date=1979|volume=30|page=511|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/sclr30&amp;div=34&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Veasey|first=Westray B.|title=Why You Need an Estate Plan Post 2013 Tax Act|url=http://www.natlawreview.com/article/why-you-need-estate-plan-post-2013-tax-act|accessdate=26 May 2013|newspaper=The [[National Law Review]]|date=May 24, 2013|author2=Craig G. Dalton Jr.|author3=Poyner Spruill LLP}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Laterman|first1=Kaya|title=Estate Planning: Leaving a Home to Heirs While You’re Still Alive|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/08/25/realestate/estate-planning-home.html|accessdate=20 September 2017|publisher=New York Times|date=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Estate planning includes planning for incapacity as well as a process of reducing or eliminating uncertainties over the administration of a [[probate]] and maximizing the value of the estate by reducing [[tax]]es and other expenses. The ultimate goal of estate planning can be determined by the specific goals of the client, and may be as simple or complex as the client's needs dictate. Guardians are often designated for minor children and beneficiaries in [[Capacity (law)|incapacity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Frolik|first1=Lawrence A.|title=Estate Planning for Parents of Mentally Disabled Children|journal=University of Pittsburgh Law Review|date=1978|volume=40|page=305|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/upitt40&amp;div=23&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The law of estate planning overlaps to some degree with [[elder law]], which additionally includes other provisions such as [[long-term care]].&lt;ref name="moses"/&gt;

==Devices==
Estate planning involves the [[Will (law)|will]], [[trust (property)|trusts]], beneficiary designations, [[power of appointment|powers of appointment]], property ownership ([[joint tenancy]] with rights of survivorship, tenancy in common, tenancy by the entirety), gift, and [[power of attorney|powers of attorney]], specifically the durable financial power of attorney and the durable medical power of attorney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=The Basics of Estate Planning|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estate_planning/introduction.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 September 2017|date=20 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More sophisticated estate plans may even cover deferring or decreasing estate taxes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=George|title=A Voluntary Tax? New Perspectives on Sophisticated Estate Tax Avoidance|journal=Columbia Law Review|date=March 1977|volume=77|issue=2|page=161|jstor=1121996}}&lt;/ref&gt; or business succession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zaudtke|first1=David|last2=Ammerman|first2=Doug|title=Family businesses: The next generation|journal=Management Review|date=February 1997|volume=86|issue=2|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/dcec748254f75d35d7689b34392a5437/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=41493|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Wills===
[[Will and testament|Wills]] are a common estate planning tool, and are usually the simplest device for planning the distribution of an estate. It is important that a will be created and executed in compliance with the laws of the jurisdiction where it is created. If it is possible that probate proceedings will occur in a different jurisdiction, it is important also to ensure that the will complies with the laws of that jurisdiction or that the jurisdiction will follow the provisions of a valid out-of-state will even if they might be invalid for a will executed in that jurisdiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=O'Sullivan|first1=Margaret R.|title=Key considerations in multi-jurisdictional and separate situs will planning|url=https://ca.practicallaw.thomsonreuters.com/3-549-3566?transitionType=Default&amp;contextData=(sc.Default)&amp;__lrTS=20170507141912681&amp;firstPage=true&amp;bhcp=1|website=Practical Law|publisher=Thomson Reuters|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trusts ===
A [[Trust law|trust]] may be used as an estate planning tool, to direct the distribution of assets after the person who creates the trust passes away. Trusts may be used to provide for the distribution of funds for the benefit of minor children or developmentally disabled children. For example, a [[spendthrift trust]] may be used to prevent wasteful spending by a [[spendthrift]] child, or a [[special needs trust]] may be used for developmentally disabled children or adults. Trusts offer a high degree of control over management and disposition of assets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Estate planning: Types of trusts|url=http://money.cnn.com/pf/money-essentials-trusts/index.html|accessdate=20 September 2017|agency=CNN Money|date=24 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, certain types of trust provisions can provide for the management of wealth for several generations past the settlor.  Typically referred to as dynasty planning, these types of trust provisions allow for the protection of wealth for several generations after a person's death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Turnier|first1=William J.|last2=Harrison|first2=Jeffery L.|title=A Malthusian Analysis of the So-Called Dynasty Trust|journal=Virginia Tax Review|date=2008|page=779|url=http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/vrgtr28&amp;div=27&amp;id=&amp;page=|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advance directives ===
An estate plan may include the creation of advance directives, documents that direct what will happen to a person's estate and in relation to their personal care if the person becomes legally incapacitated. For example, an estate plan may include a [[healthcare proxy]], [[Power of attorney#Durable|durable power of attorney]], and [[Advance healthcare directive#Living will|living will]].

After widespread [[litigation]] and media coverage surrounding the [[Terri Schiavo]] case, estate planning [[Attorneys in the United States|attorneys]] often advise clients to also create a [[living will]]. Specific final arrangements, such as whether to be buried or cremated, are also often part of the documents.

Income, gift, and estate tax planning plays a significant role in choosing the structure and vehicles used to create an estate plan.

===United States===
In the United States, assets left to a spouse or any qualified charity are not subject to U.S. Federal estate tax. Assets left to any other heir, including the decedent's children, may be taxed if that portion of the estate has a value in excess of the estate tax exemption. As of 2018, the federal estate tax exemption was $11,180,000. For a married couple, the combined exemption is $22,360,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Estate Tax |url=https://www.irs.gov/businesses/small-businesses-self-employed/estate-tax |website=IRS |publisher=Internal Revenue Service |accessdate=22 October 2018 |date=9 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tax strategies====
One way to avoid U.S. Federal estate and gift taxes is to distribute the property in incremental gifts during the person's lifetime. Individuals may give away as much as $15,000 per year (in 2018) without incurring gift tax. Other tax free alternatives include paying a grandchild’s college tuition or medical insurance premiums free of gift tax—but only if the payments are made directly to the educational institution or medical provider.

Other tax advantaged alternatives to leaving property, outside of a will, include qualified or non-qualified retirement plans (e.g. 401(k) plans and IRAs) certain “trustee” bank accounts, transfer on death (or TOD) financial accounts, and life insurance proceeds.

Because life insurance proceeds generally are not taxed for U.S. Federal income tax purposes, a life insurance trust could be used to pay estate taxes. However, if the decedent holds any [[incidents of ownership]] like the ability to remove or change a beneficiary, the proceeds will be treated as part of his estate and will generally be subject to the U.S. Federal estate tax. For this reason, the trust vehicle is used to own the life insurance policy. The trust must be irrevocable to avoid taxation of the life insurance proceeds.

==Probate==
{{main|Probate}}
Countries whose legal systems evolved from the British common law system, like the United States,&lt;ref name="usprobate"&gt;See, e.g., {{cite web|title=When Someone Dies - A Non-Lawyer's Guide to Probate in Washington, DC|url=https://www.lawhelp.org/dc/resource/when-someone-dies-a-non-lawyers-guide-to-probate-in-washington-dc|website=Lawhelp.org|publisher=Council for Court Excellence|accessdate=20 September 2017}}, {{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=How Probate Works|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/estates-wills-trusts/how-probate-works|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=20 September 2017|date=13 June 2017}}, {{cite web|title=Wills, Estates, and Probate|url=http://www.courts.ca.gov/8865.htm|website=Judicial Branch of California|accessdate=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; typically use the probate system for distributing property at death.  Probate is a process where
#the decedent's purported will, if any, is entered in court,
#after hearing evidence from the representative of the estate, the court decides if the will is valid,
#a personal representative is appointed by the court as a fiduciary to gather and take control of the estate's assets,
#known and unknown creditors are notified (through direct notice or publication in the media) to file any claims against the estate,
#claims are paid out (if funds remain) in the order or priority governed by state statute,
#remaining funds are distributed to beneficiaries named in the will, or heirs (next-of-kin) if there is no will, and
#the probate judge closes out the estate.

===Probate avoidance===
Due to the time and expenses associated with the traditional probate process, modern estate planners frequently counsel clients to enact probate avoidance strategies. Some common probate-avoidance strategies include:
#revocable living trusts,
#joint ownership of assets and naming death beneficiaries,
#making lifetime gifts, and
#purchasing [[life insurance]].

If a revocable living trust is used as a part of an estate plan, the key to probate avoidance is ensuring that the living trust is "funded" during the lifetime of the person establishing the trust. After executing a trust agreement, the settlor should ensure that all assets are properly re-registered in the name of the living trust. If assets (especially higher value assets and real estate) remain outside of a trust, then a probate proceeding may be necessary to transfer the asset to the trust upon the death of the testator.

===Designation of a beneficiary===
Although legal restrictions may apply, it is broadly possible to convey property outside of probate, through such tools as a living trust, forms of joint property ownership that include a right of survivorship, payable on death account, or beneficiary designation on a financial account or insurance policy.  Beneficiary designations are considered distributions under the law of contracts and cannot be changed by statements or provisions outside of the contract, such as a clause in a will.

In the [[United States]], without a beneficiary statement, the default provision in the contract or custodian-agreement (for an IRA) will apply, which may be the estate of the owner resulting in higher taxes and extra fees. Generally, beneficiary designations are made for life insurance policies, employee benefits, (including retirement plans and group life insurance) and Individual Retirement Accounts. 
*'''Identity''': A specific, identifiable individual or business must be designated as beneficiary for life insurance policies. Businesses may not be the beneficiary of a group life insurance policy or a retirement plan.
*'''Contingent beneficiary''': If the primary beneficiary predeceases the [[contract]] owner, the contingent beneficiary becomes the designated beneficiary. If a contingent beneficiary is not named, the default provision in the contract or custodian-agreement applies.
*'''Death''': For retirement plan assets, at the account owner's death, the primary beneficiary may select his or her own beneficiaries if the remaining balance will be paid out over time. There is no obligation to retain the contingent beneficiary designated by the IRA owner.
*'''Multiple accounts''': A policy owner or retirement account owner can designate multiple beneficiaries.  However, retirement plans governed by ERISA provide protections for spouses of account holders that prevent the disinheritance of a living spouse.

===Mediation===
[[Mediation]] serves as an alternative to a full-scale litigation to settle disputes. At a mediation, family members and beneficiaries discuss plans on transfer of assets. Because of the potential conflicts associated with blended families, step siblings, and multiple marriages, creating an estate plan through mediation allows people to confront the issues head-on and design a plan that will minimize the chance of future family conflict and meet their financial goals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3940">'''European Union shipping law''' is the body of law developed by the [[European Union]] ("EU") relating to [[shipping]] or [[sea|maritime]] matters.

== Introduction ==
Shipping is extremely important to the European Union. The EU is the world's largest [[trading bloc]] and therefore very dependent on shipping. About 90% of its trade with the rest of the world is carried by sea and around 40% of its internal trade is carried by sea. The EU has a [[coastline]] twice that of [[Russia]] and three times that of the US so it is acutely aware of maritime safety and environmental issues. More than 350 million passengers sail annually through its 1200 ports. It is also a major [[employer]] in the [[European Community|EC]] and a significant source of foreign income.

== Origins ==
In principle, all of [[EU law]] applies to the maritime sector. Nonetheless, despite the [[Treaty]] establishing the [[European Economic Community]] (now the European Community (the "EC")) having been signed on 25 March 1957, it was not until the 1970s, that there was any serious attempt to develop European laws relating to shipping. During the 1970s, a number of attempts were made to develop laws in particular areas such as liner conferences, the [[Environmental policy|environment]] and [[pilotage]]. It was not however until the 1980s, particularly 1986, that a serious body of EC [[shipping law]] evolved. On 22 December 1986, the Council of Ministers adopted four Regulations which lay the foundations for most of EC shipping law. In the 1990s and 2000s so far, the law has developed in various areas including competition and [[Anti-trust legislation|anti-trust law]] but also in the areas as safety, the environment, ports and employment.

== Freedom to Provide Services ==
In principle, all EU [[shipowner]]s are free to provide maritime services either between Member States or within Member States (i.e., provide [[cabotage]] services). The right to provide international maritime services (provided one EU port was involved) is enshrined in Regulation 4055/86.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=CELEX:31986R4055:EN:NOT Council Regulation (EEC) No 4055/86 of 22 December 1986 applying the principle of freedom to provide services to maritime transport between Member States and between Member States and third countries]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Competition Law ==
One of the most controversial topics is the application of [[competition law]] to [[maritime transport]] and, in particular, liner conferences.

Competition law is the set of legal rules designed to ensure freedom or rivalry in the marketplace. It is known as "antitrust law" in the US.

Between 1986 and 2006, the EC had a special regime exempting many liner conferences from the application of the prohibition on anti-competitive arrangements (i.e. Article 81 of the EC Treaty (now Article 101 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union)). This exemption was contained in Regulation 4056/86 which has now been repealed, effective October 2008. Many other countries such as [[Singapore]], [[Japan]] and [[China]], in an effort to prevent destructive competition, are allowing price-setting immunity of liner conferences.

EU State aid law is becoming of increasing significance in the sector.  Ports have to ensure that developments are compliant with State aid law and Member States may therefore have to notify proposed aid schemes to the European Commission for prior approval.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24488">'''Evidence-Based Policing''' (EBP) is an approach to policy making and tactical decision-making for police departments. It is an extension of [[evidence-based medicine]], [[evidence-based management]] and [[evidence-based policy]].

Advocates of evidence-based policing emphasize the value of statistical analysis, empirical research and ideally [[randomized controlled trial]]s. EBP does not dismiss more traditional drivers of police decision-making, but seeks to raise awareness and increase the application of scientific testing, targeting and tracking of police resources, especially during times of budget cuts and greater public scrutiny.

== Origins ==
Experiments had been used in earlier decades to find better policing methods, before [[Lawrence W. Sherman|Lawrence Sherman]] first outlined a definition of "evidence-based policing" in 1998.

The [[Police Foundation]] was founded in 1970 and in 1971-72 worked with the [[Kansas City Police Department (Missouri)|Kansas City Police Department]] to carry out a [[Kansas City preventive patrol experiment|landmark study on car patrols]]. In the early 1980s, Sherman worked with Richard Berk and the Police Foundation to carry out the [[Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.policefoundation.org/publication/the-minneapolis-domestic-violence-experiment/|title=The Minneapolis Domestic Violence Experiment {{!}} Police Foundation|website=Policefoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The study showed that arresting [[domestic violence]] suspects was a deterrent against repeat offending.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Lawrence; Richard Berk (1984). "The Specific Deterrent Effects of Arrest for Spouse Assault: A Field Experiment". American Sociological Review 49(2): 261-272.&lt;/ref&gt; The study had a "virtually unprecedented impact in changing then-current police practices."&lt;ref name="buzawa"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Buzawa, E. S. |author2=C. G. Buzawa |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Domestic Violence: The Criminal Justice Response|publisher=Sage|year=1990 |pages=94–99|isbn=0-7619-2448-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sherman later worked with fellow criminologist [[David Weisburd]] for a 1995 study which showed the efficacy of focusing police crime prevention resources on small hot spots of crime.&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Lawrence; David Weisburd (1995). "General Deterrent Effects of Police Patrol in Crime ‘Hot Spots’: A Randomized Study". Justice Quarterly 12 (4): 625–648.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1998 [[Police Foundation]] "Ideas in American Policing" lecture, Sherman outlined the concept of "evidence-based policing".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.policefoundation.org/content/evidence-based-policing|title=Evidence-Based Policing - Police Foundation|website=Policefoundation.org|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; His core idea was that police practice can be made far more effective if tactics proven to work during controlled field experiments are prioritized. [[Angel Cabrera]] later described Sherman as being the "father" of evidence-based policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/CabreraAngel/status/321330010600386560|title=Ángel Cabrera on Twitter|publisher=[[Twitter]]|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2000, Sherman co-founded the [[Campbell Collaboration]]'s Crime and Justice Group, which has pursued the synthesis of research evidence on the effectiveness of policing and other crime prevention practices. In 2013 Sherman established the [http://cambridge-ebp.net/index.php Cambridge Centre for Evidence-Based Policing] as a global police training and research consultancy service for members, and
in 2017 he launched the [https://link.springer.com/journal/41887 Cambridge Journal of Evidence-Based Policing] as the membership journal of the Cambridge Centre. The Journal's priority is to publish original, applied research led by "pracademic" police officers, with many articles based on master's degree theses completed under supervision of Sherman and his Cambridge colleagues, Heather Strang and Sir Denis O'Connor, by police leaders who were mid-career, part-time students in the [http://www.crim.cam.ac.uk/courses/police Cambridge Police Executive Programme].     

The first professional Society of Evidence-Based Policing was founded at Cambridge University in 2010, and now has some 2,000 members from mostly UK police agencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sebp.police.uk/|title=sebp|website=sebp|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, police in collaboration with the University of Queensland established the [http://www.anzsebp.com Australian-New Zealand Society of Evidence-Based Policing], which now has over 2000 members.  In 2015, both Canada,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.can-sebp.net|title=Canadian Society of Evidence Based Policing|website=Canadian Society of Evidence Based Policing|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the United States established their own branches of this learned professional society. The Police Foundation provided support for the establishment of the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing, as it once did to create the [[PERF|Police Executive Research Forum (PERF)]] and the [[National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives|National Organization of Black Law Enforcement Executives (NOBLE)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.policefoundation.org/about/history/|title=History {{!}} Police Foundation|website=Policefoundation.org|access-date=2016-11-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scope==
Evidence can be used in a number of ways to support policing:

===Enforcement===
Policy-makers may factor in the population-wide priorities in policing action. Freedom from violent coercion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.madinamerica.com/2013/08/societies-little-coercion-little-mental-illness/|title=Societies With Little Coercion Have Little Mental Illness - Mad In America|author=Bruce Levine|date=30 August 2013|website=Madinamerica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; is associated with happier populations, which may inform the use of force, or actions that nominally enforce laws but raise levels of community violence. Law enforcement may make enforcement decisions on the basis of flow-through effects in subsequent crimes. For instance, a 2011 meta-analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hri.global/files/2011/03/25/ICSDP_Violence_and_Enforcement_Report_March_2011.pdf |title=Effect of drug law enforcement on drug market violence: A systematic review |format=PDF|website=Hri.global |date= |accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; drug market disruption, such as seizures of illicit goods or arrests of organised crime figures, as with drug prohibition increases levels of community violence and associated crimes. This contraindicates certain drug control strategies. And, evidence from illicit distribution/trafficking networks suggest that gang membership isn't important&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.socnet.2017.04.003 |title=The independent's edge in an illegal drug distribution setting: Levitt and Venkatesh revisited |journal=Social Networks |volume=51 |page=118 |year=2017 |last1=Morselli |first1=Carlo |last2=Paquet-Clouston |first2=Masarah |last3=Provost |first3=Chloé }}&lt;/ref&gt; to the flow of resources between violent, competing groups. With community outcomes in mind, this would contraindicate bans on gang membership. The use of evidence in this manner sometimes leads to law enforcement decisions that contrast with popular intuition. For instance, gang members are not prohibited from joining the United States military.

===Education===
Police may also share evidence about the consequences of crime as a preventative measure. For instance, politically motivated groups that use violent methods, or escalate from nonviolent to violent methods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gwern.net/Terrorism-is-not-about-Terror|title=Terrorism-is-not-about-Terror |website=Gwern.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; are less likely to gain the compliance of governments, suggesting that terrorism is less effective than civil action. And, bank robbery typically only returns around 15,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/science/2012/06/economists-demonstrate-exactly-why-bank-robbery-is-a-bad-idea/|title=Economists demonstrate exactly why bank robbery is a bad idea|website=Arstechnica.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; UK pounds per person.

===Sentencing===
Evidence can also be used in sentencing. Certainty of punishment, and therefore consistency of sentencing deters crime far&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ssc.wisc.edu/~sdurlauf/networkweb1/London/Criminology1-15-01.pdf|format=PDF|title=Integrating Celerity, Impulsivity, and Extralegal Sanction Threats into a Model of General Deterrence: Theory and Evidence |website=Ssc.wisc.edu|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; more effectively than the imminence or severity of punishment.

In 2008, Sherman made EBP the core of the Police Executive Programme at [[Cambridge University]], a part-time course of study for senior police leaders from around the world to earn a Diploma or Master’s in applied criminology. In that year, the [[National Policing Improvement Agency]] (NPIA) funded the first international conference on EBP, which was attended by police executives from Asia, Australia, Europe and the US. Since then the conference has been held each July, with the 10th International Conference in 2017 attended by over 300 police and scholars from six continents.

In 2010, a group of UK police officers founded the Society of Evidence-Based Policing, and elected Sherman Honorary President, along with Sir Peter Fahy, Chief Constable of the UK's Greater Manchester Police; as of 2015 the Society has over 2,800 members, including its 750-member Australia-New Zealand affiliate,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.anzsebp.com/|title=2018 4th Annual ANZSEBP Conference|website=Anzsebp.com|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; consisting primarily UK police officers but with membership from Australia to Argentina and North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sebp.police.uk/index.php] {{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Society's twice-annual UK meetings have attracted over 200 attendees per meeting (including 2015), as well as press coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thetimes.co.uk/article/18c-outside-then-its-the-perfect-day-for-a-crime-t39s8cjcq20|title=18C outside?

In 2012, the UK Home Office founded the [[College of Policing]], which took over many of the responsibilities of the National Police Improvement Agency (formally abolished in 2013). One of the College's five strategic objectives is "identifying, developing and promoting good practice based on evidence". The College is committed to identifying and sharing with police practitioners "what works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.college.police.uk|title=College of Policing|website=College.police.uk.|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, the UK's largest police force, London's [[Metropolitan Police Service]] committed to "crime fighting based on what we know works".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Metropolitan Police Service |title=One Met Strategy 2013/17|page=6|url=http://www.met.police.uk/foi/pdfs/priorities_and_how_we_are_doing/corporate/one_met_mps_strategy_2013_17.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===What Works Center For Crime Reduction Toolkit===
The What Works Centre for Crime Reduction is part of a network of What Works Centres created to provide easy access to robust and comprehensive evidence to guide decision-making on public spending. The Crime Reduction Toolkit is an online tool that allows users to weigh up evidence on the impact, cost and implementation of different interventions and use this to help shape their crime reduction efforts. The What Works Centre Crime Reduction Toolkit currently includes 35 evaluations of interventions and has identified over 300 systematic reviews covering 60 different interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://whatworks.college.police.uk/toolkit/Pages/Toolkit.aspx |title=Crime Reduction Toolkit &amp;#124; College of Policing |website=Whatworks.college.police.uk |date= |accessdate=2018-04-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBP is acknowledged by some senior police leaders as a valuable approach to improve policing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nij.gov/journals/269/Pages/evidence.aspx|title=Being Smart on Crime With Evidence-based Policing - National Institute of Justice|website=National Institute of Justice|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[FBI Academy]] offers a course on EBP.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch&amp;article_id=815&amp;issue_id=22006&amp;#93;# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2018-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071114220634/http://www.policechiefmagazine.org/magazine/index.cfm?fuseaction=display_arch# |archive-date=2007-11-14 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

EBP has become the subject of debate in research journals, deliberating the extent to which policing should be guided by experimental criminology.&lt;ref&gt;Weisburd, David; Cynthia Lum and Anthony Petrosino (2001) "Does Research Design Affect Study Outcomes in Criminal Justice?" Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Sciences vol.578, pp 50-70.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherman, Lawrence (2013) "The Rise of Evidence-Based Policing: Targeting, Testing and Tracking." Crime and Justice vol. 42, pp. 377-431.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Laycock, Gloria (2012) "In support of evidence-based approaches: a response to Lum and Kennedy" Policing 2012 vol 6, pp. 324-326.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lum, Cynthia; Leslie Kennedy (2012) "In support of evidence-based approaches: a rebuttal to Gloria Laycock" Policing 2012 vol 6, pp. 317-323.&lt;/ref&gt; But there is consensus that more needs to be done to bridge the 'translation gap' between frontline police officers and academics.&lt;ref&gt;Lum, Cynthia (2009)"Translating Police Research into Practice" Ideas in American Policing, Washington, DC: Police Foundation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Neyroud Peter|author2=David Weisburd|date=2014|title="Transforming the police through science: some new thoughts on the controversy and challenge of translation" |journal=Translational Criminology Magazine|volume=6|pages=16-19|url=http://cebcp.org/wp-content/TCmagazine/TC6-Spring2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lum, Cynthia (2014) "Policing at a crossroads" Policing vol 8, pp. 1-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Academics from the Department of Criminology, Law and Society at [[George Mason University]] launched the [http://cebcp.org Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy] in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix|title=Evidence-Based Policing Matrix - Center for Evidence-Based Crime Policy|website=Cebcp.org|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their [http://cebcp.org/evidence-based-policing/the-matrix/ Evidence-Based Policing Matrix] records, orders and rates scientific evaluations in policing and seeks to enable police departments to access and assess existing evidence.&lt;ref&gt;Lum, Cynthia; Chris Koper and Cody Telep (2011) "The Evidence-Based Policing Matrix". Journal of Experimental Criminology vol 7(1), pp. 3-26&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, a group of working police officers and crime analysts formed the American Society of Evidence-Based Policing (www.americansebp.com).  This organization was formed with the intent of educating police officers about the concept of EBP, advocating for the use of best available research to drive policing strategies and tactics and facilitating the creation of new research findings by connecting researchers and practitioners.  Membership is open to all serving police officers, civilian staff members, researchers and academics.  The first annual ASEBP conference will be held on the campus of Arizona State University in Phoenix, Arizona on May 22nd and 23rd, 2017 with conference attendees and panelists representing the United States, Canada, Mexico and the United Kingdom.

== Australia ==
The Australia &amp; New Zealand Society of Evidence Based Policing&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; (ANZSEBP) was formed in April 2013 in Brisbane, Australia. The ANZSEBP is a police practitioner-led Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php/committee# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2015-05-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518073745/http://www.anzsebp.com/index.php/committee# |archive-date=2015-05-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mission of the ANZSEBP is to develop, disseminate and advocate for police to use scientific research (“the evidence”) to guide best practice in all aspects of policing. 
 
The Society comprises both full members (current, serving police officers in Australia and New Zealand) and honorary members including police staff members (non-sworn), research professionals and others who aim to make evidence based approaches part of everyday policing in Australia and New Zealand.
 
The ANZSEBP held its inaugural conference at the Australian Institute of Police Management,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aipm.gov.au/|title=Executive Education - Australian Institute of Police Management|website=Australian Institute of Police Management|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sydney, Australia in March 2015.

The Canadian Society of Evidence Based Policing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.can-sebp.net/|title=Canadian Society of Evidence Based Policing|website=Canadian Society of Evidence Based Policing|accessdate=25 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; (CAN-SEBP) was launched in April 2015 in Manchester, UK, as an affiliate of the UK-based Society of Evidence Based Policing, as well as ASEBP and ANZ-SEBP. CAN-SEBP is a collaborative effort between police practitioners and academic researchers aimed at generating actionable research to inform policy, practice, education and training in the field of public safety. Partners in the Society - who maintain executive-level steering and oversight functions - include representatives from several Canadian police forces and universities. Other agencies and researchers serve as active collaborators.    
 
CAN-SEBP's membership consists of active and retired police officers, civilian police members, applied policing researchers, graduate researchers and representatives from provincial, federal and municipal community safety groups.    
 
CAN-SEBP's international advisory group includes: [[David Weisburd|Professor David Weisburd]] ([[George Mason University]]), Mr Peter Neyroud ([[Cambridge University]]), Professor Lorraine Mazerolle&lt;ref name="auto1"/&gt; ([[University of Queensland]]), Chief Superintendent Alex Murray [[West Midlands Police]] (Chair of the UK SEBP) and Assistant Commissioner Peter Martin&lt;ref name="auto2"/&gt; (Chair of the ANZ SEBP).

'''Fry's Island''', also known as '''De Montfort Island''', is an island in the [[River Thames]] in England. The island is on the reach above [[Caversham Lock]] at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Berkshire]]. The centre of Reading is to the south and the suburb of [[Caversham, Berkshire|Caversham]] to the immediate north.

Fry's Island is a natural island, the only access to it being by boat. It is home to a private house (''Demontfort House''), a boatyard with a residence (''Caversham Boat Services'') and a private [[bowls|bowling]] club (the ''Island Bohemian Club''). Each of these occupants runs their own private ferry service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.islandbohemian.co.uk/Location.asp | title = Location | publisher = Island Bohemian Bowling Club | accessdate = 2009-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Fry's Island is famous as the location of a [[trial by combat]] between [[Robert de Montfort]] and [[Henry of Essex]], the standard bearer to [[Henry II of England|King Henry II]].{{citation needed|date=August 2010}} The contest took place while the royal court was in residence at [[Reading Abbey]] in 1163. Robert had accused Henry of Essex of cowardice and treason, because he had dropped the royal standard and called out that the King was dead during a battle with the [[Wales|Welsh]]. Henry of Essex denied these charges.&lt;ref name=hobtbc&gt;{{cite web | last = Ford | first = David Nash | work = Royal Berkshire History | publisher = Nash Ford Publishing | url = http://www.berkshirehistory.com/articles/reading_trial.html | title = Trial by Combat at Reading | accessdate = 2004-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

King Henry decreed that this dispute must be resolved in a trial by combat, to be undertaken on what is now Fry's Island. At the height of the combat, Henry of Essex fell wounded, and believing he was dead the King ordered the monks of the abbey to carry his body away and bury it. However, Henry was still alive, and the [[monk]]s nursed him back to health. Because he had lost the combat he was adjudged guilty as charged and stripped of his lands and honours; however, he was permitted to become a monk at the abbey, where he remained for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=hobtbc/&gt;

The first reference to the Island Bohemian Club dates back to 1908, when it held an [[annual general meeting]] under the name of the Old Codgers Club. The present name was adopted in 1909, and purchased  the freehold of its part of the island in two phases in 1961 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.islandbohemian.co.uk/ClubFormation.asp | title = Club History | publisher = Island Bohemian Bowling Club | accessdate = 2009-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demontfort House was built in 1897. During WW2 the house was used as an American Services 'club'. In the 1960s the house operated as the 'Blue Beat Island Club', the club was the subject of a police raid in 1965.{{Citation needed|reason=Feb 2010|date=February 2010}}

Caversham Boat Services was established in 1970. The residence and large workshop are housed in the former [[Reading Rowing Club]] building built in 1893. The adjacent boatyard of Bridge Boats was established in 1958 as a builder of wooden boats, becoming a boat hire business in the 1980s. The business was taken over and merged with Caversham Boat Services in 2009.{{Citation needed|reason=Feb 2010|date=February 2010}}

The '''Gastein Convention''' ({{lang-de|Gasteiner Konvention}}), also called the ''Convention of Badgastein'', was a [[treaty]] signed at [[Bad Gastein]] in [[Austrian Empire|Austria]] on 14 August 1865.&lt;ref name="EB"&gt;Wolfgang Neugebauer (ed.): ''Handbuch der preußischen Geschichte''. Band 2: ''Das 19. Jahrhundert und große Themen der Geschichte Preußens''. Verlag De Gruyter, Berlin 1992, {{ISBN|3-11-008322-1}}, [https://books.google.de/books?id=LFioWTr-bJwC&amp;pg=PA340&amp;lpg=PA340 p. 340 books.google]&lt;/ref&gt; It embodied agreements between the two principal powers of the [[German Confederation]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] and Austria, over the governing of the so-called 'Elbe Duchies' of [[Duchy of Schleswig|Schleswig]], [[Duchy of Holstein|Holstein]] and [[Saxe-Lauenburg]]. 

==Background==
[[File:Karte Deutsch-Dänischer Krieg Gebietsveränderungen.svg|thumb|left|Schleswig (until 1864 Danish fief), Holstein and Lauenburg (until 1864 German Confederation)]]
The Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein had been united under [[Kingdom of Denmark|Danish]] rule since 1460. While Schleswig north of the [[Eider (river)|Eider]] River was a Danish fief, the Duchies of Holstein officially remained an [[Imperial State|estate]] of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] which the [[Monarchy of Denmark|Kings of Denmark]] held as an Imperial fief. In 1815 King [[Frederick VI of Denmark]] also acquired the adjacent Duchy of Saxe-Lauenburg. Both Holstein and Lauenburg were member states of the German Confederation since 1815. 

When in 1858 the Danish national liberal Council President [[Carl Christian Hall]] drafted the 'November Constitution' in order to link Schleswig more closely to the Danish kingdom, he sparked German protests, and troops of the [[German Confederation]] eventually occupied Holstein and Lauenburg in 1863. In the following [[Second Schleswig War]], Denmark was defeated and according to the [[Treaty of Vienna (1864)|Treaty of Vienna]] signed on 30 October 1864 had to cede the Elbe Duchies to victorious Prussia and Austria. 

After the war, the two powers faced the issue of governing the provinces formerly held by the Danish royal [[House of Glücksburg]] in [[personal union]]. Prussia aimed at the annexation of the territories as [[Provinces of Prussia|provinces]] with her state territory, against the strong resistance of the Austrians, who persisted on the status of autonomous duchies of the Confederation ruled as a [[Condominium (international law)|condominium]]. To ease tensions, the Prussian minister-president [[Otto von Bismarck]] met with the Austrian envoy Gustav von Blome at the spa town of Bad Gastein in the Austrian Alps.

In the negotiations, the administration of the gained territories was split between the two powers: Prussia would rule over Schleswig and Austria over Holstein. Austria would officially renounce Saxe-Lauenburg, which would be ruled by the Prussian king in personal union for a purchase price of 2.5 million [[Danish rigsdaler]]s.

The eleven articles of the agreement signed on 14 August 1865 covered:
* abandoning the shared administration (condominium) of Schleswig and Holstein
* Prussian control of Schleswig
* Austrian control of Holstein (which was sandwiched between Schleswig to the north and Prussian Lauenburg to the south)&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;
* the Prussian crown purchasing Austria's right to Lauenburg
* Prussian transit rights on military roads through Holstein to Schleswig
* Prussian rights to construct a canal and a telegraph-line through Holstein to Schleswig
* setting up a German Confederation Navy
* designating a headquarters for the proposed navy at [[Kiel]] in Holstein under Prussian sovereignty
* designating [[Rendsburg]] as a [[Fortresses of the German Confederation|Fortress of the German Confederation]].
The treaty was ratified by both parties on 19 August. King [[William I, German Emperor|William I of Prussia]] went on to rule Lauenburg in personal union and assumed the ducal title.

==Aftermath==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R15449, Otto von Bismarck.jpg|thumb|Prime Minister Bismarck, 1862]]
Bismarck's negotiation skills had apparently been underestimated by Blome. Though Prussia benefitted from the treaty, the minister-president noted that the 'bonding of cracks' did not answer the [[German question]] nor did it ease the [[Austria–Prussia rivalry]]. Moreover the treaty ran counter to the legal basis of the German Confederation, which led to the refusal by the smaller Confederation states and turned out detrimental to the reputation especially of the Austrian side. The European powers reacted strongly, the French emperor [[Napoleon III]] responded with protest, while the British saw their interests in the North Sea as threatened; the treaty was nevertheless appreciated by [[Russian Empire|Russia]] in view of her enmity with Austria after the [[Crimean War]]. 

The Gastein Convention marked the end off all attempts to seek a peaceful solution of the German question. It soon collapsed due to Bismarck's successful efforts to provoke a war with the Austrian Empire as well as to eliminate Austria from the German Confederation. The Austrian government had tolerated the rule of Duke [[Frederick VIII, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein|Frederick VIII of Schleswig-Holstein]], much to the chagrin of Prussia. On 1 June 1866 Austria asked the [[Federal Convention (German Confederation)|Federal Convention]] for a resolution on the status of Holstein, which Prussia regarded as a breach of the mutual agreement. Under this pretext, Prussian troops entered Holstein nine days later which led to the outbreak of the [[Austro-Prussian War]], also known as the [[Seven Weeks' War]].

The [[Peace of Prague (1866)|Peace of Prague]] in 1866 confirmed Denmark's cession of Schlewig and Holstein, which were both annexed by Prussia, but promised a [[plebiscite]] to decide whether north Schleswig wished to return to Danish rule. This provision was unilaterally set aside by a resolution of Prussia and Austria in 1878. Instead the Prussian [[Province of Schleswig-Holstein]] was created in 1868. Both territories were to be admitted to the ''[[Zollverein]]'' (German Customs Union), headed by Prussia, of which Austria was not a member.&lt;ref name="EB" /&gt;

Oregon|volume=546|page=243|pin=|year=2006}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first major case heard by the [[Roberts Court]] under the new [[Chief Justice of the United States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first = Linda | last = Greenhouse | authorlink = Linda Greenhouse |date = January 8, 2006 | title = Justices Reject U.S. Bid to Block Assisted Suicide |website = [[The New York Times]] | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/18/politics/politicsspecial1/18scotus.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Oregon Death with Dignity Act}}
In November 1994, voters in the state of Oregon approved Measure 16, a [[ballot initiative]] that established the [[Oregon Death with Dignity Act]], with 51.3% of voters supporting it and 48.7% opposing it.&lt;ref name=legbrief&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.oregonlegislature.gov/citizen_engagement/Reports/BB2014OregonDeathwithDignityAct.pdf |title=Background Brief on Oregon Death with Dignity Act |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 2014 |website=Legislative Committee Services |publisher=Oregon State Legislature |accessdate=April 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act legalized [[medical aid in dying]] in the state of Oregon.&lt;ref name=odwda/&gt; The law permits physicians to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a competent adult, agreed by two doctors to be within six months of dying from an incurable condition.&lt;ref name=odwda&gt;[https://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/statute.pdf ORS 127.800 - 127.897]&lt;/ref&gt; 

As of February 29, 2012, the Oregon Public Health Division reported that since "the law was passed in 1997, a total of 935 people have had DWDA prescriptions written and 596 patients (64% of prescriptions) have died from ingesting medications prescribed under the DWDA."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Documents/year16.pdf|title=Oregon’s Death with Dignity Act – 2013 |publisher=Public.health.oregon.gov|accessdate=2014-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of the measure sued, and on December 27, 1994, U.S. District Judge [[Michael Robert Hogan]] issued a preliminary injunction forbidding the state from enforcing the statute,&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=4735473660412083247&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Lee v. Oregon''], 869 F. Supp. 1491 (D. Or. 1994).&lt;/ref&gt; then, on August 3, 1995, declared the law unconstitutional under the [[Equal Protection Clause]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=14156819600097495197&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Lee v. Oregon''], 891 F. Supp. 1429 (D. Or. 1995).&lt;/ref&gt;  However, after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] rejected that reasoning in ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'' (1997), the measure was allowed to take effect.&lt;ref&gt;''Note'', Emily P. Hughes, ''The Oregon Death with Dignity Act: Relief of Suffering at the End of Medicine’s Ability to Heal'', 95 Geo. L.J. 207 (2006).&lt;/ref&gt;  A 1997 referral to voters by the [[Oregon Legislative Assembly]] aimed to repeal the Death with Dignity Act but was defeated by a 60% margin.&lt;ref name=legbrief/&gt;

Members of Congress next sought to have the federal government prosecute physicians obeying the new Oregon law, and DEA Administrator [[Thomas A. Constantine]] told them that he had authority to do so under the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA).&lt;ref name=chicago&gt;[http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1217&amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory Jacob E. Gersen, "Overlapping and Underlapping Jurisdiction in Administrative Law], 2006 Sup. Ct. Rev. 201. {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004135602/http://chicagounbound.uchicago.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1217&amp;context=public_law_and_legal_theory|date=4 October 2017|title=Archived}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, Attorney General [[Janet Reno]] rejected that interpretation of the law and determined the federal government had no power to interfere with physicians obeying the Oregon law.&lt;ref name=chicago/&gt;  Senator [[John Ashcroft]] then supported legislation explicitly granting the Attorney General that authority, but the bills failed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{USBill|105|hr|4006}}, 105th Cong. (1998); {{USBill|105|S|2151}}, 105th Cong. (1999); {{USBill|106|hr|2260}}, 106th Cong. (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;

After Senator Ashcroft became [[United States Attorney General]] in 2001, he secured a memorandum from the [[Office of Legal Counsel]] concluding that physician-assisted suicide violates the CSA.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.justice.gov/file/19206/download ''Whether Physician-Assisted Suicide Serves a “Legitimate Medical Purpose” Under DEA Regulations''], 25 Op. O.L.C. 135 (June 27, 2001). {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171004085716/https://www.justice.gov/file/19206/download|date=4 October 2017|title=Archived}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Id''. relying, ''inter alia'', on [[Neil Gorsuch]], ''The Right to Assisted Suicide and Euthanasia'', 23 Harv. J. L. &amp; Pub. Pol’y 599 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 9, 2001, Attorney General Ashcroft published an "Interpretive Rule" that physician-assisted suicide was not a legitimate medical purpose and that any physician administering federally controlled drugs for that purpose would be in violation of the Controlled Substances Act.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2001/11/09/01-28358/dispensing-of-controlled-substances-to-assist-suicide 66 Fed.

Oregon Attorney General [[Hardy Myers]], joined by a physician, a pharmacist, and a group of terminally ill patients, all from Oregon, filed a challenge to Attorney General Ashcroft's interpretation in the [[United States District Court for the District of Oregon]].&lt;ref name=pewlegal/&gt; On April 17, 2002, U.S. District Judge [[Robert E.

Tallman]] joined by Senior Circuit Judge [[Donald P. Lay]], over the dissent of Senior Circuit Judge [[John Clifford Wallace]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6864220915455147792&amp;q=Oregon+v.+Ashcroft&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Oregon v. Ashcroft''], 368 F.3d 1118 (9th Cir. 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  The circuit panel majority invoked a [[clear statement rule]] regarding [[federalism in the United States]] to reject the Attorney General Ashcroft's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;''Recent Case'', 118 Harv. L. Rev. 1371 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lii&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supct/cert/04-623 |title=LII Supreme Court Bulletin: Gonzales v. Oregon (formerly Oregon v.

The federal government's petition for a writ for [[certiorari]] was granted and one hour of oral arguments were heard on October 5, 2005, with [[Paul Clement]], the [[Solicitor General of the United States]], personally appearing.&lt;ref name=oyez&gt;{{cite web|title=Gonzales v. Oregon|url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/2005/04-623|website=[[Oyez Project]]|accessdate=3 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Opinion of the Court==
On January 17, 2006, the Court delivered judgment in favor of Oregon, affirming the lower court by a vote of 6-3.&lt;ref name=oyez/&gt;  Justice [[Anthony Kennedy]], joined by Justices [[John Paul Stevens]], [[Sandra Day O'Connor]], [[David Souter]], [[Ruth Bader Ginsburg]], and [[Stephen Breyer]] determined that the [[Controlled Substances Act]] (CSA) did not give the Attorney General the power to interfere with physicians obeying the state law.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;  The Court did not dispute the power of the federal government to regulate drugs, but it disagreed that the statute in place empowered the attorney general to overrule state laws on the appropriate use of medications allowed.&lt;ref name=stefan&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stefan |first1=Susan | last2= |first2= |date=2016 |title=Rational Suicide, Irrational Laws |url= |location=[[New York, New York]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |pages=124-126 |isbn=978-0-19-998119-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Court first determined it did not need to grant substantial deference to the Justice Department's interpretation of its own regulation under ''[[Auer v. Robbins]]'' (1997) because the regulation merely restated the terms of the CSA.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;  Likewise, the Court found that, although the phrase "legitimate medical purpose" in the statute is ambiguous, the Attorney General’s interpretation was not entitled to [[Chevron deference]] because the CSA delegated medical judgments to the expertise of the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]], not to the Attorney General.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;  Finally, the Court found the Attorney General's conclusions regarding the phrase unpersuasive under ''[[Skidmore v. Swift &amp; Co.]]'' (1944) because Congress would have been more explicit if it had intended to empower the Attorney General to unilaterally create new crimes through regulation.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;

==Dissents==
===Justice Scalia===
Justice [[Antonin Scalia]], joined by Chief Justice [[John Roberts]] and Justice [[Clarence Thomas]], respectfully dissented.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt; Justice Scalia believed that agency deference should be given to the Attorney General under both ''Auer'' and ''Chevron''.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt;  Even without granting any agency deference, the Attorney General's interpretation was reasonable because, Scalia argued: "If the term 'legitimate medical purpose' has any meaning, it surely excludes the prescription of drugs to produce death."&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/546/243/dissent.html 546 U.S. 243 (2006) (Scalia, J., dissenting)].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Justice Thomas===
Justice Thomas also filed a brief dissent, alone.  Thomas made clear that, although he still believes the CSA is not empowered by the Constitution's Interstate [[Commerce Clause]] to regulate purely intrastate conduct, if it were the Attorney General's interpretation of the statute would be reasonable.&lt;ref name=harv/&gt; Thomas argued that the opinion of the Court was inconsistent with the reasoning in ''[[Gonzales v. Raich]]'' (2005).&lt;ref name=stefan/&gt; He also dissented in that decision in which five of the six justices in the majority in ''Oregon'' found broad federal authority under the CSA for Congress to forbid the growth of medical marijuana.&lt;ref name=stefan/&gt;

He had argued for a more limited congressional power under the Commerce Clause in ''Raich'', which focused on intrastate and interstate commerce. In ''Oregon'', by contrast, the case was a matter of the validity of an executive interpretation of that statute.&lt;ref&gt;[https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/546/243/dissent2.html 546 U.S. 243 (2006) (Thomas, J., dissenting)].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notes==
# {{note|case_name}}The case was initially filed as ''Oregon v. Ashcroft'', with Ashcroft as a nominal defendant by virtue of his status as heading the [[US Department of Justice]]. [[Alberto Gonzales]] later replaced Ashcroft, which changed the name of the case.
# {{note|statistic}}Oregon's Death with Dignity statistics are available [http://public.health.oregon.gov/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/index.aspx here].
# {{note|retirement}}[[Sandra Day O'Connor|Justice O'Connor]] was in the majority although she had announced her retirement on July 1, 2005, pending confirmation of a successor. She remained on the Court when oral argument was heard and when the case was considered, but her vote would not have counted if her successor was seated before the Court formally announced its decision. [[Samuel Alito]] was still pending confirmation by the Senate to replace O'Connor when the ruling was handed down.

This article deals with the activities of the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], an agency of the [[Federal government of the United States]], that violate [[human rights]].

==General principles==
In 2003, Patricia Derian, who served as Assistant Secretary of State for Human Rights in the [[Presidency of Jimmy Carter|Carter Administration]] wrote, "Through these U.S. military and intelligence agencies the United States government is sending a dangerous and double message. If this continues, it will subvert our entire human rights policy."&lt;ref name="NSAEBB85"&gt;{{Citation | publisher = George Washington University National Security Archive

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In understanding the CIA's role in human rights, there are challenging problems of ethics. [[John R. Stockwell]], a CIA officer who left the Agency and became a public critic, said of the CIA field officers: "They do not meet the death squads on the streets where they are actually chopping up people or laying them down on the street and running trucks over their heads. The CIA people in San Salvador meet the police chiefs, and the people who run the death squads, and they do liaise with them, they meet them beside the swimming pool of the villas. And it is a sophisticated, civilized kind of relationship. And they talk about their children, who are going to school at UCLA or Harvard and other schools, and they do not talk about the horrors of what is being done. They pretend like it is not true."&lt;ref name="Stockwell"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Florencio Caballero, a former Honduran Army interrogator, said that he had been trained by the Central Intelligence Agency, which the ''New York Times'' confirmed with US and Honduran officials. Much of his account was confirmed by three American and two Honduran officials, and may be the fullest given of how army and police units were authorized to organize death squads that seized, interrogated and killed suspected leftists. He said that while Argentine and Chilean trainers taught the Honduran Army kidnapping and elimination techniques, the CIA explicitly forbade the use of physical torture or assassination.&lt;ref name="Lemoyne1987-05-02"&gt;{{citation

 | journal=The New York Times
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Caballero described the CIA role as ambiguous. "Caballero said his superior officers ordered him and other members of army intelligence units to conceal their participation in death squads from CIA advisers. He added that he was sent to Houston for six months in 1979 to be trained by CIA instructors in interrogation techniques. "They prepared me in interrogation to end the use of physical torture in Honduras - they taught psychological methods", Mr. Caballero said of his American training. "So when we had someone important, we hid him from the Americans, interrogated him ourselves and then gave him to a death squad to kill."

===Torture techniques===

There are balancing assertions that CIA personnel attempted to minimize abuses by foreign governments who practiced torture before any involvement with CIA.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}} There is evidence that CIA has funded academic research, unwitting in some cases, which was then used to develop harsh interrogation techniques.&lt;ref&gt;

====Enhanced interrogation techniques====
{{Further|Senate Intelligence Committee report on CIA torture}}

From 2002-2007, as part of the [[War on Terror]], CIA personnel employed so-called "[[Enhanced interrogation techniques]]", a variety of coercive and abusive interrogation techniques that are widely judged to constitute torture.&lt;ref name=McCoy&gt;{{Cite book

Bush administration]] have argued that "harsh" techniques such as [[waterboarding]] are not torture, or the end objectives of the [[War on Terrorism|War against Terror]] justify those means. There has been considerable domestic and international protest against these practices. The [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|
United Nations' Special Rapporteur on Torture]], [[Human Rights Watch]], and American legal scholars have called for the prosecution of Bush administration officials who ordered torture, conspired to provide legal cover for torture, and CIA and DoD personnel and contract workers who carried it out.&lt;ref name="CallsforProsection"&gt;Calls for Prosecution

Torture and harsh imprisonment accusations (as well as documented examples)  were not limited to the recent War on Terror. [[Yuri Nosenko]], a [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[KGB]] defector, was held in stark conditions of solitary confinement in a clandestine CIA facility in the continental US from 1966 to 1969.&lt;ref name="Bagley"&gt;{{citation

=====Waterboarding=====
{{Main|Waterboarding}}
Waterboarding is a method that gives the subject the sensation of drowning, and may cause permanent damage to the lungs and other parts of the body. Some individuals being waterboarded, who may have had preexisting cardiac or respiratory disease, died under the method.

For example, the CIA used [[waterboarding]], and other interrogation techniques against three suspected Al Quaeda members, [[Khalid Sheikh Mohammed]], [[Abu Zubaydah]] and [[Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=CIA admit 'waterboarding' al-Qaida suspects |publisher=The Guardian newspaper (UK) |accessdate=2008-02-29 |date=2008-02-08 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2008/feb/05/india.terrorism | location=London | first=Mark | last=Tran}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |url=http://abcnews.go.com/WNT/Investigation/story?id=1322866 |title=CIA's Harsh Interrogation Techniques Described |publisher=ABC news (USA) |date=18 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Finding of War Crimes culpability=====
In 2007, [[Red Cross]] investigators concluded in a secret report that the Central Intelligence Agency's interrogation methods for high-level al Qaeda prisoners constituted torture which could make the Bush administration officials who approved them guilty of war crimes, according to the book ""Dark Side: The Inside Story of How the War on Terror Turned Into a War on American Ideals,"" by [[Jane Mayer]] a journalist for ''The New Yorker''.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com" /&gt;

According to the book, the report of the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] found that the methods used on Abu Zubaydah, the first major al Qaeda figure captured by the United States, were "categorically" torture, which is illegal under both United States law and international conventions to which the U.S. is a party. A copy of the report was given to the CIA in 2007. For example, the book states that Abu Zubaydah was confined in a box "so small he said he had to double up his limbs in the fetal position" and was one of several prisoners to be "slammed against the walls," according to the Red Cross report.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;''New York Times'', 11 July 2008, "Book Cites Secret Red Cross Report of C.I.A. Torture of Qaeda Captives" https://www.nytimes.com/2008/07/11/washington/11detain.html&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA has admitted that Abu Zubaydah and two other prisoners were waterboarded, a practice in which water is poured on the nose and mouth to create the sensation of suffocation and drowning.

====Training in torture====
{{further|U.S. Army and CIA interrogation manuals}}
On 24 January 1997, two CIA manuals were declassified in response to a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] (FOIA) request filed by the ''[[Baltimore Sun]]'' in 1994. The first manual, "[[KUBARK Counterintelligence Interrogation]]", dated July 1963, is the source of much of the material in the second manual. The second manual, "[[Human Resource Exploitation Training Manual - 1983]]", was used in at least seven U.S. training courses conducted in Latin American countries, including [[Honduras]], between 1982 and 1987. Both manuals deal exclusively with interrogation and have an entire chapter devoted to "coercive techniques."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; These manuals recommend arresting suspects early in the morning by surprise, blindfolding them, and stripping them naked. Interrogation rooms should be windowless, soundproof, dark and without toilets. Suspects should be held incommunicado and should be deprived of any kind of normal routine in eating and sleeping. The manuals describe coercive techniques to be used "to induce psychological regression in the subject by bringing a superior outside force to bear on his will to resist."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

While the US manuals contained coercive measures, they did not rise to the level of what is generally defined as torture. Torture, however, has been culturally a part of authoritarian South American governments, especially in 1973-1983 ([[Dirty War]]). Argentina had learned such methods from the French in [[Operation Charly]] and its secret services trained the personnel of other South American countries. It is not clear to what extent field personnel and leadership of agencies of the Federal government of the United States (notably the CIA, Defense and State Departments, AID) were aware of this, condoned it, or actively assisted it.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}}

In 2007, the chief Argentinian interrogator, Ernesto Guillermo Barreiro, was arrested in the United States.&lt;ref name="NYT2007-04-05"&gt;{{Citation
 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/05/world/americas/05latin.html?ex=1333425600&amp;en=f4a69382d6fbf39e&amp;ei=5090&amp;partner=rssuserland&amp;emc=rss

}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not clear whether he will be deported, held, or extradited. The other two arrested were Peruvians, Telmo Ricardo Hurtado and Juan Manuel Rivera Rondon, accused of having participated in the massacre of 69 peasants in an Andean village in 1985, when President [[Alan García]] was trying to suppress the [[Maoist]] [[Shining Path]] guerrilla movement. Garcia was the President of Peru again from 2006 to 2011.

CIA involvement ranged from no knowledge, to knowledge but no participation, to knowledge with the suggestion that less brutal techniques were appropriate, to participation or observation.{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

===Rendition and disappearance===
[[Extraordinary rendition]] is the process of clandestinely moving a prisoner from where he was captured, to an interrogation center in a country not subject to US law regarding extreme methods of interrogation. Some reports indicate CIA personnel operated the prison and performed the interrogations, while others state that while the CIA delivered the prisoner, third-country intelligence personnel did the actual interrogation. The Wikipedia [[:Category:Black sites]] details the list of known or suspected [[Black Site|black sites]] where CIA prisoners may be detained. Known or suspected aircraft used to transport prisoners are in [[Rendition aircraft]].

A claim that the black sites existed was made by ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in November 2005 and before by [[human rights]] [[NGO]]s.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com" /&gt; [[President of the United States|US President]] [[George W. Bush]] acknowledged the existence of secret prisons operated by the CIA during a speech on 6 September 2006.&lt;ref name="cnn.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="news.bbc.co.uk" /&gt;

====2007 status of ghost detainees====
{{main|Ghost detainee}}
A 50-page  [[Human Rights Watch]] report, "Ghost Prisoner: Two Years in Secret CIA Detention," contains a detailed description of a secret CIA prison from a Palestinian former detainee who was released from custody the previous year. Human Rights Watch has also sent a public letter to U.S. President George W. Bush requesting information about the fate and whereabouts of the missing detainees.&lt;ref name="HRWghost"&gt;{{citation

"President Bush told us that the last 14 CIA prisoners were sent to Guantanamo, but there are many other prisoners 'disappeared' by the CIA whose fate is still unknown," said Joanne Mariner, terrorism and counterterrorism director at Human Rights Watch.

In early September 2006, 14 detainees were transferred from secret CIA prisons to military custody at Guantanamo Bay. In a televised speech on 6 September 2006, President Bush announced that with those 14 transfers, no prisoners were left in CIA custody.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1968 the United States was spending $60 million a year to train police in 34 countries in areas such as criminal investigation, patrolling, interrogation and counterinsurgency techniques, riot control, weapon use, and bomb disposal&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05" /&gt; The United States also provided weapons, telecommunications, transportation, and other equipment. In the early 1970s, the Congress became concerned over the apparent absence of clear policy guidelines and the use of program funds to support repressive regimes that committed human rights' abuses. As a result, "the [[United States Congress|Congress]] determined that it was inadvisable for the United States to continue supporting any foreign police organizations".&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05" /&gt; Both the CIA and military intelligence with  [[Counter-intelligence#Counterintelligence force protection source operations|Counterintelligence Force Protection Source Operations]]&lt;ref name="Gleghorn"&gt;{{citation

The [[Bureau of Diplomatic Security]], under the [[Department of State]] representatives at any embassy is expected to be aware of all contacts between US personnel and local law enforcement organizations.  The 1973 legislation significantly limited police training of all sorts, partially in response to human rights concerns.

The majority of this training went to Latin America, but some did go to countries elsewhere in the world, according to Senator [[Alan Cranston]],&lt;ref name="Cranston1992"&gt;{{citation
 | journal = [[Congressional Record]]
 | title= U.S. Security
 | date=5 March 1992
 | page= S2874 [Senate]
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; especially those with narcotics or terrorism problems. Cranston cited six reasons why the Congress, in 1974, banned police training, after learning of training and equipping "police in [[Iran]], [[Vietnam]], [[Brazil]], and other countries were involved in torture, murder, and the suppression of legitimate political activity":

{{quote|First, training was provided to so-called friendly anti-Communist regimes, without regard to whether they were dictatorships or not.

Second, law enforcement efforts were subordinated to U.S. counterinsurgency goals. As the GAO noted, U.S. training included such topics as counterinsurgency techniques, weapons use, and Communist ideology. This also meant, in practice, reinforcing the control of recipient countries' militaries over the police.

Third, and this is clearly borne out in the [[A. J. Langguth|Langguth]] book,&lt;ref name="Langguth"&gt;{{Citation
 | title = [[Hidden Terrors: The Truth About U.S. Police Operations in Latin America]]

}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. trainers were not always the best America had to offer.

Fourth, U.S. intelligence agencies were given an important role in the development and execution of these programs.

Fifth, police training was not placed in the broader context of administration of justice, with its emphasis on judicial and prison reform.

And, finally, human rights was rarely a factor in policy considerations at the time.}}

Cranston went on to say,

{{quote|This ban remained virtually ironclad until 1985, when Congress authorized the President to support `programs to enhance investigative capabilities conducted under judicial or prosecutorial control' in functioning democracies in the Western hemisphere.

As a result, the Department of Justice--together with the State Department and the Agency for International Development--established the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program [[ICITAP]]. Operational responsibility was left entirely to ICITAP under the supervision of officials in the Deputy Attorney General's office, with policy guidance provided by the Department of State.}}

In principle, training and assistance to police, as opposed to military organization, is against US law, but the relevant law allows Presidential waiver of most provisions. A GAO report&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05"&gt;{{citation
 | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters

&lt;blockquote&gt;... provides information on (1) the legislative authority for providing assistance to foreign law enforcement agencies and personnel, (2) the extent and cost of U.S. activities, and (3) experts' opinions on the management of these programs.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===General Accounting Office investigation===

In 1973 and 1974, the Congress enacted legislation forbidding U.S. agencies from using foreign economic or military assistance funds to assist foreign police, but it subsequently granted numerous exemptions to permit assistance in some countries and in various aspects of police force development, including material and weapons support, force management, narcotics control, and [[counterterrorism]] tactics. The 1974 prohibition did not apply to the use of other funds by agencies such as the [[United States Department of Justice]] (DOJ) or [[United States Department of Transportation]] (DOT) to train or assist foreign law enforcement personnel.

No government agency is in charge of calculating the cost. However, the General Accounting Office identified 125 countries that received U.S. training and assistance for their police forces during fiscal year 1990 at a cost of at least $117 million.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Results"&gt;{{citation

The prohibition did not apply to Drug Enforcement Administration [[DEA]] and Federal Bureau of Investigation [[FBI]] assistance to combat international narcotics trafficking.

During fiscal year 1990 at a cost of about $117 million, the GAO estimated the major programs were: U.S. programs providing :
*[[United States Department of State]](DOS)International Narcotics Control($45 million) Antiterrorism Assistance ($10 million)
*[[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] ICITAP ($20 million)
**[[United States Department of Defense]]'s (DOD) national police forces assistance ($42 million).&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05App2AT"&gt;{{citation

Current and former State Department and other government officials, and academic experts who have been involved in assistance to foreign police forces, stated that the U.S. government lacks:&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Concerns"&gt;{{citation

a clear policy, or program objectives, on the role of U.S. assistance to police forces in the new and emerging democracies, a focal point for coordination and decision-making, and a means for determining whether individual programs and activities support U.S. policy or contribute to overall U.S. interests.

They noted that each program is managed individually, and the only place that coordination is occurring is at the U.S. embassy in the country.

====Scope and methodology on investigation on CIA training assistance====

The US [[General Accounting Office]] obtained information on CIA training and assistance provided to foreign law enforcement personnel, reviewed the legislative authority for providing this training and assistance, and identified efforts to coordinate these activities. They did not review program implementation in recipient countries. They interviewed officials and obtained records from AID and the Departments of State, Justice, and Defense, in Washington, D.C.; reviewed legislation and agency legal opinions on foreign police assistance; interviewed academic and legal experts on current U.S. assistance to foreign police; and reviewed literature published on foreign police assistance and AID's public safety program.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Scope"&gt;{{citation

===Legislative exemptions to the prohibition on U.S. assistance to foreign police===
Congressionally approved exemptions generally authorize activities that benefit a specific U.S. goal, such as countering the terrorist threat to U.S. citizens overseas or combating drug trafficking.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05AppI"&gt;{{citation
 | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters

Exemptions were also extended by:
*The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981 - for [[Haiti]]&lt;ref name="ISDC-1989"&gt;The International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1981 (U.S. Congress): P.L. 97-113, sec. 721(d), 95 stat. 1519&lt;/ref&gt;
*International Security and Development Assistance Authorizations Act of 1983 - antiterrorism program to allow training in relation to aviation security, crisis management, document screening techniques, facility security, maritime security, protection for [[VIP]]s, and handling of detector dogs.&lt;ref&gt;International Security and Development Assistance Authorizations Act of 1983&lt;/ref&gt;
*International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985 - El Salvador &amp; [[Honduras]]&lt;ref name="ISD1985"&gt;International Security and Development Cooperation Act of 1985&lt;/ref&gt;
It also expanded the judicial reform program and the police training exemption to countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. In 1988 the Congress further expanded the judicial reform program to allow police assistance to promote investigative and forensic skills, develop law enforcement training curricula, and improve administration and management of law enforcement organizations. This act specifically prohibited the Department of Defense (DOD) and the U.S. armed forces from providing training under this program.&lt;ref name="ISD1985" /&gt;

Maritime subjects were exempted from the section 660 prohibition, as well as the prohibition for any country that has a long-standing democratic tradition, does not have armed forces, and does not engage in a consistent pattern of gross violations of human rights. The act permitted such countries to receive any type of police assistance.

*International Narcotics Control Acts
This series of acts approved certain police assistance activities in [[Latin America]] and the Caribbean for narcotics control purposes. The 1988 act expanded DOD's role and allowed it to provide training and weapons and ammunition in fiscal years 1989 and 1990 to foreign police units that are specifically organized for narcotics enforcement in eligible countries in Latin America and the Caribbean. This act also allowed economic support funds to be provided to Colombian police for the protection of judges, government officials, and members of the press against narco-terrorist attacks. The 1989 Act extended DOD's authority to train police units in [[Bolivia]], [[Colombia]], and [[Peru]] in fiscal year 1990, if the units are only for narcotics enforcement.  It also allowed DOD to provide, in addition to weapons and ammunition, other defense articles such as helicopters, vehicles, radios, and personnel gear.
The 1990 act authorized DOD to continue to train and equip police forces in the [[Andes|Andean region]].&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05IntNarc"/&gt;
*Urgent Assistance for Democracy in Panama Act of 1990 - after the U.S. invasion of [[Panama]], the Congress significantly enhanced the U.S. role in the development of the new police force in Panama. T.&lt;ref&gt;Urgent Assistance for Democracy in Panama Act of 1990&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for 1991 - Eastern Caribbean exemption&lt;ref&gt;The Foreign Operations, Export Financing, and Related Programs Appropriations Act for 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

====Other exceptions to police assistance prohibition====

In addition to the exemptions previously discussed, there are other authorities that waive the prohibition on assistance to police forces of foreign countries. For example, the President may authorize foreign assistance when `it is important to the security interests of the United States'. This allows the President to waive any provision of the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, including section 660.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, 22 USC 2364&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. assistance provided to foreign police===

====Antiterrorism assistance====

This aims to improve foreign governments' antiterrorist capabilities to better protect U.S. citizens and interests.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05App2AT" /&gt; In 1990, the U.S. provided assistance to 49 countries at a cost of nearly $10 million. Sixty-two percent of the funds were spent in Latin America, the Caribbean, and Europe, and less than $500,000 was used to purchase equipment. The Department of State manages the program and contracts with other U.S. government agencies, state or local police departments, and private firms to conduct the training. The [[Federal Aviation Administration]],&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05App2AT" /&gt; U.S. [[Customs Service]], the [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]], the [[Federal Law Enforcement Training Center]], and the [[U.S. Marshals Service]] are regular trainers. In compliance with legislative requirements, most training takes place in the United States.

====International narcotics control====

One of the objectives of the Department of State Bureau of International Narcotics Matters (INM) international narcotics control training program is to strengthen host country enforcement and interdiction capabilities.{{Citation needed|date=January 2008}} During fiscal year 1990, INM provided a minimum of $45 million in training and equipment to foreign police, principally in [[Mexico]], [[Jamaica]], [[Colombia]], [[Ecuador]], [[Peru]], [[Bolivia]], [[Brazil]], [[Venezuela]], [[Pakistan]], [[Thailand]], and [[Turkey]]. These are all narcotics producing and trafficking countries.

INM reimburses other U.S. government agencies, primarily the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), Customs, and Coast Guard, to conduct the actual training. DEA provides narcotics investigative training, Customs teaches air, sea and land port search procedures, and [[Coast Guard]] teaches courses in maritime interdiction. Other agencies may also be requested to train on a reimbursable basis in areas where they have specific expertise. For example, DOD provides helicopter training to police in drug trafficking countries. Training is conducted both overseas and in the United States and is reviewed and approved by INM.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05IntNarc"&gt;{{citation

 | chapter = Appendix II. U.S. Assistance Provided to Foreign Police: INTERNATIONAL NARCOTICS CONTROL
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, DOD used military assistance funds to train and equip narcotics enforcement police in several drug producing and trafficking countries. Documents provided by DOD show that in fiscal year 1990, DOD provided training and equipment with a value of at least $17 million to Mexico, $1.3 million to Bolivia, $10 million to Colombia, $1 million to Ecuador, and $1 million to Peru. DOD officials informed us that training and equipment valued at more than these amounts may also have been provided. However, documentation was not available at the Washington, D.C., agency headquarters level that specified the amounts for law enforcement activities. The equipment provided consisted of UH-1 helicopters and spare parts, ammunition, small arms, riot control equipment, radios, and miscellaneous personal gear.

====Investigative and international police training====
In FY1986,  AID transferred funds to DOJ to design, develop, and implement projects to improve and enhance the investigative capabilities of law enforcement agencies in the Latin America and the Caribbean region. This was part of AID's effort to reform judicial systems. Using these funds, DOJ established the International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP).&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train"&gt;{{citation
 | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters
 | author = U.S. General Accounting Office, National Security and International Affairs Division
 | date=5 March 1992
 | chapter =INVESTIGATIVE AND INTERNATIONAL POLICE TRAINING
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Operating under State Department oversight, ICITAP has conducted criminal justice sector needs assessments in the region and has expanded its training to include basic police management and police academy development. In fiscal year 1990, ICITAP received $7 million from the Department of State for its regional program. It trained more than 1,000 students from the Caribbean, Central and South America and sponsored 7 conferences. Training includes police management, criminal investigation, crime scene search, and forensic medicine courses. Except for students sent to training programs in the United States, ICITAP training takes place overseas.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) also provides limited training for foreign law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train" /&gt; Each year approximately 100 international police officials attend the 11-week college level course at the FBI National Academy that includes studies on management and forensic sciences. The FBI pays for the training and subsistence, but does not pay for the students' transportation. Over the last 10 years, more than 1,100 foreign police officials from 89 countries have graduated from this course.

Using its own funds, the FBI created two training courses:
*Training for Mexican police to better assist the United States in its investigations. Mexican officers receive a 3-day course in basic law enforcement techniques to include crime scene management, collection and preservation of evidence, hostage negotiations, forensic science, and investigative techniques. Since 1987, over 400 Mexican border police have been trained. FBI officials stated that the FBI plans to establish a training school in Mexico during 1992 at an estimated cost of about $250,000 annually, excluding salaries.
*The second course developed by the FBI for foreign police was to provide mid-level management training for police officials from the Pacific Island nations. The 4-week course includes first-line supervision, investigative techniques, and hostage negotiations. During 1991, 52 students graduated from the course held in [[Guam]] at a cost to the FBI of about $35,000. About 50 students are expected to attend this course during the spring of 1992.

The FBI also provides other training and assistance to foreign police as requested, but the cost is unknown.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train" /&gt; For example, the [[National Center for the Analysis of Violent Crime]] provided training to [[Canada|Canadian]] police. The Criminal Investigative Division conducted a training seminar for officers from Italy's three national law enforcement agencies on the use of sensitive investigative techniques such as the operation of confidential sources, undercover operations, and electronic surveillance. The FBI also furnishes on-the-job assistance to governments who request help during particularly difficult or sensitive investigations.

====Counterterrorism and military assistance====
DOD supplies a limited amount of military training and assistance to police officials. During fiscal years 1986 and 1987, DOD trained and equipped the El Salvadoran and Honduran police to counter urban terrorist activities.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05Train" /&gt;&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05CTMA"&gt;{{citation

 | date=5 March 1992
 | chapter =COUNTERTERRORISM AND MILITARY ASSISTANCE
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This assistance was authorized in response to the murder of U.S. Marines by terrorists in El Salvador and was managed and delivered by the U.S. Army Military Police. The assistance consisted of training in counterterrorism techniques and the supply of police vehicles, communications, weapons, and other equipment. This effort cost $19.8 million, of which $17 million was provided to El Salvador.

In fiscal year 1990, DOD spent $6.4 million in previously authorized but unused military assistance funds to purchase needed equipment and weapons for Panama's newly formed national police force. Items procured included police vehicles, communications equipment, small arms, and personal gear. This assistance was a one-time, emergency program.

DOD has an ongoing military assistance program to support Costa Rican police. In fiscal year 1990, DOD supplied $431,000 in military equipment and $232,000 in military training to the Costa Rican Civil Guard to help them carry out their responsibility to protect the border regions of the country. DOD provided equipment such as vehicles, personnel gear, and radios, and military training in areas such as coastal operations. Additionally, DOD conducted technical training courses in equipment maintenance and medical skills among others.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05CTMA" /&gt;

DOD, along with the United Kingdom, supports the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System&lt;ref name="CIP"&gt;{{citation 
 | url = http://ciponline.org/facts/ecr03.htm
 | author = Center for International Policy
 | title = Eastern Caribbean Overview
}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{failed verification|date=July 2015}} that was formed after the U.S. intervention in [[Grenada]]. The Security System is composed of a few permanently assigned military officers, but largely depends upon island nation police officers who can be called up for military duty in case of emergency. The United States equips and trains these personnel to prepare them for such an eventually. In fiscal year 1990, DOD provided $4.2 million in military assistance funds that were used to purchase equipment such as jeeps, small arms, uniforms, and communications gear. DOD also provided $300,000 for training in special operations, rural patrol, field survival, and surveillance, as well as technical courses in communications, navigation, maintenance, and medicine.

====Difficulties in determining cost and extent of assistance====
Since some agencies fund assistance out of their own budgets, without necessarily having a line item for police assistance, the GAO "could not accurately determine the extent or cost of assistance to foreign police" In the GAO estimates, "some double counting of students may be occurring and agencies may not be differentiating between assistance provided to police and assistance provided to the military." This might happen when "the agency supplying the training and the agency paying for the training may both include the trainees in their reporting systems, such as when ICITAP pays for students attending the FBI academy."

While the DOJ was asked to calculate information on its work with foreign police, it could not assign a dollar value to items including "travel expenses, salaries, and expendable items such as course materials." H.&lt;ref name="GAO1992-03-05PolAsst"&gt;{{citation
 | title = Foreign Aid: Police Training and Assistance; report to Congressional requesters

 | chapter = Appendix II. U.S. Assistance Provided to Foreign Police: DIFFICULTIES IN DETERMINING COST AND EXTENT OF ASSISTANCE
 | url = https://fas.org/irp/gao/920300-train.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
"Also, GAO could not always determine whether a student was a police officer or a military member because some agencies do not collect such data, DOD officials informed us that once they receive permission to train police in a specific activity they do not provide a further accounting breakdown. For example, training provided to the Eastern Caribbean Regional Security System was for law enforcement personnel, although a few trainees may have belonged to military organizations."

==Human experimentation==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2014}}
Project [[MKULTRA]], or [[MK-ULTRA]], was the code name for a CIA mind-control research program that began in 1950, involved primarily with the experimentation of drugs and other "chemical, biological and radiological" stimuli on both willing and uninformed subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=471+U.S.+159&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2,33&amp;case=16297847318525168348&amp;scilh=0 CIA v. Sims], 471 U.S. 159, 161-162 (1985)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rockefeller Commission===
In December 1974, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that the CIA had conducted illegal domestic activities, including experiments on U.S. citizens, during the 1960s. The report prompted investigations by both the U.S. Congress (in the form of the [[Church Committee]]) and a presidential commission (known as the [[United States President's Commission on CIA activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]]). The congressional investigations and the Rockefeller Commission report revealed that the CIA and the Department of Defense had in fact conducted experiments to influence and control human behavior through the use of psychoactive drugs such as LSD and mescaline and other chemical, biological, and psychological means. Experiments were often conducted without the subjects' knowledge or consent.

MK-ULTRA was started on the order of CIA director Allen Dulles, largely in response to alleged Soviet, Chinese, and North Korean use of mind-control techniques on U.S. prisoners of war in Korea. The goal of the experiments was to study mind-control in order to develop methods of interrogation and behavior modification and manipulation, as well as to develop a possible [[truth drug]].

===Outcome===
[[MK-ULTRA]] research ultimately proved useless to the CIA and they have abandoned the program. Because most MK-ULTRA records were deliberately destroyed in 1973 by order of then CIA Director Richard Helms, it is difficult if not impossible to have a complete understanding of the more than 150 individually funded research sub-projects sponsored by MK-ULTRA and related CIA programs.

Following the recommendations of the [[Church Committee]], President Gerald Ford in 1976 issued the first Executive Order on Intelligence Activities which, among other things, prohibited "experimentation with drugs on human subjects, except with the informed consent, in writing and witnessed by a disinterested party, of each such human subject" and in accordance with the guidelines issued by the National Commission. Subsequent orders by Presidents Carter and Reagan expanded the directive to apply to any human experimentation.

==Assassination and targeted killing==
{{Main|Targeted killing}}
:''See [[United States involvement in regime change]]

===Targeted Killing===
At least since World War II, a distinction has been drawn between assassination of civilian leaders, and [[targeted killing]]s of leaders of fighting organizations. Some cases were blurry, such as the British-Czech [[Operation Anthropoid]], the killing of uniformed SS officer [[Reinhard Heydrich]], the acting [[Reichsprotektor]] of [[Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia|The Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia]]. A failed attempt, by British troops, to kill [[Field Marshal]] [[Erwin Rommel]] was clearly aimed at a military leader, as was the successful shooting down of [[Admiral]] [[Death of Isoroku Yamamoto|Isoroku Yamamoto]].

CIA has admitted being involved in assassination attempts against foreign leaders. Recently, there have been targeted killings of suspected terrorists, typically with missiles fired from [[unmanned aerial vehicles]], in a manner that a number of legal authorities believe was a legitimate act as opposed to a prohibited assassination.

===Assassinations===
Of the cases cited, it appears that no CIA personnel or even directly controlled foreign agents personally killed any leader, but there certainly were cases where the CIA knew of, or supported, plots to overthrow foreign leaders. In the cases of Lumumba in 1960/61 and Castro in the 50s and 60s, the CIA was involved in preparing to kill the individual. In other cases, such as Diem, the Agency knew of a plot but did not warn him, and communications at White House level indicated that the Agency had, with approval, told the plotters the US didn't object to their plan. The gun or poison, however, was not in the hands of a CIA officer.

CIA personnel were involved in attempted assassinations of foreign government leaders such as [[Fidel Castro]].  They provided support to those that killed [[Patrice Lumumba]]. In yet another category was noninterference in the Republic of Vietnam (South Vietnam) coup in which President [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] was killed.

A distinction has been drawn between political assassinations and [[CIA transnational anti-terrorism activities#Targeted killing in war versus assassination|"targeted killing" of leaders of non-state belligerents]].{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

====Castro====
{{Original research section|date=June 2015}}
{{main|Assassination attempts on Fidel Castro}}
Perhaps the best-documented account of CIA-sponsored assassination plans were against [[President]] [[Fidel Castro]] of [[Cuba]].

According to columnist Jack Anderson,&lt;ref name="Anderson1971-06-18"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first attempt was part of the [[Bay of Pigs Invasion]] operation, but five more teams were sent, the last apprehended on a rooftop within rifle range of Castro, at the end of February or beginning of March 1963. Anderson speculated that President [[Fidel Castro]] may have become aware of it, and somehow recruited [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] to retaliate against President [[John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/cuba/9151787/Fidel-Castro-knew-Lee-Harvey-Oswald-would-assassinate-John-F-Kennedy.html|title=Fidel Castro 'knew Lee Harvey Oswald would assassinate John F Kennedy'|last=Allen|first=Nick|date=2012-03-19|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maheu was identified as the team leader, who recruited [[John Roselli]], a gambler with contacts in the American and Cuban underworlds. The CIA assigned two operations officers, [[William King Harvey]] and James O'Connell, to accompany Roselli to Miami to recruit the actual teams.

Anderson's story appears to be confirmed by two CIA documents, the first referring to an Inspector General report of investigation of allegations that the Agency conspired to assassinate Fidel Castro. The story first appeared in Drew Pearson's column and has since appeared in Jack Anderson's column. "While the columns contained many factual errors, the allegations are basically true.&lt;ref name="NSAEBB222-1973-05-08"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the CIA was aware "Roselli intended to expose his participation in the plot should we not intervene in his behalf. The DCI at the time, [[John McCone]],  decided to take a calculated risk and accept the consequences of possible disclosure. Two articles by [[Jack Anderson (columnist)|Jack Anderson]] discuss the plot, as well the ''Washington Post'' Sunday magazine, ''Parade''

Individuals who were aware of this project were: [[Director of Central Intelligence]] [[Allen Dulles]], [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]] (Deputy Director for Plans (DDP)) Colonel [[J.C. King]] (Chief, Western Hemisphere Division, DDP), Colonel [[Sheffield Edwards]], [[William Harvey]], and [[James P. O'Connell]]. Also included were [[Robert Maheu|Robert A. Maheu]] (former FBI agent, public relations agent who did work for the CIA, and later an aide to [[Howard Hughes]]), and his attorneys Edward P. Morgan and [[Edward Bennett Williams]].

On 26 February 1971, Osborne arranged with the Commissioner of the U.S. [[Immigration and Naturalization Service]] to flag any deportation. INS confirmed they did this again for 1972.

====Diem====
In summary, CIA, Embassy, and other US personnel, up to White House level, were aware of yet another coup being planned against [[President]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]]. While the US had no direct participation in the coup, the plotters were told, in a deniable way, that the US did not object to it. No documentary evidence has surfaced that the US knew that Diem and his brother were to be killed, and it is unclear that all the Vietnamese plotters knew or agreed to it. [[President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] was aware of the coup plans, but apparently had not considered the hazard to Diem.

According to the ''Pentagon Papers'', the final US loss of confidence in Diem began when his government violently suppressed a protest on Buddha's Birthday, 8 May 1963. Up to that point, the majority Buddhists had not been very politically active, even though Diem had given preference to the Catholic minority. Quickly, however, the Buddhists put a "cohesive and disciplined [political] organization" into action. By June, the situation moved from dissidence from a religious group to a "grave crisis of public confidence".&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201"&gt;{{citation

Then-Ambassador [[Frederick Nolting]] had tried to persuade Diem to moderate government action against Buddhists, but with no success. While Nolting was on leave, [[President]] [[John F. Kennedy]] appointed [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] as the new Ambassador. In June 1963, senior leaders began, for the first time, to discuss the effect of a coup to remove Diem. Nolting and the US military in Vietnam, however, argued that Diem was keeping chaos at bay. Nolting left permanently in mid-August, but the assurances from Diem died with multiple August 21 night raids on Buddhist temples in many parts of Vietnam. Two days later, a US representative was approached by generals considering a coup. On 23 August, the first contact with a U.S. representative was made by generals who had begun to plan a coup against Diem. They were told that the U.S. had determined that Diem's brother, who had led the raids on the Buddhists, could not stay in any kind of power, and that, "then, we must face the possibility that Diem himself cannot be preserved."

{{quote|A White House tape of President Kennedy and his advisers, published this week in a new book-and-CD collection and excerpted on the Web, confirms that top U.S. officials sought the 1 November 1963 coup against then-South Vietnamese leader Ngo Dinh Diem without apparently considering the physical consequences for Diem personally (he was murdered the following day). The taped meeting and related documents show that U.S. officials, including JFK, vastly overestimated their ability to control the South Vietnamese generals who ran the coup 40 years ago this week [November 2003].

The Kennedy tape from 29 October 1963 captures the highest-level White House meeting immediately prior to the coup, including the President's brother voicing doubts about the policy of support for a coup: "I mean, it's different from a coup in the Iraq or South American country; we are so intimately involved in this ...&lt;ref name="NSAEBB101"&gt;{{citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An 8 May 1973 memorandum&lt;ref name="NSAEBB222-1973-05-08" /&gt; states that "An Inspector General report of  investigation of allegations that the Agency was instrumental in bringing about the assassination of [[President]] [[Ngo Dinh Diem]] of [[South Vietnam]]. The allegations were determined to be without foundation."

Nevertheless, the Pentagon Papers observed,

&lt;blockquote&gt;For the military coup d'etat against Ngo Dinh Diem, the U.S. must accept its full share of responsibility. Beginning in August 1963 we variously authorized, sanctioned and encouraged the coup efforts of the Vietnamese generals and offered full support for a successor government. In October we cut off aid to Diem in a direct rebuff, giving a green light to the generals. We maintained clandestine contact with them throughout the planning and execution of the coup and sought to review their operational plans and proposed new government. Thus, as the nine-year rule of Diem came to a bloody end, our complicity in his overthrow heightened our responsibilities and our commitment in an essentially leaderless Vietnam.&lt;ref name="PP2-4-201" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====Lumumba====

The [[Church Committee]] concluded it had "solid evidence of a plot to assassinate [[Patrice Lumumba]] [the first elected [[Prime Minister]] of the [[Republic of Congo]]]. Strong hostility to Lumumba, voiced at the very highest levels of government may have been intended to initiate an assassination operation; at the least it engendered such an operation. The evidence indicates that it is likely that [[President]] [[Dwight D. Eisenhower|Eisenhower]]'s expression of strong concern about Lumumba at a meeting of the National Security Council on 18 August 1960, was taken by ([[Director of Central Intelligence]]) [[Allen Dulles]] as authority to assassinate Lumumba. There is, however, testimony by Eisenhower Administration officials, and ambiguity and lack of clarity in the records of high-level policy meetings, which tends to contradict the evidence that the President intended an assassination effort against Lumumba. In a footnote, the Committee cited an unnamed official as saying he had heard Eisenhower order the assassination."

=====Approval discussions and meetings=====
The week after the August 18 NSC meeting, a presidential advisor reminded the Special Group of the "necessity for very straightforward action" against Lumumba and prompted a decision not to rule out consideration of "any particular kind of activity which might contribute to getting rid of Lumumba." The Special Group is one of the many names for the often-reorganized committee that approved CIA covert action proposals. It has been called the 303 committee, Special Group (counterinsurgency), Operations Advisory Group, 5412 committee, and Forty Committee. "The following day, Dulles cabled a CIA Station Officer in Leopoldville, Republic of the Congo,* that "in high quarters" the "removal" of Lumumba was "an urgent and prime objective."

&lt;blockquote&gt;Shortly thereafter the CIA's clandestine service formulated a plot to assassinate Lumumba. The plot proceeded to the point that lethal substances and instruments specifically intended for use in an assassination were delivered by the CIA to the Congo Station. There is no evidence that these instruments of assassination were actually used against Lumumba.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=====Events overtaken by events=====
In the meantime, Lumumba was dismissed from his post by  Congolese [[President]] [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]], an act of dubious legality; in retaliation, Lumumba attempted to dismiss Kasa-Vubu from the presidency, an act of even more dubious legality. On 14 September, a coup d'état endorsed by the CIA and organized by Colonel [[Joseph Mobutu]] removed Lumumba from office.

Lumumba was killed, in 1961, by forces under the control of the [[President]], [[Moise Tshombe]] of [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], a province that had declared its independence of the Republic of the Congo. Lumumba was taken by Katangan soldiers commanded by Belgians, and eventually shot by a Katangan firing squad under Belgian leadership.

=====Planning in the clandestine services=====

The independent [[Republic of the Congo (Léopoldville)|Republic of the Congo]] was declared on 30 June 1960, with [[Joseph Kasa-Vubu]] as President and [[Patrice Lumumba]] as Prime Minister. It shared a name with the neighboring [[Republic of the Congo]] to the west, a French colony that also gained independence in 1960, and the two were normally differentiated by also stating the name of the relevant capital city, so Congo (Léopoldville) versus Congo (Brazzaville).

[[Larry Devlin]] became [[Chief of Station]] in Congo in July 1960, a mere 10 days after the country's independence from Belgium and shortly before Prime Minister [[Patrice Lumumba]]'s two-month term in office, dismissal from power and ultimate execution. In his memoir, Devlin reveals that late in 1960, he received instructions from an agent ("Joe from Paris") who was relaying instructions from CIA headquarters that he (Devlin) was to effect the assassination of Lumumba. Various poisons, including one secreted in a tube of toothpaste, were proffered. The directive had come from the CIA Deputy Chief of Plans [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.|Dick Bissell]], but Devlin wanted to know if it had originated at a higher level and if so, how high. "Joe" had been given to understand that it had come from President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], but Devlin to this day does not know for sure. Devlin writes (and has recently said in public speaking engagements) that he felt an assassination would have been "morally wrong" and likely to backfire and work against U.S. interests. In the event, he temporized, neglecting to act, and Lumumba was ultimately murdered by his enemies in [[State of Katanga|Katanga]], with Belgian government participation. U.S. intelligence was kept apprised.

The United Nations Security Council was called into session on 7 December 1960 to consider Soviet demands that the U.N. seek Lumumba's immediate release, the immediate restoration of Lumumba as head of the Congo government, the disarming of the forces of Mobutu, and the immediate evacuation of Belgians from the Congo.  Soviet Representative [[Valerian Zorin]] refused U.S. demands that he disqualify himself as Security Council President during the debate. [[Dag Hammarskjöld]], answering Soviet attacks against his Congo operations, said that if the U.N. forces were withdrawn from the Congo "I fear everything will crumble."

Following a U.N. report that Lumumba had been mistreated by his captors, his followers threatened (on 9 December 1960) to seize all Belgians and "start cutting off the heads of some of them" unless Lumumba was released within 48 hours.

====Mahdawi====
{{Main|CIA activities in Iraq}}
According to the [[Church Committee]] report:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In February 1960, CIA's Near East Division sought the endorsement of what the Division Chief &lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;[[James H. Critchfield]]&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; called the "Health Alteration Committee" for its proposal for a "special operation" to "incapacitate" an [[Iraq]]i Colonel believed to be "promoting Soviet bloc political interests in Iraq." The Division sought the Committee's advice on a technique, "which while not likely to result in total disablement would be certain to prevent the target from pursuing his usual activities for a minimum of three months," adding: "We do not consciously seek subject's permanent removal from the scene; we also do not object should this complication develop."&amp;nbsp;... In April [1962], the [Health Alteration] Committee unanimously recommended to the DDP [Deputy Director for Plans, [[Richard M. Bissell Jr.]]] that a "disabling operation"  be undertaken, noting that the Chief of Operations advised that it would be "highly desirable." Bissell's deputy, [[Tracy Barnes]], approved on behalf of Bissell&amp;nbsp;... The approved operation was to mail a monogrammed handkerchief containing an incapacitating agent to the colonel from an Asian country. [James] Scheider [Science Advisor to Bissell] testified that, while he did not now recall the name of the recipient, he did remember mailing from the Asian country, during the period in question, a handkerchief "treated with some kind of material for the purpose of harassing that person who received it."&amp;nbsp;... During the course of this Committee's investigation, the CIA stated that the handkerchief was "in fact never received (if, indeed, sent)." It added that the colonel: "Suffered a terminal illness before a firing squad in Baghdad (an event we had nothing to do with) not very long after our handkerchief proposal was considered."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history-matters.com/archive/church/reports/ir/html/ChurchIR_0098a.htm|title=Alleged Assassination Plots involving Foreign Leaders|author=[[Church Committee|United States Senate Select Committee to Study Governmental Operations with Respect to Intelligence Activities]]|page=181|date=1975-11-20|accessdate=2016-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In addition, it is unlikely that Qasim was the intended recipient of the handkerchief, as CIA officials would likely have remembered an attack on the Iraqi head of state. While Qasim was not a colonel but a brigadier general and did not openly promote Soviet interests in Iraq, the pro-Soviet head of Iraq's "People's Court," Colonel Fahdil Abbas al-Mahdawi, fits the above description perfectly.&lt;ref name="Gibson 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For more on the "revolting tactics" of Mahdawi's "People's Court," see {{cite book|authorlink=Kanan Makiya|last=Makiya|first=Kanan|title=Republic of Fear: The Politics of Modern Iraq, Updated Edition|publisher=[[University of California Press]]|year=1998|isbn=9780520921245|pages=50–51}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qasim effectively banned the ICP in January 1960, but Mahdawi remained a crucial conduit between Qasim's government and several communist-front groups—including the "Peace Partisans," which was allowed to operate in public despite being formally outlawed in May 1961—and was known for his outspoken praise for [[Fidel Castro]] as well as his trips throughout the Soviet Union, the [[Eastern Bloc]], and [[China]].&lt;ref name="Gibson 2015"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Citino 2017"/&gt; In 1991, former high-ranking U.S. diplomat [[Hermann Eilts]] told journalist [[Elaine Sciolino]] that Mahdawi had been the target.&lt;ref name="Scliolino 1991"/&gt;

Mahdawi and some of his family members ''were'' stricken with a serious case of what Mahdawi dubbed "influenza" in 1962, but it is unknown whether this ailment was related to the CIA's plan to poison him; Nathan J.

====Trujillo====
An Inspector General report of investigation of allegations that the Agency was instrumental in bringing about the
assassination of [[Rafael Trujillo]], dictator of the [[Dominican Republic]]. Trujillo was effective head of government at the time of his assassination in 1961.

Conditions leading to a desire, by Dominicans, appeared to begin [[Johnny Abbes García|Johnny Abbes]], took control the Intelligence Military Service (the secret police), and the country developed more internal violence and increasingly isolated from other nations. This isolation compounded Trujillo's fears, prompting him to worsen his foreign interventionism.

To be sure, Trujillo did have cause to resent the leaders of some nations, such as Cuba's [[Fidel Castro Ruz|Fidel Castro]], who assisted a small, abortive invasion attempt by dissident Dominicans in 1959. Trujillo, however, expressed greater concern over Venezuela's president [[Rómulo Betancourt]] (1959–64). An established and outspoken opponent of Trujillo, Betancourt had been associated with some individual Dominicans who had plotted against the dictator. Trujillo developed an obsessive personal hatred towards Betancourt and supported numerous plots of Venezuelan exiles to overthrow him. This pattern of intervention led the Venezuelan government to take its case against Trujillo to the [[Organization of American States]] (OAS).

This development infuriated Trujillo, who ordered his foreign agents to plant a bomb inside Betancourt's car. The assassination attempt, carried out on 24 June 1960, injured but did not kill the Venezuelan president.The firestorm caused from the incident inflamed world opinion against Trujillo. The members of the OAS, expressing this outrage, voted unanimously to sever diplomatic relations and to impose strong economic sanctions on the Dominican Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://warfarehistorynetwork.com/daily/military-history/the-assassination-of-rafael-trujillo/|title=The Assassination of Rafael Trujillo|website=warfarehistorynetwork.com|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally on the night of the 30 May 1961, Rafael Trujillo was shot to death on San Cristobal Avenue, Santo Domingo.  He was the victim of an ambush plotted by a number of Dominicans. According to American reporter [[Bernard Diederich]], the United States [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) had supplied some of the guns used to kill the president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=[[Bernard Diederich]] |title=Trujillo.

In a report to the Deputy [[Attorney General of the United States]], CIA officials described the agency as having "no active part" in the assassination and only a "faint connection" with the groups that planned the killing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB222/family_jewels_wilderotter.pdf Justice Department Memo, 1975;] [[National Security Archive]]&lt;/ref&gt; but the internal CIA investigation, by its Inspector General, "disclosed quite extensive Agency involvement with the plotters."&lt;ref name="NSAEBB222-1973-05-08" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

====Sukarno====
According to an 86-page portion of the [[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States|Rockefeller Commission]] investigating the CIA's domestic activities that was removed at the behest of the [[Presidency of Gerald Ford|Ford administration]] and did not become public until 2016:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Richard] Bissell [Deputy Director of Plans for the CIA] also testified that there was discussion within the Agency of the possibility of an attempt on the life of President Achmed [[Sukarno]] of [[Indonesia]] which "progressed as far as the identification of an asset who it was felt might be recruited for this purpose. The plan was never reached, was never perfected to the point where it seemed feasible." He said the Agency had "absolutely nothing" to do with the death of Sukarno.&amp;nbsp;... He stated that no assassination plans would have been undertaken without authorization outside the Agency, and that no such authorization was undertaken for plans against either Lumumba or Sukarno.&amp;nbsp;... Since no evidence was found to bring the Sukarno and Lumumba matters within the scope of the Commission's investigative authority, no further investigation in these two areas was undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/dc.html?doc=2719480-Document-19|title=Summary of Facts: Investigation of CIA Involvement in Plans to Assassinate Foreign Leaders|work=[[United States President's Commission on CIA Activities within the United States]]|date=1975-06-05|accessdate=2017-07-14|pp=6–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Prados|first1=John|last2=Jimenez-Bacardi|first2=Arturo|url=http://nsarchive.gwu.edu/NSAEBB/NSAEBB543-Ford-White-House-Altered-Rockefeller-Commission-Report/|title=Gerald Ford White House Altered Rockefeller Commission Report in 1975; Removed Section on CIA Assassination Plots|work=[[National Security Archive]]|date=2016-02-29|accessdate=2017-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manual recommended "selective use of violence for propagandistic effects" and to "neutralize" (i.e., kill) government officials. Nicaraguan Contras were taught to lead:

{{quote|... demonstrators into clashes with the authorities, to provoke riots or shootings, which lead to the killing of one or more persons, who will be seen as the martyrs; this situation should be taken advantage of immediately against the Government to create even bigger conflicts.}}

The manual also recommended:

{{quote|... selective use of armed force for PSYOP [psychological operations] effect. ... Carefully selected, planned targets — judges, police officials, tax collectors, etc. — may be removed for PSYOP effect in a UWOA [unconventional warfare operations area], but extensive precautions must insure that the people "concur" in such an act by thorough explanatory canvassing among the affected populace before and after conduct of the mission.&lt;ref name = "TDRA"&gt;{{Citation

In Romania, the secret facility was located at Northern Bucharest. In Lithuania, the black site was a guesthouse in the capital city of Vilnius which operated as early as 2002. In December 2014, the US Senate Select Committee on Intelligence filed a report which included torture details involving Saudi Arabian nationals Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.humanrightsfirst.org/senate-report-cia-torture/abd-al-rahim-al-nashiri|title=Abd al-Rahim al-Nashiri|work=Human Rights First|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; suspected of masterminding the bombing of the US navy guided-missile destroyer USS ''Cole'' in Yemen and Abu Zubaydah,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/how-did-abu-zubaydah-lose-his-eye|title=How Did Abu Zubaydah Lose His Eye?|work=The New Yorker|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; an alleged Al Qaeda terrorist. The European tribunal said the "two high-value prisoners" were "subjected to maltreatment and arbitrary incarceration at the CIA black site. Hence, the Lithuania and Romanian governments violated the Eastern Convention of Human Rights' ban on torture. Authorities in Lithuania also permitted the transport of Zubaydah to a secret prison in Afghanistan for additional abuse. In a separate decision, the European court learned Romania was knowledgeable of Nashiri's torture by the CIA in its own country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/press-releases/2016/06/cia-echr-rendition-torture/|title=CIA rendition victims challenge Romania and Lithuania at Europe's human rights court|website=www.amnesty.org|language=en|access-date=2018-06-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.politico.eu/article/lithuania-and-romania-accused-of-complicity-in-cia-led-torture/|title=European court finds Romania and Lithuania complicit in CIA torture|date=2018-05-31|work=POLITICO|access-date=2018-06-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''International Drug Policy Consortium''' (IDPC) is a global network of over 170 NGOs that promote objective and open debate on drug policy at national, regional and international level.&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/about&lt;/ref&gt;  IDPC supports evidence-based policies that are effective at reducing drug-related harm.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.smmgp.org.uk/html/othernewsletters/idpc.php&lt;/ref&gt; The IDPC secretariat has offices in London and Bangkok, with staff and consultants around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About IDPC Governance|url=http://idpc.net/about/governance|accessdate=7 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vision and mission ==

IDPC’s vision is that national and international drug policies are grounded in the principles of human rights and human security, social inclusion, public health, development and civil society engagement.&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/about/vision-mission&lt;/ref&gt;

Its advocacy positions are based on five core policy principles. These principles are that drug policies should:&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/policy-principles&lt;/ref&gt;

#	be developed through an objective assessment of priorities and evidence;
#	be undertaken in full compliance with international human rights law;
#	focus on reducing the harmful consequences rather than the scale of drug use and markets;
#	promote the social inclusion of marginalised groups, and not focus on punitive measures towards them;
#	be developed and implemented based on open and constructive relationships with civil society.

== Members ==

IDPC was set up in 2006 following a meeting of NGOs, which identified the need for a global advocacy and communication structure in the area of drug policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/about/governance&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, IDPC has welcomed over 170 members, which include NGOs, academic institutions, think tanks, networks and community organisations engaged in drug policy advocacy – located in every region of the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/members&lt;/ref&gt; IDPC also places a very important emphasis on promoting the voice of most affected groups, including people who use drugs and people engaged in the cultivation of crops destined to the illicit drug market – some of the key NGOs representing these populations are members of the network.

IDPC is now widely recognised as the global network of expert NGOs on drug policy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robertcarrfund.org/grantees/people-use-drugs/idpc/idpc-expert-drug-policies/&lt;/ref&gt; Every decision and advocacy position of IDPC is taken in full consultation with the membership, and the work plan is designed and implemented in close partnership with the member organisations.

In turn, IDPC offers NGOs a platform to share experience and best practice in the field of drug policy, and facilitates the engagement of the network in policy making processes at national, regional and international level – via the provision of advocacy tools, the sharing of key information on how to engage, the organisation of capacity building workshops,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.modernghana.com/news/621885/1/balanced-drug-policies-and-health-the-importance-o.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.talkingdrugs.org/idpc/reflections-on-idpc-drug-policy-workshop-in-kunming-yunnan-province-china&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wacsi.org/en/site/publications/2691/West-Africa-drug-policy-training-toolkit-Facilitation-guide-drug-policy-drug-policy-toolkit-IDPC-toolkit.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the facilitation of meetings between national governments with local NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/64663568/library/IDPC-progress-report-2014-2015.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

IDPC intervenes at two levels in the decision making process: It aims to facilitate networking and collaboration between civil society stakeholders and empower civil society members to better engage with and influence policy-making processes. In parallel, the IDPC Secretariat also intervenes directly in policy making processes by strategically providing analysis and expertise to governments, regional bodies and UN agencies to promote effective and more humane drug policy options on behalf of the network.

IDPC’s work encompasses: 
* '''Networking and communications''' – via a multilingual website, social media (Facebook,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.facebook.com/InternationalDrugPolicyConsortium/&lt;/ref&gt; Twitter,&lt;ref&gt;https://twitter.com/IDPCnet&lt;/ref&gt; LinkedIn&lt;ref&gt;https://www.linkedin.com/groups/4146546/profile&lt;/ref&gt; and Google +&lt;ref&gt;https://plus.google.com/116124134343413425009/about&lt;/ref&gt;) and media engagement&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/media&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''International advocacy''' – through direct engagement in policy making processes around drug control at international and United Nations level. IDPC spoke at the [http://idpc.net/policy-advocacy/the-un-general-assembly-special-session-on-drugs-ungass-2016 UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS)] on drugs in April 2016&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/theme/ungass-2016&lt;/ref&gt; and is frequently involved in meetings of the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]].
* '''Monitoring''' – IDPC runs a variety of tools which monitor and hold international governance to account: [http://cndblog.org/ CND Blog] provides the only publicly available transcripts from meetings of the [[Commission on Narcotic Drugs]]; [http://idpc.net/incb-watch INCB Watch] promotes the transparency and accountability of the [[International Narcotics Control Board]]; and the [https://www.bookofauthorities.info Book of Authorities] provides an easily searchable archive of agreed international statements to help inform international drug policy discussions.
* '''National and regional advocacy'''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.robertcarrfund.org/grantees/people-use-drugs/idpc/idpc-expert-drug-policies/&lt;/ref&gt; – to influence national and regional drug policies, in collaboration with local partners
* '''Publications''' – over the years, IDPC has published hundreds of reports, advocacy tools and thematic briefings.&lt;ref&gt;http://idpc.net/publications?profiles=278&lt;/ref&gt; Its flagship publication, the [http://idpc.net/publications/2016/03/idpc-drug-policy-guide-3rd-edition IDPC Drug Policy Guide], now on its 3rd edition (2016), is a comprehensive repository of best practice and recommendations on drug policy.

== Support. Don't Punish ==
'''[https://supportdontpunish.org Support. Don’t Punish]''' is a global advocacy campaign calling for better drug policies that prioritise public health and human rights. It encourages grass-root participation in campaigning for better drug policy which culminates in the Support. Don’t Punish Day of Action on 26 June each year. This is a worldwide display which, in 2016, consisted of giant video projections, street art, rallies, concerts, petitions, sports events and film screenings with participants from 130 cities from 69 countries.

The Support. Don't Punish campaign aligns with the following key messages:
* The drug control system is broken and in need of reform
* People who use drugs should no longer be criminalised
* People involved in the drug trade at low levels, especially those involved for reasons of subsistence or coercion, should not face harsh or disproportionate punishments
* The death penalty should never be imposed for drug offences
* Drug policy in the next decade should focus on health and harm reduction
* By 2020, 10% of global resources expended on drug policies should be invested in public health and harm reduction.&lt;gallery mode="nolines" caption="Support. Don't Punish Day of Action 2016" widths="300" heights="200" perrow="7"&gt;

'''''Juvenile Liaison 1''''' (1975) and '''''Juvenile Liaison 2''''' (1990) are documentary films by [[Nick Broomfield]] about a juvenile liaison project in [[Blackburn]], [[Lancashire]]. The first film examines a series of children and their run-ins with the law, over minor wrongdoings such as apple theft. The second film revisits some of the characters from the first, in some sort of attempt to measure the success of the scheme.

After its production, the first film was banned by the [[British Film Institute|BFI]] for many years; '''''Juvenile Liaison 1''''' revolved mainly around the activities of Sergeant Ray, whose preventative measures when dealing with young trouble makers fell mainly in the strong-arm category of approach. In '''''Juvenile Liaison 2''''' Ray is contacted by phone but declines to make an appearance, hinting at misrepresentation and possible damage to his career.

[[File:Keylogger-screen-capture-example.png|thumb|upright=1.8|A keylogger example of a screencapture, which holds potentially confidential and private information. The image below holds the corresponding keylogger text result.]]

'''Keystroke logging''', often referred to as '''keylogging''' or '''keyboard capturing''', is the action of recording (logging) the keys struck on a [[keyboard (computing)|keyboard]], typically covertly, so that the person using the keyboard is unaware that their actions are being monitored. Data can then be retrieved by the person operating the logging program. A '''keylogger''' can be either [[software]] or [[Computer hardware|hardware]].

While the programs themselves are legal,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.keylogger.org/keylogger.html#h_8 Use of legal software products for computer monitoring], keylogger.org&lt;/ref&gt; with many of them being designed to allow employers to oversee the use of their computers, keyloggers are most often used for the purpose of stealing [[password]]s and other confidential information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/keylogger|publisher=Oxford dictionaries |title=Keylogger}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://securelist.com/keyloggers-how-they-work-and-how-to-detect-them-part-1/36138/ Keyloggers: How they work and how to detect them (Part 1)], ''Secure List'', "Today, keyloggers are mainly used to steal user data relating to various online payment systems, and virus writers are constantly writing new keylogger Trojans for this very purpose."&lt;/ref&gt;

Keylogging can also be used to study human–computer interaction. Numerous keylogging methods exist:  they range from hardware and software-based approaches to [[acoustics|acoustic]] analysis.

== Application ==

=== Software-based keyloggers ===
[[File:Keylogger-software-logfile-example.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.8|A [[logfile]] from a software-based keylogger, based on the screencapture above.]]
[[File:Keylogger Typo Software.png|alt=Software-based Keylogger|thumb|Software-based Keylogger]]
Software-based keyloggers are computer programs designed to work on the target computer's [[software]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is a Keylogger?|url=http://www.pctools.com/security-news/what-is-a-keylogger/|publisher=PC Tools}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keyloggers are used in [[Information technology|IT]] organizations to troubleshoot technical problems with computers and business networks.  Families and business people use keyloggers legally to monitor network usage without their users' direct knowledge. Even [[Microsoft]] publicly admitted that [[Windows 10]] operation system has a built-in keylogger in its final version “to improve typing and writing services”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.privateinternetaccess.com/blog/2017/03/microsoft-windows-10-keylogger-enabled-default-heres-disable/|author=Caleb Chen|title=Microsoft Windows 10 has a keylogger enabled by default – here’s how to disable it|date=2017-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, malicious individuals can use keyloggers on public computers to steal passwords or credit card information. Most keyloggers are not stopped by [[HTTP Secure|HTTPS]] encryption because that only protects [[data in transit]] between computers, thus the threat being from the user's computer.

From a technical perspective there are several categories:

* '''Hypervisor-based''': The keylogger can theoretically reside in a [[malware]] [[hypervisor]] running underneath the operating system, which thus remains untouched. It effectively becomes a [[virtual machine]]. [[Blue Pill (software)|Blue Pill]] is a conceptual example.
* '''[[Kernel (computing)|Kernel]]-based''': A program on the machine obtains [[Superuser|root access]] to hide itself in the OS and intercepts keystrokes that pass through the kernel.  This method is difficult both to write and to combat. Such keyloggers reside at the [[Ring (computer security)|kernel level]], which makes them difficult to detect, especially for user-mode applications that don't have root access. They are frequently implemented as [[rootkit]]s that subvert the operating system kernel to gain unauthorized access to the hardware.  This makes them very powerful.  A keylogger using this method can act as a keyboard [[device driver]], for example, and thus gain access to any information typed on the keyboard as it goes to the operating system.
* '''API-based''': These keyloggers [[Hooking|hook]] keyboard [[Application programming interface|APIs]] inside a running application.  The keylogger registers keystroke events, as if it was a normal piece of the application instead of malware.  The keylogger receives an event each time the user presses or releases a key.

*  '''Form grabbing based''': [[Form grabbing]]-based keyloggers log [[Form (web)|web form]] submissions by recording the web browsing on submit events.  This happens when the user completes a form and submits it, usually by clicking a button or hitting enter.  This type of keylogger records form data before it is passed over the Internet.
*  '''Javascript-based:''' A malicious script tag is injected into a targeted web page, and listens for key events such as &lt;code&gt;onKeyUp()&lt;/code&gt;. Scripts can be injected via a variety of methods, including [[cross-site scripting]], [[man-in-the-browser]], [[Man-in-the-middle attack|man-in-the-middle]], or a compromise of the remote web site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://threatpost.com/web-based-keylogger-used-to-steal-credit-card-data-from-popular-sites/121141/|title=Web-Based Keylogger Used to Steal Credit Card Data from Popular Sites|date=2016-10-06|newspaper=Threatpost {{!}} The first stop for security news|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Keystroke logging in writing process research ====

Keystroke logging is now an established research method for the study of writing processes.&lt;ref&gt;K.P.H. Sullivan &amp; E. Lindgren (Eds., 2006), Studies in Writing: Vol. 18. Computer Key-Stroke Logging and Writing: Methods and Applications. Oxford: Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. W. Berninger (Ed., 2012), Past, present, and future contributions of cognitive writing research to cognitive psychology. New York/Sussex: Taylor &amp; Francis. {{ISBN|9781848729636}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different programs have been developed to collect online process data of writing activities,&lt;ref name=AAA&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spywareloop.com/news/keystroke-logging |title=Keystroke Logging in SpyWareLoop.com |author=Vincentas |newspaper=''Spyware Loop'' |date=11 July 2013 |accessdate=27 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131207133350/http://www.spywareloop.com/news/keystroke-logging |archivedate= 7 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Inputlog]], Scriptlog, and Translog.

Keystroke logging is legitimately used as a suitable research instrument in a number of writing contexts.  These include studies on cognitive writing processes, which include
* descriptions of writing strategies; the writing development of children (with and without writing difficulties),
* spelling, 
* first and second language writing, and 
* specialist skill areas such as translation and subtitling. 
Keystroke logging can be used to research writing, specifically.  It can also be integrated in educational domains for second language learning, programming skills, and typing skills.

==== Related features ====

Software keyloggers may be augmented with features that capture user information without relying on keyboard key presses as the sole input. Some of these features include:

* Clipboard logging.  Anything that has been copied to the [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]] can be captured by the program.
* Screen logging. [[Screenshot]]s are taken to capture graphics-based information.  Applications with screen logging abilities may take screenshots of the whole screen, of just one application, or even just around the mouse cursor.  They may take these screenshots periodically or in response to user behaviours (for example, when a user clicks the mouse).  A practical application that is used by some keyloggers with this screen logging ability, is to take small screenshots around where a mouse has just clicked; thus defeating web-based keyboards (for example, the web-based screen keyboards that are often used by banks), and any web-based on-screen keyboard without screenshot protection.
* Programmatically capturing the text in a [[GUI widget|control]].  The [[Microsoft Windows]] [[Application programming interface|API]] allows programs to request the text 'value' in some controls.  This means that some passwords may be captured, even if they are hidden behind password masks (usually asterisks).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb761584(VS.85).aspx|author=Microsoft|title=EM_GETLINE Message()|accessdate=2009-07-15|publisher=[[Microsoft]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The recording of every program/folder/window opened including a screenshot of each and every website visited.
* The recording of [[Web search query|search engines queries]], [[instant messenger]] conversations, FTP downloads and other Internet-based activities (including the bandwidth used).

=== Hardware-based keyloggers ===
[[File:Keylogger-hardware-PS2.jpg|thumb|A hardware-based keylogger.]]
[[File:Keylogger-hardware-PS2-example-connected.jpg|thumb|A connected hardware-based keylogger.]]
{{Main|Hardware keylogger}}
Hardware-based keyloggers do not depend upon any software being installed as they exist at a hardware level in a computer system.

* Firmware-based: [[BIOS]]-level [[firmware]] that handles keyboard events can be modified to record these events as they are processed. Physical and/or [[Superuser|root-level access]] is required to the machine, and the software loaded into the BIOS needs to be created for the specific hardware that it will be running on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apple keyboard hack|url=http://www.digitalsociety.org/2009/08/apple-keyboards-hacked-and-possessed/|work=Apple keyboard hack|publisher=Digital Society|accessdate=9 June 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090826150015/http://www.digitalsociety.org/2009/08/apple-keyboards-hacked-and-possessed|archivedate=26 August 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Keyboard hardware: Hardware keyloggers are used for keystroke logging by means of a hardware circuit that is attached somewhere in between the [[computer keyboard]] and the computer, typically inline with the keyboard's cable connector. There are also [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]] connectors based Hardware keyloggers as well as ones for Laptop computers (the Mini-PCI card plugs into the expansion slot of a laptop). More stealthy implementations can be installed or built into standard keyboards, so that no device is visible on the external cable. Both types log all keyboard activity to their [[Primary storage|internal memory]], which can be subsequently accessed, for example, by typing in a secret key sequence. A hardware keylogger has an advantage over a software solution: it is not dependent on being installed on the target computer's operating system and therefore will not interfere with any program running on the target machine or be detected by any [[Anti-spyware software|software]]. However its physical presence may be detected if, for example, it is installed outside the case as an inline device between the computer and the keyboard.  Some of these implementations have the ability to be controlled and monitored remotely by means of a wireless communication standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keylogger Removal |url=http://spyreveal.com/keyloggerremoval |work=Keylogger Removal |publisher=SpyReveal Anti Keylogger |accessdate=25 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110429181147/http://spyreveal.com/keyloggerremoval |archivedate=29 April 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Wireless keyboard and mouse sniffers: These passive sniffers collect packets of data being transferred from a wireless keyboard and its receiver. As encryption may be used to secure the wireless communications between the two devices, this may need to be cracked beforehand if the transmissions are to be read. In some cases this enables an attacker to type arbitrary commands into a victim’s computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Keylogger Removal|url=https://www.bastille.net/technical-details|work=Keylogger Removal|publisher=SpyReveal Anti Keylogger|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Keyboard overlays: Criminals have been known to use keyboard overlays on [[Automated teller machine|ATMs]] to capture people's PINs. Each keypress is registered by the keyboard of the ATM as well as the criminal's keypad that is placed over it. The device is designed to look like an integrated part of the machine so that bank customers are unaware of its presence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/155525/.html?tk=rss_news|title=Tampered Credit Card Terminals|author=Jeremy Kirk|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]] News Service|date=2008-12-16|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Acoustic keyloggers: [[Acoustic cryptanalysis]] can be used to monitor the sound created by someone typing on a computer. Each key on the keyboard makes a subtly different acoustic signature when struck. It is then possible to identify which keystroke signature relates to which keyboard character via [[Statistics|statistical methods]] such as [[frequency analysis]]. The repetition frequency of similar acoustic keystroke signatures, the timings between different keyboard strokes and other context information such as the probable language in which the user is writing are used in this analysis to map sounds to letters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inf.ed.ac.uk/publications/thesis/online/IM100855.pdf|author=Andrew Kelly|title=Cracking Passwords using Keyboard Acoustics and Language Modeling|date=2010-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; A fairly long recording (1000 or more keystrokes) is required so that a big enough [[sample (statistics)|sample]] is collected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berkeley.edu/news/media/releases/2005/09/14_key.shtml |author=Sarah Young |title=Researchers recover typed text using audio recording of keystrokes |publisher=UC Berkeley NewsCenter|date=14 September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Electromagnetic emissions: It is possible to capture the [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic emissions]] of a wired keyboard from up to {{Convert|20|m|ft}} away, without being physically wired to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Knight|first1=Will|title=A Year Ago: Cypherpunks publish proof of Tempest {{!}} ZDNet|url=http://www.zdnet.com/article/a-year-ago-cypherpunks-publish-proof-of-tempest/|website=ZDNet|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Swiss researchers tested 11 different [[Universal Serial Bus|USB]], [[IBM Personal System/2|PS/2]] and laptop keyboards in a semi-[[anechoic chamber]] and found them all vulnerable, primarily because of the prohibitive cost of adding [[Electromagnetic shielding|shielding]] during manufacture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://infoscience.epfl.ch/record/140523?ln=en|title=Compromising Electromagnetic Emanations of Wired and Wireless Keyboards|date=2009-06-01|author=Martin Vuagnoux and Sylvain Pasini|publisher=Security and Cryptography Laboratory (LASEC)|location=[[Lausanne]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The researchers used a wide-band [[Receiver (radio)|receiver]] to tune into the specific frequency of the emissions radiated from the keyboards.
*Optical surveillance: Optical surveillance, while not a keylogger in the classical sense, is nonetheless an approach that can be used to capture passwords or PINs.  A strategically placed camera, such as a hidden [[surveillance camera]] at an [[Automated teller machine|ATM]], can allow a criminal to watch a PIN or password being entered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/fraud/atm/atmcamera.asp|title=ATM camera|publisher=[http://snopes.com/ snopes.com]|accessdate=2009-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Maggi |first1=Federico |last2=Volpatto |first2=Alberto |last3=Gasparini |first3=Simone |last4=Boracchi |first4=Giacomo |last5=Zanero |first5=Stefano |year=2011 |title=A fast eavesdropping attack against touchscreens |conference=7th International Conference on Information Assurance and Security |publisher=IEEE |doi=10.1109/ISIAS.2011.6122840 |url=http://www.syssec-project.eu/m/page-media/3/iclearshot-ias11.pdf }}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
*Physical evidence: For a keypad that is used only to enter a security code, the keys which are in actual use will have evidence of use from many fingerprints. A passcode of four digits, if the four digits in question are known, is reduced from 10,000 possibilities to just 24 possibilities (10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; versus 4! ([[factorial]] of 4)). These could then be used on separate occasions for a manual "brute force attack".
*Smartphone sensors: Researchers have demonstrated that it is possible to capture the keystrokes of nearby computer keyboards using only the commodity [[accelerometer]] found in smartphones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Marquardt |first1=Philip |last2=Verma |first2=Arunabh |last3=Carter |first3=Henry |last4=Traynor |first4=Patrick |year=2011 |title=(sp)iPhone: decoding vibrations from nearby keyboards using mobile phone accelerometers |conference=Proceedings of the 18th ACM conference on Computer and communications security |pages=561–562 |publisher=ACM |doi=10.1145/2046707.2046771 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=August 25, 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The attack is made possible by placing a smartphone near a keyboard on the same desk. The smartphone's accelerometer can then detect the vibrations created by typing on the keyboard, and then translate this raw accelerometer signal into readable sentences with as much as 80 percent accuracy. The technique involves working through probability by detecting pairs of keystrokes, rather than individual keys. It models "keyboard events" in pairs and then works out whether the pair of keys pressed is on the left or the right side of the keyboard and whether they are close together or far apart on the QWERTY keyboard. Once it has worked this out, it compares the results to a preloaded dictionary where each word has been broken down in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/2011/10/iphone-keylogger-spying/ |title=iPhone Accelerometer Could Spy on Computer Keystrokes |publisher=[https://www.wired.com/ Wired] |date= 19 October 2011|accessdate=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar techniques have also been shown to be effective at capturing keystrokes on touchscreen keyboards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Owusu |first1=Emmanuel |last2=Han |first2=Jun |last3=Das |first3=Sauvik |last4=Perrig |first4=Adrian |last5=Zhang |first5=Joy |year=2012 |title=ACCessory: password inference using accelerometers on smartphones |conference=Proceedings of the Thirteenth Workshop on Mobile Computing Systems and Applications |publisher=ACM |doi=10.1145/2162081.2162095 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Aviv |first1=Adam J. |last2=Sapp |first2=Benjamin |last3=Blaze |first3=Matt |last4=Smith |first4=Jonathan M. |year=2012 |title=Practicality of accelerometer side channels on smartphones |conference=Proceedings of the 28th Annual Computer Security Applications Conference |publisher=ACM |doi=10.1145/2420950.2420957 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Cai |first1=Liang |last2=Chen |first2=Hao |year=2011 |title=TouchLogger: inferring keystrokes on touch screen from smartphone motion |conference=Proceedings of the 6th USENIX conference on Hot topics in security |publisher=USENIX |url=https://www.usenix.org/events/hotsec11/tech/final_files/Cai.pdf |accessdate=25 August 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; while in some cases, in combination with [[gyroscope]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Xu |first1=Zhi |last2=Bai |first2=Kun |last3=Zhu |first3=Sencun |year=2012 |title=TapLogger: inferring user inputs on smartphone touchscreens using on-board motion sensors |conference=Proceedings of the fifth ACM conference on Security and Privacy in Wireless and Mobile Networks |publisher=ACM |pages=113–124 |doi=10.1145/2185448.2185465 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Miluzzo |first1=Emiliano |last2=Varshavsky |first2=Alexander |last3=Balakrishnan |first3=Suhrid |last4=Choudhury |first4=Romit Roy |year=2012 |title=Tapprints: your finger taps have fingerprints |conference=Proceedings of the 10th international conference on Mobile systems, applications, and services |pages=323–336 |publisher=ACM |doi=10.1145/2307636.2307666 }}&lt;!--|accessdate=25 August 2014 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; or with the ambient-light sensor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Spreitzer |first1=Raphael | year=2014 |title=PIN Skimming: Exploiting the Ambient-Light Sensor in Mobile Devices |conference=Proceedings of the 4th ACM Workshop on Security and Privacy in Smartphones &amp; Mobile Devices |publisher=ACM |pages=51–62 |doi=10.1145/2666620.2666622|arxiv=1405.3760 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In the mid 1970s, the [[Soviet Union]] developed and deployed a hardware keylogger targeting [[typewriter]]s. Termed the "selectric bug", it measured the movements of the print head of IBM Selectric typewriters via subtle influences on the regional magnetic field caused by the rotation and movements of the print head.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cryptomuseum.com/covert/bugs/selectric/index.htm&lt;/ref&gt; An early keylogger was written by [[Perry Kivolowitz]] and posted to the Usenet news group net.unix-wizards,net.sources on November 17, 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://securitydigest.org/unix/archive/006|accessdate=2009-11-22|title=The Security Digest Archives}}&lt;/ref&gt; The posting seems to be a motivating factor in restricting access to &lt;tt&gt;/dev/kmem&lt;/tt&gt; on [[Unix]] systems. The [[user-mode]] program operated by locating and dumping character lists (clists) as they were assembled in the Unix kernel.

In the 1970s, spies installed keystroke loggers in the US Embassy and Consulate buildings in [[Moscow]] and [[Saint Petersburg|Leningrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qccglobal.com/news/first-keystroke-logger.php|title=Soviet Spies Bugged World's First Electronic Typewriters|work=qccglobal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ingersoll"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Soviet embassies used manual typewriters, rather than electric typewriters, for [[classified information]]—apparently because they are immune to such bugs.&lt;ref name=gunman/&gt;
As of 2013, Russian special services still use typewriters.&lt;ref name="ingersoll" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://technology.inquirer.net/27149/wanted-20-electric-typewriters-for-russia-to-avoid-leaks|title=Wanted: 20 electric typewriters for Russia to avoid leaks|author=Agence France-Presse, Associated Press|work=inquirer.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

== Cracking ==
Writing simple software applications for keylogging can be trivial, and like any nefarious computer program, can be distributed as a [[Trojan horse (computing)|trojan horse]] or as part of a [[Computer virus|virus]]. What is not trivial for an attacker, however, is installing a covert keystroke logger without getting caught and downloading data that has been logged without being traced. An attacker that manually connects to a host machine to download logged keystrokes risks being traced. A trojan that sends keylogged data to a fixed e-mail address or [[IP address]] risks exposing the attacker.

=== Trojans ===
Researchers{{who|date=September 2018}} devised several methods for solving this problem.{{clarify|date=September 2018}} They presented a deniable password snatching attack in which the keystroke logging trojan is installed using a virus or worm.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Adam |last2=Yung |first2=Moti |year=1997 |title=Deniable Password Snatching: On the Possibility of Evasive Electronic Espionage |journal=Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy |pages=224–235 |publisher=IEEE |doi=10.1109/SECPRI.1997.601339 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=601339&amp;tag=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Young |first1=Adam |last2=Yung |first2=Moti |year=1996 |title=Cryptovirology: extortion-based security threats and countermeasures |journal=Proceedings of IEEE Symposium on Security and Privacy |pages=129–140 |publisher=IEEE |doi=10.1109/SECPRI.1996.502676 |url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=502676&amp;tag=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; An attacker who is caught with the virus or worm can claim to be a victim. The [[cryptotrojan]] asymmetrically encrypts the pilfered login/password pairs using the [[public key]] of the trojan author and covertly broadcasts the resulting [[ciphertext]]. They mentioned that the ciphertext can be [[steganography|steganographically]] encoded and posted to a public bulletin board such as [[Usenet]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}

=== Use by police ===
In 2000, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] used FlashCrest iSpy to obtain the [[Pretty Good Privacy|PGP]] [[passphrase]] of [[Nicodemo Scarfo, Jr.]], son of mob boss [[Nicodemo Scarfo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2000/12/06/mafia_trial_to_test_fbi/|title=Mafia trial to test FBI spying tactics: Keystroke logging used to spy on mob suspect using PGP|date=2000-12-06|accessdate=2009-04-19|publisher=The Register|author=John Leyden}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Also in 2000, the FBI lured two suspected Russian cyber criminals to the US in an elaborate ruse, and captured their usernames and passwords with a keylogger that was covertly installed on a machine that they used to access their computers in [[Russia]].  The FBI then used these credentials to hack into the suspects' computers in Russia in order to obtain evidence to prosecute them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2002/08/16/russians_accuse_fbi_agent/|title=Russians accuse FBI Agent of Hacking|publisher=The Register|date=2002-08-16|author=John Leyden}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Countermeasures ==
The effectiveness of countermeasures varies, because keyloggers use a variety of techniques to capture data and the countermeasure needs to be effective against the particular data capture technique. In the case of Windows 10 keylogging from Microsoft it is enough to change some privacy settings on your computer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spyrix.com/3-methods-to-disable-windows-10-built-in-spy-keylogger.php|author=Alex Stim|title=3 methods to disable Windows 10 built-in Spy Keylogger|date=2015-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, an on-screen keyboard will be effective against hardware keyloggers, transparency will defeat some—but not all—screenloggers and an [[anti-spyware]] application that can only disable hook-based keyloggers will be ineffective against kernel-based keyloggers.

Also, keylogger program authors may be able to update the code to adapt to countermeasures that may have proven to be effective against them.

=== Anti-keyloggers ===
{{Main|Anti-keylogger}}
An [[anti-keylogger]] is a piece of [[software]] specifically designed to detect keyloggers on a computer, typically comparing all files in the computer against a database of keyloggers looking for similarities which might signal the presence of a hidden keylogger. As anti-keyloggers have been designed specifically to detect keyloggers, they have the potential to be more effective than conventional antivirus software; some antivirus software do not consider a keylogger to be a virus, as under some circumstances a keylogger can be considered a legitimate piece of software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web
 |url = http://www.securitysupervisor.com/security-q-a/computer-security/218-what-is-anti-keylogger
 |title = What is Anti Keylogger?
 |date = 23 August 2018
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Live CD/USB ===
Rebooting the computer using a [[Live CD]] or write-protected [[Live USB]] is a possible countermeasure against software keyloggers if the CD is clean of malware and the operating system contained on it is secured and fully patched so that it cannot be infected as soon as it is started.  Booting a different operating system does not impact the use of a hardware or BIOS based keylogger.

=== Anti-spyware / Anti-virus programs ===
Many [[anti-spyware]] applications are able to detect some software based keyloggers and quarantine, disable or cleanse them.  However, because many keylogging programs are legitimate pieces of software under some circumstances, anti spyware often neglects to label keylogging programs as spyware or a virus. These applications are able to detect software-based keyloggers based on patterns in [[Subroutine|executable code]], [[heuristics]] and keylogger behaviours (such as the use of [[Hooking|hooks]] and certain [[Application programming interface|API]]s).

No software-based anti-spyware application can be 100% effective against all keyloggers.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}
Also, software-based anti-spyware cannot defeat non-software keyloggers (for example, hardware keyloggers attached to keyboards will always receive keystrokes before any software-based anti-spyware application).

However, the particular technique that the anti-spyware application uses will influence its potential effectiveness against software keyloggers.  As a general rule, anti-spyware applications with [[Ring (computer security)|higher privileges]] will defeat keyloggers with lower privileges.  For example, a hook-based anti-spyware application cannot defeat a kernel-based keylogger (as the keylogger will receive the keystroke messages before the anti-spyware application), but it could potentially defeat hook- and API-based keyloggers.

=== Network monitors ===
[[Network monitoring|Network monitors]] (also known as reverse-firewalls) can be used to alert the user whenever an application attempts to make a network connection. This gives the user the chance to prevent the keylogger from "[[phoning home]]" with his or her typed information.

=== Automatic form filler programs ===
{{Main|Form filler}}
Automatic form-filling programs may prevent keylogging by removing the requirement for a user to type personal details and passwords using the keyboard. [[Form filler]]s are primarily designed for [[web browser]]s to fill in checkout pages and log users into their accounts. Once the user's account and [[credit card]] information has been entered into the program, it will be automatically entered into forms without ever using the keyboard or [[Clipboard (software)|clipboard]], thereby reducing the possibility that private data is being recorded. However someone with physical access to the machine may still be able to install software that is able to intercept this information elsewhere in the operating system or while in transit on the network. ([[Transport Layer Security]] (TLS) reduces the risk that data in transit may be intercepted by [[Packet analyzer|network sniffers]] and [[Proxy server|proxy tools]].)

=== One-time passwords (OTP) ===
Using [[one-time password]]s may be keylogger-safe, as each password is invalidated as soon as it is used. This solution may be useful for someone using a public computer. However, an attacker who has remote control over such a computer can simply wait for the victim to enter his/her credentials before performing unauthorised transactions on their behalf while their session is active.

=== Security tokens ===
Use of [[smart card]]s or other [[security token]]s may improve security against [[replay attack]]s in the face of a successful keylogging attack, as accessing protected information would require both the (hardware) security token ''as well as'' the appropriate password/passphrase. Knowing the keystrokes, mouse actions, display, clipboard etc. used on one computer will not subsequently help an attacker gain access to the protected resource.  Some security tokens work as a type of hardware-assisted one-time password system, and others implement a cryptographic [[challenge-response authentication]], which can improve security in a manner conceptually similar to one time passwords. [[Card reader|Smartcard readers]] and their associated keypads for [[Personal identification number|PIN]] entry may be vulnerable to keystroke logging through a so-called [[supply chain attack]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/10/10/organized_crime_doctors_chip_and_pin_machines/|author=Austin Modine|title=Organized crime tampers with European card swipe devices|date=2008-10-10|accessdate=2009-04-18|publisher=The Register}}&lt;/ref&gt; where an attacker substitutes the card reader/PIN entry hardware for one which records the user's PIN.

=== On-screen keyboards ===
Most on-screen keyboards (such as the on-screen keyboard that comes with [[Windows XP]]) send normal keyboard event messages to the external target program to type text.  Software key loggers can log these typed characters sent from one program to another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://windowssecrets.com/top-story/prevent-keyloggers-from-grabbing-your-passwords/|author=Scott Dunn|title=Prevent keyloggers from grabbing your passwords|date=2009-09-10|accessdate=2014-05-10|publisher=Windows Secrets}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additionally, keylogging software can take screenshots of what is displayed on the screen (periodically, and/or upon each mouse click), which means that although certainly a useful security measure, an on-screen keyboard will not protect from all keyloggers.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

=== Keystroke interference software ===
Keystroke interference software is also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://networkintercept.com/keystrokeinterference.html |author=Christopher Ciabarra |title=Anti Keylogger |date=2009-06-10 |publisher=Networkintercept.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100626093658/http://networkintercept.com/keystrokeinterference.html |archivedate=2010-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
These programs attempt to trick keyloggers by introducing random keystrokes, although this simply results in the keylogger recording more information than it needs to.  An attacker has the task of extracting the keystrokes of interest—the security of this mechanism, specifically how well it stands up to [[cryptanalysis]], is unclear.

=== Speech recognition ===

Similar to on-screen keyboards, [[Speech recognition|speech-to-text conversion]] software can also be used against keyloggers, since there are no typing or mouse movements involved. The weakest point of using voice-recognition software may be how the software sends the recognized text to target software after the recognition took place.

=== Handwriting recognition and mouse gestures ===

Also, many [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s and lately [[tablet computer|tablet PC]]s can already convert pen (also called stylus) movements on their [[touchscreen]]s to computer understandable text successfully. [[Mouse gestures]] use this principle by using mouse movements instead of a stylus. Mouse gesture programs convert these strokes to user-definable actions, such as typing text. Similarly, [[graphics tablet]]s and [[light pen]]s can be used to input these gestures, however these are less common everyday.

The same potential weakness of speech recognition applies to this technique as well.

=== Macro expanders/recorders ===

With the help of many programs, a seemingly meaningless text can be expanded to a meaningful text and most of the time context-sensitively, e.g. "en.wikipedia.org" can be expanded when a web browser window has the focus. The biggest weakness of this technique is that these programs send their keystrokes directly to the target program. However, this can be overcome by using [[#Non technological methods|the 'alternating' technique described below]], i.e. sending mouse clicks to non-responsive areas of the target program, sending meaningless keys, sending another mouse click to target area (e.g. password field) and switching back-and-forth.

=== Deceptive typing ===

Alternating between typing the login credentials and typing characters somewhere else in the focus window&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cups.cs.cmu.edu/soups/2006/posters/herley-poster_abstract.pdf|format=PDF|title=How To Login From an Internet Cafe Without Worrying About Keyloggers|publisher=[[Microsoft Research]]|author=Cormac Herley and Dinei Florencio|date=2006-02-06|accessdate=2008-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; can cause a keylogger to record more information than they need to, although this could easily be filtered out by an attacker. Similarly, a user can move their cursor using the mouse during typing, causing the logged keystrokes to be in the wrong order e.g., by typing a password beginning with the last letter and then using the mouse to move the cursor for each subsequent letter. Lastly, someone can also use [[context menu]]s to remove, [[cut, copy, and paste]] parts of the typed text without using the keyboard.  An attacker who is able to capture only parts of a password will have a larger [[key space (cryptography)|key space]] to attack if he chose to execute a [[brute-force attack]].

Another very similar technique uses the fact that any selected text portion is replaced by the next key typed. e.g., if the password is "secret", one could type "s", then some dummy keys "asdfsd". Then, these dummies could be selected with the mouse, and the next character from the password "e" is typed, which replaces the dummies "asdfsd".

These techniques assume incorrectly that keystroke logging software cannot directly monitor the clipboard, the selected text in a form, or take a screenshot every time a keystroke or mouse click occurs. They may however be effective against some hardware keyloggers.

'''Laura E. Little''' is an American legal scholar and author, specializing in [[conflict of laws]], [[federal judiciary of the United States|federal courts]], humor and the law, the law of freedom of expression, and constitutional law. She is the James G. Schmidt Professor of Law at [[Temple University School of Law]]. 

== Biography ==
Professor Little graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Latin honors|''magna cum laude'']], where she majored in economics. She went on to Temple University School of Law, receiving her [[Juris Doctor|J.D.]], ''summa cum laude''. During her time in law school, Little served as Editor-in-Chief of [[Temple Law Review]]. After graduation, Little served as a law clerk for [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] Judge [[James Hunter III]] and then clerked for  [[Supreme Court of the United States]] Chief Justice [[William Rehnquist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-06-24|title=List of law clerks of the Supreme Court of the United States|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=List_of_law_clerks_of_the_Supreme_Court_of_the_United_States&amp;oldid=787194630|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Little later joined the law firm of [[Dechert Price &amp; Rhoades]] and worked in general commercial litigation. In 1989, Little joined Kohn, Savett, Klein &amp; Graf, P.C. where she represented the print media in Philadelphia in [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] matters.

In 1990, Little joined the full-time faculty at Temple University's Beasley School of Law. As a faculty member, her law teaching specializes in conflict of laws, federal courts, First Amendment, and constitutional law. Little has received prestigious awards during her time in academia, including the [[Temple University]] "Great Teacher" Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.temple.edu/provost/faculty/awards/great-teacher.html|title=Office of the Provost {{!}} Temple University|website=www.temple.edu|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Little has served as an appellate advocate and consultant on many matters related to the conflict of laws, federal jurisdiction, and the [[U.S. Constitution]]. She was appointed by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit]] to argue and brief the case of ''[[Trinsey v. Pennsylvania]]'', which challenged senatorial succession processes under the U.S. Constitution's [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Amendment]]. 

Little's work includes academic analysis of U.S. federal judicial selection, which was quoted, cited, and relied on extensively by the [[Supreme Court of India]] in its decision striking down India's system for appointing judges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://supremecourtofindia.nic.in/FileServer/2015-10-16_1444997560.pdf|title=IN THE SUPREME COURT OF INDIA CIVIL ORIGINAL JURISDICTION WRIT PETITION (CIVIL) NO. 13 OF 2015|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Little is also the sole author of a leading casebook on conflict of laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.wklegaledu.com/aspen-casebook-series/id-5266/Conflict_of_Laws|title=Conflict of Laws {{!}} Little {{!}} 9780735599178 {{!}} Wolters Kluwer|website=www.wklegaledu.com|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and a well-regarded bar lecturer, preparing students for the conflict of laws section of the Pennsylvania portion of the bar. [[American Law Institute|The American Law Institute]] appointed Little to serve as the Associate Reporter of the [[Restatements of the Law|Restatement]] Third of Conflict of Laws in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ali.org/projects/show/conflict-laws/|title=Current Projects {{!}} American Law Institute|last=Institute|first=The American Law|website=American Law Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ali.org/members/member/424829/|title=Members {{!}} American Law Institute|last=Institute|first=The American Law|website=American Law Institute|language=en|access-date=2017-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An internationally-renowned expert on the intersection of humor and the law, Little has lectured around the world on this subject and is the author of many articles and book chapters. She received a national award for her work, "Regulating Funny: Humor and the Law" published by ''[[Cornell Law Review]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scholarship.law.cornell.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3144&amp;context=clr|title=Regulating Funny: Humor and the Law|last=Little|first=Laura|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which analyzes how law prefers certain types of humor in the areas of trademark, contract, and employment discrimination.  Her book, "Guilty Pleasures:  Comedy and Law in America," was published by Oxford University Press in 2018.

==History==
Development of LEED began in 1993, spearheaded by [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) senior scientist [[Robert K. Watson]]. As founding chairman of the LEED Steering Committee,  Watson led a broad-based consensus process until 2007, bringing together non-profit organizations, government agencies, architects, engineers, developers, builders, product manufacturers and other industry leaders. The LEED initiative was supported by a strong USGBC Board of Directors, chaired by Steven Winter from 1999 to 2003, and very active staff, including Nigel Howard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dev1.usgbc.org/organizations/steven-winter-associates-inc?view=overview |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724215822/http://dev1.usgbc.org/organizations/steven-winter-associates-inc?view=overview |archivedate=2015-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, USGBC’s Senior Vice President of LEED, Scot Horst, became chair of the LEED Steering Committee before joining USGBC staff. Early LEED committee members also included USGBC co-founder Mike Italiano, architects Bill Reed and Sandy Mendler, builders Gerard Heiber and Myron Kibbe, and engineer Richard Bourne. As interest in LEED grew, in 1996, engineers Tom Paladino and Lynn Barker co-chaired the newly formed LEED technical committee.

From 1994 to 2015, LEED grew from one standard for new construction to a comprehensive system of interrelated standards covering aspects from the design and construction to the maintenance and operation of buildings. LEED also has grown from six volunteers on one committee to 119,924 staff, volunteers and professionals.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbc.org/profile |title=LEED Projects Directory |accessdate=27 February 2014 |publisher=US Green Building Council |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301131026/http://www.usgbc.org/profile |archivedate=1 March 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; LEED standards have been applied to approximately 83,452 registered and certified LEED projects worldwide, covering around 13.8 billion square feet (1.28 billion square meters).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = About LEED {{!}} U.S. Green Building Council|url = http://www.usgbc.org/articles/about-leed|website = www.usgbc.org|accessdate = 2015-11-21|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114171952/http://www.usgbc.org/articles/about-leed|archivedate = 2016-01-14|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many U.S. federal agencies and states and local governments require or reward LEED certification. However, four states (Alabama, Georgia, Maine, and Mississippi) have effectively banned the use of LEED in new public buildings, preferring other industry standards that the USGBC considers too lax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Why Are Some States Trying to Ban LEED Green Building Standards?|url = http://www.citylab.com/design/2013/08/why-are-some-states-trying-ban-leed-green-building-standards/6691/|website = CityLab|accessdate = 2015-11-21|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151122115401/http://www.citylab.com/design/2013/08/why-are-some-states-trying-ban-leed-green-building-standards/6691/|archivedate = 2015-11-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike model building codes, such as the [[International Building Code]], only members of the USGBC and specific "in-house" committees may add to, subtract from, or edit the standard, subject to an internal review process. Proposals to modify the LEED standards are offered and publicly reviewed by USGBC's member organizations, which number almost 12,216.&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;

USGBC's [[Green Business Certification Inc.]] (GBCI) offers various accreditation to people who demonstrate knowledge of the LEED rating system, including LEED Accredited Professional (LEED AP), LEED Green Associate,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = LEED Green Associate Exam Prep - GreenEDU.com|url = https://www.greenedu.com/leed-green-associate-exam-prep|website = www.greenedu.com|accessdate = 2015-11-21|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151122115024/https://www.greenedu.com/leed-green-associate-exam-prep|archivedate = 2015-11-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2011, LEED Fellows, the highest designation for LEED professionals. GBCI also certifies projects pursuing LEED.

==Rating systems==
LEED has evolved since 1998 to more accurately represent and incorporate emerging green building technologies. The pilot version, LEED New Construction (NC) v1.0, led to LEED NCv2.0, LEED NCv2.2 in 2005, and LEED 2009 (previously named LEED v3) in 2009. LEED v4 was introduced in November, 2013. Until October 31, 2016, new projects could choose between LEED 2009 and LEED v4.  New projects registering after October 31, 2016 have been required to use LEED v4.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=USGBC Announces Extension of LEED 2009|url=http://www.usgbc.org/articles/usgbc-announces-extension-leed-2009#comment-4384|website=USGBC.org|accessdate=2014-12-18|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141218202727/http://www.usgbc.org/articles/usgbc-announces-extension-leed-2009#comment-4384|archivedate=2014-12-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

LEED 2009 encompasses ten rating systems for the design, construction and operation of buildings, homes and neighborhoods.&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt; Five overarching categories correspond to the specialties available under the LEED professional program. That suite currently consists of:

'''Green Building Design &amp; Construction'''
*LEED for New Construction
*LEED for Core &amp; Shell
*LEED for Schools
*LEED for Retail: New Construction and Major Renovations
*LEED for Healthcare

'''Green Interior Design &amp; Construction'''
*LEED for Commercial Interiors
*LEED for Retail: Commercial Interiors

'''Green Building Operations &amp; Maintenance'''
*LEED for Existing Buildings: Operations &amp; Maintenance

'''Green Neighborhood Development'''
*LEED for Neighborhood Development&lt;ref name="berkeley"/&gt;

'''Green Home Design and Construction'''
*LEED for Homes (The LEED for Homes rating system is different from LEED v3, with different point categories and thresholds that reward efficient residential design.{{citation needed|date=November 2013}})

LEED also forms the basis for other sustainability rating systems such as the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Labs21.

To make it easier to follow LEED requirements, in 2009 USGBC helped BuildingGreen develop LEEDuser, a guide to the LEED certification process and applying for LEED credits written by professionals in the field.&lt;ref&gt;

===LEED 2009===
[[File:Abad Nucleus Mall Front.jpg|thumb|[[Abad Nucleus Mall]], at [[Maradu]], [[Kochi]], is [[India]]'s first LEED certified gold-rated green mall.]]After four years of development, aligning credit across all LEED rating systems and weighing credits based on environmental priority, USGBC launched   LEED v3,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1970|title=LEEDv3|publisher=US Green Building Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100225022230/http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1970|archivedate=25 February 2010|deadurl=no|accessdate=20 February 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which consists of a new continuous development process, a new version of LEED Online, a revised third-party certification program and a new suite of rating systems known as LEED 2009.

Under LEED 2009, there are 100 possible base points distributed across six credit categories: "[[Sustainable Sites]]", "[[Water Efficiency]]", "Energy and Atmosphere", "Materials and Resources", "Indoor Environmental Quality", and "Innovation in Design". Up to 10 additional points may be earned: four additional points may be received for Regional Priority Credits, and six additional points for Innovation in Design (which includes exemplary performance credits for existing credit categories).[[File:Taipei101.portrait.altonthompson.jpg|thumb|[[Taipei 101]], the tallest and largest green building of LEED Platinum certification in the world since 2011.]]

====Certification level====
Buildings can qualify for four levels of certification:
*'''Certified:''' 40–49 points 
*'''Silver:''' 50-59 points
*'''Gold:''' 60-79 points
*'''Platinum:''' 80 points and above

====Goal of the credit system====
The LEED 2009 performance credit system aims to allocate points "based on the potential [[environmental impact]]s and human benefits of each credit." These are weighed using the environmental impact categories of the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]'s Tools for the Reduction and Assessment of Chemical and Other Environmental Impacts (TRACI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs8868.pdf|title=Page not found - U.S. Green Building Council|author=|date=|website=usgbc.org|accessdate=28 April 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327061247/http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs8868.pdf|archivedate=27 March 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the environmental-impact weighting scheme developed by the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]] (NIST).

====Prerequisites====
To participate in LEED 2009, a building must comply with [[environmental law]]s and regulations, occupancy scenarios, building permanence and pre-rating completion, site boundaries and area-to-site ratios. Its owner must share data on the building's energy and water use for five years after occupancy (for new construction) or date of certification (for existing buildings).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=6715 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111205123305/http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=6715 |archivedate=2011-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each of the performance categories also have mandatory measures in each category, which receive no points.

====Credit weighting process====
The weighting process has three steps:&lt;ref name="usgbc.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=8868 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218194447/http://www.usgbc.org/ShowFile.aspx?DocumentID=8868 |archivedate=2011-12-18 |df= }} p. xii.&lt;/ref&gt;
# A collection of reference buildings are used to estimate the environmental impacts of any building seeking LEED certification in a designated rating scheme.
# NIST weightings are used to judge the relative importance of these impacts in each category.
# Data regarding actual impacts on environmental and human health are used to assign points to individual categories and measures.

This system results in a weighted average for each rating scheme based upon actual impacts and the relative importance of those impacts to human health and environmental quality.

The LEED council also appears to have assigned credit and measure weighting based upon the market implications of point allocation.&lt;ref name="usgbc.org"/&gt;

From 2010, buildings can use carbon offsets to achieve Green Power Credits for LEED-NC (New Construction Certification) :&lt;ref name="Green Power Credits for LEED-NC"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.tboake.com/carbon-aia/carbon_definition.html|title = LEED Certification &amp;#124; The CarbonNeutral Company US|publisher = Us.carbonneutral.com|accessdate = 2012-08-13|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20140319091808/http://tboake.com/carbon-aia/carbon_definition.html|archivedate = 2014-03-19|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LEED for Homes===
Additional performance categories in the LEED for Homes rating system are Locations and Linkages (recognizing the importance of transportation access, open space, and physical activity outdoors) and Awareness and Education (recognizing the need for buildings and settlements to educate occupants).

===LEED 2014===

For LEED BD+C v4 credit, the IEQ category addresses [[Thermal comfort|thermal]], visual, and acoustic comfort as well as [[indoor air quality]]. The [[thermal comfort]] credit applies one point to the following certification types: New Construction, Schools, Retail, Data Centers, Warehouses and Distribution Centers, Hospitality, and Healthcare. The intent of this credit is to "promote occupants' productivity, comfort, and well-being by providing thermal comfort."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title = LEED v4 Reference Guide for Building Design and Construction|publisher = USGBC|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Washington, DC|pages = 695–710}}&lt;/ref&gt; Occupants' satisfaction and performance is directly affected by a building's thermal conditions as shown by laboratory and field research.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Estimates of Potential Nationwide Productivity and Health Benefits from Better Indoor Environments: An Update|last = Fisk|first = W|journal = Indoor Air Quality Handbook|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 2001|location = New York|edition = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Energy reduction goals can be supported while improving thermal satisfaction.

===LEED Canada===
In 2003, the [[Canada Green Building Council]] received permission to create LEED Canada-NC v1.0, which was based upon LEED-NC 2.0.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cagbc.org/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125091733/http://www.cagbc.org/ |archivedate=2015-11-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cagbc.org/cagbcdocs/LEED_Canada_NC-Comparison-2009_to_v1_100621.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-21 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150922212340/http://www.cagbc.org/cagbcdocs/LEED_Canada_NC-Comparison-2009_to_v1_100621.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many buildings in Canada are LEED certified in part due to their [[Rainwater harvesting in Canada|Rainwater harvesting]] practices.

===Process===
LEED certification is granted by the [[Green Building Certification Institute]] (GBCI), which handles the third-party verification of a project's compliance with the LEED requirements.

The certification process for design teams is made up of two consecutive applications: one including design credits, and one including construction credits.  All of the LEED credits in each rating system are assigned to either the design application or the construction application.  The design credits include those that are the purview of the architect and the engineer, and are documented in the official construction drawings.  The construction credits include those that are predominantly under the purview of the contractor, and are documented during the construction and commissioning of the building.

A fee is required to register the building, and to submit the design and construction applications.  Total fees are assessed based on building area. Fees range from a minimum of $2,900 to over $1 million for a large project.&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, Timothy. (2011-01-01) [http://hpac.com/archive/true-cost-leed-certified-green-buildings The True Cost of LEED-Certified Green Buildings | Archive content from HPAC Engineering] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140302053937/http://hpac.com/archive/true-cost-leed-certified-green-buildings |date=2014-03-02 }}. Hpac.com. Retrieved on 2014-06-23.&lt;/ref&gt; "Soft" costs, i.e., added costs to the building project to qualify for LEED certification, range from 1% to 6% of the total project cost. The average cost increase was about 2%, or an extra $3–$5 per square foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.josre.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cost_of_LEED_Analysis_of_Construction_Costs-JOSRE_v3-131.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130626081947/http://www.josre.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/09/Cost_of_LEED_Analysis_of_Construction_Costs-JOSRE_v3-131.pdf |archivedate=2013-06-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The application review and certification process is handled on LEED Online, USGBC's web-based service that employs a series of active PDF forms to allow project teams to fill out credit forms and upload supporting documentation online.  The GBCI also utilizes LEED Online to conduct their reviews.

===LEED energy modeling===
Design teams have the option of achieving points under the Optimize Energy Performance credit by building an energy model.  This energy model must follow the modeling methodologies outlined in Appendix G of the [[ASHRAE 90.1]] building energy standard.  The guidelines in Appendix G require that the team make two energy models: one representing the building as designed, and a second “baseline” building.  The baseline building must be modeled in the same location, and have the same geometry and occupancy as the design building.  Depending on location (climate) and building size, the standard provides requirements for HVAC system type, and wall and window definitions.  The goal of this methodology is to provide a baseline building to use as a reference point to compare the design building against. It is a way to standardize the baseline, while putting weight on important factors that heavily influence building energy consumption (e.g., location, geometry, and occupancy patterns).  The number of points achieved in this credit is correlated with the percent predicted energy cost savings demonstrated by the difference between the design and baseline energy models.

This method of energy modeling has been criticized for inaccurately predicting actual energy usage of LEED-certified buildings. The USGBC admits that "current information indicates that most buildings do not perform as well as design metrics indicate. As a result, building owners might not obtain the benefits promised."&lt;ref name="http"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs3402.pdf|title=A National Green Building Research Agenda|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131212220808/http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs3402.pdf|archivedate=2013-12-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LEED for Homes Rating System===
Today, increasing demand towards environmental safety forces LEED certification to play major role. The process of the LEED for Homes Rating System, available in the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=147 |title=LEED rating systems &amp;#124; U.S. Green Building Council |publisher=Usgbc.org |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131016083800/http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=147 |archivedate=2013-10-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Canada and Sweden,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.exengo.se/miljocertifiering/ LEED] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150315232649/http://www.exengo.se/miljocertifiering/ |date=2015-03-15 }} Retrieved 16-03-2015. {{sv}}&lt;/ref&gt; is significantly different from the LEED NC rating system. LEED for Homes projects are low rise residential and are required to work with either an American Provider Organization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1554 |title=U.S. Green Building Council &amp;#124; U.S. Green Building Council |publisher=Usgbc.org |accessdate=2013-10-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130312203744/http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1554 |archivedate=2013-03-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or a Canadian Provider Organization&lt;ref name="cagbc1"&gt;[http://www.cagbc.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Programs/LEED/RatingSystems/Homes/default.htm#providers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120130090848/http://www.cagbc.org/Content/NavigationMenu/Programs/LEED/RatingSystems/Homes/default.htm#providers|date=January 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Green Rater. A Provider Organization helps the project through the process while overseeing the Green Raters. Green Raters are individuals that conduct the two mandatory LEED for Homes site inspections; the Thermal Bypass Inspection and the Final Inspection. Although LEED for Homes is typically viewed by the construction industry as a simpler rating system, especially when compared to LEED NC, LEED NC does not require an on-site inspection. The Provider and the Green Rater do not certify the project, but rather assist in the certification process.

==LEED Performance==
Research papers provide most of what is known about the performance and effectiveness of LEED in two credit category areas – energy and indoor environment quality.  In one study of 953 NYC office buildings, 21 LEED certified buildings collectively showed no energy savings compared with non-LEED buildings, although LEED Gold buildings "outperformed other NYC office buildings by 20%".&lt;ref name=2013scofield /&gt;  IEQ-related studies provide two contrasting results - the first used occupant survey results in 65 LEED buildings and 79 non-LEED buildings and it concluded that occupants of LEED certified buildings have equal satisfaction with the building overall and with the workspace than occupants of non-LEED rated buildings&lt;ref name=Schiavon /&gt; and the second used occupant interviews and physical site measurements at 12 LEED buildings to report superior indoor environment performance compared with similar 12 conventional buildings (non-LEED).&lt;ref name=Newsham /&gt; Buildings certified under LEED do not have to prove energy or water efficiency in practice to receive LEED certification points, but instead LEED uses modeling software to predict future energy use based on intended use. This has led to criticism of LEED’s ability to accurately determine the efficiency of buildings. The USGBC itself says that, “Buildings have a poor track record for performing as predicted during design.&lt;ref name="http"/&gt;

===Energy performance research===
In 2009 Newsham et al. analyzed a database of 100 LEED certified (v3 or earlier version) buildings.&lt;ref name="newsham09"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newsham |first=Guy R. |last2=Mancini |first2=Sandra |last3=Birt J. |first3=Benjamin |title=Do LEED-certified buildings save energy? Yes, but… |journal= Energy and Buildings |volume=41 |issue=8 |year=2009 |pages= 897–905 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778809000693 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.03.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this study, each building was paired with a conventional "twin" building within the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) database according to building type and occupancy.&lt;ref name="newsham09" /&gt;  On average, LEED buildings consumed 18 to 39% less energy per floor area than their conventional "twin" buildings, although 28 to 35% of LEED-certified buildings used more energy than their "twin.”&lt;ref name="newsham09" /&gt;  The paper found no correlation between the number of energy points achieved or LEED certification level and measured building performance.&lt;ref name="newsham09" /&gt;

In 2009 Scofield published an article in response to Newsham et al., analyzing the same database of LEED buildings and arriving at different conclusions.&lt;ref name="2009scofield"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Scofield  | first = John H.  | title = Do LEED-certified buildings save energy? Not really..  | journal = Energy and Buildings  | volume = 41  | pages = 1386–1390  | year = 2009  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877880900187X  | doi = 10.1016/j.enbuild.2009.08.006  | issue = 12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his analysis, Scofield criticized that Newsham et al.'s study only considered the energy per floor area instead of a total energy consumption. Scofield considered [http://www.energystar.gov/buildings/facility-owners-and-managers/existing-buildings/use-portfolio-manager/understand-metrics/difference source energy] (accounting for energy losses during generation and transmission) as well as [[Primary energy#Site and source energy|site energy]], and used area-weighted energy use intensities, or EUIs (energy per unit area per year), when comparing LEED and non-LEED buildings to account for the fact that larger buildings tend to have larger EUIs.&lt;ref name="2009scofield" /&gt;  Scofield concluded that, collectively, the LEED-certified buildings showed no significant source energy consumption savings or greenhouse gas emission reductions when compared to non-LEED buildings, although they did consume 10-17% less site energy.&lt;ref name="2009scofield" /&gt;

Scofield in 2013 analyzed 21 LEED-certified buildings in New York City.&lt;ref name="2013scofield"&gt;{{cite journal  | last = Scofield  | first = John H.  | title = Efficacy of LEED-certification in reducing energy consumption and greenhouse gas emission for large New York City office buildings  | journal = Energy and Buildings  | volume = 67  | pages = 517–524  | year = 2013  | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S037877881300529X  | doi = 10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.08.032 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that buildings that had achieved LEED Gold used, on average, 20% less source energy than did conventional buildings.  Buildings with LEED Silver or LEED Certified ratings actually used 11 to 15% more source energy, on average, than did their conventional counterparts.&lt;ref name="2013scofield" /&gt;

In 2014, Fuertes and Schiavon&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Plug Load Energy Analysis: The Role of Plug Loads in LEED Certification|url = http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8fs0k03g?query=Schiavon%2520Fuertes|website = eScholarship|accessdate = 2015-11-23|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151124145752/http://escholarship.org/uc/item/8fs0k03g?query=Schiavon%2520Fuertes|archivedate = 2015-11-24|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; developed the first study that analyzes plug loads using LEED documented data from certified projects. The study compared [[plug load]] assumptions made by 92 [[Energy Modeling Forum|energy modeling]] practitioners against [[ASHRAE Handbook|ASHRAE]] and [[Title 24 (California code)|Title 24]] requirements, as well as the evaluation of the plug loads calculation methodology used by 660 [http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs5543.pdf LEED-CI] and 429 [http://www.usgbc.org/Docs/Archive/General/Docs5546.pdf LEED-NC] certified projects. In general, energy modelers considered the energy consumption of plug loads of equipment that are constantly running (such as refrigerators) as well as monitors and computers predictable. Overall the results suggested a disconnection between energy modelers assumptions and the actual performance of buildings. In conclusion, the study suggests LEED or ASHRAE to develop guidelines for plug loads calculations.

Energy model might be a source of error during LEED design phase. Stoppel and Leite&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Evaluating building energy model performance of LEED buildings: Identifying potential sources of error through aggregate analysis|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378778813002521|journal = Energy and Buildings|date = 2013-10-01|pages = 185–196|volume = 65|doi = 10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.04.016|first = Christopher.

The study’s results suggests that mechanical systems turnover and occupancy assumptions significantly differing from predicted to actual values.

Most of the current available energy consumption analysis of LEED buildings focuses on LEED v3 (2009) or even earlier versions certified buildings instead of the newest LEED v4 (2014) certified buildings. According to Newsham et al., these analyses should be considered as preliminary and should be repeated with longer data history and larger sample buildings,&lt;ref name="newsham09" /&gt; including new LEED v4 certified buildings. Newsham et al. also pointed out that further work needs to be done to define green building rating schemes to ensure more consistent and substantial energy consumption reduction success at the individual building level in long term.&lt;ref name="newsham09" /&gt;

===IEQ performance research===
The [[Center for Disease Control]] defines Indoor Environmental Quality (IEQ) as "the quality of a building’s environment in relation to the health and wellbeing of those who occupy space within it."&lt;ref name=CDC&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/ |title=Workplace Safety and Health Topics, Indoor Environment Quality |publisher=CDC |website=Center for Disease Control Main Website |accessdate=23 November 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131203030020/http://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/indoorenv/ |archivedate=3 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The USGBC includes the following considerations for attaining IEQ credits: [[indoor air quality]], the level of [[volatile organic compounds]], lighting, [[thermal comfort]], and [[daylighting]] and views.  In consideration of a building's indoor environmental quality, published studies have also included factors such as: acoustics, building cleanliness and maintenance, colors and textures, workstation size, ceiling height, window access and shading, surface finishes, and furniture adjustability and comfort.&lt;ref name=Schiavon /&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsham /&gt;

In 2013, a paper published by S. Schiavon and S. Altomonte studied LEED verses non-LEED buildings in relation to occupant IEQ satisfaction.&lt;ref name=Schiavon&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schiavon |first=Stefano |last2=Altomonte |first2=Sergio |year=2013 |title=Occupant satisfaction in LEED and non-LEED certified buildings |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132313001868 |journal=Buildings and Environment |volume=68 | pages=66–76 |doi=10.1016/j.buildenv.2013.06.008|accessdate=23 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Using occupant surveys from the [http://www.cbe.berkeley.edu/research/survey.htm Center for the Built Environment] at Berkeley database,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Quantitative relationships between occupant satisfaction and satisfaction aspects of indoor environmental quality and building design|url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00745.x/abstract|journal = Indoor Air|date = 2012-04-01|issn = 1600-0668|pages = 119–131|volume = 22|issue = 2|doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0668.2011.00745.x|first = M.|last = Frontczak|first2 = S.|last2 = Schiavon|first3 = J.|last3 = Goins|first4 = E.|last4 = Arens|first5 = H.|last5 = Zhang|first6 = P.|last6 = Wargocki}}&lt;/ref&gt; 65 LEED-certified and 79 non-LEED buildings were studied to provide an analysis of 15 IEQ-related factors in the overall building and specific workspaces. These factors include the ease of interaction, building cleanliness, the comfort of furnishing, the amount of light, building maintenance, colors and textures, workplace cleanliness, the amount of space, furniture adjustability, visual comfort, air quality, visual privacy, noise, temperature, and sound privacy. The results showed occupants tend to be slightly more satisfied in LEED buildings for the air quality and slightly more dissatisfied with the amount of light. The overall finding was that there was no significant influence of LEED certification on occupant satisfaction in consideration of the overall building and workspace ratings.&lt;ref name=Schiavon /&gt;  The "Limitations and Further Studies" section states that the data may not be representative of the entire building stock and a randomized approach was not used in the data assessment.

Based on similar dataset (21,477 occupants), in 2013, Schiavon and Altomonte,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Influence of factors unrelated to environmental quality on occupant satisfaction in LEED and non-LEED certified buildings|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360132314000882|journal = Building and Environment|date = 2014-07-01|pages = 148–159|volume = 77|doi = 10.1016/j.buildenv.2014.03.028|first = Stefano|last = Schiavon|first2 = Sergio|last2 = Altomonte}}&lt;/ref&gt; found that occupants have equivalent satisfaction levels in LEED and non-LEED buildings when evaluated independently from the following nine factors: (1) office type, (2) spatial layout, (3) distance from windows, (4) building size, (5) gender, (6) age, (7) type of work, (8) time at workspace, and (9) weekly working hours. LEED certified buildings may provide higher satisfaction in open spaces than in enclosed offices, in smaller buildings than in larger buildings, and to occupants having spent less than one year in their workspaces rather than to those who have used their workspace longer. The study also points out that the positive value of LEED certification from the aspect of occupant satisfaction may tend to decrease with time.

In 2015, a study on indoor environmental quality and the potential health benefits of green certified buildings was developed by Allen et al.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Green Buildings and Health|url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40572-015-0063-y|journal = Current Environmental Health Reports|date = 2015-07-10|issn = 2196-5412|pmc = 4513229|pmid = 26231502|pages = 250–258|volume = 2|issue = 3|doi = 10.1007/s40572-015-0063-y|first = Joseph G.|last = Allen|first2 = Piers|last2 = MacNaughton|first3 = Jose Guillermo Cedeno|last3 = Laurent|first4 = Skye S.|last4 = Flanigan|first5 = Erika Sita|last5 = Eitland|first6 = John D.|last6 = Spengler}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing that green buildings provide better indoor environmental quality with direct benefits to human health of occupants of those buildings in comparison to non-green buildings. One of the limitations of the study was the use of subjective health performance indicators since there is a lack of definition on such indicators by current studies.

G. Newsham et al. published a detailed study on IEQ and LEED buildings in August 2013.&lt;ref name="Newsham"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Newsham |first=Guy R. |last2=Birt |first2=Benjamin J. |last3=Arsenault |first3=Chantal |last4=Thompson |first4=Alexandra J.L. |last5=Veitch |first5=Jennifer A. |last6=Mancini |first6=Sandra |last7=Galasiu |first7=Anca D. |last8=Gover |first8=Bradford N. |last9=Macdonald |first9=lain A. |last10=Burns |first10=Gregory J. |year=2013 |title=Do 'green' buildings have better indoor environments?

On-site, 974 workstations were measured for thermal conditions, air quality, acoustics, lighting, workstation size, ceiling height, window access and shading, and surface finishes.  Responses were positive in the areas of environmental satisfaction, satisfaction with thermal conditions, satisfaction with view from the outside, aesthetic appearance, reduced disturbance from heating, ventilation and air-conditioning noise, workplace image, night-time sleep quality, mood, physical symptoms, and reduced number of airborne particulates.  The results showed green buildings exhibited superior performance compared with similar conventional buildings.&lt;ref name="Newsham" /&gt;

Current latest study published in 2017, by Altomonte, Schiavon, Kent and Brager, specifically investigated whether a green rating leads to higher occupant satisfaction with IEQ.&lt;ref name=latest&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Altomonte|first1=Sergio|last2=Schiavon|first2=Stefano|last3=Kent|first3=Michael G.|last4=Brager|first4=Gail|title=Indoor environmental quality and occupant satisfaction in green-certified buildings|journal=Building Research &amp; Information|date=1 November 2017|volume=0|issue=0|pages=1–20|doi=10.1080/09613218.2018.1383715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the analysis of a subset of the CBE Occupant IEQ including 11,243 responses from 93 LEED-certified office buildings, this study found that the achievement of a specific IEQ credit did not substantially increase the satisfaction with the corresponding IEQ factor. In addition, the rating level and version of the certification has no impact on workplace satisfaction. There are some possible explanations. Many intervening factors in the time between design and occupancy can alter the existence or performance of the strategies that LEED awarded. IEQ certification metrics also face the challenges from substantial differences that characterize the modern workplace in terms of spatial needs, task requirements, users’ characteristics, and disciplines of product design and marketing, etc. Survey participants may also misinterpret the satisfaction with an IEQ parameter, or bias with personal attitudes.&lt;ref name=latest /&gt;

The [[daylight]] credit was updated in LEED v4 to include a simulation option for daylight analysis that uses Spatial Daylight Autonomy ([[Daylighting#LEED documentation|SDA]]) and Annual Sunlight Exposure ([[Daylighting#LEED documentation|ASE]]) metrics to evaluate daylight quality in LEED projects. SDA is a metric that measures the annual sufficiency of daylight levels in interior spaces and ASE describes the potential for visual discomfort by direct sunlight and glare. These metrics are approved by [[Illuminating Engineering Society of North America|IES]] and described at the LM-83-12 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = IES - Illuminating Engineering Society|url = http://www.ies.org/store/product/approved-method-ies-spatial-daylight-autonomy-sda-and-annual-sunlight-exposure-ase-1287.cfm|website = www.ies.org|accessdate = 2015-11-17|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151117082519/http://www.ies.org/store/product/approved-method-ies-spatial-daylight-autonomy-sda-and-annual-sunlight-exposure-ase-1287.cfm|archivedate = 2015-11-17|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; LEED recommend a minimum of 300 [[lux]] for at least 50% of total occupied hours of the year for 55% or more square meters (square feet) of the floor occupied area. The threshold recommended by LEED for ASE is that no more than 10% of regularly occupied floor area can be exposed to more than 1000 lux of direct sunlight for more than 250 hours per year. Additionally, LEED requires window shades to be closed when more than 2% of a space is subject to direct sunlight above 1000 lux. According to Reinhart&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Opinion: Climate-based daylighting metrics in LEEDv4 – A fragile progress|url = http://lrt.sagepub.com/content/47/4/388|journal = Lighting Research and Technology|date = 2015-06-01|issn = 1477-1535|pages = 388–388|volume = 47|issue = 4|doi = 10.1177/1477153515587613|first = Christoph|last = Reinhart|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160114171952/http://lrt.sagepub.com/content/47/4/388|archivedate = 2016-01-14|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the direct sunlight requirement is a very stringent approach that can disable good daylight design from achieving this credit. Reinhart propose the application of the direct sunlight criterion only in spaces that require stringent control of sunlight (e.g. desks, white boards and etc.).

A 2003 analysis of the savings from green building found from a review of 60 LEED buildings that the buildings were, on average, 25-30% more energy efficient. However, it also attributed substantial benefits to the increased productivity from the better ventilation, temperature control, lighting control, and reduced [[indoor air pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first = Greg|last = Kats|authorlink = Greg Kats|year = 2003|url = http://staging.community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/paper-kats.pdf|format = PDF|title = Green building costs and financial benefits|publisher = Massachusetts Technology Collaborative|deadurl = no|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20151122080148/http://staging.community-wealth.org/sites/clone.community-wealth.org/files/downloads/paper-kats.pdf|archivedate = 2015-11-22|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2008, LEED (and similar [[Energy Star]]) buildings had mostly been evaluated by case studies. From a purely financial perspective, in 2008 several studies found that LEED for-rent office spaces generally charged higher rent and had higher occupancy rates. CoStar collects data on properties. The extra cost for the minimum benefit has been estimated at 3%, with an additional 2.5% for silver.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1 = N. Miller|author2 = J. Spivey|author3 = A.

LEED focuses on the design of the building and not on its actual energy consumption, and therefore it has suggested that LEED buildings should be tracked to discover whether the potential energy savings from the design are being used in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Appelbaum |first=A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/20/opinion/20Appelbaum.html?scp=1&amp;sq=don%E2%80%99t%20LEED%20us%20astray&amp;scse |title=Don't LEED Us Astray |newspaper= New York Times |date=2010-05-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Professional accreditation==
The Green Building Certification Institute describes Professional Accreditation as follows: "LEED Professional Credentials demonstrate current knowledge of green building technologies, best practices, and the rapidly evolving LEED Rating Systems. They show differentiation in a growing and competitive industry, and they allow for varied levels of specialization. A LEED Professional Credential provides employers, policymakers, and other stakeholders with assurances of an individual's level of competence and is the mark of the most qualified, educated, and influential green building professionals in the marketplace."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gbci.org/main-nav/professional-credentials/credentials.aspx |title=LEED Professional Credentials |publisher=GBCI |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826130545/http://www.gbci.org/main-nav/professional-credentials/credentials.aspx |archivedate=2012-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Credentials include the LEED Green Associate and the various types of specialized LEED Accredited Professionals (AP).

==Benefits and disadvantages==
[[File:Eco-indulgent apartments.jpg|thumb|[[Real estate developers]] have begun to use LEED certification and a building's green status as selling points]]

LEED certified buildings are intended to use resources more efficiently when compared to conventional buildings simply built to code. However, analysis of energy and water use data from New York City shows that LEED certification does not necessarily make a building more energy or water efficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/|title=Green Building LEED Certification|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=2013-12-08|date=2012-10-24|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128203601/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/|archivedate=2013-11-28|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often, when a LEED rating is pursued, the cost of initial design and construction rises. There may be a lack of abundant availability of manufactured building components that meet LEED specifications. Pursuing LEED certification for a project is an added cost in itself as well. This added cost comes in the form of USGBC correspondence, LEED design-aide consultants, and the hiring of the required [[Building commissioning|Commissioning Authority]] (CxA)—all of which would not necessarily be included in an environmentally responsible project, unless it also sought a LEED rating.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

However, these higher initial costs can be effectively mitigated by the savings incurred over time due to the lower-than-industry-standard operational costs typical of a LEED certified building. This [[Whole-life cost|Life cycle costing]] is a method for assessing the total cost of ownership, taking into account all costs of acquiring, owning and operating, and the eventual disposal of a building.  Additional economic payback may come in the form of employee productivity gains incurred as a result of working in a healthier environment.

LEED is a design tool and not a performance measurement tool. It is also not yet climate-specific, although the newest version hopes to address this weakness partially. Because of this, designers may make materials or design choices that garner a LEED point, even though they may not be the most site- or climate-appropriate choice available. On top of this, LEED is also not energy-specific. Since it only measures the overall performances, builders are free to choose how to achieve points under various categories. A ''USA Today'' review showed that 7,100 certified commercial building projects targeted easy and cheap green points, such as creating healthy spaces and providing educational displays in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=In U.S. building industry, is it too easy to be green? | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/ | work=USA Today | date=2012-10-24 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131128203601/http://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2012/10/24/green-building-leed-certification/1650517/ | archivedate=2013-11-28 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Few builders would really adopt renewable energy because the generators for those energy resources, such as solar [[photovoltaic]], are costly. Builders game the rating system and use certain performances to compensate for the others, making energy conservation the weakest part in the overall evaluation.

LEED is a measurement tool for [[green building]] in the [[United States]] and it is developed and continuously modified by workers in the green building industry, especially in the ten largest metro areas in the U.S.; however, LEED certified buildings have been slower to penetrate small and mid-major markets.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news|url=http://www.costar.com/News/Article.aspx?id=652024CBB8139C748C5F6F871CD4EF6B|title=LEED's Big Market Bias|publisher=CoStar Group|accessdate=2008-04-27|last=Burr|first=Andrew C.|date=April 23, 2008|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081230084702/http://www.costar.com/News/Article.aspx?id=652024CBB8139C748C5F6F871CD4EF6B|archivedate=December 30, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some criticism suggests that the LEED rating system is not sensitive and does not vary enough with regard to local environmental conditions. For instance, a building in [[Maine]] would receive the same credit as a building in [[Arizona]] for water conservation, though the principle is more important in the latter case. Another complaint is that its certification costs require money that could be used to make the building in question even more sustainable. Many critics have noted that compliance and certification costs have grown faster than staff support from the USGBC.

For existing buildings LEED has developed LEED-EB. Research has demonstrated that buildings that can achieve LEED-EB equivalencies can generate a tremendous ROI{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. In a 2008 white paper by the Leonardo Academy comparing LEED-EB buildings vs. data from BOMA's Experience Exchange Report 2007 demonstrated LEED-EB certified buildings achieved superior operating cost savings in 63% of the buildings surveyed ranging from $4.94 to $15.59 per square foot of floor space, with an average valuation of $6.68 and a median valuation of $6.07.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.leonardoacademy.org/download/Economics%20of%20LEED-EB%2020090222.pdf |title=Cost Analysis of LEED-EB |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-02-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120330221114/http://www.leonardoacademy.org/download/Economics%20of%20LEED-EB%2020090222.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition the overall cost of LEED-EB implementation and certification ranged from $0.00 to $6.46 per square
foot of floor space, with an average of $2.43 per square foot demonstrating that implementation is not expensive, especially in comparison to cost savings. These costs should be significantly reduced if automation and technology are integrated into the implementation.

==Incentive programs==
Many federal, state, and local governments and school districts have adopted various types of LEED initiatives and incentives. A full listing of government and school LEED initiatives can be found online&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title= Tax Deductions and Incentives.

Some areas have implemented or are considering incentives for LEED-certified buildings.

The city of [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] adopted a measure providing an automatic 100% real property tax exemption of the assessed property value for newly constructed or rehabilitated commercial or residential properties that earn a minimum of LEED Certified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=LEED Initiatives in Government and Schools| url=http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1852| deadurl=no| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216114726/http://www.usgbc.org/DisplayPage.aspx?CMSPageID=1852| archivedate=2009-02-16| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the state of [[Nevada]], construction materials for a qualifying LEED building are exempt from local taxes. Pieces of construction that are deemed "inseparable" parts, such as [[concrete]] or [[drywall]], qualify.

The state of [[Maryland]] passed its High Performance Buildings Act in 2008, requiring all new public construction and renovation of buildings greater than 7,500 square feet to meet at least the LEED Silver standard, or two Green Globes. Between 2009 and 2014, the state is required to fund half of the required additional cost for public school construction or renovation to attain that standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.c2es.org/us-states-regions/news/2008/maryland-enacts-green-building-standards-public-buildings |title=Maryland Enacts Green Building Standards for Public Buildings &amp;#124; Center for Climate and Energy Solutions |publisher=C2es.org |date=2008-04-24 |accessdate=2013-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103114407/http://www.c2es.org/us-states-regions/news/2008/maryland-enacts-green-building-standards-public-buildings |archivedate=2013-11-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, [[Auden Schendler]] and Randy Udall, respectively a LEED-accredited professional who is the director of environmental affairs at the Aspen Skiing Company and a Colorado-based environmentalist, published an article titled "LEED is Broken; Let's Fix It", in which they criticized numerous aspects of the LEED certification process, which they characterized as "costly, slow, brutal, confusing, and unwieldy ... that makes green building more difficult than it needs to be..."&lt;ref&gt;Schendler and Udall quoted in Owen, p.224&lt;/ref&gt;  Schendler and Udall also identify an environmentalist fallacy which they call "LEED brain", in which the public relations value of LEED certification begins to drive the development of buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Schendler and Udall quoted in Owen, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[David Owen]], in his book ''Green Metropolis'' give as an example of "LEED brain" the building by [[Gap Inc.]] of a green showcase building in [[San Bruno, California]] that, in itself, was a paradigm of environmentally-friendliness, but by its location, 16 miles from the company's corporate headquarters in downtown [[San Francisco]], and 15 miles from Gap's corporate campus in [[Mission Bay (San Francisco)|Mission Bay]], was actually harmful to the environment by forcing Gap employees to drive more miles, and the addition of shuttle buses between the various buildings.  Owen points out that "no bus is as green as an elevator."&lt;ref&gt;Owen, pp.232-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Walkable City'', city planner Jeff Speck provides another example of "LEED brain": the federal [[United States Environmental Protection Agency|Environmental Protection Agency]] relocated its Region 7 Headquarters from downtown [[Kansas City, Missouri]], to a LEED-certified building 20 miles away in the suburb of [[Lenexa, Kansas]], causing many of the agency's 627 employees to drive additional miles to and from work.  Kaid Benfield of the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] estimated that the carbon emissions associated with the additional miles driven were almost three times higher than before, a change from 0.39 metric tons per person per month to 1.08 metric tons of carbon dioxide per person per month.  Speck writes that "The carbon saved by the new building's LEED status, if any, will be a small fraction of the carbon wasted by its location."&lt;ref name=speck&gt;Speck, Jeff (2012) ''Walkable City: How Downtown Can Save America, One Step at a Time'' New York: North Point Press. pp.55-59. {{ISBN|978-0-86547-772-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Speck and Owen make the point that a building-centric standard such as LEED, which doesn't sufficiently account for the location in which the building stands, will inevitably undervalue the strong positive effect of people living together in cities, which are inherently environmentally efficient, especially when compared to the automobile-oriented sprawl.&lt;ref name=speck /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen, pp.221-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Leela Förderkreis e.V. and Others v. Germany''''' (application No. 58911/00) was a case decided by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] in 2008.

==Facts==

The applicants were religious or meditation associations belonging to the [[Osho (Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh)|Osho]] movement. As part of their public relations work, State agencies have characterised these associations as a "sect", "youth sect", "youth religion" and "psycho-sect". The adjectives "destructive" and "pseudo-religious" have also been used to describe them, and the accusation has been raised that their members are manipulated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=842891&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR judgment in case No. 58911/00] (Paras. 6-10)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|Federal Constitutional Court]], after more than 11 years of consideration, decided that the use of the expressions "destructive", and "pseudo-religious" on the associations, and the allegation that they "manipulated their members", did not satisfy the requirements of constitutional law. However, it found that the Government was authorised to characterise the applicant associations’ movement as a "sect", "youth religion", "youth sect" and "psycho-sect" and was allowed to provide the public with adequate information about it.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=842891&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR judgment in case No. 58911/00] (Paras. 19-27)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judgment==
The Court held that the length of the proceedings was excessive and failed to meet the "reasonable time" requirement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=842891&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR judgment in case No. 58911/00] (Paras. 66)&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore it has found a breach of Article 6 § 1 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] (rights to fair trial), unanimously.

Concerning allegations of violating Article 9 (freedom of thought, conscience and religion), the Court held that "the Government's statements as delimited by the Federal Constitutional Court, at least at the time they were made, did not entail overstepping the bounds of what a democratic State may regard as the public interest."&lt;ref&gt;[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=842891&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 ECtHR judgment in case No. 58911/00] (Paras. 100)&lt;/ref&gt;

Two judges, [[Mirjana Lazarova Trajkovska|Trajkovska]] and Kalaydjieva, filed partially dissenting opinions, considering that Article 9 was violated (Kalaydjieva saw also Article 14 as violated).

'''Mohamed et al. v. Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.''', is a case brought by the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) on behalf of five victims of [[Extraordinary rendition by the United States|extraordinary rendition]]s against [[Jeppesen|Jeppesen Dataplan, Inc.]], which had provided services that the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) used to perform renditions.

==Background==
According to an article that appeared in October 2006 in ''[[The New Yorker]]'', the CIA is a Jeppesen customer. The article claims that the company has provided navigational and logistics support to the agency's extraordinary rendition program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

|date=October 30, 2006
|accessdate=February 2, 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article says Jeppesen provided "flight plans, clearance to fly over other countries, hotel reservations, and ground-crew arrangements" to the CIA. According to the article, an unnamed former employee quoted Bob Overby, Jeppesen's managing director, as saying at a meeting, "We do all of the extraordinary renditions flights—you know, the torture flights. ... Let's face it, some of those flights end up that way... It certainly pays well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On November 16, 2006, [[Amnesty International]] staged a demonstration in front of the company's International Trip and Flight Planning Office in [[San Jose, California]] to protest their involvement in the rendition program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/events/western/11172006grp35_highlight.html Demonstration at Jeppesen Corporation in San Jose, California]. Amnesty International. November 17, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2006 representatives of the South Bay Mobilization for Peace and Justice group asked the San Jose City Council to remove a Jeppesen banner from a city skating rink. The group also holds a weekly vigil at the company's offices.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.metroactive.com/metro/12.13.06/fly-0650.html Silicon Valley News Notes: Icecapade]. Metro Newspapers. December 13, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ACLU lawsuit==

On May 30, 2007, the ACLU sued Jeppesen on behalf of five [[plaintiff]]s who had been tortured in [[Morocco]], [[Egypt]] and a United States base in [[Afghanistan]]. The suit alleged that, since 2001, Jeppesen provided support for at least seventy flights for the CIA's secret extraordinary rendition program, transporting prisoners overseas to be tortured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

On May 16, 2011, the Supreme Court declined to review the decision of the Ninth Circuit to dismiss the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Order List 563 U.S. |url=https://www.supremecourt.gov/orders/courtorders/051611zor.pdf |date=May 16, 2011 |accessdate=May 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Multistakeholder participation is a specific [[governance]] approach whereby relevant stakeholders participate in the collective shaping of evolutions and uses of the [[Internet]].

In 2005, the [[Working Group on Internet Governance|Working Group in Internet Governance]] (WGIG), set up by the [[World Summit on the Information Society]] (WSIS), defined [[Internet governance]] as: ‘development and application by [[Government]]s, the [[private sector]] and [[civil society]], in their respective roles, of shared principles, [[Social norm|norms]], rules, decision-making procedures, and programs that shape the evolution and use of the [[Internet]]’. This is not identical to undifferentiated [[public participation]] in [[Internet]] issues. Instead, the  concept of ‘multistakeholder’ signals specifically the distinct clusters of interests involved in any given digital issue and how these interests can be aggregated into decisions towards an [[Internet]] for the [[Common good|general interest]], rather than being captured by a single [[Power center (geometry)|power center]].

The general principle of participation in [[decision-making]] that impacts on the lives of [[individual]]s has been part of the [[Internet]] from its outset, accounting for much of its success.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=What if we all governed the Internet? Advancing multistakeholder participation in Internet governance|last=van der Spuy|first=Anri|publisher=UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=259867&amp;set=0059FC3395_0_81&amp;database=ged&amp;gp=0&amp;lin=1&amp;ll=f|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It recognizes the value of multistakeholder participation, incorporating [[User (computing)|users]] and a user-centric perspective as well as all other actors critical to developing, using and [[Governance|governing]] the [[Internet]] across a range of levels. The other principles are enriched by the [[Multistakeholder governance model|multistakeholder participation]] principle, because it states that everyone should have a stake in the future of the [[Internet]].

It is possible to define a number of broad categories of stakeholders in the [[Internet]], with [[subgroup]]s as well: State, [[business]]es and [[Industry|industries]], [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental actors]], [[civil society]], [[Intergovernmental organization|international governmental organization]], [[Research|research actors]], [[individual]]s, and others. Each of these categories has more or less unique stakes in the future of the [[Internet]], but there are also areas of great overlap and [[interdependence]]. For instance, some [[Non-governmental organization|NGOs]], are likely to prioritize the promotion of [[human rights]]; meanwhile [[parliament]]s are primary actors in defining [[law]]s to protect these rights. Still other stakeholders are key to shaping [[Human rights and encryption|rights online]], such as [[Search engine|search engine providers]], and [[Internet service provider|Internet Service Providers]] (ISPs).&lt;ref&gt;MacKinnon, R., Hickok, E., Bar, A., and Lim, Hae-in (2015), Fostering Freedom of Expression Online: The Role of Internet Intermediaries.

== Internet governance ==

=== Internet governance ===
{{Main|Internet governance}}

Internet governance is the development and application of shared [[principle]]s, [[Norms (sociology)|norms]], rules, decision-making procedures, and programs that shape the evolution and use of the [[Internet]]. Internet governance should not be confused with [[e-governance]], which refers to [[government]]s' use of technology to carry out their governing duties. Although some argue that Internet governance ‘as a unitary regime may in fact be an impossibility’,&lt;ref&gt;MacLean, 2004:80; Mansell &amp; Raboy, 2011:10; Mathiason, 2009:17.&lt;/ref&gt; a broader [[concept]]ualisation of [[governance]] recognises both the entirety and the diversity of [[governance]] activities that steer the “ship”.

The Tunis Agenda for the Information Society,&lt;ref&gt;WSIS, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; defines [[Internet governance|Internet Governance]] as: "the development and application by [[government]]s, the [[private sector]] and [[civil society]], in their respective roles, of shared [[principle]]s, [[Social norm|norms]], rules, decision-making procedures, and programmes that shape the evolution and use of the Internet."

=== Specificity ===
It is often argued that multistakeholder participation is better, at least in principle, ‘than [[governance]] by [[government]]s alone’, as it can uphold the interests of non-elected actors in relation to [[government]]s (most of which are elected, although others not). In addition, governments may lack the necessary competence and/or adequate [[Politics|political]] will in relation to expert and [[Benignity|benign]] [[Internet governance]].&lt;ref name="Souter, 2017a"&gt;Souter, 2017a.&lt;/ref&gt; Multistakeholder participation more broadly can be posited as a way to prevent capture of the [[Internet]] by one constituency to the expense of another – whether this is capture by various state actors and their interstate organizations, or by [[private sector]] interests [[nation]]ally or [[international]]ly. In other words, [[government]]s themselves have an interest in multistakeholder modalities as a way to prevent [[Internet]] capture by other power centers.The participation of more stakeholders can inject [[expert]]ise and reflect a diversity of needs.&lt;ref name="Souter, 2017a"/&gt; The [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] thus ascribed to multistakeholder decision-making is closely tied to ‘the expectation of a higher quality of [[policy]] outcomes’,&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 2016:33.&lt;/ref&gt; or simply ‘better governance’.&lt;ref name="Souter, 2017a"/&gt;

The reality of multistakeholder participation is sometimes challenged by issues that relate both to the nature of the [[Internet]] itself – including [[jurisdiction]] and [[enforcement]],&lt;ref&gt;Satola, 2007:56.&lt;/ref&gt; scale, and the pace at which it changes and grows&lt;ref&gt;The Economist, 2016; ISOC, 2016; de la Chapelle, 2011; Malcolm 2008:18, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; – as well as challenges pertaining to its [[governance]].

=== Stakeholders ===
Broadly taken, the notion of stakeholders considers anyone or any [[entity]] with a [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimate]] interest in a particular [[Internet]] governance issue as a ‘stakeholder’. It recognizes that not all stakeholders automatically self-realize or self-identify as stakeholders, and not all multistakeholder processes include all stakeholders. It further recognizes that multistakeholder-based participation represents interests-based participation, rather than undifferentiated, individual or [[Idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] involvement by members of the public. Multistakeholder approaches should welcome and not exclude [[Controversy|disagreement]] and [[Minority group|minority]] or less-popular viewpoints,&lt;ref&gt;See the IGF BPF Multistakeholder on Strengthening Multistakeholder Participation Mechanisms, 2015, for a list of actions that could be construed potential examples of ‘bad actors’’ conduct in specific situations.&lt;/ref&gt; but may justifiably exclude disruptive actors who deploy disagreement to [[Unreasonable|unreasonably]] disrupt the process or to [[damage]] trust.

[[Gender equality|Gender divides]] are a significant and pressing challenge facing the [[Internet Universality|Universality of the Internet]] ecosystem – ranging from women’s ability to access and benefit the Internet to their ability to participate [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaningfully]] in multistakeholder processes. Gender itself can be described as ‘the social and cultural constructs that each [[society]] assigns to [[behavior]]s, characteristics and [[Value (ethics)|values]] attributed to men and women, reinforced by [[symbol]]s, [[law]]s and [[regulation]]s, [[institution]]s, and [[perception]]s.’&lt;ref&gt;See GEM’s definitions of gender here: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.genderevaluation.net/gem/en/understanding_gemgenderanalysis.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is continued disagreement about what the [[definition]] of multistakeholder participation in [[governance]] actually is or should be,&lt;ref&gt;c.f. Hofmann, 2016:33; Verhulst, 2016:6.&lt;/ref&gt; issues of due recognition,&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 2007:1.&lt;/ref&gt; the scope of participation and unequal nature of representation – particularly from [[Developing country|developing countries]] and [[civil society]] participants,&lt;ref&gt;Souter, 2017e; Verhulst, 2016; Belli, 2015: 11; Dickinson, 2014:67; Esterhuysen, 2014: 60; Doria, 2013; Calandro, Gillwald &amp; Zingales, 2013:5; Maciel &amp; Affonso, 2011:17; Drake, 2011:69; Mansell &amp; Raboy, 2011:12; Cogburn, 2006:62; Siganda, 2005:155.&lt;/ref&gt; the (in)ability to reach [[Consensus decision-making|consensus]],&lt;ref&gt;Mueller &amp; Wagner, 2014:12; Mueller, Mathiason &amp; Klein, 2007:237.&lt;/ref&gt; the exclusivity of some ostensibly inclusive processes and the unwillingness to listen to different views,&lt;ref name="Souter, 2017c"&gt;Souter, 2017c.&lt;/ref&gt; attempts to establish [[Legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]],&lt;ref&gt;Collins, 2007:16.&lt;/ref&gt; the sometimes slow pace of multistakeholder mechanisms,&lt;ref name="Souter, 2017c"/&gt; as well as the increasing number of stakeholders and complexity of challenges involved as the importance of the [[Internet]] to everyday life and [[Economy|economies]] becomes increasingly clear.&lt;ref&gt;c.f. GCIG, 2016:8; World Bank, 2016:37; Raymond &amp; DeNardis, 2015:609; Wagner, 2014; de la Chapelle, 2011; Mueller, 2010:253.&lt;/ref&gt; All these challenges are significant and sometimes they differ depending on the context and issue or topic at hand. However, three general concerns that are frequently mentioned in the [[literature]], relate to the [[Conspicuous consumption|conspicuous]] dominance or absence of certain participants, especially the [[private sector]]; how multistakeholder mechanisms should be balanced with [[Multilateralism|multilateral]] arrangements; and what the relationship between [[Internet governance]] at national and [[international]] levels is or should be.

Multistakeholder participation and [[governance]] mechanisms may be a ‘rather recent invention’, but they have a longer [[tradition]] as an ‘organizing principle and [[Politics|political]] practice’.&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 2016:29.&lt;/ref&gt; Such approaches are far from unique to [[Internet governance]]; with claims of their application and use especially prevalent in topics with cross-border or [[international]] relevance.&lt;ref&gt;Maciel, 2014:99.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples include labour relations, [[environmental protection]], [[finance]], [[human rights]], and [[sustainable development]]. Where the [[Internet]] is concerned, multistakeholder participation in its [[governance]] seems to possibly be both intrinsic – and more complicated – than in many other instances of multistakeholder participation. The ways in which the [[Internet]] was designed has both allowed and disallowed specific types of behaviour [[Online and offline|online]];&lt;ref&gt;Weiss, 2008:xiv.&lt;/ref&gt; meaning that the actions that led to the creation of the [[Internet]] were already acts of [[governance]] (albeit most likely unintended&lt;ref&gt;GCIG, 2016:8.&lt;/ref&gt;).

Although some have argued that the [[Internet]] is free from any regulatory oversight&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Barlow, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; or [[jurisdiction]]al restraints&lt;ref&gt;Johnson &amp; Post, 1996; Maier, 2010; Yahoo Inc. v LICRA (2006).&lt;/ref&gt; and should remain so, the [[Internet]] internally was never entirely a rule-free nor a ‘law-free zone’, nor was it a different universe to external [[Law|legal]] constraints.&lt;ref&gt;Sunstein, 2001:139.&lt;/ref&gt; Due to its unique design and composition, many have argued that the [[Internet]] requires non-traditional forms of [[governance]] – and particularly [[governance]] forms encouraging the participation of more [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in addition to [[government]]s (democratic or otherwise), which have been the key agent of [[governance]] in the [[Westphalian sovereignty|Westphalian system]] of national states.

The [[Internet]] is often cited as not only one of the prime examples of multistakeholder participation in [[governance]],&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Belli, 2015:3; Kleinwächter, 2014:115; Milan &amp; Hintz, 2014; Doria, 2013; Malcolm, 2008:520; Antonova, 2007:1.&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes described as inherently ‘multistakeholder’.&lt;ref&gt;Esterhuysen, 2014:57.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Internet]] is defined by open, distributed, interconnected, participatory, and [[Top-down and bottom-up design|bottom-up]] processes&lt;ref&gt;ISOC, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; – features that match multistakeholder participation in specific regard to its [[governance]]. Vint Cerf, one of the authors of the [[Internet Protocol]] (IP), has similarly noted that:&lt;ref&gt;Cerf, 2011:78.&lt;/ref&gt; "There is no question in my mind that the diversity of players in the [[Internet]] universe demands a multi-stakeholder approach to [[governance]] in the most general sense of the word. The debate around how the [[Internet]] is or should be governed has in some ways evolved from a discussion of how/whether the [[Internet]] can be governed to one concerning ‘whether there is (or should be) something new and different about the way we do so".&lt;ref&gt;Mueller, 2010:1.&lt;/ref&gt; Cerf’s words ‘in the most general sense of the word’ are important, as they also underpin the view that an understanding of multistakeholder approaches should not be approached in a [[Dogmatic theology|dogmatic]] manner. The demand for and value of multistakeholder participation in [[Internet governance]] was first explicitly expressed at the [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]], which took place in two phases between 2003 (in Geneva, Switzerland, with a focus on principles) and 2005 (in Tunis, Tunisia, with a focus on implementation).&lt;ref&gt;See CSTD/UNCTAD, 2015:142.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multistakeholder governance in practice ==

=== KICTANet ===
[[Kenya]] is widely regarded as a leading [[developing country]] participant in the global [[Internet governance]] field and has one of the most vibrant [[Internet governance]] communities in [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;Souter &amp; Kerrets-Makau, 2012:76.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenya]]’s [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] evolution, explains Professor [[Bitange Ndemo]], who previously served as [[Kenya]]’s Permanent Secretary for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]], was catalysed during [[Mwai Kibaki|President Mwai Kibai’]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s administration (2003-2013).&lt;ref&gt;Ndemo, 2017:341.&lt;/ref&gt; This ‘golden decade’&lt;ref&gt;Ndemo &amp; Weisser, 2017:xxiii.&lt;/ref&gt; for [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] [[innovation]] spurred numerous [[policy]] developments in the country’s [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] sector, along with corresponding success stories like the innovative [[Mobile commerce|mobile financial service]] [[M-Pesa|M-PESA]].&lt;ref&gt;Ndemo, 2017:371.&lt;/ref&gt; It saw the creation of not only the world’s first national and regional [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]] initiatives,&lt;ref&gt;Souter &amp; Kerrets-Makau, 2012:21.&lt;/ref&gt; but also an oft-lauded&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Ndemo, 2017:354; Souter &amp; Kerrets-Makau, 2012:50; Adam, James, Munyua &amp; Wanjira, 2007:28; APC &amp; Third World Institute, 2007:166; Mureithi, 2007:ii.&lt;/ref&gt; multistakeholder platform for deliberation on [[policy]] and other developments pertaining to the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] sector in October 2004, the Kenya ICT Action Network (KICTANet).

Alice Munyua, who was part of [[Kenya]]’s [[civil society]] delegation to [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]], explains that shortly after [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] she was commissioned to support the development of [[Kenya]]’s [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] sector as a part of Catalysing Access to ICT in Africa (CATIA), a development programme which was supported by the UK [[Department for International Development]] ([[Department for International Development|DFID]]). Recognizing the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] policy gap in [[Kenya]], Munyua commissioned research to determine which [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] would need to be consulted or engaged in developing a new [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] [[policy]] for the country.&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Munyua, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; As she later advised in a co-written volume:&lt;ref&gt;Adam, James, Munyua &amp; Wanjira, 2007:11.&lt;/ref&gt; It is useful to carry out a [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] analysis at the beginning of a multi-stakeholder process to ensure that there is a clear understanding of who should be involved in the process, to what extent, and at what time during the process. Using the results of the [[Kenya]] [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] analysis, participants from the media, [[business]], [[civil society]], [[Academy (educational institution)|academic]], and [[Development aid|development]] sectors were invited to an initial meeting in October 2004.&lt;ref&gt;More specifically, participants were from Kenya’s Media Council, the Telecommunications Service Providers Association of Kenya (TESPOK), the Kenya WSIS Civil Society Caucus, a research and consultancy firm (Summit Strategies), APC, and CATIA were at the first meeting.&lt;/ref&gt;

KICTANet was created as a loose alliance&lt;ref&gt;Munyua, 2016:212.&lt;/ref&gt; at this meeting with the specific aim of developing an [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] [[policy]] framework for the country.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Adam, James, Munyua &amp; Wanjira, 2007:7.&lt;/ref&gt; It was specifically designed to welcome multistakeholder participation due to the ‘perceived strength and effectiveness in joint collaborative [[policy]] [[advocacy]] activities, which would be based on pooling [[skill]]s and [[resource]]s,’&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; as opposed to [[wasting]] resources in ‘competing, overlapping [[advocacy]]’.&lt;ref&gt;Munyua, 2016:213.&lt;/ref&gt; Its operating [[slogan]] was, ‘let’s talk though we may not agree’.&lt;ref&gt;Mureithi, 2007:ii.&lt;/ref&gt; Tina James, who worked with CATIA when it supported the creation of KICTANet, points out: ‘the creation of KICTANet was just the right process at the right time.'&lt;ref&gt;Interview, James, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

With [[government]] and other [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] apparently relying on it, KICTANet therefore continued after the [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] policy was adopted, leading to ‘quite a lot of successes’ like the 2010 [[Kenya]] [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] Master Plan, as well as the regulatory approval of [[M-Pesa]] and [[Voice over IP|Voice over Internet Protocol]] (VOIP) services in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Munyua, 2016:213; Interview, Munyua, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; It also, for instance, participated in discussions that led to the drafting and passing of the National Cybersecurity Strategy (2014) and coordinated [[public participation]] in consultations like the 2014 [[African Union]] Convention on Cybersecurity.&lt;ref name="Sambuli, Maina &amp; Kamau, 2016:17"&gt;Sambuli, Maina &amp; Kamau, 2016:17.&lt;/ref&gt; By managing a [[website]] and [[mailing list]] with almost 800 participants from diverse [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholder]] groups,&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Walubengo, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been described as ‘perhaps the biggest virtual convener of [[Information and communications technology|ICT]] stakeholders in [[Kenya]]’.&lt;ref name="Sambuli, Maina &amp; Kamau, 2016:17"/&gt;

Grace Mutung’u, a KICTANet associate responsible for [[policy]] and [[Regulation|regulatory]] analysis, worries that Kenya’s [[Internet governance]] capacity is still limited to a ‘small bubble’; leading to doubts about what the network’s actual capacity and influence is in the country.&lt;ref&gt;Interview, Mutung’u, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Marco Civil ===
{{Main|Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet}}The [[Marco Civil da Internet]], otherwise known as the Brazilian Internet Bill of Rights or the Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet, was sanctioned by then president [[Dilma Rousseff|Dilma Roussef]] at the time of the [[NetMundial Initiative|NETMundial]] meeting in 2014.

This case is viewed as one of the first attempts for [[initiative]]s to become more [[concrete]], formal, [[Accountability|accountable]] and [[Tangibile|tangible]], rather than merely aspirational,&lt;ref&gt;Gill, Redeker &amp; Gasser, 2015:20.&lt;/ref&gt; and identifiable therefore as being covered by what has come to be known as the ‘digital [[constitutionalism]] umbrella’. [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|The Marco Civil]] process also shows that multistakeholder processes are ‘a compelling hallmark of digital constitutionalism’.

The [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Marco Civil]] therefore emerged as a rights-based response to the ‘Azeredo’ Bill.&lt;ref&gt;CTS-FGV &amp; CGI.br, 2012:19.&lt;/ref&gt; The process began in 2009 when the Ministry of Justice’s Office of Legislative Affairs (SAL/MJ) requested the Centre for Technology and Society at [[Fundação Getúlio Vargas|Getulio Vargas Foundation]] (CTS-FGV) to help coordinate a process of [[public consultation]]s engaging all [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], including those who had been vocal in opposing the Azeredo Bill.&lt;ref name="Brito Cruz, 2015:56"&gt;Brito Cruz, 2015:56&lt;/ref&gt; SAL/MJ enabled [[public consultation]]s using a portal administered by the [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Ministry of Culture]].&lt;ref&gt;http://culturadigital.br/marcocivil&lt;/ref&gt; SAL’s principal reason for using this platform was that the participatory process enabled by the online platform would serve as a complementary branch to the traditional [[Legislature|legislative]] process.&lt;ref name="Brito Cruz, 2015:56"/&gt;

As some analysts point out:&lt;ref&gt;2015&lt;/ref&gt; "Once it became clear that [[Brazil]] needed a bill of rights for the [[Internet]], it also became clear that the [[Internet]] itself could and should be used as a tool for drafting the [[legislation]]". The period of public comments was divided into two phases. The first phase involved [[Consultant|consulting]] with the general public regarding certain principles proposed for [[debate]], while the second phase involved examining each article and paragraph of the proposed draft bill. A [[focus group]] participant pointed out that dividing the process into these two phases allowed [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] sufficient time to develop positions on key aspects of the Bill.

After the process of [[public consultation]]s, the [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Marco Civil]] was introduced in the [[National Congress of Brazil|National Congress]] on 24 August 2011. The [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Bill]] was submitted to the House of Representatives on several occasions but was unable to make further progress in [[parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;Rossini, Brito Cruz &amp; Doneda argue that besides the challenge of balancing between a civil rights framework that protected human rights online, which included the careful negotiation of data localization and data retention, as well as takedown and intermediary liability vis à vis copyright disputes, ‘[o]ther factors also complicated the MCI [Marco Civil Initiative – author’s insertion in early 2014. The bill found itself in a crossfire between the federal administration and its own supporting coalition, led by Representative Eduardo Cunha. Cunha started a mini-rebellion against the executive, refusing to vote for bills supported by President Rousseff. The bill thus became hostage (or a bargaining chip) in a broader political negotiation that involved non-Internet policy issues’ (2015:6-7). Magrani similarly takes the view that while the Bill was before the House of Representatives, there were several attempts to modify the text, most of which concentrated on the copyright industry and in increasing investigatory powers through the expansion of data retention (2014:169, 170).&lt;/ref&gt; Carlos Affonso Souza, director of the Institute for Technology and Society of Rio de Janeiro (ITS Rio), remembers that this moment in the [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Bill]]’s development coincided with a change of administration and became a ‘crucial moment’ with concerns as to whether the [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Bill]] would withstand [[Politics|political]] constraints and change:&lt;ref&gt;Focus group, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; People began to wonder if the multistakeholder effort that took us so long to achieve was being put in peril because of this change of administration. The [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Marco Civil]] only resurfaced on the national legislative agenda in 2013&lt;ref&gt;Rossini, Brito Cruz &amp; Doneda, 2015:5.&lt;/ref&gt; when [[Edward Snowden]], an ex-[[National Security Agency]] (NSA) contractor, made revelations regarding pervasive [[Human rights and encryption|surveillance practices]] by certain [[Intelligence agency|intelligence agencies]].&lt;ref&gt;Harding, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, [[Dilma Rousseff|Rousseff]] decided that the [[Brazilian Civil Rights Framework for the Internet|Bill]] should be tabled in the House of Representatives and the [[Senate]] with [[constitution]]al urgency.&lt;ref&gt;Câmara, 2013. Declaring the Bill as constitutionally urgent also meant that the Bill should be voted for during the following 45 days in the House of Representatives and, after that, voted in the next 45 days in the Senate.&lt;/ref&gt; The final version&lt;ref&gt;For a detailed analysis of the challenges and topics tackled by the Marco Civil, see Brito Cruz, 2015:96-115; Rossini, Brito Cruz &amp; Doneda, 2015:7-14.&lt;/ref&gt; explicitly notes that to aid the development of the [[Internet in Brazil]], mechanisms must be established to enhance and guarantee multistakeholder, transparent, [[Collaboration|collaborative]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] participation between [[Private sector|private actors]], [[civil society]], and [[Academy|academia]] (Art. 24).&lt;ref&gt;Translation of Art. 24 of Law 12.965/14. Available in Portuguese at: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.planalto.gov.br/ccivil_03/_ato2011-2014/2014/lei/l12965.htm&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; While the [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] process outcomes and CGI.br Principles also provide important reference points for Brazil’s adoption of multistakeholder approaches in international fora where [[Internet governance]] is concerned.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewer comment by Benedicto Fonseca Filha, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South Korea's case ===
The [[Constitution]]al challenge in the [[South Korea|Republic of South Korea]] illustrates not only a multistakeholder model but also the importance of having strong [[institution]]s like an [[Judicial independence|independent judiciary]] to protect [[Human rights and encryption|human rights online]]. On 24 August 2012, the [[Constitutional Court of Korea|South Korean Constitutional Court]] unanimously ruled&lt;ref&gt;2010 Heon Ma 47, 252. See Kim, 2012, for unofficial English translation.&lt;/ref&gt; that certain user identity verification provisions in the country were [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]].&lt;ref&gt;Park, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; For five years, the provisions had required all major website operators in the [[South Korea|Republic of South Korea]]&lt;ref&gt;Henceforth ‘South Korea’.&lt;/ref&gt; to obtain, verify, and store personal identification details from any user wanting to post anything on their platforms. This [[constitution]]al challenge shows how the [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] collaborated to bring this challenge before the [[Constitutional Court of Korea|Constitutional Court of South Korea]].

The consequences of the provisions were widespread&lt;ref&gt;While 37 websites were affected by the provisions in 2007, the extension of the policy in 2009 saw 153 websites being subjected to the requirements of the law in 2009, 167 websites in 2010, and 156 websites in 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; and attracted both local and [[Globalization|global]] criticism. For instance, [[Frank William La Rue|Frank La Rue]], then the [[United Nations|UN]] Special Rapporteur on the Promotion and Protection of Freedom of Expression, undertook a mission to [[South Korea]] in May 2010 and expressed concerns about the condition of [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] in the country.&lt;ref name="UNGA, 2011a"&gt;UNGA, 2011a.&lt;/ref&gt; While he acknowledged the need to protect [[Citizenship|citizens]] from ‘legitimate concerns regarding crimes perpetrated via the [[Internet]] and the responsibility of the [[Government]] to identify such persons’, he also warned about potential [[chilling effect]]s and the ‘impact of such identification systems to the right to [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], which is rooted in [[Human rights and encryption|anonymity]]’.&lt;ref name="UNGA, 2011a"/&gt;

Around 2008, certain [[South Korea]]n Internet [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] – including [[Academy (educational institution)|academics]], the [[business]] community, technical community, [[civil society]], and participants from the legal community – started having frequent, informal meetings to discuss [[Internet]] policies and related issues. These discussions became more vibrant after [[YouTube]] disabled its Korean page and published a blog post explaining and defending its [[Globalization|global]] stance on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]].&lt;ref&gt;Whetstone, 2009 (in Korean).&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical community provided [[information]] about how futile it was to try to identify users accurately or to measure the number of unique visitors to a page; while the [[Private sector|business community]] provided [[data]] on the costs of establishing, storing, and managing such a system safely. [[Non-governmental organization|Civil society organizations]] presented concerns to the Court about the effects the provisions were having on [[fundamental rights]] and the value of [[Anonymity|online anonymity]].&lt;ref&gt;Interviews, Chung, 2017; Kim, 2017; Park, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Constitutional court|Constitutional Court]] issued a unanimous ruling on 24 August 2012 that the provisions were [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]] for reasons ranging from the effect of the provisions on [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]], [[Freedom of the press|freedom of the media]], the [[Human rights and encryption|right to privacy]], and the unfair costs incurred by [[website]] operators.&lt;ref&gt;2010 Heon Ma 47, 252. See Kim, 2012, for unofficial English translation. While the judgment is particularly interesting and well-reasoned, the scope of this Study does not allow a full discussion of the Court’s ruling. The reasons for the ruling coincide with many of the reasons the provisions were criticised, discussed above. The only submission by the plaintiffs that was not accepted by the Court was the notion that the provisions amount to prior censorship. The Court felt that mandatory user verification did not regulate the publication depending on a review of content, but only upon the registration of the poster.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Keechang Kim considers that: "What happened in [[South Korea]] really shows some of the very serious shortcomings or negative consequences if [[Internet]]-related [[Policy|policies]] are taken in a very one-sided, [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down]] manner."

This case shows that reactive multistakeholder collaboration can be useful in addressing challenges, like [[Restrictiveness|restrictive]] legislation, that infringe upon [[Internet Universality]] (in this case [[Freedom of speech|freedom of expression]] and [[Privacy|privacy rights]]) in one way or another.

=== The Internet Governance Forum ===
{{Main|Internet Governance Forum}}The [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]] is created by the [[World Summit on the Information Society|WSIS]] and, more specifically, the [[Tunis Agenda for the Information Society|Tunis Agenda]].&lt;ref&gt;Para 72, WSIS, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Despite [[Skepticism|scepticism]] and [[criticism]] relating to, among other things, the [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]]’s ability to influence [[policy]] and/or to act as an [[Internet governance]] body,&lt;ref&gt;e.g. DeNardis, 2014; Kleinwächter, 2011:8; Lucero, 2011:39; de la Chapelle, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; it has been described as integrally ‘part of the fabric of [[internet governance]]&lt;ref&gt;Price, 2014:5.&lt;/ref&gt; and as ‘a type of new laboratory’&lt;ref&gt;de la Chapelle, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; in which to ‘promote multistakeholderism through multistakeholderism’.&lt;ref&gt;Belli, 2015:4.&lt;/ref&gt; One writer, for instance, points out that:&lt;ref&gt;Hofmann, 2016:37.&lt;/ref&gt; "The IGF is the first organisation in [[Internet governance]] whose founding was explicitly based on the multi-stakeholder principle." The [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]]’s Best Practice Forum (BPF) on [[Gender]], more specifically, [[Globalization|global]] focused, [[gender]] dimensioned, broader [[public policy]] emphasised.&lt;ref&gt;Most the BPFs have a more technical focus&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the case introduces interesting questions pertaining to how multistakeholder participation is affected when [[Disruptive innovation|disruptive]] actors participate in a process or activity.&lt;ref&gt;The author acted as the consultant rapporteur for the BPF Gender in 2015 and 2016. This fact was known by all participants in the focus groups and interviews.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]]’s mandate is tasked with, among other things, discussing [[public policy]] issues related to key elements of [[Internet governance]] by facilitating the exchange of information and [[best practice]]s and by making ‘full use of the [[expert]]ise of the [[Academy (educational institution)|academic]], [[Science|scientific]] and technical communities’. It is, at least in [[theory]], multistakeholder in composition,&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm, 2008:419.&lt;/ref&gt; and should furthermore strengthen and enhance ‘the engagement of [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] in existing and/or future [[Internet governance|Internet governance mechanisms]], particularly those from [[Developing country|developing countries]]’.&lt;ref&gt;paragraph 72 of the WSIS’ Tunis Agenda, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

To enrich the potential for more [[Tangibile|tangible]] outputs, the [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]]’s Multistakeholder Advisory Group (MAG) and Secretariat developed an intersessional programme intended to complement other [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]] activities, such as regional and national [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]] [[initiative]]s (NRIs), dynamic [[coalition]]s (DCs) and so-called best practice forums (BPFs). The outputs from this programme were designed to ‘become robust resources, to serve as inputs into other pertinent forums, and to evolve and grow over time’.&lt;ref&gt;See the IGF website for more information about these activities: &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.intgovforum.org/multilingual/content/thematic-work&lt;/nowiki&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, the MAG decided to devote one of six BPFs to a [[gender]]-related challenge facing the [[Internet]]. [[Jac sm Kee|Jac SM Kee]] of the global civil society organization [[Association for Progressive Communications]] (APC), who was one of the lead coordinators of the BPF [[Gender]] in 2015 and 2016, says that [[gender]] was increasingly becoming a pressing issue in [[Internet governance]] discussions at the time, which was why she originally proposed it to the MAG. While there was debate within the MAG as to what such a BPF should be focusing on, [[Jac sm Kee|Kee]] takes the view that ‘because of the multistakeholder nature’ of MAG meetings and programme development procedures, whatever is proposed tends to be ‘taken on’.&lt;ref&gt;Focus group, Kee, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2015, the BPF Gender focused more specifically on [[Cyberbullying|online abuse]] and [[Gender violence|gender-based violence]] as ‘an increasingly important and focused area’ in the field of [[gender]] and [[Internet governance]].&lt;ref&gt;IGF BPF Gender, 2015:60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Each year the BPF coordinators and [[rapporteur]] adopted a semi-structured [[methodology]] by organizing fortnightly [[Virtual call capability|virtual calls]] to introduce the topic to [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]], to welcome broader participation, to define the scope of the BPF’s priorities, and to investigate proposed methodologies that could encourage multistakeholder participation. In 2016, the BPF also tried to involve more [[Stakeholder (corporate)|stakeholders]] from other regions by arranging onsite meetings at certain NRIs, including [[Internet Governance Forum|Brazil IGF]], [[Asia-Pacific|Asia Pacific]] Regional [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]] (APrIGF), the [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]] of [[Latin America]], and the [[Caribbean]] (LACIGF). These sessions were used to gather local best practices and to raise awareness of the BPF’s work. Where possible, lessons and stories gathered from these events were integrated into the BPF’s outcome report in 2016.

The case of the IGF’s BPF [[Gender]] illustrates the difficulties of promoting multistakeholder participation in [[Internet governance]] when certain, especially potentially [[Contentious politics|contentious]], topics are involved. It similarly shows the potential [[chilling effect]]s that the participation of disruptive actors might have on a volunteer-driven, multistakeholder process. In that sense, it demonstrates the need to sometimes balance the values of openness and [[Transparency (behavior)|transparency]] often cherished in multistakeholder processes at the [[Internet Governance Forum|IGF]]&lt;ref&gt;e.g. Maciel &amp; Affonso Pereira de Souza, 2011:7; de la Chapelle, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; with the need to also protect the [[safety]] and [[privacy]] of participants.

== Internet Universality ==
{{Main|Internet Universality}}

=== Internet Universality Concept ===
Internet Universality is the concept that "the [[Internet]] is much more than [[infrastructure]] and applications, it is a network of [[Economy|economic]] and [[Social relation|social interactions]] and relationships, which has the potential to enable Human [[rights]], empower individuals and communities, and facilitate [[sustainable development]]. The concept is based on four principles stressing the [[Internet]] should be [[Human rights]]-based, [[Open standard|Open]], [[Accessibility|Accessible]], and based on [[Multistakeholder governance model|Multistakeholder]] participation. These have been abbreviated as the R-O-A-M principles. Understanding the [[Internet]] in this way helps to draw together different facets of [[Internet governance|Internet development]], concerned with technology and [[public policy]], [[Human rights|rights]] and [[Sustainable Development Goals|development]]."&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/internetuniversality/about&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internet Universality Indicators ===
[[UNESCO]] is now developing Internet Universality indicators - based on the ROAM principles - to help [[government]]s and other stakeholders to assess their own national [[Internet]] environments and to promote the values associated with Internet Universality.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/themes/freedom-expression-internet&lt;/ref&gt; The [[research]] process was envisioned to include consultations at a range of global forums and a written [[questionnaire]] sent to key actors, but also a series of [[publication]]s on important [[Internet censorship|Internet Freedom]] related issues as [[Human rights and encryption|encryption]], [[hate speech]] online, [[privacy]], [[Internet safety|digital safety]] and [[Journalism and freedom|journalism]] sources.&lt;ref&gt;https://en.unesco.org/unesco-series-on-internet-freedom&lt;/ref&gt; The outcome of this [[multidimensional]] research will be publicized in June 2018. The final indicators will be submitted to the [[Member states of UNESCO|UNESCO Member States]] in the International Program for Development of Communication (IPDC) for endorsement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Keystones to foster inclusive Knowledge Societies.|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=|location=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232563E.pdf|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

!&lt;blockquote&gt;Inclusiveness:&lt;/blockquote&gt;
!Inclusiveness as a value signifies that participants in a multistakeholder process collaborate,
while retaining different roles and responsibilities. Closely related to R.O.A.M. values of
accessibility and openness, inclusivity encapsulates the needs to overcome barriers to
accessible participation and to dedicate sufficient funding and capacity-building efforts to
promote the participation of a rich diversity of stakeholders.

!The challenge or concern which needs to be addressed should be defined clearly from
the outset, and stakeholders should agree on common norms to guide working methods,
including the extent of transparency, flexibility required, ways of making decisions, and
means to promote and protect participants’ safety and rights when participating in a
multistakeholder process.
|-
!Equality:
!Not only do multistakeholder processes and working methods need to be open and
transparent to ensure that any stakeholder can participate at any stage of a multistakeholder
process, but the stakeholders that do participate need to be clear about their interests and
affiliations.
|-
!Flexibility and relevance:
!Due to the pace of technological change, multistakeholder participation needs to be
flexible enough to ensure that a process or activity can adapt to the changing needs of
an Internet governance challenge or concern. Multistakeholder participation
should be customised to be relevant to local, regional, national and global instances of
multistakeholder collaboration.
|-
!Privacy and safety:
!It is important that adequate steps are taken to ensure that participants’ safety and privacy
needs are met as far as is reasonably possible, especially where potentially contentious
topics related to the future and evolution of the Internet are concerned.
|-
!Accountability and legitimacy:
!Multistakeholder mechanisms should regularly evaluate processes, outcomes and goals to
ensure that they remain legitimate, relevant, and transparently on track.
|-
!Responsiveness:
!The frame of ‘digital constitutionalism’ entails a notion of institutionalised processes
with foundational and possibly legal character, which gives rise - in such iterations
of multistakeholder practice - to the further notion of rights and duties concerning
involvement, and thence that involved parties are entitled to a feedback loop about their
participation.

In [[Canada]] and the [[United States]], the term ''parental responsibility'' refers to the potential or actual liability that may be incurred by [[parents]] for the behavior of their [[child]]ren.

==In Canada law==
Parental responsibility legislation has been enacted in three Canadian provinces: Manitoba (1997), Ontario (2000), and British-Columbia (2001).

Under the Parental Responsibility Act, 2000, a "child" is anyone under the age of 18 years, and "parent" means: 
*either the biological, [[adoptive]], or [[legal guardian]] parent of the child,
*or the person who has lawful custody of, or a right of access to, the child.
The Small Claims Court may order such parents to compensate those suffering any loss or damage intentionally caused by their child, unless the parent was exercising reasonable supervision over the child at the time the child engaged in the activity that caused the loss or damage and made reasonable efforts to prevent or discourage the child from engaging in the kind of activity that resulted in the loss or damage.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.e-laws.gov.on.ca/DBLaws/Statutes/English/00p04_e.htm)&lt;/ref&gt;

==In U.S. law==
There is a [[political]] movement for greater parental accountability following of a number of highly publicized violent [[crime]]s committed by children. While all [[U.S. states]] allow parents to be sued for the various actions of their children, the idea of criminal [[legislation]] to enable the prosecution of adults for “neglectful” parenting is relatively new. For example, a number of states have enacted or proposed laws that will: 
*automatically hold parents financially responsible for all expenses associated with a second false bomb threat or 911 call made by a child;
*impose a [[prison]] term of up to 18 months and order payment of restitution to any victims if the child commits a serious crime;
*imposes a fine and/or a prison term if a child uses a gun owned by the parent to commit a crime
*fine and/or imprison parents whose children fail to attend school or skip school more than 10 times in a year.
Such legislation is constitutionally problematic in that it is often both broad and vague, and may very well infringe upon the [[privacy]] of the [[family]]. The sponsors of these laws argue that ''parental delinquency'' is usually the cause of the ''juvenile delinquency'', but opponents argue that there is little evidence to support the claim that youth crime is caused by “bad parenting” and that there are many other [[social]], [[cultural]] and [[economic]] causes that should be addressed. Opponents argue that the increased work hours and multiple jobs that a growing number of parents must take to provide for their families' basic needs decreases their ability to supervise their child(ren), thus creating an injustice with regard to the parents' culpability in the child's action. In 1988, [[California]] enacted the Street Terrorism and Prevention Act, which provides for prison sentences of up to one year and fines up to $2,500 for parents who “grossly” or “culpably” deviate from the “normal” standards of supervision. The [[California Supreme Court]] later upheld the constitutionality of this Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V75-4D4JP47-4&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1096921235&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=ac4b2d2abb2d4c7893a307eea8538e7d|title=Paying for the crimes of their children: Public support of parental responsibility |publisher=Science Direct|accessdate=November 17, 2009|doi=10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2004.06.010|volume=32|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|pages=465–475}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Luxembourg Referendum 2015 Postal vote - ballot and other documents.jpg|thumb|Ballot and other documents for postal voting for the [[Luxembourg constitutional referendum, 2015]]]]
'''Postal voting''' is [[voting]] in an election whereby ballot papers are distributed to electors or returned by post, in contrast to electors voting in person at a [[polling place|polling station]] or electronically via an [[electronic voting]] system. Historically, postal votes must be distributed and placed in return mail before the scheduled [[election day]], it is sometimes referred to as a form of [[early voting]]. It can also be used as an [[absentee ballot]].  However, in recent times the model in the US has morphed, in municipalities that use postal voting exclusively, to be one of ballots being mailed out to voters, but the return method taking on alternatives of return by mail or dropping off the ballot in person via secure drop boxes and/or voting centers. 

Postal voting refers only to the means by which the ballots are submitted, not to the method by which the votes are counted. Election officials may count the votes by processing the mailed-in ballots through electronic [[voting machine]]s, or may count the votes manually.

To enable as many voters as possible to participate, postal voting can assist people who may not be able to attend a polling station in person, for example because of a physical disability, absence from the locality or some other reason. Postal voting is generally available to voters upon application, sometimes with restrictions. If no reason for a request is required, it may be called '''postal vote on demand'''. Postal voting may be an option for voters in some jurisdictions, while in some elections there may be '''all-postal voting'''.

A form of postal voting was introduced in Western Australia in 1877, followed by an improved method in South Australia in 1890.&lt;ref name="atsod"&gt;{{cite book |title=Australia: The State of Democracy |last=Sawer |first=Marian |author2=Norman Abjorensen |author3=Philip Larkin  |year=2009 |publisher=Federation Press |isbn=1862877254 |pages=107–114 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=F09pc74M9NMC |accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, concerns about postal voting have been raised as to whether it complies with the requirements of a secret ballot, in that people cast their vote outside the security of a polling station, and whether voters can cast their vote privately free from another person's coercion. There have been cases of [[electoral fraud]] with postal votes in the United Kingdom (including in Birmingham at the [[United Kingdom elections, 2004|2004 European and local government elections in the UK]]).&lt;ref name="Judge upholds vote-rigging claims"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/west_midlands/4406575.stm |title=Judge upholds vote-rigging claims |publisher=BBC News |date=2005-04-04 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="politics.guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|author=Hugh Muir, Sandra Laville and Audrey Gillan |url=http://politics.guardian.co.uk/election/story/0,15803,1458341,00.html |title=New fears over postal vote fraud |publisher=Politics.guardian.co.uk |date= 2005-04-13|accessdate=2010-09-19 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1564522,00.html Labour to halt postal vote fraud but only after election (Times, April 11, 2005)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109115209/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,19809-1564522,00.html |date=January 9, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==All-postal voting==
''All-postal'' voting is the form of postal voting where all electors receive their ballot papers through the post, not just those who requested an absentee ballot. Depending on the system applied, electors may have to return their ballot papers by post, or there may be an opportunity to deliver them by hand to a specified location.

There is some evidence that this method of voting leads to higher turnout than one where people vote in person or have to apply for a postal vote. Critics suggest that this is only a temporary impact, and that there are dangers in people using ballot papers intended for other electors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

It has been tested by a large number of local authorities in the [[United Kingdom]] for their elections, and in 2004 it was used for elections to the European Parliament and local authorities in four of the English regions (see below for more details).

==Experience of postal voting and all-postal voting by country==
===France===
France had absentee voting until the 1970s, when it was abolished because they were classified as a security risk in terms of vote-rigging.

===Germany===
Absentee voting has existed in Germany since 1957, in order to ensure that all German citizens, especially the old, sick, and disabled, and citizens living abroad, have had the opportunity to participate in elections. Like in many other countries, in more recent years, voting by mail has become increasingly popular among younger and non-disabled citizens residing within the country; as such, [http://network.gruene-washington.de/SitePages/briefwahl2017.aspx various tools] are being developed to help citizens, both domestic and abroad, more easily apply for postal voting.

===Italy===
[[File:Plico elettorale Italia 2013.jpg|thumb|Electoral package sent to an Italian voter in South America during the [[Italian general election, 2013]].]]
Since 2001 Italian citizens living abroad have the right to vote by mail in all referendums and national elections being held in Italy (provided they had registered their residence abroad with their relevant consulate).

===Malaysia===
In [[Malaysia]], opposition leader and former deputy prime minister [[Anwar Ibrahim]] alleged that postal votes have been used by the ruling [[Barisan Nasional]] coalition in securing seats in certain constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ABC News|date=March 3, 2008|title=Malaysian oppn accuse govt of postal vote fraud|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/03/03/2177581.htm|accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that in one particular constituency (Setiawangsa), he claimed that his [[Parti Keadilan Rakyat]] had actually won during the [[Malaysian general election, 2008|2008 elections]], before 14,000 postal votes came in awarding the incumbent BN parliamentarian the seat with a majority of 8,000 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The Sun (Malaysia)|date=March 27, 2008|title=One foot in the door|url=http://www.malaysianbar.org.my/news_features/one_foot_in_the_door.html|accessdate=2008-04-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Malaysia, only teachers, military personnel, and policemen based away from their constituencies are eligible to submit postal votes.

===Mexico===
[[File:Boleta electoral marcada, de las elecciones federales de México de 2012.JPG|thumb|right|Postal ballot paper for Mexico federal election 2012]]
In Mexico, since the 2006 federal elections, postal voting for people living abroad has been permitted. A request can be made to the [[National Electoral Institute]] which then sends the ballots outside the country.

===Philippines===
{{Main|Elections in the Philippines#Voting}}
Mail-in ballots are an option for [[Overseas Filipinos]] in select countries only. The general practise for local and overseas absentee voting in [[Republic of the Philippines|Philippine]] elections requires that ballots be cast in person at select polling places, such as a [[Consulate|consulate office]].

===Spain===
In Spain, for European, regional and municipal elections, voters who will be absent from their town on election day or are ill or disabled, may request a postal vote at a post office. The application must be submitted personally or through a representative in case of illness or disability certified by a medical certificate.

===Switzerland===
{{Main|Voting in Switzerland}}
Swiss federal law allows postal voting in all federal elections and referenda,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite swiss law|sr=161.1|link=161_1|art=8|en=Federal Statute on Political Rights}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all [[Cantons of Switzerland|cantons]] also allow it for cantonal ballot issues. All voters receive their personal ballot by mail and may either cast it at a polling station or mail it back.

===United States===
[[File:Early voting US states.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|No-excuse early voting in U.S. states, as of September 2014.

'''Vote-by-mail''' (also known as '''Vote from Home'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://washingtonmonthly.com/magazine/janfeb-2016/vote-from-home-save-your-country/|title=Vote from Home, Save Your Country|date=2016-01-10|work=Washington Monthly|access-date=2018-11-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;) is a variation of postal voting in the United States in which a [[ballot]] is mailed to the [[home]] of a registered voter, the voter fills it out and returns it via postal mail or drops off the ballot in-person into a secure drop box or at a voting center. This process eliminates the requirements to staff and run a polling center during an election and can result in considerable cost savings to the state.&lt;ref name="pewt_Colo"&gt;{{Cite web |title=Colorado Voting Reforms: Early Results |work=pewtrusts.org |date=March 22, 2016 |access-date=25 October 2018 |url= https://www.pewtrusts.org/en/research-and-analysis/issue-briefs/2016/03/colorado-voting-reforms-early-results }}&lt;/ref&gt; Balloting materials may be sent via the United States Postal Service without prepayment of postage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pe.usps.com/text/dmm300/703.htm#wp1114319 |title=USPS DMM 703.8 |publisher=Pe.usps.com |date=2010-01-01 |accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Ballots are sent out around three weeks before the election date, after a voter's pamphlet has been distributed. To vote by mail, an individual marks the ballot for their choice of the candidates (or writes in their name), places the ballot in a secrecy envelope, seals it, places it in the provided mailing envelope, seals it and signs and dates the back of the mailing envelope. This envelope is then either stamped and mailed at any mailbox, or dropped off (postage free) at a local ballot collection center.

[[File:Oregon ballot return box.jpg|thumb|A vote-by-mail ballot is returned to a ballot drop box.]]
There is a cut off date for mailing ballots and it is determined by the local voting jurisdiction. In some jurisdictions, postmarks do not count, and ballots must be received by a certain time on election day. In other jurisdictions, a ballot must have a postmark on or before the day of the election and be received prior to the date of certification. Many vote-by-mail jurisdictions enlist the help of volunteers to take ballots in walk up Drop off Booths or drive-up Quick Drop locations. The [[Help America Vote Act]] requires some polling options, often at central election headquarters, with machines designed for voting by those disabled who cannot vote a normal ballot.

In the 2016 US Presidential election, approximately 33 million ballots were cast via mailed out ballots (about 25% of all ballots cast). That was from a combination of the 100% vote by mail jurisdictions plus absentees elsewhere. In 2016, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) issued a report outlining the turnout improvements seen in vote by mail elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Elections: Issues Related to Registering Voters and Administering Elections |publisher=U.S. Government Accountability Office (U.S. GAO) |date=June 2016 |url= https://www.gao.gov/assets/680/678131.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018, a report from the US Senate Intelligence Committee of Russian meddling in the 2016 election pointed out that paper ballots, by definition part of all vote by mail elections, were inherently safer than electronic voting systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Russian Targeting of Election Infrastructure During The 2016 Election: Summary of Draft SSCI Recommendations |url= https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ef45f5_32dc275babf6443eb608d8340f4e964e.pdf |publisher=US Senate Intelligence Committee }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Texas, some [[electoral fraud]] has occurred over the years involving political operatives illegally aiding those eligible to vote by mail, usually voters over 65 years of age or voters with a disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

====States with all vote-by-mail elections====
[[Image:Oregon special election ballot.jpg|thumb|125px|An Oregon mail-in ballot for a special election in May 2005.]]

In 1998, voters in [[Oregon]] passed an [[Oregon Ballot Measure 60 (1998)|initiative]] requiring that all elections be conducted by mail. Voters may also drop their ballots off at a [[County (United States)|county]] designated official drop site. Oregon has since reduced the cost of elections, and the time available to tally votes has increased. Oregon requires receipt of votes by 8:00{{nbsp}}pm local time on election day. County elections offices collect from post offices at their closing time on election day and from drop boxes at 8:00{{nbsp}}pm election day. Any valid ballot received by 8:00{{nbsp}}pm local time on election day by any county is required to be counted, unless the cumulative votes of any valid ballots transferred to the relevant county elections office after the closing of the polls cannot change the outcome of the election for any given seat.

In 2011, the [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]] legislature passed a law requiring all counties to conduct vote-by-mail elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In 2013, [[Colorado]] began holding all elections by mail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Voting|url=http://www.ncsl.org/research/elections-and-campaigns/absentee-and-early-voting.aspx#mail|website=National Conference of State Legislatures|accessdate=26 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   A Pantheon Analytics study of the 2014 election showed a significant uptick in voter participation from what would have normally been "low propensity" voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Showalter |first1=Amelia |title=Colorado 2014: Analysis of Predicted and Actual Turnout |url=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ef45f5_e8b1a125bf7644c9bab0572a7062a960.pdf |publisher=Pantheon Analytics |accessdate=7 November 2018 |format=PDF |date=August 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A PEW Charitable Trust study of the same election showed significant cost savings.&lt;ref name="pewt_Colo"/&gt;

in 2014, [[Utah]] started allowing each county to make their own decision regarding whether to go to 100% mailed-out ballots. In the 2016 general election, 21 of their 29 counties did so. That rose to 27 of 29 counties in 2018, covering over 98% of their electorate.  A Pantheon Analytics study of Utah's 2016 general election showed a 5-7% point higher turnout in the counties using vote by mail than those with traditional polling places, with even higher differences (~10% points) among younger voters. 

In 2016, [[California]] passed SB 450 which authorizes a roll-out of vote by mail across the state, at county discretion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=California Voter's Choice Act |url=http://www.sos.ca.gov/elections/voters-choice-act/ |website=www.sos.ca.gov |publisher=[[California Secretary of State]] |accessdate=7 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five counties will do so in 2018. For 2020, all counties will be authorized to do so, except Los Angeles County, which will be authorized in 2022.

Other jurisdictions are now starting to experiment with vote by mail, or run pilot programs. 31 of 53 counties in North Dakota now vote by mail,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National Vote at Home Coalition (NVAHC) press release |url=https://docs.wixstatic.com/ugd/ef45f5_8b82d14003534c28946dc2f279161917.pdf |publisher=National Vote at Home Coalition |accessdate=7 November 2018 |format=PDF |date=April 10, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do over 1000 precincts in Minnesota (those with fewer than 400 registered voters).

====Controversy====
[[Project Vote]] published their findings in a 2007 article titled "Vote-by-Mail Doesn't Deliver" by
Michael Slater and Teresa James. The article's conclusion states,

{{quote|Thanks largely to Oregon's experience, many reform-minded advocates and policymakers have become persuaded that vote-by-mail stimulates increased voter turnout with few drawbacks. We think the facts don't support their arguments. VBM reinforces the stratification of the electorate; it's more amenable to both fraud and manipulation than voting at polling places; and it depends too much on the reliability of the U.S. Postal Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Michael Slater and Teresa James |url=http://www.nonprofitvote.org/documents/2011/02/vote-by-mail-doesnt-deliver-slater.doc |title=Vote-by-Mail Doesn't Deliver |publisher=Tompaine.com |date= |accessdate=2016-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Oregon (the original Vote-by-Mail state), more than half of voters now choose to drop off ballots. The states of Colorado and Washington have followed suit, with California starting to roll out in 2018.  Utah will hit 98% of voters in this model in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/oregon-voter-turnout-high|title=Why Voter Turnout In Oregon Is Incredibly High|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://investigations.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/09/25/14092264-the-real-vote-fraud-opportunity-has-arrived-casting-your-ballot-by-mail|title=The real vote-fraud opportunity has arrived: casting your ballot by mail|first=|last=Investigations|publisher=|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Get out the Vote===
VBM Changes [[Get out the vote]] (GOTV) in a big way.
With VBM a government no longer has to get people to the vote center on election day, a government only has to collect their ballots and take those easily portable envelopes to a vote center or VBM drop site. This makes GOTV a lot easier, but it also makes fraud possible.  There are already apocryphal stories and urban legends about people collecting ballots and dumping them. There is very little evidence for actual fraud. Some jurisdictions have set limits in an attempt to reduce putative fraud:  New Jersey and Colorado limit agents to 10 and 3 ballots respectively; Oregon too has limits.  Face to face GOTV has been found to be less effective with VBM. &lt;ref&gt; Arceneaux, Kevin and Kousser, Thad and Mullin, Megan, Get Out the Vote-by-Mail?

====Alternatives====
An increasing number of states in the USA now allow [[drive-thru voting]]. In the process voters leave their absentee ballots in a drop box at designated locations. Some locations allow drop-off voting 24/7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=&lt;!--start post navigation--&gt; Previous post Next post |url=http://blog.wired.com/cars/2008/11/it-is-time-for.html |title=It's Time for Drive-Thru Voting |publisher=Blog.wired.com |date= November 4, 2008|accessdate=2010-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It turns out that more and more states are adopting the Colorado model, providing voters with multiple ways to return their ballot: by mail, via in person secure drop boxes, and at voting centers where they can get questions answered, replacement ballots, etc. Oregon now has 300 drop boxes across the state in the weeks leading up to each election, and in fact more voters now cast their ballot in person than by return mail.  The term "Vote at Home" is starting to replace "Vote by mail" for that reason.  California's roll-out of vote by mail is incorporating voting centers as a key part of their effort.  Anchorage's successful pilot included many drop boxes and some voting centers.

===United Kingdom===

==== History ====
Voting at elections originally took place by way of a public show of hands or by a public ballot. The right to vote by secret ballot was introduced by the ''Parliamentary and Municipal Elections Act 1872'' (the ''[[Ballot Act 1872]]''). After this voting took place at polling stations where voters marked their votes in secret and placed their ballot papers in a closed box.

Absent voting was first introduced for the immediate post-war period in 1918 for servicemen and others prevented ''‘by reason of the nature of their occupation…from voting at a poll''' by the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1918]]''. Armed forces still serving overseas at the end of World War I were allowed to vote by post, and permanent arrangements were made for proxy voting by servicemen. The ''[[Representation of the People Act 1945]]'' again made temporary provision for postal voting by service voters. Postal voting was not extended to civilians until 1948 when the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1948]]'' granted postal voting facilities to both service personnel and to certain groups of civilians including those who were physically incapacitated, those unable to vote without making a journey by sea or air or because of the nature of their occupation, and those who were no longer residing at their qualifying address. All had to provide an address in the UK to which ballot papers could be sent. Service personnel could, alternatively, vote by proxy if they were likely to be at sea or abroad on polling day.

In 1983, in its review of electoral law, the Home Affairs Select Committee criticised the categories of absent voters who were allowed to vote by post. The Committee made clear that they would not wish absent voting facilities to be made available to everybody on demand but recommended that "the Home Office should review the existing criteria for eligibility for absent voting facilities, and in particular we suggest that it would be permissible to apply for a postal vote due to absence “by reason of employment”, without the necessity to distinguish between one type of employment or another."&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People Acts, Report of the Home Affairs Select Committee, HC 32 1982-83, para 54&lt;/ref&gt; The Committee also called for voters absent on holiday to have the right to apply for a postal vote. The Government responded to the Committee's report in January 1984 and expressed some concern at the increased opportunities for electoral abuse offered by absent voting (especially postal voting) and in particular by the standing arrangements made for those allowed an absent vote for an indefinite period. However, the Government's response was summed up as follows:

* First, apart from service voters and electors resident abroad, the right to apply for an absent vote for an indefinite period should in general be confined to those who are unable or likely to be unable to vote in person on polling day (or to vote unaided) through blindness or other physical incapacity. (The special arrangements for those unable to reach the polling station from their qualifying address without a sea or air journey would continue unchanged).
* Second, the right to apply for an absent vote at a particular Parliamentary, European Parliament or local election in Great Britain should be extended to all those who for whatever reason are unable or likely to be unable to vote in person on polling day. This would benefit holiday makers, people who are away in the course of employment and all other electors who although prevented from voting in person on polling day may not apply under existing provisions.
 
The ''Representation of the People Act 1985'' subsequently made provision for these extensions to the right to apply for an absent vote. The proposals did not apply to Northern Ireland where there was already widespread concern, shared by the Government, at the extent and nature of electoral abuse, including the abuse of postal voting. Further amendments were made to the rules governing absent voting in the ''[[Representation of the People Act 1989]]''.

By 1999 the system of postal and proxy voting for those unable to vote at polling stations was seen as cumbersome and complex. A Working Party on Electoral Procedures chaired by [[George Howarth]], Minister of State at the Home Office, published its report in October 1999. The working party recommended that

* Absent voting should be allowed on demand
*The application and voting procedures for absent voting should be simplified

The ''[[Representation of the People Act 2000]]'' implemented the Howarth report's recommendations. ''The Representation of the People (England &amp; Wales) Regulations 2001'' introduced the changes to the absent voting arrangements from 16 February 2001. The main change was to allow postal voting on demand.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.parliament.uk/briefing-papers/SN03667.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2001, any elector has been entitled to request a postal vote (known as ''postal voting on demand'') without giving a reason,&lt;ref name="House of Commons Library Research"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03667.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-05-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100423150329/http://www.parliament.uk/commons/lib/research/briefings/snpc-03667.pdf |archivedate=2010-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; apart from in [[Northern Ireland]], where postal voting is available only if it would be unreasonable to expect a voter to go to a polling station on polling day as a result of employment, disability or education restrictions. Prior to 2001, postal votes had been available since 1948 only to those unable to attend a polling station for reasons of ill health, employment or planned holiday away from home and to some electors living on small islands where they would need to cross water to reach their polling station. Before 1985, holidays were not a sufficient reason, and the employment criterion allowed only some professions.

====Procedure====

Registered voters who wish to vote by post must submit an additional application form to the Electoral Registration Officer at their [[local authority]] (or to the [[Electoral Office for Northern Ireland]] if in [[Northern Ireland]]) stating whether they want their ballot paper to be sent for one single election, all elections until a specified date or indefinitely. They must also submit their date of birth, and signature specimen on the form (or apply for a grant of a signature waiver due to a disability or inability to read or write&lt;ref&gt;[[Representation of the People Act 2000]], Schedule 4, Paragraphs 3(8), 4(5) and 7(11)&lt;/ref&gt;).  In addition, if a person eligible to vote in the [[United Kingdom]] is chosen by another voter to be his/her proxy, the proxy can apply to vote by post.  To receive a postal vote for an election, the postal vote application must have been received by the Electoral Registration Officer by 5 p.m. eleven working days before polling day.

Returning officers issue and despatch postal ballot packs at 5 p.m. on the eleventh working day before polling day at the earliest.  Issue of postal ballots is not open to the scrutiny of candidates and their agents; by law, only the returning officers, their staff, representatives of the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and observers accredited by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] are permitted to attend. Some returning officers produce postal ballot packs in house, whilst others outsource the process to an external company.

Each postal ballot pack contains inside the cover envelope a ballot paper, two envelopes ("A" and "B") and a postal voting statement. Postal ballots are printed on paper of a colour different from that of ballots issued in polling stations.  Postal ballot papers contain the following design, security and identification features on the reverse:&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 72&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 72&lt;/ref&gt;
*an official mark (e.g. a watermark or an official stamp)
*a unique identifying mark (e.g. a barcode which is different for each individual ballot paper)
*a unique identification number
When issuing each postal ballot paper, the officer marks on a list (called the '''corresponding number list''') next to the postal ballot's unique identification number the elector number of the voter to whom the postal ballot is sent, and then makes a mark next to the voter's name in a separate list of postal voters.  The unique identification number of the postal ballot paper is also marked on the postal voting statement sent within the postal ballot pack.  The local authority name and address and the name of the constituency/ward are printed on both envelopes "A" and "B".  Once all ballot papers for an election have been issued by the returning officer, the '''corresponding number list''' is sealed in a packet which can only be opened upon the order of a court when an election result is challenged.&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 75(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 75(1)&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon receipt of the postal ballot pack, the voter completes the ballot paper according to the instructions and seals it inside the envelope marked "A". A separate postal voting statement must be filled in by the voter with his/her date of birth and signature (unless a signature waiver has been granted or if the voter is an anonymous elector).  It is strongly recommended that postal voting statement and envelope "A" (containing the ballot paper) be placed and sealed inside the larger envelope "B" when returned, although this is not a requirement.  The vote can be posted back to the returning officer at the local authority address (postage is prepaid when returned from within the United Kingdom), or returned in person to the returning officer at the local authority office, or directly handed in to a polling station on polling day (but only one which is situated within the constituency/ward marked on envelopes "A"/"B").&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 79(1)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 79(1)(a)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the vote to be counted, it must ''reach'' the returning officer/polling station by the close of poll (usually 10 p.m. on polling day).

Upon receipt of a postal ballot pack in the post (or of the postal ballot paper and postal voting statement if sent separately), the returning officer places it inside the '''postal voters' ballot box''' allocated to the particular constituency/ward.  If a presiding officer receives a postal ballot pack in a polling station, it is sealed inside a packet which is later delivered to the returning officer at the close of poll together with a form recording the number of postal ballot packs received by the presiding officer.&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 79(3)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Representation of the People (Scotland) Regulations 2001, Section 79(2)&lt;/ref&gt;

Candidates and their agents, representatives of the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and observers accredited by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] and entitled to observe the opening of postal ballot packs - the returning officer must give candidates and their agents at least 48 hours' written notice of the time and location of every opening session of postal ballot packs.&lt;ref&gt;The Representation of the People (England and Wales) Regulations 2001, Section 80&lt;/ref&gt;  After emptying the '''postal voters' ballot box''', the postal voting statements and envelopes marked "A"/loose postal ballot papers are separated into two different groups.  The returning officer is required to verify the date of birth and signature filled in on at least 20% of the postal voting statements from each postal voters ballot box with the details provided on the original postal vote application forms.  If the details do not match, then the postal voting statement is rejected.  The returning officer makes a mark next to the name of the voter on the postal voters list for each postal voting statement received, even if it is selected for verification and rejected.  On a separate list, the returning officer must write down the unique identification numbers of postal voting statements which were chosen for verification and subsequently rejected.

The returning officer then compiles all loose postal ballot papers together with postal ballot papers having been removed from envelopes marked "A". The unique identification numbers of all rejected postal ballot papers are noted on a list.
The postal ballot papers are counted and finally placed in the '''postal ballot box(es)''', except for rejected postal ballot papers and postal ballot papers which have the same unique identification number as rejected postal voting statements.  The postal ballot box is securely sealed by the returning officer (candidates and agents can also apply their own seals).

At the count, the '''postal ballot boxes''' have their seals broken, are opened and then the postal ballot papers are counted.

Voters can contact the returning officer to check that their postal voting packs (or their postal voting statements and their postal ballot papers) have been received - however a response can only be given after an opening session since the returning officer will have to refer to the postal voters list.  At the end of an election, the marked postal voter lists are open for public inspection and also can be purchased by the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]], candidates, elected representatives, government departments, police forces, registered political parties and local constituency parties.

====Controversy====
There have been cases of electoral fraud with postal votes in the UK (including at the [[UK elections, 2004|2004 European and local government elections]] in Birmingham).&lt;ref name="Judge upholds vote-rigging claims"/&gt;&lt;ref name="politics.guardian.co.uk"/&gt;&lt;ref name="timesonline.co.uk"/&gt;

====All-postal voting pilots====
In 2000, the UK government passed legislation to permit local authorities to apply to pilot innovations in the method of voting at local elections (including all-postal voting, [[electronic voting]], and voting at weekends), with the first pilot elections being held in May that year.

In May 2000, 2002 and 2003, many local authorities piloted all-postal voting at their local elections. In May 2003, 35 local authorities did so. The outcome of those pilots was a recommendation from the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] that all-postal voting should be adopted as the normal method of voting at local elections in the UK. This reflected the positive impact on voter turnout at these elections (in some places, turnout doubled) and the fact that there was no evidence of an increase in [[electoral fraud]].

The local elections scheduled for May 2004 were postponed to June and combined with the European Parliament elections. The UK government used this opportunity to trial all-postal voting in these elections across four [[Regions of England|regions]]: [[North East England (European Parliament constituency)|North East]], [[North West England (European Parliament constituency)|North West]], [[East Midlands (European Parliament constituency)|East Midlands]], and [[Yorkshire and the Humber (European Parliament constituency)|Yorkshire and the Humber]].

The pilots did show a significant increase in turnout where postal voting was trialled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://online.liebertpub.com/doi/abs/10.1089/elj.2009.0059|title=Fewer Costs, More Votes?

The '''precautionary principle''' (or '''precautionary approach''') generally defines actions on issues considered to be uncertain, for instance applied in assessing [[risk management]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.environmentmagazine.org/Archives/Back%20Issues/2017/September-October%202017/precautionary-principle-full.html |title=The Precautionary Principle Under Fire |author=Rupert Read and Tim O'Riordan |date= |website=EnvironmentMagazine.org |publisher=[[Environment (magazine)|Environment]] |issue=September–October 2017 |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The principle is used by policy makers to justify discretionary decisions in situations where there is the possibility of harm from making a certain decision (e.g. taking a particular course of action) when extensive scientific knowledge on the matter is lacking. The principle implies that there is a [[social responsibility]] to protect the public from exposure to harm, when scientific investigation has found a plausible risk. These protections can be relaxed only if further scientific findings emerge that provide sound evidence that no harm will result.

In some legal systems, as in [[law of the European Union]], the application of the precautionary principle has been made a [[statutory]] requirement in some areas of law.&lt;ref&gt;Art. 191 (2) TFEU, Explanations Relating to the Charter of Fundamental Rights (2007/C 303/02, OJ EU C303/35 14.12.2007 explanation on article 52 (5) of the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights, T-13/99 Pfizer vs Council p.114-125&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding international conduct, the first endorsement of the principle was in 1982 when the [[World Charter for Nature]] was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]], while its first international implementation was in 1987 through the [[Montreal Protocol]]. Soon after, the principle integrated with many other legally binding international treaties such as the [[Rio Declaration]] and [[Kyoto Protocol]].

==Origins and theory==
The concept "precautionary principle" is generally considered to have arisen in English from a translation of the German term ''[[:de:Vorsorgeprinzip|Vorsorgeprinzip]]'' in the 1980s. In 1988, Konrad von Moltke described the German concept for a British audience, which he translated into English as the precautionary principle.&lt;ref name=Christiansen&gt;Sonja Boehmer Christiansen. The Precautionary Principle in Germany: Enabling Government.  Chapter 2 in [https://books.google.com/books?id=e4vjoqgeaIMC&amp;pg Interpreting the Precautionary Principle], eds Tim O'Riordan and James Cameron Earthscan Publications Ltd, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|31}}

The concepts underpinning the precautionary principle pre-date the term's inception. For example, the essence of the principle is captured in a number of cautionary [[aphorism]]s such as "an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure", "better safe than sorry", and "look before you leap". The precautionary principle may also be interpreted as the evolution of the "ancient-medical principle" of "[[Primum non nocere|first, do no harm]]" to apply to institutions and institutional decision-making processes rather than individuals.{{Citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for the whole sentence|date=September 2013}}

In economics, the Precautionary Principle has been analysed in terms of "the effect on rational decision-making", of "the interaction of [[irreversibility]]" and "[[uncertainty]]". Authors such as Epstein (1980)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/2526180 |author=Epstein, L.S. |title=Decision-making and the temporal resolution of uncertainty |jstor=2526180 |journal=International Economic Review |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=269–283 |year=1980 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Arrow and Fischer (1974)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.2307/1883074 |author1=Arrow, K.J.  |author2=Fischer, A.C. |title=Environmental preservation, uncertainty and irreversibility |jstor=1883074 |journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics |volume=88 |issue=2 |pages=312–9 |year=1974 }}&lt;/ref&gt; show that "irreversibility of possible future consequences" creates a "quasi-[[Option (finance)|option]] effect" which should induce a "[[risk]]-neutral" society to favour current decisions that allow for more flexibility in the future. Gollier et al. (2000)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/S0047-2727(99)00052-3 |author=Gollier, Christian, Bruno Jullien &amp; Nicolas Treich |title=Scientific Progress and Irreversibility: An Economic Interpretation of the 'Precautionary Principle' |journal=Journal of Public Economics |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=229–253 |year=2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; conclude that "more scientific uncertainty as to the distribution of a future risk – that is, a larger variability of beliefs – should induce society to take stronger prevention measures today" p245.

==Formulations==

Many definitions of the precautionary principle exist: Precaution may be defined as "caution in advance", "caution practised in the context of uncertainty", or informed [[prudence]]. Two ideas lie at the core of the principle:&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Jordan &amp; Timothy O'Riordan. Chapter 3, The precautionary principle: a legal and policy history, in [http://www.euro.who.int/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/91173/E83079.pdf The precautionary principle: protecting public health, the environment  and the future of our children]. Edited by: Marco Martuzzi and Joel A. Tickner. World Health Organization 2004&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}

#an expression of a need by decision-makers to anticipate harm before it occurs. Within this element lies an implicit reversal of the onus of proof: under the precautionary principle it is the responsibility of an activity-proponent to establish that the proposed activity will not (or is very unlikely to) result in significant harm.
#the concept of proportionality of the risk and the cost and feasibility of a proposed action

One of the primary foundations of the precautionary principle, and globally accepted definitions, results from the work of the [[Rio Conference]], or "[[Earth Summit]]" in 1992. The principle 15 of the [[Rio Declaration]] notes: "In order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall not be used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=78&amp;ArticleID=1163|title=Rio Declaration on Environment and Development|author=UNEP|publisher=|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1998 [[Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle|Wingspread Statement on the Precautionary Principle]] summarises the principle this way: "When an activity raises threats of harm to human health or the environment, precautionary measures should be taken even if some cause and effect relationships are not fully established scientifically."&lt;ref name="SEHN-Wingspread"&gt;Staff, Science and Environmental Health Network. 26 January 1998 [http://www.sehn.org/wing.html Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle]&lt;/ref&gt; The Wingspread Conference on the Precautionary Principle was convened by the Science and Environmental Health Network.&lt;ref name="SEHN-Wingspread"/&gt;

In February 2000, the [[Commission of the European Communities]] noted in a ''Communication from the Commission on the Precautionary Principle'' that, "The precautionary principle is not defined in the [[Treaties of the European Union]], which prescribes it [the Precautionary Principle] only once – to protect the environment. But in practice, its scope is much wider, and specifically where preliminary-objective-scientific-evaluation indicates that there are reasonable grounds for concern that potentially dangerous effects on the environment, human, animal or [and] plant health may be inconsistent with the high level of protection [for what] chosen for the Community."&lt;ref name=EU-Comm-PP&gt;Commission of the European Communities.  2 February 2000 [http://europa.eu/rapid/press-release_IP-00-96_en.htm Communication From The Commission on the Precautionary Principle]&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|10}}

The January 2000 [[Cartagena Protocol on Biosafety]] says, in regard to controversies over [[GMO]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s: "Lack of scientific certainty due to insufficient relevant scientific information ... shall not prevent the Party of [I]mport, in order to avoid or minimize such potential adverse effects, from taking a decision, as appropriate, with regard to the import of the living modified organism in question."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/doc/Treaties/2000/01/20000129%2008-44%20PM/Ch_XXVII_08_ap.pdf |title=Official text of the Cartagena Protocol |format=PDF |publisher=United Nations |date=29 January 2000 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}}

==Application==
The application of the precautionary principle is hampered by both lack of political will,{{Citation needed|date=March 2016}} as well as the wide range of interpretations placed on it. One study identified 14 different formulations of the principle in treaties and nontreaty declarations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last2=Vecchia|first2=Paolo|last3=Repacholi|first3=Michael H.|date=12 May 2000|title=Science and the Precautionary Principle|journal=Science|volume=288|issue=5468|pages=979–981|doi=10.1126/science.288.5468.979|issn=0036-8075|pmid=10841718|postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Stewart (2002)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stewart, R.B. |title=Environmental Regulatory Decision Making Under Uncertainty |journal=Research in Law and Economics |volume=20 |issue= |page=76 |year=2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced the precautionary principle to four basic versions:

# Scientific uncertainty should not automatically preclude regulation of activities that pose a potential risk of significant harm (Non-Preclusion PP).
# Regulatory controls should incorporate a margin of safety; activities should be limited below the level at which no adverse effect has been observed or predicted (Margin of Safety PP).
# Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be subject to best technology available requirements to minimise the risk of harm unless the proponent of the activity shows that they present no appreciable risk of harm (BAT PP).
# Activities that present an uncertain potential for significant harm should be prohibited unless the proponent of the activity shows that it presents no appreciable risk of harm (Prohibitory PP).

In deciding how to apply the principle, one may use a [[cost-benefit analysis]] that factors in both the [[opportunity cost]] of not acting, and the [[option value]] of waiting for further information before acting.{{cn|date=February 2018}} One of the difficulties of the application of the principle in modern{{vague|date=February 2018}} policy-making is that there is often an irreducible{{according to whom|date=February 2018}} conflict between different interests, so that the debate necessarily involves politics.{{cn|date=February 2018}}

=== Strong vs. weak ===
''Strong precaution'' holds that regulation is required whenever there is a possible risk to health, safety, or the environment, even if the supporting evidence is speculative and even if the economic costs of regulation are high.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Sachs | first = Noah M. |  title = Rescuing the Strong Precautionary Principle from its Critics | journal = University of Illinois Law Review | volume = 2011 | issue = 4 | pages = 1285–1338 | date =  | origyear = | year = 2011 | month = | url = http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2011/4/Sachs.pdf | jstor =  | doi =  | id =  | mr =  | zbl =  | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1295–96}}  In 1982, the United Nations [[World Charter for Nature]] gave the first international recognition to the strong version of the principle, suggesting that when "potential adverse effects are not fully understood, the activities should not proceed". The widely publicised Wingspread Declaration, from a meeting of environmentalists in 1998, is another example of the strong version.&lt;ref name="goliath.ecnext.com"&gt;"The paralyzing principle: Does the precautionary principle point us in any helpful direction?" Goliath Business Knowledge on Demand.

''Weak precaution'' holds that lack of scientific evidence does not preclude action if damage would otherwise be serious and irreversible.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Mandel | first = Gregory N. | author-link =  | last2 = Gathii | first2 = James Thuo | author2-link =  | title = Cost Benefit Analysis Versus the Precautionary Principle: Beyond Cass Sunstein's Laws of Fear | journal = University of Illinois Law Review | volume = 2006 | issue = 5 | pages = 1037–1079 | date = | origyear = | year = 2006 | month = | url = http://illinoislawreview.org/wp-content/ilr-content/articles/2006/5/Mandel.pdf | postscript = &lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

According to a publication by the [[New Zealand Treasury]] Department,

&lt;blockquote&gt; The weak version [of the Precautionary Principle] is the least restrictive and allows preventive measures to be taken in the face of uncertainty, but does not require them (eg, Rio Declaration 1992; United Nations Framework Convention of Climate Change 1992). To satisfy the threshold of harm, there must be some evidence relating to both the likelihood of occurrence and the severity of consequences. Some, but not all, require consideration of the costs of precautionary measures. Weak formulations do not preclude weighing benefits against the costs. Factors other than scientific uncertainty, including economic considerations, may provide legitimate grounds for postponing action. Under weak formulations, the requirement to justify the need for action (the burden of proof) generally falls on those advocating precautionary action. No mention is made of assignment of liability for environmental harm.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; Strong versions justify or require precautionary measures and some also establish liability for environmental harm, which is effectively a strong form of "polluter pays". For example, the [[Earth Charter]] states: "When knowledge is limited apply a precautionary approach ... Place the burden of proof on those who argue that a proposed activity will not cause significant harm, and make the responsible parties liable for environmental harm." Reversal of proof requires those proposing an activity to prove that the product, process or technology is sufficiently "safe" before approval is granted. Requiring proof of "no environmental harm" before any action proceeds implies the public is not prepared to accept any environmental risk, no matter what economic or social benefits may arise (Peterson, 2006). At the extreme, such a requirement could involve bans and prohibitions on entire classes of potentially threatening activities or substances (Cooney, 2005). Over time, there has been a gradual transformation of the precautionary principle from what appears in the Rio Declaration to a stronger form that arguably [by whom] acts as restraint on development in the absence of firm evidence that it will do no harm.&lt;ref&gt;"Precautionary Principle: Origins, definitions, and interpretations." Treasury Publication, Government of New Zealand. 2006. http://www.treasury.govt.nz/publications/research-policy/ppp/2006/06-06/05.htm&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== International agreements and declarations ===
The World Charter for Nature, which was adopted by the UN General Assembly in 1982, was the first international endorsement of the precautionary principle. The principle was implemented in an international treaty as early as the 1987 [[Montreal Protocol]], and among other international treaties and declarations is reflected in the 1992 [[Rio Declaration on Environment and Development]] (signed at the [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]]).

===="Principle" vs. "approach"====
&lt;blockquote&gt;No introduction to the precautionary principle would be complete without brief reference to the difference between the precautionary '''principle''' and the precautionary '''approach'''. Principle 15 of the Rio Declaration 1992 states that: "in order to protect the environment, the precautionary approach shall be widely applied by States according to their capabilities. Where there are threats of serious or irreversible damage, lack of full scientific certainty shall be not used as a reason for postponing cost-effective measures to prevent environmental degradation." As Garcia (1995) pointed out, "the wording, largely similar to that of the principle, is subtly different in that: (1) it recognizes that there may be differences in local capabilities to apply the approach, and (2) it calls for cost-effectiveness in applying the approach, e.g., taking economic and social costs into account." The 'approach' is generally considered a softening of the 'principle'.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As Recuerda has noted, the distinction between the 'precautionary principle' and a 'precautionary approach' is diffuse and, in some contexts, controversial. In the negotiations of international declarations, the United States has opposed the use of the term 'principle' because this term has special connotations in legal language, due to the fact that a 'principle of law` is a source of law. This means that it is compulsory, so a court can quash or confirm a decision through the application of the precautionary principle. In this sense, the precautionary principle is not a simple idea or a desideratum but a source of law. This is the legal status of the precautionary principle in the European Union. On the other hand, an 'approach' usually does not have the same meaning, although in some particular cases an approach could be binding. A precautionary approach is a particular 'lens' used to identify risk that every prudent person possesses (Recuerda, 2008)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Recuerda, M. A. |title=Dangerous interpretations of the precautionary principle and the foundational values of the European Union Food Law: Risk versus Risk |journal=Journal of Food Law &amp; Policy |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages= |year=2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

====European Union====
On 2 February 2000, the [[European Commission]] issued a Communication on the precautionary principle,&lt;ref name=EU-Comm-PP/&gt; in which it adopted a procedure for the application of this concept, but without giving a detailed definition of it. Paragraph 2 of article 191 of the [[Lisbon Treaty]] states that

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Union policy on the environment shall aim at a high level of protection taking into account the diversity of situations in the various regions of the Union. It shall be based on the precautionary principle and on the principles that preventive action should be taken, that environmental damage should as a priority be rectified at source and that the polluter should pay."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=OJ:C:2016:202:FULL&amp;from=EN Consolidated Version of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union] article 191, paragraph 2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

After the adoption of the European Commission's Communication on the precautionary principle, the principle has come to inform much EU policy, including areas beyond [[environmental policy]]. As of 2006 it had been integrated into EU laws "in matters such as general product safety, the use of additives for use in animal nutrition, the incineration of waste, and the regulation of genetically modified organisms".&lt;ref name=Recuerda&gt;{{cite journal |author=Recuerda, Miguel A. |title=Risk and Reason in the European Union Law |journal=European Food and Feed Law Review |volume=5 |issue= |pages= |year=2006 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|282–83}}   Through its application in [[case law]], it has become a "general principle of EU law".&lt;ref name=Recuerda/&gt;{{rp|283}}

In Case T-74/00 ''Artegodan''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:62000TJ0074|title=EUR-Lex - 62000TJ0074 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;, the [[General Court (European Union)|General Court]] (then Court of First Instance) appeared willing to extrapolate from the limited provision for the [[precautionary principle]] in [[environmental policy]] in Article 191(2) [[TFEU]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:12008E191|title=EUR-Lex - 12008E191 - EN - EUR-Lex|website=eur-lex.europa.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt; to a general principle of EU law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Craig| first1 = Paul| last2=de Búrca|first2 = Gráinne |title = EU law: text, cases, and materials| publisher = Oxford University Press| edition = sixth| year = 2015| pages = 112–113 | url = | isbn = 978-0-19-871492-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== France ====

In France, the [[Charter for the Environment]] contains a formulation of the precautionary principle (article 5):
{{Block quote|When the occurrence of any damage, albeit unpredictable in the current state of scientific knowledge, may seriously and irreversibly harm the environment, public authorities shall, with due respect for the principle of precaution and the areas within their jurisdiction, ensure the implementation of procedures for risk assessment and the adoption of temporary measures commensurate with the risk involved in order to preclude the occurrence of such damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.conseil-constitutionnel.fr/conseil-constitutionnel/root/bank_mm/anglais/charter_environnement.pdf ''Charter for the Environment''], [[Constitutional Council (France)|Constitutional Council]] (page visited on 28 August 2016).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====United States====
On 18 July 2005, the City of San Francisco passed a Precautionary Principle Purchasing ordinance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14134&amp;sid=5 Municode] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205100244/http://www.municode.com/Resources/gateway.asp?pid=14134&amp;sid=5 |date=5 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which requires the city to weigh the environmental and health costs of its $600&amp;nbsp;million in annual purchases – for everything from cleaning supplies to computers. Members of the Bay Area Working Group on the Precautionary Principle including the [[Breast Cancer Fund]], helped bring this to fruition.

====Japan====
In 1997, Japan tried to use the consideration of the precautionary principle in a WTO SPS [[Agreement on the Application of Sanitary and Phytosanitary Measures]] case, as Japan's requirement to test each variety of agricultural products (apples, cherries, peaches, walnuts, apricots, pears, plums and quinces) for the efficacy of treatment against codling moths was challenged.

This moth is a pest that does not occur in Japan, and whose introduction has the potential to cause serious damage. The United States claimed that it was not necessary to test each variety of a fruit for the efficacy of the treatment, and that this varietal testing requirement was unnecessarily burdensome.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

====Australia====
The most important Australian court case so far, due to its exceptionally detailed consideration of the precautionary principle, is Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council.&lt;ref&gt;[2006] NSWLEC 133 (24 March 2006) [http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/cases/nsw/NSWLEC/2006/133.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

The Principle was summarised by reference to the [[New South Wales|NSW]] ''Protection of the Environment Administration Act 1991'', which itself provides a good definition of the principle:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/nsw/consol_act/poteaa1991485/s6.html|title=PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT ADMINISTRATION ACT 1991 - SECT 6 Objectives of the Authority|website=www.austlii.edu.au|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"If there are threats of serious or irreversible environmental damage, lack of full scientific certainty should not be used as a reasoning for postponing measures to prevent environmental degradation. In the application of the principle… decisions should be guided by:
(i) careful evaluation to avoid, wherever practicable, serious or irreversible damage to the environment; and
(ii) an assessment of risk-weighted consequence of various options".

The most significant points of Justice Preston's decision are the following findings:&lt;ref&gt;Hon. Justice Brian J Preston, (2006), 'Telstra Corporation Limited v Hornsby Shire Council [2006] NSWLEC 133', ''Land and Environment Court of New South Wales''. Paragraphs 125-183. https://www.caselaw.nsw.gov.au/decision/549f8a6b3004262463ad5606&lt;/ref&gt;
# The principle and accompanying need to take precautionary measures is "triggered" when two prior conditions exist: a threat of serious or irreversible damage, and scientific uncertainty as to the extent of possible damage.
# Once both are satisfied, "a proportionate precautionary measure may be taken to avert the anticipated threat of environmental damage, but it should be proportionate."
# The threat of serious or irreversible damage should invoke consideration of five factors: the scale of threat (local, regional etc.); the perceived value of the threatened environment; whether the possible impacts are manageable; the level of public concern, and whether there is a rational or scientific basis for the concern.
# The consideration of the level of scientific uncertainty should involve factors which may include: what would constitute sufficient evidence; the level and kind of uncertainty; and the potential to reduce uncertainty.
# The principle shifts the burden of proof. If the principle applies, the burden shifts: "a decision maker must assume the threat of serious or irreversible environmental damage is… a reality [and] the burden of showing this threat… is negligible reverts to the proponent…"
# The precautionary principle invokes preventative action: "the principle permits the taking of preventative measures without having to wait until the reality and seriousness of the threat become fully known".
# "The precautionary principle should not be used to try to avoid all risks."
# The precautionary measures appropriate will depend on the combined effect of "the degree of seriousness and irreversibility of the threat and the degree of uncertainty… the more significant and uncertain the threat, the greater…the precaution required". "…measures should be adopted… proportionate to the potential threats".

The [[Body Shop|Body Shop International]], a UK-based cosmetics company, included the precautionary principle in their 2006 Chemicals Strategy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thebodyshopinternational.com/NR/rdonlyres/D7F2A9D1-416A-47B8-8BC3-1E858A37F81C/0/BSI_Chemicals_Strategy.pdf |title=Chemicals Strategy |publisher=The Body Shop |date=August 2006 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Environment and health ===
Fields typically concerned by the precautionary principle are the possibility of:
* [[Global warming]] or [[abrupt climate change]] in general
* [[Extinction]] of species
* Introduction of new and potentially harmful products into the environment, threatening [[biodiversity]] (e.g., [[genetically modified organisms]])
* Threats to [[public health]], due to new diseases and techniques (e.g., HIV transmitted through blood transfusion)
* Long-term effects of new technologies (e.g. [[Mobile phone radiation and health|health concerns regarding radiation from cell phones]] and other electronics communications devices)
* Persistent or acute pollution (e.g., [[asbestos]], [[endocrine disruptors]])
* Food safety (e.g., [[Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease]])
* Other new [[biosafety]] issues (e.g., [[artificial life]], new [[molecule]]s)

The precautionary principle is often applied to [[biology|biological]] fields because changes cannot be easily [[containment|contained]] and have the potential of being global. The principle has less relevance to contained fields such as [[aeronautics]], where the few people undergoing [[risk]] have given [[informed consent]] (e.g., a [[test pilot]]). In the case of technological innovation, containment of impact tends to be more difficult if that technology can self-replicate. [[Bill Joy]] emphasised the dangers of replicating genetic technology, nanotechnology, and robotic technology in his article in ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'', "[[Why the future doesn't need us]]", though he does not specifically cite the precautionary principle. The application of the principle can be seen in the public policy of requiring [[pharmaceutical industry|pharmaceutical companies]] to carry out [[clinical trial]]s to show that new [[medications]] are safe.

Oxford based philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] discusses the idea of a future powerful [[superintelligence]], and the risks that we/it face should it attempt to gain atomic level control of matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nick Bostrom]] 2003 Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence – section 2&lt;/ref&gt;

Application of the principle modifies the status of innovation and [[risk assessment]]: it is not the risk that must be avoided or amended, but a potential risk that must be prevented. Thus, in the case of regulation of scientific research, there is a third party beyond the scientist and the regulator: the consumer.

In an analysis concerning application of the precautionary principle to [[nanotechnology]], Chris Phoenix and Mike Treder posit that there are ''two forms'' of the principle, which they call the "strict form" and the "active form".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.crnano.org/precautionary.htm |title=Nanotechnology: Precautionary Principle Analyzed |publisher=Center for Responsible Nanotechnology |date=January 2004 |accessdate=12 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The former "requires inaction when action might pose a risk", while the latter means "choosing less risky alternatives when they are available, and [...] taking responsibility for potential risks." [[Thomas Alured Faunce]] has argued for stronger application of the precautionary principle by chemical and health technology regulators particularly in relation to Ti0&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ZnO nanoparticles in [[sunscreens]], biocidal nanosilver in waterways and products whose manufacture, handling or recycling exposes humans to the risk of inhaling multi-walled carbon nanotubes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Faunce TA, etal |title=Sunscreen Safety: The Precautionary Principle, The Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration and Nanoparticles in Sunscreens |journal=Nanoethics |volume=2 |issue= 3|pages=231–240 |year=2008 |doi=10.1007/s11569-008-0041-z |url=http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf |format=PDF |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110228183131/http://law.anu.edu.au/StaffUploads/236-Nanoethics%20Sunscreens%202008.pdf |archivedate=28 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resource management ===

Several natural resources like fish stocks are now managed by precautionary approach, through [[Harvest Control Rules]] (HCR) based upon the precautionary principle. The figure indicates how the principle is implemented in the [[cod]] fisheries management proposed by the [[International Council for the Exploration of the Sea]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

In classifying [[endangered species]], the precautionary principle means that if there is doubt about an animal's or plant's exact [[Wikipedia:Conservation status|conservation status]], the one that would cause the strongest protective measures to be realised should be chosen. Thus, a species like the [[silvery pigeon]] that might exist in considerable numbers and simply be under-recorded or might just as probably be long extinct is not classified as "data deficient" or "extinct" (which both do not require any protective action to be taken), but as "critically endangered" (the conservation status that confers the need for the strongest protection), whereas the increasingly rare, but probably not yet endangered [[emerald starling]] is classified as "data deficient", because there is urgent need for research to clarify its status rather than for conservation action to save it from extinction.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

If, for example, a large ground-water body that people use for drinking water is contaminated by bacteria (e-coli 0157 H7, campylobacter or leptospirosis) and the source of contamination is strongly suspected to be dairy cows but the exact science is not yet able to provide absolute proof, the cows should be removed from the environment until they are proved, by the dairy industry, not to be the source or until that industry ensures that such contamination will not recur.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

==Criticisms==
Critics of the principle use arguments similar to those against other formulations of technological conservatism.

===Internal inconsistency: applying strong PP risks causing harm===
Strong formulations of the precautionary principle, without regard to its most basic provisions that it is to be applied only where risks are potentially high AND not easily calculable, applied to the principle itself as a policy decision, may rule out its own use.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"/&gt;{{rp|26ff}}  The reason suggested is that preventing innovation from coming to market means that only current technology may be used, and current technology itself may cause harm or leave needs unmet; there is a risk of causing harm by blocking innovation.&lt;ref name = Guardian&gt;Brown, Tracey (9 July 2013)[https://www.theguardian.com/science/political-science/2013/jul/09/precautionary-principle-blunt-instrument The precautionary principle is a blunt instrument] ''[[The Guardian]]'', Retrieved 9 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sherry Seethaler.  [https://books.google.com/books/about/Lies_Damned_Lies_and_Science.html?id=NYdiqDdot4kC Lies, Damned Lies, and Science: How to Sort through the Noise around Global Warming, the Latest Health Claims, and Other Scientific Controversies] FT Press, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Michael Crichton]] wrote in his novel ''[[State of Fear]]'': "The 'precautionary principle', properly applied, forbids the precautionary principle."&lt;ref name=CAST52&gt;Merchant, G et al. [http://www.cast-science.org/download.cfm?PublicationID=276208&amp;File=1030ac6763c4d6f3918b92e5a1345c4b8024TR Impact of the Precautionary Principle on Feeding Current and Future Generations] CAST Issue Paper 52, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; For example, forbidding nuclear power plants based on concerns about risk means continuing to rely on power plants that burn fossil fuels, which continue to release [[greenhouse gas]]es.&lt;ref name="Beyond Laws of Fear"/&gt;{{rp|27}}  In another example, the Hazardous Air Pollutant provisions in the [[Clean Air Act (1990)|1990 amendments to the US Clean Air Act]] are an example of the Precautionary Principle where the onus is now on showing a listed compound is harmless. Under this rule no distinction is made between those air Pollutants that provide a higher or lower risk, so operators tend to choose less-examined agents that are not on the existing list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Goldstein BD, Carruth RS |title=Implications of the Precautionary Principle: is it a threat to science? |journal=Int J Occup Med Environ Health |volume=17 |issue=1 |pages=153–61 |year=2004 |pmid=15212219 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blocking innovation and progress generally===
{{See also|Fear, uncertainty and doubt}}
Because applications of strong formulations of the precautionary principle can be used to block innovation, a technology which brings advantages may be banned by precautionary principle because of its potential for negative impacts, leaving the positive benefits unrealised.&lt;ref name="Sunstein"&gt;Sunstein, Cass R. [http://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv25n4/v25n4-9.pdf The Paralyzing Principle: Does the Precautionary Principle Point us in any Helpful Direction?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070215223946/https://www.cato.org/pubs/regulation/regv25n4/v25n4-9.pdf |date=15 February 2007 }} Regulation, Winter 2002–2003, The Cato Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[David Deutsch]],

The precautionary principle has been ethically questioned on the basis that its application could block progress in developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jimenez-Arias|first=Luis G.|title=Biothics and the Environment|year=2008|publisher=Libros en Red|page=73|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=es&amp;lr=&amp;id=YLjDG6sUaRkC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PA8&amp;dq=luis+g+jimenez+arias+biothics&amp;ots=Qx7QyjuLW7&amp;sig=OoR3qRZndxSoUcS-M7KSLLo1qBY#v=onepage&amp;q=luis%20g%20jimenez%20arias%20biothics&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vagueness and plausibility===
The precautionary principle calls for action in the face of scientific uncertainty, but some formulations do not specify the minimal threshold of plausibility of risk that acts as a "triggering" condition, so that any indication that a proposed product or activity might harm health or the environment is sufficient to invoke the principle.&lt;ref name="vandenBelt"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1104/pp.103.023531 |author=van den Belt H |title=Debating the Precautionary Principle: "Guilty until Proven Innocent" or "Innocent until Proven Guilty"? |journal=Plant Physiol. |volume=132 |issue=3 |pages=1122–6 |date=July 2003 |pmid=12857792 |pmc=526264 |url=http://www.plantphysiol.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=12857792}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, Ronald. [http://www.reason.com/news/show/30977.html Precautionary Tale]. Reason. April 1999&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Sancho vs. [[United States Department of Energy|DOE]]'', Helen Gillmor, Senior District Judge, wrote in a dismissal of Wagner's lawsuit which included a popular&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/science/science-news/3351119/Scientists-get-death-threats-over-Large-Hadron-Collider.html|title=Scientists get death threats over Large Hadron Collider|author=Roger Highfield, Science Editor|date=5 September 2008|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; worry that the [[Large Hadron Collider|LHC]] could cause "destruction of the earth" by a [[black hole]]:
:Injury in fact requires some "credible threat of harm." ''Cent. Delta Water Agency v. United States'', 306 F.3d 938, 950 (9th Cir. 2002). At most, Wagner has alleged that experiments at the Large Hadron Collider (the "Collider") have "potential adverse consequences."

The '''Protocol to Prevent, Suppress and Punish Trafficking in Persons, Especially Women and Children''' (also referred to as the '''Trafficking Protocol''' or '''UN TIP Protocol''') is a [[Protocol (diplomacy)|protocol]] to the [[Convention against Transnational Organised Crime]]. It is one of the three [[Palermo protocols]], the others being the [[Protocol against the Smuggling of Migrants by Land, Sea and Air]] and the [[Protocol against the Illicit Manufacturing and Trafficking in Firearms]].

The protocol was adopted by the [[United Nations General Assembly]] in 2000 and entered into force on December 25, 2003. As of February 2018, it has been ratified by 173 parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://treaties.un.org/Pages/ViewDetails.aspx?src=TREATY&amp;mtdsg_no=XVIII-12-a&amp;chapter=18&amp;lang=en |title=UNODC – Signatories to the CTOC Trafficking Protocol |publisher=Treaties.un.org |date= |accessdate=16 Mar 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] (UNODC) is responsible for implementing the protocol. It offers practical help to states with drafting laws, creating comprehensive national anti-trafficking strategies, and assisting with resources to implement them. In March 2009, UNODC launched the [[Blue Heart Campaign]] to fight human trafficking, to [[raising awareness|raise awareness]], and to encourage involvement and inspire action.

The protocol commits ratifying states to prevent and combat trafficking in persons, protecting and assisting victims of trafficking and promoting cooperation among states in order to meet those objectives.

== Content of the protocol ==
The protocol covers the following:

*Defining the crime of [[trafficking in human beings]]; To be considered trafficking in persons, a situation must meet three conditions: act (i.e., recruitment), means (i.e., through the use of force or deception) and purpose (i.e., for the purpose of forced labour)

::''"Trafficking in persons" shall mean the recruitment, transportation, transfer, harbouring or receipt of persons, by means of the threat or use of force or other forms of coercion, of abduction, of fraud, of deception, of the abuse of power or of a position of vulnerability or of the giving or receiving of payments or benefits to achieve the consent of a person having control over another person, for the purpose of exploitation. Exploitation shall include, at a minimum, the exploitation of the prostitution of others or other forms of sexual exploitation, forced labour or services, slavery or practices similar to slavery, servitude or the removal of organs... The consent of a victim of trafficking in persons to the intended exploitation set forth [above] shall be irrelevant where any of the means set forth [above] have been used.''

*Facilitating the return and acceptance of children who have been victims of cross-border trafficking, with due regard to their safety
*Prohibiting the [[trafficking of children]] (which is defined as being a person under 18 years of age) for purposes of [[commercial sexual exploitation of children]] (CSEC), exploitative labour practices, or the removal of body parts
*Suspending parental rights of parents, caregivers, or any other persons who have parental rights in respect of a child should they be found to have trafficked a child
*Ensuring that definitions of trafficking reflect the need for special safeguards and care for children, including appropriate legal protection
*Ensuring that trafficked persons are not punished for any offences or activities related to their having been trafficked, such as prostitution and immigration violations
*Ensuring that victims of trafficking are protected from deportation or return where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that such return would represent a significant security risk to the trafficked person or their family
*Considering temporary or permanent residence in countries of transit or destination for trafficking victims in exchange for testimony against alleged traffickers, or on humanitarian and compassionate grounds
*Providing for proportional criminal penalties to be applied to persons found guilty of trafficking in aggravating circumstances, including offences involving trafficking in children or offences committed or involving complicity by state officials
*Providing for the confiscation of the instruments and proceeds of trafficking and related offences to be used for the benefit of trafficked persons

The convention and the protocol obligate ratifying states to introduce national trafficking legislation.

==Regional action against trafficking in human beings==
In [[Warsaw]] on 16 May 2005, the [[Council of Europe]] [[Convention on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings]] was opened for accession. The convention established a Group of Experts on Action against Trafficking in Human Beings (GRETA) which monitors the implementation of the convention through country reports. It has been ratified (as of January 2016) by 45 European states, while a further one state (Turkey) has signed but not yet ratified it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.coe.int/ro/web/conventions/full-list/-/conventions/treaty/197/signatures?p_auth=Gn9RcCwG&lt;/ref&gt;

Complementary protection is ensured through the Council of Europe [[Convention on the Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse]] ([[Lanzarote]], 25 Oct 2007).

In addition, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] of the [[Council of Europe]] in [[Strasbourg]] has passed judgments involving trafficking in human beings which violated obligations under the [[European Convention on Human Rights]]: ''Siliadin v France'', judgment of 26 July 2005, and ''Rantsev v Cyprus and Russia'', judgment of 7 January 2010.

The Council of Europe co-operates closely with the United Nations.

[[Thailand]]'s '''Psychotropic Substances Act''' is a law designed to regulate certain mind-altering drugs. According to the Office of the Narcotics Control Board, "The Act directly resulted from the [[Convention on Psychotropic Substances]] 1971 of which Thailand is a party." The Act divides psychotropic drugs into four Schedules. Offenses involving Schedule I and II drugs carry heavier penalties than those involving Schedule III and IV drugs. Note that this statute does not regulate most [[opioid]]s, [[cocaine]], or some [[amphetamines]]. The vast majority of narcotic painkillers, along with cocaine and most amphetamines are regulated under the '''Narcotics Act'''.

'''Public liability''' is part of the law of [[tort]] which focuses on civil wrongs. An applicant (the injured party) usually sues the respondent (the owner or occupier) under [[common law]] based on negligence and/or damages.  Claims are usually successful when it can be shown that the owner/occupier was responsible for an injury, therefore they breached their duty of care.

The [[duty of care]] is very complex, but in basic terms it is the standard by which one would expect to be treated whilst one is in the care of another.

Once a breach of duty of care has been established, an action brought in a common law court would most likely be successful.  Based on the injuries and the losses of the applicant the court would award a financial compensation package.

== The law of insurance and public liability ==
In the course of managing any property, you are obliged to comply with laws and statutes administered by government and municipal bodies. These bodies impose various liabilities of which the property owner/manager should be aware.

The most common examples of statute liability are in areas where you are required by law to effect insurance, e.g. [[workers' compensation]] and motor vehicle compulsory third party.

Property, hotel and operations managers should become familiar with the various types of contracts involved in commercial and retail activities.  These cover a wide field but the more significant contracts are:
*the head lease or the management agreements
*tenancy and casual leasing agreements
*contracts with independent contractors for cleaning, lift and escalator maintenance, air conditioning and fire protection maintenance, etc.

The major contractual liability from an insurance viewpoint is undoubtedly found in head lease and management agreements.  These require the manager or head lessee to fully maintain, repair and replace the property, if damaged, until expiration of the agreement or lease.

Furthermore, the contracts usually require an indemnity to the owner against liabilities imposed upon the business for injuries and property damage arising out of the use, occupation or management of the property.

Every contract contains covenants imposing responsibilities on one or other of the parties.  These should be carefully examined to ensure they are not unduly onerous

== Degrees of duty of care ==
Owner/occupiers are required to provide a certain level of care.  The duty of care is not the same for all people.  It is dependent on a number of issues.  To assist in establishing the duty of care required it is more clear to divide into groups the individuals who your premises and for what reasons.  If we take an example of a large shopping complex the following groups of individuals would attract different levels of care.

=== Invitees ===
These are people who by some form you have invited into your complex.  This invitation can be through marketing and advertising, or it can be implied simply because you are a shopping complex or hotel.  The greatest duty of care is owed to invitees who, in the case of shopping centres and hotels, are mainly customers, contractors and sub contractors.  They are there because of the invitation you extend to them.  The duty of care owed to them is relatively simple.

You must take reasonable care to ensure the premises are safe.  They in turn must take reasonable care for their own safety.

If however an invitee spends money for a service, i.e. forms a contract with you, your duty of care is increased.  An example of this could be a games arcade where the invitee pays for a ride on a motorcycle game.  If as a result of playing this game the invitee is electrocuted, you have breached your duty of care and will most likely be found to be liable for any damages.

If, however, the reason for the electrocution was not due to your negligence but a [[product defect]], and you have done all that is reasonably expected of an arcade owner to detect and fix this defect, you may proceed to sue the supplier of the game. This is because the supplier also owns a duty of care to the arcade owner as well as a contractual duty to provide safe, functioning equipment.

=== Licensees ===
These are people who enter premises with the permission of the occupier but, unlike invitees, do so without any economic advantage to the occupier.  They come in the hope of doing business with you or your tenants and include such people as salesmen, commercial travellers, etc.  The duty of care owed to licensees are not quite as extreme as in the case of the invitees.

=== Trespassers ===
These are classified as people who intrude onto property without permission.  The degree of care owed to trespassers, although slight, nevertheless exists particularly in situations where a source of danger is deliberately created or where small children are involved. An example would be where live wires were left exposed after the centre had closed.  If some children entered the premises for some reason, despite that reason, if they were injured the owner of the centre would be liable.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2852">The '''Rail Passenger Rights Regulation 2007''' (EC) [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/ALL/?uri=CELEX:32007R1371 No 1371/2007] gives railway passengers basic rights in [[EU law]] to refunds and minimum levels of service. It has mandatory application, without implementing legislation. Before this many countries, such as the [[UK enterprise law|United Kingdom]], had no rights set in law for rail passengers. The Regulation creates minimum rights which every member state law, and every rail undertaking, may improve upon. 

New EU rail rules which came into place in November 2018 however risk undermining these existing passenger rail rights. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= New EU Rail Rules Threaten UK Passenger Rights |url=http://conservativeeurope.com/news/new-eu-rail-rules-threaten-uk-passenger-rights |work= Conservative Europe |date=20 November 2018|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[public choice theory]] and in economics, '''rent-seeking''' involves seeking to increase one's share of existing wealth without creating new wealth. Rent-seeking results in reduced economic efficiency through poor [[allocation of resources]], reduced actual wealth-creation, lost government revenue, increased income inequality,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0115.pdf |title=Rent-seeking and Endogenous Income Inequality |author=IMF |accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and (potentially) national decline.

Attempts at [[regulatory capture|capture of regulatory agencies]] to gain a [[coercive monopoly]] can result in advantages for the rent seeker in a market while imposing disadvantages on (incorrupt) competitors. This constitutes one of many possible forms of rent-seeking behavior.

==Description==
The idea of rent-seeking was developed by [[Gordon Tullock]] in 1967,&lt;ref name="liblib"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/RentSeeking.html |title=Rent Seeking |author=David R. Henderson |authorlink=David R. Henderson |publisher=[[Econlib.org]]}}&lt;!-- This is an original essay by Henderson, not available via other sources. --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; while the expression ''rent-seeking'' itself was coined in 1974 by [[Anne Krueger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Krueger |first=Anne |year=1974 |title=The Political Economy of the Rent-Seeking Society |journal=American Economic Review |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=291–303 |jstor=1808883}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word "rent" does not refer specifically to payment on a lease but rather to [[Adam Smith]]'s division of incomes into [[Profit (economics)|profit]], wage, and [[economic rent|rent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rentseeking.asp |title=Rent-Seeking |date=25 November 2003 |newspaper=Investopedia  |access-date=27 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The origin of the term refers to gaining control of [[land (economics)|land]] or other natural resources.

[[Georgist]] economic theory describes rent-seeking in terms of land rent, where the value of land largely comes from government infrastructure and services (e.g. roads, public schools, maintenance of peace and order, etc.) and the community in general, rather than from the actions of any given landowner, in their role as mere titleholder. This role must be separated from the role of a [[property developer]], which need not be the same person.

''Rent-seeking'' is an attempt to obtain [[economic rent]] (i.e., the portion of income paid to a [[factor of production]] in excess of what is needed to keep it employed in its current use) by manipulating the social or political environment in which economic activities occur, rather than by [[value added|creating new wealth]]. Rent-seeking implies extraction of uncompensated value from others without making any contribution to [[productivity (economics)|productivity]]. The classic example of rent-seeking, according to [[Robert Shiller]], is that of a feudal lord who installs a chain across a river that flows through his land and then hires a collector to charge passing boats a fee (or rent of the section of the river for a few minutes) to lower the chain. There is nothing productive about the chain or the collector. The lord has made no improvements to the river and is not adding value in any way, directly or indirectly, except for himself. All he is doing is finding a way to make money from something that used to be free.&lt;ref&gt;[[Robert Shiller]]. [http://www.project-syndicate.org/commentary/the-rent-seeking-problem-in-contemporary-finance-by-robert-j--shiller The Best, Brightest and Least Productive?], [[Project Syndicate]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In many market-driven economies, much of the competition for rents is legal, regardless of harm it may do to an economy. However, some rent-seeking competition is illegal – such as bribery or corruption.

Rent-seeking is distinguished in theory from [[Profit (economics)|profit-seeking]], in which entities seek to extract value by engaging in mutually beneficial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ingrimayne.saintjoe.edu/econ/government/RentSeeking.html |title=Rent Seeking |author=Robert Schenk |work=CyberEconomics |accessdate=11 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060103062417/http://ingrimayne.saintjoe.edu/econ/government/RentSeeking.html |archivedate=3 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Profit-seeking in this sense is the creation of wealth, while rent-seeking is "profiteering" by using social institutions, such as the power of the state, to redistribute wealth among different groups without creating new wealth.&lt;ref&gt;Conybeare, John A. C. (1982). "The Rent-Seeking State &amp; Revenue Diversification," World Politics, 35(1): 25–42.&lt;/ref&gt; In a practical context, income obtained through rent-seeking may contribute to [[Profit (accounting)|profits in the standard, accounting sense of the word]].

===Tullock paradox===
'''Tullock paradox''' refers to the apparent [[paradox]], described by Tullock, on the low costs of rent-seeking relative to the gains from rent-seeking.&lt;ref name="tullock1980"&gt;{{cite |last=Tullock|first=Gordon |year=1980 |chapter=Efficient rent-seeking |title=Toward a theory of the rent-seeking society |editors=Buchanan, J.; Tollison, R.; and Tullock, G. |publisher=Texas A&amp;M Press |place=College Station |pages=97–112
}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="connes"&gt;{{cite web |ssrn=467901 |title=Loss Aversion and the Tullock Paradox |last=Connes |first=Richard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The paradox is that rent-seekers wanting political favors can bribe politicians at a cost much lower than the value of the favor to the rent-seeker. For instance, a rent seeker who hopes to gain a billion dollars from a particular political policy may need to bribe politicians only to the tune of ten million dollars, which is about 1% of the gain to the rent-seeker.  [[Luigi Zingales]] frames it by asking, "Why is there so little money in politics?" because a naive model of political bribery and/or campaign spending should result in beneficiaries of government subsidies being willing to spend an amount up to the value of the subsidies themselves, when in fact only a small fraction of that is spent.

====Possible explanations====
Several possible explanations have been offered for the Tullock paradox:&lt;ref name=Zingales&gt;{{Citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8rCZAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA75 |title=A Capitalism for the People: Recapturing the Lost Genius of American Prosperity |first=Luigi |last=Zingales |publisher=Basic Books |year=2014 |ISBN=9780465038701 |pages=75–78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# Voters may punish politicians who take large bribes, or live lavish lifestyles. This makes it hard for politicians to demand large bribes from rent-seekers.
# Competition between different politicians eager to offer favors to rent-seekers may bid down the cost of rent-seeking.
# Lack of trust between the rent-seekers and the politicians, due to the inherently underhanded nature of the deal and the unavailability of both legal recourse and reputational incentives to enforce compliance, pushes down the price that politicians can demand for favors.

===Examples===
An example of rent-seeking in a modern economy is spending money on lobbying for government subsidies in order to be given wealth that has already been created, or to impose regulations on competitors, in order to increase market share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sample |first1=John |title=An Introduction to Rent Seeking |url=http://www.libertarianism.org/blog/introduction-rent-seeking}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of rent-seeking is the limiting of access to lucrative occupations, as by medieval [[guild]]s or modern state certifications and [[licensure]]s. [[Taxicab|Taxi]] licensing is a textbook example of rent-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McTaggart |first1=Douglas |title=Economics |date=2012 |publisher=Pearson Higher Education |isbn=978-1-4425-5077-3 |page=224}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the extent that the issuing of licenses constrains overall supply of taxi services (rather than ensuring competence or quality), forbidding competition by [[vehicle for hire|livery vehicles]], unregulated taxis and/or [[Illegal taxicab operation|illegal taxis]] renders the (otherwise consensual) transaction of taxi service a forced transfer of part of the fee, from customers to taxi business proprietors.

The concept of rent-seeking would also apply to corruption of bureaucrats who solicit and extract "bribe" or "rent" for applying their legal but discretionary authority for awarding legitimate or illegitimate benefits to clients.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Chowdhury |first=Faizul Latif |year=2006 |title=Corrupt Bureaucracy and Privatization of Tax Enforcement |publisher=Pathak Shamabesh, Dhaka |isbn=984-8120-62-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, tax officials may take bribes for lessening the tax burden of the taxpayers.

[[Regulatory capture]] is a related term for the collusion between firms and the government agencies assigned to regulate them, which is seen as enabling extensive rent-seeking behavior, especially when the government agency must rely on the firms for knowledge about the market. Studies of rent-seeking focus on efforts to capture special [[coercive monopoly|monopoly privileges]] such as manipulating government regulation of [[Capitalism|free enterprise]] competition.&lt;ref&gt;Feenstra, Robert; Taylor, Alan (2008). ''International Economics''. Worth Publishers, New York. {{ISBN|978-0-7167-9283-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''monopoly privilege rent-seeking'' is an often-used label for this particular type of rent-seeking. Often-cited examples include a lobby that seeks economic regulations such as [[tariff]] protection, quotas, subsidies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Kershaw Rowley |title=The Political Economy of Rent-Seeking |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OVkEPjHYik0C&amp;pg=PA226 |year=1988 |publisher=Springer |page=226 |isbn=978-0-89838-241-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; or extension of copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lanier Saperstein |title=Copyrights, Criminal Sanctions and Economic Rents: Applying the Rent Seeking Model to the Criminal Law Formulation Process |year=1997 |volume=87 |issue=4 |pages=1470–1510 |publisher=Northwestern University |journal=The Journal of Criminal Law and Criminology |jstor=1144023 |doi=10.2307/1144023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anne Krueger concludes that "empirical evidence suggests that the value of rents associated with import licenses can be relatively large, and it has been shown that the welfare cost of quantitative restrictions equals that of their tariff equivalents plus the value of the rents".&lt;ref&gt;Krueger, Anne. O (1974). "The Political Economy of the Rent Seeking Society", ''The American Economic Review'', 64(3): 291–303.&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists such as the chair of British financial regulator the [[Financial Services Authority]] [[Lord Turner of Ecchinswell|Lord Adair Turner]] have argued that [[Financial innovation|innovation in the financial industry]] is often a form of rent-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner |first=Adair |title=SECURITISATION, SHADOW BANKING AND THE VALUE OF FINANCIAL INNOVATION |publisher=Johns Hopkins University |date=19 April 2012 |series=SCHOOL OF ADVANCED INTERNATIONAL STUDIES |issue=THE ROSTOV LECTURE ON INTERNATIONAL AFFAIRS |url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/static/pubs/speeches/0419-at.pdf |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Turner |first=Adair |title=WHAT DO BANKS DO, WHAT SHOULD THEY DO AND WHAT PUBLIC POLICIES ARE NEEDED TO ENSURE BEST RESULTS FOR THE REAL ECONOMY? |journal=CASS Business School |date=17 March 2010 |page=27 |url=http://www.fsa.gov.uk/pubs/speeches/at_17mar10.pdf |accessdate=10 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development of theory==
The phenomenon of rent-seeking in connection with monopolies was first formally identified in 1967 by [[Gordon Tullock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Tullock |first=Gordon |year=1967 |title=The Welfare Costs of Tariffs, Monopolies, and Theft |journal=Western Economic Journal |volume=5 |issue=3 |pages=224–32 |doi=10.1111/j.1465-7295.1967.tb01923.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recent studies have shown that the incentives for policy-makers to engage in rent-provision is conditional on the institutional incentives they face, with elected officials in stable high-income democracies the least likely to indulge in such activities vis-à-vis entrenched bureaucrats and/or their counterparts in young and quasi-democracies.&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton , Alexander (2013), Small is beautiful, at least in high-income democracies: the distribution of policy-making responsibility, electoral accountability, and incentives for rent extraction  [http://www-wds.worldbank.org/external/default/WDSContentServer/IW3P/IB/2013/01/07/000158349_20130107132037/Rendered/PDF/wps6305.pdf], World Bank.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
Critics of the concept point out that, in practice, there may be difficulties distinguishing between beneficial profit-seeking and detrimental rent-seeking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.mises.org/journals/rae/pdf/rae1_1_8.pdf |last=Pasour |first=E.C. |title=Rent Seeking: Some Conceptual Problems and Implications |journal=[[The Review of Austrian Economics]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Often a further distinction is drawn between rents obtained legally through political power and the proceeds of private [[common-law]] crimes such as fraud, [[embezzlement]] and theft. This viewpoint sees "profit" as obtained consensually, through a mutually agreeable transaction between two entities (buyer and seller), and the proceeds of common-law crime non-consensually, by force or fraud inflicted on one party by another. Rent, by contrast with these two, is obtained when a third party deprives one party of access to otherwise accessible transaction opportunities, making nominally "consensual" transactions a rent-collection opportunity for the third party. The high profits of the [[illegal drug trade]] are considered rents by this definition, as they are neither legal profits nor the proceeds of common-law crimes.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

People accused of rent-seeking typically argue that they are indeed creating new wealth (or preventing the reduction of old wealth) by improving quality controls, guaranteeing that charlatans do not prey on a gullible public, and preventing [[Economic bubble|bubbles]].{{cn|date=October 2018}}

== Possible consequences ==
From a theoretical standpoint, the [[moral hazard]] of rent-seeking can be considerable. If "buying" a favorable regulatory environment seems cheaper than building more efficient production, a firm may choose the former option, reaping incomes entirely unrelated to any contribution to total wealth or well-being. This results in a sub-optimal [[allocation of resources]] – money spent on lobbyists and counter-lobbyists rather than on [[research and development]], on improved business practices, on [[Professional development|employee training]], or on additional [[capital goods]] – which retards economic growth. Claims that a firm is rent-seeking therefore often accompany allegations of government corruption, or the undue influence of [[Advocacy group|special interests]].&lt;ref name=Eisenhans&gt;{{cite book |last=Eisenhans |first=Hartmut |title=State, class, and development |year=1996 |publisher=Radiant Publishers |isbn=978-81-7027-214-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rent-seeking can prove costly to economic growth; high rent-seeking activity makes more rent-seeking attractive because of the natural and growing returns that one sees as a result of rent-seeking. Thus organizations value rent-seeking over productivity. In this case there are very high levels of rent-seeking with very low levels of output.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} Rent-seeking may grow at the cost of economic growth because rent-seeking by the state can easily hurt innovation. Ultimately, public rent-seeking hurts the economy the most because innovation drives economic growth.&lt;ref name=Murphy&gt;Murphy, Kevin M., Andrei Shleifer, and Robert W. Vishny (1993). "Why is Rent-Seeking So Costly to Growth?," ''The American Economic Review'', 83(2): 409–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Government agents may initiate rent-seeking – such agents soliciting bribes or other favors from the individuals or firms that stand to gain from having special economic privileges, which opens up the possibility of [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] of the consumer.&lt;ref name="Dauderstädt"&gt;{{cite book |editor=Michael Dauderstädt, Arne Schildberg (editors) |title=Dead Ends of Transition: Rentier Economies and Protectorates |year=2006 |publisher=Campus Verlag |isbn=978-3-593-38154-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been shown that rent-seeking by [[bureaucracy]] can push up the cost of production of [[public good]]s.&lt;ref name=Niskanen&gt;{{cite book |last=Niskanen |first=William |year=1971 |title=Bureaucracy and Representative Government |publisher=Aldine-Atherton, Chicago}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shown that rent-seeking by tax officials may cause loss in revenue to the public exchequer.&lt;ref name="Chowdhury 2006" /&gt;

[[Mancur Olson]] traced the historic consequences of rent seeking in ''The Rise and Decline of Nations''.  As a country becomes increasingly dominated by organized interest groups, it loses economic vitality and falls into decline. Olson argued that countries that have a collapse of the political regime and the interest groups that have coalesced around it can radically improve productivity and increase national income because they start with a clean slate in the aftermath of the collapse. An example of this is [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|Japan]] after World War Two. But new coalitions form over time, once again shackling society in order to redistribute wealth and income to themselves. However, social and technological changes have allowed new enterprises and groups to emerge in the past.&lt;ref name=Mokyr&gt;Mokyr, Joel and John V. C. Nye. 2007. "Distributional Coalitions, the Industrial Revolution, and the Origins of Economic Growth in Britain". ''Southern Economic Journal'', 74(1):50–70.&lt;/ref&gt;

A study by Laband and [[John Sophocleus]] in 1988&lt;ref name=Leeson&gt;Leeson, Peter T. ''The Invisible Hook: The Hidden Economics of Pirates''. Princeton University Press. 2009. p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; estimated that rent-seeking had decreased total income in the USA by 45 percent. Both Dougan and Tullock affirm the difficulty of finding the cost of rent-seeking. Rent-seekers of government-provided benefits will in turn spend up to that amount of benefit in order to gain those benefits, in the absence of, for example, the collective-action constraints highlighted by Olson. Similarly, taxpayers lobby for loopholes and will spend the value of those loopholes, again, to obtain those loopholes (again absent collective-action constraints). The total of wastes from rent-seeking is then the total amount from the government-provided benefits and instances of tax avoidance (valuing benefits and avoided taxes at zero). Dougan says that the "total rent-seeking costs equal the sum of aggregate current income plus the net deficit of the public sector".&lt;ref name=Dougan&gt;Dougan, William R. (1991). "The Cost of Rent Seeking: Is GNP Negative?" ''Journal of Political Economy'', 99(3): 660–664.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Gradstein writes about rent-seeking in relation to public goods provision, and says that public goods are determined by rent seeking or lobbying activities. But the question is whether private provision with free-riding incentives or public provision with rent-seeking incentives is more inefficient in its allocation.&lt;ref name=Gradstein&gt;Gradstein, Mark (1993). "Rent Seeking and the Provision of Public Goods," ''The Economic Journal'', 103(420): 1236–1243.&lt;/ref&gt;

The economist [[Joseph Stiglitz]] has argued that rent-seeking contributes significantly to [[income inequality in the United States]] through lobbying for government policies that let the wealthy and powerful get income, not as a reward for creating wealth, but by grabbing a larger share of the wealth that would otherwise have been produced without their effort.&lt;ref name=Stiglitz&gt;Stiglitz, Joseph E. (4 June 2012). ''The Price of Inequality: How Today's Divided Society Endangers Our Future''. p. 32. Norton. Kindle Edition.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lind&gt;{{cite news |last=Lind |first=Michael |title=How rich "moochers" hurt America |url=http://www.salon.com/2013/03/22/how_rich_moochers_ruin_america/ |accessdate=7 April 2013 |newspaper=Salon |date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Piketty]], Saez, and [[Stefanie Stantcheva|Stantcheva]] have analyzed international economies and their changes in tax rates to conclude that much of income inequality is a result of rent-seeking among wealthy tax payers.&lt;ref name=Piketty&gt;Piketty, Thomas, [[Emmanuel Saez]], and [[Stefanie Stantcheva]] (2011), "Optimal Taxation of Top Labor Incomes: A Tale of Three Elasticities", CEPR Discussion Paper 8675, December.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2791">{{Politics of Scotland}}
The '''Scottish variable rate''' (SVR) was a mechanism which would have enabled the [[Scottish Government]] to vary (down or up) the basic rate of [[UK income tax]] by up to 3p in the pound. The power was never used (and indeed was allowed to lapse by the Scottish Government in 2007&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/news/scottish-variable-rate-of-tax-no-longer-available Scottish Variable Rate of tax no longer available]&lt;/ref&gt;) and was succeeded by the legislative framework for Scottish public finance in the [[Scotland Act 2012]], which gives the Scottish Parliament the power to set a [[Scottish rate of income tax]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/news/news-calman.htm|title=HM Revenue &amp; Customs: Devolved taxation in Scotland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When legislating for the [[Scottish Parliament]], a number of matters were [[Reserved matters|reserved]] by the [[UK Parliament]] at Westminster. One such reserved matter was [[taxation]]; however, this had been a key point in Scottish negotiations relating to parliamentary control. As a means of compromise, Westminster afforded the Scottish Parliament the ability to vary income tax, which was subsequently given the consent of the [[Scottish electorate]] in the second question of the [[Scottish devolution referendum, 1997|1997 devolution referendum]].  

Therefore, the [[Scotland Act 1998]] granted the Scottish Parliament the power to vary [[income tax]] by ±3p in every [[Pound sterling|pound]]. This power was often referred to as the '''tartan tax''', a phrase first used by Conservative financier and politician [[Michael Forsyth, Baron Forsyth of Drumlean|Michael Forsyth]] as a way of attacking the power, using the idea of '[[tartan]]' to get across the idea that it would be an extra tax on Scots alone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehistorychannel.co.uk/site/encyclopedia/article_show/Tartan_Tax_/m0092168.html?&amp;searchtermold=the%20labour%20party&amp;searchtermold=the%20labour%20party Tartan Tax] History Channel&lt;/ref&gt; However, the phrase "tartan tax" would only correctly apply if the tax were varied upwards – no phrase was ever suggested if the tax were varied downwards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1760">{{Politics of Seychelles}}

A '''constitutional referendum''' was held in [[Seychelles]] on 15 November 1992. Although the proposed new constitution received the support of 54.6% of voters, it failed to pass the 60% threshold required for adoption. Subsequently a second constitutional commission was created and a second draft put to a [[Seychellois constitutional referendum, 1993|referendum]] the following year.

==Background==
A constitution was drafted by a commission [[Seychellois constitutional commission election, 1992|elected]] earlier in 1992. It provided for a [[presidential system]], with presidents limited to three terms of five years. Half of the [[National Assembly (Seychelles)|National Assembly]] would be elected proportionally based on the results of presidential elections, whilst amendments to the constitution would require a referendum, with changes to some articles requiring a three-fifths majority to be approved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=de&amp;id=sc011992 Seychelles, 15 November 1992: Constitution] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1797">'''Stefanyk National Science Library''' ({{lang-uk|Львівська національна наукова бібліотека України імені Василя Стефаника}}) is a [[national library]] of Ukraine in the city of [[Lviv]]. It also serves as a science and research institute complex of the [[National Academy of Sciences of Ukraine]]. 

The library formally was established on 2 January 1940 with its headquarters in the building of [[Ossolineum]] and composed from holdings of Ossolineum and many other major libraries and private collections, all nationalized after the territory was annexed by the [[Soviet Union]] as a result of its [[invasion of Poland]]. It was named after [[Vasyl Stefanyk]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lsl.lviv.ua/history.htm "Історична довідка"] (Historical reference), a library webpage&lt;/ref&gt;

The term '''therapeutic governance''' has been used multiply in the social science literature, referring to two interrelated concepts.  Therapeutic governance was first coined by Vannessa Pupavac to describe the management of the populations' [[psychology]], and its significance for [[security]].&lt;ref&gt;Pupavac, Vannessa (1 August 2005). ''Human Security and the rise of global therapeutic governance: Conflict, Security and Development''. Vol. 5. No. 2. pp. 161–181.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pupavac|first=Vanessa|date=2001-12-01|title=Therapeutic Governance: Psycho-social Intervention and Trauma Risk Management|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1467-7717.00184/abstract|journal=Disasters|language=en|volume=25|issue=4|pages=358–372|doi=10.1111/1467-7717.00184|issn=1467-7717}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allison McKim used the term therapeutic governance to describe the [[governmentality]] of alcohol and drug treatment, whereby treatment works as a type of [[Governmentality#Responsibilisation|responsibilizing governance]] in producing and managing a rational, self-interested subject. &lt;ref&gt;McKim, Allison (June 2008).

[[File:Aqua Tower thermal imaging.jpg|thumb|This thermal image shows a thermal bridging of a high-rise building ([[Aqua (skyscraper)|Aqua]] in [[Chicago]])]]A '''thermal bridge''', also called a '''cold bridge''', '''heat bridge''', or '''thermal bypass''', is an area or component of an object which has higher [[thermal conductivity]] than the surrounding materials,&lt;ref name="Binggeli"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Systems for Interior Designers|last=Binggeli|first=C.|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a path of least resistance for [[heat transfer]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Gorse, Christopher A., and David Johnston (2012). "Thermal bridge", in ''Oxford Dictionary of Construction, Surveying, and Civil Engineering''. 3rd ed. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2012 pp. 440-441. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal bridges result in an overall reduction in [[thermal resistance]] of the object. The term is frequently discussed in the context of a building's [[thermal envelope]] where thermal bridges result in heat transfer into or out of conditioned space.

Thermal bridges in buildings may impact the amount of energy required to heat and cool a space, cause condensation (moisture) within the building envelope,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65147.pdf|title=Construction Guidelines for High R-Value Walls without Exterior Rigid Insulation|last=Arena|first=Lois|date=July 2016|year=2016|website=NREL.gov|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)|format=PDF|publication-place=Golden, CO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and result in thermal discomfort. In colder climates (such as The United Kingdom), thermal heat bridges can result in additional heat losses and require additional energy to mitigate.

There are strategies to reduce or prevent thermal bridging, such as limiting the number of building members that span from unconditioned to conditioned space and applying continuous insulation materials to create [[thermal break]]s.


==Concept==
[[File:Jonction plancher haut-mur extérieur 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Thermal bridge at junction. Heat moves from the floor structure through the wall because there is no thermal break.]]
Heat transfer occurs through three mechanisms: [[convection]], [[Thermal radiation|radiation]], and [[Thermal conduction|conduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Heat Transfer: Principles, Materials, and Applications|last=Kaviany|first=Massoud|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=1107012406|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thermal bridge is an example of heat transfer through conduction. The rate of heat transfer depends on the thermal conductivity of the material and the temperature difference experienced on either side of the thermal bridge. When a temperature difference is present, heat flow will follow the path of least resistance through the material with the highest thermal conductivity and lowest thermal resistance; this path is a thermal bridge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://passipedia.org/basics/building_physics_-_basics/thermal_bridges/thermal_bridge_definition|title=Definition and effects of thermal bridges [  ]|website=passipedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal bridging describes a situation in a building where there is a direct connection between the outside and inside through one or more elements that possess a higher thermal conductivity than the rest of the envelope of the building. 

==Identifying Thermal Bridges==
Surveying buildings for thermal bridges is performed using passive [[infrared thermography]] (IRT) according to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). Infrared Thermography of buildings can allow thermal signatures that indicate heat leaks. IRT detects thermal abnormalities that are linked to the movement of fluids through building elements, highlighting the variations in the thermal properties of the materials that correspondingly cause a major change in temperature. The drop shadow effect, a situation in which the surrounding environment casts a shadow on the facade of the building, can lead to potential accuracy issues of measurements through inconsistent facade sun exposure. An alternative analysis method, Iterative Filtering (IF), can be used to solve this problem.

In all thermographic building inspections, the thermal image interpretation if performed by a human operator, involving a high level of subjectivity and expertise of the operator. Automated analysis approaches, such as [[Laser scanning]] technologies can provide thermal imaging on 3 dimensional [[CAD]] model surfaces and metric information to thermographic analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Previtali |first1=Mattia |last2=Barazzetti |first2=Luigi |last3=Roncoroni |first3=Fabio |title=Spatial Data Management for Energy Efficient Envelope Retrofitting |journal=Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2013 |date=24-27 June 2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39637-3_48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface temperature data in 3D models can identify and measure thermal irregularities of thermal bridges and insulation leaks. Thermal imaging can also be acquired through the use of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAV), fusing thermal data from multiple cameras and platforms. The UAV uses an infrared camera to generate a thermal field image of recorded temperature values, where every pixel represents radiative energy emitted by the surface of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garrido |first1=I. |last2=Lagüela |first2=S. |last3=Arias |first3=P. |last4=Balado |first4=J. |title=Thermal-based analysis for the automatic detection and characterization of thermal bridges in buildings |journal=Energy and Buildings |date=1 January 2018 |volume=158 |pages=1358-1367 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.11.031 |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Thermal Bridging in Construction==
Frequently, thermal bridging is used in reference to a building’s thermal envelope, which is a layer of the building enclosure system that resists heat flow between the interior conditioned environment and the exterior unconditioned environment. Heat will transfer through a building’s thermal envelope at different rates depending on the materials present throughout the envelope. Heat transfer will be greater at thermal bridge locations than where insulation exists because there is less thermal resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-0901-thermal-metrics-high-performance-walls-limitations-r-value/view|title=RR-0901: Thermal Metrics for High-Performance Walls—The Limitations of R-Value|work=Building Science Corporation|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter, when exterior temperature is typically lower than interior temperature, heat flows outward and will flow at greater rates through thermal bridges. At a thermal bridge location, the surface temperature on the inside of the building envelope will be lower than the surrounding area. In the summer, when the exterior temperature is typically higher than the interior temperature, heat flows inward, and at greater rates through thermal bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings|last=Grondzik|first=Walter|last2=Kwok|first2=Alison|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=0470195657|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes winter heat losses and summer heat gains for conditioned spaces in buildings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larbi|first=A. Ben|title=Statistical modelling of heat transfer for thermal bridges of buildings|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.12.013|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=37|issue=9|pages=945–951|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite insulation requirements specified by various national regulations, thermal bridging in a building's envelope remain a weak spot in the construction industry. Moreover, in many countries building design practices implement partial insulation measurements foreseen by regulations.&lt;ref&gt;THEODOSIOU, T. G, and A. M PAPADOPOULOS. 2008. “The Impact of Thermal Bridges on the Energy Demand of Buildings with Double Brick Wall Constructions.” Energy and Buildings, no. 11: 2083. https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dedscal%26AN%3dedscal.20659411%26site%3deds-live.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermal losses are greater in practice that is anticipated during the design stage.

An assembly such as an exterior wall or insulated ceiling is generally classified by a [[R-value (insulation)|U-factor]], in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·K, that reflects the overall rate of heat transfer per unit area for all the materials within an assembly, not just the insulation layer. Heat transfer via thermal bridges reduces the overall thermal resistance of an assembly, resulting in an increased U-factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kossecka|first=E.|last2=Kosny|first2=J.|date=2016-09-16|title=Equivalent Wall as a Dynamic Model of a Complex Thermal Structure|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/109719639702000306|journal=Journal of Thermal Insulation and Building Envelopes|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=249–268|doi=10.1177/109719639702000306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal bridges can occur at several locations within a building envelope; most commonly, they occur at junctions between two or more building elements. Common locations include:
*Floor-to-wall or balcony-to-wall junctions, including slab-on-grade and [[concrete]] balconies or outdoor patios that extend the [[floor slab]] through the building envelope
*Roof/Ceiling-to-wall junctions, especially where full ceiling insulation depths may not be achieved
*Window-to-wall junctions&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Christian|first=Jeffery|last2=Kosny|first2=Jan|date=December 1995|title=Toward a National Opaque Wall Rating Label|url=|journal=Proceedings Thermal Performance of the Exterior Envelopes VI, ASHRAE|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Door-to-wall junctions&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*Wall-to-wall junctions&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;
*Wood, steel or concrete members, such as studs and joists, incorporated in exterior wall, ceiling, or roof construction&lt;ref name="Allen"&gt;Allen, E. and J. Lano, ''Fundamentals of Building Construction: materials and methods''. Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Recessed luminaries that penetrate insulated ceilings
*Windows and doors, especially frames components
*Areas with gaps in or poorly installed insulation
*Metal ties in masonry cavity walls&lt;ref name="Allen" /&gt;

Structural elements remain a weak point in construction, commonly leading to thermal bridges that result in high heat loss and low surface temperatues in a room.

===Masonry Buildings===
While thermal bridges exist in various types of building enclosures, [[Masonry|masonry walls]] experience significantly increased U-factors caused by thermal bridges. Comparing [[list of thermal conductivities|thermal conductivities]] between different building materials allows for assessment of performance relative to other design options. Brick materials, which are usually used for facade enclosures, typically have higher thermal conductivities than timber, depending on the brick density and wood type.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=2017 ASHRAE Handbook: Fundamentals|last=American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE)|first=|publisher=ASHRAE|year=2017|isbn=1939200571|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete, which may be used for floors and edge beams in masonry buildings are common thermal bridges, especially at the corners. Depending on the physical makeup of the concrete, the thermal conductivity can be greater than that of brick materials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition to heat transfer, if the indoor environment is not adequately vented, thermal bridging may cause the brick material to absorb rainwater and humidity into the wall, which can result in mold growth and deterioration of building envelope material.

===Curtain Wall===
Similar to masonry walls, [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] can experience significantly increases U-factors due to thermal bridging. Curtain wall frames are often constructed with highly conductive aluminum, which has a typical thermal conductivity above 200 W/m·K. In comparison, wood framing members are typically between 0.68 and 1.25 W/m·K.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The aluminum frame for most curtain wall constructions extends from the exterior of the building through to the interior, creating thermal bridges.&lt;ref name="Totten"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Totten|first=Paul E.|last2=O’Brien|first2=Sean M.|date=2008|title=The Effects of Thermal Bridging at Interface Conditions|journal=Building Enclosure Science &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impacts of Thermal Bridging ===
Thermal bridging can result in increased energy required to heat or cool a conditioned space due to winter heat loss and summer heat gain. At interior locations near thermal bridges, occupants may experience thermal discomfort due to the difference in temperature.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ge|first=Hua|last2=McClung|first2=Victoria Ruth|last3=Zhang|first3=Shenshu|title=Impact of balcony thermal bridges on the overall thermal performance of multi-unit residential buildings: A case study|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.01.004|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=60|pages=163–173|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor space is large and there is warm and humid air indoors, such as the conditions experienced in the winter, there is a risk of condensation in the building envelope due to the cooler temperature on the interior surface at thermal bridge locations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Condensation can ultimately result in mold growth with consequent poor indoor air quality and insulation degradation, reducing the insulation performance and causing insulation to perform inconsistently throughout the thermal envelope&lt;ref name="Miimu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matilainen|first=Miimu|last2=Jarek|first2=Kurnitski|date=2002|title=Moisture conditions in highly insulated outdoor ventilated crawl spaces in cold climates|journal=Energy and buildings|volume=35|issue=2|pages=175–187|doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design Methods to Reduce Thermal Bridges==
There are several methods that have been proven to reduce or eliminate thermal bridging depending on the cause, location, and the construction type. The objective of these methods is to either create a [[thermal break]] where a building component would span from exterior to interior otherwise, or to reduce the number of building components spanning from exterior to interior. These strategies include:

*A continuous thermal [[building insulation|insulation]] layer in the thermal envelope, such as with rigid foam board insulation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Lapping of insulation where direct continuity is not possible
*Double and staggered wall assemblies&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Residential Compliance Manual for the 2016 Building Energy Efficiency Standards|last=California Energy Commission (CEC)|first=|publisher=California Energy Commission|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Structural insulated panel|Structural Insulated Panels]] (SIPs) and [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Reducing framing factor by eliminating unnecessary framing members, such as implemented with advanced framing&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Raised heel trusses at wall-to-roof junctions to increase insulation depth
*Quality insulation installation without voids or compressed insulation
*Installing double or triple pane windows with gas filler and low-emissivity coating&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustavsen|first=Arild|last2=Grynning|first2=Steinar|last3=Arasteh|first3=Dariush|last4=Jelle|first4=Bjørn Petter|last5=Goudey|first5=Howdy|title=Key elements of and material performance targets for highly insulating window frames|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.05.010|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=10|pages=2583–2594|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Installing windows with thermally broken frames made of low conductivity material&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Analysis Methods and Challenges==
Due to their significant impacts on heat transfer, correctly modeling the impacts of thermal bridges is important to estimate overall energy use. Thermal bridges are characterized by multi-dimensional heat transfer, and therefore they cannot be adequately approximated by steady-state one-dimensional (1D) models of calculation typically used to estimate the thermal performance of buildings in most building energy simulation tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=K.|last2=Erkoreka|first2=A.|last3=Flores|first3=I.|last4=Odriozola|first4=M.|last5=Sala|first5=J.M.|title=Problems in the calculation of thermal bridges in dynamic conditions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.018|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=2-3|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady state heat transfer models are based on simple heat flow where heat is driven by a temperature difference that does not fluctuate over time so that heat flow is always in one direction. This type of 1D model can substantially underestimate heat transfer through the envelope when thermal bridges are present, resulting in lower predicted building energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Guofeng|last2=Johanneson|first2=Gudni|date=1997|title=Dynamic Calculation of Thermal Bridges|url=|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=26|pages=233–240|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/s0378-7788(97)00005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The currently available solutions are to enable two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer capabilities in modeling software or, more commonly, to use a method that translates multi-dimensional heat transfer into an equivalent 1D component to use in building simulation software. This latter method can be accomplished through the equivalent wall method in which a complex dynamic assembly, such as a wall with a thermal bridge, is represented by a 1D multi-layered assembly that has equivalent thermal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kossecka|first=E.|last2=Kosny|first2=J.|date=January 1997|title=Equivalent Wall as a Dynamic Model of a Complex Thermal Structure|url=|journal=J. Therm. Insul. Build. Envelopes|volume=20|pages=249–268|via=|doi=10.1177/109719639702000306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arms of Parker.svg|thumb|200px|Arms of Parker, Earls of Macclesfield: ''Gules, a chevron between three leopard's faces or''&lt;ref&gt;Debrett's Peerage, 1968, p.723&lt;/ref&gt;]]
'''Thomas Parker, 1st Earl of Macclesfield''', {{postnominals|country=GBR|size=100%|sep=,|PC|FRS}} (23 July 1666 &amp;ndash; 28 April 1732) was an [[England|English]] [[Whig (British political faction)|Whig]] politician.

==Youth and early career==
He was born in [[Staffordshire]], the son of Thomas Parker, an attorney at [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]]. He was educated at [[Adams' Grammar School]] and [[Trinity College, Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=PRKR685T|name=Parker, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Janet Carrier, whose sister was married to William Anson, [[George Anson, 1st Baron Anson|1st Baron Anson]]'s father. He was called to the bar in 1691, and became a [[Member of Parliament]] and was [[knight]]ed in 1705. In 1710 he refused the office of [[Lord Chancellor]], but was made a [[Privy Council of Great Britain|Privy Counsellor]]. He was [[Lord Chief Justice of England and Wales|Lord Chief Justice]] from 1710 to 1718 and was involved in the prosecution of [[Henry Sacheverell|Dr Sacheverell]]. He made a vehement attack on Sacheverell and the high church clergy.&lt;ref name=aim25&gt;[http://www.aim25.ac.uk/cgi-bin/frames/fulldesc?inst_id=13&amp;coll_id=3645&amp;full=1&amp;template=1]&lt;/ref&gt; He was also a friend of [[Bernard Mandeville|Bernard de Mandeville]], whose satirical ''Fable of the Bees'' became highly controversial in the 1720s.

He became a [[Royal Society|Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1713. He also had a grammar school built at [[Leek, Staffordshire|Leek]], his home town. In 1714 he was raised to the peerage as '''Baron Parker of Macclesfield'''.

==Regent of Great Britain and Ireland==
[[Image:1stEarlOfMacclesfield.jpg|thumb|left|The Earl of Macclesfield, by [[Godfrey Kneller|Sir Godfrey Kneller]].]]
On 1 August 1714, [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]] died, and her successor, [[George I of Great Britain|King George I]], was in [[Electorate of Hanover|Hanover]], so Baron Parker was designated Regent of Great Britain, Ireland and the realms beyond the seas until the new monarch could be informed of the situation and take the crown. He governed until 18 September 1714. 

In 1718, because the King could not speak English, Parker gave the [[speech from the throne|King's Speech]] in the [[House of Lords]].

==Lord Chancellor==
In 1718, he became Lord Chancellor and given a pension for life, and was a favourite of the [[George I of Great Britain|King]]. In 1721, he was advanced to the title '''Earl of Macclesfield''' with the additional subsidiary title of '''Viscount Parker'''. In 1724, he was implicated in financial irregularities, but he did not resign as [[Lord Chancellor]] until 1725.

==Impeachment==
In 1725, he was [[impeachment|impeached]] and tried in the [[House of Lords]].&lt;ref name=aim25/&gt; He was, unanimously, convicted of corruption for taking more than £100,000 in bribes (the equivalent of more than £11,000,000 today). He was fined £30,000 and placed in the [[Tower of London]] until payment was received. He was also struck off the roll of the [[Privy Council]]. He was a fabulously wealthy man, possibly because of his corruption, but as this money was confiscated, he had no resources to pay his fine. He spent most of the rest of his life at [[Shirburn Castle]], where he was buried.

He was, however, still able to be a pallbearer at the funeral of Sir [[Isaac Newton]] in 1727. He died in [[Soho Square]], London.

On 6 April 2006 he was arrested as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering.&lt;ref name=heared&gt;{{cite journal|author=Lepina, Marina|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=733994|script-title=ru:Василий Алексанян заслушал следователя|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 1|issue=3557|date=January 15, 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a decision by European Court of Human Rights, he was released on a bond on 12 January 2009, dying from complications of AIDS on 2 October 2011.

==Lawyer and businessman==
Vasily Aleksanyan graduated from the [[Moscow State University]] and the [[Harvard Law School|Law School]] of [[Harvard University]] as a [[Master of Laws]]. In 1992 through 1994 he worked for the USA law firm [[Cleary Gottlieb Steen &amp; Hamilton]]. In 1995–1996 he was the head of the legal department for the British Investment firm [[SUN Group]]. Since 1996 he worked as the head of the legal department for [[Yukos]].&lt;ref name=kareera/&gt;

On 1 April 2006, amidst the legal troubles over Yukos company, his position was elevated to that of Executive Vice President.&lt;ref name=Kommersant6&gt;{{cite journal|author=Skornyakova, Anna|author2=Olga Pleshanova |author3=Yevgeniy Alekseev |url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=664057|script-title=ru:Новый вице-президент ЮКОСа успел сказать корпоративное управление|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 60|issue=3391|date= April 6, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Kommersant7&gt;{{cite journal|author=Trifonov, Vladislad|url=http://www.kommersant.ru/doc.aspx?DocsID=664463|script-title=ru:Генпрокуратура сложила президентские полномочия|journal=[[Kommersant]]|volume=№ 61|issue=3392|date=April 7, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; His new position was accepted by the shareholders on 4 April.&lt;ref name=zoominfo&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zoominfo.com/Search/PersonDetail.aspx?PersonID=410002248|title=Biography of Vasily Aleksanyan|publisher=[[ZoomInfo]]}}{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main stated goal in the new role was to streamline the corporate governance, achieving direct control over the assets of the company from the [[London]] Yukos headquarters bypassing the [[Moscow]] based offices of [[Yukos RM]] and [[Yukos EP]]. The decision was quite important for the struggling company as the Moscow-based offices bluntly refused all the supervision from London obeying orders of the government-controlled [[Rosneft]] instead.&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt; According to Aleksanyan, the lost control over the Moscow offices led to financial irregularities, including e.g. surfacing of counterfeit 10 billion [[Russian ruble|ruble]] [[promissory note]].&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt;

On 6 April 2006 Aleksanyan was taken into custody as a suspected accomplice to tax evasion and money laundering by Yukos.&lt;ref name=heared/&gt; According to prosecutors, Aleksanyan was an accomplice to the [[embezzlement]] of more than 12 billion rubles.&lt;ref name=held&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2006/04/06/alexsanyan/|script-title=ru:Вице-президент "ЮКОСа" Василий Алексанян задержан|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=April 6, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arrest was based on the testimonies of [[Svetlana Bakhmina]], a subordinate of Aleksanyan arrested in 2004. According to Aleksanyan, Bakhmina's testimonies were false, and were taken from her under pressure.&lt;ref name=Kommersant7/&gt;

==In prison==

After his arrest Aleksanyan started a [[hunger strike]], insisting that his arrest without court hearings was illegal. He aborted his strike on 27 April 2006.&lt;ref name=RIAN&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rian.ru/society/20060502/47120067.html|script-title=ru:ФСИН подтверждает, что Василий Алексанян прекратил голодовку|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=May 2, 2006|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Aleksanyan's imprisonment, his health rapidly deteriorated due to [[HIV]]-related illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKL0748261720080207|title=Russia says will move AIDS prisoner to hospital|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date= February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became almost blind and developed [[cancer]] of the [[liver]] with [[metastasis]] into the [[lymph node]]s. He also became ill with [[tuberculosis]].&lt;ref name=heared/&gt;&lt;ref name=politru/&gt;&lt;ref name=svoboda/&gt;&lt;ref name=lentalishili&gt;{{cite news|url=http://lenta.ru/news/2007/12/27/grave/|script-title=ru:Бывшего вице-президента "ЮКОСа" лишили необходимого лечения|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=December 27, 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the grave medical situation demanding urgent [[Antiretroviral drug|antiretroviral treatment]] and [[chemotherapy]] in a hospital, he was denied both.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Osadchuk, Svetlana|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2008/02/07/002.html|title=Trial Stops But Judges Won't Free Aleksanyan|work=[[The Moscow Times]]|date=February 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The prosecutors also ignored three injunctions by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] on 27 November 2007, on 6 December 2007 and on 20 December 2007.&lt;ref name=politru&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.polit.ru/news/2007/12/29/alex.html|script-title=ru:Смертельно больной менеджер ЮКОСа требует перевода из тюрьмы в больницу|publisher=[[Polit.Ru]]|date=December 29, 2007|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=svoboda&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.svobodanews.ru/news/2007/12/27.html?id=428019|script-title=ru:Василий Алексанян просит правозащитников о помощи|publisher=[[Radio Liberty]]|date=December 27, 2007|language=Russian|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230191213/http://www.svobodanews.ru/news/2007/12/27.html?id=428019|archivedate=December 30, 2007|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Aleksanyan, the prosecutors are demanding false evidence against other Yukos executives from him before starting his medical treatment. On 26 December Aleksanyan made public a statement asking for help from human rights advocates.&lt;ref name=politru/&gt;&lt;ref name=svoboda/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.khodorkovsky.info/aleksanyan/ |accessdate=December 8, 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916104559/http://www.khodorkovsky.info/aleksanyan/ |archivedate=September 16, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Echo of Moscow]]. 8 February 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 October 2008 Simonovsky Court of [[Moscow]] approved continuing pre-trial detention of Alexanyan despite his grave illnesses (he had [[cancer]], [[tuberculosis]]  and [[AIDS]] and his [[spleen]] was surgically removed).&lt;ref name=releasedlenta&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.lenta.ru/news/2008/12/08/free1/|script-title=ru:Суд освободил бывшего вице-президента "ЮКОСа" Василия Алексаняна|publisher=[[Lenta.Ru]]|date=December 8, 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=releasednews&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsru.com/russia/08dec2008/alex_zalog.html|script-title=ru:Суд готов освободить смертельно больного Василия Алексаняна - под залог в $2 млн|publisher=[[NEWSru]]|date=December 8, 2008|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2008 Moscow City Court reversed the decision of Simonovsky Court and decided to release Alexanyan under a bond of 50 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] (approximately $2 million). He was to be released after the money was paid.&lt;ref name=releasedlenta/&gt;&lt;ref name=releasednews/&gt; Human rights advocates [[Lev Ponomaryov]] and [[Lyudmila Alexeyeva]] welcomed the court decision but expressed concern whether Alexanyan would be able to pay this sum of money.&lt;ref name=releasednews/&gt;

==Release and death==
On 22 December 2008 European Court of Human Rights made its decision over the ''Aleksanyan v. Russia'' case. The court found Russia in violation of four articles of [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and obliged Russia to release Alexanyan immediately without any bond.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Vasileva, Vera|url=http://hro1.org/node/4053|script-title=ru:Страсбургский суд принял решение по делу "Алексанян против России"|publisher=hro1.org|date=December 22, 2008|language=Russian|title=Archived copy|access-date=December 22, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081225130323/http://hro1.org/node/4053|archive-date=December 25, 2008|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=844609&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649|title=Case of Aleksanyan v. Russia|publisher=[[European Court of Human Rights]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 January 2009, after a bond of 50 million [[Russian ruble|rubles]] was paid,  Aleksanyan was released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/hi/russian/international/newsid_7834000/7834678.stm Алексанян выписан из больницы]&lt;/ref&gt; But he was repeatedly summoned to attend court hearings, where he wore a face mask and could barely stand up during the proceedings. The case against him was only dropped last year as the statute of limitations ran out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themoscowtimes.com/news/article/aleksanyans-death-practically-murder/444834.html Andrew McChesney and Alexandra Odynova in ''The Moscow Times'': Aleksanyan's Death 'Practically Murder']&lt;/ref&gt;

Aleksanyan died at his home in Moscow on 2 October 2011, due to complications from AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.yahoo.com/former-yukos-executive-dies-aids-193709900.html Former Yukos executive dies of AIDS - Yahoo! News]&lt;/ref&gt;
