'''Anusim''' ({{lang-he-n|אֲנוּסִים}}, {{IPA-he|anuˈsim|pron}}; singular male, '''anús''', {{lang-he-n|אָנוּס}} {{IPA-he|aˈnus|pron}}; singular female, '''anusáh''', {{hebrew|אָנוּסָה}} {{IPA-he|anuˈsa|pron}}, meaning "coerced") is a legal category of [[Jews]] in ''[[halakha]]'' (Jewish law) who were forced to abandon [[Judaism]] against their will, typically while [[forced conversion|forcibly converted]] to another religion. The term "anusim" is most properly translated as the "coerced [ones]" or the "forced [ones]".

==Etymology==
The term ''anusim'' derives from the [[Talmud]]ic phrase ''averah b’ones'' ({{Hebrew|עבירה באונס}}),&lt;ref&gt;Talmud, Abodá Zará 54a&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "a forced transgression." The Hebrew ''ones'' (pronounced "oh'nes") derives from the [[Semitic root#Triconsonantal roots|triconsonantal root]] א-נ-ס ([[Aleph]]-[[Nun (letter)|Nun]]-[[Samekh]]), and originally referred to any case where a person has been forced into any act against his or her will. In [[Modern Hebrew]], the word ''ones'' is mainly used to mean [[rape]], thus "anusim" (or female "anusot") nowadays means rape victims - the older meaning used only in the historical context.

The term ''anús'' is used in contradistinction to ''meshumad'' ({{Hebrew|מְשֻׁמָּד}}), which means a person who has voluntarily abandoned the practice of Jewish law in whole or part. The forced converts were also known as ''[[New Christian|cristianos nuevos]]'' (Spanish) or  ''cristãos-novos'' (Portuguese); ''[[converso]]'' or ''[[marrano]]'', which had and still has today a pejorative connotation in Spanish.

==Related terms==

Besides the term ''anusim'', [[halakha]] has various classifications for those Jews who have abandoned, or are no longer committed to, the [[Rabbinic Judaism|rabbinic Jewish]] tradition, whether or not they have converted to another religion. 

The two most common descriptions are:

* "''[[Apostasy in Judaism|Min]]''{{-"}} ({{Hebrew|מין}}), or an apostate of Judaism, for a Jew who basically denies the existence of God; and
* "''[[Heresy in Judaism|Meshumad]]''{{-"}} ({{Hebrew|מְשֻׁמָּד}}), literally "self-destroyed" or a heretic to Judaism, for a Jew who deliberately rebels against the observance of Jewish law.

The main difference between a ''min'', a ''meshumad'', and the ''anusim'' is that the act of abandonment of Judaism is voluntary for a ''min'' and a ''meshumad'', while for the ''anusim'' it is not.

In more recent times, the term Anusim has also been used to describe [[Reverse Marranos]], that is, [[Haredi Jews]] who are religious on the outside, but are not necessarily practicing in private.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tamar |last=Rotem |date=February 27, 2010 |title=Where Rebellious Haredi Sons (and Daughters) Go |url=http://failedmessiah.typepad.com/failed_messiahcom/2010/02/where-rebellious-haredi-sons-and-daughters-go-789.html |publisher=[[FailedMessiah.com]] |agency=''[[Haaretz]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of use==
The term ''anusim'' became more frequently used after the [[Forced conversion#Christianity|forced conversion to Christianity]] of [[Ashkenazi Jews]] in [[History of the Jews in Germany|Germany]] at the end of the 11th century. In his religious legal opinions, [[Rashi]], a French [[rabbi]] who lived during this period, commented about the issue of anusim.&lt;ref name="Roth2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Roth|first=Norman|title=Conversos, Inquisition, and the Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nzJ5340UZKMC&amp;pg=PA26|date=2 September 2002|publisher=University of Wisconsin Press|location=Madison, WI, USA|isbn=978-0-299-14233-9|page=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several centuries later, following the mass [[forced conversion]] of [[Sephardi Jews]] (those Jews with extended histories in [[History of the Jews in Spain|Spain]] and [[History of the Jews in Portugal|Portugal]], known jointly as [[Iberia]], or "[[Sepharad]]" in Hebrew) of the 15th and 16th centuries, the term "anusim" became widely used by Spanish rabbis and their successors for the following 600 years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://jewishhistory.huji.ac.il/Internetresources/historyresources/medieval.htm Medieval Jewish History Resource Directory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; henceforth becoming associated with Sephardic history.

The term may be properly applied to any Jew of any [[Jewish ethnic divisions|ethnic division]]. Since that time, it has also been applied to other forced or coerced converted Jews, such as the [[Mashhadi Jews|Mashadi Jews]] of [[Persia]] (modern [[Iran]]), who converted to [[Islam]] in the public eye, but secretly practised Judaism at home. They lived dual-religious lives, being fully practising Muslims in public life, and fully practising Jews at home.&lt;ref&gt;See Mashhadi Jewish Community History on MashadiRabbi.com&lt;/ref&gt;

In non-rabbinic literature, the more widely known [[Sephardi]]c anusim are also referred to as:
*"[[Converso]]s", meaning "converts [to Christianity]" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]], [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]], [[Catalan language|Catalan]] and [[Ladino language|Ladino]] (Judaeo-Spanish).
*"[[New Christian]]s", or ''cristianos nuevos'' in Spanish, and ''cristãos novos'' in Portuguese (Catalan: ''cristians nous''), which also encompasses converts from Islam.
*"[[Crypto-Jew]]s", and
*"[[Marrano]]s", a term which refers to those conversos which practiced Judaism in secret and, as a result, were targeted by the Spanish inquisition.

==In rabbinic literature==
The subject of anusim has a special place in [[rabbinic literature]]. In normal circumstances, a person who abandons [[Mitzvot|Jewish observance]], or part of it, is classified as a ''meshumad''. Such a person is still counted as a Jew for purposes of lineage, but is under a disability to claim any privilege pertaining to Jewish status: for example, he should not be counted in a [[minyan]], that is, a [[quorum]] for religious services.

''Anusim'', by contrast, not only remain Jews by lineage but continue to count as fully qualified Jews for all purposes. Since the act of the original abandonment of the religion was done against the Jew’s will, the Jew under force may remain a kosher Jew, as long as the ''anús'' keeps practising Jewish law to the best of his/her abilities under the coerced condition. In this sense, "kosher" is the rabbinic legal term applied to a Jew who adheres to rabbinic tradition and is accordingly not subject to any disqualification.

==Rabbinic legal opinions==
[[Saadia Ibn Danan|Se‘adyá ben Maimón ibn Danan]] in the 15th century stated:
{{quote|Indeed, when it comes to [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineage]], all the [[Israelites|people of Israel]] are brethren. We are all the sons of one father, the rebels (''[[Heresy in Orthodox Judaism|reshaim]]'') and criminals, the heretics (''[[Apostasy in Judaism|meshumadim]]'') and forced ones (''anusim''), and the proselytes (''[[Conversion to Judaism|gerim]]'') who are attached to the house of [[Jacob]]. All these are Israelites. Even if they left God or denied Him, or violated His Law, the yoke of that Law is still upon their shoulders and will never be removed from them.&lt;ref&gt;R. Se‘adyá ben Maimón ibn Danan (16th century), ''Hhemdah Genuzáh'', 15b&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Ben-Zion Meir Hai Uziel]], the Chief Sephardic Rabbi of the State of Israel, stated in the mid-20th century:
{{quote|And we still have to clarify on the (subject of) Anusím, to whom the government forbids them to perform Halakhicly valid marriages, if it's necessary to say that their wives must have a Get to permit them (to marry another man), for the reason that, by force of the Law (Hazaqáh), a man does not have intercourse for promiscuity (zenút). . . (In our very case), we deal with those who converted and kept Torah in secrecy and hide their religion because of the gentile surveillance, we say that they do have intercourse for the sake of marriage.}}

It follows that Uziel considered ''anusím'' as Jews, because only Jews can give or receive a ''[[Get (divorce document)|get]]'', a Jewish divorce. [[Maimonides]] stated in the [[Mishneh Torah]] Sefer Shofetím, Hilekhót Mumarím 3:3:

{{quote|But their children and grandchildren [of Jewish rebels], who, misguided by their parents . . . and trained in their views, are like children taken captive by the gentiles and raised in their laws and customs (weghidelúhu haGoyím `al dathám), whose status is that of an ’anús [one who abjures Jewish law under duress], who, although he later learns that he is a Jew, meets Jews, observes them practice their laws, is nevertheless to be regarded as an ’anús, since he was reared in the erroneous ways of his parents . . . Therefore efforts should be made to bring them back in repentance (LeFikakh rawí leHah zirán biTeshubáh), to draw them near by friendly relations, so that they may return to the strength-giving source, i.e., the Toráh.}}

== Current status ==
There is much controversy regarding the status of conversions today. While the [[Chief Rabbi|chief rabbi]]s are wary of converting large groups, there are some rabbis such as [[Haim Amsalem]] and [[Chuck Davidson]] who have done mass conversions of Bnei Anusim against the will of the [[Chief Rabbinate of Israel]]. In the United States [[Reform Judaism|Reform rabbi]] Jacques Cukierkorn is one of the leaders of the outreach to the descendants of those Crypto-Jews who wish to renew their ties with the Jewish people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Chicago Jewish Cafe|title=Are American Jews the New Secret Jews? Interview with Rabbi Jacques Cukierkorn.|date=2018-10-03|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GvWLhuy7sdk&amp;feature=youtu.be|access-date=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education''' ('''BIHE'''), is a unique open university in [[Iran]], which has been portrayed as an underground university,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bic.org/statements/bahai-institute-higher-education-creative-and-peaceful-response-religious-persecution-iran#CHIkX0LiAsBEzteQ.97|title=The Baha'i Institute Of Higher Education: A Creative And Peaceful Response To Religious Persecution In Iran|website=www.bic.org|access-date=2017-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; established by the [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í community]] [[Bahá'í Faith in Iran|of Iran]] in 1987 to meet the educational needs of young people who have been systematically denied access to higher education by the Iranian government. Currently, through a main faculty in Iran and an Affiliated Global Faculty from universities around the world, BIHE offers a total of 38 undergraduate and graduate programs in Sciences, Engineering, Business and Management, Humanities, and Social Sciences. More than 80 universities in [[North America]], [[Europe]], and [[Australia]] have thus far accepted the BIHE's graduates directly into programs of graduate study at the masters and doctoral levels. BIHE has a decentralized and fluid structure and uses a hybrid approach of offline and online delivery methods which has enabled it to grow under unusual sociopolitical circumstances. Despite numerous arrests, periodic raids, several imprisonments, mass confiscation of school equipment and general harassment, BIHE has continued and even expanded its operation. BIHE has received praise for offering a non-violent, creative, and constructive response to ongoing oppression.

=== Persecution of the Bahá'ís of Iran ===
{{main|Persecution of Bahá'ís}}
Since its birth in the 19th century, [[Bahá'í Faith in Iran|the Bahá'í community of Iran]] has faced different forms of persecution&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="closed doors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; including hostile propaganda and censorship, social exclusion, denial of education and employment, confiscation and destruction of property, arson, unjustified arrests and imprisonment, physical and psychological torture, death threats, arbitrary executions and disappearances.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Michael | last = Karlberg | title = Constructive Resilience: The Baha ́’ı ́Response to Oppression | journal= Peace &amp; Change | issue = 2 | volume = 35 | pages = 222–257 | year = 2010| url = | issn = 1468-0130}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Islamic Revolution|The Islamic Revolution of 1979]] intensified the persecutions and made Bahá'ís - the largest religious minority of the country - the target of a systematic state-sponsored campaign of repression.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph"&gt;{{cite web |author=Adrian Blomfield |publisher= The Telegraph |title=Religious academics denounce persecution against Iran's Baha'i minority|year=2011|accessdate=2017-01-05|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/iran/8816662/Religious-academics-denounce-persecution-against-Irans-Bahai-minority.html| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this ongoing campaign, over two hundred Bahá'ís have been executed; thousands more have been imprisoned, have lost their jobs, been denied their pensions, been expelled from schools and universities, been denied health care, had their personal property plundered, and had their grave sites defiled.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BIC2016-2"&gt;{{cite web |author=|publisher=Bahá’í International Community |title=The Bahá’í Question Revisited: Persecution and Resilience in Iran|year=2016|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=https://www.bic.org/sites/default/files/pdf/thebahaiquestionrevisited_final_160930e.pdf|format=PDF | page = 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The modern persecution of Iranian Bahá’ís now continues in its fourth decade.&lt;ref name="BIC2016-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Amnesty"&gt;{{cite web |author=|publisher=Amnesty International|title=Iran 2015/2016|year=2016|accessdate=2017-01-04|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/countries/middle-east-and-north-africa/iran/report-iran/|format= | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2016 annual report to the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]], [[UN Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]], refers to the Bahá'í community of Iran as “the most severely persecuted religious minority” of the country.&lt;ref name="UN2016"&gt;{{cite web |author=UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon |publisher=United Nations |title=Situation of human rights in the Islamic Republic of Iran|year=2016|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=https://www.bic.org/sites/default/files/2016_unsg_report_to_ga_a-7-374.pdf|format=PDF | page =15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denial of the right to education ===
The denial of the right to higher education is a tool wielded by the Iranian government on many whose ideology contradicts or threatens the authority of the ruling clerics; however, the Bahá'ís are the only group to face pervasive class denial of this right.&lt;ref name="educationunderfire"&gt;{{cite web |author= |publisher= Singel Arrow Publications |title= Education Under Fire|year=2012|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=http://www.educationunderfire.com/2012-Campaign-Booklet.pdf|format=PDF | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The efforts of the Iranian government to deny Bahá'ís the right to education is seen by Bahá'ís as part of its coordinated efforts to eradicate the Bahá’í community as a viable group within Iranian society.&lt;ref name="closed doors"&gt;{{cite web |author= |publisher=Bahá’í International Community |title= Closed Doors: Iran’s Campaign to Deny Higher Education to Bahá’ís|year=2005|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=http://denial.bahai.org/pdf/cd_all.pdf|format=PDF | page =41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the [[Iranian Revolution]] in 1979, large numbers of Bahá'í students, ranging across the entire education system from primary through secondary and university level, were expelled from schools and blocked from continuing their education. Similarly, Bahá'í professors and faculty members were dismissed from all universities and academic institutions of the country.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"&gt;{{cite journal | first = Mina | last = Yazdani | title = Higher Education under the Islamic Republic: the Case of the Baha’is | journal=

However, up to today the government has maintained the ban on the entry of Bahá’í youth into public and private colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"&gt;{{cite web |author= |publisher= Small Media |title= Knowledge as Resistance: the Baha'i institute for Higher Education  |year=2013|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=https://smallmedia.org.uk/old/pdf/knowledge.pdf|format=PDF | page =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BIC2016-31-35"&gt;{{cite web |author=|publisher=Bahá’í International Community |title=The Bahá’í Question Revisited: Persecution and Resilience in Iran|year=2016|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=https://www.bic.org/sites/default/files/pdf/thebahaiquestionrevisited_final_160930e.pdf|format=PDF | pages =31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The official decree barring Bahá’í students from admission to public university was issued in 1981. That year universities established a new admission system where only individuals who identified themselves with one of the four religions recognized by the [[Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Iran]]– i.e. [[Islam]], [[Christianity]], [[Judaism]] and [[Zoroastrianism]] – were given admission.&lt;ref name="closed doors"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ihrdc_p50"&gt;{{cite web |author=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center |publisher=Iran Human Rights Documentation Center |title=A Faith Denied: The Persecution of the Baha'is of Iran |year=2007 |accessdate=2011-12-09|url=http://www.iranhrdc.org/files.php?force&amp;file=reports_en/A_Faith_Denied_Dec06_397039411.pdf|format=PDF | page = 50}}&lt;/ref&gt; The systematic expulsion of students and faculty had become clear to Bahá'ís by 1983.&lt;ref&gt;supra note 113, at page 259 of {{cite book | last =Nash | first = Geoffrey | chapter =The Persecution of the Bahá'í Community of Irán: 1979–1983 | chapterurl = | title =The Bahá'í World – Bahá'í Era 136–140, 1979–1983| editor-last = The Universal House of Justice | publisher = The Universal House of Justice | series = The Bahá'í World | volume =18 | edition = | year = 1986 | pages = 249–337 | url =http://bahai-library.com/books/bw18/ | isbn = 0-85398-234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, the government reiterated that policy, in a private memorandum prepared by the Iranian Revolutionary Council and approved by Ayatollah Khamenei which states that “The Government’s dealings with [the Bahá’ís] must be in such a way that their progress and development are blocked. ... They can be enrolled in schools provided they have not identified themselves as Bahá’ís. ... Preferably they should be enrolled in schools which have a strong and imposing religious ideology. ... They must be expelled from universities, either in the admission process or during the course of their studies, once it becomes known that they are Bahá’ís."&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;

Over the years, various ploys at different stages of university admission process including application, entrance examination and enrollment have been used to exclude Bahá'ís from public and private colleges and universities.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BIC2016-31-35"/&gt; From a small number of Bahá'í students who have been able to register and start their studies at universities, the majority have been expelled at some point before graduation.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;

After failed attempts to persuade the government of Iran to admit qualified Bahá'í students to universities, the Bahá'í community of Iran rallied its limited resources to make higher education available to its youth and young adults.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; In a collective effort, a small core of professors, lecturers and researchers who had been discharged from their jobs because of membership in the religion worked on developing an informal network of higher education.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; These efforts culminated in the establishment of the BIHE- initially known as the “scientific program” in 1987.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle"&gt;{{cite web |author=Sohrab Ahmari |publisher= The Chronicle of Higher Education |title=The Epic, Secret Struggle to Educate Iran's Bahais|year=2012 |accessdate=2016-12-24|url=http://www.chronicle.com/article/The-Epic-Secret-Struggle-to/131819/|format=PDF | page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gradually, the program expanded and took on a more formal character.&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt; By the mid-1990s, it had turned into an extensive institute which became to be known as the "open university" or Bahá'í Institute for Higher Education (BIHE).&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; With the advent of the internet and increasing assistance from collaborators abroad, BIHE’s curricular standards were bolstered and a wider range of majors and concentrations was introduced.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt;

Despite tremendous logistical constraints and the Iranian authorities’ attempts to shut BIHE down through raids, arrests and imprisonment of key faculty and staff,&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; the university has been producing impressive results, with many of its students continuing to Master and Doctoral programs in universities in other countries.&lt;ref name="chronicle"/&gt; Today, through the work of approximately 955 faculty and administrative staff, BIHE offers 18 undergraduate, 15 graduate and 5 associate degree programs in sciences, engineering, business and management, humanities, and social sciences.&lt;ref name="BIHE-history"&gt;{{cite web| title =History and Overview | work = | publisher = BIHE.org | year =  | url =http://www.bihe.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=35&amp;Itemid=198 | accessdate = 2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mode of operation ==

In its early days, BIHE functioned like a [[correspondence school]] with faculty and students exchanging lessons and assignments via the state-run postal system.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nazila147"&gt;{{cite book | last = Ghanea-Hercock | first = Nazila | title = Human rights, the UN and the Bahá'ís in Iran | publisher = Martinus Nijhoff Publishers | year = 2002 | pages = 147, 379 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=GeHNoviEXw0C&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA147#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-90-411-1953-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since professors could not deliver lectures openly, they prepared lecture notes and compiled textbooks for distribution to the students.&lt;ref name="closed doors26"&gt;{{cite web |author= |publisher=Bahá’í International Community |title= Closed Doors: Iran’s Campaign to Deny Higher Education to Bahá’ís|year=2005|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=http://denial.bahai.org/pdf/cd_all.pdf|format=PDF | page =26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon noticing that the government had been examining and intercepting the mail packages to disrupt the university’s work, the BIHE devised its own courier service through volunteer messengers, who collected assignments from all the students in a locality by motorbike, sorted them and then delivered them to the professors.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="closed doors26"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney morning"&gt;{{cite web | last =McKenny | first = Leesha | title =When learning goes underground | work = News | publisher = The Sydney Morning Herald | date = 2011-06-27 | url = http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac;jsessionid=4E761329EE1D5A93D3E8E256F5EA21A2?sy=afr&amp;pb=all_ffx&amp;dt=selectRange&amp;dr=1month&amp;so=relevance&amp;sf=text&amp;sf=headline&amp;rc=10&amp;rm=200&amp;sp=brs&amp;cls=355&amp;clsPage=1&amp;docID=SMH110627SK1KE5724M9| accessdate = 2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over time, with the expansion of its operation, the university started to organize small-group classes in private homes.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; These were complemented with specialized classrooms and laboratories organized in privately owned commercial buildings near and in [[Tehran]].&lt;ref name="CAUT"/&gt; The BIHE system also featured a network of special depository libraries in the private homes of Bahá'ís around the country. Numbering more than 45, these libraries enabled students in each district to obtain the necessary textbooks and course literature and material.&lt;ref name="closed doors26"/&gt;

Since 2005, the BIHE has undertaken a modernization and expansion program, which includes the full incorporation of the internet into its activities.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; As a result, currently BIHE operates on a model of hybrid learning which includes both traditional offline methods as well as increasing online components.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Reisz | first = Matthew | title =Preserving Education for the Baha'i | work = News | publisher = Times Higher Education | date =December 22, 2011 | url =http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/12/22/underground-online-institute-serves-bahai-students-iran | accessdate = February 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditional classroom and seminar presentations provide important learning spaces for BIHE students. In addition, many courses have evolved from exclusively offline events into hybrid ones.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; The incorporation of online components into BIHE’s delivery method has allowed the university to expand its courses and programs by using international faculty.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;

== Locations ==
The university does not have a physical campus. It operates using a hybrid model including both traditional face-to-face and online classes.&lt;ref name="smallmedia"/&gt; There is no specific location for in-person classes. They are rotating and held at the homes of students and other members of the Bahá’í community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Reisz | first = Matthew | title =Film shows fight for education by Iran’s Baha’is| work = News | publisher = Times Higher Education | date =September 18, 2014 | url =http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/12/22/underground-online-institute-serves-bahai-students-iran | accessdate =January 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Occasionally some classes are held at rented isolated locations. The hosts voluntarily offer their homes for in-person classes despite the threats and risks involved. Specific locations in Tehran and its vicinity, such as a floor of a residential home or a private commercial entity are prepared to be used as laboratories.&lt;ref name="closed doors26"/&gt; Many security measures are taken to avoid attracting attention. These laboratories have been raided numerous times by the government and sealed. Each time they have been reinstated at a different location after some time has passed.

==Distinctive features==

===Creative and constructive response to oppression===

The establishment of the BIHE has been regarded as a creative and non-violent response to the ongoing campaign of the Iranian government to deprive Iranian Bahá'í youth of access to higher education. Rather than losing their agency in the face of oppression, Iranian Bahá'ís have been actively constructing their own institution and empowering their youth through education.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAUT"/&gt; It has provided a constructive alternative to organizing politically against the authorities or feeling victimized.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;

BIHE has been praised for the model it offers to minority groups in self-preservation, coping, survival and thriving under discriminatory sociopolitical circumstances.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;

===Decentralized and fluid structure===
The Institute is decentralized and its functions reach the entire country through a combination of in-person and online classes with the former being held at the homes of students, faculty and other volunteer members of the community. In each province or region, local administrative assistants perform certain logistics and managerial tasks. Parts of the application and admission process as well as student advisory services and conducting examinations are also carried out throughout the same network on the local level. Lecturers construct their courses free from the prescriptions of a single organizational body and a networks of teaching assistants collaborate in the actual delivery of education.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; Independence of lecturers from administrators, teaching assistants from lecturers, and students from all – creates adaptability in the BIHE, and this facet of its character has been preserved and complemented by the ongoing process of modernization and the shift toward online learning.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;

=== Volunteerism and service ===

The BIHE relies to a great extent on the volunteerism and spirit of service.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; Bahá'í faculty members give their time as a form of community service and are not being paid.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; In addition to the academic staff, a network of community volunteers provide logistical support such as transportation, accommodation, and hosting of classes, exams and other academic events.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt; Over time, volunteering structures have evolved organically.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt; A study shows that the staff and the community members find volunteering in the BIHE a meaningful path of community service and are motivated by their feelings of love and care for the youth.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt; Many of the BIHE students who finish their graduate studies abroad choose to return to Iran to volunteer at BIHE despite knowing that they will face many difficulties.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAUT"/&gt;

===Community mobilization===

The BIHE is a participatory community-owned initiative through which a community has been able to draw from its own resources and talents to take charge of the development of its youth.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt; Broad grassroots input of everyone, and not just the elite, is welcomed and all members of the community are invited and motivated to contribute to a shared goal.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt; BIHE activities have also united and strengthened Bahá'í community cohesion despite the pressures of sociopolitical marginalization.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;

===Prolonged resilience===

The BIHE is a resilient organization, surviving approaching 3 decades.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; It came into existence against the backdrop of intense persecution. It has flourished despite formidable restraints and has survived and continued its work in the face of government’s campaigns to disrupt its work.&lt;ref name="chronicle" /&gt; In each crisis, the BIHE has proven itself adaptable and determined to continue working despite sustained opposition.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; Some see the BIHE’s ability to adapt to ever-changing circumstances as a key factor in its continued success.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; One study claims the synergy between marginalized but dedicated students working with marginalized but dedicated staff to be the source of the BIHE's resilience in the face of hostilities.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;

===Responding to social and emotional needs===

It is believed that BIHE responds to various social and emotional needs of discriminated students by providing them access to higher education and enabling them to remain socially and academically engaged.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt; A large number of BIHE staff are Iranian Bahá'ís who have been expelled from their jobs in academia as a result of their allegiance to the Bahá'í Faith. The opportunity to facilitate higher education services in BIHE has been a gratifying experience for them and helped them to cope with the pain of their own educational exclusion.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;

== Academics ==

=== Degrees and programs ===

As of 2016, BIHE offers a total of 38 university-level programs across five faculties in Sciences, Engineering, Business and Management, Humanities, and Social Sciences.&lt;ref name="BIHE homepage"&gt;{{cite web| title =BIHE home page | work = | publisher = BIHE.org | year =  | url =http://www.bihe.org/ | accessdate = 2016-12-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Faculty ===

As of 2016, the BIHE operates through the services of approximately 700 faculty,&lt;ref name="BIHE faculty"&gt;{{cite web| title =Faculty | work = | publisher = BIHE.org | year =  | url =http://bihe.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=80&amp;Itemid=202 | accessdate = 2017-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; who are academic and professionals residing in [[Iran]], and a network of affiliated global faculty that support the university through online courses, curriculum development and other services.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sydney morning"/&gt; A significant number of faculty are BIHE graduates.

At the outset, the administrators and faculty of BIHE were mainly Bahá'í professors dismissed from Iranian universities after the 1979 Islamic Revolution. Other faculty members included doctors, dentists, lawyers and engineers many of whom were fired from their jobs by the Iranian authorities following the Islamic revolution.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt; The university also drew on the expertise of a small and anonymous group of Bahá'í academics in [[North America]], [[Europe]] and [[Australia]], who sent the latest textbooks and research papers, occasionally made visits to Iran as guest lecturers, and otherwise provided instructional and technical support.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;

With the expansion of the online capabilities of the BIHE over the past decade or so, the university has also been assisted by a large and growing number of volunteer professors from around the world who form its Affiliated Global Faculty (AGF).&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;

Although catering to the Bahá'í community of Iran, the BIHE is hardly an exclusively Bahá'í institution. Non-Bahá'í Iranians both inside the country and as part of the university’s AGF network have worked with the BIHE and contributed to its success.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nobel"&gt;{{cite web |title = Iran's War Against Knowledge – An Open Letter to the International Academic Community  | publisher = Huffington Post | url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/desmond-tutu/iran-Bahá'í-_b_978090.html | accessdate = March 12, 2012 | date = September 26, 2011 | first = Desmond |last = Tutu | authorlink =Desmond Tutu| first2 = José | last2 = Ramos-Horta| authorlink2 = José Ramos-Horta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all of the professors and administrative staff of BIHE are volunteers who serve without receiving payment.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;

=== Graduates ===
In Iran, the BIHE graduates have attracted the praise of their employers in private corporations. Some of them have achieved high rank in the organizations, and some have contributed greatly to the social and economic enhancement of their community and Iranian society. Outside of Iran, certain BIHE graduates are currently working as professors and researchers in the academic and professional fields.

The vast majority of the graduates of the BIHE who have continued their education at Master's and PhD levels in other countries, have chosen to return to Iran to teach at BIHE or support it other ways. Some of them have later faced persecution such as imprisonment for their affiliation with the BIHE.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAUT"&gt;{{cite news| last =K.van den Hoonaard| first =Deborah | first2 = Pierre-Yves |last2=Mocquais |first3=Niky |last3=Kamran |first4=Redwan |last4=Moqbel |first5=Claire |last5=Lapointe |first6=David R. |last6=Smith |first7=Will C. |last7=van den Hoonaard |first8=Lisa |last8=Dufraimont |first9=Lyse |last9=Langlois |first10=Albert M. |last10=Berghuis |first11=W.

== Reputation and international recognition      ==
''[[The New York Times]]'' calls the BIHE "an elaborate act of communal self-preservation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/29/world/iran-closes-university-run-covertly-by-the-bahais.html?scp=1&amp;sq=%22an%20elaborate%20act%20of%20communal%20self-preservation%22&amp;st=cse | work=The New York Times| title = Iran Closes 'University' Run Covertly By the Bahais| date=October 29, 1998| first = Ethan | last = Bronner | accessdate = 2011-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIHE has received praise as one of the few examples of community-sponsored higher education service in a closed society,&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt; a non-violent, adaptive and constructive form of resistance against oppression&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt; and an example of empowerment through education.&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; It is believed that the BIHE can offer many lessons to organizations and activists tackling similar types of exclusion in closed societies across the world.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;&lt;ref name="smallmedia0"/&gt; The effectiveness of BIHE to deliver curricula has been studied, finding it to be a "social space" that enables Bahá'í students and staff to remain academically and socially engaged; to bond and share with peers and colleagues equally suffering from religious persecution; and to live up to principles such as learning, community service, and resistance in times of socio-political marginalization&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Saeedi | first = Nika | title = Resisting Educational Exclusion: The Bahá'í Institute of Higher Education | work = Social Sciences › Methodology of Social Sciences Papers | publisher =  Mendeley Ltd | year = 2006 | url = http://www.mendeley.com/research/resisting-educational-exclusion-the-bah-institute-of-higher-education/ | accessdate = February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well surviving because of international support, community sacrifices, and individual resiliency.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite thesis | last = Ghadirian  | first = Nayyer | title = An exploratory study examining the factors associated with the survival of underground education in an oppressive environment | page = 86 | publisher = Concordia University | year = 2009 | url = http://gradworks.umi.com/MR/63/MR63194.html | accessdate = February 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although BIHE degrees are not certified by the Iranian regime, since 1998 more than 80 universities in the [[North America]], [[Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[Asia]] have accepted BIHE qualifications and have admitted its graduates directly into programs of study at the masters and doctoral levels.&lt;ref name="BIHE homepage"/&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost2011"&gt;{{cite web| title =Graduation in Va. turns from celebration to vigil after arrests of Bahai in Iran  | work = | publisher = The Washington POst | year = 2011 | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/graduation-in-va-turns-from-celebration-to-vigil-after-arrests-of-bahai-in-iran/2011/06/05/AG6VPmJH_story.html | accessdate = 2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

== Pressure and attacks ==

Iranian authorities have continuously sought to disrupt the BIHE’s operation by raiding hundreds of Bahá'í homes and offices associated with it, by confiscating university materials and property and by arresting and imprisoning faculty members and administration staff.&lt;ref name="Karlberg"/&gt;

Between 1987 and 2005 the Iranian authorities closed down the university several times&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;  as part of the pattern of [[Persecution of Bahá'ís#Iran|suppressing the Bahá'í community]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Leith| first = John Barnabas | editor-last = Ghanea-Hercock | editor-first = Nazila | editor2-last =Stephens | editor2-first = Alan | editor3-last =Walden | editor3-first = Raphael | title = Does God believe in human rights?: essays on religion and human rights | publisher =Martinus Nijhoff Publishers| year =2007| page = 134 | url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0KGYMTtsK4C |chapter = A More Constructive Encounter: A Bahá'í View of Religion and Human Rights| chapterurl =https://books.google.com/books?id=Q0KGYMTtsK4C&amp;pg=PA134&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lm02T8i5MKr40gHp_7CxAg&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-90-04-15254-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They refused to sign any such declaration.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; Most of those who were arrested were released soon afterwards, but four were given prison sentence ranging from three to 10 years. The faculty, administrators and the students were all determined to continue the pursuit of knowledge against all odds.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;

In 2001 and 2002, three classrooms used by community members were seized, and an instructor was summoned to the intelligence agency. Authorities also disrupted—in July 2002—BIHE qualification examinations in eight different locations simultaneously, videotaping proceedings, interviewing students, and confiscating examination papers and Bahá’í books, thus demonstrating that the government pursues an established policy of intimidation.&lt;ref name="affolter_bihe"/&gt;

Another centrally orchestrated series of raids was carried out on the homes of some of the faculty members and administrators during 22–24 May 2011.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CAUT"/&gt; Officials from the Ministry of Intelligence entered the homes of at least 30 of the academic staff of the BIHE, seizing books, computers and personal effects.

The ''Iran Daily'', an official government newspaper, reported that "The BIHE university was a cover for the propagation of the Baha'i faith and was used to trap citizens in the Baha'i spy network and to gather information from within the county".

== International support and campaigns      ==

The attempts of the Iranian government to exclude Baha’is from higher education and the raids on the BIHE have drawn considerable international attention to the government of Iran’s oppressive policies against Baha’is.&lt;ref name="Yazdani"/&gt; International Human rights organizations such as entities at the United Nations have called for an end to religious discrimination against Baha’i students and various governments have pressed Iran to allow Baha’is back into university.&lt;ref name="closed doors8"&gt;{{cite web |author= |publisher=Bahá’í International Community |title= Closed Doors: Iran’s Campaign to Deny Higher Education to Bahá’ís|year=2005|accessdate=2016-12-24|url=http://denial.bahai.org/pdf/cd_all.pdf|format=PDF | page =8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education is Not a Crime ===

"Education is Not a Crime" was a worldwide campaign launched in November 2014 by [[Maziar Bahari]], an Iranian filmmaker and journalist to draw attention to the Iranian government's systematic denial of university education to young Baha'is.&lt;ref name="worldreligionsnews"&gt;{{cite news | title =Education is Not a Crime Initiative Gains Attention and Support| newspaper =   | publisher = World Religion News| date = February 21, 2015 | url =http://www.worldreligionnews.com/religion-news/bahai-faith/education-is-not-a-crime-initiative-gains-attention-support|accessdate = January 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="educationisnotacrime"&gt;{{cite news | title ="Education is Not a Crime" gains momentum| newspaper =   | publisher = Bahai World News Service | date = February 8, 2015 | url =http://news.bahai.org/story/1039|accessdate = January 17, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign was inspired by Bahari’s documentary film “[[To Light a Candle (film)|To Light a Candle]]” which was premiered in [[London]] in September 2014.

====Goals====
The campaign's stated goals are:&lt;ref name="Nobel"/&gt; 
* calling on the government of the Iranian Republic to release unconditionally and drop charges against the BIHE educators currently under arrest and facing charges related to their educational activities;
*  asks academic leaders, administrators and professors to register through any possible channels in the Iranian academic community their disagreement with and disapproval of any policy which would bar individuals from higher education based on their religious background or political persuasion, or which would remove or corrupt any established fields of study from a university curricula for religious or political reasons
* to encourage universities to review the educational quality of the BIHE coursework for possible acceptance of its credits, so that those who have had the benefit of its programs can continue at higher levels of study, and
* to offer available online university level curricula, through scholarships if needed, to students in Iran who would otherwise be deprived of the right to higher education or who, due to government limitation on social sciences, would not have a full array of educational options available to them in their own county.

[http://www.educationunderfire.com/ "Education Under Fire"] is a documentary produced by Single Arrow Productions and co-sponsored by [[Amnesty International]], which profiles the growth, struggle, and spirit of the BIHE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|people=|title=Education Under Fire|medium=|publisher=Single Arrow Productions|location=international|date=2011|url=http://www.educationunderfire.com/|first=|language=English|type=Motion Picture}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "[[To Light a Candle (film)|To Light a Candle]]" is another documentary film by journalist [[Maziar Bahari]], premiered in 2014, which focuses on the stories of the individuals associated with the attempted shutdown of BIHE. [https://vimeo.com/29559419 "CopyRight"] is a fiction 16mm short film based on the story of volunteers at the BIHE.

There are also references to BIHE in other documentary films. For instance, [[Iranian Taboo]], a 2011 documentary film by [[Netherlands|Dutch]] film-maker [[Reza Allamehzadeh]], which focuses on the persecution of Bahá'ís in Iran, has some references to BIHE.

'''Bundahishn [[Help:IPA/English|/bʊndaˈhɪʃn/]]''' Avestan: 𐬠𐬎𐬥 𐬛𐬀𐬵𐬌𐬱𐬥𐬍𐬵 Bun-dahišnīh , meaning "Primal Creation", is the name traditionally given to an encyclopediaic collection of [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] [[cosmogony]] and [[cosmology]] written in [[Book Pahlavi]].&lt;ref&gt;M. Hale, ''Pahlavi'', in "The Ancient Languages of Asia and the Americas", Published by Cambridge University Press, 2008, {{ISBN|0-521-68494-3}}, p. 123.&lt;/ref&gt; The original name of the work is not known.

Although the Bundahishn draws on the [[Avesta]] and develops ideas alluded to in those texts, it is not itself scripture. The content reflects Zoroastrian scripture, which, in turn, reflects both ancient Zoroastrian and pre-Zoroastrian beliefs. In some cases, the text alludes to contingencies of post-7th century [[Islam in Iran]], and in yet other cases, such as the idea that the Moon is farther than the stars, it reiterates scripture even though science had, by then, determined otherwise.

==Structure==
The traditionally given name seems to be an adoption of the sixth word from the first sentence of the younger of the two recensions.&lt;ref name="MacKenzie" /&gt; The older of the two [[recension]]s has a different first line, and the first translation of that version adopted the name ''[[Zand-Ākāsīh]]'', meaning "Zand-knowing", from the first two words of its first sentence.

Most of the chapters of the compendium date to the 8th and 9th centuries, roughly contemporary with the oldest portions of the  ''[[Denkard]]'', which is another significant text of the "Pahlavi"&lt;!--don't link--&gt; (i.e. Zoroastrian [[Middle Persian]]) collection. The later chapters are several centuries younger than the oldest ones. The oldest existing copy dates to the mid-16th century.

The ''Bundahishn'' survives in two [[recension]]s. A shorter was found in India, and is thus known as the ''Lesser Bundahishn'', or ''[[Indian Bundahishn]]''. A copy of this version was brought to Europe by [[Abraham Hyacinthe Anquetil-Duperron|Abraham Anquetil-Duperron]] in 1762. A longer version was brought to India from Iran by T.D.&lt;!--Tehmuras Dinshawji--&gt; Anklesaria around 1870, and is thus known as the ''Greater Bundahishn'' or ''[[Iranian Bundahishn]]'' or just ''Bundahishn''. The greater recension (the name of which is abbreviated ''GBd'' or just ''Bd'') is about twice as long as the lesser (abbreviated ''IBd'').

The two recensions derive from different manuscript traditions, and in the portions available in both sources, vary (slightly) in content. The greater recension is also the older of the two, and was dated by West to around 1540. The lesser recension dates from about 1734.

Traditionally, chapter-verse pointers are in [[Arabic]] numerals for the lesser recension, and [[Roman numerals]] for the greater recension. The two series' are not synchronous since the lesser recension was analyzed (by Duperrron in 1771) before the extent of the greater recension was known. The chapter order is also different.

==Content==
The ''Bundahishn'' is the concise view of the Zoroastrianism's creation myth, and of the first battles of the forces of [[Ahura Mazda]] and [[Angra Mainyu]] for the hegemony of the world. According to the text, in the first 3,000 years of the cosmic year, Ahura Mazda created the [[Fravashi]]s and conceived the idea of his would-be creation. He used the insensible and motionless Void as a weapon against Angra Mainyu, and at the end of that period, Angra Mainyu was forced to submission and fell into a stupor for the next 3,000 years. Taking advantage of Angra Mainyu's absence, Ahura Mazda created the [[Amesha Spentas]] (Bounteous Immortals), representing the primordial elements of the material world, and permeated his kingdom with ''Ard'' ([[Asha]]), "Truth" in order to prevent Angra Mainyu from destroying it. The Bundahishn finally recounts the creation of the primordial bovine, Ewagdad (Avestan [[Gavaevodata]]), and Gayomard (Avestan [[Gayomart|Gayomaretan]]), the primordial human.

Following MacKenzie,&lt;ref name=MacKenzie&gt;{{citation|last=MacKenzie|first=David Neil|chapter=Bundahišn|title=Encyclopedia Iranica|volume=4|pages=547–551|year=1990|publisher=Mazda|location=Costa Mesa|chapter-url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/bundahisn-primal-creation}}.&lt;/ref&gt; the following chapter names in quotation marks reflect the original titles. Those without quotation marks are summaries of chapters that have no title. The chapter/section numbering scheme is based on that of B.T.&lt;!--Behramgore Tehmuras--&gt; Anklesaria&lt;ref name="BT_Anklesaria"&gt;{{citation|last=Anklesaria|first=Behramgore Tehmuras, trans., ed.|title=Zand-Ākāsīh, Iranian or Greater Bundahišn.

'''Excerpt from Chapter 2:- On the formation of the luminaries.'''

1. Ohrmazd produced illumination between the sky and the earth, the [[constellation]] stars and those also not of the constellations, then the moon, and afterwards the sun, as I shall relate.

2. First he produced the [[celestial sphere]], and the constellation stars are assigned to it by him; especially these twelve whose names are [[Aries (constellation)|Varak]] (the Lamb), [[Taurus (constellation)|Tora]] (the Bull), [[Gemini (constellation)|Do-patkar]] (the Two-figures or Gemini), [[Cancer (constellation)|Kalachang]] (the Crab), [[Leo (constellation)|Sher]] (the Lion), [[Virgo (constellation)|Khushak]] (Virgo), [[libra (constellation)|Tarazhuk]] (the Balance), [[Scorpio (constellation)|Gazdum]] (the Scorpion), [[Sagittarius (constellation)|Nimasp]] (the Centaur or Sagittarius), [[Capricorn (constellation)|Vahik]] (Capricorn), [[Aquarius (constellation)|Dul]] (the Water-pot), and [[Pisces (constellation)|Mahik]] (the Fish);

3. which, from their original creation, were divided into the [[Lunar mansion|twenty-eight subdivisions]] of the astronomers, of which the names are Padevar, Pesh-Parviz, Parviz, Paha, Avesar, Beshn, Rakhvad, Taraha, Avra, Nahn, Miyan, Avdem, Mashaha, Spur, Husru, Srob, Nur, Gel, Garafsha Varant, Gau, Goi, Muru, [[Beta Aquarii|Bunda]], Kahtsar, Vaht, Miyan, Kaht.

4. And all his original creations, residing in the world, are committed to them; so that when the destroyer arrives they overcome the adversary and their own persecution, and the creatures are saved from those adversities.

5. As a specimen of a warlike army, which is destined for battle, they have ordained every single constellation of those 6480 thousand small stars as assistance; and among those constellations [[royal stars|four chieftains]], appointed on the four sides, are leaders.

6. On the recommendation of those chieftains the many unnumbered stars are specially assigned to the various quarters and various places, as the united strength and appointed power of those constellations.

7. As it is said that [[royal stars|Tishtar]] is the chieftain of the east, [[royal stars|Sataves]] the chieftain of the west, [[royal stars|Vanand]] the chieftain of the south, and [[royal stars|Haptoring]] the chieftain of the north.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4225">The '''Children of Artemis''' is a [[UK]]-based [[Witchcraft]] membership organisation that organises '''Witchfests'''; regular [[Wicca]]n and [[Witchcraft]] themed festivals and conferences, periodically held in [[London]], [[Glasgow]] and [[Cardiff]]. They publish the magazine ''Witchcraft &amp; Wicca''.

==History==
The Children of Artemis (CoA) first started out as a [[ritual]] group. The CoA continued as a small group until 1995, when it was transformed into a public membership organisation. Initially it grew slowly until around 1999–2000, and then with the established of CoA's website, magazine and events, CoA quickly became [[market leader]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,,1213743,00.html Guardian Unlimited], last accessed May 15th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structure===
CoA is staffed almost entirely by [[volunteering|volunteers]], who are given responsibility for their areas of expertise, which includes Witchfests, the magazine, the website, and all other areas of the organisation. It has no [[hierarchy]], no [[title]]s, and as there are no political positions, it holds no [[elections]]. It is a [[Religion-supporting organization|religious organisation]] dedicated to Wicca and Witchcraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.witchcraft.org/about.htm The Objectives of The Children of Artemis] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423093014/http://www.witchcraft.org/about.htm |date=2009-04-23 }}, last accessed May 15th, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Community activities==
The core Children of Artemis team helped the [[Pagan Federation]] organise their conferences in 1997 and 1998. This period lasted two years, during which CoA did not develop as its resources were being fully utilised helping the other organisation. The PF president took personal control of the conference in 1999, this allowed CoA to focus back onto its own development. The first Witchfest event came three years later in November 2002.

The [[Coven]] finding service was ceased in 2003, as there were not enough Covens accepting trainees. To attempt to address this lack of opportunity, CoA has run [http://www.witchfest.net/wiccaintro.htm "''Wicca Introduced''"] courses twice a year, and now funds a few Open Rituals.

Children of Artemis was one of the founding members of the Pagan Symposium, a group of Pagan and Heathen Organisations that actively co-operate on a variety of issues and projects. Children of Artemis also hosts the Pagan Symposium's website for the community. &lt;ref&gt;http://pagansymposium.org/&lt;/ref&gt;

CoA sponsors and helps organise a variety of independent community events, recent examples include&lt;ref&gt;Doreen Valliente Foundation Gerald Gardner Blue paque unveiling, Pagan Pride Nottigham, Pagan Pride South, Pagan Symposium web site, sponsored events are shown here http://witchfest.net/?s=&amp;event-category%5B%5D=20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
According to some members of both the Pagan and non-Pagan communities, CoA's attempts to mass market itself has not made it popular with several other pagan and Wicca or Witchcraft organisations.

===Aesthetic considerations===
[[Image:Issue 18, Lammas 2009.jpg|thumb|right|The magazine, "''Witchcraft &amp; Wicca''", published by the Children of Artemis. Issue 18, Lammas 2009.]]

Critics of the CoA have raised concerns about the image that their magazine puts across: the magazine "''Witchcraft &amp; Wicca''" is glossier than most of the publications produced by pagan groups in the UK, and appears to be aimed at a younger [[target audience]], and features large quantities of crushed velvet and similar "spooky" dress. It is argued that this has a detrimental effect of the public perception of [[Paganism]], detracting from its status as an accepted religion, and promoting it as a [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle choice]].

[[Christianity]] is the largest religion in Norway. Norway has historically been called a ''Christian country''. A majority of the population are members of the [[Church of Norway]] with 71.5% of the population officially belonging to the [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Norway]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=stat2016statechurch&gt;{{cite web|title=Church of Norway, 2016|url=http://www.ssb.no/en/kultur-og-fritid/statistikker/kirke_kostra/aar/|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=4 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=stat2013other&gt;{{cite web|title=Religious communities and life stance communities, 1 January 2013|url=http://www.ssb.no/en/kultur-og-fritid/statistikker/trosamf/aar/2013-12-04|publisher=Statistics Norway|accessdate=3 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; At numerous times in history, Norway sent more missionaries per capita than any other country. This changed considerably from the 1960s. In 2004, only 12% of the population attended church services each month.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nsd.uib.no/nsd/nsdnytt/06-1/2.html Norsk samfunnsvitenskapelig datatjeneste - Få nordmenn i kirken, men ikke færre enn før]&lt;/ref&gt; Citizens born in Norway to one or two Norwegian parents are automatically added to the list of [[Protestant]] Christians in Norway, and are required to "sign out" of the church. There are two categories kept in the church's books, "medlemmer" (members) and "tilhørige" (belonging to [the State church]). Members technically have to be baptised, whereas "tilhørige" are to be taken out of the books if not baptised by the age of 18. Norwegian citizens' tax funds are given to the Protestant Church until one registers as a member of another religious group, or as a member of the Humanist association.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kirken.no/?event=doLink&amp;famID=3171]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, there were 4,981 churches and [[chapel]]s in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.idag.no/aktuelt-oppslag.php3?ID=4997 Hvor mange aktive kristne finnes i Norge?]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Christianization ==

{{See also|Christianization of Scandinavia}}

[[Image:Sami Jienat.jpg|thumb|[[Sami religion|Shamanism]] persisted among the [[Sami people|Sami]] up until the 18th century, but no longer exists in its traditional form. Most [[Sami people|Sami]] today belong to the [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] [[church of Norway]].]]
[[Image:Heddal Stabkirche Gegenlicht.jpg|thumb|[[Heddal stave church|Heddal]] [[stave church]] from early 13th century]]

The conversion of Norway to Christianity began in 1000 AD. The raids on Ireland, Britain and the Frankish kingdoms had brought the Vikings in touch with Christianity. [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon the Good of Norway]] who had grown up in England tried to introduce Christianity in the tenth century, but had met resistance from pagan leaders and soon abandoned the idea.

Anglo-Saxon missionaries from England and Germany engaged in converting Norwegians to Christianity, but with limited success. However, they succeeded in converting [[Olav Tryggvason|Olaf I of Norway]] to Christianity. [[Olaf II of Norway]] (later Saint Olaf) had more success in his efforts to convert the population, and he is credited with Christianising Norway.

The Christians in Norway often established churches or other holy sites at places that had previously been sacred under the Norse religion. The spread of conversion can be measured by burial sites as Pagans were buried with [[grave goods]] while Christians weren't. Christianity had become well established in Norway by the middle of the 11th century and had become dominant by the middle of the 12th century. [[Stave church]]es were built of wood without the use of nails in the 13th century.

The above numbers reflect the percentage of the population that are members of a church, typically from being baptized as infants.  Less than half of these define themselves as Christian.  &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.aftenposten.no/norge/i/3jJb9/Flertallet-av-kirkemedlemmene-er-ikke-kristne Flertallet av kirkemedlemmene er ikke kristne]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Compared with other countries ==

=== Church attendance ===

Early 21st century, Norway had one of the lowest [[church attendance]] rates in the world. Below is a table that compares Norway with other governmental divisions in regular church attendance for the early 21st century (2004-2006). In contrast to 250,000 regular churchgoers in the whole of Norway in 2004, 43,500 attend [[Lakewood Church]] in the United States each week, and 23,000 attend  [[Hillsong Church]] in Australia each week.

The [[U.S. state]] of [[Alabama]] has a population roughly equal to that of Norway, but church attendance in [[Alabama]] is as much as 11 times higher than in Norway.

[[Image:StOlavsOsloFeb2009.jpg|thumb|[[St. Olav's Cathedral in Oslo|St. Olav Catholic Cathedral]] in [[Oslo]].]]
{{Main|Catholic Church in Norway}}

The Catholic Church in Norway is part of the worldwide [[Catholic Church]], under the spiritual leadership of the [[Pope]] and the [[Roman Curia|Curia]] in Rome. Per 15 October 2012 the church had 115, 234 registered members. The number has increased from 59, 350 in 2008 due to high immigration. There may be approximately 170,000–200,000 people of Catholic background in the country, most of them immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Andreas Slettholm: [http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/Na-er-det-flere-katolikker-enn-muslimer-i-Norge-7033287.html Nå er det flere katolikker enn muslimer i Norge] Aftenposten, 3 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is divided into three Church districts – the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Oslo|Diocese of Oslo]] and the [[prelature]]s of [[Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Trondheim|Trondheim]] and [[Roman Catholic Territorial Prelature of Tromsø|Tromsø]] and 32 parishes. The Bishop of Oslo participates in the [[Scandinavian Bishops Conference]]. The Catholic Church in Norway is as old as the kingdom itself, dating from approximately 900 A.D., with the first Christian monarchs, [[Haakon I of Norway|Haakon I]] from 934.

At first, the bulk of Catholic immigrants came from Germany, The Netherlands, and France. Immigration from Chile, the Philippines, and from a wide range of other countries began in the 1970s. This development has further increased in the last few years with economic immigrants from Poland and Lithuania. Ethnic Norwegian Catholics are now greatly outnumbered by the immigrants, although the former tend to be far more observant and conservative, being a [[self-selected]] group largely of ex-Lutheran converts.{{citation needed|date=December 2012}}

'''Coptic nationalism''' refers to the nationalism of [[Copts]] ({{lang-cop|ⲚⲓⲢⲉⲙ̀ⲛⲭⲏⲙⲓ ̀ⲛ̀Ⲭⲣⲏⲥⲧⲓ̀ⲁⲛⲟⲥ}} ''{{transl|co|Niremenkīmi Enkhristianos}}'', {{lang-arz|أقباط}} ''{{transl|arz|Aqbat}}''), an [[ethno-religious]] group&lt;ref&gt;[[#Minahan|Minahan 2002]], p. 467&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=October 2018}} that primarily inhabit the area of modern [[Egypt]], where they are the largest [[Christianity in Egypt|Christian denomination]].

== Pharaonism ==
{{main article|Pharaonism}}
Questions of Egyptian identity rose to prominence in Egypt in the 1920s and 1930s as Egyptians sought independence from British occupation. The Pharaonist movement, or Pharaonism, looks to Egypt's pre-Islamic past and argued that Egypt was part of a larger Mediterranean civilization. Many Coptic intellectuals hold to "Pharaonism," which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Pharaonic culture, and is not indebted to Greece. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. Pharaonism was widely held by Coptic and Muslim scholars in the early 20th century, and it helped bridge the divide between those groups. Most scholars today see Pharaonism as a late development shaped primarily by western [[Orientalism]], and doubt its validity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Jacques | last = van der Vliet | title = The Copts: 'Modern Sons of the Pharaohs'? | journal = Church History &amp; Religious Culture |date=June 2009 | volume = 89 | issue = 1–3 | pages = 279–90 | doi=10.1163/187124109x407934}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first = Donald Malcolm | last = Reid| title= Whose Pharaohs?: Archaeology, Museums, and Egyptian National Identity from Napoleon to World War I | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=FeviPDy08e8C&amp;pg=PA258 |year= 2003|publisher= U. of California Press|pages= 258ff | chapter = 7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==  Coptic identity==
{{main article|Coptic identity}}
'''Coptic identity''' as it stands now saw its roots in the 1950s with the rise of pan-Arabism under [[Nasser]]. Up to that point, [[Egyptian nationalism]] was the major form of expression for [[Egyptians#Identity|Egyptian identity]],&lt;ref name="Haeri, Niloofar 2003, pp. 47, 136"&gt;Haeri, Niloofar. ''Sacred language, Ordinary People: Dilemmas of Culture and Politics in Egypt''.

"The Arab Middle East and the Modern World", International Affairs, vol. xxii, no. 4 (October 1946), p. 519.&lt;/ref&gt; The struggle to ascertain this Egyptian identity began as Nasser and his regime tried to impose an Arab identity on the country, and attempted to erase all references to Egypt as a separate and unique entity.&lt;ref name="nationalcopticassembly.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalcopticassembly.com/showart.php?main_id%3D1724 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304035013/http://nationalcopticassembly.com/showart.php?main_id=1724 |archivedate=2016-03-04 |df= }}{{unreliable source?|date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Coptic flag''' was created in 2005 by a Coptic activist group called "The Free Copts" as an [[ethnic flag]] representing [[Copts]], [[Coptic identity]] and as a sign of opposition to [[Islamic]] authority in [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://freecopts.blogspot.com/2005/12/coptic-flag-meanings-and-colors.html|title=The Coptic Flag, Meanings and Colors by The Free Copts|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070114194300/http://freecopts.blogspot.com/2005/12/coptic-flag-meanings-and-colors.html|archive-date=2007-01-14|access-date=2016-10-03|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is not recognized by the [[Coptic Orthodox Church]] or the [[Coptic Catholic Church]] but has been adopted by the New Zealand Coptic Association in defiance of directives from their own religious leaders condemning its use.

The '''Coptic Flag''' consists of two main components: a blue cross and a colorful coat of arms.
* The cross represents [[Coptic Orthodox Church of Alexandria|Christianity]], the Copts' religion. The blue color stems from the Egyptian sky and water. It also reminds the Copts of their persecution, when some of Muslim rulers forced their ancestors to wear heavy crosses around their necks until their necks became blue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mycopticchurch.com/ask/Messages/ViewThread.cfm?ThreadMode=Next&amp;ThreadID=2554 My Coptic Church - Ask A Copt]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;El-Shamy, Hasan M.

* The top of the coat of arms is decorated with [[Coptic cross]]es intertwined with [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flowers, representing Egyptian identity. Coptic crosses are made of four arms equal in length, each of which is crossed by a shorter arm (similar to the heraldic [[Crosses in heraldry#Classical heraldry|cross crosslet fitchy]] or [[cross bottony]]). The [[lotus (plant)|lotus]] flower, also known as the [[Egyptian White Water-lily]] (''Nymphaea lotus''), has been a [[symbol of creation]] since [[Ancient Egypt]]ian times. Remains of the flower were found in the burial tomb of [[Pharaoh]] [[Ramesses II]]. Hence, its use on the flag represents the desire of all Coptic people to overthrow the Arab Islamic government and restore a native [[monarchy]].
The black background behind the ornaments is a symbol of Kimi or Kemet, the [[Egyptian language|Egyptian]] name of Egypt, which means the Black Land. 
Beneath these ornaments is a green line in the middle of the coat of arms, which represents the [[Nile Valley]]. Around it are two yellow lines that symbolize the Eastern and [[Western Desert (North Africa)|Western]] Deserts of Egypt. These two lines are in turn flanked by two blue lines that represent the [[Mediterranean Sea]] and the [[Red Sea]] that enclose Egypt. Finally, these lines are separated by red lines symbolizing Coptic blood, which has been shed all over Egypt since Egyptians adopted Christianity and until today.

==Background and personal life==
Irani was born into a [[Zoroastrian]] family and her mother-tongue is [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]]. She is the eldest of three sisters, the other two being [[Honey Irani]] and Menaka Irani. Her younger sister Honey, who was also a child-star, went on to marry script-writer [[Javed Akhtar]] and is the mother of [[Farhan Akhtar]] and [[Zoya Akhtar]]. Irani's other sister, Menaka, is married to the stunt film-maker Kamran Khan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = ‘I told Shah Rukh.. |publisher= The Telegraph| url = http://www.telegraphindia.com/1071007/asp/7days/story_8405201.asp|date=7 October 2007| accessdate = 2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the mother of film-makers [[Sajid Khan (Director)|Sajid Khan]] and [[Farah Khan]].

Daisy married screenwriter K. K.

She has three children, a son named Kabir and two daughters, Varsha and Ritu. None of her children is involved with the entertainment industry in any capacity.

Although born a [[Zoroastrian]] and married to a [[Hindu]], Daisy grew interested in [[Christianity]] later in life. In 1975, she became a member of New Life Fellowship in Mumbai.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = I knew nothing about Jesus Christ earlier: Daisy Irani Shukla |publisher=The Christian Messenger| url = http://www.christianmessenger.in/i-knew-nothing-about-jesus-christ-earlier-daisy-irani-shukla/ | date=8 November 2013|accessdate = 2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018, Daisy revealed that she had been raped at the age of 6&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ndtv.com/entertainment/actress-daisy-irani-reveals-she-was-raped-at-6-by-man-appointed-as-her-guardian-1827619&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Career==
During the Golden Age (1950s–70s) of Hindi cinema, some child stars had great visibility. The Irani sisters, Daisy and Honey, who generally played boys with curly hair, became household names.&lt;ref name=hindu&gt;{{cite web| title = Honey Irani... happy and sweet |author=Rana A. Siddiqui|publisher=The Hindu| url = http://www.hindu.com/thehindu/mp/2003/05/22/stories/2003052200680200.htm |date=22 May 2003| accessdate = 2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The films that had both of them fetched the biggest openings. Stories were re-written to include them in the cast or increase their footage, and they were prominently publicized in the promos of their movies. Their most-remembered movies, together or separate, include ''Bandish'', ''[[Jagte Raho]]'', ''Bhai Bhai'', ''[[Naya Daur (1957 film)|Naya Daur]]'', ''Hum Panchi Ek Dal Ke'', ''Musafir'', ''Sahara'', ''Quedi No. 9211'', ''Duniya Na Mane'', ''Do Ustad'', ''Dhool Ka Phool'', ''Soorat Aur Seerat'' and ''Chandi Ki Diwar''. Daisy, who was more popular than her younger sister as a child artiste, continued to act after growing up, though not in any significant roles.

She quit films after her marriage in 1971, with her last release being ''Kati Patang'' in 1971. In the 1980s, she worked in theatre for a while and started an acting school. After the death of her husband in the early 1990s, she returned to acting in the comedy TV series ''[[Dekh Bhai Dekh]]'' and films such as [[Aastha: In the Prison of Spring|''Aastha'']] (1997), ''Kya Kehna'' and ''Shararat'' (2002).&lt;ref name=today&gt;{{cite web | title = Lost and found: Thirty newsmakers from the pages of Indian history and where they are now: Cover Story|publisher=India Today| url =http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/thirty-newsmakers-from-the-pages-of-indian-history/1/181091.html|date=3 July 2006| accessdate = 2013-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious views ==
D. Amogolonova, a lead researcher of Institute for Mongolian, Buddhist and Tibetan Studies of the Siberian branch of RAS, notes that Damba Ayusheev has critical opinion on Buryat shamanism and the Russian Buddhist organizations non entering into the Buddhist Traditional Sangkha of Russia, and “does not mark the frontiers between confessions and considers everyone who believes in supreme forces by 60% (sic!) as a Buddhist”.{{sfn|Амоголонова|2015|p=32}}

'''''Dell Horoscope''''' is a periodic American magazine published by [[Penny Publications]] covering modern astrology, calling itself "the world's leading astrology magazine". Subscriptions are offered in print and digital formats.  Print versions are found on newsstands or often in supermarket checkouts. In addition to the monthly periodical, annual yearbooks are published as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.richlandlibrary.com/research-it/resources/dell-horoscope|title=Dell Horoscope|website=Richland Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/dell-horoscope-penny-publications/1109623085|title=Dell Horoscope|website=Barnes and Noble}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to its most recent statement of ownership published in the January 2018 issue, paid circulation of the magazine is 22,407 per issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/427511178|title=The astrology book : the encyclopedia of heavenly influences|last=R.|first=Lewis, James|date=2003|publisher=Visible Ink Press|others=Lewis, James R.|year=|isbn=9781578591442|edition= 2nd|location=Detroit|pages=821|oclc=427511178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9255">A proposal to create a [[Islamic burial|Muslim cemetery]] by the Islamic Society of Greater [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] on {{convert|55 |acre}} of farmland in [[Dudley, Massachusetts]] elicited intense community opposition when discussed at a public hearing in February 2016.&lt;ref name="telegram/20160213"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20160213/NEWS/160219577|title=Local Muslims address opposition on Dudley cemetery bid|first=Kim |last=Ring  |date=February 13, 2016 |newspaper=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]|location= Worcester, Massachusetts|access-date=17 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Islamic Society sought to establish a closer burial place than [[Enfield, Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wbur.org/2016/02/05/muslim-cemetery-proposal|title=Proposal For Muslim Cemetery In Dudley Meets Opposition From Residents|first=David |last=Boeri|date= February 5, 2016|work=[[WBUR-FM|WBUR]]|access-date=15 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After a complicated process, with much back and forth between the Islamic Society and town officials, the necessary permit was issued over a year later.&lt;ref name="BG 2017/03/03"/&gt;

==Proceedings==
At the initial hearings, some residents made it clear that they did not want this cemetery in their town with concerns that included noise, traffic and well water contamination issues.&lt;ref name="telegram/20160213"/&gt; The comments of some of the small town's residents raised concerns of religious bigotry.&lt;ref name="telegram/20160609"/&gt; At the meeting, all the speakers in support of the Islamic Society were booed, and members of the public variously denounced the need to bury Muslim dead locally compared to the deaths of American soldiers fighting radical Islamic terrorist groups overseas, called the existing cemetery a "pigsty", and called the Society's attempt to build a cemetery a "crusade" (both offensive given Islam's consideration of pigs as ritually unclean, and the history of Christian [[Crusades]] conquering parts of the Middle East).&lt;ref name="globe_suit" /&gt;  Though Muslim tradition is to bury without a coffin, in response to concerns about water quality the Islamic Society promised to use vaults.&lt;ref name="globe_suit" /&gt;

A series of test pits dug by the applicant, with the Dudley Board of Health Inspector present, showed that the average water table was 24" below the grade of the ground, with many spots having ground water only 18" from the surface.&lt;ref&gt;http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/3782/9463/original.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://a.disquscdn.com/uploads/mediaembed/images/3782/9461/original.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; The public hearing of the Zoning Board of Appeals reviewed the status of the land as an agricultural protected parcel protected under MGL Chapter 61A.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartI/TitleIX/Chapter61A|title=General Laws: CHAPTER 61A|website=malegislature.gov|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  At a town meeting held on May 23, 2016, action was postponed authorizing the Board of Selectman to exercise the Town's first right of refusal in order to proceed to purchase the agricultural piece of land. When the Zoning Board of Appeals met on June 2, 2016 they asked the Islamic Society of Worcester if they were presenting a revised 5 Acre cemetery plan which they had read about in the newspapers the week before.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/article/20160520/NEWS/160529741|title=Islamic Society agrees to smaller cemetery in Dudley|newspaper=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]|location= Worcester, Massachusetts|date=May 20, 2016|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Islamic Society of Worcester stated there was no revised plan and they expected the Zoning Board of Appeals to vote on their original proposal for 12,000+ grave sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lflutgXb57U&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;list=PLrzLL2JZv6l6Z3kfRqkP5fG4WJu6yK6Ji|title=Zoning 2016 06 02|first=|last=Town of Dudley Massachusetts|date=14 September 2016|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zoning Board of Appeals then scheduled a full vote for June 9, 2016, at which it denied the permit on the grounds the land was under Chapter 61A conservation protection and the town of Dudley thus had the right of first refusal to purchase the land.  The board claimed that this meant the Islamic Society of Worcester lacked the proper legal standing to submit the cemetery plan until after the town's right of refusal had been extinguished.  The Society complained that it could not complete the purchase of the land and gain the standing the board required of it until the zoning approval had been granted, because its purchase agreement was contingent upon that action, putting the Society in a [[Catch-22]] situation.&lt;ref name="telegram/20160609"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/news/20160609/dudley-zoning-board-rejects-muslim-cemetery-application|title=Dudley zoning board rejects Muslim cemetery application|newspaper=[[Telegram &amp; Gazette]]|location= Worcester, Massachusetts|date=June 9, 2016|access-date=2016-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The denial prompted a federal investigation by the U.S Attorney into potential religious discrimination,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/12/attorney-closes-investigation-religious-discrimination-dudley/nY1if7dvOcOBsoWxl7uHGP/story.html|title=U.S. Attorney closes investigation of religious discrimination in Dudley - The Boston Globe|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a warning letter from the Massachusetts Attorney General.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wbur.org/all-things-considered/2016/12/02/healey-dudley-cemetery-letter|title=Mass. Attorney General's Office Weighs In On Proposed Dudley Islamic Cemetery|website=www.wbur.org|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Massachusetts chapter of the [[ACLU]] filed a lawsuit in state land court, claiming the denial violated freedom of religion provisions in the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]], the [[Massachusetts Declaration of Rights]], the Federal Religious Land Use and Institutionalized Persons Act, and the state [[Dover Amendment]] (which exempts certain religious organizations from zoning regulations).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegram.com/news/20160708/aclu-boston-law-firm-take-up-muslim-cemetery-case|title=ACLU, Boston law firm take up Muslim cemetery case|first=Debbie|last=LaPlaca|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also claimed the Chapter 61A protection was not applicable to conversion to cemetery use.&lt;ref name="globe_suit"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2016/07/05/islamic-group-files-suit-accusing-dudley-illegally-blocking-muslim-cemetery-plans/9TpLhOUWs8S3z2QoGmHPbM/story.html|title=Islamic group files suit accusing Dudley of illegally blocking Muslim cemetery plans - The Boston Globe|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The town Attorney argued that the Muslim cemetery, unlike Christian cemeteries, was not a religious land use due to differences between where Muslim and Christian burial rituals are held.

Both sides came to an agreement in December 2016 with the zoning board granting the permit for the cemetery on March 3, 2017. Burials will be restricted to {{convert|6 |acres}} for the first 10-years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.wbur.org/news/2017/03/03/dudley-muslim-cemetery-permit|title=Islamic Society Wins Permit For Muslim Cemetery In Dudley After Protracted, Bitter Clash|work=[[WBUR]] |first=David |last=Boeri|date=March 3, 2017|access-date=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The permit requires a buffer zones of vegetation between the burials and the neighboring property in accordance with the agreement.&lt;ref name="BG 2017/03/03"&gt;{{cite news|title=Plan for Muslim cemetery in Dudley clears last hurdle|newspaper=[[Boston Globe]]|first=Brian |last=MacQuarrie|date=March 3, 2017|access-date=18 March 2017|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/03/03/plan-for-muslim-cemetery-dudley-clears-last-hurdle/Xx4WdIQ7WX4tywuuRXu5qJ/story.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  After winning this approval (though not final Board of Health approval) and affirming its rights, the Islamic Society dropped its plans to build a cemetery in Dudley, and instead moved forward with plans to bury Muslim dead in a city-owned cemetery in Worcester, partly due to lower cost and parly because the city was more welcoming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/metro/2017/04/13/after-bitter-fight-for-approval-islamic-society-abruptly-drops-plan-for-cemetery-town-dudley/JZ7H61XR2fxMc88AcZp6ZN/story.html|title=After bitter fight for approval, Islamic Society abruptly drops plan for cemetery in town of Dudley - The Boston Globe|publisher=|accessdate=21 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The U.S. Attorney announced on April 12, 2017 that it was closing the investigation whether town officials had violated federal civil rights law that prohibits religious discrimination.

Uses for it include traditional medicine and traditional veterinary medicine, and it is widely grown as an ornamental cactus. It has been used for healing and religious divination in the Andes Mountains region for over 3,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Bigwood, Jeremy |author2=Stafford, Peter J. |title=Psychedelics encyclopedia |publisher=Ronin Pub |location=Berkeley, CA |year=1992 |pages=118–9 |isbn=978-0-914171-51-5

==Taxonomy==
Echinopsis pachanoi is known by many names throughout [[South America]] such as ''achuma,'' ''huachuma,'' ''wachuma,'' ''aguacolla,'' ''hahuacollay,'' or ''giganton''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

==Description==
''Echinopsis pachanoi'' is native to Ecuador and Peru. Its stems are light to dark green, sometimes [[glaucous]], with a diameter of {{convert|6|-|15|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} and usually 6–8 ribs. The whitish [[areole]]s may produce up to seven yellow to brown spines, each up to {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long; the plant is sometimes spineless.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=276}} The areoles are spaced evenly along the ribs, approximately {{convert|2|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} apart.&lt;ref name="erowid"/&gt; ''Echinopsis pachanoi'' is normally {{convert|3|-|6|m|ft|abbr=on|0}} tall and has multiple branches, usually extending from the base.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=276}} The tallest recorded specimen was {{convert|12.2|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="erowid"/&gt; White flowers are produced at the end of the stems; they open at night. The flowers are large, around {{convert|19|-|24|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long with a diameter of up to {{convert|20|cm|in|abbr=on|1}}. There are black hairs along the length of the tube leading to the flower. Oblong dark green fruits are produced after fertilization, about {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} across and {{convert|5|-|6|cm|in|abbr=on|1}} long.{{sfn|Anderson|2001|p=276}}

==Traditional uses==

[[Image:Echinopsis-pachanoi-peru.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Echinopsis pachanoi'', San Pedro Cactus, the tall cactus in the mid-foreground, in its natural habitat in Peru]]

''Echinopsis pachanoi'' has a long history of being used in Andean traditional medicine. Archeological studies have found evidence of use going back two thousand years, to [[Moche (culture)|Moche]] culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bussmann RW, Sharon D |title=Traditional medicinal plant use in Northern Peru: tracking two thousand years of healing culture |journal=J Ethnobiol Ethnomed |volume=2 |issue=1 |page=47 |year=2006 |pmid=17090303 |pmc=1637095 |doi=10.1186/1746-4269-2-47 |url=http://www.ethnobiomed.com/content/2//47}}
&lt;/ref&gt; Although [[Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] church authorities{{Who|date=December 2012}} after the Spanish conquest attempted to suppress its use,{{Citation needed|date=December 2012}} this failed, as shown by the Christian element in the common name "San Pedro cactus" – [[Saint Peter]] cactus. The name is attributed{{By whom|date=December 2012}} to the belief that just as St Peter holds the keys to heaven, the effects of the cactus allow users "to reach heaven while still on earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Anderson |first=Edward F. |year=2001 |title=The Cactus Family |publication-place=Pentland, Oregon |publisher=Timber Press |isbn=978-0-88192-498-5 |ref=harv }} pp. 45–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alkaloids==
[[Image:San Pedro Stars.jpg|thumb|right|San Pedro cactus sliced to be brewed]]
The San Pedro cactus contains a number of [[alkaloids]], including the well-studied chemical [[mescaline]] (0.21–1.8%), and also [[3,4-dimethoxyphenethylamine]], [[3-Methoxytyramine]], [[4-hydroxy-3-methoxyphenethylamine]], [[4-hydroxy-3,5-dimethoxyphenethylamine]], [[anhalonidine]], [[anhalinine]], [[hordenine]], and [[tyramine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Crosby, D.M. |author2=McLaughlin, J.L.|title=Cactus Alkaloids. XIX Crystallization of Mescaline HCl and 3-Methoxytyramine HCl from Trichocereus panchanoi| journal=Lloydia and the Journal of Natural Products| date=Dec 1973 |volume=36 |issue=4 |pages=416–418 |pmid=4773270 |url=http://catbull.com/alamut/Bibliothek/1973_d.m._crosby_8158_1.pdf |accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mescaline (3,4,5-trimethoxyphenethylamine) is a [[psychedelic drug]] and [[entheogen]], which is also found in some other species of genus ''[[Echinopsis]]'' (i.e. ''[[Echinopsis lageniformis]]'', ''[[Echinopsis peruviana]]'', and ''[[Echinopsis scopulicola]]'') and the species ''[[Lophophora williamsii]]'' ([[peyote]]).{{sfn|Anderson|2001|pp=44–49}}

Anecdotal evidence suggests that the highest concentration of active substances is found in the layer of green [[photosynthetic]] tissue just beneath the skin.&lt;ref name="erowid"/&gt;

There are various mescaline extraction techniques, simple (simmering in water 5 to 7 hours) and complex (such as an [[acid-base extraction]]), the latter technique yielding a material with a significantly higher concentration of mescaline.

==Cultivation==
[[Image:Echinopsis-pachanoi-small.jpg|thumb|250px|A newly planted ''Echinopsis pachanoi'' (San Pedro Cactus) cutting]]

The San Pedro cactus grows in [[USDA]] [[hardiness zone]]s 8b to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.desert-tropicals.com/Plants/Cactaceae/Trichocereus_pachanoi.html |title=San Pedro Cactus (Echinopsis pachanoi) |publisher=desert-tropicals.com |accessdate=2008-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The San Pedro cactus is very easy to grow in most areas. Because it grows naturally in the Peruvian [[Andes Mountains]] at high altitude and with high rainfall, it can withstand temperatures far below that of many other cacti. It requires fertile, free-draining soil. They average half a meter per year of new growth.&lt;ref name="erowid"/&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=May 2017}} They are susceptible to fungal diseases if over-watered, but are not nearly as sensitive as many other cacti, especially in warm weather. They can be sunburned and display a yellowing chlorotic reaction to overexposure to sunlight.

In winter, plants will [[etiolate]], or become thin, due to lower levels of light. This may be problematic if the etiolated zone is not sufficiently strong to support future growth as the cactus may break in strong winds.


===Propagation from cuttings===
Like many other plants, ''Echinopsis pachanoi'' can be propagated from cuttings. The result is a [[Cloning#Horticultural|genetic clone]] of the parent plant.&lt;ref name="sacred"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sacredcactus.com/Cactus_TIPs_ebay.pdf |title=What if the cut end doesn't dry properly and starts to mold |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2012-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A long cactus column can be also laid on its side on the ground (like a log), and eventually roots will sprout from it and grow into the ground. After time, sprouts will form and cactus columns will grow upward out of it along its length.&lt;ref name="sacred"/&gt;

===From Seed===
Like a lot of its relatives ''Trichocereus pachanoi'' as a species is easily grown from seed, often by means of a so-called ''"Takeaway Tek"''&lt;ref&gt;https://www.arkhamsbotanical.com/cultivation/grow-cacti-seed-enhanced-takeaway-tek/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.dissidentreality.com/tutorials/how-to-grow-trichocereus-cacti-from-seed/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://herbalistics.com.au/takeaway-tek-how-to-germinate-cacti-seeds/&lt;/ref&gt;. This term refers to the practice of the sowing of ''Trichocereus'' (and sometimes other types of cactus) seed into plastic containers such as those many food takeaways are delivered in. This creates a semi-controlled humidity environment chamber for 6 months to a year, in which the seed may germinate and then grow relatively unbothered by environmental contamination. 

==Legality==
{{main|Legality of mescaline cactus by country}}

In most countries it is legal to cultivate the San Pedro cactus, but in countries where possession of mescaline and related compounds is illegal and highly penalized, cultivation for the purposes of consumption is most likely illegal and also highly penalized. This is the case in the United States, Australia, Canada, Sweden, Germany, New Zealand, and Norway, where it is currently legal to cultivate the San Pedro cactus for gardening and ornamental purposes, but not for consumption.{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}

'''''Essays and Reviews''''', edited by [[John William Parker]], published in March 1860,{{sfn|Browne|2002| p=112}} is a [[Broad church|broad-church]] volume of seven [[essays]] on [[Christianity]]. The topics covered the biblical research of the German critics, the evidence for Christianity, religious thought in England, and the cosmology of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].

''Essays and Reviews'' was a popular book title in the 19th century and there are many similar books available, but none made the same impact.

==Background==
Each essay was authored independently by one of six [[Church of England]] churchmen and one layman.{{sfn| Parker|1860}} There was no overall editorial policy and each contributor chose his own theme. The six church essayists were: [[Frederick Temple]], who later became [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]; [[Rowland Williams (theologian)|Rowland Williams]], then tutor at [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] and later Professor and Vice-Principal of [[St David's University College]], Lampeter; [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]], clergyman and Professor of Geometry at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]; [[Henry Bristow Wilson]], fellow of [[St John's College, Oxford|St John's College]], Oxford; [[Mark Pattison (academic)|Mark Pattison]], tutor at [[Lincoln College, Oxford|Lincoln College]], Oxford; and [[Benjamin Jowett]], Fellow of Balliol College, Oxford (later Master) and Regius Professor of Greek, Oxford University.  The layman was [[Charles Wycliffe Goodwin]], former fellow of [[St Catharine's College, Cambridge]], [[Egyptologist]], [[barrister]] and, later, Assistant Judge of the [[British Supreme Court for China and Japan]].

== Significance ==
The book was important because of its date and its authors. Appearing four months after [[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'',{{sfn|Browne|2002|p=112}} it summed up a three-quarter-century-long challenge to biblical history by the [[higher criticism|higher critics]] and to biblical prehistory by scientists working in the new fields of geology and biology. [[Baden Powell (mathematician)|Baden Powell]] restated his argument that God is a lawgiver, miracles break the lawful edicts issued at the creation, therefore belief in miracles is atheistic, and wrote of "Mr Darwin's masterly volume" that the ''Origin of Species'' "must soon bring about an entire revolution in opinion in favour of the grand principle of the self-evolving powers of nature."{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991| p=500}}

"Outwardly, the conflict ended inconclusively, with the acquittal of Williams and Wilson by the courts and the condemnation of
the volume by the clergy in Convocation. At a deeper level, it marked the exhaustion both of the Broad Church and of Anglican orthodoxy and the commencement of an era of religious doubt."{{sfn|Altholz|1982|pp=186, 187}}

== Seven articles ==

# ''The Education of the World'' by Frederick Temple—"a warmed-over sermon urging the free study of the Bible"&lt;ref&gt;This and the other summaries are taken from {{Harvnb|Altholz|1982|p=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# ''Bunsen's Biblical Researches'' by Rowland Williams—"denying the predictive character of Old Testament prophecies"
# ''On the Study of the Evidences of Christianity'' by Baden Powell—"flatly denied the possibility of miracles"
# ''Séances Historiques de Genève. The National Church'' by Henry Bristow Wilson—"gave the widest possible latitude to the Thirty-nine Articles and questioned the eternity of damnation"
# ''On the Mosaic Cosmogony'' by C. W. Goodwin—"a critique of the attempted 'Harmonies' between Genesis and geology"
# ''Tendencies of Religious Thought in England, 1688-1750'' by Mark Pattison—"a learned and cold study of the evidential theologians of the eighteenth century"
# ''On the Interpretation of Scripture'' by Benjamin Jowett—"in which he urged that the Bible be read 'like any other book' and made an impassioned plea for freedom of scholarship"

=== "On the interpretation of scripture" ===
[[File:Benjamin Jowett - Imagines philologorum.jpg|thumb|150px|right|Benjamin Jowett]]
The essay "On the interpretation of scripture" was contributed by Benjamin Jowett. When asked to contribute, Jowett saw the opportunity to challenge traditionalists.{{sfn|Hinchliff|Prest|2004}} He was a rationalist and insisted that the bible ought to be treated as scholars treated classical texts. Jowett was a proponent of [[Progressive revelation (Christian)|progressive revelation]]. The books of the Bible written later were seen to be closer to the ultimate [[revelation]] of God as seen in [[Jesus Christ]] as revealed in the [[Gospels]]. The epistles and other New Testament writings were seen to look back.{{sfn|Hinchliff|Prest|2004}}

The implication of Jowett's essay (and his other writings) — that revelation was ongoing and that scripture was always subject to reinterpretation as each generation encountered them — was the target of his traditionalist foes. Jowett felt he was being slandered for his honesty concerning his beliefs but he suffered no actual penalty other than an infamously low salary at [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. However, in 1863 Jowett was brought before the vice-chancellor's court for teaching contrary to the doctrines of the Church of England; the case was eventually dropped.{{sfn|Hinchliff|Prest|2004}}

== Reception ==
[[File:Frederic Harrison.jpg|thumbnail|150px|left|Frederic Harrison]]

Hardly known outside academic theological circles today, ''Essays'' sold 22,000 copies in two years, more than ''Origin'' sold in its first twenty years. It sparked five years of increasingly polarized debate with books and pamphlets furiously contesting the issues.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=500}}

A review by [[Frederic Harrison]] published in the [[Westminster Review]] in October 1860{{sfn|Harrison|1860}} had the probably undesired effect of stimulating the attack on the book.{{sfn|Ellis|1980|pp=106–108}} Harrison saw the essays as neither religious nor rational which was a double blow to the seven who saw the essays as promoting rational religion.

In January 1861, an anonymous review was published in the [[Quarterly Review]].{{sfn|Wilberforce |1861}} The author was later revealed as [[Samuel Wilberforce]], the [[Bishop of Oxford]]. The ''Quarterly'' review was followed up by a letter to [[The Times]] co-signed by the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] and 25 [[bishop]]s which threatened the theologians with the ecclesiastical courts. Darwin quoted a proverb: "A bench of bishops is the devil's flower garden", and joined others including the eminent geologist [[Charles Lyell]], and the mathematician and Queen's printer [[William Spottiswoode]],  in signing a counter-letter supporting ''Essays and Reviews'' for trying to "establish religious teachings on a firmer and broader foundation".{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991| p=501}}

On the subject [[Lewis Carroll]] wrote, "Let E = Essays, and R = Reviews: then the locus of (E + R), referred to multilinear coordinates, will be found to be a superficies (i.e., a locus possessing length and breadth, but no depth)."{{cn|date=May 2018}}

== Repercussions ==
[[File:WilberforceVanityFair.jpg|thumbnail|150px|right|Samuel Wilberforce]]
Despite this alignment of pro-evolution scientists and [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]] with liberal churchmen, Williams and Wilson were charged with heresy in the [[Court of Arches]]. They were found guilty on some of the counts by the [[Dean of Arches]], [[Stephen Lushington (judge)|Stephen Lushington]], but appealed to the [[Judicial Committee of the Privy Council]]. The Judicial Committee comprised secular judges sitting with the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Archbishop of York]] and the [[Bishop of London]]. In 1864 it overturned the convictions, with the Archbishops of Canterbury and York dissenting in part (though the Bishop of London concurred in the decision). It was said that the Privy Council had "dismissed hell with costs". One hundred and thirty-seven thousand laity signed a letter of thanks to the Archbishops of Canterbury and York for voting against the Committee, and a declaration in favour of biblical inspiration and eternal torments was drawn up at [[Oxford]] and circulated to the 24,800 clergy, being signed by eleven thousand of them. Wilberforce went to the Convocation of [[Canterbury]] and in June obtained "synodical condemnation" of ''Essays and Reviews''.{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991| pp=523–524}}

Today the essay topics and conclusions may seem innocuous, but at the time, the essays were described by their opponents as [[heresy|heretical]], and the essayists were called "The Seven Against Christ."....{{sfn|Desmond|Moore|1991| pp=500–501}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12803">{{Priesthoods of ancient Rome}}
In [[Religion in ancient Rome|ancient Roman religion]], the '''Flamen Dialis''' was the [[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#sacerdos|high priest]] of [[Jupiter (god)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="DillonGarland2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Matthew Dillon|author2=Lynda Garland|title=Ancient Rome: A Sourcebook|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ce3WAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA127|date=28 October 2013|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-1-136-76143-0|pages=127–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term ''Dialis'' derives from ''Diespiter'', the [[Italic languages|Italic]] equivalent to ''Jupiter''.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Dĭālis'', in: Charlton T. Lewis, Charles Short, ''[[A Latin Dictionary]].'' Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1879 ([http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0059:entry=Dialis online]).&lt;/ref&gt; There were 15 ''[[flamen|flamines]]'', of which three were ''flamines maiores'', serving the three gods of the [[Capitoline Triad#Archaic Triad|Archaic Triad]]. According to tradition the ''flamines'' were forbidden to touch metal, ride a horse, or see a corpse.

The office of Flamen Dialis, and the offices of the other ''flamines maiores'', were traditionally said to have been created by [[Numa Pompilius]], second [[king of Rome]], although Numa himself performed many of the rites of the Flamen Dialis.&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]], ''[[Ab Urbe Condita Libri (Livy)|Ab urbe condita]]'', 1:20&lt;/ref&gt;

==Privileges and honors==
The Flamen Dialis enjoyed many peculiar honours. When a vacancy occurred, three persons of [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patrician]] descent, whose parents had been married according to the ceremonies of [[confarreatio]] (the strictest form of Roman marriage), were nominated by the [[Comitia]], one of whom was selected (''captus''), and consecrated (''inaugurabatur'') by the [[Pontifex Maximus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Tacitus]] Ann. iv.16; Liv. xxvii.8&lt;/ref&gt; From that time forward he was emancipated from the control of his father, and became ''sui juris''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], i.130; [[Ulpian]], Frag. x.5; Tac. Ann. iv.16&lt;/ref&gt; He alone of all priests wore the [[Apex (headdress)|apex]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Marcus Terentius Varro|Varro]], ap. Gell. x.15&lt;/ref&gt; he had a right to a [[lictor]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]] Q. R. p119, ed. [[Reiske]]&lt;/ref&gt; to the ''[[Toga#Varieties|toga praetexta]]'', the ''[[Sella Curulis]]'', and to a seat in the [[Roman senate]] ''[[ex officio]]''. This last privilege, after having been suffered to fall into disuse for a long period, was asserted by [[C. Valerius Flaccus]] (209 BC), the claim allowed however, says [[Livy]], more in deference to his high personal character than from a conviction of the justice of the demand.&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xxvii.8; cf. i.20&lt;/ref&gt; The Rex Sacrificulus or [[Rex Sacrorum]] alone was entitled to recline above him at a banquet; if one in bonds took refuge in his house, the chains were immediately struck off and conveyed through the ''impluvium'' to the roof, and thence cast down into the street:&lt;ref name="Aul. Gell. x.15"&gt;Aul. Gell. x.15&lt;/ref&gt; if a criminal on his way to punishment met him, and fell suppliant at his feet, he was respited for that day,&lt;ref&gt;Aul. Gell. x.15; Plut. Q. R. p166&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the right of sanctuary attached to the persons and dwellings of the papal [[cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinals]].

==Restrictions==
To counterbalance these high honours, the Dialis was subjected to many restrictions and privations, a long catalogue of which was compiled by [[Aulus Gellius]]&lt;ref&gt;x.15&lt;/ref&gt; from the works of [[Fabius Pictor]] and [[Masurius Sabinus]], while [[Plutarch]], in his ''Roman Questions'', endeavours to explain their import. Among these were the following:

* It was unlawful for him to be out of the city for a single night;&lt;ref&gt;Liv. v.52&lt;/ref&gt; a regulation which seems to have been modified by [[Gaius Julius Caesar Octavianus|Augustus]], insofar that an absence of two nights was permitted.&lt;ref&gt;Tacit. Ann. iii.58, 71&lt;/ref&gt;
* He was forbidden to sleep out of his own bed for three nights consecutively. Thus, it was impossible for him to undertake the government of a province.
* He might not
** mount or even touch a horse,
** touch iron, or
** look at an army marshalled outside the [[pomerium]].
* He might not be elected to the consulship. Indeed, it would seem that originally he was altogether precluded from seeking or accepting any civil magistracy;&lt;ref&gt;Plut. Q. R. p.169&lt;/ref&gt; but this last prohibition was certainly not enforced in later times.
* The Flamen Dialis was required to wear certain unusual garments, such as the ''apex'', a point-tipped hat, and a ''laena'', a heavy wool cloak.

The object of these rules was clearly to make him literally ''Jovi adsiduum sacerdotem'' (the constant priest of Jove (Jupiter)), to compel constant attention to the duties of the priesthood, and to leave him effectively without any temptation to neglect them.&lt;ref name="BeardNorth1998"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Mary Beard |author2=John North |author3=S. R. F. Price |title=Religions of Rome: Volume 2, A Sourcebook |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQd82l39KX4C&amp;pg=PA196 |date=28 June 1998 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-45646-3 |page=196}}&lt;/ref&gt; The origins of the following superstitions are not so clear, but there is speculation in Plutarch,&lt;ref&gt;Q. R. pp.114, 118, 164–170&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]],&lt;ref&gt;s.v. Edera and Equo&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Pliny the Elder]].&lt;ref&gt;H.N. xviii.30, H.N. xxviii.40&lt;/ref&gt;

* He was not allowed to swear an oath,&lt;ref&gt;Liv. xxxi.50&lt;/ref&gt;
* nor to wear a ring ''nisi pervio et casso'' ("unless plain and without stones");&lt;ref&gt;Kirchmann, De Annulis, p14&lt;/ref&gt;
* nor to strip himself naked in the open air
* nor to go out without his proper head-dress
* nor to have a knot in any part of his attire
* nor to walk along a path over-canopied by vines.
* He might not touch flour, nor [[leaven]], nor [[leavened bread]],
* He might not touch a dead body, nor enter a burial place, but he was allowed to attend a funeral.
* He was forbidden either to touch or to name a dog, a she-goat, [[ivy]], beans, or raw flesh.
* None but a free man might cut his hair; the clippings of which, together with the parings of his nails, were buried beneath a ''felix arbor''.
* No one might sleep in his bed, the legs of which were smeared with fine clay
* It was unlawful to place a box containing sacrificial cakes in contact with the bedstead.

In the view of [[Dumézil]], these prohibitions mark the Flamen Dialis as serving a heavenly god, with his attributes of absolute purity and freedom, but also wielder of lightning and  kingship. Within his scope of action there are the domains of  political power and right, but not battle, which  belongs to Mars. His solidarity with the king is reflected in that of his earthly counterpart, the ''rex'', with the ''Flamen Dialis''. Such a partnership has parallels in other Indo-European cultures, such as that of the Vedic ''[[raja]]n'' and his ''[[purohita]]'' and the ancient Irish ''rig'' and the chief druid.&lt;ref&gt;G. Dumézil above It. tr. Milan 1977 p. 146-148 and 31-32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flaminica Dialis==
The '''''Flaminica Dialis''''' was the wife of the ''Flamen Dialis''. She was required to be a virgin at the time of their wedding, which had to be conducted according to the ceremonies of ''[[confarreatio]]'', the traditional form of marriage for [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]]. (This regulation also applied to the marriages of the two other ''[[Flamen|flamines maiores]]''.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Servius]], note to ''[[Aeneid]]'' iv.104, 374; [[Gaius (jurist)|Gaius]], i.112&lt;/ref&gt; The couple were not permitted to divorce, and if the ''flaminica'' died the ''Dialis'' was obliged to resign.&lt;ref name="SebestaBonfante2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Judith Lynn Sebesta|author2=Larissa Bonfante|title=The World of Roman Costume|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GxGPLju4KEkC&amp;pg=PA56|year=2001|publisher=Univ of Wisconsin Press|isbn=978-0-299-13854-7|pages=56–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The assistance of the ''flaminica'' was essential in the performance of certain rituals. On each of the ''[[Roman calendar#Nundinal cycle|nundinae]]'', she sacrificed a ram to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]] in the [[Regia]].&lt;ref name="Macrobius i.16"&gt;[[Macrobius]] i.16&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''flaminica'' was assigned a special ritual attire. Her hair was plaited up with a purple band in a conical form (''tutulus''), but when she went to participate in the ritual of the [[Argei]], she neither combed nor arranged her hair.&lt;ref name="Macrobius i.16"/&gt;  The ''flaminica'' and the ''[[regina sacrorum]]'' were the only ones who might wear the hairdressing named ''(in)arculata''.{{clarify|date=November 2011}}&lt;ref&gt;Servius ''Ad Aeneidem'' IV 137;  Paulus p. 237 L 2nd.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''flaminica'' wore a dyed robe (''venenato operitur'') and a small square cloth with a border (''rica''), to which was attached a slip cut from a ''[[Glossary of ancient Roman religion#arbor felix|felix arbor]]'', a tree under the protection of the heavenly gods.&lt;ref&gt;[[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], s.v. ''tutulum'' and ''rica''; [[Varro]], ''De lingua latina'' vii.44.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''rica'' may have been a short cloak, or less likely a sort of scarf or veil thrown over the head.

The restrictions imposed upon the ''flaminica'' were similar to those placed on her husband.&lt;ref name="JamesDillon2015"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Sharon L.

==Holders of the office==
The flamen [[Lucius Cornelius Merula (consul 87 BC)|Lucius Cornelius Merula]] was chosen ''[[consul|consul suffectus]]'' on the expulsion of [[Lucius Cornelius Cinna]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Velleius Paterculus]] ii.20; [[Valerius Maximus]] ix.12 §5&lt;/ref&gt; and, upon the restoration of the Marian faction, shed his own blood in the sanctuary (87 BC), calling down curses on his enemies with his dying breath.&lt;ref&gt;[http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Velleius_Paterculus/2A*.html#20 (Vell. Pat. ii.22)]&lt;/ref&gt; After his death the priesthood remained vacant until the consecration of [[Servius Cornelius Lentulus Maluginensis]] under Augustus, then Pontifex Maximus.

The exact date that Maluginensis became Flamen Dialis is disputed.  [[Cassius Dio|Dio]] 54.36 says it was about 11 BC, a date accepted by many modern scholars.  But [[Tacitus]] ''[[Tacitus Annals|Annales]]'' 3.58 indicates that the date was 72 years after the suicide of Cornelius Merula (87 BC).  Some modern translators (including Penguin's Rex Warner, but not Wood) change Tacitus to match Dio instead of vice versa, even though Tacitus is the more reliable historian.  Gaius Stern asserts that Tacitus is probably correct, meaning that Maluginensis became Flamen Dialis while Lepidus was Pontifex Maximus (16/15 BC), so that Lepidus had to supervise his inauguration at Augustus' direction, possibly unwillingly.

[[Julius Caesar]] was nominated to be Flamen Dialis in 84 BC.  Many scholars think he was not installed, although it seems unlikely that the Romans would allow a nominee to wait years without inauguration. When [[Sulla]] returned to Italy in 82, he proscribed Caesar and stripped him of his priesthood (which implies that he had indeed been inaugurated).  No successor was selected.  During the vacancy that followed (c. 82 to c. 16 or later), the duties of the office were discharged by others.&lt;ref&gt;Suet. Jul. c1, compared with Vell. Pat. ii.43, and the Commentators. See also [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Augustus*.html#31.4 Suet.

The last quoted historian, if the text is correct, states the interruption lasted for 72 years only.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''German Faith Movement''' (''Deutsche Glaubensbewegung'') was a religious movement in [[Nazi Germany]] (1933&amp;ndash;1945), closely associated with [[University of Tübingen]] professor [[Jakob Wilhelm Hauer]]. The movement sought to move Germany away from [[Christianity]] towards a religion based on [[Germanic paganism]] and [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideas.&lt;ref name="Bonney2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard Bonney|title=Confronting the Nazi War on Christianity: The Kulturkampf Newsletters, 1936-1939|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KuiPXOje7EkC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=13 March 2013|date=15 June 2009|publisher=Peter Lang|isbn=978-3-03911-904-2|pages=62, 73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{refimprove section|date=January 2018}}
The movement's ceremonies involved sermons, [[Music of Germany#Classical music|German classical music]] and political hymns.

In his 1936 essay "[[Odin|Wotan]]" Swiss psychologist [[Carl Jung]] speaks of ''Ergriffenheit'', explained in the English version as "a state of being seized or possessed",&lt;ref&gt;Jung, Carl G. (1970); Collected Works, Volume 10; Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, London; {{ISBN|0-7100-1640-9}}; p 184.&lt;/ref&gt; and characterizes Germany as "infected... rolling towards perdition".&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Jung sees the German Faith Movement as "decent and well-meaning people who honestly admit their ''Ergriffenheit'' and try to come to terms with this new and undeniable fact." He commends Hauer's book ''Deutsche Gottschau'' as an attempt "to build a bridge between the dark forces of life and the shining world of historical ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Jung, p 190 - 191.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement had around 200,000 followers at its height (less than 0.3% of the population). Following the Nazi accession to power, it obtained rights of civil tolerance from [[Rudolf Hess]], but never the preferential treatment from the Nazi state for which Hauer campaigned.

The development of the German Faith Movement revolved around five main themes:{{cn|date=June 2018}}
* the propagation of the '[[blood and soil]]' ideology
* the replacement of Christian ceremonies by pagan equivalents; the most favored pagan deity being the sun, as can be seen from the flag of the faith movement
* the rejection of Christian ethics
* the cult of Hitler's personality.
* the spread of [[Nordic paganism|Norse paganism]] throughout Germany.

Similar movements have remained active in Germany since 1945 outside mainstream educational and social structures.

The Happy Science group includes a publication division called IRH Press, educational establishments such as Happy Science Academy and Happy Science University, a political party called The Happiness Realization Party, and three media entertainment divisions, which are called New Star Production, ARI Production and HS Pictures Studio.

==History==
Happy Science was founded on 6 October 1986  and was certified in Japan as a religious organization on March 7, 1991. According to Ryuho Okawa, its aim is "to bring happiness to humanity by spreading the Truth". Before its foundation, Ryuho Okawa published various books of "spiritual messages" that claim to channel the words spoken by religious and historical figures such as [[Jesus Christ]], [[Confucius]] and [[Nichiren]]. In 1987, ''The Laws of the Sun'', ''The Golden Laws'', and ''The Laws of Eternity'' were published, forming the core textbooks of Happy Science, along with the fundamental sutra ''The Dharma of the Right Mind''. In 1986, he resigned from a position at a trading corporation to found his own religion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Shimazono|first=Susumu|title=From Salvation to Spirituality: Popular Religious Movements in Modern Japan|date=2004|publisher=Trans Pacific|location=Melbourne, Vic.|isbn=1876843128|page=267|edition=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings==
[[File:Tokyo shoshinkan3.jpg|thumb|Tokyo Shoshinkan in Sengakuji]]
The basic teachings of Happy Science are "Exploration of the Right Mind" and "The Fourfold Path" and El Cantare belief. According to Okawa, in order to obtain happiness one must practice the Principles of Happiness known as "The Fourfold Path", Love that gives, Wisdom, Self-Reflection and Progress. The only requirement to join Happy Science is that applicants must have "the aspiration and discipline to seek the truth and actively contribute to the realization of love, peace and happiness on earth".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Happy Science - About Us|url = http://www.happyscience.com.sg/index.cfm?GPID=3|website = Happy Science Singapore|accessdate = 2015-12-13|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160304111248/http://www.happyscience.com.sg/index.cfm?GPID=3|archivedate = 4 March 2016|df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among other teachings, they believe in reincarnation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Eternal Life and Reincarnation |url=https://happyscience-na.org/about/teachings/happy-science-and-buddhism/eternal-life-and-reincarnation/ |website=Happy Science}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aliens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Alien Invasion: Can We Defend Earth? |url=http://info.happy-science.org/2015/203/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, the organization's political wing, the [[Happiness Realization Party]], promotes political views that include support for Japanese military expansion, support for the use of nuclear deterrence &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.hr-party.jp/blog/381.html |title=The Happiness Realization Party|publisher=En.hr-party.jp|date=2012-09-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;, and denial of historical events such as the [[Nanjing Massacre]] in [[China]] and the [[comfort women]] issue in [[South Korea]]—see the Japanese-language version of the organization's online news bulletin, ''The Liberty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Liberty Web|url = http://eng.the-liberty.com/|accessdate = 2015-12-13|language = ja}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some other views include infrastructure spending, natural disaster prevention, urban development, and dam construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.hr-party.jp/proposal|title=Happiness Realization Party|website=Happiness Realization Party|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also advocate fiscal conservatism, strengthening the US-Japan alliance, and a virtue-based leadership.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.hr-party.jp/position|title=Happiness Realization Party|website=Happiness Realization Party|access-date=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of the spring  of 2018, the [[Happiness Realization Party]] has 21 local councilors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=About Japanese 50 new region|date=2017-04-19|publisher=Takarajima|isbn=978-4800270443|edition=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Happy Science worships a deity named "El Cantare" who they believe is the "Highest God of Earth, the Lord of all gods" which is synonymous with Allah, the Father of Jesus, and was first born on Earth as Alpha 330 million years ago where Africa would be today, Elohim, Odin, [[Thoth]], Ophealis([[Osiris]]) [[Hermes]] and then [[Shakyamuni Buddha]], and is said to be the core consciousness of Okawa himself. The movement accepts both [[monotheism]] and [[polytheism]]. They explain that there is a hierarchy in the heavenly spirit world and [[Henotheism|believing in the existence of many gods]], [[Tathagata]]s, [[Bodhisattva]]s, and other high spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=ben griggs|title=The end of monotheism and religious conflicts.|date=2012-09-12|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lk8JnN9wOHQ|accessdate=2016-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==

General headquarters, worship facilities, and missionary sites are located in Japan and other countries. Worship facilities are called ''Shoja'' (精舎 or ''[[vihara]]'' in [[Sanskrit]]) or ''Shoshinkan'' (正心館). On January 1, 1994, as the first overseas branch, "Happiness Science USA" was established in New York.&lt;ref&gt;『「幸福の科学」教団史2008 法輪、転ずべし』p57&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;「月刊 幸福の科学」1994年2月号p50&lt;/ref&gt; The organization has branches in several countries including South Korea, Brazil, Uganda, the UK, Australia and India.&lt;ref name="FindUs"&gt;[http://findus.happy-science.org/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==

Happy Science is one of many [[Japanese new religions]] (''shinshūkyō''), which are looked upon as "controversial" by the mainstream press and public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/contentious-religion-from-japan-succeeds-in-uganda_n_1661559.html|work = [[The Huffington Post]]|title = Happy Science, Controversial Religion From Japan, Succeeds In Uganda|last = Muhumuza|first = Rodney|date = 10 July 2012|agency = Associated Press |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712112146/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/07/10/contentious-religion-from-japan-succeeds-in-uganda_n_1661559.html |archivedate=12 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to ''[[The Japan Times]]'', "for many, the Happies smell suspiciously like a cult".&lt;ref name="jt20090804"&gt;{{Citation | last = McNeill| first = David| title = Party offers a third way: happiness | newspaper = [[The Japan Times]]| date = 4 August 2009| url = https://www.japantimes.co.jp/community/2009/08/04/community/party-offers-a-third-way-happiness/| accessdate = 6 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only the domestic Japanese press, but also international media in the United States, Uganda, Indonesia, and Australia have applied the term "[[cult]]" to Happy Science.&lt;ref&gt;Sylla Saint-Guily, "[https://www.vice.com/read/my-afternoon-with-a-failed-japanese-cult Happy Science Is the Laziest Cult Ever]," ''[[Vice (magazine)]]'', 3 October 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Musasizi /&gt;&lt;ref name=thejakartapost /&gt;&lt;ref name=Donnelly /&gt;

Happy Science has released promotional videos that claim [[North Korea]] and the [[People's Republic of China]] are plotting to invade and colonize Japan after first subduing it through nuclear warfare.&lt;ref name="jt20090804" /&gt;

In February 2017, actress [[Fumika Shimizu]] abruptly retired from her former entertainment production agency while in the middle of multiple filming projects in order to pursue a full-time role in Happy Science, declaring she had been a member of the group since childhood under the influence of her parents, both of whom have been devout believers in Happy Science for a long time.&lt;ref name="fumika"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Fumika Shimizu to retire from entertainment to devote herself to cult|url = http://aramajapan.com/news/fumika-shimizu-to-retire-from-entertainment-to-devote-herself-to-cult/70942/|website = Arama!

The first [[Jews]] known to have reached the island of [[Hispaniola]] were [[Spanish Jews|Spanish]].

When the island was divided by the French and the Spanish, most Jews settled on the Spanish side which would later become the [[Dominican Republic]]. Eventually, [[Sephardim]] from other countries also arrived. In the 19th century Jews from [[Curaçao]] settled in Hispaniola, although they did not form a strong community. Most of them hid their Jewish identities or were unaffiliated with Jewish tradition by that time. Among their descendants were Dominican President [[Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.27febrero.com/biografias.htm#FRANCISCO%20HENRIQUEZ%20Y%20CARVAJAL] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113182604/http://www.27febrero.com/biografias.htm#ULISES%20FRANCISCO%20ESPAILLAT |date=2008-01-13 }} Biography of Francisco Henríquez y Carvajal (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Genealog&gt;{{cite journal |title=Familias capitaleñas: Los Henríquez |journal=Cápsulas Genealógicas |date=23 August 2010 |issue=1/3 |url=http://hoy.com.do/capsulas-genealogicasfamilias-capitalenas-los-henriquez/ |access-date=3 February 2014 |last=Read|first=Jaime |publisher=Hoy |location=Santo Domingo |language=Spanish |quote=Este apellido se origina en la península Ibérica, tanto en Portugal como en España, de familias judías sefardíes que marcharon posteriormente hacia el norte, llegando a Holanda, a raíz de la expulsión de judíos luego de la Reconquista.

The Dominican Republic was one of the very few countries willing to accept mass Jewish immigration during [[World War II]]. At the [[Évian Conference]], it offered to accept up to 100,000 Jewish refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/article.php?lang=en&amp;ModuleId=10005468|title=German Jewish Refugees, 1933–1939|website=www.ushmm.org|accessdate=1 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is estimated that 5,000 visas were actually issued, and the vast majority of the recipients did not reach the country because of how hard it was to get out of occupied Europe.&lt;ref name="bh.org.il"&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jews of the Dominican Republic |url=https://dbs.bh.org.il/place/dominican-republic |publisher=The Museum of the Jewish People at Beit Hatfutsot}}&lt;/ref&gt; The DORSA (Dominican Republic Settlement Association) was formed with the assistance of the JDC, and helped settle Jews in [[Sosúa]], on the northern coast. About 700 European Jews of [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish descent reached the settlement where each family received {{Convert|33|ha}} of land, 10 cows (plus 2 additional cows per child), a mule and a horse, and a [[US$]]10,000 loan (about {{Inflation|US|10000|1941|r=-3|fmt=c}} dollars at {{currentyear}} prices) at 1% interest.&lt;ref name=MuKienAdrianaSang&gt;{{cite web|last=Sang|first=Mu-Kien Adriana|title=Judíos en el Caribe.

In 1943 the number of known Jews in the Dominican Republic peaked at 1000. Sosúa’s Jewish community experienced a deep decline in the 1980s due to emigration during the touristic boom of Sosúa when most Jews sold their land to developers at exorbitant prices. The oldest Jewish grave is dated to 1826.

== Community ==

The current population of known Jews in the Dominican Republic is close to 3,000,&lt;ref&gt;[[History of the Jews in Latin America and the Caribbean#Current Jewish populations in the Americas and the Caribbean]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the majority living in the capital, [[Santo Domingo]], and others residing in [[Sosúa]]. Since Jews mixed with those already living in the Dominican Republic, the exact number of Dominicans with Jewish ancestry isn't known. In spite of the Jews intermarriage with the Dominican people already living there, some spouses have formalized their Judaism through conversions and participate in Jewish communal life while other Sephardic Jews converted to Catholicism, still maintaining their Sephardic culture. Some Dominican Jews have also made [[aliyah]] to [[Israel]]. There are three synagogues and one Sephardic Jewish Educational Center. One is the [[Centro Israelita de República Dominicana]] in Santo Domingo, another is a [[Chabad]] outreach center also in Santo Domingo, and another is in the country's first established community in Sosúa.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coxwashington.com/hp/content/reporters/stories/2007/11/11/BC_CARIB_JEWS_ADV11_COX.html] COX Newspapers article on the Jewish Community of Sosua, Dominican Republic.&lt;/ref&gt; Beth Midrash Eleazar [http://www.bmeleazar.org], the Sephardic Educational Center, caters to those Jews who are descendents of the Sephardic Jews that migrated to Hispaniola in colonial times and later. In addition, they also provide kosher meat in the Beth Yoseph style, and supervise a small-scale kosher bakery. An "afterschool" at the Centro Israelita is active on a weekly basis and a chapter of the International Council of Jewish Women is also active. The Chabad outreach center [http://www.chabadominican.com/] focuses on assisting the local Jewish population reconnect with their Jewish roots and (because Chabad is of the [[Chassidic]] Jewish tradition) it is a source for traditional Judaism in the Dominican Republic. In Sosua, there is a small Jewish Museum next to the synagogue. On the High Holidays, the Sosua community hires a [[Hazzan|cantor]] from abroad who comes to lead services.

== Research ==
A great deal of research on the subject of Dominican Jewry was done by Rabbi Henry Zvi Ucko&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unc.edu/mss/inv/u/Ucko,Henry_Zvi.html Information about the Henry Zvi Ucko papers located at The University of North Carolina]&lt;/ref&gt; who had been a writer and teacher in [[Germany]] until political conditions and growing anti-Semitism forced him to emigrate{{when|date=November 2014}}. His travels eventually took him to the Dominican Republic, where he organized a congregation in Santo Domingo (Ciudad Trujillo) and began researching the history of Jews in the country. His research covered much of the history of the [[Sephardic Jews]] there and documented the assimilation that the population went through (and was going through) during his time. Included in his research is correspondence with Haim Horacio López Penha, a Dominican Jewish writer, who encouraged Ucko to write a history of the Jews in the Dominican Republic. President Rafael L. Trujillo Molina, pledged the interest and cooperation of the government in support of Ucko's research. More recently, the publication of the book "Once Jews" has made easily available information on many early Jewish settlers in the Dominican Republic.

'''''Is Religion Dangerous?''''' is a book by [[Keith Ward]] examining the questions: "Is religion dangerous? Does it do more harm than good? Is it a force for evil?" It was first published in 2006. Looking at the evidence from history, philosophy, sociology and psychology, Ward focuses on the main question at issue: does religion do more harm than good? He begins by examining the key area of [[religious violence|religion and violence]] and goes on to assess the allegations of irrationality and immorality, before exploring the good religion has done over the centuries. He suggests that without religion the human race would be considerably worse off and there would be little hope for the future.

==Summary==
In the '''Introduction: What is religion?''', Ward begins, "Is religion dangerous? Does it do more harm than good? Is it a force for evil, even 'the root of all evil'?"—the title of a [[The Root of All Evil?|short British television series]] presented by [[Richard Dawkins]]. Ward states his view that the assertion that religion does more harm than good ignores "the available evidence from history, from psychology and sociology, and from philosophy" and suggests that proponents of this view "refuse to investigate the question in a properly rigorous way, and substitute rhetoric for analysis".{{sfn|Ward|p=7}}  He suggests that it is impossible to give a satisfactory universal definition of religion, and that early opponents of religion such as [[Edward Taylor]], [[James Frazer]] and [[Émile Durkheim]] were indulging in "scholarly fantazising" about forms of primitive religion which were refuted by more rigorous studies such as ''Theories of Primitive Religion'' by [[E. E. Evans-Pritchard|Evans-Pritchard]]. "Unfortunately some writers have not yet realised this", such as [[Daniel Dennett]] in ''Breaking the Spell'', who "does not seem to realise that the spell was broken as long ago as 1884 when [[Edward Burnett Tylor|E. B. Tylor]] was appointed to a Readership in Anthropology at [[Oxford University]]."{{sfn|Ward|pp=10-11}}

In Chapters 1 through 3, which deal with the origins and nature of violence, Ward suggests that "It is not religion that causes intolerance. It is intolerance that uses religion", that "The leaders of such movements [are] using moral and religious language as a cloak for evil and irreligious ends",{{sfn|Ward|p=38}} and that "religions are not the causes of evil, but they do naturally share in the general moral state of the societies in which they exist".{{sfn|Ward|p=41}} Ward suggests that any organised human activity can be corrupted, and that the corruptions of religion, although highly regrettable, are less harmful that the corruptions of secular ideologies ([[Nazism]], [[Leninism]] and [[Maoism]] all claimed the support of science). In addition the great religions have within themselves a powerful critique of corruption.{{citation needed|reason=The summary does not contain a citation|date=April 2015}} Ward, alluding to [[Islamic terrorism]], alleges that "it is not religion that causes Islamic terrorism. It is a version of Islam that has been corrupted by ...[[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist-Leninism]]"{{sfn|Ward|p=59}} and that [[al-Qaeda]] is based on a demonstrably incorrect interpretation of [[Islam]]. He further suggests that wars fought in the name of some interpretations of Christianity have also been based on distortions.{{citation needed|reason=The claim is very specific|date=April 2015}}

Ward examines the interplay of [[reason]], [[morality]], and [[philosophy]] in Chapters 4 through 8. He claims that the statement "the only reasonable beliefs are those that can be confirmed by the methods of science, by public observation, measurement and experiment" is [[Self-refuting idea|self-refuting]].{{sfn|Ward|p=86}}  He contrasts four [[worldview]]s—Common Sense, Materialism, Idealism and Christian Theism—and suggests that there are serious problems with Common Sense (science shows that things are often not in fact as they seem at all) and Materialism ("quantum physics seems to dissolve matter entirely", and "consciousness and the contents of consciousness resist translation into purely physical terms... and if ... truth, beauty and goodness ... are things that really exist ... then Materialism will not match our experience at all"{{sfn|Ward|pp=88-89}}). He suggests that "many attacks on religion are based on the belief that idealism is false. There is no spiritual dimension to reality... to make matters worse, thinkers like [[Richard Dawkins]] hold that...religious views are based on 'blind faith'". But, he asks, "Has Dawkins never read any philosophy?... Does he really think that [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]], [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]] were all unthinking simpletons?"{{sfn|Ward|p=90}}  "Looking around my philosopher colleagues in Britain, virtually all of whom I know at least from their published work, I would say that very few of them are materialists... the point is that religious views are underpinned by highly sophisticated philosophical arguments".{{sfn|Ward|p=91}} He discusses the defensibility of worldviews and suggests some criteria that make a [[worldview]] reasonable:{{citation needed|reason=Broad outline needs references|date=April 2015}}

# Clarity and precision in stating the beliefs, ideally arranged in order of logical dependence so that one can tell which are the truly basic beliefs
# Comparison with other worldviews
# Testing the adequacy of the worldview to the widest range of data, whether they are experiences or other beliefs

Ward asserts that it is rational, and not harmful, to believe in life after death. He advises that "even for the most conservative Christian, moral rules found in the Bible should not be taken out of context"{{sfn|Ward|p=114}} and that "far from being considered dangerous, religious morality is widely considered to be a valuable resource for moral thinking in the modern world".{{sfn|Ward|p=127}} He explains how his own journey from [[atheism]], when he was a philosopher teaching at [[Glasgow University]], was strongly influenced by the need to have a philosophically coherent justification for morality. Ward avers that the history of Europe from the 16th to the 20th Centuries was not one of "beneficial liberation from fear and superstition" but "an age of increasingly aggressive [[nationalism]] culminating in two [[world war]]s ... [[barbarian|barbarism]] did not decrease. In the twentieth century it reached heights never previously imagined"{{sfn|Ward|pp=141-142}} and that religiously inspired individuals took a leading role in many beneficial developments.{{sfn|Ward|pp=141-142. He cites [[William Wilberforce]], [[Frederick Nolde]], [[Earl of Shaftesbury|Lord Shaftesbury]], [[Bishop]] [[George Bell (bishop)|George Bell]], [[Trevor Huddleston]] and [[Martin Luther King Jr.|Martin Luther King]]}} He suggests that "it was religion, and not secular thought, that propounded the view that nature is founded on a deep rationality",{{sfn|Ward|p=142, citing [[Anselm of Canterbury|St Anselm]], [[Thomas Aquinas|Aquinas]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and [[Isaac Newton]]}} and defends liberalism and pluralism in religious thought, which he attributes to the rise of [[Protestantism]] and contrasts with what he considers the illiberal attitudes of [[Richard Dawkins]]{{sfn|Ward|pp=148-150. Ward states that "the only proper response to [views such as six-day creation] is to present the evidence and engage in open debate. Dawkins chooses to ridicule them instead"}} and [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinkers like [[David Hume]], who sought to make reason the slave of passions.{{sfn|Ward|pp=143-152, referring to Hume's view that "Reason is, and ought only to be, the slave of the passions, and can never pretend to any other office than to serve and obey them" [''A Treatise of Human Nature'' II.iii.3/415]}}

In Chapters 9 and 10, Ward attempts to demonstrate the benefits of religion. Ward quotes data from [[David Myers (academic)|David Myers]] citing surveys by [[The Gallup Organization|Gallup]], the National Opinion Research Centre, and the Pew Organisation which conclude that spiritually committed people are twice as likely to report being "very happy" than the least religiously committed people.{{sfn|Ward|p=156. The Myers book is cited as ''The Science of Subjective Well-Being'' (Guilford Press 2007)}} He reports an analysis of over 200 social studies that "high religiousness predicts a rather lower risk of depression and drug abuse and fewer suicide attempts, and more reports of satisfaction with life and a sense of well-being",{{sfn|Ward|p=156 Smith, Timothy, Michael McCullough, and Justin Poll. 2003: “Religiousness and Depression: Evidence for a Main Effect and Moderating Influence of Stressful Life Events.” Psychological Bulletin 129(4):614–36}} and a review of 498 studies published in peer-reviewed journals that "concluded that a large majority of these studies showed a positive correlation between religious commitment and higher levels of perceived well-being and self-esteem, and lower levels of hypertension, depression and clinical delinquency,{{sfn|Ward|p=157 Bryan Johnson &amp; colleagues at the University of Pennsylvania (2002)}} and similar results from the ''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health''.{{sfn|Ward|p=157 ''Handbook of Religion and Mental Health'' [[Harold Koenig]] (ed.) ISBN 978-0-12-417645-4}} He cites surveys suggesting a strong link between faith and altruism.{{sfn|Ward|pp=159-162 e.g. [http://www.ropercenter.uconn.edu/data_access/data/datasets/social_capital_community_survey.html a survey] by [[Robert Putnam]] showing that membership of religious groups was positively correlated with membership of voluntary organisations}} He cites extensive studies to show that there is little or no evidence that religion ever causes mental disorders,{{sfn|Ward|p=168 quoting [[Michael Argyle (psychologist)|Michael Argyle]] and others}} and that overall religion is a positive contributor to mental health.

He specifically addresses and rebuts the claim that religious belief is a [[delusion]]. He quotes the definition in the ''Oxford Companion to Mind'' as "a fixed, idiosyncratic belief, unusual in the culture to which the person belongs" suggesting that "most great philosophers have believed in God",{{sfn|Ward|p=170}} and that the many religious people who exhibit a high degree of rational ability "... and who can produce a reasonable and coherent defense of their beliefs" refute the idea that belief in God is a delusion—whether or not it may be mistaken.{{sfn|Ward|p=172}} He also analyses and rejects the idea that faith is a brain malfunction, quoting [[Gerald Edelman]]: "The evolutionary assumption [that consciousness conferred fitness]... implies that consciousness is efficacious - that is, it is not an epiphenomenon",{{sfn|Ward|p=177 quoting [[Gerald Edelman|Edelman]]'s ''Bright Air, Brilliant Fire''}} and suggests that, if consciousness can apprehend truth and cause action, so can faith. Ward suggests that, although harm has been done in the name of religion, the same is true of [[politics]] and science, that religion can "be used to inspire heroic love and commitment. The world would be much poorer without Martin Luther King, [[Mahatma Gandhi|Gandhi]], [[Mother Teresa]]... [[Johann Sebastian Bach|Bach]] ... [[Francis of Assisi|St Francis]], [[Gautama Buddha|Siddartha Gautama]], [[Jesus]]".{{sfn|Ward|p=180}} He cites many positive contributions made by [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]] (he cites in particular founding hospitals, hospices, schools and universities, great works of art, the investigation into the world as the creation of one wise and rational God that gave birth to modern science,{{sfn|Ward|p=184. He notes that Copernicus, Kepler, [[Francis Bacon]] and Isaac Newton were inspired by their Christian faith "to investigate the natural world because of their belief that it was wisely ordered and accessible to human reason"}} the [[Truth and reconciliation commission]], and the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]]) and [[Islam]], and suggests that "there is plenty of room for common social action in mercy and hospitality between Christians and Muslims, and it is imperative that such commonalities are promoted".{{sfn|Ward|p=188}} He concludes by stating that Religion "''is the compassionate heart of what might otherwise seem to be a cold and heartless world''".

The [[Muslim]] population of [[Guatemala]] is approximately 1,200 (0.008% of the total population), of which 95% are [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] immigrants. There is a mosque in the outskirts of [[Guatemala City]] called the Islamic [[Da'wah Mosque of Guatemala]] (Spanish: Mezquita de Aldawaa Islámica) which is available for the five daily prayers and offers classes in Islamic studies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.prensalibre.com/pl/domingo/archivo/revistad/2005/junio05/050605/dfondo.shtml prensalibre.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927193115/http://www.prensalibre.com/pl/domingo/archivo/revistad/2005/junio05/050605/dfondo.shtml |date=2007-09-27 }} (in Spanish)&lt;/ref&gt;

The president of the Islamic Community of the country is Jamal Mubarak.

The main [[Ahmadiyya]] mosque in the country is Mezquita Baitul Awwal, first constructed in 1989. However, the Community also has mosques in [[Huehuetenango]] and [[Quetzaltenango]]. There are about 700 [[Ahmadi]]s in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.elperiodico.com.gt/es/20111205/pais/204585/ | title=Ahmadía, el ala pacífi ca del Islam, atrae a guatemaltecos | accessdate=June 2, 2014 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602200552/http://www.elperiodico.com.gt/es/20111205/pais/204585/ | archivedate=June 2, 2014 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicfinder.org/getitWorld.php?id=93288 Mezquita Baitul Awwal]: Km. 20.3 Carretera a San Lucas, Guatemala City, Guatemala&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karmic astrology''' is practiced by some [[astrologer]]s who believe in [[reincarnation]] though the concept of [[Karma]] is not always associated to [[Indian religions]]. Indeed, [[Edgar Cayce]], a devout Christian, professed that the position of the planets at birth records the time spent by the souls on other planets (or perhaps their spiritual counterparts) in between incarnations.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Gammon, ''Astrology and the Edgar Cayce Readings'', A.R.E. Press, [[Virginia Beach]], 1967.&lt;/ref&gt; Some karmic astrologers have professed they can read the person's karma in a [[Natal chart]] by studying ''in particular'' [[Lunar node]]s and [[Apparent retrograde motion|retrograde planets]].&lt;ref&gt;Martin Schulman, ''Karmic Astrology, Volume 1: The Moon's Nodes and Reincarnation'', Weiser Books, 1975, {{ISBN|0-87728-288-9}} and Martin Schulman, ''Karmic Astrology, Volume 2: Retrogrades and Reincarnation'', Samuel Weiser Inc., 1977, {{ISBN|0-87728-345-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Other astrologers, such as [[Dane Rudhyar]]'s protégé Alexander Ruperti, have lectured that ''everything''&lt;ref&gt;despite the fact that his only book translated into English deals solely with Jupiter, Saturn and Uranus cycles.&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[Natal Chart]] is karmic.

{{DEFAULTSORT:Karmic Astrology}}
[[Category:Astrology]]

'''NO DEEDS GO UNNOTICED''' – means all your karma and action is noticed and you will get results accordingly
'''
Karmic Astrology:''' 

The word Karma/Karmic is literally known as action. Karma embraces the idea that what you have done or what has been done by you in the past life. 

Both benevolent acts and selfishly motivated acts eventually come back to us as good and bad karma respectively. This could be in the same lifetime, or perhaps several hundred years down the line. 

Karmic astrology is the science of discerning as accurately as possible, through the positions of planets in your birth/divisional chart, the reasons why you are the way you are and why you act the way you do. 

Karmic astrology also provides you guidance to resolve past life situations so as to wipe your slate clean and make room for more positive karma in your current lifetime.

The Karmic planetary positions are divided into five parts:-

'''The Sun:''' 

The Planet Sun tells about your life’s purpose since it is a soul planet, so it will indicate about your weaknesses, fears, rational thinking etc..

Your Karmic life purpose  weaknesses, fears

'''The Moon:'''

The Planet Moon symbolizes the memory of our Karmic Past, detailed analysis of the Moon will clear all your unresolved past issues.
 
Memories of your Karmic past - unresolved past life issues that have been re-simulated.
'''
Saturn:''' 

In general context the planet Saturn is famous for creating troubles and issues but the Karmic substances says that the planet Saturn judges your Karma and provides fruits accordingly. 

But at times it will stand as a stumbling block as well.

Your Karmic Stumbling blocks

'''Rahu:''' 

Do you know that planet Rahu is the root cause of Karma and without Rahu one cannot perform Karma internally or externally?

Your Karmic roots

'''Ketu:''' 

You may be aware of the importance of planet Ketu which is called a spiritual planet, it is the planet which guides us about our Karmic Path and makes us follow positive path that leads you towards a beautiful and comfortable life.

Your Karmic Path

Apart from all this, actually Vedic Folks will analyze your birth chart, about your Karma or action and Karmic factors also, along with the 5th &amp; 9th houses and their lords would also be analyzed for getting exact and transparent results.</text>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3714">The '''Latin American Theological Fellowship''' ({{lang-es|Fraternidad Teológica Latinoamericana}} or FTL) is an interdenominational [[Latin American]] organization which has emphasized the collaborative [[theology|theological]] work of Latin American [[evangelical]]s.

== Early history ==
In response to the developments of more [[liberal theology|liberal]] Christian groups in Latin American and through the [[World Council of Churches]], the [[Billy Graham Evangelistic Association]] initiated in 1969 the First Latin American Congress for Evangelization ({{lang-es|Congreso Latinoamericano de Evangelización}} or CLADE I).&lt;ref name="Salinas2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Salinas|first=Daniel|title=Latin American Evangelical Theology in the 1970's: The Golden Decade|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=py6wCQAAQBAJ|year=2009|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-474-3043-8|pages=83–120}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to the Ecuadorian theologian C. René Padilla, CLADE I was "made in the USA" and had very little Latin American contribution.&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"&gt;{{cite thesis|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David C.|title=C. René Padilla: Integral Mission and the Reshaping of Global Evangelicalism|type=PhD|publisher=University of Edinburgh|year=2015|pages=149-176}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, in 1970, Peter Savage, [[C. René Padilla]], Samuel Escobar, and a number of others met just outside [[Cochabamba, Bolivia]] to discuss the formation of the new group: the Fraternidad Teológica Latinoamericana. The meeting was not without its controversies, including Padilla challenging whether the "North American" preoccupation with [[Biblical inerrancy]] was correct or needed for the establishment of the Latin American group. It was ultimately omitted from the founding "declaration" of this group.&lt;ref name="Salinas2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirkpatrick"/&gt;

It was through the FTL that the notion of "[[integral mission|misión integral]]" (often translated as holistic or integral mission) was spread, first throughout Latin American evangelicalism, then later through global evangelicalism by way of [[First International Congress on World Evangelization|Lausanne]] 1974. It was a notion that was developed by René Padilla in the 1950s, which emphasized the gospel as needing to uphold both [[evangelism]] and [[social responsibility]], and is seen as an evangelical form of Latin American [[liberation theology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kirkpatrick|first=David C.|date=April 2016|year=|title=C. René Padilla and the Origins of Integral Mission in Post-War Latin America|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/journal-of-ecclesiastical-history/article/c-rene-padilla-and-the-origins-of-integral-mission-in-post-war-latin-america/0566D6A9D1D180A4F9FCC89340774E30|journal=The Journal of Ecclesiastical History|volume=67|issue=2|pages=351–371|doi=10.1017/S0022046915001670|issn=0022-0469|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Today ==
The FTL has groups throughout most countries of Latin America, known as "núcleos," which promote its understanding of theology and mission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://infemit.org/global-network/latin-america/|title=Latin America|accessdate=6 January 2018|publisher=International Fellowship of Mission as Transformation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Catholic church in [[Finland]]''' (where the state church is Lutheran) '''and its insular dependency''' has a tiny Latin hierarchy, comprising no [[ecclesiastical province]] nor belonging to any (all sees being exempt, i.e. directly subject to the Holy See), and has no national [[episcopal conference]], but the tiny Finnish episcopate partakes in the [[Episcopal conference of Scandinavia]].

The only proper see is Latin: a full bishopric in the national capital [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Helsinki]].

The Eastern Catholics are pastorally served by a transnational [[apostolic exarchate]] from Germany. There are no pre-diocesan or other Latin exempt jurisdictions.

There formally is also an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] to Finland, as papal embassy-level diplomatic representation, but it is vested in the Apostolic Nunciature to Sweden (in [[Djursholm]]), as are the nunciatures to [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Iceland]], covering the Nordic countries.

== Current jurisdictions ==

=== Latin jurisdictions ===
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Helsinki]], which also covers [[Åland Islands]]

=== ''Eastern Catholic jurisdiction'' ===
:''[[Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church|Ukrainian Catholic Church]] ([[Byzantine rite]] in [[Ukrainian language]])

* [[Ukrainian Catholic Apostolic Exarchate in Germany and Scandinavia]], also covering [[Germany]] (with the see in Münich), [[Denmark]], [[Norway]] and [[Sweden]]

== Defunct jurisdictions ==
No titular sees

=== Pre-Reformation Latin ===
* [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Åbo]] (Turku)

=== Post-Reformation ===
Only [[Apostolic Vicariate of Finland]], the direct precursors of the current Latin see.

|"I'm an atheist. My mother is very religious, a churchgoer. She would often encourage me to go to church as well, but never forced it upon me, which I thought was quite decent of her. [...] There was no defining moment in which I decided there was no god for me, it was more of a growing process. I do feel that whatever religious beliefs I had as a child were foisted upon me. It's like when you ask where Grandma went when she died, and you'd be told that she went to heaven. I wouldn't necessarily view that as a bad thing, but it was stuff like that which I think hindered my intellectual development. Now that I've grown, I prefer a different interpretation." &lt;ref&gt;Christopher Eccleston, ''The Heaven and Earth Show'', BBC1, Sunday April 3, 2005, 10:30.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''{{IAST|Nāḍī}}''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|n|ɑː|d|i}}; {{lang-sa|नाडी|lit=tube, pipe}}&lt;ref&gt;Pronounced with a [[Vowel length|long]] 'a' and a [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]] 'd'&lt;/ref&gt;; {{lang-ta|நாடி|lit=nerve, blood vessel, pulse}} {{pronunciation|ta-நாடி.ogg|listen|(|help=no}}) is a term for the channels through which, in traditional Indian medicine and spiritual science, the energies of the [[human body|physical body]], the [[subtle body]] and the [[causal body]] are said to flow. Within this philosophical framework, the nadis are said to connect at special points of intensity called [[chakra|nadichakra]]s.&lt;ref name=LOP&gt;"''Light on Pranayama''" (''Ch. 5: Nadis and Chakras'')&lt;/ref&gt;

== Introduction ==
Nadi is an important concept in [[Hindu philosophy]], mentioned and described in the sources some of which have about 3,000 years of history. The amount of nadis of the human body are claimed to be up to hundred-of-thousands and even millions. In regard to [[Kundalini yoga]], there are three important nadis: '''''ida''''', '''''pingala''''', and '''''sushumna''''' (for the alternate names, see the section below). ''Ida'' (इडा, iḍā  "comfort") lies to the left of the spine, whereas ''pingala'' (पिङ्गल, piṅgala "tawny (brown)", "golden", "solar") is to the right side of the spine, mirroring the ida. ''Sushumna'' (सुषुम्णा, suṣumṇā "very gracious", "kind"&lt;ref&gt;[http://spokensanskrit.de/index.php?script=DI&amp;beginning=0+&amp;tinput=Sushumna&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU spokensanskrit.de]&lt;/ref&gt;) runs along the spinal cord in the center, through the seven [[chakras]]. Under the correct conditions the energy of [[kundalini]] is said to uncoil and enter ''sushumna'' through the ''brahma dwara'' or gate of Brahma at the base of the spine.

The [[Shiva Samhita]] treatise on yoga states, for example, that out of 350,000 nadis 14 are particularly important, and among them, the three just mentioned are the three most vital.&lt;ref name=LOP/&gt;

== Early references ==
Several of the ancient [[Upanishad]]s use the concept of nadis (channels). Nadi system is mentioned in the [[Chandogya Upanishad]] (8~6 cc. BCE), verse 8.6.6.&lt;ref&gt;For reference to Chandogya Upanishad 8.6.6 and interpretation as an early form of the occult physiology see: McEvilley, Thomas. "The Spinal Serpent", in: Harper and Brown, p.94.&lt;/ref&gt; and in verses 3.6-3.7 of the [[Prasna Upanishad]] (second half of the 1 millennium BC). As stated in the last,

{{blockquote|''3.6'' "In the heart verily is ''[[Jivatma|Jivātma]]''. Here a hundred and one ''nāḍis'' arise. For each of these nāḍis there are one hundred ''nāḍikās''. For each of these there are thousands more. In these ''[[Vyana|Vyâna]]'' moves."&lt;br /&gt;''3.7'' "Through one of these, the ''Udâna'' leads us upward by virtue of good deeds to the good worlds, by sin to the sinful worlds, by both to the worlds of men indeed." (PU Q3)&lt;ref&gt;''Nāḍikās'' are small nadis.&lt;br /&gt;''Udâna'' are often translated as "out-breathing" in this context. Perhaps a metaphor for death.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prasna Upanishad, Question 3 § 6, 7.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Varaha Upanishad]] (13-16 cc. CE) further describes it as follows:

{{blockquote|"The nāḍis penetrate the body from the soles of the feet to the crown of the head. In them is ''[[prāṇa]]'', the breath of life and in that life abides ''[[Ātman (Hinduism)|Ātman]]'', which is the abode of ''[[Shakti]]'', creatrix of the animate and inanimate worlds." (VU 54/5)&lt;ref&gt;Varahopanisad V, 54/5.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Functions and activities ==
In the [[yoga]] theory, nadis are said to carry life force energies known as ''[[prana]]''. 
In the physical body, the nadis are channels carrying air, water, nutrients, blood and other bodily fluids around and are similar to the [[arteries]], [[veins]], [[capillaries]], [[bronchioles]], [[nervous system|nerves]], [[lymph system|lymph canals]] and so on.&lt;ref name=LOP/&gt; In yoga theory, the physical body is often referred to as "[[Three Bodies Doctrine (Vedanta)#Sthula sarira|the gross body]]" (Sanskrit ''Sthula sarira'').

In the subtle and the causal body, the nadis are channels for so called cosmic, vital, seminal, mental, intellectual, etc. energies (collectively described as ''prana'') and are important for sensations, consciousness and the spiritual [[Aura (paranormal)|aura]].&lt;ref name=LOP/&gt;

Yoga texts disagree on the number of nadis in the human body. [[Hatha Yoga Pradipika]] and [[Goraksha Samhita]] quote 72,000 nadis, each branching off into another 72,000 nadis, whereas [[Shiva Samhita]] states 350,000 nadis arise from the navel center.&lt;ref name=LOP/&gt;

All nadis are said to originate from one of two centres; the heart and the ''kanda'', the last being an egg-shaped bulb in the [[pelvis|pelvic area]], just below the navel.&lt;ref name=LOP/&gt;

When awakened, [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] travels upward within Sushumna.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Avalon, ''The Serpentine Power'' (collection of yoga-tantric texts)&lt;/ref&gt; The Ida and Pingala nadis are often seen as referring to the two hemispheres of the [[brain]]. Pingala is the extroverted (Active), [[sun|solar]] nadi, and corresponds to the right hand side of the body and the left hand side of the [[brain]]. Ida is the introverted, [[moon|lunar]] nadi, and corresponds to the left hand side of the body and the right hand side of the [[brain]] (there is a contralateralization). These nadis are also said to have an extrasensory function, playing a part in empathic and instinctive responses.  The two nadis are believed to be stimulated through different [[Pranayama]] practices, including nadi shodhana, which involves alternately breathing through the left and right nostrils, which would theoretically stimulate the left and right sides of the brain respectively. The word ''nadi'' comes from the [[Sanskrit]] root ''nad'' meaning "channel", "stream", or "flow". Special breathing techniques are supposed to influence the flow of prana within these nadis. According to this interpretation, these techniques will purify and develop these two energetic currents and may lead to the awakening of [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]].

=== Ida, Pingala and Sushumna ===

* '''Ida''' is associated with lunar energy. The word ''ida'' means "comfort" in [[Sanskrit]]. Idā has a moonlike nature and feminine energy with a cooling effect.&lt;ref name="ISHA-NADI"&gt;[http://www.ishafoundation.org/blog/yoga-meditation/demystifying-yoga/the-three-fundamental-nadis/ Three fundamental nadis]&lt;/ref&gt; It courses from the left testicle to the left nostril and corresponds to the Ganges river.
* '''Pingala''' is associated with solar energy. The word ''pingala'' means "tawny" in [[Sanskrit]]. Pingala has a sunlike nature and masculine energy.&lt;ref name="ISHA-NADI"/&gt; Its temperature is heating and courses from the right testicle to the right nostril. It corresponds to the river [[Yamuna]].

The Ida and Pingala nadis are often seen as referring to the two hemispheres of the brain. Pingala is the extroverted, solar nadi, and corresponds to left hemisphere . Ida is the introverted, lunar nadi, and refers to the right hemisphere of the brain.
Ida nadi controls all the mental processes while Pingala nadi controls all the vital processes.

* '''Sushumna''', which interpenetrates the cerebrospinal axis, and in [[swara yoga]] is associated with both nostrils being open and free to the passage of air. The lunar channel Ida is pale in color and located on the left side. It is associated with feminine attributes, the moon and an open left nostril. The solar channel Pingala is red in color and located on the right side. It is associated with masculine attributes, the light of the sun, and an open right nostril.&lt;ref&gt;Tommaso Palamidessi, ''The Occult Constitution of Man and Woman'', [http://www.archeosofica.org/en/content/view/140/37/ Bio-energy and the energetic ducts]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sushumna'' connects the [[Muladhara|base chakra]] to the [[Sahasrara|crown chakra]]. It is very important in [[Yoga]] and [[Tantra]] in general. In [[Raja Yoga]] or Yoga of [[Patanjali]], when the mind is quietened through [[Yama]], [[Niyama]], [[Asana]] and [[Pranayama]] the important state of [[Pratyahara]] begins. A person entering this state never complains of Dispersion of Mind. This is characterized by observing the movements/jerks in sushumna in the subtle body. Sushumna makes the way for the ascent of [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]].

The medieval ''[[Sat-Cakra-Nirupana]]'' (1520s), one of the later and more fully developed classical texts on nadis and chakras, refers to these three main nadis by the names '''Sasi''', '''Mihira''', and Susumna.

{{blockquote|In the space outside the Meru, the right apart from the body placed on the left and the right, are the two Nadis, Sasi and Mihira. The Nadi Susumna, whose substance is the threefold Gunas, is in the middle. She is the form of Moon, Sun, and Fire even water also; Her body, a string of blooming Dhatura flowers, extends from the middle of the Kanda to the Head, and the Vajra inside Her extends, shining, from the Medhra to the Head.&lt;ref&gt;Sat-Cakra-Narupana, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QaN8Ix66P-EC&amp;pg=320#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Muladhara Cakra''], transl. Sir John Woodroffe in ''The Serpent Power: Being the Ṣaṭ-cakra-nirūpana and Pādukā-pañcaka''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Other traditions and interpretations ==
Other cultures also work with concepts similar to nadis and prana.

=== Chinese ===
Systems based on [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]] work with an energy concept called ''[[qi]]''. Qi travels through meridians similar in description to the nadis. The [[microcosmic orbit]] practice has many similarities to certain Indian nadi shuddha (channel clearing) exercises and the practice of [[Kriya Yoga]].

=== Tibetan ===
Tibetan medicine borrows many concepts from Yoga through the influence of [[Vajrayana|Tantric Buddhism]]. One of the [[Six Yogas of Naropa]] is a cleansing of the central channel called [[phowa]], preparing the soul to leave the body through the [[sagittal suture]]. The Vajrayana practice of [[Trul Khor]] is another practice used to direct and control the flow of energy within the body's energetic meridians through breath control and physical postures.

=== European ===
Sometimes the three main nadis (Ida, Pingala and Sushumna) are related to the [[Caduceus]] of Hermes: "the two snakes of which symbolize the kundalini or serpent-fire which is presently to be set in motion along those channels, while the wings typify the power of conscious flight through higher planes which the development of that fire confers".&lt;ref&gt;C. W. Leadbeater, ''Chakras'', Adyar, 1929&lt;/ref&gt;

Being born in Hawaii, she was given the Hawaiian name "Hōkūlani". The inspiration for the name came from a baby elephant born around the same time at the [[Honolulu Zoo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/2484641/nicole-kidman-was-named-for-a-dead-elephant-meryl-streep-is-mary-video/|title=Nicole Kidman was named for a dead elephant Meryl Streep is Mary [video]}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the name is also a commonly used Hawaiian name for girls, Hokulani meaning "Heavenly Star".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Meryl Streep and Nicole Kidman discuss their birth names - The Graham Norton Show: Episode 3 - BBC|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnIyOwgnITo|website=YouTube|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of Kidman's birth, her father was a graduate student at the [[University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa]]. He became a visiting fellow at the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] of the United States. Opposed to the war in Vietnam, Kidman's parents participated in anti-war protests while living in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;Dickerson, James L.

In 1984, her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, which caused Kidman to halt her acting work temporarily while she studied [[massage therapist|massage]] so she could help her mother with physical therapy.&lt;ref name="EllisSutherland2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lucy Ellis|author2=Bryony Sutherland|title=Nicole Kidman: the biography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uaAbAQAAIAAJ|date=October 2002|publisher=Aurum|page=34|quote=Nicole withdrew from all acting jobs and enrolled on a massage course so that she could relieve her mother's suffering with physical therapy.}}&lt;/ref&gt; She began gaining popularity in the mid-1980s after appearing in several film roles, including ''[[BMX Bandits (film)|BMX Bandits]]'' (1983), ''Watch the Shadows Dance'' (1987 aka ''Nightmaster''), and the romantic comedy ''[[Windrider]]'' (1986), which earned Kidman attention due to her racy scenes.

Kidman next starred with [[Sam Neill]] in ''[[Dead Calm (film)|Dead Calm]]'' (1989) as Rae Ingram, playing the wife of a naval officer. The thriller brought Kidman to international recognition; ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' commented: "Throughout the film, Kidman is excellent.

In 1995, Kidman appeared in her highest-grossing live-action film (as of 2018),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://boxofficemojo.com/people/chart/?id=nicolekidman.htm |title= Nicole Kidman at Box Office Mojo |accessdate= 27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; playing [[Dr. Chase Meridian]], the [[damsel in distress]], in the superhero film ''[[Batman Forever]]'', opposite [[Val Kilmer]] as the film's [[Batman|title character]]. The same year Kidman starred in [[Gus Van Sant]]'s critically acclaimed dark comedy ''[[To Die For]]'', in which she played the murderous newcaster Suzanne Stone. Of Kidman's Golden Globe award-winning performance, [[Mick LaSalle]] of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' said "[she] brings to the role layers of meaning, intention and impulse. Telling her story in close-up – as she does throughout the film – Kidman lets you see the calculation, the wheels turning, the transparent efforts to charm that succeed in charming all the same."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/1995/10/06/DD13291.DTL|title=Film Review-- Kidman Monstrously Good in `To Die For'|publisher=sfgate.com|accessdate=29 April 2009 |last=LaSalle |first=Mike|date=6 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidman next appeared in ''[[The Portrait of a Lady (film)|The Portrait of a Lady]]'' (1996), based on the novel [[The Portrait of a Lady|of the same name]], alongside [[Barbara Hershey]], [[John Malkovich]], and [[Mary-Louise Parker]].

[[File:Nicole kidman3cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Kidman at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]] premiere of ''[[Moulin Rouge!]]'']]
In 1999, Kidman reunited with then husband, Tom Cruise, to portray a married couple in ''[[Eyes Wide Shut]]'', the final film of director [[Stanley Kubrick]]. The film was subject to censorship controversies due to the explicit nature of its sex scenes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.brightlightsfilm.com/35/eyeswideshut1.html |last=Castle |first=Robert | title = Eyes Wide Shut|publisher=brightlightsfilm.com | date = January 2002 |accessdate =24 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film received further attention following Kubrick's death shortly before its release.

Her performance and her singing received positive reviews; Paul Clinton of ''CNN.com'' called it her best work since ''To Die For'', and wrote "[she] is smoldering and stunning as Satine. She moves with total confidence throughout the film [...] Kidman seems to specialize in "ice queen" characters, but with Satine, she allows herself to thaw, just a bit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2001/SHOWBIZ/Movies/05/31/review.moulin.rouge/index.html|title=Review: 'Moulin Rouge' dazzling, electrifying|last=Clinton|first=Paul|publisher=CNN.com|date=31 May 2001|accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Kidman received her second [[Golden Globe Award]], for [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Musical or Comedy|Best Actress in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy]], as well as many other acting awards and nominations. She also received her first [[Academy Award]] nomination, for [[Best Actress in a Leading Role|Best Actress]].

Also in 2001, she had a starring role in [[Alejandro Amenábar]]'s horror film ''[[The Others (2001 film)|The Others]]'' as Grace Stewart, a mother living in the Channel Islands during [[World War II]] who suspects her house is haunted. Grossing over $210,947,037 worldwide, the film also earned several [[Goya Awards]] award nominations, including a [[Goya Award for Best Actress|Best Actress]] nomination for Kidman. She received her second [[55th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Film in 2002 - British Academy Film Awards | work=[[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]] | url=http://awards.bafta.org/award/2002/film | access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and fifth [[59th Golden Globe Awards|Golden Globe]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Winners &amp; Nominees - Nicole Kidman | work=[[Golden Globes]] | url=https://www.goldenglobes.com/person/nicole-kidman | access-date=10 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; nominations. Roger Ebert commented that "Alejandro Amenábar has the patience to create a languorous, dreamy atmosphere, and Nicole Kidman succeeds in convincing us that she is a normal person in a disturbing situation, and not just a standard-issue horror movie hysteric."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20010810/REVIEWS/108100305/1023 |title=The Others (2001) |accessdate=28 April 2010 | work=Chicago Sun-Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kidman was named the [[People (magazine)|World's Most Beautiful Person by People magazine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/05/02/1019441403502.html|title=Nicole "the most beautiful person in the world"|work=theage.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Kidman won critical praise for her portrayal of [[Virginia Woolf]] in [[Stephen Daldry]]'s ''[[The Hours (film)|The Hours]]'', which stars [[Meryl Streep]] and [[Julianne Moore]]. Kidman famously wore prosthetics that were applied to her nose making her almost unrecognisable playing the author during her time in 1920s England, and her bouts with depression and mental illness while trying to write her novel, ''[[Mrs. Dalloway]]''. The film earned positive notices and several nominations, including for an [[Academy Award for Best Picture]]. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that, "Ms. Kidman, in a performance of astounding bravery, evokes the savage inner war waged by a brilliant mind against a system of faulty wiring that transmits a searing, crazy static into her brain".&lt;ref&gt;[https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9C0DE6DE113CF934A15751C1A9649C8B63&amp;partner=Rotten Tomatoes "The Hours (2002), FILM REVIEW; Who's Afraid Like Virginia Woolf?"] ''The New York Times''&lt;/ref&gt; Kidman won numerous critics' awards, including her first [[British Academy of Film and Television Arts|BAFTA]], third [[Golden Globe Award for Best Actress&amp;nbsp;– Motion Picture Drama|Golden Globe]], and the [[Academy Award for Best Actress]]. As the first Australian actress to win an Academy Award, Kidman made a teary acceptance speech about the importance of art, even during [[2003 invasion of Iraq|times of war]], saying, "Why do you come to the Academy Awards when the world is in such turmoil? Because art is important. And because you believe in what you do and you want to honour that, and it is a tradition that needs to be upheld."&lt;ref&gt;[http://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/story?id=101118&amp;page=1 Memorable Moments From Oscar Night].

Following her Oscar win, Kidman appeared in three very different films in 2003. The first, a leading role in ''[[Dogville]]'', by Danish director [[Lars von Trier]], was an [[experimental film]] set on a bare [[soundstage]]. Though the film divided critics in the United States, Kidman still earned praise for her performance. Peter Travers of ''Rolling Stone'' magazine stated: "Kidman gives the most emotionally bruising performance of her career in Dogville, a movie that never met a cliche it didn't stomp on."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/dogville-20040326 |title=Dogville |last=Travers |first=Peter |publisher=''Rolling Stone'' |date=23 March 2004 |accessdate=12 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second was an adaptation of [[Philip Roth]]'s novel ''[[The Human Stain (film)|The Human Stain]]'', opposite [[Anthony Hopkins]]. Her third film was [[Anthony Minghella]]'s war drama ''[[Cold Mountain (film)|Cold Mountain]]''. Kidman appeared opposite [[Jude Law]] and [[Renée Zellweger]], playing [[Southern United States|Southerner]] Ada Monroe, who is in love with Law's character and separated by the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]. ''TIME'' magazine wrote, "Kidman takes strength from Ada's plight and grows steadily, literally luminous. Her sculptural pallor gives way to warm radiance in the firelight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | work=Time | title = O Lover, Where Art Thou? | date= 14 December 2003 | url = http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1101031222-561493,00.html#ixzz1Hru3drwo | first=Richard | last=Corliss}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film garnered several award nominations and wins for its actors; Kidman received her sixth Golden Globe nomination at the [[61st Golden Globe Awards]] for Best Actress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=61st Annual Golden Globe Awards – Nominees and Winners|url=http://movies.about.com/cs/miscellanous/a/ggnom121803.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=10 November 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131110020416/http://movies.about.com/cs/miscellanous/a/ggnom121803.htm|archivedate=10 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 she appeared in the film ''[[Birth (film)|Birth]]'', which received controversy over a scene in which Kidman shares a bath with her co-star, 10-year-old [[Cameron Bright]]. At a press conference at the [[Venice Film Festival]], Kidman addressed the controversy saying, "It wasn't that I wanted to make a film where I kiss a 10-year-old boy.

Kidman appeared in the lead role as Joanna Eberhart, a successful producer. The film, directed by [[Frank Oz]], was critically panned and a commercial failure. The following year, Kidman appeared opposite [[Sean Penn]] in the [[Sydney Pollack]] thriller ''[[The Interpreter]]'', playing UN translator Silvia Broome. Also that year, she starred in ''[[Bewitched (2005 film)|Bewitched]]'', based on the [[Bewitched|1960s TV sitcom of the same name]], opposite [[Will Ferrell]].

In conjunction with her success in the film industry, Kidman became the face of the ''[[Chanel No. 5]]'' perfume brand. She starred in a campaign of television and print ads with [[Rodrigo Santoro]], directed by ''Moulin Rouge!'' director [[Baz Luhrmann]], to promote the fragrance during the holiday seasons of 2004, 2005, 2006, and 2008.

In 2007, she starred in the science-fiction movie ''[[The Invasion (film)|The Invasion]]'' directed by [[Oliver Hirschbiegel]], a remake of the 1956 ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'' that proved a critical and commercial failure.

'''Nirmala''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]]: ਨਿਰਮਲੇ) is an Indian religious sect of [[Asceticism|ascetics]] who interpret the [[Sikhism|Sikh]] philosophy in [[Advaita Vedanta|Vedantic]] terms. They variously claim to have originated during the period of [[Guru Nanak]] (15th-16th century) or [[Guru Gobind Singh]] (17th century).

== Origin ==

The origin of the Nirmalas is uncertain: the sect is first mentioned in the Sikh literature towards the end of the 18th century. In the 19th century, some Nirmala scholars traced their origin to the period of the first Sikh Guru, [[Nanak]], but some others traced their origin to the period of the last Sikh Guru, [[Gobind Singh]].&lt;ref name="Sulakhan_2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sulakhan Singh |chapter=Heterodoxy in Sikhism: An Exposition of Some Sectarian Developments ||editor=Parm Bakhshish Singh |title=Punjab History Conference, Thirty-second Session, March 17-19, 2000: Proceedings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PhRDAAAAYAAJ |year=2001 |publisher=Punjabi University |isbn=978-81-7380-722-0 |page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A popular account of the sect's origin appears in ''Nirmal Panth Pardipika'' (1891) by the Nirmala scholar Giani Gian Singh:&lt;ref name="Sulakhan_2005"/&gt; In 1686, Guru Gobind Singh met a Sanskrit scholar named Pandit Raghunath, and asked him to open a Sanskrit school for Sikhs. However, Raghunath refused to do so, because the Sikhs included people of low-caste origin. Therefore, the Guru sent five Sikhs (Bir Singh, Ganda Singh, Karam Singh, Ram Singh and Saina Singh&lt;ref name="Sulakhan_2000"/&gt;) to [[Varanasi]] to learn Sanskrit. These Sikhs were first members of the group that later came to be known as the Nirmala sect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Madanjit Kaur |title=Guru Gobind Singh: Historical and Ideological Perspective |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZG4MycGdpjAC&amp;pg=PA198 |year=2007 |publisher=Unistar |isbn=978-81-89899-55-4 |page=198 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After mastering Sanskrit in Kashi, they returned to Anandpur, where they were honoured by the title Nirmala (Sanskrit for "pure" or "unsullied").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XOY3V9pxcMMC&amp;pg=PA67 |title=Short Sketch of the Life and Works of Guru Gobind Singh |author=Bhagat Lakshman Singh |publisher=Asian Educational Services |year=1995 |isbn=9788120605763 |page=67 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They then taught and translated the texts they learned into Punjabi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Seetal|first1=Sohan|title=Prophet of Man, Guru Gobind Singh|publisher=Lyall Book Depot|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also then took the [[Amrit]] initiation into the Khalsa panth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kaur|first1=Madanjit|title=Guru Gobind Singh: Historical and Ideological Perspective|date=2007|publisher=Unistar Books|location=Chandigarh|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The historicity of this account is doubtful, as there are very few mentions of Nirmalas before the 19th century.&lt;ref name="Sulakhan_2005"&gt;{{cite book |author=Sulakhan Singh |chapter=Nirmal Panth Pardipika |editor=Sukhadial Singh |title=Punjab History Conference, Thirty-seventh Session, March 18-20, 2005: Proceedings |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzduAAAAMAAJ |year=2005 |publisher=Punjabi University |isbn=978-81-7380-990-3 |pages=220-221 |quote=As the Nirmalas do not seem to have been adequately mentioned in the Sikh literature before the 19th century, it is difficult to uphold the contention of Giani Gian Singh as historically true, rather it seems highly inprobable.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=W.

Fenech hypothesize that the Nirmalas originated much later or are descended from the [[Udasi]]s, who are similar to them in ascetic lifestyle, celibacy and [[Vedanta|Vedantic]] interpretation of Sikh philosophy.&lt;ref name="PSLEF_2014"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Pashaura Singh |author2=Louis E.

== History ==
[[File:PunditTaraSingh.png|thumb|130px|right|[[Pundit Tara Singh]] (1822–1891), a noted Nirmala Sikh published a number of works on Sikh theology.]]

Patronage from Sikh nobles, especially the rulers of the [[Phulkian sardars|Phulkian states]], helped the Nirmalas become a prominent religious order.&lt;ref name="PSLEF_2014"/&gt; Sardar Dhyan Singh of Shahbad willed his estate to Karam Singh Nirmala. In 1766, Sadda Singh of Bahirwala offered seven villages to Bhagat Singh Nirmala, although the latter declined the offer. Sardar Jai Singh's daughter-in-law granted two villages to the Nirmal [[dera (organization)|dera]] at Kankhal.&lt;ref name="SSG_2007"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=vZFBp89UInUC&amp;lpg=PA974&amp;pg=PA971 |title=History of Sikh Gurus Retold: 1606-1708 C.E |author=Surjit Singh Gandhi |publisher=Atlantic |year=2007 |isbn=9788126908585 |pages=971–974 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sardar Ganda Singh of [[Bhangi Misl]] offered 13 villages to Jai Singh Nirmala. In 1796, Maharaja [[Ranjit Singh]] also granted a [[sanad (deed)|sanad]] for land to Nihal Singh Nirmala. On both occasions, the Nirmalas passed on the properties to the Udasi akhara of Santokh Das.&lt;ref name="SSG_2007"/&gt;

== Philosophy and practices ==

Like the Udasis, the Nirmalas interpret the teachings of the Sikh Gurus in context of [[Vedanta]].&lt;ref name="PSLEF_2014"/&gt; They view the first Sikh Guru, [[Nanak]], as an [[Advaita Vedanta|Advaita Vedantist]], a follower of [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]], and a defender of the ''[[Sanatana dharma]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Lynn Teskey Denton |title=Female Ascetics in Hinduism |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2ivUAJ1YneQC&amp;pg=PA179 |year=2004 |publisher=SUNY Press |isbn=978-0-7914-6179-2 |pages=179–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, compared to the Udasis, the Nirmalas have shared a closer relationship the mainstream [[Khalsa]] Sikhs. Many prominent Nirmala [[Sant (religion)|sant]]s preached mainstream Sikhism in Punjab, and Nirmala akharas have played an important role in training Sikhs. But after the [[Akali movement]], the Khalsa attempts to create a Sikh identity completely distinct from Hindus made the Khalsa-Nirmala relationship fragile.&lt;ref name="PSLEF_2014"/&gt;

== Locations ==

The Nirmala Panchaati akhara at [[Kankhal]], established with grants from the rulers of Phulkian states, has the highest status among all Nirmala chapters.&lt;ref name="PSLEF_2014"/&gt; Other major Nirmala centres are located at [[Haridwar]], [[Allahabad]], [[Ujjain]], [[Trimbak]], [[Kurukshetra]] and [[Patna]].

== Notable Nirmalas ==
* Kavi Santokh Singh, (1787 - 1843), writer of historical [[Suraj Parkash]]
* Gaini Gyan Singh, (1822-1921), Perhaps most prominent Nirmale
* [[Pundit Tara Singh]] (1822–1891), Punjabi and Sanskrit scholar
* [[Kahn Singh Nabha]], (1861 – 1938), Prominent Sikh Scholar
* [[Balbir Singh Seechewal]], Prominent environmentalist

{{Mongolian shamanism}}
'''Ongon''' (Mongolian; plural '''ongod''', Turkish: '''Ongun''', Azerbaijanese: '''Onqon''') is a type of spirit in the [[Mongolian shamanism|shamanistic belief system]] of [[Mongolia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedersen|2011|p=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a common term in Turkish and Mongol mythologies. After death, all shamans become shamanic souls, ongod.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedersen|2011|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Idols can be consecrated to them within three years of the shaman's death and can be placed in the home ("home ongon") or in another locale, such as a shelter out in the open ("field ongon").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimamura|2004|p=546}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ongon is also the physical representation of that spirit, made by a shaman, which plays a central part in the ritual that invokes the protection of the spirit.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birtalan|2011|}}&lt;/ref&gt; One well-known such spirit is [[Dayan Deerh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Birtalan|2011|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ongon is particularly important in [[black shamanism]]: the main function of the ''khar talynkh'' or black shaman is to bring people into contact with the ongon, whose spirit they call up "while drumming in a trance".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimamura|2004|p=651}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late-nineteenth century Mongolia, according to Otgony Purev, [[yellow shamanism]] revered ongon as well, and every three years yellow shamans gathered in [[Dayan Deerh]] monastery in [[Khövsgöl Province]] to "renew" these ancestral spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Shimamura|2004|p=650}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Physical representation==
Ongod are represented in the physical world in various ways. In the case of the [[Tuvans|Tuvan]] shamaness Yamaan, an ancestor spirit is represented in the handle of a drum, a carved figure with a pink head and chest, a black crown, and red eyes and forehead. A wire serves as arms, and on another wire ''holbogo'' are suspended to indicate the spirit's earring.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pegg|2001|pp=127–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some ongon live on in the place inhabited by the shaman: Agaaryn Khairhan, a mountain in [[Khövsgöl Province]], takes its name from one of the most powerful shamanesses of the [[Darkhad]] clan, Agaaryn Khairhan or Bagdan Udgan, who lived on the mountain in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pegg|2001|p=121}}&lt;/ref&gt; In present-day Northern Mongolia, specifically the [[Darkhad Valley]], clusters of ongod are found in transitional or liminal locations, such as the mouths of rivers or the borders between taiga and steppe:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedersen|2011|p=167}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Darkhad Valley, the taiga and surrounding mountains are the traditional areas dominated by shamanism, where the steppe is dominated by Buddhism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Pedersen|2011|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Darkhad households own talismans, "lineage talismans" (''yazguur ongod'') or "household talismans" (''geriin ongod''), that both contain and attract spirits.&lt;ref name=pederson158&gt;{{harvnb|Pedersen|2011|p=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Our Lady of Sorrows of Turumba''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Nuestra Señora de los Dolores de Turumba''; [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]]: ''Mahál na Iná ng Pitóng Hapis ng Turumba'') is the image of the [[Virgin Mary]] as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]], enshrined in [[Pakil, Laguna]], in the [[Philippines]].

==Etymology==
The word ''turumba'' is from the [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]] phrase ''“Natumbá sa lakí ng tuwâ”'' ("Had trembled in great joy"). The first ''turumba'' in the icon's honour was held on September 14, 1788.

==Description==
The icon of [[Blessed Virgin Mary (Roman Catholic)|Our Lady]] is a {{convert|9|by|11|in|cm}} oil painting on canvas. The face of Mary is contorted by pain from the dagger plunged into her heart, which [[Simeon]] has prophesied. 

The icon is presently enshrined at the [[St. Peter of Alcantara Parish Church]] in Pakil. The second image of the Virgin Mary as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]] is an in-the-round replica of the image of Nuestra Señora de las Angustias from [[Spain]].

==History==
The image, according to tradition, belonged to some missionaries who crossed [[Laguna de Bay]] in a [[Launch (boat)|launch]]. When the launch was shipwrecked, some of its relics were washed ashore including the icon of the Virgin. 

One Friday morning, some fishermen found the icon in their nets. Believing it to be a religious image, they decided to bring it to a parish church. When the men carried the small painting, they found it too heavy. They tried sailing in directions with three icon until they brought it to the shore near Pakil Church. When they headed that way, the wind and current aided their course. Upon landing, they left the heavy image on a rock so they could continue their fishing duties.

A group of women found the icon the following Sunday morning. Although it had rained during the night, the canvas was miraculously dry. When they tried to take the icon away, they could not move it; even the strongest among them, Mariangga, could not lift it. They quickly told the parish priest, who in turn called the sacristans, choristers, and churchgoers at Mass to fetch the image. As they lifted the image, it gave way. The townsfolk around begun to sing and dance, giving birth to the ''turumba''. 

By order of [[Pope Pius XII]], and in recognition of the miracles credited to it, the Nuestra Señora de las Antiguas was episcopally crowned by Alejandro Olalia, the Bishop of Lipa, on 23-24 May 1953.

==Lupi Festival==
[[Image:St. Peter of Alcantara Parish.jpg|180px|thumb|right|Church of [[St Peter of Alcantara]] in [[Pakil]], [[Laguna (province)|Laguna]], where the image is enshrined.]]
The Seven days of Sorrows are known to the Philippines as Lupi fiestas:
* 1st Lupi or Biernes Dolores falls on the Friday preceding [[Palm Sunday]].
* 2nd Lupi or Pistang Martes falls on Tuesday following [[Easter Sunday]]
* 3rd Lupi or Pistang Biyatiko falls on the 2nd Wednesday after Easter Sunday.
* 4th Lupi or Pistang Biyernes falls on the 3rd Friday after Easter Sunday.
* 5th Lupi or Pistang Linggo falls on the 4th Sunday after Easter Sunday.
* 6th Lupi or [[Feast of the Ascension]] falls on the 5th Sunday after Easter.
* 7th Lupi or Feast of the Holy Spirit falls on the Sunday of [[Pentecost]]. 

The image is also taken on a procession on October 19, The Town Fiesta of Pakil. On the Sunday nearest September 15, The [[Catholic Church]] celebrates the national feast of the discovery of the image.

Homage to the Virgin of Sorrows is done by the way of song and dance, drumbeat and shill cries of its devotees that the people regard as co-sharing with Mary's grief during the Passion of Christ. The turumba episodes are called ''lupi'' (meaning to fold) it is so because at the closing of every festivities, the novena booklet is folded to mark the pause in preparation for the next Lupi.

Dresses of the Virgin are shredded and given to pilgrims as tokens. It was said that when the piece of cloth from the Virgin is kept close to one person, miraculous powers and against personal injury, accidents, fire and calamities happen. 

The statue is enshrined at the [[retablo]] in the main altar, The image is dressed in violet as a sign of sorrow for her son's passion (the color of [[Lent]]) And the original image is enshrined in a separate ''[[retablo]]'' around bas reliefs of her [[Seven Sorrows]] at a chapel in the church. St Peter of Alcantara Parish is located in [[Pakil, Laguna]]; over facing [[Laguna de Bay]]

[[File:Dr.Ambedkar with Periyar.jpg|thumb|[[B.R. Ambedkar]] with Periyar.]]
Erode Venkata Ramasamy was born on 17 September 1879 in [[Erode]], then a part of the [[Coimbatore district]] of the [[Madras Presidency]].&lt;ref name="Allahabad P.175"&gt;Journal of Indian history, Volume 54, By University of Allahabad, P.175&lt;/ref&gt; E.V. Ramasamy's father, Kannada speaking a rich Balija businessman, was Venkatappa Naicker (or Venkata), and his mother was Chinnathyee, Muthammal. He had one elder brother named Krishnaswamy and two sisters named Kannamma and Ponnuthoy.&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Allahabad P.175"/&gt; He later came to be known as "Periyar" meaning 'respected one' or 'elder' in [[Tamil language|Tamil]].&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Periyar|last=R|first=Muthukumar|publisher=Kizhaku Pathipakam|year=2008|isbn=9788184930337|location=Tamilnadu|pages=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Arooran-1&gt;{{cite book | last = Arooran| first = K.

E.V. Ramasamy married when he was 19, and had a daughter who lived for only 5 months. His first wife, Nagammai, died in 1933.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, M.D. (1991) ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', Chennai. Emerald Publishers, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; E.V.

He used to listen to Tamil [[Vaishnavite]] [[guru]]s who gave discourses in his house enjoying his father's hospitality. At a young age, he began questioning the apparent contradictions in the [[Hindu mythology|Hindu mythological]] stories.&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt; As Periyar grew, he felt that people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and therefore took it as one of his duties in life to warn people against superstitions and priests.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1"&gt;Veeramani, K. (1992) ''Periyar on Women's Rights''. Emerald Publishers: Madras, Introduction – xi.&lt;/ref&gt;

E.V. Ramasamy's father arranged for his wedding when he was nineteen. The bride, Nagammai, was only thirteen. Despite having an [[arranged marriage]], Periyar and Nagammai were already in love with each other. Nagammai actively supported her husband in his later public activities and [[agitator|agitations]]. Two years after their marriage, a daughter was born to them. However, their daughter died when she was five months old. The couple had no more children.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan"/&gt;

===Kasi Pilgrimage Incident===
In 1904, E.V. Ramasamy went on a pilgrimage to [[Varanasi|Kasi]] to visit the revered [[Shiva]] temple of [[Kashi Vishwanath]].&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Anita Diehl 1977"&gt;Anita Diehl.(1977). E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India, Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. {{ISBN|91-24-27645-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though regarded as one of the holiest sites of [[Hinduism]], he witnessed immoral activities such as begging, and floating dead bodies.&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt; His frustrations extended to functional Hinduism in general when he experienced what he called [[Brahmin|Brahmanic]] exploitation.&lt;ref name=Diehl-1&gt;{{cite book | last = Diehl| first = Anita | title = ''E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India'' | year = 1977| publisher = Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. {{ISBN|91-24-27645-6}}. | isbn = 91-24-27645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one particular incident in Kasi had a profound impact on E.V. Ramasamy's ideology and future work. At the worship site there were free meals offered to guests. To E.V. Ramasamy's shock, he was refused meals at choultries, which exclusively fed [[Brahmins]]. Due to extreme hunger, E.V. Ramasamy felt compelled to enter one of the eateries disguised as a Brahmin with a [[sacred thread]] on his bare chest, but was betrayed by his moustache. The gatekeeper at the temple concluded that E.V. Ramasamy was not a Brahmin, as Brahmins were not permitted by the Hindu ''[[shastras]]'' to have moustaches. He not only prevented Periyar's entry but also pushed him rudely into the street.&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt;

As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar was forced to feed on leftovers from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from [[South India]].&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt; This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of [[Varanasi|Kasi]] he had in mind, as a holy place which welcomed all.&lt;ref name="Periyar" /&gt; Ramasamy was a [[theist]] until his visit to [[Varanasi|Kasi]], after which his views changed and he became an [[atheist]].&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-1"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', pp. 14–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Member of Congress Party (1919–1925)===

[[File:Young Periyar.JPG|thumb|E.V. Ramasamy leading the [[Vaikom]] [[Satyagraha]] 1924.]]
[[File:EVR Statue, Vaikom.JPG|thumb|right|E.V. Ramasamy statue at [[Vaikom]] town in Kottayam, [[Kerala]]]]
E.V. Ramasamy joined the [[Indian National Congress]] in 1919 after quitting his business and resigning from public posts. He held the chairmanship of Erode Municipality and wholeheartedly undertook constructive programs spreading the use of [[Khadi]], picketing toddy shops, boycotting shops selling foreign cloth, and eradicating [[untouchability]]. In 1921, Periyar courted imprisonment for picketing toddy shops in Erode. When his wife as well as his sister joined the agitation, it gained momentum, and the administration was forced to come to a compromise. He was again arrested during the [[Non-Cooperation movement]] and the [[Temperance movement]].&lt;ref name=BarathidasanUniversity/&gt; In 1922, Periyar was elected the President of the [[Madras Presidency]] Congress Committee during the [[Tirupur]] session, where he advocated strongly for reservation in government jobs and education. His attempts were defeated in the Congress party due to a strong presence of discrimination and [[indifference (emotion)|indifference]], which led to his leaving the party in 1925.&lt;ref name="Kandasamy"/&gt;

===Vaikom Satyagraha (1924–1925)===
{{Main article|Vaikom Satyagraha}}
According to the prevalent caste system in Kerala and the rest of India, low-caste Hindus were denied entry into temples.
In Kerala, they were denied permission to walk on the roads that led to the temples also. (Kerala state was formed in 1956; earlier it was broadly divided into Malabar (North Kerala), Cochin and Travancore kingdoms).

In the Kakinada meet of the Congress Party in 1923, T K Madhavan presented a report citing the discrimination faced by the depressed castes in Kerala. That session decided to promote movements against untouchability.

In Kerala, a committee was formed comprising people of different castes to fight untouchability in the region. The committee was chaired by K Kelappan; the rest of the members were T K Madhavan, Velayudha Menon, Kurur Neelakantan Namboodiripad and T R Krishnaswami Iyer.
The movement started on 30th March 1924.
There was a board outside the Vaikom Mahadeva Temple which prohibited entry of avarnas (lower castes).
The Satyagrahis moved to enter the temple in batches of three. They were resisted and arrested by the police.
Gandhiji, Chatampi Swamikal and Sree Narayana Guru lend their support to the movement.
The movement gained all-India prominence and support came from far and wide.
The Akalis of Punjab lend their support by setting up kitchens to provide food to the Satyagrahis.
Even Christian and Muslim leaders came forward for support. This was shunned by Gandhiji who wanted the movement to be an intra-Hindu affair.
On advice from Gandhiji, the movement was withdrawn temporarily in April 1924.
After the talks with caste-Hindus failed, the leaders resumed the movement. Leaders T K Madhavan and K P Kesava Menon were arrested.
E V Ramaswamy (Periyar) came from Tamil Nadu to give his support. He was arrested.
On 1st October 1924, a group of savarnas (forward castes) marched in a procession and submitted a petition to the Regent Maharani Sethulakshmi Bai of Travancore with about 25000 signatures for temple entry to everyone.
Gandhiji also met with the Regent Maharani. This procession of savarnas was led by Mannath Padmanabhan Nair. Starting with about 500 people at Vaikom, the number increased to about 5000 when the procession reached Thiruvananthapuram in November 1924.

In February 1924, they decided to launch a ‘Keralaparyatanam’ to gain temple entry and also the right to use public roads for every Hindu irrespective of caste or creed. |url=https://byjus.com/free-ias-prep/vaikom-satyagraha |
In Vaikom, a small town in Kerala state, then [[Travancore]], there were strict laws of [[untouchability]] in and around the temple area. ''Dalits'', also known as [[Harijans]] were not allowed into the close streets around and leading to the temple, let alone inside it. Anti-caste feelings were growing and in 1924 Vaikom was chosen as a suitable place for an organised ''[[Satyagraha]].'' Under his guidance a movement had already begun with the aim of giving all castes the right to enter the temples. Thus, agitations and demonstrations took place. On 14th April, Periyar and his wife Nagamma arrived in Vaikom. They were immediately arrested and imprisoned for participation. In spite of Gandhi's objection to non-Keralites and non-Hindus taking part, Periyar and his followers continued to give support to the movement until it was withdrawn. He received the title ''Vaikom Veeran'', given by his followers who participated in the [[Satyagraha]].&lt;ref&gt;Diehl, Anita, "E.V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periyar", pp. 22–24&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Kent, David |title=Periyar |publisher=ACA |work= |url=http://www.atheist-community.org/library/articles/read.php?id=710 |accessdate=21 June 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615212743/http://atheist-community.org/library/articles/read.php?id=710 |archivedate=15 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="rereadingperiyar"&gt;{{cite news|title=Re-reading Periyar|author=Ravikumar|date=2 March 2006|url=http://www.countercurrents.org/dalit-ravikumar020306.htm|publisher=Countercurrents|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201142502/http://countercurrents.org/dalit-ravikumar020306.htm|archivedate=1 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The way in which the ''Vaikom Satyagraha'' events have been recorded provides a clue to the image of the respective organisers. In an article entitle ''Gandhi and Ambedkar, A Study in Leadership'', [[Eleanor Zelliot]] relates the 'Vaikom Satyagraha', including Gandhi's negotiations with the temple authorities in relation to the event. Furthermore, the editor of E.V. Ramasamy's ''Thoughts'' states that Brahmins purposely suppressed news about E.V. Ramasamy's participation. A leading Congress magazine, ''Young India'', in its extensive reports on Vaikom never mentions E.V. Ramasamy.&lt;ref name="Diehl-1"/&gt;

===Self-Respect Movement===
{{Main article|Self-Respect Movement}}
[[File:Periyar during Self respect movement.JPG|thumb|right|Periyar during the early years of [[Self-Respect Movement]]]]
Periyar and his followers campaigned constantly to influence and pressure the government to take measures to remove social inequality,(abolish untouchability, manual scavenging system etc) even while other nationalist forerunners focused on the struggle for political independence. The Self-Respect Movement was described from the beginning as "dedicated to the goal of giving non-Brahmins a sense of pride based on their Dravidian past".&lt;ref name="Diehl-3"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diehl| first = Anita | title = ''E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India'' | year = 1977| pages = 77 &amp; 78 | publisher = Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. {{ISBN|91-24-27645-6}}. | isbn = 91-24-27645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1952, the Periyar ''Self-Respect Movement Institution'' was registered with a list of objectives of the institution from which may be quoted as &lt;blockquote&gt;for the diffusion of useful knowledge of [[political science|political education]]; to allow people to live a life of freedom from slavery to anything against reason and [[self respect]]; to do away with needless customs, meaningless ceremonies, and blind [[superstitious belief]]s in society; to put an end to the present social system in which [[Caste system in India|caste]], religion, community and traditional occupations based on the accident of birth, have chained the mass of the people and created "superior" and "inferior" classes... and to give people equal rights; to completely eradicate untouchability and to establish a united society based on [[wikt:brotherhood|brother]]/[[wikt:sisterhood|sisterhood]]; to give [[Civil rights|equal rights]] to women; to prevent [[child marriages]] and marriages based on law favourable to one sect, to conduct and encourage love marriages, widow marriages, inter caste and inter-religious marriages and to have the marriages registered under the [[Civil law (area)|Civil Law]]; and to establish and maintain [[orphanage|homes for orphans]] and widows and to run educational institutions.&lt;ref name="Anita Diehl 1977"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; [[Propaganda|Propagation]] of the philosophy of ''self respect'' became the full-time activity of Periyar since 1925. A Tamil weekly ''[[Kudi Arasu]]'' started in 1925, while the English journal ''Revolt'' started in 1928 carried on the propaganda among the English educated people.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-1.1"&gt;Saraswathi, S. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Self-Respect Movement'' began to grow fast and received the sympathy of the heads of the Justice Party from the beginning. In May 1929, a conference of Self-Respect Volunteers was held at Pattukkotai under the [[presidency]] of S. Guruswami. K.V. Alagiriswami took charge as the head of the volunteer band. Conferences followed in succession throughout the [[List of districts of Tamil Nadu|Tamil districts]] of the former Madras Presidency. A training school in Self-Respect was opened at Erode, the home town of Periyar. The object was not just to introduce social reform but to bring about a [[social revolution]] to foster a new spirit and build a new society.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-1.15"&gt;Saraswathi, S. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===International travel (1929–1932)===
Between 1929 and 1935, under the strain of [[World Depression]], political thinking worldwide received a jolt from the spread of international communism.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-1.1555"/&gt; Indian political parties, movements and considerable sections of leadership were also affected by inter-continental ideologies. The Self-Respect Movement also came under the influence of the leftist philosophies and institutions. E.V. Ramasamy, after establishing the ''Self-Respect Movement'' as an independent institution, began to look for ways to strengthen it politically and socially. To accomplish this, he studied the history and politics of different countries, and personally observed these systems at work.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-1.1555"/&gt;

E.V. Ramasamy toured [[British Malaya|Malaya]] for a month, from December 1929 to January 1930, to propagate the ''self-respect'' philosophy. Embarking on his journey from [[Nagapattinam]] with his wife Nagammal and his followers, E.V. Ramasamy was received by 50,000 [[Tamil Malaysians]] in [[Penang]]. During the same month, he inaugurated the Tamils Conference, convened by the Tamils Reformatory Sangam in [[Ipoh]], and then went to Singapore. In December 1931 he undertook a tour of Europe, accompanied by S. Ramanathan and Erode Ramu, to personally acquaint himself with their [[political systems]], [[social movements]], way of life, economic and [[social progress]] and administration of public bodies. He visited Egypt, Greece, Turkey, Russia, Germany, England, Spain, France and Portugal, staying in Russia for three months. On his return journey he halted at [[Ceylon]] and returned to India in November 1932.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-1.1555"/&gt;

The tour shaped the [[political ideology]] of E.V. Ramasamy to achieve the [[social concept]] of Self-Respect. The communist system obtained in Russia appealed to him as appropriately suited to deal with the social ills of the country. Thus, on [[socio-economic]] issues Periyar was [[Marxist]], but he did not advocate for abolishing [[private ownership]].&lt;ref&gt;Anita Diehl.(1977). E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India, Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. P.69.&lt;/ref&gt; Immediately after his return, E.V. Ramasamy, in alliance with the enthusiastic communist, M. Singaravelar, began to work out a [[socio-political]] scheme incorporating socialist and self-respect ideals. This marked a crucial stage of development in the ''Self-Respect Movement'' which got politicised and found its compatibility in Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-1.1555"/&gt;

===Opposition to Hindi===
{{Main article|Anti-Hindi agitations}}

In 1937, when [[Chakravarthi Rajagopalachari]] became the [[Chief Minister]] of [[Madras Presidency]], he introduced Hindi as a compulsory language of study in schools, thereby igniting a series of anti-Hindi agitations.&lt;ref name="Chatterjee-2"&gt;Chatterjee, ''Up Against Caste: Comparative study of Ambedkar and Periyar'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tamil nationalism|Tamil nationalists]], the Justice Party under Sir [[A. T. Panneerselvam]], and E.V. Ramasamy organised [[Anti-Hindi agitations|anti-Hindi protests]] in 1938 which ended with numerous arrests by the Rajaji government.&lt;ref name="Nalankilli"&gt;{{cite web|author=Nalankilli, Thanjai |title=History: A Chronology of Anti-Hindi Agitations in Tamil Nadu and What the Future Holds |work=Tamil Tribune |date=1 January 2003 |url=http://www.tamiltribune.com/03/0101-anti-hindi-agitation-history.html |accessdate=13 January 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100730075305/http://www.tamiltribune.com/03/0101-anti-hindi-agitation-history.html |archivedate=30 July 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the same year, the slogan "Tamil Nadu for Tamilians"&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-*"&gt;Saraswathi, S. ''Towards Self-Respect'', pp. 118 &amp; 119.&lt;/ref&gt; was first raised by E.V. Ramasamy in protest against the introduction of Hindi in schools. He explained that the introduction of Hindi was a dangerous mechanism used by the Aryans to infiltrate Dravidian culture.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-*"/&gt; He reasoned that the adoption of Hindi would make Tamils subordinate to the Hindi speaking [[North Indians]]. E.V. Ramasamy explained that Hindi would not only halt the progress of Tamil people, but would also completely destroy their culture and nullify the progressive ideas that had been successfully inculcated through Tamil in the recent decades.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cutting across party lines, [[South India]]n politicians rallied together in their opposition to Hindi.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.1"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 88 &amp; 89.&lt;/ref&gt; There were recurrent [[anti-Hindi agitations]] in 1948, 1952 and 1965.

===As President of the Justice Party (1938–1944)===
{{Main article|Justice Party (India)}}
A political party known as the ''South Indian Libertarian Federation'' (commonly referred to as ''Justice Party'') was founded in 1916, principally to oppose the economic and political power of the Brahmin groups. The party's goal was to render [[social justice]] to the non-Brahmin groups. To gain the support of the masses, non-Brahmin politicians began propagating an ideology of equality among non-Brahmin castes. Brahmanical priesthood and [[Varna (Hinduism)|Sanskritic social class-value hierarchy]] were blamed for the existence of [[Economic inequality|inequalities]] among non-Brahmin ''caste'' groups.&lt;ref name="Pandian-2"&gt;Pandian, ''Caste, Nationalism, and Ethnicity'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, when the government required that Hindi be taught in the school system, E.V. Ramasamy organised opposition to this policy through the ''Justice Party''. After 1937, the [[Dravidian movement]] derived considerable support from the student community. In later years, opposition to Hindi played a big role in the [[politics of Tamil Nadu]]. The fear of the Hindi language had its origin in the conflict between Brahmins and non-Brahmins. To the [[Tamil people|Tamils]], acceptance of Hindi in the school system was a form of bondage. When the ''Justice Party'' weakened in the absence of mass support, E.V. Ramasamy took over the leadership of the party after being jailed for opposing Hindi in 1939.&lt;ref name="Kandasamy-2"/&gt; Under his tutelage the party prospered, but the party's conservative members, most of whom were rich and educated, withdrew from active participation.&lt;ref name="Pandian-2"/&gt;

===Dravidar Kazhagam (1944–onwards)===
{{Main article|Dravidar Kazhagam}}

====Formation of the ''Dravidar Kazhagam''====
At a rally in 1944, Periyar, in his capacity as the leader of the Justice Party, declared that the party would henceforth be known as the ''[[Dravidar Kazhagam]]'', or "Dravidian Association". However, a few who disagreed with Periyar started a splinter group, claiming to be the original Justice Party. This party was led by veteran Justice Party leader [[P. T. Rajan]] and survived until 1957.

The ''Dravidar Kazhagam'' came to be well known among the urban communities and students. Villages were influenced by its message. Hindi, and ceremonies that had become associated with Brahmanical priesthood, were identified as alien symbols that should be eliminated from Tamil culture. Brahmins, who were regarded as the guardians of such symbols, came under verbal attack.&lt;ref name="Pandian"/&gt; From 1949 onwards, the ''Dravidar Kazhagam'' intensified social reformist work and put forward the fact that superstitions were the cause for the degeneration of Dravidians. The ''Dravidar Kazhagam'' vehemently fought for the abolition of untouchability amongst the ''[[Dalit]]s''. It also focused its attention on the [[women's rights|liberation of women]], [[female education|women's education]], willing marriage, widow marriage, [[orphanage]]s and mercy homes.&lt;ref name="ITLF"&gt;International Tamil Language Foundation, (2000).''Tirukkural/ The Handbok of Tamil Culture and Heritage''. ITLF: Chicago, p. 1346.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Split with Annadurai====
{{Main article|Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam}}

In 1949, E.V. Ramasamy's chief lieutenant, [[Conjeevaram Natarajan Annadurai]], established a separate association called the ''Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam'' (DMK), or Dravidian Progressive Federation.&lt;ref name="Pandian"/&gt; This was due to differences between the two, while Periyar advocated a separate independent Dravidian or Tamil state, Annadurai compromised with the Delhi government, at the same time claiming increased state independence.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Diehl.(1977). E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India, Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. P.29.&lt;/ref&gt; E.V. Ramasamy was convinced that individuals and movements that undertake the task of eradicating the social evils in the Indian sub-continent have to pursue the goal with devotion and dedication without deviating from the path and with uncompromising zeal. Thus, if they contest elections aiming to assume political power, they would lose vigour and sense of purpose. But among his followers, there were those who had a different view, wanting to enter into politics and have a share in running the government. They were looking for an opportunity to part with E.V. Ramasamy.{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Thus, when E.V. Ramasamy married Maniammai on 9 July 1948, they quit the ''Dravidar Kazhagam'', stating that E.V. Ramasamy married maniammayar who was daughter of kanagasabhai when he was 70 and she 32. Those who parted company with E.V. Ramasamy joined the DMK.&lt;ref name="periyar_tamilnation"/&gt; Though the DMK split from the ''Dravidar Kazhagam'', the organisation made efforts to carry on E.V. Ramasamy's Self-Respect Movement to villagers and urban students. The DMK advocated the thesis that the Tamil language was much richer than [[Sanskrit]] and [[Hindi]] in content, and thus was a key which opened the door to subjects to be learned.&lt;ref name="Pandian"/&gt; The ''Dravidar Kazhagam'' continued to counter Brahminism, Indo-Aryan propaganda, and uphold the Dravidians' right of [[self-determination]].&lt;ref name="Geetha"&gt;Geetha, V. and S.V. Rajadurai, (1987).''Towards a Non-Brahmin Millennium: From Iyothee Thass to Periyar''. M. Sen for SAMYA: Calcutta, p. 481.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Later years====
[[File:Periyar memorial Chennai.jpg|thumb|Periyar Thidal at Vepery, where Periyar's body was buried.]]
In 1956, despite warnings from [[P. Kakkan]], the President of the Tamil Nadu Congress Committee, Periyar organised a procession to the Marina to burn pictures of the Hindu God Rama.&lt;ref name="manyramayanas"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Diversity of a Narrative Tradition in South Asia, Chapter 9: E. V. Ramasami's Reading of the Ramayana| url=http://www.escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft3j49n8h7&amp;chunk.id=d0e9800&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=d0e9800&amp;brand=eschol| last=Richman| first=Paula| year=1991| publisher=University of California}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar was subsequently arrested and confined to prison.&lt;ref name="manyramayanas" /&gt;

The activities of Periyar continued when he went to Bangalore in 1958 to participate in the All India Official Language Conference. There he stressed the need to retain English as the Union Official Language instead of Hindi. Five years later, Periyar travelled to North India to advocate the eradication of the caste system. Nearing Periyar's last years, an award was given to him by the United Nations Educational Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO), and it was presented to him by the Union Education Minister, Triguna Sen in Madras (Chennai), on 27 June 1970. In his last meeting at [[T. Nagar|Thiagaraya Nagar]], Chennai on 19 December 1973, Periyar declared a call for action to gain social equality and a dignified way of life. On 24 December 1973, Periyar died at the age of 94.&lt;ref name="periyar_tamilnation"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tamilnation.org/hundredtamils/periyar.htm|title=One Hundred Tamils of the 20th Century – Periyar E. V. Ramaswamy|accessdate=17 January 2009 |publisher= TamilNation.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles and legacy==
Periyar spent over fifty years giving speeches, propagating the realisation that everyone is an equal citizen and the differences on the basis of caste and creed were man-made to keep the innocent and ignorant as underdogs in the society. Although Periyar's speeches were targeted towards the illiterate and more mundane masses, scores of educated people were also swayed.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-8"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', pp. 59 &amp; 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar viewed reasoning as a special tool. According to him, all were blessed with this tool, but very few used it. Thus Periyar used reasoning with respect to subjects of social interest in his presentations to his audiences.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-8"/&gt; Communal differences in [[Tamil people|Tamil society]] were considered by many to be deep-rooted features until Periyar came to the scene.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-15"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', pp. 45–49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rationalism===
{{Periyar}}
The bedrock of E.V. Ramasamy’s principles and the movements that he started was rationalism. He thought that an insignificant [[minority group|minority]] in society was [[Exploitation of labour|exploiting]] the [[majority]] and trying to keep it in a subordinate position forever. He wanted the exploited to sit up and think about their position, and use their reason to realise that they were being exploited by a handful of people. If they started thinking, they would realise that they were human beings like the rest, that birth did not and should not endow superiority over others and that they must awaken themselves and do everything possible to improve their own lot.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-8"/&gt;

Likewise, E.V. Ramasamy explained that wisdom lies in thinking and that the spear-head of thinking is rationalism. On [[Caste system in India|caste]], he stated that no other living being harms or degrades its own class. But man, said to be a [[rationality|rational]] living being, does these evils. The differences, hatred, enmity, degradation, poverty, and wickedness, now prevalent in the society are due to lack of wisdom and rationalism and not due to God or the cruelty of time. E.V. Ramasamy had written in his books and magazines dozens of times of various occasions that the British rule is better than self-rule&lt;ref name="Veeramani-1.2"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', p. 511.&lt;/ref&gt;

E.V. Ramasamy also blamed the capitalists for their control of machineries, creating difficulties for the workers. According to his philosophy, rationalism, which has to lead the way for peaceful life to all, had resulted in causing poverty and worries to the people because of dominating forces. He stated that there is no use of simply acquiring titles or amassing wealth if one has no self-respect or [[scientific knowledge]]. An example he gave was the West sending messages to the planets, while the [[Tamil people|Tamil society]] in India were sending rice and cereals to their dead forefathers through the Brahmins.&lt;ref name="Veeramani-1.2"/&gt;

In a message to the Brahmin community, Periyar stated, "in the name of god, religion, and sastras you have duped us. We were the ruling people. Stop this life of cheating us from this year. Give room for rationalism and humanism".&lt;ref name="Veeramani-1.3"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', p. 504.&lt;/ref&gt; He added that "any opposition not based on rationalism, science, or experience will one day or another, reveal the fraud, selfishness, lies and conspiracies".&lt;ref name="Veeramani-1.3"/&gt;

===Self-respect===
{{Main article|Self-Respect Movement}}

Periyar's philosophy of self-respect was based on his image of an ideal world and a universally accepted one. His philosophy preaches that human actions should be based on rational thinking. Further, the outcome of the natural instinct of human beings is to examine every object and every action and even nature with a spirit of inquiry, and to refuse to submit to anything irrational as equivalent to slavery. Thus, the philosophy of self-respect taught that human actions should be guided by reason, right and wrong should follow from [[rationality|rational]] thinking and conclusions drawn from reason should be respected under all circumstances. Freedom means respect to thoughts and actions considered 'right' by human beings on the basis of 'reason'. There is not much difference between 'freedom' and 'self-respect'.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.2"&gt;Saraswathi, S. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar's foremost appeal to people was to develop self-respect. He preached that the Brahmins had monopolised and cheated other communities for decades and deprived them of self-respect. He stated that most Brahmins claimed to belong to a "superior" community with the reserved privilege of being in charge of temples and performing [[archana (Hinduism)|archanas]]. He felt that they were trying to reassert their control over religion by using their superior caste status to claim the exclusive privilege to touch idols or enter the sanctum sanctorum.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-15"/&gt;

===Women’s rights===
{{Main article|Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and women's rights}}

As a [[rationalist]] and ardent social reformer, Periyar advocated forcefully throughout his life that women should be given their legitimate position in society as the equals of men and that they should be given good education and have the [[right to property]]. He thought age and social customs was not a bar in marrying women. He was keen that women should realise their rights and be worthy citizens of their country.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-14"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar fought against the orthodox traditions of marriage as suppression of women in Tamil Nadu and throughout the Indian sub-continent. Though [[arranged marriages]] were meant to enable a couple to live together throughout life, it was manipulated to [[oppress|enslave]] women.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.1"&gt;Veeramani, K., ''Periyar on Women's Rights'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; Much worse was the practice of child marriages practised throughout India at the time. It was believed that it would be a sin to marry after puberty.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.2"&gt;Veeramani, K., ''Periyar on Women's Rights'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Another practice, which is prevalent today, is the [[dowry|dowry system]] where the bride's family is supposed to give the husband a huge payment for the bride. The purpose of this was to assist the newly wedded couple financially, but in many instances dowries were misused by bridegrooms. The outcome of this abuse turned to the exploitation of the bride's parents wealth, and in certain circumstances, lead to [[dowry death]]s.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.3"&gt;Veeramani, K., ''Periyar on Women's Rights'', p. 65.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been hundreds of thousands of cases where wives have been murdered, mutilated, and burned alive because the father of the bride was unable to make the dowry payment to the husband. Periyar fiercely stood up against this abuse meted out against women.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.4"&gt;Veeramani, K., ''Periyar on Women's Rights'', p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in India also did not have rights to their families' or husbands' property. Periyar fought fiercely for this and also advocated for women to have the right to separate or divorce their husbands under reasonable circumstances.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.4"/&gt; While [[birth control]] remained taboo in society of Periyar's time, he advocated for it not only for the health of women and population control, but for the [[women's rights|liberation of women]].&lt;ref name="Veeramani-1.31"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

He criticised the hypocrisy of [[chastity]] for women and argued that it should either apply also to men, or not at all for both genders.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.5"&gt;Veeramani, K., ''Periyar on Women's Rights'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; While fighting against this, Periyar advocated getting rid of the [[Devadasi]] system. In his view it was an example of a list of degradations of women, attaching them to temples for the entertainment of others, and as temple prostitutes.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-14.1"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; Further, for the liberation of women, Periyar pushed for their right to have an education and to join the [[armed services]] and the police force.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.5"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1.7"&gt;Veeramani, K., ''Periyar on Women's Rights'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biographer M.D. Gopalakrishnan, Periyar and his movement achieved a better status for women in [[Tamil people|Tamil society]]. Periyar held that, in matters of education and employment, there should be no difference between men and women. Gopalakrishnan states that Periyar's influence in the [[State governments|State departments]] and even the Center made it possible for women to join police departments and the army. Periyar also spoke out against [[child marriage]].&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-15"/&gt;

===Social reform and eradication of caste===
{{Main article|Periyar E.V. Ramasamy and social reform|Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and the eradication of caste}}
Periyar wanted thinking people to see their society as far from perfect and in urgent need of reform. He wanted the government, the political parties and social workers to identify the evils in society and boldly adopt measures to remove them.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-12"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar's philosophy did not differentiate social and political service.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-2.1"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', pp. 164 &amp; 165.&lt;/ref&gt; According to him, the first duty of a government is to run the social organisation efficiently, and the philosophy of religion was to organise the social system. Periyar stated that while Christian and [[Islamic]] religions were fulfilling this role, the Hindu religion remained totally unsuitable for [[social progress]]. He argued that the government was not for the people, but, in a "topsy-turvy" manner, the people were for the government. He attributed this situation to the state of the [[social system]] contrived for the advantage of a small group of people.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-2.1"/&gt;

One of the areas of Periyar's focus was on the upliftment of rural communities. In a booklet called ''Village Uplift'', Periyar pleaded for rural reform. At that time rural India still formed the largest part of the Indian subcontinent, in spite of the ongoing process of urbanisation. Thus, the distinction between rural and urban had meant an economic and social degradation for rural inhabitants. Periyar wanted to eradicate the concept of "village" as a discrimination word among places, just as the concept of "outcast" among social groups. Periyar advocated for a location where neither the name nor the situation or its conditions imply differences among people.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Diehl.(1977). E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India, Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. P.68.&lt;/ref&gt; He further advocated for the modernisation of villages by providing public facilities such as schools, libraries, radio stations, roads, bus transport, and police stations.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-2.4"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar felt that a small number of cunning people created [[Caste in India|caste distinctions]] to dominate over society, so he emphasised that individuals must first develop self-respect and learn to analyse propositions rationally. According to Periyar, a self-respecting [[rationalist]] would readily realise that the caste system had been stifling self-respect and therefore he or she would strive to get rid of this menace.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-13"&gt;Gopalakrishnan, ''Periyar: Father of the Tamil race'', pp. 60 &amp; 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar stated that the caste system in South India is, due to Indo-Aryan influence, linked with the arrival of Brahmins from the [[North India|north]]. Ancient [[Tamil Nadu]] (part of [[Ancient Tamil country|Tamilakkam]]) had a different stratification of society in four or five regions (''Tinai''), determined by natural surroundings and adequate means of living.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Diehl.(1977). E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India, Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. P.61.&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar also argued that birds, animals, and worms, which are considered to be devoid of rationalism do not create castes, or differences of high and low in their own species. But man, considered to be a rational being, was suffering from these because of religion and discrimination.&lt;ref name="Veeramani-1.6"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', pp. 72 &amp; 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Samathuvapuram]] (Equality Village) social equality system introduced by the [[Government of Tamil Nadu]] in the late 1990s is named after Ramasamy.&lt;ref name="Muthiah2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=S. Muthiah|title=Madras, Chennai: A 400-year Record of the First City of Modern India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tbR_LLkqdI8C&amp;pg=PA357|year=2008|publisher=Palaniappa Brothers|isbn=978-81-8379-468-8|pages=357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tamil language and writing===
{{Main article|Periyar E. V. Ramasamy and Tamil grammar}}

Periyar claimed that [[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Malayalam language|Malayalam]], and [[Kannada language|Kannada]] came from the same mother language of [[Old Tamil#Old Tamil|Old Tamil]]. He explained that the Tamil language is called by four different names since it is spoken in four different Dravidian states. Nevertheless, current understanding of [[Dravidian languages]] contradicts such claims. For example, the currently known classification of [[Dravidian Languages#Classification|Dravidian languages]] provides the following distinct classes: Southern (including Tamil–Malayalam, Kannada and Tulu); Central (including Telugu–Kui and Kolami–Parji); and, Northern (including Kurukh–Malto and Brahui). 

With relation to writing, Periyar stated that using the Tamil script about the arts, which are useful to the people in their life and foster knowledge, talent and courage, and propagating them among the masses, will enlighten the people. Further, he explained that it will enrich the language, and thus it can be regarded as a zeal for Tamil.&lt;ref name="Veeramani-3"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', pp. 550–552.&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar also stated that if words of North Indian origin (Sanskrit) are removed from Telugu, Kannada, and Malayalam, only Tamil will be left. On the Brahmin usage of Tamil, he stated that the Tamil spoken by the [[Telugu people|Andhras]] and the [[Malayali|Malayali people]] was far better than the Tamil spoken by the Brahmins. Periyar believed that Tamil language will make the Dravidian people unite under the banner of Tamil culture, and that it will make the Kannadigas, Andhras and the Malayalees be vigilant. With regards to a Dravidian alliance under a common umbrella language, Periyar stated that "a time will come for unity. This will go on until there is an end to the North Indian domination. We shall reclaim an independent sovereign state for us".&lt;ref name="Veeramani-1"&gt;Veeramani, [January 1981](2005) ''Collected Works of Periyar E.V.R.'', Third Edition, Chennai. The Periyar Self-Respect Propaganda Institution, p. 503.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the same time, Periyar was also known to have made controversial remarks on the Tamil language and people from time to time. On one occasion, he referred to the Tamil people as "barbarians"&lt;ref name="periyar_antitamilremarks_thehindu"&gt;{{cite news|last=Raghavan |first=B.

Periyar's ideas on [[Tamil script|Tamil alphabet]] reforms included those such as the reasons for the vowel 'ஈ' (i) having a cursive and looped representation of the short form 'இ' (I).{{clarify|date=September 2011}} In [[vatteluttu|stone inscriptions]] from 400 or 500 years ago, many [[Tamil script|Tamil letters]] are found in other shapes. As a matter of necessity and advantage to cope with printing technology, Periyar thought that it was sensible to change a few letters, reduce the number of letters, and alter a few signs. He further explained that the older and more divine a language and its letters were said to be, the more they needed reform. Because of changes brought about by means of modern transport and international contact, and happenings that have attracted words and products from many countries, foreign words and their pronunciations have been assimilated into Tamil quite easily. Just as a few compound characters have separate signs to indicate their length as in ' கா ', ' கே ' (kA:, kE:), Periyar questioned why other compound characters like ' கி ', ' கீ ', 'கு ', ' கூ ' (kI, ki:, kU, ku:) (indicated integrally as of now), shouldn't also have separate signs. Further, changing the shape of letters, creating new symbols and adding new letters and similarly, dropping those that are redundant, were quite essential according to Periyar. Thus, the glory and excellence of a language and its script depend on how easily they can be understood or learned and on nothing else"&lt;ref name="Anita Diehl 1977"/&gt;

===Thoughts on Thirukkural===
{{Main article|Thirukkural}}

Periyar hailed the ''Thirukkural'' as a valuable scripture which contained many scientific and philosophical truths. He also praised the secular nature of the work. Periyar praised [[Thiruvalluvar]] for his description of God as a formless entity with only positive attributes. He also suggested that one who reads the Thirukkural will become a [[Self-respect]]er, absorbing knowledge in politics, society, and economics. According to him, though certain items in this ancient book of ethics may not relate to today, it permitted such changes for modern society.&lt;ref name="Veeramani-7"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', pp. 505–508.&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Caste in India|caste]], he believed that the Kural illustrates how [[Vedic]] laws of [[Manu (Hinduism)|Manu]] were against the [[Shudra|Sudras]] and other communities of the Dravidian race. On the other hand, Periyar opined that the ethics from the Kural was comparable to the Christian Bible. The Dravidar Kazhagam adopted the Thirukkural and advocated that Thiruvalluvar's Kural alone was enough to educate the people of the country.&lt;ref name="Veeramani-7"/&gt;
One of Periyar's quotes on the Thirukkural from Veeramani's ''Collected Works of Periyar'' was "when Dravida Nadu (Dravidistan) was a victim to Indo-Aryan deceit, Thirukkural was written by a great Dravidian Thiruvalluvar to free the Dravidians".&lt;ref name="Veeramani-7"/&gt;

Periyar also asserted that due to the secular nature of Thirukkural, it has the capacity to be the common book of faith for all humanity and can be kept on par or above the holy books of all religions. This was rejected by Muslim scholars of the day.

===Self-determination of Dravida Nadu===
{{Main article|Dravida Nadu}}
[[File:Periyar with Jinnah and Ambedkar.JPG|thumb|350px|Periyar with [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] and [[B. R. Ambedkar]]]]
The Dravidian-Aryan conflict was believed to be a continuous historical phenomenon that started when the Aryans first set their foot in the Dravidian lands. Even a decade before the idea of separation appeared, Periyar stated that, "as long as [[Proto-Indo-European religion|Aryan religion]], Indo-Aryan domination, propagation of Aryan [[Vedas]] and Aryan "Varnashrama" existed, there was need for a "Dravidian Progressive Movement" and a "Self-Respect Movement".&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.4"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', pp. 89 &amp; 90.&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar became very concerned about the growing North Indian domination over the south which appeared to him no different from foreign domination. He wanted to secure the fruits of labour of the Dravidians to the Dravidians, and lamented that fields such as political, economic, industrial, social, art, and spiritual were dominated by the north for the benefit of the North Indians. Thus, with the approach of independence from Britain, this fear that [[North India]] would take the place of Britain to dominate [[South India]] became more and more intense.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.5"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar was clear about the concept of a separate nation, comprising [[Tamil Nadu|Tamil]] areas, that is part of the then existing Madras Presidency with adjoining areas into a federation guaranteeing [[wikt:protection|protection]] of [[minorities]], including religious, linguistic, and cultural freedom of the people. A separatist conference was held in June 1940 at Kanchipuram when Periyar released the map of the proposed ''Dravida Nadu'', but failed to get British approval. On the contrary, Periyar received sympathy and support from people such as [[B.R. Ambedkar|Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar]] and [[M.A. Jinnah|Muhammad Ali Jinnah]] for his views on the Congress, and for his opposition to Hindi. They then decided to convene a movement to resist the Congress.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of Modern India|author=Dirks, Nicholas B.|year=2001|publisher=Princeton University Press|pages=263|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lekITKy2rd4C|isbn=978-0-691-08895-2|accessdate=4 January 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130529060745/http://books.google.com/books?id=lekITKy2rd4C|archivedate=29 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of ''Dravida Nadu'' was later modified down to Tamil Nadu.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.92"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; This led to a proposal for a union of the Tamil people of not only [[South India]] but including those of Ceylon as well.&lt;ref&gt;Ghurye, G.S., (1961). ''Caste, Class, and Occupation''. Popular Book Depot: Bombay, p. 318.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Periyar helped to preserve Madras as the capital of Tamil Nadu, which later was the name he substituted for the more general Dravida Nadu.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Diehl.(1977). E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India, Scandinavian University Books: Sweden, p.76.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955 Periyar threatened to burn the national flag, but on Chief Minister Kamaraj's pledge that Hindi should not be made compulsory, he postponed the action.&lt;ref name="Anita Diehl 1977"/&gt; In his speech of 1957 called ''Suthantara Tamil Nadu En?'' (Why an independent Tamil Nadu?), he criticised the Central Government of India, inducing thousands of Tamilians to burn the constitution of India. The reason for this action was that Periyar held the Government responsible for maintaining the caste system. After stating reasons for separation and turning down opinions against it, he closed his speech with a "war cry" to join and burn the map of India on 5 June. Periyar was sentenced to six months imprisonment for burning the Indian constitution.&lt;ref name="Diehl-14"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diehl| first = Anita | title = ''E. V.

Advocacy of such a nation became illegal when [[separatist]] demands were banned by law in 1957. Regardless of these measures, a ''Dravida Nadu Separation Day'' was observed on 17 September 1960 resulting in numerous arrests.&lt;ref&gt;Bhaskaran, R., (1967). ''Sociology of Politics: Tradition of politics in India''. Asia Publishing House: New York, p. 48.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Periyar resumed his campaign in 1968. He wrote an editorial on 'Tamil Nadu for Tamilians' in which he stated, that by nationalism only Brahmins had prospered and nationalism had been developed to abolish the rights of [[Tamil people|Tamils]]. He advocated that there was need to establish a ''Tamil Nadu Freedom Organization'' and that it was necessary to work towards it.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.93"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anti-Brahmanism vs. Anti-Brahmin===
[[File:B.Shyam Sunder, EVR,Fareedi and Bhadat anand Kaushlya, 1968 at Lucknow.jpg|thumb|B.Shyam Sunder, EVR, Fareedi and Bhadat anand Kaushlya, 1968 at Lucknow]]

Periyar was a radical advocate of [[anti-Brahmanism]]. Periyar's ideology of anti-Brahmanism is quite often confused as being anti-Brahmin. Even a non-Brahmin who supports inequality based on caste was seen as a supporter of brahmanism. Periyar called on both Brahmins and non-Brahmins to shun brahmanism.

In 1920, when the Justice Party came to power, Brahmins occupied about 70 percent&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Tehelka&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tehelka.com/story_main17.asp?filename=Ne042206superiority.asp |title= Superiority in Numbers |accessdate= 6 August 2008 |year= 2006 |publisher= Tehelka – The People's Paper |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://archive.is/20120918002111/http://www.tehelka.com/story_main17.asp?filename=Ne042206superiority.asp |archivedate= 18 September 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the high level posts in the government. After reservation was introduced by the Justice Party, it reversed this trend, allowing non-Brahmins to rise in the government of the Madras Presidency.&lt;ref name=Tehelka/&gt; Periyar, through the Justice Party, advocated against the imbalance of the domination of Brahmins who constituted only 3 percent&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-22"/&gt;&lt;ref name=ColumbiaUniv-1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~as48/India%20and%20the%20Tamils.pdf |format=PDF |title=India and the Tamils |accessdate=6 September 2008 |year=2006 |publisher=Columbia University |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218182327/http://www.columbia.edu/~as48/India%20and%20the%20Tamils.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the population, over [[government jobs]], [[judiciary]] and the Madras University.&lt;ref name=ColumbiaUniv-1/&gt; His Self-Respect Movement espoused rationalism and [[atheism]] and the movement had currents of [[anti-Brahminism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Dalit Visions: The Anti-caste Movement and the Construction on an Indian Identity|author=Omvedt, Gail|year=2006|publisher=Orient Longman|page=95|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kCwpXZlKqL0C|isbn=978-81-250-2895-6|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Periyar stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Our [[Dravidian movement]] does not exist against the Brahmins or the Banias (a North Indian [[merchant]] [[Caste in India|caste]]). If anyone thinks so, I would only pity him. But we will not tolerate the ways in which Brahminism and the Bandiaism {{clarify|date=May 2018}} is degrading Dravidanadu. Whatever support they may have from the government, neither myself nor my movement will be of cowardice".&lt;ref name="Veeramani-6"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', p. 495.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gnanarajasekharan&gt;{{cite web |author=Rajasekharan, Gnana |title='Periyar was against Brahminism, not Brahmins' |publisher=Rediff News |date=30 April 2007 |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/apr/30inter.htm |accessdate=16 December 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090227004725/http://www.rediff.com/news/2007/apr/30inter.htm |archivedate=27 February 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Periyar also criticised [[Subramanya Bharathi]] in the journal ''Ticutar'' for portraying Mother Tamil as a sister of Sanskrit in his poems:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"They say Bharati is an immortal poet.…Even if a rat dies in an akrakāram, they would declare it to be immortal. … of Tamilnadu praises him. Why should this be so? Supposedly because he sang fulsome praises of Tamil and Tamilnadu. What else could he sing? His own mother tongue, Sanskrit, has been dead for years. What other language did he know? He cannot sing in Sanskrit. … He says Tamilnadu is the land of Aryas."&lt;ref name="passionsofthetongue"&gt;{{cite book|title=Passions of the Tongue:Language Devotion in Tamil Nadu, 1891–1970|first=Sumathi|last=Ramaswamy|year=1997|publisher=University of California|url=http://escholarship.org/editions/view?docId=ft5199n9v7&amp;chunk.id=s1.5.24&amp;toc.depth=1&amp;toc.id=ch5&amp;brand=ucpress}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Comparisons with Gandhi===
In the [[Vaikom Satyagraha]] of 1924, Periyar and Gandhi ji both cooperated and confronted each other in [[socio-political]] action. Periyar and his followers emphasised the difference in point of view between Gandhi and himself on the [[social issues]], such as fighting the Untouchability Laws and eradication of the caste system.

According to the booklet "Gandhi and Periyar", Periyar wrote in his paper ''Kudi Arasu'' in 1925, reporting on the fact that Gandhi was ousted from the [[Akhil Bharatiya Hindu Mahasabha|Mahasabha]] because he opposed resolutions for the maintaining of caste and Untouchability Laws which would spoil his efforts to bring about Hindu-Muslim unity. From this, Gandhi learned the need for pleasing the Brahmins if anything was to be achieved.&lt;ref name="Diehl-17"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diehl| first = Anita | title = ''E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India'' | year = 1977| pages = 86–88| publisher = Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. {{ISBN|91-24-27645-6}}. | isbn = 91-24-27645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Peiryar in his references to Gandhi used opportunities to present Gandhi as, on principle, serving the interests of the Brahmins. In 1927, Periyar and Gandhi met at [[Bangalore]] to discuss this matter. The main difference between them came out when Periyar stood for the total eradication of Hinduism to which Gandhi objected saying that Hinduism is not fixed in doctrines but can be changed. In the ''Kudi Arasu'', Periyar explained that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"With all his good qualities, Gandhi did not bring the people forward from foolish and evil ways. His murderer was an educated man. Therefore nobody can say this is a time of high culture. If you eat poison, you will die. If electricity hits the body, you will die. If you oppose the Brahmin, you will die. Gandhi did not advocate the eradication of [[Varnasrama]] ''Dharma'' structure, but sees in it a task for the humanisation of society and social change possible within its structure. The consequence of this would be continued high-caste leadership. Gandhi adapted Brahmins to social change without depriving them of their leadership".&lt;ref name="Diehl-17"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gandhi accepted ''karma'' in the sense that "the ''Untouchables'' reap the reward of their ''karma'',&lt;ref name="Diehl-17"/&gt; but was against discrimination against them using the revaluing term ''Harijans''. As shown in the negotiations at Vaikom his methods for abolishing discrimination were: to stress on the [[Orthodoxy|orthodox]], [[inhumane]] treatment of ''Untouchables''; to secure voluntary lifting of the ban by changing the hearts of caste Hindus; and to work within a Hindu framework of ideas.&lt;ref name="Diehl-17"/&gt;

On the Temple Entry issue, Gandhi never advocated the opening of ''Garbha Griha'' to ''Harijans'' in consequence of his Hindu belief. These sources which can be labelled "pro-Periyar" with the exception of M. Mahar and D.S. Sharma, clearly show that Periyar and his followers emphasised that Periyar was the real fighter for the removal of Untouchability and the true upliftment of Hairjans, whereas Gandhi was not. This did not prevent Periyar from having faith in Gandhi on certain matters.&lt;ref name="Diehl-17"/&gt;

===Religion and atheism===
{{Main article|Religious views of Periyar E. V. Ramasamy}}

Periyar was generally regarded as a [[pragmatism|pragmatic]] propagandist who attacked the evils of religious influence on society, mainly what he regarded as Brahmin domination. At a young age, he felt that some people used religion only as a mask to deceive innocent people and considered it as his life's mission to warn people against superstitions and priests.&lt;ref name="Veeramani2-1"/&gt; Anita Diehl explains that Periyar cannot be called an atheist philosopher. Periyar, however, qualified for the definition of what the term 'atheist' implies in his address on philosophy. He repudiated the term as without real sense: "…the talk of the atheist should be considered thoughtless and erroneous. The thing I call god... that makes all people equal and free, the god that does not stop free thinking and research, the god that does not ask for money, flattery and temples can certainly be an object of worship. For saying this much I have been called an atheist, a term that has no meaning". EVR Periyar, a born Hindu, was vehemently opposed to Hinduism and Christianity. He did not criticize Islam.&lt;ref name="Anita Diehl 1977"/&gt;

Anita Diehl explains that Periyar was against incompatibility of faith with social equality and not religion itself.&lt;ref name="Diehl-16"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diehl| first = Anita | title = ''E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India'' | page = 16 | year = 1977| publisher = Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. {{ISBN|91-24-27645-6}}. | isbn = 91-24-27645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a book on revolution published in 1961, Periyar stated, "be of help to people. Do not use treachery or deceit. Speak the truth and do not cheat. That indeed is service to God".&lt;ref name="Diehl-15"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diehl| first = Anita | title = ''E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India'' | page = 58 | year = 1977| publisher = Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. {{ISBN|91-24-27645-6}}. | isbn = 91-24-27645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Hinduism, Periyar believed that it was a religion with no distinctive sacred book (bhagawad gita) or origins, but an imaginary faith preaching the "superiority" of the Brahmins, the inferiority of the Shudras, and the untouchability of the Dalits (Panchamas).&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-*"/&gt; [[Maria Misra]], a lecturer at Oxford University, compares him to the [[philosophe]]s, by stating, "his contemptuous attitude to the baleful influence of Hinduism in Indian public life is strikingly akin to the anti-[[Catholic]] [[diatribes (rhetoric)|diatribes]] of the [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] philosophes".&lt;ref name="Misra-3"&gt;Misra, Maria, ''Vishnu's crowded temple, India since the great rebellion'', p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1955, Periyar was arrested for his public agitation of burning the pictures of [[Rama]] at public places, as a symbolic protest against the Indo-Aryan domination and [[wikt:degradation|degradation]] of the Dravidian leadership according to the [[Ramayana]] epic.&lt;ref name="Periyar-2"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.periyar.org/html/ap_bios_eng4.asp|title= About Periyar: A Biographical Sketch From 1950 to 1972|accessdate= 30 November 2008|publisher= Dravidar Kazhagam|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081226073013/http://www.periyar.org/html/ap_bios_eng4.asp|archivedate= 26 December 2008|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Periyar also shoed the images of [[Krishna]] and Rama, stating that they were Aryan gods that considered the Dravidian Shudras to be "sons of prostitutes".&lt;ref name="Veeramani-7.5"&gt;Veeramani, ''Collected Works of Periyar'', pp. 218 &amp; 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

Periyar openly suggested to those who were [[marginalised]] within the Hindu [[communities]] to consider [[converting]] to other faiths such as [[Islam]], Christianity, or [[Buddhism]]. On Islam, he stated how it was good for abolishing the disgrace in human relationship, based on one of his speeches to railway employees at [[Tiruchirapalli]] in 1947. Periyar also commended Islam for its belief in one invisible and formless God; proclamation of equal rights for men and women; and advocating of social unity.&lt;ref name="Diehl6"&gt;{{cite book | last = Diehl| first = Anita | title = ''E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India'' | page = 52 | year = 1977| publisher = Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. {{ISBN|91-24-27645-6}}. | isbn = 91-24-27645-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the rally in Tiruchi, Periyar said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Muslims are following the ancient philosophies of the Dravidians. The Arabic word for Dravidian religion is Islam. When Brahmanism was imposed in this country, it was Mohammad Nabi who opposed it, by instilling the Dravidian religion's policies as Islam in the minds of the people"&lt;ref name="muslimidentityp164"&gt;{{cite book|title=Muslim Identity, Print Culture, and the Dravidian Factor in Tamil Nadu|pages=164|first=J. B. Prashant|last=More|publisher=[[Orient Blackswan]]|year=2004|isbn=978-81-250-2632-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Periyar viewed Christianity similar to the [[monotheistic]] faith of Islam. He explained that their faith says that there can be only one God which has no name or shape. Periyar took an interest in Rev. [[Martin Luther]], where both he and his followers wanted to liken him and his role to that of the European [[Protestant Reformers|reformer]]. Thus, Christian views such as that of [[Ram Mohan Roy]]'s ''The Precepts of Jesus'' has had at least an indirect influence on Periyar.&lt;ref&gt;Anita Diehl.(1977). E. V. Ramaswami Naicker-Periar: A study of the influence of a personality in contemporary South India, Scandinavian University Books: Sweden. P.92.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apart from Islam and Christianity, Periyar also found in Buddhism a basis for his philosophy though he did not accept that religion. It was again an alternative in the search for self-respect and the object was to get [[liberty|liberation]] from the discrimination of Hinduism.&lt;ref name="Saraswathi-3.9"&gt;Saraswathi. ''Towards Self-Respect'', p. 125.&lt;/ref&gt; Through Periyar's movement, ''Temple Entry Acts'' of 1924, 1931, and up to 1950 were created for the non-Brahmins. Another accomplishment took place during the 1970s when Tamil replaced Sanskrit as the temple language in Tamil Nadu, while Dalits were finally eligible for [[priesthood]].&lt;ref name="Anita Diehl 1977"/&gt;

===Controversies===

====Factionism in the Justice Party====
{{see also|Justice Party (India)}}

When B. Munuswamy Naidu became the Chief Minister of Madras Presidency in 1930, he endorsed the inclusion of Brahmins in the Justice Party, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;So long as we exclude one community, we cannot as a political speak on behalf of, or claim to represent all the people of our presidency. If, as we hope, provincial autonomy is given to the provinces as a result of the reforms that may be granted, it should be essential that our Federation should be in a position to claim to be a truly representative body of all communities. What objection can there be to admit such Brahmins as are willing to subscribe to the aims and objects of our Federation? It may be that the Brahmins may not join even if the ban is removed. But surely our Federation will not thereafter be open to objection on the ground that it is an exclusive organisation.&lt;ref name="encyclopediapoliticalparties1"&gt;Encyclopedia of political parties p.166&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Though certain members supported the resolution, a faction in the Justice Party known as the "Ginger Group" opposed the resolution and eventually voted it down. Periyar, who was then an observer in the Justice Party, criticised Munuswamy Naidu, saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At a time when non-Brahmins in other parties were gradually coming over to the Justice Party, being fed up with the Brahmin's methods and ways of dealing with political questions, it was nothing short of folly to think of admitting him into the ranks of the Justice Party.&lt;ref name="encyclopediapoliticalparties"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This factionism continued until 1932 when Munuswamy Naidu stepped down as the Chief Minister of Madras and the [[Ramakrishna Ranga Rao|Raja of Bobbili]] became the chief minister.&lt;ref name="encyclopediapoliticalparties"&gt;Encyclopedia of Political Parties p. 197&lt;/ref&gt;

==Followers and influence==
[[File:Periyar funeral.jpg|thumb|left|290px|MGR paying respects to Periyar's mortal remains]]

After the death of Periyar in 1973, conferences were held throughout Tamil Nadu for a week in January 1974. The same year Periyar's wife, Maniyammai, the new head of the ''Dravidar Kazhagam'', set fire to the [[effigies]] of '[[Rama]]', '[[Sita]]' and '[[Lakshmana]]' at Periyar Thidal, Madras. This was in retaliation to the ''Ramaleela'' celebrations where effigies of '[[Ravana]]', '[[Kumbakarna]]' and '[[Indrajit]]' were burnt in New Delhi. For this act she was imprisoned. During the 1974 May Day meetings held at different places in Tamil Nadu, a resolution urging the Government to preserve 80 percent&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-22"/&gt; of jobs for [[Tamil people|Tamils]] was passed. Soon after this, a camp was held at Periyar Mansion in [[Tiruchirapalli]] to train young men and women to spread the ideals of the ''Dravidar Kazhagam'' in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-22"/&gt;

On Periyar's birthday on 17 September 1974, Periyar's ''Rationalist Library'' and ''Research Library'' and ''Research Institute'' was opened by the then Tamil Nadu Chief Minister M. Karunanidhi. This library contained Periyar's [[rationalist]] works, the [[manuscripts]] of Periyar and his recorded speeches.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-13"/&gt; Also during the same year Periyar's ancestral home in Erode, was dedicated as a commemoration building. On 20 February 1977, the opening function of ''Periyar Building'' in Madras was held. At the meeting which the Managing Committee of the ''Dravidar Kazhagam'' held, there on that day, it was decided to support the candidates belonging to the ''Janata Party'', the ''Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam'' (DMK), and the ''Marxist Party'' during the General Elections.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-22"/&gt;

On 16 March 1978, Maniyammai died. The ''Managing Committee of the Dravidar Kazhagam'' elected [[K. Veeramani]] as General Secretary of the ''Dravidar Kazhagam'' on 17 March 1978. From then on, the ''Periyar-Maniyammai Educational and Charitable Society'' started the ''Periyar Centenary Women's Polytechnic'' at [[Thanjavur]] on 21 September 1980. On 8 May 1982, the ''College for Correspondence Education'' was started under the auspices of the ''Periyar Rationalist Propaganda Organization''.&lt;ref name="Gopalakrishnan-22"/&gt;

Over the years, Periyar influenced Tamil Nadu's political party heads such as [[C.N. Annadurai]]&lt;ref name="periyar_tamilnation"/&gt; and [[M.

'''Phanes''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|eɪ|ˌ|n|iː|z}} ({{lang-grc|Φάνης}}, genitive Φάνητος) or '''Protogonus''' {{IPAc-en|p|r|oʊ|ˈ|t|ɒ|ɡ|ə|n|ə|s}} ([[Ancient Greek|Greek]]: Πρωτογόνος, "first-born") was the mystic primeval [[deity]] of procreation and the generation of new life, who was introduced into [[Greek mythology]] by the [[Orphics|Orphic tradition]]; other names for this [[Classical Greece|Classical Greek]] Orphic concept included '''Ericapaeus''' {{IPAc-en|ˌ|ɛ|r|ᵻ|k|ə|ˈ|p|iː|ə|s}} ({{lang|grc|Ἠρικαπαῖος or Ἠρικεπαῖος}} "power") and '''[[Metis (mythology)|Metis]]''' ("thought").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Taylor |date=1824 |title=The Mystical Hymns of Orpheus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MNEIAAAAQAAJ |edition=Second |publisher= Chiswick |page=XV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mythology ==
In these myths Phanes is often equated with [[Eros (god)|Eros]] and [[Mithras]] and has been depicted as a deity emerging from a [[cosmic egg]], entwined with a [[serpent (symbolism)|serpent]]. He had a helmet and had broad, golden wings. The Orphic cosmogony is bizarre, and quite unlike the creation sagas offered by [[Homer]] and [[Hesiod]]. Scholars have suggested that Orphism is "un-Greek" even "Asiatic" in conception, because of its inherent [[dualistic cosmology|dualism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Jeffrey Burton Russell | date=1987 | title=The Devil: Perceptions of Evil from Antiquity to Primitive Christianity | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=D2-Na937xRYC | publisher=Cornell University Press | page=137 | isbn=0-8014-9409-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chronos (Time) created the silver egg of the universe; out of this egg burst the first-born, Phanes. Phanes was a [[Unity of opposites|uroboric male-female]] deity of light and goodness, whose name means "to bring light" or "to shine"; a first-born god of light who emerges from a void or a watery abyss and gives birth to the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author=Liz Greene |date=2000 |title=The Astrological Neptune and the Quest for Redemption |url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1609253841 |publisher=Weiser Books |pages=78–79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many threads of earlier myths are apparent in the new tradition. Phanes was believed to have been hatched from the [[World-Egg]] of [[Chronos]] (Time) and [[Ananke (mythology)|Ananke]] (Necessity or Fate) or Nyx in the black bird form and wind. His older wife [[Nyx (mythology)|Nyx]] (Night) called him Protogenus. As she created nighttime, he created daytime. He also created the method of creation by mingling. He was made the ruler of the deities and passed the [[sceptre]] to Nyx. This new Orphic tradition states that Nyx later gave the sceptre to her son [[Uranus (mythology)|Uranos]] before it passed to [[Cronus]] and then to Zeus, who retained it.

According to Aristophanes, whence he is called Eros, he was born from an egg created by Nyx and placed in the boundless lap of [[Erebus]], after which he mates with [[Chaos (mythology)|Chaos]] and creates the birds.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristophanes]], ''[[The Birds (play)|The Birds]]'' 690–702&lt;/ref&gt; This passage seeks to demonstrate that the birds are considered older than all other living creatures, even older than the other gods.

The "Protogonos Theogony" is known through the commentary in the [[Derveni papyrus]] and references in [[Empedocles]] and [[Pindar]].

According to [[Damascius]], Phanes was the first god "expressible and acceptable to human ears" (πρώτης ητόν τι ἐχούσης καὶ σύμμετρον πρὸς ἀνθρώπων ἀκοάς).&lt;ref&gt;Cf. B. 75–80, K. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

Another orphic hymn states:&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 6; trans. Athanassakis 1977&lt;/ref&gt; "You scattered the dark mist that lay before your eyes and, flapping your wings, you whirled about, and throughout this world you brought pure light. For this I call you Phanes." ("ὄσσων ὃς σκοτόεσσαν ἀπημαύρωσας ὁμίχλην πάντη δινηθεὶς πτερύγων ῥιπαῖς κατὰ κόσμον λαμπρὸν ἄγων φάος ἁγνόν , ἀφ ' οὗ σε Φάνητα κικλήσκω.")

The [[Derveni Papyrus]] refers to Phanes: "Of the First-born king, the neverend&lt;ref&gt;http://www.greek-language.gr/greekLang/modern_greek/tools/lexica/search.html?lq=%CE%B1%CE%90%CE%B4%CE%B9%CE%BF%CF%82&amp;sin=all&lt;/ref&gt; one; and upon him all the immortals grew, blessed gods and goddesses and rivers and lovely springs and everything else that had then been born; and he himself became the sole one".&lt;ref&gt;Kouremenos, Parássoglou, and Tsantsanoglou 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ("Πρωτογόνου βασιλέως αἰδοίου∙ τῶι δ’ ἄρα πάντες ἀθάνατοι προσέφυν μάκαρες θεοὶ ἠδ̣ὲ θέαιναι καὶ ποταμοὶ καὶ κρῆναι ἐπήρατιο ἄλλα τε πάντα , ἅ̣σσα τότ’ ἦγγεγαῶτ ’ , αὐτὸς δ’ ἄρα μοῦνος ἔγεντο.”)

[[Dionysus]] of the Orphic tradition is intimately connected to Protogonos. In the Orphic Hymn 30, he is given a list of epithets that also allude to Protogonos: "πρωτόγονον, διφυῆ, τρίγονον, Βακχεῖον ἄνακτα,ἄγριον, ἄρρητον, κρύφιον, δικέρωτα, δίμορφον" – "Primeval, two-natured, thrice-born, Bacchic lord, savage, ineffable, secretive, two-horned, and two-shaped".&lt;ref&gt;Orphic Hymn 30 Trans. Athanassakis 1977, 43&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Orphic tradition, Dionysus-Protogonos-Phanes is a dying and rising god. [[Eusebius]] tells us the story of his death and recreation. The [[Titan (mythology)|Titans]] boil the dismembered limbs of Dionysus in a kettle, they roast him on a spit and eat the roasted "sacrificial meat", then [[Athena]] rescues the still-beating heart&lt;ref&gt;Euseb. Praep. ev. 2.3.25 (K. 35)&lt;/ref&gt; from which (according to [[Olympiodorus the Younger|Olympiodorus]])&lt;ref&gt;Olympiod. in Plat. Phaedon. 2.21 (K. 220)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zeus]] is able to recreate the god and bring him back to life. Kessler has argued that this cult of death and resurrection of Dionysus developed the 4th century CE; and together with [[Mithraism]] and other sects this cult formed, were in direct competition with [[Early Christianity]] during [[Late Antiquity]].&lt;ref&gt;E. Kessler, ''Dionysian Monotheism in Nea Paphos, Cyprus'' Symposium on ''Pagan Monotheism in the Roman Empire'', Exeter, 17–20 July 2006 [http://www.huss.ex.ac.uk/classics/conferences/pagan_monotheism/abstracts.html Abstract] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032154/http://www.huss.ex.ac.uk/classics/conferences/pagan_monotheism/abstracts.html |date=2008-04-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Popé''' or '''Po'pay'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|p|oʊ|p|eɪ}}; c. 1630 – c. 1688) was a [[Tewa people|Tewa]] [[religious]] leader from [[Ohkay Owingeh]] (renamed San Juan Pueblo by the Spanish during the colonial period), who led the [[Pueblo Revolt]] in 1680 against [[Spain|Spanish]] colonial rule. In the first successful revolt against the Spanish, the Pueblo expelled the colonists and kept them out of the territory for twelve years.

==Background==

Spanish rule of the [[Pueblo Indians]] of the [[Rio Grande River|Rio Grande]] valley of [[New Mexico]] began in 1598.  Although they numbered 40,000 to 80,000 people at that time, the many independent towns, often speaking different languages and hostile to each other, were unable to unite in opposition to the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Frank, Ross, "Demographic, Social, and Economic Change in New Mexico," in ''New Views of Borderland History'', ed. by Robert H. Jackson.  Albuquerque: U of NM Press, 1998, 43-44&lt;/ref&gt;  Revolts against Spanish rule were frequent, but the Spanish ruthlessly repressed dissent.  The Pueblo suffered abuses from Spanish overlords, soldiers, priests, and their Mexican Indian allies, many from [[Tlaxcala (Nahua state)|Tlaxcala, Mexico]].  In particular, the Spanish suppressed the religious ceremonies of the Pueblo.  The effects of violence, forced labor, and European diseases (against which they had no immunity) reduced the Pueblo population to about 15,000 by the latter years of the 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, Carroll L. ''Rio del Norte,'' Salt Lake City: U of Utah Press, 1994, 266&lt;/ref&gt;

Po'pay appears in history in 1675 as one of 47 religious leaders of the northern Pueblo arrested by the [[Juan Francisco Trevino]]'s government for "witchcraft."  Three were executed and one committed suicide. The others were whipped, imprisoned in [[Santa Fe, New Mexico|Santa Fe]], and sentenced to be sold into [[slavery]].  Seventy Pueblo warriors showed up at the governor's office and demanded, politely but persistently, that Po'pay and the others be released.  The governor complied, probably in part because the colony was being seriously targeted by [[Apache]]s and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] warring parties and he could not afford to risk a Pueblo revolt.&lt;ref&gt;John, Elizabeth A. H., ''Storms Brewed in Other Men's Worlds'', Lincoln: U of Neb Press, 1975, 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  Po'pay was described as a "fierce and dynamic individual…who inspired respect bordering on fear in those who dealt with him.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, Priscilla, "[http://www.lourdes.edu/Portals/O/Files/History/Online_Narrative_History/ONH/Pope.PDF Pope: the Man behind the Legend]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}," University of Lourdes, accessed May 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

After his release, Po'pay retired to the remote [[Taos Pueblo]] and began planning a rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Ponce, Pedro, "[http://www.neh.gov/news/humanities/2002-11/pueblorevolt.html Trouble for the Spanish: The Pueblo Revolt of 1680]", accessed Apr 14, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Po'pay's message was simple: destroy the Spanish and their influence and go back to the old ways of life that had given the Pueblos relative peace, prosperity, and independence.  The Pueblo revolt displayed "all the classic characteristics of a revitalization movement...the emergence of a charismatic leader, the development of a core group of followers who spread the prophet's message to the wider public; and, ultimately the successful transformation of Pueblo cultures and communities."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1111/j.1548-1433.2008.00045.x | volume=110 | title=The Innovative Materiality of Revitalization Movements: Lessons from the Pueblo Revolt of 1680 | year=2008 | journal=American Anthropologist | pages=360–372 | last1 = Liebmann | first1 = Matthew| url=https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3693474/Liebmann--AA%20final.pdf?sequence=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Po'pay began secret negotiations with leaders from all other pueblos. They agreed to begin the revolt on August 13, 1680 and runners were sent out to each Pueblo with knotted cords, the number of knots corresponding to the days left before the revolt was to begin.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, 6&lt;/ref&gt;  The revolt actually began before that.  The measure of the Pueblo's hatred of the Spanish is indicated by the fact that he was able to keep the plans secret, even though they involved many different leaders and towns.  Po'pay murdered his own son-in-law, Nicolás Búa, because he feared he might betray the plot to the Spanish.  Only the [[Tiwa people|Tiguex]] area, close to the seat of Spanish power in Santa Fe and perhaps the most acculturated of the Pueblos, declined to join in the revolt. The [[Piro Pueblo|Southern Piros]] were apparently not invited to join the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;John, 99; Riley, 267&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Revolt==
{{main|Pueblo Revolt}}
The last few years had been relatively quiet and free from internal dissent, and the Spanish in the capital city of Santa Fe were astonished as a report came to the governor early in the morning of August 10 that a Spanish priest had been killed at a Pueblo only nine miles from Santa Fe.&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, 7&lt;/ref&gt;  By August 15, 1,000 Spaniards had taken refuge in the Governor's palace in Santa Fe, and they were besieged by an Indian army led by Pope they estimated (or overestimated) to number 2,500. Other Spanish survivors had taken refuge in the friendly Pueblo of Isleta, from where they fled south toward Mexico.

On August 21 the Spanish broke out of the Palace and began a long trek south, leaving New Mexico behind and not stopping until they reached [[El Paso, Texas]]. The Pueblos did not molest the departing colonists. The survivors numbered nearly 2,000 persons.  The revolt cost 400 Spanish lives, including 21 of the 33 priests in New Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Riley, 268; John 101&lt;/ref&gt;

==After the Revolt==

Po'pay had succeeded in expelling the Spanish from New Mexico and according to later accounts, possibly prejudiced, set himself up as the sole ruler of all the Pueblos.  He attempted to destroy every trace of the Spanish presence in New Mexico.  "The God of the Christians is dead," he proclaimed.  "He was made of rotten wood."&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

A Spanish force of 300 men attempted to regain a foothold in New Mexico in 1681, but was repelled by Po'pay's army.  Another Spanish effort in 1687 also failed.  But the expulsion of the Spanish had not brought peace and prosperity to the Pueblos.  A return to the traditional religion did not bring rain to ease a drought that destroyed crops. The [[Apaches]] and [[Navajo people|Navajo]] stepped up their raids on the Pueblos and the Indians recalled that the Spaniards had provided some protection from the raiders.  Traditional rivalries divided the Pueblo villages.  Po'pay's efforts to rule over all the Pueblos were resented and he was considered a tyrant by many Pueblos. Moreover, among the Pueblos were sincere Christians with ties of family and friendship with the Spanish.  Opposition to Spanish rule had given the Pueblos the incentive to unite, but not the means to remain united once their common enemy was vanquished.

Po'pay died, probably in 1688, with the united Pueblo state he envisioned divided and weak.  In 1692, Governor Diego de Vargas, with an army of 150 Spanish soldiers and pro-Spanish Pueblo warriors, attempted reconquest.  Vargas wisely promised pardon rather than punishment and most of the Pueblos gradually acceded to Spanish rule although violent opposition to Spanish rule continued for several years. Only the distant [[Hopi]], living in what is today [[Arizona]], retained their independence although many Pueblos also took up residence among the Navajo and Apaches.&lt;ref&gt;John, 121-147.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath and assessment of Po'pay==
[[File:PopeUnveiling1.jpg|thumb|123px|left|Sculptor Fragua and the unveiling of the statue in Washington DC]]
As stated by Matthew Martinez of Po'pay's home Pueblo, [[Ohkay Owingeh]], "it took a unique individual to orchestrate the revolt across two dozen communities who spoke six different languages and were sprawled over a distance of nearly 400 miles."&lt;ref name="newmexicohistory1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=418 |title=New Mexico Office of the State Historian : Popé |publisher=Newmexicohistory.org |date=2005-05-21 |accessdate=2011-10-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110718221731/http://www.newmexicohistory.org/filedetails.php?fileID=418 |archivedate=2011-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; What little we know of Po'pay the man is distorted through the lenses of the Spanish chroniclers and their Indian informants, most of whom were opposed to Po'Pay.

Both the Spanish and the Pueblos were decimated by the revolt and its aftermath. However, what can be said with certainty is that the relations between Spanish and the Pueblos was far different after the revolt than before.  The dreaded '''[[encomienda]]''' system (forced labor) was prohibited in New Mexico. Franciscan priests did not interfere with Pueblo religious ceremonies provided that the Pueblos observed the outward forms of Catholicism.  Pueblo warrior and Spanish soldier became allies in the fight against their common enemies, the Apaches, Navajo, [[Ute tribe|Utes]], and a new and even greater threat to the survival of New Mexico, the [[Comanche]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/people/i_r/pope.htm |title=The West - Popé |publisher=PBS |date= |accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, New Mexico became a blend of Spanish and Pueblo culture.

==Recognition==

On September 22, 2005, the [[Po'pay (Fragua)|Po'pay statue]] for the [[National Statuary Hall]] in the rotunda of the U.S. Congress building was unveiled.  The artist, [[Cliff Fragua]], was the first American Indian artist to have a statue placed in the Statuary Hall.  The statue, slightly larger than life size, shows Po'Pay holding a knotted cord in his left hand, the signal for the initiation of the revolt.  In his right hand is a bear fetish and behind him a pot, both symbolizing the Pueblo world and religion. On his back are the scars from the whipping he received as a consequence of his observing Pueblo religious ceremonies.  Herman Agoyo of Ohkay Owingeh said: "To the Pueblo people here, Po'pay is our hero.  Tribes were on the verge of losing their cultural identity when the Pueblo revolt brought everything back on track for our people."&lt;ref name="newmexicohistory1"/&gt;  It is one of two statues presented by [[New Mexico]] to the [[National Statuary Hall Collection]]. It is currently displayed in the Capitol Visitors' Center.

Po'pay is mentioned by the controversial Taos [[Roman Catholic|priest]] [[Father Martinez]] in [[Willa Cather|Willa Cather's]] '' [[Death Comes for the Archbishop]],'' as leader of the Indian revolt which "so added to Spanish martyrology."

The '''Sacred Relic of the tooth of Buddha''' ([[Pali]] ''danta dhātuya'') is venerated in [[Sri Lanka]] as a [[cetiya]] "relic" of [[Gautama Buddha]], on whose teachings [[Buddhism]] was founded.

==History==

===The relic in India===

According to Sri Lankan legends, when the Buddha died in 543 BC, his body was cremated in a [[sandalwood]] pyre at [[Kushinagar]] and his left canine tooth was retrieved from the funeral pyre by his disciple, [[Khema]]. Khema then gave it to King Brahmadatte for veneration.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Buddha's Tooth|url=http://buddhism.about.com/od/buddhistholidays/a/The-Buddhas-Tooth.htm|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=May 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became a royal possession in Brahmadatte's country and was kept in the city of Dantapuri (modern [[Puri]], [[Odisha]]).

A belief grew that whoever possessed the tooth relic had a divine right to rule that land.&lt;ref name="time"&gt;{{cite news|title=Top 10 Religious Relics|url=http://www.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1983194_1983193_1983197,00.html|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|accessdate=May 12, 2013|date=April 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Dāṭhāvaṃsa'' recounts the tale of a war fought over the relic 800 years later between Guhasiva of [[Kalinga (Indian literature)|the republic of Kalinga]] and a king named Pandu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Dhammakitti|title=The Daṭhávansa; or, The history of the tooth-relic of Gotama Buddha &amp;#91;by Dhammakitti&amp;#93;. Tr., with notes, by Mutu Coomára Swámy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0bsOAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA42|year=1874|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The relic in Sri Lanka ===
[[Image:Zahntempel Kandy.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[Temple of the Tooth]], [[Kandy]], [[Sri Lanka]]]]
[[Image:SL51tooth.jpg|200px|thumb|right|The tooth sanctuary]]

Legend states the [[Abhayagiri vihāra]] was first appointed custodianship of the relic when it was brought to the island after the conflict in Kalinga. As time went on, the land was threatened with foreign invasions; at one time, the king of [[Bago, Burma]] offered the Portuguese £50,000 as a ransom of the tooth;&lt;ref name="about"/&gt; and the seat of the kingdom was moved from [[Anuradhapura]] to [[Polonnaruwa]], then to [[Dambadeniya]] and other cities. Upon each change of capital, a new palace was built to enshrine the relic.  Finally, it was brought to [[Kandy]] where it is at present, in the [[Temple of the Tooth]].&lt;ref name="time"/&gt;

The relic came to be regarded as a symbolic representation of the living Buddha and it is on this basis that there grew up a series of offerings, rituals, and ceremonies. These are conducted under the supervision of the two [[Mahanayaka]]s of Malwatte, Asgiriya chapters, and [[Diyawadana Nilame]] of the Maligawa.  These have a hierarchy of officials and temple functionaries to perform the services and rituals.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

'''''Rishi''''' ([[Sanskrit]]: ऋषि [[IAST]]: ṛṣi) is a Vedic term for an inspired poet of hymns from the [[Vedas]]. Post-Vedic tradition of [[Hinduism]] regards the rishis as "seers", "great sadhus" or "sages" who after intense meditation ([[Tapas (Sanskrit)|tapas]]) realized the supreme truth and eternal knowledge, which they composed into hymns.&lt;ref name=scharfe13&gt;Hartmut Scharfe (2002), Handbook of Oriental Studies, BRILL Academic, {{ISBN|978-9004125568}}, pages 13–15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==

The word ''Rishi'' ([[Yogi]], Phra Ruesi, {{lang-lo|ພະລືສີ}}, {{lang-th|พระฤาษี}}) may be derived from two different meanings of the root 'rsh'. Sanskrit grammarians&lt;ref&gt;''cf.'' Commentary on ''[[Unadi-Sutra]]'',{{by whom|date=October 2017}}{{year needed|date=October 2017}} iv, 119&lt;/ref&gt; derive this word from the second meaning: "to go, to move".&lt;ref&gt;Dhātupāṭha of Pānini, xxviii). V. S. Apte&lt;/ref&gt; V. S. Apte&lt;ref&gt;V. S. Apte (Sanskrit-Hindi Kosh, 1890, reprint 1997 by Motilāl Banārasidās Publishers, Delhi)&lt;/ref&gt; gives this particular meaning and derivation, and [[Monier-Williams]]&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; also gives the same, with some qualification.

Another form of this root means "to flow, to move near by flowing". (All the meanings and derivations cited above are based upon ''Sanskrit English Dictionary'' of Monier-Williams).&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; Monier-Williams also quotes Tārānātha who compiled the great (Sanskrit-to-Sanskrit) dictionary named "ṛṣati jñānena saṃsāra-pāram" (i.e., "one who reaches beyond this mundane world by means of spiritual knowledge").

More than a century ago, Monier-Williams tentatively suggested a derivation from ''{{IAST|drś}}'' "to see".&lt;ref&gt;http://flaez.ch/cgi-bin/mw.pl?query=RSi&lt;/ref&gt; Monier-Williams also quotes the Hibernian (Irish) form ''arsan'' (a sage, a man old in wisdom) and ''arrach'' (old, ancient, aged) as related to ''rishi''. Monier-Williams also conjectures that the root ''drish'' (to see) might have given rise to an obsolete root ''rish'' meaning "to see".

However, the root has a close [[Avestan]] cognate ''ərəšiš''&lt;ref&gt;[[Yasna]] 31.5; cf. 40.4&lt;/ref&gt; "an [[Religious ecstasy|ecstatic]]" (see also [[Yurodivy]], [[Vates]]). Yet the Indo-European dictionary of  [[Julius Pokorny]] connects the word to a PIE root ''{{PIE|*h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;er-s}}'' meaning "rise, protrude", in the sense of "excellent" and thus cognate with [[Ṛta]] and [[wikt:rightness|right]] and [[Asha]]. In Sanskrit, forms of the root ''rish'' become ''arsh-'' in many words, (e.g., ''arsh'')

Modern etymological explanations such as by [[Manfred Mayrhofer]] in his ''Etymological Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;''Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen'', Heidelberg 1986, I 261&lt;/ref&gt; leave the case open, and do not prefer a connection to ''{{IAST|ṛṣ}}'' "pour, flow" ([[PIE]] ''{{PIE|*h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;ers}}''), rather one with German ''rasen'' "to be ecstatic, be in a different state of mind" (and perhaps Lithuanian ''aršus'').

Some of the earliest lists of ''Rishi'' are found in Jaiminiya Brahmana verse 2.218 and [[Brihadaranyaka Upanishad]] verse 2.2.6.&lt;ref name=jmcdaniel309&gt;Justin McDaniel (2013), This Hindu holy man is a Thai Buddhist, South East Asia Research, Volume 21, Number 2, page 309, 303-321&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Seer" of the Vedas==
[[File:Rishi.jpg|thumb|A temple relief showing a Rishi.]]
In the [[Vedas]], the word denotes an inspired poet of Vedic hymns.&lt;ref name=scharfe13/&gt; In particular, Ṛṣi refers to the authors of the hymns of the [[Rigveda]]. 

Post-Vedic tradition regards the Rishis as "sages" or [[saint]]s, constituting a peculiar class of divine human beings in the early mythical system, as distinct from [[Asura]]s, [[deva (Hinduism)|Deva]]s and mortal men. [[Swami Vivekananda]] described "Rishi"s as ''Mantra-drashtas'' or "the seers of thought". He told— "The truth came to the Rishis of India — the Mantra-drashtâs, the seers of thought — and will come to all Rishis in the future, not to talkers, not to book-swallowers, not to scholars, not to philologists, but to seers of thought."&lt;ref name="Swami Vivekananda on Rishis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Swami Vivekananda on Rishis|url=http://www.swamivivekanandaquotes.org/2014/03/swami-vivekanandas-quotes-on-rishis-and-sages.html|publisher=Swami Vivekananda Quotes|accessdate=12 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notable female [http://www.speakingtree.in/public/spiritual-blogs/masters/philosophy/rshik-s-of-the-rgveda-214571 rishikas] who contributed to the composition of the Vedic scriptures are:
The [[Rig Veda]] mentions Romasha, [[Lopamudra]], Apala, [[Kadru]], Visvavara, Ghosha, Juhu, Vagambhrini, Paulomi, [[Yami]], Indrani, Savitri, and Devayani.
The [[Sama Veda]] adds Nodha, Akrishtabhasha, Sikatanivavari and Gaupayana.

In [[Mahabharata]] 12, on the other hand, there is the post-Vedic list of [[Marici (Buddhism)|Marici]], [[Atri]], [[Angiras (sage)|Angiras]], [[Pulaha]], [[Kratu]], [[Pulastya]] and [[Vashista]]. The Mahābhārata list explicitly refers to the saptarshis of the first [[manvantara]]&lt;ref name="Williams" /&gt; and not to those of the present manvantara. Each manvantara had a unique set of saptarshi. In Harivamsha 417ff, the names of the Rishis of each manvantara are enumerated.

In addition to the Sapta{{IAST|rṣi}}, there are other classifications of sages. In descending order of precedence, they are [[Brahmarshi]], [[Maharshi]], [[Rajarshi]]. Deva{{IAST|rṣi}}, Param{{IAST|rṣi}}, Shruta{{IAST|rṣi}} and Kānda{{IAST|rṣi}} are added in Manusmriti iv-94 and xi-236 and in two dramas of Kālidasa.

The Chaturvarga-Chintāmani of Hemādri puts '{{IAST|riṣi}}' at the seventh place in the eightfold division of Brāhmanas. [[Amarakosha]]&lt;ref&gt;Amarakosha (2.7.41–42)&lt;/ref&gt; (the famous Sanskrit synonym lexicon compiled by  Amarasimha) mentions seven types of {{IAST|riṣi}}s : Shrutarshi, Kāndarshi, Paramarshi, Maharshi, Rājarshi, Brahmarshi and Devarshi. Amarakosha strictly distinguishes Rishi from other types of sages, such as sanyāsi, {{IAST|bhikṣu}}, parivrājaka, tapasvi, muni, brahmachāri, yati, etc.

==Rishi in Indonesia and Khmer temples==
Most medieval era [[Candi of Indonesia|Hindu temples of Java]], Indonesia show Rishi [[Agastya]] statues or reliefs, usually guarding the southern side of [[Shaivite]] temples.&lt;ref name=jmcdaniel309/&gt; Some examples include [[Candi Sambisari]] and the Prambanan temple near [[Yogyakarta]].&lt;ref&gt;Maud Girard-Geslan et al (1997), Art of Southeast Asia, Harry Abrams, Paris, page 350&lt;/ref&gt; Rishi Agastya is known as Phra Reusi Akkhot in Thailand.&lt;ref name=jmcdaniel309/&gt;

==Ruesi in Cambodia, Thailand, Myanmar and  Laos==
[[File:2013 Wat Suan Tan 02.jpg|thumb|A statue of a Ruesi at Wat Suan Tan in [[Nan, Thailand]]]]
'''Ruesi''' (sanskrit: ''ṛṣi''}}, {{lang-km|តាឥសី}}, {{lang-th|ฤๅษี}}, {{lang-lo|ລືສີ}}) is a [[hermit]] [[List of types of spiritual teachers|sage]], the equivalent of Rishi in [[India]].In [[Myanmar]], there are some known as ရေသ့ Rase. {{cn|date=October 2017}}

==Other uses==
Rishi is also a male given name, and less commonly a Brahmin last name. 

In [[Carnatic music]], "Rishi" is the seventh ''chakra'' (group) of [[Melakarta]] [[raga]]s. The names of ''chakras'' are based on the numbers associated with each name. In this case, there are [[Saptarishi|seven rishis]] and hence the 7th ''chakra'' is "Rishi".&lt;ref name="sim"&gt;''South Indian Music'' Book III, by Prof. P Sambamoorthy, Published 1973, The Indian Music Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ragas"&gt;''Ragas in Carnatic music'' by Dr. S. Bhagyalekshmy, Pub. 1990, CBH Publications&lt;/ref&gt;

The descendant families of these Rishis, refer to their ancestral lineage through their family "[[gotra]]". This is a common practice among the Brahmin sects of the current Hindu society.

The name "Rishi" (pronounced "ruesi") is also the basis of one of the letters of the [[Thai alphabet]], ''so reu-si'' ({{lang-th|ษ ฤๅษี}}).

The '''Sun Temple''' of '''Sogamoso''' was a temple constructed by the [[Muisca people|Muisca]] as a place of worship for their Sun god [[Sué]]. The temple was built in [[Sogamoso]], [[Colombia]], then part of the [[Muisca Confederation]] and called Sugamuxi. It was the most important temple in the [[Muisca religion|religion]] of the Muisca. The temple was destroyed by fire brought by the [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca|Spanish]] [[conquistador]]es led by [[Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada]] who was eager to find the legendary ''[[El Dorado]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.1, p.18&lt;/ref&gt; A reconstruction has been built in the Archeology Museum of Sogamoso.

== Structure and worship ==
[[File:Escudo de Sogamoso.svg|thumb|220px|left|Coat of arms of '''Sogamoso'''; City of the Sun]]
[[File:Don Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada.JPG|thumb|left|220px|Soldiers in the army of '''Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada''' destroyed the temple with their torches]]
The Temple of the Sun was built on the right banks of the small river Monquirá. The temple was a large round structure made of poles and clay with a roof made of reed. The temple did not have any windows. The columns surrounding the temple were built in three concentric rings made of wood harvested in [[Casanare Department|Casanare]]. The temple represented the cosmos and was built to honour Sun god Sué. The temple also was a burial ground for the most important ''[[cacique]]s'' and priests ([[Chibcha language|Chibcha]]: ''ogques'').&lt;ref name=Pueblos&gt;{{es}} [http://pueblosoriginarios.com/sur/caribe/muisca/sogamoso.html Temple of the Sun - Sogamoso] - Pueblos Originarios - accessed 04-05-2016&lt;/ref&gt;

The Muisca had a decent knowledge of [[astronomy]] and constructed various sites across their territories. ''[[El Infiernito]]'', just outside [[Villa de Leyva]] has survived. The Sun Temple was constructed according to the positions of the Sun.&lt;ref name=Pueblos/&gt;

At the temple rituals were organised by the ''caciques'' and ''[[zaque]]s'' of the Muisca Confederation. The [[Muisca mythology|mythological]] [[Idacansás]] held gatherings where children (''moxas'') were [[human sacrifice|sacrificed]]. He made the city of Sugamuxi a sacred place.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.12, p.77&lt;/ref&gt; Mythical [[Thomagata]] was believed to travel each night between Tunja and the temple, a march he repeated ten times per night.&lt;ref&gt;Ocampo López, 2013, Ch.14, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Destruction ===
Spanish conquistador Jiménez de Quesada heard of the Sun Temple and entered Sogamoso in early September 1537. He arrived in the afternoon and decided to wait till next morning to take the ''cacique'' of Sugamuxi out of the temple.

Curious to see the treasures in the temple, two of his soldiers, [[Spanish conquest of the Muisca#1537 - conquest of Sugamuxi|Miguel Sánchez and Juan Rodríguez Parra]] went to the sacred place on the night of September 4th, lighting their way with torches. When they entered the temple they found rich ornaments and [[mummy|mummies]] of ancient nobles. While they were collecting parts of the treasures of the temple they accidentally set fire to it with their torches destroying the temple.&lt;ref name=Pueblos/&gt;

=== Reconstruction ===
In 1942 archeologist [[Eliécer Silva Celis]] uncovered a Muisca cemetery in Sogamoso. The cemetery contained tombs of indigenous Muisca with mummies still preserved. Based on his archeological findings he was able to locate the original site of the temple and decided to reconstruct it.

The replica of the temple is {{convert|18|m|ft}} high. The symbols in the dome tell the story of the creation of the Earth by [[Chiminigagua]], the Supreme Being of the Muisca. The small openings on the sides serve as a [[Muisca calendar|calendar]]; every year on December 22nd the sunlight falls right on the central pillar. Around the temple the cemetery with [[Muisca mummification|mummies]], that were originally displayed inside the temple, is reconstructed. Today the temple is part of the [[Archaeology Museum, Sogamoso|Archeology Museum of Sogamoso]], governed by the [[Pedagogical and Technological University of Colombia]] based in [[Tunja]].&lt;ref name=Pueblos/&gt;

==4-part series==
The documentary series ''The Greatest Pharaohs'' chronicles the lives of the men and women who built and maintained the Egyptian dynasties and the resources and power of ancient Egypt. Footage is included of the recently opened pyramid complex of the [[Pharaoh]] [[Sneferu]] and the rarely seen ancient burial ground of [[Abydos, Egypt|Abydos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetv.com/class/teachingmaterials/descript.html#g aetv.com], overview of ''The Greatest Pharaohs'', accessed 01-18-2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Part 1
Follows the birth of [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] civilization and the origins of the pharaohs and their legacy of the pyramids. It begins with the story of how the first pharaoh, the warrior [[Narmer]], united Upper and Lower [[Egypt]] and began the first dynasty. Covers [[Narmer]], [[Hor-Aha]], [[Sneferu]], and [[Khafra]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0144.html aetv.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720044140/http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0144.html |date=2008-07-20 }}, Part 1 of ''The Greatest Pharaohs'', accessed 01-18-2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Part 2
By 2180 BCE, almost 1,000 years after the first pharaoh, the Egyptians had made advances in science, art, and technology and had built what was arguably the most advanced culture at that time in civilized history. However, the [[Old Kingdom]] started to decay when a child became [[Pharaoh]]. There were centuries of chaos before Egypt was reborn under a series of militarily inclined pharaohs who established the [[New Kingdom]]. Covers [[Menkaura]], [[Pepi II]], [[Mentuhotep II]], and [[Ahmose I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0145.html aetv.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720045034/http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0145.html |date=2008-07-20 }}, Part 2 of ''The Greatest Pharaohs'', accessed 01-18-2009&lt;/ref&gt; 
;Part 3
By 1353 BCE, Egypt was again stable, with much of the prosperity of the [[Old Kingdom]]. However, the ascension of [[Akhenaten]] brought a new crisis. Akhenaten was branded a heretic by history because of his attempts to transform Egypt's religion, but he was also considered remarkable by the way he shared power with [[Nefertiti]]. Covers [[Amenhotep IV]] ([[Akhenaten]]), [[Tutankhamun]], [[Ay]], and [[Seti I]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0146.html aetv.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719180759/http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0146.html |date=2008-07-19 }}, Part 3 of ''The Greatest Pharaohs'', accessed 01-18-2009&lt;/ref&gt;
;Part 4
Considered by historians to be the greatest era of the [[New Kingdom]] began in 1279 BCE, when [[Ramses II]] assumed the throne. Ramses II is remembered by history as [[Ramses the Great]]. ''The Great Pharaohs of Egypt'' series concludes with an in-depth look at his 67-year reign. He led foreign conquests and embarked on what is considered the most ambitious building program since the Great Pyramids, restoring old monuments and erecting countless new ones. The program concludes with the life and death of Cleopatra as the last pharaoh. Covers [[Ramses II]], [[Ramses III]], and [[Cleopatra VII]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0147.html aetv.com] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080720145757/http://www.aetv.com/class/admin/study_guide/archives/aetv_guide.0147.html |date=2008-07-20 }}, Part 4 of ''The Greatest Pharaohs'', accessed 01-18-2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Video release==
It was released by [[A&amp;E Television Networks|A&amp;E Home Video]] and distributed in the [[United States|U.S.]] by New Video Group ([[1997 in film|1997]]).&lt;ref name=UV/&gt;

In [[Jacques Auguste Simon Collin de Plancy]]'s 1818 ''[[Dictionnaire Infernal]]'', '''Ukobach''' or '''Urobach''' is described as a "demon of an inferior order". He is shown with a flaming or red body, large eyes and ears and often a pan full of coals or a hot poker. He is said to be the inventor of fireworks and the art of frying foods. He is charged by [[Belzebuth]] to maintain the "oil in the infernal boilers", which is made of the blood of the damned, "forged in the west where the sun sets".

{{notability|date=November 2011}}

The '''Universal Worship Service''' was created by [[Inayat Khan]] as a prayer service invoking the One Being through the world's major faith traditions.

The service is officiated by clergy who are called Cherags and Cheragas, from the Persian word for 'lamp.'
An oil lamp or candle is lit and readings taken on a particular theme from the sacred texts of six of the [[major world religions]] and traditions, each evoking a Divine Quality the tradition is said to illustrate: 
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Universal-worship.jpg|left|thumb|Universal Worship Altar]] --&gt;
* [[Buddhism]]  (Divine Compassion)
* [[Christianity]]  (Divine Self-Sacrifice)
* [[Hinduism]]  (Divine Wisdom)
* [[Islam]]  (Divine Unity)
* [[Judaism]]  (Divine Law, or Divine Covenant)
* [[Zoroastrianism]]  (Divine Purity)

Other candles may be lit to honor other world traditions.  Some of the more commonly included traditions are:
* The Goddess Tradition (also called the tradition of the Divine Feminine)
* Indigenous Traditions (usually, the indigenous tradition local to the celebration of the service is honored)
* [[Taoism]] 

The first candle represents the light of Divine Truth, and from it all the other nine candles are lit.

The service also includes [[Inayat Khan]]'s prayers [[Saum (Universal Sufism)|Saum]], [[Salat]], and [[Khatum]].

There are often meditations, sermons, songs, or [[Dances of Universal Peace]] following the readings.

The service can be for any theme and is also the background of Universal Sufi weddings, funerals and baby blessings.&lt;ref&gt;Prajapati O'Neil - [[Sufi Order International]]&lt;/ref&gt;
