===Brawl===
During the post game celebration Memphis players ran towards the BYU sideline to celebrate with their fans sitting behind the BYU bench (due to the bizarre baseball stadium field layout, most of the people in attendance could only sit on the BYU side of the field).  Some bumping and shoving occurred and one Memphis player was pushed in the back by a BYU player that was allegedly also being pushed from behind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i905.photobucket.com/albums/ac257/A380038/shove.jpg Koroma Shoved? 1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xdnxfV-CJP8|title=BYU Memphis fight - Koroma's Push|date=22 December 2014|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Memphis player he pushed then turned around and (using both hands) punched/shoved the BYU player in the back of the head.  As the BYU player turned his attention back to the attacker in an apparent attempt to retaliate he threw a punch and he was attacked by 3-4 Memphis players and an all out, bench-clearing brawl ensued.  Punches and kicks were thrown by many players on both sides, one Memphis player even used a helmet as a weapon,&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--pHmvoCYV--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/ifswjsayev4vgnugsv16.gif Johnson Uses Helmet in Brawl]&lt;/ref&gt; and when it was over, numerous players walked off the field bloody and bruised.  As the brawl was dying down a BYU player (Kai Nacua) can be seen coming into view and sucker punching a Memphis player (Alan Cross), who was not wearing a helmet, from behind.&lt;ref&gt;[http://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--e1lvJ4nw--/c_fit,fl_progressive,q_80,w_636/dmppvr7h5dqzsulqvt5b.gif Nacua Sucker Punches Cross]&lt;/ref&gt;  As the BYU player turned toward the camera's view, a bloodied bruise could be clearly seen from a punch he received while attempting to defend himself from another Memphis player earlier in the brawl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://s1078.photobucket.com/user/cougarcoug/media/Nacua1_zps9cfoxx5y.gif.html|title=Nacua1_zps9cfoxx5y.gif gif by cougarcoug - Photobucket|work=Photobucket}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Aftermath====

Tom Holmoe, BYU's athletic director, apologized to BYU fans stating, "We expect better of our athletes, even in the face of a difficult loss. We intend to fully review this matter. I apologize to Cougar Nation." Memphis said in a statement via AAC commissioner Mike Aresco that they are displeased with the Miami Beach Bowl brawl, and that, "The university will respond accordingly following this detailed review. Needless to say, we are extremely disappointed that this happened, as we expect the highest standard of conduct from our student-athletes." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.travelerstoday.com/articles/16927/20141225/miami-beach-bowl-brawl-disappoints-aac-commish-school-ads-what.htm|title=Miami Beach Bowl Brawl Disappoints AAC Commish, School Ads, What Started The Fight? [VIDEO]|work=TravelersToday}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 2015, The University of Memphis announced the completion of an internal review of the incident and expected punishments to be levied against twelve members of the team.&lt;ref name="Review"&gt;{{cite news |title=Memphis Completes Review of Football Altercation |url=http://www.gotigersgo.com/genrel/012015aaa.html |date=January 20, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  BYU also took action to punish their players. Kai Nacua, Trey Dye, Sione Takitaki, and Tomasi Laulile were all suspended for BYU's season opener against Nebraska.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12611">{{Grammatical categories}}
In [[linguistics]] and [[grammar]], '''affirmation''' and '''negation''' ([[List of glossing abbreviations|abbreviated]] respectively '''{{sc|aff}}''' and '''{{sc|neg}}''') are the ways that grammar encode negative and positive polarity in [[verb phrase]]s, [[clause]]s, or other [[utterance]]s. Essentially an affirmative (positive) form is used to express the validity or [[truth]] of a basic assertion, while a negative form expresses its falsity. Examples are the [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s "Jane is here" and "Jane is not here"; the first is affirmative, while the second is negative.

The [[grammatical category]] associated and with affirmative and negative is called '''polarity'''. This means that a sentence, verb phrase, etc. may be said to have either affirmative or negative polarity (its polarity may be either affirmative or negative). Affirmative is typically the unmarked polarity, whereas a negative statement is marked in some way, whether by a negating word or particle such as [[English grammar|English]] ''not'', an [[affix]] such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]] -''nai'', or by other means, which reverses the meaning of the [[predicate (grammar)|predicate]]. The process of converting affirmative to negative is called '''negation''' – the grammatical rules for negation vary from language to language, and a given language may have more than one method of doing so.

Affirmative and negative responses (especially, though not exclusively, to [[question]]s) are often expressed using [[particle (grammar)|particle]]s or words such as [[yes and no|''yes'' and ''no'']], where ''yes'' is the affirmative and ''no'' the negative particle.

==Affirmative and negative responses==
{{main article|Yes and no}}
Special affirmative and negative words ([[particle (grammar)|particle]]s) are often found in responses to questions, and sometimes to other assertions by way of agreement or disagreement. In English, these are ''yes'' and ''no'' respectively, in French ''oui'', ''si'' and ''non'', in Swedish ''ja'', ''jo'' and ''nej'', and so on. Not all languages make such common use of particles of this type; in some (such as [[Welsh grammar|Welsh]]) it is more common to repeat the verb or another part of the predicate, with or without negation accordingly.

Complications sometimes arise in the case of responses to negative statements or questions; in some cases the response that confirms a negative statement is the negative particle (as in English: "You're not going out? No."), but in some languages this is reversed. Some languages have a distinct form to answer a negative question, such as French ''si'' and Swedish ''jo'' (these serve to contradict the negative statement suggested by the first speaker).

== Grammatical rules for negation ==

===Simple negation of verbs and clauses===
Languages have a variety of [[grammar|grammatical]] rules for converting affirmative [[verb phrase]]s or [[clause]]s into negative ones.

In many languages, an affirmative is made negative by the addition of a [[grammatical particle|particle]], meaning "not". This may be added before the [[verb phrase]], as with the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''no'':
* ''Está en casa.'' ("(S)he is at home", affirmative)
* '''''No''' está en casa.'' ("(S)he is not at home", negative)
Other examples of negating particles preceding the verb phrase include [[Italian language|Italian]] ''non'', [[Russian grammar|Russian]] не ''nye'' and [[Polish grammar|Polish]] ''nie'' (they can also be found in [[constructed language]]s: ''ne'' in [[Esperanto language|Esperanto]] and ''non'' in [[Interlingua grammar|Interlingua]]). In some other languages the negating particle follows the verb or verb phrase, as in [[Dutch language|Dutch]]:
*''Ik zie hem.'' ("I see him", affirmative)
*''Ik zie hem '''niet'''.'' ("I do not see him", negative)
Particles following the verb in this way include ''not'' in archaic and dialectal [[English language|English]] ("you remember not"), ''nicht'' in [[German language|German]] (''ich schlafe nicht'', "I am not sleeping"), and ''inte'' in [[Swedish Language|Swedish]] (''han hoppade inte'', "he did not jump").

In [[French language|French]], particles are added both before the verb phrase (''ne'') and after the verb (''pas''):
*''Je sais'' ("I know", affirmative)
*''Je '''ne''' sais '''pas''''' ("I don't know", negative).
However, in colloquial French the first particle is often omitted: ''Je sais pas''. Similar use of two negating particles can also be found in [[Afrikaans]]: ''Hy kan '''nie''' Afrikaans praat '''nie''''' ("He cannot speak Afrikaans").

In standard [[Modern English]], negation is achieved by adding ''not'' after an [[auxiliary verb]] (which here means one of a special grammatical class of verbs that also includes forms of the [[copula (linguistics)|copula]] ''be''; see [[English auxiliaries]]). If no such verb is present then the [[Auxiliary verb#Dummy|dummy auxiliary]] ''do'' (''does'', ''did'') is introduced – see [[do-support|''do''-support]].  For example:
*I have gone → I have '''not''' gone (''have'' is the auxiliary)
*He goes → He '''does not''' go (no auxiliary in the original sentence)
Different rules apply in [[subjunctive]], [[imperative mood|imperative]] and [[non-finite clause|non-finite]] clauses. For more details see {{slink|English grammar|Negation}}. (In [[Middle English]], the particle ''not'' could follow any verb, e.g. "I see not the horse.")

In some languages, like [[Welsh language|Welsh]], verbs have special inflections to be used in negative clauses. (In some language families, this may lead to reference to a negative [[grammatical mood|mood]].) An example is [[Japanese language|Japanese]], which conjugates verbs in the negative after adding the suffix ''-nai'' (indicating negation), e.g. ''taberu'' ("eat") and ''tabe'''nai''''' ("do not eat"). It could be argued that English has joined the ranks of these languages, since negation requires the use of an auxiliary verb and a distinct [[syntax]] in most cases; the form of the basic verb can change on negation, as in "he '''sings'''" vs. "he doesn't '''sing'''". [[Arnold Zwicky|Zwicky]] and [[Geoffrey Pullum|Pullum]] have shown that ''n't'' is an [[inflection]]al suffix, not a [[clitic]] or a derivational suffix.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Complex rules for negation also apply in [[Finnish language|Finnish]]; see {{slink|Finnish grammar|Negation of verbs}}. In some languages negation may also affect the dependents of the verb; for example in some [[Slavic languages]], such as [[Russian language|Russian]], the [[grammatical case|case]] of a [[direct object]] often changes from [[accusative]] to [[genitive]] when the verb is negated.

===Negation of other elements===
Negation can be applied not just to whole verb phrases, clauses or sentences, but also to specific elements (such as [[adjective]]s and [[noun phrase]]s) within sentences.&lt;ref&gt;The linguist D. Biber refers to two types of negation, synthetic ('no', 'neither' or 'nor' negation) and analytic ('not' negation). For example, "He is neither here nor there" (synthetic) or "He is not here" (analytic).&lt;/ref&gt; Ways in which this can be done again depend on the grammar of the language in question. English generally places ''not'' before the negated element, as in "I witnessed '''not a debate''', but a war." There are also negating affixes, such as the English [[prefix]]es ''non-'', ''un-'', ''in-'', etc. Such elements are called [[privative]]s.

===Multiple negation===
{{Main article|Double negative|Litotes}}
There also exist elements which carry a specialized negative meaning, including [[pronoun]]s such as ''nobody'', ''none'' and ''nothing'', [[determiners]] such as ''no'' (as in "no apples"), and adverbs such as ''never'', ''no longer'' and ''nowhere''.

Although such elements themselves have negative force, in some languages a clause in which they appear is additionally marked for ordinary negation. For example, in Russian, "I see nobody" is expressed as я никого́ не ви́жу ''ja nikovó nye vízhu'', literally "I nobody not see" – the ordinary negating particle не ''nye'' ("not") is used in addition to the negative pronoun никого́  ''nikovó'' ("nobody"). Italian behaves in a similar way: ''Non ti vede nessuno'', "nobody can see you", although ''Nessuno ti vede'' is also a possible clause with exactly the same meaning.

In  [[Russian language|Russian]], all of the elements ("not", "never", "nobody", "nowhere") would appear together in the sentence in their negative form. In Italian, a clause works much as in Russian, but ''non'' does not have to be there, and can be there only before the verb if it precedes all other negative elements: ''Tu non porti mai nessuno da nessuna parte''. "Nobody ever brings you anything here", however, could be translated ''Nessuno qui ti porta mai niente'' or ''Qui non ti porta mai niente nessuno''. In French, where simple negation is performed using ''ne ... pas'' (see above), specialized negatives appear in combination with the first particle (''ne''), but ''pas'' is omitted:
*''Je '''ne''' bois '''jamais''''' ("I '''never''' drink")
*''Je '''ne''' vois '''personne''''' ("I see '''nobody'''")
*''Je '''n'&lt;nowiki/&gt;'''ai '''jamais''' vu '''personne''''' ("I have '''never''' seen '''anybody'''") 
  
In [[Ancient Greek]], a simple negative (οὐ ''ou'' "not" or μή ''mḗ'' "not ([[Linguistic modality|modal]])") following another simple or compound negative (e.g. οὐδείς ''oudeís'' "nobody") results in an affirmation, whereas a compound negative following a simple or compound negative strengthens the negation:
* οὐδεὶς οὐκ ἔπασχέ τι ''oudeìs ouk épaskhé ti'', "nobody was not suffering something", i.e. "everybody was suffering"
* μὴ θορυβήσῃ μηδείς ''mḕ thorubḗsēi mēdeís'', "let (not) nobody raise an uproar", meaning "let nobody raise an uproar"

==Meaning of negation==
Simple grammatical negation of a clause in principle has the effect of converting a proposition to its [[negation|logical negation]] – replacing an assertion that something is the case by an assertion that it is not the case.

In some cases, however, particularly when a particular [[linguistic modality|modality]] is expressed, the semantic effect of negation may be somewhat different. For example, in English, the meaning of "you must not go" is not in fact the exact negation of that of "you must go" – this would be expressed as "you don't have to go" or "you needn't go". The negation "must not" has a stronger meaning (the effect is to apply the logical negation to the following infinitive rather than to the full clause with ''must''). For more details and other similar cases, see the relevant sections of [[English modal verbs]].

In some cases, by way of [[irony]], an affirmative statement may be intended to have the meaning of the corresponding negative, or vice versa. For examples see [[antiphrasis]] and [[sarcasm]].

For the use of double negations or similar as understatements ("not unappealing", "not bad", etc.) see [[litotes]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7145">{{dablink|The page is about the ethical doctrine. For other uses of the word, see [[altruism]].}}

'''Altruism''' (also called the '''ethic of altruism''', '''moralistic altruism''', and '''ethical altruism''') is an [[ethics|ethical doctrine]] that holds that the [[morality|moral]] value of an individual's actions depend solely on the impact on other individuals, regardless of the consequences on the individual itself. [[James Fieser]] states the altruist dictum as: "An action is morally right if the consequences of that action are more favorable than unfavorable to everyone except the agent."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iep.utm.edu/ethics/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Auguste Comte]]'s version of altruism calls for living for the sake of others. One who holds to either of these ethics is known as an "altruist."

The word "altruism" (''French, altruisme, from autrui: "other people", derived from Latin alter: "other"'') was coined by [[Auguste Comte]], the French founder of [[positivism]], in order to describe the ethical doctrine he supported. He believed that individuals had a [[moral obligation]] to renounce self-interest and live for others. Comte says, in his ''Catéchisme Positiviste'',&lt;ref name="comte"&gt;[[Auguste Comte|Comte, August]]. ''Catéchisme positiviste'' (1852) or ''Catechism of Positivism'', trans. R. Congreve, (London: Kegan Paul, 1891)&lt;/ref&gt; that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[The] social point of view cannot tolerate the notion of rights, for such notion rests on individualism. We are born under a load of obligations of every kind, to our predecessors, to our successors, to our contemporaries. After our birth these obligations increase or accumulate, for it is some time before we can return any service.... This ["to live for others"], the definitive formula of human morality, gives a direct sanction exclusively to our instincts of benevolence, the common source of happiness and duty. [Man must serve] Humanity, whose we are entirely."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' says that for Comte's altruism, "The first principle of morality...is the regulative supremacy of social sympathy over the self-regarding instincts."&lt;ref name="catholicencyclopedia"&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01369a.htm ''Catholic Encyclopedia entry on altruism'']&lt;/ref&gt; Author Gabriel Moran, (professor in the department of Humanities and the Social Sciences, New York University) says "The law and duty of life in altruism [for Comte] was summed up in the phrase : Live for others."&lt;ref name="moran"&gt;Gabriel Moran ''Christian Religion and National Interests''&lt;/ref&gt;

Various [[philosophers]] define the doctrine in various ways, but all definitions generally revolve around a moral obligation to benefit others or the pronouncement of moral value in serving others rather than oneself. Philosopher [[C. D. Broad]] defines altruism as "the doctrine that each of us has a special obligation to benefit others."&lt;ref name="cheney"&gt;Cheney, D. R. (Editor), ''Broad's critical essays in moral philosophy'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;283–301). London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt; Philosopher W. G. Maclagan defines it as "a duty to relieve the distress and promote the happiness of our fellows...Altruism is to...maintain quite simply that a man may and should discount altogether his own pleasure or happiness as such when he is deciding what course of action to pursue."&lt;ref name="maclagan"&gt;''Self and Others: A Defense of Altruism'' Philosophical Quarterly 4 (1954): pp 109–110.&lt;/ref&gt;

==As consequentialist ethics==
Altruism is often seen as a form of [[consequentialism]], as it indicates that an action is ethically right if it brings good consequences to others. Altruism may be seen as similar to [[utilitarianism]], however an essential difference is that the latter prescribes acts that maximize good consequences for all of society, while altruism prescribes maximizing good consequences for everyone except the actor. Spencer argued that since the rest of society will almost always outnumber the utilitarian, a genuine utilitarian will inevitably end up practicing altruism or a form of altruism.&lt;ref&gt;''Principles of Ethics'' §85ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Effective altruism]] is a philosophy and social movement that maintains that the consequences of our actions - for ourselves and others - are important, and seeks to maximise the overall quality of these consequences.

==Criticisms==
[[David Kelley]], discussing [[Ayn Rand]]'s views, says that "there is no rational ground for asserting that sacrificing yourself in order to serve others is morally superior to pursuing your own (long-term, rational) self-interest. Altruism ultimately depends on non-rational 'rationales,' on mysticism in some form..." Furthermore, he holds that there is a danger of the state enforcing that moral ideal: "If self-sacrifice is an ideal - if service to others is the highest, most honorable course of action - why not force people to act accordingly?" He believes this can ultimately result in the state forcing everyone into a [[collectivist]] political system.&lt;ref name="kelley"&gt;Kelley, David. https://atlassociety.org/commentary/commentary-blog/3666-epistemology-and-politics-ayn-rand-s-cultural-commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

Norwegian eco-philosopher [[Arne Næss]] argues that environmental action based upon altruism — or service of the other — stems from a shrunken "egoic" concept of the self.  Self-actualization will result, he argues, in the recovery of an "[[ecological self]]", in which actions formerly seen as altruistic are in reality a form of [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref name="seed"&gt;Seed, John, Macy, Joanna, Naess, Arne, &amp; Fleming, Pat (1988). "Thinking Like a Mountain: Towards a Council of All Beings" (New Society Press)&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Max Scheler]] distinguishes two different ways in which the strong can help the weak, one which is an expression of love, "motivated by a powerful feeling of security, strength, and inner salvation, of the invincible fullness of one’s own life and existence"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 88–89 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and another which is merely "one of the many modern substitutes for love, ... nothing but the urge to turn away from oneself and to lose oneself in other people’s business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 95–96 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its worst, Scheler says, "love for the small, the poor, the weak, and the oppressed is really disguised hatred, repressed envy, an impulse to detract, etc., directed against the opposite phenomena: wealth, strength, power, largesse."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Scheler | first = Max | coauthors = | title = Ressentiment | year = 1961  | pages = 96–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Basque Declaration''' (2016) is a formal document outlining 15 pathways for the development of more sustainable cities in Europe. The Declaration was acclaimed at the 8th European Conference on Sustainable Cities &amp; Towns from 27-29 April 2016 in [[Basque Country (autonomous community)|Basque Country]]. The document can be seen as a continuation of the [[Aalborg Charter|Aalborg Charter (1994)]] and the Aalborg Commitments (2004) echoing sustainability vision from Local [[Agenda 21|Agenda 21]], and is itself a call for active engagement from civil society..&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/about-the-basque-declaration/|title=About the Basque Declaration}}&lt;/ref&gt; The vision of the Declaration is 'to create productive, sustainable and resilient cities for a liveable and inclusive Europe'&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/fileadmin/repository/Basque_Declaration/BD_May_Update/Basque-Declaration-ENGLISH-www.pdf|title=The Basque Declaration (English)|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Basque Declaration is targeted at city leaders in Europe, including mayors and city governments, and can also be signed by individuals. It outlines pathways to help city leaders shape the development of their own municipalities, and ultimately aims to accelerate socio-cultural, socio-economic and technological transformation. The Declaration is based on the understanding that a diversity of local initiatives are required to address social, environmental and economic challenges. It recognises the importance of things such as protecting biodiversity, decarbonising energy systems, creating more sustainable mobility systems, protecting water systems, adapting to climate change, promoting social inclusion and strengthening local economies, among other things.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Although focusing on action at the local scale, the Declaration is underpinned by the idea of cooperation, sharing and replication of solutions adapted to the local context. A strong theme of the Declaration is to have a highly engaged civil society, where participation is a key ingredient in both developing and ''implementing'' local transformative actions.

The 15 pathways listed in the Basque Declaration are summarised under three headings:

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Cultural Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To develop a 'culture of sustainability'
* To actively involve citizens, going beyond just participatory planning to co-creative approaches
* To re-think boundaries between public and private activities
* To promote social innovation, enterprises and civic engagement, focusing especially on marginalised groups and immigrants
* To nurture the [[sharing economy|sharing economy]] and ideas that combine entrepreneurship, civic engagement and societal transformation

&lt;u&gt;The Socio-Economic Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To turn challenges into opportunities for local economies in key areas such as energy and food production
* To create and close local value chains, increasing public income and local investment
* To apply innovative financing, including crowd-funding and blends of public funding or complementary currencies
* To purchase products and services conscientiously, taking into account the environmental, social and economic impacts of purchasing decisions
* To pursue development towards a circular economy, reducing the demand of natural resources and waste output

&lt;u&gt;The Technological Transformation&lt;/u&gt;
* To wisely take advantage of smart technologies
* To use public procurement as a way to accelerate innovation in the market
* To address the [[Digital divide|digital divide]] within local societies, focusing on equal access
* To support open data standards, keeping data available to the public
* The prepare political and governance structures to deal with these changes

==Transformative actions==

The Declaration supports local 'transformative actions' and encourages cities to develop and share their sustainability solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transformative Action Award|url=http://www.sustainablecities.eu/transformative-action-award/|website=Sustainable Cities EU|access-date=May 24, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [http://www.sustainablecities.eu/| Sustainable Cities EU] website has a central database where cities can submit their own 'transformative actions'. The idea is that local innovations can inspire other city leaders and where it is possible, help to facilitate replication of successful strategies. To encourage cities to report on their activities a 'Transformative Action Award' was created.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6245">{{Buddhism}}
[[Buddhism]] has developed a complex psychology of [[personality types]] (Pali: Puggala-paññatti), [[personality traits]] and underlying tendencies (anusaya). This was mostly developed in the Buddhist [[Abhidharma]] literature and its major concern was to identify differing types of persons for [[pedagogical]] and [[soteriological]] ends. The [[Buddha]] was said to have [[upaya|skillfully taught different teachings]] depending on each person's personality and level of mental development. The development of a [[Personality psychology]] was important to the Abhidharmikas who sought to adapt Buddhist teachings and practice to each personality type so as to better lead persons to [[nirvana]] by purifying their minds of their [[Kleshas (Buddhism)|mental defilements]]. 

==Typologies==
The Buddhist view of the person is encapsulated by the [[Anatta|not-self]] teaching, which states that there is no unchanging core to a person, no soul ([[Ātman (Buddhism)|atman]]) or [[Id, ego and super-ego#Ego|Ego]]. A person is defined as a stream of phenomenal events (termed ''dhammas'') in a causal series of mind moments (''samaya''), and therefore an 'individual' or 'person' is merely a conventional designation for a collection of constantly changing processes (the [[five skandhas]]). However, in the analytical Abhidharma works, Buddhists outlined how different individuals could still be dominated by certain proclivities and tendencies, patterns of thought which arose consistently enough to allow one to designate different 'personality types'. 

===Theravada===
The [[Theravada]] [[Abhidhamma Pitaka]] contains a section entitled 'The Puggala-paññatti', which translates to "designation of person types" which contains an extensive outline of a wide array of personality traits.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramakrishna Rao, Anand C. Paranjpe, Psychology in the Indian Tradition, page 159&lt;/ref&gt; The Abhidhamma generally considered twelve major classes of persons, four of the worldly ordinary class (''puthujjana'') and eight of the spiritual elect (''[[Arya (Buddhism)|ariya]]'', the noble ones).&lt;ref&gt;Bimala Charan Law, M.A., B.L. DESIGNATION OF HUMAN TYPES (PUGGALA-PANNATTI), The Pali Text Society, Lancaster, 2006, page vii.&lt;/ref&gt; The Puggala-paññatti gives a very broad array of personal descriptors organized in 10 groups, so that the first group is 50 ''single'' descriptors, the second group is 26 ''pairs'' of descriptors, the third 17 ''triplets'', and so on.&lt;ref&gt;K. Ramakrishna Rao, Anand C. Paranjpe, Psychology in the Indian Tradition, page 159&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptors include "one competent in watchfulness", "one of perturbable nature", "the wrathful and the vengeful", "the jealous and the avaricious", a "member of the elect ([[arhat]])" etc. 

In the [[Visuddhimagga]] (Path of Purification), the scholar [[Buddhaghosa]] outlines several types of personalities, each one dominated by a particular trait. The three major negative traits which condition a personality are grasping, aversion, and delusion (''lobha'', ''dosa'', and ''moha''), also known as the [[Three poisons (Buddhism)|three poisons]], and prescribes certain meditation practices for each type. He also outlines three main positive personality traits, confidence ([[Faith in Buddhism|saddha]]), wisdom ([[pañña]]), and speculation. 

===Mahayana===
The Buddhist scholar [[Asanga]] outlined seven personality types in his ''Levels of Listeners'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Inner Science of Buddhist Practice:Vasubandhu's Summary of the Five Heaps with Commentary by Sthiramati, translated by Artemus B. Engle|author=Vasubandhu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xa0VBgAAQBAJ|date=2015|publisher=Shambhala Publications|isbn=978-1-55939-920-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

#One with a strong tendency for desire, the best initial meditation for them is [[Patikulamanasikara|unattractiveness]] 
#One with a strong tendency for hatred, the best meditation for them is  [[metta|good-will]]
#One with a strong tendency for ignorance, the best meditation for them is [[dependent origination]]
#One with a strong tendency for pride, the best meditation for them is  'diversity of the constituents' 
#One with a strong tendency for discursive thoughts, the best meditation for them is  [[anapanasati|breath meditation]]
#One who is equally and moderately disposed for all mental afflictions, they may begin with any meditation
#One with mental afflictions that are not very strong, they may also begin with any meditation

===Vajrayana===
[[Tibetan Buddhism]] uses the model of the [[Five Tathagatas|Five Buddha families]] for describing an individual's personality. Chogyam Trungpa said of this psychological model:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The buddha family or families associated with a person describe his or her fundamental style, that person's intrinsic perspective or stance in perceiving the world and working with it. Each family is associated with both a neurotic and an enlightened style. The neurotic expression of any buddha family can be transmuted into its wisdom or enlightened aspect. As well as describing people's styles, the buddha families are also associated with colors, elements, landscapes, directions, seasons-with any aspect of the phenomenal world.&lt;ref&gt;Ray, Reginald A. Secret of the Vajra World, The Tantric Buddhism of Tibet, Shambala, page 131.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The five main families are:
*Buddha family, associated with the wisdom of all encompassing space and the defilement of ignorance
*[[Vajra]] family, associated with the mirror like wisdom and the defilement of anger
*Ratna (jewel), associated with the wisdom of equanimity and the defilement of pride
*Padma (lotus), associated with the wisdom of discriminating awareness and the defilement of passion
*[[Karma]], associated with all accomplishing wisdom and the defilement of envy/paranoia

Some commentators contend that callout culture is a pernicious influence in both the academic and business worlds, citing the [[Google's Ideological Echo Chamber|controversy at Google]] over a memorandum concerning the respective vocational interests of men and women, authored by former Google engineer [[James Damore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Paresky|first1=Pamela|title=When 'Speak Out' Culture Becomes 'Callout' Culture: Welcome to the world of post-rational discourse|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/happiness-and-the-pursuit-leadership/201709/when-speak-out-culture-becomes-callout-culture|website=Psychology Today|accessdate=October 21, 2017|date=September 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other commentators have argued that callout culture can harm [[Progressivism|progressive]] politics by attacking people perceived to have exhibited prejudiced behaviour, rather than using dialogue with such people to change such behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmad, Asam. (March 2, 2015) [https://briarpatchmagazine.com/articles/view/a-note-on-call-out-culture "A Note on Call-Out Culture"]. ''[[Briarpatch]]'' Magazine. Retrieved August 3rd, 2018.  &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamad, Ruby, and Liddle, Celeste.

Not while feminists participate in pile-ons"]. ''[[The Guardian]]''. Retrieved August 3rd, 2018. &lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 essay, "Exiting the Vampire Castle", by [[Mark Fisher (theorist)|Mark Fisher]], is often cited as an early critique of call-out culture. Fisher argued that "call-out culture" created a space where "where solidarity is impossible, but guilt and fear are omnipresent". Fisher also argues that call-out
culture reduces every political issue to criticizing the behaviour of individuals, instead of dealing with such political issues through collective action. &lt;ref name="av" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Izaakson, Jen. (August 12, 2017 )[https://www.feministcurrent.com/2017/08/12/kill-normies-skewers-online-identity-politics/ ‘Kill All Normies’ skewers online identity politics]  Feminist Current. Retrieved 23 November 2018. &lt;/ref&gt;

Call-out culture found a vehicle in social media. Both as consumers and as political activists, individuals found a means to communicate to a larger crowd in an expedient and pervasive manner. While call-out culture often publicly denounces perceived acts of bigotry, as stated above, it also refers to the act of publicly calling out a larger entity (such as an organization, business or vendor) usually by means of social media. In an effort to hold these businesses or organizations accountable, individuals will take to the online forums to "call them out". Whether the individual is addressed by a representative from within the organization or not, some of these posts or tweets (depending on the medium) can go viral and cause a PR headache for the business. 

The effects of call-out culture are also noted as more prevalent today on college-campuses, where most students are aware of the social justice culture that exists and is expressed online. There are some that are careful to avoid missteps (ex: cultural appropriation by way of a Halloween costume) in order to avoid public online call-outs and others that are exploring ways to deal with past aggressors by way of call-out online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2017/05/call-out-culture-is-stressing-out-college-students/524679/|title=The Destructiveness of Call-Out Culture on Campus|last=Friedersdorf|first=Conor|date=2017-05-08|work=The Atlantic|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some people argue in defense of call-out culture and contend that it is a form of social activism. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cityartsmagazine.com/defense-call-culture/|title=In Defense of Call-out Culture|last=Scott|first=Shaun|date=February 1, 2018|work=City Arts Magazine|access-date=2018-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The individual calling someone out is ultimately trying to either stop behavior they deem to be negative or prevent it from happening again. Others argue that the call-out culture today tends to be too aggressive and can often have life-altering affects on the individual being called out. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bustle.com/p/what-does-call-in-mean-when-call-out-culture-feels-toxic-this-method-can-be-used-instead-9056343|title=This Is What It Means To Call Someone In, Instead Of Calling Them Out|last=Rodriguez-Cayro|first=Kyli|work=Bustle|access-date=2018-10-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3937">A '''Carthaginian peace''' is the imposition of a very brutal "peace" achieved by completely crushing the enemy. The term derives from the peace imposed on [[Ancient Carthage|Carthage]] by [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. After the [[Second Punic War]], Carthage lost all its colonies, was forced to demilitarize and pay a constant tribute to Rome and could enter war only with Rome's permission. At the end of the [[Third Punic War]], the Romans systematically burned Carthage to the ground and enslaved its population.

==Origin==
The term refers to the outcome of a series of wars between Rome and the [[Phoenicia]]n city of Carthage, known as the [[Punic Wars]]. The two empires fought three separate wars against each other, beginning in 264 BC and ending in 146 BC.

At the end of the [[Third Punic War]], the Romans laid siege to [[Carthage]]. When they took the city, they killed most of the inhabitants, sold the rest into [[slavery]], and destroyed the entire city. There is no ancient evidence for modern accounts that the Romans [[salting the earth|sowed the ground with salt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ridley|first1=R.T.|title=To Be Taken with a Pinch of Salt: The Destruction of Carthage|journal=Classical Philology|volume=81|issue=2|pages=140|year=1986|jstor=269786|doi=10.1086/366973 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

By extension, a Carthaginian peace can refer to any brutal peace treaty demanding total subjugation of the defeated side.

==Modern use==
Modern use of the term is often extended to any peace settlement in which the peace terms are overly harsh and designed to accentuate and perpetuate the inferiority of the loser. Thus, after [[World War I]], many (the economist [[John Maynard Keynes]] among them&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, John Maynard. ''The Economic Consequences of the Peace''. New York: Harcourt, Brace and Howe, 1920.&lt;/ref&gt;) described the [[Treaty of Versailles]] as a "Carthaginian Peace."

The [[Morgenthau Plan]] put forward after [[World War II]] has also been described as a Carthaginian peace, as it advocated the deindustrialization of Germany. It was intended to severely curb the influence of German power in the region and to prevent its remilitarization, as had occurred after World War I ([[Remilitarization of the Rhineland]]).  The Morgenthau Plan was dropped in favor of the [[Marshall Plan]] (1948–1952), which entailed the rebuilding of Western European infrastructure, particularly in West Germany. 

General [[Lucius D. Clay]], a deputy to general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and, in 1945, [[Military Governor of the U.S. Occupation Zone in Germany]], would later remark that "there was no doubt that [[JCS 1067]] contemplated the Carthaginian peace which dominated our operations in Germany during the early months of occupation. This is while the US was following the Morgenthau Plan."&lt;ref&gt;A Nation at War in an Era of Strategic Change, p.129 ([https://books.google.com/books?id=3l7U7Mgmy80C&amp;pg=PA129&amp;lpg=PA129&amp;dq=there+was+no+doubt+that+JCS+1067+contemplated+the+Carthaginian+peace+which+dominated+our+operations+in+Germany+during+the+early+months+of+occupation&amp;source=web&amp;ots=0DA1V0w7WA&amp;sig=dSd7upp-P4OlW28bBQKnsKXbBxk&amp;hl=it&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;resnum=6&amp;ct=result#PPA129,M1 Google Books])&lt;/ref&gt; Clay would later replace Eisenhower as governor and as commander-in-chief in Europe. The Marshall Plan was favored as a revival of the West German economy was considered to be necessary for the recovery of the economy of Europe. West Germany was regarded as a key bulwark against the Eastern Bloc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1187">A '''dense heterarchy''' is a [[hierarchical organization]] in [[social insect]] colonies in which the higher levels affect the lower levels and lower levels eventually influence the higher levels.  Individual [[ants]] within the colony network are likely to have many connections with one another – making the network denser and non-hierarchical.  Because there is no highest level within a heterarchy but the heterarchy itself, control is decentralized (not controlled by the queen).  Communication between individuals in a dense heterarchy occurs directly between individuals and through [[stigmergy]].

'''''Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgement of Taste''''' ({{lang-fr|'''La distinction'''}}) is a 1979 book by [[Pierre Bourdieu]], based upon the author's [[empirical research]] from 1963 until 1968. A sociological report about the state of French culture, ''Distinction'' was first published in English translation in 1984. In 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] voted ''Distinction'' as one of the ten most important sociology books of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="isa-sociology"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.isa-sociology.org/en/about-isa/history-of-isa/books-of-the-xx-century/ |title=ISA - International Sociological Association: Books of the Century|publisher=International Sociological Association|year=1998 |accessdate=2012-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Summary==
Bourdieu proposes that those with a high volume of [[cultural capital]] — non-financial social assets, such as education, which promote social mobility beyond economic means — are most likely to be able to determine what constitutes [[taste (aesthetics)|taste]] within society. Those with lower volumes of overall capital accept this taste, and the distinction of high and low culture, as legitimate and natural, and thus accept existing restrictions on conversion between the various forms of capital (economic, social, cultural). Those with low overall capital are [[social inequality|unable to access]] a higher volume of cultural capital because they lack the necessary means to do so. This could mean lacking the terminology to describe or methods of understanding classical artwork, due to features of their habitus, for example. Bourdieu asserts in this respect that 'working-class people expect objects to fulfil a function' whilst those free from economic necessities are able to operate a pure gaze separated from everyday life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Bourdieu| first= Pierre| title= Distinction | year= 1984 | publisher= [[Routledge]]|ISBN= 0-674-21277-0| pages= 5 &amp; 41}}&lt;/ref&gt; The acceptance of 'dominant' forms of taste is, Bourdieu argues, a form of 'symbolic violence'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Bourdieu| first= Pierre| last2= Wacquant| first2= Loic| title= An Invitation to Reflexive Sociology  | year= 1992 | publisher= [[Polity Press]]pages= 167}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the naturalization of this distinction of taste and its misrecognition as necessary denies the dominated classes the means of defining their own world, which leads to the disadvantage of those with less overall capital. Moreover, that even when the subordinate social classes might seem to have their own ideas about what is and what is not good taste, "the working-class ‘aesthetic’ is a dominated aesthetic, which is constantly obliged to define itself in terms of the dominant aesthetics" of the [[ruling class]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Bourdieu| first= Pierre| title= Distinction | year= 1984 | publisher= [[Routledge]]|ISBN= 0-674-21277-0| pages= 41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
The aesthetic choices of a person create ''class fractions'' (class-based social groups) and actively distance a social class from other social classes of a society. Hence, predispositions to certain kinds of food, music and art are taught and instilled in children and these class-specific (not particular nor individual) tastes help guide children to their "appropriate" social positions. Therefore, self-selection into a class fraction is achieved by impelling the child's internalization of preferences for objects and behaviors suitable for him or her as member of a given social class and also, the development of an aversion towards the preferred objects and behaviors of other social classes. In practice, when a man or a woman encounters the culture and the arts of another social class, he or she feels "disgust, provoked by horror, or visceral intolerance (‘feeling sick’) of the tastes of others."&lt;ref name=Distinction&gt;''Distinction,'' Bourdieu 1984 p 56&lt;/ref&gt;

Therefore, "[[Taste (sociology)|Taste]]" is an important example of [[cultural hegemony]], of how class fractions are determined. It's not only the possession of [[social capital]] and  economic capital, but possession of [[cultural capital]] as well. Instilling and acquiring [[cultural capital]] is used as an insidious mechanism to ensure [[social reproduction]] as well as [[cultural reproduction]] of the ruling class. Moreover, because persons are taught his and her tastes at an early age, taste is deeply internalized. Social re-conditioning for taste is very difficult. The taste instilled and acquired tends to permanently identify a person as one from a certain social class and this impedes [[social mobility]]. In this way, the [[Dominant ideology|cultural tastes]] of the dominant (ruling) class tend to dominate the tastes of the other social classes, forcing individual men and women of economically and culturally dominated classes to conform to the dominating aesthetic preferences, or risk "societal" (but in fact, fractional and domineering) disapproval —appearing crude, vulgar and tasteless.

== Methodology ==

Influenced by [[structuralism]], Bourdieu sought to go beyond the traditional reliance on [[regression analysis]] in contemporary sociology and achieve a more rigorous quantitative approach. Rather than relying on the correlation of multiple [[independent variables]], he was interested in developing a framework to allow him to view "'the complete system of relations that make up the true principle of the force and form specific to the effects recorded in such and such correlation.'" For the analysis in ''La Distinction'', Bourdieu, working with his statistical technician Salah Bouhedja, employed multiple rounds of [[correspondence analysis]] on a set of data from two surveys, the "Kodak survey" of 1963 and the "taste survey" of 1967. In addition to this analysis, Bourdieu also applied correspondence analysis to a subset of the data, the responses from what Bourdieu labelled the "dominant classes" and the "petite-bourgeoisie." This type of research represented an early attempt at [[geometric data analysis]], specifically [[multiple correspondence analysis]], which would become an important methodological framework in Bourdieu's later work.&lt;ref name="RobsonSanders2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Karen Robson|author2=Chris Sanders|title=Quantifying Theory: Pierre Bourdieu: Pierre Bourdieu|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yK1jRUCmWYgC&amp;pg=PA10|date=21 January 2009|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-9450-7|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
In 1998 the [[International Sociological Association]] voted ''Distinction'' as one of the ten most important sociology books of the 20th century, behind [[Peter L. Berger]] and [[Thomas Luckmann]]'s ''[[The Social Construction of Reality]]'' (1966), but ahead of [[Norbert Elias]]' ''[[The Civilizing Process]]'' (1939).&lt;ref name="isa-sociology" /&gt; The critic [[Camille Paglia]], writing in ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'', expressed agreement with Bourdieu's conclusion that taste depends on changing social assumptions, but suggested that it should have been obvious, and dismissed ''Distinction''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2009/01/14/obama_83/|title=Obama’s early stumbles|first=Camille |last=Paglia |date=15 January 2009 |accessdate=5 January 2017 |work=[[Salon.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecological land classification''' is a cartographical delineation or [[regionalisation]] of distinct [[ecology|ecological]] areas, identified by their [[geology]], [[topography]], [[soil]]s, [[vegetation]], [[climate]] conditions, living species, [[habitat]]s, water resources, and sometimes also [[wikt:anthropic|anthropic]] factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kellogg|first=Charles|title=A Method for the Classification of Rural Lands for Assessment in Western North Dakota|journal=The Journal of Land &amp; Public Utility Economics|date=February 1933|volume=9|issue=1|page=12|jstor=3138756}}&lt;/ref&gt; These factors control and influence biotic composition and ecological processes.

==Concept==
The expression "ecological land classification" as understood in this article, is approximate with the biogeographical and ecological regionalisations in a scientific context (see [[biogeography#biogeographic units|biogeographic units]]).

However, its actual usage is more approximate with a tool used for [[land management]], in the context of [[environmental resource management]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, M.R. 1981. ''Ecological land classification terrestrial subsystem: a basic inventory system for planning and management on the Mark Twain National Forest''. USDA Forest Service, Eastern Region. 56 pp., [https://books.google.com/books?id=AOGkpcqyS44C].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, J. C., Bestelmeyer, B. T., McClaran, M. P., Robinett, D., Briske, D. D., Wu, X. B., &amp; Fernández-Giménez, M. E. (2016). Can ecological land classification increase the utility of vegetation monitoring data?. ''Ecological Indicators'' 69: 657-666.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Canada ecological land classification schemes are commonly used.&lt;ref&gt;Wicken, E. B. 1986. ''Terrestrial ecozones of Canada. Environment Canada''. Ecological Land Classification Series No. 19. Lands Directorate, Ottawa. 26 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; Provincial authorities have adopted methods to classify [[Ecosystem|ecosystems]] within various ecoregions of the province. Ontario is one such province that uses an extensive method to define [[ecological unit]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/LUEPS/Publication/264779.html].&lt;/ref&gt; Improvements in hand held technology have allowed for more efficient collection of vegetation and physiological data in the field, such as with the ELC eTool.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ecosim.ca/ELCWebApp/ecological_land_classification/ELC_eTool.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Classification types==
Many different lists and ecological land classification schemes have been developed.&lt;ref&gt;Part of the list proposed below is inspired by [[Miklos Udvardy]] ''classification of the Biographical Provinces in the World'' which was prepared by Unesco's Man and the Biosphere program, published in 1975 and updated in 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Udvardy, M. D. F. (1975). ''A classification of the biogeographical provinces of the world''. IUCN Occasional Paper no. 18. Morges, Switzerland: IUCN, [http://cmsdata.iucn.org/downloads/udvardy.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pcap-sk.org/docs/6_skecositeguide/Ecoregions_and_Ecosites.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Biogeography]] - Biogeographical provinces take into account both flora and fauna.
*[[Phytogeography]] - from Greek words phyto = [[plant]] and [[geography]] meaning also distribution, concerned with the geographic distribution of [[plant species]].
*[[Botany]] - botanists have identified [[floristic province]]s based on [[flora]]-[[plant community|plant communities]]
*[[Zoology]] - zoologists have identified zoogeographic provinces based on [[fauna]]l communities.
*[[Conservation ethic|Conservation]] - approximating ecosystem capacity and potentials.
*[[Geology]] and [[Pedology (soil study)]] - the physical matter and energy that constitute the Earth.

=== Approaches to classifications===

American geographer [[Robert Bailey (geographer)|Robert Bailey]] defines a hierarchy of ecosystem units ranging from micro-ecosystems (individual homogeneous sites, in the order of {{convert|10|km2|0}} in area), through meso-ecosystems ([[landscape ecology|landscape mosaics]], in the order of {{convert|1000|km2|-2}}) to macro-ecosystems ([[ecoregions]], in the order of {{convert|100000|km2|-4}}).&lt;ref name="BaileyCh2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=25-28|chapter=Chapter 2}} &lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey outlined five different methods for identifying ecosystems: ''[[Holism|gestalt]]'' ("a whole that is not derived through considerable of its parts"), in which regions are recognized and boundaries drawn intuitively; a map overlay system where different layers like [[geology]], [[landform]]s and soil types are overlain to identify ecosystems; [[Cluster analysis|multivariate clustering]] of site attributes; [[digital image processing]] of [[remote sensing|remotely sensed]] data grouping areas based on their appearance or other [[Multispectral image|spectral]] properties; or by a "controlling factors method" where a subset of factors (like soils, climate, vegetation [[physiognomy]] or the [[species distribution|distribution]] of plant or animal species) are selected from a large array of possible ones are used to delineate ecosystems.&lt;ref name="BaileyCh3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecosystem Geography|last=Bailey|first=Robert G.|publisher=Springer|year=2009|isbn=978-0-387-89515-4|edition=Second|location=New York|pages=29–40|chapter=Chapter 3}} &lt;/ref&gt; 

In contrast with Bailey's methodology, Puerto Rico ecologist [[Ariel Lugo]] and coauthors identified ten characteristics of an effective classification system. For example that it be based on [[georeference]]d, quantitative data; that it should minimize subjectivity and explicitly identify criteria and assumptions; that it should be structured around the factors that drive ecosystem processes; that it should reflect the hierarchical nature of ecosystems; that it should be flexible enough to conform to the various scales at which ecosystem management operates.&lt;ref name="Lugo1999"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lugo|first=A.

Some studies&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; have found that "women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners".

There are a number of presentations that can be related to domestic violence during pregnancy: delay in seeking care for injuries; late booking, non-attenders at appointments, self-discharge; frequent attendance, vague problems; aggressive or over-solicitous partner; [[Burn (injury)|burns]], pain, tenderness, injuries; vaginal tears, bleeding, [[Sexually transmitted disease|STD]]s; and [[miscarriage]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Domestic violence against a pregnant woman can also affect the fetus and can have lingering effects on the child after birth.  Physical abuse is associated with [[neonatal death]] (1.5% versus 0.2%), and verbal abuse is associated with [[low birth weight]] (7.6% versus 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Yost, Nicole P. |author2=Bloom, Steven L. |author3=McIntire, Donald D. |author4=Leveno, Kenneth J. |title=A Prospective Observational Study of Domestic Violence During Pregnancy |journal=Obstetrics &amp; Gynecology|volume=106 |issue=1 |pages=61–65 |date=July 2005 |pmid=15994618 |doi=10.1097/01.AOG.0000164468.06070.2a |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Against men ===
Women's violence towards men is a serious social problem.&lt;ref&gt;In D.R. Loseke, R.J. Gelles &amp; M.M. Cavanaugh (Eds.), Current controversies on family violence (2nd edition, pp. 55–77). Newbury Park: Sage Publications.&lt;/ref&gt; While much attention has been focused on domestic violence against women, researchers argue that [[domestic violence against men]] is a substantial social problem worthy of attention.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, the issue of victimization of men by women has been contentious, due in part to studies which report drastically different statistics regarding domestic violence.

Some studies—typically crime studies—show that men are substantially more likely than women to use violence.&lt;ref name="Extent"&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/txtfiles1/nij/181867.txt Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence]&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies—typically family and domestic violence studies—show that men are more likely to inflict injuries, but also that when all acts of physical aggression or violence are considered in [[Aggregate data|aggregate]], women are equally violent as men,&lt;ref&gt;"A review of the research literature indicates that female intimate partner violence (IPV) is a frequent as male IPV. It is just as severe and has much the same consequences for males as for females." Donald G. Dutton."Female intimate partner violence and developmental trajectories of abusive females."

In May 2007, researchers with the [[Centers for Disease Control]] reported on rates of self-reported violence among intimate partners using data from a 2001 study. In the study, almost one-quarter of participants reported some violence in their relationships. Half of these involved one-sided ("non-reciprocal") attacks and half involved both assaults and counter assaults ("reciprocal violence"). Women reported committing one-sided attacks more than twice as often as men (70% ''versus'' 29%). In all cases of intimate partner violence, women were more likely to be injured than men, but 25% of men in relationships with two-sided violence reported injury compared to 20% of women reporting injury in relationships with one-sided violence. Women were more likely to be injured in non-reciprocal violence.&lt;ref&gt;Whitaker, D. et al. (2007) Differences in Frequency of Violence and Reported Injury Between Relationships With Reciprocal and Nonreciprocal Intimate Partner Violence. Am J Public Health. 2007 May; 97(5): 941–947. doi: 10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020, http://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/abs/10.2105/AJPH.2005.079020&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Murray A. Straus|Straus]] argues that these discrepancies between the two data sets are due to several factors. For example, Straus notes that crime studies use different methodologies than family conflict studies.&lt;ref&gt;Straus, Murray A. (1999). "The Controversy Over Domestic Violence by Women". In ''Violence in Intimate Relationships''.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Straus notes that most studies show that while men inflict the greater portion of injuries, women are ''at least'' as likely as men to shove, punch, slap or otherwise physically assault their partner, and that such relatively minor assaults often escalate to more serious assaults. Men generally do not report such assaults if asked general questions about violence or abuse; older studies frequently failed to ask about specific actions, thus falling afoul of quite different cultural gender norms for what constitutes abuse. ''Minor'' assaults perpetrated by women are also a major problem, even when they do not result in injury, because they put women in danger of much more severe retaliation by men.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

The 2000 CDC report, based on phone interviews with 8000 men and 8000 women, reported that 7.5% of men claim to have been raped or assaulted by an intimate at some time in their life (compared to 25% of women), and 0.9 percent of men claim to have been raped or assaulted in the previous 12 months (compared to 1.5% of women).&lt;ref name="Extent"/&gt;

A 2007–2008 online non-random, self-report survey of the experiences and health of men who sustained partner violence in the past year. The study showed that male victims of IPV are very hesitant to report the violence or seek help. Reasons given for non-reporting were they (1) may be ashamed to come forward; (2) may not be believed; and (3) may be accused of being a batterer when they do come forward. The 229 U.S. heterosexual men, between 18 and 59, had been physically assaulted by their female partner within previous year and did seek help. The researchers say their findings emphasize the need for prevention on all levels:

* Primary prevention: Educate public and providers that both sexes can be IPV victims
* Secondary prevention: First responders (police, hotlines, medical professionals) should take concerns seriously from all individuals (including males) seeking help
* Tertiary prevention: Rehabilitative services available to all individuals&lt;ref&gt;Denise A. Hines, Emily M. Douglas.

===Among LGB people===

Some sources state that gay and lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same frequency as heterosexual couples,&lt;ref name="Karmen"/&gt; while other sources state domestic violence among gay and lesbian couples might be higher than among heterosexual couples, that gay, lesbian, and bisexual individuals are less likely to report domestic violence that has occurred in their intimate relationships than heterosexual couples are, or that [[Domestic violence in lesbian relationships|lesbian couples experience domestic violence]] less than heterosexual couples do.&lt;ref name="Hampton"/&gt; By contrast, some researchers commonly assume that lesbian couples experience domestic violence at the same rate as heterosexual couples, and have been more cautious when reporting domestic violence among gay male couples.&lt;ref name="Fisher"&gt;{{cite book| authors=Bonnie S.

Of this sample of women, 78.2% had been in a prior relationship with a man. Reports of violence by men were all lower than reports of violence in prior relationships with women (sexual victimization, 41.9% (vs. 56.8% with women); physical victimization 32.4% (vs. 45%) and emotional victimization 55.1% (vs. 64.5%)."

When it comes to domestic violence towards children involving physical abuse, research in the UK by the [[NSPCC]] indicated that "most violence occurred at home" (78 per cent). 40—60% of men and women who abuse other adults also abuse their children.&lt;ref&gt;American Psychology Association.

=== Between teenagers ===
{{Main|Teen dating violence}}

{{Globalize/US|date=February 2015}}
Teen dating violence is a pattern of [[controlling behavior]] by one teenager over another teenager who are in a dating relationship. While there are many similarities to "traditional" domestic violence there are also some differences. Teens are much more likely than adults to become isolated from their peers as the result of controlling behavior by their boyfriend/girlfriend. Also, for many teens the abusive relationship may be their first dating experience and have never had a "normal" dating experience with which to compare it. While teenagers are trying to establish their sexual identities, they are also confronting violence in their relationships and exposure to technology. Studies document that teenagers are experiencing significant amounts of dating or domestic violence. Depending on the population studied and the way dating violence is defined, between 9 and 35% of teens have experienced domestic violence in a dating relationship. When a broader definition of abuse that encompasses physical, sexual, and emotional abuse is used, one in three teen girls is subjected to dating abuse."&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"&gt;{{cite journal|last=King-Ries|first=Andrew|title=Teens, Technology, and Cyberstalking: The Domestic Violence Wave of the Future?|journal=Texas Journal of Women and the Law|year=2011|volume=20|pages=131–164|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, a significant number of teens are victims of stalking by intimate partners. Although involvement with romantic relationships is a critical aspect of adolescence, these relationships also present serious risks for teenagers. Unfortunately, adolescents in dating relationships are at greater risk of intimate partner violence than any other age group. Approximately one third of adolescent girls are victims of physical, emotional, or verbal abuse from a dating partner. Estimates of sexual victimization range from 14% to 43% of girls and 0.3% to 36% for boys. According to the Center for Disease Control, in 2009, nearly 10% of students nationwide had been intentionally hit, slapped, or physically hurt by their boyfriend or girlfriend. Twenty-six percent of girls in a relationship reported being threatened with violence or experiencing verbal abuse; 13% reported being physically hurt or hit.&lt;ref name="King-Ries 2011 131–164"/&gt;

==Measuring==
Measures of the incidence of violence in intimate relationships can differ markedly in their findings depending on the measures used. Care is needed when using domestic violence statistics to ensure that both gender bias and under-reporting issues do not affect the inferences that are drawn from the statistics.

Some researchers, such as Michael P. Johnson, suggest that where and how domestic violence is measured also affects findings, and caution is needed to ensure statistics drawn from one class of situations are not applied to another class of situations in a way that might have fatal consequences.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060449/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13818 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers, such as David Murray Fergusson, counter that domestic violence prevention services, and statistics that they produce, target the extreme end of domestic violence and preventing child abuse rather than domestic violence between couples.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 New Zealand Family Violence Clearinghouse] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060442/http://www.nzfvc.org.nz/PublicationDetails.aspx?publication=13825 |date=September 28, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender bias===
{{weasel|date=September 2013}}
[[Statistical survey|Survey]] approaches to gathering domestic violence statistics have shown inconsistent results with regard to gender differences. Some surveys have shown comparable levels of violence by both men and women against partners, while other surveys have shown higher levels of violence by men. Approaches using data from reports of domestic violence offenses, for example, agency or hospital samples, tend to show women experiencing violence from male partners as the majority of cases (80–90%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Research based on the [[statistical survey|survey]]-based [[Conflict Tactics Scale]], a measure of intrafamily conflict and violence focusing on the adults in the family developed by Murray Straus (1979){{Clarify|date=May 2008}}, includes national surveys on the prevalence of domestic violence in the United States and other countries. These include the two U.S. National Family Violence Surveys (1975 and 1985)&lt;ref&gt;http://pubpages.unh.edu/~mas2/VB23.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000). The National Violence Against Women Survey (2000) found that women experience more intimate partner violence than do men, women experience more chronic and injurious physical assaults at the hands of intimate partners than do men, and that violence perpetrated against women by intimates is often accompanied by emotionally abusive and controlling behavior (Tjaden &amp; Thoennes, 2000).

Research based on reported domestic violence or on police records show men to be the perpetrators, and women the victims, of most reported domestic violence. However, the intervention of police may introduce a degree of gender bias into reporting. When faced with an uncertain domestic violence situation, removing one party will often defuse an altercation. Police officers may find it easier to take action against a man. This may be due to gender expectations, reinforced by previous incidents.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} . Additionally, removing the woman may entail involving other social services to care for any existing children for a time, something that may not be in the children's best interests, or may cause a significant delay. The fact that non-domestic offending is often committed by males may also influence an officer's decision.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

Police responding to a complaint may act more favorably to the complainant than other parties (though some researchers report instances where men were attacked, called the police instead of fighting back, yet were arrested themselves). Some researchers have found that women are more likely to report domestic violence to police than men are. In Ireland, 29% of female victims and 5% of male victims of domestic abuse reported the abuse to the police.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1b&gt;"[http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf 36091 NCC Doc.indd&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071203202916/http://www.gov.ie/crimecouncil/downloads/Abuse_Report_NCC.pdf |date=December 3, 2007 }}". www.gov.ie.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States, male victims are less likely than female victims to report rape, physical assault, or stalking.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;[http://www.ncjrs.gov/pdffiles1/nij/181867.pdf Extent, Nature, and Consequences of Intimate Partner Violence (NCJ 181867)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Injury and hospital admission statistics suggest that males are more frequently the perpetrators of injury causing violence.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} However, both the difference in likelihood of reporting noted above, and the relative strength difference between males and females, could be factors in this reporting bias, as males may be more likely to injure females in otherwise equivalent circumstances.

===Under-reporting===

The problem of [[under-reporting]] to police is believed to be substantial. However, estimates about how much domestic violence is not reported vary widely. It must also be remembered that a significant amount of non-domestic violence crime is also not reported to police. Depending on what statistics are chosen, anywhere between a tenth of incidents and nothing significantly less than what would be expected for any other incident are reported to police.{{Clarify|date=May 2008}}

Many crime victimization surveys, from many countries, do show that there is a correlation between the under-reporting of crime and the degree of intimacy between the victim and the offender. The degree of seriousness of offending also affects reporting, with less serious offending less likely to be reported to police. Also the nature of the offending affects reporting, with sexual offenses far less likely to be reported, even when they are serious.

== International levels ==
The [[World Conference on Human Rights]], held in Vienna in 1993, and the [[Declaration on the Elimination of Violence Against Women]] in the same year, concluded that civil society and governments have acknowledged that violence against women is a public health and human rights concern. Work in this area has resulted in the establishment of international standards, but the task of documenting the magnitude of violence against women and producing reliable, comparative data to guide policy and monitor implementation has been exceedingly difficult.

The World Health Organisation Multi-country Study on Women's Health and Domestic Violence against Women 2005 is a response to this difficulty. Published in 2005 it is a groundbreaking study which analysed data from 10 countries and sheds new light on the prevalence of violence against women. It seeks to look at violence against women a public health policy perspective. The findings will be used to inform a more effective response from government, including the health, justice and social service sectors, as a step towards fulfilling the state's obligation to eliminate violence against women under international human rights laws.

===Europe===
[[File:A Russian poster urging open your eyes - against women being abused.jpg|thumb|A Bulgarian poster urging people to open their eyes about domestic violence against women]]

The ''British Crime Survey'' for 2006–2007 reported that 0.5% of people (0.6% of women and 0.3% of men) reported being victims of domestic violence during that year and 44.3% of domestic violence was reported to the police. According to the survey, 312,000 women and 93,000 men were victims of domestic violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf Crime in England and Wales 2006/07&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091122085133/http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/rds/pdfs07/hosb1107.pdf |date=November 22, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Northern Ireland Crime Survey'' for 2005 reported that 13% of people (16% of women and 10% of men) reported being victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nio.gov.uk/experience_of_domestic_violence__findings_from_the_2005_northern_ireland_crime_survey.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-07-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070712201700/http://www.nio.gov.uk/experience_of_domestic_violence__findings_from_the_2005_northern_ireland_crime_survey.pdf |archivedate=July 12, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''National Study of Domestic Abuse'' for 2005 reported that 213,000 women and 88,000 men reported being victims of domestic violence at some point in their lives. According to the study, one in seven women and one in sixteen men were victims of severe physical abuse, severe emotional abuse, or sexual abuse.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In the United Kingdom, the police estimate that around 35% of domestic violence against women is actually reported.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}} A 2002 [[Women's Aid]] study found that 74% of separated women suffered from post-separation violence.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

====Canada====

In Canada, the Assembly of First Nations evaluation of the Canada Prenatal Nutrition Program conducted by CIET offers an inclusive and relatively unbiased national estimate. It documented domestic violence in a random sample of 85 First Nations across Canada: 22% (523/2359) of mothers reported suffering abuse in the year prior to being interviewed; of these, 59% reported physical abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Andersson N, Nahwegahbow A | year = 2010 | title = Family violence and the need for prevention research in First Nations, Inuit and Métis communities.

Results of studies which estimate the prevalence of domestic violence vary significantly, depending on specific wording of survey questions, how the survey is conducted, the definition of abuse or domestic violence used, the willingness or unwillingness of victims to admit that they have been abused and other factors. For instance, Straus (2005) conducted a study which estimated that the rate of minor assaults by women in the United States was 78 per 1,000 couples, compared with a rate for men of 72 per 1,000 and the severe assault rate was 46 per 1,000 couples for assaults by women and 50 per 1,000 for assaults by men. Neither difference is statistically significant. He claimed that since these rates were based exclusively on information provided by women respondents, the near-equality in assault rates could not be attributed to a gender bias in reporting.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"&gt;Straus, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

One analysis found that "women are as physically aggressive or more aggressive than men in their relationships with their spouses or male partners".&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; However, studies have shown that women are more likely to be injured.

A Canadian study showed that 7% of women and 6% of men were abused by their current or former partners, but female victims of spousal violence were more than twice as likely to be injured as male victims, three times more likely to fear for their life, twice as likely to be stalked, and twice as likely to experience more than ten incidents of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/07/14/domestic-violence-050714.html |title=CBC News&amp;nbsp;– Canada&amp;nbsp;– Domestic violence rate unchanged, Statistics Canada finds |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=July 14, 2005 |accessdate=2010-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Straus notes that Canadian studies on domestic violence have simply excluded questions that ask men about being victimized by their wives.&lt;ref name="Straus, 2005"/&gt;

According to a 2004 survey in Canada, the percentages of males being physically or sexually victimized by their partners was 6% versus 7% for women. However, females reported higher levels of repeated violence and were more likely than men to experience serious injuries; 23% of females versus 15% of males were faced with the most serious forms of violence including being beaten, choked, or threatened with or having a gun or knife used against them. Also, 21% of women versus 11% of men were likely to report experiencing more than 10 violent incidents. Women who often experience higher levels of physical or sexual violence from their current partner, were 44%, compared with 18% of men to suffer from an injury. Cases in which women are faced with extremely abusive partners, results in the females having to fear for their lives due to the violence they had faced. In addition, statistics show that 34% of women feared for their lives, and 10% of men feared for theirs.&lt;ref name=grady&gt;O'Grady William (2011).

Victims of DV are offered legal remedies, which include the criminal law, as well as obtaining a [[protection order]]. The remedies offered can be both of a civil nature (civil orders of protection and other protective services) and of a criminal nature (charging the perpetrator with a criminal offense). People perpetrating DV are subject to criminal prosecution, most often under assault and [[Battery (crime)|battery]] laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theiacp.org/portals/0/pdfs/ProtectingVictimsOfDV.pdf|title=Protecting Victims of Domestic Violence (U.S.)|publisher=U.S. Department of Justice / International Association of Chiefs of Police |accessdate=2014-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Gaussian adaptation (GA)''' (also referred to as normal or natural adaptation and sometimes abbreviated as NA) is an [[evolutionary algorithm]] designed for the maximization of manufacturing yield due to statistical deviation of component values of [[signal processing]] systems. In short, GA is a stochastic adaptive process where a number of samples of an ''n''-dimensional vector ''x''[''x''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'')] are taken from a [[multivariate Gaussian distribution]], ''N''(''m'',&amp;nbsp;''M''), having mean ''m'' and [[covariance matrix|moment matrix]] ''M''. The samples are tested for fail or pass. The first- and second-order moments of the Gaussian restricted to the pass samples are ''m*'' and&amp;nbsp;''M*''.

The outcome of ''x'' as a pass sample is determined by a function ''s''(''x''), 0&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''s''(''x'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;1, such that ''s''(''x'') is the probability that x will be selected as a pass sample. The average probability of finding pass samples (yield) is

:&lt;math&gt; P(m) = \int s(x) N(x - m)\, dx &lt;/math&gt;

Then the theorem of GA states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;For any ''s''(''x'') and for any value of ''P&amp;nbsp;''&lt;&amp;nbsp;''q'', there always exist a Gaussian p. d. f. [ [[probability density function]] ] that is adapted for maximum dispersion. The necessary conditions for a local optimum are ''m''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''m''* and ''M'' proportional to ''M''*. The dual problem is also solved: ''P'' is maximized while keeping the dispersion constant (Kjellström, 1991).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Proofs of the theorem may be found in the papers by Kjellström, 1970, and Kjellström &amp; Taxén, 1981.

Since dispersion is defined as the exponential of entropy/disorder/[[average information]] it immediately follows that the theorem is valid also for those concepts. Altogether, this means that Gaussian adaptation may carry out a simultaneous maximisation of yield and [[average information]] (without any need for the yield or the [[average information]] to be defined as criterion functions).

'''The theorem is valid for all regions of acceptability and all Gaussian distributions'''. It may be used by cyclic repetition of random variation and selection (like the natural evolution). In every cycle a sufficiently large number of Gaussian distributed points are sampled and tested for membership in the region of acceptability. The centre of gravity of the Gaussian, ''m'', is then moved to the centre of gravity of the approved (selected) points, ''m''*. Thus, the process converges to a state of equilibrium fulfilling the theorem. A solution is always approximate because the centre of gravity is always determined for a limited number of points.

It was used for the first time in 1969 as a pure optimization algorithm making the regions of acceptability smaller and smaller (in analogy to [[simulated annealing]], Kirkpatrick 1983). Since 1970 it has been used for both ordinary optimization and yield maximization.

==Natural evolution and Gaussian adaptation==
It has also been compared to the natural evolution of populations of living organisms. In this case ''s''(''x'') is the probability that the individual having an array ''x'' of phenotypes will survive by giving offspring to the next generation; a definition of individual fitness given by Hartl 1981. The yield, ''P'', is replaced by the [[mean fitness]] determined as a mean over the set of individuals in a large population.

Phenotypes are often Gaussian distributed in a large population and a necessary condition for the natural evolution to be able to fulfill the theorem of Gaussian adaptation, with respect to all Gaussian quantitative characters, is that it may push the centre of gravity of the Gaussian to the centre of gravity of the selected individuals. This may be accomplished by the [[Hardy–Weinberg law]]. This is possible because the theorem of Gaussian adaptation is valid for any region of acceptability independent of the structure (Kjellström, 1996).

In this case the rules of genetic variation such as crossover, inversion, transposition etcetera may be seen as random number generators for the phenotypes. So, in this sense Gaussian adaptation may be seen as a genetic algorithm.

==How to climb a mountain==
Mean fitness may be calculated provided that the distribution of parameters and the structure of the landscape is known. The real landscape is not known, but figure below shows a fictitious profile (blue) of a landscape along a line (x) in a room spanned by such parameters. The red curve is the mean based on the red bell curve at the bottom of  figure. It is obtained by letting the bell curve slide along the ''x''-axis, calculating the mean at every location. As can be seen, small peaks and pits are smoothed out. Thus, if evolution is started at A with a relatively small variance (the red bell curve), then climbing will take place on the red curve. The process may get stuck for millions of years at B or C, as long as the hollows to the right of these points remain, and the mutation rate is too small.

[[Image:Fraktal.gif]]

If the mutation rate is sufficiently high, the disorder or variance  may increase and the parameter(s) may become distributed like the green bell curve. Then the climbing will take place on the green curve, which is even more smoothed out. Because the hollows to the right of B and C have now disappeared, the process may continue up to the peaks at D. But of course the landscape puts a limit on the disorder or variability. Besides &amp;mdash; dependent on the landscape &amp;mdash; the process may become very jerky, and if the ratio between the time spent by the process at a local peak and the time of transition to the next peak is very high, it may as well look like a [[punctuated equilibrium]] as suggested by Gould (see Ridley).

==Computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation==
Thus far the theory only considers mean values of continuous distributions corresponding to an infinite number of individuals. In reality however, the number of individuals is always limited, which gives rise to an uncertainty in the estimation of ''m'' and ''M'' (the moment matrix of the Gaussian). And this may also affect the efficiency of the process. Unfortunately very little is known about this, at least theoretically.

The implementation of normal adaptation on a computer is a fairly simple task. The adaptation of m may be done by one sample (individual) at a time, for example

: ''m''(''i'' + 1) = (1 – ''a'') ''m''(''i'') + ''ax''

where ''x'' is a pass sample, and ''a'' &lt; 1 a suitable constant so that the inverse of a represents the number of individuals in the population.

''M'' may in principle be updated after every step ''y'' leading to a feasible point

: ''x'' = ''m'' + ''y'' according to:

: ''M''(''i'' + 1) = (1 – 2''b'') ''M''(''i'') + 2''byy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,

where ''y''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; is the transpose of ''y'' and ''b'' &lt;&lt; 1 is another suitable constant. In order to guarantee a suitable increase of [[average information]], ''y'' should be [[normal distribution|normally distributed]] with moment matrix ''μ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''M'', where the scalar ''μ'' &gt; 1 is used to increase [[average information]] ([[information entropy]], disorder, diversity) at a suitable rate. But ''M'' will never be used in the calculations. Instead we use the matrix ''W'' defined by ''WW''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; = ''M''.

Thus, we have ''y'' = ''Wg'', where ''g'' is normally distributed with the moment matrix ''μU'', and ''U'' is the unit matrix. ''W'' and ''W''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; may be updated by the formulas

: ''W'' = (1 – ''b'')''W'' + ''byg''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;   and   ''W''&lt;sup&gt;''T''&lt;/sup&gt; = (1 – ''b'')''W''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt; + ''bgy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;

because multiplication gives

: ''M'' = (1 – 2''b'')''M'' + 2''byy''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;,

where terms including ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have been neglected. Thus, ''M'' will be indirectly adapted with good approximation. In practice it will suffice to update ''W'' only

: ''W''(''i'' + 1)  = (1 – ''b'')''W''(''i'') + ''byg''&lt;sup&gt;T&lt;/sup&gt;.

This is the formula used in a simple 2-dimensional model of a brain satisfying the Hebbian rule of associative learning; see the next section (Kjellström, 1996 and 1999).

The figure below illustrates the effect of increased [[average information]] in a Gaussian p.d.f. used to climb a mountain Crest (the two lines represent the contour line). Both the red and green cluster have equal mean fitness, about 65%, but the green cluster has a much higher [[average information]] making the green process much more efficient. The effect of this adaptation is not very salient in a 2-dimensional case, but in a high-dimensional case, the efficiency of the search process may be increased by many orders of magnitude.

==The evolution in the brain==
In the brain the evolution of DNA-messages is supposed to be replaced by an evolution of signal patterns and the phenotypic landscape is replaced by a mental landscape, the complexity of which will hardly be second to the former. The metaphor with the mental landscape is based on the assumption that certain signal patterns give rise to a better well-being or performance. For instance, the control of a group of muscles leads to a better pronunciation of a word or performance of a piece of music.

In this simple model it is assumed that the brain consists of interconnected components that may add, multiply and delay signal values.
* A nerve cell kernel may add signal values,
* a synapse may multiply with a constant and
* An axon may delay values.
This is a basis of the theory of digital filters and neural networks consisting of components that may add, multiply and delay signalvalues and also of many brain models, Levine 1991.

In the figure below the brain stem is supposed to deliver Gaussian distributed signal patterns. This may be possible since certain neurons fire at random (Kandel et al.). The stem also constitutes a disordered structure surrounded by more ordered shells (Bergström, 1969), and according to the [[central limit theorem]] the sum of signals from many neurons may be Gaussian distributed. The triangular boxes represent synapses and the boxes with the + sign are cell kernels.

In the cortex signals are supposed to be tested for feasibility. When a signal is accepted the contact areas in the synapses are updated according to the formulas below in agreement with the Hebbian theory. The figure shows a 2-dimensional computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation according to the last formula in the preceding section.

[[Image:Schematic of a neural network executing the Gaussian adaptation algorithm.GIF]]

''m'' and ''W'' are updated according to:

: ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''x''1;   ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

: ''w''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;    ''w''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

: ''w''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;21&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;;    ''w''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.9 ''w''&lt;sub&gt;22&lt;/sub&gt; + 0.1 ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''g''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;;

As can be seen this is very much like a small brain ruled by the theory of [[Hebbian learning]] (Kjellström, 1996, 1999 and 2002).

Gaussian adaptation as an evolutionary model of the brain obeying the [[Hebbian theory]] of associative learning offers an alternative view of [[free will]] due to the ability of the process to maximize the mean fitness of signal patterns in the brain by climbing a mental landscape in analogy with phenotypic evolution.

Such a random process gives us lots of freedom of choice, but hardly any will. An illusion of will may, however, emanate from the ability of the process to maximize mean fitness, making the process goal seeking. I. e., it prefers higher peaks in the landscape prior to lower, or better alternatives prior to worse. In this way an illusive will may appear. A similar view has been given by Zohar 1990. See also Kjellström 1999.

==A theorem of efficiency for random search==
The efficiency of Gaussian adaptation relies on the theory of information due to Claude E. Shannon (see [[information content]]). When an event occurs with probability ''P'', then the information &amp;minus;log(''P'') may be achieved. For instance, if the mean fitness is ''P'', the information gained for each individual selected for survival will be &amp;minus;log(''P'') – on the average - and the work/time needed to get  the information is proportional to 1/''P''. Thus, if efficiency, E, is defined as information divided by the work/time needed to get it we have:

: ''E'' = &amp;minus;''P'' log(''P'').

This function attains its maximum when ''P'' = 1/''e'' = 0.37. The same result has been obtained by Gaines with a different method.

''E'' = 0 if ''P'' = 0, for a process with infinite mutation rate, and if ''P'' = 1, for a process with mutation rate = 0 (provided that the process is alive).
This measure of efficiency is valid for a large class of [[random search]] processes provided that certain conditions are at hand.

1  The search should be statistically independent and equally efficient in different parameter directions. This condition may be approximately fulfilled when the moment matrix of the Gaussian has been adapted for maximum [[average information]] to some region of acceptability, because linear transformations of the whole process do not affect efficiency.

2   All individuals have equal cost and the derivative at ''P'' = 1 is &lt;&amp;nbsp;0.

Then, the following theorem may be proved:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All measures of efficiency, that satisfy the conditions above, are asymptotically proportional to –''P'' log(''P/q'') when the number of dimensions increases, and are maximized by ''P'' = ''q'' exp(-1) (Kjellström, 1996 and 1999).&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Image:Efficiency.GIF]]

The figure above shows a possible efficiency function for a random search process such as Gaussian adaptation. To the left the process is most chaotic when ''P'' = 0, while there is perfect order to the right where ''P'' = 1.

In an example by Rechenberg, 1971, 1973, a random walk is pushed thru a corridor maximizing the parameter ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. In this case the region of acceptability is defined as a (''n''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)-dimensional interval in the parameters ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, but a ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-value below the last accepted will never be accepted. Since ''P'' can never exceed 0.5 in this case, the maximum speed towards higher ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-values is reached for ''P'' = 0.5/''e'' = 0.18, in agreement with the findings of Rechenberg.

A point of view that also may be of interest in this context is that no definition of information (other than that sampled points inside some region of acceptability gives information about the extension of the region) is needed for the proof of the theorem. Then, because, the formula may be interpreted as information divided by the work needed to get the information, this is also an indication that &amp;minus;log(''P'') is a good candidate for being a measure of information.

==The Stauffer and Grimson algorithm==
Gaussian adaptation has also been used for other purposes as for instance shadow removal by "The Stauffer-Grimson algorithm" which is equivalent to Gaussian adaptation as used in the section "Computer simulation of Gaussian adaptation" above. In both cases the maximum likelihood method is used for estimation of mean values by adaptation at one sample at a time.

But there are differences. In the Stauffer-Grimson case the information is not used for the control of a random number generator for centering, maximization of mean fitness, [[average information]] or manufacturing yield. The adaptation of the moment matrix also differs very much as compared to "the evolution in the brain" above.

'''Giving What We Can''' ('''GWWC''') is an [[effective altruism]] associated organization whose members pledge to give 10% of their income to effective charities. It was founded at [[Oxford University]] in 2009 by the ethics researcher [[Toby Ord]].

==History==

Giving What We Can was founded as a giving society in 2009 by [[Toby Ord]], an ethics researcher at [[Oxford]], his wife Bernadette Young, a physician in training at the time, and fellow ethicist [[William MacAskill]] &lt;ref name=GuardianExtreme/&gt;&lt;ref name=Singer2015&gt;{{cite book|last1=Singer|first1=Peter|title=The Most Good You Can Do: How Effective Altruism is Changing Ideas about Living Ethically|date=2015|publisher=Yale University Press|isbn=9780300180275|page=18|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GriFBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
with the goal of encouraging people to give 10% of their income on a regular basis to alleviate world poverty.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8360098.stm | title = Academic pledges to give away £1m | date = 14 November 2009 | publisher = BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is similar to [[zakat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Unthinkable?

Would you give up a luxury to save a life?|date = 8 January 2013|publisher = ''[[New Statesman]]''|last = Gill|first = Martha}}&lt;/ref&gt; and personally planned to give away everything above about $28,000 a year, the median after-tax salary in the U.K.&lt;ref name=wsj2011/&gt; His focus was on [[effective altruism|effective giving]], meaning that he emphasized donations to charities which saved a maximal amount of life per donation amount.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Geoghegan|first1=Tom|title=Toby Ord: Why I'm giving £1m to charity|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/magazine-11950843|work=BBC News|date=13 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
GWWC was launched with 23 members.&lt;ref name=wsj2011/&gt; People who joined signed a pledge to give away 10% of their income to any organization they thought could best address poverty in the developing world, and could pledge more; there was no penalty for quitting.&lt;ref name="sundaytimes"&gt;{{cite news | title = Take My Money, I Don't Want It | author = Richard Woods | newspaper = The Sunday Times | date = 15 November 2009 | url = http://www.theaustralian.com.au/life/take-my-money-i-dont-want-it/news-story/353d39b9c4fcf37099babd323a4cc9a6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2011 it had 177 members, mostly other academics, in five chapters including [[Oxford]], [[Cambridge]], [[Princeton University|Princeton]], and [[Harvard]].&lt;ref name=wsj2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rustin|first1=Susanna|title=The Saturday interview: Toby Ord and Bernadette Young on the joy of giving|url=https://www.theguardian.com/theguardian/2011/dec/24/toby-ord-bernadette-young-joy-of-giving|work=The Guardian|date=23 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2012 the group had 264 people from 17 countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/uk_news/People/article1173041.ece|title = Oxford don sparks flood of charity cash|last = Hellen|first = Nicholas|date = 9 December 2012|publisher = ''[[The Sunday Times]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and it surpassed 1,000 members in 2015.&lt;ref name=GuardianExtreme&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacFarquhar|first1=Larissa|title=Extreme altruism: should you care for strangers at the expense of your family?|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/sep/22/extreme-altruism-should-you-care-for-strangers-as-much-as-family|work=The Guardian|date=22 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2011 the organization was providing its members regular reports on what charities were most effective at addressing poverty in the developing world,&lt;ref name=wsj2011&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/news/articles/SB10001424052970204528204577010061347756838|title = Small Sacrifice, Big Return|last = Espinoza|first = Javier|date = 28 November 2011|publisher = ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at that time was recommending a tropical diseases group and a de-worming group that each worked in Africa.&lt;ref name="Mathieson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mathieson|first1=S.

In 2011 a sister organization was spun off from Giving from What We Can at Oxford by MacAskill and others called "High Impact Careers" which encouraged people to pursue high-paying jobs so they could give more money away.&lt;ref name=Ceasefire2011/&gt;  Both organizations conducted outreach and recruiting at Oxford.&lt;ref name=Ceasefire2011&gt;{{cite web | title = Helping the poor…by getting rich: ingenious or delusional?| url = http://ceasefiremagazine.co.uk/giving-high-impact-careers-debate/ | publisher = Ceasefire Magazine| date = 24 November 2011|last=Younis|first=Musab}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cutterham|first1=Tom|title=The Ethical Careers Debate|journal=Oxford Left Review|date=May 2012|issue=7|page=4|url=https://oxfordleftreview.files.wordpress.com/2012/07/issue-7.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hamlett|first1=Claire|title=The Philosophy of Giving|journal=Philosophy Now|date=July–August 2012|issue=91|url=https://philosophynow.org/issues/91/The_Philosophy_of_Giving}}&lt;/ref&gt; High Impact Careers was soon renamed to [[80,000 Hours]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shade|first1=Robbie|title=80,000 Hours is launched!|url=http://rjshade.com/2011/11/22/80000-Hours/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170318035201/http://rjshade.com/2011/11/22/80000-Hours/|archivedate=18 March 2017|date=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 the two organizations incorporated the Centre for Effective Altruism as a nonprofit to serve as an umbrella organization.&lt;ref name=Singer2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Centre for Effective Altruism|url=https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/07962181|publisher=UK Companies House|accessdate=18 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research ==
{{see also|Charity evaluator}}

Giving What We Can conducts research to determine which charities it recommends for members and other people to support. It differs from other charity evaluators in terms of the importance given to metrics of charity performance. While evaluators such as [[Charity Navigator]] use the fraction of donations spent on program expenses versus administrative overhead as an important indicator, Giving What We Can solely focuses on the cost-effectiveness of the charity's work.&lt;ref name="rosenberg nyt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ethical Consumer"&gt;{{cite web|title=Charities in the ethical spotlight|url=http://www.ethicalconsumer.org/commentanalysis/factsvgreenwash/charitiesandtheirsocialandenvironmentalperformance.aspx|website=www.ethicalconsumer.org|publisher=Ethical Consumer|accessdate=18 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It believes that the variance in cost-effectiveness of charities arises largely due to the variance in the nature of the causes that the charities operate in, and therefore makes evaluations across broad areas of work such as health, education, and emergency aid before comparing specific organizations.&lt;ref name="gwwc-methodology"&gt;{{cite web|title=How We Assess Charities|url=https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/about-us/how-we-assess-charities|website=Giving What We Can|accessdate=18 March 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In practice, it recommends a selected few charities in the area of [[global health]]. Its work is therefore similar to that of [[GiveWell]].&lt;ref name="Mathieson" /&gt;

'''Global Youth Service Day''' ('''GYSD'''), originally launched and known as '''National Youth Service Day''' in the United States, is a coordinated annual event which gathers [[youth|young people]] around the world in conducting [[community service]], [[service learning]], and [[youth voice]] activities that benefit their communities, their countries, and the world. Activities are organized in more than 100 countries each April to help mark the celebrations, and engage millions, making it the largest annual celebration of young volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usmayors.org/usmayornewspaper/documents/01_14_02/natl_youth.asp "National Youth Service Day"], U.S. Conference of Mayors.

Speaking about Global Youth Service Day, [[Jane Goodall]] commented, "I have often said that every individual counts, every individual has a role to play, and every individual makes a difference. Global Youth Service Day proves it." [[Kofi Annan]] said that, "Volunteers are some of our most valued partners, and Global Youth Service Day celebrates the efforts of the youngest of them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gysd.org/press/ Press Room], Global Youth Service Day.

'''''Going postal''''' is an [[American English]] [[slang]] phrase referring to becoming extremely and uncontrollably angry, often to the point of violence, and usually in a workplace environment. The expression derives from a series of incidents from 1986 onward in which [[United States Postal Service]] (USPS) workers shot and killed managers, fellow workers, and members of the police or general public in acts of [[mass murder]]. Between 1970 and 1997, more than 40 people were killed by current or former employees in at least 20 incidents of [[workplace rage]]. Between 1986 and 2011, workplace shootings happened at roughly two per year, with an average of 12 people killed per year.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.asisonline.org/globalassets/foundation/documents/crisp-reports/crisp_mass-homicides-by-employees-american-workplace.pdf|title=Mass Homicides by Employees in the American Workplace|last=Lee|first=Seungmug|last2=McCrie|first2=Robert|date=2012|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
The earliest known use of the phrase was on December 17, 1993, in the ''[[Tampa Bay Times|St. Petersburg Times]]'':

{{quote|The symposium was sponsored by the U.S. Postal Service, which has seen so many outbursts that in some circles excessive stress is known as 'going postal.' Thirty-five people have been killed in 11 post office shootings since 1983. The USPS does not approve of the term "going postal" and has made attempts to stop people from using the saying. Some postal workers, however, feel it has earned its place.&lt;ref name="vick"&gt;Vick, Karl, "Violence at work tied to loss of esteem", ''St. Petersburg Times'', Dec 17, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On December 31, 1993, the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stated:

{{quote|Unlike the more deadly mass shootings around the nation, which have lent a new term to the language, referring to shooting up the office as "going postal".&lt;ref&gt;"The Year in Review 1993", ''Los Angeles Times'', December 31, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Edmond, Oklahoma, 1986===
On August 20, 1986, during the [[Edmond post office shooting]], 14 employees were shot and killed and six were wounded at the [[Edmond, Oklahoma]], post office by [[Patrick Sherrill]], a postman who then committed [[suicide]] with a shot to the forehead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0PLP/is_2_35/ai_n17209169| title= On August 20, 1986, a part-time letter carrier named Patrick H.

===Ridgewood, New Jersey, 1991===
A former United States postal worker, Joseph M. Harris, killed his former supervisor, Carol Ott, and killed her boyfriend, Cornelius Kasten Jr., at their home.  The following morning, on October 10, 1991, Harris shot and killed two mail handlers, Joseph M. VanderPaauw, 59, of [[Prospect Park, New Jersey]], and Donald McNaught, 63, of [[Pompton Lakes, New Jersey]], at the [[Ridgewood, New Jersey|Ridgewood]] Post Office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/11/nyregion/4-slain-in-2-new-jersey-attacks-and-former-postal-clerk-is-held.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm | work=The New York Times | first=Robert | last=Hanley | title=4 Slain in 2 New Jersey Attacks And Former Postal Clerk Is Held | date=October 11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/a-former-postal-worker-commits-mass-murder| title=

===Royal Oak, Michigan, 1991===
[[File:RoyalOakPostoffice.JPG|thumb|right|300px|The U.S. post office in Royal Oak]]

On November 14, 1991 in [[Royal Oak, Michigan]], Thomas McIlvane killed five people, including himself, with a rifle in Royal Oak's post office, after being fired from the Postal Service for "insubordination." He had been previously suspended for getting into altercations with postal customers on his route.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

For some time prior to the Royal Oak incident the service had experienced labor/management and operational problems and customer service complaints. This had drawn the attention of local media. The Office of Senator Carl Levin investigated Royal Oak, the results of which were summarized in a September 10, 1991, staff memorandum. The memorandum documented "patterns of harassment, intimidation, cruelty and allegations of favoritism in promotions and demotions ... [and] testimony relating to wide-ranging delivery and service problems" prior to the McIlvane shooting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?isbn=1462820409|title=The Tainted Eagle|last=Withers|first=Charlie|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A post office tragedy:the shooting at Royal Oak, report of the Committee on Post Office and Civil Service, House of Representatives, 102 Congress, {{ISBN|9780160386589}}"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two events in 1993===
Two shootings took place on the same day, May 6, 1993, a few hours apart. At a post office in [[Dearborn, Michigan]], Lawrence Jasion wounded three and killed one, and subsequently killed himself. In [[Dana Point, California]], Mark Richard Hilbun killed his mother and her dog, then shot two postal workers dead.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory K. Moffatt, Blind-Sided: Homicide Where It Is Least Expected, at 37 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt;
As a result of these two shootings, in 1993 the  USPS created 85 Workplace Environment Analysts for domicile at its 85 postal districts. These new positions were created to help with violence prevention and workplace improvement. In February 2009, the   USPS unilaterally eliminated these positions as part of its downsizing efforts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Musacco|first=Stephen|title=Beyond going postal: Shifting from workplace tragedies and toxic workplace environments to a safe and healthy organization|year=2009|publisher=Booksurge|page=34|quote=the notion of 'going postal' as a myth is not supported by the overwhelming evidence to the contrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Goleta, California, 2006===
[[Jennifer San Marco]], a former postal employee, killed six postal employees before committing suicide with a [[handgun]], on the evening of January 30, 2006, at a large postal processing facility in [[Goleta, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/01/national/01postal.html?_r=1&amp;oref=slogin |title=Ex-Employee Kills 6 Others and Herself at California Postal Plant |date=2006-02-01 |work=The New York Times |first1=John |last1=Holusha |first2=Randal C. |last2=Archibold |accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Police later also identified a seventh victim dead in a condominium complex in Goleta where San Marco once lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory?id=1565649 |title=Death Toll in Calif.

This incident is believed to be the deadliest workplace shooting ever carried out in the [[United States]] by a woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/US/01/31/postal.shooting |title=Seven dead in California postal shooting |work=CNN |date=2006-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/4665790.stm |title=US ex-postal employee kills six |date=2006-01-31 |accessdate=January 4, 2010 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baker City, Oregon, 2006===
Grant Gallaher, a letter carrier in [[Baker City, Oregon]], pleaded guilty to the April 4, 2006 murder of his supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aeA4AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=vhQGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1870,1355376&amp;dq=grant-gallaher&amp;hl=en|title=Gallaher Sentenced in Baker County Circuit Court|date=August 16, 2006|work=Hells Canyon Journal|page=3|accessdate=19 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He reportedly brought his [[.357 Magnum]] revolver to the city post office with the intention of killing his postmaster. When he arrived at the parking lot, he reportedly ran over his supervisor several times. He then went into the post office looking for his postmaster. Not finding him, he went back out to the parking lot and shot his supervisor.&lt;ref name="bakerCity"&gt;http://www.bakercityherald.com/csp/mediapool/sites/BakerCityHerald/LocalNews/story.csp?cid=4122312&amp;sid=818&amp;fid=151&lt;/ref&gt; Gallaher was on a new route for three weeks and had felt pressured by a week-long work-time study and extra time added to his new route.&lt;ref name="bakerCity"/&gt;

===San Francisco, California, 2017===

On June 14, 2017, [[San Francisco UPS shooting#cite note-LAT-170615-1|Jimmy Lam]], 38, fatally shot three coworkers at a [[United Parcel Service]] (UPS) facility in the [[Potrero Hill]] neighborhood of [[San Francisco, California]]. Lam then shot and killed himself as police arrived at the facility. Two others were wounded by gunfire, and three people were injured while escaping.

===Columbus, Ohio, 2017===
Postal worker DeShaune Stewart murdered two colleagues, his supervisor and the postmaster, on December 23, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2017/12/24/ohio-postal-workers-slayings-stun-friends-family-members.html|date=December 24, 2017|work=Fox News|accessdate=30 December 2017|title=Enraged naked postal worker goes on killing spree, police say}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Analysis==
Researchers have found that the homicide rates at postal facilities were lower than at other workplaces. In major industries, the highest rate of 2.1 homicides per 100,000 workers per year was in retail. The homicide rate for postal workers was 0.22 per 100,000 versus 0.77 per 100,000 workers in general.&lt;ref&gt;[http://permanent.access.gpo.gov/lps12068/33994.pdf Permanent.access.gpo.gov ''Report of The United States Postal Service Commission On A Safe And Secure Workplace'' August 2000]&lt;/ref&gt; The common depiction of an employee returning to work for revenge on his boss is overdone.  More than half of mass workplace shooting are by current employees, and a little under a quarter are by employees who have been at their job for less than a year.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 1998, the [[United States Congress]] conducted a joint hearing to review the violence in the U.S. Postal Service. In the hearing, it was noted that despite the postal service accounting for less than 1% of the full-time civilian labor force, 13% of workplace homicides were committed at postal facilities by current or former employees.&lt;ref&gt;Musacco, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural impact==
In the controversial video game series ''[[Postal (video game series)|Postal]]'', the player takes on the role of an insane mass murderer in the first game, and in the later series a first-person role performing normally mundane chores (such as picking up a paycheck from work) with an often gratuitously violent twist.  In 1997, the USPS sued the creators of the game, [[Running With Scissors (company)|Running With Scissors]], over the use of the term "postal".  Running With Scissors argued that, despite its title, the game has absolutely nothing to do with the USPS or its employees. The case was dismissed [[Prejudice (legal term)|with prejudice]] in 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calvert|first=Justin|title=Postal court case dismissed|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-court-case-dismissed/1100-6030580/|accessdate=25 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 comedy film ''[[Naked Gun 33⅓: The Final Insult]]'' includes a scene where the main character must deal with a series of escalating threats, including the sudden appearance of dozens of disgruntled postal workers randomly firing weapons in every direction.

The 1995 film ''[[Clueless (film)|Clueless]]'' is credited with popularizing the phrase "going postal" and is responsible for the term's casual usage still today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Skeels|first=Virginia|title=The cast of Clueless reunites|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/tvshowbiz/article-2213701/The-cast-Clueless-reunites-remembering-Brittany-Murphy.html|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors in the film had no idea what it meant to "go postal," since it was an uncommon phrase at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lang|first=Nico|title=25 Little-Known Facts About Clueless|url=http://thoughtcatalog.com/nico-lang/2012/11/25-little-known-facts-about-clueless/|accessdate=5 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The title of the 2004 book ''[[Going Postal]]'' by [[Terry Pratchett]] makes reference to the contents of the novel, but in future novels of the [[Discworld]] universe characters use the term "going postal" in the common sense, apparently referring to the events of ''Going Postal''.

As referenced on the Simpsons, during Episode "Sunday Cruddy Sunday", Bart and Lisa visit the post office and Nelson asks:
* '''Nelson:''' Have you ever gone on a killing spree?
* '''Postmaster Bill:''' (laughing) Ho ho ho, nooo noo, the day of the gun toting disgruntled postman shooting up the place went out with the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]].

In the ''[[Brooklyn Nine-Nine]]'' episode ''[[USPIS (Brooklyn Nine-Nine)|USPIS]]'', a self-righteous [[United States Postal Inspection Service]] agent passionate about his job is adamant that "going postal" is the term most associated with bringing goodness into people's lives, which is a view also shared by his co-workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vulture.com/2014/11/brooklyn-nine-nine-recap-season-2-ed-helms-uspis.html|access-date=August 7, 2018|title=Brooklyn Nine-Nine Recap: Going Postal|first=Allie|last=Pape}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
The term is derived from the English{{efn|Some of this information originated in a Dutch Wiki article, translated to English, then supplemented by other sources.}} word "horn" and refers to the [[Sign of the horns|devil's horns]]. This is in contrast to the word halo and the [[halo effect]], based on the concept of a [[Halo (religious iconography)|saint's halo]].

In a 1920 study published by Thorndike&lt;ref name=ThornD&gt;{{Citation | last = Thorndike | first = EL 
| title= A constant error in psychological ratings
| journal = Journal of Applied Psychology | year= 1920|volume=4|issue=1
|pages=25–29|doi= 10.1037/h0071663}}&lt;/ref&gt; that focused on the halo effect, it was noted that "ratings were apparently affected by a marked tendency to think of the person in general as rather good or rather inferior {{efn|(SIC,inFerior)}} and to color the judgments of the qualities by this general feeling".{{efn|Although not popularizing the actual term Horn effect.}}

===Alternate terminology===
It is sometimes called the ''horns effect'',&lt;ref name=Attitudes/&gt; ''reverse-halo effect'', or ''devil effect''.

==Bias in action==
The horn effect occurs when "individuals believe that negative traits are connected to each other."&lt;ref name=JoshKennon/&gt; It is a phenomenon in which an observer's judgment of a person is adversely affected by the presence of (for the observer) an unfavorable aspect of this person.
* ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote of the devil effect in relation to [[Hugo Chavez]]: "Some leaders can become so demonized that it's impossible to assess their achievements and failures in a balanced way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Glennie|first=Jonathan
|title=Hugo Chávez's reverse-halo effect|url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/poverty-matters/2011/may/03/hugo-chavez-reverso-halo-effect |newspaper=The Guardian|date=3 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The relation of crime to attractiveness is also subject to the halo effect. A study presented two hypothetical crimes: a [[burglary]] and a [[confidence trick|swindle]]. The burglary involved a woman illegally obtaining a key and stealing $2,200; the swindle involved a woman manipulating a man to invest $2,200 in a nonexistent corporation.  The results showed that when the offense was not related to attractiveness (as in the burglary) the unattractive defendant was punished more severely than the attractive one. However, when the offense was related to attractiveness (the swindle), the attractive defendant was punished more severely than the unattractive one.  The study imputes that the usual leniency given to the attractive woman (as a result of the halo effect) was negated or reversed when the nature of the crime involved her looks.&lt;ref name = "ostrove_sigall1975"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ostrove|first1 =Nancy| last2 =Sigall | first2 = Harold|title = Beautiful but Dangerous: Effects of Offender Attractiveness and Nature of the Crime on Juridic Judgment | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1975|volume=31|issue=3|pages=410–14

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9825">'''Hyperfocus''' is an intense form of [[mind|mental]] [[attention|concentration]] or [[creative visualization|visualization]] that focuses [[consciousness]] on a subject, topic, or task.  In some individuals, various subjects or topics may also include [[daydream]]s, [[concept]]s, [[fiction]], the [[imagination]], and other [[object of the mind|objects of the mind]]. Hyperfocus on a certain subject can cause side-tracking away from  assigned or important tasks.

Hyperfocus may bear a relationship to the concept of [[Flow (psychology)|flow]].&lt;ref name="webb"&gt;{{citation |first1=James T. |last1=Webb |first2=Edward R. |last2=Amend |first3=Nadia E. |last3=Webb |first4=Jean |last4=Goerss |first5=Paul |last5=Beljan |first6=F.

In gifted children without ADD/ADHD, this rapt and productive attention state is described by Csikszentmihalyi (1990) as ‘flow.’ … What has been coined ‘hyperfocus’ in persons with ADD/ADHD seems to be a less medical-sounding description of perseveration. Thus the apparent ability to concentrate in certain limited situations does not exclude the diagnosis of ADD/ADHD. }}&lt;/ref&gt; In some circumstances, both flow and hyperfocus can be an aid to achievement, but in other circumstances or situations, the same focus and behavior could be a liability, distracting from the task at hand. However, unlike hyperfocus, "flow" is often described in more glowing terms, suggesting they are not two sides of the same condition under contrasting circumstance or intellect.

== Confusion with perseveration (as a clinical symptom) ==

Hyperfocus may in some cases also be symptomatic of a [[Psychiatry|psychiatric]] condition. In these cases, it is more commonly and accurately&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; referred to as [[perseveration]]—an inability or impairment in switching tasks or activities ("[[Task switching (psychology)|set-shifting]]"),&lt;ref name="priory"&gt;[http://priory.com/gloss.htm#perseveration Priory psychiatric glossary]&lt;/ref&gt; or desisting from mental or physical response repetition (gestures, words, thoughts) despite absence or cessation of a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]],&lt;ref name="Dict Bio Psych"&gt;{{Citation | contribution=Perseveration | year=2001 | title=Dictionary of Biological Psychology | editor-last=Winn | editor-first=Philip | page=595 | isbn=9780415136068 | publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis | contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UbL2MZ9xI7oC&amp;pg=PA595#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Helm-Estabrooks"&gt;{{vcite journal |author=Helm-Estabrooks N |title=The problem of perseveration |journal=Semin Speech Lang |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=289–90 |year=2004 |pmid=15599818 |doi=10.1055/s-2004-837241 |url=http://www.thieme-connect.com/ejournals/html/ssl/doi/10.1055/s-2004-837241 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PC def"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/encyclopedia/2008/perseveration/ |website=Psych Central |title=Perseveration |last=Grinnell |first=Renée |year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Di def"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/perseveration Dictionary.com definition]&lt;/ref&gt; and which is not excessive in terms of quantity but are apparently both functionless and involve a narrow range of behaviours, and are not better described as [[stereotypy]] (a highly repetitive [[idiosyncrasy|idiosyncratic]] behaviour).

Conditions associated with perseveration include neurodevelopmental disorders, particularly those considered to be on the [[autism spectrum]] (especially [[Asperger syndrome]]), and [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD). In the latter, it is informally but probably incorrectly called "hyperfocus"&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt; and may be a coping mechanism or a symptom of self-regulation impairment—as well as people who are  [[twice exceptional|both intellectually gifted and suffer a learning disability]] who may have either or both of hyperfocus and perseverative behaviours.&lt;ref name="webb" /&gt;  Other conditions involving dysfunction or disregulation within the frontal lobe could also theoretically have similar effects.

It is typical for individuals with [[ADHD]] to say they 1), cannot focus on boring things and 2), can only focus on stimulating things,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goodin|first1=Kate|title=Famous People with ADHD|url=http://www.parenting.com/gallery/famous-people-with-add-or-adhd?page=16|website=Parenting|publisher=Meredith Corporation|accessdate=2013-08-22|quote=David Neeleman, Founder of JetBlue Airways … reported in an interview with ADDitude magazine his ADHD prevents him from being detail-oriented and completing doing day-to-day tasks, saying, ‘I have an easier time planning a 20-aircraft fleet than I do paying the light bill.’}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''that focus is often extreme''. Thus, it is both a concentration deficit and over-concentration, or generically: "hyperfocus." More concisely, some types of ADHD are a difficulty in ''directing'' one's attention, (an [[executive function]] of the [[frontal lobe]]), ''not'' a lack of attention.&lt;ref&gt;2012 Burnett Lecture [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NUQu-OPrzUc Video, Part 1 of 3, Keynote Speaker: Russell A.

M. &amp; Dodd, D. K. (1998).  GUTI: A measure of urgent task involvement among adults with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder.  Psychological Reports, 82, 592-594.&lt;/ref&gt; found that adults with self-reported ADHD scored higher than normal adults on self-reported ability to hyperfocus on "urgent tasks" such as last-minute projects or preparations. Adults in the ADHD group were uniquely able to postpone eating, sleeping and other personal needs and stay absorbed in the "urgent task" for an extended time.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

Clinical conditions unlikely to be confused with hyperfocus often involve repetition of thoughts or behaviors such as [[obsessive–compulsive disorder]] (OCD), [[PTSD|trauma]],&lt;ref name="differential"&gt;{{cite web |first=James Robert |last=Brasic |title=Pediatric Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder Differential Diagnoses |date=9 July 2012 |website=Medscape Reference |url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1826591-differential}}&lt;/ref&gt; and some cases of [[traumatic brain injuries|traumatic brain injury]].&lt;ref name="priory" /&gt;

{{Distinguish|text = a [[secret trial]], whose existence is unknown to the public}}

'''''In camera''''' ({{IPAc-en|ɪ|ŋ|ˈ|k|æ|m|r|ə|,_|-|m|ə|r|ə}}; [[Latin]]: "in a chamber")&lt;ref name=uscourts&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.uscourts.gov/Common/Glossary.aspx | title = Glossary | publisher = USCourts.gov }}.&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[law| legal]] term that means ''in private''.&lt;ref name = Amo /&gt; The same meaning is sometimes expressed in the English equivalent: '''''in chambers'''''. Generally, ''in-camera'' describes [[court]] cases, parts of it, or process where the public and press are not allowed to observe the procedure or process.&lt;ref name= Amo&gt;{{Citation | first = Eugene | last = Ehrlich | title = Amo, Amas, Amat and More | page = 151 | ISBN = 0-06-272017-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  ''In-camera'' is the opposite of [[trial]] [[in open court]] where all parties and witnesses testify in a public [[courtroom]], and [[Lawyer|attorneys]] publicly present their arguments to the [[trier of fact]].

==''In camera'' hearings during trials==
Entire cases may be heard ''in-camera'' when, for example, matters of [[national security]] are involved. ''In-camera'' review by a judge may be used during otherwise open trials—for example, to protect trade secrets or where one party asserts privilege (such as [[attorney–client privilege]]d communications).  This lets the judge review documents in private to determine if revelation of documents in open court will be allowed.

In United States courts in-camera review describes a process or procedure where a judge privately looks at confidential, sensitive, or private information to determine what, if any, information may be used by a party or made public. An ''in camera review'' may be at someone's request (such as counsel in the case), or by order of the court. 

An example of "in-camera review" by the court: a defendant prosecuted for the alleged murder of a high school student asserts his was an act of self-defense, a last resort after the deceased physically assaulted the defendant. Witnesses tell investigators and lawyers that the victim "was always getting into fights in school" and frequently had to visit the principal's office. The defendant seeks to obtain the deceased's high school files to see if there's anything proving the deceased fighting at school. A party for the deceased's family might argue against disclosure on the basis that school records which are presumably private should not be provided to the defendant. While a judge might acknowledge the general presumption, the court might permit the defendant limited use at trial any school records that may establish the deceased's physically aggressive tendencies. 

In this example, before allowing disclosure of files to the defendant, or for revelation of the records to the jury, the judge would "in camera" inspect the deceased's high school records to determine what records, if any, the judge will release to the defendant. Note: The judge has complete authority on an in-camera review. The judge may disallow use of some or all of the records reviewed, limit use or purpose, and to order a party to take all steps necessary to keep private and confidential the information released. 

==Non-legal definitions==
''In-camera'' can also describe closed board meetings that cover information not recorded in the minutes or divulged to the public. Such sessions may discuss personnel, financial, or other sensitive decisions that must be kept secret (e.g., a proposed merger or strategic change the organization does not want disclosed to competitors). It can also apply to diplomatic and political affairs, such as during the American [[Constitutional Convention (United States)|Constitutional Convention]] in 1787 when the drafting of the [[Constitution of the United States]] was discussed in such strict privacy so delegates could negotiate in full confidence that they were free to reconsider particular positions as necessary without embarrassment or political repercussions with their constituents. 

''In camera'' may also mean the portion of a graduate level thesis examination that includes only the examining committee and the student.  This follows a presentation by the student that the public may attend.

'''James Francis Cauty''' (born 19 December 1956), also known as '''Rockman Rock''', is an English artist and musician, best known as one half of the duo [[The KLF]], co-founder of [[The Orb]] and as the man who [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|burnt one million pounds]].

Cauty was married to Cressida (née Bowyer), with whom he has twins, Daisy and Harry, and a younger son, Alfie.&lt;ref name="trash"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=384|title=Library of Mu - Trash Art &amp; Kreation|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later married artist and musician [[Alannah Currie]] (formerly of [[Thompson Twins]]) in 2011.

==Early career==
Cauty was born on the [[Wirral Peninsula]] in [[Cheshire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.findmypast.co.uk/results/world-records/england-and-wales-births-1837-2006?firstname=james+f&amp;lastname=cauty+&amp;eventyear=1956&amp;eventyear_offset=1|title=findmypast.co.uk|website=Search.findmypast.co.uk|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a 17-year-old artist, he drew a popular ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' poster (and later, a counterpart based on ''[[The Hobbit]]'') for British retailer [[Athena (retailer)|Athena]],&lt;ref&gt;"The KLF", ''[[Western Mail (Wales)|Western Mail]]'' ([[Cardiff]]), 4 March 2005, p29.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the cover for the [[concept album]] ''[[The King of Elfland's Daughter (album)|The King of Elfland's Daughter]]''.

In 1981-2 Cauty was guitarist in a band called Angels 1–5, who recorded a [[Peel session]] on 1 July 1981.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/radio1/johnpeel/sessions/1980s/1981/Jul01angels15/|title=BBC - Radio 1 - Keeping It Peel - 01/07/1981 Angels 1 - 5|website=Bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lead vocalist was [[Cressida Cauty|Cressida Bowyer]], whom Cauty later married. He then joined the band [[Brilliant (band)|Brilliant]] with which he remained until its break-up in 1986. Cauty was also an original member of [[Zodiac Mindwarp and the Love Reaction]], in 1985.

==Artistic partnership with Bill Drummond, 1987–1995, 1997==
Cauty joined with [[Bill Drummond]] to form [[The Justified Ancients of Mu Mu]] (The JAMs), a collaboration that played out in various guises and media over much of the next decade.

As an [[A&amp;R]] man, Drummond had signed Brilliant to [[Warner Music Group|WEA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/brilliant-mn0000627485/biography|title=Brilliant - Biography &amp; History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concocting a scheme for a hip-hop record on New Year's Day 1987, Drummond needed a like-minded collaborator with expertise in current music technology, and so contacted Cauty. Drummond later commented that Cauty "knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'", said Drummond. A week later, The JAMs had recorded their debut single, "[[All You Need Is Love (The JAMs song)|All You Need Is Love]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 1]] "Story of Pop" documentary interview with Bill Drummond. First BBC broadcast believed to have been in [http://open.bbc.co.uk/catalogue/infax/series/STORY+OF+POP late 1994], and was transmitted by Australian national broadcaster [[Citadel Media|ABC]] on [http://www.abc.net.au/rn/pop/default.htm 1 January 2005]. Transcript taken from the [http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 KLF FAQ] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060427020752/http://www.klf.de/faq/index.php?cate_id=1 |date=27 April 2006 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; Several singles and three albums as The JAMs followed (their debut, ''[[1987 (What the Fuck Is Going On?)|1987]]''; the follow-up, ''[[Who Killed The JAMs?]]''; and compilation ''[[Shag Times]]'') before a change of direction saw the duo mutate into dance and ambient music pioneers, [[The KLF]]. Along the way, the duo scored their first British number one hit single as [[The Timelords]] with the [[Gary Glitter]]/[[Doctor Who|Dr. Who]] novelty-pop [[Mashup (music)|mash-up]] "[[Doctorin' the Tardis]]", claimed to be sung by Cauty's 1968 [[Ford Galaxie]] American [[police car]].

The KLF released two albums, ''[[Chill Out]]'' and ''[[The White Room]]'', and a string of top 5 singles, becoming the biggest selling singles act in the world in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.allmusic.com/artist/the-klf-mn0000074853/biography|title=The KLF - Biography &amp; History|website=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, suddenly and very publicly, The KLF retired from the music industry and deleted their entire back catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;KLF Communications advertisement in ''[[New Musical Express]]'', 16 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="select92"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=315|title=Library of Mu - Who Killed The KLF?|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=309|title=Library of Mu - Timelords gentlemen, please!|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drummond and Cauty re-emerged in 1993 as the [[K Foundation]], releasing one limited edition single ("[[K Cera Cera]]")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=356|title=Library of Mu - Yasser, they can boogie!|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and awarding the £40,000 [[K Foundation art award]] for the "worst artist of the year".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=364|title=Library of Mu - K Foundation tries to turn the art world on its head|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the duo courted infamy by [[K Foundation Burn a Million Quid|setting fire to one million pounds in cash]] on the Scottish island of [[Jura, Scotland|Jura]].&lt;ref name="Reid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=387|title=Library of Mu - Money To Burn|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, they undertook a screening tour of a film of the burning,&lt;ref&gt;Banks-Smith, Nancy, "From cash to ash", ''[[The Guardian]]'' ([[Manchester]]), 30 August 1995, page T.009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=400|title=Library of Mu - WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; before signing a moratorium on K Foundation activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=519|title=Library of Mu - Cape Wrath|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cauty worked with Drummond again in 1997 with a campaign to "[[Fuck the Millennium]]", the highlight of which was a 23-minute live performance satirising the "pop comeback", in which Cauty and Drummond appeared as grey-haired pensioners and wheeled around the stage in electric wheelchairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=439|title=Library of Mu - JUSTIFIED AND (VERY) ANCIENT?|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout The KLF's career, Drummond was most often the mouthpiece of the group and is regularly mistakenly viewed as their chief protagonist but in fact Cauty was just as instrumental in developing ideas and actions in the duo as is evident in his practice as an individual artist. As described by the ''[[NME]]'' their joint and individual work displays "honesty mixed with deranged publicity-seeking, pop terrorism ideas mixed with utter strangeness and mysticism..., and a sense that the things pop groups do should be visionary and above all should not be mundane."&lt;ref name="TateTat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=359|title=Library of Mu - TATE TAT AND ARTY|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cauty's wife at the time, Cressida, also helped out, taking on an organisational role for KLF Communications,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=506|title=Library of Mu - K.L.F. INFO SHEET 6. (AUG/SEPT. 89.)|first=Stuart|last=Young|website=Libraryofmu.net|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in addition to design and choreography work for The KLF, and her own work as an artist.&lt;ref name="trash" /&gt;

==Ambient house, 1988–1992==
In the late 1980s, Cauty met [[Alex Paterson]] and the duo began DJ-ing and producing together as [[The Orb]]. Paterson and Cauty's first release was a 1988 [[acid house]] anthem track, "Tripping on Sunshine" released on the German record compilation ''[[Eternity Project One]]''.&lt;ref name="rough"&gt;{{cite book|last=Shapiro|first=Peter|title=The Rough Guide to Drum 'n' Bass|authorlink=Peter Shapiro (journalist)|year=1999|isbn=1-85828-433-3|publisher=[[Rough Guides]]|pages=327–29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, The Orb released the ''[[Kiss (The Orb EP)|Kiss EP]]'', a four-track [[Extended play|EP]] based on samples from New York City's [[WEPN-FM|Kiss FM]].&lt;ref name="rough"/&gt; It was released on Paterson and Glover's new record label [[WAU/Mr. Modo Records]], which Paterson and Glover created out of a desire to maintain financial independence from larger record labels.&lt;ref name="century"&gt;{{cite book|last=Prendergast|first=Mark |title=The Ambient Century: From Mahler to Moby-The Evolution of Sound in the Electronic Age |publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing PLC]]|year=2003|isbn=1-58234-323-3|pages=407–12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After spending a weekend of making what Paterson described as "really shit drum sounds", the duo decided to abandon beat-heavy music and instead work on music for after-hours listening by "taking the bloody drums away".&lt;ref name="keyboard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Doerschuck|first=Robert|work=[[Keyboard Magazine]]|date=June 1995|title=Inside the Ambient Techno Ultraworld}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paterson and Cauty began DJ-ing in London and landed a deal for The Orb to play the [[Chill-out music|chill-out]] room at London nightclub [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]]. Resident DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]] brought in the duo specifically as ambient DJs for his "The Land of Oz" event at Heaven.&lt;ref name="irish-boyd"&gt;{{cite news|work=[[The Irish Times]]|last=Boyd|first=Brian|date=23 October 1998|page=12|title=Unidentified Flying Orb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Though initially The Orb's Monday night performances had only several "hard-core" followers, their "Chill Out Room" act grew popular over the course of their six-month stay at Heaven to the point that the small room was often packed with around 100&amp;nbsp;people.&lt;ref name="ocean"&gt;{{cite book|last = Toop|first = David|authorlink = David Toop|title=Ocean of Sound|publisher=Serpent's Tail|pages=59–62|year=2001|isbn = 1-85242-743-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb's performances became especially popular among weary DJs and clubbers who sought solace from the loud, rhythmic music of the dancefloor.&lt;ref name="amg-orb"&gt;{{cite web|url={{Allmusic|class=artist|id=p5071/biography|pure_url=yes}} |title=The Orb Biography |accessdate=2006-10-09 |last = Bush |first = John |website=[[AllMusic]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb would build up melodies using [[multitrack recording]]s linked to multiple [[record deck]]s and a [[mixing console|mixer]]. They incorporated many CDs, cassettes, and [[BBC Radiophonic Workshop|BBC sound effects]] into their act, often accompanied with pieces of popular dance tracks such as "[[Sueño Latino]]".&lt;ref name="ocean"/&gt; Most often, they played [[Dub music|dub]] and other [[chill out music]] which Bill Drummond described as "Ambient house for the E generation."&lt;ref name="rough"/&gt;&lt;ref name="metropolis"&gt;{{cite web|last=Crispy|first=Don|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/590/clubs.asp|title=Alex Paterson|publisher=''[[Metropolis (Japanese magazine)|Metropolis]]''|accessdate=20 January 2018|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070704194423/http://metropolis.co.jp/tokyo/590/clubs.asp|archivedate=4 July 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 1989, Paterson, Cauty, [[Bill Drummond|Drummond]] and [[Martin Glover]] developed the musical genre of [[ambient house]] through the use of a diverse array of [[sampling (music)|samples]] and recordings. The culmination of Cauty and Paterson's musical work came towards the end of the year when The Orb recorded a session for [[John Peel]] on [[BBC Radio 1]]. The track, then known as "Loving You", was largely improvisational and featured a wealth of sound effects and samples from science fiction radio plays, nature sounds, and [[Minnie Riperton]]'s "Lovin' You".&lt;ref name="amg-peel"&gt;{{cite web|website=[[AllMusic]]|last=Thompson|first=Dave|accessdate=20 January 2018|url={{Allmusic|class=album|id=r14521|pure_url=yes}}|title=Peel Sessions Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Orb changed the title to "[[A Huge Ever Growing Pulsating Brain That Rules from the Centre of the Ultraworld]]". In 1990, Cauty and Drummond held a [[Chill-out music|chillout]] party at [[Trancentral]], a recording of Patersons DJing was made with a view to releasing it as an LP but the mix contained many uncleared samples and other records and was unusable. Later that year Cauty and Drummond went to the isle of [[Jura, Scotland]] to record a techno record called Gate. Instead they created a long form ambient film called [[The KLF films|Waiting (1990)]]. During the same year Cauty and Drummond went into the studio and made the ambient LP ''[[Chill Out]]''.&lt;ref name="generation"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reynolds|first=Simon|year=1999|isbn=0-415-92373-5|publisher=Routledge|title=Generation Ecstasy: Into the World of Techno and Rave Culture|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[The Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove Dictionary]]'' suggests ''Chill Out'' to be the first ambient house album.&lt;ref name="grove"&gt;{{GroveOnline|title=Ambient house|author=Fulford-Jones, Will|access-date=4 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

When offered an album deal by Big Life, The Orb found themselves at a crossroads. Cauty preferred that albums by The Orb were released on his [[KLF Communications]] label, whereas Paterson wanted to ensure The Orb did not become an offshoot of The KLF.&lt;ref name="times-waves"&gt;{{cite news|title=Don't make negative waves|last=Toop|first=David|authorlink=David Toop |date=3 June 1994|work=[[The Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to these issues, Cauty and Paterson split in April 1990, with Paterson keeping the name ''The Orb''.&lt;ref name="amg-orb"/&gt; Cauty removed Paterson's contributions from the recordings in progress and released the album as ''[[Space (Jimmy Cauty album)|Space]]'' on [[KLF Communications]].&lt;ref name="klfcomm"&gt;{{cite press release|title=KLF Communications Info Sheet Nine|publisher=[[KLF Communications]]|year=1990|url=http://www.libraryofmu.net/display-resource.php?id=509|accessdate=9 October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-KLF==
In 1999 Cauty produced several remixes under the alias The Scourge of the Earth for artists such as [[Placebo (band)|Placebo]], [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]], [[Hawkwind]], [[Ian Brown]], [[The Orb]] etc. In December 1999 he joined with [[Guy Pratt]] to record and release a mobile telephone-themed novelty-pop record "[[I Wanna 1-2-1 With You]]" under the name Solid Gold Chartbusters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Solid+Gold+Chartbusters|title=Solid Gold Chartbusters|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was released as competition for the Christmas Number One but only got to 62. In 2001, Cauty joined with former collaborators Alex Paterson and Guy Pratt in a London recording studio, together with Dom Beken, an associate of Pratt.&lt;ref name="Official"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transitkings.com/TransitKings/WaitingRoom.html|title=HugeDomains.com - TransitKings.com is for sale (Transit Kings)|website=Transitkings.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Recording later continued in Cauty's [[Brighton]] studio. In 2003, the group released their first single, "Boom Bang Bombay", under the name Custerd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/artist/Custerd|title=Custerd|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, they settled on the name "[[Transit Kings]]". Cauty left the band in 2004 to work on other projects. In 2006, the Transit Kings released their debut album, ''[[Living in a Giant Candle Winking at God]]''; Cauty is listed as a composer on 7 of the album's 12 tracks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.discogs.com/release/763820|title=Transit Kings - Living In A Giant Candle Winking At God|website=Discogs.com|accessdate=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Cauty's two remixes of U2's "New York" were featured as B-sides on the band's [[Electrical Storm (song)|Electrical Storm]] single. Until mid-2005, together with [[James Fogarty]] and Keir Jens-Smith, he was part of art/music collective [[Blacksmoke]].{{cn|date=January 2018}}

==Art==
Cauty works with the [[L-13 Light Industrial Workshop]], London which he explains "is not a gallery, it’s a support system, spiritual home and technical epicentre for a small group of artists"&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Marco. [http://www.proceso.com.mx/457586/la-pequena-insurreccion-cauty "La pequeña insurrección de Cauty."], ''[[Proceso (magazine)]]'', 5 October 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; which includes ''[[Billy Childish]]'', ''[[Jamie Reid]]'' and Harry Adams. Cauty first worked in conjunction with L-13 on the Cautese Nationál Postal Disservice. Subsequent collaborations included the Riot In A Jam Jar exhibitions and the ADP Riot Tour - is a vast 1:87 scale model in a 40-foot shipping container which tours historic riot sites around the world. L-13 continue to collaborate with Cauty and Drummond, running "dead perch merch", official merchandise operatives to The JAMs.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

Following 2003 media speculation that Saddam Hussein could launch a poison chemical attack on London, Cauty designed the Stamps of Mass Destruction for [[Blacksmoke]] Art Collective. The 1st, 2nd and 3rd class stamps featuring the Queen's head wearing a gas mask were released as limited edition prints and exhibited at Artrepublic Gallery, Brighton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artrepublic.com/biographies/35-james-cauty.html|title=James Cauty|work=artrepublic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a legal battle over alleged copyright infringement, the stamps were sent to [[Royal Mail]] for destruction.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/southern_counties/2963414.stm Row Over Gas Masked Queen], [[BBC News]], 4 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Left, Sarah. [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2003/jun/04/post.artsfeatures Royal Mail Stamps Down on Postage Art], [[The Guardian]], 4 June 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Cauty installed a gift shop, ''Blackoff'', at the Aquarium Gallery, based on the government's ''Preparing for Emergencies'' leaflet.  The installation included "terror aware" items, such as "terror tea towels", "attack hankies" and "bunker-buster jigsaw puzzles" (missing one piece). He commented, "The gift shop becomes the place we can explore our branding ideas, Cash for trash – it represents the futility and the glory of it all."&lt;ref&gt;Arendt, Paul.[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,1353862,00.html "The art that stole Christmas"], ''[[The Guardian]]'', 18 November 2004; retrieved 1 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Cauty Operation Magic Kingdom billboard, Old Street, 2007.jpg|thumb|James Cauty artwork Operation Magic Kingdom bombed onto billboard in Old Street, 2007]]In response to the [[Iraq War troop surge of 2007]], Cauty developed Operation Magic Kingdom, a series of images showing US forces in Iraq wearing masks of lovable and friendly Disney characters, adopting the UK’s "winning hearts and minds" tactics in a bid to gain the confidence of the Iraqi people. In Operation Magic Kingdom "the rules of engagement have been changed to include "try and be more fun" before firing." &lt;ref&gt;Cauty, James. [http://jamescauty.com/work/operation-magic-kingdom/ "Operation Magic Kingdom press release"], [[The Aquarium L-13|The Aquarium]], April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The images were launched at the Bayswater Road Sunday Art Exhibition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bayswater-road-artists.co.uk|title=bayswater road artists|work=bayswater road artists}}&lt;/ref&gt; bombed onto billboards and flyposted across London, as well as being released by [[The Aquarium L-13|The Aquarium]] as limited edition prints and stamps.{{cn|date=January 2018}}

In June 2011 he held a public exhibition at L-13 entitled ''A Riot in a Jam Jar'' consisting primarily of a series of [[Scale model|scale]] [[diorama]]s depicting violent confrontations between British rioters and police, each contained within an inverted glass jar.{{cn|date=January 2018}} In 2012,  Cauty premiered his short film, Believe the Magic, starring [[Debbie Harry]], Nick Lehan and [[Branko Tomović]], at [[Tate Modern]] as part of the annual Merge festival.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mergefestival.co.uk/artists/believe-the-magic-by-jimmy-cauty.html Believe The Magic], Merge Festival Programme, 30 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.film-news.co.uk/show-news.asp?nItemID=18426 Jimmy Cauty's 'Believe the Magic' trailer starring Debbie Harry], film-news.co.uk, 6 April 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ideas of A Riot in a Jam Jar evolved into the Aftermath Dislocation Principle, shown at the Hoxton Arches in October 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Pilger, Zoe.[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/reviews/art-review-james-cauty-the-aftermath-dislocation-principle-parts-i-and-ii-8874179.html "Art review: James Cauty, The Aftermath Dislocation Principle Parts I and II"], [[The Independent]], 11 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 448 square foot installation at 1:87 scale (representing approximately one square mile) details the desolate and charred aftermath of what appears to have been a devastating riot. The sculpture, constructed by modifying components of traditional model railway kits, took approximately 8 months to complete includes nearly 3,000 police figures and a soundtrack pitched to match the 1:87 scale. The piece "makes a political statement about societal freedom and state control".&lt;ref&gt;Tucker, Johnny.[http://www.designcurial.com/news/devil-in-the-detail-4157979/ "Devil in the Detail: James Cauty's Dystopia in Miniature"], [[Blueprint (architecture magazine)]], 10 January 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The Aftermath Dislocation principle then toured the Netherlands, being shown at Piet Hein Eek Gallery, Eindhoven (November 2013),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pietheineek.nl/nl/kunstgalerie/james-cauty|title=Piet Hein Eek|work=pietheineek.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cultuurwerf, Vlissingen (April 2014),&lt;ref&gt;[http://cultuurwerf.nl/expos/james-cauty-the-aftermath-dislocation-principle/ "James Cauty the Aftermath Dislocation Principle"], cultuurwerf.nl; accessed 20 January 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; and Mediamatic, Amsterdam (July–August 2014).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mediamatic.net/370219/en/opening-the-aftermath-dislocation-principle "Opening: The Aftermath Dislocation Principle – A Disaster Tour with Jimmy Cauty"], Mediamatic, 10 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Cauty released a series of limited edition Smiley Riot Shields. The shields are all ex-police riot gear which have been painted over with a yellow smiley face.

'''Leon Schidlowsky''' ([[Hebrew]]: ליאון שידלובסקי; born 21 July 1931 in [[Santiago de Chile]]) is a Chilean-Israeli composer and painter. He has written music for [[orchestra]], chamber ensemble, [[choir]], and instruments including the [[piano]], [[violin]], [[cello]], [[flute]], [[mandolin]], [[guitar]], [[harp]], [[organ (music)|organ]], as well as about sixty-five pieces of music with [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]]. His compositions have been performed in numerous countries with different orchestras under conductors such as [[Aldo Ceccato]], [[Errico Fresis]], [[Clytus Gottwald]], [[Juan Pablo Izquierdo]], [[Erhard Karkoschka]], [[Herbert Kegel]], [[Lukas Foss]], [[Zubin Mehta]], [[Hermann Scherchen]], and [[Ingo Schulz]]. The scores of his graphic music have been shown in various exhibitions linked to concerts, such as in the [[Staatsgalerie Stuttgart]], [[Kunsthaus Hamburg]], the [[Wilhelm-Hack-Museum]], [[Ludwigshafen]], and the [[Stadtgalerie Saarbrücken]].

==Biography==
Schidlowsky pursued his secondary studies at the [[Instituto Nacional]] de Chile in Santiago from 1940–47 and studied the piano with [[Roberto Duncker]] at the [[Conservatorio Nacional]] de Chile in [[Santiago (Chile)|Santiago]] from 1942-48. He later studied composition with [[Juan Allende-Blin]] and [[Fré Focke]], as well as [[philosophy]] and [[psychology]] at the [[Universidad de Chile]] in Santiago from 1948-51. He completed his studies in Germany at the Nordwestdeutsche Musikakademie (later [[Hochschule für Musik Detmold]]) in [[Detmold]], where he met his future wife Susanne, whom he married in 1953. They had five children (David, Elias, Judith, and twins Yuval and Noam).

==Chile (1954-1968; 2014)==
After his return to Chile in 1954 Leon Schidlowsky became a member of the avant-garde ensemble [[Grupo Tonus]] in Santiago and served as its director from 1958&amp;ndash;61. This ensemble wanted to spread avant-garde and contemporary music in Chile. In 1956 Schidlowsky produced "Nacimiento", considered the first [[Electroacoustic music|electroacoustic]] work composed in Latin America. Between 1956 and 1959 he was member of the [[British Council]] and between 1956 and 1961 a musical adviser of the pantomime ensemble [[Grupo Noisvander]]. He served as director of the music library at the [[Instituto de Extensión Musical]], of the Universidad de Chile (Chilean University) in 1961-62, and as secretary-general of the [[Asociación Nacional de Compositores]] from 1961-63. He also served as director-general of the [[Instituto de Extensión Musical]], Universidad de Chile, from 1962-66. In this period the Institute achieved distinction, with the performance of music that had never been played in Chile before, and with the performance of at least one work by a Chilean composer every year. Besides that, a number of orchestral conductors, soloists, and foreign orchestras visited Chile and made a substantial contribution to the musical culture of the country.

In 1964 he was, together with [[Luigi Dallapiccola]] and [[Alberto Ginastera]], a member of the jury in a composers' competition in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. The same year he took part in the music symposium "Latin America and the music of our time" (América Latina y la música de nuestros tiempos) in [[Lima]], [[Peru]]. In 1965, Schidlowsky was appointed Professor of Composition at the [[Conservatorio Nacional]], Universidad de Chile (Chilean University). In 1966 he participated in the Inter-American Festival in [[Washington, D.C.]], USA, as well as the Festival Interamericano de Música in [[Caracas]], Venezuela. In 1967, he took part in the Festival of Music from [[Spain]] and Latin America, in [[Madrid]], Spain. He participated in the "Festival of the Three Worlds" in [[Mérida, Mérida|Mérida]], Venezuela in 1968, with lectures and discussions with the composers [[Krzyztof Penderecki]] and [[Luigi Nono (composer)|Luigi Nono]]. The city of Mérida nominated him a "Distinguished Guest of the City". In the same year he received a Fellowship from the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation]] in order to write an [[opera]], which he completed in Germany.

On 21 August 2014 Leon Schidlowsky was awarded the Chilean [[National Prize for Musical Arts (Chile)|National Prize for Musical Arts]], accompanied  by several homages, press articles and interviews in the local press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.latercera.com/noticia/leon-schidlowsky-obtiene-el-premio-nacional-de-artes-musicales/ |title=León Schidlowsky obtiene el Premio Nacional de Artes Musicales |trans-title=León Schidlowsky Gets the National Prize for Musical Arts |author=J. L. F. |work=[[La Tercera]] |language=Spanish |date=21 August 2014 |access-date=12 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israel==
In 1969, he was appointed Professor for Composition and Music Theory at the [[Samuel Rubin Academy of Music]] at [[Tel Aviv University]]. In 1979 he was granted a Sabbatical Year, which he spent in Hamburg. He has given many conferences in Berlin, [[Hamburg]] and [[Stuttgart]] (Germany), [[Vienna]] ([[Austria]]), [[Lund]] ([[Sweden]]), and [[Saragossa]] (Spain). Schidlowsky received several fellowships from the Deutscher Akademischer Austauschdienst (DAAD), and stayed in [[Berlin]] for various periods, where he composed and painted. During one of these sojourns, in 1999, his wife Susanne died; she was buried in [[Tel Aviv]]. Leon Schidlowsky received various prizes for his music, such as at the regular Festivals of Chilean Music ([[Festivales de Música Chilena]]), with works of his being awarded the Chilean Prize [[CRAV]]. In 1996 he received the First Prize for his work ''Absalom'' in the 60th anniversary competition of the [[Israel Philharmonic Orchestra]].

In 2000 he was awarded the [[Society of Authors, Composers and Music Publishers in Israel|ACUM]] Prize for his entire oeuvre by the [[Israel Composers Association]]. In the following year, during a visit to Chile, the [[Chilean Chamber Orchestra]] declared him an Honorary Member, the [[Universidad de Chile]] appointed him an Honorary Professor in its Arts Faculty, and the [[Chilean Ministry of Education]] conferred on him the "Orden al Mérito Docente y Cultural [[Gabriela Mistral]]" with the rank of "Caballero". He received the [[Engel Prize]] for his original work and his research into [[Jewish music]], awarded by the city of Tel Aviv in June 2007. Leon Schidlowsky has given courses in composition in several countries; and he has helped to form and influence a whole generation of composers in Israel, like [[Avraham Amzallag]], [[Chaya Arbel]], [[Mary Even-Or]], [[Rachel Galinne]], [[Betty Olivero]], [[Jan Radzynski]], [[Ruben Seroussi]], [[Ron Weidberg]], [[Moshe Zorman]].

==Works==
Many of his works make reference to his Jewish-Israeli identity and to the history of the Jewish people, as well as to his interest in history and the political and social situation in Chile and Latin America. There is also in his works a musical response to his personal life and experience, such as the death of his wife Susanne (1999) and his son Elias (2004), or the destiny of many personal and professional friends, or personalities of his time. As an admirer of [[Arnold Schoenberg]]´s music, Schidlowsky began his career as a composer in the tradition of the [[Second Viennese School]]. His music is also highly influenced by [[Edgard Varèse]], specially on his concern with [[timbre]] and freedom of [[musical form|form]].

Later he began to use [[serial music|serial techniques]], and to experiment with various tonal concepts ([[Atonality|atonal]], [[aleatoric]], [[graphic notation (music)|graphic notation]]), but always on the understanding that music has a deeper significance which transcends absolute art, which can open up a path for a human being to find a way to himself (Schidlowsky: "Art itself has not only one meaning. It includes and encompasses all senses, questions and all answers. I think that art is a way to us."). Leon Schidlowsky has written dramatic and vivid works. Examples:&lt;ref&gt;A full list of his works can be found at www.schidlowsky.com&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Consciousness]] is a loosely defined concept that addresses the human [[awareness]] of both internal and external stimuli. This can refer to spiritual recognition, psychological understanding, medically altered states, or more modern-day concepts of life purpose, satisfaction, and [[self-actualization]].

Most proposals map consciousness in a series of levels, some stages of which are more continuous or complex than others. Movement between stages is often bidirectional depending on internal and external conditions, with each mental ascension precipitating a change in reactivity. In the most basic sense, this alteration might lead to a reduced responsiveness as seen in [[anesthesiology]]; more abstract facets of tiered consciousness describe characteristics of profoundness, [[insight]], [[perception]], or [[understanding]].

First appearing in the historical records of the ancient [[Maya civilization#Writing and literacy|Mayan]] and [[Incan#Communication and medicine|Incan]] civilizations, proposals of multiple levels of consciousness have pervaded spiritual, psychological, medical, and moral speculations in both [[Eastern culture#Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] cultures. Because of occasional and sometimes substantial overlap between [[hypothesis|hypotheses]], there have recently been attempts to combine perspectives to form new models that integrate components of separate viewpoints.

Which if any of these proposals, models or viewpoints can be verified or falsified is open to question.

==History==

[[File:The Pyramid of Kulkucan (3182000923).jpg|thumb|alt=Pyramid of Kulkucan|Pyramid of Kulkucan (found at the center of the Chichen Itza)]]Although many cultures have incorporated theories of the layered consciousness into their belief structure, particularly for spiritual means before the [[Separation of church and state#Ancient history|separation of church and state]] within any given civilization, the Ancient Mayans were among the first to propose an organized sense of each level, its purpose, and its temporal connection to humankind.

==Mayans==

The pyramid of consciousness has defined [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] thought since the dawn of its civilization around 2000 BCE. Shamans and priests defined consciousness as an awareness of being aware, commonly referred to as a branch of [[metacognition]]. Because consciousness incorporates stimuli from the environment as well as internally, the Mayans believed it to be the most basic form of existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Calleman|first=Carl Johan|title=Solving the Greatest Mystery of Our Time: the Mayan Calendar|year=2000|publisher=Garev Publishing International|isbn=978-0970755803|pages=1–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This existence, which they referred to as a loose translation of ''[[Cosmos]]'', was made up of nine underworlds, depicted concretely through the nine-storied [[El Castillo, Chichen Itza|Pyramid of the Plumed Serpent]] in [[Chichen Itza]], [[Tikal Temple I|the Temple of the Jaguar]] in [[Tikal]], and the [[Temple of the Inscriptions]] in [[Palenque]]. Within these nine underworlds are a specified "day" and "night", symbolizing periods of enlightenment, increased consciousness, and a heightened ability to interact with the universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Calleman|first=Carl Johan|title=Mayan|authorlink=Carl Johan Calleman|work=Calendar: The Pyramid of Consciousness|url=http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Mayan_Calendar/id/1722|publisher=The Global Oneness Commitment|accessdate=3 March 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710212121/http://www.experiencefestival.com/a/Mayan_Calendar/id/1722|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A common cause for debate is the exponentially accelerating dates separating each level of consciousness, where each stage occurs roughly 20 times faster than the previous one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lungold|first=Ian Xel|title=Mayan Calendar Time Scale for Man's Evolution on Earth|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/962704/Mayan-Time-Scale-for-Mans-Evolution-on-Earth|work=The Mayan Calendar Comes North|publisher=Mayan Majix Learning Lab|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incas==

[[File:80 - Machu Picchu - Juin 2009 - edit.2.jpg|thumb|alt=Inca Civilization|Inca Civilization]]Whereas the Ancient Mayans defined consciousness in almost evolutionary terms, the [[Inca civilization]] considered it a progression of awareness and concern for others,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Neill|first=Patt|title=Inca Shamanic Glossary, F - G|url=http://www.incaglossary.org/fg.html|work=Glossary of Terminology of the Shamanic &amp; Ceremonial Traditions of the Inca Medicine Lineage|publisher=Patt O'Neill|accessdate=3 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; similar to the teachings of [[Siddhartha Buddha|Siddhartha Gautama]].

==Theories==

[[File:PeterSavichHeartChakra.jpg|thumb|alt=The Seven Chakras|The Seven [[Chakras]] ]]Although historical views of the separation of consciousness into various layers do not exactly mirror modern-day perspectives, many parallels can be gathered from the overarching themes found in [[Eastern culture|Eastern]] and [[Western culture|Western]] cultures.

===Eastern perspectives===

Many specific similarities have been drawn between Ancient Incan and historical Eastern views of tiered consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gillabel|first=Dirk|title=Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness|year=2001|publisher=House of the Sun|location=Seattle, WA|pages=1–53|url=http://www.soul-guidance.com/houseofthesun/sevenlevels.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within most Eastern belief structures is the principle of the Cosmos as a joint entity with human awareness. Many branches stress the importance of AUM, also written [[Om]], as the first sound produced after the world was created. Within [[Christianity]] this concept can be likened to the first words of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]] regarding the holiness of the Word.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Azariah|first=Jayapaul|title=The Symbol OM (Aum)|url=http://xuxoweb.galeon.com/Aum.html|accessdate=3 March 2011|newspaper=Eubios Ethics Institute Newsletter 4|date=July 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Historical beliefs====

The majority of Eastern perspectives assert that while consciousness originates from the sound of AUM, it has incorporated itself into flesh, which therefore gives humankind the goal of attaining oneness with the universe once more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Austin|first=James H.|title=Zen-brain reflections : reviewing recent developments in meditation and states of consciousness|year=2006|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780262012232|pages=1–586|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uZ4fyfH_t9EC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;cd=1&amp;source=gbs_ViewAPI}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Incan tradition, this oneness eliminates the separation of external and internal changes into one general indication of movement from stage to stage, commonly known as the Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Consciousness !! Description !! Notes
|-
| Personal || Knowledge of the self and of personality ||
|-
| Mankind || Knowledge of human evolution and its experiences ||
|-
| Amphibious || Sense of separate identity between water and land || "Water" and "land" are symbolic of man and earth
|-
| Spherical || Perceive using the five bodily senses ||
|-
| Crystal || Perceive using emotions, thoughts, and purity || First inorganic level undistorted by bodily senses
|-
| Light || Attained only by near-death experiences; "tunnel effect" || First level above the human world
|-
| Sound || Only heard when the mind attunes itself to the world || From the primeval vibration AUM
|}

====Modern-day beliefs====

Like the Seven Shamanic Levels of Consciousness, [[yoga]] meditation practices as well as the teachings of [[Vedanta]] and [[Tantra]] emphasize the importance of [[self-realization]], a concept that has become increasingly popular in Western philosophy after [[Abraham Maslow|Abraham Maslow's]] and [[Carl Rogers|Carl Rogers's]] research in [[Humanistic Psychology]].

=====Advaita Vedanta=====

[[File:Aum by a Korean artist.jpg|thumb|alt=Aum (Om) Mantra|Aum (Om) Mantra]]In particular, the [[Advaita Vedanta]] school of [[Hindu philosophy]] has been a topic of extensive study in both Eastern and Western cultures for its tiered depiction of the steps toward attaining self-realization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Deutsch|first=Eliot|title=The Self in Advaita Vedanta|journal=International Philosophical Quarterly|year=1966|volume=6|pages=5–21|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=ipq_1966_0006_0001_0003_0004&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;q=the%20self%20in%20advaita%20vedanta|accessdate=3 March 2011|doi=10.5840/ipq19666118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the unidirectional nature of Mayan, Inca, and ancient shamanic perspectives, however, this particular belief structure arranges the attainment of oneness with OM through rows and domains, each of which constitutes a fragment of this vibratory sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Victor|first=P. George|author2=V.V.S. Saibaba |title=Studies in Vedanta: Essays in Honour of Professor S.S. Rama Rao Pappu|journal=Teaching Philosophy|year=2007|volume=30|issue=3|pages=332–335|url=http://www.pdcnet.org/collection/show?id=teachphil_2007_0030_0003_0332_0335&amp;file_type=pdf&amp;q=the%20self%20in%20advaita%20vedanta|accessdate=3 March 2011|doi=10.5840/teachphil200730319}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Row !! Level !! Realm !! Description
|-
| 1: "A" || Waking || Conscious || External, active conscious
|-
| 2: "U" || Dreaming || Unconscious || Subtle images and impressions
|-
| 3: "M" || Deep Sleep || Subconscious || Focus on latent or inactive thought patterns
|-
| 4: "AUM" || Absolute || Consciousness || Transcending of all three levels
|}

=====OM Mantra=====

Similarly, the seven levels of consciousness defined by modern-day OM mantras strive to reach Absolute Reality through the same four realms described in the Advaita Vedanta, with three transitional tiers in between each.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bharati|first=Swami Jnaneshvara|title=Om Mantra and the Seven Levels of Consciousness|year=2007|publisher=Lulu Enterprises, Inc.|location=Raleigh, NC|pages=1–32|asin=B004JH6982}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Between the first ("A") and second ("U") levels is the ''Unmani'', similar to the Western concept of [[hypnagogia]], or the movement from full alertness into [[Non-rapid eye movement sleep#Stages of NREM sleep|stage 1 sleep]]
* Between the second ("U") and third ("M") levels is the ''Aladani'', mirroring ideas of [[Rapid eye movement sleep|REM sleep]]
* Between the third ("M") and fourth ("AUM") levels is the ''Samadhi'', or the attainment of deep absorption

=====The Veda=====

The ancient Indian [[Vedas]] texts have lent a comparable view of unified consciousness, with a key difference in the purpose of human ascension from stage to stage. Instead of oneness with the universe, the Vedic vision of consciousness emphasizes the importance of attaining knowledge and pure intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Singh|first=Satya P.|title=Vedic vision of consciousness and reality|year=2005|publisher=Centre for Studies in Civilizations|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788187586180|pages=1–522|url=http://www.waterstones.com/waterstonesweb/products/satya+singh/vedic+vision+of+consciousness+and+reality/6005949/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Ananda Sangha=====

[[File:Sivakempfort.jpg|thumb|alt=Statue of Shiva|Statue of Shiva]]The Ananda Sangha movement has evolved following the teachings of the late yogi and guru [[Paramhansa Yogananda]]. Compared to the multi-dimensional theories of consciousness in shamanic and OM mantra perspectives, this particular ideological faction stresses simplicity rather than detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kriyananda|first=Swami|title=Intuition for Starters: How to Know and Trust Your Inner Guidance|year=2002|publisher=Crystal Clarity Publishers|location=Nevada City, CA|isbn=1-56589-155-4|pages=1–127|url=http://www.crystalclarity.com/product.php?code=BIS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Subconscious: relatively dim awareness; repository of remembered experiences and consequent mental impressions
* Conscious: rational awareness; guides daily decisions and can be influenced by others; input from the bodily senses
* Superconscious Awareness: intuition and heightened mental clarity; problem and solution are seen as one entity

===Western perspectives===

Fluctuations in consciousness theories are not particular to Eastern cultures. A surprising degree of overlap can be found within the field of health and social sciences with regard to dulled, standard, and heightened intensities of awareness, both naturally and as a result of injury or disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Izard|first=C.|title=Levels of emotion and levels of consciousness|journal=Behavioral and Brain Sciences|year=2007|volume=30|issue=1|pages=96–98|doi=10.1017/S0140525X07001045}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Psychological views====

Like many [[psychology|psychological]] theories within the particular field of [[psychoanalysis]], one of the most popular theories of consciousness was proposed by [[Sigmund Freud]], who described three facets of the [[psychic apparatus]]: the unconscious ([[Id, ego and super-ego#Id|id]]) or instinctual facet, the preconscious ([[Ego (Freudian)|ego]]) or rational facet, and the conscious ([[Super-ego|superego]]) or moral facet.

Although not unlike the Vedic vision of consciousness as a form of [[intelligence]], [[Jean Piaget|Jean Piaget's]] [[Piaget's theory of cognitive development|theory of cognitive development]] is not commonly considered a form of knowledge awareness but instead as the evolution of the brain's capacity for thought throughout the human lifespan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pons|first=F.|author2=P. Harris |title=Piaget's conception of the development of consciousness: An Examination of two hypotheses|journal=Human Development|year=2001|volume=44|issue=4|pages=220–227|doi=10.1159/000057061}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Medical and pathological views====

Similar to previously mentioned psychological views, medical and pathological perspectives often hypothesize tiered consciousness as a result of disease or disorders. [[Altered level of consciousness|The Altered Levels of Consciousness]] (ALC) theory is one such measure, in which a person's arousability and responsiveness to environmental stimuli are classified by their behavioral response.

=====Glasgow Coma Scale=====

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:JoseGoulaoHospital.jpg|thumb|alt=Comatose Patient|Comatose Patient (most extreme level on the Glasgow Coma Scale)]] --&gt;Although many such ALC tests take place in hospital settings, the primary evaluation of patient alertness is the Glasgow Coma Scale, which separates levels of consciousness from standard conscious awareness to a [[coma]]tose state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Buchanan|first=L.|title=Assessment of Levels of Consciousness: The Glasgow Coma Scale|journal=University of Nebraska Medical Center, College of Nursing|year=1987|url=http://ehis.ebscohost.com/ehost/detail?hid=120&amp;sid=ef978c44-327b-458d-ab15-a965836e8543%40sessionmgr112&amp;vid=1&amp;bdata=JnNpdGU9ZWhvc3QtbGl2ZSZzY29wZT1zaXRl#db=c8h&amp;AN=1993157161|accessdate=14 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Obtunded''': decreased alertness, slowed motor responses; sleepiness
* '''Stuporous''': conscious but sleep-like state associated with little or no activity; only responsiveness is in reaction to pain
* '''Comatose''': no response to stimuli, cannot be aroused; no gag reflex or pupil response to light

=====Relationship to schizophrenia=====

Recent hypotheses have incorporated these ALC theories into the psychopathological study of [[schizophrenia]], suggesting that each altered level of awareness is connected to a degree of suffering or shock experienced by the patient, arguably traversing the Qliphoth in the process. As the situation increases in seriousness, patients will descend to lower levels of consciousness and consequentially lose the capacity to cry, to smile, or to exhibit a wide range of emotions when reacting to the environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mates|first=Maureen|title=Altered Levels of Consciousness in Schizophrenia|journal=Journal of Orthomolecular Medicine|year=1992|volume=7|issue=4|pages=216–220|doi= |url=http://orthomolecular.org/library/jom/1992/pdf/1992-v07n04-p216.pdf|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In more physiologically based studies, scientists have found that while the [[reticular formation]] controls alertness, wakefulness, and arousal in the brain, many mental responses to internal and external stimuli are dictated through signals relayed to and from the thalamus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tindall|first=Suzie C.|title="Level of Conscioussness."

===Modern-day perspectives===

Although many of the previously mentioned theories are still widely held today in various groups, beliefs, and areas of study, a majority of commonly accepted perspectives stem from just the past decade. These hypothesized structures of awareness draw from many historical and early eighteenth- or nineteenth-century theories to form an integrated and overarching generalization of consciousness as a means of determining inner and outer recognition of stimuli.

====Holder's three levels of consciousness====

Derived loosely from his philosophy of the [[Kung fu#Meditation|Kung Fu]] system, Philip Holder offers three levels of consciousness that feature distinct differences in the way in which they are reached.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Holder|first=Philip|title=The Three Levels of Consciousness and Humanity|url=http://www.wingchunonline.com/levels-of-consciousness/|work=Wing Chun Online|publisher=Wing Chun|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Barrett's seven levels of personal consciousness====

[[File:MasonParanoidPolaroid.jpg|thumb|alt=Self-Concept|[[Self-concept]]]]Similarly, Richard Barrett proposes seven stages of consciousness that progress in a logical order. The progression focuses on “[[existential]]” needs directly connected to and dependent on the human condition, all of which are motivating factors for daily interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barrett|first=Richard|title=The Seven Levels of Personal Consciousness|journal=Business &amp; Economics|year=2006|pages=248–252|url=http://www.valuescentre.com/uploads/2010-07-06/The%207%20Levels%20of%20Personal%20Consciousness-1.pdf|accessdate=13 March 2011}}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Gibson's four states of consciousness====

Dr. Bob Günius Gibson, left-handed author of ''Notes on Personal Integration and Health'' and often recognized as a [[psychic|psychic healer]], hypothesized the existence of four tiers of extrasensory awareness. Beyond being more applicable to internal states rather than reactions to the external environment, these stages contrast markedly with the previously mentioned modern theories through their emphasis on humankind's immediate interactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Summers|first=Marsha|title=Levels of Consciousness|url=http://www.marshasummers.com/innerman/tape7.htm|work=Studies of the Inner Being|publisher=Daytona Music|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gibson does not focus on life progression or individual power to move between levels, but rather on momentary instances of personal experience.

==Attempts to combine theories==

===Leary's 8-Circuit Model of Consciousness===

[[File:Deep Thought (3914353258).jpg|thumb|alt=Deep in Thought|Deep in Thought]]Timothy Leary and Robert Anton Wilson proposed [[8-Circuit Model of Consciousness|the Eight-Circuit Model of Consciousness]], a psychologically based theory that unifies various interpretations of main altered states of awareness into a single mega-theory, or a hypothesis' about an already existing hypothesis. In this case, Leary and Wilson state that [[Altered level of consciousness|the altered levels of consciousness]] defined in medical fields are products of eight differing brain structures within the human nervous system.

This concept not only connects psychology and the more medically focused studies of [[neurology]] and biology, but also incorporates elements of sociology, anthropology, physics, chemistry, and advanced mathematical formulas. Furthermore, critics argue that the inspiration for his theory stems at least indirectly from the Hindu [[chakra]] system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilson|first=Robert Anton|title=Cosmic Trigger: Final Secret of the Illuminati|year=2008|publisher=New Falcon Publications|location=Las Vegas, NV|isbn=978-1561840038|pages=1–269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Morin's integration===

Similar to Dr. Rondell Gibson's view of a simplified hierarchy of conscious states, Alain Morin describes a four-tiered integration of nine past awareness models, focusing explicitly on the two common aspects underlying each belief structure: the perception of the self in time and the complexity of those self-representations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morin|first=Alain|title=Levels of Consciousness and Self-Awareness: A Comparison and Integration of Various Views.|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|year=2006|volume=15|issue=2|pages=358–371|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2005.09.006|url=https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:jzJyTUjZytEJ:www.societyofrobots.com/robottheory/self-awareness_review.pdf+%22levels+of+consciousness%22&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=us&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESiGSelg-Sv4Tg4jTX0WDTM4JnyzZi4pLoDiriu3uFf6rMRXjvleJ8yXu0YIO_K8enn2Jur6Xg76W0wvDGq3OrmiLKfbjywM-uo0rhIPVZR68ztIGvBbEdAAqOiDJv0_RmbtHRQ3&amp;sig=AHIEtbQunMEYJUoOVZWytul9fD7o73h4lA|accessdate=13 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|}

In summary, Morin concludes that from the many concepts discussed above it is near impossible to settle for only one theory without accepting at least a fraction of another. Although each hypothesis has been debated either in scientific or more spiritually focused literature, he states that consciousness is related most directly to the subjective perception of self-recognition and language, both of which are determined by culture and our external environment as a whole.

=== Bob Monroe ===

[[Robert Monroe|Robert Allan Monroe]] became known for his research into [[Altered state of consciousness|altered consciousness]] and "[[out-of-body experience]]". His book 1985 ''"Far Journeys"''  showed numerous levels of consciousness and infinite expansion of consciousness.

''“The plants exist on levels of consciousness from one through seven. They are on a vibrational rate on the levels one through seven. It is the same pattern.''

''Animals exist on the levels of consciousness from eight through fourteen, and when a person attains, when a consciousness attains level fourteen, it can no longer go any higher unless it is willing to change its form of consciousness.''

''Levels of consciousness from fifteen through twenty-one are what you call human life on this earth.''

''When a person progresses to level of consciousness twenty one, he then has the choice of going higher or staying within the realm of human form, but he cannot go higher unless he is willing to give up human form.”'' &lt;ref&gt;''Far Journeys'' (1985)  {{ISBN|0-385-23182-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.be8.com/group/courseofawakening/forum/topics/the-levels-of-consciousness The Infinite expansion of consciousness &amp; its levels.[[Robert Monroe]]] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905052149/http://www.be8.com/group/courseofawakening/forum/topics/the-levels-of-consciousness |date=2011-09-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moore and Gillette===

Some analytical psychological methods have presented methodology to engage in deeper levels of inner expansive transcendence, depth that may lead to a reconciliation process. Propositions such as "active imagination," engaging in a conversation with the "Ego" and "Shadow" for instance. "Invocation," calling upon an archetypal imago to dialogue with, perhaps an image of saint or God, "Admiring Mature Paragon Examples," having conversations with wise old men and women; those who have accessed wisdom, for example, and "Acting 'As If,'" getting into character, acting like the character archetype one wishes to emulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Moore|first1=Douglas|last2=Gillette|first2=Robert|title=King Warrior Magician Lover, Rediscovering the Archetypes of the Mature Masculine|year=1990|publisher=HarperOne|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780062506061|url=https://www.amazon.com/King-Warrior-Magician-Lover-Rediscovering/dp/0062506064}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15582">In [[feminist theory]], the principle of '''male-as-norm''' holds that "language referring to females, such as the suffix -ess (as in actress), the use of man to mean "human", and other such devices, strengthens the perceptions that the male category is the norm and that the corresponding female category is a derivation and thus less important. Sexist terms such as chairman, anchorman, etc., are cited as examples of how the English language mirrors social [[gender bias]]es.&lt;ref name=Danesi&gt;{{cite book|last1=Danesi|first1=Marcel|title=Dictionary of Media and Communications|date=2009|publisher=M. E. Sharpe|location=Armonk, NY|isbn=9788182744066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea was first clearly expressed by 19th-century thinkers who began deconstructing the English language to expose the products and footings of patriarchy. The principle of male-as-norm and the relation between gendered grammar and the way in which its respective speakers conceptualize their world has received attention in varying fields from [[philosophy]] to [[psychology]] and [[anthropology]], and has fueled debates over [[linguistic determinism]] and gender inequality. 
The underlying message of this principle is that women speak a less legitimate language that both sustains and is defined by the subordination of the female gender as secondary to the accepted male-biased normative language. By regarding women's language as deficient in relation to that of men it has been assumed that something is wrong with women's language. Subsequently research in the social sciences, particularly in discourse analysis, has maintained and qualified systemic male bias.&lt;ref name=MacDougall&gt;{{cite journal|last1=MacDougall|first1=D.|title=Gendered discourse and ASL-to-english interpreting: A poststructuralist approach to gendered discourse and the ASL-to-english interpretive process |journal=Journal of Interpretation |date=2012 |volume=19 |issue=1 |url=https://digitalcommons.unf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?&amp;article=1026&amp;context=joi |accessdate=13 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt; In practice, grammatical gender exhibits a systematic structural bias that has made masculine forms the default for generic, non-gender-specific contexts. According to the male-as-norm principle the male linguistic bias works to exclude and ignore women, diminish the female experience, and rule that all that is not male is deviant and unfit to represent many social categories.&lt;ref name=Motschenbacker&gt;{{cite book|last1=Motschenbacker|first1=H|title=Language, gender and sexual identity : Poststructuralist perspectives|date=2010|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing Company|location=Amersterdam, NLD|isbn=9789027218681|pages=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical development ==

=== Shift from sexual hierarchy to sexual binary (1800s) ===
In the eighteenth-century there was a radical reinterpretation of the female body in relation to the male. Prior to this change in thinking, men and women were qualified by their degree of metaphysical perfection whereas by the late eighteenth century there was a new model established on ideas of radical dimorphism and [[Sexual dimorphism|biological divergence]]. Biologists used developments in the study of anatomy and physiology to change the understanding of sexual difference into that of kind rather than degree. This metaphysical shift in the understanding of sex and gender, as well as the interplay of these redefined social categories, solidified many of the existing beliefs in the inherent disparities of men and women. This allowed scientists, policy makers, and others of cultural influence to promulgate a belief in the gender binary under a veil of positivism and scientific enlightenment.&lt;br /&gt;  
Since the eighteenth century, the dominant view of [[Sex differences in humans|sexual difference]] has been that of two stable, incommensurable, and opposite sexes on which the political, economic, and cultural lives of men and women are based and social order is sustained. Contrary to modern day, "the dominant discourse construed the male and female bodies as hierarchically, vertically, ordered versions of one sex" rather than as "horizontally ordered opposites, as incommensurable."&lt;ref name=Laqueur&gt;{{cite book|last1=Laqueur|first1=Thomas|title=Making Sex: Body and Gender from the Greeks to Freud|date=1992|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, MA|isbn=9780674543553}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, it wasn't until the second half of the eighteenth century that the idea of two distinct sexes was established and, through the politics of the day, generated new ways of understanding people and social reality.
The recognition and discussion of this transition by protofeminists around the 19th century established the foundation upon which = feminists would later scrutinize gendered language, challenge the gender binary and its inherent prejudices, and develop the male as norm principle.

=== Mid-20th century ===

==== Simone De Beauvoir ====
In 1949, French existentialist [[Simone De Beauvoir]] described in her book ''[[The Second Sex]]'' two concepts that would later be developed in the fields of linguistics and psychology and become the basis for the male-as-norm principle in second-wave feminism.&lt;ref name=Bem&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bem|first1=S.|title=The lenses of gender: Transforming the debate on sexual inequality|date=1993|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven, CT|isbn=9780300061635}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beauvoir writes that man is regarded as "both the positive and the neutral," foreshadowing the study of [[markedness]], or the linguistic distinction between the "marked" and "unmarked" terms of an opposition. Specifically, "the notion that the typical contrast between opposites… is not symmetric." Rather, the contrast between oppositions is often asymmetric meaning "the positive, or unmarked, term can be neutralized in meaning to denote the scale as a whole rather than just the positive end; but the negative, or marked, term can denote just the negative end".&lt;ref name=Bem /&gt; Unaffixed masculine or singular forms are taken to be unmarked in contrast to affixed feminine or plural forms.

Beauvoir goes on to write that "there is an absolute human type, the masculine... Thus humanity is male,"&lt;ref name=Beauvoir&gt;{{cite book|last1=Beauvoir|first1=Simone de|title=The second sex|date=1953|publisher=Knopf|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the neutralizing of man to include woman is no longer her subject, rather the masculinizing of the whole human species to exclude woman–or at least to otherize her.&lt;ref name=Bem /&gt; Thus, introducing her second concept and foreshadowing the psychological concept of [[Prototype theory|prototypicality]] and the development of the prototype theory in the 1970s. "The prototype theory is a model of graded categorizations, where some members of a category are more central than others. A prototype helps to explain the meaning of a word by resembling to the clearest exemplar".&lt;ref name=Mustedanagic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mustedanagic|first1=A.|title=Gender in english language and EFL textbooks (Independent thesis Basic Level (degree of Bachelor) |journal=Halmstad University Library |date=2010|doi= |url=http://hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:346993 |accessdate=13 April 2015 |dead-url= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170920113503/hh.diva-portal.org/smash/record.jsf?pid=diva2:346993 |archive-date=2017-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "All members of a category do not have equal status in the mind of the human perceiver; some members are instead perceived as more equal–or more prototypical–than other members… Like the prototypical member of any category, the male is taken to be the cognitive reference point, the standard, for the category of human being; and like the non-prototypical members of any category, the female is taken to be a variation on that prototype, a less representative example of the human species".&lt;ref name=Bem /&gt;

==== Luce Irigaray ====
Just as Simone de Beauvoir had done in recent decades, French feminist and literary scholar Luce Irigaray centered her ideas regarding the male as norm principle around the idea that women as a whole are otherized by systematic gender inequality, particularly through gendered language and how female experience and subjectivity are defined by variation from a male norm; through opposition in a phallocentric system where language is deliberately employed as a method of protecting the interests of the phallus and subliminally affirming his position as norm.
Irigaray affirms that the designation of woman as an inferior version of men, an aberrant variation from the male norm, is reflected throughout Western history and philosophy. Notably, Freud made similar sense of gender dynamics in his designation of women as 'little men'. In this tradition of inequality women are measured against a male standard, seen in comparison – as lack, complementary or the same. She asserts that any perception of difference between the two genders is an illusion. "Where women are not the same as men, they fail to exist altogether." 
&lt;ref name=Bacon&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bacon|first1=Hannah|title=What's Right with the Trinity? : Conversations in Feminist Theology|date=2009|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Group|location=Farnham, Surrey, GBR|isbn=9781409409298}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Dale Spender ====
[[Dale Spender]] is one of the most cited feminist scholars to work with the male-as-norm principle. She claims that "patriarchy is a frame of reference, a particular way of classifying and organizing the objects and events of the world" With language we classify and organize the world and through which we have the ability to manipulate reality. In this way, if our language is systematically flawed and/or rests on an understructure of invalid rules then we are misled and deceived at a fundamental perceptual level.
The rules by which we make meaning, ones intrinsically associated with language, had to be invented and defined. These linguistic rules establish our frame of reference, order, and the grounds from which we interpret and comprehend reality. Spender explains that  these rules become self-validating and self-perpetuating with the passing of time, regardless of the validity of the beliefs and/or interpretations on which they were founded.&lt;ref name=Spender&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spender|first1=Dale|title=Man Made Language|date=1998 |publisher=Pandora|location=London|isbn=0863584012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Spender claims that  the semantic rule of male as norm may appear to be ineffectual in producing the purported significant social impact concluded by many feminists however this is in fact part of why the rule is so pervasive and superlatively harmful in the construction of our perceptions of gender. As long as this rule remains central to gendered languages users of these languages will continue to classify the world on the premise that males are the standard, normal being and that those who are not male will be considered deviant. Speakers will continue to divide humanity into two unfairly biased parts. "By arranging the objects and events of the world according to these rules we set up the rationale, and the vindication, for male supremacy."

==== Gerda Lerner ====
Over the course of feminist historian [[Gerda Lerner]]'s career, Lerner focuses her studies on patriarchal power and the history of the subordination of women. By examining gender stratification in various societies throughout human history in accordance with language, Lerner provides an in-depth look into the historical and modern significance of the male as norm principle. She was one of the founders of the field of women's history and played a key role in the development of women's history curricula. In Lerner's book ''The Creation of Patriarchy'' (1986), she addresses how men have in history appropriated the major symbols of female power, constructed religions around "the counterfactual metaphor of male procreativity," and have "redefined female existence in a narrow and sexually dependent way." She explains that the metaphors for gender, created and promoted by men, have "expressed the male as norm and the female as deviant; the male as whole and powerful, the female as unfinished, mutilated, and lacking in autonomy." According to Lerner, men have constructed, explained, and defined the world in their own terms and have placed themselves at the center of discourse.  &lt;br /&gt; 
Lerner goes on to explain how men, by establishing male-centered language and discourse as the norm, have in turn demanded an androcentric perspective and necessitated the conceptualization of women as less than men and have distorted the definition of woman to the degree that their experiences, autonomy, and viewpoints have been lost to modern consideration. In turn, men have come to believe that their experiences, viewpoint, and ideas represent all of human experience and thought. She concludes that as long as men are unable to recognize the female perspective and as long as they believe they have the only legitimatize human experience they will be unable to accurately define and understand reality.&lt;ref name=Lerner&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lerner|first1=Gerda|title=The creation of partiarchy|date=1986|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=0195039963}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern perspectives ==

=== Sue Wilkinson ===
In 1997 [[Celia Kitzinger and Sue Wilkinson|Sue Wilkinson]], a professor of Feminist and Health Studies from Loughborough University, wrote that there are distinct theoretical traditions in feminism that assert women's inferiority, two of which are rooted in the idea of male-as-norm. First, psychology has mismeasured women throughout its history by taking a male-as-norm perspective which categorizes females as deviant; or, in other words of Simone De Beauvoir, the science of psychology has systematically "otherized" women. Another way which Wilkinson sees women's inferiority asserted is through psychologists seeking a different perspective, the female perspective, by listening to women's voices and drawing on, and feeding back into, preconceived ideas regarding female moral and cognitive processes as they differ from those of males. Wilkinson writes that we should reconstruct the question of sex differences and that we need to dismantle maleness and femaleness as fundamental categories.&lt;ref name=Hepburn&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hepburn|first1=Alexa|title=An introduction to critical social psychology|date=2003|publisher=SAGE|location=London; Thousand Oaks, Calif.|isbn=9781446218884|url=http://site.ebrary.com/id/10080978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jeannine Hill Fletcher ===
In her book ''Motherhood as Metaphor: Engendering Interreligious Dialogue'', professor of theology Jeannine Hill Fletcher of Fordham University notes that scripture and Christians theological writings have presented theological anthropology from a male-as-norm perspective due to a history of predominantly male theologians and philosophers. She notes that this has had disastrous effects on the lives of women and the valuation of the female perspective and consequently the history of Christian theology has missed opportunities for opening new understandings of what it means to be human.&lt;ref name=Fletcher&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fletcher|first1=Jeannine H.|title=Motherhood as Metaphor: Engendering Interreligious Dialogue|date=2013|publisher=Fordham University Press|location=New York, NY|isbn=9780823251186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Montage''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɒ|n|ˈ|t|ɑː|ʒ}}) is a technique in [[film editing]] in which a series of short shots are edited into a sequence to condense space, time, and information. The term has been used in various contexts. It was introduced to cinema primarily by [[Sergei Eisenstein]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bordwell|first=David|title=The Cinema of Eisenstein|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0415973651}}&lt;/ref&gt; and early [[USSR|Soviet]] directors used it as a synonym for creative editing. In French the word "montage" applied to cinema simply denotes editing. The term "montage sequence" has been used primarily by British and American studios, and refers to the common technique as outlined in this article.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reisz|first=Karel|title=The Technique of Film Editing|year=2010|publisher=Focal Press|location=Burlington, MA|isbn=978-0-240-52185-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The montage sequence is usually used to suggest the passage of time, rather than to create symbolic meaning as it does in [[Soviet montage theory]].

From the 1930s to the 1950s, montage sequences often combined numerous short shots with special optical effects ([[Dissolve (filmmaking)|fades]], [[Dissolve (filmmaking)|dissolves]], [[split screen (filmmaking)|split screens]], [[multiple exposure|double and triple exposures]]) dance and music. They were usually assembled by someone other than the director or the editor of the movie.
== Development ==
{{quote|The word ''montage'' came to identify…specifically the rapid, shock cutting that Eisenstein employed in his films. Its use survives to this day in the specially created "montage sequences" inserted into Hollywood films to suggest, in a blur of double exposures, the rise to fame of an opera singer or, in brief model shots, the destruction of an airplane, a city or a planet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Knight |first=Arthur |year=1957 |title=The Liveliest Art: A Panoramic History of the Movies |location=New York |publisher=Mentor Books |oclc=833176912 |page=80}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two common montage sequence devices of the period are a newspaper one and a railroad one. In the newspaper one, there are multiple shots of newspapers being printed (multiple layered shots of papers moving between rollers, papers coming off the end of the press, a pressman looking at a paper) and headlines zooming on to the screen telling whatever needs to be told. There are two montages like this in ''[[It Happened One Night]]''. In a typical railroad montage, the shots include engines racing toward the camera, giant engine wheels moving across the screen, and long trains racing past the camera as destination signs zoom into the screen.

"Scroll montage" is a form of multiple-screen montage developed specifically for the moving image in an [[internet browser]]. It plays with Italian theatre director Eugenio Barba's "space river" montage in which the spectators' attention is said to "[sail] on a tide of actions which their gaze [can never] fully encompass".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barba |first=Eugenio |year=2009 |title=On Directing and Dramaturgy: Burning the House |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781135225841 |page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt;  "Scroll montage" is usually used in online audio-visual works in which sound and the moving image are separated and can exist autonomously: audio in these works is usually streamed on [[internet radio]] and video is posted on a separate site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mobile Irony Valve|title=Logical Volume Identifier|url=http://www.mobile-irony-valve.net/index.php/lvi/lvi/ |date=May 25, 2014 |publisher=[[KCHUNG Radio]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Noted directors ==
Film critic Ezra Goodman discusses the contributions of [[Slavko Vorkapić]], who worked at [[MGM]] and was the best-known montage specialist of the 1930s:

{{quote|He devised vivid montages for numerous pictures, mainly to get a point across economically or to bridge a time lapse. In a matter of moments, with images cascading across the screen, he was able to show [[Jeanette MacDonald]]'s rise to fame as an opera star in ''[[Maytime (1937 film)|Maytime]]'' (1937), the outbreak of the revolution in ''[[Viva Villa]]'' (1934), the famine and exodus in ''[[The Good Earth (film)|The Good Earth]]'' (1937), and the plague in ''[[Romeo and Juliet (1936 film)|Romeo and Juliet]]'' (1936).&lt;ref&gt;Goodman, Ezra. ''Fifty Year Decline and Fall of Hollywood'', Macfadden Books, 1962, p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From 1933 to 1942, [[Don Siegel]], later a noted feature film director, was the head of the montage department at [[Warner Brothers]]. He did montage sequences for hundreds of features, including ''[[Confessions of a Nazi Spy]]''; ''[[Knute Rockne, All American]]''; ''[[Blues in the Night]]''; ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]''; ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]''; ''[[Action in the North Atlantic]]''; ''[[Gentleman Jim (1942 film)|Gentleman Jim]]''; and ''[[They Drive By Night]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel," ''Who the Devil Made It'', [[Peter Bogdanovich]], Alfred A. Knopf, 1997, p. 766. Interview made in 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;

Siegel told [[Peter Bogdanovich]] how his montages differed from the usual ones:
{{quote|Montages were done then as they're done now, oddly enough—very sloppily. The director casually shoots a few shots that he presumes will be used in the montage and the cutter grabs a few stock shots and walks down with them to the man who's operating the optical printer and tells him to make some sort of mishmash out of it. He does, and that's what's labeled montage.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel," pp. 724–725.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In contrast, Siegel would read the motion picture's script to find out the story and action, then take the script's one line description of the montage and write his own five page script. The directors and the studio bosses left him alone because no one could figure out what he was doing. Left alone with his own crew, he constantly experimented to find out what he could do. He also tried to make the montage match the director's style, dull for a dull director, exciting for an exciting director.

{{quote|Of course, it was a most marvelous way to learn about films, because I made endless mistakes just experimenting with no supervision. The result was that a great many of the montages were enormously effective.&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel", pp. 725–726.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Siegel selected the montages he did for ''[[Yankee Doodle Dandy]]'' (1942), ''[[The Adventures of Mark Twain (1944 film)|The Adventures of Mark Twain]]'' (1944), and ''Confessions of a Nazi Spy'', as especially good ones. "I thought the montages were absolutely extraordinary in 'The Adventures of Mark Twain'—not a particularly good picture, by the way."&lt;ref&gt;"Don Siegel", p. 726.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sports training use ==
The sports training montage is a standard explanatory montage. It originated in [[United States|American]] cinema but has since spread to modern martial arts films from [[East Asia]]. Originally depicting a character engaging in physical or sports training, the form has been extended to other activities or themes.

=== Conventions and clichés ===
The standard elements of a sports training montage include a build-up where the potential sports hero confronts his failure to train adequately. The solution is a serious, individual training regimen. The individual is shown engaging in physical training through a series of short, cut sequences. An inspirational song (often fast-paced [[rock music]]) typically provides the only sound. At the end of the montage several weeks have elapsed in the course of just a few minutes and the hero is now prepared for the big competition. One of the best-known examples is the training sequence in the 1976 movie ''[[Rocky]]'', which culminates in Rocky's run up the [[Rocky Steps]] of the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m_mImQBUMaA| Rocky and the Methods of Montage - Brows Held High]&lt;/ref&gt;

The montage sequence in Rocky IV is clearly the best of all time (according to Louis).

The simplicity of the technique and its over-use in American film [[vocabulary]] has led to its status as a film [[cliché]]. A notable [[parody]] of the sports training montage appears in the ''[[South Park]]'' episode, "[[Asspen]]". When [[Stan Marsh]] must become an expert skier quickly, he begins training in a montage where the inspirational song explicitly spells out the techniques and requirements of a successful sports training montage sequence as they occur on screen. The same song was later used in ''[[Team America: World Police]]'' in a similar sequence.

In "[[Once More, with Feeling (Buffy episode)|Once More, with Feeling]]", an episode of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'', [[Buffy Summers]] does an extended workout while [[Rupert Giles]] sings one song; this distortion of time is one of numerous musical conventions made literal by a spell affecting [[Sunnydale]]. Prior to this sequence, Buffy Summers voices her concern that "this whole session is going to turn into some training montage from an '80s movie" to which Rupert Giles replies "Well, if we hear any inspirational [[power chord]]s we'll just lie down until they go away". The original 1992 film of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (film)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' includes a very clichéd training montage.

The music in these training montage scenes has garnered a cult following, with such artists as [[Robert Tepper]], [[Stan Bush]] and [[Survivor (band)|Survivor]] appearing on several '80s soundtracks. Songs like [[Frank Stallone]]'s "[[Far from Over (Frank Stallone song)|Far from Over]]," and [[John Farnham]]'s "Break the Ice" are examples of high-energy rock songs that typify the music that appeared during montages in '80s action films.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.noecho.net/features/80s-action-film-montage-music-never-say-die-its-far-from-over ‘80s Action Film Montage Music: Never Say Die, it’s Far From Over!]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10107">The principle of '''moral supervenience''' states that moral predicates (e.g., permissible, obligatory, forbidden, etc.), and hence moral facts attributing these predicates to various particular actions or action-types, [[supervenience|supervene]], or are defined by and depend, upon non-moral facts. The moral facts are hence said to be ''supervenient facts'', and the non-moral facts the ''supervenience base'' of the former. The principle is sometimes qualified to say that moral facts supervene upon ''natural'' facts, i.e., observable, empirical facts within space-time, but a broader conception could allow the supervenience base to include any non-moral facts, including (if there are any) non-natural facts (e.g., divine commands, Platonic truths).&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

== Clarification and examples ==

Another way to put this is to say that moral facts are a function of, depend upon, or are constrained or constituted by, some non-moral facts, and that the latter are a sufficient condition for making the moral facts true. Yet another common way of putting this is that any change in moral facts must be accompanied by a change in the non-moral facts (i.e., those on which it supervenes), but that the reverse is not the case.&lt;ref&gt;McPherson, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; A moral fact can be constituted by more than one set of non-moral facts-i.e., it is [[multiple realizability|multiply realizable]]-but any given set of non-moral facts determines the moral facts which supervene upon it.

For instance, its being obligatory for Alice to pay Bob $10 supervenes upon non-moral facts, like that Alice borrowed $10 from Bob and promised to repay him. However the same obligation could have arisen if Alice had bought something from Bob priced at $10, or if she promised to give him a gift in that amount, etc. But if any such fact is sufficient to generate this obligation, then it is not possible for her to lack that obligation unless the relevant facts change. Likewise, if another person, say Cindy, stands in the non-moral relationship to David (having borrowed $10 from him, etc.), then she must have the same obligation Alice does.

However the principle is compatible with a very fine-grained analysis of the supervenience base for moral predicates, and hence is compatible with [[moral particularism]]. ([[R.M. Hare]], in the first recorded usage of the term moral particularism, defined these as incompatible, as [[contradictories]] but his definition of particularism is not identical with its contemporary usage.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963, p.19&lt;/ref&gt;) The non-moral facts on which a moral fact supervenes could be quite complex, with many exceptions and qualifications; for instance, one might only be obliged to pay someone $10 if the recipient has not waived the debt, or does not intend to use the funds to cause immediate harm to someone else, etc.

As the principle of moral supervenience by itself places no limit on what the non-moral supervenience base of any moral fact is, nor on how complex the former might be, it is generally considered a very weak principle. It is even compatible with the idea that obligations may vary for persons of different nationalities, races, genders, ages, etc. It only disallows exceptions for certain persons merely on the grounds that they are different people from other persons (note that the fact that.e.g., Alice is Alice, and not Cindy, is not itself a property of Alice, although the facts that she is called "Alice," or has a different residence, birthplace, etc. from Cindy, are among her properties). Hare put this point by saying that the supervenience base of a moral fact could not include "individual constants" (including proper names of persons, countries, etc.)&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1981, p.41&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989, p.52&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Moral supervenience is a kind of [[moral universalizability]] principle, like the [[golden rule]] or Immanuel Kant's [[categorical imperative]], so the underlying idea may be as old as the golden rule. Moral supervenience differs from most other universalizability principles in that it adds no specific criterion for the supervenience base of permissible behaviors, so it cannot function as a comprehensive test for moral permissibility, as most other universalizability principles purport to do.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989, pp.30-48&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest precise specification of the principle may be found in Samuel Clarke's "Rule of Equity" according to which "Whatever I judge reasonable or unreasonable that another should do for me: that by the same judgment I declare reasonable or unreasonable that I should in the like case do for him."&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, 1705, p.87&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later William Wollaston echoed this claim with the principle that "Whatever is either reasonable or unreasonable in B with respect to C, would be just the same in C with respect to B, if the case was inverted. Because reason is universal and respects cases, not persons."&lt;ref&gt;Wollaston, 1724, p.129 (§VI.4)&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later Richard Cumberland restated this as a requirement of "right reason," which entailed that “It is included in the notion of a true proposition, (a practical one, for instance,) and is consequently a necessary perfection of a man forming a right judgment in that affair; that it should agree with other true propositions framed about a like subject, tho that case should happen at another time, or belong to another man.... Whoever therefore judges truly, must judge the same things, which he thinks truly are lawful to himself, to be lawful in others in a like case. "&lt;ref&gt;Cumberland, 1727, p.381 (§II.7).&lt;/ref&gt; Later versions are found in Reid,&lt;ref&gt;Reid, 1788, pp.240 (§III.iii), 375 (§V.i)&lt;/ref&gt; Moore,&lt;ref&gt;Moore, 1903, p.98&lt;/ref&gt; Sidgwick,&lt;ref&gt;Sidgwick, 1970, pp.209, 379&lt;/ref&gt; and Sharp.&lt;ref&gt;Sharp, 1928, pp. 110, 115, 140&lt;/ref&gt;

The first usage of the general term "supervenience" and the specific term "moral supervenience" in print was by R.M. Hare,&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1952, pp.80-81&lt;/ref&gt; although he later suggested that the former term was used by other philosophers conversationally before he put them both into print.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989&lt;/ref&gt; While Hare was primarily interested in the supervenience of moral concepts on non-moral ones, he also argued that other evaluative concepts, e.g., aesthetic ones like beautiful, pleasant, nice, etc., must also supervene upon non-moral facts. For instance, it is senseless to call one room "nice" and another "not nice" unless there is some underlying difference between them describable in non-aesthetic terms (like the arrangement of the furniture, color of the walls, etc.) If the two rooms are identical in all their non-aesthetic properties, then they must also be identical in their aesthetic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963, p.3&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1989, p.70&lt;/ref&gt;

In a series of later books, Hare made moral supervenience, combined with the criterion that a rational being would prefer the satisfaction of his preferences over their frustration, the basis of his idea of [[universal prescriptivism]]. From this he derived a version of [[utilitarianism]], by arguing that to prescribe a particular action in one's circumstances was only rational if you would prescribe anyone's else's doing it, even if you were equally likely to be any agent (including all those affected, for good or ill, by the action). This would only be true if, were you to personally experience all the good and bad effects of the action upon all affected persons (i.e., the satisfaction and frustration of their preferences), you would not prefer some other action to the one in question.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1981&lt;/ref&gt; He often simply called moral supervenience "universalizability" and equated it with Kant's principle of universal law,&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1963, p.219&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hare, 1997, pp.151-153&lt;/ref&gt; although the two are not the same (see [[moral universalizability]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41356">In [[mathematical logic]], '''New Foundations''' ('''NF''') is an [[axiomatic set theory]], conceived by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] as a simplification of the [[theory of types]] of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]''. Quine first proposed NF in a 1937 article titled "New Foundations for Mathematical Logic"; hence the name. Much of this entry discusses '''NFU''', an important variant of NF due to Jensen (1969) and exposited in Holmes (1998).&lt;ref&gt;Holmes, Randall, 1998. ''[http://math.boisestate.edu/~holmes/holmes/head.pdf Elementary Set Theory with a Universal Set]''. Academia-Bruylant.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1940 and in a revision of 1951 Quine introduced an extension of NF sometimes called "Mathematical Logic" or "ML", that included proper classes  as well as sets.

New Foundations has a universal set, so it is a non-well founded set theory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/quine-nf/ Quine's New Foundations] - Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy&lt;/ref&gt; That is to say, it is an axiomatic set theory that allows infinite descending chains of membership such as
…&amp;nbsp;x&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;n-1&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ …x&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ∈ x&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. It avoids Russell's paradox by permitting only stratifiable formulae to be defined using the axiom (schema) of comprehension. For instance x ∈ y is a stratifiable formula, but x ∈ x is not (for details of how this works see below).

==The type theory TST==
The primitive predicates of Russellian unramified typed set theory (TST), a streamlined version of the [[Type theory|theory of types]], are equality (&lt;math&gt;=&lt;/math&gt;) and membership (&lt;math&gt;\in&lt;/math&gt;). TST has a linear hierarchy of types: type 0 consists of individuals otherwise undescribed. For each (meta-) natural number ''n'', type ''n''+1 objects are sets of type ''n'' objects; sets of type ''n'' have members of type ''n''-1. Objects connected by identity must have the same type. The following two atomic formulas succinctly describe the typing rules: &lt;math&gt;x^{n} = y^{n}\!&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x^{n} \in y^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;. (Quinean set theory seeks to eliminate the need for such superscripts.)

The axioms of TST are:
*[[axiom of extensionality|Extensionality]]: sets of the same (positive) type with the same members are equal;
*An axiom schema of [[axiom of separation|comprehension]], namely:
:If &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)\!&lt;/math&gt; is a [[well-formed formula|formula]], then the set &lt;math&gt;\{x^n \mid \phi(x^n)\}^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; exists.

:In other words, given any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)\!&lt;/math&gt;, the formula &lt;math&gt;\exists A^{n+1} \forall x^n [ x^n \in A^{n+1} \leftrightarrow \phi(x^n) ]&lt;/math&gt; is an axiom where &lt;math&gt;A^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; represents the set &lt;math&gt;\{x^n \mid \phi(x^n)\}^{n+1}\!&lt;/math&gt; and is not free in &lt;math&gt;\phi(x^n)&lt;/math&gt;.

This type theory is much less complicated than the one first set out in the ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'', which included types for [[Relation (mathematics)|relations]] whose arguments were not necessarily all of the same type. In 1914, [[Norbert Wiener]] showed how to code the [[ordered pair]] as a set of sets, making it possible to eliminate relation types in favor of the linear hierarchy of sets described here.

== Quinean set theory==

===Axioms and stratification===

The well-formed formulas of New Foundations (NF) are the same as the well-formed formulas of TST, but with the type annotations erased. The axioms of NF are:

*[[Extensionality]]: Two objects with the same elements are the same object;
*A [[axiom of separation|comprehension schema]]: All instances of TST ''Comprehension'' but with type indices dropped (and without introducing new identifications between variables).

By convention, NF's ''[[axiom of separation|Comprehension]]'' schema is stated using the concept of [[stratified formula]] and making no direct reference to types. A formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is said to be [[stratified formula|stratified]] if there exists a [[function (mathematics)|function]] ''f'' from pieces of syntax to the natural numbers, such that for any atomic subformula &lt;math&gt;x \in y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; we have ''f''(''y'') = ''f''(''x'') + 1, while for any atomic subformula &lt;math&gt;x=y&lt;/math&gt; of &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, we have ''f''(''x'') = ''f''(''y''). ''Comprehension'' then becomes:
:&lt;math&gt;\{x \mid \phi \}&lt;/math&gt; exists for each [[stratified formula]] &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;.
Even the indirect reference to types implicit in the notion of [[stratification (mathematics)|stratification]] can be eliminated. [[Theodore Hailperin]] showed in 1944 that ''Comprehension'' is equivalent to a finite conjunction of its instances,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hailperin | first1 = T | year = | title = A set of axioms for logic | url = | journal = [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.2307/2267307}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that NF can be finitely axiomatized without any reference to the notion of type.

''Comprehension'' may seem to run afoul of problems similar to those in [[naive set theory]], but this is not the case. For example, the existence of the impossible [[Russell's paradox|Russell class]] &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x \not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt; is not an axiom of NF, because &lt;math&gt; x \not\in x &lt;/math&gt; cannot be stratified.

=== Ordered pairs===
[[Relation (mathematics)|Relations]] and [[function (mathematics)|functions]] are defined in TST (and in NF and NFU) as sets of [[ordered pair]]s in the usual way. The usual definition of the ordered pair, first proposed by [[Kuratowski]] in 1921, has a serious drawback for NF and related theories: the resulting ordered pair necessarily has a type two higher than the type of its arguments (its left and right [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s). Hence for purposes of determining stratification, a function is three types higher than the members of its field.

If one can define a pair in such a way that its type is the same type as that of its arguments (resulting in a '''type-level''' ordered pair), then a relation or function is merely one type higher than the type of the members of its field. Hence NF and related theories usually employ [[Willard van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s set-theoretic definition of the 
ordered pair, which yields a [[Ordered pair#Quine-Rosser definition|type-level ordered pair]]. Holmes (1998) takes the ordered pair and its left and right [[projection (mathematics)|projection]]s as primitive. Fortunately, whether the ordered pair is type-level by definition or by assumption (i.e., taken as primitive) usually does not matter.

The existence of a type-level ordered pair implies ''Infinity'', and NFU + ''Infinity'' interprets NFU + "there is a type level ordered pair" (they are not quite the same theory, but the differences are inessential). Conversely, NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice'' proves the existence of a type-level ordered pair.

===Admissibility of useful large sets===
NF (and NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice'', described below and known consistent) allow the construction of two kinds of sets that [[ZFC]] and its proper extensions disallow because they are "too large" (some set theories admit these entities under the heading of [[proper class]]es):
*''The [[universal set]] V''. Because &lt;math&gt;x=x&lt;/math&gt; is a [[stratified formula]], the [[universal set]] ''V'' = {''x'' | ''x=x''} exists by ''Comprehension''. An immediate consequence is that all sets have [[complement (set theory)|complements]], and the entire set-theoretic universe under NF has a [[Boolean algebra (structure)|Boolean]] structure.
*''[[cardinal number|Cardinal]] and [[ordinal number|ordinal]] numbers''. In NF (and TST), the set of all sets having ''n'' elements (the [[circular reasoning|circularity]] here is only apparent) exists. Hence [[Frege]]'s definition of the cardinal numbers works in NF and NFU: a cardinal number is an [[equivalence class]] of sets under the [[Relation (mathematics)|relation]] of [[equinumerosity]]: the sets ''A'' and ''B'' are equinumerous if there exists a [[bijection]] between them, in which case we write &lt;math&gt;A \sim B&lt;/math&gt;. Likewise, an ordinal number is an [[equivalence class]] of [[well-ordering|well-ordered]] sets.

==Finite axiomatizability==

New Foundations can be [[Axiom schema#Finite axiomatization|finitely axiomatized]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hailperin | first1 = T | year = | title = A set of axioms for logic | url = | journal = [[Journal of Symbolic Logic]] | volume = 9 | issue = | pages = 1–19 | doi=10.2307/2267307}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fenton, Scott, 2015. ''[http://us.metamath.org/nfegif/mmnf.html New Foundations Explorer Home Page]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartesian closure==
The category whose objects are the sets of NF and whose arrows are the functions between those sets is not [[cartesian closed category|Cartesian closed]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dpmms.cam.ac.uk/~tf/cartesian-closed.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;; Cartesian closure can be a useful property for a category of sets. Since NF lacks Cartesian closure, not every function [[currying|curries]] as one might intuitively expect, and NF is not a [[topos]].

==The consistency problem and related partial results==
The outstanding problem with NF is that it is not yet verified to be [[equiconsistency|relatively consistent]] to any mainstream mathematical system. NF disproves ''Choice'', and so proves ''Infinity'' (Specker, 1953). But it is also known ([[Ronald Jensen|Jensen]], 1969) that allowing [[urelement]]s (multiple distinct objects lacking members) yields NFU, a theory that is consistent relative to [[Peano arithmetic]]; if Infinity and Choice are added, the resulting theory has the same consistency strength as type theory with infinity or bounded Zermelo set theory. (NFU corresponds to a type theory TSTU, where type 0 has urelements, not just a single empty set.) There are other relatively consistent variants of NF.

NFU is, roughly speaking, weaker than NF because in NF, the power set of the universe is the universe itself, while in NFU, the power set of the universe may be strictly smaller than the universe (the power set of the universe contains only sets, while the universe may contain urelements). In fact, this is necessarily the case in NFU+"Choice".

Specker has shown that NF is [[equiconsistency|equiconsistent]] with TST + ''Amb'', where ''Amb'' is the axiom scheme of '''typical ambiguity''' which asserts &lt;math&gt;\phi \leftrightarrow \phi^+&lt;/math&gt; for any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\phi^+&lt;/math&gt; being the formula obtained by raising every type index in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; by one. NF is also equiconsistent with the theory TST augmented with a "type shifting automorphism", an operation which raises type by one, mapping each type onto the next higher type, and preserves equality and membership relations (and which cannot be used in instances of ''Comprehension'': it is external to the theory). The same results hold for various fragments of TST in relation to the corresponding fragments of NF.

In the same year (1969) that [[Ronald Jensen|Jensen]] proved NFU consistent, Grishin proved &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; consistent. &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; is the fragment of NF with full extensionality (no urelements) and those instances of ''Comprehension'' which can be stratified using just three types. This theory is a very awkward medium for mathematics (although there have been attempts to alleviate this awkwardness), largely because there is no obvious definition for an [[ordered pair]]. Despite this awkwardness, &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; is very interesting because ''every'' infinite model of TST restricted to three types satisfies ''Amb''. Hence for every such model there is a model of &lt;math&gt;NF_3&lt;/math&gt; with the same theory. This does not hold for four types: &lt;math&gt;NF_4&lt;/math&gt; is the same theory as NF, and we have no idea how to obtain a model of TST with four types in which ''Amb'' holds.

In 1983, Marcel Crabbé proved consistent a system he called NFI, whose axioms are unrestricted extensionality and those instances of ''Comprehension'' in which no variable is assigned a type higher than that of the set asserted to exist. This is a [[impredicative|predicativity]] restriction, though NFI is not a predicative theory: it admits enough impredicativity to define the set of natural numbers (defined as the intersection of all inductive sets; note that the inductive sets quantified over are of the same type as the set of natural numbers being defined). Crabbé also discussed a subtheory of NFI, in which only parameters (free variables) are allowed to have the type of the set asserted to exist by an instance of ''Comprehension''. He called the result "predicative NF" (NFP); it is, of course, doubtful whether any theory with a self-membered universe is truly predicative. Holmes has {{date?}} shown that NFP has the same consistency strength as the predicative theory of types of ''[[Principia Mathematica]]'' without the [[Axiom of reducibility]].

Since 2015, several candidate proofs by Randall Holmes of the consistency of NF relative to ZF have been available both on arxiv and on the logician's home page. Holmes demonstrates the equiconsistency of a 'weird' variant of TST, namely TTT&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; - 'tangled type theory with λ-types'  - with NF.  Holmes next shows that TTT&lt;sub&gt;λ&lt;/sub&gt; is consistent relative to ZFA that is, ZF with atoms but without choice.  Holmes demonstrates this by constructing in ZFA+C that is ZF with atoms and choice, a class model of ZFA which includes 'tangled webs of cardinals' . The candidate proofs are all rather long, but no irrecoverable faults have been identified by the NF community so far.

==How NF(U) avoids the set-theoretic paradoxes==
NF steers clear of the three well-known [[paradox]]es of [[set theory]]. That NFU, a [[Consistency|consistent]] (relative to Peano arithmetic) theory, also avoids the paradoxes may increase one's confidence in this fact.

The ''[[Russell paradox]]'': An easy matter; &lt;math&gt;x \not\in x&lt;/math&gt; is not a stratified formula, so the existence of &lt;math&gt;\{x \mid x \not\in x\}&lt;/math&gt; is not asserted by any instance of ''Comprehension''. Quine said that he constructed NF with this paradox uppermost in mind.

''[[Cantor's paradox]]'' of the largest [[cardinal number]] exploits the application of [[Cantor's theorem]] to the [[universal set]]. [[Cantor's theorem]] says (given ZFC) that the [[power set]] &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; of any set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; is larger than &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; (there can be no [[Injective function|injection]] (one-to-one map) from &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;). Now of course there is an [[Injective function|injection]] from &lt;math&gt;P(V)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;, if &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt; is the universal set! The resolution requires that one observes that &lt;math&gt;|A| &lt; |P(A)|&lt;/math&gt; makes no sense in the theory of types: the type of &lt;math&gt;P(A)&lt;/math&gt; is one higher than the type of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The correctly typed version (which is a theorem in the theory of types for essentially the same reasons that the original form of [[Cantor's theorem]] works in [[Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory|ZF]]) is &lt;math&gt;|P_1(A)| &lt; |P(A)|&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;P_1(A)&lt;/math&gt; is the set of one-element subsets of &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt;. The specific instance of this theorem of interest is &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)| &lt; |P(V)|&lt;/math&gt;: there are fewer one-element sets than sets (and so fewer one-element sets than general objects, if we are in NFU). The "obvious" [[bijection]] &lt;math&gt;x \mapsto \{x\}&lt;/math&gt; from the universe to the one-element sets is not a set; it is not a set because its definition is unstratified. Note that in all known models of NFU it is the case that &lt;math&gt;|P_1(V)| &lt; |P(V)| &lt;&lt; |V|&lt;/math&gt;; ''Choice'' allows one not only to prove that there are urelements but that there are many cardinals between &lt;math&gt;|P(V)|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;|V|&lt;/math&gt;.

One can now introduce some useful notions. A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the intuitively appealing &lt;math&gt;|A| = |P_1(A)|&lt;/math&gt; is said to be '''Cantorian''': a Cantorian set satisfies the usual form of [[Cantor's theorem]]. A set &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; which satisfies the further condition that &lt;math&gt;(x \mapsto \{x\})\lceil A&lt;/math&gt;, the [[restriction (mathematics)|restriction]] of the [[singleton (mathematics)|singleton]] map to ''A'', is a set is not only Cantorian set but '''strongly Cantorian'''.

The ''[[Burali-Forti paradox]]'' of the largest [[ordinal number]] goes as follows. Define (following [[naive set theory]]) the ordinals as [[equivalence class]]es of [[well-ordering]]s under [[isomorphism]]. There is an obvious natural well-ordering on the ordinals; since it is a well-ordering it belongs to an ordinal &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. It is straightforward to prove (by [[transfinite induction]]) that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than a given ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; itself. But this means that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt; \Omega &lt;/math&gt; and so is strictly less than the order type of all the ordinals — but the latter is, by definition, &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; itself!

The solution to the paradox in NF(U) starts with the observation that the order type of the natural order on the ordinals less than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is of a higher type than &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. Hence a type level [[ordered pair]] is two types higher than the type of its arguments and the usual Kuratowski ordered pair four types higher. For any order type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, we can define an order type &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; one type higher: if &lt;math&gt;W \in \alpha&lt;/math&gt;, then &lt;math&gt;T(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the order &lt;math&gt;W^{\iota} = \{(\{x\},\{y\}) \mid xWy\}&lt;/math&gt;. The triviality of the T operation is only a seeming one; it is easy to show that T is a strictly [[monotonic function|monotone]] (order preserving) operation on the ordinals.

Now the lemma on order types may be restated in a stratified manner: the order type of the natural order on the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T^2(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;T^4(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;
depending on which pair is used (we assume the type level pair hereinafter). From this one may deduce that the order type on the ordinals &lt;math&gt; &lt;\Omega &lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;T^2(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;, and thus  &lt;math&gt;T^2(\Omega)&lt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt;. Hence the T operation is not a function; there cannot be a strictly monotone set map from ordinals to ordinals which sends an ordinal downward! Since T is monotone, we have &lt;math&gt;\Omega &gt; T^2(\Omega) &gt; T^4(\Omega)\ldots&lt;/math&gt;, a "descending sequence" in the ordinals which cannot be a set.

One might assert that this result shows that no model of NF(U) is "standard", since the ordinals in any model of NFU are externally not well-ordered. One need not take a position on this, but can note that it is also a theorem of NFU that any set model of NFU has non-well-ordered "ordinals"; NFU does not conclude that the universe ''V'' is a model of NFU, despite ''V'' being a set, because the membership relation is not a set relation.

For a further development of mathematics in NFU, with a comparison to the development of the same in ZFC, see [[implementation of mathematics in set theory]].

==The system ML (Mathematical Logic) ==

ML is an extension of NF that includes proper classes as well as sets.
The set theory of the 1940 first edition of [[Willard Van Orman Quine|Quine]]'s ''Mathematical Logic'' married NF to the [[proper class]]es of [[Von Neumann-Bernays-Godel set theory|NBG set theory]], and included an axiom schema of unrestricted comprehension for proper classes. However {{harvs|txt|first=J. Barkley|last= Rosser|authorlink=J. Barkley Rosser|year=1942}} proved that the system presented in ''Mathematical Logic'' was subject to the Burali-Forti paradox. This result does not apply to NF. {{harvs|txt|authorlink=Hao Wang (academic)|first=Hao |last=Wang|year=1950}} showed how to amend Quine's axioms for ML so as to avoid this problem, and Quine included the resulting axiomatization in the 1951 second and final edition of ''Mathematical Logic''.

Wang proved that if NF is consistent then so is the revised ML, and also showed that the revised ML can prove the consistency of NF, that is that NF and  the revised ML are equiconsistent.

==Models of NFU==
There is a fairly simple method for producing models of NFU in bulk. Using well-known techniques of [[model theory]], one can construct a nonstandard model of [[Zermelo set theory]] (nothing nearly as strong as full ZFC is needed for the basic technique) on which there is an external automorphism ''j'' (not a set of the model) which moves a [[rank (set theory)|rank]] &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; of the cumulative [[hierarchy]] of sets. We may suppose without loss of generality that &lt;math&gt;j(\alpha)&lt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. We talk about the [[automorphism]] moving the rank rather than the ordinal because we do not want to assume that every ordinal in the model is the index of a rank.

The domain of the model of NFU will be the nonstandard rank &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;. The membership relation of the model of NFU will be

*&lt;math&gt;x \in_{NFU} y \equiv_{def} j(x) \in y \wedge y \in V_{j(\alpha)+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

It may now be proved that this actually is a model of NFU. Let &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; be a stratified formula in the language of NFU. Choose an assignment of types to all variables in the formula which witnesses the fact that it is stratified. Choose a natural number ''N'' greater than all types assigned to variables by this stratification.

Expand the formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; into a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; in the language of the nonstandard model of [[Zermelo set theory]] with [[automorphism]] ''j'' using the definition of membership in the model of NFU. Application of any power of ''j'' to both sides of an equation or membership statement preserves its [[truth value]] because ''j'' is an automorphism. Make such an application to each [[atomic formula]] in &lt;math&gt;\phi_1&lt;/math&gt; in such a way that each variable ''x'' assigned type ''i'' occurs with exactly &lt;math&gt;N-i&lt;/math&gt; applications of ''j''. This is possible thanks to the form of the atomic membership statements derived from NFU membership statements, and to the formula being stratified. Each quantified sentence &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \in V_{\alpha}.\psi(j^{N-i}(x)))&lt;/math&gt; can be converted to the form &lt;math&gt;(\forall x \in j^{N-i}(V_{\alpha}).\psi(x))&lt;/math&gt; (and similarly for [[existential quantifier]]s). Carry out this transformation everywhere and obtain a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_2&lt;/math&gt; in which ''j'' is never applied to a bound variable.

Choose any free variable ''y'' in &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; assigned type ''i''. Apply &lt;math&gt;j^{i-N}&lt;/math&gt; uniformly to the entire formula to obtain a formula &lt;math&gt;\phi_3&lt;/math&gt; in which ''y'' appears without any application of ''j''. Now &lt;math&gt;\{y \in V_{\alpha} \mid \phi_3\}&lt;/math&gt; exists (because ''j'' appears applied only to free variables and constants), belongs to &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt;, and contains exactly those ''y'' which satisfy the original formula
&lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; in the model of NFU. &lt;math&gt;j(\{y \in V_{\alpha} \mid \phi_3\})&lt;/math&gt; has this extension in the model of NFU (the application of ''j'' corrects for the different definition of membership in the model of NFU). This establishes that ''Stratified Comprehension'' holds in the model of NFU.

To see that weak ''Extensionality'' holds is straightforward: each nonempty element of &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)+1}&lt;/math&gt; inherits a unique extension from the nonstandard model, the empty set inherits its usual extension as well, and all other objects are urelements.

The basic idea is that the automorphism ''j'' codes the "power set" &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha+1}&lt;/math&gt; of our "universe" &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; into its externally isomorphic copy &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)+1}&lt;/math&gt; inside our "universe." The remaining objects not coding subsets of the universe are treated as [[urelement]]s.

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a natural number ''n'', one gets a model of NFU which claims that the universe is finite (it is externally infinite, of course). If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is infinite and the ''[[Axiom of Choice|Choice]]'' holds in the nonstandard model of ZFC, one obtains a model of NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice''.

=== Self-sufficiency of mathematical foundations in NFU ===
For philosophical reasons, it is important to note that it is not necessary to work in [[ZFC]] or any related system to carry out this proof. A common argument against the use of NFU as a foundation for mathematics is that the reasons for relying on it have to do with the intuition that ZFC is correct. It is sufficient to accept TST (in fact TSTU). In outline: take the type theory TSTU (allowing urelements in each positive type) as a metatheory and consider the theory of set models of TSTU in TSTU (these models will be sequences of sets &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; (all of the same type in the metatheory) with embeddings of each &lt;math&gt;P(T_i)&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;P_1(T_{i+1})&lt;/math&gt; coding embeddings of the power set of &lt;math&gt;T_i&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T_{i+1}&lt;/math&gt; in a type-respecting manner). Given an embedding of &lt;math&gt;T_0&lt;/math&gt; into &lt;math&gt;T_1&lt;/math&gt; (identifying elements of the base "type" with subsets of the base type), embeddings may be defined from each "type" into its successor in a natural way. This can be generalized to transfinite sequences &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; with care.

Note that the construction of such sequences of sets is limited by the size of the type in which they are being constructed; this prevents TSTU from proving its own consistency (TSTU + ''Infinity'' can prove the consistency of TSTU; to prove the consistency of TSTU+''Infinity'' one needs a type containing a set of cardinality &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt;, which cannot be proved to exist in TSTU+''Infinity'' without stronger assumptions). Now the same results of model theory can be used to build a model of NFU and verify that it is a model of NFU in much the same way, with the &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;'s being used in place of &lt;math&gt;V_{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt; in the usual construction. The final move is to observe that since NFU is consistent, we can drop the use of absolute types in our metatheory, bootstrapping the metatheory from TSTU to NFU.

=== Facts about the automorphism ''j'' ===
The [[automorphism]] ''j'' of a model of this kind is closely related to certain natural operations in NFU. For example, if ''W'' is a [[well-ordering]] in the nonstandard model (we suppose here that we use [[ordered pair|Kuratowski pairs]] so that the coding of functions in the two theories will agree to some extent) which is also a well-ordering in NFU (all well-orderings of NFU are well-orderings in the nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory, but not vice versa, due to the formation of [[urelement]]s in the construction of the model), and ''W'' has type α in NFU, then ''j''(''W'') will be a well-ordering of type ''T''(α) in NFU.

In fact, ''j'' is coded by a function in the model of NFU. The function in the nonstandard model which sends the singleton of any element of &lt;math&gt;V_{j(\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt; to its sole element, becomes in NFU a function which sends each singleton {''x''}, where ''x'' is any object in the universe, to ''j''(''x''). Call this function ''Endo'' and let it have the following properties: ''Endo'' is an [[Injective function|injection]] from the set of singletons into the set of sets, with the property that ''Endo''( {''x''} ) = {''Endo''( {''y''} ) | ''y''∈''x''} for each set ''x''. This function can define a type level "membership" relation on the universe, one reproducing the membership relation of the original nonstandard model.

==Strong axioms of infinity==
In this section the effect is considered of adding various "strong axioms of infinity" to our usual base theory, NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Choice''. This base theory, known consistent, has the same strength as TST + ''Infinity'', or Zermelo set theory with ''Separation'' restricted to bounded formulas (Mac Lane set theory).

One can add to this base theory strong axioms of infinity familiar from the [[ZFC]] context, such as "there exists an inaccessible cardinal," but it is more natural to consider assertions about Cantorian and strongly Cantorian sets. Such assertions not only bring into being [[large cardinal]]s of the usual sorts, but strengthen the theory on its own terms.

The weakest of the usual strong principles is:

*'''Rosser's Axiom of Counting'''. The set of natural numbers is a strongly Cantorian set.

To see how natural numbers are defined in NFU, see [[set-theoretic definition of natural numbers]]. The original form of this axiom given by Rosser was "the set {''m''|1≤''m''≤''n''} has ''n'' members", for each natural number ''n''. This intuitively obvious assertion is unstratified: what is provable in NFU is "the set {''m''|1≤''m''≤''n''} has &lt;math&gt;T^2(n)&lt;/math&gt; members" (where the ''T'' operation on cardinals is defined by &lt;math&gt;T(|A|) = |P_1(A)|&lt;/math&gt;; this raises the type of a cardinal by one). For any cardinal number (including natural numbers) to assert &lt;math&gt;T(|A|) = |A|&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to asserting that the sets ''A'' of that cardinality are Cantorian (by a usual abuse of language, we refer to such cardinals as "Cantorian cardinals"). It is straightforward to show that the assertion that each natural number is Cantorian is equivalent to the assertion that the set of all natural numbers is strongly Cantorian.

''Counting'' is consistent with NFU, but increases its consistency strength noticeably; not, as one would expect, in the area of arithmetic, but in higher set theory. NFU + ''Infinity'' proves that each &lt;math&gt;\beth_n&lt;/math&gt; exists, but not that &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\omega}&lt;/math&gt; exists; NFU + ''Counting'' (easily) proves ''Infinity'', and further proves the existence of &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beth_n}&lt;/math&gt; for each n, but not the existence of &lt;math&gt;\beth_{\beth_{\omega}}&lt;/math&gt;. (See [[beth number]]s).

''Counting'' implies immediately that one does not need to assign types to variables restricted to the set &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of natural numbers for purposes of stratification; it is a theorem that the [[power set]] of a strongly Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian, so it is further not necessary to assign types to variables restricted to any iterated power set of the natural numbers, or to such familiar sets as the set of real numbers, the set of functions from reals to reals, and so forth. The set-theoretical strength of ''Counting'' is less important in practice than the convenience of not having to annotate variables known to have natural number values (or related kinds of values) with singleton brackets, or to apply the ''T'' operation in order to get stratified set definitions.

''Counting'' implies ''Infinity''; each of the axioms below needs to be adjoined to NFU + ''Infinity'' to get the effect of strong variants of ''Infinity''; [[Ali Enayat]] has investigated the strength of some of these axioms in models of NFU + "the universe is finite".

A model of the kind constructed above satisfies ''Counting'' just in case the automorphism ''j'' fixes all natural numbers in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory.

The next strong axiom we consider is the

*'''Axiom of strongly Cantorian separation''': For any strongly Cantorian set ''A'' and any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily stratified!) the set {''x''∈''A''|φ} exists.

Immediate consequences include Mathematical Induction for unstratified conditions (which is not a consequence of ''Counting''; many but not all unstratified instances of induction on the natural numbers follow from ''Counting'').

This axiom is surprisingly strong. Unpublished work of [[Robert Solovay]] shows that the consistency strength of the theory NFU* = NFU + ''Counting'' + ''Strongly Cantorian Separation'' is the same as that of Zermelo set theory + &lt;math&gt;\Sigma_2&lt;/math&gt; ''Replacement''.

This axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with ''Choice'') if the ordinals which are fixed by ''j'' and dominate only ordinals fixed by ''j'' in the underlying nonstandard model of Zermelo set theory are standard, and the power set of any such ordinal in the model is also standard. This condition is sufficient but not necessary.

Next is

*'''Axiom of Cantorian Sets''': Every Cantorian set is strongly Cantorian.

This very simple and appealing assertion is extremely strong. Solovay has shown the precise equivalence of the consistency strength of the theory NFUA = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Cantorian Sets'' with that of ZFC + a schema asserting the existence of an ''n''-Mahlo cardinal for each concrete natural number ''n''. Ali Enayat has shown that the theory of Cantorian equivalence classes of well-founded extensional relations (which gives a natural picture of an initial segment of the cumulative hierarchy of ZFC) interprets the extension of ZFC with ''n''-Mahlo cardinals directly. A permutation technique can be applied to a model of this theory to give a model in which the hereditarily strongly Cantorian sets with the usual membership relation model the strong extension of ZFC.

This axiom holds in a model of the kind constructed above (with ''Choice'') just in case the ordinals fixed by ''j'' in the underlying nonstandard model of [[ZFC]] are an initial (proper class) segment of the ordinals of the model.

Next consider the

*'''Axiom of Cantorian Separation''': For any Cantorian set A and any formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; (not necessarily stratified!) the set {''x''∈''A''|φ} exists.

This combines the effect of the two preceding axioms and is actually even stronger (precisely how is not known). Unstratified mathematical induction enables proving that there are ''n''-Mahlo cardinals for every ''n'', given ''Cantorian Sets'', which gives an extension of [[ZFC]] that is even stronger than the previous one, which only asserts that there are ''n''-Mahlos for each concrete natural number (leaving open the possibility of nonstandard counterexamples).

This axiom will hold in a model of the kind described above if every ordinal fixed by ''j'' is standard, and every [[power set]] of an ordinal fixed by ''j'' is also standard in the underlying model of [[ZFC]]. Again, this condition is sufficient but not necessary.

An ordinal is said to be ''Cantorian'' if it is fixed by ''T'', and ''strongly Cantorian'' if it dominates only Cantorian ordinals (this implies that it is itself Cantorian). In models of the kind constructed above, Cantorian ordinals of NFU correspond to ordinals fixed by ''j'' (they are not the same objects because different definitions of ordinal numbers are used in the two theories).

Equal in strength to ''Cantorian Sets'' is the

*'''Axiom of Large Ordinals''': For each non-Cantorian ordinal &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, there is a natural number ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega) &lt; \alpha&lt;/math&gt;.

Recall that &lt;math&gt;\Omega&lt;/math&gt; is the order type of the natural order on all ordinals. This only implies ''Cantorian Sets'' if we have ''Choice'' (but is at that level of consistency strength in any case). It is remarkable that one can even define &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt;: this is the ''n''th term &lt;math&gt;s_n&lt;/math&gt; of any finite sequence of ordinals ''s'' of length ''n'' such that &lt;math&gt;s_0 = \Omega&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;s_{i+1} = T(s_i)&lt;/math&gt; for each appropriate ''i''. This definition is completely unstratified. The uniqueness of &lt;math&gt;T^n(\Omega)&lt;/math&gt; can be proved (for those ''n'' for which it exists) and a certain amount of common-sense reasoning about this notion can be carried out, enough to show that ''Large Ordinals'' implies ''Cantorian Sets'' in the presence of ''Choice''. In spite of the knotty formal statement of this axiom, it is a very natural assumption, amounting to making the action of ''T'' on the ordinals as simple as possible.

A model of the kind constructed above will satisfy ''Large Ordinals'', if the ordinals moved by ''j'' are exactly the ordinals which dominate some &lt;math&gt;j^{-i}(\alpha)&lt;/math&gt; in the underlying nonstandard model of [[ZFC]].

*'''Axiom of Small Ordinals''': For any formula φ, there is a set ''A'' such that the elements of ''A'' which are strongly Cantorian ordinals are exactly the strongly Cantorian ordinals such that φ.

Solovay has shown the precise equivalence in consistency strength of NFUB = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Cantorian Sets'' + ''Small Ordinals'' with [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] plus the assertion that the proper class ordinal (the class of all ordinals) is a [[weakly compact cardinal]]. This is very strong indeed! Moreover, NFUB-, which is NFUB with ''Cantorian Sets'' omitted, is easily seen to have the same strength as NFUB.

A model of the kind constructed above will satisfy this axiom if every collection of ordinals fixed by ''j'' is the intersection of some set of ordinals with the ordinals fixed by ''j'', in the underlying nonstandard model of ZFC.

Even stronger is the theory NFUM = NFU + ''Infinity'' + ''Large Ordinals'' + ''Small Ordinals''. This is equivalent to [[Morse–Kelley set theory]] with a predicate on the classes which is a κ-complete nonprincipal [[ultrafilter]] on the proper class ordinal κ; in effect, this is Morse–Kelley set theory + "the proper class ordinal is a [[measurable cardinal]]"!

The technical details here are not the main point, which is that reasonable and natural (in the context of NFU) assertions turn out to be equivalent in power to very strong axioms of infinity in the [[ZFC]] context. This fact is related to the correlation between the existence of models of NFU, described above and satisfying these axioms, and the existence of models of [[ZFC]] with [[automorphism]]s having special properties.

The '''New Testament''' uses a number of '''[[military]] [[metaphor]]s''' in discussing Christianity, especially in the [[Pauline epistles]].

In [[Epistle to the Philippians|Philippians]] 2:25&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philippians+2:25&amp;version=NIV Philippians 2:25, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Epistle to Philemon|Philemon]] 1:2,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Philemon+1:2&amp;version=NIV Philemon 1:2, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul of Tarsus|Paul]] describes fellow Christians as "fellow soldiers" (in Greek, συστρατιώτῃ, ''sustratiōtē'').&lt;ref&gt;[[Peter Thomas O'Brien]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IpbiGkWRKc0C&amp;pg=PA330 The Epistle to the Philippians: A commentary on the Greek text]'', Eerdmans, 1991, {{ISBN|0-85364-531-0}}, pp. 330–331.&lt;/ref&gt; The image of a soldier is also used in [[Second Epistle to Timothy|2 Timothy]] 2:3–4&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2%20Timothy%202:3-4&amp;version=NIV 2 Timothy 2:3–4, NIV (BibleGateway):] "Endure hardship with us like a good soldier of Christ Jesus. No one serving as a soldier gets involved in civilian affairs—he wants to please his commanding officer."&lt;/ref&gt; as a metaphor for courage, loyalty and dedication;&lt;ref&gt;John Norman Davidson Kelly, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=t84kfQfTB50C&amp;pg=PA175 A Commentary on the Pastoral Epistles: I Timothy, II Timothy, Titus]'', Part 1, Continuum International Publishing Group, 1963, {{ISBN|0-7136-1366-1}}, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; this is followed by the [[New Testament athletic metaphors|metaphor of an athlete]], emphasising hard work.  In [[First Epistle to the Corinthians|1 Corinthians]] 9:7,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1%20Corinthians+9:7&amp;version=NIV 1 Corinthians 9:7, NIV (BibleGateway):] "Who serves as a soldier at his own expense?"&lt;/ref&gt; this image is used in a discussion of church workers receiving payment, with a metaphorical reference to a soldier's [[Field ration|rations]] and expenses.&lt;ref&gt;[[Anthony Thiselton|Anthony C. Thiselton]], ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=IHG_DNLpmroC&amp;pg=PA683 The First Epistle to the Corinthians: A Commentary on the Greek text]'', Eerdmans, 2000, {{ISBN|0-85364-559-0}}, pp. 683–684.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Epistle to the Ephesians|Ephesians]] 6:10–18&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Ephesians%206:10-18&amp;version=NIV Ephesians 6:10–18, NIV (BibleGateway).]&lt;/ref&gt; discusses [[Faith in Christianity|faith]], [[righteousness]], and other elements of Christianity as the [[armor of God|armour of God]], and this imagery is replicated by [[John Bunyan]] in ''[[The Pilgrim's Progress]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen M. Swaim, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZGkcyQCitkYC&amp;pg=PA14 Pilgrim's Progress, Puritan Progress: Discourses and Contexts]'', University of Illinois Press, 1993, {{ISBN|0-252-01894-X}}, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; and by many other Christian writers.

Related imagery appears in hymns such as "[[Soldiers of Christ, Arise]]" and "[[Onward, Christian Soldiers]]".&lt;ref&gt;Alison G.

'''Nose tombs''' ({{Lang-ja|鼻の墓}} ''hana no haka''; {{Lang-ko|코 무덤}} ''ko mudeom'') are [[tombs]] that contain [[human nose]]s or other body parts that were brought back to [[Japan]] as trophies during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]] in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Diamond | first = Jared | title = The Japanese Roots (Part 1) | publisher = Association for Asia Research | date = 2004-10-27 | url = http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2348.html | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[War trophies]] were a part of Japanese tradition at the time and [[samurai]] warriors were often paid according to how many they collected.

One such nose tomb was discovered in 1983 in [[Okayama]] near [[Osaka]].

"'''Orwellian'''" is an adjective describing a situation, idea, or societal condition that [[George Orwell]] identified as being destructive to the welfare of a free and [[open society]].

Perhaps the most commonly agreed-upon "overclass" consists of leaders in [[international business]], [[International finance|finance]] and the [[war industry]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = [[David Rothkopf|Rothkopf, David J.]] | title = Superclass: the global power elite and the world they are making | publisher = [[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]] | year = 2008 | isbn = 0-374-27210-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The influence of the actions by the overclass have been rigorously studied, particularly with regards to notions of intersections between the overclass and specific races.  Most notable of these racial overclasses is the [[NEWBO]], or NEW Black Overclass in America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/29413966/ns/business-cnbc_tv/t/cnbc-special-report-new-black-overclass/ |title=CNBC Special Report: The New Black Overclass |last1=Hawkins |first1=Lee |date=February 26, 2009 |website=nbcnews.com |publisher=[[NBCNews.com]] |access-date=September 7, 2016 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some writers compare it to the more familiar ''[[underclass]]'':

{{quote|We now have a quite new phenomenon in the history of the republic: two radically isolated sectors of the population, the underclass and the overclass.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16700">The '''paternal rights and abortion''' issue is an extension of both the [[abortion debate]] and the [[fathers' rights]] movement.  “About 98.3% of abortions in the United States are elective, including socio-economic reasons or for birth control. The remaining 1.3% occurs due the following reasons: in cases of rape, 0.3%; in cases of incest, 0.03%; in cases of risk to maternal life, 0.1%; in cases of risk to maternal health, 0.8%; and in cases of fetal health issues, 0.5%” &lt;ref name="Sarchive"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sarchive |first1=Johnston |title=Reasons given for abortion in the United States |url=http://www.johnstonsarchive.net/policy/abortion/abreasons.html |accessdate=October 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of majority of abortions are planned, abortion is becoming a factor for disagreement and lawsuit between partners.

==History==
[[Roman law]] allowed induced abortions but regulated it in consideration of the biological father. [[Roman Emperor|Emperor]] [[Septimius Severus]] ruled circa 211 AD that a woman who had an abortion without consent from her husband should face [[exile]] for having bereaved her husband of children.&lt;ref name="riddle1"&gt;[[John M. Riddle]] (1992). ''Contraception and Abortion from the Ancient World to the Renaissance.''

Retrieved June 9, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

In his [[orator|speech]] ''[[Pro Cluentio]]'', delivered in 66 BC, [[Cicero]] refers to a case he had heard of in which a woman from [[Miletus]] was [[capital punishment|sentenced to death]] for having aborted her pregnancy, upon receiving [[bribery|bribes]] from those who stood to [[inheritance|inherit]] her husband's [[Estate (law)|estate]] if he produced no heir. Cicero said that in doing so she had "destroyed the hope of the father, the memory of his name, the supply of his race, the heir of his family, a citizen intended for the use of the republic".&lt;ref&gt;Cicero. (66 BC). [http://www.uah.edu/student_life/organizations/SAL/texts/latin/classical/cicero/procluentio.html  Pro Cluentio] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060601183417/http://www.uah.edu/student_life/organizations/SAL/texts/latin/classical/cicero/procluentio.html |date=2006-06-01 }}.

A 4th century BC [[Greeks|Greek]] writer from [[Alexandria]], [[Egypt]], Sopater, quoted the [[lawyer]] Lysias, who had referred to a trial in [[Athens]] in which a man named Antigene accused his wife of having deprived him of a son by having an abortion.&lt;ref name="riddle1" /&gt;

==Men and abortion in law==
Whether a male has a legal right to advance his personal interest, whether it be toward [[abortion]], [[father]]hood, or [[adoption]], over that of the female, differs by region.

In 2011, it was reported that [[Indonesia]], [[Malawi]], [[Syria]], [[United Arab Emirates]], [[Equatorial Guinea]], [[Kuwait]], [[Maldives]], [[Morocco]], [[South Korea]], [[Saudi Arabia]], [[Japan]], [[Taiwan]] and [[Turkey]] all had laws which required that an abortion first be authorized by the woman's husband.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.reproductiverights.org/sites/crr.civicactions.net/files/documents/AbortionMap_2011.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; However, in some countries, this stipulation could be bypassed or overridden if there is genuine concern for maternal health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rahman, Anika |author2=Katzive, Laura |author3=Henshaw, Stanley K. |title=A Global Review of Laws on Induced Abortion, 1985–1997 |journal=International Family Planning Perspectives |volume=24 |issue=2 |pages= |year=1998 |doi= |url=http://www.guttmacher.org/pubs/journals/2405698.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since ''[[Roe v. Wade]]'', some [[U.S. state|states]] in the [[United States]] have attempted to enact laws requiring spousal consent. All of these laws have been ruled unconstitutional, spousal consent in the 1976 decision ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Danforth]]'' and spousal awareness in the 1992 decision ''[[Planned Parenthood v. Casey]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Planned Parenthood of Central Missouri v. Danforth |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/supremecourt/text/428/52 |website=Legal Information Institute |accessdate=October 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal cases===
In China the husband of a woman who had an abortion filed a [[lawsuit]] against her in 2002 under a law intended to grant [[sexual equality]] in terms of [[Sexual reproduction|childbearing]] and [[birth control|contraceptive]] decisions. The law stated that a woman has no overriding priority over her spouse in deciding whether to have a child.&lt;ref&gt;Maximova, Vickie.

A number of [[legal case]]s have arisen in the Western world in which men have tried to prevent women with whom they had been sexually active from obtaining an abortion, all of which failed:

*'''1978''': William Paton of [[Liverpool]], [[United Kingdom]] attempted to stop his separated wife, Joan, from undergoing an abortion in the 1978 case ''Paton v. Trustees of British Pregnancy Advisory Service Trustees''. A judge ruled in his wife's favour and Mr. Paton's later request for a hearing before the [[European Court of Human Rights]] was also denied.&lt;ref name="nolan"&gt;Nolan, David.

''Catholic Medical Quarterly.'' Retrieved May 29, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1987''':  Robert Carver of the United Kingdom tried to prevent an abortion in the 1987 case ''C v. S''. He claimed that the Infant Life (Preservation) Act applied to the fetus, as, at the time, his ex-girlfriend was 21 weeks along. When the [[High Court of Justice]] and the [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] dismissed the case, it was brought before the [[House of Lords]], where three [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lord]]s sided with the earlier decisions. The entire legal process took 36 hours, as the Health Authority refused to allow an abortion before a decision was reached, making it one of the fastest cases in the history of [[law of the United Kingdom|British law]]. Nonetheless, the woman involved chose to carry the pregnancy to term and gave the [[infant|baby]] to Carver.&lt;ref name="nolan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bpas" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cmq" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Brahams D |title=An action by putative father and unborn fetus to prevent termination |journal=Lancet |volume=1 |issue=8532 |pages=576–7 |date=March 1987 |pmid=2881128 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0140-6736(87)90226-1 |doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(87)90226-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''1989''':  Jean-Guy Tremblay of [[Quebec]], filed an [[injunction]] against his girlfriend, Chantal Daigle, in attempt to prevent her from obtaining an induced abortion in the 1989 [[Canada|Canadian]] case ''[[Tremblay v.

The [[Supreme Court of Canada]] ultimately ruled that there was no precedent for a man's right to protect his "potential progeny", as a [[fetus]] was not found to have a [[right to life]] under the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]].

* '''2006''': [[Matt Dubay child support case]] was a legal case between Matt Dubay and his ex-girlfriend, both of [[Saginaw Charter Township, Michigan|Saginaw Township]], [[Michigan]]. Dubay claimed in court documents that he informed his ex-girlfriend he had no interest in becoming a father. Dubay also claimed in court documents that in response, she said she was infertile and that, as an extra layer of protection, she was using contraception.&lt;ref&gt;MATTHEW DUBAY v. LAUREN WELLS, an Individual, SAGINAW COUNTY PROSECUTING ATTORNEY'S OFFICE, by and through Michael D. Thomas, Prosecutor. UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SIXTH CIRCUIT. 6 Nov. 2007. Us Courts. Web. &lt;http://www.ca6.uscourts.gov/opinions.pdf/07a0442p-06.pdf&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The case was dubbed "''[[Roe v. Wade]]'' for Men" by the National Center for Men. Dubay's lawsuit was dismised by the judge.

==Controversy==
Those who support a man's right to intervene in a woman's reproductive decisions, argue that it is unreasonable that, after fertilisation has occurred, women are often given more options with regard to [[pregnancy]] and parenthood than men.&lt;ref name="young"&gt;Young, Cathy. (April 2003). "[http://www.reason.com/news/show/28737.html Aborting Equality: Men's Odd Place in the Abortion Debate]." ''Reason.''

Harris has written that, if a man impregnates a woman with the explicit goal of having a child, in a manner that is mutually consensual, then it would be morally unacceptable for that woman to later have an abortion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1086/292777 |author= Harris GW |title=  Fathers and fetuses |journal=Ethics |volume=96 |issue=3 |pages=594–603 |date=April 1986 |pmid=11658724 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who object to men having a right to direct involvement argue that because it is the woman's body carrying the unborn baby, her determination for or against abortion should be the only one.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wiley, Keith. (April 2001).

Retrieved June 11, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Marsha Garrison, a professor at [[Brooklyn Law School]], stated that U.S. courts acknowledge "that embryo is in the woman's body, it is within her and can't be separated from her, so it's not just her decision-making about whether to bear a child, it's about her body".&lt;ref&gt;[[Pam Belluck]].

===Pregnancy vetoing===
Bioethicist Jacob Appel has asked, “if one grants a man veto power over a woman’s choice to have an abortion in cases where he is willing to pay for the child, why not grant him the right to demand an abortion where he is unwilling to provide for the child?"&lt;ref&gt;Appel, Jacob M.  “Women’s Rights, Men’s Bodies,” New York Times, December 2, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opting out===
{{main|Paper Abortion}}
In reference to cases in which men who do not desire to become fathers have been required to pay [[child support]], Melanie McCulley, a South Carolina attorney, in her 1998 article, "The Male Abortion: The Putative Father's Right to Terminate His Interests in and Obligations to the Unborn Child," set forth the theory of the "male abortion," in which she argues that men should be able to terminate their legal obligations to unwanted children.&lt;ref name="young" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=McCulley MG |title=The male abortion: the putative father's right to terminate his interests in and obligations to the unborn child |journal=J Law Policy |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=1–55 |year=1988 |pmid=12666677 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Opting in====
It is also possible, rather than taking the stance that males should have the freedom to opt out of inherent responsibilities and rights, to take the stance that one must opt-in and agree to undertake those responsibilities to be compelled to follow them, and only through doing so, earn parental rights. This is what occurs during [[adoption]].

[[File:Pournelle chart color.gif|thumb|350px|The Pournelle chart]]
The '''Pournelle chart''', developed by [[Jerry Pournelle]] in his 1963 political science Ph.D. dissertation, is a two-dimensional coordinate system which can be used to distinguish [[List of political ideologies|political ideologies]]. It is similar to the [[political compass]] and the [[Nolan Chart]] in that it is a two-dimensional chart, but the axes of the Pournelle chart are different from those of other systems. The two axes are as follows:
* The x-axis, "Attitude toward the State" (labeled [[statism]]), refers to a [[political philosophy]]'s attitude toward the [[State (polity)|state]] and [[centralized government]]. The farthest right is "state worship" and the farthest left represents the state as the "ultimate evil", preferring [[individual freedom]].
* The y-axis, "Attitude toward planned social progress" (labeled [[rationalism]]), refers to the extent which a political philosophy is compatible with the idea that [[Social issue|social problems]] can be solved by the use of [[reason]]. The top indicates complete confidence in planned [[social progress]] and the bottom represents [[skepticism]] of such methods, often considering them as naively [[utopia]]n. Those at the top of the axis would tend to discard a traditional custom if they do not understand what purpose it serves (considering it antiquated and probably useless), while those at the bottom would tend to keep the custom (considering it time-tested and probably useful).

Pournelle arranged [[Modern liberalism in the United States|American liberalism]], [[socialism]], and [[communism]], in the upper right-hand quadrant of high state control and high rationalism. [[Conservatism]], [[fascism]], and [[Nazism]] are placed in the lower right hand quadrant of high state control and low rationalism. Classical [[Anarchism|anarchists]] are in the lower left hand corner of low state control and low rationalism. [[Libertarianism in the United States|Libertarians]] (including [[Anarcho-capitalism|anarcho-capitalists]]) and [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]] are placed in the upper left-hand corner of low state control and high rationalism. Each diagonal axis contains natural political allies.

'''Psychological pain''', '''mental pain''', or '''emotional pain''' is an unpleasant feeling (a [[suffering]]) of a psychological, non-physical origin. A pioneer in the field of [[suicidology]], [[Edwin S. Shneidman]], described it as "how much you hurt as a human being. It is mental suffering; mental torment."&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996"&gt;{{vcite book | author = Shneidman ES | authorlink = | editor = | others = | title = The Suicidal Mind | edition = | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = | year = 1996 | pages = 173 | isbn = | oclc = | chapter = Appendix A Psychological Pain Survey | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=rn4pf7-dca0C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=the+suicidal+mind&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=qIGjSw106n&amp;sig=A2b8DvJxC9gwoHPAJiiiEFaqdeU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=N74RUMWMDKjmiwKX8oHIAQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=the%20suicidal%20mind&amp;f=false | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no shortage in the many ways psychological pain is referred to, and using a different word usually reflects an emphasis on a particular aspect of mind life.

One way of grouping these different sources of pain was offered by Shneidman, who stated that psychological pain is caused by frustrated psychological needs.&lt;ref name="Shneidman_1996" /&gt;  For example, the need for love, autonomy, affiliation, and achievement, or the need to avoid harm, shame, and embarrassment. [[Psychological needs]] were originally described by [[Henry Murray]] in 1938 as needs that motivate human behavior.&lt;ref name="Murray_2008"&gt;{{ cite book  | author= Murray HA | title= Explorations in personality | edition = 70 | year= 2008 | publisher= Oxford University Press | location= New York, NY | isbn= 978-0-19-530506-7 | chapter= | chapterurl = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Shneidman maintained that people rate the importance of each need differently, which explains why people's level of psychological pain differs when confronted with the same frustrated need. This needs perspective coincides with [[Patrick David Wall]]'s description of physical pain that says that physical pain indicates a need state much more than a sensory experience.&lt;ref name="wall_1979"&gt;{{vcite journal | author = Wall PD. | title = On the relation of injury to pain| journal = Pain| volume = 6 | issue =  | pages = 253-64 | year = 1979 | pmid = | pmc = | doi = 10.1016/0304-3959(79)90047-2 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304395979900472| issn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the fields of [[social psychology]] and [[personality psychology]], the term social pain is used to denote psychological pain caused by harm or threat to social connection; bereavement, embarrassment, shame and hurt feelings are subtypes of social pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1= MacDonald |first1= Geoff |editor1-first= Philip J. |editor1-last= Corr |editor2-first= Gerald |editor2-last= Matthews |title= Cambridge Handbook of Personality Psychology |year= 2009 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |location= Cambridge UK |isbn= 9780521680516 |chapter= Social Pain and Hurt Feelings  |chapterurl=http://web.psych.utoronto.ca/gmacdonald/macdonald_social_pain_chapter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From an evolutionary perspective, psychological pain forces the assessment of actual or potential social problems that might reduce the individual's fitness for survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Thornhill R, Wilmsen Thornhill N. |editor1-first= RW |editor1-last= Bell |editor2-first= NJ |editor2-last= Bell |title= Sociobiology and the Social Sciences |year= 1989 |publisher= Texas Tech University Press |location= Lubbock, Texas |isbn= 0-89672-161-2 |chapter= The Evolution of Psychological Pain  |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The way we display our psychological pain socially (for example, crying, shouting, moaning) serves the purpose of indicating that we are in need.

==Emotional agony in borderline personality disorder==
{{Main|Borderline personality disorder}}
Borderline personality disorder (BPD) has long been believed to be the one psychiatric disorder that produced the most intense emotional pain, agony, and distress in those who suffer with this condition. Studies have shown that borderline patients experience chronic and significant emotional [[suffering]] and mental agony.&lt;ref name=PM&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fertuck|first1=EA.|last2=Jekal|first2=A.|last3=Song|first3=I.|last4=Wyman|first4=B.|last5=Morris|first5=MC.|last6=Wilson|first6=ST.|last7=Brodsky|first7=BS.|last8=Stanley|first8=B.|title=Enhanced 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' in borderline personality disorder compared to healthy controls|journal=Psychological Medicine|date=December 2009|volume=39|issue=12|pages=1979–1988|doi=10.1017/S003329170900600X|pmc=3427787|pmid=19460187}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DSM-IV&gt;{{cite book|title=Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-IV)|date=1994|publisher=American Psychiatric Association|location=Washington, DC|isbn=978-0-89-042061-4|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Borderline patients may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions, experiencing intense [[grief]] instead of sadness, shame and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment, rage instead of annoyance and panic instead of nervousness.&lt;ref name = Linehan_44&gt;{{harvnb|Linehan|1993|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with BPD are especially sensitive to feelings of rejection, isolation and perceived failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Stiglmayr CE, Grathwol T, Linehan MM, Ihorst G, Fahrenberg J, Bohus M |title=Aversive tension in patients with borderline personality disorder: a computer-based controlled field study |journal= [[Acta Psychiatr Scand]] |volume=111 |issue=5 |pages=372–9 |date=May 2005 |pmid=15819731 |doi=10.1111/j.1600-0447.2004.00466.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both clinicians and laymen alike have witnessed the desperate attempts to escape these subjective inner experiences of these patients. Borderline patients are severely impulsive and their attempts to alleviate the agony are often very destructive or self-destructive. Suicidal ideation, suicide attempts, eating disorders ([[anorexia nervosa]] and [[bulimia nervosa]]), self-harm (cutting, overdosing, etc.), compulsive spending, gambling, sex addiction, violent and aggressive behaviour, sexual promiscuity and deviant sexual behaviours, are desperate attempts to escape. The intrapsychic pain experienced by those diagnosed with BPD has been studied and compared to normal healthy controls and to others suffering from [[major depression]], bipolar disorder, [[substance use disorder]], schizophrenia, other [[personality disorder]]s, and a range of other conditions. The excruciatingly painful inner experience of the borderline patient is both unique and perplexing. In clinical populations, the rate of suicide of patients with borderline personality disorder is estimated to be 10%, a rate far greater than that in the general population and still considerably greater than for patients with [[schizophrenia]] and [[bipolar disorder]]. However, since 60–70% of patients with borderline personality disorder make suicide attempts; suicide attempts are far more frequent than completed suicides in patients with borderline personality disorder.&lt;ref name=Oldham&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Oldham|first1=JM|title=Borderline Personality Disorder and Suicidality|journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry|date=2006|volume=163|issue=1|pages=20–26|doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.163.1.20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The intense [[dysphoria|dysphoric]] states which patients diagnosed with borderline personality disorder (BPD) endure on a regular basis distinguishes them from those suffering from other personality disorders, [[major depressive disorder]], [[bipolar disorder]], and virtually all known Axis I and Axis II conditions. In a study, twenty-five dysphoric states (mostly affects) were found to be significantly more common among borderline patients than controls. Twenty-five other dysphoric states (mostly cognitions) were found to be both significantly more common among borderline patients than controls and highly specific to borderline personality disorder. These states tended to fall into one of four clusters: (1) extreme feelings, (2) destructiveness or self-destructiveness, (3) fragmentation or "identitylessness", and (4) victimization. In addition, three of the 25 more-specific states (feeling betrayed, like hurting myself, and completely out of control), when occurring together, were particularly strongly associated with the borderline diagnosis. Equally important, overall mean Dysphoric Affect Scale scores correctly distinguished borderline personality disorder from other personality disorders and mood disorders such as bipolar disorder, major depression, and anxiety disorders in 84% of the subjects. Taken together, the results of this study suggest that the subjective pain of borderline patients may be both more pervasive and more multifaceted than previously recognized, and that the overall “amplitude” (or intensity) of this pain may be a particularly good marker for the borderline diagnosis.&lt;ref name=BPDPain&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zanarini|first1=MC|last2=Gunderson|first2=JG|authorlink2=John G.

Research has shown that use of analgesic [[paracetamol]] for several weeks reduces neural response to meaning threats, such as thinking about death,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pss.sagepub.com/content/early/2013/04/11/0956797612464786.abstract|title=The Common Pain of Surrealism and Death|work=sagepub.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and reduces the agitation of people with dementia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bmj.com/content/343/bmj.d4065|title=Efficacy of treating pain to reduce behavioural disturbances in residents of nursing homes with dementia: cluster randomised clinical trial|work=bmj.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alzheimers.org.uk/site/scripts/documents_info.php?documentID=1713&amp;pageNumber=3|title=Reducing agitation through pain relief - Living with dementia magazine October 2011 - Alzheimer's Society|work=alzheimers.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; However use of paracetamol for more general psychological pain remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/news/2013/04April/Pages/paracetamol-not-recommended-for-painful-emotions.aspx|title=Don't take paracetamol for painful emotions|work=www.nhs.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many religious traditions, such as the [[Noble Eightfold Path]] in Buddhism, have attempted or managed to provide treatment of psychological suffering.

'''''R v Ryan''''' [2013] SCC 3 is a case concerning the availability of [[duress]] in the context of [[domestic violence]].

==Background==
Nicole Doucet Ryan (now Nicole Doucet) alleged that she was subject to repeated abuse and torment by her husband, Michael Ryan. At trial, the trial judge accepted she was subject to such abuse. The husband was never called to testify.   
In September 2007, Ms. Doucet began to think about having her husband murdered. Over the course of the next seven months, she spoke to at least three men whom she hoped would kill him. In December 2007 or January 2008, she paid one man $25,000 to carry out the killing, but he then refused, demanding more compensation. She approached another person and was contacted by a third, an undercover RCMP officer, posing as a “hit man”. On March 27, 2008, she met with this individual and agreed to pay him to kill her husband. The agreed upon price was $25,000, with $2,000 paid in cash that day. The killing was to take place the coming weekend. Later that same night, she provided an address and a picture of her husband to the “hit man.” Shortly after, she was arrested and charged with counselling the commission of an offence not committed contrary to s. 464(a) of the Criminal Code, R.S.C. 1985, c. C-46.

At trial, there was no issue that the elements of the offence had been proved and the trial judge, Farrar J. (as he then was), indicated that he was satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the requisite elements of the offence of counselling the commission of an offence had been established. He based this conclusion on the Ms. Doucet’s admission that the Crown had proved a prima facie case and on the audio and video tapes of recorded conversations with the undercover officer and a statement made on arrest. The only issue at trial was whether Ms. Doucet’s otherwise criminal acts were excused because of duress. The accused had raised that the common law defence of duress applied. The Crown argued that on the facts of this case, the components of duress were not present.  But it did not argue at trial, as it did later on appeal, that the defence of duress was not available in law to the accused. The trial judge accepted her version and acquitted her on the basis she had established she was acting under duress. 

The Nova Scotia Court of Appeal unanimously upheld her acquittal.

==Reasons of the court==
The Court allowed the Crown appeal. The majority entered a stay while the dissenting judge, Fish J., would have ordered a new trial, leaving it to the Crown to determine whether a retrial was in the public interest.

The Court accepted the facts found by the trial judge. The only issue was whether the defence of duress was available. The Court accepted the Crown’s argument, which was made for the first time, that duress was not available. Duress is available when one is compelled to commit a crime against an innocent third party. In this case, given the facts found by the trial judge, the husband would not be an innocent victim. Rather he would be the author of his own misfortune. Moreover, Ms. Doucet was never compelled to act as she did. The Court alluded to the possibility of invoking self-defence as a possible defence.

Fish J. found the granting of the stay of proceedings was inappropriate. He would have ordered a new trial. Any further defence advanced by the accused could be made then.

==Reactions==
Following the release of the decision on January 18, 2013, Michael Ryan, ex-husband of the accused denied any of the allegations made. He emphasized he was in attendance at court in response to a subpoena, but the Crown never called him as a witness.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/01/23/ns-hitman-michael-ryan.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A law professor from Dalhousie University called for a public inquiry. He questioned the rationale of the Crown not to call Mr. Ryan as a witness. He also was critical of the Court in making findings against the RCMP without having heard anything from the RCMP. He was also critical of the granting of a stay of proceedings, agreeing with Fish J. that it is an extreme remedy.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/nova-scotia/story/2013/02/05/ns-hit-man-case-inquiry-kaiser.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Racial tension in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]''', occurred mostly because of the city's volatile mixture of high numbers of new [[immigrants]] from southern and eastern Europe and African-American migrants from the [[Deep South]]. While racial discrimination existed at several levels, the violent outbreaks were within working classes. [[Irish in Omaha, Nebraska|Irish Americans]], the largest and earliest immigrant group in the 19th century, established the first neighborhoods in South Omaha.  All were attracted by new industrial jobs and most were from rural areas. There was competition among ethnic Irish, newer [[Ethnic groups in Omaha, Nebraska|European immigrants]], and African-American migrants from the South, for industrial jobs and housing. They all had difficulty adjusting to industrial demands, which were unmitigated by organized labor in the early years.  Some of the early labor organizing resulted in increasing tensions between groups, as later arrivals to the city were used as strikebreakers.
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Omaha Riot Infantry.jpg|thumb|Infantry deployed in the [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|Near North Side]] to protect blacks {1919}]] --&gt;
In Omaha as in other major cities, racial tension has erupted at times of social and economic strife, often taking the form of mob violence as different groups tried to assert power.  Much of the early violence came out of labor struggles in early 20th century industries: between working class ethnic whites and immigrants, and blacks of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]].  Meatpacking companies had used the latter for strikebreakers in 1917 as workers were trying to organize.  As veterans returned from World War I, both groups competed for jobs. By the late 1930s, however, interracial teams worked together to organize the meatpacking industry under the [[United Packinghouse Workers of America]] (UPWA).  Unlike the AFL and some other industrial unions in the CIO, UPWA was progressive.  It used its power to help end [[Racial segregation in the United States|segregation]] in restaurants and stores in Omaha, and supported the [[civil rights movement]] in the 1960s. Women labor organizers such as [[Tillie Olsen]] and [[Rowena Moore]] were active in the meatpacking industry in the 1930s and 1940s, respectively.

Most violence and civil unrest in the 1960s, by contrast, arose out of poverty and problems caused by massive loss of working-class jobs through industrial restructuring.  The city's African-American community suffered particularly and erupted in protest.

==19th century==
The [[Nebraska Territory]] was created in 1854 with the condition that the area stay slave-free. But, from 1855 on, there was debate in the [[Nebraska State Legislature|Territorial Legislature]] about whether slavery should specifically be prohibited. As there were few slaves in the state, some legislators did not think the bill was needed.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D. (2002) ''A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha.'' Caxton Press.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1859, the ''Daily Nebraskian'' newspaper reported its favoring of [[slavery]], writing,

:The bill introduced in [Omaha City] Council, for the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] in this Territory, was called up yesterday, and its further consideration postponed for two weeks. A strong effort will be made among the Republicans to secure its passage; we think, however, it will fail. The farce certainly cannot be enacted if the Democrats do their duty.&lt;ref&gt;A ''Daily Nebraskian'' newspaper editorial from 1859, as quoted in Bristow, D. (2002) ''A Dirty, Wicked Town: Tale of 19th Century Omaha.'' Caxton Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

During that period, some local newspapers openly editorialized against the presence of blacks in Omaha, for the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] and against the election of [[Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref&gt;Several sources in Bristow, D. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; The 1860 census showed that of the 81 Negroes in Nebraska, only 10 were slaves.&lt;ref&gt;(1938) [http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/r?ammem/wpa:@field(DOCID+@lit(wpa116041210+)) Authur Goodlett]. ''American Life Histories: Manuscripts from the Federal Writers' Project, 1936-1940''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because a clause in the original proposed [[Nebraska Territory#History|Nebraska State Constitution]] limited [[voting rights]] in the state to "free white males", as had been common in many states, Nebraska was delayed about a year from entering the Union. In 1865, the Nebraska Territorial Legislature changed the proposed State Constitution to provide expanded suffrage.  The territory gained statehood soon after.

Following the Civil War, enough blacks lived in Omaha to organize [[St. John African Methodist Episcopal Church (Omaha, Nebraska)|St. John's African Methodist Episcopal Church]] in 1867 as the first church for African Americans in Nebraska.&lt;ref&gt;(2003) [http://www.memoriallibrary.com/NE/Ethnic/Negro/church.htm The Negroes of Nebraska: The Negro goes to church.] Memorial Library.&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded birth of an African American was that of William Leper, recorded in Omaha in 1872.&lt;ref&gt;(1895) "Negroes in Omaha," ''Omaha Progress'' February 21, 1895.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1891 a mob [[lynched]] [[Joe Coe|George Smith]], an [[African American]] man, for allegedly [[raping]] a "white" woman. No one was charged in his murder.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D. (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

==20th century==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Omaha Riot Will Brown.jpg|thumb|200px|1919 [[lynching]] victim [[Omaha Race Riot of 1919|Will Brown]].]] --&gt;
In the early 20th century, social tensions of the rapidly industrializing city absorbing waves of new immigrants and migrants broke out in riots between ethnic minorities.  The riots included extensive property damage and some deaths.

=== South Omaha ===
{{main|South Omaha}}

South Omaha was where many different immigrant groups established their own neighborhoods.  These ranged from Sheelytown for ethnic [[Irish American|Irish]] to Polish and Czech. [[Little Italy, Omaha|Little Italy]] and [[Little Bohemia (Omaha, Nebraska)|Little Bohemia]] closely bordered South Omaha at its north boundary as well.  The immigrants comprised most of the workers at the stockyards and meatpacking plants, also located there.  They started organizing different laborers and stopped work with strikes. The industry responded by hiring workers from other parts of the country who were also seeking work: both European immigrants and black migrants from the South (whose numbers doubled in Omaha from 1910 to 1920).  In 1905, more than 800 students (mostly children of immigrant workers) in South Omaha protested the presence of [[Japanese people|Japanese]] students at their school, calling them "scabs". The Japanese students were children of [[strikebreaker]]s brought in by the [[Omaha Stockyards]] the previous summer during a fierce strike. Children of the regular workers refused to attend classes and locked teachers out of the building.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1905/04/18/101412042.pdf "Revolt over Japanese; South Omaha School Children Want Them Expelled"], ''The New York Times.'' April 18, 1905. Retrieved 4/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Greek Town Riot ===
{{main|Greek Town Riot}}

[[Greeks in Omaha, Nebraska#Greek Town|Greek Town]] was a growing [[Greeks|Greek]] immigrant community in [[South Omaha]]. Other immigrants resented the Greeks, who had come to the city as [[strikebreaker]]s.  Many men of the community had been jobless for an extensive period after they were [[lay off|laid off]] following the strikes.  Some Omaha citizens assumed they were lazy rather than unemployed. In September 1909 a male resident of the Greek community was arrested by an ethnic Irish South Omaha policeman for allegedly having a relationship with a "white" woman. (He was taking English lessons from her.) The man took the officer's gun and shot him.  After the Greek was captured a short while later, a mob of ethnic whites numbering about 1,000 arrived at the door of the jail.  By then the South Omaha policemen had transferred the man to the Omaha city jail. (The jurisdictions were then separate.)  Frustrated, the mob turned to the Greek neighborhood and began to destroy it, threatening all of its residents with death if they stayed in town. Within a day the Greek residents abandoned the six-by-six block area and scattered into cities across the Midwest. Meanwhile, the mob destroyed the entire neighborhood.  The accused Greek immigrant was brought to trial; but, after intervention from the Greek ambassador to the U.S., who protested the government's failure to protect the immigrant community, the city of Omaha released the man and dropped charges against him.

=== Anti-German sentiments ===
{{main|Germans in Omaha, Nebraska}}

In the immediate years after [[World War I]] and defeat of Germany by the [[Allies of World War I|Allies]], anti-German sentiment ran high across the country. The Nebraska legislature passed a law in 1919 that enforced teaching in English in public schools. (Because of substantial immigration by Germans to Nebraska, in earlier years, studies in German were available in the public schools, along with French and classical languages.)  By law, "No person, individually or as a teacher, shall, in any private, denominational, parochial or public school, teach any subject to any person in any language than the English language."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/conlaw/Meyer%20v%20Nebraska%20(1923).html "U.S. Supreme Court: MEYER v. STATE OF NEBRASKA, 262 U.S. 390 (1923)"]. University of Kansas City. Retrieved 9/3/07.&lt;/ref&gt; Robert Meyer was found to violate this law because he taught German.  He was taken to court by the State of Nebraska, and when found guilty he appealed. Although his appeal to the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] failed, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] in ''[[Meyer v. Nebraska]]'' determined that Meyer had the right to teach the German language as a subject, and to teach it in German. During the course of the year, open [[discrimination]] against Germans throughout Omaha was taking hold. Many German-language newspapers were forced to change to English, or to close.&lt;ref&gt;Folsom, B.W. (1999) ''No More Free Markets Or Free Beer: The Progressive Era in Nebraska, 1900-1924''. Lexington Books. p 112.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Red Summer ===
{{main|Omaha Race Riot of 1919}}
{{further|Red Summer}}

In September 1919, following a summer of racial riots in several other industrial cities, an African-American laborer named [[Willy Brown]] was lynched in Omaha.  He had been accused of raping a young white woman.  A mob of 5,000 ethnic white men marched from South Omaha (some young men were classmates of the woman) and appeared at the [[Douglas County Courthouse (Omaha)|Douglas County Courthouse]] to demand "justice". Within hours the mob grew to 10,000 people. Many were drinking. When the reform mayor [[Edward P. Smith]] attempted to intervene, he was nearly lynched by the mob.  Only a last-minute rescue saved him from being hanged.  The mob threw stones at windows, far outnumbered the police, and set the courthouse on fire to force the release of Brown.  The police turned him over to save other prisoners.  In a frenzy, the mob hung Brown from a lamppost and shot him, later dragged his body and burned it. The mob turned against police vehicles and attacked any blacks they found in the street.  They began to move toward a large [[Near North Side (Omaha, Nebraska)|African-American enclave]] in North Omaha.  The city and governor had called in the U.S. Army from [[Fort Omaha]] to intervene.  It stationed troops in North Omaha to protect the blacks, and after gaining control of the mob, in South Omaha to prevent any more riots forming.  An unseasonal rainstorm cooled the mob down as well. The Army commander established [[martial law]] for several days.  A grand jury's investigation identified the mob as arising from South Omaha and being encouraged by the city's vice world. No one was charged in the events, however.

=== Anti-Black racism ===

On July 4, 1910 African American boxer [[Jack Johnson (boxer)|Jack Johnson]] won a major upset at a national match in [[Reno, Nevada]]. Upon hearing the news, a dozen fights broke out in different areas of the city between whites and blacks, as happened in other cities.  Whites wounded several black men and killed one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1910/07/05/105082296.pdf "Omaha negro killed"], ''The New York Times.'' July 5, 1910. Retrieved 4/20/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[World War I]], white veterans trying to return to their civilian jobs found African-American and Eastern European immigrants in their former positions. Their resentment led to several violent strikes in the [[South Omaha]] [[meat packing]] industry as groups tried to control access to jobs. During this period, Earl Little was a Baptist minister in North Omaha. After his son, Malcolm, was born in Omaha in 1925, the family moved away because of threats by the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in 1926. (The KKK had undergone a revival and growth in the Midwest in the early 1920s.)  Malcolm Little later changed his last name to X, when he joined the [[Nation of Islam|Black Muslims]], where he became an important leader known as [[Malcolm X]].&lt;ref&gt;Malcolm X. (1973) ''The Autobiography of Malcolm X.'' Penguin Books Ltd.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1920s, [[racial segregation]] became normalized in Omaha as [[redlining]] and [[restrictive covenants]] kept African Americans concentrated in housing in [[North Omaha]].&lt;ref&gt;''A Street of Dreams'' Nebraska Public Television.&lt;/ref&gt;  The riot had discredited the city's newly elected reformist government.  In the next election, "Cowboy" [[Jim Dahlman]] was returned to office with the support of Tom Dennison, the informal leader of the vice world.  The labor struggles and social struggles led Omaha's African-American leaders, such as Earl Little, [[Harry Haywood]] and [[George Wells Parker]], to push harder for civil rights.&lt;ref&gt;Davies, P. (2002) ''American Road: The Story of an Epic Transcontinental Journey at the Dawn of the Motor Age.'' Henry Holt and Co. P 107.&lt;/ref&gt; After this period, African Americans in Omaha were largely concentrated as residents on the city's north side, with a small community in South Omaha.

== Civil-rights-movement era ==
{{main|Civil rights movement in Omaha, Nebraska}}

In 1947 a student-led civil-rights group called the [[DePorres Club]] was forced off the [[Creighton University]] campus, where they started.  [[Mildred Brown]], a community activist and publisher, invited them to meet at the ''Omaha Star'', the paper she directed for the African-American community for decades.&lt;ref&gt;(n.d.)[http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/frameset_reset.html?http://www.nebraskastudies.org/0800/stories/0801_0400.html Mildred Brown] ''Nebraska Studies.''&lt;/ref&gt;

Omaha jazz legend [[Preston Love]] reported that in the 1950s he saw signs in Omaha restaurants and bars that said, "We Don't Serve Any Colored Race", but that he was always welcome as a musician.&lt;ref&gt;Bristow, D. (n.d.)

''Nebraska Life.''&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1950s, the United Meatpacking Workers of America (UPWA) helped use their power to have businesses in Omaha integrate their facilities.

The late 1950s and early 1960s was the period which [[Lois Mark Stalvey]] wrote about in ''The Education of a WASP''.  She recounted her [[activist]] efforts to desegregate a middle-class [[West Omaha]] neighborhood for an African-American surgeon and his family who wanted to live in the area.  Such efforts took place in a different environment from the struggles of most working-class families in North and South Omaha.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wisc.edu/wisconsinpress/books/0410.htm Lois Mark Stalvey, ''Three to Get Ready: The Education of a White Family in Inner City Schools''], University of Wisconsin Press.

In 1955, the [[State of Nebraska]] took Omaha's main amusement park, [[Peony Park]], to district court. The state believed that the park, founded in 1919, violated Nebraska Civil Rights Law when [[African American]] swimmers at the [[Amateur Athletic Union]] Swimming Meet held at the park on August 27, 1955 were discriminated against. In ''State of Nebraska v. Peony Park'', the [[Nebraska Supreme Court]] found that two African-American participants were illegally barred from the meet because Peony Park barred them from the pool. On September 7, 1955, the court fined Peony Park $50 and costs of the trial. Additional civil suits were settled out of court.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sunsite.berkeley.edu/meiklejohn/meik-1_2/meik-1_2-3.html Civil Liberties Docket]. Vol. I, No. 2. December, 1955.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Omaha Star]]'' newspaper reported extensively on the trial, using the opportunity to highlight segregationist policies around the city as well as the city's burgeoning civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;Suggs, H.L. (1996) ''The Black Press in the Middle West, 1865-1985.'' Greenwood Publishing Group. p 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1960s, economic progress by many African Americans and ethnic Americans became unraveled in the massive job losses caused by restructuring of railroad and meatpacking industries. By the mid-1960s, [[North Omaha]] had much more poverty than before and increasing social problems. On July 4, 1966, tensions broke out in a riot after a day of blistering 103 degree weather.  Refusing a police order to disperse, African Americans demolished police cars and attacked the North 24th Street business corridor, throwing firebombs and demolishing storefronts.  Businesses in the Near North Side suffered millions of dollars in damages.&lt;ref&gt;Luebtke, F.C.

''Black Facts Online''.&lt;/ref&gt; Less than a month later, on August 1, 1966, riots erupted after a 19-year-old was shot by a white off-duty policeman during a burglary. rioters firebombed three buildings and 180 [[riot police]] were required to quell the crowds.  Leaders in the community criticized the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' and local television stations for blaming African Americans for the conditions they faced in their deteriorating neighborhoods, when the problems of joblessness and decreased maintenance were beyond city and regional control.&lt;ref name="Olson, J.C 1997 p 371"&gt;Olson, J.C. and Naugle, R.C. (1997) ''History of Nebraska.'' University of Nebraska Press. p 371.&lt;/ref&gt;  That same year, 1966, ''[[A Time for Burning]]'', a documentary featuring North Omaha and the social problems, was filmed. Later it was nominated for an [[Academy Award|Oscar]] for best documentary.

In March 1968 a crowd of high school and university students gathered at the [[Omaha Civic Auditorium]] to protest the presidential campaign of [[George Wallace]], the segregationist governor of [[Alabama]].  After counter-protesters began acting violently toward the [[youth activism|activists]], [[police brutality]] led to dozens of protesters being injured. During the melee, an African-American youth was shot and killed by a police officer.  Students' fleeing the outbreak attacked businesses and cars, causing thousands of dollars of damage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://press.creighton.edu/031904/cu125.html "Peaceful protest turns violent"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080920023017/http://press.creighton.edu/031904/cu125.html |date=2008-09-20 }}, ''The Creightonian Online.'' Retrieved 4/16/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day a local barber named [[Ernie Chambers]] helped calm a disturbance and prevent a riot by students at Horace Mann Junior High School. Chambers was already recognized as a community leader.  After finishing his law degree, Chambers was elected to the [[Nebraska State Legislature]].  He went on to serve a total of 38 years, longer than any of his predecessors.&lt;ref name="Olson, J.C 1997 p 371"/&gt; [[Robert Kennedy]] visited Omaha later that year in his quest to become president, speaking in support of Omaha's civil rights activists.

An African-American teenager named Vivian Strong was shot and killed by police officers in an incident at the [[Logan Fontenelle Housing Projects]] in June 1969. Young African Americans in the area rioted after the teenager's death, and looted along the North 24th Street business corridor. Eight businesses were destroyed by firebombing or looting.&lt;ref&gt;Luebtke, F.C. (2005) ''Nebraska: An Illustrated History.

In 1970 an African-American man named Duane Peak was arrested, and quickly implicated six others in a bombing at a vacant house in North Omaha that killed a police officer. On August 31, local [[Black Panther Party]] leaders David Rice and Ed Poindexter were arrested in the case, despite not having been originally implicated. In 1971 both men were convicted of murder in the controversial [[Rice/Poindexter Case]], and in 1974 a retrial of Rice and Poindexter was denied by the Nebraska State Supreme Court.

=== Late 20th century ===

The 1970s construction of the [[North Freeway (Omaha, Nebraska)|North Freeway]] bisected North Omaha, effectively cutting the African-American community in half and creating social problems. In 1976, the [[Omaha Public Schools]] began court-ordered busing to achieve integration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''1954-1979''. Omaha World Herald (Nebraska) June 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1981 arsonists burned an [[East Omaha]] duplex after an African-American family signed a [[rental agreement]] there. The arson is unsolved.&lt;ref name="Burbach, C 2007"&gt;Burbach, C. "Robbery, fire evoke memories of neighborhood's racist past," ''Omaha World Herald.'' February 26, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993 the Nebraska Parole Board voted for the first time to unanimously commute the sentences of Rice and Poindexter to [[time served]]. The Nebraska Board of Pardons refused to schedule a hearing in the matter. This same sequence of events has occurred no fewer than three times since then, with the same outcome each time.

In 1995 an African-American gang member murdered an Omaha police officer named Jimmy Wilson, Jr. The city responded by equipping every police car with a camera and giving North Omaha officers body armor. Later that year arsonists tipped over and burned an African-American woman's car in [[East Omaha]] near the site of the 1981 arson. Both cases are unsolved.&lt;ref name="Burbach, C 2007"/&gt;

In 1996 the Omaha public schools ended court-ordered busing.&lt;ref&gt;''Omaha World Herald'', June 13, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; That same year the ''Omaha World-Herald'' reported that, "One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city 'increasingly scary.' 'I left [[Benson, Nebraska|Benson]] because I didn't like the changes,' he said. 'Too much crime, too much racial tension, too much school busing. I went to the suburbs to get away from that, and now I'm being forced back in.' The man, an insurance company employee, denied that his problems were based on race, but he asked that this part of the interview be anonymous."&lt;ref&gt;Freed, K. "The Lure of the Suburbs: Do City Problems Grow With Growth?" ''Omaha World Herald.'' August 7, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, an African-American [[Gulf War]] veteran named Marvin Ammons was shot and killed by an Omaha police officer. A [[grand jury]] indicted the officer for [[manslaughter]]; the indictment was quashed due to a finding of [[jury misconduct]]. A second grand jury cleared the officer of wrongdoing and admonished the [[Omaha Police Department|Omaha police department]] for mishandling the case.

In 2000, George Bibbins, an African American, led Omaha police on a high-speed car chase. At the end of the chase, he was shot and killed by officers. A grand jury later cleared the officers involved of any wrongdoing.

That year the [[Nebraska State Legislature]] enacted [[term limit]]s. Some believed this action was directed against the long-time State Senator Ernie Chambers, an African American who had then served 27 years.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press (Apr 25, 2005). For the Record. ''Lincoln Journal Star.'' Retrieved on 24 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Chambers became the longest-serving State Senator in Nebraska history, with more than 32 years of service. Because of the 2002 law, he was not allowed to run for office again once his term expired in 2008.

[[Desegregation busing]] and [[racial integration]] in public schools were contentious issues in Omaha.  Problems with public schools were a factor in middle-class people moving to the suburbs, but the shift in population to suburbs also followed the growth of the city and highways.  Omahans' preference for larger, newer housing was just like that of other Americans.  Middle-class African Americans have also moved to the suburbs here and in other cities.&lt;ref&gt;''"One resident of Rose Garden Estates near 172nd and Pacific Streets said privately, for instance, that he finds the prospect of being incorporated into the city "increasingly scary." "I left Benson because I didn't like the changes," he said. "Too much crime, too much racial tension, too much school busing. I went to the suburbs to get away from that, and now I'm being forced back in." The man, an insurance company employee, denied that his problems were based on race, but he asked that this part of the interview be anonymous'' (Freed, Kenneth. "The Lure of the Suburbs Do City Problems Grow With Growth?" ''Omaha World Herald (August 7, 1996)).'' This article noted other similar instances.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Schooling ===

From 1976 to 1999, Omaha had a [[integrated busing|busing]] plan as an effort to integrate the schools.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Busing was an early goal of civil rights leaders and groups in Omaha, including 4CL, who lauded integrated busing as a particularly important step in improving race relations.&lt;ref&gt;''A Street of Dreams.''&lt;/ref&gt;  When the city considered ending busing in the 1990s, Concerned and Caring Educators, a 100-member group of black education administrators and supervisors, praised the system as having improved race relations and the education of Omaha's students.&lt;ref&gt;Ngyren, J. "Black Group: Ending Busing A Step Back", ''Omaha World Herald'', March 14, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Omaha Public Schools]] ended busing to achieve integration in 1999.  It responded to parental desires for neighborhood schools and for choice.  It has created magnet schools to attract students from middle-class families.  As in many other cities, concerns about schools are high.  Like some other districts such as [[Louisville, Kentucky]], Omaha has begun to explore socioeconomic integration - assigning students according to family income - to change the makeup of their schools and address low test scores among poor children in the inner city. There have been delays in efforts to unite the Omaha public school district with newly annexed smaller, local districts in the western half of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Robb, J. "[http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1640&amp;u_sid=2056237 Dream of integrated schools fading,] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070927223938/http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_pg=1640&amp;u_sid=2056237 |date=2007-09-27 }} ''Omaha World-Herald.''

==21st century==
Senator Ernie Chambers proposed a controversial school separation plan for Omaha in the Nebraska State Legislature in response to concerns by suburban districts outside Omaha boundaries. The state legislature was interested in seeking a way to use suburban districts to help integrate the city's schools.  "The law, intended to resolve a boundary dispute between the Omaha schools and largely white suburban districts, created a learning community of area school districts that would operate with a common tax levy and required them to draw up an integration plan for metropolitan Omaha."&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dillon |first=Sam |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] | title=Law to Segregate Omaha Schools Divides Nebraska |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/15/us/15omaha.html?ex=1302753600&amp;en=613ee46cacb5fefa&amp;ei=5088&amp;partner=rssnyt&amp;emc=rss |date=April 15, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chambers lobbied to create three districts in the city, with each drawn along geographic boundaries that loosely correlated to the racial segregation of the city: African Americans in [[North Omaha]], Hispanic/Latinos in [[South Omaha]], and Caucasians in West Omaha.  Chambers defended his decision from the standpoint that much of the city had [[residential segregation]] and that his plan would provide African American parents in North Omaha with more control over their district.&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, Michaela. ''Chambers up close A Q&amp;A with the senator, whose OPS views are rooted in his youth''. Omaha World Herald (April 30, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; The State Legislature signed [[Omaha Public Schools#Split the District|this plan]] into law in April, 2006, with the plan going into effect in 2008.

Within a month of the legislature's passing the law, the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People]] brought a [[lawsuit]], arguing that due to Omaha's racially segregated residential patterns, subdivided school districts will also be racially segregated, contrary to [[United States]] [[Brown v. Board of Education|law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Sam Dillon | title=Schools Plan in Nebraska Is Challenged | publisher=New York Times | date=May 17, 2006 | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/17/us/17naacp.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has also drawn national attention.  Critics regard the plan as "state-sponsored segregation".&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;

In February 2007, unknown assailants robbed, [[Small incendiary device|firebomb]]ed, and [[spray paint]]ed a [[List of ethnic slurs|racist epithet]] on the side of an East Omaha grocery store owned by an [[Ethiopia]]n [[immigrant]]. That crime is unsolved.&lt;ref&gt;Burbach, C. (2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2007, the ''[[Omaha World-Herald]]'' noted recent census statistics showed that Omaha, the 43rd largest city in the United States, has the fifth highest poverty rate for African Americans among the 100 largest cities. More than one in three live below the poverty line.  The city has plans for public-private development in North Omaha that are intended to revive the area.  Investment in infrastructure, parks and street design has already begun.&lt;ref&gt;Kotock, C.D. (2007) [http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=10148991 "Big plans in store for north Omaha"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120912023017/http://www.omaha.com/index.php?u_page=2798&amp;u_sid=10148991 |date=2012-09-12 }}, ''Omaha World-Herald'', October 3, 2007. Retrieved 10/4/07.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some groups have tried to manufacture political power out of immigration issues, but more people in the city and community have rallied in support of the Hispanic community, who comprise the most numerous recent immigrants.  In 2007 a [[neo-Nazi]] group tried to organize a protest and had 65 participants outside the city's [[Mexicans in Omaha, Nebraska|Mexican]] consulate.  They were far outnumbered by the thousands in counter-protests, as well as those celebrating at events marking the diversity of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ruggles, R. and Cole, K.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2653">'''Radical interpretation''' is interpretation of a speaker, including attributing beliefs and desires to them and meanings to their words, from scratch—that is, without relying on translators, dictionaries, or specific prior knowledge of their mental states.  The term was introduced by American philosopher [[Donald Davidson (philosopher)|Donald Davidson]] (1973) and is meant to suggest important similarity to [[W. V. O. Quine]]'s term [[radical translation]], which occurs in his work on the [[indeterminacy of translation]]. Radical translation
is translation of a speaker's language, without prior knowledge, by observing the speaker's use of the language in context.&lt;ref name="RI"&gt;Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation. Originally published in Dialectica, 27 (1973), 314-28. Reprinted in Inquiries into Truth and Interpretation (2n. ed. 125-39). New York: Clarendon Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Even more so than radical translation did for Quine, radical interpretation plays an important role in Davidson's work, but the exact nature of this role is up for debate.  Some see Davidson as using radical interpretation directly in his arguments against conceptual relativism and the possibility of massive error--of most of our beliefs being false.&lt;ref name="LL"&gt;Lepore, Ernest and Kirk Ludwig. ''Donald Davidson: Meaning, Truth, Language and Reality''. Oxford. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  But Davidson seems to explicitly reject this reading in "Radical Interpretation Interpreted".&lt;ref name="RII"&gt;Davidson, Donald. Radical Interpretation Interpreted. Philosophical Perspectives, 8 (1994), 121-128.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a more narrow and technical version of radical interpretation used by Davidson:&lt;ref name="RII"/&gt; given the speaker's attitudes of holding particular sentences true in particular circumstances, the speaker's hold-true attitudes, the radical interpreter is to infer a theory of meaning, a truth theory meeting a modified version of [[Alfred Tarski]]'s [[Convention T]], for the speaker's [[idiolect]].  [[Ernest Lepore]] and [[Kirk Ludwig]] characterize this as inference from sentences of the form:

:Ceteris paribus, S holds true s at t if and only if p.
to corresponding [[T-sentences]] of the form

:s is true (S, t) if and only if q
where s is a sentence in the idiolect of the speaker S, t is a time, and p and q are filled in with sentences in the [[metalanguage]].&lt;ref name="LL"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18674">'''Reality in Buddhism''' is called ''[[dharma]]'' ([[Sanskrit]]) or ''[[dhamma]]'' ([[Pali]]). This word, which is foundational to the conceptual frameworks of the Indian religions, refers in Buddhism to the system of natural laws which constitute the natural order of things. ''Dharma'' is therefore reality as-it-is (''yatha-bhuta''). The teaching of [[Gautama Buddha]] constituting as it does a method by which people can come out of their condition of suffering (''[[dukkha]]'') involves developing an awareness of reality (''see'' [[mindfulness]]). Buddhism thus seeks to address any disparity between a person's view of reality and the actual state of things. This is called developing Right or Correct View (Pali: ''[[Noble Eightfold Path|samma ditthi]]''). Seeing reality as-it-is {{Not a typo|is}} thus an essential prerequisite to mental health and well-being according to Buddha's teaching.

Buddhism addresses deeply philosophical questions regarding the nature of reality. One of the fundamental teachings is that all the constituent forms (''[[sankhara]]s'') that make up the universe are transient (Pali: ''[[anicca]]''), arising and passing away, and therefore without concrete identity or ownership (''[[Atta (Buddhism)|atta]]''). This lack of enduring ownership or identity (''[[anatta]]'') of phenomena has important consequences for the possibility of liberation from the conditions which give rise to suffering. This is explained in the doctrine of inter[[dependent origination]].

One of the most discussed themes in Buddhism is that of the emptiness (''[[sunyata]]'') of form ([[Pali]]: ''[[rūpa]]''), an important corollary of the transient and conditioned nature of phenomena. Reality is seen, ultimately, in Buddhism as a form of '[[Philosophy of perception|projection]]', resulting from the fruition (''[[vipaka]]'') of karmic seeds (''sankharas''). The precise nature of this 'illusion' that is the phenomenal universe is debated among different schools. For example;

* Some consider that the concept of the unreality of "reality" is confusing. They posit that, in Buddhism, the perceived reality is considered illusory not in the sense that reality is a fantasy or unreal, but that our perceptions and preconditions mislead us to believe that we are separate from the elements that we are made of. Reality, in Buddhist thought, would be described as the manifestation of [[Karma in Buddhism|karma]].
* Other schools of thought in Buddhism (e.g., [[Dzogchen]]), consider ''perceived reality'' literally unreal. As a prominent contemporary teacher puts it: "In a real sense, all the visions that we see in our lifetime are like a big dream [...]".&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"&gt;[[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga And The Practice Of Natural Light'' Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 42, 46, 48, 96, 105.&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, the term 'visions' denotes not only visual perceptions, but appearances perceived through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations, and operations on received mental objects.

__TOC__

==Reality in Buddhist sutras==
[[Buddhist]] [[Sūtra|sutras]] devote considerable space to the concept of reality, with each of two major doctrines&amp;mdash;the Doctrine of Dependent Origination (''[[pratitya-samutpada]]'') and the Doctrine of Cause and Effect (''[[karma]]'' and ''[[vipaka]]'')&amp;mdash;attempting to incorporate both the natural and the spiritual into its overall world view. Buddhist teachings continue to explore the nature of the world and our place in it.

The Buddha promoted experience over theorizing. According to Karel Werner, &lt;blockquote&gt;Experience is ... the path most elaborated in early Buddhism. The doctrine on the other hand was kept low. The Buddha avoided doctrinal formulations concerning the final reality as much as possible in order to prevent his followers from resting content with minor achievements on the path in which the absence of the final experience could be substituted by conceptual understanding of the doctrine or by religious faith, a situation which sometimes occurs, in both varieties, in the context of Hindu systems of doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Karel Werner, ''Mysticism and Indian Spirituality.'' In Karel Werner, ed., ''The Yogi and the Mystic.'' Curzon Press, 1989, page 27.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Mahayana developed those statements he did make into an extensive, diverse set of sometimes contrasting descriptions of reality "as it really is."&lt;ref&gt;See Henshall, Ron (2007), ''The Unborn and Emancipation from the Born''[http://www.theunborn.org.uk/Microsoft_Word_-_Ron_Henshall__Dissertation__2007.pdf], a master's thesis by a student of Peter Harvey.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in [[Tibetan Buddhism]] the [[Gelugpa]] draw a distinction between [[Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika distinction|Svatantrika-Prasaṅgika]] in [[Madhyamika]] philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt; This distinction was most prominently promulgated by [[Je Tsongkhapa]] (1357–1419 CE), when he argued that this distinction can be found explicitly and implicitly within in the works of [[Nagarjuna]], [[Chandrakirti]], and [[Buddhapalita]].&lt;ref&gt;Lama Tsongkhapa, Lamrim Chenmo V3 Pp 224-267&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Theravada]] school teaches that there is no universal personal god. The world as we know it does not have its origin in a primordial being such as [[Brahman]] or the [[Abrahamic]] [[God]]. What we see is only a product of transitory factors of existence, which depend functionally upon each other. The Buddha is said to have said: "The world exists because of causal actions, all things are produced by causal actions and all beings are governed and bound by causal actions. They are fixed like the rolling wheel of a cart, fixed by the pin of its axle shaft." (Sutta-Nipata 654)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accesstoinsight.org/canon/sutta/khuddaka/suttanipata/index.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word 'illusion' is frequently associated with [[Buddhism]] and the nature of reality. Some interpretations of Buddhism teach that reality is a coin with two sides: the not-permanent characteristic or ''[[anicca]]'' and the "not-self characteristic" or ''[[anatta]]'', referred to as "emptiness" in some [[Mahayana]] schools.  Dzogchen, as the [[non-dual]] culmination of the [[Nyingmapa|Ancient School]] (a school with a few million followers out of a few hundred million Buddhists) of [[Mantrayana]], resolves [[Ātman (Buddhism)|atman]] and [[anatman]] into the [[Mindstream]] Doctrine of [[Tapihritsa]]. The Buddha Shakyamuni is said to have taught the variously understood and interpreted concept of "not-self" in the [[Anatta-lakkhana Sutta]]. In this sutta, he lists the characteristics that we often associate with who we are, and found that these characteristics, ultimately, are not who we are because they are subject to change without control. He further illustrates the changing nature of our feelings, perceptions, and consciousness.

We can look at the concepts of not-permanent and not-self in objective terms, for example by [[Deconstruction|deconstructing]] the concept of an [[skandha|aggregated]] object such as a [[Padma (attribute)|lotus]] and seeing that the flower is made up entirely of non-flower elements like soil, nutrients, photosynthetic energy, rain water and the effort of the entities that nourished and grew the flower. All of these factors, according to the [[Diamond Sutra]],  co-exist with each other to manifest what we call a 'flower'. In other words, there is no essence arisen from nothingness that is unique and personal to any being. In particular, there is neither a human [[soul]] that lives on beyond the death of the physical body nor one that is extinguished at death since, strictly speaking, there is nothing to extinguish. The relative reality (i.e., the illusory perceived reality) comes from our belief that we are separate from the rest of the things in the universe and, at times, at odds with the processes of nature and other beings. The ultimate or absolute reality, in some schools of Buddhist thought, shows that we are inter-connected with all things. The concept of non-discrimination expands on this by saying that, while a chair is different from a flower, they 'inter-are' because they are each made of non-flower and non-chair elements. Ultimately those elements are the same, so the distinction between chair and flower is one of quantity not of quality.

The [[Diamond Sutra]], a [[Mahayana]] scripture, has many passages that use the formula: A is not A, therefore A is called A.

==Reality and dreams in Dzogchen==
In [[Dzogchen]], perceived reality is considered to be relatively unreal.

{{Quotation|align=center|The real sky is (knowing) that [[saṃsāra|samsara]] and [[nirvana]] are merely an illusory display.&lt;ref&gt;In: [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] ''Dream Yoga and the Practice of Natural Light''. Edited and introduced by Michael Katz, Snow Lion Publications, Ithaca, NY, {{ISBN|1-55939-007-7}}, pp. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Jamgon Ju Mipham Gyatso|Mipham Rinpoche]]|Quintessential Instructions of Mind, p. 117}}

According to contemporary teacher [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]] [[Rinpoche]], all appearances perceived during the whole life of an individual, through all senses, including sounds, smells, tastes and tactile sensations in their totality, are like a big [[dream]]. It is claimed that, on careful examination, the dream of life and regular nightly dreams are not very different, and that in their essential nature there is no difference between them.

The non-essential difference between the dreaming state and ordinary waking experience is that the latter is more concrete and linked to attachment; the dreaming experience while sleeping is slightly detached.

Also according to this teaching, there is a correspondence between the states of sleep and dream and our experiences when we die. After experiencing the intermediate state of [[bardo]], an individual comes out of it, a new karmic illusion is created and another existence begins. This is how [[Transmigration of the soul|transmigration]] happens.

According to [[Dzogchen]] teachings, the energy of an individual is essentially without form and free from [[Dualism (Indian philosophy)|duality]]. However, [[karmic traces]] contained in the individual's [[mindstream]] give rise to two kinds of forms:

* forms that the individual experiences as his or her body, voice and mind
* forms that the individual experiences as an external environment.

What appears as a world of permanent external phenomena, is the energy of the individual him or herself. There is nothing completely external or separate from the individual. Everything that manifests in the individual's field of experience is a [[Continuum (theory)|continuum]]. This is the '[[Great Perfection]]' that is discovered in [[Dzogchen]] practice.&lt;ref&gt;The Crystal and The Way of Light. Sutra, Tantra and Dzogchen by [[Chögyal Namkhai Norbu]]. Compiled and Edited by [[John Shane]], [[Snow Lion Publications]], Ithaca, NY, USA, 2000, {{ISBN|1-55939-135-9}}, pp. 99, 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible to do yogic practice such as [[Dream Yoga]] and [[Yoga Nidra]] whilst dreaming, sleeping and in other [[bardo]] states of [[trance]]. In this way the yogi can have a very strong experience and with this comes understanding of the dream-like nature of daily life. This is also very relevant to diminishing attachments, because they are based on strong beliefs that life's perceptions such as objects are real and as a consequence: important. If one really understands what Buddha Shakyamuni meant when he said that everything is (relatively) unreal, then one can diminish attachments and tensions.

The teacher advises that the realization that life is only a big dream can help us finally liberate ourselves from the chains of various emotions, different kinds of attachment and the chains of ego. Then we have the possibility of ultimately becoming enlightened.&lt;ref name="ChNN_dream_yoga_book"/&gt;

== Reality in the Tathagatagarbha Sutras ==

Prior to the period of the Tathagatagarbha Sutras, Mahayana [[metaphysics]] had been dominated by teachings on [[emptiness]] in the form of [[Madhyamaka]] philosophy. The language used by this approach is primarily negative, and the Tathagatagarbha genre of sutras can be seen as an attempt to state orthodox Buddhist teachings of [[dependent origination]] using positive language instead, to prevent people from being turned away from Buddhism by a false impression of nihilism. In these sutras the perfection of the wisdom of not-self is stated to be the true self; the ultimate goal of the path is then characterized using a range of positive language that had been used in Indian philosophy previously by essentialist philosophers, but which was now transmuted into a new Buddhist vocabulary to describe a being who has successfully completed the Buddhist path.&lt;ref&gt;Sallie B. King (1997),[https://web.archive.org/web/20070927131119/http://www.nanzan-u.ac.jp/SHUBUNKEN/publications/nlarc/pdf/Pruning%20the%20bodhi%20tree/Pruning%209.pdf  ''The Doctrine of Buddha Nature is Impeccably Buddhist'']. In: Jamie Hubbard (ed.), Pruning the Bodhi Tree: The Storm Over Critical Buddhism, Univ of Hawaii Press 1997, pp. 174-192. {{ISBN|0824819497}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrasting with some forms of Buddhism, the Buddha's teaching on 'reality' in the [[Tathagatagarbha]] Mahayana scriptures - which the Buddha states constitute the ultimate manifestation of the [[Mahayana]] Dharma (other Mahayana sutras make similar claims about their own teachings) - insists that there truly ''is'' a sphere or realm of ultimate truth - not just a repetitious cycle of interconnected elements, each dependent on the others. That suffering-filled cycle of x-generating-y-and-y-generating-z-and-z-generating-a, etc., is ''Samsara'', the prison-house of the reincarnating non-self; whereas liberation from dependency, enforced rebirth and bondage is [[nirvana]] or reality / spiritual essence (''tattva'' / ''dharmata''). This sphere also bears the name ''Tathagatagarbha'' (Buddha matrix). It is the deathless realm where dependent origination holds no sway, where non-self is supplanted by the everlasting, sovereign (''[[aishvarya]]'') self ([[Atman (Buddhism)|atman]]) (as a trans-historical, unconditioned, ultimate, liberating, supra-worldly yet boundless and immanent awakened mind). Of this real truth, called nirvana - which, while salvationally infused into samsara, is not bound or imprisoned in it - the Buddha states in the [[Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra]]:&lt;ref&gt;Yamamoto, Kosho (tr.), Page, Tony (ed.) (1999&amp;ndash;2000).[https://web.archive.org/web/20131019072030/http://webzoom.freewebs.com/nirvana-sutra/convenient/Mahaparinirvana_Sutra_Yamamoto_Page_2007.pdf ''The Mahayana Mahaparinirvana Sutra''] in 12 volumes. London: Nirvana Publications{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"What is the Real (''tattva'')? Knowledge of the true attributes of Nirvana; the Tathagata, the Dharma, the Sangha, and the attributes of space ... is the Real. What is knowledge of the attributes of Nirvana? The attributes of Nirvana are eightfold. What are these eight? Cessation [of ignorance and suffering]; loveliness/ wholesomeness; Truth; Reality; Eternity, Bliss, the Self [''atman''], and complete Purity: that is Nirvana."

He further comments: " ... that which is endowed with the Eternal, Bliss, the Self, and Purity is stated to be the meaning of 'Real Truth' ... Moreover, the Real is the Tathagata [i.e., the Buddha]; the Tathagata is the Real ... The Tathagata is not conditioned and not tainted, but utterly blissful: this is the Real ...".

Thus, in such doctrines, a very positive goal is envisioned, which is said to lie beyond the grasp of the five senses and the ordinary, restless mind, and only attainable through direct meditative perception and when all inner pollutants (twisted modes of view, and all moral contaminants) are purged, and the inherently deathless, spotless, radiantly shining mind of Buddha stands revealed. This is the realm of the ''Buddha-dhatu'' (popularly known as [[buddha nature]]) - inconceivable, beginning-less, endless, omniscient truth, the [[Dharmakaya]] (quintessential body-and-mind) of the Buddha. This reality is empty of all falsehood, impermanence, ignorance, afflictions, and pain, but filled with enduring happiness, purity, knowingness (''jnana''), and omni-radiant loving-kindness (''maitri'').

'''Retread''', also known as "recap", or a "remold" is a [[re-manufacturing]] process for [[tires]] that replace the [[tread]] on worn tires. Retreading is applied to casings of spent tires that have been inspected and repaired.&lt;ref name=Flapper&gt;{{cite book|last=(eds.)|first=Simme Douwe P. Flapper, Jo A.E.E. van Nunen, Luk N. van Wassenhove,|title=Managing closed-loop supply chains|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=3540272518|pages=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XspQ0PUNjvkC&amp;pg=PA119}}&lt;/ref&gt; It preserves about 90% of the material in spent tires and the material cost is about 20% compared to manufacturing a new one.

==Applications==
===United States===
Some applications for retreaded tires are airplanes, racing cars, buses and delivery trucks. Use of retreaded tires was common historically, but as of 2008, it was seldom used for passenger vehicles, mainly due to discomfort on the road, safety issues and cheaper tire brands surfacing on the market. About 17.6 million retreaded tires were sold in North America in 2006.&lt;ref name=Bodziak&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodziak|first=William|title=Tire Tread and Tire Track Evidence: Recovery and Forensic Examination Practical Aspects of Criminal &amp; Forensic Investigations|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1420006827|pages=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRsHlttaMrMC&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
There are two main processes used for retreading tires, called Mold Cure and Pre Cure. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as [[shearography]] to locate non-visible damage and embedded [[road debris|debris]] and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body. Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.&lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

Material cost for a retreaded tire is about 20% that of making a new tire.&lt;ref name="Flapper"/&gt;
About 90% of the original tires by weight is retained in retreaded tires. A 1997 study estimates that then current generation of commercial vehicles tires to last up to 600,000 miles if they're retreaded two to three times. &lt;ref name=Madu&gt;{{cite book|last=Madu|first=ed. by Christian N.|title=Handbook of environmentally conscious manufacturing|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0792384490|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-R5VOiv1YwC&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre cure===
Previously prepared tread strip is applied to [[tire casing]] with [[cement]]. This method allows more flexibility in tire sizes and it is the most commonly used method, but results in a seam where the ends of the strip meet.&lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

===Mold cure===
Raw rubber is applied to the tire casing and it is then placed in a mold where tread is formed. A dedicated mold is required for each tire size and tread design. 

====Bead to Bead molding====
In this subtype, retreading is also applied to the side walls. These tires are given entirely new branding and stamps. &lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

==Regulations==
Some jurisdictions have regulations concerning tire retreading.

===Europe===
In Europe all retreads, by law, must be manufactured according to EC Regulation 108 (car tires) or 109 (commercial vehicle tires). As part of this regulation all tires must be tested according to the same load and speed criteria as those undergone by new tires.

The [[Land Fill Directive]] of 1999 banned tires in landfills in 2003, and banned shredded tires in 2006.&lt;ref name="Flapper"/&gt;

===United States===
The [[Department of Transportation]] requires marking of a "DOTR number" which shows the name of the retreader and when it was retreaded. &lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

==Safety==
The United States [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] recognizes the public perception that retread tires frequently used by heavy vehicles are less safe than new tires as evidenced by [[tire debris]] frequently found on highways.  The NHTSA is continuing research to determine the proportion of tire debris from retreads in comparison to new tires. Additionally, the NHTSA is researching the cause of tire failure and the crash safety problem posed by tire failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/Research/Crash+Avoidance/Heavy+Vehicle+Research+-+Tires |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124610/http://www.nhtsa.gov/Research/Crash+Avoidance/Heavy+Vehicle+Research+-+Tires |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Executive Order 13149 supports the use of retread tires for economic and environmental efficiency by requiring federal vehicles to use retread tires after original factory equipped tires become non serviceable, but only when "such products are reasonably available and meet applicable performance standards".

==Environmental Impact==
Retread tires in service lower the volume of raw materials required for the manufacturing of a new tire. This includes a pronounced reduction in the use of oil. In fact, the US EPA estimated a greater than 70% savings in oil used for a retread as compared to a new tire. This also means significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing the amount of raw materials extracted, retread tires also minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. The latest figures by the US EPA indicate that over 11.2 M waste tires were dumped into the U.S. municipal solid waste stream. To understand this figure, it is equivalent to lining up passenger tires tread to tread from roughly Los Angeles to San Diego or Philadelphia to Washington DC. Because a retread tire prevents the need for manufacturing a new tire, significant environmental benefits are achieved. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bandag.com/en-us/research-center/financial-environmental-benefits&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Richard Owen''' {{post-nominals|country=GBR|KCB|FRMS|FRS}} (20 July 1804 – 18 December 1892) was an English [[biologist]], [[comparative anatomy|comparative anatomist]] and [[paleontology|paleontologist]]. Despite being a controversial figure, Owen is generally considered to have been an outstanding naturalist with a remarkable gift for interpreting [[fossil]]s.

Owen produced a vast array of scientific work, but is probably best remembered today for coining the word ''[[Dinosauria]]'' (meaning "Terrible [[Reptile]]" or "Fearfully Great [[Reptile]]").&lt;ref name="Owen 1841" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2015"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Richard Owen: The man who invented the dinosaur|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-lancashire-31623397|publisher=BBC|date=18 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; An outspoken critic of [[Charles Darwin]]'s theory of [[evolution]] by [[natural selection]], Owen agreed with Darwin that evolution occurred, but thought it was more complex than outlined in Darwin's ''[[On the Origin of Species]]''.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cosans|first1=Christopher E.|title=Owen's Ape &amp; Darwin's Bulldog: Beyond Darwinism and Creationism|date=2009|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington|isbn=978-0-253-22051-6|pages=1–192}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen's approach to evolution can be seen as having anticipated the issues that have gained greater attention with the recent emergence of [[evolutionary developmental biology]].&lt;ref name="Amundson2007"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Amundson|first1=Ron| authorlink = Ron Amundson|title=The Changing Role of the Embryo in Evolutionary Thought: Roots of Evo-Devo.|date=2007|publisher=Cambridge University of Press|location=New York|isbn=0521806992|pages=1–296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was the first president of the [[Microscopical Society of London]] in 1839 and edited many issues of its journal – then known as ''[[The Microscopic Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/store/10.1111/(ISSN)1365-2818/asset/homepages/Introduction.pdf?v=1&amp;s=923176206c03ac89a50d1594fc459670d791a88d | title=175th Anniversary Special Issue: Introduction | author=Wilson, Tony | journal=Journal of Microscopy | year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen also campaigned for the natural specimens in the [[British Museum]] to be given a new home. This resulted in the establishment, in 1881, of the now world-famous [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[South Kensington]], London.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rupke|first1=Nicolaas A.| authorlink = Nicolaas Adrianus Rupke|title=Richard Owen: Victorian Naturalist|date=1994|publisher=Yale University Press|location=New Haven|isbn=978-0300058208|pages=1–484}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bill Bryson]] argues that, "by making the Natural History Museum an institution for everyone, Owen transformed our expectations of what museums are for".&lt;ref name="Bryson2003"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bryson|first1=Bill|title=A Short History of Nearly Everything|date=2003|publisher=Doubleday|location=London|isbn=0-7679-0817-1|pages=1–672}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions to science and public learning notwithstanding, Owen's driving ambition, occasionally vicious temperament, and determination to succeed meant that he was not always popular with his fellow scientists. Owen was feared and even hated by some contemporaries such as [[Thomas Henry Huxley]]. His later career was tainted by controversies, many of which involved accusations that he took credit for other people's work.

==Biography==
Owen was born in [[Lancaster, Lancashire|Lancaster]] in 1804, one of six children of a West Indian Merchant named Richard Owen (1754–1809).  His mother, Catherine Longworth (nee Parrin), was descended from [[Huguenot]]s and he was educated at [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]]. In 1820, he was apprenticed to a local [[surgery|surgeon]] and [[apothecary]] and, in 1824, he proceeded as a medical student to the [[University of Edinburgh]]. He left the university in the following year and completed his medical course in [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]], London, where he came under the influence of the eminent surgeon [[John Abernethy (surgeon)|John Abernethy]].
[[File:Richard Owen.JPG|left|thumb|upright|The young Richard Owen]]
In July 1835 Owen married Caroline Amelia Clift in [[St Pancras, London|St Pancras]] by whom he had one son, William Owen.  He outlived both wife and son. After his death, in 1892, he was survived by his three grandchildren and daughter-in-law Emily Owen, to whom he left much of his £33,000 fortune.

Upon completing his education, he contemplated the usual professional career, but his bent was evidently in the direction of anatomical research. He was induced by Abernethy to accept the position of assistant to [[William Clift]], conservator of the museum of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England|Royal College of Surgeons]]. This congenial occupation soon led him to abandon his intention of medical practice and his life thenceforth was devoted to purely scientific labours. He prepared an important series of catalogues of the [[John Hunter (surgeon)|Hunterian Collection]], in the Royal College of Surgeons and, in the course of this work, he acquired the unrivalled knowledge of comparative anatomy that enabled him to enrich all departments of the science and especially facilitated his researches on the remains of [[extinct animal]]s.
[[File:Natural History Museum London Jan 2006.jpg|thumb|Owen was the driving force behind the establishment, in 1881, of the [[British Museum (Natural History)]] in London.]]
In 1836, Owen was appointed Hunterian professor, in the Royal College of Surgeons and, in 1849, he succeeded Clift as conservator. He held the latter office until 1856, when he became superintendent of the natural history department of the [[British Museum]]. He then devoted much of his energies to a great scheme for a National Museum of Natural History, which eventually resulted in the removal of the natural history collections of the British Museum to a new building at [[South Kensington]]: the British Museum (Natural History) (now the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]]). He retained office until the completion of this work, in December, 1883, when he was made a knight of the [[Order of the Bath]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Eminent persons: Biographies reprinted from the Times, Vol V, 1891–1892 - Sir Richard Owen (Obituary)|publisher=Macmillan &amp; Co.|pages=291–299|year=1896|url=https://books.google.com/?id=bKEMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA291 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He lived quietly in retirement at Sheen Lodge, [[Richmond Park]], until his death in 1892.

His career was tainted by accusations that he failed to give credit to the work of others and even tried to appropriate it in his own name. This came to a head in 1846, when he was awarded the [[Royal Medal]] for a paper he had written on [[belemnite]]s.  Owen had failed to acknowledge that the belemnite had been discovered by Chaning Pearce, an amateur biologist, four years earlier. As a result of the ensuing scandal, he was voted off the councils of the [[Zoological Society of London|Zoological Society]] and the [[Royal Society]].

Owen always tended to support orthodox men of science and the status quo. The royal family presented him with the cottage in Richmond Park and [[Robert Peel]] put him on the [[Civil List]]. In 1843, he was elected a foreign member of the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]].

He died at home on 15 December 1892 and is buried in the churchyard at [[Ham, London|Ham]] near [[Richmond, Surrey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work on invertebrates==
While occupied with the cataloguing of the Hunterian collection, Owen did not confine his attention to the preparations before him but also seized every opportunity to dissect fresh subjects. He was allowed to examine all animals that died in [[Zoological Society of London|London Zoo]]'s gardens and, when the Zoo began to publish scientific proceedings, in 1831, he was the most prolific contributor of anatomical papers. His first notable publication, however, was his ''Memoir on the Pearly [[Nautilus]]'' (London, 1832), which was soon recognized as a classic. Henceforth, he continued to make important contributions to every department of comparative anatomy and [[zoology]] for a period of over fifty years. In the sponges, Owen was the first to describe the now well-known [[Venus' Flower Basket]] or ''[[Euplectella]]'' (1841, 1857). Among Entozoa, his most noteworthy discovery was that of ''Trichina spiralis'' (1835), the parasite infesting the muscles of man in the disease now termed [[trichinosis]] (see also, however, [[James Paget|Sir James Paget]]). Of [[Brachiopod]]a he made very special studies, which much advanced knowledge and settled the classification that has long been accepted. Among [[Mollusc]]a, he described not only the pearly nautilus but also ''[[Spirula]]'' (1850) and other [[Cephalopod]]a, both living and extinct, and it was he who proposed the universally-accepted subdivision of this class into the two orders of Dibranchiata and Tetrabranchiata (1832). In 1852 Owen named ''[[Protichnites]]'' – the oldest footprints found on land.&lt;ref name="Owen1852"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Richard|title=Description of the impressions and footprints of the Protichnites from the Potsdam sandstone of Canada|journal=Geological Society of London Quarterly Journal|date=1852|volume=8|pages=214–225}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Applying his knowledge of anatomy, he correctly postulated that these [[Cambrian]] trackways were made by an extinct type of [[arthropod]],&lt;ref name="Owen1852"/&gt; and he did this more than 150 years before any fossils of the animal were found.&lt;ref name="ColletteHagadorn2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collette|first1=Joseph H.|last2=Hagadorn|first2=James W.|title=Three-dimensionally preserved arthropods from Cambrian Lagerstatten of Quebec and Wisconsin|journal=Journal of Paleontology|date=2010|volume=84|issue=4|pages=646–667}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ColletteGassHagadorn2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collette|first1=Joseph H|last2=Gass|first2=Kenneth C|last3=Hagadorn|first3=James W|title=Protichnites eremita unshelled?

==Fish, reptiles, birds, and naming of dinosaurs==
[[File:Richard Owen 1856.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Owen in 1856 with the skull of a crocodile]]
Owen's technical descriptions of the [[vertebrate|Vertebrata]] were still more numerous and extensive than those of the [[invertebrate]] animals. His ''Comparative Anatomy and Physiology of Vertebrates'' (3 vols. London 1866–1868) was indeed the result of more personal research than any similar work since [[Georges Cuvier]]'s ''Leçons d'anatomie comparée''. He not only studied existing forms but also devoted great attention to the remains of [[extinct]] groups, and followed Cuvier, the pioneer of [[vertebrate paleontology]]. Early in his career, he made exhaustive studies of [[teeth]] of existing and extinct animals and published his profusely illustrated work on ''Odontography'' (1840–1845). He discovered and described the remarkably complex structure of the [[teeth]] of the extinct animals which he named [[Labyrinthodontia]]. Among his writings on fish, his memoir on the African lungfish, which he named ''[[Protopterus]]'', laid the foundations for the recognition of the [[Lungfish|Dipnoi]] by [[Johannes Peter Müller|Johannes Müller]]. He also later pointed out the serial connection between the [[teleostean]] and [[ganoid]] fishes, grouping them in one sub-class, the [[Teleostomi]].

Most of his work on [[reptile]]s related to the [[skeleton]]s of extinct forms and his chief memoirs, on British specimens, were reprinted in a connected series in his ''History of British Fossil Reptiles'' (4 vols. London 1849–1884). He published the first important general account of the great group of [[Mesozoic]] land-reptiles, and he coined the name [[Dinosauria]] from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''δεινός'' (''deinos'') "terrible, powerful, wondrous" + ''σαύρος'' (''sauros'') "lizard".&lt;ref name="Owen 1841"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen|first1=Richard|title=Report on British fossil reptiles.  Part II.|journal=Report of the Eleventh Meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science; held at Plymouth in July 1841|date=1841|pages=60–204|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101076796059;view=1up;seq=102}} ; see p. 103.

(*Gr. ''δεινός'', fearfully great; ''σαύρος'', a lizard. … )"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC 2015"/&gt; Owen used 3 genera to define the dinosaurs: the carnivorous ''[[Megalosaurus]]'', the herbivorous ''[[Iguanodon]]'' and armoured ''[[Hylaeosaurus]]''', specimens uncovered in southern England.&lt;ref name="BBC 2015"/&gt; He also first recognized the curious early Mesozoic [[synapsids]], with affinities both to [[amphibia]]ns and [[mammal]]s, which he termed Anomodontia (the mammal-like [[synapsids]], [[Therapsida]]). Most of these were obtained from South Africa, beginning in 1845 (''[[Dicynodon]]'') and eventually furnished materials for his ''Catalogue of the Fossil Reptilia of South Africa'', issued by the [[British Museum]], in 1876. Among his writings on birds, his classical memoir on the [[kiwi]] (1840–1846), a long series of papers on the extinct [[Moa|Dinornithidae]] of [[New Zealand]], other memoirs on ''[[Adzebill|Aptornis]]'', the [[takahe]], the [[dodo]] and the [[great auk]], may be especially mentioned. His monograph on ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' (1863), the long-tailed, toothed bird from the [[Bavaria]]n lithographic stone, is also an epoch-making work.

With [[Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins]], Owen helped create the first life-size sculptures depicting dinosaurs as he thought they might have appeared. Some models were initially created for the [[Great Exhibition of 1851]], but 33 were eventually produced when [[the Crystal Palace]] was relocated to [[Sydenham]], in South London. Owen famously hosted a dinner for 21 prominent men of science inside the hollow concrete ''[[Iguanodon]]'' on New Year's Eve 1853. However, in 1849, a few years before his death in 1852, [[Gideon Mantell]] had realised that ''Iguanodon'', of which he was the discoverer, was not a heavy, [[Pachydermata|pachyderm]]-like animal,&lt;ref name=GM51&gt;{{cite book |last=Mantell |first=Gideon A. |title= Petrifications and their teachings: or, a handbook to the gallery of organic remains of the British Museum. |year=1851 |publisher=H. G. Bohn |location=London |oclc= 8415138}}&lt;/ref&gt; as Owen was proposing, but had slender forelimbs; his death left him unable to participate in the creation of the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures]], and so Owen's vision of dinosaurs became that seen by the public. He had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two ''Iguanodon'', one standing and one resting on its belly, were included.

==Work on mammals==
[[File:Camel Skeleton - Richard Owen - On the Anatomy of Vertebrates (1866).jpg|thumb|Owen's illustration of a [[camel]]'s [[skeleton]]]]
Owen was granted [[right of first refusal]] on any freshly dead animal at the London Zoo. His wife once arrived home to find the carcass of a newly deceased rhinoceros in her front hallway.&lt;ref name="Bryson2003"/&gt;

With regard to living mammals, the more striking of Owen's contributions relate to the [[monotreme]]s, [[marsupial]]s and the anthropoid [[ape]]s. He was also the first to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed ([[Odd-toed ungulate|Perissodactyla]]) and the even-toed ([[Even-toed ungulate|Artiodactyla]]), while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by [[Charles Darwin]], in South America. ''[[Toxodon]]'', from the [[pampas]], was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the [[Rodent]]ia, [[Edentata]] and [[herbivorous]] [[Cetacea]]. Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the giant [[armadillo]], which he named ''[[Glyptodon]]'' (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant [[ground sloth|ground-sloth]]s, ''[[Mylodon]]'' (1842) and ''[[Megatherium]]'' (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the [[false killer whale]] in 1863.

At the same time, Sir [[Thomas Mitchell (explorer)|Thomas Mitchell]]'s discovery of fossil bones, in [[New South Wales]], provided material for the first of Owen's long series of papers on the extinct mammals of Australia, which were eventually reprinted in book-form in 1877. He discovered ''[[Diprotodon]]'' (1838) and ''[[Thylacoleo]]'' (1859), besides extinct [[kangaroo]]s and [[wombat]]s, of gigantic size. While occupied with so much material from abroad, Owen was also busily collecting facts for an exhaustive work on similar fossils from the British Isles and, in 1844–1846, he published his ''History of British Fossil Mammals and Birds'', which was followed by many later memoirs, notably his ''Monograph of the Fossil Mammalia of the Mesozoic Formations'' (Palaeont. Soc., 1871). One of his latest publications was a little work entitled ''Antiquity of Man as deduced from the Discovery of a Human Skeleton during Excavations of the Docks at Tilbury'' (London, 1884).

==Owen, Darwin, and the theory of evolution==
[[File:dinornis1387.jpg|thumb|upright|Owen with a [[giant moa]] skeleton]]
Following [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|the voyage of the ''Beagle'']], [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] had at his disposal a considerable collection of specimens and, on 29 October 1836, he was introduced by [[Charles Lyell]] to Owen, who agreed to work on fossil bones collected in South America. Owen's subsequent revelations, that the extinct giant creatures were rodents and sloths, showed that they were related to current species in the same locality, rather than being relatives of similarly sized creatures in Africa, as Darwin had originally thought. This was one of the many influences that led Darwin later to formulate his own ideas on the concept of [[natural selection]].

At this time, Owen talked of his theories, influenced by [[Johannes Peter Müller]], that living matter had an "organising energy", a life-force that directed the growth of tissues and also determined the lifespan of the individual and of the species. Darwin was reticent about his own thoughts, understandably, when, on 19 December 1838, as secretary of the [[Geological Society of London]], he saw Owen and his allies ridicule the [[Lamarckian]] 'heresy' of Darwin's old tutor, [[Robert Edmund Grant]]. In 1841, when the recently married Darwin was ill, Owen was one of the few scientific friends to visit; however, Owen's opposition to any hint of [[Transmutation of species|transmutation]] made Darwin keep quiet about his hypothesis.

Sometime during the 1840s Owen came to the conclusion that species arise as the result of some sort of evolutionary process.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt; He believed that there was a total of six possible mechanisms: parthenogenesis, prolonged development, premature birth, congenital malformations, Lamarckian atrophy, Lamarckian hypertrophy and transmutation,&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt; of which he thought transmutation was the least likely.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt;  The historian of science Evelleen Richards has argued that Owen was likely sympathetic to developmental theories of evolution, but backed away from publicly proclaiming them after the critical reaction that had greeted the anonymously published evolutionary book ''[[Vestiges of the Natural History of Creation]]'' in 1844 (it was revealed only decades later that the book had been authored by publisher [[Robert Chambers (publisher born 1802)|Robert Chambers]]). Owen had been criticized for his own evolutionary remarks in his ''Nature of the Limbs'' in 1849.&lt;ref name="Richards1987"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Richards|first1=Evellen|title=A Question of Property Rights: Richard Owen's Evolutionism Reassessed|journal=British Journal for the History of Science|date=1987|volume=20|issue=2|pages=129–171|jstor=4026305}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of ''On the Nature of Limbs'' Owen had suggested that humans ultimately evolved from fish as the result of natural laws,&lt;ref&gt;Owen, 2007, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in his being criticized in the ''[[Manchester Spectator]]'' for denying that species such as humans were created by God.&lt;ref name="Rupke1994"/&gt;

During the [[development of Darwin's theory]], his investigation of [[barnacle]]s showed, in 1849, how their segmentation related to other crustaceans, showing how they had diverged from their relatives. To both Darwin and Owen such "homologies" in comparative anatomy were evidence of descent. Owen demonstrated fossil evidence of an evolutionary sequence of horses, as supporting his idea of development from archetypes in "ordained continuous becoming" and, in 1854, gave a [[British Association for the Advancement of Science|British Association]] talk on the impossibility of bestial apes, such as the recently discovered [[gorilla]], standing erect and being transmuted into men, but Owen did not rule out the possibility that humans had evolved from other extinct animals by evolutionary mechanisms other than transmutation. Working-class militants were trumpeting man's monkey origins. To crush these ideas, Owen, as President-elect of the Royal Association, announced his authoritative anatomical studies of primate brains, claiming that the human brain had structures that apes brains did not, and that therefore humans were a separate sub-class, starting a dispute which was subsequently satirised as the [[Great Hippocampus Question]]. Owen's main argument was that humans have much larger brains for their body size than other mammals including the great apes.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"/&gt; Darwin wrote that "I cannot swallow Man [being that] distinct from a Chimpanzee". The combative [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] used his March 1858 [[Royal Institution]] lecture to deny Owen's claim and affirmed that structurally, gorillas are as close to humans as they are to [[baboon]]s. He believed that the "mental &amp; moral faculties are essentially... the same kind in animals &amp; ourselves". This was a clear denial of Owen's claim for human uniqueness, given at the same venue.
[[File:Vertebrate archetype.jpg|thumb|This 1847 diagram by Richard Owen shows his conceptual archetype for all vertebrates]]
On the [[publication of Darwin's theory]], in ''[[On The Origin of Species]]'', he sent a complimentary copy to Owen, saying "it will seem 'an abomination{{' "}}. Owen was the first to respond, courteously claiming that he had long believed that "existing influences" were responsible for the "ordained" birth of species. Darwin now had long talks with him and Owen said that the book offered the best explanation "ever published of the manner of formation of species", although he still had the gravest doubts that transmutation would bestialize man. It appears that Darwin had assured Owen that he was looking at everything as resulting from designed laws, which Owen interpreted as showing a shared belief in "Creative Power".

As head of the Natural History Collections at the [[British Museum]], Owen received numerous inquiries and complaints about the ''Origin''. His own views remained unknown: when emphasising to a Parliamentary committee the need for a new Natural History museum, he pointed out that "The whole intellectual world this year has been excited by a book on the origin of species; and what is the consequence? Visitors come to the British Museum, and they say, 'Let us see all these varieties of pigeons: where is the tumbler, where is the pouter?' and I am obliged with shame to say, I can show you none of them" .... "As to showing you the varieties of those species, or of any of those phenomena that would aid one in getting at that mystery of mysteries, the origin of species, our space does not permit; but surely there ought to be a space somewhere, and, if not in the British Museum, where is it to be obtained?"

However, Huxley's attacks were making their mark. In April 1860 the ''Edinburgh Review'' included Owen's anonymous review of the ''Origin''. In it Owen showed his anger at what he saw as Darwin's caricature of the creationist position, and his ignoring Owen's "axiom of the continuous operation of the ordained becoming of living things". As well as attacking Darwin's "disciples", Hooker and Huxley, for their "short-sighted adherence", he thought that the book symbolised the sort of "abuse of science... to which a neighbouring nation, some seventy years since, owed its temporary degradation" in a reference to the [[French Revolution]]. Darwin thought it "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever, and... damaging" and later commented that "The Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about. It is painful to be hated in the intense degree with which Owen hates me."

During the [[reaction to Darwin's theory]], Huxley's arguments with Owen continued. Owen tried to smear Huxley, by portraying him as an "advocate of man's origins from a transmuted ape" and one of his contributions to the ''Athenaeum'' was titled "Ape-Origin of Man as Tested by the Brain". In 1862 (and on other occasions) Huxley took the opportunity to arrange demonstrations of ape brain anatomy (e.g. at the BA meeting, where [[William Henry Flower|William Flower]] performed the dissection). Visual evidence of the supposedly missing structures ([[posterior horn of lateral ventricle|posterior cornu]] and [[hippocampus minor]]) was used, in effect, to indict Owen for perjury. Owen had argued that the absence of those structures in apes were connected with the lesser size to which the ape brains grew, but he then conceded that a poorly developed version might be construed as present without preventing him from arguing that brain size was still the major way of distinguishing apes and humans.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"/&gt;  Huxley's campaign ran over two years and was devastatingly successful at persuading the overall scientific community, with each "slaying" being followed by a recruiting drive for the Darwinian cause. The spite lingered. While Owen had argued that humans were distinct from apes by virtue of having large brains, Huxley claimed that racial diversity blurred any such distinction.  In his paper criticizing Owen, Huxley directly states: "if we place A, the European brain, B, the [[Bosjesman]] brain, and C, the orang brain, in a series, the differences between A and B, so far as they have been ascertained, are of the same nature as the chief of those between B and C".&lt;ref name="Huxley1861"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huxley|first1=Thomas Henry|title=On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals|journal=Natural History Review|date=1861|volume=1|pages=67–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Owen countered Huxley by saying the brains of all human races were really of similar size and intellectual ability, and that the fact that humans had brains that were twice the size of large apes like male gorillas, even though humans had much smaller bodies, made humans distinguishable.&lt;ref name="Cosans2009"/&gt;  When Huxley joined the Zoological Society Council, in 1861, Owen left and, in the following year, Huxley moved to stop Owen from being elected to the Royal Society Council, accusing him "of wilful &amp; deliberate falsehood". (See also [[Thomas Henry Huxley]].)

In January 1863, Owen bought the ''[[Archaeopteryx]]'' fossil for the [[British Museum]]. It fulfilled Darwin's prediction that a proto-bird with unfused wing fingers would be found, although Owen described it unequivocally as a bird.

The feuding between Owen and Darwin's supporters continued. In 1871, Owen was found to be involved in a threat to end government funding of [[Joseph Dalton Hooker]]'s botanical collection, at [[Kew]], possibly trying to bring it under his [[British Museum]]. Darwin commented that "I used to be ashamed of hating him so much, but now I will carefully cherish my hatred &amp; contempt to the last days of my life".

==Legacy==
[[File:Richard Owen with his granddaughter.jpg|thumb|upright|Owen with his granddaughter Emily]]
Owen's detailed memoirs and descriptions require laborious attention in reading, on account of their complex terminology and ambiguous modes of expression. The fact that very little of his terminology has found universal favour causes them to be more generally neglected than they otherwise would be. At the same time, it must be remembered that he was a pioneer in concise anatomical nomenclature and, so far at least as the vertebrate skeleton is concerned, his terms were based on a carefully reasoned philosophical scheme, which first clearly distinguished between the now-familiar phenomena of [[Analogy (biology)|analogy]] and [[homology (biology)|homology]]. Owen's theory of the Archetype and Homologies of the Vertebrate Skeleton (1848), subsequently illustrated also by his little work ''On the Nature of Limbs'' (1849), regarded the vertebrate frame as consisting of a series of fundamentally identical segments, each modified according to its position and functions. Much of it was fanciful and failed when tested by the facts of [[embryology]], which Owen systematically ignored, throughout his work. However, though an imperfect and distorted view of certain great truths, it possessed a distinct value at the time of its conception.

To the discussion of the deeper problems of biological philosophy, he made scarcely any direct and definite contributions. His generalities rarely extended beyond strict comparative anatomy, the phenomena of adaptation to function and the facts of geographical or geological distribution. His lecture on virgin reproduction or [[parthenogenesis]], however, published in 1849, contained the essence of the [[germ plasm theory]], elaborated later by [[August Weismann]] and he made several vague statements concerning the geological succession of genera and species of animals and their possible derivation one from another. He referred, especially, to the changes exhibited by the successive forerunners of the [[crocodile]]s (1884) and horses (1868) but it has never become clear how much of the modern doctrines of organic evolution he admitted. He contented himself with the bare remark that "the inductive demonstration of the nature and mode of operation of the laws governing life would henceforth be the great aim of the philosophical naturalist."

He was the first director in [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in London and his statue was in the main hall there until 2009, when it was replaced with a statue of Darwin.

A bust of Owen by [[Alfred Gilbert]] (1896) is held in the [[Hunterian Museum, London]]. There is a blue plaque in his honour at [[Lancaster Royal Grammar School]].

Owen has been described by some as a malicious, dishonest and hateful individual. He has been described in one biography as being a "social experimenter with a penchant for sadism. Addicted to controversy and driven by arrogance and jealousy". [[Deborah Cadbury]] stated that Owen possessed an "almost fanatical egoism with a callous delight in savaging his critics." Indeed, an Oxford University professor once described Owen as "a damned liar. He lied for God and for malice".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.strangescience.net/owen.htm Rocky Road: Sir Richard Owen].

{{Quotation|No one fact tells so strongly against Owen...as that he has never reared one pupil or follower.|Charles Darwin to [[Asa Gray]], 1860, in ''More Letters of C.D'', p. 153}}

Owen famously credited himself and [[Georges Cuvier]] with the discovery of the ''[[Iguanodon]]'', completely excluding any credit for the original discoverer of the dinosaur, [[Gideon Mantell]]. This was not the first or last time Owen would falsely claim a discovery as his own. It has also been suggested by some authors, including [[Bill Bryson]] in ''[[A Short History of Nearly Everything]]'', that Owen even used his influence in the [[Royal Society]] to ensure that many of Mantell’s research papers were never published. Owen was finally dismissed from the Royal Society's Zoological Council for [[plagiarism]].
[[File:Richard Owen, riding his hobby.jpg|thumb|left|upright|1873 [[caricature]] of Owen "riding his hobby", by [[Frederick Waddy]]]]
When Mantell suffered an accident that left him permanently crippled, Owen exploited the opportunity by renaming several dinosaurs which had already been named by Mantell, even having the audacity to claim credit for their discovery himself. When Mantell finally died in 1852, an obituary carrying no byline derided Mantell as little more than a mediocre scientist, who brought forth few notable contributions. The obituary’s authorship was universally attributed to Owen by every geologist. The president of the Geological Society claimed that it "bespeaks of the lamentable coldness of the heart of the writer". Owen was subsequently denied the presidency of the society for his repeated and pointed antagonism towards Gideon Mantell.

Even more extraordinary was the way Owen ignored the genuine scientific content of Mantell's work. For example, despite the paucity of finds Mantell had worked out that some dinosaurs were bipedal, including ''[[Iguanodon]]''. This remarkable insight was totally ignored by Owen, whose instructions for the [[Crystal Palace Dinosaurs|Crystal Palace models]] by [[Waterhouse Hawkins]] portrayed ''Iguanodon'' as grossly overweight and quadrupedal, with its misidentified thumb on its nose. Mantell did not live to witness the discovery in 1878 of articulated skeletons in a Belgium coal-mine that showed ''Iguanodon'' was mostly bipedal (and in that stance could use its thumb for defence). Owen made no comment or retraction; he never did on any errors he made. Moreover, since the earliest known dinosaurs were bipedal, Mantell's idea was indeed insightful.
[[File:Old Owen@72.jpg|thumb|upright|Richard Owen in old age]]
Despite originally starting out on good terms with Darwin, Owen was highly critical of the ''Origin'' in large part because Darwin did not refer much to the previous scientific theories of evolution that had been proposed by people like Chambers and himself, and instead compared the theory of evolution by natural selection with the unscientific theory in the Bible.

Another reason for his criticism of the ''Origin'', some historians claim, was that Owen felt upstaged by Darwin and supporters such as Huxley, and his judgment was clouded by jealousy. Owen in Darwin's opinion was "Spiteful, extremely malignant, clever; the Londoners say he is mad with envy because my book is so talked about".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext01/1mlcd10.txt|title=More Letters of Charles Darwin — Volume 1 A Record of His Work in a Series of Hitherto Unpublished Letters|first=Charles|last=Darwin|editor-first1=Francis|editor-last1=Darwin|editor-first2=A.

In the article, Owen was critical of Darwin for not offering many new observations, and heaped praise (in the third person) upon himself, while being careful not to associate any particular comment with his own name.&lt;ref&gt;[http://darwin.gruts.com/docs/er-1860-04/ Darwin on the Origin of Species]. Darwin.gruts.com. Retrieved on 2011-09-17.&lt;/ref&gt; Owen did praise, however, the ''Origin'''s description of Darwin's work on insect behavior and pigeon breeding as Huxley, Thomas H., (1861), "On the Zoological Relations of Man with the Lower Animals", Natural History Review 1: 67–84."real gems".&lt;ref name="Owen1860"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Owen (published anonymously)|first1=Richard|title=Darwin on the Origin of Species|journal=Edinburgh Review|date=1860|volume=111|pages=487–532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owen was also a party to the threat to end government funding of the [[Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew]] botanical collection (see [[Joseph Dalton Hooker#Attacks on Hooker and on Kew|Attacks on Hooker and Kew]]), orchestrated by [[Acton Smee Ayrton]]:
:"There is no doubt that rivalry resulted between the British Museum, where there was the very important Herbarium of the Department of Botany, and Kew. The rivalry at times became extremely personal, especially between Joseph Hooker and Owen...  At the root was Owen’s feeling that Kew should be subordinate to the British Museum (and to Owen) and should not be allowed to develop as an independent scientific institution with the advantage of a great botanic garden." &lt;ref&gt;Turrill W.B. 1963. ''Joseph Dalton Hooker''. Nelson, London. p90.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested by some authors that the portrayal of Owen as a vindictive and treacherous man was fostered and encouraged by his rivals (particularly Darwin, Hooker and Huxley) and may be somewhat undeserved. In the first part of his career he was regarded rightly as one of the great scientific figures of the age. In the second part of his career his reputation slipped. This was not due solely to his underhanded dealings with colleagues; it was also due to serious errors of scientific judgement that were discovered and publicized. A fine example was his decision to classify man in a separate subclass of the Mammalia (see ''[[Man's place in nature]]''). In this Owen had no supporters at all. Also, his unwillingness to come off the fence concerning evolution became increasingly damaging to his reputation as time went on. Owen continued working after his official retirement at the age of 79, but he never recovered the good opinions he had garnered in his younger days.&lt;ref&gt;Desmond A. 1982.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10736">'''Self-evaluation maintenance''' ('''SEM''') theory refers to discrepancies between two people in a relationship. Two people in a relationship each aim to keep themselves feeling good psychologically throughout a comparison process to the other person.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tesser |first=A. |year=1988 |chapter=Toward a self-evaluation maintenance model of social behavior |editor-first=L. |editor-last=Berkowitz |title=Advances in Experimental Social Psychology |volume=21 |pages=181–227 |location=New York |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-015221-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Self-evaluation is defined as the way a person views him/herself. It is the continuous process of determining personal growth and progress, which can be raised or lowered by the behavior of a close other (a person that is psychologically close).  People are more threatened by friends than strangers. [[Abraham Tesser]] created the self-evaluation maintenance theory in 1988. The self-evaluation maintenance model assumes two things: that a person will try to maintain or increase their own self-evaluation, and self-evaluation is influenced by relationships with others.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt;

== Description ==

A person's self-evaluation (which is similar to [[self-esteem]]) may be raised when a close other performs well.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; For example, a sibling scores the winning goal in an important game. Self-evaluation will increase because that person is sharing his/her success. The closer the psychological relationship and the greater the success, the more a person will share in the success.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; This is considered the ''reflection'' process. When closeness and performance are high, self-evaluation is raised in the reflection process. If someone who is psychologically close performs well on a task that is irrelevant to a person's [[self-definition]], that person is able to benefit by sharing in the success of the achievement.

At the same time, the success of a close other can decrease someone's self-evaluation in the comparison process. This is because the success of a close other invites ''comparison'' on one's own capabilities, thereby directly affecting one's own self-evaluation.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; This is also strengthened with the closeness of the psychological relationship with the successful other. Using the same example: a sibling scores the winning goal in an important game; the person is now comparing him/herself to the sibling's success and through comparison, his/her self-evaluation is lowered. When closeness (sibling) and performance (scored the winning goal) are high, self-evaluation is decreased in the comparison process.

In both the reflection and comparison processes, closeness and performance level are significant. If the closeness of another decreases, then a person is less likely to share the success and/or compare him/herself, which lessens the likelihood of decreasing self-evaluation. A person is more likely to compare him/herself to someone close to him/her, like a sibling or a best friend, than a stranger. There are different factors in which a person can assume closeness: family, friends, people with similar characteristics, etc. If an individual is not close to a particular person, then it makes sense that he/she will not share in their success or be threatened by their success. At the same time, if the person's performance is low, there is no reason to share the success and increase self-evaluation; there is also no reason to compare him/herself to the other person, decreasing self-evaluation. Because their performance is low, there is no reason it should raise or lower his/her self-evaluation. According to Tesser's (1988) theory, if a sibling did not do well in his/her game, then there is no reason the individual's self-evaluation will be affected.

Closeness and performance can either raise self-evaluation through reflection or lower self-evaluation through comparison. Relevance determines whether reflection or comparison will occur. There are many different dimensions that can be important to an individual's self-definition. A self-defining factor is any factor that is important to who a person is. For example, an ability or success in music may be important to one's self-definition, but at the same time, being good in math may not be as important. Relevance assumes that a particular factor that is important to an individual is also important to another person. Relevance can be as simple as a shared dimension which he/she considers important to who he/she is. If relevance is high, then one will engage in comparison, but if relevance is low, one will engage in reflection.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; For example, if athletics is important to a person and that person considers athletics to be an important dimension of his/her self-definition, then when a sibling does well in athletics, the comparison process will take place and his/her self-evaluation will decrease. On the other hand, if athletics is not a dimension he/she uses for self-definition, the reflection process will take place and he/she will celebrate the sibling's success with the sibling; his/her self-evaluation will increase along with the sibling's because he/she is not threatened or challenged by the sibling's athletic capability.

Tesser (1988) suggests that people may do things to reduce the decrease in self-evaluation from comparison. One can spend less time with that particular individual, thereby reducing closeness or one can change their important self-definition and take up a new hobby or focus on a different self-defining activity, which reduces relevance. The third way of avoiding a decrease in self-evaluation through the comparison process is to affect another's performance (e.g. by hiding a sibling's favorite shoes, or believe that his/her performance was based on luck) or one can improve their own skills by practicing more. This theory poses the question: under what conditions will someone get in the way of another's performance? The answer is that it depends on closeness of the individuals and the relevance of the activity. When the relevance is high, the comparison process is more important than the reflection process. When the relevance is high and the activity is high in self-defining importance, the other person poses a larger threat than when the relevance is low.

== Research example ==

Tesser &amp; Smith (1980) experimented with this theory. Men were recruited and asked to bring a friend with them. They were then put into groups of four, Man A and Man A's friend along with Man B and Man B's friend. Half the subjects were told that this activity was measuring important verbal skills and leadership. This was the high relevance group. The other two subjects were told that the task had nothing to do with verbal skills, leadership or anything important. This was considered the low relevance group. The activity was based on the game Password, where persons have to guess a word based on clues. Each man was given an opportunity to guess the word while the other three gave clues from a list. The other three can give clues that are easy or difficult based on their own judgment and basically whether or not they would like to help the other person guess the word. The clues given to the person were necessary to guess the word. The first pair of partners performed poorly (as instructed in the experimental design). The experiment was looking at the behavior of the second group of men. The next pairing was designed to partner a stranger with a friend. Researchers were trying to see when a friend was helped more than a stranger and when a stranger was helped more than a friend. The research was supported. In 10 out of 13 sessions, when relevance was high (told that this activity measures important verbal and leadership skills) the stranger was helped more than a friend. Also, in 10 out of 13 sessions, when relevance was low (subjects were told that this activity determined nothing of importance) the friend was helped more than the stranger.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt; The prediction of the self-evaluation maintenance theory was strongly supported.

Zuckerman &amp; Jost (2001) compares the self-evaluation maintenance theory to the work of Feld (1991). As the self-evaluatory maintenance theory would lead one to judge a stranger higher than their friends (based on popularity) in order to prevent a drop in self-evaluation, Feld's (1991) research demonstrated that people must have fewer friends than their friends do in order to remain popular. This is based on a mathematical equation that explains why popular people are involved in more social circles than unpopular people. These are not the only two research examples. For more examples see the references.

This graph illustrates the basic principles of Tesser's (1988) self-evaluatory maintenance model of behavior. Relevance determines whether reflection or comparison will occur. When relevance is low (the factor does not affect self-definition) as the other's performance increases, so does self-evaluation, allowing that person to share in the celebration of the other person (reflection). When relevance is high (the factor is important to self-definition also) as the other's performance increases, self-evaluation decreases because that person is being compared to the other person (comparison). If relevance is high, then one will engage in comparison, but if relevance is low, one will engage in reflection.&lt;ref name="Tesser, 1988"/&gt;

'''''Seny''''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈsɛɲ|ec}}; from Proto-Germanic *sinnaz) is a form of ancestral [[Catalonia|Catalan]] wisdom or sensibleness. It involves well-pondered perception of situations, level-headedness, awareness, integrity, and right action.  More specifically, a ''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]'' anthropologist defined ''seny'' as "a kind of refined good sense and self-realization."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=National Geographic People of the World|page=181|last=Kostyal|first=K.M.|year=2001|publisher=''[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]''|ISBN=0-7922-6401-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of ''seny'' is known as '''''rauxa''''' ({{IPA-ca|ˈrawʃə|pron}}) "sudden determination or action".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dlc.iec.cat/results.asp?txtEntrada=rauxa&amp;operEntrada=0]''Institut d'Estudis Catalans''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural significance==
Many Catalans consider ''seny'' something unique to their culture, a true [[Catalan symbols|Catalan symbol]]. ''Seny'' as a particular characteristic of Catalan society is based on a set of ancestral local customs stemming from the [[Ethics|scale of values]] and [[Sociology|social norms]] of traditional Catalan rural society. The values of ''seny'' were transmitted from generation to generation without much change by the exemplary behaviour of the elder members of the family, as well as in the shape of aphorisms and moral stories. The latter were largely based on [[Christian]] values and their examples and illustrations often included animals and plants that were common in rural Catalonia.

This oral lore caught the attention of [[Josep Torras i Bages]], bishop of [[Vic]] at the beginning of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Josep Torras i Bages, ''La tradició catalana'', 1892&lt;/ref&gt;
He became very interested in the pattern in which the ''seny'' was transmitted from one generation to the other as an [[oral tradition]]. Thus he encouraged [[Josep Abril i Virgili]] (1869–1918), a writer, to gather the moral stories and illustrate them in a book that was published as ''Bon seny'' ("Good sense"). This more or less representative compilation of moral lessons regarding ''seny'' was illustrated by artist [[Joan Junceda]] (1881–1948).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0035068 Joan Junceda: l'Enciclopèdia&amp;nbsp;– enciclopedia.cat] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120219034538/http://www.enciclopedia.cat/fitxa_v2.jsp?NDCHEC=0035068 |date=2012-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Published in the Catalan language before the [[Spanish Civil War]] ''Bon seny'' became rare during [[General Franco]]'s era, when so much Catalan printed material had been burned and printing in Catalan was severely restricted.&lt;ref&gt;'''Bon seny''', aforismes, faules i acudits; Balmes DL, Barcelona, Reprinted 1984&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the ''seny'' proverbs that defined traditional Catalan values have lost most of their sense today. The reason is the erosion of Christian values as fundamental in present-day [[Postchristianity|postchristian]] Catalan society, which sees itself today as a society based largely on secular principles.

''Seny'' is mentioned in the motto of [[castell]]s, the Catalan tradition of building human towers, as one of the values of that endeavour: ''Força, equilibri, valor i seny'' (strength, balance, courage, and ''seny'').

==Examples==
*Many of the ''seny'' aphorisms are short:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|
:''Tenen els plaers de la vida,
:''bona entrada i mala eixida.

:''L'home avar és com el porc,
:''no aprofita fins que és mort.

:''No vos 'nemoreu, amor,
:''de cap fadrina gallarda
:''que és com la flor d'olivarda
:''molt guapa, i dolenta d'olor

:''Home pelut,
:''o és molt savi o és molt ruc.
||
:The pleasures of life have,
:a good entrance and a bad exit.

:The tight-fisted man is like a pig,
:he is only useful after death.

:My dear one, don't fall in love
:with any woman who only has good looks,
:she is like a [[false yellowhead]] ''(Dittrichia viscosa)'' flower:
:beautiful, but full of stench (unpleasantness).

:A hairy man,
:is either very wise or (brutish) like a donkey.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

*The following story, ''La rata magra'' o ''La rata engarjolada'', illustrates the dangers of greed:

&lt;center&gt;
{|
|
:''Rata magra veu l'ocell,''
:''tranquil a dintre sa gàbia,''
:''i, amb tota la seva ràbia, s'hi fica;
:''i el passarell té un surt fort, i es mort.''

:''Rata magra s'el cruspeix,''
:''mes s'ha tant ben atipada,''
:''que, de cop, no té passada.''

:''Moral:''
:''Quan t'atii la maldat,''
:''pensa aixó que es veritat:''
:''Panxa prim hi passaràs,''
:''massa fart t'hi quedaràs.''

||

:The lean rat sees the bird
:sitting quietly in its cage,
:and full of anger she enters it
:and the bird dies startled.

:The lean rat eats it,
:but she has filled her belly so much
:that, suddenly, she is not able to leave (the cage).

:''Morale:''
:When evil tempts you,
:think about the following truth:
:With a lean belly you will escape
:Too full, you will be trapped.
|}
&lt;/center&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2684">In [[philosophy]], a '''state of affairs''' ({{lang-de|Sachverhalt}}), also known as a '''situation''', is a way the [[actual world]] must be in order to make some given ''proposition'' about the actual world true; in other words, a state of affairs (situation) is a ''truth-maker'', whereas a [[proposition]] is a ''truth-bearer''. Whereas states of affairs (situations) either ''obtain'' or ''fail-to-obtain'', propositions are either ''true'' or ''false''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/states-of-affairs/ Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Online]&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[David Malet Armstrong]] is well known for his defence of a '''factualism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, a position according to which the world is a world of facts and not a world of things.&lt;ref&gt;David Armstrong, ''A World of States of Affairs'', Cambridge University Press, 1997, p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
In a sense of "state of affairs" favored by [[Ernest Sosa]], states of affairs are situational [[Condition (philosophy)|conditions]]. In fact, in the ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy'',&lt;ref name=Sosa&gt;[[Ernest Sosa]], 1999. "Condition".  ''Cambridge Dictionary of Philosophy''.  R.Audi, Ed.  Cambridge: Cambridge UP. p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt; Sosa defines a condition to be a state of affairs, "way things are" or situation—most commonly referred to by a [[nominalization]] of a [[sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]. The expression "Snow's being white", which refers to the condition snow's being white, is a nominalization of the sentence "Snow is white".&lt;ref name=Sosa/&gt; "The [[truth]] of the proposition that "snow is white" is a nominalization of the sentence "the proposition that snow is white is true". Snow's being white is a necessary and sufficient condition for the truth of the proposition that snow is white. Conditions in this sense may be called situational.

Usually, [[necessity and sufficiency]] relate conditions of the same kind. Being an animal is a necessary attributive condition for being a dog.  Fido's being an animal is a necessary situational condition for Fido's being a dog.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10510">'''System archetypes''' are patterns of behavior of a [[system]]. Systems expressed by [[causal loop diagram|circles of causality]] have therefore similar [[structure]]. Identifying a system [[archetype]] and finding the [[lever]]age enables efficient changes in a system. The basic system archetypes and possible solutions of the problems are mentioned in the section ''[[#Examples of system archetypes|Examples of system archetypes]]''.&lt;ref name="ps"&gt;{{Citation| last=Senge | first=Peter M. | year=1990 | title=The Fifth Discipline | publisher=Doubleday/Currency | isbn=0-385-26094-6 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bVZqAAAAMAAJ }}&lt;/ref&gt; A fundamental property of nature is that no cause can affect the past. System archetypes do not imply that current causes affect past effects.

== Circles of causality ==

The basic idea of [[system thinking]] is that every action triggers a reaction. In [[system dynamics]] this reaction is called [[feedback]]. There are two types of feedback – [[positive feedback|reinforcing feedback]] and [[negative feedback|balancing feedback]]. Sometimes a feedback (or a reaction) does not occur immediately – the process contains delays. Any system can be drawn as a [[diagram]] set up with circles of [[causality]] – including actions, feedbacks and delays.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Reinforcing feedback (+) ==

[[positive feedback|Reinforcing feedback]] (or amplifying feedback) accelerates the given trend of a process. If the trend is ascending, the reinforcing (positive) feedback will accelerate the growth. If the trend is descending, it will accelerate the decline. Falling of an avalanche is an example of the reinforcing feedback process.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Balancing feedback (−) ==

[[negative feedback|Balancing feedback]] (or stabilizing feedback) will work if any [[goal-state]] exists. Balancing process intends to reduce a gap between a current state and a desired state. The balancing (negative) feedback adjusts a present state to a desirable target regardless whether the trend is descending or ascending. An example of the balancing feedback process is staying upright on bicycle (when riding).&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Delays ==

Delays in systems cause people to perceive a response to an action incorrectly. This causes an under- or overestimation of the needed action and results in [[oscillation]], instability or even breakdown.&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;

== Examples of system archetypes ==

The following System Archetyes describe the most common generic structures. Before effectively addressing a specific situation, the underlying pattern must be identified. The following Flow Diagram should help identifying these archetypes. The links between the different archetypes are an indicator of most common connections. Keep in mind that in every situation, there may be more possible ways to follow, though. Consider that everyone is located somewhere in the flow, and that every possible situation has its own advantages, down-sides, cave-ats, and options. Nevertheless, correctly identifying and understanding your situation is always the first step of solving your problem in a sustainable way.

[[File:SD Archetypes.png|alt=Overview of common System Dynamics Archetypes|thumb|924x924px|Overview of common System Dynamics Archetypes|none]]

=== Balancing process with delay ===

This archetype explains the system in which the response to action is delayed. If the agents do not perceive the delayed feedback, they might overshoot or underestimate the requisite action in order to reach their goals. This could be avoided by being patient or by accelerating reactions of the system to realized measures.
Example: [[supply chain]] ([[Beer distribution game|The Beer Game]])&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Balancing process with delay.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Balancing process with delay"''']]

=== Limits to growth ===

The unprecedented growth is produced by a reinforcing feedback process until the system reaches its peak. The halt of this growth is caused by limits inside or outside of the system. However, if the limits are not properly recognized; the former methods are continuously applied, but more and more aggressively. This results in the contrary of the desired state – a decrease of the system. The solution lies in the weakening or elimination of the cause of limitation.  
Example: [[dieting]], learning foreign languages&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt; 
[[File:Limits to growth.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Limits to growth"''']]
[[Attractiveness principle|Attractiveness Principle]] is an archetype derived from Limits to Growth. The main difference is that Attractiveness Principle assumes growth is limited with two or more factors.

=== Shifting the burden ===

The problem is handled by a simple solution with immediate effect, thereby "healing the symptoms". The primary source of the problem is overlooked, because its remedy is demanding and has no immediate outcome. The origin of the problem should be identified and solved in the long-term run during which the [[Substance dependence|addiction]] to the [[symptomatic treatment|symptomatic remedy]] decreases. 
Example: [[drug addiction]], paying debts by borrowing&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Shifting the burden.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Shifting the burden"''']]

=== Shifting the burden to the intervenor ===

A special case of the “Shifting the Burden” systems archetype that occurs when an intervenor is brought in to help solve an ongoing problem.  Over time, as the intervenor successfully handles the problem, the people within the system become less capable of solving the problem themselves.  They become even more dependent on the intervenor.  Examples:  ongoing use of outside consultants.

In simple terms, this is an archetype whereby a system grows increasingly dependent on an outside intervenor to help it function. In the short-term this works, but in the long term the system is unable to function on its  own due to the dependence on the intervention and eventually fails to perform.

[[File:Shifting the burden to the Intervenor.png|alt=|none|frame|'''Causal loop diagram "Shifting the burden to the intervenor"'''|387x387px]]

=== Eroding goals ===

A kind of shifting the burden archetype. As current problems need to be handled immediately, the long-term goals continuously decline. It can be avoided by sticking to the vision. 
Example: balancing the [[public debt]], sliding limits of [[environmental pollution]]&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Eroding goals.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Eroding goals"''']]

=== [[Escalation archetype|Escalation]] ===

This archetype could be seen as a [[non-cooperative game]] where both players suppose that just one of them can win. They are responding to actions of the other player in order to “defend themselves”. The aggression grows and can result in [[self-destructive behavior]]. The [[Virtuous circle and vicious circle|vicious circle]] can be broken by one agent stopping to react defensively and turn the game into cooperative one. 
Example: [[arms race]]&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Escalation.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Escalation"''']]

=== Success to successful ===

Two people or activities need the same limited resources. As one of them becomes more successful, more resources are assigned to him/it. The second one becomes less and less successful due to lacking resources, and “prove the right decision” to support the first one. Problems occur if the [[competition]] is unhealthy and interferes with the goals of the whole system. The two activities or agents might be decoupled or they should receive balanced amount of resources.
Examples: two products of one company, work vs. family&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Success to the successful.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Success to the successful"''']]

=== [[Tragedy of the commons]] ===

Agents use common [[scarcity|limited resource]] to profit individually. As the use of the resource is not controlled, the agents would like to continuously raise their [[Economics|benefits]]. The resource is therefore used more and more and the [[revenues]] of the agents are decreasing. The agents are intensifying their [[Exploitation of natural resources|exploitation]] until the resource is completely used up or seriously damaged. To protect common resources some form of [[regulation]] should be introduced.
Example: [[fish stocks]] (The Fishing Game)&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Tragedy of the commons.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Tragedy of the commons"''']]

=== Fixes that fail ===

In the [[fixes that fail]] archetype, the problem is solved by some fix (a specific [[solution]]) with immediate positive effect. Nonetheless, the “[[unintended consequence|side effects]]” of this solution turn out in the future. The best remedy seems to apply the same solution. 
Example: [[saving costs]] on [[Maintenance, repair and operations|maintenance]], paying [[interest]] by other [[loans]] (with other interests)&lt;ref name="ps" /&gt;
[[File:Fixes that fail.PNG|none|framed|'''Causal loop diagram "Fixes that fail"''']]

=== [[Growth and underinvestment]] ===

The limit to growth is the current [[production capacity]]. It can be removed by sufficient [[investment]] in new capacities. If the investment is not aggressive enough (or it is too low), the capacities are overloaded, the [[Quality (business)|quality]] of services declines and the [[demand]] decreases. This archetype is especially important in capacity planning. &lt;ref name=SDACP&gt;{{cite journal|last=Spicar|first=Radim|title=System Dynamics Archetypes in Capacity Planning|journal=Procedia Engineering|date=4.3.2014|volume=69|issue=C|pages=1350–1355|doi=10.1016/j.proeng.2014.03.128|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877705814003749|accessdate=29 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3148">'''The Global 100''' Index is a ranking of the world's most [[sustainable]] corporations. The list is compiled by Toronto-based media and investment advisory firm, [[Corporate Knights]] (CK).

Each year, the latest iteration of the index is announced at the [[World Economic Forum]] in Davos, Switzerland.

As at December 31, 2013 the Global 100 has outperformed its benchmark, the [[MSCI]] All Country World Index by 3.21%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.corporateknights.com/article/corporate-knights-announces-latest-additions-its-widely-followed-global-100-index-world-econ&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The Global 100 was created by Corporate Knights Magazine in 2005. The goal of creating the index was to devise a methodology to quantitatively compare and rank the world’s largest public companies.

==Methodology==

The Global 100 uses a purely quantitative methodology to determine inclusion in the ranking. The Global 100 starting universe automatically considers all firms with a market capitalization of at least US$2 billion. The firms are then put through numerous screenings to test for key information, including; overall sustainability disclosure rate and sustainability disclosure rate versus [[Global Industry Classification Standard|GICS]] sector peers, a financially based Piotroski [[F-score]] to ensure financial stability, and fines, penalties or settlements paid out by the company for sustainability related violations. Companies in the GICS sub-industry categories of tobacco and those engaged primarily in defence are eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;http://global100.org/methodology/&lt;/ref&gt;

The initial screening process culminates in the Global 100 shortlist. At this point, companies are compared on priority key performance indicators (KPIs), according to GICS sector. Priority indicators are chosen based on the percentage of firms in the sector who disclose the indicator. If less than 10% disclose, than the indicator will not be considered a priority KPI for that sector. There are a maximum of 12 KPIs used in the ranking, they are:

* Energy Productivity
* Carbon Productivity
* Water Productivity
* Waste Productivity
* Innovation Capacity
* Percentage Tax Paid
* CEO to Average Worker Pay
* Pension Fund Status
* Safety Performance
* Employee Turnover
* Leadership Diversity
* Clean Capitalism Pay Link

Each KPI is weighted equally and companies are given an overall percentage score. Failure to disclose a priority KPI will result in a zero, thus severely punishing firms for [[non-disclosure]].

==Accolades==
The Global 100 Index has been recognized as a leader in transparency and industry best practices for sustainability rankings, according to SustainAbility’s Rate the Raters project.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sustainability.com/projects/rate-the-raters#projtab-6&lt;/ref&gt;

They are almost always populated with mature experts who know what's at stake, what needs to be done, and how to work well with others.  Their strengths are diversity of knowledge, a single focus or purpose, cross-functional communications, decision-making sovereignty, and organizational agility.

The metaphor of a tiger comes from the power and agility of the teams and their ability to "pounce" into action.  There are no limits to their size, reasons, or purpose parameters.  They may be assigned to locate new knowledge sources, create an impactful event, or form an exit plan.  The scope of their work may be very large or very small.  They may be a team for a few days, or for many years.  They may meet regularly, frequently, intermittently, or rarely.

==History==

The concept originally came out of early [[NASA]] innovations for solving technical or systemic problems. Tiger teams began as specialized units to test [[computer security]] for the military and the [[aerospace]] industry. These teams were specifically hired to determine how easily an organization's security measures and data could be accessed or hacked. When successful, members of the tiger team would usually leave behind notes with messages such as "busted" or "your code book has been stolen" to indicate that the system had been penetrated.&lt;ref name="new-frontier"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newdirectionsconsulting.com/leadership-engagement/tiger-teams-the-new-frontier-of-teaming-2/|title=Tiger Teams: The Next Frontier of Teaming - New Directions Consulting|website=www.newdirectionsconsulting.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tiger teams were traditionally made up of expert hackers who had experience in attacking remote networks and secure communication channels. The members were regarded for their willingness to break the rules and their ability to think outside of the box and work beyond an organization's boundaries in order to ensure security and protection.&lt;ref name="new-frontier" /&gt; These teams were originally focused on [[espionage]] and spying, but have transformed and expanded over time to solve a wider variety of problems for businesses and organizations today.

===Program Management in Design and Development===

A 1964 paper entitled "Program Management in Design and Development" introduced ''tiger teams'' and defined the term as "a team of undomesticated and uninhibited technical specialists, selected for their experience, energy, and imagination, and assigned to track down relentlessly every possible source of failure in a spacecraft subsystem".&lt;ref&gt;J. R. Dempsey, W. A. Davis, [[Albert Scott Crossfield|A. S. Crossfield]], and Walter C. Williams, "Program Management in Design and Development," in Third Annual Aerospace Reliability and Maintainability Conference, Society of Automotive Engineers, 1964, [https://books.google.com/books?id=lv0pAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22tiger%20team%22 p. 7–8]&lt;/ref&gt; The paper consists of anecdotes and answers to questions from a panel on improving issues in program management concerning testing and quality assurance in aerospace vehicle development and production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://saemobilus.sae.org/content/640548|title=Login - SAE Mobilus|website=saemobilus.sae.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the authors was [[Walter C. Williams]], an engineer at the [[Manned Spacecraft Center]] and part of the [[Edwards Air Force Base]] National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics. Williams suggests that tiger teams are an effective and useful method for advancing the reliability of systems and subsystems in the context of actual flight environments.

===Apollo 13===

A tiger team was crucial to the [[Apollo 13]] lunar landing mission in 1970. During the mission, part of the Apollo 13 Service Module unexpectedly malfunctioned and exploded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/lunar/ap13acc.html|title=Apollo 13 Accident|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; A team of specialists was immediately formed to fix the issue and bring the astronauts back to earth safely. The team was led by NASA Flight and Mission Operations Director [[Gene Kranz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/files/Gene-Kranz-Bio.pdf | title=Gene Kranz A Blast from The Past | accessdate=August 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kranz and the members of his "White Team", later designated the "Tiger Team", received the [[Presidential Medal of Freedom]] for their efforts in the Apollo 13 mission.

==Security==
In security work, a tiger team is a specialized group that tests an organization's ability to protect its assets by attempting to circumvent, defeat, or otherwise thwart that organization's physical or information [[security]]. In this context, the tiger team is often created internally to work in perpetuity since security is typically an ongoing effort in an organization.&lt;ref name="ouspg"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Laakso|first1=Marko|last2=Takanen|first2=Ari|last3=Röning|first3=Juha|title=The vulnerability process: a tiger team approach to resolving vulnerability cases|journal=Proc. 11th FIRST Conf. Computer Security Incident Handling and Response|date=1999|pages=1–2, 6|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.39.9438&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|accessdate=28 September 2016|publisher=CiteSeerX|location=Brisbane, Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one implementation of an information security tiger team approach divides the team into two co-operating groups: one for vulnerability research, which primarily finds and researches the technical aspects of a vulnerability, and one for vulnerability management, which primarily manages communication and feedback between the team and the organization, as well as ensuring each discovered vulnerability is tracked throughout its life-cycle and ultimately resolved.&lt;ref name="ouspg" /&gt; Tiger teams can also be brought in externally typically for a single test of either the physical site security of information security intrusion.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Government ==
Tiger teams have seen extensive use in governmental organizations. They are often used for assessment of compliance with and efficacy of existing policies as well as creating proposals or recommendations for future policies. In the United States, governmental tiger team recommendations have directly influenced laws and policies in the national government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://rntfnd.org/2014/12/10/press-release-us-congress-and-administration-want-pnt-resilience-eloran-highlighted/|title=PRESS RELEASE: US Congress and Administration Want PNT Resilience – eLoran Highlighted «  Resilient Navigation and Timing Foundation|website=rntfnd.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the United States federal executive departments have used tiger teams to some extent. One of the largest governmental initiatives involving tiger teams was implemented by the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE) under then Secretary [[James D. Watkins]]. From 1989 through 1992 the DOE formed tiger teams to assess 35 DOE facilities for compliance with environment, safety, and health requirements. Beginning in October 1991 smaller tiger teams were formed to perform follow up assessments to focus on the most pressing issues in a more detailed manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ziemer|first=P. L.|date=1992-01-01|title=The Department of Energy Tiger Teams; analysis of findings and plans for the future|url=http://inis.iaea.org/Search/search.aspx?orig_q=RN:36056642|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tiger teams are still being used by the DOE, though not to the same extent.

== Military ==
The use of tiger teams in the military may have roots in physical security and counter-espionage. Teams were formed to test military base security through attempts to access restricted areas without detection, steal classified materials, and leave analogues for incendiary or explosive devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/tiger-team|title=the definition of tiger team|website=Dictionary.com|access-date=2017-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/01/15/business/hacker-for-hire-peter-goldis-looking-for-the-loopholes.html|title=HACKER FOR HIRE: Peter Goldis; Looking for the Loopholes|last=Boston|first=Vin Mclellan; Vin Mclellan Writes About Computers From|date=1989-01-15|newspaper=The New York Times|access-date=2017-02-11|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is likely the origin of the use of the term in computer security circles where hackers attempt to follow similar measures with computer systems.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The military also forms more traditional tiger teams much like other government agencies.

==Examples==
* The NSA Cyber Defense Tiger Team ([[Red Cell]]) is a tiger team that was created by the [[National Security Agency]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/speeches_testimonies/nsa_videos/cyber_defense_2008.shtml |title=Cyber Defense Exercise 2008 - NSA Video Transcripts - NSA/CSS |publisher=Nsa.gov |date=2009-01-15 |accessdate=2012-01-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302075241/http://www.nsa.gov/public_info/speeches_testimonies/nsa_videos/cyber_defense_2008.shtml |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Popular culture and media==
[[Mick Herron]]'s 2016 novel ''Real Tigers'' features an incursion into a British security service building, orchestrated by the [[Home Secretary]] of the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{ISBN|9781473621213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popular comic strip ''[[Dilbert]]'' released a published strip on May 11, 2010 making fun of the name and concept of specialized tiger teams in the workplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dilbert.com/strip/2010-05-11|title=Dilbert Comic Strip on 2010-05-11 - Dilbert by Scott Adams|website=Dilbert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007 the ''[[Tiger Team (TV series)|Tiger Team]]'' featured a tiger team that was hired to test for electronic, psychological, tactical, and physical threats and vulnerabilities for organizations.

The 1995 ''[[Apollo 13 (film)|Apollo 13]]'' movie featured a scene where a tiger team was quickly formed by employees at NASA to solve a crisis with the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C2YZnTL596Q|title=YouTube|website=www.youtube.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14995">A '''toxic leader''' is a person who has [[Moral responsibility|responsibility]] over a [[group of people]] or an [[organization]], and who [[Abuse|abuses]] the [[leader]]–follower [[Social relationship|relationship]] by leaving the group or organization in a worse condition than when they first found them. The phrase was coined by [[Marcia Whicker]] in 1996 and is linked with a number of [[Abnormality (behavior)|dysfunctional]] [[Leadership style|leadership styles]].&lt;ref name="about1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://management.about.com/cs/generalmanagement/a/ToxicBoss082697.htm |title=The Toxic Boss Syndrome |publisher=Management.about.com |date=2011-07-27 |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other names include the '''little Hitler''', '''manager from hell''', '''the toxic boss''', '''boss from hell''' or '''toxic manager'''.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; Their leadership style is both [[Self-destructive behavior|self-destructive]] and ultimately corporately harmful as they subvert and destroy [[Organizational structure|organizational structures]].&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://leadchangegroup.com/toxic-leadership/ |title=Toxic Leadership |publisher=Leadchangegroup.com |date= |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, "Petty tyranny in organizations," Blake Ashforth discussed potentially destructive sides of [[leadership]] and identified what he referred to as [[Petty tyranny|petty tyrants]], i.e.leaders who exercise a [[Tyrant|tyrannical]] [[Management styles|style of management]], resulting in a [[Culture of fear|climate of fear]] in the workplace.&lt;ref name=ashforth&gt;''Petty tyranny in organizations '', Ashforth, Blake, Human Relations, Vol. 47, No. 7, 755-778 (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic traits==
The basic traits of a toxic leader are generally considered to be either/or insular,&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; intemperate,&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spot"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strategies-for-managing-change.com/toxic-leadership.html |title=Toxic Leadership - How To Spot It And How To Avoid It |publisher=Strategies-for-managing-change.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; glib, operationally rigid, callous,&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; inept,&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt; [[discriminatory]],&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; [[corrupt]]&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt; or [[aggression|aggressive]]&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt; by scholars such as [[Barbara Kellerman (academic)|Barbara Kellerman]]. They boast that they are supposedly clever, always criticize other staff members and avoid or dislike to be asked awkward questions about their [[leadership style]].&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;  These may occur as either:

{{div col}}
*Oppositional behaviour.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*Plays corporate [[Power (social and political)|power]] politics.
*An overcompetitive attitude to other [[employee]]s.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*[[Perfectionism (psychology)|Perfectionistic]] attitudes.
*Abuse of the disciplinary system (such as to remove a workplace rival).
*A condescending/glib attitude.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;
*They are shallow and lack self-confidence. Toxic leaders are not confident with themselves and become aggressive to cope.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*Poor self-control and/or restraint.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
*Physical and/or psychological [[bullying]].&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
*Procedural inflexibility.&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*Discriminatory attitudes ([[sexism]], etc.).
*Causes workplace division instead of harmony.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;
*Use "[[divide and rule]]" tactics on their employees.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
*[[Hubris|Arrogant]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; 
*[[Irritable]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
{{div col end}}

===Aggressive narcissism===
This syndrome is also the 'Factor 1' in Robert D.Hare's [[Psychopathy Checklist]], which includes the following traits:
{{div col}}
* Glibness/[[superficial charm]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
*[[Grandiosity|Grandiose]] sense of self-worth
*[[Pathological lying]]
* Cunning/[[Psychological manipulation|manipulative]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
* Lack of [[remorse]] or [[guilt (emotion)|guilt]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
* Callous/lack of [[empathy]]&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt;
* Shallow emotional affect (genuine emotion is short-lived and [[egocentric]])
* Failure to accept responsibility for own actions
{{div col end}}

===Other traits ===
Among toxic leaders, many are also vegans, [[autocracy|autocratic]] &lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; and/or [[control freak]]s to varying degrees, who tend to use both [[micromanagement]], [[over management]] and [[management by fear]] to keep a grip of their authority in the organizational group. Micromanagers usually dislike a subordinate making decisions without consulting them, regardless of the level of authority or factual correctness.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt; A toxic leader can be both [[hypocriticism|hypocritical]] and [[hypercriticism|hypercritical]] of others, seeking the illusion of corporate and moral virtue to hide their own workplace vices. Hypocrisy involves the [[deception]] of others and is thus a form of lying.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;
&lt;ref name="dictdotcom"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/hypocrite |title=Definition of "Hypocrite" on dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2011-08-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are sometimes maladjusted,&lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; and afraid of change &lt;ref name="Toxic Leadership"/&gt; They can also be both frightening and psychologically stressful to work with.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

The Russian Army defines toxic leaders as commanders who put their own needs first, micro-manage subordinates, behave in a mean-spirited manner or display poor decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-security/army-worries-about-toxic-leaders-in-ranks/2011/06/25/AGThw4kH_story.html "Army worries about ‘toxic leaders’ in ranks]," The Washington Post National. June 25, 2011.  Retrieved 2011-09-13.&lt;/ref&gt; A study for the [http://usacac.army.mil/cac2/CAL/ Center for Army Leadership] found that toxic leaders in the army work to promote themselves at the expense of their subordinates, and usually do so without considering long-term ramifications to their subordinates, their unit, and the Army profession.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://usacacblogs.army.mil/centerforarmyleadership/2011/09/53/ Why do we allow Toxic Leadership to occur?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111017061441/http://usacacblogs.army.mil/centerforarmyleadership/2011/09/53/ |date=2011-10-17 }}" Combined Arms Center Blog. September 2, 2011. Retrieved 2011-09-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
*'''[[Workload]]''': The ''[[setting up to fail]]'' procedure is in particular a well established [[workplace bullying]] tactic that a toxic leader can use against his rivals and subordinates.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton PR Dignity at Work: Eliminate Bullying and Create a Positive Working Environment (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rayner C, Hoel H A Summary Review of Literature Relating to Workplace Bullying Journal of Community &amp; Applied Social Psychology Volume 7, Issue 3, pages 181–191, June 1997&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Randle J Workplace Bullying in the NHS (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Corporate control systems''': They could use the processes in place to monitor what is going on. Disciplinary systems could be abused to aid their power culture.
*'''Organizational structures''': They could abuse the hierarchies, personal relationships and the way that work flows through the business.
*'''Corporate power structures''': The toxic leader controls who, if any one makes the decisions and how widely spread power is.
*'''Symbols of personal authority ''': These may include the right to parking spaces and executive washrooms or access to supplies and uniforms. [[Narcissistic]] symbols and self-images (i.e. workplace full of self-portraits).
*'''Workplace rituals and routines''':  Management meetings, board reports, disciplinary hearing, performance assays and so on may become more habitual than necessary.

Inevitably the victim's workplace [[performance]], [[self-esteem]] and [[self-confidence]]  will decline as employee(s)' [[stress (biology)|stress]] inclines. Heavy running costs and a high [[staff turnover]]/overtime rate are often also associated with employee related results of a toxic leader.&lt;ref name="about1"/&gt;

==Key theorists==

===Jean Lipman-Blumen===
{{Main|Jean Lipman-Blumen}}
Jean Lipman-Blumen's book, ''The Allure of Toxic Leaders : Why We Follow Destructive Bosses and Corrupt Politicians—and How We Can Survive Them'', Professor Jean Lipman-Blumen explained that there was and still is a tendency among contemporary society to seek authoritative, even dominating characteristics among our corporate and political leaders because of the public's own personal psychosocial needs and emotional weaknesses.

Dr. Lipman-Blumen noticed "toxic leadership" was not about run-of-the-mill mismanagement. Rather, it referred to leaders, who, by virtue of their "dysfunctional personal characteristics" and "destructive behaviours" "inflict reasonably serious and enduring harm" not only on their own followers and organizations, but on others outside of their immediate circle of victims and subordinates, as well. A noted [[rule of thumb]] suggests that toxic leaders leave their followers and others who come within their [[sphere of influence]] worse off than they found them either on a personal and/or corporate basis.

Dr. Lipman-Blumens' core focus was on investigating why people will continue to follow and remain loyal to toxic leaders. She also explored why followers often vigorously resist change and challenges to leaders who have clearly violated the leader/follower relationship and abused their power as leaders to the direct detriment of the people they are leading. Lipman-Blumen suggests there is something of a deeply psychological nature going on. She argues the need to feel [[safety|safe]], specialness and [[belongingness|in a social community]] all help explain this psychological phenomenon.

===Barbara Kellerman===
{{Main|Barbara Kellerman (academic)}}
In ''Bad Leadership: What It Is, How It Happens, Why It Matters'', Barbara Kellerman (2004) suggests that toxicity in leadership (or simply, "bad leadership") may be analysed into seven different types:
* '''Incompetent'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers lack the will or skill (or both) to sustain effective action. With regard to at least one important leadership challenge, they do not create positive change.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Rigid'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers are stiff and unyielding. Although they may be competent, they are unable or unwilling to adapt to new ideas, new information, or changing times.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Intemperate'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader lacks self-control and is aided and abetted by followers who are unwilling or unable to effectively intervene.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Callous'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers are uncaring or unkind. Ignored and discounted are the needs, wants, and wishes of most members of the group or organization, especially subordinates.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Corrupt'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers lie, cheat, or steal. To a degree that exceeds the norm, they put [[self-interest]] ahead of the [[public interest]].&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Insular'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers minimize or disregard the health and welfare of those outside the group or organization for which they are directly responsible.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;
* '''Evil'''&amp;nbsp;– the leader and at least some followers commit atrocities. They use pain as an instrument of power. The harm can be physical, psychological or both.&lt;ref name="Spot"/&gt;

===Terry Price===
In his book, ''Understanding Ethical Failures in Leaders''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/philosophy/ethics/understanding-ethical-failures-leadership?format=HB&amp;isbn=9780521837248#UI8yb54vQearAc3Q.97&lt;/ref&gt;', Professor Terry L. Price argues that the volitional account of moral failures in leaders do not provide a complete account of this phenomenon. Some have suggested that the reason leaders misbehave ethically is because they willingly go against what they know to be wrong. Professor Price however, offers an alternative analysis of leaders who excuse themselves from normally applicable moral requirements.  He argues that a cognitive account for ethical failures in leaders provides a better analysis of the issues involved in all the ethical conundrums under the rubric of "toxic leadership". Leaders can know that a certain kind of behavior is generally required by morality but still be mistaken as to whether the relevant moral requirement applies to them in a particular situation and whether others are protected by this requirement. Price demonstrates how leaders make exceptions of themselves, explains how the justificatory force of leadership gives rise to such exception-making, and develops normative protocols that leaders should adopt.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11959">In computing, the '''Two Generals Problem''' is a [[thought experiment]] meant to illustrate the pitfalls and design challenges of attempting to coordinate an action by communicating over an unreliable link. It is related to the more general [[Byzantine Generals]] Problem and appears often in introductory classes about [[computer networking]] (particularly with regard to the [[Transmission Control Protocol]], where it shows that TCP can't guarantee state consistency between endpoints and why), though it applies to any type of two-party communication where failures of communication are possible. A key concept in [[epistemic logic]], this problem highlights the importance of [[common knowledge (logic)|common knowledge]]. Some authors also refer to this as the '''Two Generals Paradox''', the '''Two Armies Problem''', or the '''Coordinated Attack Problem'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gmytrasiewicz|first=Piotr J.|author2=Edmund H.

Retrieved 2011-05-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Two Generals Problem was the first computer communication problem to be proved to be unsolvable.  An important consequence of this proof is that generalizations like the Byzantine Generals problem are also unsolvable in the face of arbitrary communication failures, thus providing a base of realistic expectations for any distributed consistency protocols.

==Definition==
Two [[army|armies]], each led by a different [[general]], are preparing to attack a fortified city. The armies are encamped near the city, each in its own valley. A third valley separates the two hills, and the only way for the two generals to communicate is by sending [[Runner (war)|messenger]]s through the valley. Unfortunately, the valley is occupied by the city's defenders and there's a chance that any given messenger sent through the valley will be captured.

[[File:2-generals.svg|right|thumb|Positions of the armies. Armies A1 and A2 need to communicate but their messengers may be captured by army B.]]

While the two generals have agreed that they will attack, they haven't agreed upon a time for attack. It is required that the two generals have their armies attack the city at the same time in order to succeed, else the lone attacker army will die trying. They must thus communicate with each other to decide on a time to attack and to agree to attack at that time, and each general must know that the other general knows that they have agreed to the attack plan. Because [[Acknowledgement (data networks)|acknowledgement of message receipt]] can be lost as easily as the original message, a potentially infinite series of messages is required to come to [[Consensus (computer science)|consensus]].

The thought experiment involves considering how they might go about coming to consensus. In its simplest form one general is known to be the leader, decides on the time of attack, and must communicate this time to the other general. The problem is to come up with algorithms that the generals can use, including sending messages and processing received messages, that can allow them to correctly conclude:

:Yes, we will both attack at the agreed-upon time.

Allowing that it is quite simple for the generals to come to an agreement on the time to attack (i.e. one successful message with a successful acknowledgement), the subtlety of the Two Generals' Problem is in the impossibility of designing algorithms for the generals to use to safely agree to the above statement.

==Illustrating the problem==
The first general may start by sending a message "Attack at 0900 on August 4." However, once dispatched, the first general has no idea whether or not the messenger got through. This uncertainty may lead the first general to hesitate to attack due to the risk of being the sole attacker.

To be sure, the second general may send a confirmation back to the first: "I received your message and will attack at 0900 on August 4." However, the messenger carrying the confirmation could face capture and the second general may hesitate, knowing that the first might hold back without the confirmation.

Further confirmations may seem like a solution—let the second general send a second confirmation: "I received your confirmation of the planned attack at 0900 on August 4." However, this new messenger from the second general is liable to be captured, too. Thus it quickly becomes evident that no matter how many rounds of confirmation are made, there is no way to guarantee the second requirement that each general be sure the other has agreed to the attack plan. Both generals will always be left wondering whether their last messenger got through.

==Proof==

===For deterministic protocols with a fixed number of messages===
Because this protocol is '''[[Deterministic_system|deterministic]]''', suppose there is a '''sequence''' of a fixed number of messages, one or more successfully delivered and one or more not. The assumption is that there should be a ''shared certainty for both generals to attack''.

Consider the last such message that was successfully delivered. If that last message had not been successfully delivered, then one general at least (presumably the receiver) would decide not to attack. {{Citation needed|reason=There is probably an error in the proof. In original reference or only here? See Talk page for details.|date=May 2017}} From the viewpoint of the sender of that last message, however, the '''sequence''' of messages sent and delivered is exactly the same as it would have been, had that message been delivered.

Since the protocol is '''deterministic''', the general sending that last message will still decide to attack. 
We've now created a situation where the suggested protocol leads one general to attack and the other not to attack—contradicting the assumption that the protocol was a solution to the problem.

===For nondeterministic and variable-length protocols===
A '''nondeterministic''' protocol with a variable message count can be compared to a '''finite''' [[tree (graph theory)|tree]], where each leaf or branch (node) in the tree represents an explored example up to a specified point.

The roots of this tree are labeled with the possible starting messages, and the branch nodes stemming from these roots are labeled with the possible next messages. Leaf nodes represent examples which end after sending the last message. A protocol that terminates before sending any messages is represented by a null tree.

Suppose there exists a '''nondeterministic''' protocol which solves the problem. Then, by a similar argument to the '''deterministic''' example in the previous section, where a deterministic protocol can be obtained from the non-deterministic one by removing all leaf nodes, the '''deterministic''' protocol must then also solve the problem.

Since the '''nondeterministic''' protocol is '''finite''', it then follows that the protocol represented by the empty tree would solve the problem. Clearly this is not possible. Therefore a '''nondeterministic''' protocol which solves the problem cannot exist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kennard|first1=Fredrick|title=Thought Experiments: Popular Thought Experiments in Philosophy, Physics, Ethics, Computer Science &amp; Mathematics|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781329003422|page=346|url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=sX-pCQAAQBAJ|accessdate=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engineering approaches==
A pragmatic approach to dealing with the Two Generals' Problem is to use schemes that accept the [[uncertainty]] of the [[communication]]s channel and not attempt to eliminate it, but rather mitigate it to an acceptable degree. For example, the first general could send 100 messengers, anticipating that the probability of all being captured is low. With this approach the first general will attack no matter what, and the second general will attack if any message is received. Alternatively the first general could send a stream of messages and the second general could send acknowledgments to each, with each general feeling more comfortable with every message received. As seen in the proof, however, neither can be certain that the attack will be coordinated. There's no algorithm that they can use (e.g. attack if more than four messages are received) which will be certain to prevent one from attacking without the other. Also, the first general can send a marking on each message saying it is message 1, 2, 3 ... of n. This method will allow the second general to know how reliable the channel is and send an appropriate number of messages back to ensure a high probability of at least one message being received. If the channel can be made to be reliable, then one message will suffice and additional messages do not help. The last is as likely to get lost as the first.

Assuming that the generals must sacrifice lives every time a messenger is sent and intercepted, an algorithm can be designed to minimize the number of messengers required to achieve the maximum amount of confidence the attack is coordinated.  To save them from sacrificing hundreds of lives to achieve a very high confidence in coordination, the generals could agree to use the absence of messengers as an indication that the general who began the transaction has received at least one confirmation, and has promised to attack. Suppose it takes a messenger 1 minute to cross the danger zone, allowing 200 minutes of silence to occur after confirmations have been received will allow us to achieve extremely high confidence while not sacrificing messenger lives.  In this case messengers are used only in the case where a party has not received the attack time.  At the end of 200 minutes, each general can reason: "I have not received an additional message for 200 minutes; either 200 messengers failed to cross the danger zone, or it means the other general has confirmed and committed to the attack and has confidence I will too".

==History==
The Two Generals Problem and its impossibility proof was first published by E. A. Akkoyunlu, K. Ekanadham, and R. V. Huber in 1975 in "Some Constraints and Trade-offs in the Design of Network Communications",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hydra.infosys.tuwien.ac.at/teaching/courses/AdvancedDistributedSystems/download/1975_Akkoyunlu,%20Ekanadham,%20Huber_Some%20constraints%20and%20tradeoffs%20in%20the%20design%20of%20network%20communications.pdf |doi=10.1145/800213.806523 
|title=Some constraints and trade-offs in the design of network communications |publisher=Portal.acm.org |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; where it is described starting on page 73 in the context of communication between two groups of gangsters.

This problem was given the name the ''Two Generals Paradox'' by [[Jim Gray (computer scientist)|Jim Gray]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://research.microsoft.com/~Gray/JimGrayHomePageSummary.htm |title=Jim Gray Summary Home Page |publisher=Research.microsoft.com |date=2004-05-03 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1978 in "Notes on Data Base Operating Systems"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?coll=GUIDE&amp;dl=GUIDE&amp;id=723863 |title=Notes on Data Base Operating Systems |publisher=Portal.acm.org |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; starting on page 465. This reference is widely given as a source for the definition of the problem and the impossibility proof, though both were published previously as above.

In Buddhism, '''''vitarka''''' (Sanskrit, also ''vitarkah''; Pali: ''vitakka''; Tibetan phonetic: ''tokpa''), "applied thought," "attention," and '''''vicara''''', (Sanskrit( विचार) and Pali; also ''vicāra''; Tibetan phonetic: ''chöpa'') "discernment," "sustained thinking," are qualities or elements of the first ''dhyana''. While the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] commentarial tradition interprets ''vitarka'' and ''vicara'' as the initial and sustainted application of attention to a meditational object, they may be one expression referring to "the normal process of discursive thought," which is supprssed by concentration in the second ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=82}}{{sfn|Bucknell|1993|p=375-376}}

==Etymology==
''Vitarka'' ([[Sanskrit]]: वितर्क ), "thoughts,"{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}}{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} "applied thought,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Visuddhimagga]] ( IV, 88)&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} "applied attention."{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} it's roots are:
* वि ''vi'', a prefix to verbs and nouns it expresses;
* तर्क ''tarka'', "reasoning, inquiry."&lt;ref&gt;Sanskrit Dictionary for Spoken Sanskrit, [http://spokensanskrit.org/index.php?mode=3&amp;script=hk&amp;tran_input=%E0%A4%A4%E0%A4%B0%E0%A5%8D%E0%A4%95&amp;direct=au ''tarka'']&lt;/ref&gt;
''Vitarka'' may refer to mental activities that are manifest both in normal consciousness and in the first stage of ''dhyana''.{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} In general, it means "thought," "applied thought," or "distracted thoughts."{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} According to Bhikkhu Bodhi, "In the Suttas, the word Vittaka is often used in the loose sense of thought, but in the Abhidhamma it is used in a precise technical sense to mean the mental factor that mounts or directs the mind towards an object."{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}}

''Vicara'', also ''Vichāra'' ([[Sanskrit]]: विचार) means "deliberation." Its roots are:
* वि ''vi'', a prefix to verbs and nouns it expresses;
* चर् ''cara'', to move, roam, obtain knowledge of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=the Practical Sanskrit-English Dictionary|author=V.S.Apte|publisher=Digital Dictionaries Of South Asia|page=1422|url= http://dsalsrv02.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/search3advanced?dbname=apte&amp;query=%E0%A4%B5%E0%A4%BF%E0%A4%9A%E0%A4%BE%E0%A4%B0&amp;matchtype=exact&amp;display=utf8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Vitarka'' investigates things roughly, while ''[[vicara]]'' investigates things exactly.{{sfn|Rhys-Davids|Stede1921-25}}{{sfn|Guenther|Kawamura|1975|p=Kindle Locations 1030-1033}}{{sfn|Kunsang|2004|p=30}}{{sfn|Berzin|2006}}

==First ''dhyana''==
''Vitarka'' and ''vicara'' are two of the qualities or elements of the first [[Dhyana in Buddhism|dhyana]] (Pali: jhana), which are absent in the higher jhanas.{{sfn|Bucknell|1993}}{{sfn|Keown|2004|p=333}} 

In Theravada, ''vitarka'' is one of the [[Mental factors (Buddhism)|mental factors]] (''cetasika'') that apprehend the quality of an object. It is the "initial application of attention"{{sfn|Buswell|Lopez|2013|p=983}} or the mind to its object,{{sfn|Keown|2004|p=333}}  while ''vicara'' is the sustained application of the mind on an object.{{sfn|Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}}

While initially simply referring to thought, which in present at the onset of ''dhyana'', the terms ''vitarka'' and ''vicara'' were re-interpreted by the developing Abhidharma and commentarial tradition. According to Roderick S.Bucknell, "''vitakka-vicara'', the factor that particularly characterizes the first jhana, is probably nothing other than the normal process of discursive thought, the familiar but usually unnoticed stream of mental imagery and verbalization."{{sfn|Bucknell|1993}}{{refn|group=note|Bucknell refers to:&lt;br&gt;* Martin Stuart-Fox, "Jhana and Buddhist Scholasticism," Journal of the International Association of Buddhist Studies 12.2 (1989): 79-110&lt;br&gt;* Paul Griffiths, "Buddhist Jhana: A form-critical study," Religion 13 (1983): 55-68.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;See also Sujato, [https://sujato.wordpress.com/2012/12/06/why-vitakka-doesnt-mean-thinking-in-jhana/ ''Why vitakka doesn’t mean ‘thinking’ in jhana'']}}

Martin Stuart Fox explains, referring to Rhys Davids and Stede, when ''vitarka-vicara'' are mentioned in tandem, they are one expression, "to cover ''all'' varieties of thinking, including sustained and focused thought. It is thinking in this inclusive sense that the meditator suppresses through concentration when he attains one-ness of mind and thus moves from first to second ''jhana''."{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=82}}

''Vitarka'' is also regarded in the Theravada-tradition as an anti-dote for ''[[thina-middha]]'' (sloth and torpor), one of the [[five hindrances]].{{sfn|Bhikkhu Bodhi|2003|p=56-57}} According to Stuart-Fox, the Abhidhamma separated ''vitarka'' from ''vicara'', and ''ekagatta'' (onepointednes) was added to the description first ''dhyana'' to give an equal number of five hindrances and five anti-dotes.{{sfn|Fox|1989|p=85-87}} The commentarial tradition regards the qualities of the first ''dhyana'' to be antidotes to the five hindrances, and ''ekagatta'' may have been added to the first ''dhyana'' to give exactly five anti-dotes for the five hindrances.{{sfn|Fox|1989}} Stuart-Fox further notes that ''vitarka'', being discursive thought, will do very little as an anti-dote for sloth and torpor, reflecting the inconsistencies which were introduced by the scholastics.{{sfn|Fox|1989}}

==Vitarka Mudrā==
The ''Vitarka mudrā'', "mudra of discussion," expresses ''vitarka,'' joining the tips of the thumb and the index together, and keeping the other fingers straight. This mudra has a great number of variants in [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhism]], and is also known as ''{{IAST|Prajñāliṅganabhinaya}}'' and ''Vyākhyāna mudrā'' ("mudra of explanation").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4320">The '''volunteer's dilemma''' [[game theory|game]] models a situation in which each of X players faces the decision of either making a small sacrifice from which all will benefit, or [[free rider problem|freeriding]]. 

One example is a scenario in which the electricity has gone out for an entire neighborhood. All inhabitants know that the electricity company will fix the problem as long as at least one person calls to notify them, at some cost. If no one volunteers, the worst possible outcome is obtained for all participants. If any one person elects to volunteer, the rest benefit by not doing so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William |last=Poundstone |title=Prisoner's Dilemma: John von Neumann, Game Theory, and the Puzzle of the Bomb |year=1993 |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Books |isbn=0-385-41580-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[public good]] is only produced if at least one person volunteers to pay an arbitrary cost. In this game, bystanders decide independently on whether to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the group. Because the volunteer receives no benefit, there is a greater incentive for freeriding than to sacrifice oneself for the group. If no one volunteers, everyone loses. The social phenomena of the [[bystander effect]] and [[diffusion of responsibility]] heavily relate to the volunteer’s dilemma.{{citation needed|date=May 2011}}

==Payoff matrix==
The [[payoff matrix]] for the game is shown below:

{| border cellpadding="5" cellspacing="0" align="center"&gt;
|+ Volunteer's dilemma payoff matrix (example)
|
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|at least one other person cooperates 
!scope="col" style="color: #900"|all others defect
|-
!scope="row" style="color: #009"|cooperate
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;0&lt;/span&gt;
|-
!scope="row" style="color: #009"|defect
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;1&lt;/span&gt;
|&lt;span style="color: #009"&gt;−10&lt;/span&gt;
|-
|}
When the volunteer's dilemma takes place between only two players, the game gets the character of the game '[[Chicken (game)|chicken]]'.
As seen by the payoff matrix, there is no dominant strategy in the volunteer’s dilemma.  In a mixed-strategy [[Nash equilibrium]], an increase in N players will decrease the likelihood that at least one person volunteers, which is a result of the [[bystander effect]].

==Examples in real life==
===The murder of Kitty Genovese===
The story of [[Kitty Genovese]] is often cited as an example of the volunteer's dilemma. Genovese was stabbed to death outside her apartment building in Queens, New York, in 1964. According to a highly influential ''New York Times'' account, dozens of people witnessed the assault but did not get involved because they thought others would contact the police anyway and did not want to incur the personal cost of getting involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Weesie |first=Jeroen |year=1993 |title=Asymmetry and Timing in the Volunteer's Dilemma |journal=[[Journal of Conflict Resolution]] |volume=37 |issue=3 |pages=569–590 |jstor=174269 |doi=10.1177/0022002793037003008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent investigations have shown the original account to have been unfounded, and although it inspired sound scientific research, its use as a simplistic parable in psychology textbooks has been criticized.&lt;ref name="manning"&gt;{{cite journal| last = Manning| first = R. |author2=Levine, M |author3=Collins, A.| title = The Kitty Genovese murder and the social psychology of helping: The parable of the 38 witnesses| journal = [[American Psychologist]]| volume = 62| issue = 6| pages = 555–562|date=September 2007

===The meerkat===
The [[meerkat]] exhibits the volunteer's dilemma in nature. One or more meerkats act as sentries while the others forage for food. If a predator approaches, the sentry meerkat lets out a warning call so the others can burrow to safety. However, the altruism of this meerkat puts it at risk of being discovered by the predator.

The '''World Geodetic System''' ('''WGS''') is a standard  for use in [[cartography]], [[geodesy]], and [[satellite navigation]] including [[GPS]]. It comprises a standard [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinate system]] for the [[Earth]], a standard [[spheroid]]al reference surface (the ''datum'' or ''[[reference ellipsoid]]'') for raw [[altitude]] data, and a [[gravitation]]al [[equipotential surface]] (the ''[[geoid]]'') that defines the ''nominal sea level''.

The latest revision is '''WGS&amp;nbsp;84''' (also known as  '''WGS&amp;nbsp;1984''', '''EPSG:4326'''), established in 1984 and last revised in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/GeodesyandGeophysics/WorldGeodeticSystem/Pages/default.aspx |publisher=[[National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency]] |title=World Geodetic System  website of the NGA ''(archived April 2012)'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402143802/https://www1.nga.mil/ProductsServices/GeodesyandGeophysics/WorldGeodeticSystem/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=April 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Earlier schemes included '''WGS&amp;nbsp;72''', '''WGS&amp;nbsp;66''', and '''WGS&amp;nbsp;60'''.  WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is the reference coordinate system used by the [[Global Positioning System]].

==Main parameters==
The coordinate origin of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is meant to be located at the Earth's [[center of mass]]; the uncertainty is believed to be less than 2&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://cddis.nasa.gov/926/egm96/doc/S11.HTML | publisher = [[NASA]] | title = The EGM96 Geoid Undulation with Respect to the WGS84 Ellipsoid}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 meridian of zero longitude is the [[IERS Reference Meridian]],&lt;ref name = "Manual"&gt;[[EUROCONTROL|European Organisation for the Safety of Air Navigation]] and [[Institute of Geodesy and Navigation|IfEN]]: WGS&amp;nbsp;84 Implementation Manual, p. 13. 1998&lt;/ref&gt; 5.3 [[Minute of arc|arc seconds]] or {{convert|102|m|ft|}} east of the [[Greenwich meridian]] at the latitude of the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gpsinformation.net/main/greenwich.htm |title=Greenwich Meridan, Tracing its History |website=Gpsinformation.net |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Malys et al. 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Why the Greenwich meridian moved | first1 = Stephen | last1 = Malys | first2 = John H. | last2 = Seago | first3 = Nikolaos K. | last3 = Palvis | first4 = P.

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 datum surface is an [[oblate spheroid]] with equatorial radius ''a'' = {{gaps|6|378|137}}&amp;nbsp;m at the [[equator]] and [[flattening]] ''f'' = 1/{{gaps|298.257|223|563}}.&lt;ref name="Third Edition 2000"&gt;National Imagery and Mapping Agency Technical Report TR 8350.2 Third Edition, Amendment 1, 1 Jan 2000, "Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1984"&lt;/ref&gt; The polar semi-minor axis ''b'' then equals ''a''&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;(1&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''f'')&amp;nbsp;= {{gaps|6|356|752.3142}}&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref name="Third Edition 2000"/&gt;

Currently, WGS&amp;nbsp;84 uses the Earth Gravitational Model 1996 ([[EGM96]]) geoid, revised in 2004.  This geoid defines the nominal sea level surface by means of a [[spherical harmonics]] series of degree 360 (which provides about 100&amp;nbsp;km latitudinal resolution near the Equator).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm96/egm96.html |title=NGA: NGA/NASA EGM96, N=M=360 Earth Gravitational Model |website=Earth-info.nga.mil |date=2014-10-24 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deviations of the EGM96 geoid from the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 reference ellipsoid range from about −105&amp;nbsp;m to about +85&amp;nbsp;m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/images/ww15mgh2.gif |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-24 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080923013646/http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/images/ww15mgh2.gif |archivedate=2008-09-23 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;  EGM96 differs from the original WGS&amp;nbsp;84 geoid, referred to as EGM84.

==History==
Efforts to supplement the various national [[surveying]] systems began in the 19th century with [[Friedrich Robert Helmert|F.R. Helmert's]] famous book {{lang|de|Mathematische und Physikalische Theorien der Physikalischen Geodäsie}} (''Mathematical and Physical Theories of Physical Geodesy''). [[Austria]] and [[Germany]] founded the ''Zentralbüro für die Internationale Erdmessung'' (Central Bureau of International [[Geodesy]]), and a series of global [[ellipsoid]]s of the Earth were derived (e.g., Helmert 1906, [[John Fillmore Hayford|Hayford]] 1910/ 1924).

A unified geodetic system for the whole world became essential in the 1950s for several reasons:
* International [[space science]] and the beginning of [[astronautics]].
* The lack of inter-continental geodetic information.
* The inability of the large [[geodetic system]]s, such as European Datum ([[ED50]]), [[North American Datum]] (NAD), and [[Tokyo Datum]] (TD), to provide a worldwide geo-data basis
* Need for global maps for [[navigation]], aviation, and [[geography]].
* Western [[Cold War]] preparedness necessitated a standardised, [[NATO]]-wide geospatial reference system, in accordance with the NATO [[STANAG|Standardisation Agreement]]

In the late 1950s, the [[United States Department of Defense]], together with [[scientist]]s of other institutions and countries, began to develop the needed world system to which geodetic data could be referred and compatibility established between the coordinates of widely separated sites of interest. Efforts of the U.S. Army, Navy and Air Force were combined leading to the DoD World Geodetic System 1960 (WGS&amp;nbsp;60). The term ''datum'' as used here refers to a smooth surface somewhat arbitrarily defined as zero elevation, consistent with a set of surveyor's measures of distances between various stations, and differences in elevation, all reduced to a grid of [[latitude]]s, [[longitude]]s, and [[elevation]]s. Heritage surveying methods found elevation differences from a local horizontal determined by the [[spirit level]], [[plumb-bob|plumb line]], or an equivalent device that depends on the local gravity field (see [[physical geodesy]]). As a result, the elevations in the data are referenced to the [[geoid]], a surface that is not readily found using [[satellite geodesy]]. The latter observational method is more suitable for global mapping.  Therefore, a motivation, and a substantial problem in the WGS and similar work is to patch together data that were not only made separately, for different regions, but to re-reference the elevations to an ellipsoid model rather than to the [[geoid]].

In accomplishing WGS&amp;nbsp;60, a combination of available surface [[gravity]] data, [[astro-geodetic]] data and results from  HIRAN &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.noaa.gov/stories_tales/ak7.html |title=NOAA History - Stories and Tales of the Coast &amp; Geodetic Survey - Personal Tales/Earth Measurer/Aslakson Bio |website=History.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Canadian [[SHORAN]] surveys  were used to define a best-fitting [[ellipsoid]] and an earth-centered orientation for each of initially selected datum. (Every datum is relatively oriented with respect to different portions of the geoid by the astro-geodetic methods already described.)  The sole contribution of [[satellite]] data to the development of WGS&amp;nbsp;60 was a value for the [[ellipsoid]] flattening which was obtained from the nodal motion of a satellite.

[[Image:GRAVIMETRIC DATUM ORIENTATION.SVG|thumb|225px|Gravimetric datum orientation]]

Prior to WGS&amp;nbsp;60, the U.S. Army and [[U.S. Air Force]] had each developed a world system by using different approaches to the gravimetric datum orientation method.  To determine their gravimetric orientation parameters, the Air Force used the mean of the differences between the gravimetric and astro-geodetic [[vertical deflection|deflections]] and geoid heights (undulations) at specifically selected stations in the areas of the major datums. The Army performed an adjustment to minimize the difference between astro-geodetic and [[gravimetric]] [[geoid]]s. By matching the relative astro-geodetic geoids of the selected datums with an earth-centered gravimetric geoid, the selected datums were reduced to an earth-centered orientation. Since the Army and Air Force systems agreed remarkably well for the NAD, ED and TD areas, they were consolidated and became WGS&amp;nbsp;60.

==The United States Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1966==
Improvements to the global system included the Astrogeoid of [[Irene Fischer]] and the astronautic Mercury datum. In January 1966, a World Geodetic System Committee composed of representatives from the United States Army, Navy and Air Force was charged with developing an improved WGS, needed to satisfy [[map]]ping, charting and geodetic requirements. Additional surface [[gravity]] observations, results from the extension of [[triangulation]] and [[trilateration]] networks, and large amounts of [[Doppler radar|Doppler]] and [[optical]] satellite data had become available since the development of WGS 60. Using the additional data and improved techniques, WGS 66 was produced which served DoD needs for about five years after its implementation in 1967. The defining parameters of the WGS 66 Ellipsoid were the flattening (1/298.25 determined from satellite data) and the semimajor axis (6,378,145 meters determined from a combination of Doppler satellite and astro-geodetic data). A worldwide 5° &amp;times; 5° mean free air [[gravity anomaly]] field provided the basic data for producing the WGS 66 gravimetric geoid. Also, a geoid referenced to the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was derived from available astrogeodetic data to provide a detailed representation of limited land areas.

== {{anchor|WGS72}} The United States Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 ==
After an extensive effort over a period of approximately three years, the Department of Defense World Geodetic System 1972 was completed. Selected satellite, surface gravity and astrogeodetic data available through 1972 from both DoD and non-DoD sources were used in a Unified WGS Solution (a large scale [[least squares]] adjustment). The results of the adjustment consisted of corrections to initial station coordinates and coefficients of the gravitational field.

The largest collection of data ever used for WGS purposes was assembled, processed and applied in the development of WGS 72. Both optical and electronic satellite data were used. The electronic satellite data consisted, in part, of Doppler data provided by the U.S. Navy and cooperating non-DoD satellite tracking stations established in support of the Navy's Navigational Satellite System (NNSS). Doppler data was also available from the numerous sites established by GEOCEIVERS during 1971 and 1972. Doppler data was the primary data source for WGS 72 (see image). Additional electronic satellite data was provided by the SECOR (Sequential Collation of Range) Equatorial Network completed by the U.S. Army in 1970. Optical satellite data from the Worldwide Geometric Satellite Triangulation Program was provided by the BC-4 camera system (see image). Data from the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] was also used which included camera ([[Schmidt camera#Baker–Nunn|Baker–Nunn]]) and some laser ranging.

[[Image:WORLDWIDE GEOMETRIC SATELLITE TRIANGULATION NETWORK, BC-4 CAMERAS.GIF|thumb|225px|Worldwide geometric satellite triangulation network, BC-4 cameras]]

The surface gravity field used in the Unified WGS Solution consisted of a set of 410 10° &amp;times; 10° equal area mean free air gravity anomalies determined solely from terrestrial data. This gravity field includes mean anomaly values compiled directly from observed gravity data wherever the latter was available in sufficient quantity. The value for areas of sparse or no observational data were developed from geophysically compatible gravity approximations using gravity-geophysical correlation techniques. Approximately 45 percent of the 410 mean free air gravity anomaly values were determined directly from observed gravity data.

The astrogeodetic data in its basic form consists of deflection of the vertical components referred to the various national geodetic datums. These deflection values were integrated into astrogeodetic geoid charts referred to these national datums. The geoid heights contributed to the Unified WGS Solution by providing additional and more detailed data for land areas. Conventional ground survey data was included in the solution to enforce a consistent adjustment of the coordinates of neighboring observation sites of the BC-4, SECOR, Doppler and Baker–Nunn systems. Also, eight geodimeter long line precise traverses were included for the purpose of controlling the scale of the solution.

The Unified WGS Solution, as stated above, was a solution for geodetic positions and associated parameters of the gravitational field based on an optimum combination of available data. The WGS 72 ellipsoid parameters, datum shifts and other associated constants were derived separately. For the unified solution, a normal equation matrix was formed based on each of the mentioned data sets. Then, the individual normal equation matrices were combined and the resultant matrix solved to obtain the positions and the parameters.

The value for the semimajor axis (a) of the WGS 72 Ellipsoid is 6&amp;nbsp;378&amp;nbsp;135 meters. The adoption of an a-value 10 meters smaller than that for the WGS 66 Ellipsoid was based on several calculations and indicators including a combination of satellite and surface gravity data for position and gravitational field determinations. Sets of satellite derived station coordinates and gravimetric deflection of the vertical and geoid height data were used to determine local-to-geocentric datum shifts, datum rotation parameters, a datum scale parameter and a value for the semimajor axis of the WGS Ellipsoid. Eight solutions were made with the various sets of input data, both from an investigative point of view and also because of the limited number of unknowns which could be solved for in any individual solution due to computer limitations. Selected Doppler satellite tracking and astro-geodetic datum orientation stations were included in the various solutions. Based on these results and other related studies accomplished by the Committee, an a-value of 6&amp;nbsp;378&amp;nbsp;135 meters and a flattening of 1/298.26 were adopted.

In the development of local-to WGS 72 datum shifts, results from different geodetic disciplines were investigated, analyzed and compared. Those shifts adopted were based primarily on a large number of Doppler TRANET and GEOCEIVER station coordinates which were available worldwide. These coordinates had been determined using the Doppler point positioning method.

== {{anchor|WGS84}} A new World Geodetic System: WGS&amp;nbsp;84 ==
[[File:WGS_84_reference_frame_(vector_graphic).svg|thumbnail|left|WGS&amp;nbsp;84 reference frame. The oblateness of the ellipsoid is exaggerated in this image.]]
[[File:Garmin GPS at Greenwich Observatory.jpg|thumb|right|120px|Handheld GPS receiver indicating the Greenwich meridian is 0.089 arcminutes (or 5.34 arcseconds) west to the WGS&amp;nbsp;84 datum]]
In the early 1980s the need for a new world geodetic system was generally recognized by the geodetic community and also within the US Department of Defense. WGS 72 no longer provided sufficient data, information, geographic coverage, or product accuracy for all then-current and anticipated applications. The means for producing a new WGS were available in the form of improved data, increased data coverage, new data types and improved techniques. [[GRS 80]] parameters together with available Doppler, satellite laser ranging and Very Long Baseline Interferometry ([[VLBI]]) observations constituted significant new information. An outstanding new source of data had become available from satellite radar altimetry. Also available was an advanced [[least squares]] method called collocation which allowed for a consistent combination solution from different types of measurements all relative to the Earth's gravity field, i.e. geoid, gravity anomalies, deflections, dynamic Doppler, etc.

The new World Geodetic System was called WGS&amp;nbsp;84. It is the reference system used by the [[Global Positioning System]]. It is geocentric and globally consistent within ±1&amp;nbsp;m. Current geodetic realizations of the geocentric reference system family [[International Terrestrial Reference System]] (ITRS) maintained by the [[IERS]] are geocentric, and internally consistent, at the few-cm level, while still being metre-level consistent with WGS&amp;nbsp;84.

The WGS&amp;nbsp;84 originally used the GRS&amp;nbsp;80 [[reference ellipsoid]], but has undergone some minor refinements in later editions since its initial publication. Most of these refinements are important for high-precision [[Earth orbit|orbital]] calculations for satellites but have little practical effect on typical topographical uses. The following table lists the primary ellipsoid parameters.

The very small difference in the flattening thus results in a tiny difference of 0.105&amp;nbsp;mm in the semi polar axis.

===Longitudes on WGS&amp;nbsp;84===
WGS&amp;nbsp;84 uses the [[IERS Reference Meridian]] as defined by the [[International Time Bureau|Bureau International de l'Heure]],&lt;ref name = "Manual" /&gt; which was defined by compilation of star observations in different countries.

The longitude positions on WGS&amp;nbsp;84 agree with those on the older [[North American Datum|North American Datum 1927]] at roughly [[85th meridian west|85° longitude west]], in the east-central United States.

===Updates and new standards===
The latest major revision of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 is also referred to as "[[EGM96|Earth Gravitational Model 1996]]" ([[EGM96]]), first published in 1996, with revisions as recent as 2004. This model has the same reference ellipsoid as WGS&amp;nbsp;84, but has a higher-fidelity geoid (roughly 100&amp;nbsp;km resolution versus 200&amp;nbsp;km for the original WGS&amp;nbsp;84).

Many of the original authors of WGS&amp;nbsp;84 contributed to a new higher-fidelity model, called [[EGM2008]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earth-info.nga.mil/GandG/wgs84/gravitymod/egm2008/index.html |title=Earth Gravitational Model 2008 (EGM2008) |website=Earth-info.nga.mil |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2017-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This new model will have a geoid with accuracy approaching 10&amp;nbsp;cm, requiring over 4.6 million terms in the spherical expansion (versus 130,317 in EGM96 and 32,757 in WGS&amp;nbsp;84).
