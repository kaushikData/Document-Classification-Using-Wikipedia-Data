[[File:Kyiv Ukraine 'Antimaidan' 14.12.2013 002.JPG|thumb|180px|Anti-Maidan in Kiev, 14 December 2013]]

The '''anti-Maidan''' ({{lang-ru|Антимайдан}}) refers to a number of demonstrations in [[Ukraine]] first directed against the [[Euromaidan]] and later the new Ukrainian government. The initial participants were in favor of supporting the cabinet of the [[second Azarov government]], [[President of Ukraine|President]] [[Viktor Yanukovych]], and [[Russophilia|closer ties]] with [[Russia]]. After the [[2014 Ukrainian coup|overthrow of Yanukovych]], anti-Maidan became divided into various other groups, which partially overlapped. These ranged from people protesting against social ills, to supporters of a federalization of Ukraine, to [[pro-Russian]] [[separatists]] and [[nationalists]].&lt;ref&gt;https://blogs.ucl.ac.uk/ssees/2014/05/09/south-eastern-ukraine-extremism-and-the-anti-maidan/&lt;/ref&gt;

A rally and tent camp action in support of President Viktor Yanukovych and at initiative of the [[Party of Regions]] began on 3 December in [[Mariinsky park]] located close by the [[Verkhovna Rada building]] (the parliament).&lt;ref name="PoRtents51213"&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/179397.html Police block part of govt quarter in central Kyiv], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (5 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PorCIU81213/&gt; The Party of Regions's press service reported on Sunday 6 December that over 15,000 people were taking part in a pro-government rally there.&lt;ref name=PorCIU81213/&gt; According to city police, there were some 3,000 people in the park the day before.,&lt;ref name=PorCIU81213&gt;[http://en.interfax.com.ua/news/general/179986.html Several thousand Regions Party activists continue rally in support of Yanukovych], [[Interfax-Ukraine]] (8 December 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; and the press estimated them at 2,000.&lt;ref name="Segodnya on forced Dec 8 rally"/&gt; Police heavily guarded this event from not only anti-government protesters,&lt;ref name="BBC rally Dec 8"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-25290959|title=Ukraine's capital Kiev gripped by huge pro-EU demonstration|work=[[BBC News]]|date=8 December 2013| accessdate=8 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; but also from any journalists and on-lookers.

According to [[Segodnya]], people attending the pro-government Marinsky Park event were hired or obliged to attend, and forced to stay for a pre-determined time. In one incident on 8 December, protesters were held at the rally against their will by armed security.&lt;ref name="Segodnya on forced Dec 8 rally"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.segodnya.ua/ukraine/s-mitinga-partii-regionov-sbegayut-lyudi-ih-lovyat-pravoohraniteli-480943.html|script-title=ru:С митинга Партии регионов сбегают госслужащие, их ловят люди в черном|work=[[Segodnya]]|date=8 December 2013|accessdate=9 December 2013|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=Not seen in any other news outlets AFAIK|date=December 2013}}

Speaking on condition of anonymity to the ''Kyiv Post'', one demonstrator said that participants of the rally are paid [[Ukrainian hryvnia|UAH]]₴300 or more in order to earn money without going to work. She also recalled cases when they were not let outside the rally for the whole day, while inside the camp there was a build up of garbage and dirty toilets on the grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.kyivpost.com/multimedia/photo/regions-rally-333539.html|title=Pro-government protesters: 'We will stay here until EuroMaidan leaves'|publisher=Kyiv Post|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mark MacKinnon]], senior international correspondent for ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', attempted to interview a demonstrator at the ongoing Anti-Maidan, but although was refused the demonstrator indicated to him that she actually supported the Euromaidan protests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.twitter.com/markmackinnon/status/411180793721937920|title=Twitter / markmackinnon: First woman I spoke to at|publisher=Twitter.com|accessdate=15 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In parliament on 13 December Svoboda leader Oleh Tyahnybok said people on the government payroll in medical, education and other sectors (the so-called "byudzhetnye" sectors) were being bullied into coming to a planned pro-government rally that weekend; Speaker of parliament and Party of Regions member [[Volodymyr Vasylyovych Rybak|Volodymyr Rybak]] responded, saying that it is wrong to pressure people and it has to stop.&lt;ref name=KPLIVEd13/&gt;

On 23 December, the pro-government rally ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.kyivpost.com/multimedia/photo/pro-government-and-euromaidan-protesters-on-dec-23-334156.html|author=Anastasia Vlasova|authorlink=Anastasia Vlasova (journalist)|title=Pro-government protest closes as EuroMaidan goes on|newspaper=Kyiv Post|date=23 December 2013|accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Leader of the group, Tatiana Ermakova, expressed outrage at the fact that, according to her, protesters provoked and attacked Berkut troops. "No country in the world would allow such lawlessness which, for the 17th day occurs on the Maidan," she said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.unian.net/news/610185-russkaya-obschina-sevastopolya-provela-aktsiyu-v-podderjku-berkuta.html|script-title=ru:"Русская община Севастополя" провела акцию в поддержку "Беркута": Новости УНИАН|newspaper=UNIAN|date=8 December 2013|accessdate=8 December 2013|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official statement from Russian Community specifically thanked the anti-riot troops for 'protecting us from the fascists', and called the Euromaidan demonstrators "[[Nazis]]" and "[[Banderite]]s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://novoross.info/general/21706-chleny-obschestvennogo-soveta-i-simferopolcy-proveli-akciyu-v-podderzhku-berkuta-foto.html|title=Члены Общественного совета и симферопольцы провели акцию в поддержку "Беркута" (ФОТО) Новоросс.info – Информационный портал|publisher=Novoross.info|date=12 December 2013|accessdate=15 December 2013|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December the leaders of the Russian Bloc and [[Russian Unity]] met with the Consul General of Russia in Crimea, Vyacheslav Svitlychny, and declared the preparation of an ''antimaidan'' to demand the secession of [[Crimean Peninsula|Crimea]] from Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.theinsider.com.ua/politics/52ac634912f5c/ |script-title=uk:У Криму готується сепаратистський Євромайдан?|publisher=[[The Insider (newspaper)|The Insider]]|date=14 December 2013|accessdate=15 December 2013|language=uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 January, a pro-government antimaidan was held in [[Mykolayiv]], with attendees largely described as mostly young men, athletic, and appearing to be ''titushky''. The crowd of 400 spoke out against fascism and held signs promoting the unity of [[All-Russian nation|Ukraine, Belarus, and Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://nikvesti.com/news/politics/49093 |script-title=ru:Участники провластного митинга в Николаеве ожидают штурм ОГА со стороны футбольных фанатов и майдановцев|date=25 January 2013|accessdate=25 January 2013|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 January, a rally took place against the Maidan movement in Simferopol, with 200 attending. Protesters accused journalists of killing people in Kiev.&lt;ref&gt;{{youtube|WgMwhBih498|В Криму думають, що журналісти когось вбивають / #Євромайдан}}&lt;/ref&gt; 1,000 gathered in Donetsk, supported by local Regions supporters, communists, and [[neo-cossack]]s; clashes caused some injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://novosti.dn.ua/details/216964/|script-title=ru:В Донецке митинг в поддержку власти: мужчине разбили голову|date=26 January 2014|accessdate=26 January 2014|language=ru}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 February in Dnipropetrovsk, Communists held a rally in support of merging Ukraine with Russia and Belarus, and called for the imposition of curfews, the closing of banks, and the expulsion of foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;

==Criticism==
Several news outlets have investigated the claims to confirm that by and large, attendees at pro-government rallies did so for financial compensation and not for political reasons, and were not an organic response to the [[Euromaidan]]. "People stand at Euromaidan protesting against the violation of human rights in the state, and they are ready to make sacrifices," said Oleksiy Haran, a political scientist at [[National University of Kyiv-Mohyla Academy|Kyiv Mohyla Academy]] in Kiev. "People at Antimaidan stand for money only. The government uses these hirelings to provoke resistance. They won't be sacrificing anything."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rudenko|first=Olga|title=Protesters: Ukraine paying for pro-government rallies|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2014/02/16/ukraine-government-protests/5435315/|newspaper=USA Today|date=16 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, 42 Antimaidan activists lost their lives in the [[2014 Odessa massacre|2014 Odessa fire]].

{{Operation Condor}}
The '''Argentine Anticommunist Alliance''' ({{lang-es|Alianza Anticomunista Argentina|links=no}}, usually known as '''Triple A''' or '''AAA''') was a [[far-right]] [[death squad]] founded in [[Argentina]] in 1973 and particularly active under [[Isabel Perón]]'s rule (1974–1976). Initially associated with the [[Peronist]] [[far-right politics|right]], the organisation opposed the Peronist [[far-left politics|left]] and other leftist organizations.&lt;!--{{citation needed span|text=Many of its members later became linked to the [[National Reorganization Process|military junta]] led by [[Jorge Rafael Videla]] (1976–1983) and played a prominent role in the "[[Dirty War]]". |date=August 2012}}--&gt; The AAA acted against a wide range of government opponents, not just [[Communism|communists]].

The Triple A allegedly was secretly led by [[José López Rega]], Minister of Social Welfare and personal secretary of [[Juan Perón]]. [[Rodolfo Almirón]], arrested in Spain in 2006, was alleged to be his chief operating officer of the group, and was officially head of López Rega's and Isabel Perón's personal security. He was extradited from Spain in 2006 and prosecuted; he died in jail in June 2009. [[SIDE]] agent [[Anibal Gordon]] was another important member of the Triple A, although he always denied it. He was tried in Argentina in 1985 after the restoration of democracy and convicted in October 1986. Gordon died in prison of [[lung cancer]] the next year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarin.com/diario/1999/10/14/e-05402d.htm "Quién fue Aníbal Gordon?" (Who was Anibal Gordon), ''[[Clarín (Argentine newspaper)|Clarín]],'' 14 October  {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Argentine Judge [[Norberto Oyarbide]] ruled the Triple A had committed "[[crimes against humanity]]," which meant their crimes were exempt from statutes of limitations. Suspects can be prosecuted for actions committed in the 1970s and early 1980s.

==Creation==
The ''Triple A'' was believed to have been organized in 1973 by José López Rega and [[Alberto Villar]], deputy chief of the [[Argentine federal police]], during the brief interim presidency of [[Raúl Lastiri]] in 1973. Reportedly, the movement was conceived at a high-level [[Peronist]] meeting on October 1, 1973, attended by President [[Raúl Lastiri]], Interior Minister [[Benito Llambí]], Social Welfare Minister [[José López Rega]], general secretary of the Presidency [[José Humberto Martiarena]] and various provincial governors.&lt;ref&gt;Manuel Justo Gaggero, [http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/elpais/1-80601-2007-02-19.html “El general en su laberinto”], ''[[Pagina/12]]'', 19 February 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The group has been defined by legal rulings as part of state terrorism, operating under the governments of Lastiri, Perón and Isabel Perón through López Rega resignation and exile in July 1975. Villar and his wife were assassinated in 1974 with a bomb that was planted on his [[cabin cruiser]] in [[Tigre, Buenos Aires|Tigre]] by members of the ''[[Montoneros]]'', a militant, leftist group.

López Rega, a devotee of [[occultism]] and self-styled [[divination|divinator]], became a powerful force in the Peronist movement. He exerted great influence over [[Juan Perón|Perón]], who was elected to the presidency and took office in 1973, and his wife Isabel Martínez de Perón, elected as vice-president, who succeeded to the presidency upon Perón's sudden death on 1 July 1974. To support the paramilitary group, López Rega drew on funds from the Ministry of Social Welfare, which he controlled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/12/20/espana/1166608365.html "Un juez argentino ordena capturar al ex jefe de la 'Triple A', que vive en Valencia" (An Argentine judge ordered the capture of the ex-chief of 'Triple A', who lives in Valencia], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', December 20, 2006 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the members of the Triple A had earlier taken part in the Peronist [[1973 Ezeiza massacre]]. On the day Perón returned from exile, snipers shot and killed numerous (13 at least killed) left-wing Peronists at the mass gathering to welcome his return, leading to the definitive separation between left and right-wing Peronists.

The Spanish Judge [[Baltazar Garzón]]'s investigations, directed at human rights abuses internationally, revealed that [[Italy|Italian]] [[neofascist]] [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] had also worked with the Triple A, and was present at Ezeiza. Delle Chiaie also worked with the [[Chile]]an [[Dirección de Inteligencia Nacional|DINA]] in Chile, and for [[Hugo Banzer]], a [[Bolivia]]n [[dictator]].&lt;ref name="Nizkor"&gt;{{Cite news| title=Las Relaciones secretas entre Pinochet, Franco y la P2 - Conspiración para matar (The Secret Relations between Pinochet, Franco and the P2 - Conspiracy for death) | publisher=[[Equipo Nizkor]] | date=1999-02-04|url=http://www.derechos.org/sorin/doc/p2.html|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1983 ''[[New York Times]]'' article, the group was founded when there were an increasing number of guerrilla attacks by [[left-wing politics|left-wing militant]] groups,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| title = "Ex-Argentine Security Chief Seized" |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/world/ex-argentine-security-chief-seized.html| work=The New York Times| date = 1983-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; which were met by harsh [[Political repression|repression]] of [[political dissident]]s on the part of the [[Military of Argentina|military]], [[paramilitary]] and [[police force]]s. This environment of social unrest was the justification used by the subsequent military junta for its [[Dirty War]] against political opponents. But testimony at the 1985 [[Trial of the Juntas|Juicio a las Juntas]] trial established that by 1976, both the [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]] and the [[Montoneros]] had been dismantled, and the political dissidents had never posed a real threat to the government.{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}

==Victims==
The group first came to national attention on 21 November 1973 in its attempt to murder Argentine [[Argentine Senate|Senator]] [[Hipólito Solari Yrigoyen]] by a [[car bomb]]. The AAA went on to kill 1,122 people, according to an appendix to the 1983 [[CONADEP]] report,&lt;ref name="IPS"&gt;{{Cite news| title = Rights: Argentina Renews Hunt for 'Triple A' Death Squad | publisher = IPS | date = 2007-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; including suspected Montoneros and [[People's Revolutionary Army (Argentina)|ERP]] leftist [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and their sympathizers, but the group expanded its targets to other political opponents, including [[judge]]s, police chiefs, and [[social activist]]s. In total, it is suspected of having killed more than 1500 people.&lt;ref name="Pulsar"&gt;[http://www.agenciapulsar.org/nota.php?id=9290 "Justicia argentina condenó delitos de la Triple A" (Argentine justice condemned crimes of Triple A)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204023507/http://www.agenciapulsar.org/nota.php?id=9290 |date=2007-02-04 }}, ''[[Agencia Pulsar]]'', 27 December 2006, URL accessed on January 4, 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group is strongly suspected in the 1974 assassination of [[Jesuit]] priest [[Carlos Mugica]], a friend of [[Mario Firmenich]], the founder of Montoneros.&lt;ref name="IPS"/&gt; Other people murdered by the organisation include [[Silvio Frondizi]], brother of former president [[Arturo Frondizi]]; [[Julio Troxler]], former-vice director of the police; [[Alfredo Curutchet]], a defense attorney for [[political prisoner]]s; and Hipólito Atilio López, a key union leader of [[Córdoba Province, Argentina|Córdoba]]. The CONADEP commission on [[human rights]] violations documented the Triple A's execution of 19 homicides in 1973, 50 in 1974 and 359 in 1975, while its involvement in several hundred others is also suspected.

The 1986 study by Ignacio Jansen González is often cited; he estimates the group committed 220 [[terrorist]] attacks from July to September 1974, which killed 60 and severely wounded 44; as well as 20 [[kidnap]]pings.&lt;ref&gt;González Jansen, Ignacio (1986), ''La Triple A'', Buenos Aires, Contrapunto. {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Federal judge [[Norberto Oyarbide]], who signed the [[extradition]] order against former leader of the AAA [[Rodolfo Almirón]], ruled in December 2006 that Triple A's crimes qualified as [[human rights violations]] and the "beginning of the systematic process directed by the state apparatus" during the [[dictatorship]].&lt;ref name="Pulsar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EFE"&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2006/12/29/internacional/1167399244.html Prisión para el ex policía argentino Rodolfo Almirón por su pertenencia a la Triple A], ''[[EFE]]'' &amp;mdash; ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', December 29, 2006 &amp;mdash; URL accessed on January 4, 2007 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Death threat]]s caused many of the opposition to leave Argentina. Amongst many well-known and respected people who left are mathematician [[Manuel Sadosky]], artists [[Héctor Alterio]], [[Luis Brandoni]] and [[Nacha Guevara]], politician and entrepreneur [[José Ber Gelbard]], lawyer and politician [[Héctor Sandler]], and actor [[Norman Briski]].&lt;ref name="EKAPDF"&gt;[http://www.eka-partidocarlista.com/almiron.pdf "Rodolfo Almirón, de la Triple A al Montejurra"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070306024855/http://www.eka-partidocarlista.com/almiron.pdf |date=2007-03-06 }}, PDF {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Main assassinations claimed by the AAA:

* Murder of [[Rodolfo David Ortega Peña]] on July 31, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Murder of [[Raúl Laguzzidel]] on September 5, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Murder of [[Alfredo Alberto Pérez Curutchet]] on September 10, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Kidnapping of [[Daniel Banfi]], [[Luis Latrónica]] and [[Guillermo Jabif]] on September 12, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Murder of [[Julio Tomás Troxler]] on September 20, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Murder of [[Domingo Devincenti]] on November 6, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Murders of [[Silvio Frondizi]] and his son-in-law [[Luis Ángel Mendiburu]] on September 27, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Murder of [[Carlos Ernensto Laham]] and [[Pedro Leopoldo Barraza]] on October 13, 1974.&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;
* Murder of Ramon Samaniego on April 12, 1974&lt;ref name="EFE"/&gt;

==Others==
After the fall of López Rega in 1975 and [[Jorge Rafael Videla]]'s [[National Reorganization Process|coup in March 1976]], many Triple A members fled to Spain, where they became involved in murders of Spanish leftists. Fifteen former AAA members (including [[Rodolfo Almirón]]) were involved in the [[Montejurra Incidents|Montejurra 1976 shooting]] of two left-wing [[Carlist]] members at a large annual gathering in Spain. Others implicated in the event were Italian neofascist Stefano Delle Chiaie and [[Jean Pierre Cherid]], former member of the French [[Organisation de l'armée secrète|OAS]] and at the time part of the [[Grupos Antiterroristas de Liberación|GAL]] death squad in Spain.&lt;ref name="EKAPDF"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eka-partidocarlista.com/asesinatos.htm  "MONTEJURRA: LA OPERACIÓN RECONQUISTA Y EL ACTA FUNDACIONAL DE LAS TRAMAS ANTITERRORISTAS.

Former Triple A member [[José María Boccardo]] took part with Cherid and others in the 1978 assassination of [[José Miguel Beñaran Ordeñana|Argala]], the ''[[ETA (separatist group)|ETA]]'' terrorist who, in 1973, was involved in the assassination of [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s Prime minister [[Luis Carrero Blanco]].&lt;ref name="Mundo"&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2003/427/1072098707.html «Yo maté al asesino de Carrero Blanco»], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', 21 December 2003 {{es icon}} ([http://www.wsws.org/articles/2004/jan2004/spai-j15.shtml English account of ''El Mundo'' article])&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|Australian Motoring Enthusiast Party}}
The '''Australian Motorist Party''' (A.M.P.) is an [[List of political parties in Australia|Australian political party]] dedicated to representing motorist and road users, as well pedestrians, throughout [[Australia]]. It was founded by groups of concerned motorists.&lt;ref name="AMP" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ABC News1" /&gt;

== Policies ==
* Safety of drivers and pedestrians
* Issues involving young drivers such as education and training.
* Public transport
* Cost of driving
* Fuel taxes and alternative fuel sources

== History ==
The ''A.M.P.'' was formed in May 2007&lt;ref name="cranky" /&gt; and became an official registered party in 2008.&lt;ref name="ACT Government" /&gt; They ran in each of the three electorate at the [[2008 ACT election]]s and used a bus equipped with a public address system to promote their new political party.&lt;ref name="Canberra Times2" /&gt; None of the candidates won the seats they were running for on election night, but Walford made a speech to A.M.P. president, Geoff Develin, to stay positive. In the [[Australian Capital Territory general election, 2012|2012 ACT Election]]s the party ran candidates in each of the three electorates, most notably in Ginninderra, where Summernauts organiser [[Chic Henry]] contested the seat and secured 6.6% of the vote. The party once again, however failed to have any candidates elected.&lt;ref name="Canberra Times" /&gt;

{{The Protocols}}
'''Britons Publishing Society''', founded in 1923, was an offshoot of [[The Britons]]. According to scholar [[Gisela C. Lebzelter]], [[The Britons]] split because:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
... internal disagreements proved paralysing. Seven members were excluded in November 1923, and three executives members, [[John Henry Clarke|J. H. Clarke]], the famous [[United Kingdom|British]] [[homeopath]], [[R. T. Cooper]] and [[W. A. Peters]], seceded to establish 'The Britons Publishing Society'.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On December 15, 1923 the three executed a memorandum in which they expressed their organizational purpose as follows:

"propagating views in regard to the Jews, the Christian Religion, the Government of the British Isles and the British Empire,
and other matters which, in our opinion from time to time,
it is in the interests of the British Public should be expressed and distributed and to do anything at all which, in our opinion, equips us for this purpose.

The Society to be conducted not for the purpose of making profit"

'''''La dialectique peut-elle casser des briques ?''''', in English, '''''"Can [[Dialectics]] Break Bricks?"''''', is a 1973 [[Situationist International|Situationist]] film produced by the French director [[René Viénet]] which explores the development of [[class conflict]] through revolutionary agitation against a backdrop of graphic kung-fu fighting.

The film uses 1972 [[martial arts film]] ''[[Crush (1972 film)|Crush]]'' by Tu Guangqi, which tells the story of anti-colonialist revolt in Korea during the period of Japanese occupation, for its visuals which has been dubbed over by the filmmakers in an attempt at [[détournement]]. The concept and motivation of this film was to adapt a "spectacular" film into a radical critique of [[cultural hegemony]] and thus into tools of subversive revolutionary ideals.

The Narrative is based upon a conflict between the proletarian and bureaucrats within [[state capitalism]]. The [[proletarians]] enlist their [[dialectics]] and radical subjectivity to fight their oppressors whilst the bureaucrats defend themselves using a combination of co-optation and violence. The film is noted for its humorous approach to this serious subject matter.

The film also contains many praising references to revolutionaries who thought and fought for the realisation of a post-capitalist world, including [[Marx]], [[Mikhail Bakunin|Bakunin]], and [[Wilhelm Reich]], as well as scathing criticism towards the [[French Communist Party]], [[trade unionism]] and [[Maoism]]. Also Subplots dealing with issues of [[gender equality]], [[Social alienation|alienation]], [[Paris Commune]], [[May 1968 in France|May 1968]], and the Situationist themselves are riddled throughout the film.

The '''cash-for-votes scandal''' was an Indian [[political scandal]] allegedly masterminded by then Opposition Party [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] politician [[Sudheendra Kulkarni]]&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-south-asia-15086265 New arrest in Indian cash for votes scandal]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the [[United Progressive Alliance]], the majority-holding parliamentary-party alliance of India led by [[Sonia Gandhi]], allegedly bribed [[Bhartiya Janta Party]] [[Member of Parliament|MPs]] in order to survive a [[confidence vote]] on 22 July 2008. The vote in the [[Lok Sabha]] arose after the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]-led [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] withdrew support from the government, who wanted to pursue an [[Indo-US nuclear deal]].

==Events and allegations==

In 2008, the ''' [[Section 123 Agreement|123 Agreement]]''' signed between the United States of America and the Republic of India is known as the '''U.S.–India Civil Nuclear Agreement''' or '''Indo-US nuclear deal'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Sultan | first = Maria | author2 = Mian Behzad Adil | title = The Henry J. Hyde Act and 123 Agreement: An Assessment | publisher = [[South Asian Strategic Stability Institute]] | place = London | date = September 2008 | url = http://www.sassu.org.uk/pdfs/The%20123%20Agreement%20and%20Hyde%20Act.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110918092523/http://www.sassu.org.uk/pdfs/The%20123%20Agreement%20and%20Hyde%20Act.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 2011-09-18 | format = PDF | accessdate = 21 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The framework for this agreement was a 18 July 2005, joint statement by then Indian Prime Minister Dr. [[Manmohan Singh]] and then U.S. President [[George W. Bush]], under which India agreed to separate its civil and military nuclear facilities and to place all its civil nuclear facilities under [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA) safeguards and, in exchange, the United States agreed to work toward ''full'' civil nuclear cooperation with India.&lt;ref name="WhiteHouse18062005"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2005/07/20050718-6.html |title=Joint Statement Between President George W. Bush and Prime Minister Manmohan Singh |author=Office of the Press Secretary |date=18 June 2005 |work= Home &gt; News &amp; Policies &gt; July 2005  |publisher=The White House |accessdate=21 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]] that was supporting the [[Manmohan Singh|Dr Manmohan Singh]] government, objected to the agreement citing reasons that proposal would see the [[United States of America|United States]] supply nuclear technology to India in return for India agreeing to [[United Nations]] inspections of its nuclear programs and the splitting of the civil and military aspects of those programs. CPI(M) believed that this would cause India to be effectively subservient to the US. The [[Bharatiya Janata Party]] (BJP) also objected, on the grounds that the inspections could impede development of the country's nuclear arms program.

It had been argued by [[Manmohan Singh|Dr. Manmohan Singh]] and his party that the nuclear infrastructure needed to be developed more rapidly because the existing electric generation facilities were incapable of meeting growing demand.&lt;ref name=AFP20080723&gt;{{cite news |title=Indian PM celebrates vote win, says millions will benefit |agency=AFP |date=23 July 2008 |url=http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ipIyoGI9ajOiSEfU3B53Xnp0bkUw |publisher=AFP |accessdate=2011-07-22 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110520152129/http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5ipIyoGI9ajOiSEfU3B53Xnp0bkUw# |archive-date=20 May 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United Progressive Alliance]] (UPA), the governing alliance in India [[Indian general election, 2004|elected in 2004]], faced its first [[confidence vote]] in the [[Lok Sabha]] (the lower house of Parliament) on 22 July 2008 after the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)]]-led [[Left Front (West Bengal)|Left Front]] withdrew support over India approaching the [[IAEA]] for the [[Indo-US nuclear deal]]. The vote was so crucial that the UPA and the opposition parties summoned MPs from their sick beds and even from prison cells to take part in the vote, which was eventually won by the Government.&lt;ref name="itgo"&gt;[http://www.itgo.in/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;issueid=&amp;id=6743&amp;sectionid=5&amp;secid=27&amp;Itemid=1 Second day of trust motion] India Today Group Online&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Indian government survives vote "&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7519860.stm|title=Indian government survives vote |date=22 July 2008|publisher=BBC|accessdate=2008-07-22| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080723001456/http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7519860.stm| archivedate= 23 July 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government's success in the [[2008 Lok Sabha Vote of Confidence|2008 confidence vote]] was marred when three BJP MPs, including [[Ashok Chhaviram Argal|Ashok Argal]], waved bundles of cash which they produced from bags in parliament during the debate, accusing the government of giving it to them in order to buy their support or abstention in the vote. The BJP demanded the resignation of [[Prime Minister of India|Prime Minister]] Manmohan Singh over the allegations and claimed that they had video evidence of the deals being made, while the CPI(M) leader said that "Practically every member of parliament has been approached with offers of money and inducements." The government denied the allegations, pointing out that Argal would have self-incriminated himself by admitting to receiving a bribe. The Speaker, [[Somnath Chatterjee]], asked New Delhi's police chief to investigate.&lt;ref name=AFP20080723/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency=AFP |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/BJP_demands_PMs_resignation_over_cash-for-vote_/articleshow/3265302.cms |title=BJP demands PM's resignation over cash-for-vote scam |newspaper=The Times of India |date=22 July 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090103074622/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/BJP_demands_PMs_resignation_over_cash-for-vote_/articleshow/3265302.cms |archivedate=3 January 2009 |accessdate=2011-07-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A fortnight later, on 2 August, the BJP offered "documentary evidence" to support its allegation that Argal, [[Faggan Singh Kulaste]] and [[Mahaveer Bhagora]] had been bribed. The evidence included transcripts of video recordings and explanatory letters from two of the MPs, all of which was passed to the investigatory committee that had been set up by parliament. The BJP also criticised [[CNN-IBN]], who had recorded the BJP MP's attempt to sting the government but had not broadcast it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulfnews.com/world/India/10234177.html |title=BJP offers new 'evidence' in cash-for-vote scandal |publisher=Al Nisr |work=Gulfnews |date=3 August 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tapes were broadcast on 12 August 2008 after CNN-IBN had made its appearance before the investigating committee. The company had resisted the calls for an earlier broadcast on the grounds of legal opinion that it had not yet attended the committee and that the broadcast might prejudice the investigatory process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://ibnlive.in.com/news/truth-that-stings-cashforvote-tapes-now-in-the-open/70943-3.html?d=1 |title=Truth that stings: Cash-for-vote tapes now in the open |publisher=IBN |date=12 August 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=TOI20080731/&gt;

The parliamentary investigation began on 30 July 2008 and has frequently been referred to as the [[Kishore Chandra Deo]] committee.&lt;ref name=TOI20080731&gt;{{cite news |url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/India/Probe_into_cash-for-vote_scandal_begins/rssarticleshow/3308054.cms |newspaper=The Times of India |title=Probe into cash-for-vote scandal begins |date=31 July 2008 |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The committee reported in December 2008 that it had found no evidence of bribery in the case of [[Rajya Sabha]] members [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]] and [[Ahmad Patel]]. They had been accused of offering the bribes, and Singh was a prominent member of the [[Samajwadi Party]] (SP) which had begun to support the government at the time when the Left Front moved to oppose it. The committee also recommended further investigation into the activities of [[Sanjeev Saxena]], [[Sohail Hindustani]] and [[Sudheendra Kulkarni]]. Saxena was an aide to Amar Singh, Kulkarni had a similar role for the BJP leader, [[L. K. Advani]] and Hindustani was a [[Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha]] activist (although some early reports say that he was a driver). Some committee members distanced themselves from the report's full conclusions but agreed that the additional investigation was needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Parliamentary panel on ‘cash-for-vote' scam recommended further probe |first=Neena |last=Vyas |date=18 March 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article1548877.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report concluded that the video evidence relating to a car at Singh's house was insufficient proof: it was not possible to determine who was in the car and "It does not prove what transpired inside the house. There is nothing to show that money was offered for voting in favour of the motion of confidence or for abstaining from voting."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/parl-panel-exonerates-amar-singh-in-cashforvotes-scam/398692/ |title=Parl panel exonerates Amar Singh in cash-for-votes scam |date=15 December 2008 |work=IndiaExpress.com |publisher=The Indian Express |accessdate=2010-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A police investigation was instigated in January 2009 to look into the issues relating to Saxena, Hindustani and Kulkarni which had been recommended in the report of the parliamentary committee.&lt;ref name=Hindu20110318&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |date=18 March 2011 |title=Probe into cash-for-votes scam nearing completion |first=Devesh K. |last=Pandey |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/tp-newdelhi/article1549063.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography ''Drohkaal ka Pathik'', released in November 2013, former MP [[Pappu Yadav]] alleged that during the July 2008 trust vote, both the Congress and BJP had offered "Rs 40 crore each" to MPs of his Indian Federal Democratic Party, for their support.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pappu-s-memoirs-payoffs-from-upa---nda/1200046/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reports of evidence==

===Revelations by WikiLeaks===
The [[Indian National Congress|Congress Party]] had worked to support the government in the vote and on 17 March 2011 [[WikiLeaks]] claimed&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Cables – 162458: Cash-for-votes ahead of confidence motion |date=17 March 2011 |newspaper=The Hindu |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/the-india-cables/the-cables/article1544916.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; that [[Nachiketa Kapur]], a Congress Party political aide, had boasted to US Embassy officials in July 2008 that his party had funds to bribe MPs in order to obtain a favourable outcome. Kapur claimed that four MPs who were members of [[Rashtriya Lok Dal]] (RLD) had already been paid off. ''[[The Hindu]]'' reported that {{quote|Five days before the Manmohan Singh government faced a crucial vote of confidence on the Indo-U.S. nuclear deal in 2008, a political aide to Congress leader Satish Sharma showed a U.S. Embassy employee "two suitcases containing cash" he said was part of a bigger fund of Rs. 500&amp;nbsp;million ($13 million) to Rs. 600&amp;nbsp;million ($15 million) that the party had assembled to purchase the support of MPs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Satish Sharma aide showed U.S. Embassy employee cash to be used as ‘pay-offs’ in confidence vote |date=17 March 2011 |first=Siddharth |last=Varadarajan |newspaper=The Hindu |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/the-india-cables/article1544204.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Former [[United States Ambassador to India]] [[David Campbell Mulford]] commented that US diplomatic cables were "generally accurate" but that all he could recall of the incident was that someone "turned out with a suitcase of money and dumped it on the table&amp;nbsp;... That was clear theatrics."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Diplomatic-cables-are-generally-accurate-David-Mulford/H1-Article1-675041.aspx |newspaper=Hindustan Times |title=Diplomatic cables are 'generally accurate': David Mulford |date=18 March 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110829154352/http://www.hindustantimes.com/Diplomatic-cables-are-generally-accurate-David-Mulford/H1-Article1-675041.aspx |archivedate=29 August 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In denying any wrongdoing, the RLD pointed out that they only had three MPs at the time, not four as stated in the leaked cable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Ajit Singh: we openly voted against UPA |date=18 March 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1547915.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Satish Sharma]], who was the person for whom Kapur acted as an aide according to the cable, said that he had no aide at all.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Baseless, false allegations: Sharma, Kamal Nath |date=18 March 2011 |agency=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1547922.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revelations led immediately to further calls for the resignation of Manmohan Singh and also for an investigation of the activities of Kapur and Sharma. There were also calls for the issue of a [[First Information Report]] (FIR), which is the formal means by which the police record their notification of an offence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |date=17 March 2011 |title=World has rejected WikiLeaks reports: Congress  |agency=PTI |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article1546538.ece |accessdate=2011-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was announced on the following day, 18 March, that the police investigation into the original allegations was near to completion.&lt;ref name=Hindu20110318/&gt;

===Tehelka expose===
''[[Tehelka]]'', a sometimes controversial publication that specialises in exposés, reported that the entire affair was a BJP set-up designed to entrap members of the government. The report was based on an account given by [[Siddharth Gautam]], a CNN-IBN reporter who had been involved, and on some recordings of telephone conversations that had not previously been made available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Tehelka Magazine |first=Ashish |last=Khetan |url=http://www.tehelka.com/story_main49.asp?filename=Ne020411Gilance.asp |title=Cash-for-Votes Scandal: At A Glance |date=2 April 2011 |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supreme Court involvement==
An application was made to the Supreme Court on 2 April requesting that it ordered a Special Investigation Team to probe the affair. The applicants were a group calling themselves the [[India Rejuvenation Initiative]] and they argued that the investigatory process had stalled since the report of the parliamentary committee. The hearing was adjourned to due a procedural irregularity in the application,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Plea for SIT probe into cash-for-votes scam |first=J. |last=Venkatesan |date=12 April 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article1689621.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and when this was resolved on 2 May the Court issued notices to the Delhi police and government that required them to provide information regarding the current status of the investigation.&lt;ref name=Hindu20110503&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |date=3 May 2011 |title=Court seeks probe status report in cash-for-votes scam |first=J. |last=Venkatesan |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-national/article1986984.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The petitioners said that {{quote|The cash-for-vote incident showed the desperate depths to which certain political functionaries and parties stooped to ensure victory on the floor of the House, and these exposures represent both a gross moral degeneration and crass political opportunism of the government and had degraded and disgraced our sacrosanct traditions of parliamentary democracy,&lt;ref name=Hindu20110503/&gt;}}

On 7 July the Court voiced its frustration with the continued absence of the requested status reports and set a filing deadline of 15 July. The police had requested a further two months to fulfil the request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Court seeks status report on probe into cash-for-vote |first=J. |last=Venkatesan |date=7 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2207070.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon being presented with the status report, the Court criticised the lethargy of the police investigation, complaining that little had been done and that which had been done was poorly documented, inconsistent and in places factually incorrect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Cash-for-vote scam probe shoddy: court |first=J. |last=Venkatesan |date=15 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2229666.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court was similarly disparaging of a second report which followed on from a burst of activity by the police. On 5 August 2011, Justice Loda said {{quote|What are you doing regarding these inferences? It is distressing that middlemen of the cheapest kind tried to manipulate Parliament proceedings. To some extent, they have succeeded. You must find out what is the source of the money. You failed to achieve anything substantial in the case for two years and got activated only after the apex court orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=It's meaningless and inhibited probe, court tells Delhi Polic |first=J. |last=Venkatesan |date=5 August 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2324847.ece |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Arrests==
'''[[Sudheendra Kulkarni]]'''&lt;br&gt;
In September 2011, a former aide of India's top opposition leader LK Advani, Sudheendra Kulkarni, has been arrested in connection with an alleged cash-for-votes scandal. Kulkarni is alleged to have "master-minded" the operation. He says it was to expose corruption in the government. Kulkarni was an aide to senior Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) leader LK Advani at the time of the vote. He told the court that he was "a whistleblower" who intended to expose corruption.  Police allege that Kulkarni approached [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]]'s Samajwadi Party - an ally of the Congress-led government at the time of the vote - to offer bribe to BJP MPs. He then got a television channel to secretly film the alleged bribe giving in order to nail the government, police allege.

'''Sanjeev Saxena'''&lt;br&gt;
Sanjeev Saxena, alleged to be an aide of the then Samajwadi Party general secretary [[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]] was arrested on 17 July, two days after the police had been criticised by the Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Cash-for-votes scam accused Sanjeev Saxena arrested |first=Ashok |last=Kumar |date=17 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2235939.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police claimed to have sufficient evidence to prove that he had delivered money to the three BJP MPs and alleged that he had misled both their inquiry and that of parliament. They also announced that they had interviewed Bhahora and Kulaste, who were no longer MPs, but that their ability to interview Argal was hampered because he was still in office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Saxena delivered Rs. 1 cr. to 3 BJP MPs, say police |first=Jiby |last=Kattakayam |date=19 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article2248775.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They had applied to the [[Ministry of Home Affairs (India)|Home Ministry]] for permission to interview him and Amar Singh, still a member of the Rajya Sabha, and further announced that they intended to re-interview Hindustani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Police seek permission to quiz Amar Singh, Ashok Argal |first=Ashok |last=Kumar |date=19 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2256476.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The developments caused Deo to clarify that his committee had not absolved Singh of any involvement but rather that it had found no evidence to confirm involvement. He also had to explain that the decision not to interview Singh had been because the committee had no ''prima facie'' evidence of Singh's involvement, the summonsing process for a Rajya Sabha member would have been complex, and the outcome may have still been a failure to attend as Singh was not obliged to do so. Furthermore, he stated, the dissenting members of the committee had agreed with its conclusions but had disagreed with his chairmanship. Deo had become a cabinet minister on 12 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=I didn't give Amar Singh a clean chit: K.C.

'''Sohail Hindustani'''&lt;br&gt;
Delhi Police arrested Sohail Hindustani, a Bharatiya Janata Yuva Morcha activist was arrested on 20 July and announced that he would be repeating his previous statements that he had been approached by Singh and some members of the Congress Party who had wanted him to "arrange" BJP votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Sohail Hindustani arrested in cash-for-votes case |first=Ashok |last=Kumar |date=21 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/article2278257.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police described him as the "orchestrator" and explained that he was working for the BJP in an attempt to entrap the government, but his defence counsel has claimed that he was just a "whistleblower" and that as such he should not have been the primary focus of police attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Sohail Hindustani is the orchestrator, say police |first=Jiby |last=Kattakayam |date=21 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2281901.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BJP took a similar line to defence counsel, claiming that the investigation was an "eyewash", querying how police lethargy had turned so quickly and suggesting that they were being put under pressure by the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Cash-for-vote probe an eyewash: BJP |agency=PTI |date=21 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2282103.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Amar Singh'''&lt;br&gt;
[[Amar Singh (politician)|Amar Singh]] was interviewed on 22 July and on the same day the police announced that they wished to speak with SP MP [[Rewati Raman Singh]], whom the BJP MPs alleged had approached them on behalf of Amar Singh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Delhi Police question Amar Singh |date=22 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2284455.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, the Court ordered that Hindustani and Saxena should be detained in custody for 14 days, despite defence arguments of police misconduct. The defence claimed that the police had not interviewed Hindustani and therefore had no new evidence upon which to base their recent claims of orchestration. When the police stated that interviews had taken place the defence counsel responded by noting that they had not been present for any such interviews and that their presence was a legal requirement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Hindustani, Saxena in judicial custody |first=Jiby |last=Kattakayam |date=22 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2284803.ece |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The detentions were subsequently extended to 18 August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Hindustani, Saxena’s judicial custody extended |agency=PTI |date=5 August 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2324959.ece |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Despite Amar Singh having previously fallen out with his party's leadership and being expelled from the party, [[Mulayam Singh]], the leader of the SP, voiced his support for the ex-member on 24 July and claimed that Amar Singh had been framed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Amar Singh was framed in cash-for-vote case: Mulayam |date=24 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2290169.ece |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rewati Raman Singh and Argal were interviewed by police on the following day, with Singh claiming that he gave them the same details as he had previously given to the investigatory committee, and Argal claiming that in fact Singh had approached him in relation to facilitating the alleged bribe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=The Hindu |title=Rewati Raman, Argal quizzed in cash-for-vote scam |agency=PTI |date=25 July 2011 |url=http://www.thehindu.com/news/national/article2292286.ece |accessdate=2011-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kulkarni was interviewed on 14 July.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Hindustan Times |title=Prepared to be quizzed in cash-for-vote sting: Kulkarni |agency=Press Trust of India |date=20 July 2011 |url=http://www.hindustantimes.com/Prepared-to-be-quizzed-in-cash-for-vote-sting-Kulkarni/Article1-723424.aspx |accessdate=2011-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br&gt;
Amar Singh was arrested on 6 September for his alleged involvement in the scam and was ordered to be remanded in custody until 19 September. He had appealed to the court to exempt him from appearing personally, stating that he was ill with an infection; however, his request was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Times of India |title=Amar Singh arrested in cash-for-votes scam |date=6 September 2011 |url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2011-09-06/india/30118009_1_exemption-from-personal-appearance-amar-singh-kidney-transplant |accessdate=2011-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 November 2013, a Delhi court accepted the statements of Amar Singh and three BJP men - Faggan Singh Kulaste, Ashok Argal and Mahabir Singh Bhagora - that their actions had been as whistleblowers. Saxena still stands trial under the Prevention of Corruption Act.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Times of India |title=Amar Singh, three BJP leaders who waved cash in Parliament let off |date=22 November 2013 |url=http://www.ndtv.com/article/india/cash-for-vote-scam-amar-singh-three-bjp-leaders-who-waved-cash-in-parliament-let-off-449523 |accessdate=2013-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Chinese name|[[Zhan (surname)|Chiam]]}}
'''Chiam See Tong''' ({{zh|s=詹时中|zh|t=詹時中|p=Zhān Shí Zhōng|poj=Chiam Sî-tiong}}; born 12 March 1935) is a [[Chinese Singaporeans|Singaporean]] politician and lawyer. He is [[Singapore]]'s longest-serving [[Opposition (parliamentary)|Opposition]] [[Member of Parliament]] (MP) in a [[Constituencies of Singapore#Single Member Constituencies|Single Member Constituency]] (SMC), having represented the constituency of [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency|Potong Pasir]] in [[Parliament of Singapore|Parliament]] from 1984 to 2011.&lt;ref name="channelnewsasia.com"&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1015625/1/.html "New opposition candidate expected in Potong Pasir"]. Zul Othman. ''[[Channel Newsasia]]''. 4 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TST 9 December 2009 pg B6"&gt;The Straits Times (print edition) 9 December 2009, page B6.&lt;/ref&gt; Chiam will however lose his mantle to Low Thia Kiang by the end of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mothership.sg/2017/09/low-thia-khiang-will-be-the-longest-serving-opposition-mp-in-singapores-history-by-end-of-2017/|title=Low Thia Khiang will be the longest-serving opposition MP in Singapore’s history by end of 2017|website=Mothership.sg|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was also Singapore's longeat serving Opposition Leader from 1984 to 2001.

Chiam was founding leader of the [[Singapore Democratic Party]] (SDP) up to December 1996, when he left the party to join the [[Singapore People's Party]] (SPP) prior to the [[Singaporean general election, 1997|1997 general election]]. He subsequently spearheaded the formation of the [[Singapore Democratic Alliance]] (SDA), and was its chairman and ''de facto'' opposition leader from 2001 to 2011. However, in March 2011 he announced that he was withdrawing the SPP from the SDA grouping, and would contest the next general election under the SPP banner. At the [[Singaporean general election, 2011|2011 general election]], Chiam decided not to seek re-election in his Potong Pasir constituency and instead stood as a member of the SPP's team in the [[Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency]]. However the SPP was defeated by the PAP's team in Bishan-Toa Payoh. His wife [[Lina Chiam]] narrowly lost the election in [[Potong Pasir Single Member Constituency|Potong Pasir]] and accepted a seat as a [[Non-constituency Member of Parliament|Non Constituency Member of Parliament]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lina Chiam to take up NCMP offer|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1128423/1/.html|accessdate=15 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==
Chiam first entered politics in 1976 when he contested as an independent candidate in Cairnhill constituency, where he lost to Minister for Communications and National Development [[Lim Kim San]]. In the 1979 by-election, Chiam contested the Potong Pasir seat for the first time, again as an independent, and got 33% of the votes against the [[People Action Party]] (PAP)'s candidate [[Howe Yoon Chong]].&lt;ref name="TST 9 December 2009 pg B6"/&gt;

Chiam founded the [[Singapore Democratic Party]] (SDP) on 6 August 1980, and was the party's Secretary-General (leader) until 1993. He contested the Potong Pasir seat again in 1980 and lost to Howe again, but his vote share increased to 41%. In 1984, Chiam contested the seat against [[Mah Bow Tan]], and won with 60.3% of the votes, on a swing of 19 percent against the PAP.&lt;ref name="TST 9 December 2009 pg B6"/&gt;

In his subsequent five elections, Chiam continued to fend off challengers from the PAP. His winning margin reached a peak of 69.6% in the 1991 polls.&lt;ref name="TST 9 December 2009 pg B6"/&gt;

When Chiam was first elected to Parliament in 1984, he was only the second opposition politician ever to be elected to Singapore's Parliament after [[Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam|J. B. Jeyaretnam]] of the [[Workers' Party of Singapore|Workers' Party]] (WP), in 1981. After Jeyaretnam was expelled from Parliament in 1986, Chiam was Singapore's sole elected opposition MP until 1991.

At the 1991 general elections, two other SDP members, [[Ling How Doong]] and [[Cheo Chai Chen]], were also elected to Parliament. [[Low Thia Khiang]] of the WP was also elected, making a total of four opposition MPs, with Chiam effectively the leader of the opposition.

In 1992, Chiam recruited [[Chee Soon Juan]], a psychology lecturer at the [[National University of Singapore]], to be an SDP candidate for a by-election in the [[Marine Parade Group Representation Constituency]]. Although the SDP was unsuccessful in the by-election, the recruitment of Chee as a candidate generated considerable public interest. However differences between Chiam and Chee soon emerged. Chee was sacked from his job as a university lecturer in 1993, and publicly claimed that he had been the victim of a political vendetta by the governing [[People's Action Party]] (PAP). Chiam wanted to censure Chee for these comments, but the party's Central Executive Committee (CEC) backed Chee. Chiam then resigned as Secretary-General of the party, and was replaced by Chee. The CEC, after convening a disciplinary hearing, voted to expel Chiam from the party after he publicly criticised them. However, Chiam won a court case to prevent them from doing so on procedural grounds. The CEC then appointed Ling How Doong to replace Chiam as the party's parliamentary leader.

Chiam left the SDP in December 1996 and accepted an invitation to join the Singapore People's Party (which was formed by a breakaway faction of the SDP in 1994) and became its leader. Standing for his new party, he was re-elected as MP for Potong Pasir at the 1997 general election.&lt;ref name="TST 9 December 2009 pg B6"/&gt; The negative publicity generated by the disputes with Chiam affected the SDP's electoral prospects, and both Ling and Cheo lost their seats, leaving Chiam and [[Low Thia Khiang]] as the only two elected opposition MPs. Chiam and Low remained the only two opposition MPs elected at all the subsequent general elections until 2011. At the [[Singapore general election, 2001|2001 general election]], Chiam won Potong Pasir for the fifth time. At the [[Singapore general election, 2006|2006 general election]], he won 55.82% of the votes to claim his sixth term, defeating the PAP's [[Sitoh Yih Pin]]. He had secured 8,245 votes against 6,527 for Sitoh. For many, this was a surprise victory for Chiam, as the PAP had offered an S$80 million upgrading package for the residents of Potong Pasir and had brought in then-[[Senior Minister]] [[Goh Chok Tong]] to help the PAP's campaign in the constituency.

In early 2008, Chiam suffered a mild stroke&lt;ref name="TST 9 December 2009 pg B6"/&gt; which led to the suspension of his 'Meet-the-People' sessions. In 2011, Chiam said "there's still remnants of the stroke which I suffered".&lt;ref name="todayonline.com"&gt;

In 2009, Chiam celebrated his 25th year as MP for Potong Pasir.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/Breaking+News/Singapore/Story/STIStory_464376.html |publisher=The Straits Times |date=9 December 2009 |title=Dinner bash for Chiam |accessdate=22 June 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he also announced that he did not plan to stand as a candidate for Potong Pasir at the next general election (due to be held on May 2011), and would instead be a candidate in a [[Group Representation Constituency]] (GRC).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/sweingaporelocalnews/view/1024389/1/.html ''Channel News Asia : Chiam See Tong marks 25 years as opposition MP''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Chiam tried to bring the [[Reform Party (Singapore)|Reform Party]] into the SDA. He reportedly accepted the conditions the Reform Party set out for joining the alliance, however the terms of entry were opposed by other members of the SDA's Council who blocked the move. In 2010 and early-2011, it was also reported that some members of the SDA's Council felt that Chiam was unable to properly fulfil his role of Chairman of the alliance, after he had cut back his political activities following his stroke in 2008. On 28 February 2011, the SDA's Council voted to relieve Chiam of his role as chairman, however the Council stressed that they still hoped to field Chiam as a candidate at the next general election. But two days later, on 2 March 2011, Chiam announced that the Singapore People's Party was withdrawing from the SDA, and that he would stand under the banner of the SPP instead of the SDA at the next general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1113966/1/.html GE: SDA says Chiam pulling SPP out of alliance], channelnewsasia.com, 2 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110303-0000259/Chiam-pulls-party-out-of-alliance Chiam pulls party out of alliance] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110306133237/http://www.todayonline.com/Singapore/EDC110303-0000259/Chiam-pulls-party-out-of-alliance |date=6 March 2011 }}, ''Today'', 3 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Singaporean general election, 2011|2011 general election]], Chiam's wife, Lina Loh Woon Lee (sometimes referred to as [[Lina Chiam]]), the SPP candidate in Potong Pasir. Chiam himself became a candidate in the [[Bishan-Toa Payoh Group Representation Constituency]]. Chiam's team in [[Bishan-Toa Payoh GRC]] finished with 43% of the votes, and was defeated by the PAP team led by then-Deputy Prime Minister [[Wong Kan Seng]]. His wife [[Lina Chiam]] (Lina Loh) failed to retain his old Potong Pasir seat and was defeated by his opponent in the last two elections, the PAP's [[Sitoh Yih Pin]], by a margin of 114 votes (0.72%). A week later, the [[Singapore People's Party]] (SPP) announced that [[Lina Chiam]] would accept an offer to become a [[Non-Constituency Member of Parliament]] as one of the best-performing losing opposition candidates.

In October 2014, 29-year-old Loke Hoe Yeong, the assistant secretary-general of SPP, released the first instalment of a two-part biography of Chiam, ''Let the People Have Him''. Published by [[Epigram Books]], the 232-page book traced Chiam's road to Parliament, and revealed that Chiam's grandfather, Chiam Seng Poh, was a revolutionary who helped [[Sun Yat-sen]] overthrow the [[Qing dynasty]]. In addition, ''Let the People Have Him'' revealed that one of Chiam's maternal aunts, Mabel, married Kwa Soon Siew – a brother of [[Kwa Geok Choo]], the wife of Singapore's first prime minister, [[Lee Kuan Yew]]. The second part of Chiam's biography is expected to be released in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leong|first1=Weng Kam|title=New book traces Chiam's road to Parliament|url=http://news.asiaone.com/news/singapore/new-book-traces-chiams-road-parliament|accessdate=29 October 2014|agency=The Straits Times|publisher=Singapore Press Holdings|date=26 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life outside politics==

{{Main article|Feudal land tenure}}
'''Copyhold''' [[Land tenure|tenure]] was a form of [[Custom (law)|customary]] tenure of [[real property|land]] common in England from the [[Middle Ages]]. The land was held according to the custom of the [[manor]], and the mode of landholding took its name from the fact that the "[[Deed|title deed]]" received by the tenant was a copy of the relevant entry in the [[Manorial roll|manorial court roll]]. A tenant who held land in this way was known as a ''copyholder''.

==Principles==
The privileges granted to each tenant, and the exact services he was to render to the [[lord of the manor]] in return for them, were described in the roll or book kept by the [[Steward (office)|steward]], who gave a copy of the relevant entry to the tenant. Consequently, these tenants were afterwards called copyholders, in contrast to [[Freehold (law)|freeholders]].&lt;ref&gt;Bland, W., ''Enclosure of Commons and Waste Lands, formerly in the townships of Belper, Duffield, Hazelwood, Heage, Holbrooke, Turnditch, and elsewhere in the old Parish of Duffield'', [http://www.jjb.uk.com/enclosure/enclosure.htm#five jjb.uk.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The actual term "copyhold" is first recorded in 1483, and "copyholder" in 1511-12.&lt;ref&gt;{{OED|copyhold, copyholder }} {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific rights and duties of copyholders varied greatly from one manor to another and many were established by custom. Initially, some works and services to the Lord were required of copyholders (4 days' work per year for example), but these were commuted later to a rent equivalent. Each manor custom laid out rights to use various resources of the land such as wood and pasture, and numbers of animals allowed on the common. Copyholds very commonly required the payment of a type of death duty called an [[heriot]] upon the decease of the copyholder; to the Lord of the manor.

==Inheritance==
Two main kinds of copyhold tenure developed:
* Copyhold of Inheritance: with one main tenant landholder who paid [[Renting|rent]] and undertook duties to the Lord. When he died, the holding normally passed to his next heir(s) – who might be the eldest son or, if no son existed, the eldest daughter ([[primogeniture]]); the youngest son or, if no son existed, the youngest daughter ("Borough English" or [[ultimogeniture]]); or all sons or all children in equal or otherwise prescribed shares (partible inheritance or "[[gavelkind]]"), depending upon the custom of that particular manor. In practice, local rules of inheritance were often applied with considerable flexibility. During their life the tenant could usually 'sell' the holding to another person by formally surrendering it to the lord of the manor on the condition that the lord regrant it to the 'buyer'. This three-party transaction was recorded in the [[manorial roll]] and formed the new 'copyhold' for the purchaser.
* Copyhold for Lives: where several (usually three) named persons held the premises for the duration of their lives. The first-named life tenant acted as tenant and paid rent and heriots; while the other two were said to be "in reversion and remainder" and effectively formed a queue. When the first life died, the second-named inherited the property and nominated a new third life for the end of the new queue. These were recorded in the court rolls as the "copyhold" for this type of tenant. It was possible to exchange the reversion and remainder lives with different ones during a lifetime upon payment of a fine to the lord. However, it was not usually possible for these holdings to be sold, as there were [[Pur autre vie|three lives with an entitlement]]. Copyhold for Lives is therefore regarded as a less secure tenancy than Copyhold of Inheritance.&lt;ref&gt;William Blackstone, ''Commentaries on the Laws of England'' (1753), Book 2, Chapter VI "Of the Modern English Tenures"&lt;/ref&gt;

Copyhold land often did not appear in a [[Will and testament|will]]. This is because its inheritance was already pre-determined by custom, as just described. It could not therefore be given or devised in a will to any other person. In some instances, the executor of the estate held the copyhold for the term of one year after the decease of the testator, which was called the "executor's year", in parallel with the same concept in [[common law]]. Language regarding the disposal of the profits of the executor's year or of a heriot often indicates a copyhold.

==Abolition==
Copyholds were gradually enfranchised (turned into ordinary holdings of land &amp;ndash; either [[freehold (real property)|freehold]] or [[999-year lease|999-year]] [[leasehold]]) as a result of the Copyhold Acts during the 19th century. By this time, servitude to the lord of the manor was merely token, discharged on purchasing the copyhold by payment of a "fine in respite of [[fealty]]". The Copyhold Acts of 1841, 1843, 1844, 1852, 1858 and 1887 were consolidated in the Copyhold Act of 1894.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1894/46/pdfs/ukpga_18940046_en.pdf Copyhold Act 1894]&lt;/ref&gt;

Part V of the [[Law of Property Act 1925]] finally extinguished the last of them.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
The status of '''creation and evolution in public education''' has been the subject of substantial [[Creation–evolution controversy|debate]] and [[Social conflict|conflict]] in [[Law|legal]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Religion|religious]] circles. Globally, there is a wide variety of views on the topic. Most western countries have legislation that mandates only [[evolutionary biology]] is to be taught in the appropriate scientific [[syllabus]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/evolution-education-abroad/|title=Evolution Abroad: Creationism Evolves in Science Classrooms around the Globe|last=Harmon|first=Katherine|date=3 March 2011|website=Scientific American|accessdate=12 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
While many doctrines do not raise theological objections to the modern evolutionary synthesis as an explanation for the present form of life on Earth, various [[fundamentalism|fundamentalist]] sects, including many churches within [[Christianity]], have objected vehemently.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ev_publi.htm |title=Beliefs of the U.S. public about evolution and creation |last=Robinson |first=Bruce A. |date=November 1995 |website=ReligiousTolerance.org |publisher=[[Ontario Consultants on Religious Tolerance]] |location=Kingston, Ontario |accessdate=2010-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some adherents are passionately opposed to the [[Scientific consensus|consensus]] view of the [[scientific community]].  [[Literal and figurative language|Literal]] interpretations of religious texts are the greatest cause of conflict with evolutionary and [[cosmology|cosmological]] investigations and conclusions.

Internationally, evolution is taught in science courses with limited controversy, with the exception of a few areas of the [[United States]] and several [[Islam]]ic fundamentalist countries. In the United States, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] has ruled the teaching of [[creationism]] as [[science]] in [[State school#United States|public schools]] to be unconstitutional, irrespective of how it may be purveyed in [[Theology|theological]] or [[Catechism|religious instruction]]. In the United States, [[intelligent design]] (ID) has been represented as an alternative explanation to evolution in recent decades, but its "demonstrably religious, cultural, and legal missions" have been ruled unconstitutional by a [[United States district court|lower court]].&lt;ref name="Saletan"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Saletan |first=William |authorlink=William Saletan |date=December 21, 2005 |title=Is Creationism Destructible? |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/human_nature/2005/12/is_creationism_destructible.html |journal=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=[[Graham Holdings Company|The Washington Post Company]] |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Witt_2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.evolutionnews.org/2006/09/science_magazine_reviews_the_l002664.html |title=Science magazine reviews The Language of God by Francis Collins, Ignores the Book's Intelligent Design |last=Witt |first=Jonathan |date=September 29, 2006 |website=Evolution News &amp; Views |publisher=[[Discovery Institute]] |location=Seattle, WA |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.criminalbrief.com/?p=798| title=Evilution |last=Lundin |first=Leigh |date=May 4, 2008 |website=Criminal Brief |publisher=CriminalBrief.com |location=Los Angeles, CA |accessdate=2010-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Annas_2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Annas |first=George J. |authorlink=George Annas |date=May 25, 2006 |title=Intelligent Judging — Evolution in the Classroom and the Courtroom |url=http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMlim055660 |journal=[[The New England Journal of Medicine]] |location=Waltham, MA |publisher=[[Massachusetts Medical Society]] |volume=354 |pages=2277–2281 |doi=10.1056/NEJMlim055660 |accessdate=2014-06-15 |pmid=16723620 |issue=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==By country==

===Australia===
Although creationist views are popular among [[religious education]] teachers and creationist teaching materials have been distributed by volunteers in some schools,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Minus |first=Jodie |date=June 25, 2010 |title=Creationism creeps into NSW schools |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/creationism-creeps-into-nsw-schools/story-e6frg6nf-1225884487850 |newspaper=[[The Australian]] |location=Sydney |publisher=[[News Corp Australia]] |accessdate=2011-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; many Australian [[scientist]]s take an aggressive stance supporting the right of teachers to teach the theory of evolution, unhindered by religious restrictions.

{{cquote| An essential element in the teaching of science is the encouragement of students and teachers to critically appraise the evidence for notions being taught as science. The Society states unequivocally that the dogmatic teaching of notions such as Creationism within a science curriculum stifles the development of critical thinking patterns in the developing mind and seriously compromises the best interests of objective public education. This could eventually hamper the advancement of science and technology as students take their places as leaders of future generations. |||[[Geological Society of Australia]]&lt;ref name="GSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gsa.org.au/pdfdocuments/management/POL_intel%20design_2008.pdf |title=Intelligent Design Policy: Science Education and Creationism |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 17, 2008 |website=Geological Society of Australia |publisher=[[Geological Society of Australia|Geological Society of Australia Incorporated]] |location=Sydney |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-06-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

;Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe Resolution 1580

On October 4, 2007, the [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] (PACE) adopted its Resolution 1580 titled ''The dangers of creationism in education''. The resolution observed that "The war on the theory of evolution and on its proponents most often originates in forms of religious extremism closely linked to extreme right-wing political movements," and urged member states "firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general the presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion."&lt;ref name="PACE_2007-10-04"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=11751&amp;lang=en |title=The dangers of creationism in education |date=October 4, 2007 |work=Committee on Culture, Science and Education |publisher=Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe |type=Resolution |id=Resolution 1580 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Content
The resolution's aim is "to warn against certain tendencies to pass off a belief as science … the Parliamentary Assembly is worried about the possible ill-effect of the spread of creationist ideas within our education systems and about the consequences for our democracies. If we are not careful, creationism could become a threat to human rights."&lt;ref name="dw-world.de"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Council of Europe: Keep Creationism Out of Science Classes |url=http://www.dw.de/council-of-europe-keep-creationism-out-of-science-classes/a-2809619 |work=[[Deutsche Welle]] |location=Berlin/Bonn, Germany |publisher=[[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]] |date=October 5, 2007 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It rejects that creationism in any form, including "intelligent design," can be considered scientific (Para. 4), but considers possible its inclusion in religion and cultural classes (Para. 16). The resolution concludes that teaching creationism in school as a scientific theory may threaten civil rights (Paras. 13 and 18). The resolution summarizes itself in Para. 19:&lt;ref name="PACE_2007-10-04" /&gt;
{{quotation|
The Parliamentary Assembly therefore urges the member states, and especially their education authorities to:
#defend and promote scientific knowledge;
#strengthen the teaching of the foundations of science, its history, its epistemology and its methods alongside the teaching of objective scientific knowledge;
#make science more comprehensible, more attractive and closer to the realities of the contemporary world;
#firmly oppose the teaching of creationism as a scientific discipline on an equal footing with the theory of evolution and in general the presentation of creationist ideas in any discipline other than religion;
#promote the teaching of evolution as a fundamental scientific theory in the school curricula.}}

;Coverage and reaction

&lt;!-- Before adopting the resolution, the report prepared by Lengagne was criticised by the [[European Center for Law and Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.aclj.org/pdf/eclj_memo_coe_dangers_creationism_education_07052007.pdf Memorandum on Council of Europe legislation, Draft Resoluion Regarding Report on "The Dangers of Creationism in Education"] [[European Center for Law and Justice]], 2007&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;After the rejection of Lengagne's report, the former rapporteur was interviewed on the subject by the French newspaper ''[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]]'', where he evaluated the events as follows: "We are witnessing a return to the Middle Ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=Lengagne |first=Guy |authorlink=:fr:Guy Lengagne |interviewer=''20 Minutes'' |title='Le Conseil de l'Europe cède à des religieux intégristes' |trans-title=The Council of Europe yields to religious fundamentalists |language=French |url=http://www.20minutes.fr/france/167016-conseil-europe-cede-a-religieux-integristes |newspaper=[[20 minutes (France)|20 Minutes]] |location=Oslo, Norway |publisher=[[Schibsted]] |date=June 27, 2007 |accessdate=2014-06-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The resolution was criticised by deputy head of the Department for External Church Relations of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], [[Archpriest]] [[:ru:Чаплин, Всеволод Анатольевич|Vsevolod Chaplin]], stating that "those few fossils presented by the anthropologists as examples of ape-human transitional forms could be explained by random mutations.

In February 2009, the resolution was a starting point of a conference held in [[Dortmund|Dortmund, Germany]], and led by Dittmar Graf from the [[Dortmund University of Technology]]. The conference, including participation of Anne Brasseur, among others, was held in cooperation with the [[Max Planck Institute for Molecular Physiology]], [[University of Vienna]] and [[Hacettepe University]] and with support from German [[Federal Ministry of Education and Research (Germany)|Ministry of Education and Research]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hemminger |first=Hansjörg |authorlink=:de:Hansjörg Hemminger |date=April 2009 |title=Einstellungen zu Evolution und Wissenschaft in Europa |url=http://www.ekd.de/ezw/Publikationen_berichte_einstellungen_zu_evolution.php |journal=Materialdienst |language=German |location=Berlin |publisher=[[Evangelical Church in Germany]] |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Poole, a [[King's College London]] Visiting Research Fellow in Science and Religion and a founding member of the [[International Society for Science and Religion]], criticised the resolution for being too restrictive while disapproving of [[young Earth creationism]] and the [[intelligent design movement]].&lt;ref name="Poole_2008"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Poole |first=Michael |date=September 2008 |title=Creationism, intelligent design and science education |url=http://www.issr.org.uk/documents/SSR_Sept_2008_Poole.pdf |format=PDF |journal=[[The Association for Science Education#Journals|School Science Review]] |location=London |publisher=[[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] |volume=90 |issue=330 |pages=123–129 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929020848/http://www.issr.org.uk/documents/SSR_Sept_2008_Poole.pdf |archivedate=2011-09-29 |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, Norway's then-[[Ministry of Education and Research (Norway)|Minister of Church and Education Affairs]] [[Kjell Magne Bondevik]] proposed new education plans for the elementary and middle school levels which included skepticism to the theory of evolution and would hold that a final answer to the origin of mankind was unknown.

===Poland===
[[Poland]] saw a controversy over creationism in 2006 when Deputy Education Minister [[Mirosław Orzechowski]] denounced evolution as a lie taught in Polish schools. His superior, [[Ministry of National Education (Poland)|Minister of National Education]] [[Roman Giertych]], has stated that the theory of evolution would continue to be taught in Polish schools, "as long as most scientists in our country say that it is the right theory." Giertych's father, [[Member of the European Parliament]] [[Maciej Giertych]], has however opposed the teaching of evolution and has claimed that "in every culture there are indications that we remember [[dinosaur]]s. The Scots have [[Loch Ness Monster|Nessie]]; we Poles have the [[Wawel Dragon|Wawel dragon]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=December 18, 2006 |title=And finally... |url=http://www.wbj.pl/?command=article&amp;id=35336&amp;type=wbj |newspaper=[[Warsaw Business Journal]] |location=Warsaw, Poland |publisher=Valkea Media |accessdate=2014-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romania===
In 1998, Ioan Moisin, a [[Christian Democratic National Peasants' Party|Christian Democratic]] senator and a Greek Catholic priest, called upon [[Romania]]'s [[Ministry of Education, Research, Youth and Sport (Romania)|Ministry of Education]] to establish a commission of Catholics who would revise biology textbooks and philosophical textbooks to not contradict [[Bible|Biblical]] creationism. Moisin disapproved of students learning from their religious teachers that [[God]] created [[Human|human beings]] and then learning to the contrary from biology and philosophy teachers that humans descend from [[ape]]s as a product of evolution by Darwinian [[natural selection]]. Moisin's proposal to establish the commission also sought to form a Council of Public Morality that would feature representatives composed of teachers and clergy, to oversee public education, and to be subordinated only to the direct authority of the [[President of Romania]]. Romania's [[Parliament of Romania|Parliament]] and Ministry of Education never seriously considered the latter proposals.&lt;ref name="Stan &amp; Turcescu 2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stan |first1=Lavinia |authorlink1=Lavinia Stan |last2=Turcescu |first2=Lucian |authorlink2=Lucian Turcescu |date=September 2005 |title=Religious education in Romania |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967067X0500036X |journal=Communist and Post-Communist Studies |location=Oxford |publisher=[[Butterworth-Heinemann]] |volume=38 |issue=6 |pages=381–401 |doi=10.1016/j.postcomstud.2005.06.007 |accessdate=2012-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, starting the year 2006 and ongoing{{When|date=December 2017}} Darwinian evolution was discontinued from newly printed school books throughout the country without being reintroduced.&lt;ref name="hotnews.ro [in Romanian]"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hotnews.ro/stiri-esential-2456107-cum-batut-europenii-americanii-pentru-darwin-dumnezeu.htm |title=Cum s-au batut europenii si americanii pentru Darwin si Dumnezeu [How Europeans and the US fought for Darwin and god] |date=February 27, 2008 |accessdate=2017-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="contributors.ro [in Romanian]"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.contributors.ro/administratie/educatie/teoria-evolutiei-trebuie-sa-se-predea-din-nou-in-scolile-din-romania/ |title=Teoria evoluţiei trebuie să se predea din nou în şcolile din România [Evolution must be taught again in Romanian schools] |date=January 23, 2015 |accessdate=2017-12-23}}&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In December 2006, a schoolgirl in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], and her father took the issue of the teaching of evolution in Russian schools to court. The [[Russian Ministry of Education]] supports the theory of evolution. Representatives of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] backed the suit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Niedowski |first=Erika |date=January 3, 2007 |title= In Russia, a test of God vs. Darwin |url= http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2007-01-03/news/0701030102_1_darwin-theory-theory-of-evolution-charles-darwin |newspaper=[[The Baltimore Sun]] |location=Chicago, IL |publisher =[[Tribune Company]] |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Leonov | first=Maksim |date=March 1, 2006 |title=St. Petersburg schoolgirl sues authorities over Darwinism |url=http://en.ria.ru/russia/20060301/43853593.html |location=Moscow |agency= [[RIA Novosti]] |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2007, the first instance court, and in July, the second instance court, ruled in favour of the Ministry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; | script-title=ru:Суд Санкт-Петербурга отклонил иск о преподавании теории Дарвина |url=http://ria.ru/society/20070704/68336516.html | location=Moscow |agency=RIA Novosti |language=Russian |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2014 the Mayor of [[Kazan]], [[Ilsur Metshin|Il'sur Metshin]], expressed surprise at schools teaching the "theory of Darwin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | script-title=ru:Мэр Казани отвергает теорию Дарвина | url=http://www.evening-kazan.ru/news/mer-kazani-otvergaet-teoriyu-darvina.html | newspaper =Вечерняя Казань | language =Russian | publication-date=2014-08-21 | accessdate =2014-08-25 | quote  =Выступая сегодня на городской конференции педагогов, казанский градоначальник Ильсур Метшин высказал удивление по поводу того, что в школах до сих пор преподают теорию Дарвина о происхождении человека}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He added that he intended to raise the question of the school curriculum at the federal level.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| script-title=ru:Мэр Казани предлагает запретить теорию Дарвина | trans-title =The Mayor of Kazan' plans to forbid Darwin's theory| url  =http://www.otr-online.ru/news/news_32967.html| newspaper =Общественное телевидение России| language =Russian| location =Moscow| publisher =Общественное телевидение России| publication-date=2014-08-23| accessdate =2014-08-25| quote  =Он добавил, что планирует поднять вопрос о необходимости преподавания в школах теории Дарвина на федеральном уровне}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saudi Arabia===
A Saudi 12th-grade textbook mentions evolution by name only where it claims that Charles Darwin has "denied [[Allah]]'s creation of humanity".&lt;ref name="BurtonIRNKSA" /&gt; The rest of the textbook focuses on descriptions of the taxonomic ranks: it makes no further mention of evolution, only quoting Qur'an verses as relevant to certain groups of animals.&lt;ref name="BurtonIRNKSA" /&gt;

===Serbia===
In [[Serbia]] the teaching of evolution was suspended for one week in 2004, under [[Cabinet of Serbia (2004–07)|Minister of Education and Sport]] [[Ljiljana Čolić]], only allowing schools to reintroduce evolution into the curriculum if they also taught creationism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=de Quetteville |first=Harry |date=September 9, 2004 |title=Darwin is off the curriculum for Serbian schools |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/1471367/Darwin-is-off-the-curriculum-for-Serbian-schools.html |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |location=London |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; "After a deluge of protest from scientists, teachers and opposition parties" says the [[BBC]] report, Čolić's deputy, Milan Brdar, made the statement, "I have come here to confirm [[Charles Darwin]] is still alive" and announced that the decision was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 9, 2004 |title=Serbia reverses Darwin suspension |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3642460.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |location=London |publisher=[[BBC]] |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Čolić resigned after the government said that she had caused "problems that had started to reflect on the work of the entire government."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=September 16, 2004 |title='Anti-Darwin' Serb minister quits |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/3663196.stm |work=BBC News |location=London |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
In [[Turkey]], a country where the majority of population is Muslim, evolution is often a controversial subject. Evolution was added to the school curriculum shortly after the [[Turkish War of Independence|Turkish Revolution]] of the 1920s and 30s.&lt;ref name="Edis"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Edis |first=Taner |authorlink=Taner Edis |date=January 2008 |title=Islamic Creationism: A Short History |url=http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2008/NewsletterJanuary2008Creationism.html |journal=Newsletter |location=Notre Dame, IN |publisher=[[History of Science Society]] |volume=37 |issue=1 |issn=0739-4934 |accessdate=2008-02-24 |quote=...Islam has been the world religion that has proved most resistant to Darwinian evolution. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716061337/http://www.hssonline.org/publications/Newsletter2008/NewsletterJanuary2008Creationism.html |archivedate=2011-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; There was some resistance to this, such as that of [[Said Nursî]] and his followers, but opposition was not particularly powerful.&lt;ref name="Edis" /&gt; In fact, some prominent Turkish scholars during the first decades of the new-born Turkish republic, such as [[:tr:Ahmet Hamdi Akseki|Ahmet Hamdi Akseki]] (d. 1951), who once served as the [[Presidency of Religious Affairs|President of Religious Affairs of Turkey]], and İzmirli İsmail Hakkı (d. 1946) thought that the theory of evolution cannot be seen as contrary to Islam because it was already to be found in the classical works of Muslim theology.&lt;ref name=VKaya&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kaya |first=Veysel |date=April 2012 |title=Can the Quran Support Darwin? An Evolutionist Approach by Two Turkish Scholars after the Foundation of the Turkish Republic |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1478-1913.2011.01362.x/abstract |journal=The Muslim World |volume=102 |issue=2 |pages=357–370 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-1913.2011.01362.x |issn=1478-1913 |accessdate=2013-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, conservatives came into power, and used the ideas of [[Creation science|scientific creationists]] in the [[United States|US]] as a method of discrediting evolution (notwithstanding material on the [[age of the Earth]], which [[Islamic views on evolution|Islamic creationism]] is less specific about).

One anti-evolutionist group in Turkey is the [[Istanbul]] based ''[[:tr:Bilim Araştırma Vakfı|Bilim Araştırma Vakfı]]'' (BAV), or "Science Research Foundation," which was founded by [[Adnan Oktar]] in 1990. Its activities include campaigns against the teaching of evolution. It has been described as one of the strongest anti-evolution organizations outside of [[North America]].&lt;ref name=Koenig&gt;{{cite journal |last=Koenig |first=Robert |date=May 18, 2001 |title=Creationism Takes Root Where Europe, Asia Meet |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/292/5520/1286 |journal=Science |location=Washington, D.C. |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science |volume=292 |issue=5520 |pages=1286–1287 |doi=10.1126/science.292.5520.1286 |issn=0036-8075 |pmid=11360976 |accessdate=2014-06-20 |quote=Harassed but hard-headed, some gutsy Turkish scientists are stepping up their efforts to promote the teaching of the theory of evolution...}}&lt;/ref&gt; US based creationist organizations such as the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) have worked alongside them.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; Some scientists have protested that anti-evolution books published by this group (such as ''The Evolution Deceit'' (1999) by Harun Yahya) have become more influential than real biology textbooks.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; The teaching of evolution in high schools has been fought by Ali Gören, a member of parliament and professor of medicine, who believes such education has negative effects.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt;

The situation is very fragile, and the status of evolution in education varies from one government to the next. For example, in 1985 the [[Ministry of National Education (Turkey)|Minister of National Education, Youth and Sports]] [[:tr:Vehbi Dinçerler|Vehbi Dinçerler]] had scientific creationism added to high school texts, and also had the discredited [[Lamarckism]] presented alongside [[Darwinism]].&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; Only in 1998 was this changed somewhat, with texts presenting a more balanced view, though still mentioning creationism and Lamarckism.&lt;ref name=Koenig /&gt; At present the moderate Islamist [[Justice and Development Party (Turkey)|Justice and Development Party]], which is sympathetic to creationist views,&lt;ref name="Edis" /&gt; holds power. It was elected in 2002 and again with a greater majority in 2007.

In general, material that conflicts with religious beliefs is highly controversial in Turkey. For example, in November 2007 a prosecutor launched a probe into whether Richard Dawkins' book ''[[The God Delusion]]'' (2006) is "an attack on religious values." Its publisher could face trial and up to one year in prison if the prosecutor concludes that the book "incites religious hatred" and insults religious values.&lt;ref name="AP_2007-11-28"&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Turkey probes atheist's 'God' book |url=http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/28/dawkins.turkey.ap/index.html |agency=[[Associated Press]] |date=November 28, 2007 |location=New York |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070813055357/http://www.cnn.com/2007/WORLD/europe/11/28/dawkins.turkey.ap/index.html |archivedate=2007-08-13 |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Turkish academics who have defended evolutionary theory have received [[death threat]]s, for instance Turkish biologist Aykut Kence received an email telling him to enjoy his "final days."&lt;ref name=Koenig /&gt; Kence helped establish the Evolution Group, whose aim is to improve public understanding of evolution.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; However, opposition to creationism is not very powerful; Umit Sayin, a neurologist, describes academics and universities as "slow and sluggish" in their response.&lt;!-- Koenig --&gt; Kence maintains that "if knowledgeable people keep quiet, it only helps those who spread nonsense."&lt;ref name=Koenig /&gt;

In June 2017, the education ministry announced the removal of evolution from the secondary school curriculum, scheduled to take effect in 2019; as of the date of the announcement the only other Muslim majority country where evolution is challenged in the education system was Saudi Arabia, where the concept is briefly named and heavily criticized in the curricula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kingsley|first1=Patrick|title=Turkey Drops Evolution From Curriculum, Angering Secularists|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/23/world/europe/turkey-evolution-high-school-curriculum.html|work=The New York Times|date=23 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Frazier |first1=Kendrick |authorlink1=Kendrick Frazier |title=CFI, Richard Dawkins, Teachers Slam as 'Unconscionable' Turkey's Decision to Ban Teaching Evolution |journal=[[Skeptical Inquirer]] |date=2017 |volume=41 |issue=5 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In each of the countries of the [[United Kingdom]], there is an agreed syllabus for religious education with the right of parents to withdraw their children from these lessons. The religious education syllabus does not involve teaching creationism, but rather teaching the central tenets of major world faiths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.state.gov/j/drl/rls/irf/2002/13989.htm |title=International Religious Freedom Report 2002: United Kingdom |website=[[Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights, and Labor]] |publisher=[[United States Department of State]] |location=Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, the teaching of evolution is compulsory in publicly funded schools. For instance, the [[National Curriculum (England, Wales and Northern Ireland)|National Curriculum]] for [[England]] requires that students at Key Stage 4 (14–16) be taught:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite hansard |title=Creationism |house=House of Commons |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200506/cmhansrd/vo060227/text/60227131.htm |date=February 27, 2006 |column_start=518W |column_end=519W}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# that the fossil record is evidence for evolution
# how variation and selection may lead to evolution or extinction

Similar requirements exist in [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]].

In 2003, the [[Emmanuel Schools Foundation]] (previously the Vardy Foundation after its founder, [[Peter Vardy (businessman)|Sir Peter Vardy]]) sponsored a number of "faith-based" academies where evolution and creationist ideas would be taught side-by-side in science classes. This caused a considerable amount of controversy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Taylor |first=Matthew |date=May 30, 2006 |title=Parents rebel at 'Dickensian' school run by millionaire evangelist friend of Blair |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/may/30/politics.schools |newspaper=The Guardian |access-date=2016-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The former [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], [[Rowan Williams]], has expressed his view that creationism should not be taught in schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview |last=William |first=Rowan |authorlink=Rowan Williams |interviewer=[[Alan Rusbridger]] |title=Interview: Rowan Williams |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/mar/21/religion.uk |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |publisher=[[Guardian Media Group]] |date=March 21, 2006 | accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Fears over teaching creationism |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/education/4828238.stm |work=BBC News |location=London |publisher=BBC |date=March 21, 2006 |accessdate=2010-04-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An organisation called [[Truth in Science]] has distributed teaching packs of creationist information to schools, and claims that fifty-nine schools are using the packs as "a useful classroom resource."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=November 26, 2006 |title=Revealed: rise of creationism in UK schools |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2006/nov/27/controversiesinscience.religion |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has stated that "Neither intelligent design nor creationism are recognised scientific theories and they are not included in the science curriculum. The Truth in Science information pack is therefore not an appropriate resource to support the science curriculum." It is arranging to communicate this message directly to schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Randerson |first=James |date=December 6, 2006 |title=Ministers to ban creationist teaching aids in science lessons |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/dec/07/schools.religion |newspaper=The Guardian |location=London |publisher=Guardian Media Group |accessdate=2014-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The teaching of creationism and intelligent design in schools in the UK is being opposed by the [[British Centre for Science Education]] (BCSE).&lt;ref name="EDOC11297" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Graebsch |first=Almut |author2=Schiermeier, Quirin |date=November 23, 2006 |title=Anti-evolutionists raise their profile in Europe |journal=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] |volume=444 |pages=406–407 |doi=10.1038/444406a |pmid=17122815 |issue=7118}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2371">'''Dynamique des femmes jurists''' is a women's organisation in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. It was co-founded in 2006 by [[Nelly Mbangu]], director of the Democracy Research Center, who went on to become the first president of the organisation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nelly Mbangu|url=http://www.ffcrdc.org/team_member/7746/|publisher=Fonds pour les Femmes Congolaises|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
At the start of the 21st century the Democratic Republic of the Congo was suffering civil war with rebels fighting against government troops. In 2003  a peace accord was negotiated and in 2006 elections were held. However years of instability had resulted in much violence in the eastern part of the country which was described as the "rape capital of the world".&lt;ref&gt;

==Objectives==
Dynamique des femmes jurists was set up to provide gender equality for women. The organisation aims to empower women so that they know what their rights are and are confident in obtaining them. These rights include the right to live unmolested, to have security of land tenure, to have access to basic social services, and to have access to the courts and tribunals. The organisation aims to encourage women to take up the law as a profession and then to represent other women who need their services, also to join trade unions, to participate in politics and to join in decision-making bodies in both the public and private sectors.&lt;ref name=DFJ&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dfj-rdc.org/ |title=Dynamique des femmes jurists |publisher=Dynamique des femmes jurists |accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organisation also offers psychological help to survivors of rape and [[female genital mutilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=She is a humanitarian|url=https://www.careinternational.org.uk/sheisahumanitarian|publisher=Care International|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of title==
In the research phase of ''Escape Fire'', the filmmakers came across an influential speech delivered by Dr. [[Donald Berwick]] years before he took office as the head of Medicare and Medicaid. The speech was published as a healthcare manifesto called “Escape Fire: Lessons for the Future of Healthcare.”

Dr. Berwick draws a parallel between American healthcare and a 1949 [[Mann Gulch fire]] in Montana. Just as the healthcare system lies perilously on the brink of combustion, the forest fire that seemed harmless at first was waiting to explode. A team of fifteen smoke-jumpers parachuted in to contain the fire, but soon they were running for their lives, racing to the top of a steep ridge. Their foreman, Wag Dodge, recognized that they would not make it.

With the fire barely two hundred yards behind him, he invented an on-the-spot solution. He took some matches out of his pocket, bent down and set fire to the grass directly in front of him. The fire spread quickly uphill, and he stepped into the middle of the newly burnt area, calling for his crew to join him.

The crew did not, and the fire raged past Wag Dodge and overtook the crew, killing thirteen men and burning 3,200 acres. Dodge survived, nearly unharmed.

Dodge had invented what is now called an “[[escape fire]],” and soon after it became standard practice. As Berwick says in the film, “We’re in Mann Gulch. Healthcare, it’s in really bad trouble. The answer is among us. Can we please stop and think and make sense of the situation and get our way out of it?”

==Outreach and impact==

Since the film’s Sundance premiere in January 2012, ''Escape Fire'' has been at the center of an outreach campaign to engage general, educational, professional and institutional audiences interested in changing health and healthcare at the individual, community and national level. The ''Escape Fire'' website,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Escape Fire Official Site|url=http://escapefiremovie.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides consumer and educational tools for the outreach and engagement campaign. It includes a virtual First Aid Kit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Escape Fire First Aid Kit|url=http://www.escapefiremovie.com/first-aid-kit|publisher=Our Time Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; with innovative tools for individuals to change themselves and their communities. A 28-page discussion guide&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Escape Fire Discussion Guide|url=http://www.escapefiremovie.com/pdf/discussionguide.pdf|publisher=Our Time Projects}}&lt;/ref&gt; is provided on the site for screening organizers, facilitators and educators. Background information is available on the key healthcare issues addressed in the film, including problems of over-medication; paying more and getting less; reimbursement for services not quality of care, and the need for more systemic support of disease prevention.

After viewing a military screening of the film, Senator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) was inspired to address the issue, and successfully ushered through a bi-partisan amendment to the [[National Defense Authorization Act]], which passed the Senate in late 2012. This amendment would allow the VA to take back controlled substances - such as pharmaceutical drugs - from  soldiers to prevent overmedication and suicide. The amendment did not win final passage in the 112th Congress, which ended on January 3, 2013, but is expected to be re-introduced in the Spring of 2013.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4865">The '''Government Documents Department''' is a part of the [[George A. Smathers Libraries]] at the [[University of Florida]]. The Government Documents Department is located at the off-campus Auxiliary Library Facility (ALF).&lt;ref name="GovDocs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/docs/ |title=Government Documents Department |publisher=University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries |website=George A. Smathers Libraries |access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Government Documents Department receives government publications from all levels of government (local, county, state, and national), and from many areas around the world. The Government Documents staff performs both technical and public service functions in an effort to make this resource of government information available to both the University of Florida community and the public at large; Government Documents Department staff also have prepared LibGuides (research and information guides) on various topics to assist patrons. 

The Government Documents department is a Regional Federal Depository for Florida, Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands. The Government Documents Department also serves as a [[Federal Depository Library Program|regional depository]] for U.S. Federal documents. As such, the Department receives and permanently retains one depository copy of every publication the U.S. Government Printing Office distributes through the [[Federal Depository Library Program]] The Government Documents Department is also a depository for the [[Government of Florida]] and [[European Union]] documents. The Government Documents Library also houses publications from the University of Florida,international governmental organizations (such as the [[United Nations]], the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] and [[UNESCO]].

== History ==
The Government Documents Library was declared a Federal Depository Library in 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://catalog.gpo.gov/fdlpdir/FDLPdir.jsp?mode=1&amp;pid=3 |title=FDLD Profile Details |publisher=U.S. Government Publishing Office |website=Catalog of U.S. Government Publications (CGP) |access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a Regional Depository Library in 1964. Until 2004, the collection was housed in Library West at the University of Florida;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uflib.ufl.edu/msl/librarytimeline.html |title=UF Libraries History Timeline |publisher=University of Florida |website=George A. Smathers Libraries |access-date=8 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to the first floor of the [[University of Florida Marston Science Library]] for several years. The collection is now located at the Auxiliary Library Facility.&lt;ref name="GovDocs" /&gt;

== Consortial Efforts ==
As a member of the [http://aserl.org/ Association of South East Research Libraries (ASERL)], the University of Florida George A. Smathers Libraries are participating in the Collaborative Federal Depository Program which encourages member Regional Depository Libraries to become Centers of Excellence  for specific government agencies. The Centers of Excellence accept a role as stewards of these collections, agreeing to collect, catalog, and preserve publications produced by a given agency or published by the government around a certain them. The UF Libraries have committed to becoming a Center of Excellence for the Panama Canal Commission (PCC) and its preceding institutions as well as on the topic of the Panama Canal.  As an additional step in this project, the UF Libraries have decided to digitize the material in this collection. As they are scanned, titles become available at Internet Archive and are then also made available the UF libraries catalog. [Note: The phrase center of excellence is used here as it is used within the U.S. Federal Depository Library Program to identify a library establishing a collection and related services focused on a specific Federal agency or subject area represented by Federal documents. This is distinct from, and unrelated to, the Florida program of the same name that is intended to bridge the gap between academia and industry.]

'''Gyorin''' (lit. "neighborly relations") was a [[neo-Confucian]] term developed in [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] [[Korea]].  The term was intended to identify and characterize a diplomatic policy which establishes and maintains amicable relations with neighboring states.  It was construed and understood in tandem with a corollary term, which was the ''[[Sadaejuui|sadae]]'' or "serving the great" policy towards [[History of China#Imperial era|Imperial China]].&lt;ref&gt;Yim Min-Hyeok.

Confucian learning contributed in the formation of ''gyorin'' and ''sadae'' as ritual, conceptual and normative frameworks for construing interactions and political decision-making.&lt;ref&gt;Steben, Barry D.  [http://www.chinajapan.org/articles/11.1/11.1steben39-60.pdf.

==Multi-national foreign policy==
The rationale expressed by ''gyorin'' was applied to a multi-national foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{ko icon}} [http://enc.daum.net/dic100/contents.do?query1=b10s4187a 사대교린  (조선 외교), Britannica online Korea]&lt;/ref&gt;  Scholarly writing about the Joseon dynasty has tended to focus on diplomatic relations with China and [[Japan]], but the intermediary nature of ''gyorin'' contacts—for example, Joseon-Ryukyuan diplomatic and trading contacts—were important as well.&lt;ref&gt;Kim, Chun-gil.

The Joseon kingdom made every effort to maintain a friendly bilateral relationship with China for reasons having to do with both ''[[realpolitik]]'' and a more idealist Confucian worldview wherein China was seen as the center of a Confucian moral universe.&lt;ref&gt;Mansourov, Alexandre Y. [http://www.asiaquarterly.com/content/view/174/43/ "Will Flowers Bloom without Fragrance?

The unique nature of ''gyorin'' bilateral diplomatic exchanges evolved from a conceptual framework developed by the Chinese.  Gradually, the theoretical models would be modified, mirroring the evolution of a unique relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Toby, Ronald P. (1991).

'''Henry Madison Morris''' (October 6, 1918 – February 25, 2006) was an [[United States|American]] [[Young Earth creationism|young Earth creationist]], [[Christian apologetics|Christian apologist]], and engineer.  He was one of the founders of the [[Creation Research Society]] and the [[Institute for Creation Research]].

As Morris believed in the [[biblical literalism]] and [[biblical inerrancy|inerrancy]], he opposed the billions-of-years time scales of [[evolution]], the [[age of the Earth]], and the [[age of the Universe]]  that he saw as being contrary to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Early life, education and personal life==
Morris was born in [[Dallas]] on October 6, 1918,&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; grew up in [[Texas]] in the 1920s and 1930s, and graduated from [[Rice University]] with a bachelor's degree in [[civil engineering]] in 1939.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UMKCBio"&gt;{{cite news | last1=Linder | first1=Doug | title=Henry M.

Morris | url=http://creationsciencehalloffame.org/inductees/deceased/henry-m-morris/ | publisher=''creationsciencehalloffame.org'' | accessdate=March 28, 2016| date=2012-01-30 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They were married until Morris's death in 2006.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;

While Morris was religiously indifferent during his youth, shortly after his graduation from Rice in 1939, Morris became a Christian and accepted the Bible, from Genesis through Revelation, as the infallible and literal word of God.&lt;ref name="UMKCBio"/&gt;

==Career==
After graduating in 1939, Morris served as an hydraulic engineer working with the [[International Boundary and Water Commission]] (1939-1942).&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt; He returned to Rice, teaching civil engineering from 1942 until 1946, where he also wrote a short book, ''That You Might Believe'' (1946).&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt; Attempting to answer the claims of evolution, he found the works of Harry Rimmer in his book, Theory of Evolution and the Facts of Science, "which more than any other work convinced him 'once and for all that evolution was false.'" &lt;ref&gt;Numbers, R. (2006). The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design, Expanded Edition. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}. pp.218&lt;/ref&gt; From 1946-1951, he studied at the [[University of Minnesota]], where he earned a master's degree in hydraulics (1948)&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in hydraulic engineering (1950).&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; In 1949, he joined the American Scientific Association as a correspondent in an attempt to change the views of the association.&lt;ref&gt;Numbers, R. (2006). The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design, Expanded Edition. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}. pp.221&lt;/ref&gt; In 1951, he became a professor and chair of civil engineering at the [[University of Louisiana at Lafayette]] and served as the Acting Dean of Engineering in the fall of 1956.&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt; Morris then served as a professor of applied science at [[Southern Illinois University]] in 1957.&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt;

In 1959, Morris moved to the [[Virginia Tech|Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University]] (Virginia Tech) to serve as Professor of Civil Engineering in the area of [[hydraulics]], and to serve as department chair for civil engineering.&lt;ref name="UMKCBio"/&gt; There, Morris co-authored an advanced text on [[hydraulic engineering|engineering hydraulics]] with J.M. Wiggert that was used in many universities, and under a decade of leadership the department became one of the country's largest civil engineering departments.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Henry M. &amp;  James Miller Wiggert (1972) ''Applied Hydraulics in Engineering'', Somerset, New Jersey: John Wiley &amp; Sons ({{ISBN|0-471-06669-9}})&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="roanoke"&gt;Miller, Kevin (2005) Former Virginia Tech professor opened floodgates of creation debate, The Roanoke Times, Sunday, December 04, 2005, {{cite web |url=http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/wb/xp-43221 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-02-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080229030534/http://www.roanoke.com/news/nrv/wb/wb/xp-43221 |archivedate=2008-02-29 |df= }} [accessed 22 February 2013].&lt;/ref&gt; While Morris' religious views and writings were controversial among university biology and geology faculty, and in the broader debate, it has been reported that Morris "kept his own counsel on [them], unless... pressed", such that his university engineering colleagues respected Morris as "a good administrator" and his religious views "because they never influenced his [administration]".&lt;ref name="roanoke" /&gt;

In 1961, Morris coauthored ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'' with [[John C. Whitcomb]], which some regard as the first significant attempt in the 20th century to offer a systematic scientific explanation for creationism.&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt; The book was very influential on modern creationist thought,&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; and [[Stephen Jay Gould]], a critic of Morris, called it "the founding document of the creationist movement."&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UMKCBio"/&gt;

In 1963, while yet at Virginia Tech, Morris and nine others founded the [[Creation Research Society]], and Morris continued his creationist writing and speaking. Morris eventually left his faculty position at Virginia Tech in 1970 to focus on his work in creationism, after university interactions with a new engineering dean who directed Morris not to list creationist works alongside his engineering publications, viewing his non-engineering writings and increasing persona to be "too controversial."&lt;ref name="roanoke" /&gt; Morris is quoted as having said that these directions "seemed like... the handwriting on the wall that they didn't want me to stay..." and that "[Dean Willis] Worchester was happy... when I submitted my resignation".&lt;ref&gt;''ibid.''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Morris co-founded the [[San Diego Christian College|Christian Heritage College]] in [[Santee, California]]&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt; which led to formation of the [[Institute for Creation Research]] (ICR) in 1972. He served as President of Christian Heritage College from 1978 to 1980.&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt; Additionally, Morris served as President, and as President [[Emeritus]] of ICR from 1970-1995 and 1996-2006, respectively.&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt; His son, [[John D. Morris]], took over the presidency of ICR when his father retired.&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt;

On February 1, 2006, Morris suffered a minor stroke and was hospitalized. Morris was moved from the hospital to a rehabilitation facility near his son's home (and ICR) in [[Santee, California]] where he died.&lt;ref name="Obituary"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060301/news_1m1morris.html| archive-url=https://archive.is/20130202072218/http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20060301/news_1m1morris.html| dead-url=yes| archive-date=February 2, 2013| title=Henry M.

==Reception==

===Achievements===
Morris has been considered by many to be "the father of modern [[creation science]]",&lt;ref name="Seattle"/&gt; and was "arguably the most influential creationist of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="Obituary"/&gt; Morris helped create the modern school of thought based on a belief in biblical inerrancy and a literal interpretation of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref&gt;Whitcomb and Morris, 1.&lt;/ref&gt; It is a system Morris called "[[Scientific Creationism]]" that opposes the mainstream [[scientific community]] regarding the history of the earth and the universe. Morris found an audience among preachers and home school teachers all over America, where 46% of the public holds some form of creationist belief.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=46% Hold Creationist View of Human Origins|website= Gallup poll |url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/155003/hold-creationist-view-human-origins.aspx|accessdate= June 11, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris was the primary source for much of the argumentation used by young Earth creationists when rejecting primary ideas in mainstream science, from the [[expanding universe]] to [[plate tectonics]] to [[biological evolution]] to [[genetics]].&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Rep. [[Paul Broun]] says evolution, embryology and the Big Bang are "lies straight from the pit of hell"{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} {{YouTube|ZBy3MbP4WDo}} (accessed June 11, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=March 2016}}

Morris's book, ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'', coauthored by [[John C. Whitcomb]], was very influential on modern creationist belief, and by the time of Morris's death, it was in its 44th printing and sold 250,000 English copies.&lt;ref name="NYT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ronald Numbers|Numbers, R.]] (2006). ''The Creationists: From Scientific Creationism to Intelligent Design, Expanded Edition''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|0-674-02339-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While the greater bulk of his published writings address [[creation science]] and [[evolution]] themes, he had also written ''Many Infallible Proofs'', and ''The Bible Has The Answer'', which are both works of general [[Christian apologetics]].

In 1995, Morris completed ''The Defenders Study Bible'' which includes his scientific &amp; theological notes accompanying the [[King James Version]]. Just prior to his death in 2006 he completed a significant expansion of that work titled ''The New Defender's Study Bible''.&lt;ref name="New Defender's"&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Henry|title=The New Defender's Study Bible|year=2006|publisher=World Publishing|location=Nashville, TN  37214|isbn=978-0529122179|pages=2,059}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In May 2012 ''The New Defenders Study Bible'' was updated and released as ''The Henry Morris Study Bible''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Morris|first=Henry|title=The Henry Morris Study Bible|isbn=978-0890516577|pages=2,215|year=2012|publisher=Master Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, during his lifetime, Morris published eleven articles on [[hydraulics]] in technical journals as well as hundreds of other articles and booklets on Biblical or creationist topics.&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt; From 1985 to 2002, he published ''Days of Praise'',&lt;ref name="CSHoF"/&gt; a monthly devotional booklet that contained a devotional Bible commentary for each day, which illustrated his spiritual focus.

===Criticism===
Many in the scientific community have said that Morris' representation of evolution as a complete religious system is a [[straw man]].&lt;ref name="Thomas Wheeler 1992. page 97-100"&gt;Thomas Wheeler, "''Scientific Creationism'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 97-100 {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In particular, [[Massimo Pigliucci]] criticized Morris' omission of material that interfered with his "mission" and "beliefs".&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci]]. ''[[Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science]]''. (Sinauer, 2002): {{ISBN|0-87893-659-9}} page 46&lt;/ref&gt; Pigliucci also criticized Morris' interpretation of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;[[Massimo Pigliucci]]. ''[[Denying Evolution: Creationism, Scientism, and the Nature of Science]]''. (Sinauer, 2002): {{ISBN|0-87893-659-9}} page 194&lt;/ref&gt; Morris' position had also been the subject of debate among [[Evangelicalism|Evangelical]] scholars of the [[Old Testament]] and among Evangelicals working in various fields of science.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

In ''Evolution &amp; the Modern Christian'' (1967), Morris hoped to "open the minds and hearts of young people to the true Biblical cosmology." T.E. Fenton, Professor of [[Agronomy]] at [[Iowa State University]], wrote "scientific value of the book is [[nothing|nil]]; the author selectively chooses the areas of science that he accepts and rejects other areas of accepted science".&lt;ref&gt;T.E. Fenton, "''Evolution &amp; the Modern Christian'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 93 {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Vogel, Professor of Biology at [[Creighton University]], reviewed the book explaining "his theology is shallow; his [[exegesis]] is maddening; his science is wrong; and he tops it off by offending millions of Bible-believing Christians who also accept evolution".&lt;ref&gt;David Vogel, "''The Remarkable Birth of Planet Earth'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 108 {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Morris' book ''Scientific Creationism'' (1974 and 1984), according to Herman Kirkpatrick, "is not very convincing evidence to support the recent creation of the earth".&lt;ref&gt;Herman Kirkpatrick, "''Scientific Creationism'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 94 {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomas Wheeler, Professor of biochemistry at [[University of Louisville]], reviewed the second edition and concluded, "''Scientific Creationism'' cannot be recommended for use in public school classes, or indeed anyone interested in learning science".&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Wheeler, "''Scientific Creationism'' Review" in ''Reviews of Creationist Books'' ed Liz Rank Hughes, [[National Center for Science Education]], 1992. page 102 {{ISBN|0-939873-52-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wheeler cited what he claimed was Morris' misunderstanding of science, appeals to religious prejudice, misrepresentation of scientific knowledge, omission of opposing science, double standards in evidence, "absurd conclusions," inappropriate and misidentified sources, attacks on scientists, using discredited arguments, and "silly calculations".&lt;ref name="Thomas Wheeler 1992. page 97-100"/&gt;

Morris' work with [[John C. Whitcomb]], ''[[The Genesis Flood]]'', has been criticized for taking quotes out of context and misquoting sources.&lt;ref name="misquote"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/quotes/#s2-1 | title=Quotations and Misquotations:Classic example from The Genesis Flood  |publisher=[[talk.origins]] | date=February 7, 2002 | first= | last= | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one instance, a source which read "the sea which vanished so many  million  years ago" was quoted as "the sea which vanished so many years ago."&lt;ref name="misquote" /&gt; Geologist John G. Solum has criticized the work for being inaccurate.&lt;ref name="Solum"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/lewis/#intro | title=Thrust faults |publisher=[[talk.origins]] | date=February 7, 2002 | first=John | last=Solum | accessdate = 2007-01-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Solum said "Whitcomb and Morris are mistaken about the nature of the rocks associated with [[thrust fault]]s. Their claim about fossils is based on a [[Young Earth creationism|Young Earth creationist]] misunderstanding of how rocks are dated relative to each other, and how the geologic column was constructed."&lt;ref name="Solum" /&gt; Additionally, Solum said "Morris' explanation of relative dating is not merely 'somewhat oversimplified' - it is entirely incorrect."&lt;ref name="Solum" /&gt;

{{Politics of Basque Country (autonomous community)}}
The '''Herritarren Zerrenda''' ('''HZ''', {{lang-en|List of Fellow Citizens}}; {{Lang-es|Lista de Conciudadanos}}) is a [[Basque nationalism|Basque nationalist]] [[political party]] in [[Spain]] and [[France]], created in 2004 to run in the [[European Parliament election, 2004|European Parliament election]]. Since these elections were simultaneous throughout the [[European Union]], and states were represented as single [[Constituency|constituencies]], Herritarren Zerrenda aspired for results at the national level in both countries.

HZ aspired to group and represent the [[Abertzale]] [[left-wing|Left]], including the outlawed [[Batasuna]] (as [[Autodeterminaziorako Bilgunea]] had done a year before). In France they ran on a single list with Batasuna (as the party is not illegal north of the border) - a fact which did not constitute a violation of the Spanish laws. 

In Spain, HZ counted on obtaining seats in [[Strasbourg]] (as Batasuna and its coalition ''Euskal Herritarrok'' had previously done). The possibility was slimmer in France, due to the small percentage of [[Basque people|Basques]] of [[Northern Basque Country|Iparralde]] in the country as a whole, as well as to the reduced support for Batasuna.

In the end, HZ called for a [[blank vote]], and its voters cast ballots valid only in the French constituency. The group dissolved after the elections.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35228">The '''military funding of science''' has had a powerful transformative effect on the practice and products of [[scientific research]] since the early 20th century.  Particularly since [[World War I]], [[military technology|advanced science-based technologies]] have been viewed as essential elements of a successful military.

World War I is often called "the chemists’ war", both for the extensive [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] and the importance of [[nitrates]] and advanced [[high explosive]]s.   Poison gas, beginning in 1915 with [[chlorine]] from the powerful German dye industry, was used extensively by the Germans and the British ; over the course of the war, scientists on both sides raced to develop more and more potent chemicals and devise countermeasures against the newest enemy gases.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, Robert and Jeremy Paxman.  ''A Higher Form of Killing: The Secret History of Chemical and Biological Warfare''.  2002.  Chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  Physicists also contributed to the war effort, developing wireless communication technologies and sound-based methods of detecting [[U-boat]]s, resulting in the first tenuous long-term connections between academic science and the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  ''The Physicists: The History of a Scientific Community in Modern America''.  New York: Alfred K. Knopf, 1971. pp 137-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] marked a massive increase in the military funding of science, particularly physics.  In addition to the [[Manhattan Project]] and the resulting [[nuclear weapon|atomic bomb]], British and American work on [[radar]] was widespread and ultimately highly influential in the course of the war; radar enabled detection of enemy ships and aircraft, as well as the radar-based [[proximity fuze]].  Mathematical [[cryptography]], [[meteorology]], and [[aerospace engineering|rocket science]] were also central to the war effort, with military-funded wartime advances having a significant long-term effect on each discipline.  The technologies employed at the end&amp;mdash;[[jet aircraft]], radar and proximity fuzes, and the atomic bomb&amp;mdash;were radically different from pre-war technology; military leaders came to view continued advances in technology as the critical element for success in future wars.  The advent of the [[Cold War]] solidified the links between military institutions and academic science, particularly in the [[United States]] and the [[Soviet Union]], so that even during a period of nominal peace military funding continued to expand.  Funding spread to the [[social sciences]] as well as the [[natural sciences]], and whole new fields, such as [[digital computing]], were born of military patronage.  Following the [[Cold War (1985-1991)|end of the Cold War]] and the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], military funding of science has decreased substantially, but much of the American [[military-scientific complex]] remains in place.

The sheer scale of military funding for science since World War II has instigated a large body of historical literature analyzing the effects of that funding, especially for American science.  Since [[Paul Forman]]’s 1987 article “Behind quantum electronics: National security as a basis for physical research in the United State, 1940-1960,” there has been an ongoing historical debate over precisely how and to what extent military funding affected the course of scientific research and discovery.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, Paul.  "Behind quantum electronics: National security as basis for physical research in the United States, 1940-1960," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 18, Pt. 1, pp 149-229.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others have argued that military funding fundamentally redirected science—particularly physics—toward applied research, and that military technologies predominantly formed the basis for subsequent research even in areas of basic science; ultimately the very culture and ideals of science were colored by extensive collaboration between scientists and military planners.  An alternate view has been presented by [[Daniel Kevles]], that while military funding provided many new opportunities for scientists and dramatically expanded the scope of physical research, scientists by-and-large retained their intellectual autonomy.

==Science and military technology before the modern era==

While there were numerous instances of military support for scientific work before the 20th century, these were typically isolated instances; knowledge gained from technology was generally far more important for the development of science than scientific knowledge was to technological innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, Barton C.  "The Machines of War: Western Military Technology 1850-2000."  ''History and Technology'', Vol. 21, No. 3, September 2005, pp 255-300.  p 255.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Thermodynamics]], for example, is a science partly born from military technology: one of the many sources of the [[first law of thermodynamics]] was [[Count Rumford]]’s observation of the heat produced by boring [[cannon]] barrels.&lt;ref&gt;von Baeyer, Hans Christian.  ''Warmth Disperses and Time Passes: The History of Heat''.  New York: The Modern Library, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mathematics was important in the development of the Greek [[catapult]] and other weapons,&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," footnote 1.&lt;/ref&gt; but analysis of [[ballistics]] was also important for the development of mathematics, while [[Galileo]] tried to promote the telescope as a military instrument to the military-minded [[Republic of Venice]] before turning it to the skies while seeking the [[patronage]] of the [[Medici]] court in Florence.&lt;ref&gt;Biagioli, Mario.  ''Galileo, Courtier: The Practice of Science in the Culture of Absolutism''.  Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;  In general, craft-based innovation, disconnected from the formal systems of science, was the key to military technology well into the 19th century.

[[Image:Interchangeable parts.gif|thumb|left|200px|Interchangeable gun parts, illustrated in the 1832 ''Edinburgh Encyclopaedia'']]
Even craft-based military technologies were not generally produced by military funding.  Instead, craftsmen and inventors developed weapons and military tools independently and actively sought the interest of military patrons afterward.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, "The Machines of War," p 256.&lt;/ref&gt;  Following the rise of [[engineering]] as a profession in the 18th century, governments and military leaders did try to harness the methods of both science and engineering for more specific ends, but frequently without success.   In the decades leading up to the [[French Revolution]], French artillery officers were often trained as engineers, and military leaders from this mathematical tradition attempted to transform the process of weapons manufacture from a craft-based enterprise to an organized and standardized system based on engineering principles and [[interchangeable parts]] (pre-dating the work of [[Eli Whitney]] in the U.S.).  During the Revolution, even natural scientists participated directly, attempting to create “weapons more powerful than any we possess” to aid the cause of the new French Republic, though there were no means for the revolutionary army to fund such work.&lt;ref&gt;Gillispie, Charles Coulston.  "Science and secret weapons development in Revolutionary France, 1792–1804."  ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 23, No. 1, pp 35–152.  Quote from excerpt of [[Georges Cuvier]]’s eulogy of [[Claude-Louis Berthollet]], p 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Each of these efforts, however, was ultimately unsuccessful in producing militarily useful results.  A slightly different outcome came from the longitude prize of the 18th century, offered by the British government for an accurate method of determining a ship’s [[longitude]] at sea (essential for the safe navigation of the powerful British navy): intended to promote—and financially reward—a scientific solution, it was instead won by a scientific outsider, the clockmaker [[John Harrison]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Sobel, Dava]].  ''[[Longitude: The True Story of a Lone Genius Who Solved the Greatest Scientific Problem of His Time]]''.  Penguin, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the naval utility of [[astronomy]] did help increase the number of capable astronomers and focus research on developing more powerful and versatile instruments.

Through the 19th century, science and technology grew closer together, particularly through electrical and acoustic inventions and the corresponding mathematical theories.  The late 19th and early 20th centuries witnessed a trend toward military mechanization, with the advent of repeating rifles with [[smokeless powder]], long-range artillery, [[high explosive]]s, [[machine gun]]s, and mechanized transport along with [[telegraph]]ic and later [[wireless telegraph|wireless]] battlefield communication.  Still, independent inventors, scientists and engineers were largely responsible for these drastic changes in military technology (with the exception of the development of [[battleship]]s, which could only have been created through organized large-scale effort).&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, “The Machines of War,” pp 256-257.&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War I and the interwar years==
{{see also|Technology during World War I}}
[[World War I]] marked the first large-scale mobilization of science for military purposes.  Prior to the war, the American military ran a few small laboratories as well as the [[United States Bureau of Standards|Bureau of Standards]], but independent inventors and industrial firms predominated.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 103-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly in Europe, military-directed scientific research and development was minimal.  The powerful new technologies that led to [[trench warfare]], however, reversed the traditional advantage of fast-moving offensive tactics; fortified positions supported by machine guns and artillery resulted in high attrition but strategic stalemate.  Militaries turned to scientists and engineers for even newer technologies, but the introduction of [[tank]]s and [[aircraft]] had only a marginal impact; the [[Poison gas in World War I|use of poison gas]] made a tremendous psychological impact, but decisively favored neither side.  The war ultimately turned on maintaining adequate supplies of materials, a problem also addressed by military-funded science&amp;mdash;and, through the international chemical industry, closely related to the advent of chemical warfare.

The Germans introduced gas as a weapon in part because [[naval blockade]]s limited their supply of [[nitrate]] for explosives, while the massive German [[dye]] industry could easily produce [[chlorine]] and [[organic chemical]]s in large amounts.  Industrial capacity was completely mobilized for war, and [[Fritz Haber]] and other industrial scientists were eager to contribute to the German cause; soon they were closely integrated into the military hierarchy as they tested the most effective ways of producing and delivering weaponized chemicals.  Though the initial impetus for gas warfare came from outside the military, further developments in chemical weapon technology might be considered military-funded, considering the blurring of lines between industry and nation in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Harris and Paxman, ''A Higher Form of Killing'',  pp 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:British 55th Division gas casualties 10 April 1918.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Poison gas casualties from the [[Battle of Estaires]], April 10, 1918]]
Following the first chlorine attack by the Germans in May 1915, the British quickly moved to recruit scientists for developing their own gas weapons.  Gas research escalated on both sides, with chlorine followed by [[phosgene]], a variety of [[tear gas]]es, and [[mustard gas]].  A wide array of research was conducted on the physiological effects of other gases, such and [[hydrogen cyanide]], [[arsenic]] compounds, and a host of complex organic chemicals.  The British built from scratch what became an expansive research facility at [[Porton Down]], which remains a significant military research institution into the 21st century.  Unlike many earlier military-funded scientific ventures, the research at Porton Down did not stop when the war ended or an immediate goal was achieved.  In fact, every effort was made to create an attractive research environment for top scientists, and chemical weapons development continued apace&amp;mdash;though in secret&amp;mdash;through the interwar years and into World War II.  German military-backed gas warfare research did not resume until the Nazi era, following the 1936 discovery of [[tabun (nerve agent)|tabun]], the first nerve agent, through industrial [[insecticide]] research.

In the United States, the established tradition of engineering was explicitly competing with the rising discipline of physics for World War I military largess.  A host of inventors, led by [[Thomas Edison]] and his newly created [[Naval Consulting Board]], cranked out thousands of inventions to solve military problems and aid the war effort, while academic scientists worked through the [[United States National Research Council|National Research Council]] (NRC) led by [[Robert Millikan]].  [[Submarine]] detection was the most important problem that both the physicists and inventors hoped to solve, as German [[U-boat]]s were decimating the crucial naval supply lines from the U.S. to England.  Edison’s Board produced very few useful innovations, but NRC research resulted in a moderately successful sound-based methods for locating submarines and hidden ground-based artillery, as well as useful navigational and photographic equipment for aircraft.  Because of the success of academic science in solving specific military problems, the NRC was retained after the war’s end, though it gradually decoupled from the military.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp 102-154&lt;/ref&gt;

Many industrial and academic chemists and physicists came under military control during the Great War, but post-war research by the Royal Engineers Experimental Station at Porton Down and the continued operation of the National Research Council were exceptions to the overall pattern; wartime chemistry funding was a temporary redirection of a field largely driven by industry and later medicine, while physics grew closer to industry than to the military.  The discipline of modern meteorology, however, was largely built from military funding.  During World War I, the French civilian meteorological infrastructure was largely absorbed into the military.  The introduction of military aircraft during the war as well as the role of wind and weather in the success or failure of gas attacks meant meteorological advice was in high demand.  The French army (among others) created its own supplementary meteorological service as well, retraining scientists from other fields to staff it.  At war's end, the military continued to control French meteorology, sending weathermen to French colonial interests and integrating weather service with the growing air corps; most of the early-twentieth century growth in European meteorology was the direct result of military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Pyenson, Lewis and Susan Sheets-Pyenson.  ''Servants of Nature: A History of Scientific Institutions, Enterprises, and Sensibilities''.  New York: HarperCollins Publishers, 1999.  pp 309-311.&lt;/ref&gt;   World War II would result in a similar transformation of American meteorology, initiating a transition from an [[apprenticeship]] system for training weathermen (based on intimate knowledge of local trends and geography) to the university-based, science-intensive system that has predominated since.

==World War II==
{{see also|Technology during World War II}}
If World War I was the chemists’ war, World War II was the physicists’ war.  As with other [[total war]]s, it is difficult to draw a line between military funding and more spontaneous military-scientific collaboration during World War II.  Well before the [[Polish September Campaign|Invasion of Poland]], [[nationalism]] was a powerful force in the German physics community (see [[Deutsche Physik]]); the military mobilization of physicists was all but irresistible after the rise of [[National Socialism]].  German and Allied investigations of the possibility of a nuclear bomb began in 1939 at the initiative of civilian scientists, but by 1942 the respective militaries were heavily involved.  The [[German nuclear energy project]] had two independent teams, a civilian-controlled team under [[Werner Heisenberg]] and a military-controlled led by [[Kurt Diebner]]; the latter was more explicitly aimed at producing a bomb (as opposed to a power reactor) and received much more funding from the Nazis, though neither was ultimately successful.&lt;ref&gt;The extent to which Heisenberg’s team was devoted to aiding the Nazi’s by producing an atomic bomb is a matter of some historical dispute.  However, most recent scholarship suggests that the stagnation of the German project stemmed from Heisenberg’s doubts about the feasibility rather than the desirability of a Nazi bomb.  See: Rose, Paul Lawrence.  ''Heisenberg and the Nazi Atomic Bomb Project: A Study in German Culture''.  Berkeley: University of California Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S., the [[Manhattan Project]] and other projects of the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] resulted in a much more extensive military-scientific venture, the scale of which dwarfed previous military-funded research projects.  Theoretical work by a number of British and American scientists resulted in significant optimism about the possibility of a [[nuclear chain reaction]]. As the physicists convinced military leaders of the potential of nuclear weapons, funding for actual development was ratcheted up rapidly.  A number of large laboratories were created across the United States for work on different aspects of the bomb, while many existing facilities were reoriented to bomb-related work; some were university-managed while others were government-run, but all were ultimately funded and directed by the military.&lt;ref&gt;[[Los Alamos National Laboratory]], the University of Chicago’s [[Metallurgical Laboratory]] (now [[Argonne National Laboratory]]), [[Hanford Site]] (now defunct), and [[Oak Ridge National Laboratory]] were all created during the Manhattan Project, while Berkeley’s [[Radiation Laboratory]] and smaller labs across the country became part of the project as well.  Among others, see: Smyth, Henry DeWolf.  [[Smyth Report|''Atomic Energy for Military Purposes: The Official Report on the Development of the Atomic Bomb under the Auspices of the United States Government, 1940-1945]]''.   Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1945. Rhodes, Richard. ''The Making of the Atomic Bomb''.  New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  The May 1945 surrender of Germany, the original intended target for the bomb, did virtually nothing to slow the project’s momentum.  After Japan’s surrender immediately following the [[atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki]], many scientists returned to academia or industry, but the Manhattan Project infrastructure was too large—and too effective—to be dismantled wholesale; it became the model for future military-scientific work, in the U.S. and elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, ''The Physicists'', pp. 324-348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other wartime physics research, particularly in [[rocket]]ry and radar technology, was less significant in popular culture but much more significant for the outcome of the war.  German rocketry was driven by the pursuit of ''[[Wunderwaffe]]n'', resulting in the [[V-2 rocket|V-2]] [[ballistic missile]]; the technology as well as the personal expertise of the German rocketry community was absorbed by the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. rocket programs after the war, forming the basis of long-term military funded rocketry, ballistic missile, and later space research.  Rocket science was only beginning to make impact by the final years of the war.  German rockets created fear and destruction in London, but had only modest military significance, while air-to-ground rockets enhanced the power of American air strikes; [[jet aircraft]] also went into service by the end of the war.&lt;ref&gt;Hacker, ''The Machines of War,'' p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt;  Radar work before and during the war provided even more of an advantage for the Allies.  British physicists pioneered [[long-wave radar]], developing an effective system for detecting incoming German air forces.  Work on potentially more precise [[short-wave radar]] was turned over to the U.S.; several thousand academic physicists and engineers not participating the Manhattan Project did radar work, particularly at MIT and Stanford, resulting in [[microwave]] radar systems that could resolve more detail in incoming flight formations.  Further refinement of microwave technology led to proximity fuzes, which greatly enhanced the ability of the U.S. Navy to defend against Japanese bombers.  Microwave production, detection and manipulation also formed the technical foundation to complement the institutional foundation of the Manhattan Project in much post-war defense research.

==American Cold War science==
In the years immediately following World War II, the military was by far the most significant patron of university science research in the U.S., and the national labs also continued to flourish.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970," ''Osiris'' (2nd series), Vol. 7, 1992, ''Science after '40'', pp 26-48.  p 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  After two years in political limbo (but with work on nuclear power and bomb manufacture continuing apace) the Manhattan Project became a permanent arm of the government as the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]].  The Navy—inspired by the success of military-directed wartime research—created its own R&amp;D organization, the [[Office of Naval Research]], which would preside over an expanded long-term research program at [[Naval Research Laboratory]] as well as fund a variety of university-based research.  Military money following up the wartime radar research led to explosive growth in both [[electronics]] research and electronics manufacturing.&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," pp 159-160.&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[United States Air Force|Air Force]] became an independent service branch from the Army and established its own research and development system, and the Army followed suit (though it was less invested in academic science than the Navy or Air Force).  Meanwhile, the perceived communist menace of the Soviet Union caused tensions—and military budgets—to escalate rapidly.

The [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] primarily funded what has been broadly described as “physical research,” but to reduce this to merely chemistry and physics is misleading.  Military patronage benefited a large number of fields, and in fact helped create a number of the modern [[scientific discipline]]s.  At [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology|MIT]], for example, electronics, [[aerospace engineering]], [[nuclear physics]], and [[materials science]]&amp;mdash;all physics, broadly speaking&amp;mdash;each developed in different directions, becoming increasingly independent of parent disciplines as they grew and pursued defense-related research agendas.  What began as interdepartmental laboratories became the centers for graduate teaching and research innovation thanks to the broad scope of defense funding.  The need to keep up with corporate technology research (which was receiving the lion’s share of defense contracts) also prompted many science labs to establish close relationships with industry.&lt;ref&gt;Leslie, Stuart.  ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''.  New York: Columbian University Press, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Computing===
The complex histories of [[history of computer science|computer science]] and [[history of computer hardware|computer engineering]] were shaped, in the first decades of digital computing, almost entirely by military funding.  Most of the basic component technologies for digital computing were developed through the course of the long-running [[Whirlwind (computer)|Whirlwind]]-[[Semi Automatic Ground Environment|SAGE]] program to develop an automated radar shield.  Virtually unlimited funds enabled two decades of research that only began producing useful technologies by the end of the 50s; even the final version of the SAGE command and control system had only marginal military utility.  More so than with previously-established disciplines receiving military funding, the culture of computer science was permeated with a [[Cold War]] military perspective.  Indirectly, the ideas of computer science also had a profound effect on [[psychology]], [[cognitive science]] and [[neuroscience]] through the mind-computer analogy.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards, Paul  ''The Closed World: Computers and the Politics of Discourse in Cold War America''.  Cambridge: MIT Press, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Geosciences and astrophysics===
The [[Outline of earth science|history of earth science]] and the [[history of astrophysics]] were also closely tied to military purposes and funding throughout the Cold War.  American [[geodesy]], [[oceanography]], and [[seismology]] grew from small sub-disciplines in into full-fledged independent disciplines as for several decades, virtually all funding in these fields came from the Department of Defense.  A central goal that tied these disciplines together (even while providing the means for intellectual independence) was the [[figure of the Earth]], the model of the earth’s [[geography]] and [[gravitation]] that was essential for accurate ballistic missiles.  In the 1960s, geodesy was the superficial goal of the satellite program [[Corona (satellite)|CORONA]], while military [[reconnaissance]] was in fact a driving force.  Even for geodetic data, new secrecy guidelines worked to restrict collaboration in a field that had formerly been fundamentally international; the Figure of the Earth had geopolitical significance beyond questions of pure geoscience.  Still, geodesists were able to retain enough autonomy and subvert secrecy limitations enough to make use of the findings of their military research to overturn some of the fundamental theories of geodesy.&lt;ref&gt;Cloud, John.  "Crossing the Olentangy River: The Figure of the Earth and the Military-Industrial-Academic-Complex, 1947-1972," ''Studies in the History and Philosophy of Modern Physics'', Vol. 31, No. 3, pp 371-404. 2000
Cloud, John.  "Imaging the World in a Barrel: CORONA and the Clandestine Convergence of the Earth Sciences," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 231-251.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Like geodesy and satellite photography research, the advent of [[radio astronomy]] had a military purpose hidden beneath official astrophysical research agenda.  Quantum electronics permitted both revolutionary new methods of analyzing the universe and&amp;mdash;using the same equipment and technology&amp;mdash;the monitoring of Soviet electronic signals.&lt;ref&gt;van Keuren, David K.  "Cold War Science in Black and White: US Intelligence Gathering and Its Scientific Cover at the Naval Research Laboratory, 1948-62," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, pp 207-229.  April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Military interest in (and funding of) seismology, meteorology and oceanography was in some ways a result of the defense-related payoffs of physics and geodesy.  The immediate goal of funding in these fields was to detect clandestine [[nuclear testing]] and track [[nuclear fallout|fallout radiation]], a necessary precondition for treaties to limit the nuclear weapon technology earlier military research had created.  In particular, the feasibility of monitoring underground nuclear explosions was crucial to the possibility of a [[Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty|comprehensive]] rather than [[Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty]].&lt;ref&gt;Barth, Kai-Henrik.  "The Politics of Seismology: Nuclear Testing, Arms Control, and the Transformation of a Discipline," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 33, No. 5, pp 743-781.  October 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;  But the military-funded growth of these disciplines continued even when no pressing military goals were driving them; as with other natural sciences, the military also found value in having ‘scientists on tap’ for unforeseen future R&amp;D needs.&lt;ref&gt;Mukerji, Chandra.  ''A Fragile Power: Scientists and the State''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological sciences===
The [[biology|biological sciences]] were also affected by military funding, but, with the exception of nuclear physics-related medical and genetic research, largely indirectly.  The most significant funding sources for basic research before the rise of the military-industrial-academic complex were philanthropic organizations such as the [[Rockefeller Foundation]].  After World War II (and to some extent before), the influx of new industrial and military funding opportunities for the physical sciences prompted philanthropies to divest from physics research&amp;mdash;most early work in high-energy physics and biophysics had been the product of foundation grants&amp;mdash;and refocus on biological and medical research.

The [[social sciences]] also found limited military support from the 1940s to the 1960s, but much defense-minded social science research could be—and was—pursued without extensive military funding.  In the 1950s, social scientists tried to emulate the interdisciplinary organizational success of the physical sciences’ Manhattan Project with the synthetic [[behavioral science movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Though somewhat related, "behavioral science" in this context should not be confused with the [[behavioral sciences]] or [[radical behaviorism|behaviorism]], the strictly mechanistic approach to psychology promoted by B. F. Skinner.  See: Robin, Ron.  ''The Making of the Cold War Enemy: Culture and Politics in the Military-Intellectual Complex''.  Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social scientists actively sought to promote their usefulness to the military, researching topics related to [[propaganda]] (put to use in [[Korean War|Korea]]), decision making, the psychological and sociological causes and effects of [[communism]], and a broad constellation of other topics of Cold War significance.  By the 1960s, economists and political scientists offered up [[modernization theory]] for the cause of Cold War [[nation-building]]; modernization theory found a home in the military in the form of [[Project Camelot]], a study of the process of revolution, as well as in the [[John F. Kennedy|Kennedy administration]]’s approach to the [[Vietnam War]].  Project Camelot was ultimately canceled because of the concerns it raised about scientific [[Objectivity (science)|objectivity]] in the context of such a politicized research agenda; though natural sciences were not yet susceptible to implications of the corrupting influence of military and political factors, the social sciences were.&lt;ref&gt;For modernization theory, and its role in the Vietnam War, see: Latham, Michael E.  ''Modernization as Ideology: American Social Science and "Nation-Building" in the Kennedy Era''.  Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press, 2000.

==Historical debate==
Historian [[Paul Forman]], in his seminal 1987 article, proposed that not only had military funding of science greatly expanded the scope and significance of American physics, it also initiated "a qualitative change in its purposes and character."&lt;ref&gt;Forman, "Behind quantum electronics," p 150.&lt;/ref&gt;  Historians of science were beginning to turn to the Cold War relationship between science and the military for detailed study, and Forman’s “distortionist critique” (as [[Roger Geiger]] has described it) served to focus the ensuing debates.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, Roger.  "Review of ''The Cold War and American Science: The Military-Industrial-Academic Complex at MIT and Stanford''," ''Technology and Culture'', Vol. 34 pp 629-631.  1994.&lt;/ref&gt;  Forman and others (e.g., [[Robert Seidel]], Stuart Leslie, and for the history of the social sciences, [[Ron Robin]]) view the influx of military money and the focus on applied rather than basic research as having had, at least partially, a negative impact on the course of subsequent research.  In turn, critics of the distortionist thesis, beginning with [[Daniel Kevles]], deny that the military "seduced American physicists from, so to speak, a 'true basic physics'."&lt;ref&gt;Kevles, Daniel J.  "Cold war and hot physics: Science, security, and the American state, 1945-56," ''Historical Studies in the Physical and Biological Sciences'', Vol. 20, No. 2, pp 239-264.  1990.&lt;/ref&gt;  Kevles, as well as Geiger, instead view the effects of military funding relative to such funding simply being absent—rather than put to alternate scientific use.&lt;ref&gt;Geiger, “Science, Universities, and National Defense, 1945-1970.”  See also: Geiger, Roger.  ''Knowledge &amp; Money: Research Universities and the Paradox of the Marketplace''.  Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2004.
In Geiger’s broad analysis of the relationship between political economy and academic research, the character and purpose of funding sources play little role, and there is no discussion of the distinctiveness of military funding.  Rather, such funding is significant only in the context of ‘[[crowding out (economics)|crowding out]]’ other economic forces.&lt;/ref&gt;  Most recent scholarship has moved toward a tempered version of Forman's thesis, in which scientists retained significant autonomy despite the radical changes brought about by military funding.&lt;ref&gt;Hounshell, David A.  "Epilogue: Rethinking the Cold War; Rethinking Science and Technology in the Cold War; Rethinking the Social Study of Science and Technology," ''Social Studies of Science'', Vol. 31, No. 2, April 2001, pp 289-297.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abraham Lincoln head on shoulders photo portrait.jpg|thumb|[[Abraham Lincoln]], the first [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[President of the United States|President]] (1861–1865)]]
The [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]], also referred to as the GOP (abbreviation for Grand Old Party), is one of the world's oldest extant [[Political party|political parties]]. The party values reflect [[economic conservatism]], [[classical conservatism]] (modern day [[American conservatism]]) and [[Corporate personhood|corporate liberty rights]]. It is the second oldest existing [[Political parties of the United States|political party in the United States]] after its primary rival, the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]]. The party emerged in 1854 to combat the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], an act that dissolved the terms of the [[Missouri Compromise]] and allowed slave or free status to be decided in the territories by popular sovereignty. The early Republican Party had almost no presence in the [[Southern United States]], but by 1858 it had enlisted former [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]] and former [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] to form majorities in nearly every Northern state.

With its election of [[Abraham Lincoln]] in 1860 and its success in guiding the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]] to victory in the [[American Civil War]] and abolishing slavery, the party came to dominate the national political scene until 1932. The Republican Party at its beginning consisted of African-American and White Northern [[Protestantism|Protestants]], [[Businessperson|businessmen]], [[small business]] owners, [[professional]]s, [[factory worker]]s, and [[farmer]]s. It was [[Market economy|pro-business]], supporting [[Banking in the United States|banks]], the [[gold standard]], [[Rail transportation in the United States|railroads]] and [[Protectionism|high tariffs]] to protect factory workers and grow industry faster. Under [[William McKinley]] and [[Theodore Roosevelt]], it emphasized an expansive [[foreign policy]].

The GOP lost its majorities during the [[Great Depression]] (1929–1940). Instead, the Democrats under [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] formed a winning [[New Deal coalition]], which was dominant from 1932 through 1964. That coalition collapsed in the mid-1960s, partly because of white [[Southern Democrats]]' disaffection with the passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]]. Republicans won five of the six [[United States presidential election|presidential elections]] from 1968 to 1988, with [[Ronald Reagan]] as the party's iconic [[Conservatism in the United States|conservative]] hero. From 1992 to 2016, the Republican candidate has been elected to the [[White House]] in three of the seven presidential elections. Two of these (the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000]] and [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016]] elections) saw [[George W. Bush]] and [[Donald Trump]] losing the [[Plurality voting|popular vote]], but winning the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]]. A similar situation in which [[United States presidential elections in which the winner lost the popular vote|Republicans won the Electoral College, but lost the popular vote]] were the [[United States presidential election, 1876|1876]] and [[United States presidential election, 1888|1888]] elections.

The Republican Party expanded its base throughout the South after 1968 (excepting 1976), largely due to its strength among [[Social conservatism|socially conservative]] white [[evangelical Protestant]]s and [[Traditionalist Catholic|traditionalist]] [[Roman Catholics]]. As white Democrats in the South lost dominance of the Democratic Party once American courts declared the [[White primaries|Democratic white primary elections]] unconstitutional, the region began taking on the [[Two-party system|two-party]] apparatus which characterized most of the nation. The Republican Party's transforming leader by 1980 was Reagan, whose conservative policies called for reduced [[government spending]] and [[regulation]], [[Tax cuts|lower taxes]] and a strong anti-[[Soviet Union]] foreign policy.

Reagan's influence upon the party persists as nearly every Republican Party speaker still reveres him. As such, social scientists Theodore Caplow et al. argue: "The Republican party, nationally, moved from right-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved right again in the 1970s and 1980s".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Theodore Caplow|author2=Howard M. Bahr|author3=Bruce A. Chadwick|author4=John Modell|title=Recent Social Trends in the United States, 1960–1990|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwBvm8aF2bsC&amp;pg=PA337|year=1994|publisher=McGill-Queen's Press|page=337}} They add: "The Democratic party, nationally, moved from left-center toward the center in the 1940s and 1950s, then moved further toward the right-center in the 1970s and 1980s".&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ideological beginnings ==
{{see also|Third Party System}}
The Republican Party began as a coalition of anti-slavery [[Conscience Whigs]] such as [[Zachariah Chandler]] and [[Free Soil Party|Free Soil]] [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] such as [[Salmon P. Chase]], who were opposed to the [[Kansas–Nebraska Act]], submitted to Congress by [[Stephen Douglas]] in January 1854. The Act opened [[Kansas Territory]] and [[Nebraska Territory]] to slavery and future admission as [[slave state]]s, thus implicitly repealing the prohibition on slavery in territory north of [[36° 30′ latitude]], which had been part of the [[Missouri Compromise]]. This change was viewed by Free Soil and [[Abolitionism|abolitionist]] Northerners as an aggressive, expansionist maneuver by the slave-owning South.

The Act was supported by all Southerners,{{citation needed|date=May 2018}} by Northern "[[doughface]]" (pro-Southern) Democrats and by other Northern Democrats persuaded by Douglas' doctrine of "[[popular sovereignty in the United States#Emergence of the term|popular sovereignty]]". In the North, the old Whig Party was almost defunct. The opponents were intensely motivated and began forming a new party.&lt;ref name="Eric Foner 1970"&gt;Eric Foner, ''Free soil, free labor, free men: the ideology of the Republican Party before the Civil War''(1970).&lt;/ref&gt;

The new party went well beyond the issue of slavery in the territories. It envisioned modernizing the United States—emphasizing giving free western land to farmers ("free soil") as opposed to letting slave owners buy up the best lands, expanded banking, more railroads and factories. They vigorously argued that [[free market]] labor was superior to slavery and the very foundation of civic virtue and true [[Republicanism in the United States|republicanism]]—this was the "Free Soil, Free Labor, Free Men" ideology.&lt;ref name="Eric Foner 1970"/&gt;

The Republicans absorbed the previous traditions of its members, most of whom had been [[Whig Party (United States)|Whigs]], while others had been Democrats or members of third parties (especially the [[Free Soil Party]] and the [[Know Nothing|American Party]], also known as the Know Nothings). Many [[History of the United States Democratic Party|Democrats]] who joined were rewarded with governorships,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Including [[Nathaniel P. Banks]] of Massachusetts, [[Kinsley Bingham]] of Michigan, [[William H. Bissell]] of Illinois, [[Salmon P. Chase]] of Ohio, [[Hannibal Hamlin]] of Maine, [[Samuel J. Kirkwood]] of Iowa, [[Ralph Metcalf (New Hampshire politician)|Ralph Metcalf]] of New Hampshire, [[Lot Morrill]] of Maine and [[Alexander Randall]] of Wisconsin.&lt;/ref&gt; or seats in the U.S. Senate,&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;Including Bingham and Hamlin, as well as [[James R. Doolittle]] of Wisconsin, [[John P. Hale]] of New Hampshire, [[Preston King (politician)|Preston King]] of New York, [[Lyman Trumbull]] of Illinois and [[David Wilmot]] of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; or House of Representatives.&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;[[William D. Kelley]] of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Since its inception, its chief opposition has been the Democratic Party, but the amount of flow back and forth of prominent politicians between the two parties was quite high from 1854 to 1896.

Historians have explored the ethnocultural foundations of the party, along the line that ethnic and religious groups set the moral standards for their members, who then carried those standards into politics. The churches also provided social networks that politicians used to sign up voters. The pietistic churches emphasized the duty of the Christian to purge sin from society. Sin took many forms—alcoholism, polygamy and slavery became special targets for the Republicans.&lt;ref name="Kleppner 1979"&gt;Kleppner (1979) has extensive detail on the voting behavior of groups.&lt;/ref&gt;

New England Yankees, who dominated that region and much of upstate New York and the upper Midwest, were the strongest supporters of the new party. This was especially true for the [[Pietism#Impact on party voting in United States and Great Britain|pietistic]] Congregationalists and Presbyterians among them and, during the war, many Methodists and Scandinavian Lutherans. The Quakers were a small, tight-knit group that was heavily Republican. By contrast, the liturgical churches (Roman Catholic, Episcopal and German Lutheran) largely rejected the moralism of the Republican Party; most of their adherents voted Democratic.&lt;ref name="Kleppner 1979"/&gt;

The early standard bearers of the party expressed views of government that marked the first years of its existence. For instance, [[William H. Seward]], New York governor who vied with Lincoln for the nomination in 1860, had called for welcoming immigrants with "all the sympathy that their misfortunes at home, their condition as strangers here, and their devotion to liberty, ought to excite".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goodwin|first1=Doris Kearns|title=Team of Rivals The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln|date=2005|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|isbn=978-0-684-82490-1|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1861 message to Congress, Lincoln argued that the essential reason for preserving the central government was to maintain "in the world, that form, and substance of government, whose leading object is to elevate the condition of men — to lift artificial weights from all shoulders — to clear the paths of laudable pursuit for all — to afford all, an unfettered start, and a fair chance, in the race of life".&lt;ref&gt;Goodwin, p. 367.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organizational beginnings ==
The first [[Anti-Nebraska movement|anti-Nebraska]] local meeting where Republican was suggested as a name for a new anti-slavery party was held in a [[Ripon, Wisconsin]] schoolhouse on March 20, 1854.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.wisconsinhistory.org/cdm4/document.php?CISOROOT=/tp&amp;CISOPTR=46379&amp;CISOSHOW=46363 ''The Origin of the Republican Party''] by Prof. A. F. Gilman, Ripon College, WI, 1914.&lt;/ref&gt; The first statewide convention that formed a platform and nominated candidates under the name Republican was held near [[Jackson, Michigan]] on July 6, 1854. It declared their new party opposed to the expansion of slavery into new territories and selected a statewide slate of candidates. The Midwest took the lead in forming state party tickets while the eastern states lagged a year or so. There were no efforts to organize the party in the South, apart from St. Louis and a few areas adjacent to free states. The party initially had its base in the Northeast and Midwest.

[[File:1856-Republican-party-Fremont-isms-caricature.jpg|thumb|This [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] editorial cartoon links [[John C. Frémont]] to other radical movements including [[temperance movement|temperance]], [[feminism]], [[Fourierism]], [[free love]], [[Catholicism]] and [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition]]]]

== Establishing a national party and opposition ==
The party launched its first national convention in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] on February 22, 1856,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Republicanism in Wisconsin|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Gazette|date=February 1, 1856|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; with its [[1856 Republican National Convention|first national nominating convention]] held in the summer in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ushistory.org/gop/origins.htm The Origins of the Republican Party&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120930194002/http://www.ushistory.org/gop/origins.htm|date=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; presided by [[Francis Preston Blair]].

[[John C. Frémont]] ran as the first Republican nominee for [[United States presidential election, 1856|President in 1856]] behind the slogan: "Free soil, free silver, free men, Frémont and victory!" and although Frémont's bid was unsuccessful, the party showed a strong base. It dominated in New England, New York and the northern Midwest and had a strong presence in the rest of the North.It had almost no support in the South, where it was roundly denounced in 1856–1860 as a divisive force that threatened civil war.&lt;ref name="Gould 2003"&gt;Gould 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

Without using the term "[[containment]]", the new party in the mid-1850s proposed a system of containing slavery, once it gained control of the national government. Historian [[James Oakes (historian)|James Oakes]] explains the strategy: &lt;blockquote&gt;The federal government would surround the south with free states, free territories, and free waters, building what they called a 'cordon of freedom' around slavery, hemming it in until the system's own internal weaknesses forced the slave states one by one to abandon slavery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Oakes|title=Freedom National: The Destruction of Slavery in the United States, 1861–1865|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MaVp-YES1F0C&amp;pg=PR12|year=2012|publisher=W. W. Norton|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Leading up to the second presidential election after the party's establishment, disdain for it grew considerably among Democrats, particularly those from the South. In reference to the Republicans' anti-slavery position, prominent Democrats applied the slur "[[List of African-American Republicans|Black Republican]]" against them, as seen repeatedly in the speeches of Senator [[Stephen Douglas]] during the [[Lincoln–Douglas debates]] of 1858 in Illinois. During the presidential campaign in 1860, at a time of escalating tension between the North and South, Abraham Lincoln addressed the harsh treatment of Republicans in the South in his famous [[Cooper Union speech]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hen you speak of us Republicans, you do so only to denounce us as reptiles, or, at the best, as no better than outlaws. You will grant a hearing to pirates or murderers, but nothing like it to "Black Republicans." [...] But you will not abide the election of a Republican president! In that supposed event, you say, you will destroy the Union; and then, you say, the great crime of having destroyed it will be upon us! That is cool. A highwayman holds a pistol to my ear, and mutters through his teeth, "Stand and deliver, or I shall kill you, and then you will be a murderer!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Civil War and Republican dominance: 1860–1896 ==
[[File:AL1864A.JPG|thumb|upright=0.9|[[National Union Party (United States)|National Union]] ticket in 1864 as party men gave these to voters to deposit in the ballot box]]
The election of Lincoln in 1860 opened a new era of Republican dominance based in the industrial North and agricultural Midwest.

The [[Third Party System]] was dominated by the Republican Party (it lost the presidency only in 1884 and 1892). Lincoln proved brilliantly successful in uniting the factions of his party to fight for the Union.&lt;ref&gt;Goldwyn 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he usually fought the [[Radical Republicans]] who demanded harsher measures. Most Democrats at first were [[War Democrats]] and supportive until the fall of 1862. When Lincoln added the abolition of slavery as a war goal, many War Democrats became Peace Democrats.

Most of the state Republican parties accepted the antislavery goal except Kentucky. During the [[American Civil War]], the party passed major legislation in [[United States Congress|Congress]] to promote rapid [[modernization]], including a [[National Bank Act|national banking system]], high [[Morrill Tariff|tariffs]], the first temporary [[income tax]] (subsequently ruled unconstitutional in ''[[Springer v. United States]]''), many [[excise tax]]es, [[paper money]] issued [[Fiat money|without backing]] ("[[Greenback (money)|greenbacks]]"), a huge [[National debt of the United States|national debt]], [[Homestead Acts|homestead laws]], [[Rail transportation in the United States|railroads]] and [[Morrill Land-Grant Acts|aid to education and agriculture]].

The Republicans denounced the peace-oriented Democrats as disloyal [[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]] and won enough War Democrats to maintain their majority in 1862. In 1864, they formed a coalition with many War Democrats as the [[National Union Party (United States)|National Union Party]] which reelected Lincoln easily. During the war, upper middle-class men in major cities formed [[Union League]]s to promote and help finance the war effort.

=== Reconstruction: freedmen, carpetbaggers and scalawags ===
In [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]], how to deal with the ex Confederates and the former slaves, or [[freedmen]], were the major issues. By 1864, [[Radical Republicans]] controlled Congress and demanded more aggressive action against slavery and more vengeance toward the Confederates. Lincoln held them off, but just barely as Republicans at first welcomed President [[Andrew Johnson]]—the Radicals thought Johnson would be harsher in punishing the South.

However, Johnson broke with the Radical Republicans and formed a loose alliance with moderate Republicans and Democrats. The showdown came in the Congressional elections of 1866, in which the Radicals won a sweeping victory and took full control of Reconstruction, passing key laws over the veto. Johnson was impeached by the House, but acquitted by the Senate.

[[File:Ulysses S. Grant 1870-1880.jpg|thumb|[[Ulysses S. Grant]] was the first Republican President to serve for two full terms (1869–1877)]]
With the election of [[Ulysses S. Grant]] in 1868, the Radicals had control of Congress, the party and the army and attempted to build a solid Republican base in the South using the votes of Freedmen, [[Scalawags]] and [[Carpetbaggers]],&lt;ref name="Gould 2003"/&gt; supported directly by U.S. Army detachments. Republicans all across the South formed local clubs called [[Union League]]s that effectively mobilized the voters, discussed issues and when necessary fought off [[Ku Klux Klan]] (KKK) attacks. Thousands died on both sides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael W. Fitzgerald|title=Union League Movement in the Deep South: Politics and Agricultural Change During Reconstruction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9es8ZKgQuA0C&amp;pg=PA281|year=2000|publisher=LSU Press|pages=114–15, 213–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Grant supported radical reconstruction programs in the South, the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]] and equal civil and voting rights for the freedmen. Most of all he was the hero of the war veterans, who marched to his tune. The party had become so large that factionalism was inevitable; it was hastened by Grant's tolerance of high levels of corruption typified by the [[Whiskey Ring]].

Many of the founders of the GOP joined the liberal movement, as did many powerful newspaper editors. They nominated [[Horace Greeley]] for President, who also gained the Democratic nomination, but the ticket was defeated in a landslide. The depression of 1873 energized the Democrats. They won control of the House and formed "[[Redeemers|Redeemer]]" coalitions which recaptured control of each southern state, in some cases using threats and violence.

Reconstruction came to an end when the contested election of 1876 was awarded by a special [[Electoral Commission (United States)|electoral commission]] to Republican [[Rutherford B. Hayes]], who promised through the unofficial [[Compromise of 1877]] to withdraw federal troops from control of the last three southern states. The region then became the [[Solid South]], giving overwhelming majorities of its electoral votes and Congressional seats to the Democrats through 1964.

In terms of racial issues, Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins argues that in Alabama: &lt;blockquote&gt;White Republicans as well as Democrats solicited black votes but reluctantly rewarded blacks with nominations for office only when necessary, even then reserving the more choice positions for whites. The results were predictable: these half-a-loaf gestures satisfied neither black nor white Republicans. The fatal weakness of the Republican Party in Alabama, as elsewhere in the South, was its inability to create a biracial political party. And while in power even briefly, they failed to protect their members from Democratic terror. Alabama Republicans were forever on the defensive, verbally and physically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sarah Woolfolk Wiggins|title=The Scalawag In Alabama Politics, 1865–1881|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nv9mBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA134|year=1977|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Social pressure eventually forced most Scalawags to join the conservative/Democratic Redeemer coalition. A minority persisted and formed the "tan" half of the [[black-and-tan faction|"Black and Tan" Republican Party]], a minority in every Southern state after 1877.&lt;ref&gt;DeSantis, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

In several Southern states, the "Lily Whites", who sought to recruit white Democrats to the Republican Party, attempted to purge the Black and Tan faction or at least to reduce its influence. Among such "Lily White" leaders in the early 20th century, [[Arkansas]]' [[Wallace Townsend]] was the party's gubernatorial nominee in 1916 and 1920 and its veteran national GOP committeeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2846|title=Wallace Townsend (1882–1979)|publisher=encyclopediaofarkansas.net|accessdate=May 27, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1870s, Southern Republicans were divided into two factions: the [[Lily-white movement|lily-white faction]], which was practically all-white; and the biracial black-and-tan faction.&lt;ref&gt;"Black and Tan Republicans" in Andrew Cunningham McLaughlin and Albert Bushnell Hart, eds.

=== Gilded Age: 1877–1890 ===
{{further|History of conservatism in the United States#The Gilded Age|Gilded Age}}
The party split into factions in the late 1870s. The Stalwarts, followers of Senator [[Roscoe Conkling]], defended the [[spoils system]]. The Half-Breeds, who followed Senator [[James G. Blaine]] of Maine, pushed for reform of the [[Civil service]]. Independents who opposed the spoils system altogether were called "[[Mugwump]]s". In 1884, Mugwumps rejected [[James G. Blaine]] as corrupt and helped elect Democrat [[Grover Cleveland]], though most returned to the party by 1888.

As the Northern post-war economy boomed with industry, railroads, mines and fast-growing cities as well as prosperous agriculture, the Republicans took credit and promoted policies to keep the fast growth going. The Democratic Party was largely controlled by pro-business [[Bourbon Democrat]]s until 1896. The GOP supported big business generally, the [[gold standard]], high [[Tariff in American history|tariffs]] and generous pensions for Union veterans. However, by 1890 the Republicans had agreed to the [[Sherman Anti-Trust Act]] and the [[Interstate Commerce Commission]] in response to complaints from owners of small businesses and farmers. The high [[McKinley Tariff]] of 1890 hurt the party and the Democrats swept to a landslide in the off-year elections, even defeating McKinley himself.

Foreign affairs seldom became partisan issues (except for the annexation of Hawaii, which Republicans favored and Democrats opposed). Much more salient were cultural issues. The GOP supported the pietistic Protestants (especially the Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians and Scandinavian Lutherans) who demanded [[prohibition]]. That angered wet Republicans, especially [[German American]]s, who broke ranks in 1890–1892, handing power to the Democrats.&lt;ref name="sb"&gt;Shafer and Badger (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic trends aided the Democrats, as the German and Irish Catholic immigrants were mostly Democrats and outnumbered the British and Scandinavian Republicans. During the 1880s, elections were remarkably close. The Democrats usually lost, but won in [[United States presidential election, 1884|1884]] and [[United States presidential election, 1892|1892]]. In [[United States House election, 1894|the 1894 Congressional elections]], the GOP scored the biggest landslide in its history as Democrats were blamed for the [[Panic of 1893|severe economic depression 1893–1897]] and the violent coal and railroad strikes of 1894.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt;

From 1860 to 1912, the Republicans took advantage of the association of the Democrats with "Rum, Romanism, and Rebellion". Rum stood for the liquor interests and the tavernkeepers, in contrast to the GOP, which had a strong dry element. "Romanism" meant [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]], especially Irish Americans, who ran the Democratic Party in every big city and whom the Republicans denounced for political corruption. "Rebellion" stood for the Democrats of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], who tried to break the Union in 1861; and the Democrats in the North, called "[[Copperhead (politics)|Copperheads]]", who sympathized with them.

Demographic trends aided the Democrats, as the German and Irish Catholic immigrants were Democrats and outnumbered the English and Scandinavian Republicans. During the 1880s and 1890s, the Republicans struggled against the Democrats' efforts, winning several close elections and losing two to [[Grover Cleveland]] (in [[U.S. presidential election, 1884|1884]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1892|1892]]).

Religious lines were sharply drawn.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Methodists, Congregationalists, Presbyterians, Scandinavian Lutherans and other pietists in the North were tightly linked to the GOP. In sharp contrast, liturgical groups, especially the Catholics, Episcopalians and German Lutherans, looked to the Democratic Party for protection from pietistic moralism, especially prohibition. Both parties cut across the class structure, with the Democrats more bottom-heavy.

Cultural issues, especially prohibition and foreign language schools became important because of the sharp religious divisions in the electorate. In the North, about 50% of the voters were [[Pietism|pietistic]] Protestants (Methodists, Scandinavian Lutherans, Presbyterians, Congregationalists and Disciples of Christ) who believed the government should be used to reduce social sins, such as drinking.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Kleppner 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liturgical churches (Roman Catholics, German Lutherans and Episcopalians) comprised over a quarter of the vote and wanted the government to stay out of the morality business. Prohibition debates and referendums heated up politics in most states over a period of decade as national prohibition was finally passed in 1919 (repealed in 1933), serving as a major issue between the wet Democrats and the dry GOP.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

== Progressive Era: 1896–1932 ==
{{see also|Fourth Party System}}
The election of [[William McKinley]] in [[United States presidential election, 1896|1896]] is widely seen as a resurgence of Republican dominance and is cited as a [[realigning election]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Hal Williams, ''Realigning America: McKinley, Bryan, and the Remarkable Election of 1896'' (2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1896GOP.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|An 1896 Republicann poster warns against [[free silver]]]]
The Progressive Era (or "[[Fourth Party System]]") was dominated by Republican Presidents, with the sole exception of Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1913–1921). McKinley promised that high tariffs would end the severe hardship caused by the [[Panic of 1893]] and that the GOP would guarantee a sort of pluralism in which all groups would benefit. He denounced [[William Jennings Bryan]], the Democratic nominee, as a dangerous radical whose plans for "Free Silver" at 16–1 (or [[Bimetallism]]) would bankrupt the economy.

McKinley relied heavily on finance, railroads, industry and the middle classes for his support and cemented the Republicans as the party of business. His [[campaign manager]], Ohio's [[Mark Hanna]], developed a detailed plan for getting contributions from the business world and McKinley outspent his rival [[William Jennings Bryan]] by a large margin. This emphasis on business was in part mitigated by [[Theodore Roosevelt]], the presidential successor after McKinley's assassination in 1901, who engaged in [[trust-busting]]. McKinley was the first President to promote [[Pluralism (political philosophy)|pluralism]], arguing that prosperity would be shared by all ethnic and religious groups.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt;

Theodore Roosevelt, who became President in 1901, had the most dynamic personality of the era. Roosevelt had to contend with men like Senator [[Mark Hanna]], whom he outmaneuvered to gain control of the convention in 1904 that renominated him and he won after promising to continue McKinley's policies. More difficult to handle was conservative House Speaker [[Joseph Gurney Cannon]].

[[File:JUDGE04B.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Theodore Roosevelt]] leads party to landslide win in [[United States presidential election, 1904|1904]]]]
Roosevelt achieved modest legislative gains in terms of railroad legislation and pure food laws. He was more successful in Court, bringing antitrust suits that broke up the [[Northern Securities Company]] trust and [[Standard Oil]]. Roosevelt moved to the left in his last two years in office, but was unable to pass major [[Square Deal]] proposals. He did succeed in naming his successor Secretary of War [[William Howard Taft]] who easily defeated Bryan again in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1908|1908 presidential election]].

[[File:Theodore Roosevelt cartoon Iowa-ohio.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|President Theodore Roosevelt watches the party team pull apart on tariff issue]]
The tariff issue was pulling the GOP apart. Roosevelt tried to postpone the issue, but Taft had to meet it head on in 1909 with the [[Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act]]. Eastern conservatives led by [[Nelson W. Aldrich]] wanted high tariffs on manufactured goods (especially woolens), while Midwesterners called for low tariffs. Aldrich tricked them by lowering the tariff on farm products, which outraged the farmers. Insurgent Midwesterners led by [[George W. Norris|George Norris]] revolted against the conservatives led by Speaker Cannon. The Democrats won control of the House in 1910 as the rift between insurgents and conservatives widened.&lt;ref name="Gould 2003"/&gt;

In 1912, Roosevelt broke with Taft and tried for a third term, but he was outmaneuvered by Taft and lost the nomination. Roosevelt led his delegates out of the convention and created a new party (the [[Progressive Party (United States, 1912)|Progressive]], or "Bull Moose" ticket), in [[U.S. presidential election, 1912|the election of 1912]]. Few party leaders followed him except [[Hiram Johnson]] of California. Roosevelt had the support of many notable women reformers, including Jane Addams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Women and the Republican Party, 1854-1924|last=Gustafson|first=Melanie|publisher=University of Illinois Press|year=2001|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Melanie Susan Gustafson|url=https://networks.h-net.org/node/24029/reviews/29922/van-ingen-gustafson-women-and-republican-party-1854-1924|title=Van Ingen on Gustafson, 'Women and the Republican Party, 1854-1924'|publisher=Networks.h-net.org|date=|accessdate=December 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Roosevelt-caused split in the Republican vote resulted in a decisive victory for Democrat [[Woodrow Wilson]], temporarily interrupting the Republican era.&lt;ref name="Gould 2003"/&gt;

The Republicans welcomed the [[Progressive Era]] at the state and local level. The first important reform mayor was [[Hazen S. Pingree]] of Detroit (1890–1897), who was elected governor of Michigan in 1896. In New York City, the Republicans joined nonpartisan reformers to battle [[Tammany Hall]] and elected [[Seth Low]] (1902–1903). [[Samuel Milton Jones|Golden Rule Jones]] was first elected mayor of [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]] as a Republican in 1897, but was reelected as an independent when his party refused to renominate him. Many Republican civic leaders, following the example of [[Mark Hanna]], were active in the [[National Civic Federation]], which promoted urban reforms and sought to avoid wasteful strikes.

[[File:TR-Farewell.JPG|thumb|upright=1.15|Theodore Roosevelt's 1908 Farewell speeches sought progressive goals but did not pass Congress]]
The party controlled the presidency throughout the 1920s, running on a platform of opposition to the [[League of Nations]], high tariffs, and promotion of business interests. [[Warren G. Harding]], [[Calvin Coolidge]] and [[Herbert Hoover]] were resoundingly elected in [[U.S. presidential election, 1920|1920]], [[U.S. presidential election, 1924|1924]] and [[U.S. presidential election 1928|1928]], respectively. The breakaway efforts of Senator [[Robert M. La Follette Sr.|Robert La Follette]] in 1924 failed to stop a landslide for Coolidge and his movement fell apart. The [[Teapot Dome Scandal]] threatened to hurt the party, but Harding died and Coolidge blamed everything on him as the opposition splintered in 1924.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt;

The pro-business policies of the decade seemed to produce an unprecedented prosperity—until the [[Wall Street Crash of 1929]] heralded the [[Great Depression]]. Although the party did very well in large cities and among ethnic Catholics in presidential elections of 1920–1924, it was unable to hold those gains in 1928.&lt;ref name="sb"/&gt; By 1932, the cities—for the first time ever—had become Democratic strongholds.

Hoover was by nature an activist and attempted to do what he could to alleviate the widespread suffering caused by the Depression, but his strict adherence to what he believed were Republican principles precluded him from establishing relief directly from the federal government. The Depression cost Hoover the presidency with the [[United States presidential election, 1932|1932 landslide election]] of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Roosevelt's [[New Deal coalition]] controlled American politics for most of the next three decades, excepting the two-term presidency of Republican [[Dwight Eisenhower]]. The Democrats made major gains in the 1930 midterm elections, giving them congressional parity (though not control) for the first time since Woodrow Wilson's presidency.&lt;ref name="Gould 2003"/&gt;

== Progressives and liberals ==
The Republican Party had a progressive element, typified in the early 20th century by [[Theodore Roosevelt]] in the 1907–1912 period (Roosevelt was more conservative at other points), Senator [[Robert M. La Follette, Sr.]] and his sons in Wisconsin (from about 1900 to 1946) and western leaders such as Senator [[Hiram Johnson]] in California, Senator [[George W. Norris]] in Nebraska, Senator [[Bronson M. Cutting]] in New Mexico, Congresswoman [[Jeannette Rankin]] in Montana and Senator [[William Borah]] in Idaho. They were generally progressive in domestic policy, supported unions&lt;ref&gt;Ruth O'Brien, ''Workers' Paradox: The Republican Origins of New Deal Labor Policy, 1886–1935'' (1998) p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; and supported much of the [[New Deal]], but were isolationist in foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Johnson, ''The peace progressives and American foreign relations'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt; This element died out by the 1940s. Outside Congress, of the leaders who supported Theodore Roosevelt in 1912, most opposed the New Deal.&lt;ref&gt;Otis L. Graham Jr., ''An Encore for Reform: The Old Progressives and the New Deal''  (1967)&lt;/ref&gt;

Starting in the 1930s, a number of Northeastern Republicans took liberal positions regarding labor unions, spending and New Deal policies. They included Mayor [[Fiorello La Guardia]] in New York City, Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York,&lt;ref name="Michael Bowen 2011"&gt;Michael Bowen, ''The Roots of Modern Conservatism: Dewey, Taft, and the Battle for the Soul of the Republican Party'' (2011)&lt;/ref&gt; Governor [[Earl Warren]] of California, Governor [[Harold Stassen]] of [[Minnesota]], Senator [[Clifford P. Case]] of New Jersey, [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] of Massachusetts, Senator [[Prescott Bush]] of [[Connecticut]] (father and grandfather of the two Bush Presidents), Senator [[Jacob K. Javits]] of New York, Senator [[John Sherman Cooper]] of Kentucky, Senator [[George Aiken]] of Vermont, Governor and later Senator [[Mark Hatfield]] of Oregon, Governor [[William Scranton]] of Pennsylvania and Governor [[George W. Romney]] of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;Nicol C. Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;  The most notable of them all was Governor [[Nelson A. Rockefeller]] of New York.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph E. Persico, ''The Imperial Rockefeller: A Biography of Nelson A. Rockefeller'' (1982).&lt;/ref&gt; They generally advocated a free-market, but with some level of regulation. Rockefeller required employable welfare recipients to take available jobs or job training.&lt;ref&gt;''Public Papers of Nelson A. Rockefeller, Fifty-third Governor of the State of New York,'' vol. 15, 1973 (Albany, NY: State of New York, 1973), p. 1385.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the media sometimes called them "[[Rockefeller Republican]]s", the liberal Republicans never formed an organized movement or caucus and lacked a recognized leader. They promoted economic growth and high state and federal spending while accepting high taxes and much liberal legislation, with the provision they could administer it more efficiently. They opposed the Democratic big city machines while welcoming support from labor unions and big business alike. Religion was not high on their agenda, but they were strong believers in civil rights for African Americans and women's rights and most liberals were [[pro-choice]]. They were also strong environmentalists and supporters of higher education. In foreign policy they were internationalists, throwing their support to [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] over the conservative leader [[Robert A. Taft]] in 1952. They were often called the "Eastern Establishment" by conservatives such as [[Barry Goldwater]].&lt;ref name="Rae, 1989"&gt;Rae, ''The Decline and Fall of the Liberal Republicans: From 1952 to the Present'' (1989)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goldwater conservatives fought this establishment from 1960,&lt;ref&gt;John Andrew, "The Struggle for the Republican Party in 1960," ''Historian,'' Spring 1997, Vol. 59 Issue 3, pp. 613–33.&lt;/ref&gt; defeated it in 1964 and eventually retired most of its members, although some became Democrats like Senator [[Charles Goodell]] and Mayor [[John Lindsay]] in New York.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy J.

== Political firsts for women and minorities ==
From its inception in 1854 to 1964, when Senate Republicans pushed hard for passage of the [[Civil Rights Act of 1964]] against a [[filibuster]] by Senate Democrats, the GOP had a reputation for supporting blacks and minorities. In 1869, the Republican-controlled legislature in Wyoming Territory and its Republican governor [[John Allen Campbell]] made it the first jurisdiction to grant [[Women's suffrage in the United States|voting rights to women]]. In 1875, California swore in the first Hispanic governor, Republican [[Romualdo Pacheco]]. In 1916, [[Jeannette Rankin]] of Montana became the first woman in Congress—and indeed the first woman in any high level government position. In 1928, New Mexico elected the first Hispanic U.S. Senator, Republican [[Octaviano Larrazolo]]. In 1898, the first Jewish U.S. Senator elected from outside of the former Confederacy was Republican [[Joseph Simon]] of [[Oregon]]. In 1924, the first Jewish woman elected to the U.S. House of Representatives was Republican [[Florence Prag Kahn|Florence Kahn]] of [[California]]. In 1928, the Republican U.S. Senate Majority Leader, [[Charles Curtis]] of Kansas, who grew up on the [[Kaw people|Kaw]] Indian reservation, became the first person of significant non-European ancestry to be elected to national office, as Vice President of the United States for Herbert Hoover.

Blacks generally identified with the GOP until the 1930s. Every [[African American]] who served in the [[List of African-American United States Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] before 1935 and all of the African Americans who served in the [[List of African-American United States Senators|Senate]] before 1979, were Republicans. [[Frederick Douglass]] after the Civil War and [[Booker T. Washington]] in the early 20th century were prominent Republican spokesmen. In 1966, [[Edward Brooke]] of Massachusetts became the first African American popularly elected to the [[United States Senate]].&lt;ref group="Note"&gt;The first African American Senator, [[Hiram Rhodes Revels]], was appointed by the Mississippi state legislature to an unexpired term in 1870. [[Blanche Bruce]] was the first African American elected to the Senate, elected by the Mississippi state legislature to a full term in 1874. Prior to the [[Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|17th Amendment]] in 1913, U.S. Senators were elected by state legislatures.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fighting the New Deal coalition: 1932–1980 ==
{{main|Old Right (United States)|Fifth Party System}}
Historian [[George H. Nash]] argues: &lt;blockquote&gt;Unlike the "moderate," internationalist, largely eastern bloc of Republicans who accepted (or at least acquiesced in) some of the "Roosevelt Revolution" and the essential premises of President Truman's foreign policy, the Republican Right at heart was counterrevolutionary. Anticollectivist, anti-Communist, anti-New Deal, passionately committed to limited government, free market economics, and congressional (as opposed to executive) prerogatives, the G.O.P. conservatives were obliged from the start to wage a constant two-front war: against liberal Democrats from without and "me-too" Republicans from within.&lt;ref&gt;George H. Nash, "The Republican Right from Taft to Reagan," ''Reviews in American History'' (1984) 12:2 pp. 261–265 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/2702450 in JSTOR] quote on p. 261; Nash references David W. Reinhard, ''The Republican Right since 1945'', (University Press of Kentucky, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Old Right emerged in opposition to the [[New Deal]] of [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]]. Hoff says that "moderate Republicans and leftover Republican Progressives like Hoover composed the bulk of the Old Right by 1940, with a sprinkling of former members of the Farmer-Labor party, Non-Partisan League, and even a few midwestern prairie Socialists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joan Hoff|title=Herbert Hoover, forgotten progressive|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gwl3AAAAMAAJ|year=1975|publisher=Little, Brown|page=222}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1933–1938 ===
After Roosevelt took office in 1933, [[New Deal]] legislation sailed through Congress at lightning speed. In the 1934 midterm elections, ten Republican senators went down to defeat, leaving them with only 25 against 71 Democrats. The House of Representatives was also split in a similar ratio. The "Second New Deal" was heavily criticized by the Republicans in Congress, who likened it to [[class conflict|class warfare]] and [[socialism]]. The volume of legislation, as well as the inability of the Republicans to block it, soon made the opposition to Roosevelt develop into bitterness and sometimes hatred for "that man in the White House". Former President Hoover became a leading orator crusading against the New Deal, hoping unrealistically to be nominated again for President.&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Hoover, ''Addresses upon the American road, 1933–1938'' (1938).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George H. Nash, ''The Crusade Years, 1933–1955: Herbert Hoover's Lost Memoir of the New Deal Era and Its Aftermath'' (Hoover Institution Press, 2013).&lt;/ref&gt;

Most major newspaper publishers favored Republican moderate [[Alf Landon]] for President. In the nation's 15 largest cities the newspapers that editorially endorsed Landon represented 70% of the circulation, while Roosevelt won 69% of the actual voters in those cities, ignoring the press and using the radio to reach voters directly.&lt;ref&gt;Charles W. Smith Jr, ''Public Opinion in a Democracy'' (1939), pp. 85–86.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roosevelt carried 46 of the 48 states thanks to traditional Democrats along with newly energized labor unions, city machines and the WPA. The realignment creating the [[Fifth Party System]] was firmly in place.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard Sternsher, "The New Deal Party System: A Reappraisal," ''Journal of Interdisciplinary History,'' (1984) 15:1 pp. 53–81 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/203594 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1928, the GOP had lost 178 House seats, 40 Senate seats and 19 governorships, though it retained a mere 89 seats in the House and 16 in the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Kazin, eta al, eds.|title=The Concise Princeton Encyclopedia of American Political History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7hScNkRpePoC&amp;pg=PA203|year=2011|publisher=Princeton U. P. |page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The black vote held for Hoover in 1932, but started moving toward Roosevelt. By 1940, the majority of northern blacks were voting Democratic. Roosevelt made sure blacks had a share in relief programs, the wartime Army and wartime defense industry, but did not challenge segregation or the denial of voting rights in the South.&lt;ref&gt;Harvard Sitkoff, ''A New Deal for Blacks: The Emergence of Civil Rights as a National Issue: The Depression Decade'' (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Minority parties tend to factionalize and after 1936 the GOP split into a conservative faction (dominant in the West and Midwest) and a liberal faction (dominant in the Northeast)—combined with a residual base of inherited progressive Republicanism active throughout the century. [[U.S. presidential election, 1936|In 1936]], Kansas governor [[Alf Landon]] and his young followers defeated the [[Herbert Hoover]] faction. Landon generally supported most New Deal programs, but carried only two states in the Roosevelt landslide with his moderate campaign. The GOP was left with only 16 senators and 88 representatives to oppose the New Deal, with Massachusetts Senator [[Henry Cabot Lodge Jr.]] as the sole victor over a Democratic incumbent.

Roosevelt alienated many conservative Democrats in 1937 by his unexpected plan to "pack" the Supreme Court via the [[Judiciary Reorganization Bill of 1937]]. Following a sharp recession that hit early in 1938, major strikes all over the country, the CIO and AFL competing with each other for membership and Roosevelt's failed efforts to radically reorganize the Supreme Court, the Democrats were in disarray. Meanwhile, the GOP was united as they had shed their weakest members in a series of defeats since 1930.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Dunn, ''Roosevelt's Purge: How FDR Fought to Change the Democratic Party'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Re-energized Republicans focused attention on strong fresh candidates in major states, especially [[Robert A. Taft]] the conservative from Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson, ''Mr. Republican: A Biography of Robert A. Taft'' (1972) pp. 160–82&lt;/ref&gt; [[Earl Warren]] the moderate who won both the Republicans and the Democratic primaries in California&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

Dewey]] the crusading prosecutor from New York.&lt;ref&gt;Richard Norton Smith, ''Thomas E. Dewey and His Times'' (1982)  pp. 273–81&lt;/ref&gt; The GOP comeback in 1938 was made possible by carrying 50% of the vote outside the South, giving GOP leaders confidence it had a strong base for the 1940 presidential election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Robert Mason|title=The Republican Party and American Politics from Hoover to Reagan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GkcL4Hwpi4YC&amp;pg=PA76|year=2011|publisher=Cambridge UP|pages=76–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milton Plesur, "The Republican Congressional Comeback of 1938," ''Review of Politics'' (1962) 24:4 pp. 525–62 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1405361 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;

The GOP gained 75 House seats in 1938, but were still a minority. Conservative Democrats, mostly from the South, joined with Republicans led by Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] to create the [[conservative coalition]], which dominated domestic issues in Congress until 1964.&lt;ref&gt;James T. Patterson, "A Conservative Coalition Forms in Congress, 1933–1939," ''Journal of American History,'' (1966) 52:4 pp. 757–72. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/1894345 in JSTOR].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1939–1952 ===
From 1939 through 1941, there was a sharp debate within the GOP about support for Britain in World War II. Internationalists, such as [[Henry Stimson]] and [[Frank Knox]], wanted to support Britain and isolationists, such as [[Robert A. Taft]] and [[Arthur Vandenberg]], strongly opposed these moves as unwise, if not unconstitutional. The [[America First Committee|America First]] movement was a bipartisan coalition of isolationists. In [[United States presidential election, 1940|1940]], a total unknown [[Wendell Willkie]] at the last minute won over the party, the delegates and was nominated. He crusaded against the inefficiencies of the New Deal and Roosevelt's break with the strong tradition against a third term.&lt;ref name="Michael Bowen 2011"/&gt;

The Japanese [[attack on Pearl Harbor]] in 1941 ended the isolationist-internationalist debate. The Republicans further cut the Democratic majority in the 1942 midterm elections. With wartime production creating prosperity, the [[conservative coalition]] terminated most New Deal relief programs.&lt;ref name="Michael Bowen 2011"/&gt;

Senator [[Robert A. Taft]] of Ohio represented the wing of the party that continued to oppose [[New Deal]] reforms and continued to champion [[non-interventionism]]. Governor [[Thomas E. Dewey]] of New York, represented the Northeastern wing of the party. Dewey did not reject the New Deal programs, but demanded more efficiency, more support for economic growth and less corruption. He was more willing than Taft to support Britain in 1939–1940. After the war the isolationists wing strenuously opposed the [[United Nations]] and was half-hearted in opposition to world communism.&lt;ref name="Michael Bowen 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John W. Malsberger, ''From Obstruction to Moderation: The Transformation of Senate Conservatism, 1938–1952'' (2000) [https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=111877178 online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100420055859/http://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o|date=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a minority party, the GOP had two wings: The left-wing supported most of the New Deal while promising to run it more efficiently and the right-wing opposed the New Deal from the beginning and managed to repeal large parts during the 1940s in cooperation with conservative Southern Democrats in the conservative coalition. Liberals, led by Dewey, dominated the Northeast while conservatives, led by Taft, dominated the Midwest.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Michael Bowen, ''The Roots of Modern Conservatism: Dewey, Taft, and the Battle for the Soul of the Republican Party'' (2011), University of North Carolina Press.&lt;/ref&gt; The West was split and the South was still solidly Democratic.

In [[United States presidential election, 1944|1944]], a clearly frail Roosevelt defeated Dewey for his fourth consecutive term, but Dewey made a good showing that would lead to his selection as the candidate in [[United States presidential election, 1948|1948]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

Roosevelt died in April 1945 and [[Harry S. Truman]], a less liberal Democrat became President and replaced most of Roosevelt's top appointees. With the end of the war, unrest among organized labor led to many strikes in 1946 and the resulting disruptions helped the GOP. With the blunders of the Truman administration in 1945 and 1946, the slogans "Had Enough?" and "To Err is Truman" became Republican rallying cries and the GOP won control of Congress for the first time since 1928, with [[Joseph William Martin, Jr.]] as [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]]. The [[Taft-Hartley Act]] of 1947 was designed to balance the rights of management and labor. It was the central issue of many elections in industrial states in the 1940s to 1950s, but the unions were never able to repeal it.

In 1948, with Republicans split left and right, Truman boldly called Congress into a special session and sent it a load of liberal legislation consistent with the Dewey platform and dared them to act on it, knowing that the conservative Republicans would block action. Truman then attacked the Republican "Do-Nothing Congress" as a whipping boy for all of the nation's problems. Truman stunned Dewey and the Republicans in [[United States presidential election, 1948|the election]] with a plurality of just over two million popular votes (out of nearly 49 million cast), but a decisive 303–189 victory in the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]].

=== Dwight D. Eisenhower and Richard Nixon: 1952–1974 ===
[[File:Eisenhower Inauguration ticket.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|[[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] and [[Richard Nixon]], 1953: the first Republican presidential inauguration in 24 years]]
In [[United States presidential election, 1952|1952]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], an internationalist allied with the Dewey wing, was drafted as a GOP candidate by a small group of Republicans led by [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] in order that he challenge Taft on foreign policy issues. The two men were not far apart on domestic issues. Eisenhower's victory broke a twenty-year Democratic lock on the White House. Eisenhower did not try to roll back the New Deal, but he did expand the Social Security system and built the [[Interstate Highway System]].

After 1945, the isolationists in the conservative wing opposed the [[United Nations]] and were half-hearted in opposition to the expansion of [[Cold War|communism around the world]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y4CTCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT13&amp;lpg=PT13&amp;dq=1945+isolationist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=yMtmm0N78r&amp;sig=grI3f6Ml_E5TJiyKu8-zaHpr8L0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwip8MWr4u7OAhWGKGMKHXEZBV4Q6AEIOzAO#v=onepage&amp;q=1945%20isolationist&amp;f=false A Harry and Arthur: Truman, Vandenberg, and the Partnership That Created the Free World], Lawrence J. Haas, U of Nebraska Press, Apr 1, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; A garrison state to fight communism, they believed, would mean regimentation and government controls at home. Eisenhower, the [[Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force]] Commander, defeated Taft in 1952 on foreign policy issues.

=== Citizens for Eisenhower ===
To circumvent the local Republican Party apparatus mostly controlled by Taft supporters, the Eisenhower forces created a nationwide network of grass-roots clubs, "Citizens for Eisenhower". Independents and Democrats were welcome, as the group specialized in canvassing neighborhoods and holding small group meetings. Citizens for Eisenhower hoped to revitalize the GOP by expanding its activist ranks and by supporting moderate and internationalist policies. It did not endorse candidates other than Eisenhower, but he paid it little attention after he won and it failed to maintain its impressive starting momentum. Instead the conservative Republicans became energized, leading to the [[Barry Goldwater]] nomination of 1964. Long-time Republican activists viewed the newcomers with suspicion and hostility. More significantly, activism in support of Eisenhower did not translate into enthusiasm for the party cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Robert|last=Mason|title=Citizens for Eisenhower and the Republican Party, 1951–1965|journal=The Historical Journal|year=2013|volume=56|issue=2|pages=513–536|doi=10.1017/S0018246X12000593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once in office, Eisenhower was not an effective party leader and Nixon increasingly took that role. Historian David Reinhard concludes that Eisenhower lacked sustained political commitment, refused to intervene in state politics, failed to understand the political uses of presidential patronage and overestimated his personal powers of persuasion and conciliation. Eisenhower's attempt in 1956 to convert the GOP to "Modern Republicanism" was his "grandest flop". It was a vague proposal with weak staffing and little financing or publicity that caused turmoil inside the local parties across the country. The GOP carried both houses of Congress in 1952 on Eisenhower's coattails, but in 1954 lost both and would not regain the Senate until 1980 nor the House until 1994. The problem, says Reinhard, was the "voters liked Ike—but not the GOP".&lt;ref&gt;David W. Reinhard, ''The Republican Right since 1945'', (University Press of Kentucky, 1983) pp. 157–158.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Richard Nixon and Barry Goldwater ===
Eisenhower was an exception to most Presidents in that he usually let Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] handle party affairs (controlling the national committee and taking the roles of chief spokesman and chief fundraiser). Nixon was defeated in [[United States presidential election, 1960|1960]] in a close election, weakening his moderate wing of the party.&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Rorabaugh, ''The Real Making of the President: Kennedy, Nixon, and the 1960 Election'' (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

The conservatives in 1964 made a comeback under the leadership of [[Barry Goldwater]] who defeated moderates and liberals such as [[Nelson Rockefeller]] and [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]], as the Republican candidate for the 1964 election. Goldwater was strongly opposed to the New Deal and the United Nations, but he rejected isolationism and containment, calling for an aggressive anti-communist foreign policy.&lt;ref&gt;Rick Perlstein, ''Before the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensus'' (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[United States presidential election, 1964|presidential election of 1964]], he was defeated by [[Lyndon Johnson]] in a landslide that brought down many senior Republican Congressmen across the country. Goldwater won five states in the deep South, the strongest showing by a Republican presidential candidate in the South since 1872. Goldwater blamed the magnitude of his defeat on [[John F. Kennedy assassination|the assassination]] of [[John F. Kennedy]] a year before the election and on Johnson running a successful campaign.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

The [[New Deal Coalition]] collapsed in the mid-1960s in the face of urban riots, the [[Vietnam War]], the opposition of many Southern Democrats to [[desegregation]] and the [[Civil Rights Movement]] and disillusionment that the New Deal could be revived by Lyndon Johnson's [[Great Society]]. Nixon defeated both [[Hubert Humphrey]] and [[George C. Wallace]] in [[United States presidential election, 1968|1968]]. When the Democratic left took over their party in 1972, Nixon [[United States presidential election, 1972|won reelection]] by carrying 49 states.

Nixon's involvement in [[Watergate scandal|Watergate]] brought disgrace and a forced resignation in 1974 and any long-term movement toward the GOP was interrupted by the scandal. [[Gerald Ford]] succeeded Nixon and gave him a full pardon—thereby giving the Democrats a powerful issue they used to sweep the 1974 off-year elections. Ford never fully recovered and in 1976 he [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 1976|barely defeated]] [[Ronald Reagan]] for the nomination. The one positive to come from Ford's brief presidency was the outspoken personality of [[First Lady]] [[Betty Ford]]. Ford took several liberal positions on social issues regarding breast cancer awareness following her [[Mastectomy]] in 1974. To add to her outspoken persona, she was a staunch supporter of and activist for the [[Equal Rights Amendment]], (ERA). [[Pro-choice]] on abortion and a leader in the [[Women's Movement in the United States (1963-1982)|women's movement]], she gained fame as one of the most candid first ladies in history, commenting on every [[hot button]] issue of the time, including [[feminism]], [[Equal pay for equal work|equal pay,]] the [[Equal Rights Amendment|ERA]], [[sex]], [[Drugs in the United States|drugs]], [[abortion]], [[Gun control|civil rights,]] and [[gun control]]. Her liberal positions and her outspoken personality garnered her high approval ratings throughout her husband's term in office  despite opposition from the conservative wing of the GOP who objected to her liberal stances and even a few members of Ford's cabinet like [[Dick Cheney]] and [[Donald Rumsfeld]] advised Ford to ask her to tone down her outspoken views to avoid losing voters, but Ford declined to do so. Despite the candid nature of the First Lady and the end of the Vietnam War, Democrats ended up with major gains in Congress and the taint of Watergate and the nation's economic difficulties contributed to the election of Democrat [[Jimmy Carter]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1976|1976]], running as a Washington outsider.

[[Ronald Reagan]] was elected President in the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 election]] by a landslide vote, not predicted by most voter polling. Running on a "[[Peace Through Strength]]" platform to combat the communist threat and massive tax cuts to revitalize the economy, Reagan's strong persona proved too much for Carter. Reagan's election also gave Republicans control of the Senate for the first time in decades.

Dubbed the "[[Reagan Revolution]]", he fundamentally altered several long standing debates in Washington, namely dealing with the Soviet threat and reviving the economy. His election saw the conservative wing of the party gain control. While reviled by liberal opponents in his day, his proponents contend his programs provided unprecedented economic growth and spurred the [[collapse of the Soviet Union]].

Detractors of Reagan's policies note that although Reagan promised to simultaneously slash taxes, massively increase defense spending and balance the budget, by the time he left office the nation's budget deficit had tripled in his eight years in office. In 2009, Reagan's budget director noted that the "debt explosion has resulted not from big spending by the Democrats, but instead the Republican Party's embrace, about three decades ago, of the insidious doctrine that deficits don't matter if they result from tax cuts". He inspired conservatives to greater electoral victories by being reelected in a landslide against [[Walter Mondale]] in [[United States presidential election, 1984|1984]], but oversaw the loss of the Senate in [[United States Senate elections, 1986|1986]].

=== Moderate Republicans of 1960–1980 ===
The term "[[Rockefeller Republican]]" was used 1960–1980 to designate a faction of the party holding "moderate" views similar to those of [[Nelson Rockefeller]], [[governor of New York]] from 1959 to 1974 and Vice President under President [[Gerald Ford]] in 1974–1977. Before Rockefeller, [[Thomas E. Dewey]], governor of New York (1942–1954) and GOP presidential nominee in 1944 and 1948 was the leader. [[Dwight Eisenhower]] and his aide [[Henry Cabot Lodge, Jr.]] reflected many of their views.

An important moderate leader in the 1950s was [[Connecticut]] Republican Senator [[Prescott Bush]], father and grandfather of Presidents [[George H. W. Bush]] and [[George W. Bush]], respectively. After Rockefeller left the national stage in 1976, this faction of the party was more often called "moderate Republicans", in contrast to the conservatives who rallied to [[Ronald Reagan]].

Historically, Rockefeller Republicans were moderate or liberal on domestic and social policies. They favored [[New Deal]] programs, including regulation and welfare. They were very strong supporters of [[civil and political rights|civil rights]]. They were strongly supported by big business on [[Wall Street]] ([[New York City]]). In fiscal policy they favored [[balanced budget]]s and relatively high tax levels to keep the budget balanced. They sought long-term economic growth through [[entrepreneurship]], not tax cuts.

In state politics, they were strong supporters of [[state colleges and universities]], low tuition and large research budgets. They favored infrastructure improvements, such as highway projects. In foreign policy they were internationalists and [[Anti-communism|anti-communists]]. They felt the best way to counter communism was sponsoring economic growth (through foreign aid), maintaining a strong military and keeping close ties to [[NATO]]. Geographically their base was the Northeast, from Maine to Pennsylvania, where they had the support of major corporations and banks and worked well with labor unions.

The moderate Republicans were top-heavy, with a surplus of high visibility national leaders and a shortage of grass roots workers. Most of all they lack the numbers, the enthusiasm and excitement the conservatives could mobilize—the moderates decided it must be an un-American level of fanaticism that drove their opponents. Doug Bailey, a senior Rockefeller aide recalled, "there was a mentality in [Rockefeller's] campaign staff that, 'Look, we have got all this money. We should be able to buy the people necessary to get this done. And you buy from the top down'". Bailey discovered that the Rockefeller team never understood that effective political organizations are empowered from the bottom up, not the top down.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Kabaservice, ''Rule and Ruin'' p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Goldwater]] crusaded against the Rockefeller Republicans, beating Rockefeller narrowly in the California primary of 1964 giving the Arizona senator, all of the California delegates and a majority at the presidential nominating convention. The election was a disaster for the conservatives, but the Goldwater activists now controlled large swaths of the GOP and they had no intention of retreating. The stage was set for a conservative takeover, based in the South and West, in opposition to the Northeast. Ronald Reagan continued in the same theme. George H. W. Bush was more closely associated with the moderates, but his son George W. Bush was firmly allied with the conservatives.

=== Realignment: the South becomes Republican ===
[[File:Barry Goldwater photo1962.jpg|thumb|[[Arizona]] Senator and 1964 Republican presidential nominee [[Barry Goldwater]] was a key figure of the [[American conservative]] movement in the 1950s and 1960s]]
Before [[Reconstruction era of the United States|Reconstruction]] and for a century thereafter, the white South identified with the Democratic Party. The Democratic Party's dominance in the Southern states was so strong that the region was called the [[Solid South]]. The Republicans controlled certain parts of the [[Appalachian Mountains]]&lt;ref&gt;Gordon B. McKinney, ''Southern Mountain Republicans 1865–1900'' (1978)&lt;/ref&gt; and they sometimes did compete for statewide office in the border states.&lt;ref name="Key, Jr. 1949"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=V. O. Key Jr.|title=Southern Politics State and Nation|year=1949|first=V. O.|last=Key Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before 1948, the Southern Democrats saw their party as the defender of the Southern way of life, which included a respect for states' rights and an appreciation for traditional southern values. They repeatedly warned against the aggressive designs of Northern liberals and Republicans as well as the civil rights activists they denounced as "outside agitators", thus there was a serious barrier to becoming a Republican.&lt;ref name="Key, Jr. 1949"/&gt;

In 1948, Democrats alienated white Southerners in two ways. The [[1948 Democratic National Convention|Democratic National Convention]] adopted a strong civil rights plank, leading to a walkout by Southerners. Two weeks later, President Harry Truman signed [[Executive Order 9981]] integrating the [[Armed Forces of the United States|armed forces]]. In 1948, the Deep South walked out, formed a new regional party and nominated [[J. Strom Thurmond]] who carried the Deep South, but the outer South stayed with Truman and the "[[Dixiecrats]]" returned to the party.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

==== 1964–1972 ====
By 1964, the Democratic lock on the South remained strong, but cracks began to appear. One long-term cause was that the region was becoming more like the rest of the nation and could not long stand apart in terms of [[racial segregation]]. Modernization brought factories, businesses and larger cities as well as millions of migrants from the North, as far more people graduated from high school and college. Meanwhile, the cotton and tobacco basis of the traditional South faded away as former farmers moved to town or commuted to factory jobs. Segregation, requiring separate dining and lodging arrangements for employees, was a serious obstacle to business development.

The highly visible immediate cause of the political transition involved civil rights. The [[civil rights movement]] caused enormous controversy in the white South with many attacking it as a violation of states' rights. When segregation was outlawed by court order and by the Civil Rights acts of [[Civil Rights Act of 1964|1964]] and [[Voting Rights Act of 1965|1965]], a die-hard element resisted integration, led by Democratic governors [[Orval Faubus]] of [[Arkansas]], [[Lester Maddox]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Ross Barnett]] of [[Mississippi]] and, especially [[George Wallace]] of [[Alabama]]. These [[Populism|populist]] governors appealed to a less-educated, blue-collar electorate that on economic grounds favored the Democratic Party and supported segregation.&lt;ref name="Dewey W. Grantham 1988"&gt;Dewey W. Grantham, ''The Life and Death of the Solid South'' (1988)&lt;/ref&gt;

After passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, most Southerners accepted the integration of most institutions (except public schools). With the old barrier to becoming a Republican removed, Southerners joined the new middle class and the Northern transplants in moving toward the Republican Party. Integration thus liberated Southern politics from the old racial issues. In 1963, the federal courts declared unconstitutional the practice of excluding African-American voters from the [[White primaries|Democratic primaries]], which had been [[Tantamount to election|the only elections that mattered]] in most of the South. Meanwhile, the newly enfranchised black voters supported Democratic candidates at the 85–90% level, a shift which further convinced many white segregationists that the Republicans were no longer the black party.&lt;ref name="Dewey W. Grantham 1988"/&gt;

===== Southern strategy =====
[[File:Richard M. Nixon, ca. 1935 - 1982 - NARA - 530679.jpg|thumb|[[Richard Nixon]] currently holds the record for most states won in a presidential election, 49 excluding [[Massachusetts]] and [[Washington, D.C.|D.C.]] in 1972]]
Some critics, most notably Dan Carter, have alleged that the rapid growth in Republican strength in the South came from a secretly coded message to Wallacites and segregationists that the GOP was a racist anti-black party seeking their votes.&lt;ref&gt;Dan T. Carter, ''The Politics of Rage: George Wallace, the Origins of the New Conservatism, and the Transformation of American Politics'' (2000)&lt;/ref&gt; Political scientists and historians point out that the timing does not fit the Southern strategy model. Nixon carried 49 states in 1972, so he operated a successful national rather than regional strategy, but the Republican Party remained quite weak at the local and state level across the entire South for decades. Matthew Lassiter argues that Nixon's appeal was not to the Wallacites or segregationists, but rather to the rapidly emerging suburban middle-class. Many had Northern antecedents and they wanted rapid economic growth and saw the need to put backlash politics to rest. Lassiter says the Southern strategy was a "failure" for the GOP and that the Southern base of the Republican Party "always depended more on the middle-class corporate economy and on the top-down politics of racial backlash". Furthermore, "realignment in the South quote came primarily from the suburban ethos of New South metropolises such as Atlanta and Charlotte, North Carolina, not to the exportation of the working-class racial politics of the Black Belt".&lt;ref&gt;Matthew D. Lassiter, "Suburban Strategies: The Volatile Center in Postwar American Politics" in Meg Jacobs et al. eds., ''The Democratic Experiment: New Directions In American Political History'' (2003): pp. 327–49; quotes on pp. 329–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The South's transition to a Republican stronghold took decades and manifested an incremental seepage downward from national to state to local levels.&lt;ref&gt;Matthew D. Lassiter, ''The Silent Majority: Suburban Politics in the Sunbelt South'' (Princeton UP, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt; First the states started voting Republican in presidential elections—the Democrats countered that by nominating Southerners who could carry some states in the region, such as [[Jimmy Carter]] in 1976 and [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992 and 1996. However, the strategy narrowly failed with [[Al Gore]] in 2000. The states began electing Republican senators to fill open seats caused by retirements and finally governors and state legislatures changed sides.&lt;ref name="Charles S 2007"&gt;Charles S. Bullock III and Mark J. Rozell, eds. ''The New Politics of the Old South: An Introduction to Southern Politics'' (3rd ed. 2007) covers every state 1950–2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Georgia was the last state to fall, with [[Sonny Perdue]] taking the governorship in [[Georgia gubernatorial election, 2002|2002]]. Republicans aided the process with redistricting that protected the African-American and Hispanic vote (as required by the Civil Rights laws), but split up the remaining white Democrats so that Republicans mostly would win.&lt;ref name="Charles S 2007"/&gt; In 2006, the Supreme Court endorsed nearly all of the [[gerrymandering]] engineered by [[Tom DeLay]] that swung the Texas Congressional delegation to the GOP in 2004. DeLay himself [[Tom DeLay campaign finance trial|was acquitted on appeal in 2013]] of illegally funding the state GOP.

In addition to its white middle class base, Republicans attracted strong majorities from the [[Evangelicalism|evangelical Christian]] vote (including Southern pockets of traditionalist [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholics]] as in South [[Louisiana]]), which had been nonpolitical before 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Oran P. Smith, ''The Rise of Baptist Republicanism'' (2000). A particularly critical event was the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision ''[[Roe v. Wade]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The national Democratic Party's support for liberal social stances such as abortion drove many white Southerners into a Republican Party that was embracing the conservative views on these issues. Conversely, liberal voters in the northeast began to join the Democratic Party.

In 1969, [[Kevin Phillips (political commentator)|Kevin Phillips]] argued in ''The Emerging Republican Majority'' that support from Southern whites and growth in the South, among other factors, were driving an enduring Republican electoral [[realigning election|realignment]]. Today, the South is again generally solid in state elections, and mostly solid in presidential contests, but now for the Republicans. Exit polls in [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004]] showed that [[George W. Bush]] led [[John Kerry]] 70% to 30% among whites, who constituted 71% of Southern voters.&lt;ref name="CNN.com Election 2004"&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/ELECTION/2004/pages/results/states/US/P/00/epolls.3.html CNN.com Election 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

Kerry had a 90% to 9% lead among the 18% of black voters. One-third of the Southerners said they were white evangelicals and they voted for Bush, 80% to 20%.&lt;ref name="CNN.com Election 2004"/&gt; In 2008. [[Barack Obama]] carried Florida, North Carolina and Virginia, but in 2010 the GOP regained their losses. Since the Reagan administration, U.S. presidential elections have been close. However, the Republican presidential candidate won a majority of the popular vote only in 2004, while coming in second in 1992, 1996, 2000, 2008, 2012 and 2016.

Political scientists Nicholas A. Valentino and David O. Sears argue that conventional wisdom concerning partisanship today focuses more on the size of government, national security and moral issues, while disagreements on racial issues plays a smaller role.&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas A. Valentino and David O. Sears. "Old times there are not forgotten: Race and partisan realignment in the contemporary South."

== From Ronald Reagan to the Bush: 1980–2008 ==
=== Reagan Revolution ===
[[File:Official Portrait of President Reagan 1981.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Ronald Reagan]] launched the "[[Reagan Revolution]]" with his election to the presidency in 1980, providing conservative influence that continues to the present day]]
[[File:George H. W. Bush crop.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[George H. W. Bush]], the first former Vice President to become President by vote rather than by the death or resignation of the sitting President since 1836, ended the Cold War during his term]]
[[Ronald Reagan]] produced a major [[realigning election|realignment]] with his [[U.S. presidential election, 1980|1980]] and [[U.S. presidential election, 1984|1984]] landslides. In 1980, the [[Reagan coalition]] was possible because of Democratic losses in most social-economic groups. In 1984, Reagan won nearly 60% of the popular vote and carried every state except his Democratic opponent [[Walter Mondale]]'s home state of Minnesota and the District of Columbia, creating a record 525 electoral vote total (out of 538 possible votes). Even in Minnesota, Mondale won by a mere 3,761 votes, meaning Reagan came within less than 3,800 votes of winning in all fifty states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = 1984 Presidential Election Results – Minnesota |url=http://uselectionatlas.org/RESULTS/state.php?year=1984&amp;f=1&amp;off=0&amp;fips=27&amp;submit=Retrieve |accessdate = 2006-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political commentators, trying to explain how Reagan had won by such a large margin, coined the term "[[Reagan Democrats|Reagan Democrat]]" to describe a Democratic voter who had voted for Reagan in 1980 and 1984 (as well as for [[George H. W. Bush]] in [[U.S. presidential election, 1988|1988]]), producing their landslide victories. They were mostly white, [[Blue-collar worker|blue-collar]] and were attracted to Reagan's social conservatism on issues such as abortion and to his hawkish foreign policy. [[Stan Greenberg]], a Democratic pollster, concluded that Reagan Democrats no longer saw Democrats as champions of their middle class aspirations, but instead saw it as being a party working primarily for the benefit of others, especially [[African Americans]] and social liberals.

Reagan reoriented American politics ad claimed credit in 1984 for an economic renewal—"[[Morning in America|It's morning in America again!]]" was the successful campaign slogan. Income taxes were slashed 25% and the upper tax rates abolished. The frustrations of [[stagflation]] were resolved under the new monetary policies of [[Federal Reserve]] Chairman [[Paul Volcker]], as no longer did soaring inflation and recession pull the country down. Working again in bipartisan fashion, the [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] financial crises were resolved for the next 25 years.

In foreign affairs, bipartisanship was not in evidence. Most Democrats doggedly opposed Reagan's efforts to support the [[Contra (guerrillas)|contra guerrillas]] against the [[Sandinista]] government of [[Nicaragua]] and to support the [[dictatorial]] governments of [[Efraín Ríos Montt|Guatemala]], [[Honduras]] and [[Roberto D'Aubuisson|El Salvador]] against [[communist]] [[guerrilla]] movements. He took a hard line against the [[Soviet Union]], alarming Democrats who wanted a nuclear freeze, but he succeeded in increasing the military budget and launching the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI)—labeled "Star Wars" by its opponents—that the Soviets could not match.

When [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] came to power in Moscow, many conservative Republicans were dubious of the growing friendship between him and Reagan. Gorbachev tried to save communism in the Soviet Union first by ending the expensive arms race with America, then in 1989 by shedding the [[Eastern Europe|East European]] empire. Communism finally [[collapse of the Soviet Union|collapsed in the Soviet Union in 1991]].

President [[George H. W. Bush]], Reagan's successor, tried to temper feelings of triumphalism lest there be a backlash in the Soviet Union, but the palpable sense of victory in the [[Cold War]] was a success that Republicans felt validated the aggressive foreign policies Reagan had espoused. As [[Haynes Johnson]], one of his harshest critics admitted, "his greatest service was in restoring the respect of Americans for themselves and their own government after the traumas of Vietnam and Watergate, the frustration of the [[Iran hostage crisis]] and a succession of seemingly failed presidencies".&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Haynes (1989). ''Sleepwalking Through History: America in the Reagan Years'', p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Congressional ascendancy in 1994 ===
[[File:NewtGingrich.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Newt Gingrich]], [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|House Speaker]] (1995–1999), was the most visible adversary for President [[Bill Clinton]]]]
After the [[United States presidential election, 1992|election]] of Democratic President [[Bill Clinton]] in 1992, the Republican Party, led by House Republican Minority Whip [[Newt Gingrich]] campaigning on a "[[Contract with America]]", were elected to majorities to both Houses of Congress in the [[Republican Revolution]] of 1994. It was the first time since 1952 that the Republicans secured control of both houses of [[Congress of the United States|U.S. Congress]], which with the exception of the Senate during 2001–2002 was retained through 2006. This capture and subsequent holding of Congress represented a major legislative turnaround, as Democrats controlled both houses of Congress for the forty years preceding 1995, with the exception of the 1981–1987 Congress in which Republicans controlled the Senate.

In 1994, Republican Congressional candidates ran on a platform of major reforms of government with measures such as a [[balanced budget amendment]] and [[welfare reform]]. These measures and others formed the famous Contract with America, which represented the first effort to have a party platform in an off-year election. The Contract promised to bring all points up for a vote for the first time in history. The Republicans passed some of their proposals, but failed on others such as [[term limits]].

Democratic President Bill Clinton opposed some of the social agenda initiatives, but he co-opted the proposals for welfare reform and a balanced federal budget. The result was a major change in the welfare system, which conservatives hailed and liberals bemoaned. The Republican-controlled House of Representatives failed to muster the two-thirds majority required to pass a Constitutional amendment to impose [[term limit]]s on members of Congress.

In 1995, a budget battle with Clinton led to the brief shutdown of the federal government, an event which contributed to Clinton's victory in the [[U.S. presidential election, 1996|1996 election]]. That year, the Republicans nominated [[Bob Dole]], who was unable to transfer his success in Senate leadership to a viable presidential campaign.

The incoming Republican majority's promise to slow the rate of government spending conflicted with the president's agenda for Medicare, education, the environment and public health, eventually leading to a temporary shutdown of the U.S. federal government. The shutdown became the longest-ever in U.S. history, ending when Clinton agreed to submit a CBO-approved balanced budget plan. Democratic leaders vigorously attacked Gingrich for the budget standoff and his public image suffered heavily.

During the 1998 midterm elections, Republicans lost five seats in the House of Representatives—the worst performance in 64 years for a party that did not hold the presidency. Polls showed that Gingrich's attempt to remove President Clinton from the office was widely unpopular among Americans and Gingrich suffered much of the blame for the election loss. Facing another rebellion in the Republican caucus, he announced on November 6, 1998 that he would not only stand down as Speaker, but would leave the House as well, even declining to take his seat for an 11th term once he was handily re-elected in his home district.

=== Neoconservatives ===
{{main|Neoconservatism}}
Some liberal Democratic intellectuals in the 1960s and 1970s who became disenchanted with the leftward movement of their party in domestic and foreign policy became "neoconservatives" ("neocons").&lt;ref&gt;Justin Vaïsse, ''Neoconservatism: The biography of a movement'' (Harvard UP, 2010) pp. 6–11.&lt;/ref&gt; A number held major appointments during the five presidential terms under Reagan and the Bushes. They played a central role in promoting and planning the [[2003 invasion of Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Jeffrey Record|title= Wanting War: Why the Bush Administration Invaded Iraq|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=7hOlgQUq7FYC&amp;pg=PT47|year= 2010|publisher= Potomac Books, Inc.|pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] and Secretary of Defense [[Donald Rumsfeld]], while not identifying themselves as neoconservatives, listened closely to neoconservative advisers regarding foreign policy, especially the defense of Israel, the promotion of democracy in the Middle East and the buildup of American military forces to achieve these goals. Many early neoconservative thinkers were Zionists and wrote often for ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', published by the American Jewish Committee.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Friedman, ''The neoconservative revolution: Jewish intellectuals and the shaping of public policy'' (Cambridge University Press, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin Balint, ''Running Commentary: The Contentious Magazine that Transformed the Jewish Left into the Neoconservative Right'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the neocons on the White House faded during the Obama years, but it remains a staple in Republican Party arsenal.&lt;ref&gt;Alexandra Homolar-Riechmann, "The moral purpose of US power: neoconservatism in the age of Obama." ''Contemporary Politics'' 15#2 (2009): pp. 179–96. [http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/13569770902858111 abstract].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second Bush era ===
[[File:George-W-Bush.jpeg|thumb|upright=0.9|The presidency of [[George W. Bush]] was greatly impacted by the events of the [[September 11 attacks|September 11th terrorist attacks]]]]
[[George W. Bush]], son of George H. W. Bush, won the 2000 Republican presidential nomination over Arizona Senator [[John McCain]], former Senator [[Elizabeth Dole]] and others. With his highly controversial and exceedingly narrow victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2000|2000 election]] against the Vice President [[Al Gore]], the Republican Party gained control of the Presidency and both houses of Congress for the first time since 1952. However, it lost control of the Senate when Vermont Senator [[James Jeffords]] left the Republican Party to become an independent in 2001 and caucused with the Democrats.

In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States in 2001, Bush gained widespread political support as he pursued the [[War on Terrorism]] that included the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|invasion of Afghanistan]] and the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|invasion of Iraq]]. In March 2003, Bush ordered for an invasion of Iraq because of breakdown of United Nations sanctions and intelligence indicating programs to rebuild or develop new [[weapons of mass destruction]]. Bush had near-unanimous Republican support in Congress plus support from many Democratic leaders.

The Republican Party fared well in the 2002 [[midterm elections]], solidifying its hold on the House and regaining control of the Senate in the run-up to the war in Iraq. This marked the first time since 1934 that the party in control of the White House gained seats in a midterm election in both houses of Congress (previous occasions were in 1902 and following the [[American Civil War|Civil War]]). Bush was renominated without opposition as the Republican candidate in the [[U.S. presidential election, 2004|2004 election]] and titled his political platform "A Safer World and a More Hopeful America".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gop.com/media/2004platform.pdf|title=The 2004 Republican National Platform|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080226213133/http://www.gop.com/media/2004platform.pdf|archivedate=February 26, 2008|df=}} {{small|(277&amp;nbsp;KB)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It expressed Bush's optimism towards winning the War on Terrorism, ushering in an [[ownership society]] and building an innovative economy to compete in the world. Bush was re-elected by a larger margin than in 2000, but won the smallest share ever of the popular vote for a reelected incumbent president. However, he was the first Republican candidate since 1988 to win an outright majority. In the same election that year, the Republicans gained seats in both houses of Congress and Bush told reporters: "I earned capital in the campaign, political capital, and now I intend to spend it. It is my style".

Bush announced his agenda in January 2005, but his popularity in the polls waned and his troubles mounted. Continuing troubles in Iraq as well as the disastrous government response to [[Hurricane Katrina]] led to declining popular support for Bush's policies. His campaign to add personal savings accounts to the [[Social Security Trust Fund|Social Security]] system and make major revisions in the tax code were postponed. He succeeded in selecting conservatives to head four of the most important agencies, [[Condoleezza Rice]] as [[Secretary of State]], [[Alberto Gonzales]] as [[Attorney General]], [[John Roberts]] as [[Chief Justice of the United States]] and [[Ben Bernanke]] as [[Chairman of the Federal Reserve]].

Bush failed to win conservative approval for [[Harriet Miers]] to the Supreme Court, replacing her with [[Samuel Alito]], whom the Senate confirmed in January 2006. Bush and McCain secured additional tax cuts and blocked moves to raise taxes. Through 2006, they strongly defended his policy in Iraq, saying the [[Coalition of the Willing|Coalition]] was winning. They secured the renewal of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]].

In the November 2005 off-year elections, New York City, Republican mayoral candidate [[Michael Bloomberg]] won a landslide re-election, the fourth straight Republican victory in what is otherwise a Democratic stronghold. In California, Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] failed in his effort to use the ballot initiative to enact laws the Democrats blocked in the state legislature. Scandals prompted the resignations of Congressional Republicans [[House Majority Leader]] [[Tom DeLay]], [[Duke Cunningham]], [[Mark Foley]] and [[Bob Ney]]. In the [[2006 midterm elections]], the Republicans lost control of both the House of Representatives and Senate to the Democrats in what was widely interpreted as a repudiation of the administration's war policies. Exit polling suggested that corruption was a key issue for many voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Corruption named as key issue by voters in exit polls|publisher=CNN|date=November 8, 2006|url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/POLITICS/11/07/election.exitpolls/|accessdate=January 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after the elections, [[Donald Rumsfeld]] resigned as secretary of defense to be replaced by [[Bob Gates]].

In the Republican leadership elections that followed the general election, Speaker Hastert did not run and Republicans chose [[John Boehner]] of Ohio for [[House Minority Leader]]. Senators chose whip [[Mitch McConnell]] of Kentucky for [[Senate Minority Leader]] and chose their former leader [[Trent Lott]] as [[Senate Minority Whip]] by one vote over [[Lamar Alexander]], who assumed their roles in January 2007. In the October and November gubernatorial elections of 2007, Republican [[Bobby Jindal]] won election for governor of [[Louisiana]], Republican incumbent Governor [[Ernie Fletcher]] of [[Kentucky]] lost and Republican incumbent Governor [[Haley Barbour]] of [[Mississippi]] won re-election.

With President Bush ineligible for a third term and Vice President [[Dick Cheney]] not pursuing the party's nomination, Arizona Senator [[John McCain]] quickly emerged as the Republican Party's presidential nominee, receiving President Bush's endorsement on March 6, six months before official ratification at the [[2008 Republican National Convention]]. On August 29, Senator McCain announced Governor [[Sarah Palin]] of Alaska as his running-mate, making her the first woman on a Republican Presidential ticket. McCain surged ahead of Obama in the national polls following the nomination but amid a [[Financial crisis of 2007–2010|financial crisis]] and a serious economic downturn, McCain and Palin went on to lose the election to Democrats [[Barack Obama]] and running mate [[Joe Biden]].

Following the 2008 elections, the Republican Party, reeling from the loss of the presidency, Congress and key state governorships, was fractured and leaderless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Dick Morris|author2=Eileen McGann|title=Revolt!: How to Defeat Obama and Repeal His Socialist Programs|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OPAQn0AhNIAC&amp;pg=PT38|year=2011|publisher=HarperCollins|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Steele]] became the first black chairman of the [[Republican National Committee]], but was a poor fundraiser and was replaced after numerous gaffes and missteps.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.npr.org/templates/archives/archive.php?thingId=125948760 "Michael Steele Archive"] at NPR.&lt;/ref&gt; Republicans suffered an additional loss in the Senate in April 2009, when [[Arlen Specter]] switched to the Democratic Party, depriving the GOP of a critical 41st vote to block legislation in the Senate. The seating of [[Al Franken]] several months later effectively handed the Democrats a filibuster-proof majority, but it was short-lived as the GOP took back its 41st vote when [[Scott Brown (politician)|Scott Brown]] won a [[United States Senate special election in Massachusetts, 2010|special election]] in Massachusetts in early 2010.

Republicans strongly opposed Obama's [[American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009|2009 economic stimulus package]] and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|2010 health care reform bill]]. The [[Tea Party movement]], formed in early 2009, provided a groundswell of conservative grassroots activism to oppose policies of the [[Obama administration]]. With an expected economic recovery being criticized as sluggish, the GOP was expected to make big gains in the [[United States congressional elections, 2010|2010 midterm elections]]. However, establishment Republicans began to see themselves at odds with Tea Party activists, who sought to run conservative candidates in primary elections to defeat the more moderate establishment-based candidates. Incumbent senators such as [[Bob Bennett (politician)|Bob Bennett]] in Utah and [[Lisa Murkowski]] in Alaska lost primary contests in their respective states.

Republicans won back control of the House of Representatives in the [[United States House of Representatives elections, 2010|November general election]], with a net gain of 63 seats, the largest gain for either party since [[United States House of Representatives elections, 1948|1948]]. The GOP also [[United States Senate elections, 2010|picked up six seats]] in the Senate, falling short of retaking control in that chamber, and posted additional gains in state governor and legislative races. Boehner became Speaker of the House while McConnell remained as the Senate Minority Leader. In an interview with ''[[National Journal]]'' magazine about congressional Republican priorities, McConnell explained that "the single most important thing we want to achieve is for (Barack) Obama to be a one-term president".&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Libby, ''Purging the Republican Party: Tea Party Campaigns and Elections'', Lexington Books, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, several freshmen Republican governors began proposing legislation that would diminish the power of public employee [[labor unions]] by removing or negatively affecting their right to [[collective bargaining]], claiming that these changes were needed to cut state spending and balance the states' budgets. These actions sparked [[2011 United States public employee protests|public-employee protests]] across the country. In Wisconsin, the veritable epicenter of the controversy, Governor [[Scott Walker (politician)|Scott Walker]] fought off a labor-fueled [[Wisconsin gubernatorial recall election, 2012|recall election]], becoming the first state governor in U.S. history to defeat a recall against him.

=== 2012–2016 ===
{{main|Republican Party presidential primaries, 2012}}
[[File:Mitt Romney by Gage Skidmore 8.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|2012 Republican presidential nominee [[Mitt Romney]] was the first [[Mormon]] nominated for president by either major party]]
After leading a pack of minor candidates for much of 2010 and 2011, former Massachusetts Governor [[Mitt Romney]], despite outmatching his opponents in both money and organization, struggled to hold on to his lead for the 2012 GOP nomination. As the presidential campaign season headed toward the voting stage in January 2012, one candidate after another surged past Romney, held the lead for a few weeks, then fell back. According to the [[RealClearPolitics]] 2012 polling index, five candidates at one time or another were the top choice of GOP voters: Texas Governor [[Rick Perry]], motivational speaker [[Herman Cain]], former Speaker [[Newt Gingrich]], former Senator [[Rick Santorum]] and Romney himself.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.realclearpolitics.com/epolls/2012/president/us/republican_presidential_nomination-1452.html 2012 "Republican Presidential Nomination"]. Retrieved February 26, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

After losing to Santorum in [[Iowa Republican caucuses, 2012|Iowa]] and Gingrich in [[South Carolina Republican primary, 2012|South Carolina]], Romney racked up a number of wins in later contests, emerging as the eventual frontrunner after taking the lion's share of states and delegates in the crucial [[Super Tuesday, 2012|Super Tuesday]] contests, despite an embarrassing loss in the [[Colorado Republican caucuses, 2012|Colorado caucuses]] and near-upsets in the [[Michigan Republican primary, 2012|Michigan]] and [[Ohio Republican primary, 2012|Ohio]] primaries. Romney was nominated in August and chose Congressman [[Paul Ryan]], a young advocate of drastic budget cuts, as his running mate. Throughout the summer polls showed a close race and Romney had a good first debate, but otherwise had trouble reaching out to ordinary voters. He lost to Obama 51% to 47% and instead of gaining in the Senate as expected, Republicans lost seats.

The party mood was glum in 2013 and one conservative analyst concluded: &lt;blockquote&gt;It would be no exaggeration to say that the Republican Party has been in a state of panic since the defeat of Mitt Romney, not least because the election highlighted American demographic shifts and, relatedly, the party's failure to appeal to Hispanics, Asians, single women and young voters. Hence the Republican leadership's new willingness to pursue immigration reform, even if it angers the conservative base.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent J. Cannato. "Give Me Your Skilled Workers". ''Wall Street Journal''. March 12, 2013. p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In March 2013, National Committee Chairman [[Reince Priebus]] gave a stinging postmortem on the GOP's failures in 2012, calling on the party to reinvent itself and to endorse immigration reform and said: "There's no one reason we lost. Our message was weak; our ground game was insufficient; we weren't inclusive; we were behind in both data and digital; and our primary and debate process needed improvement". Priebus proposed 219 reforms, including a $10 million marketing campaign to reach women, minorities and [[gays]]; a shorter, more controlled primary season; and better data collection and research facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Rachel Weiner.

The Tea Party fielded a number of anti-establishment candidates in the 2014 Republican primaries, but scored very few notable wins. However, they managed to unseat House Majority Leader [[Eric Cantor]] in his Virginia primary race. GOP attacks on Obama's unpopular administration resonated with voters and the party posted major gains around the country. They regained control of the Senate and increased their majorities in the House to the highest total since 1929. They took control of governorships, state legislatures and Senate seats in nearly all Southern states, except Florida and Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;Nate Cohn (December 4, 2014).

Great divisions in the House GOP conference were apparent after the 2014 midterm elections, with conservative members, many of them from the right-leaning [[Freedom Caucus]], expressing dissatisfaction with congressional leadership. John Boehner's surprise announcement in September 2015 that he would step down as Speaker sent shockwaves through the House. After Majority Leader [[Kevin McCarthy (California politician)|Kevin McCarthy]] bowed out of the [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, October 2015|race to replace Boehner]] due to a lack of support, House Ways and Means Chair [[Paul Ryan]] announced he would run, with the Freedom Caucus' support. Ryan was elected Speaker on October 29.

== 2016 elections and presidency of Donald Trump ==
[[File:Official Portrait of President Donald Trump (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|[[Donald Trump]], 45th and current President of the United States]]
Businessman [[Donald Trump]] won the [[Republican Party presidential primaries, 2016|2016 Republican primaries]], representing a dramatic policy shift from traditional conservatism to a more aggressive populist theme with overtones of cultural identity politics. Numerous high-profile Republicans, including past nominees like Mitt Romney, announced [[List of Republicans who opposed the Donald Trump presidential campaign, 2016|their opposition to Trump]], even after he was formally nominated as the GOP candidate for President. Much of this opposition to Trump within the party stemmed from concerns that his disdain for [[political correctness]] (for which he was criticized for his remarks and policy proposals concerning ethnic and religious minorities and immigrants) and related support by the [[Ethnic nationalism|ethno-nationalist]] [[alt-right]], his virulent criticism of the mainstream news media and accusations of him inciting violence at his campaign rallies, among other issues dealing with the tone and tenor of his campaign, would result in the GOP losing the presidential election and lead to significant losses for the party in that year's Congressional elections. Trump went on to defeat [[Hillary Clinton]] in the [[2016 American presidential election|2016 presidential election]], which is arguably the biggest upset in political history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/11/10/us/politics/donald-trump-election-reaction.html|title=Donald Trump's Victory Is Met With Shock Across a Wide Political Divide|work=The New York Times|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Arkin|first1=Daniel|last2=Siemaszko|first2=Corky|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/2016-election-day/2016-election-donald-trump-wins-white-house-upset-n679936|title=2016 Election: Donald Trump Wins the White House in Upset|publisher=NBC News|date=November 9, 2016|accessdate=November 10, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2016/nov/09/how-trump-won-us-election|title=How Donald Trump swept to an unreal, surreal presidential election win|date=November 9, 2016|work=Guardian|accessdate=November 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Goldmacher|first1=Shane|last2=Schreckinger|first2=Ben|title=Trump Pulls Off Biggest Upset in U.S. History|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2016/11/election-results-2016-clinton-trump-231070?lo=ap_c1|date=November 9, 2016|publisher=[[Politico]]|accessdate=December 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trump's win resulted in criticism and analysis about the Republican Party's rightward shift in recent years, precipitated by the Tea Party's rise during the Obama presidency. Scholars and commentators on the left and right have suggested that the shift was the "natural evolutionary product of Republican platforms and strategies that stretch back to the very origins of modern conservatism", particularly the party's use of the Southern strategy to increase support among Southern whites by appealing to racism, along with using other methods of identity politics to attract whites and the [[Religious conservatism|religious right]] opposed to the [[LGBT]] community and to [[Muslim]]s in recent years that led to the ethno-nationalist politics used by Trump and Republican candidates who have run in state and federal elections beginning with the 2017 off-year races who were motivated by his 2016 presidential win.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How the Southern Strategy Made Donald Trump Possible|url=https://newrepublic.com/article/130039/southern-strategy-made-donald-trump-possible|author=Jett Heer|periodical=[[The New Republic]]|date=February 18, 2016|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Donald Trump and Paul Manafort Revived Nixon’s Race-Based Hate Strategy for the 21st Century|url=https://www.alternet.org/right-wing/trump-manafort-nixon-martin-luther-king-jr-assassination|author=[[Thom Hartmann]]|author2=Lamar Waldron|website=[[AlterNet]]|date=April 11, 2018|accessdate=May 8, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=This is how Trump is destroying the Republican Party|url=https://whyy.org/articles/this-is-how-trump-is-destroying-the-republican-party/|author=David A.

Many critics and political scholars also suggest that the hyper-partisanship of the American political systems has resulted in Republican support for [[Right-wing authoritarianism|authoritarianism]] leadership increasing prior to as well as since Trump's ascension to the presidency, with some commentators tracing this back to Newt Gingrich's "Republican Revolution" in the 1990s. Establishment politicians in the GOP—with few exceptions, such as [[Jeff Flake]] and [[Bob Corker]]—have faced criticism since Trump took office for making little effort in the party being made to push back against the authoritarianism many of his critics across the political spectrum suggest he exhibits. Several candidates in the 2017 and 2018 midterm elections have run on a platform that primarily exhalts their support of Trump and have emulated his playbook by echoing similar ethno-nationalistic appeals, verbal attacks on mainstream news media and calls to imprison Trump's political opponents. Political scientists Christopher Federico, Stanley Feldman and Christopher Weber explained in their 2018 book ''Remaking Partisan Politics through Authoritarian Sorting'' that the divide in American politics that precipitated this trend is driven by political polarization, evolution of media consumption and the rise of perceived "threats to the traditional social order", making authoritarianism "part and parcel of Republican identity among non-Hispanic white Americans". A March 2018 report from the [[Democracy Fund|Democracy Fund Voter Study Group]] revealed that 32% of Republican primary voters who supported Trump preferred a "strong leader who doesn’t have to bother with Congress or elections", a much higher percentage than among voters for any other primary candidate of either political party. Such preferences were strong among voters who switched from voting for Obama in 2012 to Trump in 2016, with 45% of them supporting a "strong leader" and disagreeing that "democracy is preferable to any other kind of government".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Contract With Authoritarianism|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/03/15/opinion/trump-republicans-authoritarianism.html|author=Thomas B.

=== Demographic shifts since 2009 ===
The voter base of the GOP has been changing in directions opposite from national trends. It has become older and less Hispanic or Asian than the general population. Jackie Calmes has reported a dramatic shift in the power base of the party, as it moves away from the Northeast and Pacific States and toward small-town America in the South and West. During the 2016 presidential election, the Republicans also gained significant support in the Midwest. It has become more populist in its distrust of large corporations and of state and federal governments.

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a shift over a half-century, the party base has been transplanted from the industrial Northeast and urban centers to become rooted in the South and West, in towns and rural areas. In turn, Republicans are electing more populist, antitax and antigovernment conservatives who are less supportive — and even suspicious — of appeals from big business.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Big business, many Republicans believe, is often complicit with big government on taxes, spending and even regulations, to protect industry tax breaks and subsidies — "corporate welfare," in their view.&lt;ref&gt;Jackie Calmes. [https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/16/us/politics/a-shift-for-gop-as-party-of-business.html?_r=0 "For 'Party of Business,' Allegiances Are Shifting"]. ''The New York Times''.

{{about|Latin American indigenous activism|Ethnic nationalism among indigenous peoples in general|Indigenism}}
'''''Indigenismo''''' ({{IPA-es|indixeˈnizmo|lang}}) is a political ideology in several [[Latin America]]n countries emphasizing the relation between the nation state and [[Indigenism|indigenous nations and indigenous minorities]].&lt;ref&gt;See{{cite book|last=Engle|first=Karen|title=The Elusive Promise of Indigenous Development|year=2010|publisher=Duke University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In some contemporary uses, it refers to the pursuit of greater social and political inclusion for [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]], whether through national-level reforms or region-wide alliances.&lt;ref&gt;See e.g. Alcida Rita Ramos, ''Indigenism: Ethnic Politics in Brazil'', University of Wisconsin Press, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;  In either case, this type of indigenismo seeks to vindicate indigenous cultural and linguistic difference, assert indigenous rights, and seek recognition and in some cases compensation for past wrongdoings of the colonial and republican states. [[Hispanismo]] is a similar but opposite ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Montoya Iriarte |first=Urpi |date=1988 |title=Hispanismo e Indigenismo: o dualismo cultural no pensamento social peruano (1900-1930).

==Indigenismo in Mexico==
{{main|Indigenismo in Mexico}}
A second use of the term, however, is more common{{fact|date=February 2016}} and has more historical depth.{{fact|date=February 2016}}  Originally, indigenismo was a component of nationalist ideology that became influential in [[Mexico]] after the consolidation of the [[Mexican Revolution|revolution of 1910–20]].  This "indigenismo" also lauded some aspects of indigenous cultural heritage, but primarily as a relic of the past.  Within the larger national narrative of the Mexican nation as the product of European and Amerindian "race mixture," indigenismo was the expression of nostalgia for an imagined, folklorized figure of indigeneity.

During the administration of [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] (1924–28), [[Moisés Sáenz]], who held a doctorate from Columbia University and was a follower of [[John Dewey]]'s educational methods, implemented aspects of indigenismo in the Department of Public Education. Sáenz had initially taken an assimilationist position on the "Indian problem," but after a period of residence in the [[Purépecha people|Purépecha]] community of Carapan, he shifted his stance to one focusing on the material conditions affecting the indigenous. He influenced the administration of [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] (1934–40), which established the cabinet-level position of the Department of Indigenous Affairs in 1936.&lt;ref&gt;Alexander S. Dawson, "Moisés Sáenz," in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', vol. 2, p. 1325. Chicago: Fitzroy and Dearborn 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The department's main efforts were in the economic and educational spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Government of Mexico, ''Seis Años de Gobierno al Servicio de México, 1934-40''. México: La Nacional Impresora 1940, pp. 351-382.&lt;/ref&gt;  Cárdenas valorized indigeneity, as indicated by the creation of the cabinet-level position and resources put into indigenous communities. In 1940, Mexico hosted a multinational meeting on indigenism, The Congress of Inter-American Indigenismo, held in Pátzcuaro, where Cárdenas himself addressed the gathering.&lt;ref&gt;''Seis Años'', p. 382.&lt;/ref&gt;  President [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]] reorganized the Mexican government's policies directed at the indigenous by creating the National Indigenista Institute (''Instituto Nacional Indigenista'' or INI).  In the [[Vicente Fox]] administration, the unit was reorganized and renamed. 

The valorization of indigeneity was rarely carried over to contemporary indigenous people, who were targeted for assimilation into modern Mexican society. Though the authors of indigenista policies saw themselves as seeking to protect and relieve indigenous people, their efforts did not make a clean break with the overtly racist forced assimilation of the pre-revolutionary past.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Knight, “Racism, Revolution, and Indigenismo," in ''The Idea of Race in the Latin America, 1870-1940'', edited by Richard Graham, University of Texas Press, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Indigenismo in Peru==
In [[Peru]] it is associated with the [[American Popular Revolutionary Alliance|APRA]] movement founded by [[Víctor Raúl Haya de la Torre]] (1924). APRA dominated Peruvian politics for decades as the singular well organized political party in Peru which was not centered on one person. To some APRA or "Aprismo" in its pure form stood for the nationalization of foreign-owned enterprises and an end to the exploitation of Indians. To others it was about the combining of modern economics and technology with the historical traditions of the countryside and Indian populations to create a new and unique model for social and economic development.&lt;ref&gt;Latino Indigenismo in a Comparative Perspective

[[File:Israel Jacobson, from Seesen, 1810 AD, gouache on ivory with paper and cardboard - Braunschweigisches Landesmuseum - DSC04639.JPG|thumb|right|Israel Jacobson, 1810]]

'''Israel Jacobson''' (17 October 1768, [[Halberstadt]] – 14 September 1828, [[Berlin]]) was a German-Jewish [[philanthropist]] and communal organiser. While he lacked a systematic religious approach, he is considered one of the heralds of [[Reform Judaism]].&lt;ref name="M"&gt;Michael A. Meyer, ''Response to Modernity: A History of the Reform Movement in Judaism'', Wayne State University Press, 1995. pp. 30–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
The only son of wealthy businessman and philanthropist Israel Jacob, Jacobson's parents lived modestly yet contributed considerably to reducing the community debt. Owing to the very low level of efficiency of the Halberstadt public schools, Israel attended mainly the Jewish religious school, in his leisure hours studying German literature and the works of [[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] and [[Moses Mendelssohn]] on his own account. His level of understanding of rabbinic literature and Hebrew led professors at the [[University of Helmstedt]], where he was eventually granted a degree, to declare that Jacobson was a Hebrew scholar.

At the age of eighteen, after having accumulated a small fortune, he married Mink Samson, the daughter of respected financier Herz Samson and granddaughter of Philip Samson, founder of the Samson-Schule at [[Wolfenbüttel]], at which [[Leopold Zunz]] and [[Isaak Markus Jost]] were educated. Through the Samson family, Jacobson became friends with [[Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick|Charles William Ferdinand, Duke of Brunswick and Lunenburg, Prince of Wolfenbüttel]], favorite nephew of [[Frederick II of Prussia]]. Jacobson took up his residence in [[Braunschweig|Brunswick]] and, possessing great financial ability, rapidly increased his fortune. It was through Jacobson's influence and persuasion that in 1803 the so-called "''[[Leibzoll]]''" (poll-tax), then levied from Jews in many [[States of the German Confederation|German states]], was abolished in the ducal Brunswick-Lunenburgian [[Principality of Wolfenbüttel]].

Developing a belief in [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[Jewish views of religious pluralism|religious pluralism]] in education, he established (1801) in [[Seesen]], near the [[Harz Mountains]], a school in which forty children of Jewish parents and twenty children of Christian parents were to be educated together, receiving free board and lodging. This close association of children of different creeds was a favorite idea of his. The Jacobson school soon obtained a wide reputation, and hundreds of pupils from neighboring places were educated there. During the hundred years of its existence, it has stood foremost in every line of educational work.

==Accomplishments==
Jacobson very soon perceived the necessity of imbuing the young as early as possible with proper religious impressions. In 1810 he built a beautiful [[synagogue|temple]] within the school grounds and showed his sympathies for reforming ritual by adding Hymns in German that were sung by a choir of boys, and prayers in German were added to those in [[Hebrew (language)|Hebrew]] and [[Aramaic]]. He also had a [[pipe organ]] installed. Though not unheard of in synagogues before, its subsequent association with the new movement would later anathemize the organ in the eyes of the Orthodox in Central Europe (albeit it was introduced, without controversy, in France and Italy).&lt;ref&gt;[[Jacob J. Petuchowski]], ''[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/judaica/ejud_0002_0015_0_15184.html Organ]'', [[Encyclopedia Judaica]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; The progressive nature of his views was further shown by his strong advocacy of the introduction of confirmation. In the Seesen temple it was Jacobson himself who confirmed the first five Jewish boys. When, under [[Napoleon]]'s rule, the [[Kingdom of Westphalia]] was created, and the emperor's brother [[Jérôme Bonaparte]] was placed at its head, Jacobson, who had removed to the residence of the king at [[Kassel|Cassel]], was appointed president of the [[Consistory (Judaism)|Jewish consistory]] ({{Interlanguage link multi|Royal Westphalian Consistory of the Israelites|he|3=הקונסיסטוריה היהודית של וסטפליה}}), established on 3 March 1808. In his capacity as consistorial president, assisted by a board of officers, he did his best to exercise a reforming influence upon the various congregations of the country. He also advocated a seminary for the training of Jewish teachers. A double portrait of him and his first wife Mink Samson, painted by the Jewish court-painter Salomon Pinhas (ca. 1808) is at the European Art collection of the Israel Museum, Jerusalem.

Jacobson's innovations were quite restrained, and more importantly his mode of thought was still within a traditional framework. He justified himself on conventional [[halachic]] grounds, later enlisting scholars to write responsa in favour of his worship style. His role in the introduction of these early reforms made him a founding figure in the eyes of some partisans of [[Reform Judaism]], but Michael A. Meyer noted that he lacked either a comprehensive approach or a sense of principled critique. His religious worldview, according to Meyer, did not stray beyond that of late ''[[maskilim]]''; he "was not a conscious Reformer", interested in modifying religious mechanisms themselves, only exteriors.&lt;ref name="M"/&gt; While his associates, mainly Eduard Kley, would later publish the [[Hamburg Temple|first unequivocal Reform liturgy in 1818]], effecting a concerted Orthodox backlash,&lt;ref&gt;Meyer, pp. 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt; the Westphalian Consistory's aroused little ire at their time. Its reforms were adopted by German [[Torah im Derech Eretz|neo-Orthodoxy]], and Rabbi [[Samson Raphael Hirsch]] "''integrated fully into his worldview the program of the moderate Haskalah and even the aesthetic reforms of the Westphalian consistory.''"&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Michael K. Silber, ''[http://www.yivoencyclopedia.org/article.aspx/Orthodoxy Orthodoxy]'',  [[The YIVO Encyclopedia of Jews in Eastern Europe]].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Duchy of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]] emancipated its Jewish subjects in 1813, Jacobson bought in that duchy two feudal manor estates, Klenz and Gehmkendorf and the peasant village Klein Markow (all three are components of today's [[Jördenstorf]]). In 1816 he swore his [[oath of fealty]] to [[Frederick Francis I, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg-Schwerin]], thus becoming the first Jew with a permanent seat and vote in the [[Estates of the Realm]] of a German state. As feudal lord he also held the [[Property|patrimonial]] jurisdiction over his [[vassal]] peasants and the [[ius patronatus|patronage]] of the pertaining [[Evangelical Lutheran Church of Mecklenburg|Lutheran]] churches, which he conveyed to a Lutheran confidant. In 1817 he further acquired the neighbouring estates of Grambow and Tressow. His life and work, especially this part, is commemorated—among other things—in the permanent exhibition on Mecklenburg's Jewish history in the museum ''Engelscher Hof'' and the half-timbered former synagogue in [[Röbel]], 66&amp;nbsp;km south of Jördenstorf.

After Napoleon's fall (1815) Jacobson moved to [[Berlin]], where he continued to introduce reforms in beliefs and divine service. For this purpose he opened in his own house a hall for worship in which eloquent sermons were delivered by Zunz, Eduard Kley (1789–1867), and Isaak Lewin Auerbach. Eduard Kley founded in 1817 the [[Hamburg Temple]] in this spirit. -  However, the [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussian]] government, remembering the [[France|French]] sympathies of Jacobson, [[Hamburg Temple disputes|and receiving continued complaints from the Orthodox rabbis]], ordered the services at Jacobson's house discontinued. Jacobson, using the title Consistorial President rtrd. ({{lang-de|Konsistorialpräsident a.D.}}), aroused some unrest among Protestant clergy in Berlin, who considered that title to be exclusive for the retired [[wikt:consistory|consistorial presidents]] of the [[Evangelical Church in Prussia]].

Throughout his life Jacobson seized every opportunity to promote a cordial understanding between Jews and Christians, and his great wealth enabled him to support many poor of both faiths. His grave is preserved in the Jewish cemetery on [[Schönhauser Allee]] in Berlin.

'''''Land&amp;Liberty''''' is a quarterly [[magazine]] of popular political economics: its focus is the relationship between land and natural resource rights and 21st century economic policy. Published in the UK it covers international affairs and events from a global perspective.

The magazine contains major features, editorial and comment, news and reports, reviews, interviews and readers' letters.

== Nature and focus of the magazine ==

''Land&amp;Liberty'' has no political alignment in the conventional sense. However the magazine is not editorially neutral on issues. ''Land&amp;Liberty's'' key concern is how the global common wealth should be used, and it aims to demonstrate that this question is key to effective and just public policy—to the sustainable bridging of private life, the public sector and common resources.&lt;ref&gt;Statement of Values, ''Land&amp;Liberty'', vol. 116, no. 1224, summer 2009, p.3&lt;/ref&gt; ''Land&amp;Liberty's'' focus therefore is radical justice in property rights and taxation.

== Modern global influence ==

''Land&amp;Liberty'' forecast the 2008 global crisis and housing crash. In the middle of the economic optimism of 2004, it wrote: "There’s trouble ahead. A housing crash is coming."&lt;ref&gt;''Land&amp;Liberty'', vol. 111, no. 1210, late summer 2004, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Its 'Crash' cover story issue was published in the first week of September 2007, just days before the [[Northern rock#Subprime mortgage crisis and nationalisation|events at Northern Rock]] that caught the economic establishment unawares.&lt;ref&gt;''Land&amp;Liberty'', vol. 114, no. 1219, autumn 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 1980s ''Land&amp;Liberty'' has been an influence on the political opposition within Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;''Land&amp;Liberty'', vol. 115, no. 1222, autumn 2008, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2008, the [[Movement for Democratic Change - Tsvangirai|Movement for Democratic Change]] presented their political programme for the [[2008 Zimbabwean political negotiations|coalition government]] that they had entered into with the [[Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front]] (ZANU-PF) party. It included a policy for raising public revenue from a [[land value tax|tax on land values]], as advocated by ''Land&amp;Liberty'': "the MDC will through an Act of Parliament establish a Land Commission whose mandate is to…[i]ntroduce an equitable Land Tax".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kubatana.net/html/archive/polpar/080808mdc.asp?sector=LANDR&amp;year=0&amp;range_start=1 |title=''From ready to govern to preparing to govern'', Movement for Democratic Change, 8th August 2008 |accessdate=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party’s Policy Coordinator General, [[Eddie Cross]], wrote in a 2009 article in ''Land&amp;Liberty'' that his party’s new policies would help ensure that "secure communities will become free communities with the capacity to confront and control those in charge of the state".&lt;ref&gt;''Land&amp;Liberty'', vol. 116, no. 1224, summer 2009, p. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==

Land&amp;Liberty is the world's longest-running periodical advocating the social reform advanced by [[Henry George]]&lt;ref&gt;"Land and Liberty is now the longest-lived Georgist project in history, but still it struggles to gain the attention of an unheeding world." ''The American Journal of Economics and Sociology'', vol. 62, 2003, p. 615&lt;/ref&gt;—of whom [[Albert Einstein]] once said: "one cannot imagine a more beautiful combination of intellectual keenness, artistic form and fervent love of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://lvtfan.typepad.com/lvtfans_blog/2009/05/albert-einstein-on-henry-george-.html |title=letter from Albert Einstein, on Henry George, to George's daughter Anna George DeMille (mother of choreographer Agnes DeMille)—first published in ''Land and Freedom'', New York, Joseph Dana Miller, May-June 1934 |accessdate=2009-08-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Land&amp;Liberty'' was launched in June 1894 under the title ''[[The Single Tax]]'', published as "The Organ of the Scottish Land Restoration Union".&lt;ref&gt;''The Single Tax'', vol. I, no. 1, June 1894&lt;/ref&gt; Perhaps foreseeing [[George Bernard Shaw]]’s later remark, in 1928, that "the Single Taxers are not wrong in principle; but they are behind the times",&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the periodical changed its title in 1902 to ''[[Land Values]]'' and subsequently in 1919 to ''Land&amp;Liberty''.&lt;ref&gt;''Land&amp;Liberty'', vol. XX, no. 301, London and Glasgow, June 1919, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genesis ===

The periodical was initially the campaigning voice of the Scottish Land Restoration Union.&lt;ref&gt;The ‘‘[[Scottish Land Restoration Union]]’’ was established in 1890 [‘‘[[The Single Tax]]’’, vol. IV, no. 48, May 1898, p. 8. "The eighth annual meeting of the Scottish Land Restoration Union was held on 22 April 1898…. in Glasgow"] out of the complex reorganisation that year of the [[Scottish Land Restoration League]] [’The Story of Land Values’ by John Paul, in ''[[Land Values]]'', vol. XVII, no. 253, June 1915, p. 10.] The family tree of the Scottish land reform movement in this period is complex, and here, ''inter alia'', the author concedes: "In my experience the Glasgow group of Single Taxers were never much addicted to formalities…." Republished, with further material, on the death of John Paul [''Land&amp;Liberty'', vol. 40, no. 468-469, May–June 1933, p. 219-220]. The 1890 reorganisation also spawned the [[Scottish League for the Taxation of Land Values]], which later was to take over the magazine.&lt;/ref&gt; The Union and its antecedents were a contemporary political force in Scotland, launching the career of [[Keir Hardie]],&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; the first socialist elected to the UK Parliament, who went on to become the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]]'s first leader. Inspired by Henry George, the Union's activism helped deliver—through its publication ''The Single Tax'': "an American impulse behind the Scottish labor movement, which became historic in making the modern Labour party, and in forging the character of twentieth-century Britain."&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; Yet within its first year—recording historic shudders in the evolution of British socialism and the birth of the Labour party—the magazine was writing: "what have the Labour Party to offer us? Anything or everything but the single tax.".&lt;ref&gt;"The Labour Party and The Single Tax", ''The Single Tax'', vol. I, no. 5, October 1894, p.4&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early contributors ===

Early contributions to the magazine included original writing by [[Henry George]]&lt;ref&gt;"The Right to Work" by Henry George, ''The Single Tax'', vol. I, no. 2, July 1894, p. 1-2&lt;/ref&gt; (including first publishings of private material&lt;ref&gt;"Letter to Joseph Legget", ''The Single Tax'', vol. III, no. 27, August 1897&lt;/ref&gt;), [[Arthur Withy]],&lt;ref&gt;"Do the Government Mean Business?" by Arthur Withy, ''The Single Tax'', vol. I, no. 8, January 1895&lt;/ref&gt; [[Louis Freeland Post|Louis F Post]]&lt;ref&gt;"Can the tax be shifted?" ''The Single Tax'', vol. I, no. 9, February 1895&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Leo Tolstoy]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Single Tax'', vol. I, no. 2, June 1894, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; (again including first publishings of private material&lt;ref&gt;"Society", ''The Single Tax'', vol. IV, no. 39, August 1897, p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;).

The magazine published its correspondence from around the world, such as from New Zealand's [[Patrick O'Regan]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Single Tax'' vol. I, no. 12, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; and enjoyed secondary publishing rights from writers and thinkers such as [[Mark Twain]]&lt;ref&gt;"Archimedes" by Mark Twain, ''The Single Tax'', vol. I, no. 9, January 1895&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref&gt;"Right to the use of the earth" by Herbert Spencer, ''The Single Tax'', vol. III, no. 32, January 1897&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The twentieth century ===

[[File:Land Values vol21 no244.jpg|thumb|Before the magazine's change of name, ''Land Values'', vol. XXI, no. 244, September 1914 reported the outbreak of World War I.]]

Through the years ''Land&amp;Liberty'' has reported on and contributed to the debate on major world events. It has provided analyses of, among other things, the 'Irish Problem', the Scottish crofting movement and the Highland Clearances, the genesis of two World Wars, the creation of the United Nations and the other global institutions, the formulation of the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights, Europe's withdrawal from empire’s colonial project, and the middle east conflict.

The paper reported extensively the events surrounding the 1909 UK [[People’s Budget]], and the resultant [[Parliament Act 1911|House of Lords reform]]—contributing a major voice in the contemporary public debate. The paper's reporters recorded a unique archive of speeches by Lloyd George,&lt;ref&gt;'Mr Lloyd George at Limehouse' (Limehouse speech, 30 July 1909, ''Land Values'', vol. XVI, no. 184, September 1909, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Churchill,&lt;ref&gt;'Mr Churchill at Edinburgh' (17 July 1909), ''Land Values'', vol. XVI, no. 183, August 1909, p. 57-59&lt;/ref&gt; Asquith&lt;ref&gt;'The Prime Minister and the tax on land values' (speech in Sheffield, 21 May 1909), ''Land Values'', vol. XVI, no. 181, June 1909, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and Campbell-Bannerman&lt;ref&gt;'The government and land reform', (Holborn Restaurant speech, 20 April 1907), ''Land Values'', vol. XIII, no. 156, May 1907, p. 225-226&lt;/ref&gt; among others, as they toured the country in support of their cause.

The '''Legislative Council of Sierra Leone''' was the official executive body that governed the [[Sierra Leone Colony and Protectorate|Crown Colony of Sierra Leone]]. The Members of the Colonial Council were accorded the title of 'Honorable' and were responsible for decision-making in the Colony of Sierra Leone.

==Sierra Leone Company Council==
The [[Sierra Leone Company]] was the official company that founded the Colony of Sierra Leone and established the governing council body that governed the private colony of Sierra Leone.

==Colonial Council of Sierra Leone==
The Colonial Council or Governor's Council of Sierra Leone was organised in a similar structure to colonial councils in [[India]] and elsewhere. 

The Council was headed by the [[List of colonial governors of Sierra Leone|Governor of Sierra Leone]] and the senior colonial council was composed of the Chief Justice and Colonial Secretary of Sierra Leone.

==Legislative Council of Sierra Leone==
In 1863, the Colonial Council of Sierra Leone was reorganised as the Legislative Council in accordance with other British Crown Colonies in the Empire. Sierra Leonean merchants and professionals were appointed as 'Unofficial Members' of the Legislative Council and could advise, but not veto, the bills of law that were passed by the Executive Council.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7476">A '''milk quota''' (or more accurately '''dairy produce quota''') was one of the measures used by governments in the European Union to intervene in [[agriculture in the United Kingdom|agriculture]].  Their purpose was to bring rising milk production under control.  Milk quotas were attached to land holdings, and they represented a cap on the amount of milk that a farmer could sell every year without paying a levy.  Milk quotas were assets; they could be bought and sold, or acquired or lost by other means, and there was a market for them.

Milk quotas were withdrawn on 31 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Whittaker, Geoff: ''RIP MQ'', Farm Law issue #217 (March 2015) pp. 6-7.  ISSN 0964-8488&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Milk quotas were first introduced in the United Kingdom on 2 April 1984 under the Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 1984&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1984/1047/contents/made Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 1984.]&lt;/ref&gt;, which reflected the then [[European Economic Community]] (now the [[European Union]]'s) [[Common Agricultural Policy]].{{#tag:ref|The relevant enactment is Council Regulation (EEC) 804/68, as amended.  The current rules are now in Council Regulation (EEC) 3950/92.&lt;ref name="W243"&gt;Williams 2011, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HMRC"&gt;[http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/manuals/vfoodmanual/vfood9950.htm Milk quotas], HMRC, retrieved 2 June 2011.]&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Notes"}}  Originally they were to run until 1989, but they were extended several times, and were not renewed for the period following 31 March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;Daugbjerg, Carsten and Alan Swinbank. 'Explaining the 'Health Check' of the Common Agricultural Policy: Budgetary Politics, Globalisation and Paradigm Change Revisited' in ''Policy Studies'', 32:2, pp. 127-141. p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="W243" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HMRC" /&gt;

Each member of the European Economic Community was allowed to produce dairy products up to a cap, which was based on each state's 1981 production, plus 1%.&lt;ref&gt;Bateman, Curtis and Macadam 2006, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;  The cap was designated the "reference quantity".  A levy to the EEC was due on production in excess of the reference quantity.  This levy was then to be recovered from the farmers or dairies involved.  Until 2002, recovery of the levy was down to the [[Intervention Board for Agricultural Produce]].  It was then recovered by the [[Rural Payments Agency]] on behalf of [[Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs|DEFRA]] (the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs).&lt;ref name="W244"&gt;Williams 2011, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 1994&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1994/672/contents/made Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 1994.]&lt;/ref&gt;, which came into effect from 1 April 1994, substantially revised the old structure.  Until 31 March 1994, the [[Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (United Kingdom)|MAFF]] ("Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food", a British government department that has since been replaced by DEFRA) was responsible for milk quotas, together with the Secretaries of State for Scotland and Wales and the Department of Agriculture for Northern Ireland&lt;ref&gt;See regulation 1(1) of the 1994 Regulations and the meaning of "Minister".&lt;/ref&gt;.  On the MAFF's behalf, Milk Marketing Boards kept a register of quotas that detailed which farmers or dairies held what quotas.  The Milk Marketing Boards were dissolved on 31 October 1994 (in England, Wales and Scotland) and 28 February 1995 (in [[Northern Ireland]]).

The final regulations governing milk quotas were the Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2005/465/contents/made Dairy Produce Quotas Regulations 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;, the Dairy Produce Quotas (Scotland) Regulations 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ssi/2005/91/contents/made Dairy Produce Quotas (Scotland) Regulations 2005.]&lt;/ref&gt;and the Dairy Produce (Quotas) (Wales) Regulations 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.gov.uk/wsi/2005/537/contents/made Dairy Produce Quotas (Wales) Regulations 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;, as amended.

==Structure==
There were five kinds of milk quota:&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2011, p. 244-245&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''Direct sales quota''', which were the ceiling amount of dairy produce that can be sold directly from an agricultural holding without liability for the levy;
*'''Wholesale quota''', which were the ceiling amount of dairy produce that can be sold to a wholesaler from an agricultural holding without liability for the levy;
*'''Purchaser quota''', which were the ceiling amount of dairy produce that a purchaser can buy from a wholesaler without liability for the levy;
*'''Purchaser special quota''', which formerly existed in parallel with purchaser quota, but were later subsumed into general milk quotas; and
*'''SLOM quota''', which was formerly a nominal milk quota allocated to farmers who had ceased or reduced dairy production.  This was also subsumed into general milk quotas.

==Acquisition and transfer==

The EEC did not originally mean for milk quotas to attract a value.  Contrary to their intent, milk quotas became a valuable asset, although prices fell towards the end of their life.  Milk quotas could be purchased outright or leased.&lt;ref name="W243" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prag 2003, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the quotas were normally attached to land, and transferred with it provided the transfer is not a tenancy of less than ten months, they could be traded separately.{{#tag:ref|This applied in England after the enactment of the Dairy Produce (Quotas) Regulations 1994, SI 1194/672, reg 13.&lt;ref name="W262"&gt;Williams 2011, p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="Notes"}}  The legality of such a transfer was questioned by the Courts, particularly in ''[[Carson v Cornwall County Council]]'' [1993] 1 EGLR 21, [1993] 03 EG 119, but since 1994 was accepted, at least in a limited way, in for example ''[[Harris v Barclays Bank Plc]] [1997] 2 EGLR 15, [1997] 45 EG 145, CA.&lt;ref name="W262" /&gt;

Milk quotas could also be transferred without payment, where the tenant of a holding under the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 ceased to use that land for dairy farming purposes for five years and transferred that quota to other land that he held for dairy farming purposes, provided there was no quota protection clause in the tenancy.  In the absence of such a clause, a tenant under either the Agricultural Holdings Act 1986 or the Agricultural Tenancies Act 1995 also seemed, in principle, to be free to sell the quota attaching to the land he rented on the open market.  This has been called quota "massage" or even quota "theft", though Williams (2011) calls this last term "inelegant and inappropriate", such a transfer being apparently lawful.&lt;ref&gt;Williams 2011, p. 262-263.&lt;/ref&gt;

Disputes about milk quota were generally referred to arbitration.

'''NGO Monitor''' ('''Non-governmental Organization Monitor''') is a [[non-governmental organization]] based in [[Jerusalem]], which analyzes and reports on the output of the international NGO community from a pro-Israel perspective.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/articles.php?type=about |title=About NGO Monitor |publisher=NGO Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been characterized as being pro-Israel&lt;ref name="economist.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.economist.com/node/9804231 |title=Boycotting Israel: New pariah on the block |work=The Economist |date=13 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="jta.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jta.org/2007/08/31/news-opinion/haaretz-columnist-dropped-by-british-zionists |title=Ha'aretz columnist dropped by British Zionists | publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency|JTA]] |date=31 August 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as right-wing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130617-biased-wikipedia-israel-political-meddling-arnie-draiman-monitor-ngo |title=Biased Wikipedia editing in Israel raises concerns of political meddling |publisher=France24 |agency=Haaretz |date=17 June 2013 |quote=Draiman concealed the facts that he was an employee of NGO Monitor, often described as a right-wing group, and that he was using a second username, which is forbidden under Wikipedia's rules. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203023611/http://www.france24.com/en/20130617-biased-wikipedia-israel-political-meddling-arnie-draiman-monitor-ngo |archivedate=3 February 2017 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; NGO Monitor says in its [[mission statement]] that it was founded "to promote accountability, and advance a vigorous discussion on the reports and activities of humanitarian NGOs in the framework of the Arab–Israeli conflict." 

The organization was founded in 2001 by [[Gerald M. Steinberg]] under the auspices of the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcpa.org/about-jun04.htm |title=About the Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |publisher=Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203023611/http://www.france24.com/en/20130617-biased-wikipedia-israel-political-meddling-arnie-draiman-monitor-ngo |archivedate=3 February 2017 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NGO Monitor became a legally and financially independent organization in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.guidestar.org.il/en/organization/580465508 |title=העמותה לאחריות ארגונים לא ממשלתיים (ע"ר) |language=Hebrew |trans-title=NGO Monitor |publisher=Guidestar}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization has been criticized by academic figures, diplomats, and journalists who have said that NGO Monitor's research is not objective,&lt;ref name="Friedman"/&gt; that it does not examine right-wing NGOs,&lt;ref name="Edwards2012" /&gt; and that it puts out information that it knows is wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yehudit Karp |date=6 March 2012 |url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-undisguised-agenda/ |title=NGO Monitor and Adalah: The thinly veiled agenda |publisher=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Letters/Article.aspx?id=204245 |title=More on NGO Funding |quote=as Prof. Steinberg is fully aware from the various conversations we have had with him}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other journalists have praised the organization for investigating and exposing self-described human rights groups as being what they call anti-Israeli groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jennifer|first1=Rubin|title=Right Turn - Mourning on International Human Rights Day|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-turn/2010/12/international_human_rights_day.html|publisher=Washington Post|accessdate=4 November 2016|date=9 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==
NGO Monitor states that its mission is to "end the practice used by certain self-declared 'humanitarian NGOs' of exploiting the label 'universal human rights values' to promote politically and ideologically motivated agendas".&lt;ref name="about"/&gt;  A number of academics have written that NGO Monitor's aims and activities are political in nature.&lt;ref name="Edwards2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name=NC&gt;{{cite book|last=Chazan|first=Naomi|title=Israel in the World: Legitimacy and Exceptionalism|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0415624150|pages=79–80|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VXkerb_JH2UC&amp;lpg=PA80&amp;dq=NGO%20monitor%20right%20wing&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=NGO%20monitor%20right%20wing&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JPeters/&gt;

The organization's leader Gerald M. Steinberg has reportedly worked for the Israeli Foreign Ministry and the Office of the Prime Minister while heading NGO Monitor.&lt;ref&gt;[http://972mag.com/what-is-ngo-monitors-connection-to-the-israeli-government/90239/ ''What is NGO Monitor’s connection to the Israeli government?'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and staff==
NGO Monitor is the central project of the Organization for NGO Responsibility, an independent non-profit organization registered in Israel. Its president is Gerald M. Steinberg, professor of Political Science at [[Bar-Ilan University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geraldsteinberg.com/ |title=Professor Gerald Steinberg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its staff includes:&lt;ref name="about" /&gt;

==Funding==
Its critics state that NGO Monitor is not transparent about its own funding, a claim denied by NGO Monitor.&lt;ref name="haaretz.co.il"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Peace-Now-95-percent-of-funding-for-right-wing-NGOs-hidden-from-public-437239 ''Peace Now: 95% of funding for right-wing NGOs hidden from public''].

Other acknowledged supporters are [[Nina Rosenwald]] (New York) and Newt Becker (Los Angeles).&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080412094358/http://www.ngo-monitor.org/articles.php?cat_id=17 ''Founding Donor'']. NGO Monitor. Archived on 12 April 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Since its separation from the [[Jerusalem Center for Public Affairs]] (JCPA) and its formation as an independent organization in 2007, NGO Monitor has drawn on a wider range of funding sources. NGO Monitor has said it receives no governmental support and is currently funded by private donors and foundations, although it did receive some funds, in 2010 and 2011, via The [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] (JAFI), a quasi-governmental agency.&lt;ref name=financial_reports&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130921183319/http://www.ngo-monitor.org/pdf/NGOM_signed_audit2010english.pdf ''The Amutah For Financial Responsibility (R.A.)

In 2010, the organization received a $500,000 grant from ''Research + Evaluation = Promoting Organizational Responsibility and Transparency'' (REPORT), formerly known as ''American Friends of NGO Monitor'' (AFNGOM). Private donors in the US were asked on the NGO Monitor's website to donate via REPORT.&lt;ref name=ngo_donation&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130921183319/http://www.ngo-monitor.org/articles.php?cat_id=17 ''TO MAKE A DONATION''].

According to a February 2012 article written by [[Uri Blau]] in ''Haaretz'', his examination of NGO Monitor's finances revealed that "the organization sought to block the publication of one contributor and to get hundreds of thousands of Shekels from anonymous sources".&lt;ref name="haaretz.co.il"&gt;{{cite news |author=Uri Blau |url=http://www.haaretz.co.il/magazine/1.1636887 |script-title=he:העמותה שעוקבת אחר ארגוני השמאל לא רוצה שתדעו מי תורם לה |newspaper=Haaretz |language=Hebrew |trans-title=NGO Monitor: The association that tracks organizations of the Left does not want you to know who contributes to it |date=10 February 2012 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The donations in question were channeled through the [[Jewish Agency for Israel]] and Matan, and originated with undisclosed donors from outside Israel. In the same article, Jason Edelstein, NGO Monitor's communications director, is quoted as saying "all of our financial information is fully disclosed with the Registrar for Non-Profits as required by law".&lt;ref name="haaretz.co.il"/&gt;

A 2015 report published by the [[Peace Now]] movement discovered that NGO Monitor failed to file a legally-required disclosure regarding the source of its funding, and that much of the who funds the group is hidden from the public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Peace-Now-95-percent-of-funding-for-right-wing-NGOs-hidden-from-public-437239 ''Peace Now: 95% of funding for right-wing NGOs hidden from public''].

[[Rashid Khalidi]] describes NGO Monitor as an organisation that opposes legal means against Israel while at the same time being a proponent of the use of legal means against those who criticise Israel.&lt;ref name="Khalidi2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rashid Khalidi|title=Brokers of Deceit: How the U.S. Has Undermined Peace in the Middle East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LHYPnxwPnlwC&amp;pg=RA1-PT127|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=12 March 2013|publisher=Beacon Press|isbn=978-0-8070-4476-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sabine Lang writes that NGO Monitor has focused on the use of legal means to limit funding to NGOs.&lt;ref name="Lang2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Sabine Lang|title=NGOs, Civil Society, and the Public Sphere|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMl-Rgs8nRoC&amp;pg=PA116|accessdate=30 May 2013|date=15 October 2012|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-107-02499-1|pages=116–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, Gerald Steinberg brought a case before the [[European Court of Justice]] arguing that it was wrong of the [[European Commission]] to withhold some of the contents of over 200 financial documents that NGO Monitor had requested, regarding the funding of Israeli and Palestinian NGOs.&lt;ref name=EJC2012&gt;{{cite web | title = Order Of The General Court (Fifth Chamber), Case T‑17/10 | date = 27 November 2012 | author = Court of Justice of the European Union| url = http://curia.europa.eu/juris/document/document.jsf?text=&amp;docid=131828&amp;pageIndex=0&amp;doclang=EN&amp;mode=lst&amp;dir=&amp;occ=first&amp;part=1&amp;cid=1173783 |accessdate=26 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| author = Dan Izenberg | title = NGO Monitor turns to EU court for transparency | newspaper = The Jerusalem Post | date = 21 January 2010 | url = http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=166271 |accessdate=26 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2012, the court said that NGO Monitor could not receive the financial documents regarding 16 projects of [[human rights]] organizations in Israel, calling it "in part, manifestly inadmissible and, in part, manifestly lacking any foundation in law".&lt;ref name=EJC2012/&gt; The EU commented "that the Middle East is an unstable region, and therefore such information may pose a danger to human rights groups". Steinberg said that "for over 10 years the EU has been keeping the information regarding funding of NGOs in complete secrecy. My conclusion is that they have something to hide. In addition to a violation of basic principles of government transparency, the secret funding is trying to manipulate the democratic process in Israel." [[Michael Sfard]], a lawyer specializing in international human rights law said Steinberg "invents demons and then chases them.... All the data about the donations of foreign countries to Israeli human rights organizations are published on the Web sites of the organizations, as required by law."&lt;ref name=HaarEU&gt;{{cite news| author = Chaim Levinson | title = EU court rejects NGO Monitor petition to release details on Israeli rights groups | newspaper = Haaretz | date = 25 December 2012 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/eu-court-rejects-ngo-monitor-petition-to-release-details-on-israeli-rights-groups-1.489919 |accessdate=26 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, NGO Monitor issued a report on the findings of the 2011 Israeli law requiring Israeli non-governmental organizations to disclose financial contributions from foreign donors and governments. The report assessed that foreign funding of Israeli NGOs totalled NIS 34,355,579 in 2012.&lt;ref name=jp302155&gt;{{cite news |author=Sam Sokol |url=http://www.jpost.com/NationalNews/Article.aspx?id=302155 |title=Groups spar with NGO Monitor over foreign funding |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |date=5 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gerald Steinberg, president of NGO Monitor, called the new law an "international model for transparency". Steinberg also stated his opinion that "the amount of foreign funding going to NGOs involved in polarizing activity in the context of the Arab–Israeli conflict as 'alarming'."&lt;ref name=jp302155/&gt; The [[Association for Civil Rights in Israel]] (ACRI) spokesman Marc Grey stated that donors to ACRI were already listed on its website making the law "redundant", the donations allowed organizations to protect human rights and freedoms, adding that "the basis for Israel's relations with democratic countries is shared values – democracy and human rights above all – the State of Israel itself is a recipient of funds from these very same countries, in the framework of trade agreements, investments, loans, and donations."&lt;ref name=jp302155/&gt; A spokesman for [[B'Tselem]] said the information had been published on their website for years and said that NGO Monitor is a group of "Israeli government apologists masquerading as an objective watchdog. They do not even practice what they preach in terms of their own transparency and their sloppy, third-rate research."&lt;ref name=jp302155/&gt;

===Criticisms of NGOs===
The organization formerly criticized the [[Ford Foundation]] for funding the 2001 [[World Conference against Racism 2001|World Conference against Racism, Racial Discrimination, Xenophobia and Related Intolerance]], which took place in [[Durban]], [[South Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article.php?id=53 |title=Ford Foundation NGO Funding Update - Implementation of Post-Durban Guidelines is Slow and Lacks Transparency |date=28 April 2005 |publisher=NGO Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ford Foundation has modified its policies regarding funding of NGOs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.netwmd.com/articles/article293.html |publisher=War to Mobilize Democracy (netWMD) |title='Stunning Reversal:' Ford Foundation Agrees to Stop Funding Anti-Israeli and Anti-Semitic Groups |author=Andrew L. Jaffee |date=21 November 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also has taken exception to such accusations and says its involvement in the Palestinian territories reflects its belief that a just solution to the conflict is vitally important to the region and the peoples directly affected and that it also funds groups such as the [[New Israel Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Bradford Smith |author2=Vice President |author3=Ford Foundation |url=http://forward.com/articles/6922/letter-october--/ |newspaper=The Forward |title=Ford Foundation Backs Proponents of Peace |date=24 October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NGO Monitor also criticized B'Tselem, "The Israeli Information Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/editions/v2n12/v2n12-4.htm |title=Betselem: Report Uses Outdated Sources and the Rhetoric of Demonization, ''NGO Monitor Analysis'' (Vol. 2 No. 12) |date=15 August 2004 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160102104059/http://ngo-monitor.org/editions/v2n12/v2n12-4.htm |archivedate=2 January 2016 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

NGO Monitor has criticized the New Israel Fund, which states that its primary objective is "to strengthen Israel's democracy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nif.org/about/new-israel-fund-principles |title=New Israel Fund Principles |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528072709/http://www.nif.org/about/new-israel-fund-principles |archivedate=28 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Larry Garber, then executive director of the New Israel Fund, and Eliezer Ya'ari, then NIF's Israel director and a retired Israeli air force major,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jewishtribune.ca/uncategorized/2008/09/24/new-israel-fund-director-responds-to-criticism |newspaper=The Jewish Tribune |title=New Israel Fund director responds to criticism |date=24 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141006072725/http://www.jewishtribune.ca/uncategorized/2008/09/24/new-israel-fund-director-responds-to-criticism |archivedate=6 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; wrote in an op-ed in ''The Jerusalem Post'' that if Israel were to accept the premises of Gerald Steinberg, the director of NGO Monitor, then "Israel's credibility—and, more important, the nation's morality—will suffer."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Larry Garber |author2=Eliezar Ya'ari |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |title=Who's really damaging Israel's image? |url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel/Whos-really-damaging-Israels-image |date=19 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the stated aim of encouraging critical debate on the role of NGOs in the Middle East conflict, NGO Monitor held a 2006 conference in Jerusalem with 21 humanitarian aid groups in attendance. A panel discussed the pros and cons of NGOs dealing with [[Hamas]].&lt;ref name=EJP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ejpress.org/article/9479 |publisher=European Jewish Press |title=EU to discuss Middle East NGOs funding |date=7 July 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120214001158/http://www.ejpress.org/article/9479 |archivedate=14 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JP&gt;{{cite news |author=Yoav Appel | newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |title=Major NGOs skip 'unfair' monitoring conference |date=14 June 2006 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Middle-East/Major-NGOs-skip-unfair-monitoring-conference}}&lt;/ref&gt; NGOs such as [[Amnesty International]], B'Tselem and [[Physicians for Human Rights]] were invited to speak but declined.&lt;ref name=EJP /&gt; Amnesty International said the conference did "not give a balanced ground for open and fair dialogue" while another human rights group accused NGO Monitor of "partiality".&lt;ref name=JP/&gt;

===Editing Wikipedia===
The on-line communications editor of NGO Monitor, Arnie Draiman, was indefinitely banned from editing articles about the Israeli-Arab conflict for biased editing, concealing his place of work and using a second account in a way that is forbidden by Wikipedia policy.&lt;ref name=OY2013&gt;{{cite web|author1=Oded Yaron|title=Aligning text to the right: Is a political organization editing Wikipedia to suit its interests? - Features|url=http://www.haaretz.com/israel-news/.premium-1.530285|website=haaretz.com|publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=4 November 2016|date=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Draiman was a major contributor to the articles of his employers NGO Monitor and [[Gerald Steinberg]], and performed hundreds of edits of human rights organizations, such as [[B'Tselem]], the [[New Israel Fund]], [[Human Rights Watch]] and many others NGO Monitor's president, Professor Gerald Steinberg, opposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Haaretz|title=Biased Wikipedia editing in Israel raises concerns of political meddling - France 24|url=http://www.france24.com/en/20130617-biased-wikipedia-israel-political-meddling-arnie-draiman-monitor-ngo|website=France 24|accessdate=4 November 2016|date=17 June 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161003062705/http://www.france24.com/en/20130617-biased-wikipedia-israel-political-meddling-arnie-draiman-monitor-ngo|archivedate=3 October 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

===Support===
Dr. Yoaz Hendel, a former adviser to Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu who is now a columnist at ''[[Yediot Aharonot]]'', said that NGO Monitor is a "serious voice in the field".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org.il/data/images/File/YAHendel310812.jpg |script-title=he:בעיטת קרן |trans-title=Corner Kick |publisher=NGO Monitor |language=Hebrew}} image of a clipping from ''Yediot Acharanot'' from September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[The Forward]]'', in an article written by Nathan Jeffay in January 2011, said that NGO Monitor is "Israel's most prominent watchdog of human rights groups".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Nathan Jeffay |url=http://www.forward.com/articles/134820/ |title=Does Arab Money Fund Left-wing Israeli NGOs? |newspaper=The Forward |date=28 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jennifer Rubin (journalist)|Jennifer Rubin]], in an opinion piece on the website of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' in December 2010, said that NGO Monitor is "an organization that investigates and sharply criticizes many self-described human rights groups as thinly disguised anti-Israel outfits".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/right-turn/2010/12/international_human_rights_day.html |title=Mourning on International Human Rights Day |date=9 December 2010 |publisher=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yossi Alpher, writing in ''The Forward'', said that since its inception, NGO Monitor has "exposed the manipulation of some human rights campaigns to malign Israel unjustly and even to undermine its viability as a Jewish state". But Alpher also complains that NGO Monitor "seems dead set on eliminating human rights monitoring of Israel entirely and smearing anyone who supports this vital activity".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Yossi Alpher |url=http://forward.com/articles/121170/ngo-monitor-needs-a-monitor |date=25 December 2009 |newspaper=The Forward |title=NGO Monitor needs a monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2013 [[Menachem Begin Heritage Center#Research and education|Menachem Begin Prize]] was awarded to NGO Monitor, "a leading organization defending the State of Israel and the Jewish people." The Begin Prize is awarded for “extraordinary act(s) for the benefit of the State of Israel and/or the Jewish People.” [[Natan Sharansky]]  said,  “NGO Monitor is the leading organization defending the State of Israel and the Jewish people.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jpost.com/Magazine/Features/Continuing-Menachem-Begins-legacy-333321?prmusr=CsukKT0DlUgpXVwQToiZbKfOpYgdNc5rYMKkLMKm%2feRiaGVaRqu18vQaOaQ3LKtb    Continuing Menachem Begin’s legacy, Jerusalem Post, November 28, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
[[Leonard Fein]], writing for ''[[The Forward]]'' in 2005, said that NGO Monitor is "an organization that believes that the best way to defend Israel is to condemn anyone who criticizes it."&lt;ref name="forward"/&gt;

Yehudit Karp, a member of the International Council of the New Israel Fund and a former deputy attorney general of Israel, said that NGO Monitor has released information "it knew to be wrong, along with some manipulative interpretation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yehudit Karp |date=6 March 2012 |url=http://blogs.timesofisrael.com/the-undisguised-agenda/ |title=NGO Monitor and Adalah: The thinly veiled agenda |publisher=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Israel Fund said in May 2011 that NGO Monitor "knowingly published false information in its newsletter", regarding the NIF funding of [[Coalition of Women for Peace]] (CWP). NIF stated that NGO Monitor's director was provided with the correct information verbally in advance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|last=Paiss |first=Naomi |title=NGO Monitor Attacks New Israel Fund Based on Information It Knew to Be Wrong |date=12 May 2011 |publisher=New Israel Fund |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://nif.org/media-center/press-releases/1054-ngo-monitor-attacks-new-israel-fund-based-on-information-it-knew-to-be-wrong |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106162834/http://www.nif.org/media-center/press-releases/1054-ngo-monitor-attacks-new-israel-fund-based-on-information-it-knew-to-be-wrong |archivedate=6 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; NGO Monitor responded by asserting that its report was based on NIF grant information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gerald M.

NIF also stated that it asked CWP to remove mention of NIF's name from the CWP website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|last=Paiss |first=Naomi |title=More (to put it charitably) mistakes from NGO Monitor |date=15 May 2011 |publisher=New Israel Fund |location=Washington, D.C. |url=http://nif.org/media-center/press-releases/1055-more-to-put-it-charitably-mistakes-from-ngo-monitor |accessdate=21 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140209082148/http://nif.org/media-center/press-releases/1055-more-to-put-it-charitably-mistakes-from-ngo-monitor |archivedate=9 February 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, HRW issued a statement saying, "NGO Monitor ... conducts no field investigations and condemns anyone who criticizes Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.hrw.org/en/node/84956 |title=Visit to Saudi Arabia and False Allegations of Human Rights Watch 'Bias' |date=6 August 2009 |publisher=Human Rights Watch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Uriel Heilman, a managing editor for the Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA) and a senior reporter for ''[[The Jerusalem Post]]'', wrote in an online opinion column that there were a "couple of disingenuous (read: inaccurate) elements" in the May 2009 digest of NGO Monitor. Heilman rhetorically asked whether the situation itself was "enough for Steinberg and NGO Monitor's followers without Steinberg having to stretch the truth?" Gerald Steinberg, head of NGO Monitor, later conceded the phrasing was confusing and revised the statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Uriel Heilman |url=http://www.jta.org/2009/06/17/news-opinion/the-telegraph/playing-fast-and-loose-with-the-facts-at-ngo-monitor-updated |publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency |title=Playing fast and loose with the facts at NGO Monitor |date=17 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kathleen Peratis, a member of the board of Human Rights Watch, called into question the research methodology underlying an op-ed by NGO Monitor's Steinberg for not saying specifically where or when HRW statements have been unverifiable.&lt;ref name="Kathleen Peratis"&gt;{{cite news |author=Kathleen Peratis |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/29/AR2006082901045.html |newspaper=The Washington Post |title=Diversionary Strike On a Rights Group |date=30 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she criticized NGO Monitor for accusations against Human Right Watch and its "executive director, whose father fled Nazi Germany". Peratis took issue with an op-ed by NGO Monitor's Gerald Steinberg titled "Ken Roth's Blood Libel",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gerald M. Steinberg |title=Ken Roth's Blood Libel |date=26 August 2006 |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Op-Ed-Contributors/Ken-Roths-blood-libel |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; and argues those like NGO Monitor "who want selective exemption of Israel from the rules of war" may not "have faced the implications of getting what they wish for".&lt;ref name="Kathleen Peratis"/&gt;

In 2009, David Newman criticized NGO Monitor for concentrating "almost entirely with a critique of peace-related NGOs and especially those which focus on human rights, as though there were no other NGOs to examine". He said that NGO Monitor, which he describes as a right-wing organization, had consistently refused requests to investigate the activities and funding of right-wing NGOs, many of which, Newman said, were facilitating illegal activity in the West Bank.&lt;ref name=DNJP&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Article.aspx?id=161865|last=Newman|first=David|title=Borderline Views: Who's monitoring the monitor?|accessdate=6 May 2012|newspaper=The Jerusalem Post|date=30 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, NGO Monitor wrote that it is "an independent research organization, providing detailed, systematic, and source-based analysis and publications regarding the activities of NGOs in the Arab-Israeli conflict. The ideological label employed by Newman, 'right wing', is neither accurate nor relevant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Yishai Hughes |url=http://www.ngo-monitor.org/article/newman_is_wrong_on_ngo_monitor |title=Newman is wrong on NGO Monitor |date=1 April 2010 |publisher=NGO Monitor}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newman also criticized NGO Monitor again in 2009, as well as in 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Asaf Shtull-Trauring |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/left-and-right-at-the-lectern-1.304989 |title=Left and right at the lectern |date=July 30, 2010 |newspaper=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=David Newman |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Article.aspx?id=269792 |title=Borderline Views: Time to promote the humanities |date=13 May 2012 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, thirteen Israeli human rights organizations released a common statement describing NGO Monitor and [[Im Tirtzu]] as "extremist", and criticised an "unbridled and incendiary attack" by them against human rights groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.acri.org.il/pdf/lettertoperes310110.pdf |date=31 January 2010 |title=Re: Assault and delegitimization of human rights organizations in Israel – warning and request of meeting}} letter to Shimon Peres, President of Israel; Reuven Rivlin, Knesset Speaker; and Benjamin Netanyahu, Prime Minister of Israel signed by the CEOs of 13 NGOs&lt;/ref&gt;

Ambassador Andrew Stanley, the EU representative to Israel, took issue with NGO Monitor's description of EU policy as operating in secret, writing that "as Prof. Steinberg is fully aware from the various conversations we have had with him, funding of projects by the European Union worldwide is carried out by open and public calls for proposals published on EU websites, including the website of the Delegation of the European Union to the State of Israel." &lt;ref&gt;http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Letters/Article.aspx?id=204245&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2014, [[Israeli Canadian]] journalist and author [[Matti Friedman]] described NGO Monitor as "a pro-Israel outfit and by no means an objective observer" &lt;ref name=Friedman &gt;{{cite news|last1=Friedman|first1=Matti|title=What the Media Gets Wrong About Israel|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/how-the-media-makes-the-israel-story/383262/3/|accessdate=10 December 2014|publisher=The Atlantic|date=30 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Michael Edwards (academic)|Michael Edwards]] lists NGO Monitor among a group of organisations who use deficiencies in NGO accountability as a pretext for politically motivated attacks to silence views with which they disagree. Edwards states that they "single out liberal or progressive groups for criticism while ignoring the same problems, if that is what they are, among NGOs allied with conservative views".&lt;ref name="Edwards2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Michael Edwards|title=NGO Accountability: "Politics, Principles and Innovations"|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QIkM5htEZ98C&amp;pg=PT7|accessdate=29 May 2013|date=4 May 2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-136-56042-2|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Joel Peters, NGO Monitor's activities include "high profile campaigns with the aim of delegitimizing the activities of Israeli civil society and human rights organisations, especially those advocating the rights of Arab citizens of Israel and/or address the question of violations of human rights in the Occupied Territories",&lt;ref name=JPeters&gt;{{cite book|last=Peters|first=Joel|title=The European Union and the Arab Spring: Promoting Democracy and Human Rights in the Middle East|year=2012|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739174452|page=85|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IgxQPm0kpMC&amp;lpg=PA85&amp;dq=%22right%20wing%22%20ngo%20monitor&amp;pg=PA85#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; to which NGO Monitor responded by saying, "Our aims and objectives (holding political advocacy NGOs accountable, providing checks and balances, researching and publishing on these issues) are clearly spelled out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gerald M.

According to [[Naomi Chazan]], NGO Monitor is closely linked to a "tightly knit, coordinated set of associations" whose goal is to undermine liberal voices in Israel and entrench a negative image of them by means of having "continuously hammered away at their key message—in this instance, the abject disloyalty of certain civil society organizations and their funders and their collusion with Israel's most nefarious external detractors". Chazan states the aim is that "by reinforcing this mantra by every available means, innuendo could be transformed into fact".&lt;ref name="NC"/&gt;

In an editorial published by [[The Forward]], [[J.J. Goldberg]] termed the organization "one of the smoothest left-bashing operations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=JJ Goldberg |url=http://forward.com/articles/199099/turning-israel-day-parade-into-right-wing-echo-cha/ |date=29 May 2014|title=Turning Israel Day Parade Into Right-Wing Echo Chamber Rolling Down Fifth Ave |publisher=The Forward}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ilan Baruch, Israel's former ambassador to South Africa, said in a report by the Policy Working Group (PWG), published in September, 2018 that the organization "disseminates misleading and tendentious information, which it presents as factual in-depth research". NGO Monitor's efforts were designed to "defend and sustain [Israeli] government policies that help uphold Israel's occupation of ...the Palestinian territories".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://euobserver.com/foreign/142973|title=Former diplomats raise alarm on Israeli lobby group|last=Rettman|first=Andrew|date=2018-09-28|work=|access-date=2018-10-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://policyworkinggroup.org.il/report_en.pdf|title=SHRINKING SPACE, NGO Monitor: Defaming human rights organizations that criticize the Israeli occupation|last=|first=|date=September 2018|website=Policy Working Group|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political orientation==
NGO Monitor attempted to get [[The Electronic Intifada]]'s funding by the Dutch foundation [[Interchurch Organisation for Development Cooperation]] cut in 2010 by claiming that the medium was 'anti-Semitic and frequently compares Israeli policies with those of the Nazi regime.' It also claimed that EI's executive director campaigned to delegitimize and demonize Israel. The ICCO's website praised Electronic Intifada as "an internationally recognized daily news source", functioning as a counterweight to pro-Israeli reportage. The ICCO's chairman, Marinus Verweij, stated in reply:

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Electronic Intifada ... has become an important source of information from the occupied Palestinian territories. Newspapers such as ''[[The Washington Post]]'' and the [[Financial Times]] have frequently used material from the Electronic Intifada,' and that '(t)he rights of Palestinian people to a decent way of living are central in the news brought by the EI. The EI reports frequently about the violations of human rights and international humanitarian law by the State of Israel.

EI's [[Ali Abunimah]], answering the accusations, noted that in the 'scurrilous' claims, not one piece of evidence from the over 12,000 articles printed by EI since its inception in 2001 had been cited by the NGO.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ali Abunimah]], [http://jfjfp.com/?p=19540 'Escalation of efforts to undermine the solidarity movement,'] [[Jews for Justice for Palestinians]] 7 December 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a United States diplomatic cable, uncovered in the [[WikiLeaks]] documents, Prof. Gerald Steinberg said that "he did not want the NGO legislation to feed into the delegitimizing rhetoric, but that such an unintended consequence might be an acceptable cost to reduce the power of the NGOs' current monopolization of human rights rhetoric for politicized purposes."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cablegatesearch.net/cable.php?id=10TELAVIV439 |title=Knesset Considers Controversial NGO Legislation To Register As Foreign Agents |publisher=wikileaks}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2009 opinion column he writes for ''The Jerusalem Post'', [[Larry Derfner]] asserted that "NGO Monitor doesn't have a word of criticism for Israel, nor a word of acknowledgment, even grudging, for any detail in any human rights report that shows Israel to be less than utterly blameless. In fact, on the subject of Israel's human rights record, NGO Monitor doesn't have a word of disagreement with the Prime Minister's Office."&lt;ref name="JP-Derfner-2009-07-22"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.jpost.com/Opinion/Columnists/Rattling-the-Cage-The-smearing-of-human-rights-organizations |title=Rattling the Cage: The smearing of human rights organizations |last=Derfner |first=Larry |date=22 July 2009 |newspaper=The Jerusalem Post |accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John H. Richardson, writing in [[Esquire (magazine)|''Esquire'' magazine]]'s online magazine in 2009 described NGO Monitor as a "rabidly partisan organization that attacks just about anyone who dares to criticize Israel on any grounds". It notes that Steinberg is dedicated to fighting "the narrative war", and has made a "special project" of attacking Human Rights Watch.&lt;ref name=Esquire&gt;{{Cite news|last=Richardson |first=John |url=http://www.esquire.com/the-side/richardson-report/marc-garlasco-nazi-controversy-101309 |title=Why Is This Good Man Getting Hung Out to Dry? |work=[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]] |date=October 2009 |accessdate=29 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[op-ed]] published in 2005 by ''[[The Forward]]'', [[Leonard Fein]], a former professor of politics and Klutznick Professor of Contemporary Jewish Studies at [[Brandeis University]], takes issue with NGO Monitor's statement that Human Rights Watch (HRW) places "extreme emphasis on critical assessments of Israel" and has issued more reports about HRW than on any other of the 75 NGOs it concerns itself with. In his op-ed, Leonard Fein wrote that HRW has devoted more attention to five other nations in the region—[[Iraq]], [[Sudan]], [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]] and [[Iran]]—than they have to Israel; but that, despite extensive correspondence, Mr Steinberg has failed to correct the "misleading" statement about HRW on the NGO Watch website. Fein argues that NGO Monitor may not be free of the "narrow political and ideological preferences" of which it accuses HRW.&lt;ref name="forward"&gt;{{Cite news
|title=Monitoring The Monitor|author=Leonard Fein|url=http://www.forward.com/articles/3517/|newspaper=[[The Forward]]|date=20 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Forward]]'' wrote that NGO Monitor says it has increased Human Right Watch's reporting on Hamas, [[Hezbollah]] and the [[Palestinian Authority]] while Human Rights Watch has rejected the statements and said it was dealing with counterterrorism in a post-9/11 world.&lt;!-- Preceding sentence needs cleanup.--&gt;&lt;ref name="forward.com"&gt;{{cite news |title=Human Rights Watch To Increase Focus on Terrorism |author=Marc Perelman |date=29 July 2005 |newspaper=The Forward |url=http://forward.com/articles/2462/human-rights-watch-to-increase-focus-on-terrorism/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 article for the [[Political Research Associates]], Jean Hardisty and Elizabeth Furdon describe NGO Monitor as a "conservative NGO watchdog group ... which focuses on perceived threats to Israeli interests", adding that "the ideological slant of NGO Monitor's work is unabashedly pro-Israeli. It does not claim to be a politically neutral examination of NGO activities and practices."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=Jean Hardisty |author2=Elizabeth Furdon |url=http://www.publiceye.org/magazine/v18n1/hardisty_ngo.html |title=Policing Civil Society:NGO Watch |date=Spring 2004 |publisher=Political Research Associates |work=The Public Eye |volume=18 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ittijah]], Union of Arab Community-Based Organisations in Israel, has said NGO Monitor represents the interests and the say of the Israeli state rather than civil society's voice based on human rights values. Ittijah further states that NGO Monitor is guided by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Israel)|Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ittijah.org/?intLanguage=2&amp;chrSystem=item&amp;intPMenu=319&amp;intMenu=319&amp;intMenuType=2&amp;intCategory=386&amp;intItem=1769&amp;intItemType=2&amp;intItemDisplayType=4 |title=Ittijah: Statement on Israel's Pronouncement to Boycott |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727022923/http://www.ittijah.org/?intLanguage=2&amp;chrSystem=item&amp;intPMenu=319&amp;intMenu=319&amp;intMenuType=2&amp;intCategory=386&amp;intItem=1769&amp;intItemType=2&amp;intItemDisplayType=4 |archivedate=27 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Naomi Chazan, former New Israel Fund president, NGO Monitor is "tied to the national-religious right".&lt;ref name=NC /&gt;

In an op-ed published in the Jewish Journal in 2016, Noam Shelef wrote that NGO Monitor's leaders are affiliated with the current Israeli government, and that the organization only scrutinizes progressive critics of government policies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.jewishjournal.com/opinion/article/false_equivalence_in_israel&lt;/ref&gt;

==Associated Press "Ban" of NGO Monitor==

According to former [[Associated Press]] reporter [[Matti Friedman]], the AP bureau in Jerusalem gave "explicit orders to reporters...to never quote [NGO Monitor] or its director, an American-raised professor named Gerald Steinberg." Friedman continues, and says, "In my time as an AP writer moving through the local conflict, with its myriad lunatics, bigots, and killers, the only person I ever saw subjected to an interview ban was this professor."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =What the Media Gets Wrong About Israel | newspaper =The Atlantic | publisher =The Atlantic | date =November 30, 2014 | url =https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/11/how-the-media-makes-the-israel-story/383262/?single_page=true | accessdate = December 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AP responded by saying, "There was no "ban" on using Prof. Gerald Steinberg. He and his NGO Monitor group are cited in at least a half-dozen stories since the 2009 Gaza war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title =AP statement on Mideast coverage | newspaper =Associated Press | publisher =Associated Press | date =December 1, 2014 | url =http://www.ap.org/content/press-release/2014/ap-statement-on-mideast-coverage | accessdate =December 4, 2014 | deadurl =yes | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20141204110131/http://www.ap.org/content/press-release/2014/ap-statement-on-mideast-coverage | archivedate =4 December 2014 | df =dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Nuremberg Rally''' (officially ''{{Audio|De-Reichsparteitag.ogg|Reichsparteitag}}'', meaning ''[[Nazi Germany|Realm]] Party Convention''&lt;ref group=note&gt;Literally "Realm Party Day"&lt;/ref&gt;) was the annual rally of the [[Nazi Party]] in [[Germany]], held from 1923 to 1938.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burleigh|first=Michael|title=The Third Reich: A New History|year=2000|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=9780330487573|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They were large [[Nazi propaganda]] events, especially after [[Adolf Hitler's rise to power]] in 1933. These events were held at the [[Nazi party rally grounds]] in [[Nuremberg]] from 1933 to 1938 and are usually referred to in English as the "Nuremberg Rallies". Many films were made to commemorate them, the most famous of which are [[Leni Riefenstahl]]'s ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' and ''[[The Victory of Faith]]''.

== History and purpose ==
The first Nazi Party rallies took place in 1923 in [[Munich]] and in 1926 in [[Weimar]]. From 1927 on, they took place exclusively in [[Nuremberg]]. The Party selected Nuremberg for pragmatic reasons: it was in the center of the [[German Reich]] and the local ''[[Nazi party rally grounds#Luitpoldarena|Luitpoldhain]]'' (converted parkland) was well suited as a venue. In addition, the Nazis could rely on the well-organized local branch of the party in [[Franconia]], then led by ''[[Gauleiter]]'' [[Julius Streicher]]. The Nuremberg police were sympathetic to the event.

Later, the location was justified by the Nazi Party by putting it into the tradition of the [[Imperial Diet (Holy Roman Empire)|Imperial Diet]] (German ''Reichstag'') of the [[Holy Roman Empire]], considered the First ''Reich''. After 1933, the rallies took place near the time of the [[Autumnal equinox]], under the title of "The German people's National Party days" (''Reichsparteitage des deutschen Volkes''), which was intended to symbolize the solidarity between the German people and the Nazi Party. This point was further emphasized by the yearly growing number of participants, which finally reached over half a million from all sections of the party, the army, and the state.

==Rallies ==
[[File:Nuernberg 11 mai 1940 (2).jpg|thumb|Postal marking from Nuremberg, May 1940, referring to the ''Reichsparteitage'']]
Each rally was given a programmatic title, which related to recent national events:
*1923 &amp;ndash; The First Party Congress took place in Munich on January 27, 1923.
*1923 &amp;ndash; The "German day rally" was held in Nuremberg, September 1–2, 1923.
*1926 &amp;ndash; The 2nd Party Congress ("Refounding Congress") was held in Weimar, July 3–4, 1926.
*1927 &amp;ndash; The 3rd Party Congress ("Day of Awakening") was held in Nuremberg, August 19–21, 1927. The propaganda film ''[[Eine Symphonie des Kampfwillens]]'' was made at this rally.
*1929 &amp;ndash; The 4th Party Congress, known as the "Day of Composure", was held in Nuremberg, August 1–4, 1929. The propaganda film ''[[Der Nürnberger Parteitag der NSDAP]]'' was made at this rally.
*1933 &amp;ndash; The 5th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, August 30 – September 3, 1933. It was called the "Rally of Victory" (''Reichsparteitag des Sieges''). The term "victory" relates to the [[Machtergreifung|Nazi seizure of power]] and the victory over the [[Weimar Republic]]. The [[Leni Riefenstahl]] film ''[[Der Sieg des Glaubens]]'' was made at this rally. Hitler announced that from now on all Rallies would take place in Nuremberg.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/einestages/ns-machtergreifung-1933-der-faule-nazi-zauber-von-nuernberg-a-947874.html spiegel.de] (german)&lt;/ref&gt;
*1934 &amp;ndash; The 6th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, September 5–10, 1934, which was attended by about 700,000 Nazi Party supporters. Initially it did not have a theme. Later it was labeled the "Rally of Unity and Strength" (''Reichsparteitag der Einheit und Stärke''), "Rally of Power" (''Reichsparteitag der Macht''), or "Rally of Will" (''Reichsparteitag des Willens''). The Leni Riefenstahl film ''[[Triumph of the Will|Triumph des Willens]]'' was made at this rally.&lt;ref name="IMDB"&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0025913/ Triumph des Willens (1935)]&lt;/ref&gt; This rally was particularly notable due to [[Albert Speer]]'s [[Cathedral of light]]: 152 searchlights that cast vertical beams into the sky around the [[Nazi party rally grounds#Zeppelin Field|Zeppelin Field]] to symbolise the walls of a building&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historylearningsite.co.uk/propaganda_in_nazi_germany.htm Propaganda in Nazi Germany]&lt;/ref&gt;
*1935 &amp;ndash; The 7th Party Congress was held in Nuremberg, September 10–16, 1935. It was called the "Rally of Freedom" (''Reichsparteitag der Freiheit''). "Freedom" referred to the reintroduction of compulsory military service and thus the German "liberation" from the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. Leni Riefenstahl made the film ''[[Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht]]'' (''Day of Freedom: Our Armed Forces'') at this rally, and the Nazis introduced the [[Nuremberg Laws]].
*1936 &amp;ndash; The 8th Party Congress was known as the "Rally of Honour" (''Reichsparteitag der Ehre'', September 8–14). The [[remilitarization of the Rhineland|remilitarization]] of the demilitarized [[Rhineland]] in March 1936 constituted the restoration of German honour in the eyes of many Germans. The film ''[[Festliches Nürnberg]]'' incorporated footage shot at this rally, as well as the rally of 1937.
*1937 &amp;ndash; The 9th Party Congress was called the "Rally of Labour" (''Reichsparteitag der Arbeit'', September 6–13). It celebrated the reduction of unemployment in Germany since the Nazi rise to power.
*1938 &amp;ndash; The 10th Party Congress was named the "Rally of Greater Germany" (''Reichsparteitag Großdeutschland'', September 5–12).&lt;ref&gt;archive.org: [https://archive.org/stream/TheCompleteHitler-SpeechesAndProclamations-MaxDomarus/TheCompleteHitler-1932-1945-Vol1-4_djvu.txt page 1139ff.]&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the [[Anschluss|annexation]] of [[Austria]] to Germany that had taken place earlier in the year.
*1939 &amp;ndash; The 11th Party Congress, scheduled for September 2–11, was given the name "Rally of Peace" (''Reichsparteitag des Friedens''). It was meant to reiterate the German desire for peace, both to the German population and to other countries. It was cancelled at short notice, as one day before the planned date, on September 1, Germany began its [[German invasion of Poland|offensive against Poland]] (which ignited [[World War II]]).

== Propaganda films ==
Official films for the rallies began in 1927, with the establishment of the [[NSDAP]] (Nazi Party) film office. The most famous films were made by [[Leni Riefenstahl]] for the rallies between 1933 and 1935. Relating to the theme of the rally, she called her first movie ''Victory of Faith'' (''[[Der Sieg des Glaubens]]''). This movie was taken out of circulation after the [[Night of the Long Knives]], although a copy survived in Britain and has recently been made available on the [[Internet Archive]] for public viewing. The rally of 1934 became the setting for the award-winning ''[[Triumph of the Will]]'' (''Triumph des Willens''). Several generals in the ''[[Wehrmacht]]'' protested over the minimal army presence in the film: Hitler apparently proposed modifying the film to placate the generals, but Riefenstahl refused his suggestion. She did agree to return to the 1935 rally and make a film exclusively about the Wehrmacht, which became ''[[Tag der Freiheit: Unsere Wehrmacht]]''.

The rallies for 1936 and 1937 were covered in ''[[Festliches Nürnberg]]'', which was shorter than the others, only 21 minutes.

== Books ==
There were two sets of official or semi-official books covering the rallies. The "red books" were officially published by the NSDAP and contained the proceedings of the "congress" as well as full texts of every speech given in chronological order.

The "blue books" were published initially by [[Julius Streicher]], the ''[[Gauleiter]]'' of [[Nuremberg]], later by [[Hanns Kerrl]], not by the party press. These were larger scale books that included the text of speeches and proceedings, as well as larger photographs.

In addition to these, collections of Heinrich Hoffman's photographs were published to commemorate each Party congress, as well as pamphlets of Hitler's speeches. Both series of books are much sought after by collectors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.worldfuturefund.org/wffmaster/Reading/Party%20Day/Nurembergdoc.htm |title=The Nuremberg "Parteitag" Rallies  |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=worldfuturefund.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1972-025-12, Zerstörte Lagerbaracke nach dem 20. Juli 1944.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|The [[Wolf's Lair|Wolfsschanze]] after the bomb]]

'''Operation Valkyrie''' ({{lang-de|Unternehmen Walküre}}) was a German [[World War II]] emergency [[continuity of government]] operations plan issued to the [[Replacement Army|Territorial Reserve Army of Germany]] to execute and implement in case of a general breakdown in civil order of the nation. Failure of the government to maintain control of civil affairs might have been caused by the Allied [[Strategic bombing during World War II|bombing]] of German cities, or uprising of the millions of [[Forced labor in Germany during World War II|foreign forced laborers]] working in German factories.

German Army (''[[German Army (Wehrmacht)|Heer]]'') officers General [[Friedrich Olbricht]], Major General [[Henning von Tresckow]], and Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]] modified the plan with the intention of using it to take control of German cities, disarm the [[SS]], and arrest the Nazi leadership once Hitler had been assassinated in the [[20 July plot]]. Hitler's death (as opposed to his arrest) was required to free German soldiers from their oath of loyalty to him (''[[Reichswehreid]]''). After lengthy preparation, the plot was activated in 1944, but failed.
[[File:Claus von Stauffenberg portrait (1907-1944).JPG|thumb|Claus von Stauffenberg, chief conspirator in Operation Valkyrie.]]

==Planning==
The original plan, designed to deal with internal disturbances in emergency situations, was designed by General [[Friedrich Olbricht]]'s staff in his capacity as head of General Army Office and was approved by Hitler.&lt;ref name="Ref-1"&gt;Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933–1945'', 1996, p219&lt;/ref&gt; 

=== Coup-oriented revisions ===
The idea of using the Reserve Army in the German homeland for a potential coup existed before, but apart from Hitler himself, only Colonel-General [[Friedrich Fromm]], Chief of the [[Replacement Army | Reserve Army]] since 1938, could initiate Operation Valkyrie. Fromm's refusal to cooperate in a prospective coup posed a serious obstacle to the conspirators. Nevertheless, after the lessons of a failed [[Operation Spark (1940)|assassination attempt on 13 March 1943]], Olbricht felt that the original coup plan was inadequate and that the Reserve Army should be used in the coup even without Fromm's cooperation.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1976-130-53, Henning v. Tresckow.jpg|thumb|left|[[Henning von Tresckow]] in 1944]]
The original Valkyrie order only dealt with strategy to ensure combat readiness of units among scattered elements of the Reserve Army. Olbricht added a second part, 'Valkyrie II', which provided for the swift mustering of units into battle groups ready for action.
In August and September 1943, General [[Henning von Tresckow]] found Olbricht's revision inadequate, and thus greatly expanded the Valkyrie plan and drafted new supplementary orders. A secret declaration began with the words: "The Führer Adolf Hitler is dead! A treacherous group of party leaders has attempted to exploit the situation by attacking our embattled soldiers from the rear to seize power for themselves." Detailed instructions were written for occupation of government ministries in Berlin, of Himmler's headquarters in [[East Prussia]], of radio stations, of telephone exchanges, of other Nazi infrastructure through [[Military district (Germany)|military districts]], and of [[Nazi concentration camps|concentration camps]].&lt;ref name="Ref-1"/&gt; (Previously, it was believed that Colonel [[Claus Schenk von Stauffenberg]] was mainly responsible for the Valkyrie plan, but documents recovered by the [[Soviet Union]] after the war and released in 2007 suggest that a detailed plan was developed by Tresckow in autumn 1943.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.atypon-link.com/OLD/doi/pdf/10.1524/VfZg.2007.55.2.331 Peter Hoffmann, "Oberst i. G. Henning von Tresckow und die Staatsstreichpläne im Jahr 1943]{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; All documents were handled by Tresckow's wife, Erika, and by Margarete von Oven, his secretary. Both women wore gloves to leave no fingerprints.&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Fest, ''Plotting Hitler's Death: The German Resistance to Hitler, 1933–1945'', 1996, p220&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, the coup plan involved tricking the Reserve Army into the seizure and removal of the civilian government of wartime Germany under the false pretense that the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] had attempted a coup d'état and assassinated Hitler. The conspirators depended on the assumption that the rank-and-file soldiers and junior officers designated to execute Operation Valkyrie would be motivated to do so based upon their false belief that the Nazi civilian leadership had behaved with disloyalty and treason against the state, and were therefore required to be removed. The conspirators counted on the soldiers to obey their orders as long as they came from the legitimate channel — namely, the Reserve Army High Command - in the emergency situation following Hitler's putative death.

Apart from Hitler, only General Friedrich Fromm, as commander of the Reserve Army, could activate Operation Valkyrie. For the planned coup to succeed, therefore, the plotters had either to win Fromm over to the conspiracy, or to neutralize him in some way. Fromm, like many senior officers, largely knew about the military conspiracies against Hitler, but neither supported them nor reported them to the [[Gestapo]].

==Implementation==
{{Main|20 July plot}}
The key role in its actual implementation was played by Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg|Claus Schenk Graf von Stauffenberg]], after his assassination attempt on [[Adolf Hitler|Hitler]] on 20 July 1944. Stauffenberg also further improved the Valkyrie plan and made changes to address changing situations.
Stauffenberg's position as [[Chief of staff|Chief of Staff]] of the Reserve Army gave him access to Hitler for reports and at the same time required his presence at headquarters for implementation of Valkyrie. At first, Tresckow and Stauffenberg sought out other officers with access to Hitler who could carry out the assassination. General [[Helmuth Stieff]], Chief of Organization in [[Oberkommando des Heeres|Army High Command]], volunteered to be the assassin but later backed down. Tresckow attempted several times to be assigned to Hitler's headquarters without success. Finally, Stauffenberg decided to carry out both the assassination attempt and the Valkyrie operation, which greatly reduced the chance of success. After two abortive attempts, Stauffenberg placed the bomb on 20 July and hurried back to Berlin to assume his pivotal role.

Discovering that the bomb had not killed Hitler, Fromm ordered the executions of General [[Friedrich Olbricht]], his chief of staff Colonel [[Albrecht Mertz von Quirnheim]], Colonel [[Claus von Stauffenberg]], and his adjutant Lieutenant [[Werner von Haeften]]. Shortly after midnight, the condemned men were led to a mound of earth back-lit by idling vehicles where each was executed by firing squad in the courtyard of [[Bendlerstrasse]] headquarters.&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Butler, The Gestapo: A History of Hitler's Secret Police 1933-45. London: Amber Books Ltd. 2004. pg. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Initial order to the Wehrkreise==
{{quote|I. The Führer [[Adolf Hitler]] is dead!

:An unscrupulous clique of party leaders alien to the front has attempted, under the exploitation of this situation, to betray the hard-struggling front and to seize power for their own selfish purposes.

II. In this hour of greatest danger, the government of the [[Reich]] has declared a state of military emergency for the maintenance of law and order and at the same time has transferred the executive power, with the supreme command of the [[Wehrmacht]], to me.

III. With this, I order:

:1. I transfer the executive power – with the right of delegation, to the territorial commanders – on the home front, to the commander of the army reserves under the simultaneous appointment to the supreme commander in the homeland war – in the occupied western area, to the supreme commander west – in Italy, to the supreme commander southwest – in the occupied eastern area, to the supreme commander of the army groups and the commander of the [[Wehrmacht]] eastern land for their respective area of command – in [[Denmark]] and [[Norway]], to the Wehrmacht commander.
:2. The holders of executive power have control over:
::a) all sections and units of the Wehrmacht, including the [[Waffen]]-SS, [[Reichsarbeitsdienst|RAD]] and the [[Organisation Todt|OT]], within their area of command;
::b) all public authorities (of the [[Reich]], [[Germany]], the states and the municipalities), especially the entire law enforcement police, security police and administrative police;
::c) all office bearers and subdivisions of [[Nazi Party|the NSDAP]] and those of its affiliated associations;
::d) the transportation services and public utilities
:3. The entire Waffen-SS is integrated into the army with immediate effect.
:4. The holders of executive power are responsible for the maintenance of public order and  security. They especially have to ensure:
:: a) the protection of communications
:: b) the elimination of the [[Sicherheitsdienst|SD]] (Security Service).
Any opposition to the military power of enforcement is to be  ruthlessly crushed.&lt;br/&gt;
In this hour of highest danger for [[Nazi Germany|the Fatherland]], unity of the [[Wehrmacht]] and the maintenance of full discipline are the uppermost requirements.&lt;br/&gt;
That is why I make it the duty of all commanders of [[German Army (Wehrmacht)|the army]], [[Kriegsmarine|the navy]], and [[Luftwaffe|the air force]] to support the holders of executive power in carrying out their difficult task with all means at their disposal and to guarantee the compliance of their directives by the subordinate sections. The German soldier stands before a historical task. It will depend on his energy and attitude whether Germany will be saved.}}

==In film and television==
The failed plot has been represented in historical dramatic films. [[Georg Wilhelm Pabst]]'s ''[[Jackboot Mutiny]]'' (Austria, 1955), [[Anatole Litvak]]'s ''[[The Night of the Generals]]'' (Britain, 1967), [[Ian Sharp]]'s ''Twist of Fate'' TV miniseries (1989), [[Lawrence Schiller]]'s ''[[The Plot to Kill Hitler]]'' (U.S., 1990), the German television production ''[[Stauffenberg (film)|Stauffenberg]]'' and [[Bryan Singer]]'s full-length movie ''[[Valkyrie (film)|Valkyrie]]'' (U.S., 2008) have addressed the plot. In the [[Soviet Union]], it was depicted in the third part of the film series ''[[Liberation (film series)|Liberation]]''. It is also worth noting that the plot to assassinate Hitler along with Von Stauffenberg was also referenced in the Season 3 episode of the British Sitcom [[Red Dwarf]] "Timeslides", and the [[Hogan's Heroes]] episode "Operation Briefcase".

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2408">{{redirect|Trial jury|the form of trial involving a petit jury|Jury trial}}
In [[common law]], a '''petit jury''' (or '''trial jury''') hears the [[evidence]] in a [[trial]] as presented by both the [[plaintiff]] (petitioner) and the [[defendant]] (respondent). After hearing the evidence and often [[jury instructions]] from the [[judge]], the group retires for [[deliberation]], to consider a verdict. The majority required for a verdict varies. In some cases it must be unanimous, while in other jurisdictions it may be a majority or [[supermajority]]. A jury that is unable to come to a verdict is referred to as a [[hung jury]]. The size of the jury varies; in [[Criminal law|criminal cases]] involving serious felonies there are usually 12 jurors, although Scotland uses 15. A number of countries that are not in the English common law tradition have quasi-juries on which lay judges or jurors and professional judges deliberate together regarding criminal cases. However, the common law trial jury is the most common type of jury system.&lt;ref name="flsd_Unit"&gt;{{Cite web| title = United States District Court: Petit Jury| work = flsd.uscourts.gov| accessdate = 2016-04-19| url = https://www.flsd.uscourts.gov/?page_id=1136}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usco_Type"&gt;{{Cite web| title = Types of Juries| work = United States Courts| accessdate = 2016-04-19| url = http://www.uscourts.gov/services-forms/jury-service/types-juries}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Civil law (common law)|civil cases]] many trials require fewer than twelve jurors.  Juries are almost never used in civil cases outside the United States and Canada.  Other states with a common law tradition sometimes use them in defamation cases, in cases involving a governmental eminent domain power, and in cases involving alleged wrongful conviction.  Civil law countries generally do not use civil juries.  Civil juries are available in the United States and Canada in almost all cases where the only remedy sought is money damages.&lt;ref name="judi_NewJ"&gt;{{Cite web| title = New Jersey Courts| work = judiciary.state.nj.us| accessdate = 2016-04-19| url = http://www.judiciary.state.nj.us/hudson/jury/jurypetit.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11850">'''Politics of memory''' is the organisation of [[collective memory]] by [[politics|political agents]]; the political means by which events are remembered and recorded, or discarded. Eventually, politics of memory may determine the way history is written and passed on. Memories are also influenced by [[culture|cultural]] forces, e.g. [[popular culture]], as well as [[social norms]]. It has also been connected with the construction of [[Identity (social science)|identity]].&lt;ref&gt;The Politics of Memory by Laura Nasrallah. ''Harvard Divinity Bulletin'' Autumn 2005 (Vol. 33, No. 2).{{cite web |url=http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news-events/harvard-divinity-bulletin/articles/the-politics-of-memory |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120922191952/http://www.hds.harvard.edu/news-events/harvard-divinity-bulletin/articles/the-politics-of-memory |archivedate=2012-09-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cyprus==
The two sides in the [[Cyprus dispute|conflict in Cyprus]] maintain widely divergent and contrasting [[memory|memories]] of the events that split the island. The term [[selective memory]] is applied by psychologists to people suffering from head injuries who retain some memories, but have [[amnesia]] about others. Societal trauma, such as war, seems to have a similar effect. Recollections that are shaped out of a phenomenon common to many countries traumatized by war and repression, may be remembered in radically different ways by people who experienced similar events.

The selectivity may also serve a political purpose, for example to justify the claims of one group over a competing group. Cyprus is a poignant case for this phenomenon. The longstanding conflict on the island reflects deep roots in the "[[motherland]]s" of the [[Greek Cypriot]] and [[Turkish Cypriot]] peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/papadakis.diss.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080724222818/http://www.cyprus-conflict.net/papadakis.diss.htm |archivedate=2008-07-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Croatia==
Lauren A. Rivera (Harvard University) studies how states "manage reputation-damaging" events "on a global stage". Rivera decided to conduct a study on the state of Croatia in order to determine how the government represented its country to international audiences following the wars of Yugoslavian secession. She hypothesized that the main catalyst for this change in international opinion was due to cultural reframing. This empirical study included textual analyses of travel brochures printed by the Croatian government (study 1), interviews with 34 tourism professionals from the Croatian government (study 2), and observations of popular attractions during the peak of Croatia's tourism season (study 3). Study 1 and study 3 came to the conclusion that the nation's new cultural identity draws parallels with western societies while creating "strong symbolic boundaries between Croatia and its Eastern neighbors" (Rivera). Tourism professionals explain this shift in culture as an attempt to make the country of Croatia seem like a more stable place for Western investment and travel (study 2).&lt;ref&gt;[Rivera, L.A. (2008). Managing "Spoiled" National Identity: War, Tourism, and Memory in Croatia. American Sociological Review 73(4), 613-634]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
In Germany, Politics of memory (''Geschichtspolitik'') is most often associated with how to memorise the [[Nazi Germany|national socialist era]] and [[World War II]]. Often different events of this era have been measured against one another and, in this way, evaluated, e.g. the [[Holocaust]], the war against [[Eastern Europe]] with its [[ethnic cleansing]] programs, but also the [[Air warfare of World War II|bombings of city's by German and Allied forces alike]] or the [[Flight and expulsion of Germans (1944–50)|expulsion of Germans from Eastern Europe]]. 

Speeches by politicians often deal with issues of how to memorise the past. [[Richard von Weizsäcker]] as [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]] identified two modes of memorising the unconditional [[surrender of Nazi Germany]] in 1945 in his famous 1985 speech: this date can be seen as defeat or liberation. Weizsäcker backed the [[Richard von Weizsäcker#Political career|latter Interpretation]]. In this regard, such moments as the first official "Day of Commemoration for Victims of National Socialism", on January 20, 1996, led to [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]] [[Roman Herzog]] remarking in his address to the German Parliament that "Remembrance gives us strength, since it helps to keep us from going astray."&lt;ref name="highbeam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-20088049.html|title=Divided Memory: The Nazi Past in the Two Germanys. - The Nation &amp;#124; HighBeam Research|publisher=highbeam.com|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In similar, but somewhat opposing measure, [[Gerhard Schröder]] sought to move beyond this in saying the generation that committed such deeds has passed, and a new generation does not have the same fault because they simply weren't there to be responsible.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}} 

Good examples for politics of memory could be seen in national monuments and the discourses surrounding their construction. The construction of a [[holocaust memorial]] in memory of the murdered Jews of Europe at a central location in Berlin was met with protests but also with strong support. Likewise the [[Neue Wache|National Memorial to the Victims of War and Tyranny]] was deemed inappropriate by some onlookers and a discussion revolved around the question whether the lack of a differentiation between victims and perpetrators is adequate or not.&lt;ref name="utexas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utexas.edu/courses/arens/301history/memorial.html|title=Berlin Memorial Bibliography|publisher=utexas.edu|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The question if and how to memorise Germans expelled from Poland in the aftermath of World War II has been constantly debated in both West Germany and Poland. Such questions are so difficult because it requires a moral judgement of these events. These judgements differ remarkably. For instance, the [[Federation of Expellees|Federation of German Expellees]] called on [[Poland]] to pay compensation for lost property to Germans from what after 1945 became Polish territory, a claim that is consistently declined by Poland.&lt;ref name="eurozine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurozine.com/articles/2006-08-21-ther-en.html|title=Eurozine - The burden of history and the trap of memory - Philipp Ther|publisher=eurozine.com|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Similarly there have been debates in Germany whether the legacy of World War II implies that Germany's military should be confined to purely defensive measure like peacekeeping or, contrary to this, this legacy can be a justification of an active enforcement of human rights which also might involve [[Preemptive war|preemptive]] strikes.&lt;ref name="google"&gt;{{cite book|title=Present Pasts: Urban Palimpsests and the Politics of Memory|author=Huyssen, A.|date=2003|publisher=Stanford University Press|isbn=9780804745611|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E8jtTGB8VtUC|page=73|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soviet bloc: politics of history==
Although this has not received considerably coverage, there have been studies to saying that the Soviet Bloc's repressions and the consequent "traumatic repercussions" deserve the same mention as that of post-World War II, which has been insititutionalized.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruc.dk/upload/application/pdf/f51d6748/Malksoo.pdf{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
{{Expand section|date=April 2012}}
Memorials keep alive the memories of conflict, as with the removals of memorials, often for political purposes, such as in Lithuania's removal of Soviet era statue from the city centre of the capital to a cemetery that evoked an adverse reaction from Russia.{{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

Similarly, the commemorations of wars are held in places like Bosnia, which hosted a concert on the 20th anniversary of the [[Bosnian war]].&lt;ref name="aljazeera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2012/04/2012458577395275.html|title=Sarajevo hosts a concert 20 years after siege - Al Jazeera English|author=Edin Krehic, Selma Milovanovic|publisher=aljazeera.com|accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Efficacy and moral relativity==
While the German example's [[moral relativism]] has led to a lesser political [[fascism]], others have questioned whether politics of memory is a good thing. Is it that "[[George Santayana|Those who cannot remember the past, are doomed to repeat it]]?" A large body of Literature has been written with the view that it is so.

Looking at truth commissions and at efforts by ravaged societies to "come to terms" with the past has caused various writers, [[human rights]] activists, lawyers, political theorists, psychoanalysts, journalists, historians, and philosophers to argue that "forgetfulness equals impunity, [while] impunity is both morally outrageous and politically dangerous." It was also argued that forgetfulness is bad, however, it is still different from proving that memory is good. It was said that memory, like everything else, could be clumsily or unintelligently used, or even used for false purposes or in bad faith.&lt;ref&gt;http://bostonreview.net/BR28.3/linfield.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. G. Sebald]] sees the opposite end of the conventional determination in showing that German amnesia surrounding the Allied [[carpet bombing]]s of 131 German cities and towns turned many German cities into vast [[necropolis]]es, and resulted in an estimated 600,000 primarily civilian deaths, with millions of internal refugees. It was also said,{{by whom|date=February 2012}} however, that the politics of memory could contribute to the formation of strategies for achieving reconciliation in post-conflict situations. It can be used by activists, equity workers, policy analysts and academics to address existing paradigms in order to achieve some semblance of justice and reconciliation in the aftermath of deep internal conflict.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==In literature==

[[Milan Kundera]]'s opening story in the ''[[The Book of Laughter and Forgetting|Book of Laughter and Forgetting]]'' is about a [[Vladimír Clementis|Czech official]] posing with other officials for a photograph in winter. The man gives his [[fur]] hat to cover his superior's [[bald]] head and the photo is taken. Later, when he falls out of favour and is denounced and removed from official records and documents, he is even air-brushed out of photographs; all that remains of him is his fur hat.&lt;ref&gt;Milan Kundera: A man who cannot forget By MICHIKO KAKUTANI Published: January 18, 1982 https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9F0CE5D91138F93BA25752C0A964948260&amp;scp=2&amp;sq=book%20of%20laughter%20and%20forgetting%20politics%20of%20history&amp;st=cse&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Iraq}}
The '''Popular Unity Party''' is a [[political party]] in [[Iraq]] led by Youssif Hamdan. Initially set-up as '''Communist Party of Iraq (CPI)''' in 1995. The CPI split away from the [[Iraqi Communist Party]] during the latter period of [[Saddam Hussein]]'s [[Ba'athist Iraq|regime]]. Many saw the CPI as a puppet party of the regime, whose existence would give the outside world an impression that the country was a multi-party state. The party met with foreign delegations visiting [[Iraq]]. It seemed the intentions of the party would've been to join the government as a junior partner within the [[National Progressive Front (Iraq)|National Progressive Front]], similar to the [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|coalition of the same name]] set-up in neighbouring [[Syria]], but the idea was later discarded. The CPI was never given possibility to register as a legal party, though its leader was in the Iraqi parliament as of 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''Jewish Political Studies Review'' Vol. 13. 2001. p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[2003 invasion of Iraq|fall of the Saddam's regime in 2003]], the party was reconstructed as the Popular Unity Party.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19576">'''Positive deviance''' (PD) is an approach to behavioral and social change based on the observation that in any community there are people whose uncommon but successful behaviors or strategies enable them to find better solutions to a problem than their peers, despite facing similar challenges and having no extra resources or knowledge than their peers. These individuals are referred to as positive deviants.&lt;ref name="Tuhus-Dubrow, R 2009"&gt;Tuhus-Dubrow, R. The Power of Positive Deviants: A promising new tactic for changing communities from the inside. Boston Globe. November 29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sternin, J., &amp; Choo, R. (2000).

Protecting Children from Exploitation and Trafficking Using the Positive Deviance Approach in Uganda and Indonesia.  Save the Children Federation, Inc., 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept first appeared in nutrition research in the 1970s.  Researchers observed that despite the poverty in a community, some poor families had well nourished children. Some suggested using information gathered from these outliers to plan nutrition programs.&lt;ref&gt;Wishik SM, Van der Vynckt S. The use of nutritional "positive deviants" to identify approaches for modification of dietary practices.

Positive Deviance in Child Nutrition: with Emphasis on Psychosocial and Behavioral Aspects and Implications for Development. The United Nations University, 1990. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles==
Positive deviance is a strength-based approach which is applied to problems requiring behavior and social change. It is based on the following principles:&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"&gt;Pascale, Sternin, &amp; Sternin. (2010) The Power of Positive Deviance: How Unlikely Innovators Solve the World's Toughest Problems. Harvard Business Press. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Communities already have the solutions. They are the best experts to solve their problems.
* Communities self-organize and have the human resources and social assets to solve an agreed-upon problem.
* Collective intelligence. Intelligence and know-how is not concentrated in the leadership of a community alone or in external experts but is distributed throughout the community. Thus the PD process's aim is to draw out the collective intelligence to apply it to a specific problem requiring behavior or social change.
* Sustainability as the cornerstone of the approach. The PD approach enables the community or organization to seek and discover sustainable solutions to a given problem because the demonstrably successful uncommon behaviors are already practiced in that community within the constraints and challenges of the current situation.
* It is easier to change behavior by practicing it rather than knowing about it. "It is easier to act your way into a new way of thinking than think your way into a new way of acting".

==Original application==
The PD approach was first operationalized and applied in programming in the field by Jerry and Monique Sternin through their work with [[Save the Children]] in [[Vietnam]] in the 1990s (Tuhus-Dubrow, Sternin, Sternin &amp; Pascale).&lt;ref name="Tuhus-Dubrow, R 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Khatoon, Ajeeba, Ambreen, Amama, Shaifique, Mohammad, Sternin, Monique. The Positive Deviance Approach to Improve Household Practice for Better Newborn and Maternal Health Outcomes in Haripur, Pakistan. Operations Manual Saving Newborn Lives. July 12, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the pilot 64% of children weighed in the pilot villages were malnourished. Through a PD inquiry, the villagers found poor peers in the community that through their uncommon but successful strategies, had well-nourished children. These families collected foods typically considered inappropriate for children (sweet potato greens, shrimp, and crabs), washed their children's hands before meals, and actively fed them three to four times a day instead of the typical two meals a day provided to children.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Marsh DR, Pachon H, Schroeder DG, et al. Design of a prospective, randomized evaluation of an integrated nutrition program in rural Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):34-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Mackintosh UAT, Marsh DR, Schroeder DG. Sustained positive deviant child care practices and their effects on child growth in Viet Nam. Food Nutr Bull. 2002;23(4):16-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without knowing it, PDs had incorporated foods already found in their community that provided important nutrients: [[protein]], [[iron]], and [[calcium]]. A nutrition program based on these insights was created. Instead of simply telling participants what to do differently, they designed the program to help them act their way into a new way of thinking. To attend a feeding session, parents were required to bring one of the newly identified foods. They brought their children and while sharing nutritious meals, learned to cook the new foods.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

At the end of the two year pilot, malnutrition fell by 85%.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Results were sustained, and transferred to the younger siblings of participants.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

This approach to programming was different in important ways. Based on a community's own assets, the positive deviance approach operates within the specific cultural context of a given community (village, business, schools, ministry, department, hospital) and is therefore always appropriate. It provides to community members the "social proof" that an uncommon behavior can be adopted by all because it is already practiced by a few within the community. The solutions come from the community, therefore avoid the "immune response" that can occur when outside experts enter a community with best practices that are often unsuccessful in promoting sustained change. (Sternin)

Since it was first applied in [[Vietnam]], PD has been used to inform nutrition programs in over 40 countries by [[USAID]], [[World Vision]], [[Mercy Corps]], [[Save the Children]], [[CARE (relief agency)|CARE]], [[Plan International]], Indonesian Ministry of Health, [[Peace Corps]], [[Food for the Hungry]], among others.

==Steps==
A positive deviance approach may follow a series of steps.&lt;ref name="Pascale, Sternin 2010"/&gt;

===An invitation to change===
A PD inquiry begins with an invitation from a community that wishes to address an important problem they face. This is an important first step of community ownership of a process that they will lead.

===Defining the problem===
This process occurs with the community at the center of defining the problem for themselves. This will often lead to a problem definition that differs from the outside "expert" opinion of the situation. 
A quantitative baseline is established by the community. This baseline provides an opportunity for the community to reflect on the problem given the evidence at hand, and also measure the progress toward their goals.
This is also the beginning of the process to identify stakeholder and decision-makers regarding the issue at hand. Additional stakeholders and decision-makers will be pulled in throughout the process as they are identified.

===Determining the presence of PD individuals or groups===
Through the use of data and observation, the community establishes that there are Positive Deviants in their midst.

===Discovering uncommon practices or behaviors===
This is the Positive Deviance Inquiry. The community, having identified positive deviants, sets out to find the behaviors, attitudes, or beliefs that allow the PD to be successful. The focus is on the successful strategies of the PD, not on making a hero of the person using the strategy. This self-discovery of people/groups just like them who have found successful solutions provide "social proof" that this problem can be overcome now, without outside resources.

===Program design===
Now that the community has identified successful strategies, they decide what strategies they would like to adopt, and design activities to help others access and practice these uncommon and other beneficial. Program design is not focused on spreading "best practices" but helping community members "act their way into a new way of thinking" through hands-on activities.

===Monitoring and evaluation===
PD-informed projects are monitored their programs and evaluated through a participatory process. As the monitoring will be decided on and performed by the community, the tools they create will be appropriate to the setting. This can allow even illiterate community members to participate through pictorial monitoring forms or other appropriate tools.
Evaluation allows the community to see the progress they are making towards their goals and reinforces the changes they are making in behaviors, attitudes, and beliefs.

===Scaling up===
The scaling up of a PD project may happen through many mechanisms: the "ripple effect" of other communities observing the success and engaging in a PD project of their own, through the coordination of NGOs, or organizational development consultants. However the project is scaled up, the process of community discovery of PDs in their midst remains vital to the acceptance of new behaviors, attitudes, and knowledge.

==Applications==

=== Preventing hospital-acquired infections ===
The PD approach has been applied in hospitals in the United States, Brazil, Canada, Mexico, Colombia, and England to stop the spread of hospital acquired infections such as [[c-diff]] and [[Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus|Methicillin-resistant ''Staphylococcus aureus'']] (MRSA). The [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC)  evaluated pilot programs in the U.S. and found units using the approach decreased their infections by 30-73%.&lt;ref&gt;Awad S., Palacio C., Subramanian A., et al. Implementation of a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) prevention bundle results in decreased MRSA surgical site infections. The American Journal of Surgery. 2009; 198: 607-610.&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, it has been used in health care setting increase the incidence of hand washing, and improving care for patients immediately after a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;Bradly E, Curry L, Ramanadhan R, et al.  Research in action: using positive deviance to improve quality of health care. Implementation Science. May 2009: 4:25.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Primary care (Bright Spotting) ===
Termed "Bright Spotting",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://thedo.osteopathic.org/2015/04/public-health-project-taps-into-superstar-patients-expertise/|title = Public health project taps into superstar patients' expertise - The DO|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of positive deviance, the primary care pilot initiative first took place in rural [[New Hampshire]] and is still ongoing.  The outpatient clinic identified a complex patient population, from the clinics perspective, studied the risk factors of that population, then identified measures that would signify that a patient has become healthy and sustained health.  Once these measures were identified, using both data and the practices knowledge of patient's, "Bright Spots" were identified as those that meet both criteria of high risk and achieved health&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Finding patient experts: How to conduct positive deviance research|url = http://thedo.osteopathic.org/2015/04/finding-patient-experts-how-to-conduct-positive-deviance-research/|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finding positive deviant patients through predictive analytics has also be suggested as a possible tool in discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Big Data With a Personal Touch: The Convergence of Predictive Analytics and Positive Deviance|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/cole-zanetti-do/big-data-with-a-personal-_b_5206219.html|website = The Huffington Post|accessdate = 2015-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Once these patients were identified the care team performed qualitative research to discover their patterns of behavior.  The results were then shown to the bright spots and their families who then designed a peer learning experience with the results in mind.  The community meetings were then facilitated using both positive deviance facilitation techniques as well as applying the [http://www.cehd.umn.edu/fsos/projects/cpc/pdf/citizenhealth2006.pdf "Citizen Health Care Model"] which is very similar to positive deviance approaches.

=== Public health ===
A PD project helped prisoners in a [[New South Wales]] prison stop smoking. Projects in [[Burkino Faso]], [[Guatemala]], [[Ivory Coast]], and [[Rwanda]] addressed reproductive health in adolescents.&lt;ref&gt;Babalola, S, Awasu, D, Quenum-Renaud, B.

PD projects to prevent the spread of [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] took place in 2002 with motorbike taxi drivers in [[Vietnam]]&lt;ref&gt;Huogn, N, Sternin, S. Use of PD in HIV/AIDS Project in Sapa town, Viet Nam&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2004 with sex workers in Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;Sternin, J.

Bouman, S. Lubjuhn, &amp; A. Singhal (2014): What explains enhanced psychological resilience of students at VMBO schools in the Netherlands? The Positive Deviance Approach in Action. Center for Media &amp; Health, Gouda, the Netherlands.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Child protection ===
A five-year PD project starting in 2003 to prevent girl trafficking in [[Indonesia]] with [[Save the Children]] and a local Indonesian NGO, helped them find viable economic options to stay in their communities.&lt;ref name="Singhal, Arvind 2010"/&gt;

A PD project to stop [[Female Genital Mutilation]]/Cutting in [[Egypt]] began in 1998 with CEDPA (Center for Development and Population Activities), COST (Coptic Organization for Services and Training), [[Caritas (charity)|Caritas]] in Minya, Community Development Agency (CDA), Monshaat Nasser in Beni Suef governorate, and the Center for Women's Legal Assistance (CEWLA). Efforts have already shown a reduction in the practice.&lt;ref&gt;Masterson J, Swanson J. Female Genital Cutting: Breaking the Silence, Enabling Change. International Center for Research on Women (ICWR) and the Center for Development and Population Activities (CEDPA). Washington, DC. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Uganda]], a project with the Oak Foundation and [[Save the Children]] helped girls who were child soldiers with the [[Lords Resistance Army]] in [[Sudan]] reintegrate into their communities.&lt;ref name="Singhal, Arvind 2010"/&gt;

=== In education ===
PD projects in [[New Jersey]], [[California]], [[Argentina]], [[Ethiopia]], and [[Burkina Faso]] have addressed drop out rates and keeping girls in school.

=== Private sector ===
Proponents of PD within management science argue that in any population, even in such seemingly mundane groups as service personnel in a [[fast food]] environment, the positive deviants have attitudes, cognitive processes and behavioral patterns that lead to significantly improved performance in key metrics such as speed-of-service and profitability. Studies claim that widespread adoption of the positive deviant approaches consistently leads to significant performance improvement.

PD had been significantly extended to the private sector, by William Seidman and Michael McCauley. Their extensions include methodologies and technologies for:
* Quickly identifying the positive deviants&lt;ref&gt;Harvesting the Experts '"Secret Sauce" To Close the Performance Gap., Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael. Performance Improvement Journal, Jan 2003 v42 n1 p32-39.&lt;/ref&gt;

* Sustaining the change by others by integrating it into their pre-existing emotional and cognitive functions&lt;ref&gt;The Performance Improvement Multiplier, Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael. Performance Improvement. October 2003, v42, n9, pp.33-37.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Scaling the positive deviant knowledge to large numbers of people simultaneously&lt;ref&gt;Performance Improvement in a Far-flung Enterprise. Seidman, William &amp; McCauley, Michael, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Positive deviance was further extended to groups or organizations by [[Gary Hamel]].&lt;ref&gt;The Future of Management, Hamel, Gary. Harvard Business School Press, Boston, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Hamel looks to Positive Deviant companies to set the example for "management innovation."

The '''propaganda model''' is a [[conceptual model]] in [[political economy]] advanced by [[Edward S. Herman]] and [[Noam Chomsky]] to explain how [[propaganda]] and [[systemic bias]]es function in [[corporate]] [[mass media]]. The model seeks to explain how populations are manipulated and how consent for economic, social, and political policies is "manufactured" in the public mind due to this propaganda. The theory posits that the way in which [[corporate]] media is structured (e.g. through [[advertising]], [[concentration of media ownership]], government sourcing) creates an inherent [[conflict of interest]] that acts as propaganda for undemocratic forces.

First presented in their 1988 book ''[[Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy of the Mass Media]]'', the propaganda model views private media as businesses interested in the sale of a product—readers and audiences—to other businesses (advertisers) rather than that of quality news to the public. Describing the media's "societal purpose", Chomsky writes, "... the study of institutions and how they function must be scrupulously ignored, apart from fringe elements or a relatively obscure scholarly literature".&lt;ref name="Chomsky 1989"&gt;{{cite book|title=Necessary Illusions: Thought Control In Democratic Societies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t5yVao-mv8sC&amp;printsec=frontcover|publisher=[[Pantheon Books|Pantheon]]|year=1989|first=Noam|last=Chomsky|isbn=978-0-89608-366-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory postulates five general classes of "filters" that determine the type of news that is presented in news media. These five classes are: [[Concentration of media ownership|Ownership]] of the medium, Medium's [[funding]] sources, [[news source|Sourcing]], [[wikt:flak|Flak]], and [[Anti-communism]] or "fear ideology".

The first three are generally regarded by the authors as being the most important. In versions published after the [[9/11 attacks]] on the United States in 2001, Chomsky and Herman updated the fifth prong to instead refer to the "[[War on Terror]]" and "[[counter-terrorism]]", although they state that it operates in much the same manner.

Although the model was based mainly on the characterization of [[Media of the United States|United States media]], Chomsky and Herman believe the theory is equally applicable to any country that shares the basic economic structure and organizing principles that the model postulates as the cause of [[media bias]]es.&lt;ref name=forumacrh&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070225145314/http://www.zmag.org/forums/chomforumacrh.htm A selection of Chomsky]&lt;/ref&gt;

== The filters ==

=== Ownership ===
The size and [[Profit (accounting)|profit]]-seeking imperative of dominant media corporations create a bias. The authors point to how in the early nineteenth century, a radical British press had emerged that addressed the concerns of workers, but excessive [[stamp duties]], designed to restrict newspaper ownership to the 'respectable' wealthy, began to change the face of the press. Nevertheless, there remained a degree of diversity. In post World War II Britain, radical or worker-friendly newspapers such as the ''[[Daily Herald (UK newspaper)|Daily Herald]]'', ''[[News Chronicle]]'', ''[[Sunday Citizen]]'' (all since failed or absorbed into other publications), and the ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' (at least until the late 1970s) regularly published articles questioning the [[capitalist]] system. The authors posit that these earlier radical papers were not constrained by corporate ownership and therefore, were free to criticize the capitalist system.

[[File:Corporationsownmedia.png|thumb|A table of six big media conglomerates in 2014, including some of their subsidiaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Spaynton|title=English: corp own|date=2015-06-10|url=https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Corporationsownmedia.png|accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source|date=July 2017}}]]

Herman and Chomsky argue that since mainstream media outlets are currently either large [[corporation]]s or part of [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerates]] (e.g. [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]] or [[General Electric]]), the information presented to the public will be biased with respect to these interests. Such conglomerates frequently extend beyond traditional media fields and thus have extensive financial interests that may be endangered when certain information is publicized. According to this reasoning, news items that most endanger the corporate financial interests of those who own the media will face the greatest bias and censorship.

It then follows that if to maximize profit means sacrificing news objectivity, then the news sources that ultimately survive must be fundamentally biased, with regard to news in which they have a [[conflict of interest]].

=== Advertising ===
The second filter of the propaganda model is funding generated through [[advertising]]. Most newspapers have to attract advertising in order to cover the costs of production; without it, they would have to increase the price of their newspaper. There is fierce competition throughout the media to attract advertisers; a newspaper which gets less advertising than its competitors is at a serious disadvantage. Lack of success in raising advertising revenue was another factor in the demise of the 'people's newspapers' of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries.

The product is composed of the affluent readers who buy the newspaper—who also comprise the educated decision-making sector of the population—while the actual clientele served by the newspaper includes the businesses that pay to advertise their goods. According to this filter, the news is "filler" to get privileged readers to see the advertisements which makes up the content and will thus take whatever form is most conducive to attracting educated decision-makers. Stories that conflict with their "buying mood", it is argued, will tend to be marginalized or excluded, along with information that presents a picture of the world that collides with advertisers' interests. The theory argues that the people buying the newspaper are the product which is sold to the businesses that buy advertising space; the news has only a marginal role as the product.

=== Sourcing ===
The third of Herman and Chomsky's five filters relates to the sourcing of mass media news: "The mass media are drawn into a symbiotic relationship with powerful sources of information by economic necessity and reciprocity of interest." Even large media corporations such as the [[BBC]] cannot afford to place reporters everywhere. They concentrate their resources where news stories are likely to happen: the [[White House]], [[the Pentagon]], [[10 Downing Street]] and other central news "terminals". Although British newspapers may occasionally complain about the "spin-doctoring" of [[New Labour]], for example, they are dependent upon the pronouncements of "the Prime Minister's personal spokesperson" for government news. Business corporations and trade organizations are also trusted sources of stories considered newsworthy. Editors and journalists who offend these powerful news sources, perhaps by questioning the veracity or bias of the furnished material, can be threatened with the denial of access to their media life-blood - fresh news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Cromwell|first=David|authorlink=David Cromwell|title=The Propaganda Model: An Overview|year=2002|publisher=excerpted from Private Planet: Corporate Plunder and the Fight Back; chomsky.info|url=http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/2002----.htm|accessdate=7 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the media has become reluctant to run articles that will harm corporate interests that provide them with the resources that they depend upon.

This relationship also gives rise to a "moral division of labor", in which "officials have and give the facts" and "reporters merely get them". Journalists are then supposed to adopt an uncritical attitude that makes it possible for them to accept corporate values without experiencing [[cognitive dissonance]].

=== Flak ===
The fourth filter is 'flak' (not to be confused with flack which means promoters or publicity agents), described by Herman and Chomsky as 'negative responses to a media statement or [TV or radio] program. It may take the form of letters, telegrams, phone calls, petitions, lawsuits, speeches and Bills before Congress and other modes of complaint, threat and punitive action'. Business organizations regularly come together to form flak machines. An example is the US-based [[Global Climate Coalition]] (GCC), comprising fossil fuel and automobile companies such as Exxon, Texaco and Ford. The GCC was started up by Burson-Marsteller, one of the world's largest public relations companies, to attack the credibility of climate scientists and 'scare stories' about global warming.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url=https://www.uow.edu.au/~sharonb/columns/probe11.html |title="The Decline of the Global Climate Coalition"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Chomsky and Herman "flak" refers to negative responses to a media statement or program. The term "flak" has been used to describe what Chomsky and Herman see as efforts to discredit organizations or individuals who disagree with or cast doubt on the prevailing assumptions which Chomsky and Herman view as favorable to established power (e.g., "[[The Establishment]]"). Unlike the first three "filtering" mechanisms—which are derived from analysis of market mechanisms—flak is characterized by concerted efforts to manage public information.

===Anti-Communism and fear===
{{rquote|right|So I think when we talked about the "fifth filter" we should have brought in all this stuff -- the way artificial fears are created with a dual purpose... partly to get rid of people you don't like but partly to frighten the rest.
Because if people are frightened, they will accept authority.|[[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;''Understanding Power'', Footnote 35&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

The fifth and final news filter that Herman and Chomsky identified was 'anti-communism'. ''Manufacturing Consent'' was written during the Cold War. Chomsky updated the model as "fear", often as 'the enemy' or an 'evil dictator' such as [[Colonel Gaddafi]], [[Paul Biya]], [[Saddam Hussein]] or [[Slobodan Milosevic]]. This is exemplified in British tabloid headlines of 'Smash Saddam!' and 'Clobba Slobba!'.&lt;ref name="The Propaganda Model: An Overview"&gt;[http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/2002----.htm The Propaganda Model: An Overview]&lt;/ref&gt; The same is said to extend to mainstream reporting of [[environmentalist]]s as '[[eco-terrorist]]s'. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' ran a series of articles in 1999 accusing activists from the [[non-violent]] [[direct action]] group [[Reclaim The Streets]] of stocking up on CS gas and stun guns.&lt;ref name="The Propaganda Model: An Overview"/&gt;

Anti-ideologies exploit public fear and hatred of groups that pose a potential threat, either real, exaggerated or imagined. [[Communism]] once posed the primary threat according to the model. Communism and [[socialism]] were portrayed by their detractors as endangering freedoms of speech, movement, the press and so forth. They argue that such a portrayal was often used as a means to silence voices critical of elite interests. Chomsky argues that since the end of the Cold War (1991), anticommunism was replaced by the "War on Terror", as the major social control mechanism. Following the events of September 11, 2001, some scholars agree that [[Islamophobia]] is replacing anti-communism as a new source of public fear.{{sfn|Allan|2010|p=22}}

== Case examples ==
Following the theoretical exposition of the propaganda model, ''Manufacturing Consent'' contains a large section where the authors seek to test their hypotheses. If the propaganda model is right and the filters do influence media content, a particular form of bias would be expected—one that systematically favors corporate interests.

They also looked at what they perceived as naturally occurring "historical [[control group]]s" where two events, similar in their properties but differing in the expected media attitude towards them, are contrasted using objective measures such as coverage of key events (measured in column inches) or editorials favoring a particular issue (measured in number).

===Coverage of "enemy" countries===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=[The polls] show that all of the [[Elections in Nicaragua|opposition parties in Nicaragua]] combined had the support of only 9 percent of the population, but they have 100 percent of [[Stephen Kinzer]].|source=—[[Noam Chomsky]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uiowa.edu/~cyberlaw/lem02/chomsky1.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150119230506/http://www.uiowa.edu/~cyberlaw/lem02/chomsky1.html|archivedate=19 January 2015|title=Chomsky, Understanding Power}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Examples of bias given by the authors include the failure of the media to question the [[legality of the Vietnam War]] while greatly emphasizing the [[Soviet–Afghan War]] as an [[War of aggression|act of aggression]].{{sfn|Herman|Chomsky|2002|p=252}}

Other biases include a propensity to emphasize violent acts such as [[genocide]] more in enemy or unfriendly countries such as [[Kosovo]] while ignoring greater genocide in allied countries such as the [[Indonesian occupation of East Timor]].{{sfn|Herman|Chomsky|2002|p=xx}} This bias is also said to exist in foreign elections, giving favorable media coverage to fraudulent elections in allied countries such as [[El Salvador]] and [[Guatemala]], while unfavorable coverage is given to legitimate elections in enemy countries such as [[Nicaragua]].{{sfn|Herman|Chomsky|2002|p=112}}

[[File:Iraq War Media Sources Opinion Percentage.svg|300px|thumb|A study found that in the lead up to the Iraq War, most sources were overwhelmingly in favor of the invasion.]]

Chomsky also asserts that the media accurately covered events such as the [[Second Battle of Fallujah|Battle of Fallujah]] but because of an ideological bias, it acted as pro-government propaganda. In describing coverage of raid on Fallujah General Hospital he stated that ''[[The New York Times]]'', "accurately recorded the battle of Fallujah but it was celebrated... it was a celebration of ongoing war crimes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Chomsky: US won’t acknowledge Iraq war crimes|author=Saba Hamedy|url=http://dailyfreepress.com/2010/09/19/chomsky-us-wont-acknowledge-iraq-war-crimes/|newspaper=The Daily Free Press|date=19 September 2010|accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article in question was "[https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/08/international/middleeast/08hospital.html Early Target of Offensive Is a Hospital]".

===Scandals of leaks===
The authors point to biases that are based on only reporting scandals which benefit a section of power, while ignoring scandals that hurt the powerless. The biggest example of this was how the US media greatly covered the [[Watergate Scandal]] but ignored the [[COINTELPRO]] exposures. While the Watergate break-in was a political threat to powerful people ([[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]]), COINTELPRO harmed average citizens and went as far as political [[assassination]]. Other examples include coverage of the [[Iran–Contra affair]] by only focusing on people in power such as [[Oliver North]] but omitting coverage of the civilians killed in [[Nicaragua]] as the result of [[Contras#U.S. military and financial assistance|aid to the contras]].

In a 2010 interview, Chomsky compared media coverage of the [[Afghan War documents leak|Afghan War Diaries]] released by [[WikiLeaks]] and lack of media coverage to a study of [[Fallujah during the Iraq War#Health effects|severe health problems in Fallujah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHfYtvYRgdk Chomsky on the WikiLeaks' Coverage in the Press]&lt;/ref&gt; While there was ample coverage of WikiLeaks there was no American coverage of the Fallujah study,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medialens.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=5:beyond-hiroshima-the-non-reporting-of-fallujahs-cancer-catastrophe&amp;catid=1:alerts&amp;Itemid=34 BEYOND HIROSHIMA - THE NON-REPORTING OF FALLUJAH'S CANCER CATASTROPHE]&lt;/ref&gt; in which the health situation in Fallujah was described by the British media as "worse than [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima|Hiroshima]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/middle-east/toxic-legacy-of-us-assault-on-fallujah-worse-than-hiroshima-2034065.html Toxic legacy of US assault on Fallujah 'worse than [[Atomic bombing of Hiroshima|Hiroshima]]']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==
{{See also|Media coverage of the Iraq War|Media coverage of climate change}}

Since the publication of ''Manufacturing Consent'', Herman and Chomsky have adopted the theory and have given it a prominent role in their writings, lectures and theoretical frameworks. Chomsky has made extensive use of its explanative power to lend support to his interpretations of mainstream media attitudes towards a wide array of events, including the following:
* [[Gulf War]] (1990), the media's failure to report on Saddam's peace offers.{{sfn|Edwards|1998}}
* [[2003 invasion of Iraq|Iraq invasion]] (2003), the media's failure to report on the [[legality of the Iraq War|legality of the war]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pfKpiETLgM Illegal but Legitimate: a Dubious Doctrine for the Times. ] University of Washington. April 20, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; despite overwhelming public opinion in favor of only invading Iraq with UN authorization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gallup.com/poll/7195/support-invasion-iraq-remains-contingent-un-approval.aspx Support for Invasion of Iraq Remains Contingent on U.N. Approval]&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Page|2008|p=109}} According to the liberal watchdog group [[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]], there was a disproportionate focus on pro-war sources while total [[anti-war]] sources only made up 10% of the media (with only 3% of US sources being anti-war).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Steve Rendall  |author2=Tara Broughel |lastauthoramp=yes |year=2003 |title=Amplifying Officials, Squelching Dissent |journal=Extra!  |publisher=[[Fairness and Accuracy In Reporting]] |url=http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1145 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Global warming]], the media gives near equal balance to people who [[Climate change denial|deny climate change]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=1978 Journalistic Balance as Global Warming Bias], FAIR&lt;/ref&gt; despite only "about one percent" of climate scientists taking this view.{{sfn|Anderegg|Prall|Harold|Schneider|2010}} Chomsky commented that there are "three sides" on climate change (deniers, those who follow the scientific consensus, and people who think that the consensus underestimates the threat from global warming), but in framing the debate the media usually ignore people who say that the scientific consensus is unduly optimistic.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_O3cNc2JoMA Noam Chomsky and Bill McKibben on Global Warming]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
On the rare occasions the propaganda model is discussed in the [[mainstream media]] there is usually a large reaction. In 1988, when Chomsky was interviewed by [[Bill Moyers]] there were 1,000 letters in response, one of the biggest written reactions in the show's history. When he was interviewed by [[TV Ontario]], the show generated 31,321 call-ins, which was a new record for the station.
In 1996, when Chomsky was interviewed by [[Andrew Marr]] the producer commented that the response was "astonishing". He commented that "[t]he audience reaction was astonishing... I have never worked on a programme which elicited so many letters and calls".{{sfn|Edwards|1998}}

In May 2007, Chomsky and Herman spoke at the [[University of Windsor]] in Canada summarizing developments and responding to criticisms related to the model.&lt;ref name=20years&gt;[http://www.uwindsor.ca/units/commstudies/propaganda.nsf/intoc/dc899988bd643987852572cd006efae1 20 Years of Propaganda] University of Windsor, Ontario, Canada, May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Both authors stated they felt the propaganda model is still applicable (Herman said even more so than when it was introduced), although they did suggest a few areas where they believe it falls short and needs to be extended in light of recent developments.{{sfn|Mullen|2007}}

Chomsky has insisted that while the propaganda role of the media "is intensified by ownership and advertising" the problem mostly lies with "ideological-doctrinal commitments that are part of intellectual life" or [[Intellectual history|intellectual culture]] of the people in power. He compares the media to scholarly literature which he says has the same problems even without the constraints of the propaganda model.&lt;ref&gt;[https://chomsky.info/20011115/ Chomsky In First Person], Frontline&lt;/ref&gt;

At the Windsor talk, Chomsky pointed out that [[Edward S. Herman]] was primarily responsible for creating the theory although Chomsky supported it. According to Chomsky, he insisted Herman's name appear first on the cover of ''Manufacturing Consent'' because of his primary role researching and developing the theory.&lt;ref name=20years /&gt;

===American pressure groups===
With the emergence of the [[Internet]] as a cheap and potentially wide-ranging means of communication, a number of independent websites have surfaced which adopt the propaganda model to subject media to close scrutiny. Examples of these are, [[Free Press (organization)|Free Press]] and [[Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting|FAIR]].

===Harvard media torture study===
{{quote box|width=30%|align=right|quote=From the early 1930s until...2004, the newspapers that covered [[waterboarding]] almost uniformly called the practice torture or implied it was torture: ''The New York Times'' characterized it thus in 81.5% (44 of 54) of articles on the subject and the ''Los Angeles Times'' did so in 96.3% of articles (26 of 27). By contrast, from 2002‐2008, the studied newspapers almost never referred to waterboarding as torture.|source=—Desai et al.&lt;ref name="HarvardStudy"&gt;[http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/4420886/torture_at_times_hks_students.pdf Torture at Times: Waterboarding in the Media]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In April 2010, a study conducted by the [[John F. Kennedy School of Government|Harvard Kennedy School]] showed that media outlets such as ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' stopped using the term "[[torture]]" for [[waterboarding]] when the US government committed it, from 2002 to 2008.&lt;ref name="HarvardStudy"/&gt; It also noted that the press was "much more likely to call waterboarding torture if a country other than the United States is the perpetrator."&lt;ref name="HarvardStudy"/&gt;
The study was similar to media studies done in ''Manufacturing Consent'' for topics such as comparing how the term "genocide" is used in the media when referring to allied and enemy countries.

[[Glenn Greenwald]] in response said that "We don’t need a [[state-run media]] because our media outlets volunteer for the task..." and commented that the media often act as propaganda for the government without coercion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.salon.com/2010/06/30/media_258/ New study documents media’s servitude to government]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies of media outside the US===
Chomsky has commented in the "ChomskyChat Forum" on the applicability of the Propaganda Model to the media environment of other countries: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;That's only rarely been done in any systematic way. There is work on the British media, by a good U[niversity] of Glasgow media group. And interesting work on British Central America coverage by Mark Curtis in his book ''Ambiguities of Power''. There is work on France, done in Belgium mostly, also a recent book by Serge Halimi (editor of ''Le Monde diplomatique''). There is one very careful study by a Dutch graduate student, applying the methods Ed Herman used in studying US media reaction to elections (El Salvador, Nicaragua) to 14 major European newspapers. ... Interesting results. Discussed a bit (along with some others) in a footnote in chapter 5 of my book "Deterring Democracy," if you happen to have that around.&lt;ref name=forumacrh /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
For more than a decade, a British-based website [[Media Lens]] has examined their domestic broadcasters and liberal press. Its criticisms are featured in the books ''[[Guardians of Power]]'' (2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Peter |last=Wilby |title=On the margins |newspaper=New Statesman |date=30 January 2006 |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/200601300049}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Newspeak in the 21st Century'' (2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Stephen |last=Poole |title=Non-fiction review roundup |newspaper=The Guardian |date=3 October 2009 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/oct/03/nonfiction-review-roundup-stephen-poole}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies have also expanded the propaganda model to examine news media in the [[People's Republic of China]]{{sfnm |1a1=Hearns-Branaman |1y=2009 |2a1=Hearns-Branaman |2y=2015}} and for film production in Hollywood.{{sfn|Alford|2009}}

====''News of the World''====
{{Main|News of the World phone hacking affair}}

In July 2011, the journalist [[Paul Mason (journalist)|Paul Mason]], then working for the BBC, pointed out that the [[News International phone hacking scandal]] threw light on close links between the press and politicians. However, he argued that the closure of the mass-circulation newspaper ''[[News of the World]]'', which took place after the scandal broke, conformed only partly to the propaganda model. He drew attention to the role of [[social media]], saying that "large corporations pulled their advertising" because of the "scale of the social media response" (a response which was mainly to do with the [[Milly Dowler]] revelations, although Mason does not go into this level of detail).&lt;ref name=PMason&gt;"[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-14093772 Murdoch: the network defeats the hierarchy]", BBC.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mason praised ''[[The Guardian]]'' for having told the truth about the phone-hacking, but expressed doubt about the viability of the newspaper.
&lt;blockquote&gt;One part of the Chomsky doctrine has been proven by exception. He stated that newspapers that told the truth could not make money. ''The Guardian''...is indeed burning money and may run out of it in three years' time.&lt;ref name=PMason /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criticism==

=== ''The Anti-Chomsky Reader'' ===
Eli Lehrer of the  [[American Enterprise Institute]] criticized the theory in ''[[The Anti-Chomsky Reader]]''. According to Lehrer, the fact that papers like ''The New York Times'' and ''The Wall Street Journal'' have disagreements is evidence that the media is not a monolithic entity. Lehrer also believes that the media cannot have a corporate bias because it reports on and exposes [[corporate corruption]]. Lehrer asserts that the model amounts to a Marxist conception of right-wing [[false consciousness]].{{sfn|Lehrer|2004}}

Herman and Chomsky have said that the media "is not a solid monolith" but that it represents a debate between powerful interests while ignoring perspectives that challenge the "fundamental premises" of all these interests.{{sfn|Herman|Chomsky|2002|p=Ix}} For instance, during the Vietnam War there was disagreement among the media over tactics, but the broader issue of the legality and legitimacy of the war was ignored (see [[Propaganda model#Coverage of "enemy" countries|Coverage of "enemy" countries]]). Additionally, Chomsky has said that while the media are against corruption, they are not against society legally empowering corporate interests which is a reflection of the powerful interests that the model would predict.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Gu1ONVg362o  Chomsky "Media" interview by Andrew Marr] ''The Big Idea'', 1996&lt;/ref&gt; The authors have also said that the model does not seek to address "the effects of the media on the public" which might be ineffective at shaping [[public opinion]].{{sfn|Herman|Chomsky|2002|p=xii}} Edward Herman has said "critics failed to comprehend that the propaganda model is about how the media work, not how effective they are".&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/20031209.htm The Propaganda Model: A Retrospective] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040603191844/http://www.chomsky.info/onchomsky/20031209.htm |date=2004-06-03 }}" Edward Herman&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Inroads: A Journal of Opinion''===
Gareth Morley argues in an article in ''Inroads: A Journal of Opinion'' that widespread coverage of [[Israel]]i mistreatment of protesters as compared with little coverage of similar (or much worse) events in sub-Saharan Africa is poorly explained.{{sfn|Morley|2003}} Chomsky responded that when testing a model, examples should be carefully paired to [[Scientific control|control]] reasons for discrepancies not related to political bias. For instance, general coverage of the two areas compared should be similar. In this case, according to Chomsky, they are not: news from Israel (in any form) is far more common than news from sub-Saharan Africa.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

===''The New York Times'' review===
Writing for ''The New York Times'', the historian [[Walter LaFeber]] criticized the book ''Manufacturing Consent'' for overstating its case, in particular with regards to reporting on Nicaragua and not adequately explaining how a powerful propaganda system would let military aid to the Contra rebels be blocked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/06/books/whose-news.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Manufacturing+consent&amp;st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=Whose News? | first1=Walter | last1=Laferber | date=6 November 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herman responded in a letter by stating that the system was not "all powerful" and that LaFeber did not address their main point regarding Nicaragua. LaFeber replied that:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr. Herman wants to have it both ways: to claim that leading American journals "mobilize bias" but object when I cite crucial examples that weaken the book's thesis. If the news media are so unqualifiedly bad, the book should at least explain why so many publications (including my own) can cite their stories to attack President Reagan's Central American policy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/12/11/books/l-news-and-propaganda-307488.html?scp=2&amp;sq=Manufacturing+consent&amp;st=nyt | work=The New York Times | title=News and Propaganda | date=11 December 1988 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Chomsky responds to LaFeber's reply in ''[[Necessary Illusions]]'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;What is more, a propaganda model is not weakened by the discovery that with careful and critical reading, material could be unearthed in the media that could be used by those that objected to "President Reagan's Central American policy" on grounds of principle, opposing not its failures but its successes: the near destruction of Nicaragua and the blunting of the popular forces that threatened to bring democracy and social reform to El Salvador, among other achievements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Chomsky |first=Noam |authorlink=Noam Chomsky |date=1989 |title=Necessary Illusions |edition=1st |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=k6XkaZpLXxsC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;focus=viewport&amp;vq=148&amp;dq=necessary+illusions&amp;output=html_text |pages=148–151 | accessdate=January 4, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries''' ('''REDD+''') was first negotiated under the [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] (UNFCCC) in 2005, with the objective of [[climate change mitigation|mitigating climate change]] through reducing net emissions of [[greenhouse gas]]es through enhanced [[forest management]] in developing countries. Most of the key REDD+ decisions were completed by 2013, with the final pieces of the rulebook finished in 2015.

In the last two decades, various studies estimate that land use change, including [[deforestation]] and [[forest degradation]], accounts for 12-29% of global greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref name="Fearnside"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Climatic Change |year=2000 |pages=115–158 |title= Global warming and tropical land-use change: Greenhouse gas emissions from biomass burning, decomposition and soils in forest conversion, shifting cultivation and secondary vegetation |author= Philip Fearnside|volume= 46|doi=10.1023/a:1005569915357 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Policies"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Resources Magazine |date=Dec 2007 |page=7 |title= Policies to Reduce Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation (REDD) in Tropical Forests |author= Myers, Erin C. |url=http://www.rff.org/Publications/Pages/PublicationDetails.aspx?PublicationID=17519 |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Werf"&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Nature Geoscience|date=Nov 2009 |pages=737–738 |title= CO2 emissions from forest loss|authors = G.R. van der Werf, D. C. Morton, R. S. DeFries, J. G. J. Olivier, P. S. Kasibhatla, R. B. Jackson, G. J. Collatz and J. T. Randerson |doi = 10.1038/ngeo671 |volume=2 |issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason the inclusion of reducing emissions from land use change is considered essential to achieve the objectives of the UNFCCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Butler|first=Rhett |title=Big REDD |journal=Washington Monthly |volume=41|date=Aug 2009 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the negotiations for the [[Kyoto Protocol]], and then in particular its [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM), the inclusion of tropical forest management was debated but eventually dropped due to anticipated methodological difficulties in establishing – in particular – [[Carbon credit#Additionality and its importance|additionality]] and leakage (detrimental effects outside of the project area attributable to project activities). What remained on forestry was "Afforestation and Reforestation", sectoral scope 14 of the CDM. Under this sectoral scope areas of land that had no forest cover since 1990 could be replanted with commercial or indigenous tree species. In its first eight years of operation 52 projects had been registered under the "Afforestation and Reforestation" scope of the CDM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdm.unfccc.int/Projects/projsearch.html UNFCCC CDM project search page], accessed 2014-02-28&lt;/ref&gt; The cumbersome administrative procedures and corresponding high transaction costs are often blamed for this slow uptake. Beyond the CDM, all developed countries that were parties to the Kyoto Protocol also committed to measuring and reporting on efforts to reduce net greenhouse gas emissions from forests. The United States also measures and reports on the net greenhouse gas sequestration in its forests.

In response to what many perceived to be a failure to address a major source of global greenhouse gas emissions, the [[Coalition for Rainforest Nations]] (CfRN) was established and in 2005 they proposed to the Conference of the Parties to the UNFCCC policy approaches and positive incentives for the reduction of emissions of greenhouse gases stemming from tropical deforestation and forest degradation as a climate change mitigation measure.

== History ==

=== REDD ===

REDD was first discussed in 2005 by the UNFCCC at its [[2005 United Nations Climate Change Conference|11th session]] of the Conference of the Parties to the Convention (COP) at the request of Costa Rica and Papua New Guinea, on behalf of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, when they submitted the document "Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries: Approaches to Stimulate Action",&lt;ref name="CfRN-request"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/cop11/eng/misc01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cpsc1.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a request to create an agenda item to discuss consideration of reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in natural forests as a mitigation measure. COP 11 entered the request to consider the document as agenda item 6: ''Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action''.&lt;ref name="COP-11"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2005/cop11/eng/05.pdf |title=UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2005/5 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== REDD+ ===

==== Bali Action Plan ====
REDD received substantial attention from the UNFCCC – and the attending community – at [[2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 13]], December 2007, where the first substantial decision on REDD+ was adopted, Decision 2/CP.13: "Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action",&lt;ref name="COP-13"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2007/cop13/eng/06a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp6a1 reissued.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling for demonstration activities to be reported upon two years later and assessment of drivers of deforestation. REDD+ was also referenced in decision 1/CP.13, the "Bali Action Plan", with reference to all five eligible activities for REDD+ (with sustainable management of forests, conservation of forest carbon stocks and enhancement of forest carbon stocks constituting the "+" in REDD+).&lt;ref name="COP-13" /&gt;

The call for demonstration activities in decision 2/CP.13 led to a very large number of programmes and projects, including the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility (FCPF) of the [[World Bank]], the [[UN-REDD Programme]], and a flurry of smaller projects financed by the Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative (NICFI), the United States, the United Kingdom, and Germany, among many others. All of these were based on substantive guidance from the UNFCCC.

==== Definition of main elements ====
In 2009 at [[2009 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 15]], decision 4/CP.15: "Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries"&lt;ref name="COP-15"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2009/cop15/eng/11a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp11add.1.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; provided more substantive information on requirements for REDD+. Specifically, the national forest monitoring system was introduced, with elements of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV). Furthermore, countries were encouraged to develop national strategies, develop domestic capacity, establish reference levels, and establish a participatory approach with "full and effective engagement of indigenous peoples and local communities in (…) monitoring and reporting".

A year later at [[2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 16]] decision 1/CP.16 was adopted.&lt;ref name="COP-16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2010/cop16/eng/07a01.pdf |title=Microsoft Word - cp7a1.doc |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In section C: "Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries" environmental and social safeguards were introduced, with a reiteration of requirements for the national forest monitoring system. These safeguards were introduced to ensure that implementation of REDD+ at the national level would not lead to detrimental effects for the environment or the local population. Countries are required to provide summaries of information on how these safeguards are implemented throughout the three "phases" of REDD+.

In 2011 decision 12/CP.17 was adopted at [[2012 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 17]]: "Guidance on systems for providing information on how safeguards are addressed and respected and modalities relating to forest reference emission levels and forest reference levels as referred to in decision 1/CP.16".&lt;ref name="COP-17"&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2011/cop17/eng/09a02.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Details are provided on preparation and submission of reference levels and guidance on providing information on safeguards.

==== Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus ====
In December 2013, [[2013 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 19]] produced no fewer than seven decisions on REDD+, which are jointly known as the "Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus".&lt;ref name="COP-19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2013/cop19/eng/10a01.pdf |title=UNFCCC document FCCC/CP/2013/10/Add.1 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; These decisions address a work programme on results-based finance; coordination of support for implementation; modalities for national forest monitoring systems; presenting information on safeguards; technical assessment of reference (emission) levels; modalities for measuring, reporting and verifying (MRV); and information on addressing the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. Requirements to be eligible access to "results-based finance" have been specified: through submission of reports for which the contents have been specified; technical assessment through International Consultation and Analysis (ICA) for which procedures have been specified;. With these decisions the overall framework for REDD+ implementation appears to be complete, although many details still need to be provided.

COP 20 in December 2014 did not produce any new decisions on REDD+. A reference was made to REDD+ in decision 8/CP.20 "Report of the Green Climate Fund to the Conference of the Parties and guidance to the Green Climate Fund", where in paragraph 18 the COP "''requests'' the Board of the Green Climate Fund (...) (b) to consider decisions relevant to REDD-plus", referring back to earlier COP decisions on REDD+.&lt;ref name="COP-20"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2014/cop20/eng/10a02.pdf |title=Report of the Conference of the Parties on its twentieth session, held in Lima from 1 to 14 December 2014 |format=PDF |date=2015-02-02 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the remaining outstanding decisions on REDD+ were completed at COP21 in 2015. With the conclusion of decisions on reporting on the safeguards, non-market approaches, and non-carbon benefits, the UNFCCC rulebook on REDD+ was completed. All countries were also encouraged to implement and support REDD+in Article 5 of the Paris Agreement. This was part of a broader Article that specified that all countries should take action to protect and enhance their greenhouse gas sinks and reservoirs (stores of sequestered carbon).

== Terminology ==

The approach detailed under the UNFCCC is commonly referred to as "reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation", abbreviated as REDD+. This title and the acronyms, however, are not used by the COP itself.

The original submission by Papua New Guinea and Costa Rica, on behalf of the Coalition for Rainforest Nations, dated 28 July 2005, was entitled "Reducing Emissions from Deforestation in Developing Countries: Approaches to Stimulate Action", exactly as is written here.&lt;ref name="CfRN-request" /&gt; COP 11 entered the request to consider the document as agenda item 6: "Reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries: approaches to stimulate action", again written here exactly as in the official text.&lt;ref name="COP-11" /&gt; The name for the agenda item was also used at COP 13 in Bali, December 2007. By COP 15 in Copenhagen, December 2009, the scope of the agenda item was broadened to "Methodological guidance for activities relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries",&lt;ref name="COP-15" /&gt; moving to "Policy approaches and positive incentives on issues relating to reducing emissions from deforestation and forest degradation in developing countries; and the role of conservation, sustainable management of forests and enhancement of forest carbon stocks in developing countries" by COP 16.&lt;ref name="COP-16" /&gt; At COP 17 the title of the decision simply referred back to an earlier decision: "Guidance on systems for providing information on how safeguards are addressed and respected and modalities relating to forest reference emission levels and forest reference levels as referred to in decision 1/CP.16".&lt;ref name="COP-17" /&gt; At COP 19 the titles of decisions 9 and 12 refer back to decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 70 and appendix I respectively, while the other decisions only mention the topic under consideration.&lt;ref name="COP-19" /&gt;

None of these decisions use an acronym for the title of the agenda item or otherwise; the ubiquitous acronym is thus not coined by the COP of the UNFCCC. Surprisingly therefore, the set of decisions on REDD+ that were adopted at COP 19 in Warsaw, December 2013, were jointly christened the '''Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus''' in a footnote to the title of each of the decisions.&lt;ref name="COP-19" /&gt;

All things considered, there should be no confusion on the formal name(s):

* '''REDD''' originally referred to "reducing emissions from deforestation in developing countries" the title of the original document on REDD&lt;ref name="COP-11" /&gt; It was superseded in the negotiations by REDD+
* '''REDD+''' (or '''REDD-plus''') refers to "reducing emissions from deforestation ''and forest degradation'' in developing countries, and the role of ''conservation, sustainable management of forests, and enhancement of forest carbon stocks'' in developing countries" (emphasis added); the most recent, elaborated terminology used by the COP&lt;ref name="COP-16" /&gt;

However, the commonly used name outside of the UNFCCC seems to have stuck, perhaps not surprisingly seeing that the second title is quite unwieldy.

== Main elements of REDD+ ==

As an approach under the multi-lateral climate change agreement, REDD+ is essentially a vehicle to encourage developing countries to  reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases through a variety of forest management options, and to provide technical and financial support for these efforts. As with other approaches under the UNFCCC, there are few prescriptions that specifically mandate how to implement the mechanism at national level; the principles of national sovereignty and subsidiarity imply that the UNFCCC can only provide guidelines for implementation, and require that reports are submitted in a certain format and open for review by the Convention. There are certain aspects that go beyond this basic philosophy – such as the so-called safeguards, explained in more detail below – but in essence REDD+ is no more than a set of guidelines on how to report on forest resources and forest management strategies and their results in terms of reducing emissions and enhancing removals of greenhouse gases. However, a set of requirements has been elaborated to ensure that REDD+ programs contain key elements and that reports from Parties are consistent and comparable and that their content are open to review and in function of the objectives of the Convention.

Decision 1/CP 16 requests all developing countries aiming to undertake REDD+ to develop the following elements:

(a) A national strategy or action plan;

(b) A national forest reference emission level and/or forest reference level or, if appropriate, as an interim measure, subnational forest reference emission levels and/or forest reference levels

(c) A robust and transparent national forest monitoring system for the monitoring and reporting on REDD+ activities (see below), with, if appropriate, subnational monitoring and reporting as an interim measure

(d) A system for providing information on how the social and environmental safeguards (included in an appendix to the decision) are being addressed and respected throughout the implementation of REDD+

It further requests developing countries, when developing and implementing their national REDD+ strategies or action plans, to address, among other issues, the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation, land tenure issues, forest governance issues, gender considerations and the social and environmental safeguards, ensuring the full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, inter alia indigenous peoples and local communities;

=== Policies and measures ===

In the text of the Convention repeated reference is made to national "policies and measures", the set of legal, regulatory and administrative instruments that Parties develop and implement to achieve the objective of the Convention. These policies can be specific to climate change mitigation or adaptation, or of a more generic nature but with an impact on greenhouse gas emissions. Many of the signatory parties to the UNFCCC have by now established climate change strategies and response measures.

The REDD+ approach has a similar, more focused set of policies and measures. Forest sector laws and procedures are typically in place in most countries. In addition, countries have to develop specific national strategies and/or action plans for REDD+.

Of specific interest to REDD+ are the drivers of deforestation and forest degradation. The UNFCCC decisions call on countries to make an assessment of these drivers and to base the policies and measures on this assessment, such that the policies and measures can be directed to where the impact is greatest. Some of the drivers will be generic – in the sense that they are prevalent in many countries, such as increasing population pressure – while others will be very specific to countries or regions within countries.

Countries are encouraged to identify "national circumstances" that impact the drivers: specific conditions within the country that impact the forest resources. Hints for typical national circumstances can be found in preambles to various COP decisions, such as "''Reaffirming'' that economic and social development and poverty eradication are global priorities" in the Bali Action Plan,&lt;ref name="COP-13"  /&gt; enabling developing countries to prioritize policies like poverty eradication through [[agricultural expansion]] or hydropower development over forest protection.

=== Eligible activities ===

The decisions on REDD+ enumerate five "eligible activities" that developing countries may implement to reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases:
:"(a) Reducing emissions from deforestation.
:(b) Reducing emissions from forest degradation.
:(c) Conservation of forest carbon stocks.
:(d) Sustainable management of forests.
:(e) Enhancement of forest carbon stocks".&lt;ref name="COP-16" /&gt;

The first two activities reduce emissions of greenhouse gases and they are the two activities listed in the original submission on REDD+ in 2005 by the Coalition for Rainforest Nations.&lt;ref name="CfRN-request" /&gt; The three remaining activities constitute the "+" in REDD+. The last one enhances removals of greenhouse gases, while the effect of the other two on emissions or removals is indeterminate but expected to be minimal.

The UNFCCC provides no guidance on what specific actions constitute the eligible activities. Possibly an approach will be adopted as under the CDM: project proponents – in this case Parties to the Convention – can submit documentation on an approach which will be reviewed by a technical committee of the UNFCCC. Upon approval this "approved methodology" will be publicly available to all for its application.

=== Reference levels ===

Reference levels are a key component for any national REDD+ program and critical in at least two aspects. Firstly, they serve as a baseline for measuring the success of REDD+ programs in reducing greenhouse gas emissions from forests. Second, they are available for examination by the international community to assess the reported emission reductions or enhanced removals. In that sense it establishes the confidence of the international community in the national REDD+ program. The results measured against these baselines may be eligible for results-based payments. Setting the reference levels too lax will erode the confidence in the national REDD+ program, while setting them too strict will erode the potential to earn the benefits with which to operate the national REDD+ program. Very careful consideration of all relevant information is therefore of crucial importance.

The requirements and characteristics of reference levels are under the purview of the UNFCCC. Given the wide variety in ecological conditions and country-specific circumstances, these requirements are rather global and every country will have a range of options in its definition of reference levels within its territory.

A reference level (RL) is expressed as an amount, derived by differencing a sequence of amounts over a period of time. For REDD+ purposes the amount is expressed in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-equivalents (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e) (see article on [[global warming potential]]) of emissions or removals per year. If the amounts are emissions, the reference level becomes a reference emission level (REL); however these RELs are seen by some as incomplete as they do not take into account removals.  Reference levels are based on a scope ‒ what is included? ‒ a scale ‒ the geographical area from which it is derived or to which it is applied ‒ and a period over which the reference level is calculated. The scope, the scale and the period can be modified in reference to national circumstances: specific conditions in the country that would call for an adjustment of the basis from which the reference levels are constructed. A reference level can be based on observations or measurements of amounts in the past, in which case it is retrospective, or it can be an expectation or projection of amounts into the future, in which case it is prospective.&lt;ref&gt;[http://redd-oar.org/links/REED+RL.pdf Guidelines for REDD+ Reference Levels: Principles and Recommendations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Reference levels have to eventually  have national coverage, but they may be composed from a number of sub-national reference levels. As an example, forest degradation may have a reference emission level for commercial selective logging and one for extraction of minor timber and firewood for subsistence use by rural communities. Effectively, every identified driver of deforestation or forest degradation has to be represented in one or more reference emission level(s). Similarly for reference levels for enhancement of carbon stocks, there may be a reference level for plantation timber species and one for natural regeneration, possibly stratified by ecological region or forest type.

Details on the reporting and technical assessment of reference levels is given in Decision 13/CP.19.&lt;ref name="COP-19" /&gt;

=== Monitoring: measurement, reporting and verification ===

In Decision 2/CP.15 of the UNFCCC countries are requested to develop national forest monitoring systems (NFMS) that support the functions of measurement, reporting and verification (MRV) of actions and achievements of the implementation of REDD+ activities.&lt;ref name="COP-15" /&gt; NFMS is the key component in the management of information for national REDD+ programs. A fully functional monitoring system can go beyond the requirements posted by the UNFCCC to include issues such as a registry of projects and participants, and evaluation of program achievements and policy effectiveness. It may be purpose-built, but it may also be integrated into existing forest monitoring tools.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

Measurements are suggested to be made using a combination of remote sensing and ground-based observations. [[Remote sensing]] is particularly suited to the assessment of areas of forest and stratification of different forest types. Ground-based observations involve forest surveys to measure the carbon pools used by the IPCC, as well as other parameters of interest such as those related to safeguards and eligible activity implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gfoi.org/sites/default/files/MGD%20report_V1.pdf Integrating remote-sensing and ground-based observations for estimation of emissions and removals of greenhouse gases in forests] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140305154228/http://gfoi.org/sites/default/files/MGD%20report_V1.pdf |date=5 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The reporting has to follow the guidance of the IPCC, in particular the "Good Practice Guidance for [[Land use, land-use change, and forestry]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc-nggip.iges.or.jp/public/gpglulucf/gpglulucf.html Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, Land-Use Change and Forestry]&lt;/ref&gt; which includes reporting templates to be included in National Communications of Parties to the UNFCCC. Included in the guidance are standard measurements protocols and analysis procedures which greatly impact the measurement systems that countries need to establish. The actual reporting of REDD+ results is not going through the National Communications, however, but through the Biennial Update Reports (BURs).&lt;ref name="COP-17"/&gt;

The technical assessment of these results is an independent, external process that is managed by the Secretariat to the UNFCCC; countries need to facilitate the requirements of this assessment. The technical assessment is included within the broader process of International Consultation and Analysis (ICA), which is effectively a peer-review by a team composed of an expert from an Annex I Party and an expert from a non-Annex I Party which "will be conducted in a manner that is nonintrusive, non-punitive and respectful of national sovereignty".&lt;ref name="COP-17" /&gt; This "technical team of experts shall analyse the extent to which:

:(a) There is consistency in methodologies, definitions, comprehensiveness and the information provided between the assessed reference level and the results of the implementation of the [REDD+] activities (...);
:(b) The data and information provided in the technical annex is transparent, consistent, complete and accurate;
:(c) The data and information provided in the technical annex is consistent with the [UNFCCC] guidelines (...);
:(d) The results are accurate, to the extent possible."&lt;ref name="COP-19" /&gt;

However, unlike a true verification the technical assessment cannot "approve" or "reject" the reference level, or the reported results measured against this reference level. It does provide clarity on potential areas for improvement.

Financing entities that seek to provide results-based payments (payments per tonne of mitigation achieved) typically seek a true verification of results by external experts, to provide assurance that the results for which they are paying are credible.

=== Safeguards ===

In response to concerns over the potential for negative consequences resulting from the implementation of REDD+ the UNFCCC established a list of safeguards that countries need to "address and respect" and "promote and support" in order to guarantee the correct and lasting generation of results from the REDD+ mechanism. These safeguards are:
:"(a)	That actions complement or are consistent with the objectives of national forest programmes and relevant international conventions and agreements;
:(b)	Transparent and effective national forest governance structures, taking into account national legislation and sovereignty;
:(c)	Respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities, by taking into account relevant international obligations, national circumstances and laws, and noting that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;
:(d)	The full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities;
:(e)	That actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the actions are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits;
:(f)	Actions to address the risks of reversals;
:(g)	Actions to reduce displacement of emissions".&lt;ref name="COP-16" /&gt;

Countries have to regularly provide a summary of information on how these safeguards are addressed and respected. This could come in the form, for instance, of explaining the legal and regulatory environment with regards to the recognition, inclusion and engagement of Indigenous Peoples, and information on how these requirements have been implemented.

Decision 12/CP.19 established that the "summary of information" on the safeguards will be provided in the National Communications to the UNFCCC, which for developing country Parties will be once every four years. Additionally, and on a voluntary basis, the summary of information may be posted on the UNFCCC REDD+ web platform.&lt;ref name="COP-19" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unfccc.int/methods/redd/redd_web_platform/items/4531.php UNFCCC REDD+ web platform]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Additional issues===

The REDD+ mechanism is currently still under discussion by the UNFCCC. All pertinent issues that comprise REDD+ are exclusively those that are included in the decisions of the COP, as indicated in the above sections. There is, however, a large variety of concepts and approaches that are labelled (as being part of) REDD+ by their proponents, either being a substitute for UNFCCC decisions or complementary to those decisions. Below follows a – no doubt incomplete – list of such concepts and approaches.

* '''Project-based REDD+, voluntary market REDD+'''. As the concept of REDD+ was being defined, many organizations began to promote REDD+ projects at the scale of a forest area (e.g. large concession, National Park), analogous to AR-CDM projects under the [[Kyoto Protocol]], with reduction of emissions or enhancement of removals vetted by an external organization using a standard established by some party (e.g. CCBA, VCS) and with carbon credits traded on the international voluntary carbon market. However, under the UNFCCC REDD+ is defined as national (Decisions 4/CP.15 and 1/CP.16 consistently refer to national strategies and action plans and national monitoring, with sub-national coverage allowed as an interim measure only&lt;ref name="COP-15" /&gt;&lt;ref name="COP-16" /&gt;).
* '''Benefit distribution'''. The UNFCCC decisions on REDD+ are silent on the issue of rewarding countries and participants for their verified net emission reductions or enhanced removals of greenhouse gases. It is not very likely that specific requirements for sub-national implementation of the distribution of benefits will be adopted, as this will be perceived to be an issue of national sovereignty. Generic guidance may be provided, using language similar to that of the safeguards, such as "result-based finance has to accrue to local stakeholders" without being specific on percentages retention for management, identification of stakeholders, type of benefit or means of distribution. Countries may decide to channel any benefits through an existing program on rural development, for instance, provide additional services (e.g. extension, better market access, training, seedlings) or pay local stakeholders directly. Many financial entities do have specific requirement on the design of a system to use funds received, and reporting on the use of these funds.
* '''FPIC'''. [[Free, prior and informed consent]] is included in the U.N. Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. The REDD+ decisions under the UNFCCC do not have this as an explicit requirement;  however, although the safeguard on respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities ''notes'' "that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]]" (UNDRIP).&lt;ref name="COP-16" /&gt; Article 19 of UNDRIP requires that "States shall consult and cooperate in good faith with the indigenous peoples concerned through their own representative institutions in order to obtain their free, prior and informed consent before adopting and implementing legislative or administrative measures that may affect them". This article is interpreted by many organizations engaged in REDD+, for example in the UN-REDD "Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent," to mean that every, or at least many, communities need to provide their consent before any REDD+ activities can take place.&lt;ref name="UNREDD-FPIC"&gt;[http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=8717&amp;Itemid=53 UN-REDD Guidelines on Free, Prior and Informed Consent]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Leakage'''. Leakage is a term that is often used in project-based REDD+. The term originates from Afforestation/Reforestation projects under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol where it is assessed to quantify effects of the project outside of the project area. Leakage is less of an issue when REDD+ is implemented at a national or subnational level, as there can be no domestic leakage once full national coverage is achieved. However, there can still be international leakage if activities are displaced across international borders, or  "displacement of emissions"  between sectors, such as replacing wood fires with kerosene stoves (AFOLU to energy) or construction with wood for construction with concrete, cement and bricks (AFOLU to industry). Many initiatives require leakage be taken into account in program design, so that potential leakage of emissions, including across borders, can be minimized.

== REDD+ as a climate change mitigation measure ==
Deforestation and forest degradation account for 17-29% of global greenhouse gas emissions,&lt;ref name="Fearnside"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Werf"/&gt; the reduction of which is estimated to be one of the most cost-efficient climate change mitigation strategies.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stern Review]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/other/9780108507632/9780108507632.pdf Eliasch Review]&lt;/ref&gt; Regeneration of forest on degraded or deforested lands can remove CO₂ from the atmosphere through the build-up of biomass, making forest lands a [[Greenhouse gas#Removal from the atmosphere ("sinks")|sink of greenhouse gases]]. The REDD+ mechanism addresses both issues of emission reduction and enhanced removal of greenhouse gases.

=== Reducing emissions ===
Emissions of greenhouse gases from forest land can be reduced by slowing down the rates of deforestation and forest degradation, obviously covered by the first two of the REDD+ ''eligible activities''. Another option would be some form of reduced impact logging in commercial logging, under the REDD+ ''eligible activity'' of sustainable management of forests.

=== Enhancing removals ===
Removals of greenhouse gases (specifically CO₂) from the atmosphere can be achieved through various forest management options, such as replanting degraded or deforested areas or enrichment planting, but also by letting forest land regenerate naturally. Care must be taken to differentiate between what is a purely ecological process of regrowth and what is induced or enhanced through some management intervention.

=== REDD+ and the carbon market ===
In 2009, at COP-15 in Copenhagen, the Copenhagen Accord was reached, noting in section 6 the recognition of the crucial role of REDD and REDD+ and the need to provide positive incentives for such actions by enabling the mobilization of financial resources from developed countries. The Accord goes on to note in section 8 that the collective commitment by developed countries for new and additional resources, including forestry and investments through international institutions, will approach USD 30 billion for the period 2010 - 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Copenhagen Accord of 18 December 2009 |pages= |publisher=UNFCC |year= 2009 |url= http://unfccc.int/files/meetings/cop_15/application/pdf/cop15_cph_auv.pdf |accessdate= 2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Green Climate Fund]] (GCF) was established at COP-17 to function as the financial mechanism for the UNFCCC, so including for REDD+ finance. The Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus makes various references to the GCF, instructing developing country Parties to apply to the GCF for ''result-based finance''.&lt;ref name="COP-19"/&gt; The GCF currently finances REDD+ programs in phase 1 (design of national strategies or action plans, capacity building) and phase 2 (implementation of national strategies or action plans, demonstration programs). It is currently finalizing an approach to REDD+ results-based payments.

REDD+ is also eligible for inclusion under CORSIA, the International Civil Aviation Organization's market-based greenhouse gas offset mechanism &lt;http://www.icao.int/environmental-protection/Pages/market-based-measures.aspx&gt;.

== Implementing REDD+ ==
Decision 1/CP.16, paragraph 73, suggests that national capacity for implementing REDD+ is built up in phases, "beginning with the development of national strategies or action plans, policies and measures, and capacity-building, followed by the implementation of national policies and measures and national strategies or action plans that could involve further capacity-building, technology development and transfer and results-based demonstration activities, and evolving into results-based actions that should be fully measured, reported and verified".&lt;ref name="COP-16"/&gt; The initial phase of the development of national strategies and action plans and capacity building is typically referred to as the "Readiness phase" (a term like ''Reddiness'' is also encountered).

There is a very substantial number of REDD+ projects globally and this section lists only a selection. One of the more comprehensive online tools with up-to-date information on REDD+ projects is the [http://reddplusdatabase.org/ Voluntary REDD+ Database].

=== Readiness activities ===
Most REDD+ activities or projects implemented since the call for demonstration activities in Decision 2/CP.13 December 2007&lt;ref name="COP-13" /&gt; are focused on readiness, which is not surprising given that REDD+ and its requirements were completely new to all developing countries.

* '''UN-REDD Programme''' UNDP, UNEP and FAO jointly established the [[UN-REDD Programme]] in 2007, a partnership aimed at assisting developing countries in addressing certain measures needed in order to effectively participate in the REDD+ mechanism. These measures include capacity development, governance, engagement of Indigenous Peoples and technical needs. The initial set of supported countries were Bolivia, Democratic Republic of Congo, Indonesia, Panama, Papua New Guinea, Paraguay, Tanzania, Vietnam, and Zambia. By March 2014 the Programme counted 49 participants, 18 of which are receiving financial support to kick start or complement a variety of national REDD+ readiness activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un-redd.org/Partner_Countries/tabid/102663/Default.aspx |title=UN-REDD Programme - Support to Partner Countries |publisher=Un-redd.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214223120/http://www.un-redd.org/Partner_Countries/tabid/102663/Default.aspx |archivedate=14 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The other 31 ''partner countries'' may receive ''targeted support'' and ''knowledge sharing'', be invited to attend meetings and training workshops, have ''observer status'' at the Policy Board meetings, and "may be invited to submit a request to receive funding for a National Programme in the future, if selected through a set of criteria to prioritize funding for new countries approved by the Policy Board".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.un-redd.org/AboutUNREDDProgramme/NationalProgrammes/Partner_Countries/tabid/4648/language/en-US/Default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219205547/http://www.un-redd.org/AboutUNREDDProgramme/NationalProgrammes/Partner_Countries/tabid/4648/language/en-US/Default.aspx |archivedate=19 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Programme operates in six work areas:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unredd.net/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_download&amp;gid=4598&amp;Itemid=53 UN-REDD Programme Strategy 2011-2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Forest Carbon Partnership Facility''' The World Bank plays an important role in the development of REDD+ activities since its inception. The [[Forest Carbon Partnership Facility]] (FCPF) was presented to the international community at COP-13 in Bali, December 2007. Recipient countries can apply $3.6 million towards: the development of national strategies; stakeholder consultation; capacity building; development of reference levels; development of a national forest monitoring system; and social and environmental safeguards analysis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/fcp/sites/forestcarbonpartnership.org/files/Documents/PDF/Apr2012/FCPF%20UNREDD%20R-PP%20Template%20Version%206%20-%20April%2020%2C%202012-FINAL.docx FCPF] template to apply for funding.&lt;/ref&gt; Those countries that successfully achieve a state of readiness can apply to the related Carbon Fund, for support towards national implementation of REDD+.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.forestcarbonpartnership.org/carbon-fund FCPF Carbon Fund] As the first country to apply for funding under the FCPF Carbon Fund, Costa Rica submitted its revised ''ER-PIN'' on 15 February 2013. Apparently only five submissions are currently envisaged.&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Norwegian International Climate and Forest Initiative''' At the 2007 Bali Conference, the Norwegian government announced their International Climate and Forests Initiative (NICFI), which provided US$1 billion towards the Brazilian REDD scheme&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amazonfund.gov.br Amazon Fund website]&lt;/ref&gt; and US$500 million towards the creation and implementation of national-based, REDD+ activities in Tanzania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= The Government of Norway’s International Climate and Forest Initiative |pages=  |publisher= Ministry of Environment |date= May 19, 2009 |url= http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/md/Selected-topics/climate/the-government-of-norways-international-/why-a-climate-and-forest-initiative.html?id=54720/ |accessdate= 2009-11-23 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121010121331/http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/md/Selected-topics/climate/the-government-of-norways-international-/why-a-climate-and-forest-initiative.html?id=54720%2F |archivedate= 10 October 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, with the United Kingdom, $200 million was contributed towards the Congo Basin Forest Fund to aid forest conservation activities in Central Africa.&lt;ref name="Saving Rainforest"&gt;{{cite news |last= Butler |first= Rhett |title=Are We on The Brink of Saving Rainforests? |pages= |publisher= |date= July 22, 2009 |url= http://news.mongabay.com/2009/0722-redd.html |accessdate= 2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Norway signed a Letter of Intent with Indonesia to provide the latter country with up to US$1 billion "assuming that Indonesia achieves good results".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.regjeringen.no/en/dep/kld/kampanjer/the-governments-climate-and-tree-project/who-are-our-collaboration-partners/-indonesia.html?id=734165]&lt;/ref&gt;
*"United States" The United States has provided more than $1.5 billion in support for REDD+ and other sustainable landscape activities since 2010. It supports several multilateral partnerships including the FCPF, as well as flagship global programs such as SilvaCarbon, which provides support to REDD+ countries in measuring and monitoring forests and forest-related emissions. The United States also provides significant regional and bilateral support to numerous countries implementing REDD+. 
* '''ITTO''' The [[International Tropical Timber Organization]] (ITTO) has launched a thematic program on REDD+ and environmental services with an initial funding of US$3.5 million from Norway. In addition, the 45th session of the ITTO Council held in November 2009, recommended that efforts relating REDD+ should focus on promoting "sustainable forest management".{{Citation needed|date=March 2014}}
* '''Finland''' In 2009, the Government of Finland and the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations signed a US$17 million partnership agreement to provide tools and methods for multi-purpose forest inventories, REDD+ monitoring and climate change adaptation in five pilot countries: Ecuador, Peru, Tanzania, Viet Nam and Zambia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/forestry/nfma/77232/en/ |title=Support to forest monitoring and assessment |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this programme, the Government of Tanzania will soon complete the country's first comprehensive forest inventory to assess its forest resources including the size of the carbon stock stored within its forests. A forest [[soil carbon]] monitoring program to estimate soil carbon stock, using both survey and modelling-based methods, has also been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/015/i2793e/i2793e00.htm |title=Soil carbon monitoring using surveys and modelling |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Australia''' Australia established a A$200 million International Forest Carbon Initiative, focused on developing REDD+ activities in its vicinity, i.e., in areas like Indonesia, and Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Reducing Emission from Deforestation and Forest Degradation in Developing Countries |pages= |publisher=UNFCC |date=  |url= http://unfccc.int/files/kyoto_protocol/application/pdf/australia_lca_redd.pdf |accessdate= 2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Interim REDD+ Partnership''' In 2010, national governments of developing and developed countries joined efforts to create the Interim REDD+ Partnership as means to enhance implementation of early action and foster fast start finance for REDD+ actions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reddpluspartnership.org |title=REDD+ Partnership website |publisher=Reddpluspartnership.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation phase ===
Some countries are already implementing aspects of a national forest monitoring system and activities aimed at reducing emissions and enhancing removals that go beyond REDD+ readiness. For example, the Forest Carbon Partnership Facility has 19 countries in the pipeline of the Carbon Fund, which will provide payments to these countries based on verified REDD+ emissions reductions achieved under national or subnational programs. The first countries will begin to negotiate contracts for these payments, and begin implementation of their programs, in 2017.

=== Results-based actions ===
Following the Warsaw Framework on REDD-plus,  the first country had submitted a Biennial Update Report with a Technical Annex containing the details on emission reductions from REDD+ eligible activities. Brazil submitted its first Biennial Update Report on 31 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/natc/brbur1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Technical Annex covers the [[Amazon biome]] within Brazil's territory, a little under half of the national territory, reporting emission reductions against Brazil's previously submitted reference emission level of 2,971.02 MtCO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;e from a reduction in deforestation. This Technical Annex was reviewed through the International Consultation and Analysis process and on 22 September 2015 a technical report was issued by the UNFCCC which states that "the LULUCF experts consider that the data and information provided in the technical annex are transparent, consistent, complete and accurate" (paragraph 38).&lt;ref&gt;http://unfccc.int/resource/docs/2015/tatr/eng/bra.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Considering that Brazil is only reporting on emission reductions from deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon, the technical review identified several areas of improvement (paragraph 34):

&lt;blockquote&gt;(a) Continuation in updating and improving the carbon density map, including through the use of improved ground data from Brazil’s first national forest inventory, possibly prioritizing geographic areas where deforestation is more likely to occur;

(b) Expansion of the coverage of carbon pools, including improving the understanding of soil carbon dynamics after the conversion of forests to non-forests;

(c) Consideration of the treatment of non-CO2 gases to maintain consistency with the GHG inventory;

(d) Continuation of the improvements related to monitoring of forest degradation;

(e) Expansion of the forest monitoring system to cover additional biomes.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Several additional countries have followed closely behind Brazil.

== Concerns ==
Since the first discussion on REDD+ in 2005 and particularly at COP-13 in 2007 and COP-15 in 2009, many concerns have been voiced on various aspects of REDD+. The COP has responded by establishing the safeguards for REDD+, although these are sometimes criticized for being too generic, non-enforceable and summary rather than a specific set of requirements for participation in the REDD+ mechanism.

Prior to full-scale implementation many challenges are still to be solved. How will the REDD+ approach link to existing national development strategies? How will forest communities and indigenous peoples participate in the design, implementation, monitoring and evaluation of national REDD+ programmes? How will REDD+ be funded, and how will countries ensure that benefits are distributed equitably among all those who manage the forests? Finally, how will the amounts of reduced emissions and enhanced removals as a result of REDD+ activities be monitored?

=== Natural forests vs. high-density plantations ===
''Safeguard (e): That actions are consistent with the conservation of natural forests and biological diversity, ensuring that the [REDD+] actions (...) are not used for the conversion of natural forests, but are instead used to incentivize the protection and conservation of natural forests and their ecosystem services, and to enhance other social and environmental benefits. Footnote to this safeguard: Taking into account the need for sustainable livelihoods of indigenous peoples and local communities and their interdependence on forests in most countries, reflected in the [[United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples]], as well as the International [[Pachamama|Mother Earth]] Day.''

The UNFCCC does not define what constitutes a forest; it only requires that Parties communicate to the UNFCCC on how they define a forest.  The UNFCCC does suggest using a definition in terms of minimal area, minimal crown coverage and minimal height at maturity of perennial vegetation.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

While there is a safeguard against the conversion of natural forest, developing country Parties are free to include plantations of commercial tree species (including exotics like [[Eucalyptus]] spp., [[Pinus]] spp., [[Acacia]] spp.), agricultural tree crops (e.g. [[Hevea brasiliensis|rubber]], [[mango]], [[Theobroma cacao|cocoa]], [[citrus]]), or even non-tree species such as palms ([[Elaeis guineensis|oil palm]], [[coconut]], [[Date palm|dates]]) and [[bamboo]] (a grass). Some opponents of REDD+ argue that this lack of a clear distinction is no accident. Defining a forest simply in terms of tree cover - rather than complex ecosystems and the livelihoods of peoples interacting with them – has long been used as a cover for the expansion of industrial-scale plantations. The most plausible explanation, arguably, is that commercial interests take precedence over environmental and social objectives in the shaping of REDD+ policy.

Similarly, there is no consensus on a definition for forest degradation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thinktosustain.com/ContentPageViewPoint.aspx?id=%20875 |title=CDM Carbon Sink Tree Plantations: Insights into Sustainability Issues |publisher=Thinktosustain.com |date=2011-05-20 |accessdate=2013-12-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117090231/http://thinktosustain.com/ContentPageViewPoint.aspx?id=%20875 |archivedate=17 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The IPCC has come up with a number of suggestions, again leaving countries the option to select that definition which is most convenient.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}}

A national REDD+ strategy need not refer solely to the establishment of national parks or protected areas; by the careful design of rules and guidelines, REDD+ could include land use practices such as shifting cultivation by indigenous communities and reduced-impact-logging, provided sustainable rotation and harvesting cycles can be demonstrated.&lt;ref&gt;Mathai, J. (5 October 2009). "Seeing REDD over deforestation". {{cite web |url=http://www.peat-portal.net/newsmaster.cfm?&amp;menuid=38&amp;action=view&amp;retrieveid=1060 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-10-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120113100528/http://www.peat-portal.net/newsmaster.cfm?&amp;menuid=38&amp;action=view&amp;retrieveid=1060 |archivedate=13 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that this is opening the door to logging operations in primary forests, displacement of local populations for "conservation", increase of tree plantations.

Achieving multiple benefits, for example the conservation of [[biodiversity]] and [[ecosystem services]] (such as [[drainage basin]]s), and social benefits (for example income and improved forest governance) is currently not addressed, beyond the inclusion in the safeguard.

=== Land tenure, carbon rights and benefit distribution ===

According to some critics, REDD+ is another extension of [[eco-capitalism|green capitalism]], subjecting the forests and its inhabitants to new ways of expropriation and enclosure at the hands of polluting companies and market speculators.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} So-called "carbon cowboys" - unscrupulous entrepreneurs who attempt to acquire rights to carbon in rainforest  for small-scale projects- have signed on indigenous communities to unfair contracts, often with a view to on-selling the rights to investors for a quick profit. In 2012 an Australian businessman operating in Peru was revealed to have signed 200-year contracts with an Amazon tribe, the Yagua, many members of which are illiterate, giving him a 50 per cent share in their carbon resources.  The contracts allow him to establish and control timber projects and palm oil plantations in Yagua rainforest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/stories/8495029/the-carbon-cowboy |title=The Carbon Cowboy |author1=Stephen Rice |author2=Liam Bartlett |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=60 Minutes, Nine Network Australia |date=6 July 2012 |accessdate=2012-11-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121113114554/http://sixtyminutes.ninemsn.com.au/stories/8495029/the-carbon-cowboy |archivedate=13 November 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This risk is largely negated by the focus on national and subnational REDD+ programs, and by government ownership of these initiatives.

There are risks that the local inhabitants and the communities that live in the forests will be bypassed and that they won't be consulted and so they won't actually receive any revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forestpeoples.org/sites/fpp/files/publication/2011/11/reality-redd-peru-between-theory-and-practice-website-english-low-res.pdf |title=The reality of REDD+ in Peru: Between theory and practice - Indigenous Amazonian Peoples’ analyses and alternatives |author1=Espinoza Llanos, Roberto  |author2=Feather, Conrad  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher= AIDESEP and Forest Peoples Programme |date=Nov 2011 |work= |accessdate=2009-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fair distribution of REDD+ benefits will not be achieved without a ''prior'' reform in forest governance and more secure tenure systems in many countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.recoftc.org/site/fileadmin/docs/Events/Features/article_on_APFW_REDD_short__3_.pdf |title=REDD:  a Steep learning Curve |author=Vickers, Ben |publisher=Asia-Pacific Forestry Week |date=Apr 2008 |work= |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091229141447/http://www.recoftc.org/site/fileadmin/docs/Events/Features/article_on_APFW_REDD_short__3_.pdf |archivedate=29 December 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; So how can the benefits from REDD+ be distributed to forest communities in a just, equitable way that minimizes capture of the benefits by national governments or local elites?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Making REDD Work for the Poor |first=Leo |last=Peskett |author2=Huberman, david |author3=Bowen-Jones, evan |author4=Edwards, guy |author5=Brown, jessica |url=http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/indexAction.cfm?module=Library&amp;action=GetFile&amp;DocumentAttachmentID=249 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120730110137/http://www.energyandenvironment.undp.org/undp/indexAction.cfm?module=Library&amp;action=GetFile&amp;DocumentAttachmentID=249 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-07-30 |format=PDF |agency=Poverty Environment Partnership |date=Sep 2008 |accessdate=2009-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The UNFCCC has repeatedly called for ''full and effective participation of Indigenous Peoples and local communities'' without becoming any more specific. The ability of local communities to effectively contribute to REDD+ field activities and the measurement of forest properties for estimating reduced emissions and enhanced emissions of greenhouse gases has been clearly demonstrated in various countries.&lt;ref name="KTGAL"&gt;In a multi-year research project the engagement of local communities in REDD+ field activity implementation in 7 developing countries was studied and found to be highly effective. See multiple papers at [http://www.communitycarbonforestry.org/] under the Resources &amp; Publications link on the left.&lt;/ref&gt;

In project-based REDD+, some projects are unaccountable and dodgy companies have taken advantage of the low governance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/01/3054102.htm?section=justin |title=Carbon offsetting scheme open to corruption, report warns |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2010-11-01 |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenous peoples ===
''Safeguard (c): Respect for the knowledge and rights of indigenous peoples and members of local communities, by taking into account relevant international obligations, national circumstances and laws, and noting that the United Nations General Assembly has adopted the United Nations Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples;''
''Safeguard (d): The full and effective participation of relevant stakeholders, in particular indigenous peoples and local communities, in the [REDD+] actions (...) [and when developing and implementing national strategies or action plans];''

[[Indigenous peoples]] are important stakeholders in REDD+ as they typically live inside forest areas or have their livelihoods (partially) based on exploitation of forest resources. The [[International Indigenous Peoples Forum on Climate Change]] (IIPFCC) was explicit at the Bali climate negotiations in 2007:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''REDD/REDD+ will not benefit Indigenous Peoples, but in fact will result in more violations of Indigenous Peoples’ rights. It will increase the violation of our human rights, our rights to our lands, territories and resources, steal our land, cause forced evictions, prevent access and threaten indigenous agricultural practices, destroy biodiversity and cultural diversity and cause social conflicts. Under REDD/REDD+, states and carbon traders will take more control over our forests.''&lt;ref name=no /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Some claim putting a commercial value on forests neglects the spiritual value they hold for Indigenous Peoples and local communities.&lt;ref name="Policies"/&gt;

Indigenous Peoples protested in 2008 against the [[United Nations Permanent Forum on Indigenous Issues]] final report on climate change and a paragraph that endorsed REDD+; this was captured in a video entitled "the 2nd May Revolt".{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.carbontradewatch.org/video/protest-indigenous-peoples-2nd-may-revolt-at-the-unpfii-4.html|title=PROTEST: Indigenous Peoples "2nd MAY REVOLT" at the UNPFII - carbon trade watch|last=Administrator|website=www.carbontradewatch.org|access-date=2017-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these protests have largely disappeared in recent years. Indigenous people sit as permanent representatives on many multinational and national REDD+ bodies, though there is always room for improvement.

[[Indigenous peoples and the UN-REDD Program in Panama|Indigenous Peoples' groups in Panama broke off their collaboration with the national UN-REDD Programme]] in 2012 over allegations of a failure of the government to properly respect the rights of the indigenous groups.

Some grassroots organizations are working to develop REDD+ activities with communities and developing benefit-sharing mechanisms to ensure REDD+ funds reach rural communities as well as governments. Examples of these include Plan Vivo projects in Mexico, Mozambique and Cameroon; and [[Carbonfund.org]] Foundation's VCS and CCBS projects in the state of Acre, Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.planvivo.org |title=Plan Vivo " Improving livelihoods, conserving and restoring ecosystems |publisher=Planvivo.org |date= |accessdate=2013-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== REDD+ in the carbon market ===
When REDD+ was first discussed by the UNFCCC, no indication was given of the positive incentives that would support developing countries in their efforts to implement REDD+ to reduce emissions and enhance removals of greenhouse gases from forests. In the absence of guidance from the COP, two options were debated by the international community at large:
# a market-based approach;
# a fund-based approach where Annex I countries would deposit substantial amounts of money into a fund administered by some multi-lateral entity.

Under the market-based approach, REDD+ would act as an "offset scheme" in which verified results-based actions translate into some form of carbon credits, more-or-less analogous to the market for [[Certified Emission Reduction]]s (CER) under the CDM of the Kyoto Protocol. Such carbon credits could then offset emissions in the country or company of the buyer of the carbon credits. This would require Annex I countries to agree to deeper cuts in emissions of greenhouse gases in order to create a market for the carbon credits from REDD+, which is unlikely to happen soon given the current state of negotiations in the COP, but even then there is the fear that the market will be flooded with carbon credits, depressing the price to levels where REDD+ is no longer an economically viable option.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0305-carbon.html |title=Why Europe Torpedoed the REDD Forest-For-Carbon Credits Initiative |author=Butler, Rhett |publisher= |date=Mar 5, 2008 |work= |accessdate=2009-11-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713130047/http://news.mongabay.com/2008/0305-carbon.html |archivedate=13 July 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Karsenty |first= Alain |title= What the (carbon) market cannot do... |pages=  |publisher= CIRAD |date= Nov 2009 |url= http://www.rightsandresources.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=1374 |accessdate= 2012-02-15 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20121028122728/http://www.rightsandresources.org/publication_details.php?publicationID=1374 |archivedate= 28 October 2012 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some developing countries, such as Brazil and China, maintain that developed countries must commit to real emissions reductions, independent of any offset mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = von der Goltz | first = Jan | title = High Stakes in a Complex Game: A Snapshot of the Climate Change Negotiating Positions of Major Developing Country Emitters | publisher = [[Center for Global Development]]| date = August 10, 2009 | url = http://www.cgdev.org/files/1422602_file_High_Stakes_FINAL081009.pdf | accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since COP-17, however, it has become clear that the REDD+ may be financed by a variety of sources, market and non-market. The newly established [[Green Climate Fund]] already is supporting phase 1 and 2 REDD+ programs, and is finalizing rules to allow disbursement of result-based finance to developing countries that submit verified reports of emission reductions and enhanced removals of greenhouse gases.&lt;ref name="COP-17"/&gt;&lt;ref name="COP-19"/&gt;

=== Top-down design by large international institutions vs. bottom-up grassroots coalitions===
While the COP decisions emphasize national ownership and stakeholder consultation, there are concerns that some of the larger institutional organizations are driving the process, in particular outside of the ''one Party, one vote'' realm of multi-lateral negotiations under the UNFCCC. For example, the World Bank and the UN-REDD Programme, the two largest sources of funding and technical assistance for readiness activities and therefore unavoidable for most developing countries, place requirements upon recipient countries that are arguably not mandated or required by the COP decisions. A body of research suggests that, at least as of 2016, REDD+ as a global architecture has only had a limited effect on local political realities, as pre-existing entrenched power dynamics and incentives that promote deforestation are not easily changed by the relatively small sums of money that REDD+ has delivered to date. In addition, issues like land tenure that fundamentally determine who makes decisions about land use and deforestation have not been adequately addressed by REDD+, and there is no clear consensus on how complex political issues like land tenure can be easily resolved to favor standing forests over cleared forests through a relatively top-down mechanism like REDD+.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecommonsjournal.org/articles/10.18352/ijc.593/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0959378010001111 | doi=10.1016/j.gloenvcha.2010.11.008 | volume=21 | title=Forest tenure reform in the age of climate change: Lessons for REDD+ | journal=Global Environmental Change | pages=540–549}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/BAngelsen120105.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X13000193 | doi=10.1016/j.worlddev.2013.01.013 | volume=55 | title=How are REDD+ Proponents Addressing Tenure Problems?

While a single, harmonized, global system that accounts for and rewards emissions reductions from forests and land use has been elusive, diverse context-specific projects have emerged that support a variety of activities including community-based forest management, enforcement of protected areas, sustainable charcoal production, and agroforestry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/OccPapers/OP-104.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Although it is not clear whether these diverse projects are genuinely different from older integrated conservation and development initiatives that pre-date REDD+, there is evidence that REDD+ has altered global policy conversations, possibly elevating issues like indigenous peoples' land rights to higher levels, or conversely threatening to bypass safeguards for indigenous rights. Debate surrounding these issues is ongoing.&lt;ref name="cifor.org"&gt;http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/Books/BAngelsen120117.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10745-012-9527-y#/page-1 | doi=10.1007/s10745-012-9527-y | volume=40 | title=REDD Policy Impacts on Indigenous Property Rights Regimes on Palawan Island, the Philippines | journal=Human Ecology | pages=679–691}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mdpi.com/1999-4907/5/9/2136/htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the World Bank declares its commitment to fight against climate change, many civil society organisations and grassroots movements around the world view with scepticism the processes being developed under the various carbon funds.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} Among some of the most worrying reasons are the weak (or inexistent) consultation processes with local communities; the lack of criteria to determine when a country is ready to implement REDD+ projects (readiness); the negative impacts such as deforestation and [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] (due to fast agreements and lack of planning); the lack of safeguards to protect Indigenous Peoples' rights; and the lack of regional policies to stop deforestation. A growing coalition of civil society organization, social movement, and other actors critical of REDD+ emerged between 2008 and 2011, criticizing the mechanism on climate justice grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=den Besten |first=Jan Willem |last2=Arts |first2=Bas |last3=Verkooijen |first3=Patrick |date=2014 |title=The evolution of REDD+: an analysis of discursive-institutional dynamics |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1462901113000671 |journal=Environmental Science &amp; Policy |volume=35 |pages=40–48 |doi= 10.1016/j.envsci.2013.03.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the UN climate negotiations in Copenhagen (2009) and Cancun (2010) strong civil society and social movements coalitions formed a strong front to fight the World Bank out of the climate.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} However, this concern has largely died down as the World Bank initiatives have been more full developed, and some of these same actors are now participating in implementation of REDD+.

ITTO has been criticized for appearing to support above all the inclusion of forest extraction inside REDD+ under the guise of "sustainable management" in order to benefit from carbon markets while maintaining business-as-usual.&lt;ref name=no&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ienearth.org/docs/No-Redd-Papers.pdf |title=No Redd! |publisher=Noredd.makenoise.org |date=November 2011|accessdate=2014-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="31061">'''Reserve army of labour''' is a concept in [[Karl Marx]]'s critique of [[political economy]].&lt;ref&gt;Francis Green, "The Reserve Army Hypothesis: A Survey of Empirical Applications," in Paul Dunne (ed.), ''Quantitative Marxism'', Cambridge: Polity Press, 1991, pp. 123-140.&lt;/ref&gt; It refers to the [[unemployed]] and [[Underemployment|underemployed]] in [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist society]]. It is synonymous with "industrial reserve army" or "relative surplus population", except that the unemployed can be defined as those actually looking for work and that the relative surplus population also includes people unable to work. The use of the word "army" refers to the workers being conscripted and regimented in the workplace in a [[hierarchy]] under the [[Commanding heights of the economy|command]] or authority of the owners of [[Capital (economics)|capital]]. {{Marxism}}

Marx did not invent the term "reserve army of labour". It was already being used by [[Friedrich Engels]] in his 1845 book ''[[The Condition of the Working Class in England]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Roman Rosdolsky |first=Roman |last=Rosdolsky |title=The Making of Marx's Capital |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |year=1977 |isbn=0-904383-37-7 |at=chapter 18, p. 250 note 19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; What Marx did was theorize the reserve army of labour as a necessary part of the capitalist organization of work.

Prior to what Marx regarded as the start of the capitalist era in human history (i.e. before the 16th century), [[structural unemployment]] on a mass scale rarely existed, other than that caused by natural disasters and wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=John A. |last=Garraty |title=Unemployment in History: Economic Thought and Public Policy |location=New York |publisher=Harper and Row |year=1978 |isbn=0-06-011457-6 }}, chapter 2.&lt;/ref&gt; In ancient societies, all people who could work necessarily had to work, otherwise they would starve; and a slave or a serf by definition could not become "unemployed". There was normally very little possibility of "earning a crust" without working at all, and the usual attitude toward beggars and idlers was harsh.&lt;ref&gt;Garraty, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; Children began to work already at a very early age.

== Marx's discussion of the concept ==
Although the idea of the industrial reserve army of labour is closely associated with Marx, it was already in circulation in the British labour movement by the 1830s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=Michael |last=Denning |year=2010 |title=Wageless life |journal=New Left Review |volume=66 |issue= |pages=79–97 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Engels discussed the reserve army of labour before Marx did in Engels's famous book ''The Condition of the Working Class in England'' (1845). The first mention of the reserve army of labour in Marx's writing occurs in a manuscript he wrote in 1847, but did not publish: 

{{quote|Big industry constantly requires a reserve army of unemployed workers for times of [[overproduction]]. The main purpose of the bourgeois in relation to the worker is, of course, to have the commodity labour as cheaply as possible, which is only possible when the supply of this commodity is as large as possible in relation to the demand for it, i.e., when the overpopulation is the greatest. Overpopulation is therefore in the interest of the bourgeoisie, and it gives the workers good advice which it knows to be impossible to carry out. Since capital only increases when it employs workers, the increase of capital involves an increase of the proletariat, and, as we have seen, according to the nature of the relation of capital and labour, the increase of the proletariat must proceed relatively even faster. The above theory, however, which is also expressed as a law of nature, that population grows faster than the means of subsistence, is the more welcome to the bourgeois as it silences his conscience, makes hard-heartedness into a moral duty and the consequences of society into the consequences of nature, and finally gives him the opportunity to watch the destruction of the proletariat by starvation as calmly as any other natural event without bestirring himself, and, on the other hand, to regard the misery of the proletariat as its own fault and to punish it. To be sure, the proletarian can restrain his natural instinct by reason, and so, by moral supervision, halt the law of nature in its injurious course of development.|Karl Marx, ''[[Wage Labour and Capital]]'', December 1847&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.marxistsfr.org/archive/marx/works/1847/12/31.htm "Wages"], Works of Karl Marx 1847; Source: MECW Volume 6, p. 415; Written: at the end of December 1847; First published: in Russian in the journal Sotsialisticheskoye khozyaistvo, 1924 and in German in the journal Unter dem Banner des Marxismus, 1925.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The idea of the labour force as an "army" occurs also in Part 1 of ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', written by Marx and Engels in 1848: 

{{quote|Modern Industry has converted the little workshop of the patriarchal master into the great factory of the industrial capitalist. Masses of labourers, crowded into the factory, are organised like soldiers. As privates of the industrial army they are placed under the command of a perfect hierarchy of officers and sergeants. Not only are they slaves of the bourgeois class, and of the bourgeois State; they are daily and hourly enslaved by the machine, by the overlooker, and, above all, by the individual bourgeois manufacturer himself. The more openly this despotism proclaims gain to be its end and aim, the more petty, the more hateful and the more embittering it is.}}

Marx introduces the concept of the reserve army of labour in chapter 25 of the first volume of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1867-c1/ch25.htm#S2 Karl Marx, ''Das Kapital'', chapter 25]&lt;/ref&gt; twenty years later in 1867, stating the following: 

{{quote|[...] capitalistic accumulation itself [...] constantly produces, and produces in the direct ratio of its own energy and extent, a relatively redundant population of workers, i.e., a population of greater extent than suffices for the average needs of the [[valorisation]] of capital, and therefore a surplus-population... It is the absolute interest of every capitalist to press a given quantity of labour out of a smaller, rather than a greater number of labourers, if the cost is about the same. [...] The more extended the scale of production, the stronger this motive. Its force increases with the accumulation of capital.}}

His argument is that as [[capitalism]] develops, the [[organic composition of capital]] will increase, which means that the mass of [[constant capital]] grows faster than the mass of [[variable capital]]. Fewer workers can produce all that is necessary for society's requirements. In addition, capital will become more concentrated and centralized in fewer hands.

This being the absolute historical tendency, part of the working population will tend to become surplus to the requirements of [[capital accumulation]] over time. Paradoxically, the larger the wealth of society, the larger the industrial reserve army will become. One could add that the larger the wealth of society, the more people it can also support who do not work.

However, as Marx develops the argument further it also becomes clear that depending on the state of the economy, the reserve army of labour will either expand or contract, alternately being absorbed or expelled from the employed workforce: 

{{quote|Taking them as a whole, the general movements of [[wages]] are exclusively regulated by the expansion and contraction of the industrial reserve army, and these again correspond to the periodic changes of the industrial cycle. They are, therefore, not determined by the variations of the absolute number of the working population, but by the varying proportions in which the working-class is divided into active and reserve army, by the increase or diminution in the relative amount of the surplus-population, by the extent to which it is now absorbed, now set free.}}

Marx concludes as such: "Relative surplus-population is therefore the pivot upon which the law of demand and supply of labour works". The availability of labour influences wage rates and the larger the unemployed workforce grows, the more this forces down wage rates; conversely, if there are plenty jobs available and unemployment is low, this tends to raise the average level of wages—in that case workers are able to change jobs rapidly to get better pay.

== Composition of the relative surplus population ==
Marx discusses the army of labor and the reserve army in ''Capital'', Chapter 14, Counteracting Factors, Section IV.  The army of labor consists in those [[working class]] people employed in average or better than average jobs. Not every one in the working class gets one of these jobs. There are then four other categories where members of the working class might find themselves: the stagnant pool, the floating reserves, the latent reserve and pauperdom. Finally, people may leave the army and the reserve army by turning to criminality, Marx refers to such people as [[lumpenproletariat]].&lt;ref&gt;Duggan, Marie Christine (2013) "Reserve Army of Labor and Migration" in the Encyclopedia of Global Human Migration, edited by E. Ness, Wiley Publishers.http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9781444351071.wbeghm451/abstract&lt;/ref&gt;
* The stagnant part consists of marginalised people with "extremely irregular employment". Stagnant pool jobs are characterized by below average pay, dangerous working conditions and they may be temporary. Those caught in the stagnant pool have jobs, so the modern definition of the employed would include both the army of labor plus the stagnant pool. However, they are constantly on the lookout for something better.
* The modern unemployed would refer primarily to the floating reserve, people who used to have good jobs, but are now out of work. They certainly hope that their unemployment is temporary ("conjunctural unemployment"), but they are well aware that they could fall into the stagnant pool or the pauper class.
* The latent part consists of that segment of the population not yet fully integrated into capitalist production. In Marx's day, he was referring to people living off of subsistence agriculture who were looking for monetary employment in industry. In modern times, people coming from slums in developing countries where they survive largely by non-monetary means, to developed cities where they work for pay might form the latent.{{Clarification needed|date=October 2018}} Housewives who move from unpaid to paid employment for a business could also form a part of the latent reserve. They are not unemployed because they are not necessarily actively looking for a job, but if capital needs extra workers, it can pull them out of the latent reserve. In this sense, the latent forms a reservoir of potential workers for industries.
* Pauperdom is where one might end up. The homeless is the modern term for paupers. Marx calls them people who cannot adapt to capital's never ending change. For Marx, "the sphere of pauperism", including those still able to work, orphans and pauper children and the "demoralised and ragged" or "unable to work".

Marx then analyses the reserve army of labour in detail using data on [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|Britain]] where he lived.

== Controversies and criticism ==
{{synthesis|date=February 2016}}

=== Economist criticisms ===
Some economicists such as Paul Samuelson have taken issue with Marx's concept of the reserve army of labour. Samuelson argues that much Marxian literature assumes that the ''mere existence'' of the unemployed drives down wages, when in reality is dependent upon contingent factors (Are the unemployed easily available as replacements? Is the mere threat of replacement sufficient to get workers to accept a wage cut or does the employer have to demonstrate this is not an empty threat?). Samuelson argues that if prices also fall with money wage, then this does not mean real wages will fall. Samuelson also argues that wages will only fall until there are no more unemployed to bid it down - the reserve army can only reduce wages by decreasing its size. In Samuelson's conclusion, this means that while the unemployed can reduce wages, they are incapable of reducing them to anywhere near subsistence levels before the unemployed all become employed.&lt;ref&gt;Samuelson, Paul [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=oi-yoPkdKXkC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;lpg=PA366&amp;dq=reserve+army+of+labour+paul+samuelson&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=BvXt9xQHkV&amp;sig=CvGrBi1AJ4724Q-3ZqnelsKcbYM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjh066N3OjZAhWIDMAKHfzSCiU4ChDoAQg3MAI#v=onepage&amp;q=reserve%20army%20of%20labour%20paul%20samuelson&amp;f=false "The Collected Scientific Papers of Paul Samuelson, Volume 1"] MIT Press, 1996, pp.365-368&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar argument was made by Murray Rothbard, who argued that if the reserve army lower wages by being absorbed into the ranks of the employed, then eventually it will disappear and be incapable of being a threat (this also means that the risk of perpetual impoverishment is averted). Rothbard observes that this is supported by modern market economics, which holds that unemployment lowers wages and thus ultimately eliminates itself. Thus Rothbard concludes that the reserve army would ultimately cease to be a threat. Rothbard also argues that industries can experience an increase in demand for other works thanks to increasing productivity caused by technology, which will then decrease unemployment due to a greater demand for workers caused by expanding production capability.&lt;ref&gt;Rothbard, Murray, ''An Austrian Perspective on the History of Economic Thought: Classical economics'', Ludwig von Mises Institute, 2006, pp.424-425&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Immiseration ===
Some writers have interpreted Marx's argument to mean that an absolute immiseration of the working class would occur as the broad historical trend. Thus, the workers would become more and more impoverished and unemployment would constantly grow.&lt;ref&gt;[[Thomas Sowell]], "Marx's 'increasing misery' doctrine", ''American Economic Review'', L, No. 1, March 1960, pp. 111-120.[[Thomas Sowell]], ''Marxism: philosophy and economics''. London: George Allen &amp; Unwin, 1985, chapter 10.&lt;/ref&gt; This is no longer credible in the light of the facts because in various epochs and countries workers' living standards have indeed improved rather than declined. In some periods, unemployment had been reduced to a very small amount. In the [[Great Depression]], about one in four workers became unemployed, but towards the end of the [[post-war boom]] unemployment in richer countries reduced to a very low level. However, economic historian [[Paul Bairoch]] estimated in the mid-1980s that in Latin America, Africa and Asia "total inactivity" among the population was "on the order of 30-40% of potential working man-hours"—a situation without historical precedent, "except perhaps in the case of ancient Rome".&lt;ref&gt;Paul Bairoch, ''Cities and Economic Development. From the Dawn of History to the Present''. London: Mansell, 1988, p. 466.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other writers, such as [[Ernest Mandel]] and [[Roman Rozdolsky]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=E. Germain [pseud. Ernest Mandel] |title=Gibt es eine Marx'sche Verelendungstheorie? |journal=Die Internationale : theoretisches Organ des revolutionären Marxismus |location=Vienna |issn=0535-4005 |volume=3 |date=February 1957 |pages=25–35 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Roman Rosdolsky |first=Roman |last=Rosdolsky |title=The Making of Marx's Capital |publisher=Pluto Press |location=London |year=1977 |isbn=0-904383-37-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that in truth Marx had no theory of an absolute immiseration of the working class; at most, one could say that the rich-poor gap continues to grow, i.e. the wealthy get wealthier much more than ordinary workers improve their living standards. In part, the level of unemployment also seems to be based on the balance of power between [[social classes]] and state policy. Governments can allow unemployment to rise, but also implement job-creating policies, which makes unemployment levels partly a political result.

If chapter 25 of Marx's ''[[Capital, Volume I]]'' is read carefully, it is plain that Marx does not actually say what many critics accuse him of.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph M. Gillman, ''The falling rate of profit''. London: Dobson, 1957, pp. 146-147.&lt;/ref&gt; Marx himself says that the "absolute general law of capitalist accumulation" is that the more that capital grows in size and value, the bigger the working class becomes and the larger the pauperized sections of the working class and the industrial reserve army become.&lt;ref name="Capital-1-798"&gt;''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Penguin ed., p. 798.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he does not say that the whole working class becomes pauperized, but rather that the part of it which is pauperized grows in size. He then carefully qualifies this argument by saying that the absolute general law is "like all other laws [...] modified in its working by many circumstances".&lt;ref name="Capital-1-798" /&gt; Next, Marx says that in proportion as capital accumulates, the situation of the worker, be his payment high or low must "grow worse".&lt;ref name="Capital-1-799"&gt;''[[Capital, Volume I]]'', Penguin ed., p. 799. emphasis added.&lt;/ref&gt; It is quite clear from the context though that by "worse" Marx does not primarily mean poverty. He means instead, as he says himself explicitly, that "all means of development of production undergo a dialectical inversion so that they become means of domination and exploitation of the producers".&lt;ref name="Capital-1-799" /&gt; He is talking about "worse" in the sense of "inhuman", "more exploited" or "alienated".

=== Overpopulation ===
Another dispute concerns the notion of "[[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Frank Furedi |first=Frank |last=Furedi |title=Population and Development: A Critical Introduction |publisher=St. Martin's Press |year=1997 |isbn=0-7456-1538-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In Marx's own time, [[Thomas Robert Malthus]] raised dire predictions that [[population growth]] enabled by capitalist wealth would exceed the [[food supply]] required to sustain that population. As noted, for Marx "overpopulation" was really more an [[ideology|ideologically]] [[loaded term]] or [[social construct]] and Marxists have argued there is no real problem here as enough [[food]] can be produced for all; if there is a problem, it lies in the way that food is produced and distributed.

Marx argued that there are no substantive laws of population that hold good for all time; instead, each specific [[mode of production]] has its own specific demographic laws. If there was "[[Human overpopulation|overpopulation]]" in capitalist society, it was overpopulation relative to the requirements of [[capital accumulation]]. Consequently, demography could not simply just count people in various ways as it also had to study the [[social relations]] between them as well. If there are enough resources on the planet to provide all people with a decent life, the argument that there are "too many people" is rather dubious.

People cannot help being born and being there, but the concept of overpopulation can easily suggest that part of the people do not really deserve to be there, or that they should not exist. From there, it is only another step to hating part of the human race and to feel justified in wiping that part out (or at least subject people to compulsory sterilization). If people believe that each human being has a right to be there and enjoy life, there cannot be "overpopulation". At most, one could say that there are too many people living in a particular area. Even so, people can get used to living with remarkably little personal space.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

The counter-argument is that in many poor countries people get far more children than they can reasonably feed, support and provide with a decent life under the circumstances. If people had fewer children with the aid of [[contraception]], then it would put much less pressure on already scarce resources and enable a better life for the living.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

=== Consent ===
In the social welfare area, there are also perpetual disputes about the extent to which unemployment is voluntarily chosen by people, or [[involuntary unemployment|involuntary]], whether it is forced on people or whether it is their own choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michel |last=de Vroey |title=Involuntary Unemployment: The Elusive Quest for a Theory |location=London |publisher=Routledge |year=2004 |isbn=0-415-08074-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Great Depression of the 1930s, when unemployment rose to 20–30% of the [[Workforce|working population]] in many countries, people generally believed it was involuntary, but if unemployment levels are relatively low, the argument that unemployment is a matter of choice is more often heard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Tom |editor1-last=Brass |editor2-first=Marcel |editor2-last=Van Der Linden |title=Free and Unfree Labour: The Debate Continues |series=International and Comparative Social History |volume=5 |location=New York |publisher=Peter Lang |year=1997 |isbn=0-8204-3424-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be that there simply are no jobs for the unemployed, but it could also be that there is a mismatch between the skills that the unemployed have and the type of skilled labour for which there is a demand. If the latter is the case, then it could be argued that if the unemployed were willing to retrain or do a different kind of work, then they could get a job. In a sense, it is always possible to get a job if a person is prepared to accept a low salary, but people might not want to work below a certain minimum amount of salary. {{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

=== Measurement ===
There are endless debates about the best way to measure unemployment, its costs and its effects and to what extent a degree of unemployment is inevitable in any country with a developed [[labour market]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Bob Rowthorn]] &amp; [[Andrew Glyn]], "The diversity of unemployment experience since 1973". Working paper No. 40, World Institute of Development Economics Research, Helsinki 1988; {{cite book |authorlink=Göran Therborn |first=Göran |last=Therborn |title=Why Some Peoples Are More Unemployed than Others |location=London |publisher=Verso |year=1986 |isbn=0-86091-109-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[NAIRU]] concept, price stability in market-based societies necessarily requires a certain amount of unemployment. One reason a reserve army of the unemployed exists in market economies, it is argued, is that if the level of unemployment is too low, it will stimulate [[price inflation]]. However, the validity of this argument depends also on state economic policy and on the ability of workers to raise their wages. If for example [[trade unions]] are legally blocked from organizing workers, then even if unemployment is relatively low, average wages can be kept low; the only way that individual workers have in that case to raise their income is to work more hours or work themselves up to better-paying jobs.

Normally, the government measure of unemployment defines "unemployed" as "without any job, but actively looking for work". There are also people defined as "jobless", who want work yet are not, or no longer, actively looking for work because they are discouraged and so on. This official view of the matter is closely linked to the administration of [[unemployment benefits]]. To be entitled for an unemployment benefit, it is a requirement that the beneficiary is actively looking for work.

=== Hidden unemployment ===
There are also many controversies about hidden unemployment. Hidden unemployment means that people are not counted or considered as unemployed, although in reality they are unemployed. For example, young people will stay in the family home, in schooling, or in some [[make-work job|make-work]] scheme because they can not find a paid job. People might also have a job, but they might be underemployed because they cannot get more working hours or they cannot get a job for which they are qualified. People might also drop out of the official labour force because they are discouraged and no longer actively looking for work; they are no longer counted as unemployed, although they are. Governments can also subsidize employment of people who would otherwise be unemployed, or put people on benefits even although they could be working. It may be that workers are hired, but that they do nothing while at work.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

On the one side, governments often try to make unemployment seem as low as possible because that is politically desirable. On the other side, governments also often provide "broader" and "narrower" measures of unemployment. For example, the United States [[Bureau of Labor Statistics]] provides six measures of labor underutilization (U-1, U-2, U-3, U-4, U-5 and U-6). The U-3 rate is the "official" unemployment rate.

== A global reserve army of labour ==
Marx was writing in the mid-19th century and his discussion of unemployment may therefore be in part out of date, especially if one considers only particular developed countries. However, his analysis may continue to be quite valid if considered globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=John Bellamy |last=Foster |first2=Robert W. |last2=McChesney |first3=R. Jamil |last3=Jonna |title=The Global Reserve Army of Labor and the New Imperialism |journal=Monthly Review |location=New York |volume=63 |issue=6 |date=November 2011 |url=http://monthlyreview.org/2011/11/01/the-global-reserve-army-of-labor-and-the-new-imperialism }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Labour Organization|ILO]] reports that the proportion of jobless has been steadily increasing since the beginning of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]].

In 2007, the ILO standard global unemployment measure stood at 169.7 million. In 2012, the ILO global unemployment rate reached 5.9% of the civilian labour force (195.4 million, or a net 25.7 million more), 0.5 percentage points higher than the 5.4% rate before the financial crisis. The official global unemployment rate was expected to have risen to 6% of the civilian labour force in 2013. Over 30 million jobs were still needed to return total employment to the level that prevailed before the financial crisis. It was expected in 2013 that globally about 205 million people would be unemployed in 2014 and 214 million in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;ILO, ''World of Work Report 2013''. Geneva: ILO, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the official total of the unemployed was subsequently (in 2017) forecast to be just over 201 million persons in that year and with an additional rise of 2.7 million expected in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilo.org/wcmsp5/groups/public/---dgreports/---dcomm/---publ/documents/publication/wcms_541211.pdf ''World employment social outlook - trends 2007''. Geneva: ILO, 2017]&lt;/ref&gt; The official world total of unemployed in the labour force is approximately equal to the total number of employed workers in the United States, Canada and Mexico put together.

The official unemployment figures do not include jobless people who have dropped out of the labour force altogether because they can not find work as they include only those actually looking for work. The global unemployment rate is strongly influenced by population growth; the more population, the more unemployed and employed in absolute numbers. However, the proportion of jobless people is now rising every year and is expected to continue rising for quite some time.

Among the world's unemployed, the ILO estimates that roughly half the global total are young people aged 15 to 24. In the rich countries, it often does not matter so much if young people are unemployed at that age, but in the Middle East, Asia, Africa and Latin America where most of the unemployed youths are it is often a much more serious problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor1-first=Navtej |editor1-last=Dhillon |editor2-first=Tarik |editor2-last=Yousef |title=Generation in Waiting: The Unfulfilled Promise of Young People in the Middle East |location=Washington, DC |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=2009 |isbn=978-081-570-314-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Modern academic usage ==
In recent years, there has been a growing use in [[Marxism|Marxist]] and [[Anarchism|anarchist]] theory of the concept of "the [[precariat]]" to describe a growing reliance on temporary, part-time workers with precarious status who share aspects of the proletariat and the reserve army of labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Choonara|first=Esme|title=Is there a precariat?|journal=Socialist Review|date=October 2011|url=http://www.socialistreview.org.uk/article.php?articlenumber=11781}}&lt;/ref&gt; Precarious workers do work part-time or full-time in temporary jobs, but they cannot really earn enough to live on and depend partly on friends or family, or on state benefits, to survive. Typically, they do not become  truly "unemployed", but they do not have a decent job to go to either.&lt;ref&gt;Jan Breman, "A bogus concept?", ''New Left Review'' 84, November–December 2013, pp. 130-138.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although non-employed people who are unable or uninterested in performing legal paid work are not considered among the "unemployed", the concept of "conjunctural unemployment" is used in economics nowadays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ben |last=Fine |title=Labour Market Theory: A Constructive Reassessment |publisher=Routledge |location=London |year=1998 |isbn=0-415-16676-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Economists often distinguish between short-term "frictional" or "cyclical" unemployment and longer-term "structural unemployment". Sometimes there is a shortterm mismatch between the demand and supply of labour, at other times there is much less total demand for labour than supply for a long time. If there is no possibility for getting a job at all in the foreseeable future, many younger people decide to migrate or emigrate to a place where they can find work.

'''Her Majesty's Principal Secretary of State for Health and Social Care''' ('''Health Secretary''') is a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|British cabinet]] position serving as head of the [[Department of Health and Social Care]] and holds responsibility for the [[National Health Service]] (NHS). Since [[Devolution in the United Kingdom|devolution]] in 1999, the position holder's responsibility for the NHS is mainly restricted to the [[National Health Service (England)|health service in England]], with the holder's counterparts in Scotland and Wales responsible for the NHS in [[NHS Scotland|Scotland]] and [[NHS Wales|Wales]]. Prior to devolution, the [[Secretary of State for Scotland|Secretaries of State for Scotland]] and [[Secretary of State for Wales|Wales]] had those respective responsibilities, but the [[Department of Health and Social Care (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] had a larger role than now in the co-ordination of health policy across Great Britain. Health services in [[Northern Ireland]] have always had separate arrangements from the rest of the UK, and are currently the responsibility of the Health Minister in the [[Northern Ireland Executive]].

The first Boards of Health were created by Orders in [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Council]] dated 21 June, 14 November and 21 November 1831. In 1848, a General Board of Health was created with the [[First Commissioner of Woods and Forests]] as its president. In 1854, this Board was reconstituted and the President appointed separately. However, the Board was abolished in 1858 and its function of overseeing the local boards was transferred to a new Local Government Act Office within the Home Office. From 1871, that function was transferred to the new [[Local Government Board]].

The Ministry of Health was created in 1919 as a reconstruction of the Local Government Board.  Local government functions were eventually transferred to the [[Minister of Housing and Local Government]], leaving the Health Ministry in charge of Health proper.

From 1968, it was amalgamated with the Ministry of Social Security under the [[Secretary of State for Work and Pensions|Secretary of State for Social Services]], until a de-merger of the [[Department of Health and Social Security]] on 25 July 1988.

The '''Speak Good English Movement''' ('''SGEM''') is a [[Government of Singapore|Singapore Government]] campaign&lt;ref name="launch"&gt;[http://www.singapore-window.org/sw99/90830afp.htm Singapore to launch Speak-good-English campaign] – Agence France Presse in Singapore, 30 August 1999. Retrieved 18 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; to "encourage Singaporeans to speak grammatically correct English that is universally understood".&lt;ref name="SGEwebsite"&gt;[http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/about/about-us/what-we-do/ Speak Good English Movement – What We Do] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110830040328/http://www.goodenglish.org.sg/about/about-us/what-we-do/ |date=30 August 2011 }} Retrieved 18 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
It was launched by then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] on 29 April 2000. The purpose was to ensure that Singaporeans recognise the importance of speaking [[Standard English]] and to encourage its usage.&lt;ref name="nzh"&gt;[http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=10672269 Locals told to speak English, not Singlish] – NZ Herald, 10 September 2010. Retrieved 18 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
English was introduced in 1819 with [[Founding of modern Singapore|the establishment of the modern port in Singapore]]. The port attracted migrants from neighbouring countries, such as China and India, resulting in a [[languages of Singapore|diverse linguistic landscape]]. Proximity to these languages has over generations influenced [[Singaporean English]]. Known colloquially as [[Singlish]], it is characterised by the mixture of local expressions with Standard English (e.g. the use of discourse particles such as ''lah'').&lt;ref name=singlish&gt;"You see me no up" – Is Singlish a problem? – Chng, Huang Hoon. ''Language Problems &amp; Language Planning'', 27(1), 45–60, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Singlish is commonly used by Singaporeans in informal contexts and can be incomprehensible to non-Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,501020729-322685,00.html A War of words over 'Singlish'] – TIME, 22 July 2002. Retrieved 18 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Speak Good English Movement was launched in 1999, then-Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] described Singlish as "English corrupted by Singaporeans", and "broken, ungrammatical English".&lt;ref name="launch"/&gt; According to the government, mastery of Standard English is imperative to raise living standards in Singapore,&lt;ref name="nzh" /&gt; and Singlish causes problems when Singaporeans need to communicate in the "global language of commerce, business and technology".&lt;ref name="bbcnews"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/1261986.stm |title=Singapore attack on 'Singlish' |date=5 April 2001 |work=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement thus campaigns for an improved standard of English used in Singapore. In hopes of extending its reach, the movement adopts a different theme and target group each year,&lt;ref name="SGEwebsite" /&gt; and also collaborates with various partner organisations to provide programmes in line with the movement's goals.

==Aims==
The campaign aims to discourage the use of Singlish and encourage the use of a more standardised form of English, (i.e. generally modelled on the [[British English|British]] standard). According to the movement's chairman, then Colonel(NS) David Wong,&lt;ref&gt;David Wong quoted in M.Nirmala, ''No Singlish please, We're Singaporeans'' – The Straits Times, 31 March 2000, p. 33&lt;/ref&gt; the Speak Good English Movement aims to build a sense of pride that Singaporeans can speak good English, as opposed to Singlish, as well as to check the trend where Singaporeans use Singlish as a way of [[Prestige (sociolinguistics)|identifying]] themselves. Instead, it envisions a brand of grammatically correct English, different from Singlish, to be linked with the unique Singaporean identity.

==Past themes==
Since 2003, the Speak Good English Movement has been launched annually with year-long programmes and activities held island-wide to increase the awareness among Singaporeans that speaking good English matters in their daily lives.&lt;ref name="SGEwebsite" /&gt; Each year a different theme focusing on the target audience is created. The themes that were used in the campaign up until 2015 are:

* [[#Speak Well. Be Understood. (2000–2004)|2000–2004: Speak Well. Be Understood.]]

===Speak Well. Be Understood. (2000–2004)===

====2000–01====
In 1999, then Prime Minister [[Goh Chok Tong]] highlighted the problem of speaking Singlish in his [[National Day Rally]]. A year later in April 2000, he officially launched the Speak Good English Movement with the tagline 'Speak Well, Be Understood'. He stressed the importance of speaking standard English and reducing the use of Singlish, as Singapore is a hub city and an open economy with a need to interact with English-speaking foreigners. Singaporeans often use Chinese syntax and literal translations of Chinese phrases while speaking English, which make utterances seem truncated and incomprehensible to foreigners. In his rally, the prime minister stressed that "if we speak a corrupted form of English that is not understood by others, we will lose a key competitive advantage."&lt;ref&gt;"Speak Good English Movement" launched in Singapore – Xinhua News Agency, 29 April 2000&lt;/ref&gt; The movement was spearheaded by a committee of people in the private sector led by then Colonel (NS) David Wong, a senior adviser with the consulting company [[Ernst and Young]]. Its target audience was Singaporeans under 40, which included young working adults, parents and students in schools, tertiary institutes, polytechnics and technical institutes. The launch kick-started a week-long festival packed with events such as plays and a speech marathon.

Later in the year, the public sector also organised year-long programmes as part of the movement.&lt;ref&gt;Buck up, poor English reflects badly on us – PM.- The Straits Times, 30 April 2000, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; One such event was the seminar held by the [[Singapore Teachers' Union]] (STU) at the Shangri-La Hotel, attended by about 500 participants who were mostly teachers. The seminar emphasised the power of pronunciation and the teaching of grammar, and encouraged teachers to teach English in more creative ways in schools using dramas and role-playing.&lt;ref&gt;Teach good English? Seminar will give tips. – The Straits Times, 26 May 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Other highlights in 2000 included the launch of [https://web.archive.org/web/20101029045134/http://asp.marketasia.com.sg/RELC/grammarindex.asp Grammar Matters], a series of 5 books using comics to illustrate the correct use of grammar by the Regional English Language Centre in support of the movement.

====2001–02====
From 2001–2002, it was reported that increasingly, Singaporeans were becoming more aware and acknowledging the importance of speaking good English. The [[British Council]] continued to operate its toll-free line giving English lessons. Reportedly, year 2001 saw almost 250,000 callers while there were about 170,000 callers in 2002.  Also, an inter-school [[Scrabble]] competition, in which 54 primary schools participated, was held to kick off the year's events in April 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Singaporeans starting to value importance of speaking good English. – Channel News Asia, 12 April 2002&lt;/ref&gt;

====2002–03====
According to the Government, more Singaporeans recognised the need to speak well, and took steps to improve their spoken English. Programmes organised by SGEM partners such as the [[People’s Association]] and the [[British Council]] were well received.&lt;ref&gt;Official Speech for SGEM 2003/04 – Col (NS) David Wong, 2 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

====2003–04====
In 2003, the movement, already in its fourth year, aimed to not only encourage Singaporeans to speak well but also speak simple English.  Chairman Wong said, "They may be afraid to use English, it's not natural to them. This year what we would like to do is encourage people to try. Have a go even if they can't speak well, even if they cannot use long words, even if they can't use long sentences, it's not important. The idea is to use simple words, simple sentences and convey their message clearly."&lt;ref&gt;Speak Good English Movement aims to get people to speak simple English.- Channel News Asia, 2 July 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The movement continued throughout the year until March 2004 so as to create greater impact and awareness.

He also reasons that the beauty of Singlish is the fact that "It's also wonderfully time- and breath-saving. If you need to know the time, you say: 'Now what time?'. It gets the question across in three words. Where got time to say: 'Do you know what time it is now?'"}}

====Save Our Singlish Campaign====
On 27 April 2002, two years after the start of SGEM, [[TalkingCock]] launched the Save Our Singlish Campaign. They made it clear at the speech during the launch that they did not oppose the speaking of good English. Rather, they "completely support the writing and speaking of good English" and hoped that SGEM would see the Save Our Singlish Campaign "as complementary, not adversarial".&lt;ref name = "TalkingCock" /&gt; TalkingCock found it important to save Singlish for it is a crucial part of the Singaporean culture and heritage:&lt;ref name = "TalkingCock" /&gt;
{{blockquote|Why we're fighting for Singlish, is because it's simply a part of our culture. In fact, it may be the ONLY thing that makes us uniquely Singaporean. It mixes all the various languages, which to me, seems to spread multi-cultural understanding. I thought this was something to be proud of.}}
Furthermore, they reiterated that "Singlish is not just broken English. It's a patois."&lt;ref name = "TalkingCock" /&gt; They argued that speaking good English should not be promoted at the expense of Singlish. ''Singapore Watch'' summed it up with "Speak Singlish proudly, speak English properly."&lt;ref&gt;[http://singaporewatch.org/2005/04/30/speak-singlish-proudly-speak-english-properly "Speak Singlish Proudly, Speak English Properly"] – ''Singapore Watch'', 30 April 2005. Retrieved 18 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; [[Colin Goh]], who started [[TalkingCock]], pointed out that Singaporeans can tell the difference between English and Singlish:&lt;ref name="TalkingCock" /&gt;
{{blockquote|Have more faith in Singaporeans than that. We know when to use Singlish and when not to. We are intelligent enough to know we don't write formal letters in Singlish. When was the last time you typed out, "Eh, give me a job, leh!" And we try not to speak Singlish to our foreign friends because we instinctively know that they might not understand. Or as we say, they'll catch no ball.}}
He further acknowledged that there are times when improper English is spoken by Singaporeans but reiterated that the blame cannot be pushed onto Singlish:
{{blockquote|If Singaporeans' communication with Europeans or Americans is bad, that's because they speak broken English, not Singlish. We all know we can't speak Singlish to foreigners because they'll all catch no ball. That's just common sense. The fault isn't with too much Singlish, it's because English is taught so badly.}}

In an event held on 24 August 2006, ''TalkingCock in Parliament: We, the Citizens'', Ruby Pan (a former Ministry of Education scholar and a graduate of [[Princeton University]]) displayed the ability to switch easily from Standard English to Singlish and to different English accents.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrbrownshow.com/2006/08/30/the-mrbrown-show-video-talkingcock-in-parliament-ruby-pan/ "TalkingCock in Parliament" Video clip] – Ruby Pan, The mrbrown Show.

====Speak Good Singlish Movement====
The Speak Good Singlish Movement gathers support through a [[Facebook]] page which {{as of | 2013 | September | lc = on}} had 252 members&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.facebook.com/pages/Speak-Good-Singlish-Movement/128281041371 "Speak Good Singlish Movement"] – Facebook page. Retrieved 30 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt; though as reported in a dead link, an identically named group had 3,140 members in December 2012.&lt;ref name="SGSM"/&gt; It began as a response to the launch of SGEM 2010, in particular, its notion of using [[post-it note|post-it]]s to correct public signs written in poor English. The page ran its own post-it campaign, called the "Post-its Tak Bak Chew Campaign", inviting supporters to send in snapshots of their own home-made signs with proper Singlish.

The original Facebook page was established on 11 September 2010 with the following statements:

{{blockquote|We are not against the Speak Good English Movement in Singapore. But we believe that we should get it right with speaking English as well as Singlish. We are tired of people confusing Singlish with broken English. We are tired of people pretending to speak Singlish by speaking bad English. We are tired of people caricaturising Singlish speakers as uncouth and unintelligent. If you don't bother to learn the subtle rules of a natural evolving language, then please don't conclude that it is simple, shallow, and useless! Singlish is full of cultural nuances and wordplay, and it pulls together the best in the grammar, syntax, and vocabulary of many languages.&lt;ref name="SGSM"&gt;Archive.is, [https://archive.is/20121215015056/http://www.facebook.com/MySGSM "Speak Good Singlish Movement"] – Archived  Facebook page. 15 December 2012&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In an exclusive interview with [[The Online Citizen]], one of the Singapore's key social commentary websites, its unnamed founder directly called into question Dr Balakrishnan's appeal about the SGEM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theonlinecitizen.com/2010/09/“please-stop-hum-tumming-singlish-just-leebit-alone” "Please stop hum-tumming Singlish! Just leebit alone!"] – The Online Citizen, 17 September 2010. Retrieved 18 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hiring "native" English speakers to teach===
Since Singapore gained independence in 1965, English is taught as a first language and is also the most dominant language in Singapore. All public schools use English as the medium of instruction. But one cannot classify all Singaporeans as [[native speakers]] of English because the [[Languages in Singapore#Home languages|main languages spoken at home]] are not necessarily English. In 2006, then Education Minister [[Tharman Shanmugaratnam]] mentioned during a dialogue session at a student education conference that his ministry was looking at hiring "native speakers" to teach English Language in schools in order to improve the standard of teaching the English language in school.&lt;ref&gt;MOE considering whether to hire native speakers to teach English – The Straits Times, 10 June 2006. Retrieved 23 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, many Singaporeans wrote in to newspapers forums with questions such as "Why aren't our English teachers suitably qualified?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2006/forum_letters/20060622.pdf Why aren't our English teachers suitably qualified?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090902020601/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2006/forum_letters/20060622.pdf |date=2 September 2009 }} Fok Kah Hon – Today Voices, 22 June 2010. Retrieved 23 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and wondering if "native English speakers" meant foreign English-speakers hailing from the United States or from Britain.

On 14 June 2006, [[mrbrown]] reported in his blog that the Ministry of Education had already put up job advertisements in the British newspaper ''[[The Guardian]]'' for experienced, qualified native speakers of English to teach English as a first language, English Literature, Geography, History, Knowledge and Inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrbrown.com/blog/2006/06/moe_ad_seen_in_.html MOE ad seen in The Guardian newspaper] – mrbrown blog post, 14 June 2006. Retrieved 23 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently, mrbrown created two [[podcasts]] on [[the mrbrown show]] to express his views. The first gave insight to what will happen if the implementation of hiring foreign native English speakers to teach English became too successful.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrbrownshow.com/2006/06/14/the-mrbrown-show-14-june-2006-smile-and-speak-good-english/ "Smile and speak good english"] – The mrbrown Show, 14 June 2006. Retrieved 223 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The second tells of how he imagines the interviews with the native speaker applicants for the teaching jobs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mrbrownshow.com/2006/06/19/the-mrbrown-show-19-june-2006-the-native-speaker-interviews "The native speaker interviews"] – The mrbrown Show, 19 June 2006. Retrieved 23 October 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Jennifer Chan, Press Secretary to Minister for Education, wrote in a forum letter reply dated 22 June 2006 that:
{{blockquote|The criteria for the selection of foreign teachers will remain stringent. Besides academic and teaching qualifications, they should also have a proven track record in teaching in their countries. The individuals may be native speakers or persons who have learnt EL well as a first language}}
The hiring of "a small number" of foreign teachers was to complement the local teachers in subjects like English, [[Language education in Singapore|the Mother Tongue Languages]] and the Humanities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2006/20060622.htm All primary school English teachers are trained; criteria for selecting foreign teachers are stringent] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823022021/http://www.moe.gov.sg/media/forum/2006/20060622.htm |date=23 August 2011 }} Chan, Jennifer.

===The "interference" argument===
Drawing from notions of [[linguistic interference]], the "interference" argument justifies the need to eliminate Singlish by suggesting that it confuses and contaminates Standard English. It suggests that the inability to distinguish the grammars of the two varieties of English will cause learners to mix their features, thus contaminating the grammar of the standard version.&lt;ref&gt;'Burdens' and 'handicaps' in Singapore's language policy: on the limits of language management – Wee, Lionel, ''Language Policy'', 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many{{quantify|date=April 2016}} Singaporeans feel that Singlish is unlikely to negatively affect their proficiency in Standard English. In a 2008 study, about 41% of the Singaporean participants felt that they already have a good command of English.&lt;ref&gt;Speak good English? 4 in 10 Singaporeans say "no need lah" – Wong, Tessa. SG Forum, 28 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Wee (2005) has shown that in general, Singaporeans are confident in their [[code-switching]] abilities between Singlish and Standard English, which undermines the claims that using Singlish interferes with the learning of Standard English.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Tetsunari Iida''' ({{lang|ja|飯田 哲也}}, ''Iida Tetsunari''; born 1959, [[Yamaguchi Prefecture]], [[Japan]]) is director of the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies in Japan. Following the [[Fukushima nuclear disaster]], he is calling for a decrease in Japan's reliance on [[nuclear power]] and an increase in [[renewable energy]] use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110927p2a00m0na009000c.html |title=Anti-nuclear researcher to sit on gov't panel on energy policies |author= |date=September 27, 2011 |work=Mainichi Daily News }}{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iida started his career as a nuclear engineer, but he quit in 1992, and went to study renewable energy in Sweden. In September 2011, Iida launched the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, which is backed by ¥1 billion (US$13 million) from Japan's richest man, [[Masayoshi Son]]. 
 
[[Solar power in Japan]] has been expanding since the late 1990s.

Iida started his career as a nuclear engineer, but he quit in 1992, and went to study renewable energy in Sweden. When he returned to Japan in 1998, he formed the Institute for Sustainable Energy Policies. Since then he has set up several green mutual funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/blog/post/2011/11/japans-tipping-point2-tetunari-iida-and-isep |title=Japan's Tipping Point Part 2: Tetsunari Iida and ISEP  |author=Mark Pendergrast | authorlink=Mark Pendergrast |date=1 November 2011  |work=Renewable Energy World }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Iida launched the Japan Renewable Energy Foundation, which is backed by ¥1 billion (US$13 million) from Japan's richest man, [[Masayoshi Son]]. The foundation will bring together some 100 experts from around the world to analyse obstacles to [[Renewable energy commercialization|implementing renewable energy]], and offer policy recommendations to the new Japanese government.&lt;ref name=renew&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110830/full/477013a.html |title=Japan's new leader faces energy gap  |author=David Cyranoski |date=Vol. 477, No. 13-14 (2011)  |work=Nature }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Other Economic Summit''' ('''TOES''') was a counter-summit to the annual [[G7 (major advanced economies)|G7]] summits, first held in 1984 in London.  It included diverse groups of economists, greens and community activists.  TOES eventually became an umbrella term and similar meetings were organised around the world for the next two decades.&lt;ref name="CDJ"&gt;{{cite journal|last=The Other Economic Summit.|year=1985|title=Bonn Economic Summit: A draft agenda for economic recovery and world development|journal=Community Development Journal|volume=20|issue=4|pages=309–311|url=https://academic.oup.com/cdj/article-abstract/20/4/309/289834?redirectedFrom=fulltext|accessdate=27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== TOES summits ==
The Other Economic Summit (TOES) was the idea of Sally Willington (1931-2008), founder of AIMS and founder member of the British Green Party. The First TOES in 1984 was organised by  the [[New Economics Foundation]] and the [[Right Livelihood Award]]s, and was focused on alternative development and environmental issues.
&lt;ref name="Pianta"&gt;{{cite book|last=Pianta |first=Mario | author2=Marchetti, Raffaele.|title=The global justice movement: A cross-national and transnational perspective|editor=D. della Porta|publisher=Paradigm|location=Boulder, Co.|year=2007|pages=34|chapter=The global justice movements: The transnational dimension|url=http://docenti.luiss.it/rmarchetti/files/2008/05/gjm-tn-dim-proofs.pdf|accessdate= 27 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[New Economics Foundation]], a UK-based think tank, had the aim of working towards a "new model of wealth creation, based on equality, diversity and economic stability".&lt;ref name="DPH" /&gt;

The purpose of the summit was to highlight that the economy could be organised in other ways. TOES also challenged the right of the G7 leaders to speak for the world. TOES demanded that the system of global economic governance should be democratised. It was also suggested that the G7 Summits should be replaced by a representative World Economic Council within the [[United Nations]] system. &lt;ref name="DPH"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bakshi |first1=Rajni.

From 1985 to 1987 TOES was held in the UK, sending a delegation to the G-7 summit city. From 1988 onward, TOES convened every year in the city of the G-7 Summit. In 1988 TOES North America sponsored the TOES in Toronto which was part of a Citizens Summit. In 1989 TOES France held an alternative summit in Paris entitled "L'Autre Sommet Economique". The 1990 TOES was held for three days in Houston, Texas &lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{cite web |last1=TOES '90 - Houston |title=The Voice of the People for a Change |url=https://toesusa.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/houston_1990.pdf |publisher=TOES |accessdate=27 July 2018 |ref=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political scientist Andrew Vincent argues that an [[environmentalism|ecologically based]] theory of economics underpins TOES, part of an emerging political ideology referred to by Vincent as ''ecologism''.&lt;ref name="Vincent"&gt;{{cite book|last=Vincent|first=Andrew.|title=Modern political ideologies|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2009|edition=3rd|pages=220|isbn=1-4051-5495-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''''Volk ohne Raum'''''" ({{IPA-de|fɔlk ˈoːnə ʁaʊ̯m|}} [[English language|English]]: ''people without space'') was a [[political slogan]] used in the [[Weimar Republic]] and [[Nazi Germany]]. The term was coined by the nationalist writer [[Hans Grimm]] with his novel ''Volk ohne Raum'' (1926). The novel immediately attracted much attention and sold nearly 700,000 copies.&lt;ref name="Wistrich85"&gt;{{cite book |last= Wistrich|first=Robert Solomon|title=Who's who in Nazi Germany|publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=85|location= |year=2002|isbn=0-415-26038-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use ==
The slogan was used in a political context to suggest that due to the [[Treaty of Versailles]] depriving [[Germany]] of her [[German colonial empire|colonial empire]], the [[German people|Germans]] had become a people without living space (''[[Lebensraum]]''), struggling with poverty, misery, hunger and overpopulation.&lt;ref name="carsten309"&gt;{{cite book |last= Carsten|first=Francis Ludwig|title=Essays in German history|publisher=[[Continuum International Publishing Group]]|page=309|location= |year=1985|isbn=0-907628-67-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Closely linked to this idea was the claim that the [[Imperialism|earth was divided]] unfairly among the [[Great Powers]], leaving the Germans possessing little land compared to the less populous European nations.&lt;ref name="carsten309"/&gt;

The most known usage of the slogan is by the [[Nazi Party|Nazis]]. In Nazi propaganda the slogan was repeatedly used to at least justify or legitimize the German conquest of Poland and the Soviet Union and for the massive territorial expansion into Eastern Europe to ensure Germanic [[Aryan race|Aryan]] ''[[master race|Herrenvolk]]'' ("Aryan master race") rule over Poles and Russians who the Nazis considered "non Aryan" and [[Untermensch|subhuman]]. Slavs as non-Aryans were to be ethnically cleansed and exterminated, and their territories settled by Germans. From the very early days of the Nazi party, the notion that the Germans were people without living space and had a right to expand was widespread among German nationalists and right-wing organisations. On February 24, 1920, Hitler proclaimed the party program and one of the 25 points of the [[National Socialist Program]] stated: "We demand land and territory (colonies) for the sustenance of our people, and colonization for our [[Human overpopulation|surplus population]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=[[Deutsches Historisches Museum|DHM]] |url=http://www.dhm.de/lemo/html/dokumente/nsdap25/index.html |title=25-Punkte-Programm der NSDAP |access-date=9 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to justify their ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' ("desire to push East"), the Nazis amended the slogan of ''Volk ohne Raum'' by declaring the vast, sparsely populated lands of Russia a ''Raum ohne Volk'' (a "space without people") which had to be conquered by Germany, the "nation without space".{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

==Early life and education==
William Rangeley, the son of two early Northern Rhodesia pioneers, Henry Rangeley and Florence (née van Breda) was born at Fort Jameson, (now [[Chipata]], Zambia), in what was then [[Northern Rhodesia]], on 2 July 1909. He attended a school in [[Plumtree, Zimbabwe|Plumtree]] in [[Southern Rhodesia]]. and then the [[Diocesan College]] at [[Rondebosch]], a suburb of [[Cape Town]], in [[South Africa]]. He attended [[Rhodes University]] in [[Grahamstown]] and, under a [[Rhodes Scholarship]] he studied at [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], from which he subsequently received a diploma in [[Anthropology]] following study during an extended leave.&lt;ref&gt;Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, (1958). W. H. J. Rangeley, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
==Administrative career==
After his scholarship at [[Oxford University]] ended, he was appointed to the colonial administration of Nyasaland in 1934. He served in many districts and became [[District officer|District Commissioner]] in [[Nkhotakota District]] in the [[Central Region, Malawi|Central Province]] and [[Mzimba District]] in the [[Northern Region, Malawi|Northern Province]], and was promoted to Provincial Commissioner for the [[Southern Region, Malawi|Southern Province]] in 1952. He retained his post as Provincial Commissioner until his death in 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, (1958). W. H. J. Rangeley, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1892 and 1904, district officers with the official title of Collectors of Revenue, later that of Resident, were appointed by the Commissioner and Consul-General of the protectorate. From 1904, the [[Colonial Office]] assumed responsibility for appointments, but before the [[First World War]] they included ex-soldiers and ex-missionary employees whose African experience was their main qualification.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, pp. 70-1.&lt;/ref&gt; After the First World War, the preferred candidates were from the British [[upper middle class]], educated in British [[Public school (United Kingdom)|public schools]] and, if possible, universities. By the 1930s, most new district officers were graduates; the Colonial Office preferred those from Oxford or Cambridge but their graduates usually chose colonies such as Kenya or Southern Rhodesia. Rangeley was not from the usual background of district officers and was described as “rough-hewn”, but his Rhodes Scholarship made him a suitable candidate.&lt;ref&gt;McCracken, (2012). A History of Malawi, 1859-1966, p. 217.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, [[Indirect rule]] was introduced into Nyasaland, and customary law needed to be understood by what were now District Commissioners, who had to ensure that local customary law was being correctly applied by each [[Native Authority]] in their districts. Up to this point, the customary law of African societies had been evolving in response to rapid changes in them, but the colonial administration wanted laws that were codified and consistent with [[English law]], as by rejecting [[Trial by ordeal]] or the recognition of domestic slavery. Rangeley was particularly well equipped for this task through his anthropological training and meticulous recording of information, and also his childhood in an area where the [[Chewa language]], also used in central Nyasaland, was spoken.&lt;ref&gt;B Pachai (2000), 'Notes on Cewa Tribal Law' by Rangeley, pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

The first stadium built in [[Blantyre, Malawi|Blantyre]] was named the Rangeley Stadium after him, but renamed the [[Kamuzu Stadium]] after the first president of the independent [[Malawi]], Dr [[Hastings Banda|Hastings Kamuzu Banda]].&lt;ref&gt;Kalinga, (2012). Historical Dictionary of Malawi, p. 411.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research interests==
Rangeley joined the Nyasaland Society, now the [[Society of Malawi, Historical and Scientific]], in 1948 and produced a detailed anthropological study of the [[Chewa people]] in the first volume of The Nyasaland Journal. As a trained anthropologist, Rangeley was able to carry out original research into the history and culture of the indigenous peoples of Nyasaland living in the areas where his successive appointments took him and he produced around a dozen articles for the Nyasaland Journal before his death. Two articles published in 1959 and 1960 were completed before his death and six published between 1962 and 1964 were chapters of a proposed comprehensive history of Nyasaland. He also undertook investigation of early habitation sites and rock art&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, (1958). W. H. J. Rangeley, pp. 7-8.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Rangeley died of drowning while on a fishing holiday at [[Cape Agulhas]], South Africa on 20 March 1958.&lt;ref&gt;Obituary, (1958). W. H. J. Rangeley, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no record of him marrying or having children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7067">'''Xeer''' (pronounced /ħeːr/) is the traditional [[legal system]] of [[Somalia]], and one of the three systems from which formal Somali [[law]] draws its inspiration, the others being [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] and [[Sharia|Islamic law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/Publications/the-world-factbook/geos/print_so.html|title=CIA The World Factbook - Somalia|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is believed to pre-date [[Islam]], although it was influenced by Islam and retains many of the faith's conservative elements. Under this system, [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]], known as the ''xeer begti'' serve as [[Mediation|mediator]] [[judge]]s and help settle [[court case]]s, taking [[precedent (law)|precedent]] and [[Custom (law)|custom]] into account.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://www.legalaffairs.org/issues/September-October-2005/scene_lombard_sepoct05.msp Legal Affairs&lt;!--Bot-generated title--&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Xeer is [[Polycentric law|polycentric]] in that different groups within Somali society have different interpretations of xeer.

== Application of xeer ==
[[Somali society]] is traditionally structured around a [[clan]] based system, subdivided into [[sub-clan]]s, then [[Lineage (anthropology)|lineages]], and finally [[diyya]] groupings. These groups are bound together either by [[family ties]] or [[contract]]. Xeer [[justice]] usually revolves around the latter groups, as these are the smallest. In these groups, each member is responsible for the [[crime]]s of another, and must accordingly bear some fraction of any decided [[punishment]]. Within this system, only the [[wikt:victim|victim]] or immediate family of a victim can bring [[criminal proceedings]] to xeer mediation. If the victim is a man, his father, brothers, or uncles can bring complaints forward. If the victim is a woman, complaints can be brought forward by the men in her family or the men in her husband's family.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;   

In xeer, crimes are defined in terms of being transgressions against [[property rights]]. Justice is directed in the form of material compensation to the victim. If the accused is found guilty, some form of material [[restitution]] must be paid. If restitution cannot be given, a diyya retribution is due, measured in terms of [[livestock]] (usually healthy female [[camel]]s), to be paid to the victim or the victim's family. There is no concept of [[imprisonment]] under xeer. In some cases, [[Elder (administrative title)|elders]] may advise that neither side seeks restitution or retribution. The [[verdict]] is enforced by the victim's family or else by all able-bodied clansmen within the area wherein the verdict is to be executed.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Somalia: A Tradition of Law, by Nicola Gladitz.&lt;/ref&gt;

Xeer judges are made up of the heads of [[extended family|extended families]]. These family heads are chosen for their knowledge of law and [[wisdom]], but otherwise there is no formal training, and each judge is allowed to formulate their own [[doctrine]]s and [[legal principle]]s. Multiple judges are chosen to preside over each case by the involved parties, with this delegation being called an "ergo".&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTLAWJUSTINST/Resources/EwaWojkowska.pdf|title=Doing Justice: How informal justice systems can contribute|last=Wojkowska|first=Ewa|date=December 2006|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=23 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of judges involved in a case is usually around ten, though it can be as few as two.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In each case, the goal is to reach [[consensus]] between the parties. [[Arbitration]] traditionally takes place under a large tree, and the mediators ask each of the parties to submit to the ruling of the judges. In modern times, [[meeting hall]]s are often used as opposed to sitting under a tree.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each party has the right to appoint [[advocate|a representative to speak]] on its behalf, while a recorder loudly repeats any important points that are made. If a fact is disputed, its veracity must be obtained by the [[testimony]] of three witnesses. If this cannot be done, an [[oath]] must be sworn. Should proceedings become heated, the presiding judge may order a recess, wherein both parties discuss issues relating to the case in small informal groups. Once the mediation has been decided, an [[appeal]] may be requested, although this must be agreed to by all parties.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

== Principles of xeer ==
Different groups within Somali society undertake [[oral agreement]]s with each other to define xeer law.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Despite this informal nature, there is a series of [[customary law|generally accepted principles]], agreements, and ideas that constitute xeer, referred to collectively as "xissi adkaaday". These are: the payment of [[diyya]] by the collective group (clan, sub-clan, lineage, or diyya group) from which an offender originates as [[Financial compensation|compensation]] for the crimes of [[murder]], [[battery (crime)|bodily assault]], [[theft]], [[rape]], and [[defamation of character]], given to the victim or victim's family; the protection of vulnerable or respected members of society such as the elderly, women, children, poets, guests and [[religion|religious]] people; obligations to the family such as the payment of a [[dowry]] to a [[bride]]; the rights of a [[Widow|widower]] to marry the dead wife's sister and the inheritance of a [[widow]] by the dead man's brother; the punishments for [[elopement]]; and the division and use of [[natural resources]] like water and land.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Xeriscaping''' is [[Garden design|landscaping]] and [[gardening]] that reduces or eliminates the need for supplemental water from [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/xeriscape |title=Xeriscape &amp;#124; Define Xeriscape at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date= |accessdate=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is promoted in regions that do not have easily accessible, plentiful, or reliable supplies of [[fresh water]], and is gaining acceptance in other areas as access to water becomes more limited.  Xeriscaping may be an alternative to various types of traditional [[gardening]].&lt;ref&gt;Weinstein, Gayle. "Xeriscape Handbook: A How-To Guide to Natural Resource-Wise Gardening", Golden CO: Fulcrum Publishing (1999), {{ISBN|1555913466}}, pp. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.usatoday.com/tech/science/2007-07-15-xeriscaping_N.htm | title = With xeriscaping, grass needn't always be greener | author = Elizabeth Caldwell | publisher = USA Today | date = 2007-07-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some areas, terms as ''[[water conservation|water-conserving]] landscapes'', ''[[drought]]-tolerant landscaping'', and ''smart scaping'' are used instead. Plants whose natural requirements are appropriate to the local climate are emphasized, and care is taken to avoid losing water to [[evaporation]] and [[Surface runoff|run-off]].  The specific plants used in xeriscaping depend upon the climate. Xeriscaping is different from [[natural landscaping]], because the emphasis in xeriscaping is on selection of plants for water conservation, not necessarily selecting native plants.

Public perception of xeriscaping has frequently been negative as many assume that these types of landscapes are ugly expanses of cactus and gravel. However, studies have shown that education in water conservation practices in the landscape can greatly improve the public's perception of xeriscaping.&lt;ref name=perceptions&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McKenny|first1=Cynthia|last2=Terry, Jr|first2=Robert|title=The Effectiveness of Using Workshops to Change Audience Perception of and Attitudes about Xeriscaping|journal=HortTechnology|date=Oct–Dec 1995|volume=5|issue=4|pages=327–329|url=http://horttech.ashspublications.org/content/5/4/327.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology and similar terms ==
Denver Water coined the term '''xeriscape''' in 1981 by combining "landscape" with the Greek prefix ''xero-'', from ''xeros'', meaning dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=C. Wilson|author2=J.R. Feuch|title=Xeriscaping: Creative Landscaping|url=http://extension.colostate.edu/topic-areas/yard-garden/xeriscaping-creative-landscaping-7-228/|website=Colorado State University Extension|publisher=Colorado State University|accessdate=19 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Denver Water Waterwise Landscape Handbook|url=https://www.denverwater.org/sites/default/files/2017-05/Water_Wise_Landscape_Handbook.pdf|website=Denver Water|accessdate=19 March 2018|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term '''zero-scaping''' or '''zeroscaping''' is sometimes substituted for xeriscaping due to phonetic similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Loser|first1=Marilyn|title=Alamosa Trees    » Xeriscape is Healthy, Zeroscape is Not!|url=http://www.alamosatrees.net/blog/2012/02/xeriscape-is-healthy-zeroscape-is-not/|website=www.alamosatrees.net|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When used seriously, zero-scaping usually refers to a different type of low-water landscaping that is often devoid, or nearly devoid of plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ellefson|first1=Connie Lockhart|last2=Winger|first2=David|title=Xeriscape Colorado : the complete guide|date=2004|publisher=Westcliffe Publishers|location=Englewood, CO|isbn=9781565794955|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Enchanted Xeriscape: A Guide to Water-wise Landscaping in New Mexico|url=http://www.ose.state.nm.us/WUC/PDF/EnchantedXeriscape2004.pdf|website=New Mexico Office of the State Engineer|publisher=State of New Mexico|accessdate=25 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the term was derived from the Greek root ''xeros'', xeriscaping is sometimes misspelled '''xeroscaping'''.

== Advantages ==
[[File:Optuniainbloom.jpg|thumb|right|[[Cactus|Cacti]] are one of the low-water-consuming plants used in Xeriscaping.]]
* Lowered [[water consumption|consumption of water]]: Xeriscaped landscapes can reduce water use 60% or more compared to regular lawn landscapes.&lt;ref name="Colorado Waterwise"&gt; "Xeriscape Colorado". Web. 23 May. 2016. http://coloradowaterwise.org/XeriscapeColorado&lt;/ref&gt;
* Makes more water available for other domestic and community uses and the environment.
* Reduce Maintenance: Aside from occasional [[weeding]] and [[mulching]] Xeriscaping requires far less time and effort to maintain.&lt;ref name=McCracken&gt;{{cite web

* Xeriscape plants in appropriate planting design, and soil grading and mulching, takes full advantage of rainfall retention.&lt;ref name=McCracken/&gt;
* Less cost to maintain: Xeriscaping requires less [[fertiliser]]s and equipment, particularly due to the reduced lawn areas.&lt;ref name=McCracken/&gt;
*Reduced waste and [[pollution]]: Lawn clippings can contribute to organic waste in landfills and the use of heavy fertilizers contributes to [[urban runoff]] [[pollution]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Environmental Fact Sheet: Recyciing Grass Clippings|url=https://nepis.epa.gov/Exe/ZyPDF.cgi/10000KZT.PDF?Dockey=10000KZT.PDF|website=Environmental Protection Agency|publisher=United States|accessdate=23 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Reduce fertilizer use (phosphorus, nitrogen, potassium) that help grow harmful algae

==Legal issue==
Some [[homeowners association]]s have strict rules requiring a certain percentage of land to be used as [[lawn]]s but these rules either have been or are in the process of being overturned in many areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.texastribune.org/2013/01/31/texas-legislation-would-restrict-hoas-love-grass/ |title=Texas Bills Aim to Douse HOAs' [sic] Limits on Xeriscaping |last=Galbraith  |first=Kate |publisher=The Texas Tribune |date=31 January 2013 |access-date=17 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Principles ==
[[File:Wichita Falls October 2015 79 (Al Norris Memorial Xeriscape Garden).jpg|thumb|The Al Norris Memorial Xeriscape Garden in [[Wichita Falls, Texas]]]]

Originally conceived by [[Denver Water]], the seven design principles of xeriscaping have since expanded into simple and applicable concepts to creating landscapes that use less water. The principles are appropriate for multiple regions and can serve as a guide to creating a water conserving landscape that is regionally appropriate and since they were conceived for homeowners they are easy to implement.

1. Plan and design: Create a diagram, drawn to scale, that shows the major elements of the landscape, including house, driveway, sidewalk, deck or [[patio]], existing trees and other elements.&lt;ref name="denverwater"&gt;"Xeriscape Plans." Xeriscape Plans. Denver Water. &lt;http://www.denverwater.org/Conservation/Xeriscape/XeriscapePlans/{{dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=Ost316 |fix-attempted=yes }}&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;

Once a base plan of an existing site has been determined, the creation of a conceptual plan (bubble diagram) that shows the areas for [[turf]], perennial beds, views, screens, slopes, etc. is undertaken. Once finished, the development of a planting plan that reinforces the areas in the appropriate scale is done.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;
[[File:Xeriscaping USCapital2.jpg|thumb|An example of Xeriscaping outside the United States Capitol in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington, DC]]. ]]
2. [[Soil amendment]] {{spaced ndash}} Most plants will benefit from the use of [[compost]], which will help the soil retain water.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt; Some [[desert plant]]s prefer gravel soils instead of well-amended soils. Plants should either fit the soil or soil should be amended to fit the plants.

3. Efficient [[irrigation]]: Xeriscape can be irrigated efficiently by hand or with an automatic [[Irrigation sprinkler|sprinkler]] system. Zone turf areas separately from other plants and use the irrigation method that waters the plants in each area most efficiently. For grass, use gear-driven rotors or rotary spray nozzles that have larger droplets and low angles to avoid wind drift. Spray, drip line or bubbler emitters are most efficient for watering trees, [[shrub]]s, flowers and [[groundcovers]].&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

If watering by hand, avoid oscillating sprinklers and other sprinklers that throw water high in the air or release a fine mist. The most efficient sprinklers release big drops close to the ground.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

Water deeply and infrequently to develop deep roots. Never water during the day to reduce water lost to evaporation. With the use of automatic sprinkling systems, adjust the controller monthly to accommodate weather conditions. Also, install a [[rain sensor]] to shut off the device when it rains.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

4. Appropriate plant and zone selection: Different areas in a yard receive different amounts of light, wind and moisture. To minimize water waste, group together plants with similar light and water requirements, and place them in an area that matches these requirements. Put moderate-water-use plants in low-lying drainage areas, near downspouts, or in the shade of other plants. Turf typically requires the most water and shrub/perennial beds will require approximately half the amount of water.
Dry, sunny areas support low-water-use plants that grow well in our climate. Planting a variety of plants with different heights, color and textures creates interest and beauty.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

5. [[Mulch]]: Mulch keeps plant roots cool, prevents soil from crusting, minimizes evaporation and reduces weed growth. Organic mulches, such as [[bark chips]], pole peelings or wood grindings, should be applied 2 to 4&amp;nbsp;inches deep. Fiber mulches create a web that is more resistant to wind and rain washout. Inorganic mulches, such as rocks and gravel, should be applied 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;inches deep. Surrounding plants with rock makes the area hotter; limit this practice.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

6. Limited turf areas: Native grasses (warm-season) that have been cultivated for turf lawns, such as [[buffalo grass]] and [[blue grama]], can survive with a quarter of the water that [[Poa|bluegrass]] varieties need. Warm-season grasses are greenest in June through September and straw brown the rest of the year.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

Native grasses (cool season) such as bluegrass and [[tall fescue]], are greenest in the spring and fall and go dormant in the high heat of the summer. New cultivars of bluegrass, such as Reveille, and tall fescue, can reduce typical bluegrass water requirements by at least 30 percent. Fine fescues can provide substantial water savings and is best used in areas that receive low traffic or are in shady locations.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

Use the appropriate grass and limit the amount of grass to reduce the watering and maintenance requirements.

7. Maintenance: All landscapes require some degree of care during the year. Turf requires spring and fall [[aeration]] along with regular [[fertilizer|fertilization]] every 6 to 8 weeks. Keep the grass height at 3&amp;nbsp;inches and allow the clippings to fall. Trees, shrubs and perennials will need occasional pruning to remove dead stems, promote blooming or control height and spread. Much of the removed plant material can be shredded and used in composting piles.&lt;ref name="denverwater"/&gt;

==Lawns==

One of the major challenges to the public [[acceptance]] of xeriscaping is the cultural attachment to [[turf grass]] [[lawn]]s. Originally implemented in [[England]], lawns have become in some regions a symbol of prosperity, order and community.&lt;ref&gt;Mustafa, Daanish, Thomas A Smucker, Franklin Ginn, Rebecca Johns, and Shanon Connely. "Xeriscape people and the cultural politics of turfgrass transformation." Environment and Planning D: Society and Space 28.4 (2010): 600-617.&lt;/ref&gt; In the United States turf grasses are so common that it is the single most irrigated crop by surface area, covering nearly {{convert|128000|sqkm}}. Despite the high water, fertiliser and maintenance costs associated with lawns, they have become the [[norm (social)|social norm]] in most urban and [[suburban]] areas, even if they are rarely used for [[recreation]]al purposes or otherwise.&lt;ref&gt;Schindler, Sarah B.. "Banning Lawns(municipal police power to ban lawns as sustainability policy)." The George Washington law review 82.2 (2014): 394-454.&lt;/ref&gt; Xeriscaped landscapes offer an alternative to the over use of turf grass lawns but are not widely accepted because of preconceived notions of what it means to xeriscape. Xeriscaping can include lawn areas but seeks to reduce them to areas that will actually be used, rather than using them as a default landscaping plan.
