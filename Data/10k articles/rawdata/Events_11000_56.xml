The '''1984 Carolinas tornado outbreak''' of March 28, 1984, was the most destructive tornado outbreak to sweep through the two states since the [[Enigma tornado outbreak]] struck 100 years and 1 month earlier, according to [[NOAA]] and NCDC public records.

==Forecast==
Weather records from March 28 indicate that an earlier tornado watch had been issued covering Northern [[Alabama]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and small tornadoes were reported in [[Barrow County, Georgia|Barrow County]] (2:25 P.M., Eastern Standard Time) and [[Henry County, Georgia|Henry County]] (2:30 P.M., EST) in north Georgia.  The first severe reports from [[North Carolina]] – golf-ball sized hail reports from [[Macon County, North Carolina]] also occurred at this time. Severe storms began entering Western [[South Carolina]] by mid-afternoon as a high risk was issued for Alabama, Georgia, and the Carolinas, and [[tornado]] watches had been issued for most of [[South Carolina]], North Carolina and a portion of [[Virginia]].

==Aftermath==
Ultimately this outbreak was responsible for 57 deaths, 1249 injuries, and confirmed tornado damage in 2 counties in [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], 8 counties in [[South Carolina]], and 17 counties in [[North Carolina]], according to data from the National Weather Service and the National Climatic Data Center records and statistical data.

This was an unusual East Coast outbreak both in its sustained intensity and in some of its meteorological specifics. It was noted by [[Thomas P. Grazulis|Grazulis]] and other researchers&lt;ref name=Grazulis /&gt;{{rp|648}} that this outbreak developed near the center of a large-scale low, in a fashion resembling the 1925 Tri-State tornado. In this outbreak, the damage path was attributed to separate tornadoes, though one storm produced (on an estimated 250+ mile track) a family of 13 large tornadoes, 10 of which produced F3 or F4 damage, which was occasionally connected by swaths of downburst damage. The resulting [[tornado family]], the series of tornadoes in totality is among the longest on record.&lt;ref name="Maddox"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Maddox |first = Robert A. |first2= M. S. |last2=Gilmore |first3=C. A. |last3=Doswell III  |first4=R. H. |last4=Johns |first5=C. A. |last5=Crisp |first6=D. |last6=W. Burgess |first7=J. A. |last7=Hart |first8=S.

This outbreak was also part of a larger storm system that was responsible for producing severe weather across a much wider area of the eastern U.S.  On the previous day, weaker tornadoes had been reported in scattered locations from [[Louisiana]] to [[Alabama]], and a thunderstorm-caused flash flood was suspected to be the cause of a train derailment in north [[Florida]].  The northern part of the same system first spawned additional severe (non-tornadic) thunderstorms, which caused 4 additional deaths in [[Maryland]] and [[Pennsylvania]], before then dropping snow, sleet and ice across a wide area of the northeast. The thunderstorms which produced the tornado outbreak were also responsible (according to the same data) for numerous reports of large hail and wind damage in [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] southwest North Carolina, and numerous larger cities ([[Atlanta]], [[Baltimore]], [[Greenville, South Carolina]], [[Columbia, South Carolina]], [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], [[Dover, Delaware]], [[Fayetteville, North Carolina]], [[Philadelphia]], [[Pittsburgh]], [[Raleigh, North Carolina]], [[Suffolk, Virginia]], [[Norfolk, Virginia]]) at the periphery of the outbreak, with wind damage from thunderstorms reported as far north as [[Delaware]].

'''''A New World: A Life of Thomas Paine''''' is a 2009 [[biography|biographical]] play by the English playwright [[Trevor Griffiths]] on the life of [[Thomas Paine]]. Other characters in it include [[Benjamin Franklin]] (who appears both as the historical figure and as a narrator), [[George Washington]], [[Edmund Burke]], [[John Adams]] and [[Georges Danton]]. Its first half tells of Paine's involvement in the [[American Revolution]] and its second half of his involvement in the [[French Revolution]], ending with his funeral.

The play began life as a two-part screenplay for [[Richard Attenborough]] [http://www.shakespeares-globe.org/docs/A%20New%20World%20press%20release.pdf]; though never filmed, it was published in 2005 as 'These Are The Times': A life of Thomas Paine'. It was later adapted for the stage and premiered in the latter format on 29 August 2009 at [[Shakespeare's Globe]]. It ran there until 9 October 2009, directed by [[Dominic Dromgoole]] and starring [[John Light (actor)|John Light]] in the title role. It continues a run of new plays at the Globe on the broad theme of revolution, following [[Eric Schlosser]]'s [[We The People (play)|We The People]] and [[Jack Shepherd (actor)|Jack Shepherd]]'s [[Holding Fire!]] in 2007, and [[Glyn Maxwell]]'s [[Liberty (play)|Liberty]] in 2008.

==History==
[[File:William Arnott, circa 1869.jpg|thumb|upright|Arnott's founder [[William Arnott (biscuit manufacturer)|William Arnott]]]]
[[File:Arnotts.jpg|thumb|Biscuit tin on display in museum at [[Young, New South Wales]]]]
In 1847, Scottish immigrant [[William Arnott (biscuit manufacturer)|William Arnott]] opened a bakery in [[Morpeth, New South Wales|Morpeth]]. Later in 1865 he moved to a bakery on Hunter Street, [[Newcastle, New South Wales|Newcastle]], [[New South Wales]], Australia, providing biscuits and pies to townspeople and ships docking at the local port.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.arnotts.com/about-us/arnotts-heritage.aspx|title=Our heritage|last=|first=|date=|website=Arnott's Australia: Arnott's heritage|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150326190604/http://www.arnotts.com/about-us/arnotts-heritage.aspx|archive-date=26 March 2016|dead-url=yes|access-date=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until 1975 the company was under family control with the descendants of William Arnott, including [[Halse Rogers Arnott]] and [[Geoffrey H. Arnott]], acting as Chairman. Nephew Aaron Arnott chose not to be involved in the family business and lives in Los Angeles, California in the United States of America.

Arnott's, in common with the majority of Australian biscuit manufacturers, operated primarily in its home state, [[New South Wales]], but has manufacturing plants in [[Virginia, Queensland|Virginia]], [[Queensland]] (manufactures only plain, cream and savory biscuits) and [[Shepparton]], [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. In the 1960s, a series of amalgamations and acquisitions in the Australian market resulted in the creation of the Australian Biscuit Company Pty Ltd.  This included Arnotts and other companies such as [[Cecil Augustus Motteram|Arnott-Motteram]] and [[William Menz|Menz]] in [[South Australia]], Brockhoff Biscuit Co. and Guest's Biscuits in Victoria, and [[Mills and Ware Ltd]] in [[Western Australia]]. The Australian Biscuit Company was later renamed Arnott's Biscuits Pty Ltd. Regional varieties were maintained after these mergers, such as [[Yo-Yo biscuits|Menz Yo-Yo]], [[Brockhoff (company)|Brockhoff]] [[Salada (biscuit)|Salada]] and Guest's Teddy Bears.

In 1997, Arnott's Biscuits was subject to an [[extortion]] bid by [[Queensland]]er Joy Ellen Thomas, aged 72 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/26/1019441296856.html|title=Biscuit extortion case dropped over DNA hurdle|date=27 April 2002|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924115921/http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2002/04/26/1019441296856.html|archivedate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who allegedly threatened to poison packets of Arnott's Monte Carlo biscuits in [[South Australia]] and [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]. The company conducted a massive recall and publicity campaign, publishing the extortionist's threats and demands in full-page newspaper ads.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radio National]] (PM): [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s111445.htm Herron's actions a contrast to Arnotts' open-ness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041201150049/http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s111445.htm |date=1 December 2004 }}, [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]], 17 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ms. Thomas was not charged with any offence as the prosecution dropped the case against her because of conflicting evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Radio National]] (PM): [http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s111445.htm Herron's actions a contrast to Arnotts' open-ness] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041201150049/http://www.abc.net.au/pm/stories/s111445.htm |date=1 December 2004 }}, [[ABC Radio National|ABC Radio]], 17 March 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; The recall cost the company [[A$]]22 million, but Arnott's was praised for its openness and honesty in dealing with the crisis.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The 7.30 Report]]'': [http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2005/s1406752.htm Mars, snickers threat aimed at unnamed organisation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060409080910/http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2005/s1406752.htm |date=9 April 2006 }}, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 4 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Campbell Soup Company]] of North America, a shareholder of Arnott's since the 1980s, acquired Arnott's in full. Thus, in 1997, Arnott's Biscuits Ltd became a wholly owned subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company. This caused a significant amount of controversy in Australia, based on the desire for such an Australian icon to remain in Australian hands, and a fear that Campbell's would [[Americanization|Americanise]] the products.

Manufacturing of Arnott's biscuits, however, remained in Australia, and as part of a long-term expansion plan, Arnott's closed its [[Melbourne]] factory in September 2002. At the same time, it expanded its facilities in [[Sydney]], [[Adelaide]] and [[Brisbane]].&lt;ref&gt;Moynihan, Stephen: [http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/02/1028157844462.html Tearful workers feel the final crunch at Arnott's] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030418022541/http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2002/08/02/1028157844462.html |date=18 April 2003 }}, ''[[The Age]]'', 3 August 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Arnott's acquired [[Snack Foods Limited]].&lt;ref&gt;Business Breakfast: [http://www.abc.net.au/businessbreakfast/content/2002/s574846.htm Arnotts bids for Snack Foods] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205135925/http://www.abc.net.au/businessbreakfast/content/2002/s574846.htm |date=5 December 2007 }}, [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 6 July 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2008, Campbell Arnott's sold Arnott's Snackfoods to The Real McCoy Snackfood Co. and the company is now known as [[Snack Brands Australia]].

'''Bring Me Sunshine''' was a gala concert held at the [[London Palladium]] on 28 November 1984 in the presence of the [[Duke of Edinburgh]] in aid of the [[British Heart Foundation]] and was held in memory of the comedian [[Eric Morecambe]] who had died the previous May after many years of heart problems.  It was hosted by Morecambe's long-term partner [[Ernie Wise]] and featured a host of personalities all paying their tribute to the much-missed comedian.  The show began with a dance routine, the theme for the whole evening's music being "sunshine" the dancers were accompanied by ''You Are The Sunshine Of My Life'' which was followed by the big entrance of [[Ernie Wise]] who first spoke, and then sang the duo's signature tune.  This was an emotive moment for Wise and one that showed how big a part Morecambe had played in his life.  Other stars that appeared over the course of the evening were:

* [[Benny Hill]] (who performed his headmaster routine complete with lectern)
* [[Dickie Henderson]] (with his well-known "off-key singer" routine)
* [[Cannon &amp; Ball]] (who had been citied as the next big double act)
* [[Kenny Ball]] &amp; His Jazzmen (who had appeared on so many of their shows)
* [[Angela Rippon]] (who recreated her tiller girl dance routine)
* [[James Casey (variety artist)|James Casey]], [[Eli Woods]] &amp; [[Roy Castle]] (elephant in the box routine)
* [[Bruce Forsyth]] (who played piano and did a stand-up routine)
* [[Des O'Connor]] (the long-term butt of Morecambe's jibes)

There was also a sequence in which the guests of honour were announced and appeared on stage, these included the following guest stars, fans and celebrities:

* [[John Thaw]]
* [[Sheila Hancock]]
* [[Martin Shaw]]
* [[Glenda Jackson]]
* [[Fulton Mackay]]
* [[Dickie Davies]]
* [[Francis Matthews (actor)|Francis Matthews]]

The programme was filmed live and televised on ITV on Christmas Day of that year; in his summing up [[Des O'Connor]] gave a touching and heartfelt tribute to Morecambe proclaiming that "...on the way here tonight I went through Trafalgar Square and the Christmas decorations were going up; I looked and the giant tree and thought to myself - there's going to be one less star on the tree this year".  It was a glittering night that featured the cream of British talent paying tribute to a man who had been considered the best of the best among his peers.

The programme, made and broadcast by [[Thames Television]] was aired once and has never been repeated or made commercially available in any format.  However, the segment of Bruce Forsyth's piano playing and dancing was used in a compilation programme "Heroes Of Comedy" made in 1994 for [[Channel 4]].

'''Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival''', formerly known as the [[Odd Future|OFWGKTA]] Carnival or [[Odd Future]] carnival, is an annual American [[music festival]] and [[carnival]] curated by [[Tyler, the Creator]] and has been held annually since its inception in the fall of 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baltin|first1=Steve|title=Tyler The Creator Is Adding To His Resume With Camp Flog Gnaw Carnival|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/stevebaltin/2016/11/07/tyler-the-creator-is-adding-to-his-resume-with-camp-flog-gnaw/#74881d905e35|website=Forbes|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It features a variety of carnival games and rides (those of which include a massive [[Ferris wheel|Ferris Wheel]], food vendors, and a myriad of notable artists.

Prior to 2016, the festival had only been held on one day. It is always held on a weekend. There is no explicit date(s) for which Camp Flog Gnaw is held. However, past carnivals have been held at either the end of October or the middle of November (with the exception of the very first festival, which was held on September 30, 2012).

'''Championship Off Road Racing''' (usually abbreviated '''CORR''') was a sanctioning body for [[offroad racing]] in the [[United States]]. It formed in 1998 and went bankrupt in 2008. Its Midwest races were supplanted in 2007 by the [[Traxxas TORC Series]] and by the [[Lucas Oil Off Road Racing Series]] on the West Coast in 2009. Both received most of the drivers and adopted the same racing format.

==History==
CORR was formed in 1998 by [[ESPN]] announcer [[Marty Reid]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://dirtbike.off-road.com/dirtbike/rick.corr2/CORRVEGAS-RACE-REPORT-1998-EXXON-SUPERFLO-WINTER-S/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/331517 CORR/Vegas race report 1998 EXXON Superflor winter series] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090617074905/http://dirtbike.off-road.com/dirtbike/rick.corr2/CORRVEGAS-RACE-REPORT-1998-EXXON-SUPERFLO-WINTER-S/ArticleStandard/Article/detail/331517 |date=2009-06-17 }}; Retrieved February 16, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; It displaced the [[SODA (series)|SODA]] series at the premiere short course off-road racing series when most of the drivers in SODA moved to CORR. The series was purchased by Jim Baldwin in 2005. 

Baldwin canceled two of the rounds at Las Vegas in October 2008. In a press release, he stated: "Championship Off Road Racing has made the difficult decision to cancel the Primm, Nevada race on October 25th and 26th.  The current credit crisis has made it very difficult to cover CORR’s costs."&lt;ref name="Dirtnewz.comOctober32008"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dirtnewz.com/corr-pressreleases/2008/10-2008/corr10-3-08.shtml|title=CORR Primm October 25-26 CANCELLED by CORR CEO-JIM BALDWIN|date=October 3, 2008 |publisher=Dirtnewz.com|accessdate=2009-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; He filed for bankruptcy and abandoned the sanctioning body's facilities in [[Chula Vista, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://speedstylemagazine.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=712&amp;Itemid=42|title=Off-Road Racing Keeps Changing!|last=MacDonald|first=Johnny|date=2009-03-18|publisher=Speed Style Magazine|accessdate=2009-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were ten classes in the series.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5383">The '''Court of Augmentations''', also called '''Augmentation Court''' or simply '''The Augmentation''', was established during the reign of King [[Henry VIII of England]] along with three lesser courts (those of [[Court of General Surveyors|General Surveyors]], [[Court of First Fruits and Tenths|First Fruit and Tenths]], and [[Court of Wards and Liveries|Wards and Liveries]]) following the [[dissolution of the monasteries]].  Its primary function was to gain better control over the land and finances formerly held by the [[Roman Catholic Church]] in the kingdom. It was incorporated into the [[Exchequer]] in 1554 as the '''augmentation office'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalgenealogy.org.uk/guide/sta.shtml Guide to Medieval Genealogy]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and structure==
The Court of Augmentations was one of a number of financial courts established during Henry's reign. It was founded in 1536 to administer monastic properties and revenues confiscated by the crown at the dissolution of the monasteries.  The court had its own chancellor, treasurer, lawyers, receivers and auditors.

In 1547, the Court of Augmentations was amalgamated with the Court of General Surveyors, which had been established in 1542 to administer crown lands. In 1554, the roles of the Courts of Augmentations, General Surveyors, and First Fruits and Tenths were taken over by the Exchequer.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/palaeography/doc6/default.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1536, religious establishments with annual incomes of less than £200 per annum were dissolved. The attention of Henry and his chief minister [[Thomas Cromwell]] turned to the friaries in 1537, and thereafter to the rest of the religious houses. By 1540, they had all gone, the last to fall being [[Waltham Abbey (abbey)|Waltham Abbey]] in [[Essex]]. Their lands, properties and incomes went to the Crown.

Some of the monastic buildings remained in religious use – Henry allowed some monasteries to be refounded as secular cathedrals served by dean and chapter instead of priors and monks, and in rare cases the church buildings, or parts of them, were bought by locals to act as the parish church. Generally, however, the properties and lands were simply sold off to wealthy lay people, with the Court of Augmentations set up to deal with the spoils.

On the annexation of the Court of Augmentations to the Exchequer in 1554, the twelve receiverships of land revenues of the counties of England and Wales in the employment of the former were incorporated in the latter. 

Until the [[English Restoration|Restoration]] in 1660, appointments were made by the Crown by letters patent under the great seal. Unless otherwise indicated these were for life. While in some cases this practice was followed into the eighteenth century, appointments were increasingly made by other means, for example by letters patent under the seal of the Exchequer, by the Treasury, the [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ac.uk/office/exchequer.html Office-Holders: Exchequer: Receivers of Land Revenues 1554-1832&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Procedures for sale of property==
Particulars for the sale of a property that came to the Crown at the dissolution of the monasteries were produced by the auditors (who were appraisers) of the Court of Augmentations of the King's Revenue, created in 1536.  The particulars would be produced in response to a warrant from the commissioners for the sale of Crown lands. A prospective purchaser of Crown land would return with the auditor's signed particular and have it rated (or reviewed and approved, sometimes with modifications) by the commissioners. The details of the rated particular would form the basis for the warrant authorizing the purchase. Particulars were usually prepared for the actual purchaser of the land. They described the nature of the land, its value, the purchase price and any restrictions on the sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/palaeography/doc6/default.htm The National Archives | Palaeography interactive tutorial | About document 5&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The media has suggested the possibility of a [[rough ride (police brutality)|rough ride]]—an unsanctioned practice where a handcuffed prisoner is placed without a seatbelt in an erratically driven vehicle—as a contributing factor in Gray's injury.&lt;ref name=donovan&gt;{{cite news|last1=Donovan|first1=Doug|last2=Puente|first2=Mark|title=Freddie Gray not the first to come out of Baltimore police van with serious injuries|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-gray-rough-rides-20150423-story.html#page=1|accessdate=April 28, 2015|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=April 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wusa"&gt;{{cite news|title = Baltimore police prisoner rough ride history|last1 = Broom|first1 = Scott|url = http://www.wusa9.com/videos/news/local/2015/04/24/26329441/|accessdate = April 29, 2015|publisher = WUSA 9|date = April 29, 2015|type = Video}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During Officer Goodson's trial, a prosecution witness testified that he "could not say" if there had been a rough ride, and the judge ruled that the prosecution had not presented evidence to back that assumption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/18/us/officers-murder-trial-in-freddie-gray-death-turns-on-rough-ride.html|title=Officer's Murder Trial in Freddie Gray Death Turns on 'Rough Ride'|date=June 18, 2016|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/06/23/us/baltimore-goodson-verdict-freddie-gray/index.html|title=Freddie Gray verdict: Baltimore officer who drove van not guilty on all charges|first=Ray Sanchez, Lawrence Crook III and Laura Ly|last=CNN|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department's seatbelt policy had been revised six days prior to Gray's arrest, in an attempt to protect detained individuals from serious injuries during transport. The policy was not followed in Gray's case. According to attorney Michael Davey, who represents at least one of the officers under investigation, the new rules were criticized by some.  He explained that in certain situations, like when a prisoner is combative, "It is not always possible or safe for officers to enter the rear of those transport vans that are very small, and this one was very small."&lt;ref name=LindermanBelt /&gt;

In the following week, according to the Gray family attorney, Gray suffered from total [[cardiopulmonary arrest]] at least once but was [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|resuscitated]] without ever regaining consciousness.  He remained in a coma, and underwent extensive surgery in an effort to save his life.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite news |title = Baltimore looks into Freddie Gray police custody death|url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/20/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-death/index.html|publisher = CNN|accessdate = April 22, 2015|date = April 20, 2015|last = McLaughlin|first = Eliott C.|last2 = Brumfield|first2 = Ben|last3 = Ford|first3 = Dana}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to his family, he lapsed into a coma with three fractured vertebrae, injuries to his [[Larynx|voice box]], and his spine 80% severed at his neck.

On April 30, 2015, Kevin Moore, one of the witnesses who filmed Gray's arrest, was arrested at gunpoint following what Moore described as "harassment and intimidation" by police. Moore stated he had cooperated with police, and gave over his video of Gray's arrest for investigation. He claimed, despite aiding in the investigation, his photo was made public by police, who asked the public to identify him because he was "wanted for questioning."  Moore said the police obviously knew who he was when they posted his photo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/the-man-who-filmed-freddie-gray-video-has-been-arrested-at-gunpoint-10217973.html|title = The Man Who Filmed Freddie Gray Video has been Arrested at Gunpoint|work = The Independent|accessdate = May 1, 2015|last = Hooton|first = Christopher|date = May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moore was released from custody the next day, but two other individuals who were arrested along with Moore remained in custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.rawstory.com/2015/05/man-who-recorded-freddie-grays-arrest-taken-into-custody-after-complaining-of-police-harassment/|title = Man who recorded Freddie Gray's arrest taken into custody after complaining of police harassment|publisher = rawstory.com|accessdate = May 2, 2015|last = Gettys|first = Travis|date = May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day as Moore's arrest, medical examiners reported Gray sustained more injuries as a result of slamming into the inside of the transport van, "apparently breaking his neck; a head injury he sustained matches a bolt in the back of the van".&lt;ref name="cnn-injuryvan"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.cnn.com/2015/04/30/us/baltimore-freddie-gray-death-investigation/|title = Report: Freddie Gray sustained injury in back of police van|publisher = CNN|accessdate = May 1, 2015|date = May 1, 2015|last = McLaughlin|first = Eliott|last2 = Almasy|first2 = Steve|last3 = Yan|first3 = Holly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Charges, indictments, and trials ===
On May 1, 2015, after receiving a medical examiner's report ruling Gray's death a [[homicide]],&lt;ref name="Blinder.NYT"/&gt; state prosecutors said that they had probable cause to file criminal charges against the six officers involved. Mosby said that the Baltimore police had acted illegally and that "No crime had been committed" (by Freddie Gray).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/01/baltimore-freddie-gray-death |title= Freddie Gray death: cries of 'justice' in Baltimore after six officers charged |date= May 1, 2015 |access-date= May 1, 2015 |work= The Guardian |first1= Jon |last1=Swaine |first2= Oliver |last2=Laughland |first3= Raya |last3=Jalabi}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosby said that Gray "suffered a critical neck injury as a result of being handcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained inside the BPD wagon".&lt;ref name="NTY.Charged"&gt;{{cite news |title = 6 Baltimore Police Officers Charged in Freddie Gray Death|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/us/freddie-gray-autopsy-report-given-to-baltimore-prosecutors.html|accessdate = May 1, 2015|last = Blinder|first = Alan|last2 = Pérez-Peña|first2 = Richard|last3 = Fausset|first3 = Richard|date = May 1, 2015|last4 = White|first4 = Rebecca|last5 = Stolberg|first5 = Sheryl Gay}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2015/05/01/us-usa-police-baltimore-idUSKBN0NL1GO20150501|title = Six Baltimore police officers face murder, other charges in death of black man|agency = Reuters|accessdate = May 3, 2015|date = May 3, 2015|last = Malone|first = Scott|last2 = Simpson|first2 = Ian}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosby said officers had "failed to establish probable cause for Mr. Gray's arrest, as no crime had been committed",&lt;ref name="NYTimesCharges" /&gt; and charged officers with [[false imprisonment]], because Gray was carrying a [[pocket knife]] of legal size, and not the switchblade police claimed he had possessed at the time of his arrest.&lt;ref name="bbc-homicide"&gt;{{cite news |title=Freddie Gray: Baltimore police to face criminal charges|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-32554371|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=May 1, 2015|date=May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; All six officers were taken into custody and processed at Baltimore Central Booking and Intake Center.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-mosby-presser-0502-20150501-story.html#page=1|title = Six officers charged in death of Freddie Gray|work = The Baltimore Sun|accessdate = May 2, 2015|last = Marbella|first = Jean|date = May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three of the officers faced [[manslaughter]] charges and one faced an additional count of [[Murder#Degrees of murder by country|second degree]] [[depraved-heart murder]].

On September 2, 2015, it was decided to hold separate trials for the accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/baltimore-unrest/state-attorney-mosbys-acts-questioned-freddie-gray-hearing-n420341|accessdate = November 18, 2015|title = Six Cops in the Freddie Gray Case To Be Tried Separately|date = September 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, a Baltimore judge declared a mistrial  in the trial of Officer Porter after the jury was unable to reach a verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-35117901|accessdate = December 16, 2015|title = Baltimore judge declares mistrial in Freddie Gray case|date =December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, law professor [[John Banzhaf]] of George Washington University filed a complaint with the bar against Marilyn Mosby for prosecutorial misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=McCorkel|first1=Meghan|title=10 page complaint filed|url=http://baltimore.cbslocal.com/2016/06/30/10-page-complaint-filed-against-marilyn-mosby-over-freddie-gray-investigation/|website=Baltimore cbs local}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017,  a federal judge allowed a lawsuit by five of the six police officers unsuccessfully charged by Mosby.   Mosby was being sued for malicious prosecution, defamation, and invasion of privacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/freddie-gray/bs-md-ci-mosby-lawsuit-to-proceed-20170106-story.html|title=Freddie Gray case: Judge allows malicious prosecution lawsuit against Mosby to proceed|last=Fenton|first=Justin|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=2018-02-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Response to charges====
Mayor [[Stephanie Rawlings-Blake]] said there was no place in the Baltimore Police department for those police officers who "choose to engage in violence, brutality, [and] racism".&lt;ref name="NYTimesCharges"&gt;{{cite news |first1 = Alan|last1 = Blinder|first2 = Richard|last2 = Pérez-Peña|title = 6 Baltimore Police Officers Charged in Freddie Gray Death|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/02/us/freddie-gray-autopsy-report-given-to-baltimore-prosecutors.html|newspaper = The New York Times|accessdate = May 1, 2015|date = May 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene Ryan, president of the police union chapter said that despite the tragic situation, "none of the officers involved are responsible for the death of Mr. Gray."&lt;ref name=NYTimesCharges/&gt;

President [[Barack Obama]] said it was vital that the truth be found and supported protests if they were peaceful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Freddie Gray Death: Obama Says It's 'Absolutely Vital' to Get the Truth|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/baltimore-unrest/freddie-gray-death-obama-says-absolutely-vital-get-truth-n351991|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=May 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a May 4, 2015, interview on ''[[Fox News]]'', [[Alan Dershowitz]] said that he believes Mosby overcharged the officers in an attempt to satisfy protesters and prevent further disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://video.foxnews.com/v/4214828955001/justice-or-crowd-control-dershowitz-on-baltimore-charges/?#sp=show-clips|title=Justice or crowd control?

A motion for Mosby to recuse herself from the case was filed on behalf of the charged officers, on the alleged basis of personal gain by Mosby and her husband, personal relationships with potential witnesses, and the financial interest of Gray's attorney, who the motion claims is a close friend of Mosby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Motion filed to have Marilyn Mosby recuse herself |url=http://www.wbaltv.com/news/Motion-filed-to-have-Marilyn-Mosby-recuse-herself/32895776 |last=Lettis |first=George |publisher=WBALTV |accessdate=May 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CNN]]'s legal analyst [[Jeffrey Toobin]] pointed out that he does not see any serious conflict of interest to disqualify Mosby from the case, and that the officers may not have a case with that motion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Feldman |first=Josh |title=CNN's Toobin: Cops Don't Have a Case Against Marilyn Mosby |url=http://www.mediaite.com/tv/cnns-toobin-cops-dont-have-a-case-against-marilyn-mosby/ |publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyers representing the officers filed a motion insisting that the city must pay thousands of dollars in damages for arresting and detaining them—or else they could sue Mosby and the Mayor of Baltimore, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake.&lt;ref name="Guardian-2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Laughland |first=Oliver |date=May 8, 2015 |title=Baltimore: Freddie Gray police threaten to sue state's attorney Marilyn Mosby |work=The Guardian |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/may/08/baltimore-freddie-gray-police-threaten-to-sue-marilyn-mosby |accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 11-page rebuttal, Chief Deputy State's Attorney Michael Schatzow wrote that Gray was detained "well before the arresting officers knew he possessed a knife" and that the motion was absurdly "bounc[ing] from one ridiculous allegation to another, like a pinball on a machine far past 'TILT{{' "}}.&lt;ref name="prosecutor.response"&gt;{{cite news |title = Mosby's office: Defense attacks in Gray case 'like pinball on machine far past 'TILT'|url = http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-prosecutors-respond-20150519-story.html#page=1|work = The Baltimore Sun|accessdate = May 20, 2015|last = Fenton|date = May 19, 2015|first = Justin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mosby was ordered to respond to the motion filed by the defense attorneys by June 26, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-gray-motions-deadline-20150605-story.html|title=

=== Federal investigations ===
Attorney General [[Loretta Lynch]] announced on {{nowrap|May 8}}, 2015, that the [[United States Department of Justice|Department of Justice]] would conduct a review of the current practices of Baltimore Police Department on account of the "serious erosion of public trust" in relation to the circumstances of Gray's death.&lt;ref name="Newsweek.Lynch"&gt;{{cite news |title=Loretta Lynch Confirms Department of Justice Review of Baltimore Police|url=http://www.newsweek.com/loretta-lynch-confirms-department-justice-review-baltimore-police-329982|work=Newsweek|accessdate=May 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The review took effect immediately, and focused on allegations that Baltimore police officers use excessive force, including deadly force, conduct [[Search and seizure|unlawful searches, seizures]] or arrests, and engage in discriminatory policing.&lt;ref name="Newsweek.Lynch"/&gt;

{{as of|2015|May}}, Federal authorities were conducting three probes into Baltimore police, the "pattern of practice" investigation initiated by Lynch, a collaborative review that began in the fall of 2014, and a [[civil rights]] probe into the death of Gray.&lt;ref name="TBS.md-justice-announce"&gt;{{cite news |title=After Freddie Gray death, U.S. starts civil rights probe of Baltimore police|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-city/bs-md-justice-announce-20150508-story.html#page=1|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=May 11, 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160307105108/http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/bs-md-justice-announce-20150508-story.html |archivedate=March 7, 2016 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Diogo Bernardes Theatre''' ({{lang-pt|Teatro Diogo Bernardes}}) is a [[theatre]] in the [[Freguesia|civil parish]] of [[Arca e Ponte de Lima]], in the [[Concelho|municipality]] of [[Ponte de Lima]], in the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] [[Porto (district)|district of Porto]].

==History==
On 19 February 1893, the theatre commission, that included João Rodrigues de Morais, Francisco António da Cunha Magalhães and Dr. António Inácio Pereira de Freitas, decided to acquired a plot of land, that was formerly occupied by the former-Convent of Santo António dos Frades Capuchos, an area of {{convert|1500|m2|ft2}}. for 1.200$000 [[Portuguese real|réis]].&lt;ref name="SIPA"&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.monumentos.pt/Site/APP_PagesUser/SIPA.aspx?id=22414 |title=Teatro Diogo Bernardes (IPA.00022414/PT011607350050) |publisher=SIPA – Sistema de Informação para o Património Arquitectónico |editor=SIPA |location=Lisbon, Portugal |language=Portuguese |first=Paulo |last=Amaral |year=2001 |accessdate=10 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A year later work began on building the Theatre Diogo Bernardes, a project of architect António Adelino de Magalhães Coutinho, with the stonework completed by António Pereira Correia, the carpentry by José Maria da Cunha and painting by Eduardo Reis.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

Inauguration of the theatre occurred on 19 September 1896.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The first presentation of films at the theatre began in 1920.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The building was acquired by the municipal council of Ponta de Lima for 50,000 contos in 1992, following several years of degradation and abandon.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; In 1996, work to remodel and expansion of the theatre (under architect Luís Faro Viana), a project financed partially by the Ministry of Culture for 390,000 contos.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; Between 1996 and 1999, there were further projects to bring the theatre up to code, that included lighting, roofing, consolidation of walls, installation of fire safety equipment and construction of handicap accessways. At the same time, the stage was expanded, along with the mezzanine and booth seating.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The Teatro Diogo Bernardes became the home of the Ponte de Lima Festival of Opera and Classical Music.

==Architecture==
The theatre is flanked and integrated into the centre of the town in an area of paved stonework and granite structure, behind the Church of Santo António dos Capuchos, near the [[Lima River]] and along the ''Avenida dos Plátanos''.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The principal facade is preceded by a platform of granite slabs accessible by three stairs, and flanked by two iron gates between granite pilasters.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt;

The longitudinal plan is composed of two rectangular wings, with one higher than the other, with a "L"-shaped section addorsed in the northeast and northwest, covered in differentiated tiles and metal sheeting.&lt;ref name=SIPA/&gt; The facades are decorated and painted white, encircled by salient cornice.

A '''disaster draft''' or '''contingency draft''' is a [[disaster recovery plan]] developed by professional sports leagues to rebuild a team's [[Schedule (workplace)|roster]] if many players are disabled or killed.

==Background==
{{see|List of accidents involving sports teams}}
Since the advent of modern mass transportation, there have been accidents that killed all or nearly all members of various sports teams. The [[Superga air disaster|1949 Torino Football Club]] had only [[Sauro Tomà|one survivor]] following a plane crash.  Two teams in the [[Canadian Football League]] lost players, returning from an all-star game, in the 1956 crash of [[Trans-Canada Air Lines Flight 810]].

Other air incidents since then have involved the [[Munich Air Disaster|1958 Manchester United football team]], [[Cal Poly football team plane crash|1960 Cal Poly football team]], [[Los Angeles Lakers#1959–1968: Move to Los Angeles and Celtics rivalry|1960 Minneapolis Lakers basketball team]] (no fatalities), [[Sabena Flight 548|1961 United States figure skating team]], [[Wichita State University football team plane crash|1970 Wichita State University football team]], [[Southern Airways Flight 932|1970 Marshall University football team]], [[Evansville basketball plane crash|1977 University of Evansville basketball team]], [[LOT Polish Airlines Flight 007|1980 United States boxing team]], [[1993 Zambia national football team air disaster|1993 Zambia national football team]], [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash|2011 Lokomotiv Yaroslavl ice hockey team]], and the [[LaMia Airlines Flight 2933|2016 Associação Chapecoense de Futebol team (Brasil)]].

As a result of these accidents, some professional sports leagues have developed [[disaster recovery plan]]s should such an incident befall one or more of their teams.

==Special procedures==
An affected team is expected to replace players using the [[minor leagues]] and by signing [[free agent]]s.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"&gt;Eskenazi, Gerald. "[https://www.nytimes.com/1992/05/22/sports/baseball-the-plans-no-one-wants-to-use.html The Plans No One Wants to Use]." ''[[The New York Times]]'', 22 May 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Each league, however, has established procedures to decide whether an accident is of sufficient scale to activate contingency plans to help rebuild an affected team's roster, typically involving a special [[draft (sports)|draft]].

===Major League Baseball===
Major League Baseball's disaster plan is covered in Rule 29 of its [[Baseball business rules|official rules]].&lt;ref name="MLBRules"&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The plan is triggered by an event causing the death, dismemberment, or permanent disability of at least five players from a team's active, disabled, or suspended roster during a season (including the playoffs), or at least six players during the off-season. Major League Baseball's commissioner will decide if the disabled club can continue play, in consultation with the MLB Players' Association and the club.

If the commissioner decides that the disabled club will continue to play, the commissioner may hold a Restocking Draft to allow the disabled club to select as many players as it lost, with the restriction that no more than one player can be selected from each team. Each of the non-disabled teams makes five players available for the draft taken from its active list (or if during the off-season, from its reserve list), composed of one pitcher, one catcher, one outfielder, one infielder, and one more player of any position, subject to adjustments by the commissioner based on the players lost by the disabled club. If a team has fewer than three eligible catchers, it does not have to provide a catcher to the draft. The non-disabled teams also are required to make available as many players with 60 or more days of Major League service time as of 31 August of the season preceding such draft as the number of such players lost by the disabled team.&lt;ref&gt;Major League Rules 29(b)(3)(A)(iii)'' Service. Subject to paragraph (b)(3)(A)(i) above, each Club that is not a Disabled Club shall include in its list of available players for a Restocking Draft at least as many players who have accrued no less than 60 days of Major League service time as of 31 August of the season preceding such Restocking Draft as the Disabled Club lost.''&lt;/ref&gt; Any player with no-trade rights with regards to the disabled team may not be made available unless the player waives the right.

If the commissioner decides that the disabled club cannot continue play, the commissioner will cancel the disabled club's season.

The commissioner and Players' Association can also agree upon other appropriate relief for a disabled club.

Major League Baseball's first [[expansion draft]]s of the early 1960s were based largely on the procedures first set out for the disaster draft.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

===National Basketball Association===
The [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA) contingency plan activates if five or more players on a team "die or are dismembered".&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn2001"&gt;Drehs, Wayne. "[http://espn.go.com/gen/s/2001/0328/1163463.html 'God forbid it should ever be needed']." [[ESPN.com]], 10 April 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; A special "disaster draft" would be held in which other NBA teams could only protect five players,&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} so that quality [[sixth man|sixth men]] would be available. No more than one player would be drafted from a team.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;

===National Football League===
The [[National Football League]] (NFL)'s contingency plan provides for both a "near-disaster" and a "disaster".&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt; A "near-disaster" is defined as fewer than 15 players on a team being disabled, and a "disaster" is 15 or more.&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mizell20010923"&gt;{{Cite news|last=Mizell|first=Hubert|title=Several pro teams have airline disaster plans in place|url=http://www.sptimes.com/News/092301/Columns/Several_pro_teams_hav.shtml|accessdate=2010-09-14|newspaper=St. Petersburg Times|date=23 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

No special draft would be held for a "near-disaster"; the team would instead get preferential rights on any [[waivers (American football)|waivers]] until the end of the season.&lt;ref name="nydn2001"&gt;O'Keeffee, Michael. "[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2001/02/04/2001-02-04_just_plane_scary__oklahoma_s.html JUST PLANE SCARY Oklahoma State crash causes high anxiety] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090506023513/http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/sports/2001/02/04/2001-02-04_just_plane_scary__oklahoma_s.html |date=6 May 2009 }}." ''[[New York Daily News]]'', 4 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} If a [[quarterback]] is among the fewer than 15 lost, the team would be able to draft up to two&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; quarterbacks from all NFL teams with three available. Each team would be able to protect two, and the drafted quarterbacks would return to their original teams in the following season.&lt;ref name="nydn2001"/&gt;

For a "disaster", the [[NFL Commissioner|commissioner]] would determine whether to cancel the team's schedule for the season.&lt;ref name="nydn2001"/&gt; If the team's season is canceled, the team would have the first pick in the next regular [[NFL Draft|draft]];&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nydn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} a special draft would also be held in which each team would be able to protect 32 players. If not canceled, the "near-disaster" procedures would be used.&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt;&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}}

===National Hockey League===
The [[National Hockey League]] (NHL) contingency plan activates if five or more players&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}} on a team "are killed or disabled".&lt;ref name="nyt1992"/&gt; The team would select players from other NHL teams, paying with funds from a special insurance fund. Once its roster has one [[goaltender]] and 14 other players, a special draft involving the teams unaffected by the earlier selection could be held, with each team able to protect one goaltender and 10 other players.&lt;ref name="espn2001"/&gt;{{r|mizell20010923}}

===Major League Soccer===
Within its roster regulations, [[Major League Soccer]] has what it refers to as an "extreme hardship" provision, which can be used if "a team has less than 15 available players". However, this is a mechanism intended to be used on a "game-by-game basis", and any contingency plans that may exist for a disaster draft scenario are not public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mlssoccer.com/2011-mls-roster-rules |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430101816/http://www.mlssoccer.com/2011-mls-roster-rules |archivedate=30 April 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Kontinental Hockey League===
The [[Kontinental Hockey League]] (KHL) contingency plan was implemented after the [[Lokomotiv Yaroslavl plane crash]] that killed the team's entire traveling roster. In the policy, each team makes three players eligible for the disaster draft, with the team that suffered the disaster being able to call up five players from its farm teams. There is no mention of a goaltender minimum for the draft, unlike the NFL disaster draft on quarterbacks or NHL disaster draft on goaltenders, or a mention of a team being able to surrender only one player, unlike other leagues, in the draft.&lt;ref&gt;National Post, [http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/09/08/khl-delays-games-but-season-will-go-on-for-lokomotiv/ "KHL delays games, but season will go on for Lokomotiv"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120605051818/http://sports.nationalpost.com/2011/09/08/khl-delays-games-but-season-will-go-on-for-lokomotiv/ |date=5 June 2012 }}, Peter Leonard, 8 September 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The afflicted team will have a spot in the draft lottery, thus guaranteeing that the team will pick at least as high as 4th overall in the next [[KHL Junior Draft]] and it will also be able to protect any player it wants for the next five entry drafts.

'''Electromagnetic Field''' (also known as '''EMF''', or '''EMF Camp''') is a camping festival in the UK, held every two years, for [[Hacker (hobbyist)|hackers]], [[geeks]], [[engineers]] and [[scientists]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-08/20/electromagnetic-field |title=Inquisitive minds gather to camp out in the Electromagnetic Field |publisher=Wired |first=Ian |last=Steadman |date=20 August 2012 |accessdate=26 August 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140827032015/http://www.wired.co.uk/news/archive/2012-08/20/electromagnetic-field |archivedate=27 August 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It features talks and workshops covering a wide variety of topics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emfcamp.org/talks EMF Camp talks]&lt;/ref&gt; EMF is a non-profit event run entirely by a team of volunteers.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emfcamp.org/about/company About Electromagnetic Field]&lt;/ref&gt;

Attendees of EMF receive an electronic conference badge, funded by sponsorship, which in 2014 included an LCD screen, [[Arduino]]-compatible microcontroller, and a radio transceiver. &lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.emfcamp.org/post/94157161753/announcing-tilda-mke-the-incredible-emf-2014-camp Announcing TiLDA MKe, the incredible EMF 2014 camp badge]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Overhead view of Electromagnetic Field 2012.jpg|thumb|left|Overhead view of Electromagnetic Field 2012]]
The first Electromagnetic Field event was held in 2012 at Pineham Park, near [[Milton Keynes]], and completely sold out a 499-person capacity. Each tent at EMF 2012 was provided with power and the internet, via a 2.5&amp;nbsp;km direct microwave link to a data centre&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-19441861 BBC News: Geek camp comes to Milton Keynes]&lt;/ref&gt; which provided 370 Mbit/s&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.emfcamp.org/post/27143646219/emf-camp-the-site-and-networking EMF Camp, the site and Networking]&lt;/ref&gt; to the campsite. Over 50 speakers gave talks, including [[Ben Goldacre]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emfcamp.org/talks/2012 EMF 2012 Programme]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a smaller interim one-day event called Electromagnetic Wave was held in London on board the [[Stubnitz_(ship)|MS Stubnitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.emfcamp.org/wave|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514114401/https://www.emfcamp.org/wave|title=Electromagnetic Wave|archive-date=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main event was held again in 2014 at Hounslow Hall Estate, again near [[Milton Keynes]]. Over 1,200 tickets were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-29011889|title=Electromagnetic Field: Can geeks get kids into science?|publisher=BBC|first=Dougal|last=Shaw|date=2 September 2014|accessdate=4 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; As with the 2012 event, internet was provided by a direct microwave link which provided 436 Mbit/s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.emfcamp.org/post/95545988673/megabits-to-a-farm-getting-internet-to-a-hacker-camp EMF Camp, megabits to a farm]&lt;/ref&gt; The entire event had over 100 talks, workshops and events with a separate track for children. Notable speakers included [[Tom Watson (Labour politician)|Tom Watson MP]] and [[Simon Singh]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.emfcamp.org/talks/2014 EMF 2014 Programme]&lt;/ref&gt; In addition there were 45 'villages'&lt;ref&gt;[https://wiki.emfcamp.org/wiki/Villages EMF wiki, Villages]&lt;/ref&gt; that ran their own workshops and events including silver smithing, wood turning and making [[stroopwafel]]s.

Electromagnetic Field 2016 was held on August 5-7, 2016 at [[Loseley Park]], Guildford&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet |user=emfcamp |number=642046720965255168 |date=10 September 2015 |title=We're very excited to announce the date and location for EMF 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an attendance of over 1,600. The 1 Gbit/s internet connection was provided by fibre, and the on-site network had a 10 Gbit/s backbone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://github.com/emfcamp/emfnoc/blob/master/archives/2016/documents/EMF_2016_Infrastructure_Review.pdf EMF 2016 Infrastructure Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

Electromagnetic Field 2018 was held on August 31-September 2, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite tweet|user=emfcamp|number=894883262983802880|date=8 August 2017|title=If you enjoyed #SHA2017, why not come to EMF 2018, Aug 31 - Sep 2, 2018 in the lovely west of England.

The attendance was 2,500.

==Synchronization with other events==

In the years when Electromagnetic Field does not occur, [[Chaos Communication Camp]] (in [[Germany]]) and one of the [[Hack-Tic#Hack-Tic_hacker_events|Hack-Tic hacker events]] (in the [[Netherlands]]) occur alternately.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6559">The '''FIA Sportscar Championship''' was a [[sports car racing]] series created by John Mangoletsi and was eventually taken control of by the [[Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile]] (FIA).  It was a series similar to the [[FIA GT Championship]], concentrating on two classes of open-cockpit [[sports prototype]]s in endurance races mostly around Europe. The series was folded after the 2003 season.

==History==
Following the demise of the [[World Sportscar Championship]] in [[1992 World Sportscar Championship|1992]], Europe was left without a major sportscar series.  In the [[United States]] however, attempts were underway to recreate the glory of the World Sportscar Championship with the [[International Motor Sports Association|IMSA]] GTP series returning to cheaper, open-cockpit sportscars to replace their highly technological and expensive closed-cockpit sportscars that were similar to those used in the World Sportscar Championship at its end.  Following on this successful formula, in 1997 John Mangoletsi developed the '''International Sports Racing Series''', a European-based series for open-cockpit sportscars. It would be supported by major teams like Rafanelli, [[Riley &amp; Scott]], Kremer Racing, [[Joest Racing]] and Konrad Motorsport and by manufacturers such as [[Ferrari]], which was having success with its new [[Ferrari 333 SP|333 SP]] sports racer.

The International Sports Racing Series was open to Sportscars complying with either FIA SR1 or FIA SR2 regulations. The SR1 class was for cars with engines limited to a maximum capacity of 6000cc if naturally aspirated or 4000cc if supercharged. The SR2 class was for cars with production based engines limited to a maximum of six cylinders and a maximum capacity of 3000cc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.totalmotorsport.com/Info/Regs/Display.asp?ID=17 Technical Regulations for the 2002 FIA Sportscar Championship] Retrieved from www.totalmotorsport.com on 2 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  The SR1 cars were similar to those contesting the LMP Class in the [[24 Hours of Le Mans]] while the SR2 cars were similar to cars in the CN class as used in [[Hillclimbing|hillclimb]] events. In 1999, the series was officially recognized by the FIA and renamed the '''Sports Racing World Cup'''.  Ferrari's success with the 333SP was proven with a large number of entrants making it the chassis of choice in SR1, while [[Riley &amp; Scott]], [[Lola Cars|Lola]], and other manufacturers attempted to overcome the dominant marque, Ferrari.

In 2001, the series was officially taken over by the FIA and renamed as the FIA Sportscar Championship and it continued to expand into new markets, including a partnership with [[Grand-Am Road Racing|Grand American]] in the United States. This partnership involved share races and, eventually, common regulations. With the creation of the [[American Le Mans Series]] in 1999 and the [[2001 European Le Mans Series|European Le Mans Series]] in 2001, the FIA Sportscar Championship found it increasingly difficult to attract top teams and manufacturers. Grand American changed to adapt to this shift in sportscar design with their dropping of the SRP1 class and the phasing out of the SRP2 class (eliminated in 2004) in 2003.  By that time the FIA Sportscar Championship was suffered from a declining number of entries, leading to its demise at the end of the 2003 season.  The FIA chose instead to back the new [[European Le Mans Series|Le Mans Endurance Series]] that debuted in [[2004 Le Mans Series|2004]], ensuring the continuation of Sportscar racing in Europe.

'''Game On''' is the first major international touring exhibition to explore the history and culture of computer games. The exhibition was first shown at the [[Barbican Centre]] in 2002 and has since been toured by Barbican International Enterprises to over 20 countries worldwide. It has been seen by over 2 million people across the globe.

Focusing on key game developments from the early sixties to the present day, Game On explores gaming’s fascinating past and infinitely innovative future. From the [[PDP-1|PDP–1]] in 1960 to contemporary industry releases, the exhibition examines the creative and scientific advances that have revolutionised the games we play.

Game On reveals the design processes behind four of the most significant games of recent times: [[Tomb Raider]], [[Grand Theft Auto]], [[Pokémon (video game series)|Pokémon]] and [[The Sims]], following these games all the way from their initial concept to the final product design.

With over 150 playable games including [[Donkey Kong]], [[Pong]] and [[Rock Band (video game)|Rock Band]]- as well as the top ten most influential consoles – the exhibition is a truly interactive experience. Games and consoles are constantly updated to ensure the exhibition is always reflective of current movements and trends.

Game On aims to highlight the wider, global framework of gaming, exploring the influence of manga and anime on computer games, as well as the films that have been influenced by, and continue to influence computer games. The exhibition further delves into the worlds of online gaming, music compositions for games, as well as the latest game technologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Barbican International Enterprises - Touring Exhibitions|url = http://www.barbican.org.uk/bie/game-on|website = www.barbican.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hag ha-Gez''' or '''Re´shit ha-Gez''' was the biblical festival or celebration of the shearing of the sheep.

Hag ha-Gez took place once a year, at the beginning of the spring, once the winter cold was gone. Although lacking the liturgical importance of the pilgrim festivals related to the harvest of cereals at the beginning of the agricultural season or to the harvest of grapes and the ingathering of fruits at the end of the period, the shearing of the sheep was, nonetheless, a memorable convivium that brought together people of different localities to enjoy banquets "fit for royalty". The "first fruits of the shearing of the flock" were entitlements of the priests, just as it were the first fruits of grain, wine and oil and portions of the animals sacrificed.

No specific celebration of the shearing of the sheep takes place in present-day [[Israel]] (The attempts at [[kibbutzim]] to introduce any new kind of agricultural festival of secular nature haven´t succeeded). The possibility exists, however, that [[Lag BaOmer]], a joyful celebration of obscure origin and forgotten meaning, observed since [[Geonic]] times in mid-spring and in which highly religious [[Jews]] give their three-year-old boys their first haircut, could somehow echo the ancient event.

The '''Interceltic Festival of Avilés''' (FIA) is a summer arts festival held annually in [[Avilés]], and the surrounding area in [[Asturias]], Spain since 1997. The festival is held to promote the cultural traditions, and developments, of the [[Celtic nations]] (países [[celts|celtes]] in Asturias), especially [[music]] and [[dance]], as well as [[painting]], [[photography]], [[theatre]], [[sculpture]], traditional [[Artisan|craftsmanship]], [[sport]] and [[gastronomy]]. It is organized by the ''Cultural Association Esbardu'', located in Avilés.&lt;ref name="ESBARDU34"&gt;

==Background==
The idea of a festival in Avilés arose after the [[Festival Interceltique de Lorient]] in 1993 when members of Esbardu took part in that festival. They started working on a similar (although smaller) idea in Avilés. In the summer of 1997 the project received a small budget from the Asturian regional government and another one from Avilés Town Hall. The festival was held again in the following year.

In 2006, 1,175 people took part in the festival with 150 acts and performances over eleven days. There were 800 musicians, dancers and actors in the parade. In 2008 it was officially named by the Regional Authorities of the [[Principality]] of Asturies, as the ''"Fiesta de Interés Turístico Regional"''(Celebration of Regional Tourist Interest).&lt;ref name="LNE630308"&gt;

  | accessdate = 12 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2010 choirs from [[Wales]] participated in the festival, namely The Port Talbot Cymric Male Choir and Cor Meibion Y Fflint (Flint Male Voice Choir). The 'Cymric' as it is known, was the first Welsh male voice choir to perform at the 'Festival Interceltique de Lorient' and performed again in 1978. The choir was again invited to Lorient in 1992. Flint have appeared at Lorient five times as well as Interceltic Festivals in Nantes and Paris. They were winners of the Male Voice Choir competition in the 2007 ''[[Côr Cymru]]'', and finalists again in 2009.

== Venue ==
The festival takes place in the [[Comarca de Avilés]], in Asturias, between [[Cabo Peñas]] and the mouth of the [[Nalón (river)|Nalón]] river. [[Avilés]], [[Castrillón]], [[Corvera de Asturias|Corvera]] and [[Illas]] are the members of the ''[[Avilés (Asturian comarca)|Comarca]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fia.esbardu.org/?page_id=34 Festival Intercéltico de Avilés y comarca] by A.C.

The Australian '''Intervarsity Choral Festival''' is an annual event in which members of university choirs from all [[States and territories of Australia|state]] capitals of [[Australia]] and the national capital [[Canberra]] meet for two weeks to rehearse, socialise and perform combined concerts. The Festival also serves as the annual conference of the member choirs of AICSA, the '''Australian Intervarsity Choral Societies Association'''

== Overview ==
The festival is hosted by the AICSA choirs in a particular city on a rotational basis, the roster being maintained by AICSA's governing body, the Australian Intervarsity Choral Council (AIVCC).  Most IVCFs have involved between 100 and 300 festival participants (choristers), who perform one to three concerts over the course of about two weeks, often accompanied by a major symphonic orchestra.

An example is the festival in 2008.  IVCF was hosted by the [[Sydney University Musical Society]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sums.aicsa.org.au/ Sydney University Musical Society], Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; in association with other university choirs including [[Macquarie University Singers]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mus.aicsa.org.au/ Macquarie University Singers], Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Music Society of the University of Technology (Sydney)]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.muscuts.aicsa.org.au/ Music Society of the University of Technology (Sydney)], Australia.&lt;/ref&gt; and performed a concert of English works including [[Thomas Tallis]]' 40-part [[motet]] ''[[Spem in alium|Spem in Alium]]'' and [[Ralph Vaughan Williams]]' ''[[Serenade to Music]]'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siv.org.au/content/view/18/56/ SIV2008], Australia. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219103406/http://www.siv.org.au/content/view/18/56/ |date=19 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and one of Australian works including a commission from [[Anne Boyd]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.siv.org.au/content/view/16/54/ SIV2008], Australia. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071219103404/http://www.siv.org.au/content/view/16/54/ |date=19 December 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (see Promotion of Australian Composition below).

== History ==
The first Australian InterVarsity Choral Festival took place in 1950 when the [[Sydney University Musical Society]] (SUMS) hosted the [[Melbourne University Choral Society]] (MUCS) for a week-long rehearsal camp culminating in a combined concert. Other university choirs joined over the years, with all State and Territory capitals (except [[Darwin, Northern Territory|Darwin]] in the [[Northern Territory]]) having at least one member choir by 1973. The IVCF has since become the largest regularly occurring choral festival in Australia.

From 1975 on, when the 26th IVCF performed [[Giuseppe Verdi|Verdi]]'s ''[[Requiem (Verdi)|Requiem]]'' in the then recently opened [[Sydney Opera House]], IVCFs have striven to perform large-scale works to high standards with professional orchestras where appropriate and available. The 37th IVCF ([[Brisbane]], 1986) was the first to work with its state's peak professional orchestra, the then [[Queensland Symphony Orchestra]], the major work on the program being [[Herbert Howells]]' ''[[Hymnus Paradisi]]''. Two years later (1988), to celebrate Australia's bicentennial, the 39th IVCF collaborated with the [[Sydney Philharmonia Choirs|Sydney Philharmonia]] and the [[Sydney Symphony Orchestra]] under the baton of [[Charles Dutoit]] to perform [[Symphony No. 8 (Mahler)|Mahler's Symphony number 8 ("Symphony of a Thousand")]], again in the Sydney Opera House.

More recently, the 55th IVCF ([[Perth, Western Australia|Perth]], 2004) took part in the [[Perth International Arts Festival]]&lt;ref&gt;

==Promotion of Australian composition==
IVCFs have a long if intermittent tradition of performance of works by Australian composers. At least sixteen performances since 1962 have included works commissioned by the festival, including ''Blue Gum Forest'', composed by [[Matthew Orlovich]] for the 60th IVCF in 2009, ''Missa Pacifica'' by [[Anne Boyd]], commissioned for the Sydney IVCF in 2008, and [[David Cassat]]'s "Flesh to Stone" for semichorus and divisi main chorus, commissioned by the 56th IVCF ([[Melbourne]]) in 2005.

Many other InterVarsity Choral Festivals have included premiere performances of works, including [[Paul Stanhope]]'s "Pirramimma" for three choirs and string ensemble, performed in 2007 in [[Brisbane]] through a collaboration between the 58th IVCF and the Bonyi International Youth Festival.

== Australian Intervarsity Choral Societies Association ==

The organization behind the IVCF is the Australian Intervarsity Choral Societies Association (AICSA), which is a non-profit that represents each of the affiliated local choirs, with a purpose of encouraging choral music within tertiary academic settings. While officially formed in 1973, organizational cooperation to create the IVCF has existed since 1950.  Since being officially formed, AICSA has acquired an increased role. Today, besides assisting in the organisation of the festival, it sponsors a database catalogue of music held by individual choirs, archives at the [[National Library of Australia]], and internet resources via aicsa.org.au.&lt;ref&gt;

==History of the Festival==
Kamaun University in the year 2016 initiated a few unconventional courses; filmmaking was one among them. The film faculty comprised Rajesh Shah, a Mumbai-based cinematographer who had returned to his home in the hills to dedicate his time to teaching, along with his wife, National Film Award-winning documentary filmmaker Shalini Shah. Before the end of the year, the duo along with their first batch of 14 students decided to host a tiny student film festival. It was organised by CEFM–The Hermitage, Kumaun University, in association with HIMACEEF.

The inaugural edition was a success and the second edition,&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 8, 2018  |title= Kautik International Student Film Festival shuru |trans-title= Kautik International Student Film Festival begins |url= |language= Hindi |work= Aaj |location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 8, 2018  |title=Sarovar nagari mein film festival shuru |trans-title= Film festival begins at the lake city|url= |language= Hindi |work= Uttar Ujala|location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 8, 2018  |title= Vishwavidyalaya mein antarashtriya film festival shuru |trans-title= International film festival begins at the university |url= |language= Hindi |work= Amar Ujala |location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 8, 2018 |page=|title= Nainital mein international student film festival ka aaghaz |trans-title= International student film festival commences at Nainital |url= |language= Hindi |work= Dainik Jagran |location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 9, 2018  |title=Film festival mein dikhayi 20 se zyada filmein |trans-title= Film festival screens more than 20 films|url= |language= Hindi |work=Aaj |location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 9, 2018  |title= International fest mein dusre din dikhayi 25 filmein|trans-title= 25 films screened on the second day of the international festival |url= |language= Hindi |work= Hindustan|location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |date= April 9, 2018|page=  |title= Film nirmar: madhyam aur budget ab badha nahi|trans-title= Film making: medium and budget not an obstacle anymore|url= |language= Hindi |work= Rashtriya Sahara|location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 9, 2018|title=Vidyarthiyon ki banayi film ka pradarshan |trans-title= Screening of films made by students |url= |language= Hindi |work= Utar Ujala |location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|date= April 9, 2018 | title= International film fest: 60 movies from 12 countries to be showcased |work= The Times of India|location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India |url= https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/dehradun/intl-film-fest-60-movies-from-12-countries-to-be-showcased/articleshow/63671241.cms }}&lt;/ref&gt; was immensely scaled up: it ran for 10 days in all, included a 5-day [[Film and Television Institute of India|FTII]] film appreciation camp&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news|date= April 9, 2018 |page=  |title=Chatron ne jaane TV, web, film nirman ke gur |trans-title= Knowledge of TV, web and filmmaking imparted to participants |language= Hindi |work= Amar Ujala |location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 12, 2018 |page= 5 |title= Kalakaron ko batayi film banana ki barikiyan |trans-title= Subtleties of filmmaking taught to artists |language= Hindi |work= Utar Ujala |location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 12, 2018 |page= 6 |title= Nainital mein yuvaon ko diye film nirman ke tips |trans-title= Participants offered filmmaking tips  |language= Hindi| work= Hindustan | location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt; {{cite news |date= April 12, 2018 |page= |title= Chatra se buzurg tak sabne seekhi film banana ki barikiyan |trans-title= Nuances of filmmaking taught to youngsters and senior citizens |language= Hindi |work= Amar Ujala | location= Nainital, Uttarakhand, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was international and competitive, and featured a [[Film Critics Circle of India]] citation.

'''Lee Seung-bok''',({{lang-ko|이승복}}) was a 9- to 10-year-old South Korean boy murdered by North Korean commandos in December 1968. His murder was widely publicised throughout South Korea. In the early 1990s it was claimed that Lee had never existed and that his death was the creation of South Korean propaganda.

==Early life==
Lee Seung-bok was the second of four children of Lee Seok-woo and Joo Dae-ha and was raised on their farm in a remote location on the north of [[Gyebangsan (Gangwon)|Gyebang mountain]].

==Death==
On the night of 30 October 1968, 120 members of [[Unit 124]] of the [[Korean People's Army]] [[Korean DMZ Conflict (1966–69)#Ulchin-Samcheok landings|landed]] at 8 separate locations between [[Ulchin]] – [[Samcheok]] in [[Gangwon-do (South Korea)|Gangwon province]] and moved inland on a 30-day mission to create guerilla bases in the [[Taebaek Mountains]]. On the morning of 31 October they entered several villages and began indoctrinating the villagers, several of whom slipped away to alert the authorities. [[Republic of Korea Army]] forces soon arrived in the area and began hunting down the infiltrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Bolger|first=Daniel|title=Scenes from an Unfinished War: Low intensity conflict in Korea 1966–1969|publisher=Diane Publishing Co|isbn=978-0-7881-1208-9|year=1991|page=Chapter 3 The Ulchin-Samcheok Landings}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the night of 9 December several North Korean commandos burst into the Lee household demanding food and shelter. The North Koreans asked Lee Seung-bok if he preferred North Korea or South Korea, when he replied South Korea the North Koreans began to beat him. Lee then said "I hate Communists," this enraged the North Koreans who proceeded to kill Lee, his mother Joo Dae-ha (33), younger brother Lee Seung-su (7) and younger sister Lee Seung-Ja (4). Lee's father Lee Seok-woo and older brother Lee Hak-gwan managed to escape from the house and raised the alarm. The North Koreans proceeded to mutilate Lee Seung-bok's face by giving him a half [[Glasgow smile]]. The North Koreans fled the Lee house and were never identified, but they may have been among the 113 members of Unit 124 killed by South Korean forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.donga.com/srv/service.php3?biid=2014082998708|title=Lonely funeral of Lee Seung-bok’s father|publisher=Dong-A Ilbo|date=August 29, 2014|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in South Korean propaganda==
The murders of Lee Seung-bok and his family were widely publicised in South Korea by the [[Park Chung-hee]] regime to mobilise anti-Communist/North Korean sentiment. Numerous statues of Lee were erected across South Korea including in the [[Children's Grand Park]] and [[War Memorial of Korea]] in Seoul and his story was taught in schools until the late 1980s.

In the early 1990s rumours began to circulate that Lee never existed and the story of his murder had been created by propaganda units of the South Korean military governments. In July 1999 prosecutors charged Kim Ju-eon the former general secretary of the People's Coalition for Media Reform with defamation after he included the December 11, 1968 ''[[The Chosun Ilbo]]'' report, entitled, "I Don't Like the Communist Party. A Young Mouth of Resistance Torn," in an "Exhibition of Misreporting" and called the reports of the incident a lie. In September 2002, Kim was found guilty and was sentenced to 6-months in prison. In October 2004, the Seoul Central District Court sentenced Kim to six months prison and two years probation for "spreading false facts" and concluded that the incident had taken place and that the media reports at the time were accurate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2004/10/28/2004102861020.html|title=Report of Ghastly 1968 Murder of Boy by N. Koreans Was True|publisher=Chosun Ilbo|date=October 28, 2004|accessdate=September 30, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
The Lee Seung-bok Memorial Center {{nobold|이승복 기념관}} was established in 1982 south of Lee's home in Nodong-ri, Gangwon, South Korea {{coord|37|40|19.69|N|128|27|46.05|E|display=inline}}. The memorial center contains a memorial hall showing photos and paintings of Lee's life, death and burial. The Lee family house was moved to the park from Gyebang Mountain. An outdoor static park contains a [[Northrop F-5]], a [[Cessna O-1 Bird Dog|Cessna O-1]], an [[M4 Sherman]] and various artillery pieces. The graves of Lee and his family are located within the park area.

He then served in [[No. 106 Squadron RAF]] and completed 18 bombing missions before being forced to crash land in [[France]] when returning from a raid on [[Stuttgart]] and four of his crew were killed. He was then imprisoned in Stalag Luft III where he became a member of an escape tunnelling team. There were three tunnels being dug named Tom, Dick and Harry and Broderick worked for two months in claustrophobic conditions on Dick, but Harry was completed first and after drawing lots he was 52 in the queue to go through that tunnel on the night of 24 March 1944. He and two companions named [[Henry Birkland]] and Denys Street managed to get clear of the area through nearby forests but they surrendered three days later having made little progress in cold and wet conditions. His companions were then among the 50 escapees who were executed on the orders of [[Adolf Hitler]] but Brodrick was among the 23 who were spared and he was returned to the camp. In 1945 he survived the 'Long March' westwards away from the [[Red Army]].

==Later life==
He was demobilised in 1945 and after working as a primary school teacher on Canvey Island he moved to [[South Africa]] in 1955 where he continued to work as a teacher until his retirement. He was married with two sons.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;[http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article3739118.ece Leslie Broderick Obituary ''The Times''].

{{Campaignbox Pakistan–United States skirmishes}}
On 21 September 2008 at 10 pm local time, in the [[Ghulam Khan]] district of [[North Waziristan]] Pakistani soldiers fired on two American helicopter gunships that entered Pakistani airspace with 12.7&amp;nbsp;mm [[heavy machine gun]]s. The helicopters stopped and hovered for a while, before returning over the border to Afghanistan without retaliation. It is unknown if any of the helicopters sustained any damage in this first incident.&lt;ref&gt;[http://afp.google.com/article/ALeqM5jqhY55584EVVKxIIbOeHrLWeoPvA Pakistani troops twice repel US choppers: officials] AFP, 23 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7628890.stm Pakistan troops 'repel US raid'] -''BBC News'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Thirty minutes later, two gunships attempted to cross the border again at the same place. Pakistani regular and [[Frontier Corps]] troops fired warning shots into the air and away from the helicopters, causing the helicopters to turn back without attacking any targets in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expressindia.com/latest-news/Pak-troops-fire-at-US-helicopters-in-N-Waziristan/364409/ Pak troops fire at US helicopters in N Waziristan] – ''ExpressIndia.com'', 22 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Journalism sidebar}}
'''Mainstream media''' ('''MSM''') is a term and abbreviation used to refer collectively to the various large [[Mass media|mass news media]] that influence a large number of people, and both reflect and shape prevailing currents of thought.&lt;ref name=Chomsky&gt;[[Noam Chomsky|Chomsky, Noam]], ''"What makes mainstream media mainstream"'', October 1997, ''[[Z Magazine]]'', [http://www.chomsky.info/articles/199710--.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; The term is used to contrast with [[alternative media]] which may contain content with more dissenting thought at variance with the prevailing views of mainstream sources.
 
The term is often used for large [[Media conglomerate|news conglomerates]], including [[newspaper]]s and [[broadcast media]], that underwent successive [[merger]]s in many countries. The [[concentration of media ownership]] has raised concerns of a homogenization of viewpoints presented to news consumers. Consequently, the term ''mainstream media'' has been widely used in conversation and the [[blogosphere]], sometimes in oppositional, pejorative, or dismissive senses, in discussion of the mass media and [[media bias]].

According to philosopher [[Noam Chomsky]], media organizations with an elite audience such as [[CBS News]] and ''[[The New York Times]]'' are successful corporations with the assets necessary to set the tone for other smaller news organizations which lack comparable resources by creating conversations that cascade down to smaller news organizations using the [[Associated Press]] and other means of [[News aggregator|aggregation]]. An elite mainstream sets the agenda and smaller organizations parrot it.&lt;ref name=Chomsky /&gt;

==Alternative terms==

The advent of the Internet allowed the expression of a more diverse or alternative viewpoint which may contrast to mainstream media, to the point where the term mainstream media is seen in pejorative terms.&lt;ref&gt;2013, Olesya Tkacheva, Internet Freedom and Political Space – Page 35&lt;/ref&gt;

''Lamestream media'' is a common pejorative alternative. [[Sarah Palin]] referred to "lamestream media," notably around 2009 during her participation in the [[Tea Party Express]], in the context of what she perceived as media misrepresentation of the [[Tea Party movement]].&lt;ref&gt;CBS News (cbsnews.com), ''"Sarah Palin: Obama's Policies Are 'Un-American'"'', April 14, 2010, [http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-503544_162-20002464-503544.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Politico (politico.com), ''"Sarah Palin trashes 'lamestream media'"'', 11/18/09, [http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1109/29693.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Los Angeles Times,''"'Tea party' protesters in Nevada target health law, Reid"'', March 28, 2010, [http://articles.latimes.com/2010/mar/28/nation/la-na-tea-palin28-2010mar28]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another term, originating on anonymous message boards, for the Mainstream Media is the acronym "MSM". The term is widely used by many on 4chan and Reddit, often as shorthand for the phrase "Mainstream Media".

{{main|Media cross-ownership in the United States}}
In the United States, movie production is known to have been dominated by major studios since the early 20th Century; before that, there was a period in which [[Motion Picture Patents Company|Edison's Trust]] monopolized the industry.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}} In the early twenty-first century the music and television industries was subject to media consolidation, with [[Sony Music Entertainment]]'s parent company merging their music division with [[Bertelsmann|Bertelsmann AG]]'s [[Bertelsmann Music Group|BMG]] to form [[Sony BMG]] and Tribune's [[The WB]] and CBS Corp.'s [[UPN]] merging to form [[The CW]]. In the case of Sony BMG there existed a "Big Five", later "[[Big Four record labels|Big Four]]", of major [[record company|record companies]], while The CW's creation was an attempt to consolidate ratings and stand up to the "Big Four" of American [[network television|network (terrestrial) television]] (although the CW was actually partially owned by one of the Big Four in CBS). In television, the vast majority of broadcast and basic cable networks, over a hundred in all, are controlled by eight corporations: [[News Corporation]] (the Fox family of channels), [[The Walt Disney Company]] (which includes the ABC, ESPN and Disney brands), [[National Amusements]] (which includes [[CBS Corporation]] and [[Viacom]]), [[Comcast]] (which includes the NBC brands), [[Time Warner]], [[Discovery Communications]], [[E. W. Scripps Company]], [[Cablevision]], or some combination thereof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Steiner|first=Tobias|title=Under the Macroscope: Convergence in the US Television Market between 2000 and 2014|url=https://www.academia.edu/2017902/Under_the_Macroscope_Convergence_in_the_US_Television_Market_between_2000_and_2014|work=academia.edu|accessdate=4 Aug 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There may also be some large-scale owners in an industry that are not the causes of monopoly or oligopoly. [[Clear Channel Communications]], especially since the [[Telecommunications Act of 1996]], acquired many [[radio station]]s across the United States, and came to own more than 1,200 stations. However, the radio broadcasting industry in the United States and elsewhere can be regarded as oligopolistic regardless of the existence of such a player. Because radio stations are local in reach, each licensed a specific part of spectrum by the [[Federal Communications Commission|FCC]] in a specific local area, any local market is served by a limited number of stations. In most countries, this system of licensing makes many [[markets]] local oligopolies. The similar market structure exists for television broadcasting, cable systems and newspaper industries, all of which are characterized by the existence of large-scale owners. Concentration of ownership is often found in these industries.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

In the United States, data on ownership and market share of media companies is not held in the public domain.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

=== Recent media mergers in the United States ===
Over time the rate of media mergers has increased, while the number of [[media outlets]] has also increased. This has resulted in a higher concentration of ownership, with fewer companies owning more media outlets. In 1983, 90% of US media was controlled by fifty companies; today, 90% is controlled by just six companies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.businessinsider.com/these-6-corporations-control-90-of-the-media-in-america-2012-6?IR=T Entertainment More: Infographic Media Corporation Mergers And Acquisitions These 6 Corporations Control 90% Of The Media In America - Business Insider, June 14 2012]&lt;/ref&gt;

===American public distrust in the media===
A 2012 [[Gallup (company)|Gallup]] poll found that Americans' distrust in the mainstream media was higher than it had ever been, with 60% saying they had little or no trust in the mass media to report the news fully, accurately, and fairly. Distrust had increased since the previous few years, when Americans were already more negative about the media than they had been before 2004.&lt;ref name="gallup"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/157589/distrust-media-hits-new-high.aspx |title=U.S. Distrust in Media Hits New High|first=|last=|website=Gallup|date=September 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout 2016, [[Google]] and [[Facebook]] had been targeted to disperse a substantial amount of [[fake news]], with the aim, it was claimed, of confusing Americans about various topics.  Following the victory of [[Donald Trump]] in the 2016 presidential election and during the campaign, Americans who supported [[Hillary Clinton]] were especially enraged about the noticeable amount of fake news about the election on the two websites. It was said that Facebook has been targeted in order to sway the American people with a particular agenda during the electoral cycle, although the chief executive of Facebook, [[Mark Zuckerberg]] stated that "Facebook did not have a role in the recent presidential campaign". It was also reported that the insurmountable number of "fake news" posts about the election had increased the number of Americans distrusting the media.&lt;ref name="curious.stratford"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://curious.stratford.edu/2016/11/22/moving-forward-google-and-facebook-against-fake-news/ |title=Moving Forward: Google and Facebook Against Fake News|first=Al|last=Gomez|website=Stratford University|date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The United Kingdom  ==
In England, during 1922, after the closure of many radio stations, the British Broadcasting Company started its first daily radio transmission and started to grow an audience.&lt;ref name="History of the BBC-1920s"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the BBC-1920s |url=https://www.bbc.com/timelines/zxqc4wx |website=BBC.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year [[John Reith, 1st Baron Reith|John Reith]], a Scottish engineer, would be appointed the first General Manager for the BBC.&lt;ref name= "History of the BBC-1920s" /&gt; Later on January 1, 1927 the BBC was fully established by Royal Charter and renamed the British Broadcasting Corporation with Reith as the first Director-General.&lt;ref name= "History of the BBC-1920s" /&gt; During November of 1936 the BBC began to expand into television broadcasting and was the first broadcaster to start the trend of a regularly scheduled TV service. &lt;ref name="History of the BBC-1930s"&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the BBC-1930s |url=https://www.bbc.com/timelines/zqbfyrd |website=BBC.com |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the BBC is one of two chartered public broadcasting companies in the United Kingdom. The second is ITV, Independent Television, which was established in 1955 as the first public commercial television company after the Television act of 1954 in an effort to break up the monopoly of the monopoly the BBC had on television broadcasting, gaining fifteen regional broadcasting licenses in less than twenty years.&lt;ref name="ABout ITV/History"&gt;{{cite web |title=About ITV/History |url=https://www.itvplc.com/about/history/2017 |website=Itvplc.com |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="Television Act of 1954"&gt;{{cite web |title=Television Act of 1954 |url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/cabinetpapers/themes/radio-television-bbc.htm |website=The National Archives |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the BBC and ITV are the two free to air digital services offered to everyone in the United Kingdom and each others biggest competitors.

'''''Man of La Mancha''''' is a 1965 [[musical theatre|musical]] with a book by [[Dale Wasserman]], lyrics by [[Joe Darion]], and music by [[Mitch Leigh]]. It is adapted from Wasserman's non-musical 1959 [[teleplay]] ''[[I, Don Quixote]]'', which was in turn inspired by [[Miguel de Cervantes]] and his 17th-century novel ''[[Don Quixote]]''. It tells the story of the "mad" knight Don Quixote as a play within a play, performed by Cervantes and his fellow prisoners as he awaits a hearing with the [[Spanish Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://guidetomusicaltheatre.com/shows_m/man_mancha.htm 'Man of La Mancha' synopsis] guidetomusicaltheatre.com. Retrieved January 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The work is not and does not pretend to be a faithful rendition of either Cervantes' life or ''Don Quixote''; for example, the historical Cervantes had no contact with the Spanish Inquisition, and Don Quixote's horse [[Rocinante]] is never stolen. Wasserman complained repeatedly about people taking the work as a musical version of ''Don Quixote''.&lt;ref&gt;"''Don Quixote'' as Theatre", [[Cervantes (journal of the Cervantes Society of America)]], vol. 19, number 1, 1999, pp. 125-30, http://users.ipfw.edu/jehle/cervante/csa/artics99/wasserma.htm.

''Man of La Mancha'' was first performed at the [[Goodspeed Opera House]] in [[East Haddam, Connecticut]] in 1965 and had its New York  premiere on the [[thrust stage]] of the [[ANTA Washington Square Theatre]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;Abbe A.

==History==
''Man of La Mancha'' started as a non-musical teleplay written by [[Dale Wasserman]] for CBS's ''[[DuPont Show of the Month]]'' program. This original telecast starred [[Lee J. Cobb]], [[Colleen Dewhurst]] (who replaced [[Viveca Lindfors]]), and [[Eli Wallach]] and was not performed on a thrust stage but on a television sound stage.  The [[DuPont|DuPont Corporation]] disliked the title ''Man of La Mancha'', thinking that its viewing audience would not know what [[La Mancha]] actually meant, so a new title, ''[[I, Don Quixote]]'', was chosen. The play was broadcast live on November 9, 1959, with an estimated audience of 20 million.&lt;ref&gt;Wasserman, Dale. ''The impossible musical'' (2003). Hal Leonard Corporation. {{ISBN|1-55783-515-2}}, pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt; The New York Public Library at Lincoln Center, Billy Rose Collection, has a rare tape of this broadcast. Wasserman has left us "A Diary of ''I, Don Quixote''" telling the teleplay's history; he himself was unaware that there was any surviving recording.&lt;ref name=Diary&gt;{{cite journal

Years after this television broadcast and after the original teleplay had been unsuccessfully optioned as a non-musical Broadway play, director [[Albert Marre]] called Wasserman and suggested that he turn his play into a musical. Mitch Leigh was selected as composer, with orchestrations by Carlyle W. Hall. Unusually for the time, t&lt;!--on an original Wiki entry derived from other sources,--&gt;his show was scored for an orchestra with no violins or other traditional orchestral stringed instruments apart from a double bass, instead making heavier use of brass, woodwinds, percussion and utilizing flamenco guitars as the only stringed instruments of any sort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.allmusicals.com/m/manoflamancha.htm Synopsis and song lyrics] AllMusicals.com. Retrieved January 27, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The original lyricist of the musical was poet [[W. H. Auden]], but his lyrics were discarded, some of them considered too overtly satiric and biting, attacking the bourgeois audience at times. Auden's lyrics were replaced by those of Joe Darion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.broadway.tv/broadway-features-reviews/Hidden-Broadway-Treasures-Revealed www.Broadway.tv article "Broadway Hidden Treasures Revealed"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110923164730/http://www.broadway.tv/broadway-features-reviews/Hidden-Broadway-Treasures-Revealed |date=September 23, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions==
The musical first played at the [[Goodspeed Opera House]] in [[Connecticut]] in 1965.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.goodspeed.org/shows-tickets/past-productions|title=Goodspeed Musicals – Past productions including Goodspeed original productions; Man of La Mancha, Shenandoah, Annie and many more!|website=www.goodspeed.org|access-date=2017-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rex Harrison]] was to be the original star of this production, but although Harrison had starred in a musical role in the stage and film versions of ''[[My Fair Lady]]'',  the musical demands of the role of Don Quixote were too heavy for him.  

After 21 previews, the musical opened [[Off-Broadway]] at the experimental thrust-stage [[ANTA Washington Square Theatre]] in [[Greenwich Village]] on November 22, 1965. The show moved to Broadway to the [[Martin Beck Theatre]] on March 20, 1968, then to the Eden Theatre on March 3, 1971, and finally to the [[Mark Hellinger Theatre]] on May 26, 1971 for its last month, a total original Broadway run of 2,328 performances. Musical staging and direction were by Albert Marre, choreography was by [[Jack Cole (choreographer)|Jack Cole]], and [[Howard Bay (designer)|Howard Bay]] was the scenic and lighting designer, with costumes by Bay and Patton Campbell.&lt;ref name=ibdb/&gt;

[[Richard Kiley]] won a [[Tony Award]] for his performance as Cervantes/Quixote in the original production, and it made Kiley a bona fide Broadway star.&lt;ref&gt;Gussow, Mel.[https://www.nytimes.com/1999/03/06/theater/richard-kiley-the-man-of-la-mancha-is-dead-at-76.html?pagewanted=1 "Richard Kiley, the Man of La Mancha, Is Dead at 76",]''The New York Times'', March 6, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Kiley was replaced in the original Broadway run by first [[Jose Ferrer]] on Broadway and in the 1966 National Tour, and then by operatic baritone [[David Atkinson (baritone)|David Atkinson]]. Atkinson also performed Cervantes/Quixote in the 1968 National Tour and for all of the matinee performances in the 1972 Broadway revival, which also starred Kiley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1969/09/08/88861378.pdf|title=Atkinson Rejoins Musical|work=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 8, 1969}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original cast also included [[Irving Jacobson]] (Sancho), [[Ray Middleton (actor)|Ray Middleton]] (Innkeeper), [[Robert Rounseville]] (The Padre), and [[Joan Diener]] (Aldonza).  [[John Cullum]], [[Hal Holbrook]], and [[Lloyd Bridges]] also played Cervantes and Don Quixote during the run of the production.&lt;ref name=ibdb/&gt; Keith Andes also played the role.

The musical was performed on a single set that suggested a dungeon.  All changes in location were created by alterations in the lighting, by the use of props supposedly lying around the floor of the dungeon, and by reliance on the audience's imagination.  More recent productions, however, have added more scenery.&lt;ref&gt;Guernsey, Otis L. ''Curtain times: the New York Theatre, 1965–1987'' (1987).

==Synopsis==
In the late sixteenth century, failed author-soldier-actor and tax collector [[Miguel de Cervantes]] has been thrown into a dungeon by the [[Spanish Inquisition]], along with his manservant. They have been charged with foreclosing on a monastery. Their fellow prisoners attack them, eager to steal the contents of the large trunk Cervantes has brought with him. However, a sympathetic criminal known as "the Governor" suggests setting up a mock trial instead. Only if Cervantes is found guilty will he have to hand over his possessions. A cynical prisoner, known as "the Duke," charges Cervantes with being an idealist and a bad poet. Cervantes pleads guilty, but then asks if he may offer a defense, in the form of a play, acted out by him and all the prisoners. The "Governor" agrees.

Cervantes takes out a makeup kit and costume from his trunk, and transforms himself into Alonso Quijano, an old gentleman who has read so many books of chivalry and thought so much about injustice that he has lost his mind and set out as a [[knight-errant]]. Quijano renames himself Don Quixote de La Mancha, and goes off to find adventures with his "squire", Sancho Panza. ("Man of La Mancha (I, Don Quixote)")

Don Quixote warns Sancho that they are always in danger of being attacked by Quixote's mortal enemy, an evil magician known as the Enchanter. Suddenly he spots a windmill, mistakes it for a four-armed giant, attacks it, and receives a beating from the encounter. Quijote decides that he lost the battle because he was never properly knighted. He then mistakes a rundown inn for a castle and orders Sancho to announce their arrival by blowing his bugle.

Cervantes talks some prisoners into assuming the roles of the inn's serving wench and part-time prostitute Aldonza, and a group of muleteers who are propositioning her. Aldonza fends them off sarcastically ("It's All The Same"), but eventually deigns to accept their leader, Pedro, who pays in advance.

Don Quixote enters with Sancho, asking for the lord of the castle. The Innkeeper (played by The Governor) humors Don Quixote as best he can. Quixote sees Aldonza and declares that she is his lady, Dulcinea, to whom he has sworn eternal loyalty ("Dulcinea"). Aldonza, used to rough treatment, is first flabbergasted and then annoyed at Quixote's kindness, and is further aggravated when the Muleteers turn Quixote's tender ballad into a mocking serenade.

Meanwhile, Antonia, Don Quixote's niece, has gone with Quixote's housekeeper to seek advice from the local priest, who realizes that the two women are more concerned with the embarrassment Quixote's madness may bring them, than with his actual welfare ("I'm Only Thinking of Him").

Cervantes chooses "the Duke" to play Dr. Sanson Carrasco, Antonia's fiancé, a man just as cynical and self-centered as the prisoner who is playing him. Carrasco is upset at the idea of marrying into the family of a madman, but the priest convinces Carrasco that it would be a worthy challenge to use his abilities to cure his prospective uncle-in-law. Carrasco and the priest set out to bring Don Quixote back home ("I'm Only Thinking of Him [Reprise]").

Back at the inn, Sancho delivers a [[wikt:missive|missive]] from Don Quixote to Aldonza courting her favor and asking for a token of her esteem. Aldonza provides the requested token: an old dishrag. She asks Sancho why he follows Quixote, but he can come up with no explanation other than "I Really Like Him". Alone, Aldonza ponders Quixote's behavior and her inability to laugh at him ("What Do You Want of Me?") In the courtyard, the muleteers once again taunt Aldonza with a suggestive song ("Little Bird, Little Bird"). Pedro makes arrangements with her for an assignation later.

The priest and Dr. Carrasco arrive, but cannot reason with Don Quixote. Quixote becomes distracted by a barber who passes by the inn, wearing his shaving basin on his head to ward off the sun's heat ("The Barber's Song"). Quixote threatens the barber with a sword and snatches the basin, declaring it is the "Golden Helmet of [[Mambrino]]", which makes its wearer invulnerable. Dr. Carrasco and the priest leave, with the priest impressed by Don Quixote's view of life and wondering if curing him is really worthwhile ("To Each His Dulcinea").

Quixote still wishes to be officially dubbed a knight: he plans to stand vigil all night over his armor in the inn's courtyard, and then have the Innkeeper (whom he mistakes for a nobleman) grant him knighthood the following morning. Aldonza encounters Quixote in the courtyard and confronts him; Quixote does his best to explain the ideals he follows and the quest he is on ("The Impossible Dream"). Pedro enters, furious at being kept waiting, and slaps Aldonza. Enraged, Don Quixote takes him and all the other muleteers on in a fight ("The Combat"). Don Quixote has no martial skill, but by luck and determination – and with the help of Aldonza and Sancho – he prevails, and the muleteers are all knocked unconscious. But the noise attracts the attention of the Innkeeper, who tells Quixote that he must leave. Quixote apologizes for the trouble but reminds the Innkeeper of his promise to dub him knight. The Innkeeper does so ("Knight of the Woeful Countenance").

Quixote then declares that he must comfort the wounded muleteers, because chivalry requires kindness to one's enemies. Aldonza, impressed, says that she will help the muleteers instead. But when she comes to them with bandages, they beat her, rape her, and carry her off ("The Abduction"). Quixote, unaware of this, contemplates his recent victory and new knighthood ("The Impossible Dream" – first reprise).

At this point, the Don Quixote play is brutally interrupted when the Inquisition enters the dungeon and drags off an unwilling prisoner to be tried.  The Duke taunts Cervantes for his look of fear, and accuses him of not facing reality. This prompts Cervantes to passionately defend his idealism.

The Don Quixote play resumes ("Man of La Mancha" – first reprise). Quixote and Sancho have left the inn and encounter a band of Gypsies ("Moorish Dance") who take advantage of Quixote's naiveté and steal everything they own, including Quixote's horse Rocinante and Sancho's donkey Dapple. &lt;ref&gt;The gypsy scene is omitted in some productions.&lt;/ref&gt; Quixote and Sancho are forced to return to the inn. Aldonza also shows up at the inn, bruised and ashamed. Quixote swears to avenge her, but she tells him off, flinging her real, pitiful history in his face and blaming him for allowing her a glimpse of a life she can never have. She begs him to see her as she really is but Quixote can only see her as his Dulcinea ("Aldonza").

Suddenly, another knight enters. He announces himself as Don Quixote's mortal enemy, the Enchanter, in the form of the "Knight of the Mirrors". He insults Aldonza, so Quixote challenges him to combat. The Knight of the Mirrors and his attendants bear huge mirrored shields, and as they swing them at Quixote ("Knight of the Mirrors"), the glare blinds him. The Knight taunts Quixote, forcing him to see himself as the world sees him: a fool and a madman. Don Quixote collapses, weeping. The Knight of the Mirrors removes his helmet – he is really Dr. Carrasco, returned with his latest plan to cure Quixote.

Cervantes announces that the story is finished, but the prisoners are dissatisfied with the ending. They prepare to burn his manuscript when he asks for the chance to present one last scene. The governor agrees.

Quixote is back at home, and has fallen into a coma. Sancho tries to cheer him up ("A Little Gossip"), and Alonso opens his eyes. He is now sane: he gives his name as Alonso Quijano and thinks his knightly career was just a dream. However, he feels close to death, and asks the priest to help him make out his will. Aldonza suddenly forces her way into the room. She has come to visit Quixote because she can no longer bear to be anyone but Dulcinea. When he does not recognize her, she sings a reprise of "Dulcinea" and tries to help him remember the words of "The Impossible Dream." Suddenly, he remembers everything and rises from his bed, calling for his armor and sword so that he may set out again ("Man of La Mancha" – second reprise). But it is too late – in mid-song, he cries out and falls dead. The priest sings "The Psalm" ([[Psalm 130]] in Latin) for the dead. Sancho is distraught at his friend's death. Aldonza tries to comfort him, saying that Alonso Quijano may be dead but Don Quixote lives on. When Sancho addresses her as Aldonza, she replies, "My name is Dulcinea."

The Inquisition enters to take Cervantes to his trial, and the prisoners, finding him not guilty, return his manuscript. It is his (as yet) unfinished novel, ''[[Don Quixote]]''. As Cervantes and his servant mount the staircase to go to their impending trial, the prisoners, led by the girl who played Dulcinea, sing "The Impossible Dream" in chorus.

'''Marina Nikolayevna Oswald Porter''' (née '''Prusakova'''; {{lang-ru|Марина Николаевна Прусакова}}; born July 17, 1941) is the widow of [[Lee Harvey Oswald]], the assassin of U.S. President [[John F. Kennedy]]. She married Oswald during his temporary defection to the [[Soviet Union]] and emigrated to the United States with him. She was not implicated in the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|assassination]] and remarried two years after Oswald's murder.

==Early life==
Porter was born Marina Nikolayevna Prusakova in city of Molotovsk (now [[Severodvinsk]]), in [[Arkhangelsk Oblast]] of [[Russian SFSR]]. She lived there with her mother and stepfather until 1957, when she moved to [[Minsk]] to live with her uncle Ilya Prusakov, a colonel in the [[Ministry of Internal Affairs (Russia)|Soviet Ministry of Internal Affairs]], and to study pharmacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mailer|first = Norman | authorlink=Norman Mailer|title = Oswald's Tale: An American Mystery|year=2007|publisher=Random House | isbn = 1-588-36593-X|page= 137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life with Oswald==
Marina met [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] (a former [[U.S. Marine]] who had defected to the Soviet Union) at a dance on March 17, 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1 = Hosty | first1 =James P |last2=Hosty|first2 = Thomas | title =Assignment: Oswald| year = 2013 | publisher = Skyhorse |isbn = 1-628-72187-1 | page = 112}}&lt;/ref&gt; They married six weeks later and had a daughter, June Lee, born the following year. In June 1962, the family emigrated to the United States and settled in [[Dallas]], Texas. At a party in February 1963, [[George de Mohrenschildt]] introduced the couple to [[Ruth Paine]], a [[Quakers|Quaker]] and Russian language student.

In January 1963, Oswald ordered a [[Smith &amp; Wesson]] .38 [[revolver]] and then, in March, a [[John F. Kennedy assassination rifle|Mannlicher–Carcano rifle]].&lt;ref name="WCR-C4"&gt;{{cite book |title=Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy |url=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/ |year=1964 |publisher=United States Government Printing Office |location=Washington, D.C. |pages=118–119 |chapter=Chapter 4: The Assassin |chapterurl=https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/warren-commission-report/chapter-4.html |ref={{harvid|Report of the President's Commission on the Assassination of President John F. Kennedy, Chapter 4|1964}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, as Marina told the [[Warren Commission]], she took photographs of Oswald dressed in black and holding his weapons along with an issue of ''[[The Militant]]'' newspaper, which named ex-general [[Edwin Walker]] as a "fascist." These photos became known as the "backyard photos" of Lee Oswald, which some conspiracy theorists dismissed as fake.{{Sfn | Groden | 1995 | pp = 90–95}} The series of photographs were later found in the garage of the Paine household, with the exception of one, which had been given to George de Mohrenschildt.{{Sfn | Bugliosi | 2007 | pp = 793–95}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Sabato | first = Larry J |title=The Kennedy Half-Century: The Presidency, Assassination, and Lasting Legacy of John F Kennedy|year=2013 | publisher = Bloomsbury | place = US |isbn = 1-620-40281-5 | page = 486}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photograph given to de Mohrenschildt was signed by Lee Oswald, and has a quote attributed to Marina in Russian, the translation of which reads "Hunter of Fascists, Ha-Ha-Ha!!!"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Johnson McMillan| first = Priscilla | title =Marina and Lee: The Tormented Love and Fatal Obsession Behind Lee Harvey Oswald's Assassination of John F Kennedy |year=2013 | publisher = Steerforth Press | isbn = 1-586-42217-0 |page= 360}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 1963, Marina and her daughter moved in with Ruth Paine (who had recently separated from her husband, [[Michael Paine|Michael]]). Lee Oswald rented a separate room in Dallas and briefly moved to [[New Orleans]] during the summer of 1963. He returned to Dallas in early October, eventually renting a [[Lee Harvey Oswald Rooming House|room in a boarding house]] in the [[Oak Cliff]] district of Dallas. Paine learned from a neighbor that employment was available at the [[Texas School Book Depository]], and Oswald was hired and began working there on October 16, 1963, as an order filler. On October 20, Marina gave birth to a second daughter, Audrey Marina Rachel Oswald. Her husband continued to live in Oak Cliff on weekdays, but stayed with her at the [[Ruth Paine Home|Paine household]] in Irving on weekends, an arrangement that continued until Oswald assassinated Kennedy.

==Assassination of Kennedy==
Marina learned of the assassination of President Kennedy from the media coverage of the event, and later, of the arrest of her husband. That afternoon, [[Dallas Police Department]] detectives arrived at the Paine household, and when asked if Lee owned a rifle, she gestured to the garage, where Oswald stored [[John F. Kennedy assassination rifle|his rifle]] rolled up in a blanket; no rifle was found. She was subsequently questioned both at the Paine household and later at Dallas Police Department headquarters, in reference to her husband's involvement in the assassination of the President and the shooting of Dallas police officer [[J. D. Tippit|J.D. Tippit]].

She was widowed two days after the assassination when her husband was mortally wounded by [[Jack Ruby]] as Oswald was being transferred from the City Jail to the County Jail. She was widowed at only 22; Jack Ruby died when she was 25.

After the assassination of Kennedy and the arrest of her husband, Marina was under [[United States Secret Service|Secret Service]] protection until she completed her testimony before the [[Warren Commission]]. She made a total of four appearances before the commission. Questions about her reliability as a witness were expressed within the commission, particularly in regard to her claims about an assassination attempt on General [[Edwin Walker]],{{Sfn | Groden | 1995 | pp = 62–63}} and her allegation that Lee Oswald had intended to assassinate [[Richard Nixon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title = Warren Commission Report| year = 2003 | publisher =Barnes &amp; Noble |isbn = 0-760-74997-3 | pages= 187–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Sfn | Bugliosi | 2007 | pp = 697–98}} In her testimony, she stated her belief that her husband was guilty, an opinion she reiterated in testimony before the [[House Select Committee on Assassinations]] in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2519&amp;dat=19780915&amp;id=52VfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ll8NAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1266,2119761 |title = Marina Oswald Concedes Husband Could Be Killer | date=September 15, 1978|work= Observer-Reporter |page =D–3|accessdate=September 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later years==
She remained at first in [[Dallas]], Texas. Per [[William Manchester]] in ''[[The Death of a President]]'':

{{quote|The plight of Marie Tippit [wife of [[J. D. Tippit]], police officer shot by Oswald] and Marina Oswald appealed to American generosity; mailbags of checks and cash descended upon them.  Mrs. Tippit handled herself admirably....  Marina... led a more colorful career.  With $70,000 in donations she engaged a series of business agents.  Her husband's Russian diary brought $20,000 and a picture of him holding the Mannlicher-Carcano carbine [the gun used to shoot Kennedy] $5,000.  Then she went after the gun itself, arguing that since Oswald was dead it could not be held as evidence.  A Denver oil man who wanted it as a souvenir sent her a $10,000 down payment – about 49,900 percent profit on Lee's original investment – and then sued [Nicholas] [[Nicholas Katzenbach|Katzenbach]] for possession. Early in 1966 a federal court threw the case out. Late that autumn the Justice Department took title to C2766 [the gun's serial number].

Marina had spent the money long ago. With affluence she had acquired mobility.  At first she had told the press that the strongest force in her life was her love for the father of her children; she only wanted to live near his grave. This quickly changed. First she enrolled at the [[University of Michigan]]. Returning to Dallas, she bought an air-conditioned house, a wardrobe of Neiman-Marcus clothes, and membership in the Music Box, a private club. She became a chain-smoker and a drinker of straight vodka. In the Music Box she spun through a series of romances. Then, in 1965, in a Texas town called [[Fate, Texas|Fate]], she became a June bride.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[The Death of a President]]'' by [[William Manchester]], p. 635 (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Two years after Oswald's death, she married Kenneth Jess Porter, with whom she had a son.&lt;ref&gt;https://nypost.com/2013/11/01/now-a-granny-oswalds-widow-snapped-for-first-time-in-25-years/&lt;/ref&gt; Porter was a twice-divorced drag racer who was in jail 11 weeks after the marriage. Marina accused him of domestic violence, but a justice of the peace "reunited them."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''[[The Death of a President]]'' by [[William Manchester]], p. 635 (paperback)&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1970s, she moved to [[Rockwall, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2480374/The-secret-life-JFK-assassin-Lee-Harvey-Oswalds-widow-Marina.html |title=The secret life of Lee Harvey Oswald's widow who believe's that he had killed JFK as it's revealed assassin cared so much for president he sobbed when his premature son Patrick died | work = [[DailyMail]] |date=October 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1989, she became a naturalized [[United States citizen]].&lt;ref name="Interview with Oprah Winfrey"&gt;{{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/*/http://jfkresearch.com/marina/marina.htm |date=* |title=Interview with Oprah Winfrey }} (Nov. 22, 1996)&lt;/ref&gt; She has appeared in numerous documentaries on the Kennedy assassination.

'''Ndocciata''' is an ancient [[Christmas]] festival celebrated in [[Molise]], southern [[Italy]], specifically in the city of [[Agnone]]. On the evening of December 24 the “Ndocciata” of Agnone is a parade of a great number of “‘ndocce” (torches), structures with a typical fanwise shape, made of silver fir pinewood pallets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Roy |last=Palmer Domenico |title=The regions of Italy: a reference guide to history and culture|publisher= Greenwood Publishing Group|year=2002 |isbn= 0-313-30733-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They may be only one torch or, more often, with multiple torches up to twenty fires. Four metres high, “‘ndocce” are transported by different carriers dressed in traditional costumes. The big bell of St. Anthony’s Church is rung, and groups from the cities’ districts (Capammonde and Capabballe, Colle Sente, Guastra, Onofrio, San Quirico) consisting of hundreds of carriers of all ages, light their ndocce (torches) to set off along the main streets which thus becomes what locals call a “river of fire.”  There is a choral participation  and bagpipers along the roads of the village, and groups compete in order to have the biggest and the most beautiful “‘ndocce”. The procession ends with a bonfire called “Bonfire of Brotherhood” at Plebiscite Square where a [[Nativity scene]] is displayed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Nino |last=Modugno |title=Il mondo magico della notte delle streghe. Credenze e rituali che accompagnano il 24 giugno|publisher=Hermes Edizioni|year= 2005 |isbn= 88-7938-273-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The roots of the festival precede the [[Christian]] and [[Roman Empire|Roman]] eras to the time of the [[Samnium|Samnite]] tribes. The Samnites were using ndocce as a source of light during the strategic tribal shifts that occurred at night. The tradition has since been passed down to farmers (noted after the  9th century) that sought to illuminate the path from the various districts that took them to reach the many churches in town on Christmas night and witness the Nativity.&lt;ref&gt;Alfredo Cattabiani Lunario'': dodici mesi di miti, feste, leggende e tradizioni popolari d'Italia.''  A. Mondadori, 2002  {{ISBN|88-04-50138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Different traditions have been reflected in Ndocciata over the years, for example, if the wind blew from the north during the bonfire it was expected to be a good year.  During [[medieval]] times, a roaring fire from the torches helped overcome witches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Alfredo |last=Cattabiani |title=Lunario: dodici mesi di miti, feste, leggende e tradizioni popolari d'Italia|publisher=A. Mondadori|year= 2002|isbn=88-04-50138-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Another Ndocciata tradition recalls that boys on this occasion  tried to make a good impression in the eyes of the town girls they were competing for, and they tried to create the most beautiful and compact (in order to make it last longer) ndocce.  At the end of the parade the ndoccia was brought under the window of the girl on which he pinned his hope. If she looked out meant that she appreciated the gesture, adversely a bucket of water extinguished the torch and the ardour of youth. The public square bonfire lighting is now meant for people meet to say goodbye to anything negative, and is symbolically burned in the fire. At the end of the parade, a Nativity is displayed symbolizing not only Christmas but renewal for a new year.&lt;ref&gt;William D. Crump ''The Christmas encyclopedia''. McFarland &amp; Co., 2006 {{ISBN|0-7864-2293-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ndocce are large torches made of silver fir pine and white bundles of dried broom held together by twine. The torches are three to four metres high and sometimes are joined by horizontal poles to form groups that can reach up to twenty torches arranged in the shape of a fan. The carriers wear black complemented with a hood or hat, which is derived from the ancient garments of the [[Oscan]] Samnite tribe as a tacit form of humility.&lt;ref&gt;Nino Modugno ''Il mondo magico della notte delle streghe.

{{Political corruption sidebar}}
'''Nepotism''' is based on favour granted to [[Kinship|relatives]] in various fields, including business, politics, entertainment, sports, religion and other activities. The term originated with the assignment of nephews to important positions by [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s. [[Corruption in Lithuania#Nepotism|Trading parliamentary employment for favors]] is a modern-day example of nepotism. Criticism of nepotism, however, can be found in [[ancient India]]n texts such as the [[Tirukkural|Kural literature]].

== Origins ==
{{Main|Cardinal-nephew}}
The term comes from the Italian word ''nepotismo'',&lt;ref name="dictionary"&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/nepotism "Nepotism."] Dictionary.com. Retrieved 20 June 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |accessdate=10 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the [[Middle Ages]] and until the late 17th century, some [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[pope]]s and [[bishop]]s, who had taken vows of [[chastity]], and therefore usually had no legitimate offspring of their own, gave their nephews such positions of preference as were often accorded by fathers to son.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism"&gt;{{cite web|title=Article Nepotism |work=New Catholic Dictionary |url=http://catholic-forum.com/saints/ncd05726.htm |accessdate=12 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224025607/http://www.catholic-forum.com/Saints/ncd05726.htm |archivedate=24 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several popes [[Cardinal-nephew|elevated nephews]] and other relatives to the [[Cardinal (Catholicism)|cardinalate]]. Often, such appointments were a means of continuing a papal "dynasty".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gianvittorio Signorotto|author2=Maria Antonietta Visceglia|title=Court and Politics in Papal Rome, 1492–1700|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2W1tc-wf5DQC&amp;pg=PA114|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=21 March 2002|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-43141-5|pages=114–116}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, [[Pope Callixtus III]], head of the [[House of Borgia|Borgia]] family, made two of his nephews cardinals; one of them, Rodrigo, later used his position as a cardinal as a stepping stone to the papacy, becoming [[Pope Alexander VI]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

  |work=New Catholic Dictionary

Paul III also engaged in nepotism, appointing, for instance, two nephews, aged 14 and 16, as cardinals. The practice was finally limited when [[Pope Innocent XII]] issued the [[Papal bull|bull]] ''[[Romanum decet Pontificem]]'', in 1692.&lt;ref name="Article Nepotism" /&gt; The papal bull prohibited popes in all times from bestowing estates, offices, or revenues on any relative, with the exception that one qualified relative (at most) could be made a cardinal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Anura Gurugé|title=The Next Pope|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=B5JVthemvvwC&amp;pg=PA115|accessdate=20 June 2013|date=16 February 2010|publisher=Anura Guruge|isbn=978-0-615-35372-2|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[Ancient Indian philosophy|ancient Indian philosopher]] [[Valluvar]], nepotism is both evil and unwise.&lt;ref name="PSSundaram_Kural"&gt;{{cite book

== Types ==
=== Political ===
Nepotism is a common accusation in politics when the relative of a powerful figure ascends to similar power seemingly without appropriate qualifications. The [[British English]] expression "[[Bob's your uncle]]" is thought to have originated when [[Robert Arthur Talbot Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury]], promoted his nephew, [[Arthur Balfour]], to the esteemed post of [[Chief Secretary for Ireland]], which was widely seen as an act of nepotism.&lt;ref name=Trahair&gt;{{cite book

 | zbl =
 | jfm = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organizational ===
Nepotism can also occur within organizations when a person is employed due to familial ties. It is generally seen as unethical, both on the part of the employer and employee.

==== In employment ====
Nepotism at work can mean increased opportunity at a job, attaining the job or being paid more than other similarly situated people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.safeworkers.co.uk/nepotismatwork.html |title=Nepotism at Work |publisher=Safeworkers.co.uk |date=20 April 2013 |accessdate=20 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Arguments are made both for and against employment granted due to a family connection, which is most common in small, family run businesses. On one hand, nepotism can provide stability and continuity. Critics cite studies that demonstrate decreased morale and commitment from non-related employees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |title=Family Ties: Handling Nepotism Within Your Business&amp;nbsp;– Perspectives&amp;nbsp;– Inside INdiana Business with Gerry Dick |publisher=Insideindianabusiness.com |date=9 November 2010 |accessdate=20 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130514022519/http://www.insideindianabusiness.com/contributors.asp?id=1625 |archivedate=14 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  and a generally negative attitude towards superior positions filled through nepotism. An article from ''[[Forbes]]'' magazine stated "there is no ladder to climb when the top rung is reserved for people with a certain name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/2009/06/19/ceo-executive-hiring-ceonewtork-leadership-nepotism.html |title=Is Nepotism So Bad? |publisher=Forbes |date= |accessdate=20 June 2013 |first=Klaus |last=Kneale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some businesses forbid nepotism as an ethical matter, considering it too troublesome and disruptive.

==== In entertainment ====
Outside of national politics, accusations of nepotism are made in instances of ''[[prima facie]]'' favoritism to relatives, in such cases as:
* [[Peaches Geldof]]'s role as magazine editor in an [[MTV]] reality show&amp;nbsp;– produced by a company owned by her father, [[Bob Geldof]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |title=Peaches Geldof bags TV reality show as magazine editor |work=[[Sunday Mirror]] |access-date=6 March 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080524020700/http://www.sundaymirror.co.uk/showbiz/showbiznews/2008/03/16/peaches-geldof-bags-tv-reality-show-as-magazine-editor-98487-20353319/ |archive-date=24 May 2008 |dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Tori Spelling]]'s breakout role on [[Beverly Hills, 90210]] as a result of her father [[Aaron Spelling]]'s involvement with the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/30/arts/television/on-so-notorious-tori-spelling-mocks-herself-before-you-can.html|title=On 'So Notorious,' Tori Spelling Mocks Herself Before You Can|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=19 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/tori-spelling-admits-getting-shannon-doherty-fired-from-beverly-hills-90210-and-lending-her-dress-stained-with-virgin-blood-for-photoshoot-31580540.html|title=Tori Spelling admits getting Shannon Doherty fired from Beverly Hills 90210 and lending her dress stained with 'virgin blood' for photoshoot&amp;nbsp;– Independent.ie|publisher=|accessdate=14 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

== Types of partiality ==
Nepotism refers to partiality to family whereas [[cronyism]] refers to partiality to a partner or [[friend]].  [[In-group favoritism|Favoritism]], the broadest of the terms, refers to partiality based upon being part of a favored group, rather than job performance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.scu.edu/ethics/practicing/focusareas/government_ethics/introduction/cronyism.html | title=Favoritism, Cronyism, and Nepotism | publisher=Santa Clara University | accessdate=20 June 2013 | author=Judy Nadler and Miriam Schulman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Norbergfestival''' is a Scandinavian electronic and experimental music festival held in [[Norberg]], [[Västmanland]], [[Sweden]]. The festival was started in 1999 by Michael Østerz Christiansen and Dag Celsing. The event attracts people of different ages and most visitors come from Sweden, Denmark, Norway, Finland, UK or Germany&lt;ref&gt;.[http://www.norbergfestival.com/ Norbergfestival web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
There are 3 main stages on the festival, the first of which is ''Mimer'' with a staggering reverb of more than 7 seconds; concrete and steel structures are the raw surroundings. ''KraftWerk'' is the old power plant, where the clubbing and dancing atmosphere is intense. Camp-303 is the official underground stage. On top of that, the ''ReallyOpenStage'' gives visitors a chance to play either on bought or borrowed machines. Art installations are present in Mimer and around the festival area.

Norbergfestival is held inside and around an abandoned mining area. The main concert building, ''Mimerlaven'', was once a pithead frame for the extraction of iron ore. The structure was erected in 1957. Hematite and magnetite from the pits around Norberg were brought into Mimer, crushed and then further processed. The mining business was discontinued in the 1980s.

Every year, around 90 artists perform at Norbergfestival. Music styles include [[Avantgarde]], [[Electronic art music|EAM]], [[drone music|Drone]], [[Electronica]], [[8-bit]], [[Acid]], [[Breakcore]], [[Detroit Techno]] and [[Dubstep]]. Notable artists like [[Pole (musician)|Pole]], [[Pamelia Kurstin]], [[Luke Vibert]], [[Kid606]], [[Fennesz]], [[B12 (band)|B12]], [[Vladislav Delay]], [[Milanese]], [[Pan Sonic]], [[Monolake]], Bong-Ra, [[Skream]], [[Biosphere (musician)|Biosphere]], [[DJ Food]], [[Psilodump]], [[Andreas Tilliander]], [[Paul Woolford (DJ)|Paul Woolford]], [[Skudge]] and many more have performed at the festival.

Originally, the festival was run by the Danish-Swedish Norbergfestival association. Since 2012 the festival is being run by the Swedish Norbergfestival association. In 2015 the organisation changed its name to ''Anrikningsverket''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2816">'''Pious fraud''' is used to describe [[fraud]] in [[religion]] or medicine. A pious fraud can be counterfeiting a [[miracle]] or falsely attributing a [[Pseudepigraph|sacred text to a biblical figure]] due to the belief that the "[[Consequentialism|end justifies the means]]", in this case the end of increasing [[faith]] by whatever means available.{{citation needed|reason=reliable source needed for definition of term|date=February 2011}}

==Use of the phrase==
The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' reports the phrase was first used in English in 1678. [[Edward Gibbon]] was particularly fond of the phrase, using it often in his monumental and controversial work ''[[The History of the Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire]]'' in which he criticized the likelihood of some of the [[martyr]]s and miracles of the early [[Christian]] church.

[[William W. Howells]] wrote that [[shaman]]s know that their tricks are impostures, but that all who studied them agree that they really believe in their power to deal with [[spirit]]s. According to Howells, their main purpose is an honest one and they believe that this justifies the means of hoodwinking his followers in minor technical matters.&lt;ref&gt;William Howells,  1962. ''The Heathens: Primitive Man and his Religions'' [[New York City]]: [[National Museum of American History]] [http://www.amnh.org/] in Robert S. Ellwood ''Civilized Shamans: Sacred Biography and Founders of [[New Religious Movement]]s'',  in ''New Religions in a Postmodern World'' edited by [[Mikael Rothstein]] and Reender Kranenborg (Studies in New Religions [[Aarhus University]] Press) 2003 {{ISBN|87-7288-748-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Thomas Jefferson==

[[Thomas Jefferson]] wrote to a doctor-friend in 1805:

It was certainly a pious fraud.|"Placebo Effects and Science Journalism at the Mind/Body Boundary". Steve Silberman, The Journal of Mind-Body Regulation, 2011}}

==Isaac Newton==
In [[Isaac Newton]]'s dissertation, ''[[An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture]]'', he blames the "Roman Church" for many abuses in the world, accusing it of "pious frauds".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Tort law}}

In [[English law|English]] [[criminal law]], '''public nuisance''' is a class of [[common law offence]] in which the injury, loss, or damage is suffered by the public, in general, rather than an individual, in particular.

==In Australia==
In ''Kent v Johnson'' the [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory|Supreme Court of the ACT]] held that Public nuisance is "an unlawful act or omission ... which endangers the lives, safety, health, property or comfort of the public or by which the public are obstructed in the exercise or enjoyment of any right common to all".&lt;ref name="Kent v Johnson"&gt;''Kent v Johnson (Minister of State for Works)'' (1973) 2 [[ACT Law Reports|ACTR]] 1; (1973) 21 [[Federal Law Reports|FLR]] 177, [[Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory|Supreme Court]] (ACT, Australia).&lt;/ref&gt; And also, Public Nuisance is a criminal offense at some common law and by statute under some states.&lt;ref name="Kent v Johnson"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Legislation AU|Qld|act|cc189994|Criminal Code|230}} Common nuisance.&lt;/ref&gt; To establish  a prima facie case of public nuisance, a private individual will have to prove: (1) title to sue, (2) that the interference is with a public right and  (3) that the defendant's interference is substantial and unreasonable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carolyn|first1=Sappideen|last2=Prue|first2=Vines|last3=Penelope|first3=Watson|title=Torts: commentary and Materials|publisher=Thomson Reuters (Professional) Australia Limited |isbn=9780455230436|pages=754, 755|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* (1): title to sue
In the case ''Walsh v Ervin'',&lt;ref name="Walsh v Ervin"&gt;{{cite AustLII|VicLawRp|47|1952|litigants=Walsh v Ervin |parallelcite=[1952] [[Victorian Law Reports|VLR]] 361 at p. 368 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; as the general principle is usually stated, an individual cannot sue alone for relief in respect of a nuisance to a public highway unless he has sustained some particular damage, in the sense of some substantial injury, direct and not merely consequential, beyond that suffered by the public generally.
* (2): interference is with a public right
In the case ''Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd'',&lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"&gt;{{cite BAILII |litigants=Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd |year=1958 |court=EWCA |division=Civ |num=1 |courtname=auto |parallelcite=[1957] 2 [[Queens Bench Law Reports|QB]] 169 at p. 179}}.&lt;/ref&gt; a nuisance which is so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large
* (3): interference is substantial and unreasonable
The interference must be substantial and unreasonable in order to establish public nuisance. In modern world, daily inconveniences and annoyances are part of unreasonable and substantial interference. 
However, there are some examples that shows even if it could cause interference to the public, there is no public nuisance. For example, in ''Maitland v Raisbeck'', "it would seem that every driver of a vehicle on the road would be turned into an insurer in respect of latent defects in this machines", even if a danger was created because of moral use of vehicle.&lt;ref&gt;''Maitland v Raisbeck'' [1944] 1 [[Kings Bench Law Reports|KB]] 689 at p. 692&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Harper v Haden'' [1933] [[Chancery Division Law Reports |Ch]] 298.&lt;/ref&gt; In the case  ''Silservice Pty Ltd v Supreme Bready Pty Ltd'',&lt;ref name="Silservice v Supreme Bready"&gt;{{cite AustLII|NSWStRp|29|1949|litigants=Silservice Pty Ltd v Supreme Bready Pty Ltd |parallelcite=(1950) 50 [[State Reports New South Wales|SR (NSW)]] 127 at p. 129 |courtname=auto}}.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ernest David Roper|Roper]] Chief Judge in Equity stated that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;it appears that in cases of this kind if the defendant has available to him reasonable means of removing or avoiding the obstruction, he is responsible for the nuisance if he does not adopt those means. The test is not whether an obstruction has been caused, but whether the obstruction could reasonably have been avoided. I think, however, that this is not the sole test of whether a person is responsible for the nuisance caused by the assembly of a crowd of people, and that a more absolute liability rests upon the person whose business involves the gathering together of a crowd, or who, apart from any consideration of the bona fide conduct of his business, deliberately continues to gather the crowd. (citations omitted).&lt;ref name="Silservice v Supreme Bready"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discussion==
The nuisance action began in twelfth century England as a criminal writ, belonging only to the Crown. It was used in cases that involved encroachments upon the King’s land or the blocking of public roads or waterways. The King sought to punish these criminal infringements, commonly known as “purprestures,” through criminal proceedings. Over time, activities prosecuted as public nuisances included everything from embezzling public funds to having a tiger pen next to a highway, from assisting a homicidal maniac to escape to placing a mutilated corpse on a doorstep, and from selling rotten meat to “subdividing houses to the point where they become ‘overpestered’ with the poor.” As these examples demonstrate, early authority to commence public nuisance actions was derived from the sovereign’s “police power."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nuisancelaw.com/learn/historical Public Nuisance: A Historical Discussion]&lt;/ref&gt;

Spencer (1989 at 59) describes the offence as, "...a rag-bag of odds and ends which we should nowadays call 'public welfare offences'".&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, J. R. (1989). "Public Nuisance - A Critical Examination". ''Cambridge Law Journal'' 55.&lt;/ref&gt; But the common feature of the crime is that members of the public suffer a common injury through interference with rights which they enjoy as citizens. The modern definition is found in paras 31-40 Archbold (2005):

{{quote|A person is guilty of a public nuisance (also known as common nuisance), who (a) does an act not warranted by law, or (b) omits to discharge a legal duty, if the effect of the act or omission is to endanger the life, health, property, morals, or comfort of the public, or to obstruct the public in the exercise or enjoyment of rights common to all Her Majesty's subjects.&lt;ref&gt;*Archbold. (2005). ''Archbold: Criminal Pleading, Evidence and Practice''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In ''Attorney General v PYA Quarries Ltd'' &lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"/&gt; the issue was whether quarrying activities—which showered the neighbourhood with stones and splinters, and caused dust and vibrations—were a private nuisance affecting some of the residents (which would have been civil), but not a public nuisance affecting all Her Majesty's liege subjects living in the area.&lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"/&gt; In his judgment [[Charles Romer|Romer LJ]] concluded at p 184:

{{quote|I do not propose to attempt a more precise definition of a public nuisance than those which emerge from the textbooks and authorities to which I have referred. It is, however, clear, in my opinion, that any nuisance is 'public' which materially affects the reasonable comfort and convenience of life of a class of Her Majesty's subjects. The sphere of the nuisance may be described generally as 'the neighbourhood'; but the question whether the local community within that sphere comprises a sufficient number of persons to constitute a class of the public is a question of fact in every case. It is not necessary, in my judgment, to prove that every member of the class has been injuriously affected; it is sufficient to show that a representative cross-section of the class has been so affected for an injunction to issue.}}

[[Tom Denning, Baron Denning|Denning LJ.]] agreed at p 191

{{quote|that a public nuisance is a nuisance which is so widespread in its range or so indiscriminate in its effect that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on his own responsibility to put a stop to it, but that it should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large.}}

In ''R v Madden'' (1975) 1 WLR 1379 the defendant telephoned a bomb hoax to a steel works whose business was disrupted for about an hour. James LJ. accepted that hoax telephone calls falsely asserting the presence of explosives could amount to an offence of public nuisance but the few employees whose day was disrupted were not a sufficiently wide class of the public. But in ''R v Norbury'' (1978) Crim. LR 435 the defendant made 605 obscene telephone calls to 494 different women over a period of four years. This repetitive behaviour over a long period, intended to cause offence and alarm, was held the kind of behaviour which the public has an interest in condemning. This is not without its problems because each telephone call lacks the element of common injury. As a comparison, the cases of ''R v Ruffell'' (1991) 13 Cr. App. R. (S) 204 and ''R v Shorrock'' (1994) QB 279 involved the prosecution of the organisers of "acid house" parties at night in fields adjacent to residential accommodation with liability confirmed because they knew, or ought to have known, that there was a real risk of creating the sort of nuisance that in fact occurred. At each party there was major traffic disruption and the noise of music, with clean-up operations required the following day. While ''R v Ong'' (2001) 1 [[Criminal Appeal Reports (Sentencing)|Cr. App. R. (S)]] 404 involved a betting scam in which the floodlights at a Premier Division football match between Charlton Athletic and Liverpool were to be sabotaged which was inherently dangerous to the thousands within the ground.

In ''R v Soul'' (1980) 70 Cr. App. R. 295 a group who agreed to secure the unlawful release of a restricted Broadmoor patient was convicted of [[conspiracy (criminal)|conspiracy]] to effect a public nuisance. The court seems to have assumed that the public would have been exposed to danger had the plan been put into effect. That the Crown had failed to prove any actual danger or common injury was not considered (see the critical commentary at (1980) Crim. LR 234 suggesting that the courts were improperly reintroducing "public mischief" into the law despite the ruling by the House of Lords in ''R v Withers'' (1975) AC 842). Similarly, in ''R v Millward'' (1986) 8 Cr. App R(S) 209 the defendant made hundreds of telephone calls (636 in a single day) to a young woman police officer with whom he had become infatuated, at the police station where she worked. As to the requirement of common injury, Glidewell LJ, said:

{{quote|Quite apart from anything else, this disrupts the whole operation of the police station to which these calls are directed, because a member of the public may wish to report an urgent matter such as a criminal offence, and cannot do so or is delayed in doing so because of this kind of behaviour on the part of the appellant.}}

In ''R v Johnson (Anthony)'' (1997) 1 WLR 367, the Court of Appeal confronted the problem head-on. The defendant had made hundreds of obscene telephone calls to at least thirteen women. The defence argued each telephone call was a single isolated act to an individual. Tucker J, rejected the argument at pp370–371:

{{quote|In our judgment it is permissible and necessary to look at the cumulative effect of these calls, made to numerous ladies on numerous occasions in the case of each lady, and to have regard to the cumulative effect of the calls in determining whether the appellant's conduct constituted a public nuisance. In our opinion it was conduct which materially affected the reasonable comfort and convenience of a class of Her Majesty's subjects: see per Romer LJ in ''Attorney-General v PYA Quarries Ltd''.&lt;ref name="A-G v PYA Quarries"/&gt; It was a nuisance which was so widespread in its range, or so indiscriminate in its effect, that it would not be reasonable to expect one person to take proceedings on her own responsibility, but that they should be taken on the responsibility of the community at large: see Denning LJ ... It was proved by the Crown that the public, meaning a considerable number of persons or a section of the public, was affected, as distinct from individual persons.}}

This was followed in a number of cases such as ''R v Holliday and Leboutillier'' (2004) EWCA Crim 1847&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2004/1847.html R v Holliday and Leboutillier] [2004] EWCA Crim 1847&lt;/ref&gt; in which two animal liberation activists made a large number of telephone calls to employees and shareholders of certain companies whose activities the appellants opposed. The calls were designed to jam the company telephone switchboards, and some of them were threatening and intimidating.

==The law reviewed==
In ''R v Goldstein and Rimmington'' (2005) UKHL 63 &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/uk/cases/UKHL/2005/UKHL_2005_63.html Rimmington, R v (2005) UKHL 63 (21 July 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; two separate appeal cases were considered together. The Lords began their judgment with a detailed review of the law and its history. Two arguments were raised by the defence. The first was that most of the factual situations that might otherwise have been criminal public nuisances, had now been covered by statutes. Thus, for example, s1 [[Protection from Harassment Act 1997]] would now be used in cases involving multiple telephone calls, and s63 [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]] confers powers on the police to remove persons attending or preparing for a rave "at which amplified music is played during the night (with or without intermissions) and is such as, by reason of its loudness and duration and the time at which it is played, is likely to cause serious distress to the inhabitants of the locality". These statutes had, in effect, made the common law offence redundant and it should no longer be considered an offence in English law. The Lords agreed that, as a matter of practice, all alleged offences falling within the remit of statutes would now be charged under those statutes. It also accepted that this left only a very small scope for the application of the common law offence. But, just as the courts had no power to create new offences (''R v Withers''), and could not widen existing offences so as to retrospectively criminalise conduct (''R v Misra and Srivastava'' (2004) EWCA Crim 2375), it equally had no power to abolish existing offences. However, cases such as ''R v Norbury'' and ''R v Johnson (Anthony)'' would now be charged under the relevant statutes.

The second argument raised by the defence was that the law lacked the certainty to be valid under Article 7 [[European Convention on Human Rights]].
:"No punishment without law
::(1)  No one shall be held guilty of any criminal offence on account of any act or omission which did not constitute a criminal offence under national or international law at the time when it was committed. Nor shall a heavier penalty be imposed than the one that was applicable at the time the criminal offence was committed."
Of all the common law offences considered at Strasbourg, only the criterion of "''contra bonos mores''" had been held to lack the appropriate quality of certainty (see ''Hashman and Harrup v United Kingdom'' (1999) 30 EHRR 241). The Lords therefore held that, as defined in Archbold, the offence did have sufficient certainty so that any legal practitioner asked to advise on whether proposed conduct was likely to be criminal, would be able to give an accurate answer.

===Goldstein's appeal===
As a cultural reference, Goldstein sent an envelope to a friend of his containing a small quantity of salt. Some of this salt escaped from the envelope at a postal sorting office, which was closed as a precaution so that tests could be carried out to determine whether the material spilt was dangerous. The Lords accepted that a significant number of people were disadvantaged by the closure of the sorting office and the loss of delivery on that day, but held that the appellant did not have the appropriate ''mens rea'' because he did not know or reasonably should have known (because the means of knowledge were available to him) that the salt would escape in the sorting office or in the course of postal delivery.

==In popular culture==
In the [[Marx Brothers]] film ''[[Duck Soup (1933 film)|Duck Soup]]'', [[Groucho Marx]] plays the president of the mythical land of Freedonia. One day while in his office, he hears a noisy peanut vendor ([[Chico Marx]]) out in the street. "Do you want to be a public nuisance?" Groucho asks. "Sure," Chico replies, "how much does the job pay?"

[[Image:Five positions of dancing Wilson 1811.jpg|thumb|The five positions of Dancing. T. Wilson's ''Analysis of Country Dancing'' instruction manual, 1811.]]
'''Regency dance''' is the term for [[historical dance]]s of the period ranging roughly from 1790 to 1825.  Some feel that the popular use of the term "Regency dance" is not technically correct, as the actual [[English Regency]] (the future George IV ruling on behalf of mad King George III) lasted only from 1811 until 1820.  However, the term "Regency" has been used to refer to a much broader period than the historical Regency for a very long time, particularly in areas such as the history of art and architecture, literature, and clothing.  This is because there are consistencies of style over this period which make having a single term useful.

Most popular exposure to this era of dance comes in the works of [[Jane Austen]].  Balls occur in her novels and are discussed in her letters, but specifics are few.  Films based on her works tend to incorporate modern revival [[English Country Dance]]; however, they rarely incorporate dances actually of the period and do them without the appropriate footwork and social style which make them accurate to the period.  Dances of this era were lively and bouncy, not the smooth and stately style seen in films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kickery.com/2008/03/regency-dancers.html |title=Capering &amp; Kickery: Real Regency Dancers Don't Turn Single: Ten Tips for Judging Authenticity |website=Kickery.com |date=2008-03-12 |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Steps ranging from simple skipping to elaborate ballet-style movements were used.

In the early part of this period, up to the early 1810s, the ballroom was dominated by the country dance, the [[cotillion]], and the scotch reel.  

In the longways Country Dance, a line of couples perform figures with each other, progressing up and down the line. Regency country dances were often proceeded by a brief March by the couples, then begun by the top lady in the set and her partner, who would dance down the set to the bottom. Each couple in turn as they reached the top would likewise dance down until the entire set had returned to its original positions. This could be a lengthy process, easily taking an hour in a long set.  An important social element was the calling of the dance by the leading lady (a position of honor), who would determine the figures, steps, and music to be danced.  The rest of the set would listen to the calling dancing master or pick up the dance by observing the leading couple.  Austen mentions in her letters instances in which she and her partner called the dance.

The cotillion was a French import, performed in a square using more elaborate footwork.  It consisted of a "chorus" figure unique to each dance which was danced alternately with a standard series of up to ten "changes", which were simple figures such as a right hand moulinet (star) common to cotillions in general.

The scotch reel of the era consisted of alternate heying (interlacing) and setting (fancy steps danced in place) by a line of three or four dancers.  More complex reels appear in manuals as well but it's unclear if they ever actually caught on.  A sixsome reel is mentioned in a description of Scottish customs in the early 1820s and eightsome reels (danced in squares like cotillions) occur in some dance manuscripts of the era.

In the 1810s, the era of the Regency proper, English dance began an important transition with the introduction of the [[quadrille]] and the [[waltz]].

The [[Waltz]] was first imported to England around 1810, but it was not considered socially acceptable until continental visitors at the post-Napoleonic-Wars celebrations danced it in London—and even then it remained the subject of anti-waltz diatribes, caricatures, and jokes. Even the decadent [[Lord Byron]] was scandalized by the prospect of people "embracing" on the dance floor.  The Regency version is relatively slow, and done up on the balls of the feet with the arms in a variety of graceful positions. The Sauteuse is a leaping waltz commonly done in 2/4 rather than 3/4 time, similar in pattern (leap-glide-close) to the Redowa and Waltz Galop of the later nineteenth century.

First imported from France by Lady Jersey in 1815, the [[Quadrille]] was a shorter version of the earlier cotillions.  Figures from individual cotillions were assembled into sets of five or six figures, and the changes were left out, producing much shorter dances.  By the late 1810s, it was not uncommon to dance a series of quadrilles during the evening, generally consisting of the same first three figures combined with a variety of different fourth and fifth figures.  Jane Austen's niece Fanny danced quadrilles and in their correspondence Jane mentions that she finds them much inferior to the cotillions of her own youth.

By the late 1810s, under siege from the Quadrille, dancing masters began to invent "new" forms of country dance, often with figures borrowed from the Quadrille, and giving them exotic names such as the Danse Ecossoise and Danse Espagnuole which suggested entire new dances but actually covered very minor variations in the classic form.  A few of these dances became sufficiently popular that they survived through the entire 19th century.  One example of this is the "Spanish dance" popular in vintage dance circles, which is a solitary survivor of its entire genre of Regency-era dances.

==Some other dances of the era==

"La Boulangere", the only dance mentioned by name in Jane Austen's writings, is a simple circle dance for a group of couples. [[Roger de Coverley|Sir Roger de Coverly]], mentioned by [[Charles Dickens]], is the ancestor of America's [[Virginia reel (dance)|Virginia Reel]].

Numerous instruction manuals survive from the Regency era. Several by Thomas Wilson are in the US Library of Congress online collection.  The Scotch Reel is described by [[Francis Peacock]], whose manual is also available in the LC collection.

==Revival==

[[File:Historical dancing baroque at time travellers ball earthly delights dance group.JPG|thumb|Dancing through the ages - Time Traveler Ball with dances from the 15th to 20th century]]
The first major revival of [[English Country Dance]], one of the major types of Regency dance, was by Englishman [[Cecil Sharp]] in the early 20th century.  Various other revivals have followed, most using at least some of Sharp's research.  Today, there are many groups around the world which perform a variety of English period dances, including many of the types of dance which were popular during the English Regency.

Regency dance has gained popularity at [[science fiction convention]]s, in part due to the efforts of [[John Hertz (fan)|John Hertz]]. Reconstructed dances from the era are taught to newcomers and experienced dancers alike. Some authors—notably, [[Larry Niven]]—have added their personal enthusiasm to the trend. Needless to say, Regency dance provides new opportunities for [[SF fandom|SF fen]]—typically avid [[costume]]rs—to develop and wear new regalia.

In [[Silicon Valley]], the [[Bay Area English Regency Society]] sponsors local dance classes and formal balls in churches, community centers, and other venues.
Some enthusiasts go to extremes:  [[Cisco Systems]] founders [[Sandra Lerner]] and [[Len Bosack]]  created a [[Private foundation|foundation]] that bought a Regency-era country house once owned by [[Jane Austen]]'s brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oook.info/us101/lerner.html |title=Sandy Lerner |website=Oook.info |date= |accessdate=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Australia, [http://www.earthlydelights.com.au/dance-events/upcoming Earthly Delights Historic Dance Academy] and [http://www.earthlydelights.com.au/about-us/john-gardiner-garden John Gardiner-Garden] run a Regency Dance School in conjunction with [http://www.janeaustenfestival.com.au Jane Austen Festival Australia] every April.

'''''Satyagraha''''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|s|ɑː|t|j|ə|'|ɡ|r|ɑː|h|ɑː}}; [[Sanskrit]] सत्याग्रह, ''satyāgraha'' "insistence on truth") is a 1979 [[opera]] in three acts for orchestra, chorus and soloists, composed by [[Philip Glass]], with a [[libretto]] by Glass and [[Constance DeJong (writer)|Constance DeJong]].

Loosely based on the life of [[Mahatma Gandhi]], it forms the second part of Glass's "Portrait Trilogy" of operas about men who changed the world, which includes ''[[Einstein on the Beach]]'' and ''[[Akhnaten (opera)|Akhnaten]]''.

Glass's style can broadly be described as [[minimalist music|minimalist]]. The work is scored for 2 [[soprano]]s, 2 [[mezzo-soprano]]s, 2 [[tenor]]s, a [[baritone]], 2 [[bass (voice type)|basses]], a large [[SATB]] chorus, and an orchestra of [[string section|strings]] and [[woodwinds]] only, no [[Brass instrument|brass]] or [[percussion]]. Principal roles are [[Sonja Schlesin]], Mahatma  Gandhi, [[Hermann Kallenbach]] and Parsi Rustomji.

The title refers to Gandhi's concept of non-violent resistance to injustice, [[Satyagraha]], and the text, from the ''[[Bhagavad Gita]]'', is sung in the original Sanskrit. In performance, translation is usually provided in [[supertitles]].

==Performance history==

The '''Sekrenyi festival''', known locally as '''Phousanyi''', is a major annual festival of the [[Angami Naga]]s, among the many festivals held by them, in the [[Northeast India|northeast Indian state]] of [[Nagaland]]. It is observed for ten days from the 25th day of the Angami calendar month of "''Kezei''" (usually corresponding to 25 February in the Gregorian calendar) under the auspices of the Angami Public Organisation in association with many other organizations and the state government. It is a "purification festival" held to wash off all past sins.&lt;ref name=Correspondent&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1120224/jsp/northeast/story_15170784.jsp#.VxEEqf7Nsmw|title=Nagas to celebrate Sekrenyi|date=24 February 2016|accessdate=23 May 2016|newspaper=Telegraph India}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Naga&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kohima.nic.in/MAJOR%20FESTIVAL.htm|title=The Major Festival: Sekrenyi.|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=National Informatics Center}}&lt;/ref&gt; The objective of the festival is to renew and "make holy" by cleansing the "body and the soul" of the village as a whole, and to bring forth unity among all communities of Nagaland. It also marks initiation of young people to adulthood and is considered an "identity marker of the Angami".&lt;ref name="Joshi2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Joshi|first=Vibha |title=A Matter of Belief: Christian Conversion and Healing in North-East India|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PWZjsBvrQCMC&amp;pg=PA106|date=15 September 2012|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-0-85745-673-1|pages=12, 106–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Angami&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.aninews.in/newsdetail2/story41784/Nagaland's-Angami-Tribe-celebrates-Sekrenyi-Festival.html|title=Nagaland's Angami Tribe celebrates Sekrenyi Festival Nagaland's Angami Tribe celebrates Sekrenyi Festival|date=16 March 2016|accessdate=24 May 2016|publisher=ANI News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Christian converts among the tribals have gradually rejected these rituals.

==Details==
Sekrenyi is a compound word formed by 'sekre' meaning "sanctification" and 'thenyi' meaning "festival." The festival calendar is linked to the agricultural cycle, which varies from village to village. Thus, the celebration is held between the months of December–March, and the duration also varies from ten to fifteen days.&lt;ref name="Joshi2012"/&gt;

The festival is generally held starting from 25 February as per the [[Gregorian calendar]].&lt;ref name=Naga/&gt; It is celebrated by both the Kruna Angami and Christian Angami. The duration is reduced to five days for the [[Christian]] villagers who had earlier converted to [[Christianity]] but belonged to the same tribe; they participate in the festivities but they do not follow any of the rituals connected with it.&lt;ref name="Joshi2012"/&gt;

==Rituals==
[[File:Angami_1723b.jpg|right|thumb|Angami tribe at an annual festival]] 
A number of rituals and ceremonies are involved with the festival. On the first day, which is known as "Kezie", people sprinkle themselves with a few drops of rice water drawn from a pot named "Zumho". The water drops are first gathered into leaves, and the chief lady of the house reverently fixes the leaves at the three main corner pillars of the house. This is followed by the men assembling at the well to bathe.&lt;ref name=Naga/&gt;

On the second day, young men of the village assemble in the village to perform [[Ritual purification|ablutions]]. They adorn themselves with two new [[shawl]]s, and then ritualistically sprinkle the holy water on their chests, knees and right arms as a mark of washing away all their sins and ill luck. When they come back from the well, a sacrificial offer of a cock is performed.&lt;ref name=Naga/&gt;

The fourth day of the festival marks the New Year of the Angamis.&lt;ref name="Joshi2012"/&gt; It begins with revelry by singing and feasting which lasts for three days. The young people, both men and unmarried girls with shaven heads gather and sing traditional songs the entire day; the songs relate to past days of valour and bravery.&lt;ref name=Naga/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maitra2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kiranshankar Maitra|title=Nagaland : The Land of Sunshine|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-L7qAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA78|date=15 September 2011|publisher=Anjali Publishers|isbn=978-81-89620-92-9|pages=78–}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the revelry 
of music and dance, the men and women of the community wear traditional dress; while men carry head hunting spades, women carry baskets.&lt;ref name=Angami/&gt;

The seventh day is devoted to hunting by the young men of the tribe. On the eighth day, the ritual involves pulling down of a gate (meaning replacing an old gate that demarcates the property). This is followed in the next two days by the people of villages formally exchanging visits and offering greetings. During the period of the ten day festivities, field operations are suspended; in local terminology this act is called ''Penyû''.&lt;ref name=Naga/&gt; Following the completion of the festival period, when men of the villages have cleansed themselves and sought blessings, cultivation, house building and marriages may restart for the year.&lt;ref name="Joshi2012"/&gt;

'''Starrcade (1984)''' was a major [[professional wrestling]] [[closed-circuit television]] [[List of NWA/WCW closed-circuit events and pay-per-view events|event]] that was produced by [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) under the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) banner. It took place on November 22, 1984 at the [[Greensboro Coliseum]] in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]]. The main event of the show was billed as "the Million Dollar Challenge" as the storyline was that the winner of the match would not only win the [[NWA World Heavyweight Championship]] but also win a $1,000,000 purse, part of the illusion that [[professional wrestling]] was a legitimate sporting competition. The main event saw champion "The Nature Boy" [[Ric Flair]] defend the championship against long time rival "The American Dream" [[Dusty Rhodes (wrestler)|Dusty Rhodes]], with boxer [[Joe Frazier]] acting as the special guest referee for the match. The show also saw the championship matches for the [[NWA United States Championship]], [[NWA World Television Championship]], [[NWA Florida Heavyweight Championship]], [[NWA Brass Knuckles Championship (Mid-Atlantic version)|NWA Brass Knuckles Championship]] and [[NWA Mid-Atlantic Heavyweight Championship]].

In 2014, the [[WWE Network]] included the previous Starrcades ([[Starrcade (1983)|1983]]–[[Starrcade#1986|1986]]), which had been transmitted via [[closed-circuit television]], alongside the rest of the Starrcades in the pay-per-view section.

==Production==
===Background===
From the 1960s to the 1980s, it was tradition for the [[National Wrestling Alliance]] (NWA) member [[Jim Crockett Promotions]] (JCP) to hold major [[professional wrestling]] events at Thanksgiving and [[Christmas]], often at the [[Greensboro Coliseum]] in [[Greensboro]], [[North Carolina]] in the center of JCP's [[Virginia]], North and [[South Carolina]] territory. In 1983, JCP created Starrcade as their [[Card (sports)|supercard]] to continue the Thanksgiving tradition, bringing in wrestlers from other NWA affiliates and broadcasting the show its territory on [[closed-circuit television]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.midatlanticgateway.com/Resource_Center/thanksgiving/1983.htm|title=Flair defeats Race for wrestling title|work= Greensboro Daily News|page=D3|date=1983-11-25|accessdate=2008-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Starrcade soon became the flagship event of the year for JCP (later [[World Championship Wrestling]], WCW), their [[Super Bowl]] event featuring their most important storyline [[Feud (professional wrestling)|feuds]] and championship matches. The 1984 event was the second show to use the Starrcade name.

===Storylines===
The Starrcade show featured a number of [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing, scripted feuds, plots, and storylines. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5341">'''Startups.com''' was the "ultimate dot-com startup", founded in 1998 &lt;ref name="complex"&gt;Evans, Sean. [http://www.complex.com/tech/2012/10/the-50-worst-internet-startup-fails-of-all-time/startups "The 50 Worst Internet Startup Fails of All Time"], ''[[Complex (magazine)|Complex]]'', 18 October 2012. Accessed March 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Startups.com was based in Silicon Valley and had offices in New York and Boston.

==Operations==

Startups.com was a venture-backed accelerator which had a niche market during the [[dot-com bubble]] boom where it would partner with other [[startup company|startup companies]] to handle many of the details of setting up office and operations so these companies could focus on their core business, operate more efficiently and get to market faster. The minimum fee was $25,000, scaling upwards depending on the scope of the project.&lt;ref name="intNews"&gt;Boulton, Clint. [http://www.internetnews.com/bus-news/article.php/314701/Startupscom+Flight+of+the+Virtual+Incubator.htm "Startups.com: Flight of the Virtual Incubator"], ''InternetNews.com'', 3 March 2000. Accessed March 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the services provided by Startups.com included Real Estate and Space Planning, Interior Design and Furniture, Technology Infrastructure, Telecommunications and Voice Mail, Legal and Accounting, Payroll, Benefits and Staffing, Insurance, Marketing Communications and Launch Events. In the fall of 2000, Startups.com launched an online Internet business infrastructure procurement system named [[ReferralXpert]]. Its roster of clients included [[Google]], [[Epinions]], [[eVite]], and [[GuruNet]] (now called Answers.com).

==History==

Startups.com was founded in 1998 with CEO Donna Jensen, a former VentureOne executive, and Director of Services Justin Segal.&lt;ref name="intNews"/&gt; Segal drew on previous experience as a law school graduate renting office space out to startup companies.&lt;ref name="intNews"/&gt;

The company was officially launched business operations on March 1, 2000, after securing capital from investors.&lt;ref name="lib1"&gt;[http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Startups.com+Raises+$15+Million+in+Second+Round%3B+Funding+From+Leading...-a061994242 "Startups.com Raises $15 Million in Second Round; Funding From Leading VC Firms and Private Investors Fuels Expansion."], ''BusinessWire'', 10 May 2000. Accessed March 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 10, it announced it had secured $15 million in a second round of funding.&lt;ref name="lib1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="note1" group="note"&gt;The lead investor was Redleaf Venture Management, followed by Garage.com, Constantin Partners, CrossFire Ventures, Roni Capital, Staenberg Venture Partners, Venture Factory, and angel investors.&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2000, Startups.com opened its New York office.&lt;ref name="release"&gt;[http://www.ereleases.com/pr/startupscom-announces-the-opening-of-its-new-york-office-at-the-art-of-the-startup-gala-event-to-celebrate-a-smarter-way-of-building-fasttrack-startups-92 "Startups.com Announces the Opening of its New York Office at "The Art of the Startup" Gala; Event to Celebrate a Smarter Way of Building Fast-Track Startups"]. Press Release. 2 November 2000. Accessed March 1, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

In early 2001, after the market shifted and many of the other startup companies went out of business, Startups.com attempted to transition to a research company focused on the startup market. It also changed its name first to Startups, Inc. and ultimately to Startups Intelligence Group.

Due to the massive change in market conditions, in January 2002 Startups.com made the decision to return millions in capital to investors and officially closed its doors, fading into history as a part of the dot-com era.

==Later history==

In January 2008, the domain name Startups.com was acquired by [[KillerStartups]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://killerstartups.com Killerstartups.com]&lt;/ref&gt; forming a new company called Network, Inc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.startupsnetwork.com/ Startupsnetwork.com]&lt;/ref&gt; based in [[Miami, FL]].

The founders launched new businesses after Startups.com shut down: Donna Jensen launched [[Belle Escape]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://belleescape.com BelleEscape.com]&lt;/ref&gt;, an online furniture store, and Justin Segal co-founded Stemmons Enterprise, an enterprise software company. &lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbinsights.com/research/dot-com-bubble-companies/]&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 5, 2009, Startups.com was relaunched as a wiki Q&amp;A website.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2009/11/05/startups-com-becomes-a-qa-site-for-business-questions/ Techcrunch.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2011, Startups.com was relaunched as a daily deal retail site, but was not profitable and was shut down on May 4, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://techcrunch.com/2012/05/04/startups-com-is-shutting-down-domain-name-not-for-sale-for-now/]&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 21, 2012, the Startups.com domain went on sale.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.domaininvesting.com/startups-com-for-sale/]&lt;/ref&gt; It has since been purchased.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5546">[[File:Teatro Verdi.JPG|thumb|right|280px|Facade of Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi]]
The '''Teatro Lirico Giuseppe Verdi''' is an [[opera house]] located in [[Trieste]], Italy and named after the [[composer]] [[Giuseppe Verdi]]. Privately constructed, it was inaugurated as the '''Teatro Nuovo''' to replace the smaller 800-seat "Cesareo Regio Teatro di San Pietro" on 21 April 1801 with a performance of [[Johann Simon Mayr]]'s ''[[Ginevra di Scozia]]''. Initially, the Nuovo had 1,400 seats. In 1821, it became known as the '''Teatro Grande'''.

By the end of the 18th century, the need for a new theatre in Trieste became evident. Its main theatre, the Teatro di San Pietro, had become increasingly inadequate and finally closed its doors in 1800. A proposal to the Austrian Chancery from Giovanni Matteo Tommasini to build a private theatre had existed since 1795 and, in June 1798, a contract was drawn up whereby annual funding would come from the municipality and Tommasini would hold the rights to several boxes and the rights to sell others. [[Gian Antonio Selva]], the architect of the [[La Fenice]] in [[Venice]], was engaged, and he designed a classic horseshoe-shaped auditorium.  However, his exterior designs were considered to be too plain for the Austrians who then engaged another architect, Matteo Pertsch, to solve the problem, which was accomplished by incorporating elements of [[Milan]]'s [[La Scala]] opera house. The "Nuovo" became a mixture of La Fenice on the inside and La Scala on the exterior.

==History==
Several name changes have occurred during the theatre's lifetime, the first in 1821 when it became the ''Teatro Grande'' &lt;ref&gt;"To distinguish it from those less illustrious", Lynn, p.82&lt;/ref&gt; and it was under this name that the theatre was the site of two Verdi opera premieres: ''[[Il corsaro]]'' in 1848 (featuring the soprano [[Giuseppina Strepponi]], who Verdi married in 1859, in the leading role) and ''[[Stiffelio]]'', a production which Verdi supervised - not without controversy - in 1850.&lt;ref&gt;"Leave the libretto as it is or I will withdraw the opera", Verdi, quoted in Lynn, p.85&lt;/ref&gt; However, before these premieres, Verdi's operas had begun to dominate the Teatro Grande's stage, followed, as the century progressed, by all the major works of the opera repertoire, including those by [[Puccini]] and [[Wagner]].

A further name change followed in 1861 due to a change from private to public ownership. Thus it became the ''Teatro Comunale'' and existed as such throughout the latter years of the 19th century.  By 1881, seating capacity had been increased to 2,000 through the use of existing standing room spaces; but, by that December, the theatre was declared to be unsafe and it was closed for renovations, during which electricity replaced gas lighting for the reopening in 1889 with 1,000 seats.

Within hours of his death in January 1901,&lt;ref name="Lynn"&gt;Lynn, p.83&lt;/ref&gt; the theatre was once again renamed, this time to honour the memory of Giuseppe Verdi. It was extensively restored between 1992 and 1997 and re-opened with about 1,300 seats&lt;ref&gt;"il "Verdi" ha attualmente, a seguito dell’ultima ristrutturazione, la capienza originale di circa 1300 posti", Theatre's website&lt;/ref&gt; and with a ''Viva Verdi'' concert&lt;ref name="Lynn"/&gt; which included excerpts from many of the composer's operas.  (Like the restoration of [[La Scala]] between 2001 and 2004, a temporary alternative venue was quickly created in Trieste and the ''Sala Tripcovich'' continues to offer space for chamber opera and operettas.)

A major feature of the Teatro Verdi's programming in the past 40 years, which stems from the original Austrian occupation of the city in the 19th century and the fact that Trieste did not become part of Italy until 1918, is the "International Festival of Operetta" which takes place every summer.

==Premieres==
The theatre has seen the world premieres of the following operas:
*''Ginevra di Scozia'' by [[Simon Mayr]], 21 April 1801
* ''Annibale in Capua'' by [[Antonio Salieri]] 20 May 1801 &lt;ref&gt;Rice, John, [https://books.google.com/books?id=8YOwT4hOUQAC&amp;pg=PA602&amp;dq=%22Annibale+in+Capua%22++Salieri+May+1801 ''Antonio Salieri and Viennese Opera]'', University of Chicago Press, 1998, p. 602. {{ISBN|0-226-71125-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Ricciarda di Edimburgo'' by [[Cesare Pugni]], 29 September 1832.
*''Enrico II'' by [[Otto Nicolai]], 26 November 1839 &lt;ref&gt;originally given at the first performance as ''Rosmonda d'Inghilterra''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The story is set during the 1930s, and is based on the [[Korean independence movement|anti-Japanese guerrilla movement]] during [[Korea under Japanese rule|the period of Japanese occupation in Korea]].&lt;ref name=yulesohu/&gt;&lt;ref name=zjol/&gt;&lt;ref name=ifengn&gt;2008年04月15日, [http://news.ifeng.com/mainland/200804/0415_17_492610.shtml 朝鲜歌剧《卖花姑娘》在京演出 刘云山出席观看] – [[Phoenix TV]]&lt;/ref&gt; A poor, rural girl, around whom the plot is centred, picks flowers on the mountain every day to sell at the market,{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} to care for her ill mother. Additionally, she has a blind sister, and her father is deceased.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} Her mother is in debt to the landlord, and is bankrupt and unable to purchase food. The landlord's subordinates frequently harass the girl and call for her to work for them, to which her mother refuses. The girl then finds her blind sister attempting to earn money by singing on the street, to her anger.

Eventually, she collects enough money to purchase medicine for her ill mother, but by the time she returns, her mother has already died. The landlord's wife becomes very sick, and suspects that the flower girl's blind sister is possessed by the spirit of her deceased mother, and so arranges for her to be frozen to death in the snow. When the flower girl returns home and asks where her sister has gone, the landlord's subordinates chain her up. At this moment, her brother, who has joined the [[Korean People's Army#History|Revolutionary Army]], returns home to visit family when he realises that the flower girl has been locked up, and so organises a group of villagers to overthrow the landlord.

==Creation==
''The Flower Girl'' is based on a play written by [[Kim Il-sung]] in the 1930s while he was imprisoned by the Japanese,{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} in [[Jilin]].&lt;ref name=yulesohu/&gt; The first section of his 1992 memoir ''[[With the Century]]'', entitled "Anti-Japanese Revolution", notes that:&lt;ref name=cn1994&gt;[朝]金日成:与世纪同行，郑万兴译，北京：中国社会科学出版社，1994年.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
There was a time during our country's independence movement where we held on to our vision to build an "ideal village" concept... At the time, we adopted the Korean students in Jilin to teach village people to sing a large variety of revolutionary songs, such as the ''Red Flag Song'' and ''Revolution Song''. In [[Wujiazi]] we formed a performance group based at Samsong school led by Kye Yong-chun. It was during this time that I was completing the script for ''The Flower Girl'', which I had started whilst I was in Jilin City. Upon finishing the script, production of the opera began, and we staged the opera in the Samsong school hall on the 13th anniversary of the [[October Revolution]]. For many years after liberation, the opera hadn't been performed since, until it was improved and adapted for film, and re-written as a novel, under the guidance of the Organising Secretary (Kim Jong-il) and released in the early 1970s.&lt;ref group="FN" name="fn_1"&gt;English translation of memoir is abridged from the original text for conciseness, and is based on the 1994 Chinese-language publication.&lt;br /&gt;Original memoir text from the Chinese-language version published in 1994, unabridged:

"有一个时期，我国的独立运动者们抱着要建设一个“理想村”的构想，为实现这个构想从各方面作过努力……当时在吉林文光中学念书的朝鲜学生当中，有几个来自孤榆树和五家子的青年，他们常夸五家子是个好地方。因此，我就开始注意五家子，并决心把这个村改造成革命村。 1930年10月，我从东满来到五家子……当时，我们通过学生，给村里的人教唱了很多革命的歌曲。《赤旗歌》、《革命歌》等革命歌曲，只要到学校去教唱一次，当天就传遍全村。 五家子村有个由我们组织起来的演艺队。在桂永春的领导下，这个演艺队以三星学校为据点，积极开展了活动。 我也着手完成《卖花姑娘》的剧本。这个剧本，我在吉林市就已开始写，并已试演过几次。剧本一完成，桂永春就带领三星学校的戏剧小组成员开始排练。 在十月革命13周年纪念日那天，我们在三星学校礼堂演出了这出歌剧。这出歌剧解放后长期被埋没，到了70年代初，才在党中央组织书记的指导下，由我们的作家、艺术工作者改编成电影、歌剧和小说公诸于世。组织书记为此付出了很大的力量。"

&lt;br /&gt;Alternate English translation provided by [http://www.korea-dpr.com/lib/202.pdf Korea-DPR.com] (page 276 of 2161):

"In Wujiazi we had formed an art troupe. This troupe was based at Samsong School and worked successfully under the guidance of Kye Yong Chun. I worked hard to complete the libretto of ''The Flower Girl'' which I had begun to write in my days in Jirin and then staged rehearsals for it. Once the libretto was finished, Kye started the production of the opera with the members of the drama group that had been formed at the school. We staged this opera in the hall of the Samsong School on the 13th anniversary of the October Revolution. This opera was not seen on stage for many years after liberation, and then was improved and adapted for the screen, re-written as a novel by our writers and artistes under the guidance of Organizing Secretary Kim Jong Il and presented to the public in the early 1970s. At that time the Organizing Secretary did a lot of work."&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although it is commonly stated that Kim Il-sung was the sole author of the production, many critics{{Who|date=May 2017}} in China cast doubts over the reliability of the claim, and suggest that other North Korean writers may have also had some form of interaction in the opera's production.

The first official premiere of the opera production was held on November 30, 1972 in [[Pyongyang]], where it was hailed as a great success.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

According to official North Korean reports, in April 1968, [[Kim Jong-il]] suggested that another revolutionary opera, ''[[Sea of Blood]]'', be adapted for a film. Since then, other works have also been adapted into movies "under his guidance", including ''The Flower Girl''.&lt;ref name=zjol/&gt;&lt;ref name=people/&gt;&lt;ref name=ifengc&gt;2008年10月20日, [http://culture.ifeng.com/abroad/200810/1020_4088_837633.shtml 领袖缔造文化 金正日导演《卖花姑娘》?] – [[Phoenix TV]]&lt;/ref&gt; The opera was intended to promote the communist ideology, by incorporating themes such as the [[class struggle]] against the [[bourgeois]];&lt;ref name=chnchosun&gt;2008.04.17, [http://chn.chosun.com/site/data/html_dir/2008/04/17/20080417000021.html (记者手册)“卖花姑娘”让中国观众回忆革命] – 韩国朝鲜日报中文网络版&lt;/ref&gt; such themes were similarly maintained in the film.&lt;ref name=people/&gt;

In April 1972, the film adaptation was officially launched. The film was directed by Choe Ik-kyu and the script was written by Pak Hak; ''Paekdu-san Group'' was responsible for the production of the film.&lt;ref name=nordkoreainfo/&gt;

==Reception==
According to Paul Fischer, the author of ''A Kim Jong-Il Production'', "it is almost impossible to exaggerate" the importance of ''The Flower Girl'' to North Korea's cultural history. The film was immensely popular both domestically and abroad, particularly in China. It was the first North Korean film to win an international film award,{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} at the 18th [[Karlovy Vary International Film Festival]] in 1972,&lt;ref name=nordkoreainfo/&gt; and remained the only one until the 1980s.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}}

The opera and its film adaptation were both well received in the [[People's Republic of China]] when they were introduced there since September 9, 1972, predominantly during the closing period of the [[Cultural Revolution]] and the beginning of the era of [[Deng Xiaoping]]'s rule, where the production was known by the name of ''The Flower-selling Girl'' ({{zh|c=卖花姑娘|p=Màihuā Gūniang|s=|t=}}).&lt;ref name=yulesohu/&gt;&lt;ref name=people/&gt;&lt;ref name=qdwhw&gt;2008-6-4, [http://www.qdwhw.com/newsdetails.aspx?news=967 难忘的演出 动情的告别——《卖花姑娘》中国巡演闭幕演出见闻] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110715133656/http://www.qdwhw.com/newsdetails.aspx?news=967 |date=2011-07-15 }} – 中国文化报&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=mydaily&gt;2008-04-30, [http://www.mydaily.co.kr/news/read.html?newsid=200804301437401115&amp;ext=na 中서 '대장금'은 조선족 드라마, 北의 '꽃파는 처녀'도 조선족 연극?] - Mydaily&lt;/ref&gt; A number of theatrical tours were made in China, which were performed in 1973, 1998, 2002 and 2008.&lt;ref name=people&gt;2008年04月08日, [http://culture.people.com.cn/GB/87423/7092387.html 朝鲜经典歌剧《卖花姑娘》再次巡演中国] - 人民网 文化&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=xinhuanet&gt;2008年05月30日, [http://news.xinhuanet.com/audio/2008-05/30/content_8282778.htm (娱眼观点)：朝鲜《卖花姑娘》 为何畅销中国] – XINHUA&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Chinese Premier [[Wen Jiabao]] was received by Hong Yong-hee during his visit to North Korea.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=62}} In China, the film adaptation of the opera was [[Dubbing (filmmaking)|dubbed]] by the [[Changchun Film Studio]], based on translations by {{ill|He Mingyan|zh|何鸣雁}}, who was earlier responsible in 1958 in the translation of the North Korean film adaptation of ''[[Chunhyangjeon]]''.&lt;ref name=tianjin&gt;Gu Yu-Bao (顾育豹), 2008年10月7日, [http://epaper.tianjinwe.com/tjrb/tjrb/2008-10/07/content_6013755.htm 突击译制《卖花姑娘》] - 天津日报&lt;/ref&gt; The entire translation process for ''The Flower Girl'' took only seven days.&lt;ref name=tianjin/&gt; Although the dialogue was dubbed in [[Mandarin Chinese]], song lyrics remained in [[Korean language|Korean]]. As the film was played in Chinese cinemas during the period of the [[Cultural Revolution]], the movie became immensely popular due to its [[proletarian revolution]]-based content, to the point where theaters even adopted a 24-hour screening cycle because of high ticket sales.&lt;ref name=tianjin/&gt;

As of 2008, the opera has been performed over 1,400 times in North Korea and more than 40 other countries,&lt;ref name=yulesohu /&gt; mostly [[Eastern Bloc]] states; other countries include France, Italy, Germany, Algeria and Japan.&lt;ref name=zjol /&gt;&lt;ref name=people /&gt; The title of the opera and film was known as ''Blomsterflickan'' in Sweden, ''Das Blumenmädchen'' in the German Democratic Republic, ''Kvetinárka'' in Czechoslovakia, and ''Kwiaciarka'' in Poland.

In [[South Korea]], the film was deemed as [[communist propaganda]] and a symbol of the enemy, and screening was banned; police were often mobilised when university students were found playing the film on campus, and the students were often accused of [[Subversion|being sympathetic]] with the North.&lt;ref name=nordkoreainfo&gt;[http://www.nordkorea-info.de/unacorea/flowergirl.htm ''Das Blumenmädchen'' (KOT PUNUN COJO)] – Nordkorea-info.de {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719065740/http://www.nordkorea-info.de/unacorea/flowergirl.htm |date=2011-07-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, the [[Supreme Court of South Korea]] ruled that ''The Flower Girl'' and six other North Korean films were "not favouring anti-ROK sentiments" in regards to national security laws.&lt;ref name=nordkoreainfo /&gt;

The film forged Hong Yong-hee into a film icon.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}} She is depicted on the [[North Korean won|North Korean one won]] banknote, in her role as the flower girl.&lt;ref name=nordkoreainfo/&gt; The film made [[Choe Ik-kyu]], the director, a confidant of Kim Jong-il.{{sfn|Fischer|2016|p=61}}

'''The Romp''' (also known as '''Romp.com''') was a Los Angeles-based entertainment website that specialized in original flash animation videos and games. It began operations in April 2000 and closed in 2005. The website was founded by Bruce Forman and [[Eric Eisner]], son of [[Michael Eisner]]. The site was known for its raunchy, politically incorrect content, and its target demographic (described by Eisner as "people who watch ''[[South Park]]'', listen to [[Howard Stern]] and read ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''&lt;ref name=latimes&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/apr/19/business/fi-21181 |title=Eisner's Son Makes Hollywood Debut, but Not on Prime Time |publisher=LA Times |author= Gellene, Denise and Marla Dickerson |date=April 19, 2000 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) were males aged 16 to 25.&lt;ref name=adweek&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/iq-interactive-special-report-e-content-romp-n-roll-36971 |title=IQ Interactive Special Report - E-content Romp 'n Roll |publisher=Adweek |author= Adweek Staff |date=July 3, 2000 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Eric Eisner and Bruce Forman met at [[UCLA]]'s [[UCLA Anderson School of Management|Anderson School of Management]], where they both earned their MBA degrees in June of 1999. They got the idea for a site targeting young men during their final months at UCLA.&lt;ref name=latimes/&gt; Eisner and Forman were 26 and 28 respectively when they put up the initial seed money for Romp.com in 2000 and followed that by drawing in $15 million from private investors.&lt;ref name=adweek /&gt; The site attracted nearly 200,000 users during its first six weeks. The company had 35 employees at one point, though it downsized to 14 in the fall of 2000. By March of 2001, Romp.com had 600,000 registered users.&lt;ref name=nypost&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nypost.com/2001/03/29/eisners-sons-site-romping-home/|title=Eisner's Son's Site Romping Home |publisher=NY Post |author= Gallivan, Joseph |date=March 29, 2001 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Romp.com started a subscription service called "The Romp Mafia" in March 2001, attracting 11,000 subscribers in its first three weeks.&lt;ref name=nypost /&gt;

==Content==
Romp.com was primarily known for its flash animation video series. The site also featured message boards (called "spew boards"), chat rooms, and softcore images of women. Some of Romp.com's web series included:
* ''[[Jake's Booty Call|Booty Call]]'' - a [[choose your own adventure]] game, co-created by Julian Max Metter and Cate McManus, in which users played as ladies' man Jake (voiced by Metter) and guided him in his quest to get laid. ''Booty Call'' was Romp.com's flagship show.
*''Tardz'' - a series about mentally-challenged white collar professionals
*''The Adventures of Bill and Ted'' - an animated series following the adventures of [[Bill Clinton]] and [[Ted Kennedy]]
*''Sex and the Inner City'' - a parody of the then-new HBO series ''[[Sex and the City]]''
*''Coach Bigot'' - an animated series about a stereotypically bigoted redneck little league coach

==Expansion to film, television, and magazines==

Romp.com quickly began to expand from the web to a full-fledged entertainment company. In the fall of 2000, Romp.com signed a development deal with [[Mandalay Sports Entertainment]] to produce reality game shows.&lt;ref name=variety&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2000/digital/news/romp-com-taking-content-offline-1117786793/ |title=IQ Interactive Special Report - E-content Romp 'n Roll |publisher=Variety |author= Graser, Marc |date=September 25, 2000 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two projects developed by the company included ''Peephole'', which involved people on the street being offered money to do outrageous things while contestants bet on how far the people on the street will go to get the money,&lt;ref name=entertainmentweekly&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/article/2000/10/20/romp |title=The Romp ''Sex and the City'' is spoofed on the comedy website|publisher=Entertainment Weekly |author= Robichson, Noah |date=October 20, 2000 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''The Hunt'', which followed contestants on a cross-country scavenger hunt,&lt;ref name=thr1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-65540130/peep-hunt-make-romp-web-tv |title='Peep,' 'Hunt' make Romp from Web to TV |publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |author= Bond, Paul |date=September 25, 2000 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but neither made it to the air.

Romp.com signed a deal with H&amp;S Media to create a mini-magazine of repurposed content to accompany H&amp;S's ''[[Maxim (magazine)|Maxim]]''-esque men's magazine ''The Edge''. Romp.com was in final talks with H&amp;S to create a standalone Romp magazine,&lt;ref name=variety2&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2001/digital/news/is-anybody-left-1117796615/ |title=Is Anybody Left? |publisher=Variety |author= Graser, Marc|date=April 5, 2001 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but that never came to fruition when H&amp;S went bankrupt in fall of 2001.&lt;ref name=chicagobusiness&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chicagobusiness.com/article/20010923/NEWS06/20003409/h-s-media-to-sell-magazines |title=H&amp;S Media to sell magazines|publisher=Chicago Business |author= Chicago Business staff |date=September 23, 2001 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After downsizing four employees and cutting the site's staff to 11, Forman announced plans for Romp.com to shift its focus from original web programming to traditional media in May 2001, concluding "it is mission impossible to make money off the Internet with original programming."&lt;ref name=thr2&gt;{{cite web |url=http://business.highbeam.com/2012/article-1G1-74650393/romp-finds-internet-plan-mission-impossible|title=Romp Finds Internet Plan Mission Impossible|publisher=The Hollywood Reporter |author=Marlowe, Chris |date=May 8, 2001 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Romp.com's production company offshoot, Romp Studios, independently produced ''[[Jake's Booty Call]]'', a feature-length version of the site's popular series ''Booty Call'', in 2003. The film, which was co-written and co-directed by Eric Eisner and ''Booty Call'' co-creator/star Julian Max Metter, was acquired by [[National Lampoon, Incorporated|National Lampoon]] for distribution.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4051">'''Tom, Dick or Harry''' is a [[show tune]] from the [[Cole Porter]] musical, ''[[Kiss Me, Kate]]'', introduced on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] on December 30, 1948 by [[Lisa Kirk]] (as Bianca); [[Harold Lang]] (as Lucentio); Edwin Clay (as Gremio); and [[Charles Wood (singer and actor)|Charles Wood]] (as Hortensio). In [[Kiss Me Kate (film)|the 1953 Hollywood film version]], "Tom, Dick or Harry" was performed by [[Ann Miller]] (as Bianca), [[Tommy Rall]] (as Lucentio), [[Bobby Van (actor)|Bobby Van]] (as Gremio) and [[Bob Fosse]] (as Hortensio).

==Performance and release information==
In this song, during a musical performance of Shakespeare's ''[[Taming of the Shrew]]'' (the [[subplot]] of ''Kate''), three suitors (Gremio, Lucentio and Hortensio) compete to win Bianca's affections (Gremio claiming wealth; Hortensio offering [[social standing]]; and Lucentio with a promise of love). Whereas other songs from ''Kiss Me, Kate'' (such as "[[So in Love]]" and "[[Too Darn Hot]]") were released as [[Single (music)|singles]] and achieved commercial success outside the show ("So in Love" reached the [[Top 40|top ten]] on the [[Hit Parade]] in 1949 and has since been [[Cover version|covered]] by scores of [[Musician|recording artists]]), "Tom, Dick or Harry" was written expressly to advance the ''Shrew'' subplot and is, therefore, a showtune in the truest sense of the word. This is why many studio (non-cast) recordings of ''Kiss Me, Kate'' do not include the song. Perhaps the best-known example of this is [[Frank Sinatra]]'s ''Kiss Me, Kate'' studio album which is part of his four album (four show) project that also includes ''[[Finian's Rainbow]]'' (1947), ''[[South Pacific (musical)|South Pacific]]'' (1949) and ''[[Guys and Dolls]]'' (1950) and which he produced in 1963 to promote his fledgling label, [[Reprise Records]]; hence the project title, the star-studded ''[[Reprise Musical Repertory Theatre]]''.

==Historical note==
In 1990, theatre historian Miles Krueger conducted an interview with [[Patricia Morison]] (who originated the title role in ''Kate'') to discuss the original production as well as the six songs dropped from the show prior to the Broadway opening. When asked about one of the deleted songs, "If Ever Married I'm", Morison responded by stating: "That was for Bianca.  It was replaced by 'Tom, Dick or Harry' which tells the same story".&lt;ref&gt;''Kiss Me, Kate'' complete score double CD recording ([[EMI]] Angel CDC-7-54034-2; Booklet, p.&amp;nbsp;19).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Performance in 2000==
On May 18, 2000, "Tom, Dick or Harry" was performed on [[NBC]]-TV's "''[[Today (NBC program)|Today]]''" show by 1999 Broadway [[Revival (theatre)|revival]] cast members [[Amy Spanger]] (as Bianca), [[Michael Berresse]] (as Lucentio), Kevin Neal McCready (as Gremio) and Darren Lee (as Hortensio) as a result of the show's having garnered the greatest number of [[Tony Award|Tony]] nominations (with twelve nominations) for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.playbill.com/article/kates-tom-dick-or-harry-will-dance-on-today-show-may-18-com-89302

Host [[Matt Lauer]] introduced the four performers outside on [[Manhattan]]'s [[Rockefeller Plaza]], interviewing Spanger and Berresse, while co-host [[Katie Couric]] remained in the studio. The Broadway revival of ''Kate'' went on to become the top winning show at the [[54th Tony Awards]] (the only show to garner five or more Tonys).

| title=The Treasure Hunt| publisher=[http://www.rethymnon.gr/ Tourism Promotion Committee of Rethymno Prefecture] | accessdate=22 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==All day long game==
During this long game, which lasts for one day, the whole town of Rethymno is involved. An outsider may wonder what everyone is doing running all day long within and outside (usually nearby) the town of Rethymno, on foot, by bike or by car. They search for the “treasure” and solve many quiz games to find it. It is an experience to watch a group in action or even participate in a group, although it is necessary to understand [[Greek language|Greek]] to do so.

==Similar games==
The Association of Hotel owners in co-operation with the [[Rethymno (municipality)|Municipality of Rethymno]] organises a similar treasure hunt game each summer, as part of the celebration of the "International Day of Tourism". Visitors of Rethymno are at that point invited to participate and the winners are awarded 'all included' holidays in Rethymno.&lt;ref name="ape1"/&gt;

The '''Two Minutes Hate''', from [[George Orwell]]'s novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', is a daily period in which Party members of the society of [[Oceania (1984)|Oceania]] must watch a film depicting the Party's enemies (notably [[Emmanuel Goldstein]] and his followers) and express their hatred for them for exactly two minutes.

==Details from ''Nineteen Eighty-Four''==
The protagonist's feelings, the psychological methods and their effects within a social setting are analyzed in detail by Orwell in the following passage:

{{block quote|The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but that it was impossible to avoid joining in. Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one's will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ebooks.adelaide.edu.au/o/orwell/george/o79n/chapter1.1.html|title=Nineteen Eighty-four, by George Orwell : chapter1.1|website=ebooks.adelaide.edu.au|accessdate=10 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The film and its accompanying auditory and visual cues (which include a grinding noise that Orwell describes as "of some monstrous machine running without oil") are a form of [[brainwashing]] to Party members, attempting to whip them into a frenzy of hatred and loathing for Emmanuel Goldstein and the current enemy superstate. Apparently, it is not uncommon for those caught up in the hate to physically assault or throw things at the [[telescreen]], as [[Julia (1984)|Julia]] does during the scene.

The film becomes more surreal as it progresses, with Goldstein's face [[morphing]] into a sheep as enemy soldiers advance on the viewers, before one such soldier [[Fourth wall|charges at the screen]], [[submachine gun]] blazing. He morphs, finally, into the face of [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] at the end of the two minutes. At the end, the mentally, emotionally, and physically exhausted viewers chant "B-B!...B-B!" over and over again, ritualistically.

Within the book, the purpose of the Two Minutes Hate is to satisfy the citizens' subdued feelings of [[angst]] and hatred from leading such a wretched, controlled existence. By re-directing these subconscious feelings away from the Oceanian government and toward external enemies (which may not even exist), the Party minimises subversive thought and behaviour.

In the first Two Minutes Hate of the book, the audience is introduced to [[Inner Party]] member and key character [[O'Brien (book character)|O'Brien]]. Within the novel, [[hate week]] is an extrapolation of the two-minute period into an annual week-long festival.

==Origins of the term==

Orwell did not invent the idea behind the term "two minutes hate"; it was already in use in the [[First World War]].&lt;ref name="leicestershire" /&gt; At that time, British writers [[satire|satirised]] the German campaign of hatred against the English, and imagined a [[Prussia]]n family sitting around the kitchen table having its "morning hate".&lt;ref name="mrpunch"&gt;{{cite web|last=Graves|first=Charles Larcom|url=http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11571/11571-h/11571-h.htm|title=Mr. Punch's History of the Great War 1919|publisher=[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]|via=Project Gutenberg|orig-year=First impression July 1919|date=14 March 2004|accessdate=11 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, short daily [[artillery]] bombardments made by either side during the [[First World War]], and aimed at disrupting enemy routines, were known as "hates":

{{quote|The evening of this same inspection was one of the few occasions on which Pommier was bombarded. A sudden ''two minutes&amp;rsquo; &amp;lsquo;hate&amp;rsquo;'' of about 40 shells, 4.2 and 5.9, wounded three men and killed both the C.O.&amp;rsquo;s horses, &amp;lsquo;Silvertail&amp;rsquo; and &amp;lsquo;Baby&amp;rsquo;|A record of 1/5th Battalion of the Leicestershire Regiment, T.F., during the First World War, 1914–1918&lt;ref name="leicestershire"&gt;{{cite web|author=5th Battalion the Leicestershire Regiment|url=http://www.bigenealogy.com/leicestershire/monchy_au_bois.htm|title=Monchy Au Bois|publisher=British Isle Genealogy|date=29 October 1916|accessdate=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
&lt;!--Orwell's could also be referring to the "Two Minutes Hate" satirical equivalent of the short British and Commonwealth ceremony of remembrance for those who gave their lives in [[World War I]]. The [[Armistice Day]] ceremony is called "two minutes' silence". --&gt;

==Use of Orwell's concept==
The attacks on the [[liberalism|liberal]] opposition by state-owned [[Russia|Russian]] [[television]] channels such as [[Russia-1|Russia-1]] have been characterised as reminiscent of the "two minutes hate". Russian television portrayed Ukrainian troops as monsters during the [[War in Donbass]]. One of the most notorious examples was a 2014 hoax report on [[Channel One Russia]] that [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] soldiers had [[crucifixion|crucified]] a three-year-old.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stephen|last=Ennis|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/monitoring/how-russian-tv-uses-psychology-over-ukraine|title=How Russian TV uses psychology over Ukraine|work=BBC.co.uk|date=4 February 2015|accessdate=20 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150302105212/http://www.bbc.co.uk/monitoring/how-russian-tv-uses-psychology-over-ukraine|archivedate=2 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American propaganda]] by the [[Committee on Public Information]] during [[World War I]] has also been compared to the propaganda in the "two minutes hate" program.&lt;ref name="Kennedy2004"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kennedy|first=David M.|authorlink=David M. Kennedy (historian)|title=Over Here: The First World War and American Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s6dSIuBcx1IC&amp;pg=PA62|accessdate=11 September 2017|date=16 September 2004|publisher=OUP USA|isbn=978-0-19-517399-4|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zero Robotics Finals 2.jpg|thumb|The Finals of the Zero Robotics competition aboard the JAXA module of the ISS]]
'''Zero Robotics''' is an international high school [[Computer Programming|programming]] competition where students control robotic [[SPHERES]] (Synchronised Position Hold Engage and Reorient Experimental Satellites) aboard the [[International Space Station]].&lt;ref name="mit"&gt;{{cite web|title=Zero Robotics |publisher=MIT |url=http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each year teams of students work to produce code capable to performing in a game which can be deployed on the SPHERES.  This game generally contains elements such as docking with objects, moving objects and destroying targets within a bounded area while monitoring fuel usage.

Initial stages of the competition occur online (with virtual SPHERES) with free team registration in the [[United States]], [[Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sydney.edu.au/engineering/study-engineering-and-it/why-study-here/high-school-students/zero-robotics.html |title=Zero Robotics |publisher=Usyd}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for [[ESA]] member countries and limited registration for international teams.  Teams are traditionally monitored by adult mentors and code submitted through the [[MIT]] website&lt;ref name="mit"/&gt;. Finalists compete in a live championship aboard the [[International Space Station|ISS]]. An astronaut conducts the final competition while communicating to teams through a live feed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=There are robots in the International Space Station coded by australian high school students |url=https://www.gizmodo.com.au/2018/01/there-are-robots-in-the-international-space-station-coded-by-australian-high-school-students/ |publisher=Gizmodo}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Zero Robotics competition was created by [[NASA]] Astronaut [[Gregory Chamitoff]] when he was working with the SPHERES and realised that the coding interface would be suitable for high school students.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;{{cite web|title=History |url=http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/history/ |publisher=MIT}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Drawing inspiration from [[FIRST Robotics]], Zero Robotics became a competition that emphasised building [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|science, technology, engineering, and maths]] skills with a component of cooperation between schools and nations.  It's inaugural competition was held in 2009, expansion to the entire US in 2010 and internationally in 2013.&lt;ref name="hist"/&gt; It currently includes schools from the US, [[Russia]], ESA affiliated states&lt;ref&gt;https://www.romania-insider.com/romanian-team-nasa-zero-robotics/&lt;/ref&gt; and Australia.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radio/sydney/programs/drive/zero-robotics/8643694&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tournaments ==
The Zero Robotics competition is divided into two types of tournaments.
* High School Tournament: Among students aged between 14 and 18 years. The tournament takes place between September and December each year. This is an international event open to teams from the USA, Australia, Russia, ESA member states and select international teams.

* Middle School Summer Program. This is dedicated to younger students. It is a five-week program in which students learn to program through a simplified [[Graphical user interface|graphical interface]]. The program will take place in locations "to be determined" based on where there is a strong geographic presence of the team members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zerorobotics.mit.edu/what-is-zr/ |publisher=MIT |title=What is ZR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mercurynews.com/2017/07/21/summer-program-aims-to-send-students-coding-projects-to-space/&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally some countries, notably Australia and [[Italy]], choose to hold preliminary competitions to fit better into the school year and/or filter the schools going onto the International Competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisisitaly-panorama.com/education/zero-robotics-and-the-outstanding-performance-of-italian-school-students/#&amp;panel1-1 |title=Zero Robotics and the outstanding performance of italian school students}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Zero Robotics Finals 1.jpg|thumb|The Finals of the Zero Robotics competition aboard the ISS]]

==Objectives of tournaments ==
Participants compete together to win a technically challenging game, motivated by a problem of current interest to [[DARPA]], NASA and MIT. Depending on the challenge, students must program their satellites to complete certain objectives (to avoid obstacles, collect virtual objects, destroy targets, etc.) while preserving the primary resources (fuel, energy charges, etc.) and complete the challenge within certain limits of time and space for writing code. The student's [[software]] must be able to control factors such as the speed of the satellite, the rotation, the direction of travel, and many others, to be able to find the perfect algorithm to achieve the purpose and meet the challenges in the shortest possible time than their opponents.

The difficulty lies in the fact that the programs are [[Autonomous robot|autonomous]] in the sense that submitted code will last for the duration of the competition (and across multiple matches) and you can not control or modify their execution.  Additionally there is a limit on the programmable memory of the SPHERES, limiting the available coding practices.

[[File:SPHERES internal components.jpg|thumb|left|SPHERES internal components]]
== Physics ==
Participants in Zero Robotics are encouraged to learn and/or improve their knowledge related to basic [[physics]], since optimal [[Algorithm|algorithms]] require precise control over forces influencing the speed of the SPHERES. However, students report that "good results [can be obtained] by working exclusively through imposition of the satellite coordinates".

== Programming ==
Participants in the challenge Zero Robotics learn to program in a language-like [[C (programming language)|C]] / [[C++]], or [[MATLAB]], or (in the middle school competition) [[Scratch (programming language)|Scratch]].  Within these languages there are different [[API]]s to enforce the main parameters of the movements of the satellite. A specialised [[Integrated development environment|IDE]] is offered online on the official website of the competition where students are able submit and save their code.
