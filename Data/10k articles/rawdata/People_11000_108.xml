'''Amri Hernández-Pellerano''' is a [[Puerto Rico|Puerto Rican]] [[electronics engineer]] and [[scientist]] who designs, builds and tests the electronics that will regulate the solar array power in order to charge the spacecraft battery and distribute power to the different loads or users inside various [[spacecraft]] at NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]]. She designed the power systems electronics for the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) mission. WMAP is a NASA [[Explorer program|Explorer mission]] spacecraft which measures the temperature of the [[cosmos|cosmic]] background [[radiation]] over the full sky with unprecedented accuracy.

==Early years==
Hernández-Pellerano was born and raised in [[Puerto Rico]] where she received her primary and secondary education. Her parents played an instrumental role in her life by encouraging her to pursue a college education. During her elementary school years, the subjects which she enjoyed most were math and science. She entered the [[University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez]] after she graduated from high school. While in college, she was accepted into the NASA Cooperative Education Program which allowed her to work with NASA scientists at the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] in [[Maryland]] and at the sametime earn school credits. She started working at GSFC full-time after she earned her Electrical Engineering Bachelor (BSEE) degree at the UPR. While working full-time, GSFC provided her the opportunity to complete a master's degree in Electrical Engineering from The [[Johns Hopkins University]].&lt;ref name="Latina"&gt;[http://latinawomen.nasa.gov/hep/lwon/LWONbios/gsfc-AHernandez-Pellerano.html Hernández-Pellerano] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304130824/http://latinawomen.nasa.gov/hep/lwon/LWONbios/gsfc-AHernandez-Pellerano.html |date=2016-03-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career at NASA==
In 1992, Hernández-Pellerano began working for the Power Systems Branch (PSB) at Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC). As a Power System Electronics designer she has been involved in the design and implementation of power system electronics (PSE) for various scientific spacecraft. These include the [[Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission]] (TRMM), the [[Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe]] (WMAP) and the Earth Observing-1 (EO-1) which are currently still in operation.&lt;ref name="Latina"/&gt;

Her responsibilities include the designing, building and testing of the electronics that will regulate the solar array power in order to charge the spacecraft battery and distribute power to the different loads or users inside various spacecraft.

==WMAP mission==
[[image:WMAP2.jpg|thumb|Artist depiction of the WMAP spacecraft]]
In 2003, she received the GSFC Engineering Achievement Award for her design of the Power Systems Electronics for the [[WMAP]] mission.&lt;ref name="Latina"/&gt; WMAP is a NASA Explorer mission spacecraft which measures the temperature of the cosmic background [[radiation]] over the full sky with unprecedented accuracy. This map of the remnant heat from the [[Big Bang]] provides answers to fundamental questions about the origin and fate of our universe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://map.gsfc.nasa.gov  MAP mission]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, she was awarded NASA's Exceptional Service Medal.

==Currently==
She is currently working on the Space Technology-5 (ST5), the [[Solar Dynamics Observatory]] (SDO), the Lunar Reconnaissance Observer (LRO) and the Aquarius/SAC-D ({{lang|es|Satelite de Applicaciones Cientificas D}}) missions. Hernández-Pellerano is also the chair for the Hispanic Advisory Committee for Employees (HACE) at GSFC. This committee works with the Equal Opportunity Office and among other responsibilities, serves as a focal point for the concerns of Hispanic employees on matters affecting their employment at GSFC.

'''Antônio da Silva Mello''' (May 10, 1886 - September 19, 1973), best known as '''A. da Silva Mello''' was a Brazilian [[physician]] and writer.&lt;ref&gt;J. R. (1974). ''A de Silva Mello (1886-1973)''. Cahiers Du Monde Hispanique Et Luso-brésilien 22: 223-223.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Mello was born in [[Juiz de Fora]]. He studied at the Granbery Institute and then joined the Medical School of [[Rio de Janeiro]], where he attended until the third year, when he moved to [[Berlin]], graduating in 1914. He specialized in clinical medicine, publishing scientific papers on the subject. He wrote on [[epidemiology]], [[immunity (medical)|immunity]], [[metabolism]], [[nephrology]], [[nutrition]] and [[psychology]].&lt;ref name= "Explorador"&gt;[http://www.oexplorador.com.br/antonio-silva-mello-medico-escritor-e-academico-formou-se-em-medicina-na-alemanha/ "Antônio Silva Mello, doctor, writer and academic, graduated in medicine in Germany"]. O Explorador.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1918 he returned to Brazil, he was a professor at the Faculty of Medicine of Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.livronautas.com.br/ver-autor/649/a-da-silva-mello "A. da Silva Mello"]. Livronautas.&lt;/ref&gt; He held courses for physicians and students at the Policlínica de Botafogo and [[Santa Casa de Misericórdia]].

In 1944 he founded the ''Brazilian Journal of Medicine'', of which he was scientific director until 1973. Mello was a member of the [[Academia Brasileira de Letras]] and the [[Brazilian Academy of Medicine]]. He identified as an [[Agnosticism|agnostic]].&lt;ref name= "Explorador"/&gt;

Mello was a friend of psychiatrist [[Rudolf Dreikurs]] who was impressed by his research on mental health.&lt;ref&gt;Terner, Janet R; Pew, W. L; Aird, Robert A. (1978). ''The Courage to be Imperfect: The Life and Work of Rudolf Dreikurs''. Hawthorn Books. p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skepticism==

Mello was the author of the [[Skepticism|skeptical]] book ''Mistérios e Realidades Deste e do Outro Mundo'' published in Brazil in 1950. It was translated into English by M. B. Fierz and published as ''Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next'' by [[Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson]] in 1960.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Rodger. (2006). ''Psychics, Sensitives and Somnambules: A Biographical Dictionary with Bibliographies''. McFarland &amp; Company. pp. 234-235. {{ISBN|0-7864-2770-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; He examined case studies of [[faith healing]], hypnosis, [[parapsychology]] and [[spiritualism]]. He discovered much credulity, deception and exaggeration. According to a review it is a "very interesting and provocative work... [Mello] disbelieves in the reality of paranormal phenomena and thinks that all can be explained in terms of the known. In his view psychical researchers are both credulous and gullible and are to be blamed for pandering to human superstition and the widespread hunger for the occult."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1961). ''Mysteries and Realities of This World and the Next. A. da Silva Mello''. Translated from the Portuguese by M. B. Fierz. Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. British Book News, Issues 245-256.

'''Appaiah Swami''' or [[Sadguru]] '''Appayya Swami''' (ಅಪ್ಪಯ ಸ್ವಾಮಿ 1885–1956) (not to be mistaken with Appayya Swamy, a 17th-century Carnatic Musician and scholar of Tamil Nadu) was a [[Hindu]] Indian spiritual master who lived in [[Virajpet]] town, in [[Kodagu]], [[Karnataka]], India.

[[File:Sadguru Appayya Swamigalu.JPG|thumb|Sadguru Appayya Swamigalu]]

== Early life ==
Appayya Swami was born as Palanganda Appaiah, the son of a [[Kodava people|Kodava]] paddy farmer in [[Kodagu]] (Coorg) in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kamath|title=Karnataka State gazetteer, Volume 20|date=1993|publisher=Director of Print, Stationery and Publications at the Government Press,|location=Bangalore|page=659|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nCELAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=thimmayya+kodava&amp;dq=thimmayya+kodava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=apo4VJKXGNDUuQSpmoCQBg&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwBA|accessdate=11 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;Appayya did his schooling in English and [[Kannada]] at Central High School, [[Mercara]]. Later he entered the Government Service under the Raj. However, he was of a religious bend of mind since childhood, and was inspired by the lives of [[Ramakrishna Paramhansa]] and [[Swami Vivekananda]]. He sought a spiritual guru, eventually selecting Guru Ramagiri.

== Career ==
His Guru ordained him and Swamigalu learned and composed several hymns. Through the path of devotion, he attained self-realization. Over time he became a spiritual teacher with several disciples and was hence given the title of [[Sadguru]].

In 1941 he founded a monastery in [[Virajpet]] known as Kaveri Ashram after the river goddess [[Kaveri]]. His work in sustaining [[Hindu]] spirituality and culture in Coorg and its surrounding regions is being carried on by the '''Kaveri Ashram''' (also known as '''Cauvery Ashram''' {{coord|12|12|09.27|N|75|48|11.68|E}}) today. A school is named after him in [[Somwarpet]], Kodagu called Sadguru Appayya Swamy High School.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/19558672/SHREE-SADGURU-APPAIAH-HIGH-SCHOOL-KUDIGE |title=Shree Sadguru Appaiah High School Kudige |publisher=Wikimapia.org |date= |accessdate=2013-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- 
===Mataji===
During the physical presence of Sadguru Appayya Swamigalu in Coorg, there lived a little girl, start attending her elementary education in a school. During Dasserah, Sarasvati puja was celebrated in the school wherein the said little girl of about five years fell into a trance and lost consciousness. Her father was a teacher in the school and took her to their residence. After three days her parents requested Sadguru Appayya Swamigalu's help. On the fourth day Swamigalu went to their house and uttered a divine mantra, bringing the little girl to a normal state. When she reached 21, her parents wanted her to get married, but she again fell into unconsciousness. The girl’s uncle told her father to either take the body for cremation or send her to Cauvery Ashram. She was moved to the ashram, where she regained consciousnes and remained. Devotees called her Mataji. 

She attained the highest spiritual-state of Nirvikalpa Samadhi showing that women could reach the highest spiritual state. Mataji spent about a decade performing [[sadhana]] at the Krishna Ashram (also founded by Swamigalu). (citation needed / give references/ name of the person )

'''Arthur Findlay''' MBE JP (May 16, 1883 &amp;ndash; July 24, 1964) was a writer, accountant, stockbroker and [[Essex]] magistrate, as well as a significant figure in the history of the religion of [[Spiritualism]], being a partial founder of the newspaper ''[[Psychic News]]'' and also a founder of the [[International Institute for Psychical Research]]. In his [[will (law)|will]] he left his home, [[Stansted Hall]], to the [[Spiritualists' National Union]].&lt;ref&gt;Briggs, Constance Victoria. (2010). ''Encyclopedia of the Unseen World''. Weiser Books. pp. 124-125. {{ISBN|978-1578634651}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early life===
Aged 17, he had become interested in the field of [[religious studies|comparative religion]], something of which his staunchly [[Christian]] parents disapproved of - they even burned many of his books on the subject. 

In 1913 he was awarded the title of Member of [[Order of the British Empire|The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire]] for his organisation work for the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross]].

===John Sloan===
In 1918 Findlay attended a séance with the direct voice [[Mediumship|medium]] John Campbell Sloan at a spiritualist church in Glasgow. During the next five years Findlay attended many seances at the medium's home and became convinced spirit voices were speaking through Sloan.&lt;ref&gt;[[Raymond Buckland|Buckland, Raymond]]. (2005). ''The Spirit Book: The Encyclopedia of Clairvoyance, Channeling, and Spirit Communication''. Visible Ink Press. p. 141. {{ISBN|978-1578592135}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the psychical researcher [[J. Malcolm Bird]] investigated Sloan and wrote he had no doubt that all the voices heard could be produced by the medium talking into the trumpet in a normal fashion. Bird also wrote the information given to the sitters could have easily been taken from public records and there was a lack of control in the séances. Bird wrote that "the phenomena themselves were not particularly impressive; with the intermittent freedom of the medium, it seemed simple enough for him to have done most of them himself."&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Malcolm Bird|Bird, J. M]]. (1924). ''My Psychic Adventures''. New York: Scientific American Publishing Company. pp. 54-96&lt;/ref&gt;

Findlay's ''On the Edge of the Etheric'' (1931) defended Sloan's direct voice mediumship and supported the existence of an [[etheric body]]. The book was negatively reviewed in the ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' journal as anti-scientific. According to the review "from reading Mr. Findlay's records, the scientific method might be thought not to exist. He seems to have no appreciation of the implications underlying many of his remarks; no desire to see the phenomena described in accurate and scientific terminology."&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous. (1932). ''On the, Edge of the Etheric: being an Investigation of Psychic Phenomena based on a series of Sittings with Mr John C. Sloan, the Glasgow Trance and Direct Voice Medium''. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 129: 562-563.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spiritualism===
Findlay in 1920 founded the Glasgow Society for Psychical Research.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nevill Drury|Drury, Nevill]]. (2002). ''The Dictionary of the Esoteric: Over 3000 Entries on the Mystical and Occult Traditions''. Watkins Publishing. p. 105. {{ISBN|978-1842930410}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923 he took part in the [[Church of Scotland]]'s enquiry into psychic phenomenon. In the same year, he retired from his profession and purchased Stansted Hall in [[Stansted Mountfitchet|Stansted]], [[England]], a manor house built in 1871. 

In 1932, he became a founding member of ''[[Psychic News]]'', a Spiritualist newspaper, along with [[Hannen Swaffer]] and [[Maurice Barbanell]]. He helped to found the [[International Institute for Psychical Research]], of which he became the chairman. He also became an honorary member of both the American Foundation for Psychical Research, Edinburgh Psychic College and the honorary president of both the Institute of Psychic Writers and Artists and the [[Spiritualists' National Union]].
 
In his will, he left Stansted Hall to the Spiritualists' National Union as a college for the advancement of Psychic Science, which was named the [[Arthur Findlay College]] of Psychic Science after him.

=== Thornton Heath poltergeist ===

In 1938, the psychical researcher [[Nandor Fodor]] investigated the Thornton Heath [[poltergeist]] case that involved Mrs. Forbes. According to [[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]] "Fodor asserted that the psychosis was an episodic mental disturbance of schizophrenic character, and that Mrs. Forbes' unconscious mind was responsible for the activities finally determined to be fraudulent. Fodor eventually identified the cause as sexual trauma that had occurred in Mrs. Forbes's childhood, and had been repressed."&lt;ref name="Guiley 1994"&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Rosemary Guiley]]. (1994). ''The Guinness Encyclopedia of Ghosts and Spirits''. Guinness World Records Limited. p. 125. p. 334. {{ISBN|978-0851127484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because he was skeptical of the case, Fodor was heavily criticized by spiritualists and was dismissed from his post at the International Institute for Psychical Research. Findlay, the founder of institute did not approve of his research and resigned. Fodor was attacked in the Spiritualist newspaper, ''[[Psychic News]]'' which he sued for [[Defamation|libel]].&lt;ref name="Guiley 1994"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2834">'''Ben-Zion Alfes''' ({{he|בן-ציון אלפס}}) (1851-1941) was a rabbi, author and Jewish orator. His most well-known book is ''Maaseh Alfes.'' The last work he saw published, written at age 90, was an autobiography titled "The Life Story of the Maase Alfes."&lt;ref name=Pinto&gt;http://www.HevratPinto.org/tzadikim_eng/145_rabbi_benzion_alfes.html&lt;/ref&gt; Another work, Toledot ve-Zikhronot, also an autobiography, but with a different focus, was published posthumously.&lt;ref name=EnJU.OL&gt;{{cite web |title=ALFES (Alfas), BENZION

|website=Encyclopedia.com | publisher=Encyclopaedia Judaica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Ben-Zion Alfes was born in [[Vilna]] to Rabbi Yirmeyahu Akiva on the first of Kislev 5611 (1851)."&lt;ref name=Pinto/&gt; After studying with his father until the age of 15, he enrolled in  Eishyshok yeshiva, where he became close to the son-in-law of Rabbi Avraham, brother of the Vilna Gaon.&lt;ref name=Pinto/&gt; In 1872, he traveled to Palestine in the hopes of settling there but could find no source of livelihood.&lt;ref name=Pinto/&gt; Upon returning to Vilna, he found work as a proof-reader at HaChevra Metz publishing house. An attempt at writing books for Jewish youngsters was the beginning of his writing career, especially since he received a [[Haskama]]
from the [[Chofetz Chaim]]. He also translated many  religious Hebrew works into Yiddish.&lt;ref name=EnJU.OL/&gt; His name also became well known due to public lectures and a network of schools,  Toras Chesed, established for orphans and children from impoverished backgrounds.

In 1925, he returned to Palestine and settled in [[Petah Tikvah]], where he became spiritual director of the Tiferet Bachurim society.&lt;ref name=Pinto/&gt;

He and his wife Nechama&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ancestry.com/genealogy/records/ben-zion-alfes_92557792&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Source: a great-grandson's family story, http://www.geocities.ws/Athens/Acropolis/4804/ALFES_FM.HTM&lt;/ref&gt; had six children:
* Esther (1869-1956) Rabin
* Shepsl (1872-1956) Alfes
* Mordechai (1877-1942) Alfes&lt;ref&gt;died in the Holocaust&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dr. Akiva (1879-1962) Alfes
* Sonia Gurwitch
* Malka (1895-1965) Velikowsky

He punctuated his [[Yiddish-language]] translations/commentaries on [[Siddur]], as well as [[Yom Tov Torah readings|Holiday]] prayer books (Machzorim) with Hebrew vowels, "giving them the external appearance of Hebrew."&lt;ref name=Pinto/&gt;  This was of major benefit to women whose schooling was in Yiddish language using the Hebrew alphabet. He became known as a pioneer of Orthodox Yiddish literature.

==Storylines==

===Backstory===
Carla was born on 3 January 1975 in [[Manchester]]. She was the result of a one-night stand between her mother Sharon and [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]), a married man who lived close by. Johnny knew that Carla was most likely his daughter, but for the sake of his marriage, he buried the memory of his liaison with Sharon. He did, however, make child support payments to Sharon whenever she had nowhere else to turn, which he managed to keep hidden from his wife Lou. Sharon lived in poverty on a run-down council estate. Carla was born into a world of alcohol and drugs, which Sharon sold from Carla's pram. Sharon had plenty of boyfriends and, a few years after Carla was born, she gave birth to her second misbegotten child, [[Rob Donovan|Rob]] ([[Marc Baylis]]). She went on to marry George, who mistreated Carla and Rob and was hated by them. Carla's best friends growing up were [[Michelle Connor|Michelle]] ([[Kym Marsh]]), [[Paul Connor (Coronation Street)|Paul]] ([[Sean Gallagher (actor)|Sean Gallagher]]) and [[Liam Connor]] ([[Rob James-Collier]]) who lived in the nicer part of the estate. Michelle and her siblings were second cousins once removed of Johnny and third cousins of Johnny's children, [[Aidan Connor|Aidan]] ([[Shayne Ward]]) and [[Kate Connor (Coronation Street)|Kate]] ([[Faye Brookes]]), with whom Carla was also friendly despite them being ten years younger than her. In 1993, Sharon told Lou about her affair with Johnny, leading Lou to run out of the house in the course of arguing with Johnny and being fatally struck by a drunk driver. As a teenager, Carla worked Saturdays in a shoe shop and on her birthday in 1997 she began a relationship with her future husband Paul, who she married on 26 January 1999 at age 24. With Paul earning good money, Carla's lifestyle changed for the better. For a while, she maintained regular visits to the family home but soon stopped as Rob constantly got at her for leaving him to deal with their mother's troubles by himself. To ease her conscience, Carla sent her mother expensive gifts, but because of where she lived Sharon was afraid they would be stolen and kept them under lock and key. Rob was later sent to [[Strangeways prison]] for [[armed robbery]] in 2004.

Carla's family also used to know the Kerrigans as they were part of the Connor family. The Kerrigans included [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) who later appeared on the street. They all grew up together on a [[council estate]].

===2006–2016===
{{Long plot|section|date=November 2017}}&lt;!-- Summarize according to reliable sources, please. --&gt;
Carla arrives and is furious to discover that her husband Paul had spent all the money she needed to start her children's clothing business, though to make more money she manipulated fellow factory workers [[Kelly Crabtree]] ([[Tupele Dorgu]]) and [[Joanne Jackson (Coronation Street)|Joanne Jackson]] ([[Zaraah Abrahams]]) into working weekends, early mornings and late nights in order to raise money for her business. However, Kelly and Joanne eventually refuse to continue working for Carla as they became isolated from their friends and lack in freedom. Carla begins dating catalogue boss [[Tony Gordon]] ([[Gray O'Brien]]). Carla and Tony's relationship makes Liam jealous. During an argument, they kiss, confusing them both. Carla tries to stop Liam marrying [[Maria Connor|Maria Sutherland]] ([[Samia Ghadie]]), so the two women feud. She ends things with Tony by admitting her feelings for Liam; however, Liam marries Maria so she and Tony reconcile; Tony proposes and Carla accepts. In May 2008, Carla supports Liam through the [[stillbirth]] of his and Maria's son, and the two sleep together. Carla's personal assistant, [[Rosie Webster]] ([[Helen Flanagan]]), records the pair kissing on her mobile phone. Carla threatens Rosie to dispose of the evidence. In June 2008, Carla blackmails Liam into selling his share of the factory to Tony by threatening to tell Maria about their [[one-night stand]]. In September, she invests in [[Tom Kerrigan (Coronation Street)|Tom Kerrigan]] ([[Philip McGinley]]) and Liam's new T-shirt business, but they agree to keep this from Tony and Maria. Tony discovers the one-night stand after viewing Rosie's video footage. Carla sleeps with Liam again prior to her wedding to Tony, and is prepared to cancel the wedding. However, she changes her mind upon discovering that Maria is pregnant. Carla is devastated by Liam's death in a [[hit-and-run]] incident orchestrated by Tony. Needing to get away, Carla postpones the wedding and goes to [[Los Angeles]]. She returns married to Tony. Tony later confesses to Carla for being responsible for Liam's death and a horrified Carla flees to Los Angeles.

When Carla returns, she is contacted by the police after Tony confesses. Carla is attacked by thugs which break into her home. Robbie Sloan (James Fleet), Tony's cellmate, is released from prison and Tony fakes a heart attack to get out of prison. Robbie bails him out of the ambulance and they go to Weatherfield, intending to kill Carla. Robbie tricks Carla into entering the factory alone with him and holds her at gunpoint. After forcing her to evacuate the building, he leaves her bound and gagged in her office while he lures Hayley Cropper (Julie Hesmondhalgh) to the factory, who he also holds hostage. Tony appears, removes the silver duct tape from Carla's mouth, and shoots Robbie dead. He intends to burn the factory to the ground to kill Carla and Hayley, but Maria interrupts and he refuses to let her leave. Carla orders Maria to leave; she escapes. Carla manages to convince Tony to free Hayley. Tony later sets the factory on fire with petrol, whereby Carla manages to untie herself and after a struggle, she shoots Tony in the arm. She manages to flee the burning factory, however, Tony is killed when the building explodes.

Carla returns to Weatherfield and is shocked when her business partner, [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), sets up a rival factory underneath the viaduct, and refuses to work with her, but before long, ''Underworld'' is eventually repaired. Carla later invites her boyfriend, [[Trevor Dean]] (Steve Jackson) to become a trainee manager in the factory, much to Nick's annoyance. Trevor finds working in the office difficult, however, and punches Nick as Carla watches on. Nick decides to leave the factory and demands that Carla buys his shares back which cost £150,000, while Trevor leaves her to reunite with [[Janice Battersby]] ([[Vicky Entwistle]]). Carla begins drinking heavily, and is stopped by [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) getting into her car. Peter decides to support her as he is also a recovering alcoholic and understands her. After being arrested for drink-driving and being collected from the police station by Peter, Carla confesses her feelings for him. Although he admits he is attracted to her, he remains faithful to [[Leanne Battersby]] ([[Jane Danson]]), his girlfriend. When Nick decides to set up a wine bar on Viaduct Street, he pressures Carla into giving him the money for his share, and she eventually remortgages her flat to get the money. Michelle later gives Carla a new idea for a product she could create in the factory. When Carla's buyer loves the idea, Carla offers Michelle a job in the office. In July 2011, Carla spends the night with her client [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] ([[Andrew Lancel]]).

Carla begins dating Frank, and ignores Maria when she tells her that he [[Sexual assault|sexually assaulted]] her. Frank and Carla get engaged, however when meeting his parents [[Anne Foster|Anne]] ([[Gwen Taylor]]) and [[Sam Foster (Coronation Street)|Sam Foster]] ([[Paul Clayton (actor)|Paul Clayton]]), she becomes intoxicated, arguing with Frank and Anne. She then gets in her car with Frank and drives off, running over Leanne's mother [[Stella Price]] ([[Michelle Collins]]) and crashing into Peter's bookies. Frank switches places with Carla, who is unconscious, and lies that he was driving. The night before the wedding, Carla tells Frank she cannot marry him because she is in love with Peter, so Frank angrily [[rape]]s Carla. She rings Maria, who phones the police and Frank is arrested. He is released on bail, providing that he does not approach Carla or the factory. He threatens Carla, trying to make her drop the charges but she refuses, so he plans to ruin ''Underworld''. Carla struggles to cope and becomes more dependent on alcohol, attending meetings with Peter; they begin an affair. She [[Attempted suicide|attempts to commit suicide]] by overdosing on pills, but phones Peter, who then phones an ambulance. Carla survives and agrees to begin counselling. Carla is stunned when Stella confesses that she too was raped when she was younger, and reveals that she has never told anyone about her assault. Carla's erratic behaviour at the factory, however, quickly causes many of her clients to withdraw their orders and soon her employees find themselves with no work. As the business starts to haemorrhage money, Carla is forced to sack [[Becky McDonald]] ([[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]]), [[Eileen Grimshaw]] ([[Sue Cleaver]]) and [[Sally Webster]] ([[Sally Dynevor]]). While Becky and Eileen understand, Sally is livid and demands a reason. Carla explains that Sally, unlike many of the other workers, is in a comfortable financial situation due to her ex-husband, [[Kevin Webster]]'s ([[Michael Le Vell]]), large lottery win. Frank outwits Carla by employing Sally as a supervisor at his own factory. The factory is nearly bankrupted and Carla is unable to pay any due wages, causing the entire workforce to go on strike, with some defecting to Frank's factory. As Carla reaches the depths of her despair, Michelle returns and sends Carla away on holiday.

In December 2011, Peter starts drinking again. Carla goes to Peter's flat after hearing from [[Dev Alahan]] ([[Jimmi Harkishin]]) that he has taken a bottle of vodka. Peter tries to kiss Carla several times, but although she loves him, she reluctantly pulls away because of Leanne. Peter goes to leave, however, stays and sleeps with Carla, promising to leave Leanne for him. Carla spends the night and next day with Peter before he goes back to tell Leanne that their marriage is over. However, he does not, which leads to Carla feeling rejected. He is persistent and they eventually meet at Carla's flat, where they decide to reignite their affair until Peter is ready to tell Leanne. They later decide to do this after Frank's trial, since Frank was claiming as part of his defence that Carla and Peter were having an affair and plotting to falsely accuse him of rape to get rid of him. Peter and Carla are almost caught on several occasions, and Frank decides to hire a [[private investigator]] to follow Peter in the hope of catching him with Carla. The weekend before the trial, Peter arranges for them to go to a hotel in [[Chester]], where the investigator takes pictures of them kissing outside. Peter is forced to confess to the affair when Anne, Frank's mother, hands over the photographs to Leanne in the public gallery. He comforts Carla briefly, before finding Leanne. The next day, he tells Carla, before she gives evidence against Frank, that he has left Leanne for her. Afterwards, Peter finds himself attempting to cope with his son [[Simon Barlow]] ([[Alex Bain (actor)|Alex Bain]]), who, devastated over Leanne's departure, blames Carla and begins misbehaving for them. Carla overhears many people gossiping about her, and Stella bars her and Peter from [[Rovers Return Inn|The Rovers Return Inn]].

Frank offers Carla £50,000 to buy her share of ''Underworld''; she initially refuses but eventually accepts when Frank's "lawyer" [[List of Coronation Street characters (2012)#Jenny Summer|Jenny Sumner]] ([[Niky Wardley]]) offers to double his money - Jenny is secretly Frank's girlfriend, and part of Frank's plan to [[Confidence trick|con]] Carla. Carla is furious when Frank reveals his plan; it is already too late as she has signed the forms. Frank soon makes himself an endless list of enemies, and Carla goes to confront him at ''Underworld'', where he admits he raped her and taunts her that he overpowered her easily. Later that night, Frank is found dead in the factory by [[Sean Tully]] ([[Antony Cotton]]) and [[Julie Carp]] ([[Katy Cavanagh]]), with Sally kneeling beside him with her hands covered in blood. Several residents are in the frame for Frank's murder, including Carla, Peter, Michelle, Sally and Kevin. The whiskey bottle used to kill Frank is found by [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]), and he hands it to the police. Carla's fingerprints are on the bottle and she is arrested for murder but is later released without charge. Peter confesses to Frank's murder to protect Carla, but he is eliminated when a colleague of Peter's reveals that he was at his house when Frank died. It is eventually proven that Frank raped Carla when Sally reveals that he confessed it to her. Anne attacks Carla and accuses her of stealing the contract, when it was, in fact, Michelle, and Anne is warned to stay away from Carla. The police continue with their investigation, and it is revealed that Anne murdered Frank after she overheard him taunting Carla about getting away with raping her. Anne threatens Carla with a knife, before breaking down in tears and being arrested. In April 2012, Carla is informed by Frank's solicitor that Frank has left her his 40% share of the factory to her in his will, changing it when they were engaged and never changing it back; making her the sole owner of ''Underworld''.

Carla supports Peter as he begins a custody battle against Leanne for Simon; he loses in June 2012 and Leanne wins custody. As a result, Peter begins drinking again, splitting up with Carla after a drunken row. Meanwhile, Carla's brother Rob arrives after being released from prison and begins helping her run ''Underworld''. Carla later decides to run away with Peter after he takes Simon without Leanne's consent, however she can see that Simon would rather be with Leanne, so Peter and Carla then leave without Simon. Carla and Peter return December 2012, just as Leanne is due to fly to [[Las Vegas]] to marry Nick. Peter is thrilled to see Simon but after Carla and Leanne get into a physical fight outside the factory, Carla admits she is struggling with being back in Weatherfield; they agree to leave again. However, Peter later admits that he cannot leave Simon again, so Carla leaves for Los Angeles alone. Carla later surprises Peter by returning on Christmas Eve, saying she could not be without him, unaware that Peter has declared his love for Leanne. Carla is furious to learn that Rob has been altering the accounts for the factory. She sacks him and he sets up on his own business, stealing Carla's clients and orders. Realising that she cannot beat Rob's tricks to win over her clients, she reluctantly offers him a share of the factory. However, Carla puts him in charge of packing, angering Rob. He gives his new girlfriend, [[Tracy Barlow]] ([[Kate Ford]]), a job in packing and she convinces him to pretend the van has been robbed whilst transporting expensive material, which they secretly sell on to another company. What Rob and Tracy are unaware of, however, is that Carla knows what they have done and asks a friend to claim to be interested in buying the material. An agreement is reached and Rob takes the material to the chosen location, only to be greeted by Carla and Peter. Tracy is sacked and Rob is forced to sell his share to Carla in return for her not going to the police. Peter's bookies begins to struggle financially. Carla is initially unaware of this, until Michelle tells her about Peter offering risky odds that could potentially bankrupt him. Peter accepts a large bet from Rob, including one that Peter cannot pay when Rob wins. This forces Peter to close his shop and allow Rob and Tracy to set up their own business. Carla gives Peter a share in the factory and he works in the office with her and Michelle, however this angers Michelle, so she quits.

Carla accompanies Hayley to hospital for a scan, where she is diagnosed with [[pancreatic cancer]]. Throughout Hayley's illness, she confides in Carla, who becomes protective of her. Carla and [[Anna Windass]] ([[Debbie Rush]]) find Hayley deceased on her bed with her husband, [[Roy Cropper]] ([[David Neilson]]). Carla then supports Roy as he grieves for Hayley, and is shocked to learn that Hayley committed suicide. Roy and Carla subsequently become good friends. Carla and Peter hire [[Tina McIntyre]] ([[Michelle Keegan]]) as a babysitter for Simon. Carla and Peter get married in December 2013, just as Rob discovers that Peter is having an affair with Tina. Tina tries to persuade Peter to leave Weatherfield with her. He agrees, although feels conflicted, wanting to remain with Weatherfield with Carla. During an argument with Rob and Tracy in The Rovers, Carla announces that she is pregnant just as Tina arrives to collect Peter. Tina storms out, swiftly followed by Peter. They have an almighty argument, ending in Tina scratching Peter across his face. Peter leaves, as Rob visits Tina and attacks her, telling her not to tell Carla about her affair with Peter. Unknown to Rob, Peter tells Carla about the affair. Tina tries to escape Rob, leading to the balcony of the building yard. A scuffle ensues and as Rob pushes Tina; she loses her balance and falls from the balcony, plummeting onto the cobbles below. Rob thinks Tina is dead and leaves the flat, before hearing Tina's groans and realises she is still alive. When Tina reveals that she will lie to the police that Rob intentionally tried to kill her, Rob picks up a metal pipe and brutally beats Tina. Meanwhile, Carla is furious about Peter's affair and storms out into a busy pub, shouting that she wants to "kill" Tina. She is restrained by Michelle, but eventually leaves the pub. Carla goes to Tina's flat and finds her seriously injured at the bottom of the balcony, and is seen by Leanne and [[Kal Nazir]] ([[Jimi Mistry]]), and soon finds herself prime suspect. She is arrested due to her fingerprints being on the weapon but later released without charge. At first, it is an assault investigation, but when Tina later dies from her injuries in hospital, it turns into a murder investigation. Carla confides in Roy repeatedly and slaps Peter when he tries to talk to her. Her stress finally catches up with her and she collapses in the street when Rob and Peter are fighting. She is rushed to hospital, where she is told that she has suffered a [[miscarriage]]. Carla struggles to cope with her miscarriage and gets drunk to drown her sorrows. When Rob confesses to Tina's murder to Carla, she fights with him and ultimately chooses to tell the police; Rob is arrested and charged with Tina's murder. From this, Carla begins an intense feud with Tracy.

In January 2015, Carla and her staff are involved in a minibus crash while on their way to collect a fashion award. When the minibus crashes, Carla becomes wedged in between the driver's seat and the passenger seat. Tracy notices Carla is still trapped inside and climbs into the wreckage to retrieve her. Carla has a broken leg from the accident and thanks Tracy for saving her. After hearing that [[Liz McDonald]] ([[Beverley Callard]]) is selling her share of The Rovers, Carla offers to buy her half so that Michelle and Steve would still be able to live and work there. However, nobody is aware that Tracy and Liz's partner, [[Tony Stewart (Coronation Street)|Tony Stewart]] (Terence Maynard), whom Tracy is having an affair with, are attempting to con Liz, Steve and Michelle out of the pub so that they can buy it. On the day of Steve and Michelle's wedding day in May 2015, Liz confides in Carla, revealing that Tony and Tracy's affair, and that they were conning her out of The Rovers. Carla offers to look after Tracy's daughter and Liz's granddaughter, [[Amy Barlow|Amy]] (Elle Mulvaney) for the night, and confronts Tracy in the pub toilets, where Carla gives Tracy some harsh home truths. Later that night, Tracy steals the keys to Carla's flat at Victoria Court, and lights a candle. She places the candle under a lampshade, and after spotting Carla asleep on the sofa, she contemplates killing her with a large ornament. After hearing Amy, Tracy quickly leaves, unaware that the lampshade has caught fire from the lit candle. When the fire is raging through the flat, Carla collapses from smoke inhalation and desperately tries to call Amy. Leanne breaks into the flat, and pulls Carla out of the building. After she gets her breath back, Carla reveals that Amy is still trapped inside, so Leanne and Kal run back in to save her. Kal saves Leanne and Amy, before Carla and the other residents watch in horror as the building explodes, killing Kal. Factory worker [[Maddie Heath]] ([[Amy James-Kelly]]) is also caught up in the explosion and is also killed. As Carla was asleep when she started the fire, Tracy tells the residents that it was Carla who started the fire, leading to Leanne shouting at her in the street and everybody else hating her.

Carla plays a game of poker and wins a large amount of money. This subsequently leads to Carla developing [[Problem gambling|an addiction to gambling]], as it eases her guilt from the fire. Carla decides to go on holiday to Madrid. Carla returns a number of weeks later, and it is revealed that she actually went on holiday to Las Vegas in order to gamble. Michelle is furious and after trying to help her, Carla throws her out. Nick later accompanies Carla to a casino, and is stunned to learn how serious her addiction is. Realising the extent of her financial troubles, Carla decides to move away and later tries selling the factory to Sally and Kal's daughter [[Alya Nazir]] ([[Sair Khan]]). However, before any contracts are signed, her old friend, Aidan, arrives. Carla decides to go into partnership with Aidan, while also starting a relationship with Nick. Carla becomes suspicious of Tracy, and when Tracy tells her not to keep blaming herself, Carla orders her to get in her car. To Tracy's surprise, Carla takes her to where the minibus crash occurred earlier in the year and expresses that she wishes Tracy had left her to die in the wreckage. She then flips a coin to decide her fate as she drunkenly stands on the edge of the quarry; heads she stands or tails she falls. It lands on tails, so as Carla prepares to throw herself from the cliff, Tracy screams that she was the culprit who started the fire. Carla refuses to believe her, but when Tracy tells her that she saw a photograph of Rob when she lit the candle, Carla realises that she is telling the truth. In pure anger, Carla grabs Tracy and drags her to the edge of the quarry,  but Tracy pushes Carla over. Tracy pleads with Carla not to tell anybody, however, Carla is intent on phoning the police and opening an investigation to clear her name, but Tracy says she will deny everything. When Tracy tells Carla that her motive towards the fire was that she was jealous of her and that she still wishes Carla had died in the fire, Carla drives back to the street and the police arrest Tracy. However, Tracy is later released without charge.

Nick proposes to Carla and she is shocked to learn that Aidan used his father, Johnny's money to buy into the factory, and thus Johnny and Aidan's sister Kate move to Weatherfield and begin working there. While in prison, Rob begins sending Johnny visiting orders, and reveals that Johnny could potentially be Carla's father. Johnny steals some of Carla's DNA to perform a paternity test behind her back. This reveals that he is Carla's biological father, and decides to break the news to her. Carla is furious and slaps Johnny, and heads for a casino where she bumps into [[Robert Preston (Coronation Street)|Robert Preston]] ([[Tristan Gemmill]]), and after gambling with him, they have sex. She instantly regrets it, and confides in Michelle, who persuades Carla not to tell Nick. Carla is shocked to find that Robert plans to buy a share in the Bistro. Carla begs him to reconsider, but Robert threatens to reveal their one-night stand if she does not let him buy into the Bistro. Carla finds it increasingly difficult to keep her deceit a secret. Carla tells Nick that she cannot marry him, however after he persuades her, she changes her mind. Upon hearing that Robert is intending on going into business with Nick, Carla goes to the Bistro to confront him. As a powercut has forced the restaurant to close early, Carla and Robert engage in a bitter argument, with their one-night stand being mentioned. Unbeknown to the pair, but Tracy, who has recently reconciled with Robert, has overheard their conversation. Robert then leaves, and Carla drowns her sorrows in alcohol. However, [[Jamie Bowman]] (James Atherton), and his friend burst into the restaurant and violently attack Carla, pinning her down on the floor. Tracy, hearing the commotion, leaves Carla to the mercy of the thugs, feeling envious over Carla's liaison with Robert. After realising that there is no money in the restaurant, Jamie grabs Carla's handbag, causing her to fall over. She rises to her feet abruptly and gives chase, jumping into the van, leaving the door wide open, wrestling with the thugs for her handbag. As the van drives out of the street, Jamie pushes Carla out of the vehicle, knocking her unconscious.

Months later, Tracy begins blackmailing Carla, threatening to tell Nick about her and Robert if she does not persuade Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert and leave Weatherfield. Robert and Leanne both put in matching offers for the Bistro, so Tracy demands £10,000 from Carla. Carla convinces Nick to sell the Bistro to Robert; he does, but Tracy continues taunting Carla. Closer to the wedding, Robert finds out what Tracy has been doing to Carla but they stay together. Nick and Carla break up when he feels guilty after throwing a mug at Carla, causing her to cut her face. They get back together when she supports him. On the wedding day, Tracy tries to ruin proceedings by sending the flowers to the wrong address. Carla feels guilty, so she tells Nick about the one-night stand with Robert; he manages to forgive her. Tracy then announces that she has been blackmailing Carla, which Nick finds more difficult to accept. They eventually marry but Nick instantly regrets it, leaving the venue and Carla in tears. Carla asks Roy to get his car so that she can flee Weatherfield. However, she instead gets in her own car. In front of her, Tracy taunts her and Carla speeds up her car to run Tracy over. Tracy moves but a truck driven by [[Tyrone Dobbs]] ([[Alan Halsall]]) and his girlfriend [[Fiz Brown|Fiz Stape]] ([[Jennie McAlpine]]) comes into her path and she swerves, knocking over Roy's partner, [[Cathy Matthews]] ([[Melanie Hill]]) before crashing into the postbox. Carla escapes unharmed, but Cathy lies on the ground motionless. Tyrone crashes into the Platt household, but he and Fiz also escape unharmed, with the help from Nick's half-brother [[David Platt (Coronation Street)|David Platt]] ([[Jack P. Shepherd]]). Roy goes with Cathy to hospital and as he is Carla, who is being held back by police, tries to apologise for what she has done. The next day, Carla decides to leave for [[Devon]] even though the car crashes are pending investigation. Before leaving, she visits the hospital to see Cathy. Cathy forgives her but Roy finds it more difficult to. She tells Roy she is leaving, but Cathy insists that he reconciles with Carla, however, he declares, "Carla is who she is, and will never change". Carla then says an emotional farewell to Johnny, Michelle, Aidan and Kate. Tracy walks out of her florists and Carla declares, "We're done". She then gets in Johnny's car to depart. However, a bus comes and Roy dashes over. Johnny stops the car, with Roy and Carla sharing a final farewell. He forgives her for running over Cathy but tells her she should try to love herself. Carla then kisses Roy on the cheek before getting back in the car and leaving Weatherfield for a new life in Devon.

===2017–===
Over a year later, Carla meets Aidan in a pub after he calls for her help in saving Underworld. However, she refuses and leaves, stating that she has a new life now. She returns on Christmas Day, with a great response from her family and Michelle. Carla refuses to drink during the day which is picked up upon numerous times. While visiting she says that she will become a partner in Underworld with Aidan. She later bumps into Tracy who calls her a goblin to which Carla replies, "just think of me as a Ghost of Christmas Past".  It is declared that she must be up to something when she is seen pouring a drink down the sink in the bathroom as everyone in the pub is singing. Carla invites friend Roy to join her and the family for New Year's Eve in the Rover's Return.  Roy wants Carla to tell her family about her [[kidney failure]]—she has only shared with him her need for a kidney transplant.  Roy has agreed to keep quiet about her condition but says she needs support and must tell them. Carla struggles with her illness and as everyone welcomes in the New Year, she breaks down; Roy witnesses this and asks her to move in with him. She agrees and goes back inside while Roy searches online "how to donate a kidney", unbeknownst to Carla. Carla also grows close to [[Daniel Osbourne (Coronation Street)|Daniel Osbourne]] ([[Rob Mallard]]), Peter and Tracy’s half-brother, upon her return. She clashes with Peter's new partner, [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]), who sees her as a threat. Carla, however, refuses to tell her family about her illness, despite numerous advice from Roy. She later collapses in the street and is found by [[Brian Packham]] ([[Peter Gunn]]) and is rushed to hospital. At the hospital, Roy tells her that he was tested for a kidney match but was not successful, which touched Carla. She decides to listen to him and upon hearing that her situation is getting more critical, she tells Kate and Aidan who both tell her that they will get tested.

On the day that Aidan and Kate get tested, Carla meets Daniel and they go round to his flat. After they establish a certain spark between them both, they have sex. Afterwards, they leave the flat and kiss on the doorstep which Daniel’s ex [[Sinead Tinker]] ([[Katie McGlynn]]) witnesses whilst going round to get back with Daniel as he had earlier given her a present. They later meet up for a drink later on in the Rovers Return, whom Peter is now landlord of with Total. Peter tells Carla that he saw them together earlier and it is obvious that Peter is jealous. Whilst there, she meets Aidan who tells her that he has been tested. Peter also talks with Daniel and pesters about what was going on that afternoon. However, Sinead’s aunty [[Beth Tinker]] ([[Lisa George]]) storms into the pub and argues with Carla about their kiss on the doorstep which everybody hears including Peter who sarcastically comments - “you make a great couple”. The next day, Peter taunts Carla about Daniel suggesting that she is only doing it to get back at him. Carla disagrees by saying, “don’t flatter yourself” and says sarcastically that Toyah is lucky, clearly because he is jealous of Carla. She later meets Daniel again and they go on a date where she orders a bottle of wine - her first alcoholic drink in a while. Aidan and Kate disapprove but she goes ahead and drinks anyway before collapsing which is met by an audience of Tracy who also teases her about Daniel. Carla and Daniel later meet again in the Rovers as both Aidan and Kate find out they are donor matches. After being refused a drink by Peter and Toyah after stumbling to the bar, Carla collapses again as Roy reveals that she has kidney failure to all her family, Peter, Daniel and Toyah. Peter worries about her as she is taken to hospital with disapproval from Toyah. Tracey later finds out and is taken aback as she too has had kidney failure. At the hospital, Aidan agrees to donate his kidney as Carla’s situation becomes even more critical with the doctors saying that she needs a new kidney quick. Aidan is praised by the rest of the family and Carla who thanks him. The next day, Peter visits her in hospital and brings her a book where Daniel already is. Once again, Peter shows jealousy but he and Carla appear to get on with Peter saying that he still cares.

After realising that she might die, Carla tells Sinead that Daniel still likes her and that she doesn’t want her last moments to be stealing somebody else’s man. Aidan later has his operation and Carla has a kidney transplant - which are both successful. Afterwards, Carla tells Roy that she is renting out her house in Devon and moving back to Weatherfield for good, much to his delight. Carla later sleeps with Michelle’s biological son [[Alex Neeson]] (James Burrows) who was swapped at birth and won’t speak to his mother, after Carla tries to make amends between them. She hides this from Michelle. Carla later gives Aidan 100% of Underworld on his birthday, to which he responds nervously, which leads to Johnny suspecting that he is hiding something. Carla later discovers that Robert, who is now engaged to Michelle, is using [[steroids]]. She agrees to not tell Michelle but confides in Ali about it as he is a [[general practitioner|GP]]. After asking how Ali is dealing with the situation, Ali tries to kiss Carla and although she refuses at first, they share a more passionate kiss as Michelle walks out on them both. Michelle is extremely angry at Carla and they fall out. Carla then tells Ali that her friendship with Michelle will come first and won’t let him stay the night at Roy’s.

Carla is left distraught when Aidan commits [[suicide]] but manages to stay strong and support her family. The day after his death, she reopens the factory which shocks the employees as it is so soon after his death. She continues to run it until Michelle finds Aidan’s will, which reveals he has left it to Alya Nazir, whom Carla doesn’t get on with and would hate for her to own the factory. Michelle and Carla seek legal advice as the will was written before Carla gave 100% of the factory to Aidan and keep it a secret from Alya. In the coming weeks, tension arises between Alya and Carla. She is told that she will have to say that Aidan was mentally unstable when he wrote his will and she later lashes out at Alya causing her to quit her job at Underworld before Carla breaks down and locks herself in her office. She tells Michelle that she feels responsible for Aidan’s suicide as she put pressure on him when giving him the factory. Unknown to Carla, Alya is later given Aidan’s will which shows that she is the sole owner of Underworld. Alya and her lawyer [[Imran Habeeb]] (Charlie de Melo) tell the Connor’s that she knows and Johnny finds out about Aidan’s will, telling Carla that he will disown her if she contests it. On the day of Aidan’s funeral, Carla contemplates drinking. Before the service, Alya appears and Carla threatens her. Carla is later furious when Alya changes Underworld’s locks on the same day and storms over to Alya. After calming down, Carla tells her that she can have the 18% as it is what she would’ve had anyway. Despite this, Alya refuses and Carla tells her that she’ll see her in court.

Carla later asks Beth Tinker to get inside information about Underworld in exchange for a rent-free flat. She also gets Peter involved and they go on several dates. He helps the Connor family as they fight [[Eva Price]] ([[Catherine Tyldesley]]) for custody of [[Susie Barlow]], as he previously believed this was his child. On the day before the mediation, he brings around a birth certificate to prove Eva lied about her parents. Carla is, however, sceptical about showing this as it would get Eva into a lot of trouble. Johnny later kidnaps Susie and Carla supports him. She shouts at Eva in the street when Johnny is arrested. Johnny is, however, later released, and the Connor’s forgive Eva when she leaves. A week later, Peter tells Carla that he thinks there’s still a flame between them but she shouts at him and tells him that he’s stupid.  Alya later tells Carla that she is selling the factory in order to fund her family’s restaurant. Initially, it is for 18% less than the price but Alya later puts it up. Alya also gives Carla a video of Aidan doing an interview about being a kidney donor. Carla struggles with finding money for the factory but Peter rescues her by becoming her partner. Carla later breaks down over Aidan’s death saying that she blames herself but Johnny reassures her and later on Carla and Peter meet and end up kissing. The next day, they talk about the kiss and both say it didn’t mean anything, although the factory girls and her family are sceptical about Peter’s motive for helping Carla. Peter later tells Carla that he doesn’t want to be a sleeping partner and that he is to work full time at the factory, shocking her. A few weeks later, Carla and Peter interview new staff for the factory and Carla brings in someone who looks like Tina, to catch Peter out. However, he realises and she is shocked that he doesn’t want to employ her. This makes Carla realise that she might actually have feelings for him as he appears to have changed. The next day, after trying protect Simon from a gang, she witnesses Peter shot and fears that he has died. Luckily, it was only a paint gun but she realises she has feelings for him and confesses to Michelle and is met with a cold response. A few months later, Nick returns and Carla’s feelings for Peter grow stronger. However, she finds out that he is planning to sell his share of the factory although manages to stall him. Unknown to her, Peter finds an application to buy his share from a while back, addressed to Carla and sells his share to Nick, shocking Carla when she is about to tell him about her feelings. At first they struggle to work together but manage as Nick tells a lie to Carla about what he has been up to. Carla, however, knows it’s a lie and after doing some digging finds out that he has a wife, who spots her rummaging through his car. She later confronts her and they talk about Nick. Carla later meets with Nick and blackmails him, telling him that he either sells his share over to her or she tells his wife, [[Elsa Tilsley|Elsa]] and Leanne, who is now seeing, about the marriage and his relationship.

==Casting==
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:CarlaConnor2007.jpg|thumb|155px|right|Carla Connor as she appeared in 2007.]]  --&gt;On 20 September 2006, it was reported that the former ''[[Dream Team (TV series)|Dream Team]]'' actress, Alison King, had been cast as Carla Connor. A ''Coronation Street'' spokeswoman said of the new addition, "she will make quite an impact. The phrase ‘dosh doesn’t make you posh’ was made for Carla. She's a WAG on the cobbles, beautiful but tough and ambitious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/a37208/dream-team-actress-joins-corrie-cast.html |title=Soaps – News – 'Dream Team' actress joins Corrie cast |publisher=Digital Spy |date=20 September 2006 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; King had briefly appeared on the [[Manchester]] soap in 2004, as a housewife named Mrs. Fanshaw, who slept with [[Jason Grimshaw]] ([[Ryan Thomas]]).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.whatsontv.co.uk/soaps/coronation_street/whos_who/carla_connor&lt;/ref&gt;  She later joked "I was Mrs Fanshaw - or Fanny.

She said that she initially found the role difficult, as she "was uncomfortable playing a constant bitch at first. I'm getting into it now but I'm not as nasty or as cocky as Carla. She's horrible to anyone she perceives to be a rival. I couldn't be like that."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/coronation-street-star-alison-king-pregnant-with-her-first-child-7303376.html | work = Standard | title = Coronation Street star Alison King pregnant with her first child | accessdate = 21 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2010, she admitted her character "annoys the hell" out of her, saying "I would never be her mate in a million years! Carla's a nightmare and annoys the hell out of me. She's the type of person who creates drama wherever she goes, and I'm not like that at all.

In 2010, she talked of how long she would stay at ''Coronation Street'', and that she had no worries for her career afterwards, saying "I'll have done four years in Coronation Street in October but because I had more or less a year out it still feels very fresh. I'm certainly in no rush to get out of it. I'm really lucky to be in this job. But I had a great career before I came into the show - 11 years working non-stop. Hopefully I wouldn't be too scared to do a few more silly action films if I could get them under my belt.

===Underworld siege===
{{See also|Siege Week}}
In March 2010, it was reported that Carla's husband [[Tony Gordon]] portrayed by [[Gray O'Brien]] would escape from [[prison]] resulting in Carla being put in grave danger. [[Robbie Sloan]], portrayed by ''[[Vicar of Dibley]]'' star [[James Fleet]] who is Tony's cellmate and has been bribed to aid the escape. According to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper: "Robbie is freed from jail – having been due for release – and meets Carla (Alison King) under the pretence that he is a trader who wants to buy lingerie cheaply. Having arranged a further meeting with Carla on the planned jailbreak day, he returns to visit jail and creates a diversion by sparking a fight with another inmate. As wardens attempt to break up the altercation, Tony feigns a heart attack and is transported to hospital for treatment. However, Robbie is waiting for the ambulance and threatens the guards at gunpoint before securing Tony's escape."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a210988/corries-tony-in-prison-break-revenge.html#~p6fj8oQKXLvECr&lt;/ref&gt; 

In April 2010, it was revealed that Tony was to hold Carla and [[Hayley Cropper]] ([[Julie Hesmondhalgh]]) captive at Underworld after escaping from prison. Lured into the factory alone by Robbie's businessman façade, Carla was bound and gagged in a desolate Underworld with Hayley Cropper, who had also been lured to the factory.&lt;ref name="Interview Siege Week"&gt;{{cite web|title=Alison King (Carla Connor, Corrie) DS favourite Alison King reveals all about Coronation Street's Siege Week|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/interviews/a221562/alison-king-carla-connor-corrie/|work=Digital Spy|accessdate=1 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tony arrives at the factory, and eventually lets Hayley go free before setting the building on fire. In subsequent scenes, viewers saw Carla untie herself, grab Tony's gun and fire a shot which wounds him. While Carla manages to escape the burning factory, Tony dies in the blaze. Police later examine his body and assume that the bullet killed him.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a215864/corrie-siege-to-spark-murder-charge.html&lt;/ref&gt; It was later reported that Carla was to be wrongly charged with murder in the storyline following this Carla is later released, however this never happened.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

===Alcoholism and relationship with Peter Barlow===
In July 2010, ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' [[newspaper]] reported that an upcoming storyline would see Carla face a drinking problem after King was pictured filming a visit to alcoholics anonymous. An insider told the paper: "She sees [[Peter Barlow (Coronation Street)|Peter Barlow]] ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) at the meeting and backs out, pretending she is meant to be in a Spanish class next door."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a251240/corrie-carla-to-battle-drink-problem.html#~p6fhNh6foAwzFs&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2011, it was reported that Carla will drunkenly drive her car into the bookies, injuring Stella in the process. This was the result of further rejections from Peter. A source told ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'': "Carla's drinking is out of control again, it's a cry for help – and for love". The show's producer, Phil Collinson recently teased a storyline seeing Carla's feelings or Peter to arise once again. Collinson said: "I have to say, it's one of the biggest stories that we've told on Corrie for many years. She's going to have a pretty rough time across the autumn."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a328469/coronation-street-carla-connor-to-crash-into-bookies.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2010, it was reported that Carla would fall for Peter. It was reported that pair apparently grow closer as Peter helps Carla overcome her boozing and comes to her aid when she is arrested for drink driving. A source said: "Carla is feeling vulnerable and Peter is there," a source told the paper. "They soon become more than friends. He's stunned when she tells him she hasn't felt like this about anyone since [[Liam Connor|Liam]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a279085/corries-carla-falls-for-peter-barlow.html#~p6fmAd1evkp0KS&lt;/ref&gt; Carla's best friend Leanne ([[Jane Danson]]) who is in a relationship with Peter would tell Carla that she is in love with her ex-husband [[Nick Tilsley]] ([[Ben Price]]), "This storyline will really put the cat among the pigeons," the source added.

Alison King later told ''Inside Soap'' that she wants Carla's friendship with Peter to develop even further as he helps her to battle an alcohol addiction. King said: "I think she should definitely gets her claws into Peter. They've got a nice friendship and some good banter going on. They're equals, and I think it's the first time Carla's felt that way with someone since Liam died. They could be a great coupling – but it would turn into a nightmare if they both fell off the wagon."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a288908/alison-king-carla-should-be-with-peter.html#ixzz3ThWJ3GfC&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with Frank Foster, rape and Frank's murder===
[[File:Lancel1.jpg|170px|thumb|right|Carla was involved in a relationship storyline with [[Frank Foster (Coronation Street)|Frank Foster]] played by [[Andrew Lancel]] (''pictured'').]]In June 2011, it was announced that Carla will reportedly be left "fighting for her life" after being attacked by her boyfriend.&lt;ref name="Rape Storyline"&gt;{{cite web|last=Daniels|first=Colin|title=Corrie's Carla Connor 'to suffer brutal attack'|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a323203/corries-carla-connor-to-suffer-brutal-attack.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hachette Filipacchi UK]]|accessdate=5 March 2012|date=5 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The factory owner, played by Alison King, would be subjected to a physical and sexual assault by Frank Foster after he suspects she is cheating on him with Peter Barlow. Carla will consider leaving Frank prior to the attack, but feels she owes him after he invested in her business and takes the blame for a car accident she is responsible for.&lt;ref name="Rape Storyline" /&gt; The plot was a prominent storyline over the summer and aired after the 9pm watershed during a week of special episodes. Tracy Barlow will offer to give Frank a positive character reference in court, while Peter's marriage to Leanne suffers.&lt;ref name="Rape Storyline" /&gt;
On 3 February 2012, ''Coronation Street'' confirmed Frank would be killed off as part of a [[whodunit]] storyline.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/frankgoestotheunderworld/|title=Breaking news: Frank goes to the Underworld|date=3 February 2012|publisher=[[itv.com]]|accessdate=3 February 2012|archive-url=https://archive.is/20130126144346/http://www.itv.com/coronationstreet/news/frankgoestotheunderworld/#|archive-date=26 January 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The news came shortly after the episode showing Frank being found not guilty of raping Carla was broadcast.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; A writer for the official ''Coronation Street'' website said "Now events will take an even more dramatic turn as tensions rise and vengeance will be on the minds of several characters, climaxing in Frank's death! And with so many residents having a motive for killing the twisted factory boss – the list of suspects reads like a 'Who's Who' of Weatherfield."&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; Over the following weeks, Frank manages to alienate himself as he tries to get revenge on Carla for dragging him through court.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; Lancel said Frank's true colours would be exposed and he does not think his life is in danger for a moment.&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; His body would be found in the factory, following "days of arguments and confrontations with associates, lovers and enemies alike."&lt;ref name="GoesTo"/&gt; A reporter for the ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'' later announced that five regular characters would become suspects during the investigation into Frank's murder.&lt;ref name="Five"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.metro.co.uk/tv/891632-five-coronation-street-favourites-suspected-of-frank-fosters-murder|title=Five Coronation Street favourites suspected of Frank Foster's murder|date=28 February 2012|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|publisher=[[Associated Newspapers]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Frank would be found dead on the floor of the Underworld factory by Sally Webster.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; The ''Metro'' reporter said Sally comes under suspicion when she is found standing over Frank's body with bloodied hands.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; Carla, Peter and Michelle are questioned by the police, while Sally's ex-husband, Kevin, will also fall under suspicion.&lt;ref name="Five"/&gt; Lancel praised his character's final storyline, calling it "classic Corrie".&lt;ref name="ClassicCorrie"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a368983/coronation-street-frank-killer-could-be-anybody-says-andrew-lancel.html|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='Coronation Street' Frank killer could be anybody, says Andrew Lancel|date=2 March 2012|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]|accessdate=2 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later revealed that Frank's mother, Anne, was the killer during a showdown between her, Carla, Sally and Kevin.

===Rob Donovan and temporary departure===
In March 2012, it was announced that Carla's brother [[Rob Donovan]] would be arriving later in the year. Carla had previously mentioned a brother. Speaking of the announcement a ''Coronation Street'' spokesperson said: "We are seeing lots of different actors over the next week or so. We have got some exciting storylines lined up for Carla's brother. He is a character the fans have been keen to meet for some time".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a373474/coronation-street-casting-carla-connors-long-lost-brother.html&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2012, it was announced that actor [[Marc Baylis]] had been cast to play Rob. Speaking of his casting Baylis said: "I feel incredibly honoured to be joining the very talented cast of Coronation Street. Rob is an exciting character to play and I am hoping he is going to ruffle a few Weatherfield feathers". Producer [[Phil Collinson]] said: "I'm very pleased to welcome Marc to the cast – the latest in a long line of handsome Corrie charmers. Carla's brother Rob is sure to set hearts fluttering in Weatherfield from the minute he arrives. The audience can expect thrills and a few broken hearts when this handsome bad boy hits town." Rob departed in November 2014 and returned later in December 2015 whilst he was in prison for murdering Tina.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a379771/coronation-street-unveils-carlas-brother-rob.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2012, it was reported that Carla would depart with her boyfriend Peter Barlow ([[Chris Gascoyne]]) in 2012, for four months.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a383699/coronation-street-stars-chris-gascoyne-alison-king-to-take-break.html&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking of her departure King said: "It's three years since I had a baby and I've been working for all of that time so I haven't been able to spend too much time with my family. I plan to have a nice holiday and spend time at home getting jobs done on the house, all very normal stuff. King insisted that she still enjoys playing Carla and has no plans to depart for good. King's exit scenes aired on 16 July 2012, she returned to filming on 1 October 2012 and was back on screen in December, and shows boss announced that Carla and Peter would return at Christmas with big news.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s3/coronation-street/news/a391520/alison-king-explains-four-month-coronation-street-break.html&lt;/ref&gt;

===Extension of the Connor family and father's identity===
[[File:Shayne ward.jpg|150px|thumb|right| ward.jpg|[[Shayne Ward]] (''pictured'') joined the cast as [[Aidan Connor]], who would later turn out to be Carla's half-brother.]]
In 2015, ''Coronation Street'' introduced three new members of the Connor family, consisting of [[Aidan Connor]] ([[Shayne Ward]]), [[Kate Connor (Coronation Street)|Kate Connor]] ([[Faye Brookes]]) and [[Johnny Connor (Coronation Street)|Johnny Connor]] ([[Richard Hawley (actor)|Richard Hawley]]). Producer Stuart Blackburn told ''[[Digital Spy]]'' that there would be a real shocker for Carla after she receives news from one of the new Connors. Blackburn commented: "The Connors are looking great. I think in Aidan, Johnny and Kate, we've really hit gold. One of those characters will deliver a bit of news to Carla that will change her sense of self and perception forever. It's going to be a real shocker."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a663005/coronation-street-producer-therell-be-a-real-shocker-for-carla/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Departure (2016)===
On 1 May 2015, it was reported that King would be "taking a break" in 2016. A ''Coronation Street'' spokeswoman said in a statement released to ''[[Digital Spy]]'': "Alison King has indicated to producers that she would like to take a sabbatical from the show for creative reasons at some point in 2016. She wishes to try her hand at other projects before returning to the part of Carla Connor, a role she has enjoyed playing for nine years. Before Ali takes her break, Carla has much more drama to come. At the end of this month, she will be central to the explosive storyline which sees Victoria Court go up in flames, and the aftermath of that plotline will have huge consequences for the factory boss. Ali's desire to take a break from the show gives the writers the opportunity to come up with an enthralling exit for the character."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a645337/alison-king-is-taking-a-break-from-coronation-street-next-year/&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2015, King said in an interview: "I have just signed till May 2016, there is a lot to do with Carla yet. I haven't had a chance to think about beyond that.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.com/soaps/coronation-street/news/a666176/coronation-streets-alison-king-discusses-show-break-i-have-signed-until-may-2016/&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 January 2016, it was confirmed that King's departure was in fact permanent. King told ''[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]'': "It's not actually a break – I'm actually leaving. Because they're leaving the door open, I think people originally called it a break and people are asking 'When are you coming back?' and I'm like 'I'm not'".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailystar.co.uk/showbiz-tv/hot-tv/486458/Alison-King-aka-Carla-Connor-QUITS-Corrie-for-good&lt;/ref&gt;

A storyline was created to build up to her departure. A special week aired from 22 May to 26 May alongside the ''[[Britain's Got Talent]]'' semi-final just like in previous years. A trailer also accompanied the shows and after each episode a preview of the next episode was shown. The episodes had to be broadcast at 9 pm because of the content within them. Two storylines were put into this week, the wedding and the discovery of [[Callum Logan]]'s (Sean Ward) body. This involved the Platt family heavily and Carla caused the crash into the house where the body was hidden, finishing the storyline from his murder which had started in September 2015. King filmed her final scenes in April 2016 with them being broadcast on 26 May 2016.

===Reintroduction (2017)===

==Reception==

===Critical response===
Columnist [[Grace Dent]] has described Carla as "...an alluring vision, raven haired, classy, sultry and replete with guile".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/jan/26/television.culture |title=Grace Dent's world of lather &amp;#124; Media |publisher=The Guardian |date= 26 January 2008|accessdate=22 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The episode aired on 3 December 2008, in which Carla married Tony Gordon attracted an impressive peak of 10.5 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2008/dec/04/tvratings-coronationstreet |title=TV ratings – December 3: More than 10 million viewers watch Coronation Street wedding &amp;#124; Media &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= 4 December 2008|accessdate=22 January 2010 | location=London | first=Leigh | last=Holmwood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, the character was heralded as the new [[Elsie Tanner]]: "strong, dark, mouthy, pushy, full of herself and nobody's fool, ready to put the world to rights with another lashing of lipstick. Has ''Coronation Street'' finally found the new Elsie Tanner in Carla Gordon I'm starting to think that perhaps they might have".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://coronationstreetupdates.blogspot.com/2009/01/is-carla-gordon-new-elsie-tanner.html |title=Coronation Street Blog: Is Carla Gordon the new Elsie Tanner? |publisher=Coronationstreetupdates.blogspot.com |date=29 January 2009 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The return of the character on 19 October 2009, after an eight-month absence, drew large ratings for the show's episodes which were watched by 9.88m (42.2%) and 10.24m (40.5%) respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/news/a182793/102m-tune-in-for-carlas-corrie-return.html |title=Soaps – News – 10.2m tune in for Carla's Corrie return |publisher=Digital Spy |date=20 October 2009 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Radio Times'' soaps columnist David Brown gave mixed comments in his response to Carla's rape storyline. He made the point that while it was being treated with more sensitivity than the rape of [[Toyah Battersby]] ([[Georgia Taylor]]) was, back in 2001, the impression was that the writing team were placing too much pain and anguish upon Carla's character: "By having Carla undergo a vicious violation like rape, it begins to feel that she's being systematically targeted by the storyliners. There's no denying that the scenes in this evening's double bill are powerfully acted by Alison King, but there seems to be an underlying mission to crack open Carla's carapace and expose her vulnerability. In the wider world, rapists often choose their targets regardless of the victim's circumstance, so there's no saying that Carla wouldn’t suffer an assault of this sort. But, in a fictional setting, it does begin to look cruel when so much anguish is piled onto one person's shoulders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2011-09-19/coronation-street-is-carla's-rape-an-ordeal-too-far |title=Is Carla's rape an ordeal too far? |publisher=Radio Times Blog |date=19 September 2011 |accessdate=24 September 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110924031529/http://www.radiotimes.com/blog/2011-09-19/coronation-street-is-carla%27s-rape-an-ordeal-too-far |archivedate=24 September 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sarah Ellis of ''[[Inside Soap]]'' said that Carla was great to watch when she is with Peter. She added that they are "like a car crash waiting to happen".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ellis|first=Sarah|title=Soapbox|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=18–24 February 2012|issue=7|pages=97|publisher=[[Hearst Magazines UK]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her colleague, Laura-Jayne Tyler, called Carla's departure "thoroughly disappointing", commenting, "For a character who has given ''Corrie'' {{sic}} 10 years of top drama, we don't think Carla deserved to be 'slut shamed' out of Weatherfield."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tyler|first1=Laura-Jayne|title=Hits &amp; Misses!|journal=[[Inside Soap]]|date=4–10 June 2016|volume=2016|issue=22|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter writing for the ''Inside Soap Yearbook 2017'' described Carla  as a "soap favourite" and hoped she would "hurry home soon".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=2016...

Gone but not forgotten: ''Corrie''{{'s}} Carla [...] We hope these soap favourites who departed this year will hurry home soon.|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another reporter later named Carla and Tracy's feud as one of the "best bits of February", describing the pair as "sworn enemies".&lt;ref name="February"/&gt; They described Tracy confronting Carla as "the big moment" in the episodes.&lt;ref name="February"&gt;{{cite journal|year=2016|title=The best bits of February: EastEnders - The claws are out!|journal=[[Inside Soap]] Yearbook 2017|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Fans===
Since Carla first appeared, she has become a firm favourite by ''Coronation Street'' fans. Although King is not on [[social media]] herself, many fan base accounts have been set up on [[Twitter]] and [[Instagram]]. The character is also amongst many discussions on ''Twitter'' and often finds herself ‘trending’ after an episode. Examples of the fans involvement are such things as when she left in 2016, many people were calling for her return straight after the episode. In 2018 also, when Carla began her feud with Alya Nazir, ''Coronation Street'' put out [[hashtags]] with either #TeamAlya or #TeamCarla. Over 1,000 people responded with #TeamCarla and this yet again became a discussion on social media, with many fans criticising the character of Alya just because of her attitude towards Carla. Peter and Carla's relationship also has its own nickname by fans, which is Carter. The #Carter hashtag has been used numerous times since her 2017 return.

===Accolades===
In an online poll conducted by ''MSN Entertainment'', Carla Connor was voted as 'Soapland's Sexiest Female of 2008', with more than 31% of votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Showbiz/Christmas-soap-moments/article-567678-detail/article.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=3 January 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525180403/http://www.thisisbristol.co.uk/Showbiz/Christmas-soap-moments/article-567678-detail/article.html |archivedate=25 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 2008 ''Inside Soap Awards'', the character was voted "Best Bitch".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Allen |first=Liam |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/7642263.stm |title=Entertainment &amp;#124; EastEnders dominates soap awards |publisher=BBC News |date=29 September 2008 |accessdate=22 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was awarded "Best Actress" at [[British Soap Awards#2012 winners|The British Soap Awards 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor|first=Jim|title=Eastenders wins top prize at British Soap Awards|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/17886011|work=[[Newsbeat]]|publisher=([[BBC]])|accessdate=29 April 2012|date=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On Digital Spy's 2012 end of year reader poll, King was nominated for "Best Female Soap Actor" and came fifth with 9.7% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kilkelly|first=Daniel|title='EastEnders', Corrie, 'Hollyoaks' all win in Digital Spy's 2012 poll|url=http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/soaps/s2/eastenders/news/a446819/eastenders-corrie-hollyoaks-all-win-in-digital-spys-2012-poll.html|work=[[Digital Spy]]|publisher=([[Hearst Magazines UK]])|accessdate=22 December 2012|date=22 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; King was nominated for the "Best Actress" award at [[The British Soap Awards#2014 winners|The British Soap Awards 2014]], and was nominated for the award again in the [[British Soap Awards#2015 winners|2015 ceremony]].

The '''Chamorro''' family has its origin in [[Spain]].  A branch of the family became prominent in [[Nicaragua]] in the 18th century and its influence continues to the present.  Historically, the Chamorros have been closely associated with the Conservatives, but the [[Sandinista]] Revolution has divided their loyalties, with some members supporting the Sandinistas.  Outstanding members of this family are:

Christy Uduak Essien-Igbokwe MFR (11 November 1960 – 30 June 2011) was a Nigerian musician and actress. In her life time, she was sometimes called ''Nigeria's Lady of Songs'' and was known for her song "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDrApu9APBk Seun Rere]". She was the first female president of the [[Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria]] (PMAN). She was also the chairwoman and managing director of Soul Train entertainment limited.

Essien-Igbokwe sang her songs in [[Igbo language|Igbo]], [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]], [[Efik people|Efik]], [[Hausa language|Hausa]], [[Yoruba language|Yoruba]] as well as in [[English language|English]]. Essien's fluency in Igbo, Hausa, Yoruba, English and her native [[Ibibio language|Ibibio]] earned her an appeal which cut across tribal lines. She died in an undisclosed hospital in [[Lagos]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vanguardngr.com/2011/07/how-christy-essien-died-50/|title=How Christy Essien died @ 50 - Vanguard News|date=2011-07-01|work=Vanguard News|access-date=2018-05-24|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Essien-Igbokwe was born in Okat, Onna Local Government Area of [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom State, Nigeria]]. She lost her mother at the age of 12 and her father in 2005. Growing up she lived in [[Aba, Abia|Aba, Abia State]] with her late mother's friend who encouraged her singing career and bought her a fairly used cassette player to record her songs.

==Career==
Essien-Igbokwe began her musical career in Secondary School singing at various clubs such as Uka Onu's Club and Unikoko in [[Aba, Abia|Aba]], [[Abia State]].  She featured on a programme called 'Now Sound' on the [[Nigerian Television Authority]] Channel 6, [[Aba, Abia|Aba]] . During that time, a show called 'The New Masquerade' was also airing on the same station . During a taping of one of the show's episodes, she corrected  a cast member who rehearsed his lines incorrectly, thereafter she was offered a role in the series. In 1976 she joined the cast of 'The New Masquerade'and played the role of Akpenor, the wife of the cantankerous character, Jegede Sokoya (played by Claude Eke).Her role on that popular show put her in the limelight and in 1977 she launched a professional music career by releasing her debut album  called 'Freedom'. Many of her albums became hit records, but none came close to the success of her 1981 hit album 'Ever Liked My Person' produced by [[Lemmy Jackson]].

Always at the forefront of issues affecting women and children, she played roles in some of the early [[Nollywood]] flicks such as 'Flesh and Blood' and 'Scars of Womanhood', both of which addressed issues of child abuse and female circumcision. With a desire to make life better for [[List of Nigerian musicians|Nigerian artists]],she is credited as having initiated the first meeting that brought about the formation of the Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria in 1981. A year later, the association was founded and [[King Sunny Adé]] became the president with the late [[Sonny Okosun]] serving as his vice, while she was the national treasurer. Between 1996 and 1999, she became the first female president of the association. The [[Akwa Ibom State|Akwa Ibom]] born performer featured in many national and international shows and also had the honour of composing and performing what would later be known as her state's informal anthem, "Akwa Ibom Mmi (My Akwa Ibom)" in 1987, its year of creation. She operated a shop in Etinan, her native town in [[Akwa Ibom State]] where she sold industrial printing machines.

==Family==
She got married in October 1979 to Chief Edwin Chukwunenye Igbokwe the then managing director of [[The Punch|Punch Newspapers]], till her time of death she remained married with four male children. They are Mr Obiora Chukwuemeka Igbokwe, Mr Chinwuba Kenechukwu [https://www.facebook.com/KAKA.IGBOKWE Kaka] Igbokwe, Mr Solomon Chukwukadibia Olubunmi Igbokwe and Mr Lucky Samuel Azubueze Igbokwe.

==Charity Programmes==
Her Charity programmes dated back to 1980 when she started championing the cause of the less privileged in our society especially the Nigerian Child.  This is also evidenced in her works such as:
* Show a Little Bit of Kindness
* Do You Hear Me Children?
*[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDrApu9APBk Seun Rere]
* Hear the Call
* Onwegh Ihe Ka Nnwa Na Uwa (Nothing is greater than child)
In fact Royalty from the sales of her past albums remains directed towards charity projects and the needy in our society.

==Charity And Tourism Projects==
# The Lady of Songs has successfully and single-handedly pursued and executed charity projects in the following States in [[Nigeria]]
#[[Adamawa State]] (then [[Gongola State]]); where she raised funds used by the State Government to fence, equip, renovate and provide drinkable water and main pump to the State’s only rehabilitation centre (at Jada) for the handicapped.
#[[Rivers State]]; where she raised funds for the Catholic Children’s Home and Psychiatric School.
#[[Enugu State]] (then old [[Anambra State|Anambra]]); where she fully  equipped refectory for the School of the Blind, Deaf and Dumb, Ogbete, [[Enugu State|Enugu]]
#[[Plateau State]]; where she raised funds through Command Performances to provide scholarship endowment fund for able-bodied and handicapped children of the State origin.
# Dedication of all proceeds from her tenth album to Essential Child care Foundation’s coffer.
# She has scores of students under her scholarship studying in various institutions within the country ([[Nigeria]]).
# Her Charity work does not stop in [[Nigeria]]

* In [[Liberia]] before the [[Liberian Civil War|civil war]], she (considering how popular she was there) was the guest of that country’s government; to raise fund for improvement of the only television organization (then) during President [[Samuel Doe]]’s tenure.
* In [[Ghana]] where she was invited to raise fund and also launch potential Tourism in Ghana that is still booming till today. This was in 1994.

==Some Of Her Other Outstanding Achievements==
# FORMATION OF PMAN: With her ideas and husband’s support, she recorded the feat as the brain behind the formation of the only recognized national (union) body for musicians in the country, aptly called [[Performing Musicians Association of Nigeria|Performing Musicians Employers Association of Nigeria]] (PMAN) in 1982. It is meant to cater for the welfare and protection of Nigerian musicians and their rights, nationally and internationally. When the Union was heading for extinction, she was dragged to head it so as to revive her baby. This culminated in her serving as PMAN President for two terms and remains, till date, the only female so far to have headed a trade union in Nigeria.
# FORMATION OF PMRS: She is a founding member of the Performing and Mechanical Rights Society (PMRS) of Nigeria and was the Chairman of the Board for two consecutive terms; becoming the second female to head the Society – after Chief (Mrs.) Keji Okunowo. The society is majorly concerned with the general responsibility of negotiating, collecting and distributing royalties on behalf of musical copyright owners who are mostly its members.
# ABROGATION OF OFFSHORE/ONSHORE OIL DICHOTOMY: It is on record that what the littoral State in Nigeria are enjoying today is as a result of the abrogation of the obnoxious onshore and offshore oil dichotomy which was made possible by God through Christy’s final push. She mounted campaign of persuasion that saw the regime of [[Ibrahim Babangida|General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida]] initiate and abrogate the dichotomy; thereby putting paid to the struggle that lasted decades.
# SUSTAINED EXISTENCE OF THE FRSC: It was through her interventional effort that the [[Federal Road Safety Corps (Nigeria)|Federal Road Safety Commission]] (FRSC) remains today as separate entity. When it was planned for scrapping or merging with the Nigeria Police Force, she brought pressure to bear on the Federal government and thus the FRSC was spared till today. This again was during the tenure of Military President [[Ibrahim Babangida|General Ibrahim Badamosi Babangida]].
# PRIVATE TELEPHONY: It is a fact that granting license for the private telephony started from the regime of late [[Sani Abacha|General Sani Abacha]]. Christy had to intervene by pushing forward the idea that the world is fast changing in telecommunication. The idea came to her when a private telephone company (EMIS) that had its equipment and staff ready approached her with their predicament as a result of license denial. She fought this and thus EMIS became the first privately licensed telecommunication company; others then followed with ease.

==Later life and Death==
Close to the time of her death, she was involved in private business, running the non-governmental organisation "Essential Child Care Foundation" involved in child welfare needs and rights as well. Her recent public outings include the [[Mo Abudu|Inspire Africa Benefit Concert]] in January 2009, where she performed alongside her son Kaka and the [[MTN Group|MTN]] Musical Festival, a musical show of old and new-breed musicians in 2009.

Her second son, Kaka is also towing the music line. He is a hip hop artiste and producer. One of her earliest albums 'Ever Liked my Person' sold above platinum till date. So popular was one of its hit songs '[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FDrApu9APBk Seun Rere]', that a number of African countries have sung their own version. The singer intended to spend the day with the less-privileged children as she has always done over the years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://234next.com/csp/cms/sites/Next/Home/5640824-146/christy_essien_igbokwe_turns_50_today.csp|title=Christy Essien turns 50 Today - Next.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards and honours ==
Essien-Igbokwe won several awards throughout her career including Nigerian lady of songs award which she received in 1984, Africa music mother award 1984, International special achievement award in Mexico in 1983, world song festival award, Los Angeles, queen of music international award association of theatre arts practitioners in Lagos in 1996 and outstanding achievement in female uplifting. She also contributed enormously to nation building, peace and tolerance – which, alongside moral uprightness, remain constant themes of her songs.

On November 11, 2018, [[Google]] recognized her with a [[Google Doodle|doodle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = https://www.google.com/doodles/christy-essien-igbokwes-58th-birthday | title= Christy Essien Igbokwe’s 58th Birthday | website =  google.com | language=en | access-date=2018-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Lee Chaum''' (born 1955) is an American [[computer scientist]] and [[List of cryptographers|cryptographer]]. He is famous for developing [[ecash]], an electronic cash application that aims to preserve a user’s anonymity. He has also invented many [[cryptography|cryptographic]] protocols and founded [[DigiCash]], an [[Digital currency|electronic money]] corporation.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"&gt;Greenberg, Andy (2012).

== Life and career ==

Chaum gained a doctorate in computer science and business administration from the [[University of California, Berkeley]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;David Lee Chaum.

"[https://www.forbes.com/forbes/1999/1101/6411390a_print.html Requiem for a Bright Idea]". ''Forbes''.&lt;/ref&gt; Also that year, he founded the [[International Association for Cryptologic Research]] (IACR), which currently organizes academic conferences in cryptography research.&lt;ref name="Blanchette"&gt;Blanchette, Jean-François (2012). ''Burdens of Proof: Cryptographic Culture and Evidence Law in the Age of Electronic Documents''. MIT Press. {{ISBN|026230080X}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|47}} Subsequently, he taught at the [[New York University]] Graduate School of Business Administration and at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB). He also formed a cryptography research group at the [[National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science|National Research Institute for Mathematics and Computer Science (CWI)]] in [[Amsterdam]], The Netherlands.&lt;ref name="idtrail1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idtrail.org/content/view/28/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202223014/http://www.idtrail.org/content/view/28/ |archivedate=2013-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He founded [[DigiCash]], an electronic cash company, in 1990.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;{{rp|119}}

== Notable research contributions ==

=== Digital cash ===

Chaum is credited as the inventor of secure digital cash for his 1982 paper, which also introduced the cryptographic primitive of a [[blind signature]].&lt;ref name="Cha82"&gt;{{cite journal |first=David |last=Chaum |title=Blind signatures for untraceable payments |journal=Advances in Cryptology Proceedings of Crypto |year=1983 |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=199–203 |url=http://www.hit.bme.hu/~buttyan/courses/BMEVIHIM219/2009/Chaum.BlindSigForPayment.1982.PDF |doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0602-4_18}}&lt;/ref&gt; These ideas have been described as the technical roots of the vision of the [[Cypherpunk]] movement that began in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="narayanan"&gt;Arvind Narayanan: [http://randomwalker.info/publications/crypto-dream-part1.pdf What Happened to the Crypto Dream?, Part 1].  IEEE Security &amp; Privacy. Volume 11, Issue 2, March–April 2013, pages 75-76, ISSN 1540-7993&lt;/ref&gt; Chaum's proposal allowed users to obtain digital currency from a bank and spend it in a manner that is untraceable by the bank or any other party.&lt;ref name="Cha85"&gt;{{cite journal | first = David | last = Chaum | authorlink = David Chaum | title = Security without identification: transaction systems to make big brother obsolete | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 28 |date=October 1985 | issue = 10 | doi = 10.1145/4372.4373 | pages = 1030–1044}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1988, he extended this idea (with [[Amos Fiat]] and [[Moni Naor]]) to allow offline transactions that enable detection of double-spending.&lt;ref name="CFN88"&gt;{{citation

In 1990, he founded [[DigiCash]], an electronic cash company, in Amsterdam to commercialize the ideas in his research.&lt;ref name="Greenberg"/&gt;{{rp|119}} The first electronic payment was sent in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Digital_money/?f=digicash.announce.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150107040853/https://w2.eff.org/Privacy/Digital_money/?f=digicash.announce.txt |archivedate=2015-01-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1999, Chaum left the company.&lt;ref name="idtrail1"/&gt;

=== New types of digital signatures ===

In the same 1982 paper that proposed digital cash, Chaum introduced [[blind signature]]s.&lt;ref name="Cha82"/&gt; This form of digital signature blinds the content of a message before it is signed, so that the signer cannot determine the content. The resulting blind signature can be publicly verified against the original, unblinded message in the manner of a regular digital signature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2339 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120826003324/http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2339 |archivedate=2012-08-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, he (with Hans van Antwerpen) introduced [[undeniable signature]]s.&lt;ref name="CV89"&gt;David Chaum, Hans van Antwerpen: ''Undeniable Signatures''; Crypto'89, LNCS 435, Springer-Verlag, Berlin 1990, 212-216.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of digital signature uses a verification process that is interactive, so that the signatory can limit who can verify the signature. Since signers may refuse to participate in the verification process, signatures are considered valid unless a signer specifically uses a disavowal protocol to prove that a given signature was not authentic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2344 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820015410/http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2344 |archivedate=2012-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, he (with Eugene van Heyst) introduced [[group signature]]s, which allow a member of a group to anonymously sign a message on behalf of the entire group.&lt;ref name="CH91"&gt;{{cite journal | first1 = David | last1 = Chaum | first2 = Eugene | last2 = van Heyst | title = Group signatures | work = Advances in Cryptology — EUROCRYPT ’91 | volume = 547 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | year = 1991 | pages = 257–265 | url = https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~bssadjad/courses/crypto/group_signature_chaum.pdf }}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; However an appointed group manager holds the power to revoke the anonymity of any signer in the case of disputes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2342 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-06-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120820015447/http://www.rsa.com/rsalabs/node.asp?id=2342 |archivedate=2012-08-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anonymous communication ===

In 1981, Chaum proposed the idea of an anonymous communication network in a paper.&lt;ref name="Cha81"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Chaum | first1 = D. L. | title = Untraceable electronic mail, return addresses, and digital pseudonyms | doi = 10.1145/358549.358563 | journal = Communications of the ACM | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 84–90 | year = 1981 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; His proposal, called [[mix network]]s, allows a group of senders to submit an encryption of a message and its recipient to a server. Once the server has a batch of messages, it will reorder and obfuscate the messages so that only this server knows which message came from which sender. The batch is then forwarded to another server who does the same process. Eventually, the messages reach the final server where they are fully decrypted and delivered to the recipient. A mechanism to allow return messages is also proposed. Mix networks are the basis of some [[Anonymous remailer|remailers]] and are the conceptual ancestor to modern anonymous web browsing tools like [[Tor (anonymity network)|Tor]] (based on [[onion routing]]). Chaum has advocated that every router be made, effectively, a Tor node.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|id=WqgHh7KXTFM#t=44m55s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, Chaum introduced a different type of anonymous communication system called a DC-Net, which is a solution to his proposed [[Dining cryptographers problem|Dining Cryptographers Problem]].&lt;ref name="Cha88"&gt;{{cite journal | author=David Chaum | title=The Dining Cryptographers Problem: Unconditional Sender and Recipient Untraceability | journal=Journal of Cryptology | volume=1 | issue=1 | year=1988 | pages=65–75 | doi=10.1007/BF00206326 | url=http://www.cs.cornell.edu/People/egs/herbivore/dcnets.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; DC-Nets is the basis of the software tool Dissent.&lt;ref&gt;http://korz.cs.yale.edu/2010/anon/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trustworthy voting systems ===

Chaum has made numerous contributions to secure voting systems, including the first proposal of a system that is [[End-to-end auditable voting systems|end-to-end verifiable]]. This proposal, made in 1981,&lt;ref name="Cha81"/&gt; was given as an application of mix networks. In this system, the individual ballots of voters were kept private which anyone could verify that the tally was counted correctly. This, and other early cryptographic voting systems, assumed that voters could reliably compute values with their personal computers. In 1991, Chaum introduced SureVote which allowed voters to cast a ballot from an untrustworthy voting system,&lt;ref&gt;David Chaum (2001), "SureVote: Technical Overview," ''Proceedings of the Workshop on Trustworthy Elections (WOTE ’01)''.&lt;/ref&gt; proposing a process now called "code voting" and used in remote voting systems like Remotegrity.&lt;ref&gt;Filip Zagorski and Richard T. Carback and David Chaum and Jeremy Clark and Aleksander Essex and Poorvi L. Vora (2013), "[http://eprint.iacr.org/2013/214 Remotegrity: Design and Use of an End-to-End Verifiable Remote Voting System]," ''11th International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security (ACNS 2013)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Chaum introduced the first in-person voting system in which voters cast ballots electronically at a polling station and cryptographically verify that the DRE did not modify their vote (or even learn what it was).&lt;ref&gt;Declan McCullagh, [http://news.cnet.com/High%20hopes%20for%20unscrambling%20the%20vote/2100-1028_3-5227789.html "High hopes for unscrambling the vote"], CNET News, June 8, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; In the following years, Chaum proposed (often with others) a series a cryptographically verifiable voting systems that use conventional paper ballots: [[Pret a Voter]],&lt;ref&gt;

=== Other contributions ===

In 1979, Chaum proposed a mechanism for splitting a key into partial keys, a predecessor to [[secret sharing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Chaum | first1 = D. | chapter = How to Keep a Secret Alive | doi = 10.1007/3-540-39568-7_40 | title = Advances in Cryptology | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 196 | pages = 481–485 | year = 1985 | isbn = 978-3-540-15658-1 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1985, Chaum proposed the original [[Digital credential|anonymous credential]] system,&lt;ref name="Cha85"/&gt; which is sometimes also referred to as a pseudonym system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = Anna | last1 = Lysyanskaya|author1-link=Anna Lysyanskaya | authorlink2 = Ron Rivest | first2 = Ronald L. | last2 = Rivest | first3 = Amit | last3 = Sahai | first4 = Stefan | last4 = Wolf | chapter = Pseudonym systems | title = [[Selected Areas in Cryptography]] | editor1-link = Howard Heys | editor1-first = Howard M. | editor1-last = Heys | editor2-link = Carlisle Adams | editor2-first = Carlisle M | editor2-last = Adams | series = [[Lecture Notes in Computer Science]] | volume = 1758 | publisher = Springer | year = 2000 | isbn = 978-3-540-67185-5 | doi = 10.1007/3-540-46513-8_14 | pages = 184–199}}&lt;/ref&gt; This stems from the fact that the credentials of such a system are obtained from and shown to organizations using different pseudonyms which cannot be linked.

In 1988,  Chaum with [[Gilles Brassard]] and [[Claude Crepeau]] published a paper&lt;ref name="BCC88"&gt;Gilles Brassard, David Chaum, and Claude Crepeau, ''[http://crypto.cs.mcgill.ca/~crepeau/PDF/BCC88-jcss.pdf Minimum Disclosure Proofs of Knowledge]'', Journal of Computer and System Sciences, vol. 37, pp. 156–189, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; that introduced [[Zero-knowledge proofs|zero-knowledge arguments]], as well as a security model using information-theoretic private-channels, and also first formalized the concept of a [[commitment scheme]].

1991, with Torben Pedersen, he demonstrated a well-cited [[zero-knowledge proof]] of a [[Decisional Diffie–Hellman assumption|DDH tuple]].&lt;ref name="CP92"&gt;David Chaum and Torben P. Pedersen. 1992. Wallet Databases with Observers. In Proceedings of the 12th Annual International Cryptology Conference on Advances in Cryptology (CRYPTO '92), Ernest F. Brickell (Ed.). Springer-Verlag, London, UK, UK, 89-105.&lt;/ref&gt; This proof is particularly useful as it can prove proper reencryption of an [[ElGamal encryption|Elgamal]] ciphertext.

Chaum contributed to an important [[commitment scheme]] which is often attributed to Pedersen. In fact, Pedersen, in his 1991 paper,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Pedersen | first1 = T. P. | chapter = Non-Interactive and Information-Theoretic Secure Verifiable Secret Sharing | doi = 10.1007/3-540-46766-1_9 | title = Advances in Cryptology — CRYPTO '91 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 576 | pages = 129–140 | year = 1992 | isbn = 978-3-540-55188-1 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; cites a rump session talk on an unpublished paper by Jurjen Bos and Chaum for the scheme. It appeared even earlier in a paper by Chaum, Damgard, and Jeroen van de Graaf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Chaum | first1 = D. | last2 = Damgård | first2 = I. B. | last3 = Graaf | first3 = J. | doi = 10.1007/3-540-48184-2_7 | chapter = Multiparty Computations Ensuring Privacy of Each Party’s Input and Correctness of the Result | title = Advances in Cryptology — CRYPTO '87 | series = Lecture Notes in Computer Science | volume = 293 | pages = 87 | year = 1988 | isbn = 978-3-540-18796-7 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The scheme is widely used as it is a simple perfectly hiding commitment, that is binding assuming the hardness of the [[discrete logarithm problem]].

In 1993 with Stefan Brands, Chaum introduced the concept of a [[distance-bounding protocol]].&lt;ref name="BC93"&gt;Stefan Brands, David Chaum: Distance-bounding protocols (extended abstract). Proceedings Eurocrypt '93.&lt;/ref&gt; Using round-trip delay based on the speed of light, it allows one party to establish an upper-bound on the physical distance from another in an authenticated way.

'''Deuter''' (born '''Georg Deuter''', 1945) is a German [[new-age music|new age]] instrumentalist and recording artist known for his ersatz style that blends Eastern and Western musical elements.

==Biography==
Born in 1945 in [[post-war]] [[Germany]] in the town of [[Falkenhagen]], Deuter taught himself the [[guitar]],  [[flute]], [[harmonica]] and "just about every instrument I could get my hands on," though it wasn’t until after a near-fatal car crash in his early twenties that he decided to pursue a career in music. His first release in 1971, titled ''D'', is widely acknowledged as a [[Krautrock]] classic. ''D'' marked the beginning of Deuter's spiritual and musical journey, ostensibly paving the way for a new genre of music known as New Age, which combined acoustic and electronic elements with ethnic instrumentation and nature sounds, such as [[whale song|whale]] and [[bird vocalization|bird song]], the open sea, wind in the trees, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/music/artist/card/0,,422869,00.html#artist_name |title=Deuter @ARTISTdirect |website=Artistdirect.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1970s and 1980s Deuter, after travelling extensively in [[Asia]] in search of spiritual and creative inspiration, settled for a long time in [[Pune]], [[India]], where under the name ''Chaitanya Hari'' he became a neo-[[Sannyasa|sannyasin]]&amp;nbsp;— a disciple of [[Rajneesh|Bhagwan Shree Rajneesh]], who later changed his name to Osho. With the aid of a multitrack [[tape machine]], living in the neo-sannyas ashram, he produced a series of music tapes to be used in "active meditations", consisting of several "stages" of ten or fifteen minutes each, which range between, and often merge, [[Indian classical music|Indian classical]] motifs, fiery drums, [[music loop|loops]], synthesisers, bells, [[musique concrète]] and pastoral acoustic passages. These works were constructed to the master's instructions in consultation with a team of disciples testing the meditation methods.

In the early 1990s, Deuter&amp;nbsp;— who always retained his professional name&amp;nbsp;— ended his long standing relationship with [[Kuckuck]], the small record label that had released nearly 20 original Deuter albums in as many years, and relocated to [[Santa Fe, New Mexico]] where he signed a deal with [[New Earth Records]], an independent label founded by fellow sannyasins [[Bhikkhu Schober]] and [[Waduda Paradiso]]. This proved to be a lucrative move for all involved, as Deuter's New Earth Records releases, the majority of them intended to accompany various healing and spiritual practices such as [[Reiki]], [[massage]] and [[meditation]] or, in the case of ''[[Earth Blue]]'' (2003), a collaboration with the [[Autostadt]] [[Volkswagen]] factory in [[Wolfsburg]], Germany, have sold well over half a million copies.

Deuter has learned (and arguably mastered) an ever-expanding array of instruments, including the [[Drum kit|drums]], the [[shakuhachi|shakuhachi flute]], the [[koto (musical instrument)|koto]], [[sitar]], [[Tibetan singing bowl]]s, [[santoor]], [[bouzouki]], [[piano]] and [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]]. He has recorded and released over 60 albums and claims to have sold more than he can count during the course of his career.

In 2016, Deuter's 2015 album ''Illumination of the Heart'' was voted among the top finalists for Album of the Year and Best Meditation/Relaxation Album by broadcasters and industry experts at [[Zone Music Reporter]]. In addition, Deuter received [[Zone Music Reporter]]'s Lifetime Achievement Award, recognizing his 40 years and more than 60 recordings of musical contribution to the [[New Age]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zonemusicreporter.com/admin/nominees.asp|website=Zone Music Reporter Award Nominees|publisher=Zone Music Reporter|accessdate=31 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although '''Edwin Oswald LeGrand''' (1801–1861) was born in [[North Carolina]], he was an original [[Texas|Texan]].  LeGrand was one of the fifty-seven men who signed the [[Texas Declaration of Independence]].  He was a [[San Augustine, Texas|San Augustine]] delegate to the [[Convention of 1836]] at [[Washington-on-the-Brazos]] and fought in the [[Battle of San Jacinto]].  His sister, Mrs. William Colson Norwood, and her family also settled in San Augustine, Texas.  LeGrand is buried near San Augustine.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2071">'''George Chapman''' (4 February 1921 – 9 August 2006) was an [[England|English]] [[Mediumship|medium]] and [[Energy medicine|spiritual healer]]. Active for 60 years, he was a medium for the spirit of "Dr. Lang", who conducted "spirit operations" on patients.

Chapman was born in [[Bootle]], near [[Liverpool]] on 4 February 1921, and was brought up by his maternal grandparents after the early death of his mother. After leaving school he took up various manual occupations, became a professional boxer, and, during [[World War II]], served in the [[Irish Guards]] and the [[RAF]]. He joined the ''Aylesbury Fire Brigade'' after being [[Demobilization|demobbed]], a post he held until 1956.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1526133/George-Chapman.html Obituary] ([[Daily Telegraph]], 12 Aug 2006).&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapman married Margaret May Dickinson and they had a daughter, Vivian, in 1945, who survived only 4 weeks. The couple were devastated by her premature death, but claimed to have received  "spirit messages" from her through the use of a [[ouija]] board.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

Chapman worked as a medium, it was alleged he channeled [[spirit guide]]s with names such ''Ram-a-din-i'' and ''Chang Woo''. His main spirit guide was a doctor called William Lang (1852-1937) who had been an ophthalmic surgeon at London's [[Middlesex Hospital]] up until 1914.&lt;ref name="siren"&gt;[[Joe Fisher (journalist)|Fisher, Joe]].

George Chapman died on 9 August 2006.&lt;ref name="obit" /&gt;

He was the first person to try and assassinate Muhammad during the [[Invasion of Dhi Amr]]. 

== Assassination attempt ==
According to Muslim scholar Sami Strauch, it is reported in [[Sahih Bukhari]] that it was raining, and Muhammad took his garments off and hung them on a tree to dry. While the enemy was watching, Ghwarath ibn al-Harith went to attack Muhammad. He threatened Muhammad with his sword and said "who will protect you from me on this day". Then, according to Muslim scholars, the Angel [[Gabriel]] appeared, thumped Ghawrath in the chest and forced him to drop his sword. Muhammad then picked up the sword and said "who will protect you from me".&lt;ref name="Strauch 2006 472" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sa'd 1967 40" /&gt;

Sahih al Bukhari mentions this incident:
{{cquote|bgcolor=#F0FFF0|That he fought in a Ghazwa towards Najd along with Allah's Apostle and when Allah's Apostle returned, he too, returned along with him. The time of the afternoon nap overtook them when they were in a valley full of thorny trees. Allah's Apostle dismounted and the people dispersed amongst the thorny trees, seeking the shade of the trees. Allah's apostle took shelter under a samura tree and hung his sword on it. We slept for a while when Allah's Apostle suddenly called us, and we went to him, to find a Bedouin sitting with him. Allah's Apostle said, "This (Bedouin) took my sword out of its sheath while I was asleep. When I woke up, the naked sword was in his hand and he said to me, 'Who can save you from me?, I replied, 'Allah.' Now here he is sitting." Allah's Apostle did not punish him (for that)"{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|5|59|458}} }}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1683">'''Gilbert DesRoches''' (23 or 24 July 1848 &amp;ndash; 2 June 1915) was a merchant, farmer and political figure in [[Prince Edward Island]]. He represented [[5th Prince]] in the [[Legislative Assembly of Prince Edward Island]] from 1899 to 1900.

He was born on 23 or 24 July 1848 in [[Miscouche, Prince Edward Island]], the son of Jean DesRoches and Nanette Poirier, [[Acadian]]s. In 1873, he married Sophie Poirier. He learned the trade of making shoes but then went into business with his brother-in-law, Joseph Poirier, in 1876. In 1880, he established his own business in Miscouche, building a store and grain storehouse. DesRoches also exported [[lobster]]s and [[Malpeque Bay|Malpeque]] [[oyster]]s. He served as local postmaster and, for a time, operated a construction business. In 1880, he attended the Convention Nationale des Canadiens Français at [[Quebec City]] and he helped organized the Second Acadian National Convention which was held in Miscouche in 1884. Desroches ran unsuccessfully for a seat in the provincial assembly in 1890 and 1893; he was elected in an 1899 by-election held after [[Alfred Lefurgey]] resigned his seat to run for a seat in the House of Commons. He was defeated in the 1900 general election. DesRoches died in Miscouche in 1915 after a long illness.

'''Hans Van Themsche''' (born 7 February 1988 in [[Wilrijk]], [[Antwerp]], [[Flemish Region]] of [[Belgium]]) was a Belgian student who in 2006 shot three people, killing two and severely injuring another, before being shot by police and incapacitated. He was sentenced to life in prison in 2008.

The homicide received widespread media attention and drew major public and political attention to responsibilities regarding political presentation of immigrant and racial issues and its possible effects on individuals.&lt;ref name="MClaeys1_20060525"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.ravagedigitaal.org/2006/mei/vermoordeonschuld.htm De vermoorde onschuld] ("''The murdered innocence''", here rather literally taken Dutch expression for ostensible innocence) by publicist Manu Claeys, 25 May 2006, on webzine (in the Netherlands) ''[http://www.ravagedigitaal.org Ravage Digitaal]''&lt;!-- (web retrieval 7 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tartu-BCammaerts1_2007"&gt;[http://www.researchingcommunication.eu/reco_book3.pdf Media technologies and democracy in an enlarged Europe] chapter: '4.

==Course of events==
Van Themsche had been caught smoking at his boarding school on 9 May 2006, and was facing likely expulsion.

He travelled&lt;!--evening 10th or morning 11th - though a resident of Wilrijk near Antwerp, across 3 provinces from Vrij Agro Biotechnisch Instituut boarding school--&gt; from [[Roeselare]] to Antwerp where, on the morning of the eleventh, he had his long hair cut and shaven off (apart from a ponytail) before legally purchasing a [[Marlin Model 336|Marlin 336W]] [[hunting rifle]] in [[.30-30 Winchester]] and ammunition from a local weapons merchant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gva.be/arch/wapenwet-wapen-als-van-themsche-wij-kochten-het-via-internet.aspx |title=Wapenwet: Wapen als Van Themsche? Wij kochten het via internet |publisher=Gva.be |date=2012-11-21 |accessdate=2012-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; About ten minutes before noon, dressed in a [[Gothic fashion]], he began his rampage in the city centre with a shot in the breast of a woman of [[Turkey|Turkish]] descent who was seated six metres away on a bench reading a book; Songul Koç was severely wounded. He chambered another round and passed a pregnant [[Mali]]an nanny, Oulemata Niangadou, and her two-year-old [[European ethnic groups|European]] charge, Luna Drowart. He turned and shot each of them in the back at close range, killing both instantly. While he moved on (presumably looking for more victims) Van Themsche was intercepted by a passing police officer, who held him at gunpoint and ordered him to surrender the rifle. After Van Themsche's refusal to put his weapon down and upon a suspicious movement, the officer fired once, neutralizing him with a shot to the stomach. Later on, Van Themsche's father would comment: "In my eyes, the policeman who shot down my son is a hero. I'm glad the man had so much courage, or else even more victims would have fallen."&lt;ref name="Nieuwsblad1_20070926_K21HR177"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=K21HR177 In 54 minuten veranderde alles] ("''In 54 minutes, everything changed''") - Van Themsche's 11 May 2006 in great detail, journal ''[[Het Nieuwsblad]]'', 26 September 2007&lt;!-- (web retrieval 21 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Trouw1_20060512"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.trouw.nl/hetnieuws/europa/article314927.ece/Moorden+Antwerpen+%2F+Racisme+was+de+drijfveer+voor+koele+moordenaar+ Moorden Antwerpen / Racisme was de drijfveer voor koele moordenaar] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930211637/http://www.trouw.nl/hetnieuws/europa/article314927.ece/Moorden+Antwerpen+%2F+Racisme+was+de+drijfveer+voor+koele+moordenaar+ |date=30 September 2007 }} ("''Murders Antwerp / Racism was the motivation for cool blooded murderer''"), journal (in The Netherlands) ''[[Trouw]]'', 12 May 2006&lt;!-- (web retrieval 4 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VRT1_20060512"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.vrtnieuws.be/nieuwsnet_master/versie2/nieuws/details/060512turkseneef/index.shtml Leiders extreemrechts zijn medeplichtig] ("''Leaders extreme right are also responsible''"), web news ''[[Vlaamse Radio- en Televisieomroep|VRT]]'', 12 May 2006&lt;!-- (web retrieval 21 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMorgen1_20060513"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.demorgen.be/binnenland/?news=own1147478018 Jonge dader bekent racistisch motief] ("''Young culprit confesses racist motive''"), journal ''[[De Morgen]]'', 13 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nieuwsblad2_20060513_G2CS8AJU"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/Article/Detail.aspx?ArticleID=G2CS8AJU Gepest door allochtonen] ("''Harassed by allochthones''"), journal ''Het Nieuwsblad'', 13 May 2006&lt;!-- (web retrieval 21 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DeStandaard1_20060513"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.standaard.be/artikel/detail.aspx?artikelid=G71S8A3R Quote.

Van Themsche, while being treated in hospital, described himself as a [[skinhead]] and admitted to police – as he had before the murders to boarding school friends – to specifically targeting non-whites. Of the 2-year old (white) child, Van Themsche said she was "in the wrong place at the wrong time". Her death, however, was not incidental, since he had to chamber a new round before each  shot. He told his interrogators "the presence near a black was sufficient reason" to kill the toddler. According to his statement, his reason for targeting minorities was that youths of foreign descent used to bully him at school; that would have been at least three years earlier. A farewell letter found in his room – as he may not have expected to survive – did not declare the premeditated murderous intent to which he confessed but did reveal that he wanted to take action against self-perceived "chaos in society".&lt;ref name="Trouw1_20060512"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DeMorgen1_20060513"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nieuwsblad2_20060513_G2CS8AJU"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DePers1_20071001"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.depers.nl/buitenland/107839/Belgisch-moordproces-van-start.html Belgisch moordproces van start] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719073707/http://www.depers.nl/buitenland/107839/Belgisch-moordproces-van-start.html |date=19 July 2011 }} ("''Belgian murder trial starts''") journal (in The Netherlands) ''De Pers'', 1 October 2007&lt;!-- (web retrieval 25 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VTM1_20060512"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.vtm.be/forum/showthread.php?t=6668#1 Antwerpse killer wou "afrekenen met ordeloosheid in de samenleving"]{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} ("''Antverpian killer wanted ‘to get even with’'' [or ''‘rid of’''] ''‘chaos in society’''"), web news anchor super moderator ''VTM'': the News, 12 May 2006&lt;!-- (web retrieval 13 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

An impromptu peaceful protest against Vlaams Belang organized on 15 May at Brussels held the traditional minute of silence for Van Themsche's victims.&lt;ref name="LibreBelgique1"&gt;{{fr icon}} [http://lalibre.be/article.phtml?id=10&amp;subid=90&amp;art_id=285962 Un non bigarré au Belang] ("''A colourful No at the [Vlaams] Belang''"), journal ''[[La Libre Belgique]]'', 15 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night of 16–17 May 2006, a [[Molotov cocktail]] was thrown into the head office of the Flemish nationalist youth organisation Vlaams Nationaal Jeugdverbond (VNJ) in [[Berchem]] that has links to the Vlaams Belang. A [[Turkey|Turkish]] courier could quickly extinguish the fire, especially as the apartment above the office was inhabited (as it turned out, by the mother of [[New Flemish Alliance]] (N-VA) president [[Bart De Wever]]).&lt;ref name="VRT6"&gt;''VRT'', 'Het journaal' (19h) TV news, 17 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nieuwsblad7_20060520_GOOSHMLF"&gt;{{nl icon}} [http://www.nieuwsblad.be/article/detail.aspx?articleid=GOOSHMLF Redder in nood Bart De Wever (N-VA) zoekt 'held' die zijn moeder redde] ("''Rescuer Bart De Wever (N-VA) seeks 'hero' who saved his mother''"), journal ''Het Nieuwsblad'', 20 May 2006&lt;!-- (web retrieval 6 February 2010)--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the murders, the government tried to take action against Flemish entries on websites where it judged hate and racism to be spread, such as [[Stormfront (website)|Stormfront]]. This proved difficult, because the sites are American and protected by the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]].&lt;ref name="Tartu-BCammaerts1_2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="VRT5"&gt;''VRT'', 'Het journaal' (19h) TV news, 16 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

"From my first being chosen president of the College (1681) to my resigning my Relation to that society (1701) was full 20 years." &lt;/ref&gt; He was influential in the administration of the colony during a time that coincided with the notorious [[Salem witch trials]].

====Education====
In 1651 Mather was admitted to [[Harvard College]], where he roomed with and studied under Robert Massey. When he graduated in 1656, aged 17, with a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]],&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt; he began to train for the [[Christian ministry|ministry]], and gave his first sermon on his 18th birthday.&lt;ref name="ref1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|last=Webster|first=Richard|wstitle=Mather, Increase|accessdate=June 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quickly left Massachusetts and went to Ireland, where he studied at [[Trinity College, Dublin]] for an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] During his time at Trinity College he was licensed as a Commonwealth Minister by [[Oliver Cromwell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=amQ1DwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT43&amp;lpg=PT43&amp;dq=Increase+Mather+Trinity+College+Commonwealth+Minister+Oliver+Cromwell&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=OkYLyv8jhl&amp;sig=WpKv2gUVNFcuctZ_vIdPakWa5vU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwit_Oa4handAhWBIzQIHW_bAc4Q6AEwCnoECAQQAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Increase%20Mather%20Trinity%20College%20Commonwealth%20Minister%20Oliver%20Cromwell&amp;f=false|title=Colonial Horrors: Sleepy Hollow and Beyond|last=Davis|first=Graeme|date=2017-10-03|publisher=Pegasus Books|isbn=9781681775906|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; to the joint charge of St Tida's Church ([[Ballyscullion]]), and St Swithan's Church ([[Magherafelt]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Kl7tsbpslc4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=increase+mather+Ballyscullion&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=hswwsE7nFX&amp;sig=ma6XGPs0Jr9cxmVu2SCV7n5JRsk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiXtJmni6ndAhXSFzQIHT0qAvU4ChDoATABegQICRAB#v=onepage&amp;q=increase%20mather%20Ballyscullion&amp;f=false|title=Irish Immigrants in the Land of Canaan: Letters and Memoirs from Colonial and Revolutionary America, 1675-1815|last=Miller|first=Kerby A.|last2=Schrier|first2=Arnold|last3=Boling|first3=Bruce D.|last4=Doyle|first4=David N.|date=2003-03-27|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195348224|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1658, and worked as a [[chaplain]] attached to a garrison in the [[Channel Islands]] from 1659 to 1661 with a short stint at a church in Gloucester in 1660.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VYq1MUnuhuMC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Mathers:+Three+Generations+of+Puritan+Intellectuals,+1596-1728&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjgid66iandAhUoslQKHeEAD4wQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=increase%20mather&amp;f=false|title=The Mathers: Three Generations of Puritan Intellectuals, 1596–1728|last=Middlekauff|first=Robert|date=1999-06-29|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=9780520219304|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

After Cromwell's death in 1658, Mather felt less secure in his post in the Channel Islands due to [[Charles II of England|Charles II]]'s return to the throne.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HSVJDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA36&amp;lpg=PA36&amp;dq=increase+mather+chaplain+channel+islands&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=EK04RoHMFS&amp;sig=gk7ZPOwrdkGFJFf6U50OgbH8vyI&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiyxZzG_6jdAhXiyVQKHRdvDRg4ChDoATAIegQIABAB#v=onepage&amp;q=increase&amp;f=false|title=God's Country: Christian Zionism in America|last=Goldman|first=Samuel|date=2018-02-20|publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press|isbn=9780812250039|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He resigned the position in 1660 and sailed for Boston in 1661.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Harvard later awarded Mather the first [[honorary degree]] in the [[New World]], becoming a [[Doctor of Sacred Theology]], in 1692.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt;
[[File:MatherEliot House.jpg|thumb|left|The house built in 1677 by Increase Mather near the north corner of Hanover and North Bennet Streets, Boston, survived into the 20th century; pictured in 1898]]

===Establishing himself in Massachusetts===
In 1661, with the advent of the [[English Restoration]] and resurgence of [[Anglicanism]], Increase returned to Massachusetts, where he married Maria Cotton. She was his step-sister by virtue of his father's marriage to Sarah Hankredge, widow of [[John Cotton (puritan)|John Cotton]] and mother of Maria.&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt; She gave birth to [[Cotton Mather]] in 1663. In 1676, he published ''A Brief History of the War with the Indians in New-England'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://digitalcommons.unl.edu/libraryscience/31 Profile], digitalcommons.unl.edu; accessed December 24, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; a contemporary account of [[King Philip's War]].

He was [[ordination|ordained]] as minister of the [[Second Church, Boston|North Church]],&lt;ref&gt;(the original Old North meetinghouse, not to be confused with the Anglican/Episcopal [[Old North Church]]).&lt;/ref&gt; He held this post until he died.&lt;ref name="colombia"/&gt; 

====Harvard College====
In his [https://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44525082.pdf Autobiography], Increase Mather writes that he was [[President of Harvard University|President of Harvard]], from 1681 until 1701, but due to charter and organizational changes, his official title varied. On June 11, 1685, he was made Acting President and on July 23, 1686, he was appointed [[Rector (academia)|Rector]]. On June 27, 1692, he finished writing the new college charter and became president.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt; On September 5, 1692, while the Salem trials were still ongoing, Increase Mather was awarded a doctorate of divinity, the first doctorate issued at Harvard, and the last for 79 years. &lt;ref&gt; [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=tQ4UAAAAIAAJ Benjamin Pierce, A History of Harvard University], 1833 p. 64 &lt;/ref&gt;

He was rarely present on campus or in the town, especially during his term of Rector as he was out of the Colony for all but two years of his term in that office. Despite his absences he did make some changes: re-implementation of [[Greek language|Greek]] and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] instruction, replacement of classical Roman authors with [[Bible|Biblical]] and Christian authors in [[ethics]] classes, enactment of requirements that students attend classes regularly, live and eat on campus, and that seniors not [[hazing|haze]] other students.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt;

===Involvement in politics===
While politics and Puritan religion were closely related during Increase's lifetime, his first direct involvement with politics occurred as a result of [[James II of England]]'s manipulation of the New England governments. In 1686 James revoked the [[Massachusetts Charter|Charter of Massachusetts]] in the process of creating the [[Dominion of New England]].&lt;ref name="colombia"/&gt;

The Dominion was headed by [[Edmund Andros]], who not only disliked puritanism and was haughty,&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt; but ruled as a near absolute dictator: [[Town meeting]]s were outlawed, leaving the Dominion without [[consent of the governed]], marriage was removed from the clergy, and the [[Old South Church]] was temporarily appropriated for [[Anglicanism|Anglican]] services.&lt;ref name="ish"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interactive State House|work=Governors of Massachusetts|publisher=[[Commonwealth of Massachusetts]]|url=http://www.mass.gov/statehouse/massgovs/eandros.htm|accessdate=2006-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1687 [[Declaration of Indulgence]], prohibiting discrimination against [[Roman Catholicism|Catholics]], saw staunch opposition from the Puritan establishment. When Mather successfully roused opposition to revocation of the charter, he was nearly framed for [[treason]]. He traveled to London (eluding spies out to catch him) to petition the King. While engaged in petitioning he published pieces to build popular support for his positions, such as ''A Narrative of the Miseries of New-England, By Reason of an [[dictatorship|Arbitrary Government]] Erected there Under Sir Edmund Andros'' (1688) and ''A Brief Relation for the Confirmation of Charter Privileges'' (1691).&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt;

He attempted to restore the old charter&lt;ref name="colombia"/&gt; and obtain a royal charter for Harvard; however, he abandoned that course and changed his petitions to a new charter not lacking any of the rights previously granted. Following the [[Glorious Revolution]] and [[1689 Boston revolt|subsequent overthrow]] of Andros, a new charter was granted to the colony.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt; The 1692 charter was a major departure from its predecessor, granting sweeping [[home rule]], establishing an elective [[legislature]], enfranchising all [[fee simple|freeholders]] (previously only men admitted to a congregation could vote), and uniting the Massachusetts Bay Colony and [[Plymouth Colony]].&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt; Following Andros' deposition and arrest,&lt;ref name="ish"/&gt; he had [[William Phips]] appointed as Royal Governor and they returned to Massachusetts, arriving on May 14, 1692.&lt;ref name="UMKC"&gt;{{cite web|title=Biography of Increase Mather|url=http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/ASA_INC.HTM|accessdate=2006-10-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061107131602/http://www.law.umkc.edu/faculty/projects/ftrials/salem/ASA_INC.HTM|archivedate=2006-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his return, the administration of Harvard grew increasingly insistent that he reside nearer to the institution. Not wanting to leave his Second Church, he did not do so, and eventually resigned the Presidency.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt;

===Early Influence and Involvement in the Salem witch trials===
In 1681, the same year he became president of Harvard (and when his son [[Cotton Mather]] was only eighteen year old), Increase Mather began work on a manuscript that was to be a collection of "illustrious providences" and he solicited contributions from the other Puritan ministers.&lt;ref&gt; [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=mzspT9uXw7AC Remarkable Providences], p. xxxii &lt;/ref&gt; This work demonstrated a belated interest in witchcraft relative to the European continent, where witch trials had gone into a steep decline after reaching "peak intensity during the century 1570-1670" but this reflected a similar belated interest among a certain milieu in London around the same time.&lt;ref&gt; On Witchcraft, ed. Benjamin J Kohl, HC Erik Midelfort, 1988, xvi.&lt;/ref&gt; Increase Mather's book "Remarkable Providences" was published in 1684 and forwards a doctrinal belief in the real power of witchcraft. One of the more curious aspects of the book is that while it cites numerous Reformation theologians (Luther, Beza, Melancthon) and many well-known writers on witchcraft including the notorious witch-hunting manual written by a Dominican inquisitor, [[Malleus Maleficarum]], &lt;ref&gt; ibid.p.140, citation is of "Sprenger"&lt;/ref&gt; it does not cite [[Jean Calvin]]. 

In November 1692 he published ''Cases of Conscience Concerning Evil Spirits'' which defended the judges and trials, but also expressed words of caution, perhaps due to public pressure. In the postscript, included with the initial first edition of the book, he mentions his own attendance at the trial of George Burroughs and his agreement with the capitol judgement against him. [[George Burroughs]] had been a fellow minister who seems to have substituted at the pulpit for Increase Mather on at least one occasion.&lt;ref&gt; [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=m9h4AAAAMAAJ Diary of Increase Mather] 1675-6. Samuel A Green, Cambridge, 1900. p 8. See entry for April,1675. &lt;/ref&gt; Like his work from 1684, this 1692 work also cites Malleus Maleficarum. &lt;ref&gt;Bound together with his son's work from late 1692, in London edition and reprinted in 1862: [https://play.google.com/store/books/details?id=-hjcroqWQ1AC Wonders of the Invisible World]  
p. 270 &lt;/ref&gt;

Notwithstanding this, his reputation was not improved afterwards or for posterity due to his association with the trials as well as his subsequent refusal, for whatever reasons, to denounce them.&lt;ref name="UMKC"/&gt; He was also briefly mentioned in a thorough treatment of his son Cotton by [[Robert Calef]] in his comprehensive book of the Salem Trials and their aftermath, ''More Wonders of the Invisible World''&lt;ref name="va-rc"&gt;{{cite web|title=More wonders of the invisible world|publisher=University of Virginia|url=http://etext.virginia.edu/salem/witchcraft/speccol/calef/calef.html|accessdate=2006-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; (referred to as ''More Wonders of the Spiritual World'' by the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition]]).&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt; Increase Mather was said to have burned Calef's book in [[Harvard Yard]].

===Later life and death===
[[File:Increase Mather grave.jpg|thumb|right|The Mather tomb in [[Copp's Hill Cemetery]]]] 
In 1715, following the death of his wife Maria the previous year, he married Ann Cotton, widow of his nephew John.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britannica.com/biography/Increase-Mather "Increase Mather"], britannica.com; accessed March 3, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On September 27, 1722, he [[loss of consciousness|fainted]] and was thereafter bedridden. In August 1723 he suffered [[Urinary bladder|bladder failure]] and died three weeks later on August 23, 1723, in [[Boston]], aged 84. He was buried on [[Copp's Hill]].&lt;ref name="mhs"&gt;{{cite web|title=MHS Increase Mather Papers, 1659–1721 Guide to the Microfilm Edition|publisher=[[Massachusetts Historical Society]]|url=http://www.masshist.org/findingaids/doc.cfm?fa=fa0239|date=2006-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Before his death, he took lodging at the retreat of Mineral Spring Pond to recover from his illness and drink from the famous healing waters of the springs from [[Spring Pond]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pSkWAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA107&amp;dq=%22spring+pond%22+salem+ma&amp;lr=&amp;cd=31#v=onepage&amp;q=cotton%20mather&amp;f=false The Register of the Lynn Historical Society, Volumes 15–16 By Lynn Historical Society, page 105]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
Throughout his life Mather was a staunch Puritan, opposing anything openly contradictory to, mutually exclusive with, or potentially "distracting" from his religious beliefs. He supported suppression of [[Substance intoxication|intoxication]], unnecessary effort on Sundays and [[Sumptuary law|ostentatious clothing]]. He was initially opposed to the [[Half-Way Covenant]] but later supported it. He firmly believed in the direct appearance of God's disfavor in everyday life, e.g. the weather, political situations, attacks by Native Americans, fires and floods, etc.&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UMKC"/&gt;&lt;!--1st ref explicitly states so, second gives examples--&gt;

He was strenuous in attempting to keep people to his idea of morality,&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt; making strong use of [[jeremiad]]s to try to prevent indifference and especially to try to get government officials to enforce public morality. During his tenure at Harvard he regularly stamped out any relaxation of Puritan strictness, such as [[latitudinarianism]], which had flourished during his overseas absence.&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt;

Following his acceptance of the Covenant, [[Solomon Stoddard]] and others attempted to further liberalize Puritanism by [[baptism]] of children who had nonmember parents&lt;ref name="harv"/&gt; and admittance of all but the openly immoral to services. To try and stop this, Mather had a [[synod]] called to outlaw similar measures. A declaration was adopted, but never made binding.&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt; 

==Given name==
The stated reason for his first name was "...the never-to-be-forgotten [[wikt:increase|increase]], of every sort, wherewith God favoured the country about the time of his nativity."&lt;ref name="ref1911"/&gt; The name "[[Increase (given name)|Increase]]" is a literal translation of the Hebrew "Yosëf" ([[Joseph]]).

==In popular culture==
Increase Mather is played by [[Stephen Lang]] in the 2014 TV series ''[[Salem (TV series)|Salem]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/salem/246340/stephen-lang-interview-salems-most-feared-witch-hunter-speaks|title=Stephen Lang Interview: Salem's Most Feared Witch-Hunter Speaks|last=Sokol|first=Tony|date=May 20, 2015|work=Den of Geek|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ign.com/articles/2014/05/30/salem-exclusive-clip-stephen-lang-makes-his-debut-as-a-formidable-witch-hunter|title=Salem Exclusive Clip: Stephen Lang Makes His Debut as a Formidable Witch Hunter|last=Goldman|first=Eric|date=May 30, 2014|website=IGN|access-date=2018-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John''' "'''Jack'''" '''Davis''' (born 1933) is an American industrialist and [[perennial candidate]] from [[Newstead, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;Fairbanks, Phil (May 22, 2011). [http://www.buffalonews.com/topics/chris-lee/special-election/article429837.ece Sprawling district spans voter fears] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527041951/http://www.buffalonews.com/topics/chris-lee/special-election/article429837.ece |date=May 27, 2011 }}. ''The Buffalo News''. Retrieved 2011-05-22.&lt;/ref&gt; Davis ran four times for [[New York's 26th congressional district]] seat in the [[United States House of Representatives|U.S. House of Representatives]] between 2004 and 2011, three times as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] (twice as the general election candidate against incumbent [[Thomas M. Reynolds|Tom Reynolds]] and a third time in a three-way primary) and once as an independent.&lt;ref name="republicans join"/&gt;

Davis's primary motive for his political campaigns is his concern that the country is being destroyed by U.S. free trade policies which he says have led to the outsourcing of jobs to foreign countries and the decline of manufacturing in the United States.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="looking for"/&gt; Noted for his party-switching, Davis has said that had he won the 2011 election, he would have caucused in the House with the Republican and Tea Party caucuses.&lt;ref name="would caucus"/&gt;

A lifelong Republican, Davis switched to the Democrats after being kicked out of a fundraiser headlined by [[Dick Cheney]] in 2003 when he tried to ask Cheney questions about free trade policies.&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; He then ran for the U.S. Congress seat in his home district, NY-26, in 2004, 2006 and 2008 as a self-funded candidate, pouring in millions of his own funds and coming close to beating the incumbent Republican [[Thomas M. Reynolds|Thomas Reynolds]] in 2006. In the 2008 election, however, he came in third out of three in the Democratic primary.&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; He switched his affiliation back to Republican with the election of fellow wealthy industrialist Chris Lee, becoming an ally and supporter of Lee.&lt;ref name="looking for"/&gt; After Lee's abrupt departure from Congress in February 2011 Davis tried and failed to get the Republican nomination to replace Lee, then decided to run as an independent on a newly created Tea Party line.&lt;ref name="spurned"/&gt;&lt;ref name="looking for"/&gt;

Davis is the founder and owner of I Squared R Element Company, an [[Akron, New York]] manufacturer and seller of heating elements for high temperature furnaces, and has never outsourced jobs.&lt;ref name=company/&gt; He is also known for filing a [[Davis v. Federal Election Commission|successful lawsuit]] against the Federal Election Commission in 2006, claiming that the so-called "millionaire's amendment" to [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold Act]] was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court, with [[Samuel Alito|Justice Alito]] writing for the 5–4 majority, sided with Davis, striking down the millionaire's amendment as violating the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] for fundamentally restricting the right of a self-financing candidate to spend his or her own money in a preferred way.&lt;ref name="oyez"/&gt;

==Early years and education and business career==
Davis' early years were spent in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]]; he moved with his family to [[Buffalo, New York]] after World War II.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; His father was an engineer, and Davis discovered early on that he liked working on cars with his father and building things.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; He graduated from [[Amherst Central High School]] in 1951. He enrolled in the [[University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|University of Buffalo]], where he majored in industrial engineering and received his degree in 1955.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; Davis would later fund the construction of UB's [[Barbara and Jack Davis Hall|Davis Hall]], which bears his name.

Davis completed [[United States Marine Corps|Marine Corps]] Officer Training as a [[United States Marine Corps Reserve|reservist]] while in college, and served three years as an officer in the [[United States Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard]] upon graduation.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; He began work as an engineer in 1958, first at General Motors as a maintenance engineer, then at The Carborundum Company as a supervising sales engineer.

He started his [[silicon carbide]] heating element manufacturing business, I Squared R Element, in 1964&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; in a garage, and now employs 75 people in [[Akron, New York]] who receive employer provided health care and pension benefits.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jack's issues"/&gt; He has touted the fact that he has never outsourced any jobs.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; According to 2011 financial disclosure statements, Davis' net worth is between $18.2 million and $83.4 million (about half that of his opponent Jane Corwin).&lt;ref name="Corwin tops"/&gt;

==Party affiliations==
Davis was a self-described "Goldwater Republican" for 50 years. In late 2003, he attended a Republican fundraiser in Buffalo, featuring Vice President [[Dick Cheney]]. Davis insisted on talking to Cheney about U.S. free trade policies, which Cheney's staff refused to allow, ordering Davis to be ejected from the fundraiser.&lt;ref name="would caucus"/&gt; Davis then quit the Republican party.&lt;ref name="would caucus"/&gt; He later became a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] (2003), then founded the Save Jobs Party (2004–05), then rejoined the Republican Party (2008), and in March 2011 created the Tea Party ballot line by obtaining the required number of signatures.

==Political career==
&lt;!--the following paragraphs is a summary to precede the first subsection per MOS--&gt;
In 2004 and 2006 Davis ran as a Democrat in the general elections facing no primary challengers. He lost both times to incumbent Republican [[Thomas M. Reynolds|Tom Reynolds]], described by the ''New York Times'' as one of the most powerful Republicans in Congress.&lt;ref name="maverick"/&gt; In the 2008 race, Davis finished third place in a three-way Democratic primary to [[Alice Kryzan]]. In the ongoing 2011 election, Davis, who has been a registered Republican since 2008, is now s running on the "Tea Party" line.  He has said he is running again because of his concern that the country is being destroyed.&lt;ref name="looking for"/&gt;

A major theme of Davis' campaigns is that too many U.S. manufacturing jobs have been outsourced to foreign countries, with 53,000 manufacturing plants closed in the past 30 years and 17 million Americans presently unemployed.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; He believes U.S. free trade policies and agreements have caused the job loss and the great recession.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; He says the free trade policies have been pushed by multinational corporations and big box stores such as Walmart who effectively have purchased the White House and the U.S. Congress.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt; Davis says he is free of those influences, and wants to go to Washington to save American jobs, farms and industries.&lt;ref name="about jack"/&gt;

===2004 Congressional campaign===
{{See also|United States House elections, 2004}}
In 2004, Davis officially entered politics, running as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] for the U.S. Congress from the 26th District of New York against incumbent Republican Representative [[Thomas M. Reynolds|Tom Reynolds]], who was considered unbeatable. Davis doubled his original financial commitment to the race, pouring a total of $1.2 million of personal money into his campaign. Reynolds was forced to begin running campaign ads for the first time since his election in 1998.

On election day, Reynolds won, 56 percent to 44 percent; in contrast, he won the 2002 election 75 percent to 25 percent against the Democratic challenger. Many cite the amount spent by Davis as compared to Reynolds' prior challenger as the primary factor for the change. Some observers attributed the narrowed margin of victory to an undercurrent of resentment in the working-class areas of the 26th district over economic decline and a lack of manufacturing sector jobs. Others attributed the margin to the politics of the specific candidates; Reynolds' politics more closely resembling big-government neo-conservatism while Davis' more closely resembles the limited-government libertarian conservatism of Goldwater, the type of conservative thought more widely adhered to in [[Upstate New York]].

After the election, Davis was fined for a violation of campaign finance reporting laws. Davis had used his non-profit "Save Jobs" organization to funnel money into his political efforts, failing to comply with political disclosure requirements of both the federal government and New York State.

===Save Jobs Party===
Following his defeat in 2004, Davis continued his political activism by forming the Save Jobs Party to further his goals of repealing [[free-trade]] agreements, such as the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA) and the [[Central American Free Trade Agreement]] (CAFTA). Davis believed that free-trade allowed low-wage nations, such as China to compete unfairly with American-produced [[manufactured goods]] and agricultural crops. Davis believed that this would be a popular idea in his native [[Upstate New York]], which contained many struggling farms and factories. Although Republicans accused him of using the party merely as a springboard for a 2006 rematch against Reynolds, Davis sponsored more than a dozen candidates for public office in races across Western New York.

However, the Save Jobs party soon ran into trouble with state and federal officials. In one incident, an [[Erie County, New York|Erie County]] legislator sought an [[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI]] investigation over
last-minute automated phone calls ([[robocalls]]] that had been made from Davis's campaign headquarters.&lt;ref name="WGRZ"/&gt; In early 2006, Davis' state PAC was sued in State Supreme Court for improper filing of financial disclosures.&lt;ref name="eqs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fec"/&gt; Davis abandoned the fledgling party.

===2006 Congressional campaign===
{{See also|United States House elections, 2006}}
Davis ran against Reynolds as the candidate of the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], [[Working Families Party|Working Families]] and [[Independence Party of New York|Independence]] Parties in 2006. Davis received the Democratic nomination since no other Democrat chose to run in the September 12, 2006 primary. He appeared on three ballot lines and votes from all three nominating parties counted towards Davis' total under New York's [[electoral fusion]] rule.&lt;ref name="buffnews ed1"/&gt; As in 2004, Reynolds won, but by a much narrower margin.

With the [[Mark Foley scandal]] in full swing, pundits re-evaluated the odds of Davis winning against Reynolds. It was widely reported that Reynolds had knowledge of earlier e-mails between Foley and a page, although he was unaware of more explicit instant messages reported by [[ABC News]].&lt;ref name="rollcall"/&gt;

Davis led Reynolds in several polls taken during October 2006, but an early November poll showed him trailing 46 to 50.&lt;ref name="election scorecard"/&gt; He lost by a "hair's breadth", according to ''The Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt;

===2008 Congressional campaign===
{{See also|United States House elections, 2008}}
After Reynolds announced his retirement from Congress in 2008, Davis ran a third time for the seat. He began as the odds-on favorite to win the Democratic Party nomination&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; but he faced stiff competition from Iraq War veteran and teacher [[Jon Powers]]. Democrats viewed Powers as their strongest candidate, and blamed Davis' attack ads for taking him out in the primary.&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; Powers finished second, Davis third, with little-known environmental attorney Alice Kryzan winning the primary. She lost the general election to Republican [[Chris Lee (New York politician)|Christopher J. Lee]] 55–40 percent.&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt;

===Davis v. Federal Election Commission===
{{Main article|Davis v. Federal Election Commission}}
Davis filed a [[Davis v. Federal Election Commission|successful lawsuit]] against the Federal Election Commission between his 2006 and 2008 runs for office, claiming that the so-called "millionaires amendment" to the [[Bipartisan Campaign Reform Act|McCain-Feingold Act]] election reform law was unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court, with [[Samuel Alito|Justice Alito]] writing for the 5–4 majority, struck down parts of the act as violating the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] for fundamentally restricting the right of a self-financing candidate to spend his or her own money in a preferred way.&lt;ref name="oyez"/&gt;

===2011 Congressional campaign===
{{See also|New York's 26th congressional district special election, 2011}}
Davis changed his political affiliation from Democratic back to Republican in 2010, after developing a favorable working relationship with Chris Lee over the course of Lee's time in office.&lt;ref name="looking for"/&gt;&lt;ref name="loss of lee"/&gt; He expressed interest in the [[special election]] to replace Lee, who resigned in February 2011.&lt;ref name="republicans search"/&gt; Davis met with the Republican chairs regarding a possible run, but according to Davis, the meeting "didn't go great". The Party was dissatisfied with his brief time in the Democratic Party and his willingness to run on a third-party line if he didn't get the Republican nomination, according to the ''Lockport Union-Sun &amp; Journal''.&lt;ref name="eight republicans"/&gt; A GOP county chair told ''The Buffalo News'' that Davis had disqualified himself by expressing views that were contrary to typical Republican positions.&lt;ref name="comments shock"/&gt; The Republican nomination went to [[Jane Corwin]].&lt;ref name="gets nod"/&gt; Davis also had discussions with Erie County [[Conservative Party of New York State|Conservative Party]] chairman Ralph Lorigo regarding a potential run on that line,&lt;ref name="hopefuls are"/&gt; but after Corwin received Republican nomination, the other two parties put her on their ballot lines.

Finally, Davis briefly, but unsuccessfully courted the Democrats for their nomination, then decided to run on a newly created independent line, under the name "Tea," sending out paid campaign workers to collect the 3,500 required signatures for a ballot listing (Davis's campaign workers collected over 12,000 signatures in total).&lt;ref name="spurned"/&gt; He received the endorsement of the Tea Party Coalition of New York, but his Republican opponent Corwin got the endorsements of TEA New York&lt;ref name="coalition backs"/&gt; and the Tea Party Express. Davis has said that if elected, he will caucus with the Republicans and Tea Party caucus because his opinions and positions align more closely with those groups than with the Democrats.&lt;ref name="would caucus"/&gt; The Tea Party Coalition is an organization run by Libertarian Party activists James Ostrowski and Allen Coniglio, who use the name "Tea Party" for the ballot line on which they run their independent candidates; Ostrowski and Coniglio previously had used the line for David DiPietro in a state senate race and Janice Volk in a [[New York's 29th congressional district elections, 2010|congressional special election in another district]] prior to Davis using the line.

====Political positions====
Davis' ideology is "too inconsistent to be readily categorized", according to the ''Washington Post''.&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; When asked about the issue of illegal immigration during his interview for the Republican endorsement in 2011, Davis reportedly shocked local Republican leaders by suggesting that illegal immigrants could be deported and unemployed black youth bussed from the cities to pick the crops.&lt;ref name="comments shock"/&gt; Davis' spokesperson said the comments could be viewed as politically and racially incorrect; "but when you have African American people in Buffalo who do not have jobs and are out of work, why are you bringing people into this country illegally to take jobs?" he asked.&lt;ref name="comments shock"/&gt;

Davis' main issue is his opposition to free-trade policies and agreements which he believes have allowed low-wage nations, such as the [[People's Republic of China]], to compete unfairly with American-produced manufactured goods and agricultural crops.

Davis been described as favoring gun rights,&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; and has said that his position on the Second Amendment rights is similar to that of other members of the Tea Party movement.&lt;ref name="weigel1"/&gt; He has given inconsistent answers on the issue of abortion rights.&lt;ref name="who is"/&gt; Davis opposes the [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackdavis.org/2011/05/press-release-jack-davis-endorses-healthcare-compact/ PRESS RELEASE: JACK DAVIS ENDORSES HEALTHCARE COMPACT] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518174750/http://www.jackdavis.org/2011/05/press-release-jack-davis-endorses-healthcare-compact/ |date=May 18, 2011 }}.

====Campaign====
The special election was initially thought to be a "certain victory" for the Republican candidate, but became "fiercely competitive", according to ''The New York Times'', because of a U.S. House Republican plan to [[privatize]] [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].&lt;ref name="hoping third"/&gt; The Times also cited the third party candidacy of Davis as a factor which is "siphoning support" from Corwin.&lt;ref name="hoping third"/&gt;

A late April poll by Sienna College had Corwin in the lead with 36 percent, followed by Hochul with 31 percent and Davis with 23 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="real race"/&gt; An early May poll by the Democratic-leaning Public Policy Institute showed Hochul at 35 percent, Corwin at 31 percent and Davis at 24 percent.&lt;ref name="fresh aim"/&gt; An unusual number of voters had a negative opinion of each candidate, according to the pollster: Hochul, 42 percent for Corwin and 43 percent for Davis.&lt;ref name="how can"/&gt;

National media attention was given to a 15-second video clip that appeared to show Corwin's Assembly chief of staff, Michael Mallia, repeatedly asking Davis why he had skipped a campaign debate, followed by Mallia yelping as Davis apparently shoved him or flapped at the camera.&lt;ref name="republicans join"/&gt;&lt;ref name="stirs up controversy"/&gt; The video clip was circulated by local and national Republican organizations&lt;ref name="tracker tape"/&gt; and prompted bipartisan criticism of both Davis and Mallia.&lt;ref name="republicans join"/&gt; Requests to see a longer tape and a tape made by second camera were refused by Corwin and her campaign.&lt;ref name="stirs up controversy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dodges"/&gt; In response to Davis' complaints that he had been harassed, Corwin said, "I've had cameras on me for two months now, and I've never hit anybody ... and I think that's the difference is how you handle a situation like that."&lt;ref name="tracker tape"/&gt;

The [[Tea Party Express]] and TEA New York which endorsed Corwin traveled to Rochester and Buffalo to hold events where they criticized Davis' use of the Tea Party name.&lt;ref name="TEA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="express backs"/&gt; After the election, TEA New York blamed Davis for Hochul's win.&lt;ref&gt;TEANY press release (May 25, 2011).

''Roll Call'' reported that Davis had promised to spend as much as $3 million of his own funds and that Corwin had invested nearly $2.5 million of her own funds in the campaign as of May 13.&lt;ref name="campaign loans"/&gt; ''Roll Call'' also said that outside funds coming from both liberal and conservative groups had "turned the Buffalo and Rochester airwaves into a steady stream of campaign ads."&lt;ref name="campaign loans"/&gt; Davis, in contrast to his opponents, received no assistance from outside funds.&lt;ref&gt;Vielkind, Jimmy (May 23, 2011).

'''Jamsrangiin Tseveen''' ({{lang-mn|Жамсрангийн Цэвээн}}; {{lang-ru|'''Tsyben Zhamtsaranovich Zhamtsarano'''}}; often romanized to '''Jamtsarano'''), (1880 - May 14, 1942) was a [[Buryats|Buryat]] scholar and one of the leading figures in [[Mongolia]]n politics and especially academia in the 1920s.

==Early life==

Tseveen was born in the [[Aginsk]] district of [[Transbaikalia]] in 1880. He went to school in [[Chita, Zabaykalsky Krai|Chita]] and later to Badmaev's Buryat private school in [[St. Petersburg]]. From 1898 to 1902, he attended the Teacher's seminary in [[Irkutsk]], where he began to visit neighbouring Buryat clans and to collect epics and materials related to shamanism, and Mongol law.

==Scientific career==

In 1902 he and his friend Baradin returned to St. Petersburg and became auditors at the St. Petersburg University. A professor arranged for them to travel to Buryatia in 1903 to collect more material. Tseveen went to the northwest Baikal area and [[Olkhon]] island, and his work proved successful enough to earn him more research trips over the next years, sponsored by the Russian Committee for the Investigation of Central and Eastern Asia. In 1904 he travelled to [[Ulan Bator|Urga]] and home to Aginsk, in 1905 and 1906 he again travelled to Transbaikalia and [[Mongolia|Outer Mongolia]]. From 1907 to 1908 he taught Mongolian at the St. Petersburg University's Faculty of Oriental Languages. In 1909 and 1910 travelled to [[Inner Mongolia]] and the [[Ordos Loop|Ordos]] area. In 1911, he travelled to the [[Tungusic peoples|Tungus]] at the upper [[Onon River|Onon]] river, and in 1912 he took part in archeological studies at [[Erdene Zuu monastery|Erdene Zuu]], the former site of [[Karakorum]].

==In the [[Bogd Khaanate Mongolia]] ==

After Mongolia had declared independence in 1911, [[Russia]] had sent a special envoy to Urga, [[Ivan Yakovlevich Korostovets]]. Korostovets planned the creation of a newspaper and the establishment of a secular school under Russian sponsorship, and offered Tseveen to edit the newspaper and supervise the school, both of which Tseveen accepted. In the following years, besides the work at school and the ''Shine toli'' ('New Mirror') and ''Niislel Khüreenii sonin bichig'' newspapers, he continued academic work and also translated some popular texts into [[Mongolian language|Mongolian]].

==In the [[Mongolian People's Republic]] ==

After Outer Mongolia had been occupied by [[Republic of China|Chinese]] troops in 1919, Tseveen became a professor at the Irkutsk University. He published articles on Mongolian law, but also travelled around [[Ulan-Ude|Verkhneudinsk]], [[Kyakhta]] and [[Altanbulag, Selenge|Maimaichen]], where he met with discontented Outer Mongolians. At the founding congress of the [[Mongolian People's Party|Mongolian People's Revolutionary Party]] in 1921, Tseveen got the task of writing the Ten Aspirations, the party's platform. After Urga had been liberated from [[Roman Ungern von Sternberg|Baron Ungern]]'s troops in the same year, Tseveen founded the Institute of Scriptures and Manuscripts (''Sudar Bichgiyn Hüreelen''), forerunner of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences. A library was established, and in 1924 a museum was opened. In 1925 he travelled to Leningrad, and in 1926 he married Badmajab Tsedenovna, who was also a Buryat from Aginsk. In the same year, both travelled to [[Beijing|Beiping]]. His wife travelled to [[Germany]] and [[France]] in 1927 as part of an official mission, but Tseveen remained in Ulaanbaatar.

==Exile and death==

In 1932, Tseveen was dismissed and exiled to Leningrad, where he again worked at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the University under Prof. [[Nicholas Poppe]] and edited the milestone ''Mongol chronicles of the XVIIth century''. He was arrested in 1937, convicted to five years imprisonment on February 19, 1940, and died on May 14, 1942 in [[Sol-Iletsk]] prison ([[Orenburg]]). Details were released by the Russian government in 1993.

==Trivia==

One of his many interests was research into cryptozoological organisms like the [[Yeti]] or the [[Mongolian Death Worm]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2933">'''Jean d'Espagnet''' (1564 – c. 1637) was a French [[The Renaissance|Renaissance]] [[polymath]]. He was a lawyer and politician, a mathematician and [[Alchemy|alchemist]], an [[antiquarian]], poet and friend of French literati.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willard|first1=Thomas|editor1-last=Debus|editor1-first=Allen G.|editor2-last=Walton|editor2-first=Michael T.|title="The Many Worlds of Jean D’Espagnet" in Reading the Book of Nature: The Other Side of the Scientific Revolution, Sixteenth Century Essays and Studies, volume 41|date=1998|publisher=Thomas Jefferson Press at Truman State University|isbn=9780940474475|page=202|url=https://www.academia.edu/1561808/_The_Many_Worlds_of_Jean_dEspagnet_|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

D'Espagnet was a counsellor in the [[Parlement]] of [[Bordeaux]] and its president from the years 1600 to 1611.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titi Lucretii Cari De rerum natura libri sex (Montaigne.1.4.4)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/1|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=9 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this position he was involved, with [[Pierre de Lancre]], in [[witch-hunting]] in [[Labourd]]. D'Espagnet contributed to de Lancre's 1607 work on witchcraft.

His son [[Étienne d'Espagnet]] utilised his father's library and designed optics for astronomy.

Jean D'Espagnet is known to have owned several books that had previously formed part of [[Michel de Montaigne|Montaigne's]] library, including his copy of [[De rerum natura]], in which his signature overwrites that of Montaigne's on the title-page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Titi Lucretii Cari De rerum natura libri sex (Montaigne.1.4.4)|url=http://cudl.lib.cam.ac.uk/view/PR-MONTAIGNE-00001-00004-00004/9|publisher=Cambridge Digital Library|accessdate=9 July 2015|page=[i]/image 9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1623 D'Espagnet wrote ''Arcanum Hermeticae philosophiae'' and ''Enchiridion physicae restitutae''.&lt;ref&gt;Written in Latin; D'Espagnet is occasionally called Spagnetus. The publication was anonymous. The attribution dates back to the middle of the seventeenth century.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5292">'''John Richards''' (died April 2, 1694)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CWUUAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA143&amp;dq=John+Richards+speaker&amp;lr= |title=History of the Military Company of the Massachusetts, Now Called, the ... |page=143 |website=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2017-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Massachusetts Bay Colony|colonial]] military officer, businessman, politician, and magistrate, best known for his participation in the [[Salem witch trials]] in 1692.

==Life==
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2015}}
John Richards was born in [[England]], and traveled with his parents in 1630 to North America as part of the [[Puritan migration to New England (1620–1640)|first major wave of migration]] to the [[Massachusetts Bay Colony]]. In 1644 Ricards was enrolled in the [[Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company]], which he would remain involved with for the rest of his life. A resident of [[Dorchester, Massachusetts|Dorchester]] for most of his life, he operated a mill, and frequently served as on the colony's general court (as its assembly was known). 

The colony did not have a residency requirement, and he usually represented communities (such as [[Hadley, Massachusetts|Hadley]] that were distant from [[Boston]], where the assembly met. In 1679 and 1680, however, he was chosen to represent Boston, and was elected speaker in 1680. From 1680-84 he served as one of the colony's assistants, whose council served as the upper body of the assembly and as the colony's highest court.

In 1681 Richards was appointed along with [[Joseph Dudley]] to represent the colony in [[London]] in an attempt to address royal concerns over the colony's administration. King [[Charles II of England|Charles II]] had, upon his restoration, insisted that the colony exhibit more religious tolerance and adhere more closely to the [[Navigation Acts]], both of which the colony's hardline administration had resisted doing.  Richards and Dudley were unsuccessful in their negotiations with the Lords of Trade, because the colonial government had specifically denied them authority to agree to changes in the colonial charter. Richards was of the opinion that the colonial government should acquiesce to the crown demands, and was consequently voted from office in 1684. That year, the colonial charter was revoked.

In 1686 the [[Dominion of New England]] was established, with Joseph Dudley as its first governor, and Sir [[Edmund Andros]] as its second.  He served as a judge under Dudley's brief administration, but was apparently opposed to Andros' unpopular rule, in which he played no part.  The dominion was overturned in 1689 when [[1689 Boston revolt|Andros and Dudley were arrested]] in the wake of the [[Glorious Revolution]].  The old colonial administration was restored, and Richards was once again made an assistant.

==Witch trials==
{{onesource|section|date=June 2015}}
In 1692 Sir [[William Phips]] arrived in the colony bearing the new charter for the [[Province of Massachusetts Bay]], and a commission as governor. Phips' arrival occurred during the height of a [[witchcraft]] scare in the [[Salem, Massachusetts|Salem]] area of [[Essex County, Massachusetts|Essex County]]. Phips created a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer, to which Richards was appointed.&lt;ref&gt;Massachusetts Archives Collections, Governor's Council Executive Records, Vol. 2, 1692, pages 176–177. Certified copy from the original records at Her Majestie's State Paper Office, London, September 16, 1846.&lt;/ref&gt; This court oversaw the conviction and execution of nineteen individuals in the infamous [[Salem witch trials]].

When the [[Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature|Superior Court of Judicature]] was formed as the province's high court, Richards was also appointed to it.&lt;ref&gt;Records of the Massachusetts Supreme Court of Judicature, 1692/3, Page 1. Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court, Judicial Archives&lt;/ref&gt; This court disposed of a great many more witchcraft cases, acquitting many; its witchcraft-related convictions in 1693 were vacated by Governor Phips.

==Death==
{{unsourced|section|date=June 2015}}
He died, reportedly from a fit of [[apoplexy]], in Boston on April 2, 1694. He had married Ann Winthrop, the widowed daughter-in-law of founder [[John Winthrop]]; they had no children.

'''Kantarawadi''' ({{lang-my|ကန္နရဝတီ}})({{lang-th|กันตรวดี}}), also known as '''Gantarawadi''',&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt; was one of the [[Karenni States]] in what is today [[Kayah State]] in [[Burma]]. It was also known as "Eastern Karenni" owing to the location of part of its territory east of the [[Salween River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.karennihomeland.com/ArticleArticle.php?ContentID=44|title=Highlights in Karenni History to 1948|author=Khu Oo Reh|date=October 2006|accessdate=19 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
According to local tradition in the early times of the Karenni states there was a principality led by a  ''"[[Saopha|Sawphya]]"'' that was under the overlordship of a [[Shan people|Shan]] prince. This state finally became independent in the 18th century. In the 19th century the Karenni state was divided into five principalities ''(sawphyas)''.

In 1864 a Karenni prince requested the status of [[British protectorate]] for his state, but the British authorities did not show any interest. After the death of this prince in 1869 his two sons renewed the petition claiming that they feared Burmese ambitions on their state. 
The British refused again, but agreed to arbitrate before the [[King of Burma]]. Since the [[Konbaung Dynasty|Burmese monarchy]] insisted in their demands on the Karenni territories, the British granted recognition to four states, Kyebogyi, Namekan (Nammekon), Naungpale and Bawlake, which became independent under British protection on 21 June 1875. Kantarawadi state, however, remained independent without official protection. Kantarawadi was heavily fined in 1888 for the disturbances caused by Myoza Sao Law Paw (Sawlapaw).&lt;ref name="FOEI"/&gt; After his successor Sao Lawi agreed to pay a tribure of [[Rupee|Rs]] 5,000 to the British government, he was granted the title of ''Saopha''.&lt;ref name="IGI"&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V15_042.gif Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 15, p. 36.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In November the same year the government of [[Siam]] tried to establish its territorial rights over the eastern tract of land in Kantarawadi. Following the expedition against the Red Karens in the Karenni area the [[Anglo-Siamese Boundary Commission]] of 1892-93 would be set up in order to resolve the disputes about the territory the Siamese had occupied on the eastern side of the Salween as well as the Trans-Salween territories that had been handed over to the Saopha of [[Mong Pan State]] to which Siam also laid claim.&lt;ref name="FOEI"&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/frontieroverseas05indi/frontieroverseas05indi_djvu.txt "Frontier and overseas expeditions from India"]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1942, the [[Imperial Japanese Army]] accompanied by the Thai [[Phayap Army]] invaded the Federated Shan States from Thailand. The defense of the Shan States had been left to the Nationalist Chinese forces, upon the request of the British. The 93rd Division of the Chinese Army defended the Keng Tung, while the 249th and 55th Divisions guarded from the Kengtung to Karenni States along the Thai border. The Japanese forces with superior air power went on to dislodge the Nationalist Chinese forces by November 1942.&lt;ref name=sat-195-196&gt;Aung Tun 2009: 195–196&lt;/ref&gt; The IJA allowed the Phayap Army to occupy all of Kengtung State and the four trans-[[Salween]] districts of Möng Tang, Möng Hang, Möng Kyawt and Möng Hta of [[Mongpan State]]. Following the existing agreement between Thai Prime Minister [[Plaek Phibunsongkhram]] (Phibun) and the [[Japanese Empire]], on 18 August 1943, the Japanese government agreed to the Thai annexation of Kengtung and part of Mongpan state (as well as the annexation of Kelantan, Trengganu, Kedah, Perlis states and nearby islands in Malaya.)&lt;ref name=sat-202&gt;Aung Tun 2009: 202&lt;/ref&gt; The Thai government wanted the two districts of Möngmaü and Mehsakun of [[Mawkmai State|Mawkmai]] of the southern Shan states as well as part of Kantarawadi, all located east of the Salween River, but the Japanese assigned them to their client [[State of Burma]] in September 1943.&lt;ref name=sat-203-206&gt;Aung Tun 2009: 203–204, 205–206&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the defeat and surrender of the [[Japanese Empire]], Thailand left the territories it had annexed to the north in 1945. However, the Thai government officially relinquished its claim over Kantarawadi State only in 1946 as part of the condition for admission to the [[United Nations]] and the withdrawal of all wartime sanctions for having sided with the [[Axis powers]].&lt;ref&gt;David Porter Chandler &amp; David Joel Steinberg eds.

'''''Lock-Up''''' is an American [[crime drama]] series that premiered in [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] in September 1959 and concluded in June 1961. The half-hour episodes had little time for character development or subplots and presented a compact story without embellishment.

==Series overview==
The program stars [[Macdonald Carey]] as real-life [[Philadelphia]] corporate attorney Herbert L. Maris and [[John Doucette]] as police detective Lieutenant Jim Weston.

Each episode began with the following introduction: "These stories are based on the files and case histories of Herbert L. Maris, prominent attorney, who has devoted his life to saving the innocent."

The foundation of each episode is the cornerstone of English and American jurisprudence: a person charged with a crime is [[Presumption of innocence|innocent until proven guilty]] in a court of law. The series featured stories persons who were unjustly accused, usually due to [[circumstantial evidence]]. The program's primary theme is that when individuals are charged with a crime not all is as it first appears and a thorough investigation is duly warranted in order to uncover vital facts pertinent to the case.

Herbert L. Maris had an uncanny sense about the honest, innocent persons who had been falsely accused. He was an attorney who spent his spare time helping defendants unjustly charged by the [[State (U.S.)|
State]]. The stories do not involve federal crimes.

'''Louis Henry Scipion, Count Durore''' (1763–1822) was a French revolutionary and English radical.

==Background==
Duroure was born in Marseilles on 26 February 1763. Louis Alexandre, Count Duroure, an Anglo-French soldier, claimed to be his father. Duroure also claimed that his mother was Hon. Henrietta Child, widow of Hon Josiah Child, younger brother of [[John Tylney, 2nd Earl Tylney]], of [[Wanstead House]], and daughter of Robert Knight, Lord Luxborough and later Earl of Catherlough. Mrs. Child had died three days after the child's birth and Duroure returned to Lord Luxborough's house in London with the child, and Mrs. Child's body in a coffin, claiming that they had been married and that the child was theirs. Lord Luxborough (who had known nothing of his daughter's pregnancy) took them in and presented the child to the world as the legitimate child of his daughter's marriage to Duroure.&lt;ref&gt;Horace Walpole's letters&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upbringing==
Duroure was bi-lingual, so it appears that he was educated both in France and England. He later claimed to have studied at [[Oxford University|Oxford]]. His reputed grandfather, Lord Catherlough, died in 1772, leaving his property to his illegitimate children. Duroure was to have the income on £3000 at his majority. When his half-brother, Josiah Child, died in 1775, Duroure's guardians claimed Mrs. Child's fortune for him. They seem to have been unsuccessful in establishing their claim, for Lord Bolingbroke (the next heir) took possession of the two houses in [[Park Lane, London|Park Lane]] and [[Albemarle Street]] that had belonged to Mrs Child. In 1780, Duroure's guardians purchased a commission for him in the Royal [[Horse Guards Regiment|Horseguards Blue]].

==Arrest and English Imprisonment==
As a lieutenant in the Horseguards, Duroure was said to have caused "much notice about town."  Then, in 1784, he attempted to elope to France with the wife of a lawyer of his acquaintance. They were unable to gain a passage and were finally tracked down by the lady's husband to a ''bagnio'' in [[Leicester Fields]]. A pistol was fired at the lawyer as he tried to gain admittance and Duroure was brought to trial at the [[Old Bailey]]. His lawyer [[Thomas Erskine, 1st Baron Erskine|Thomas Erskine]] (later Lord Chancellor) got him off on a technicality but the next day he was arrested for debt.&lt;ref&gt;Annual Register 1784, pp. 90, 96,97,103&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in [[Newgate Prison|Newgate Gaol]] until September 1789.

==Revolutionary career==
The day after his release, Duroure gained access to his mother's Park Lane house &amp;mdash; which Lord Bolingbroke had already sold to a Mr. Jones &amp;mdash; and lived there for the next two years. When his claim was finally brought before Lord Chief Justice Kenyon at the Surrey Assizes in June 1791, it was ruled that he was barred from inheriting his mother's property because he had been born abroad of a foreign father. Despite the ruling, he seems to have remained well off. Soon after this, he left for Paris where he was active in the section Faubourg Montmartre. At the end of October 1792, as Scipion Duroure, he was elected to represent his section on the General Council of the [[Paris Commune (French Revolution)|Paris Commune]], where he had responsibility for the royal family in the Temple Prison. He was a witness to the last testament of Louis XVI. He was elected a Vice President of the Commune and in February 1793 was further elected First Commissioner of Finance. At the end of May 1793, he was one of the members of the Revolutionary Council that made its headquarters in the Archbishop's Palace and demanded the arrest of the [[Girondin]] leaders in the Convention. He was appointed to interrogate Roland, but Roland managed to escape. He was a close colleague and friend of Rene Hebert &amp;mdash; standing sponsor at the lay baptism of Hebert's daughter &amp;mdash; which made him vulnerable when Hebert and [[Robespierre]] fell out. [[Fabre d’Eglantine]]’s revelation of a ‘foreign plot’ in October 1793 was aimed at men liked Duroure. In early March 1794 he and his colleagues from the Section Mont-Marat (so renamed after Marat's murder) marched on the Convention to demand food for the people of Paris, but he found himself denounced, arrested and sent to the Saint-Lazare prison with the other [[Hébertists]]. It is not clear how he escaped execution. In September 1794, after the end of the Terror, he was released.&lt;ref&gt;Roman d'Amat (ed) Dictionnaire de Biographie Française, vol XII, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. Salvin; The Hébertists to the Guillotine. Anatomy of a "Conspiracy" in Revolutionary France, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

==Last Years of the Revolution==
Duroure seems to have returned to England for a brief while, though d'Amat says that he was serving as a town councillor in Avignon in 1795-6. During the Directory's attack on royalists and Jacobins in September 1797, he was again arrested. After his release, he continued to involve himself with revolutionary politics. During the brief Jacobin revival of the summer of 1799, he was a member of the ''Réunion d'amis de l'égalité et de la liberté'', which had its headquarters in the ''Salle du Manège'' of the [[Tuileries]], and was thus known as the ''Club du Manège''. However, with Bonaparte's ''coup d'etat'' of December 1799, Duroure was among those proscribed as a "dangerous agitator" and condemned to deportation to Guyana. There is no record of his arrest. He seems to have fled to England, where he spent the rest of his life.

==Later career==
By now Duroure seems to have lost much of his fortune. He settled in London and was linked to the world of radical publishing through Sir Richard Phillips. He was an admirer of Cobbett's ''Grammar of the English Language'', which he translated into French. He also translated Phillips' work on the English jury system as ''Des pouvoirs et des obligations des jurys''. According to Francois-Xavier de Feller in his ''Biographie Universelle'', Duroure was also working on an edition of the philosophical works of his great uncle, the 1st Lord Bolingbroke, and on the family letters of his grandmother, Lady Luxborough, but nothing appeared. He died in Arundel Street, London on 24 September 1822. Michaud in his ''Biographie Universelle'' says that his illegitimate son died on the same day and that it was thought that they had been poisoned. He was buried with his reputed mother (Mrs Child, otherwise Countess Duroure) at Ullenhall in Warwickshire after a funeral which was "ridiculously grand, the hearse all covered with coats-of-arms, not much to the satisfaction of the family, who doubted his really being the Countess' son"&lt;ref&gt;Family notes in the Raleigh King family, the illegitimate descendants of Lord Catherlough&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mary (née Perkins) Bradbury''' (baptized September 3, 1615{{spaced ndash}}December 20, 1700) was tried, convicted and sentenced to [[hanging|hang]] as a [[witch]] in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] in 1692. However, she managed to evade sentence until the trials had been discredited, and died in 1700, aged 85.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Salem Witch Trials 1692|url=http://www.mayflowerfamilies.com/Salem%20Witches/salem_witch_trials.htm|accessdate=2008-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Mary Perkins was daughter of John and Judith (née Gater) Perkins, baptized in 1615, at [[Warwickshire]], England. Her family immigrated to America in 1631, sailing on the "Lyon" from [[Bristol]]. In 1636 she married Thomas Bradbury of [[Salisbury, Massachusetts]], considered one of its most distinguished citizens, land agent for his great-uncle [[Ferdinando Gorges]] and son of Elizabeth Whitgift, whose uncle [[John Whitgift]] was [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] under [[Elizabeth I|Elizabeth]] and [[James VI and I|James I]]. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

==Witch trials==
{{main|Salem witch trials}}
In the notorious witch trials of 1692, Mary Bradbury was indicted for (among other charges):
&lt;blockquote&gt;Certaine Detestable arts called Witchcraft &amp; Sorceries Wickedly Mallitiously and felloniously hath used practiced and Exercised At and in the Township of Andivor in the County of Essex aforesaid in upon &amp; against one Timothy Swann of Andivor In the County aforesaid Husbandman – by which said Wicked Acts the said Timothy Swann upon the 26th day of July Aforesaid and divers other days &amp; times both before and after was and is Tortured Afflicted Consumed Pined Wasted and Tormented..&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Witnesses testified that she assumed animal forms; her most unusual metamorphosis was said to have been that of a blue boar. Another allegation was that she cast spells upon ships. Over a hundred of her neighbors and townspeople testified on her behalf, but to no avail and she was found guilty of practicing magic and sentenced to be executed. Through the ongoing efforts of her friends, her execution was delayed. After the witch debacle had passed, she was released. By some accounts she was allowed to escape. Others claim she bribed her jailer. Another account claims that her husband bribed the jailer and took her away to Maine in a horse and cart. They returned to Massachusetts after the witch hysteria had died down. Mary Bradbury died of natural causes in her own bed in 1700, aged 85. {{citation needed|date=December 2014}}

Her family friend, and her son-in-law's father, Major Robert Pike, was in command of all the forces of [[Norfolk County, Massachusetts|Norfolk County, Massachusetts Bay Colony]] and those located in present-day [[Maine]]. As early as 1650 he was what would now be called a trial justice and in 1672 an associate judge of the courts of Norfolk Co. In political life a member of the [[Massachusetts General Court|General Court]] when 32 and of the [[Colonial government in the Thirteen Colonies#The Council|Governor's Council]] from 1682–96, when having reached the age of 50 years he retired to the private life of the farm.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Posthumous==
In 1711, the governor and council of Massachusetts authorized payment of £578.12s to the claimants representing twenty-three persons condemned at Salem, and the heirs of Mary Bradbury received £20. A petition to reverse the attainder of twenty-two of the thirty-one citizens convicted and condemned as a result of the trials was passed by the Massachusetts General Court in 1711. In 1957, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts reversed the stigma placed on all those not covered by earlier orders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-salemname?name=Mary+Bradbury&amp;query=bramar The Salem Witchcraft Papers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050408202331/http://etext.virginia.edu/etcbin/ot2www-salemname?name=Mary+Bradbury&amp;query=bramar |date=2005-04-08 }}, etext.virginia.edu; accessed December 25, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

He has lived for many years in [[San Francisco, California]].  He is of [[Kainai Nation|Kainai]] (Blackfoot/Blood),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.queerculturalcenter.org/Pages/QFest09/Exile.html "Exile: Vision Quest at the Edge of Identity."] ''Queer Cultural Center.'' Retrieved 4 Aug 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sephardic|Sephardic Jewish]] ([[Converso]]), and Northern European descent.

Valerio's 2006 memoir ''The Testosterone Files'' is one of his most prominent pieces of writing. It describes his transition and experiences as a [[trans man]]. He also writes and performs poetry, and has acted in films and appeared in many documentaries.

==Early life==

Valerio's mother is of [[Blackfoot]] descent, specifically from the [[Kainai]] in [[Alberta]], Canada. His father's family can be traced back to 1694 with the De Vargas expedition and 1598 with the Onate expedition, making their way into what is now Northern [[New Mexico]]. Valerio's father identifies as Spanish and his ancestry can be connected to Sephardic Jewish roots from Spain, Portugal and Italy. The Valerio family can be traced from Spain and then migrated to Italy during the Spanish Inquisition. They were [[conversos]] and eventually migrated to [[New Spain]]. Growing up Valerio had fair skin, light eyes and light hair and was often confused for [[Russians|Russian]], half-Chinese, [[Hungarians|Hungarian]] or as a white [[Americans|American]].&lt;ref name="cryptojews.com"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Valerio |first=Max |title=Emerging Fragments |work=Halapid |publisher=Society for Crypto-Judaic Studies |date=Spring 2000 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=4–5 |url=http://cryptojews.com/scripts/pdffiles/documents/Volume_VIII_Spring_2000_Issue_2.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Valerio's father was in the [[United States Army]] for 20 years, which caused them to move frequently in the United States and Europe. Max was born in a US Army hospital in [[Heidelberg]], [[Germany]]. Valerio lived in many US states including Maryland, Washington, California, Kansas, Oklahoma, and Colorado, as well as in Canada, and again in Germany as a child and teenager.&lt;ref&gt;Valerio, Max, ''[[The Testosterone Files: My Hormonal and Social Transformation from Female to Male]]'' (Seal Press, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

Growing up Valerio had a hard time relating to girls. He felt that he did not fit in because of his masculine nature and at times would offer to play male roles but it would not approved by the female counterparts that he was attempting to play with. He decided to identify himself as a [[lesbian]] as a teen because it made the most sense to him at the time. Valerio imagined himself as a boy when growing up and could not imagine himself growing into a woman. He felt he was always male and identified with male children/adults. Valerio would cry himself to sleep as a child wishing to be a boy. Valerio went to college and came out as a lesbian feminist in 1975. Valerio could not relate to lesbian sex. Valerio started to feel more male and a male gender identity started to come back from childhood.&lt;ref name="Max W. Valerio 1992"/&gt;

In 1988, after discussions with a friend and roommate who was formally transitioning from male to female, Valerio realized that he was transsexual and began considering a sex change.&lt;ref name="Max W. Valerio 1992"/&gt; Max found the FMT Organization in San Francisco run by Lou Sullivan and started attending meetings. Valerio was amazed by the other female to male transsexuals/transgender people and realized that it could be done. Like an "explosion" in his mind Max Valerio had realized he was not a lesbian but a transsexual man.&lt;ref name="Max W. Valerio 1992"/&gt;

==Transition==

Valerio [[transitioning (transgender)|transitioned]] in 1989 from female to male. Valerio's initial exposure to transsexual information were two pieces that have been considered by LGBTQ groups as being exceptionally trans-phobic. The first book Valerio picked up was ''Female-to-Male Transsexualism'' by Leslie Lothstein. Valerio says in ''The Testosterone Files'' that "Lothstein's book is damning" and that he "paints the transsexual men he is working with as psychopathic, borderline, fractured, pathetic".&lt;ref name=TTF /&gt; Valerio also says that Lothstein's book says that Lothstein "feels that most of the men are mistaken in asking for sex reassignment".&lt;ref name=TTF /&gt; The second resource Valerio picked up was Janice Raymond's book, ''[[The Transsexual Empire]]''. Valerio states that "Raymond postulated that all transsexuals were dupes of the patriarchy, "mutilating" their bodies in order to live out stereotyped sex roles instead of changing those roles through rigorously applied program of radical feminism".&lt;ref name=TTF /&gt;

Valerio talks about his first steps of transitioning in the movie "MAX with Max W. Valerio",&lt;ref name="Max W. Valerio 1992"&gt;''Max with Max W. Valerio''. Dir. Monika Trout. Perf. Max Valerio. First Run Features, 1992. Transcript.&lt;/ref&gt; a short documentary style film by Monika Treut. Max goes into deeper depth about the testosterone side of transitioning and early steps in his book ''The Testosterone Files''. He also appears in ''Gendernauts'', another film by Monika Treut.

Max then talks about the process in declaring transsexualism to a psychologist or counselor so one may obtain the female to male transitioning hormone: testosterone.&lt;ref name="Max W. Valerio 1992"/&gt;  Sometimes called "T" in the FTM scene.

What Max went through was a visit to a counselor for three months.  That counselor then decides if the patient is "sincere and that [they] probably are transsexual".&lt;ref name="Max W. Valerio 1992"/&gt;  The counselor then writes a letter so that the patient may obtain testosterone to start the transition from female to male.  The standard dosage of testosterone is one injection every two weeks inter-muscularly. That is what Max Valerio did in early stages of transitioning.&lt;ref name="Max W. Valerio 1992"/&gt;

Valerio went to an Endocrinologist to obtain the hormones with the letter from the counselor.

Testosterone is a male sex hormone used in female to male gender reassignment.  In women, the ovaries and adrenal glands produce testosterone naturally but at about one tenth the amount the typical male would produce.&lt;ref name=LiveScience&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rettner|first1=Rachel|title=What is Testosterone?|url=http://www.livescience.com/38963-testosterone.html|website=LiveScience}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The hormone plays a role in the development of the sex drive, sperm production, fat distribution, red cell production and the maintenance of muscle mass and muscle strength.&lt;ref name="LiveScience"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
FTM transexxuals report an increase of sex drive because of the testosterone as Max goes into detail in his book The Testosterone Files&lt;ref name=TTF&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valerio|first1=Max|title=The Testosterone Files|date=2006|publisher=Seal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical effects of HRT or Hormone Replacement Therapy using testosterone are: loss of menstruation, deepening of the voice, hair growth both facially and body hair growth, the face taking on more masculine aspects, increase in muscle mass the clitoris enlarging, male pattern baldness could occur if in the genes as well acne.&lt;ref name="Trans 101"&gt;{{cite web|title=Transgender 101|url=http://openmindedhealth.com/transgender-101-trans-people/#ftm|website=Open Minded Health}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Valerio experienced most of these effects, excluding the baldness. Valerio experienced less hair growth but he attributes this to being half Blackfoot.&lt;ref name="TTF" /&gt;

The main form of testosterone given is inter-muscular injections every two to three weeks of synthetic testosterone. There is also a way of injecting testosterone subcutaneously, just under the skin. There are also creams, gels sprays, under-arm applications, patches and many more.&lt;ref name="LiveScience" /&gt;  Valerio used the common way of inter-muscular injections.&lt;ref name="TTF" /&gt;

==''The Testosterone Files''==
Valerio’s memoir ''The Testosterone Files''  describes the psychological, physiological, and social transformation that occurred in the first five years of his transition from female to male.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Max Valerio, ''The Testosterone Files: My Hormonal and Social Transformation from Female to Male'' (Seal Press, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; One of the main themes of the book is role of testosterone in his transition. This is because Valerio credits [[testosterone (medication)|testosterone]] as the most definitive and crucial aspect of his transformation.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The book is organized into three parts: "Beginning," "Before Testosterone," and "After Testosterone."

The prologue is an important aspect of the book because Valerio uses an in depth narration of what it is like to be a [[transsexual]] to allow his readers to understand the trials and tribulations that one experiences when going through a sex change. In this section, Valerio wants people to understand that transsexuals are not simply just a branch of lesbian or [[gay]]. He wants people to understand that "transsexual identities must be defined and expressed on our own terms".&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In Valerio's opinion, transsexuals voices and experiences, until more recently, are "unheard and incompletely imagined" which is one of the reasons he wanted to write this memoir.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Part one is the section titled, The Beginning, which introduces you to Valerio as he begins his transition from female to male. Valerio discusses the physical changes occurring that have allowed him to understand what it feels like to experience biological masculinity. These include physical changes such as his voice becoming deeper and his hair becoming darker and coarser.

Part two which is the section title, Before Testosterone, narrates what led Valerio to decide that changing sex was the right path for him. This section of the book describes cultural and ethnic background of both his mother and father. Valerio talks about one of his relationships that lead him to discover that being a lesbian, and sex between two women, did not arouse him.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He discovered that his attraction towards women wasn’t a lesbian attraction rather that it was a heterosexual attraction, one from a man to a woman.

Part three, which is the section titled After Testosterone, is one written so that the readers can feel Valerio’s emotional, social, and perceptual transformation from female to male. The beginning chapters of this section narrates Valerio’s acceptance of becoming a male. His body is physically transitioning and he is adapting to doing and experiencing ‘male’ things such as shaving, adapting to a deeper voice, and having straight women make advances towards him &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; He also discusses the emotional experiences of telling everyone who didn’t yet already know that he was becoming a male. He describes an in detail encounter of coming out as transsexual to one of his female co-workers as a way to narrate the difficulty of identity politics when transitioning &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; With this woman, Valerio experienced his first intimate encounter with a female since transitioning to becoming a man. Valerio narrates his perceptual experiences of not yet having bottom surgery, but being physically male otherwise &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The book ends off with his discovery of his Adams apple that has grown from the testosterone which signifies his excitement and recognition that this transition was exactly what Max needed to be happy with himself.

Max Valerio had an increase in energy almost immediately, and increase in sex drive as well an inability to cry as he once had as a female.&lt;ref name="TTF"/&gt;

In the film MAX, Valerio talks about his experience of perceptual, emotional and physical change with testosterone. Filmed in New York City in the early 90's, the film is a groundbreaking exploration of trans male experience.&lt;ref name="MAX Movie"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Treut|first1=Monika|title=MAX with Max W. Valerio|journal=Film Transcript|date=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political views==
When Valerio identified himself as a lesbian, he was able to learn about the idea of [[feminism]], became involved with left wing [[radical politics]] and was able to have a deeper understanding of the female identity.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Helen. "Five Questions With... Max Wolf Valerio." EnGender. 29 Nov. 2006. &lt;http://www.myhusbandbetty.com/2006/11/29/five-questions-with-max-wolf-valerio/&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Valerio was a part of the [[American Indian Movement]] and participated in marches and visited the [[Pine Ridge Reservation]] when it was under siege by the F.B.I after the [[Wounded Knee Occupation]]. Valerio's political transformation was from left-wing radical and then to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]], and eventually to more libertarian/classic liberal and a member of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] party.&lt;ref&gt;Berg, Alex. "Voter Identification Laws Create Unique Problems For Transgender Voters." The Daily Beast. November 2, 2012http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/11/02/voter-identification-laws-create-unique-problems-for-transgender-voters.html.&lt;/ref&gt; He identifies as a classic liberal.

'''Momtaz El-Saeed''' (also known as '''Momtaz Saeed Abu El Nour'''; born 1948) is an [[Egypt]]ian civil servant who served in the government of Egypt as minister of finance from 2011 to 2013.

==Early life and education==
Saeed was born in 1948.&lt;ref name=acc/&gt; He obtained a bachelor's degree in accounting from [[Ain Shams University]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=acc/&gt;

==Career==
During the late 1990s, Saeed served as general director of the Egyptian finance ministry's budget division.&lt;ref name=Ahram/&gt; He was the ministry undersecretary during the term of Mubarak-era finance minister [[Youssef Boutros Ghali]].&lt;ref name=alahram2011/&gt; Prior to being appointed minister by Prime Minister [[Kamal Ganzouri]] in the interim government in December 2011, Saeed served as the second-in-command at Egypt's finance ministry.&lt;ref name=alahram2011&gt;{{cite news|title=Meet the ministers: A thumbnail guide|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/28785/Egypt/Politics-/Meet-the-ministers-A-thumbnail-guide-.aspx|accessdate=30 August 2012|work=Al Ahram|date=7 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed was called from retirement in the middle of 2011 to work as deputy finance minister under Finance Minister [[Hazem Al Beblawi]].&lt;ref name="Ahram"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/3/0/49287/Business/0/Egypts-new-economy-ministers-Whos-who.aspx| title=Egypt's new economy ministers: Who's who|work=Ahram Online|author=Feteha, Ahmed|author2=Al Abass, Bassem Abo|author3=Nowar, Nesma|date=3 August 2012|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gam26aug&gt;{{cite news|last=Gamal|first=Wael|title='No' to borrowing on the terms of the IMF, Ganzouri and their successors|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContentP/4/51316/Opinion/No-to-borrowing-on-the-terms-of-the-IMF,-Ganzouri-.aspx|accessdate=3 March 2013|work=Ahram Online|date=26 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 August 2012, Saeed was sworn in as part of Prime Minister [[Hisham Qandil]]'s [[Qandil Cabinet|cabinet]].&lt;ref name="Sworn in"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.alarabiya.net/articles/2012/08/02/229887.html|title=Egypt's president swears in new Cabinet; Tantawi to remain defense minister|website=Al Arabiya|date=2 August 2012|accessdate=8 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was one of the independent ministers in the cabinet.&lt;ref name=acc&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's Newly Appointed Cabinet Ministers|url=http://www.usegyptcouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/AmCham-Egypt-Newly-Appointed-Cabinet-Ministers.pdf|publisher=American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt|accessdate=30 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Saeed leans towards the [[conservative]] side, and no dramatic policy changes were expected from him.&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt; He prepared Egypt's 2012-2013 state budget.&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt; Saeed was criticized by the [[Freedom and Justice Party (Egypt)|Freedom and Justice Party]] (FJP) of the [[Muslim Brotherhood]], who claimed that he delayed presenting the budget to the Egyptian parliament by two months deliberately. One official of the FJP called the budget that Saeed drafted "a plot" to ensure that President Morsi fails," and that it was the same as every budget during the era of President [[Hosni Mubarak]].&lt;ref name="Ahram"/&gt; Saeed was replaced by [[Morsi El Sayed Hegazy|Morsi Hegazy]] as finance minister in a cabinet reshuffle on 5 January 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Egypt's cabinet reshuffle to see new interior, finance ministers|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/61841/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt%E2%80%99s-cabinet-reshuffle-to-see-new-interior,-fin.aspx|accessdate=6 January 2013|work=Ahram Online|date=5 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egyptian economic crisis===
Following the [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011]], Egypt's economy entered into decline, leading Egypt's central bank to sell dollars in order to bolster Egypt's pound. Egypt's economy faces a balance of payments crisis, and is also being further undermined due to high state borrowing costs.&lt;ref name="Qatar"/&gt;

On 13 August 2012, Saeed announced that [[Qatar]] was expected to deposit $500 million in the Egyptian central bank to help alleviate Egypt's economic crisis. He also said that Egyptian officials had discussed with [[Libya]] the possibility of Libya supporting Egypt's depleted finances.&lt;ref name="Qatar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/egypt-expects-qatar-deposit-within-week-minister-says|title=Egypt expects Qatar deposit within a week, minister says|website=Egypt Independent|agency=Reuters|date=13 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 22 August 2012, it was reported that following a meeting with Managing Director [[Christine Lagarde]] of the [[International Monetary Fund]], Saeed denied rumors pertaining to an imminent devaluation of the Egyptian pound. He also said that devaluation of the pound was not a condition for a $4.8 billion loan that Egypt was requesting from the [[IMF]].&lt;ref name="ACUS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acus.org/egyptsource/egypt-devaluation-egyptian-pound-likely-soon|title=Egypt: Is Devaluation of the Egyptian Pound Likely Soon?|publisher=Atlantic Council|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012|author=Khan, Mohsin}}&lt;/ref&gt; Saeed also added that the IMF would not interfere with the Egyptian government’s new reform policies, and that the loan is an indication that Egypt's economy is heading forward, and it should encourage foreign investment. In regards to the loan, Saeed said that Egypt is "entitled to assistance when going through a crisis" because Egypt is one of the founding members of the IMF and contributes to the IMF's capital. El-Saeed explained that the loan is mainly based on an economic and social reform program that Egypt prepared in order to escape from Egypt's economic crisis.&lt;ref name="IMF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/update-finance-minister-assures-imf-won-t-interfere-policy-addresses-qatar-loan|title=Finance minister assures IMF won't interfere with policy, addresses Qatar loan|publisher=Egypt Independent|website=MENA|date=23 August 2012|accessdate=29 August  2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Collection of taxes===
Saeed announced in May 2012 that he ordered the Egyptian tax authority to implement legal changes that would allow Egypt to collect billions of pounds of unpaid taxes, and would speed up collection and facilitate taxation of small businesses. El-Saeed said that Egypt is owed 150 billion pounds in uncollected taxes.&lt;ref name="Taxes"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.egyptindependent.com/news/finance-minister-instructs-change-taxing-law-econ-2|title=State to speed up collection of billions in back taxes|publisher=Egypt Independent|website=MENA|date=5 May 2012|accessdate=29 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nicholas II''' or '''Nikolai II''' ({{lang-rus|Николай II Алекса́ндрович|r=Nikolai II Aleksandrovich}}; {{OldStyleDateNY|18 May|6 May}} 1868 – 17 July 1918), known as '''Saint Nicholas the Passion-Bearer''' in the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], was the last [[Emperor of Russia]], ruling from 1 November 1894 until his forced [[abdication]] on 2 March 1917.&lt;ref&gt;The date was 2 March 1917 in the Julian Calendar then in use in Russia, which is the same day as 15 March 1917 in the Gregorian Calendar used elsewhere at that time.&lt;/ref&gt; His reign saw the fall of the [[Russian Empire]] from one of the foremost great powers of the world to economic and military collapse. He was given the nickname '''Nicholas the Bloody''' or '''Vile Nicholas''' by his political adversaries due to the [[Khodynka Tragedy]], [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|anti-Semitic pogroms]], [[Bloody Sunday (1905)|Bloody Sunday]], the violent suppression of the [[1905 Russian Revolution]], the execution of political opponents, and his perceived responsibility for the [[Russo-Japanese War]] (1904–1905).&lt;ref&gt;Woods, Alan (1999) [http://www.marxist.com/bolshevism-old/part2-4.html "The First Russian Revolution"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120630121441/http://www.marxist.com/bolshevism-old/part2-4.html |date=June 30, 2012 }} in ''Bolshevism: The Road to Revolution by Alan Woods'', Well Red Publications, {{ISBN|1900007053}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kallistov" /&gt; Soviet historians portrayed Nicholas as a weak and incompetent leader whose decisions led to military defeats and the deaths of millions of his subjects.&lt;ref name="Tsar Nicholas - exhibits from an execution"&gt;{{cite|title = Tsar Nicholas – exhibits from an execution|url = https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-18592372|publisher = BBC News|author = Martin Vennard|date = 27 June 2012|accessdate = 3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Russia was defeated in the 1904–1905 [[Russo-Japanese War]] which saw the annihilation of the reinforcing [[Russian Baltic Fleet]] after being sent on its round-the-world cruise at the naval [[Battle of Tsushima]], off the coasts of [[Korea]] and [[Japan]], the loss of Russian influence over [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]], and the [[Karafuto Prefecture|Japanese annexation to the north of South Sakhalin Island]]. The [[Anglo-Russian Entente]] was designed to counter the [[German Empire]]'s attempts to gain influence in the [[Middle East]], but it also ended the [[Great Game]] of confrontation between Russia and the [[United Kingdom]]. When all Russian diplomatic efforts to prevent the [[First World War]] (1914–1918) failed, Nicholas approved the [[Imperial Russian Army]] mobilization on 30 July 1914 which gave Imperial Germany formal grounds to declare war on Russia on 1 August 1914.&lt;ref&gt;A.I. Denikin. ''The Career of a Tsarist Officer: Memoirs, 1872–1916''. Translated by Margaret Patoski.

University Press of the Pacific. {{ISBN|1410209458}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Imperial Russian Army]]'s severe losses, the High Command's incompetent management of the war efforts, and lack of food and supplies on the home front were all leading causes of the fall of the [[House of Romanov]].

Following the [[February Revolution]] of 1917, Nicholas abdicated on behalf of himself and his son and heir, the Tsarevich Alexei Nikolaevich. He and his family were imprisoned and transferred to [[Tobolsk]] in late summer 1917.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieven|1993|p=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April 1918, Nicholas, Alexandra, and their daughter Maria were handed over to the local [[Ural Soviet]] council in [[Ekaterinburg]] (renamed Sverdlovsk during the Soviet era); the rest of the captives followed on 23 May.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieven|1993|pp=239–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas and his family were  [[Execution of the Romanov family|executed]] by their [[Bolshevik]] guards on the night of 16/17 July 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lieven|1993|pp=242–244}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remains of the imperial family were later found, exhumed, identified and re-interred with elaborate State and Church ceremony in St. Petersburg on 17 July 1998 – 80 years later.

In 1981, Nicholas, his wife, and their children were recognized as martyrs by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]] in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;A Reader's Guide to Orthodox Icons [http://iconreader.wordpress.com/2011/07/17/the-icons-that-canonized-the-holy-royal-martyrs/ ''The Icons that Canonized the Holy Royal Martyrs'']&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 August 2000,&lt;ref&gt;New York Times (2000) [https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/15/world/nicholas-ii-and-family-canonized-for-passion.html ''Nicholas II And Family Canonized For Passion'']&lt;/ref&gt; they were [[Canonization|canonized]] by the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] as [[passion bearer]]s, commemorating believers who face death in a Christ-like manner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://churchmotherofgod.org/orthodox-terminology/glossary-p/495-passion-bearer.html "Orthodox Terminology", Church of the Mother of God]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family background==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2017}}
[[File:Maria Fyodorovna and her son Niki.jpg|thumb|left|Nicholas II as a child with his mother, Maria Feodorovna, in 1870]]
Nicholas was born in the [[Alexander Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russian Empire]], the eldest son of [[Alexander III of Russia|Emperor Alexander III]] and [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Empress Maria Feodorovna of Russia]] (née Princess Dagmar of Denmark). He had five younger siblings: [[Grand Duke Alexander Alexandrovich of Russia|Alexander]] (1869–1870), [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|George]] (1871–1899), [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]] (1875–1960), [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Michael]] (1878–1918) and [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Olga]] (1882–1960). Nicholas often referred to his father nostalgically in letters after Alexander's death in 1894. He was also very close to his mother, as revealed in their published letters to each other.&lt;ref&gt;''The letters of Tsar Nicholas and Empress Marie: being confidential correspondence between Nicholas II, last of the Tsars, and his mother, Dowager Empress Maria Feodorovna''. Edward J. Bing (ed.). London: Nicholson and Watson, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt;

His paternal grandparents were [[Alexander II of Russia|Emperor Alexander II]] and [[Maria Alexandrovna (Marie of Hesse)|Empress Maria Alexandrovna]] (née Princess Marie of Hesse and by Rhine). His maternal grandparents were [[Christian IX of Denmark|King Christian IX]] and [[Louise of Hesse-Kassel|Queen Louise of Denmark]]. Nicholas was of primarily German and [[Danes|Danish]] descent, his last ethnically [[Russians|Russian]] ancestor being [[Grand Duchess Anna Petrovna of Russia]] (1708–1728), daughter of [[Peter the Great]].

[[File:Tsar Nicholas II &amp; King George V.JPG|thumb|Emperor Nicholas II of Russia with his physically similar cousin, [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]] (right), wearing German military uniforms in Berlin before the war; 1913]]
Nicholas was related to several monarchs in Europe. His mother's siblings included Kings [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[George I of Greece]], as well as the United Kingdom's [[Queen Alexandra]] (consort of [[King Edward VII]]). Nicholas, his wife Alexandra, and [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|German Emperor Wilhelm II]] were all first cousins of [[George V|King George V of the United Kingdom]]. Nicholas was also a first cousin of both [[Haakon VII of Norway|King Haakon VII]] and [[Maud of Wales|Queen Maud of Norway]], as well as [[Christian X of Denmark|King Christian X of Denmark]] and [[Constantine I of Greece|King Constantine I of Greece]]. Nicholas and Wilhelm II were in turn second cousins-once-removed, as each descended from [[Frederick William III of Prussia|King Frederick William III of Prussia]], as well as third cousins, as they were both great-great-grandsons of [[Tsar Paul I of Russia]]. In addition to being second cousins through descent from [[Louis II, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his wife [[Princess Wilhelmine of Baden]], Nicholas and Alexandra were also third cousins-once-removed, as they were both descendants of [[Frederick William II of Prussia|King Frederick William II of Prussia]].

Tsar Nicholas II was the first cousin-once-removed of [[Grand Duke Nikolai Nikolaevich of Russia (1856–1929)|Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolaevich]]. To distinguish between them the Grand Duke was often known within the imperial family as "Nikolasha" and "Nicholas the Tall", while the Tsar was "Nicholas the Short".

In his childhood, Nicholas, his parents and siblings made annual visits to the Danish royal palaces of [[Fredensborg Palace|Fredensborg]] and [[Bernstorff Palace|Bernstorff]] to visit his grandparents, the king and queen. The visits also served as family reunions, as his mother's siblings would also come from the United Kingdom, Germany and Greece with their respective families.&lt;ref&gt;Van Der Kiste, John (2003) ''The Romanovs: 1818–1959'', Sutton Publishing, p. 151&lt;/ref&gt; It was there in 1883, that he had a flirtation with one of his English first cousins, [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria]]. In 1873, Nicholas also accompanied his parents and younger brother, two-year-old George, on a two-month, semi-official visit to England.&lt;ref&gt;Clay, Catarine (2006) ''King, Kaiser, Tsar: Three Royal Cousins Who Led the World to War'', Walker &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0802716237}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In London, Nicholas and his family stayed at [[Marlborough House]], as guests of his "Uncle Bertie" and "Aunt Alix", the Prince and Princess of Wales, where he was spoiled by his uncle.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus, Philip (1964) ''King Edward the Seventh '', E.P. Dutton &amp; Co, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tsarevich==
On 1 March 1881,&lt;ref&gt;1 March 1881 in the Julian Calendar then in use in Russia, which is the same day as 13 March 1881 in the Gregorian Calendar used elsewhere at that time.&lt;/ref&gt; following [[Alexander II of Russia#Assassination|the assassination]] of his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II, Nicholas became [[heir apparent]] upon his father's ascension as Alexander III. Nicholas and his other family members bore witness to Alexander II's death, having been present at the [[Winter Palace]] in [[Saint Petersburg]], where he was brought after the attack.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; For security reasons, the new tsar and his family relocated their primary residence to the [[Gatchina Palace]] outside the city, only entering the capital for various ceremonial functions. On such occasions, Alexander III and his family occupied the nearby [[Anichkov Palace]].

[[File:Prince Nicolas at Nagasaki.jpg|thumb|Tsarevich Nicholas in Japan (1891)]]

In 1884, Nicholas's coming-of-age ceremony was held at the Winter Palace, where he pledged his loyalty to his father. Later that year, Nicholas's uncle, [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich]], married [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Princess Elizabeth]], daughter of [[Louis IV, Grand Duke of Hesse]] and his late wife [[Princess Alice of the United Kingdom]] (who had died in 1878), and a granddaughter of [[Queen Victoria]]. At the wedding in St. Petersburg, the sixteen-year-old [[Tsarevich]] met with and admired the bride's youngest surviving sister, twelve-year-old [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Princess Alix]]. Those feelings of admiration blossomed into love following her visit to St. Petersburg five years later in 1889. Alix had feelings for him in turn. As a devout Lutheran, she was initially reluctant to convert to Russian Orthodoxy in order to marry Nicholas, but later relented.&lt;ref&gt;[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890 Nicholas, [[Grand Duke George Alexandrovich of Russia|his younger brother George]], and their cousin [[Prince George of Greece and Denmark|Prince George of Greece]], set out on a [[Eastern journey of Nicholas II|world tour]], although Grand Duke George fell ill and was sent home partway through the trip. Nicholas visited Egypt, India, Singapore, and Bangkok, receiving honors as a distinguished guest in each country. In April 1891, in the city of [[Ōtsu]], Japan, Nicholas was [[Ōtsu incident|attacked by a deranged Japanese police officer]]. The incident cut his trip short. Returning overland to St. Petersburg, he was present at the ceremonies in [[Vladivostok]] commemorating the beginning of work on the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]]. In 1893, Nicholas traveled to London on behalf of his parents to be present at the wedding of his cousin, [[George V|the Duke of York]] to [[Princess Mary of Teck]]. Queen Victoria was struck by the physical resemblance between the two cousins, and their appearances confused some at the wedding. During this time, Nicholas had an affair with St. Petersburg ballerina [[Mathilde Kschessinska]].&lt;ref&gt;Kshessinska 1960. ''Dancing in Petersburg''. London, transl Haskell.&lt;/ref&gt;

Though Nicholas was heir-apparent to the throne, his father failed to prepare him for his future role as tsar. He attended meetings of the [[State Council (Russian Empire)|State Council]]; however, as his father was only in his forties, it was expected that it would be many years before Nicholas succeeded to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sergei Witte]], Russia's finance minister, saw things differently and suggested to the tsar that Nicholas be appointed to the Siberian Railway Committee.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pierre, Andre (1925) ''Journal Intime de Nicholas II'', Paris: Payot, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander argued that Nicholas was not mature enough to take on serious responsibilities, to which Witte replied that if Nicholas was not introduced to state affairs, he would never be ready to understand them.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Alexander's assumptions that he would live a long life and had years to prepare Nicholas for becoming tsar proved wrong, as by 1894, Alexander's health was failing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE HEALTH OF THE CZAR |work=[[Western Daily Press]] |date=15 February 1894 |accessdate=10 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000264/18940215/015/0005| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Engagement, accession and marriage==
{{see also|Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna|}}
[[File:Engagement official picture of Alexandra and Nicholas.jpg|thumb|upright|Official engagement photograph of Nicholas II and Alexandra, April 1894]]

In April 1894, Nicholas joined his Uncle [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Sergei]] and Aunt [[Grand Duchess Elizabeth Fyodorovna|Elizabeth]] on a journey to Coburg, Germany, for the wedding of Elizabeth's and Alix's brother, [[Ernest Louis, Grand Duke of Hesse]], to their mutual first cousin [[Princess Victoria Melita of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]]. Other guests included [[Queen Victoria]], [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm II]], the [[Victoria, Princess Royal|Empress Frederick]] (Kaiser Wilhelm's mother and Queen Victoria's eldest daughter), Nicholas's uncle, the [[Edward VII|Prince of Wales]], and the bride's parents, [[Prince Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh|the Duke]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Duchess of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha]].

Once in Coburg Nicholas proposed to Alix, but she rejected his proposal, being reluctant to convert to Orthodoxy. But the Kaiser later told her she had a duty to marry Nicholas and to convert, as her sister Elizabeth had voluntarily done in 1892. Thus Nicholas and Alix became officially engaged on 20 April 1894. Nicholas's parents initially hesitated to give the engagement their blessing, as Alix had made poor impressions during her visits to Russia. They gave their consent only when they saw Tsar Alexander's health deteriorating.

That summer, Nicholas travelled to England to visit both Alix and the Queen. The visit coincided with the birth of the Duke and Duchess of York's first child, the future [[King Edward VIII]]. Along with being present at the christening, Nicholas and Alix were listed among the child's godparents.&lt;ref&gt;[[#King1994|King (1994)]] p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; After several weeks in England, Nicholas returned home for the wedding of his sister, [[Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia|Xenia]], to a cousin, [[Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich of Russia|Grand Duke Alexander Mikhailovich]] ("Sandro").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Czarewitch |work=[[St James's Gazette]] |date=30 July 1894 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0001485/18940730/041/0008| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:1904-1905peterhof.jpg|thumb|left|Nicholas II and family]]

By that autumn, Alexander III lay dying. Upon learning that he would live only a fortnight, the Tsar had Nicholas summon Alix to the imperial palace at [[Livadia Palace|Livadia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Alix arrived on 22 October; the Tsar insisted on receiving her in full uniform. From his deathbed, he told his son to heed the advice of Witte, his most capable minister. Ten days later, Alexander III died at the age of forty-nine, leaving twenty-six-year-old Nicholas as Emperor of Russia. That evening, Nicholas was consecrated by his father's priest as Tsar Nicholas II and, the following day, Alix was received into the Russian Orthodox Church, taking the name Alexandra Feodorovna with the title of [[Grand Duchess]] and the style of ''[[Imperial Highness]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=THE CZAR AND PRINCESS ALIX. ANOTHER MANIFESTO |work=Exeter and Plymouth Gazette |date=5 November 1894 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000509/18941105/028/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas may have felt unprepared for the duties of the crown, for he asked his cousin and brother-in-law, Grand Duke Alexander,&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando (1996), ''[[A People's Tragedy]]'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; "What is going to happen to me and all of Russia?"&lt;ref&gt;Feinstein, Elaine (2006).

Vintage. {{ISBN|978-1-4000-3378-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Though perhaps under-prepared and unskilled, Nicholas was not altogether untrained for his duties as Tsar. Nicholas chose to maintain the conservative policies favoured by his father throughout his reign. While Alexander III had concentrated on the formulation of general policy, Nicholas devoted much more attention to the details of administration.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}}

[[File:Czar Nicholas Alexandra Olga.JPG|thumb|upright|Emperor Nicholas II and Empress Alexandra with their first child, 1896]]

Leaving Livadia on 7 November, Tsar Alexander's funeral procession—which included Nicholas's paternal aunt [[Olga Constantinovna of Russia|Queen Olga of Greece]], and the [[Edward VII|Prince]] and [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]]—arrived in Moscow. After lying in state in the Kremlin, the body of the Tsar was taken to St. Petersburg, where the funeral was held on 19 November.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CZAR ALEXANDER'S FUNERAL |work=Sheffield Evening Telegraph |date=20 November 1894 |accessdate=11 March 2016 |url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000275/18941120/017/0003| via = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas and Alix's wedding was originally scheduled for the spring of 1895, but it was moved forward at Nicholas's insistence. Staggering under the weight of his new office, he had no intention of allowing the one person who gave him confidence to leave his side.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 42.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, [[Wedding of Nicholas II and Alexandra Feodorovna|Nicholas's wedding to Alix]] took place on 26 November 1894, which was the birthday of the Dowager Empress Marie Feodorovna, and court mourning could be slightly relaxed. Alexandra wore the traditional dress of Romanov brides, and Nicholas a [[hussar]]'s uniform. Nicholas and Alexandra, each holding a lit candle, faced the palace priest and were married a few minutes before one in the afternoon.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 44&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite a visit to the United Kingdom in 1893, where he observed the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in debate and seemingly impressed by the machinery of [[constitutional monarchy]], Nicholas turned his back on any notion of giving away any power to elected representatives in Russia. Shortly after he came to the [[throne]], a deputation of peasants and workers from various towns' local assemblies (''[[zemstvos]]'') came to the [[Winter Palace]] proposing court reforms, such as the adoption of a constitutional monarchy,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; and reform that would improve the political and economic life of the peasantry, in the [[Tver Address]].&lt;ref&gt;Figes, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pierre, Andre (1925) ''Journal Intime de Nicholas II'', Paris: Payot, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the addresses they had sent in beforehand were couched in mild and loyal terms, Nicholas was angry and ignored advice from an Imperial Family Council by saying to them:

{{quote|... it has come to my knowledge that during the last months there have been heard in some assemblies of the zemstvos the voices of those who have indulged in a senseless dream that the zemstvos be called upon to participate in the government of the country. I want everyone to know that I will devote all my strength to maintain, for the good of the whole nation, the principle of absolute [[autocracy]], as firmly and as strongly as did my late lamented father.&lt;ref&gt;Radziwill, Catherine (1931) ''Nicholas II, The Last of the Tsars'', London: Cassell And Company Ltd., p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On 26 May 1896, Nicholas's formal [[Coronation of the Russian monarch|coronation]] as Tsar was held in [[Dormition Cathedral, Moscow|Uspensky Cathedral]] located within the [[Kremlin]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; The Silk Imperial Crown Of Russia was used, as an official coronation gift of the [[Russian Empire]]. Nicholas II was the first and only monarch to be presented with such a monumental coronation gift. It was not intended as ceremonial regalia, but as private Imperial property, a memento to his coronation.

{{Main|Khodynka Tragedy}}
In celebration on 27 May 1896, a large festival with food, free beer and souvenir cups was held in [[Khodynka Field]] outside Moscow. Khodynka was chosen as the location as it was the only place near Moscow large enough to hold all of the Moscow citizens.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 1017&lt;/ref&gt; Khodynka was primarily used as a military training ground and the field was uneven with trenches. Before the food and drink was handed out, rumours spread that there would not be enough for everyone. As a result, the crowd rushed to get their share and individuals were tripped and trampled upon, suffocating in the dirt of the field.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Warth|Warth]], pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt; Of the approximate 100,000 in attendance, it is estimated that 1,389 individuals died&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; and roughly 1,300 were injured.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; The Khodynka Tragedy was seen as an ill omen and Nicholas found gaining popular trust difficult from the beginning of his reign. The French ambassador's gala was planned for that night. The Tsar wanted to stay in his chambers and pray for the lives lost, but his uncles believed that his absence at the ball would strain relations with France, particularly the 1894 [[Franco-Russian Alliance]]. Thus Nicholas attended the party; as a result the mourning populace saw Nicholas as frivolous and uncaring.

During the autumn after the coronation, Nicholas and Alexandra made a tour of Europe. After making visits to the emperor and empress of Austria-Hungary, the Kaiser of Germany, and Nicholas's Danish grandparents and relatives, Nicholas and Alexandra took possession of their new yacht, the ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]], ''which had been built in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 420&lt;/ref&gt; From there, they made a journey to Scotland to spend some time with Queen Victoria at [[Balmoral Castle]]. While Alexandra enjoyed her reunion with her grandmother, Nicholas complained in a letter to his mother about being forced to go shooting with his uncle, the Prince of Wales, in bad weather, and was suffering from a bad toothache.&lt;ref&gt;King, Greg (2007) ''Twilight of Splendor: the Court of Queen Victoria in Her Diamond Jubilee Year '', John Wiley &amp; Sons, pp. 173–175&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Imperial Monogram of Tsar Nicholas II of Russia.svg|thumb|upright=0.8|Nicholas II's Imperial Monogram]]

The first years of his reign saw little more than continuation and development of the policy pursued by [[Alexander III of Russia|Alexander III]]. Nicholas allotted money for the [[All-Russia exhibition 1896|All-Russia exhibition of 1896]]. In 1897 restoration of [[gold standard]] by [[Sergei Witte]], Minister of Finance, completed the series of financial reforms, initiated fifteen years earlier. By 1902 the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] was nearing completion; this helped the Russians trade in the Far East but the railway still required huge amounts of work.

===Initiatives in foreign affairs===
In foreign relations, Nicholas followed the policies of his father, strengthening the [[Franco-Russian Alliance]] and pursuing a policy of general European pacification, which culminated in the famous [[Hague Conventions (1899 and 1907)|Hague peace conference]]. This conference, suggested and promoted by Nicholas II, was convened with the view of terminating the [[arms race]], and setting up machinery for the peaceful settlement of international disputes. The results of the conference were less than expected due to the mutual distrust existing between great powers. Nevertheless, the Hague conventions were among the first formal statements of the laws of war. In 1901 Nicholas II (and the famous Russian diplomat [[Friedrich Martens]]) were nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]]—for the initiative to convene the Hague Peace Conference and contributing to its implementation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/nomination/nomination.php?action=show&amp;showid=3291 The Nomination Database for the Nobel Prize in Peace, 1901–1956]. Nobelprize.org. Retrieved on 1 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecclesiastical affairs===
In 1903, Nicholas threw himself into an ecclesiastical crisis regarding the [[canonisation]] of [[Seraphim of Sarov]]. The previous year, it had been suggested that if he were canonised, the imperial couple would beget a son and heir to throne. While Alexandra demanded in July 1902 that Seraphim be canonised in less than a week, Nicholas demanded that he be canonised within a year. Despite a public outcry, the Church bowed to the intense imperial pressure, declaring Seraphim worthy of canonisation in January 1903. That summer, the imperial family travelled to Sarov for the canonisation.&lt;ref&gt;[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 137&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russo-Japanese War===
{{Main|Russo-Japanese War}}
[[File:Oleg-cruiser.jpg|thumb|The Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] was annihilated by the Japanese at the [[Battle of Tsushima]].]]

A clash between Russia and the [[Empire of Japan]] was almost inevitable by the turn of the 20th century. Russia had expanded in the Far East, and the growth of its settlement and territorial ambitions, as its southward path to the [[Balkans]] was frustrated, conflicted with Japan's own territorial ambitions on the Chinese and Asian mainland. Nicholas pursued an aggressive foreign policy with regards to [[Manchuria]] and [[Korea]], and strongly supported the scheme for timber concessions in these areas as developed by the [[Aleksandr Mikhailovich Bezobrazov|Bezobazov group]].&lt;ref name="Kowner"&gt;Kowner, '' Historical Dictionary of the Russo-Japanese War'', p. 260-264.&lt;/ref&gt;

War began in February 1904 with a preemptive Japanese attack on the Russian fleet in [[Battle of Port Arthur|Port Arthur]], prior to a formal declaration of war.&lt;ref name="Kowner" /&gt;

With the Russian Far East fleet trapped at Port Arthur, the only other Russian Fleet was the [[Baltic Fleet]]; it was half a world away, but the decision was made to send the fleet on a nine-month voyage to the East. The United Kingdom would not allow the Russian navy to use the [[Suez Canal]], due to [[Anglo-Japanese Alliance|its alliance]] with the Empire of Japan, and due to the [[Dogger Bank incident]] where the Baltic Fleet mistakenly fired on British fishing boats in the North Sea. The Russian [[Baltic Fleet]] traversed the world to lift the blockade on Port Arthur, but after many misadventures on the way, was nearly annihilated by the Japanese in the [[Battle of Tsushima|Battle of the Tsushima Strait]].&lt;ref name="Kowner" /&gt; On land the [[Imperial Russian Army]] experienced logistical problems. While commands and supplies came from [[St. Petersburg]], combat took place in east Asian ports with only the [[Trans-Siberian Railway]] for transport of supplies as well as troops both ways.&lt;ref name="Kowner" /&gt;  The {{convert|9200|km|mi|adj=on}} rail line between St. Petersburg and Port Arthur was single-track, with no track around [[Lake Baikal]], allowing only gradual build-up of the forces on the front. [[Siege of Port Arthur|Besieged Port Arthur]] fell to the Japanese, after nine months of resistance.&lt;ref name="Kowner" /&gt;

Nicholas's stance on the war was something that baffled many. He approached the war with confidence and saw it as an opportunity to raise Russian morale and patriotism, paying little attention to the financial repercussions of a long-distance war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 67&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly before the Japanese attack on Port Arthur, Nicholas held firm to the belief that there would be no war. Despite the onset of the war and the many defeats Russia suffered, Nicholas still believed in, and expected, a final victory, maintaining an image of the racial inferiority and military weakness of the Japanese.&lt;ref name="Kowner" /&gt;

As Russia faced imminent defeat by the Japanese, the call for peace grew. Nicholas's own mother, as well as his cousin, [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Emperor Wilhelm II]], urged Nicholas to open peace negotiations. Despite the efforts for peace, Nicholas remained evasive, sending a telegram to the Kaiser on 10 October that it was his intent to keep on fighting until the Japanese were driven from Manchuria.&lt;ref name="Kowner" /&gt;  It was not until 27–28 May 1905 and the annihilation of the Russian fleet by the Japanese, that Nicholas finally decided to sue for peace.{{citation needed|date = March 2014}} Nicholas II accepted American mediation, appointing [[Sergei Witte]] chief plenipotentiary for the peace talks. The war was ended by the signing of the [[Treaty of Portsmouth]].&lt;ref name="Kowner" /&gt;

===Anti-Jewish pogroms of 1903–1906===
{{Main|Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire}}

The [[Kishinev]] newspaper ''Bessarabets'', which published anti-Semitic materials, received funds from [[Viacheslav Plehve]], Minister of the Interior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.friends-partners.org/partners/beyond-the-pale/english/36.html |title = Beyond the Pale: The Pogroms of 1903–1906 |accessdate = 17 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; These publications served to fuel the [[Kishinev pogrom]] (rioting). The government of Nicholas II formally condemned the rioting and dismissed the regional governor, with the perpetrators arrested and punished by the court.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. 94–95, 122 in Russian edition&lt;/ref&gt; Leadership of the Russian Orthodox Church also condemned anti-Semitic pogroms. Appeals to the faithful condemning the pogroms were read publicly in all churches of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Solzhenitsyn, Alexander (2001) ''Two hundred years together''. Moscow. p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; In private Nicholas expressed his admiration for the mobs, viewing anti-Semitism as a useful tool for unifying the people behind the government;&lt;ref&gt;Figes, Orlando (1996), ''[[A People's Tragedy]]'', pp. 197–8&lt;/ref&gt; however in 1911, following the assassination of [[Pyotr Stolypin]] by the Jewish revolutionary [[Dmitry Bogrov]], he approved of government efforts to prevent anti-Semitic pogroms.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'' (1967) p. 228&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bloody Sunday (1905)===
{{Main|Bloody Sunday (1905)}}
[[File:Czar Nicholas II of Russia (1868-1917) (1905).ogv|thumb|Tsar Nicholas of Russia mounts his horse (1905?), unknown cinematographer of the [[Edison Manufacturing Company]]]]

A few days prior to Bloody Sunday (9 (22) January 1905), priest and labor leader [[Georgy Gapon]] informed the government of the forthcoming procession to the Winter Palace to hand a workers' petition to the Tsar. On Saturday, 8 (21) January, the ministers convened to consider the situation. There was never any thought that the Tsar, who had left the capital for Tsarskoye Selo on the advice of the ministers, would actually meet Gapon; the suggestion that some other member of the imperial family receive the petition was rejected.&lt;ref name="Massie, R p. 124"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally informed by the Prefect of Police that he lacked the men to pluck Gapon from among his followers and place him under arrest, the newly appointed Minister of the Interior, Prince [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky|Sviatopolk-Mirsky]], and his colleagues decided to bring additional troops to reinforce the city. That evening Nicholas wrote in his diary, "Troops have been brought from the outskirts to reinforce the garrison. Up to now the workers have been calm. Their number is estimated at 120,000. At the head of their union is a kind of socialist priest named Gapon. Mirsky came this evening to present his report on the measures taken."&lt;ref name="Massie, R p. 124" /&gt;

On Sunday, 9 (22) January 1905, Gapon began his march. Locking arms, the workers [[Nonviolent resistance|marched peacefully]] through the streets. Some carried religious icons and banners, as well as national flags and portraits of the Tsar. As they walked, they sang hymns and ''[[God Save the Tsar!|God Save The Tsar]]''. At 2{{nbsp}}pm all of the converging processions were scheduled to arrive at the Winter Palace. There was no single confrontation with the troops. Throughout the city, at bridges on strategic boulevards, the marchers found their way blocked by lines of infantry, backed by [[Cossack]]s and Hussars; and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd.&lt;ref name="Massie, R pp. 124"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. 124–125&lt;/ref&gt;

The official number of victims was 92 dead and several hundred wounded. Gapon vanished and the other leaders of the march were seized. Expelled from the capital, they circulated through the empire, increasing the casualties. As bullets riddled their icons, their banners and their portraits of Nicholas, the people shrieked, "The Tsar will not help us!"&lt;ref name="Massie, R pp. 124" /&gt; Outside Russia, the future British Labour Prime Minister [[Ramsay MacDonald]] attacked the Tsar, calling him a "blood-stained creature and a common murderer".&lt;ref name="massie125" /&gt;

That evening Nicholas wrote in his diary:

{{quote|Difficult day! In St. Petersburg there were serious disturbances due to the desire of workers to get to the Winter Palace. The troops had to shoot in different places of the city, there were many dead and wounded. Lord, how painful and bad!&lt;ref name=massie125&gt;Cf.: [[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 125. — Massie's translation is not authentic.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="militera.lib.ru"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://militera.lib.ru/db/nikolay-2/1905.html |title=State Archive of the Russian Federation, ф.601.ОП.1, д.248.

His younger sister, [[Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Olga Alexandrovna]], wrote afterwards:

{{quote|Nicky had the police report a few days before. That Saturday he telephoned my mother at the Anitchkov and said that she and I were to leave for Gatchina at once. He and Alicky went to Tsarskoye Selo. Insofar as I remember, my Uncles Vladimir and Nicholas were the only members of the family left in St. Petersburg, but there may have been others. I felt at the time that all those arrangements were hideously wrong. Nicky's ministers and the Chief of Police had it all their way. My mother and I wanted him to stay in St. Petersburg and to face the crowd. I am positive that, for all the ugly mood of some of the workmen, Nicky's appearance would have calmed them. They would have presented their petition and gone back to their homes. But that wretched Epiphany incident had left all the senior officials in a state of panic. They kept on telling Nicky that he had no right to run such a risk, that he owed it to the country to leave the capital, that even with the utmost precautions taken there might always be some loophole left. My mother and I did all we could to persuade him that the ministers' advice was wrong, but Nicky preferred to follow it and he was the first to repent when he heard of the tragic outcome.&lt;ref name=vorres121&gt;Vorres, Ian (1985) ''The Last Grand Duchess'', London, Finedawn Publishers, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt;}}

From his hiding place Gapon issued a letter, stating "Nicholas Romanov, formerly Tsar and at present soul-murderer of the Russian empire. The innocent blood of workers, their wives and children lies forever between you and the Russian people ... May all the blood which must be spilled fall upon you, you Hangman. I call upon all the socialist parties of Russia to come to an immediate agreement among themselves and bring an armed uprising against [[Tsarism]]."&lt;ref name="massie125" /&gt;

===1905 Revolution===
{{Main|1905 Russian Revolution}}
[[File:The Church Parade of the Finnish Life Guards Regiment.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II visiting the [[Finland Guard Regiment]], 1905]]

Confronted with growing opposition and after consulting with Witte and [[Pyotr Dmitrievich Sviatopolk-Mirsky|Prince Sviatopolk-Mirsky]], the Tsar issued a reform [[ukase]] on December 25, 1904 with vague promises.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Williams (linguist)|Harold Williams]], Shadow of Democracy, p. 11, 22&lt;/ref&gt; 
In hopes of cutting short the rebellion, many demonstrators were shot on [[Bloody Sunday (1905)]] as they tried to march to the Winter Palace in St. Petersburg. [[Dmitri Feodorovich Trepov]] was ordered to take drastic measures to stop the revolutionary activity. [[Grand Duke Sergei Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Sergei]] was killed in February by a revolutionary's bomb in Moscow as he left the Kremlin. On 3 March the Tsar condemned the revolutionaries. Meanwhile, Witte recommended that a manifesto be issued.&lt;ref&gt;H. Williams, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Schemes of reform would be elaborated by [[Goremykin]] and a committee consisting of elected representatives of the [[zemstvos]] and municipal councils under the presidency of Witte. In June the [[Russian battleship Potemkin|battleship Potemkin]], part of the [[Black Sea Fleet]], [[mutiny|mutinied]].

Around August/September, after his diplomatic success on ending the [[Russo-Japanese War]], Witte wrote to the Tsar stressing the urgent need for political reforms at home. The Tsar remained quite impassive and indulgent; he spent most of that autumn hunting.&lt;ref&gt;O. Figes [[A People's Tragedy]], p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; With the defeat of Russia by a non-Western power, the prestige and authority of the autocratic regime fell significantly.&lt;ref&gt;Kenez, Peter (1999) ''A History of the Soviet Union From the Beginning to the End'', Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|0521311985}}, p. 7. This was especially true among the illiterate peasantry or 'dark masses' who although they followed their own (almost pagan) rituals, had until this point held complete naive faith in the Tsar.&lt;/ref&gt; Tsar Nicholas II, taken by surprise by the events, reacted with anger and bewilderment. He wrote to his mother after months of disorder:

{{quote|It makes me sick to read the news! Nothing but strikes in schools and factories, murdered policemen, [[Cossacks]] and soldiers, riots, disorder, mutinies. But the ministers, instead of acting with quick decision, only assemble in council like a lot of frightened hens and cackle about providing united ministerial action... ominous quiet days began, quiet indeed because there was complete order in the streets, but at the same time everybody knew that something was going to happen&amp;nbsp;— the troops were waiting for the signal, but the other side would not begin. One had the same feeling, as before a thunderstorm in summer! Everybody was on edge and extremely nervous and of course, that sort of strain could not go on for long.... We are in the midst of a revolution with an administrative apparatus entirely disorganized, and in this lies the main danger.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, M (1974) ''Nicholas II, The Last Tsar'', Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, {{ISBN|0710078021}}, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In October a railway strike developed into a [[general strike]] which paralysed the country. In a city without electricity, Witte told Nicholas II "that the country was at the verge of a cataclysmic revolution". According to [[Orlando Figes]] the Tsar asked his uncle [[Grand Duke Nicholas]] to assume the role of dictator. "But the Grand Duke ... took out a revolver and threatened to shoot himself there and then if the Tsar refused to endorse Witte's memorandum." Nicholas II had no choice but to make a number of steps in the constitutional liberal direction.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peoples.ru/state/politics/vitte/&lt;/ref&gt; The Tsar accepted the draft, hurriedly outlined by Aleksei D. [[Obolensky]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/featuresandfigur011843mbp#page/n421/mode/2up/search/Witte+ Features And Figures Of The Past Covernment And Opinion In The Reign Of Nicholas II]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Witte's Memoirs, p. 241&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias'' was forced &lt;!--on the 17th--&gt; to sign the [[October Manifesto]] agreeing to the establishment of the [[State Duma (Russian Empire)|Imperial Duma]], and to give up part of his unlimited [[autocracy]]. For the next six months, Witte was the [[List of heads of government of Russia|Prime Minister]]. According to [[Harold Williams (linguist)|Harold Williams]]: "That government was almost paralyzed from the beginning. On 26 October (O.S.) the Tsar appointed Trepov Master of the Palace (without consulting Witte), and had daily contact with the Emperor; his influence at court was paramount. On 1 November 1905, (O.S.) [[Princess Milica of Montenegro]] presented [[Grigori Rasputin]] to Tsar Nicholas and his wife at [[Peterhof Palace]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rus-sky.com/history/library/diaris/1905.htm |title=Nicolas' diary 1905 (in Russian) |publisher=Rus-sky.com |date= |accessdate=28 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with the Duma===
[[File:Nicholas II Coin.jpg|thumb|One ruble silver Coin of Emperor Nicholas II, dated 1898, with the Imperial coat-of-arms on the reverse. The Russian inscription reads:&lt;br&gt;''B[ozheyu] M[ilostyu] Nikolay Imperator i Samoderzhets Vse[ya] Ross[ii].[iyskiy].''&lt;br&gt;The English translation is, "By the grace of God, Nicholas II, Emperor and Autocrat of All the Russias."]]

Under pressure from the attempted [[1905 Russian Revolution]], on 5 August of that year Nicholas II issued a manifesto about the convocation of the [[State Duma of the Russian Empire|State Duma]], known as the [[Alexander Bulygin|Bulygin Duma]], initially thought to be an advisory organ. In the [[October Manifesto]], the Tsar pledged to introduce basic [[civil liberties]], provide for broad participation in the State Duma, and endow the Duma with legislative and oversight powers. He was determined, however, to preserve his [[autocracy]] even in the context of reform. This was signalled in the text of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|1906 constitution]]. He was described as the supreme autocrat, and retained sweeping executive powers, also in church affairs. His cabinet ministers were not allowed to interfere or assist each other; they were responsible only to him.

Nicholas's relations with the Duma were poor. The [[First Duma]], with a majority of [[Constitutional Democratic party|Kadets]], almost immediately came into conflict with him. Scarcely had the 524 members sat down at the [[Tauride Palace]] when they formulated an 'Address to the Throne'. It demanded [[universal suffrage]], radical land reform, the release of all [[political prisoner]]s and the dismissal of ministers appointed by the Tsar in favour of ministers acceptable to the Duma.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 243&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Duchess Olga, Nicholas's sister, later wrote:

{{quote|There was such gloom at Tsarskoye Selo. I did not understand anything about politics. I just felt everything was going wrong with the country and all of us. The October Constitution did not seem to satisfy anyone. I went with my mother to the first Duma. I remember the large group of deputies from among peasants and factory people. The peasants looked sullen. But the workmen were worse: they looked as though they hated us. I remember the distress in [[Alexandra Feodorovna (Alix of Hesse)|Alicky]]'s eyes.&lt;ref name="vorres121" /&gt;}}

Minister of the Court Count [[Vladimir Frederiks]] commented, "The Deputies, they give one the impression of a gang of criminals who are only waiting for the signal to throw themselves upon the ministers and cut their throats. I will never again set foot among those people."&lt;ref name="massie242"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 242&lt;/ref&gt; The Dowager Empress noticed "incomprehensible hatred."&lt;ref name="massie242" /&gt;

Although Nicholas initially had a good relationship with his prime minister, [[Sergei Witte]], Alexandra distrusted him as he had instigated an investigation of [[Grigori Rasputin]] and, as the political situation deteriorated, Nicholas dissolved the Duma. The Duma was populated with [[Political radicalism|radicals]], many of whom wished to push through legislation that would abolish private property ownership, among other things. Witte, unable to grasp the seemingly insurmountable problems of reforming Russia and the monarchy, wrote to Nicholas on 14 April 1906 resigning his office (however, other accounts have said that Witte was forced to resign by the Emperor). Nicholas was not ungracious to Witte and an Imperial Rescript was published on 22 April creating Witte a Knight of the [[Order of Saint Alexander Nevsky]] with diamonds (the last two words were written in the Emperor's own hand, followed by "I remain unalterably well-disposed to you and sincerely grateful, for ever more Nicholas.").

A second Duma met for the first time in February 1907. The [[leftist]] parties—including the [[Social Democrats]] and the Social Revolutionaries, who had boycotted the First Duma—had won 200 seats in the Second, more than a third of the membership. Again Nicholas waited impatiently to rid himself of the Duma. In two letters to his mother he let his bitterness flow:

{{quote|A grotesque deputation is coming from England to see liberal members of the Duma. [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Uncle Bertie]] informed us that they were very sorry but were unable to take action to stop their coming. Their famous "liberty", of course. How angry they would be if a deputation went from us to the Irish to wish them success in their struggle against their government.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A little while later he further wrote:

{{quote|All would be well if everything said in the Duma remained within its walls. Every word spoken, however, comes out in the next day's papers which are avidly read by everyone. In many places the populace is getting restive again. They begin to talk about land once more and are waiting to see what the Duma is going to say on the question. I am getting telegrams from everywhere, petitioning me to order a dissolution, but it is too early for that. One has to let them do something manifestly stupid or mean and then&amp;nbsp;— slap! And they are gone!&lt;ref name="massie245"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Stolypin, Nicholas II, jewish delegation.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II, Stolypin and the [[Jews in Ukraine|Jewish]] delegation during the Tsar's visit to [[Kiev]] in 1911]]

After the [[Second Duma]] resulted in similar problems, the new prime minister [[Pyotr Stolypin]] (whom Witte described as "reactionary") unilaterally dissolved it, and changed the electoral laws to allow for future Dumas to have a more conservative content, and to be dominated by the liberal-conservative [[Octobrist]] Party of [[Alexander Guchkov]]. Stolypin, a skilful politician, had ambitious plans for reform. These included making loans available to the lower classes to enable them to buy land, with the intent of forming a farming class loyal to the crown. Nevertheless, when the Duma remained hostile, Stolypin had no qualms about invoking Article 87 of the [[Russian Constitution of 1906|Fundamental Laws]], which empowered the Tsar to issue 'urgent and extraordinary' emergency decrees 'during the recess of the State Duma'. Stolypin's most famous legislative act, the change in peasant land tenure, was promulgated under Article 87.&lt;ref name="massie245" /&gt;

The third Duma remained an independent body. This time the members proceeded cautiously. Instead of hurling themselves at the government, opposing parties within the Duma worked to develop the body as a whole. In the classic manner of the British Parliament, the Duma reached for power grasping for the national purse strings. The Duma had the right to question ministers behind closed doors as to their proposed expenditures. These sessions, endorsed by Stolypin, were educational for both sides, and, in time, mutual antagonism was replaced by mutual respect. Even the sensitive area of military expenditure, where the October Manifesto clearly had reserved decisions to the throne, a Duma commission began to operate. Composed of aggressive patriots no less anxious than Nicholas to restore the fallen honour of Russian arms, the Duma commission frequently recommended expenditures even larger than those proposed.

With the passage of time, Nicholas also began to have confidence in the Duma. "This Duma cannot be reproached with an attempt to seize power and there is no need at all to quarrel with it," he said to Stolypin in 1909.&lt;ref name="massie246"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 246&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Stolypin's plans were undercut by conservatives at court. Reactionaries such as Prince [[Vladimir Nikolayevich Orlov]] never tired of telling the Tsar that the very existence of the Duma was a blot on the autocracy, which Tsaritsa Alexandra had always believed anyway. Stolypin, they whispered, was a traitor and secret revolutionary who was conniving with the Duma to steal the prerogatives assigned the Tsar by God. Witte also engaged in constant intrigue against Stolypin. Although Stolypin had had nothing to do with Witte's fall, Witte blamed him. Stolypin had unwittingly angered the Tsaritsa. He had ordered an investigation into Rasputin and presented it to the Tsar, who read it but did nothing. Stolypin, on his own authority, ordered Rasputin to leave St. Petersburg. Alexandra protested vehemently but Nicholas refused to overrule his Prime Minister,&lt;ref name="massie247"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; who had more influence with the Emperor.

By the time of Stolypin's assassination by [[Dmitry Bogrov]], a student (and police informant) in a theatre in Kiev on 18 September 1911, Stolypin had grown weary of the burdens of office. For a man who preferred clear decisive action, working with a sovereign who believed in fatalism and mysticism was frustrating. As an example, Nicholas once returned a document unsigned with the note:

{{quote|Despite most convincing arguments in favour of adopting a positive decision in this matter, an inner voice keeps on insisting more and more that I do not accept responsibility for it. So far my conscience has not deceived me. Therefore I intend in this case to follow its dictates. I know that you, too, believe that "a Tsar's heart is in God's hands." Let it be so. For all laws established by me I bear a great responsibility before God, and I am ready to answer for my decision at any time.&lt;ref name="massie247" /&gt;}}

[[File:Григорий Распутин (1914-1916)b.jpg|thumb|[[Grigori Rasputin]]]]

Alexandra, believing that Stolypin had severed the bonds that her son depended on for life, hated the Prime Minister.&lt;ref name="massie247" /&gt; In March 1911, in a fit of anger stating that he no longer commanded the imperial confidence, Stolypin asked to be relieved of his office. Two years earlier when Stolypin had casually mentioned resigning to Nicholas he was informed: "This is not a question of confidence or lack of it. It is my will. Remember that we live in Russia, not abroad...and therefore I shall not consider the possibility of any resignation."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 248&lt;/ref&gt;

It never got that far. On 18 September 1911, in a procession where Stolypin's car was unprotected, Rasputin had coincidentally returned from his exile. As Stolypin's car passed him, Rasputin cried out in a loud voice, "Death is after him! Death is driving behind him!"&lt;ref name="massie226"&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 226&lt;/ref&gt; Bogrov would later assassinate Stolypin in the Kiev theatre that night.&lt;ref name="massie226" /&gt;

In 1912, a fourth Duma was elected with almost the same membership as the third. "The Duma started too fast. Now it is slower, but better, and more lasting," stated Nicholas to Sir [[Bernard Pares]].&lt;ref name="massie246" /&gt;

The [[World War I|First World War]] developed badly for Russia. By late 1916, Romanov family desperation reached the point that [[Grand Duke Paul Alexandrovich]], younger brother of Alexander III and the Tsar's only surviving uncle, was deputed to beg Nicholas to grant a constitution and a government responsible to the Duma. Nicholas sternly and adamantly refused, reproaching his uncle for asking him to break his coronation oath to maintain autocratic power for his successors. In the Duma on 2 December 1916, Vladimir Purishkevich, a fervent patriot, monarchist and war worker, denounced the dark forces which surrounded the throne in a thunderous two-hour speech which was tumultuously applauded. "Revolution threatens," he warned, "and an obscure peasant shall govern Russia no longer!"&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tsarevich Alexei's illness and Rasputin===
[[File:TsarevichAlexeiNikolaievichOfRussia--nsillustratedwar04londuoft.jpg|left|thumb|Tsarevich [[Alexei Nikolaevich]], c. 1913]]

Further complicating domestic matters was the matter of the succession. Alexandra bore Nicholas four daughters, [[Grand Duchess Olga Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Olga]] in 1895, [[Grand Duchess Tatiana Nikolaevna of Russia|the Grand Duchess Tatiana]] in 1897, [[Grand Duchess Maria Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria]] in 1899, and [[Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolaevna of Russia|Grand Duchess Anastasia]] in 1901, before their son [[Alexei Nikolaevich, Tsarevich of Russia|Alexei]] was born on 12 August 1904. The young heir was afflicted with [[Haemophilia B]], a hereditary disease that prevents blood from clotting properly, which at that time was untreatable and usually led to an untimely death. As a granddaughter of Queen Victoria, Alexandra carried the same [[gene mutation]] that afflicted several of the major European royal houses, such as [[Prussia]] and Spain. Hemophilia therefore became known as "[[Haemophilia in European royalty|the royal disease]]". Through Alexandra the disease had passed on to her son. As all of Nicholas and Alexandra's daughters perished with their parents and brother in Yekaterinburg in 1918, it is not known whether any of them inherited the gene as [[genetic carrier|carriers]].

Because of the fragility of the autocracy at this time, Nicholas and Alexandra chose not to divulge Alexei's condition to anyone outside the imperial household. In fact, there were many in the household who were unaware of the exact nature of the Tsarevich's illness. At first Alexandra turned to Russian doctors and medics to treat Alexei; however, their treatments generally failed, and Alexandra increasingly turned to [[mysticism|mystic]]s and holy men (or ''[[starets]]'' as they were called in Russian). One of these starets, an illiterate [[Siberia]]n named [[Grigori Rasputin]], appeared to have some success. Rasputin's influence over Empress Alexandra, and consequently the Tsar himself, had grown stronger ever since 1912, when the Tsarevich nearly died from an injury while the family was on vacation at the hunting lodges at [[Białowieża]] and [[Spała]] ([[Poland]]). The bleeding grew steadily worse until it was assumed that the Tsarevich would not survive, and the [[last rites|Last Sacrament]] was administered on 10 October 1912. In desperation Alexandra called upon Rasputin as a last resort, to which he replied, "God has seen your tears and heard your prayers. Do not grieve. The Little One will not die. Do not allow the doctors to bother him too much."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] p. 185&lt;/ref&gt; The haemorrhage stopped the very next day and the boy began to recover. Alexandra took this as a sign that Rasputin was a ''starets'' and that God was with him; for the rest of her life she would fervently defend him and turn her wrath against anyone who dared to question him.

===European affairs===
[[File:Nicholas II and Alexei in Reval 1908.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II and his son Alexei aboard the Imperial yacht ''[[Russian yacht Standart|Standart]]'', during King [[Edward VII]]'s state visit to Russia in [[Reval|Tallinn]], 1908]]

In 1907, to end longstanding controversies over central Asia, Russia and Great Britain signed the [[Anglo-Russian Convention of 1907|Anglo-Russian Convention]] that resolved most of the problems generated for decades by [[The Great Game]].&lt;ref&gt;Ira Klein, I"The Anglo-Russian Convention and the Problem of Central Asia, 1907-1914," ''Journal of British Studies'' (1971) 11#1 pp.&amp;nbsp;126–147 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/175041 in JSTOR]
&lt;/ref&gt;  Great Britain had already entered into the [[Entente cordiale]] with France in 1904, and the Anglo-Russian convention led to the formation of the [[Triple Entente]]. The following year, in May 1908, Nicholas and Alexandra's shared "Uncle Bertie" and "Aunt Alix," Britain's King Edward VII and Queen Alexandra made a state visit to Russia, being the first reigning British monarchs to do so. However, they did not set foot on Russian soil. Instead, they stayed aboard their yachts, meeting off the coast of modern-day [[Tallinn]]. Later that year, Nicholas was taken off guard by the news that his foreign minister, [[Alexander Izvolsky]] had entered into a secret agreement with the Austro-Hungarian foreign minister, [[Count Alois Lexa von Aehrenthal|Count Alois von Aehrenthal]], agreeing that, in exchange for Russian naval access to the [[Dardanelles]] and the [[Bosporus Strait]], Russia would not oppose the Austrian annexation of [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], a revision of the 1878 [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]]. When Austria-Hungary did annex this territory that October, it precipitated the [[Bosnian crisis|diplomatic crisis]]. When Russia protested about the annexation, the Austrians threatened to leak secret communications between Izvolsky and Aehernthal, prompting Nicholas to complain in a letter to the Austrian emperor, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]], about a breach of confidence. In 1909, in the wake of the Anglo-Russian convention, the Russian imperial family made a visit to England, staying on the [[Isle of Wight]] for [[Cowes Week]]. In 1913, during the [[Balkan War (1912–13)|Balkan Wars]], Nicholas personally offered to arbitrate between Serbia and Bulgaria. However, the Bulgarians rejected his offer. Also in 1913, Nicholas, albeit without Alexandra, made a visit to Berlin for the wedding of Kaiser Wilhelm II's daughter, [[Princess Victoria Louise of Prussia|Princess Victoria Louise]], to a maternal cousin of Nicholas, [[Ernest Augustus, Duke of Brunswick|Ernest Augustus, the Duke of Brunswick]].&lt;ref&gt;Clay, Catarine (2006) ''King, Kaiser, Tsar: Three Royal Cousins Who Led the World to War'', Walker &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0802716237}}, pp. 300–301&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas was also joined by his cousin, [[King George V]] and his wife, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]].

===Tercentenary===
{{Main|Romanov Tercentenary}}
In February 1913, Nicholas presided over the [[Romanov Tercentenary|tercentenary celebrations for the Romanov Dynasty]]. On 21 February, a ''[[Te Deum]]'' took place at Kazan Cathedral, and a state reception at the Winter Palace.&lt;ref&gt;[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 391&lt;/ref&gt; In May, Nicholas and the imperial family made a pilgrimage across the empire, retracing the route down the [[Volga River]] that was made by the teenage [[Michael I of Russia|Michael Romanov]] from the [[Ipatiev Monastery]] in [[Kostroma]] to Moscow in 1613 when he finally agreed to become tsar.&lt;ref&gt;[[#King2006|King (2006)]] p. 397&lt;/ref&gt;

===First World War===
{{Further|Russian entry into World War I}}
On 28 June 1914 [[Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria]], heir to the [[Austro-Hungarian]] throne, was assassinated by a Bosnian Serb in [[Sarajevo]]. Nicholas vacillated as to Russia's course of action. The outbreak of war was not inevitable, but leaders, diplomats and nineteenth-century alliances created a climate for large-scale conflict. The concept of [[Pan-Slavism]] and shared ethnicity and religion created strong public sympathy between Russia and Serbia.  Territorial conflict created rivalries between Germany and France and between Austria and [[Serbia]], and as a consequence alliance networks developed across Europe. The [[Triple Entente]] and [[Triple Alliance (1882)|Triple Alliance]] networks were set before the war.  Nicholas wanted neither to abandon Serbia to the ultimatum of [[Austria-Hungary]], nor to provoke a general war. In a series of letters exchanged with [[Wilhelm II, German Emperor|Kaiser Wilhelm]] of Germany (the "[[Willy and Nicky]] correspondence") the two proclaimed their desire for peace, and each attempted to get the other to back down. Nicholas desired that Russia's mobilization be only against the Austrian border, in the hopes of preventing war with the [[German Empire]].

On 25 July 1914, at his council of ministers Tsar Nicholas II decided to intervene in the Austro-Serbian conflict, a step toward general war. He put the Russian army on "alert"&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;Merriman, John (2009) ''A History of Modern Europe Volume Two'', W. W. Norton &amp; Company, {{ISBN|0393933857}}, p. 967&lt;/ref&gt; on 25 July. Although this was not general mobilization, it threatened the German and Austrian borders and looked like military preparation for war.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC" /&gt; However, his army had no contingency plans for a partial mobilization, and on 30 July 1914 Nicholas took the fateful step of confirming the order for general mobilization, despite being strongly counselled against it.

On 28 July, Austria-Hungary formally declared war against Serbia. On 29 July 1914, Nicholas II sent a telegram to Wilhelm II with the suggestion to submit the Austro-Serbian problem to the [[Hague Conference]] (in [[Permanent Court of Arbitration|Hague tribunal]]). Wilhelm II did not address the question of the Hague Conference in his subsequent reply.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hew Strachan]], ''The First World War, Vol I: To Arms'' (2001), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hamilton, Richard F. and Herwig, Holger H. (2003) ''Origins of World War One'', p. 514&lt;/ref&gt; Count Witte told the French Ambassador, [[Maurice Paléologue]] that from Russia's point of view the war was madness, Slav solidarity was simply nonsense and Russia could hope for nothing from the war.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 July, Russia ordered general mobilisation, but still maintained that it would not attack if peace talks were to begin. Germany, reacting to the discovery of Russian partial mobilisation ordered on 25 July, announced its own pre-mobilisation posture, the Imminent Danger of War. Germany requested that Russia must demobilise within the next twelve hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Josef und Ulli |url=http://www.geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/6916/ww1.htm |title=Germany during World War One |publisher= |date= |accessdate=7 September 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091018191920/http://geocities.com/Athens/Rhodes/6916/ww1.htm|archivedate=October 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Saint Petersburg]], at 7pm, with the ultimatum to Russia expired, the German ambassador to Russia met with the Russian Foreign Minister [[Sergey Sazonov]], asked three times if Russia would reconsider, and then with shaking hands, delivered the note accepting Russia's war challenge and declaring war on 1 August.  Less than a week later, on 6 August, [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] signed the Austro Hungarian declaration of war on Russia.

The outbreak of war on 1 August 1914 found Russia grossly unprepared. Russia and her allies placed their faith in her army, the famous 'Russian steamroller'.&lt;ref name="tames42"&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 42&lt;/ref&gt; Its pre-war regular strength was 1,400,000; mobilisation added 3,100,000 reserves and millions more stood ready behind them. In every other respect, however, Russia was unprepared for war. Germany had ten times as much railway track per square mile, and whereas Russian soldiers travelled an average of {{convert|1290|km|mi|-1}} to reach the front, German soldiers travelled less than a quarter of that distance. Russian heavy industry was still too small to equip the massive armies the Tsar could raise, and her reserves of munitions were pitifully small; while the German army in 1914 was better equipped than any other, man-for-man, the Russians were severely short on artillery pieces, shells, motorised transports, and even boots. With the Baltic Sea barred by German U-boats and the Dardanelles by the guns of Germany's ally, the [[Ottoman Empire]], Russia initially could receive help only via [[Arkhangelsk|Archangel]], which was frozen solid in winter, or via [[Vladivostok]], which was over {{convert|6400|km|mi}} from the front line. By 1915, a rail line was built north from [[Petrozavodsk]] to the Kola Gulf and this connection laid the foundation of the ice-free port of what eventually was called [[Murmansk]]. The Russian High Command was moreover greatly weakened by the mutual contempt between [[Vladimir Sukhomlinov]], the Minister of War, and the redoubtable warrior giant Grand Duke Nicholas Nikolayevich who commanded the armies in the field.&lt;ref name="tames42" /&gt; In spite of all of this, an immediate attack was ordered against the German province of [[East Prussia]]. The Germans mobilised there with great efficiency and completely defeated the two Russian armies which had invaded. The [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], where an entire Russian army was annihilated, cast an ominous shadow over the empire's future. The loyal officers lost were the very ones needed to protect the dynasty. The Russian armies had great success against both the Austro-Hungarian and Ottoman armies from the very beginning of the war, but they never succeeded against the might of the German Army. In September 1914, in order to relieve pressure on France, the Russians were forced to halt a successful offensive against Austria-Hungary in Galicia in order to attack German-held Silesia.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 309-310&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Russian prisoners tannenberg.jpg|thumb|upright=1.25|Russian prisoners at the [[Battle of Tannenberg (1914)|Battle of Tannenberg]], where the Russian Second Army was annihilated by German forces]]

Gradually a war of attrition set in on the vast [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]], where the Russians were facing the combined forces of the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires, and they suffered staggering losses. General Denikin, retreating from [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] wrote, "The German heavy artillery swept away whole lines of trenches, and their defenders with them. We hardly replied. There was nothing with which we could reply. Our regiments, although completely exhausted, were beating off one attack after another by bayonet ... Blood flowed unendingly, the ranks became thinner and thinner and thinner. The number of graves multiplied."&lt;ref name="tames46"&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 August, with the Russian army in retreat, [[Warsaw]] fell. Defeat at the front bred disorder at home. At first, the targets were German, and for three days in June shops, bakeries, factories, private houses and country estates belonging to people with German names were looted and burned.{{Citation needed|date=January 2011}}. The inflamed mobs then turned on the government, declaring the Empress should be shut up in a convent, the Tsar deposed and Rasputin hanged. Nicholas was by no means deaf to these discontents. An emergency session of the Duma was summoned and a Special Defense Council established, its members drawn from the Duma and the Tsar's ministers.

In July 1915, King [[Christian X of Denmark|Christian X]] of [[Denmark]], first cousin of the Tsar, sent [[Hans Niels Andersen]] to Tsarskoye Selo with an offer to act as a mediator. He made several trips between London, Berlin and Petrograd and in July saw the Dowager Empress [[Maria Feodorovna (Dagmar of Denmark)|Maria Fyodorovna]]. Andersen told her they should conclude peace. Nicholas chose to turn down King Christian's offer of mediation, as he felt it would be a betrayal for Russia to form a separate peace treaty with the Central Powers when its allies Britain and France were still fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, C (2006) ''Little Mother of Russia'', Holmes and Meier, {{ISBN|0841914222}}, p. 264&lt;/ref&gt;

The energetic and efficient General [[Alexei Polivanov]] replaced Sukhomlinov as [[Minister of War]], which failed to improve the strategic situation.&lt;ref name="tames42" /&gt; In the aftermath of the [[Great Retreat (Russia)|Great Retreat]] and the loss of the Kingdom of [[Poland]], Nicholas assumed the role of commander-in-chief after dismissing his cousin, [[Grand Duke Nicholas|Nikolay Nikolayevich]], in September 1915. This was a mistake, as the Tsar came to be personally associated with the continuing losses at the front. He was also away at the remote HQ at [[Mogilev]], far from the direct governance of the empire, and when revolution broke out in [[Petrograd]] he was unable to halt it. In reality the move was largely symbolic, since all important military decisions were made by his chief-of-staff General [[Michael Alexeiev]], and Nicholas did little more than review troops, inspect [[field hospital]]s, and preside over military luncheons.&lt;ref&gt;King, Greg and Wilson, Penny (2003) ''The Fate of the Romanovs'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|0471207683}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nicholas II with his family in Yevpatoria.jpg|thumb|upright=1.15|Nicholas II with his family in [[Yevpatoria]], [[Crimea]], May 1916]]

The Duma was still calling for political reforms and political unrest continued throughout the war. Cut off from public opinion, Nicholas could not see that the dynasty was tottering. With Nicholas at the front, domestic issues and control of the capital were left with his wife Alexandra. However, Alexandra's relationship with [[Grigori Rasputin]], and her German background, further discredited the dynasty's authority. Nicholas had been repeatedly warned about the destructive influence of Rasputin but had failed to remove him. Rumors and accusations about Alexandra and Rasputin appeared one after another; Alexandra was even accused of harboring treasonous sympathies towards Germany. Anger at Nicholas's failure to act and the extreme damage that Rasputin's influence was doing to Russia's war effort and to the monarchy led to Rasputin's eventual murder by a group of nobles, led by Prince [[Felix Yusupov]] and [[Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich of Russia|Grand Duke Dmitri Pavlovich]], a cousin of the Tsar, in the early morning of Saturday 17 December 1916 ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) / 30 December 1916 ([[New Style|N.S.]]).

===Collapse===
As the government failed to produce supplies, mounting hardship created massive riots and rebellions. With Nicholas away at the front from 1915 through 1916, authority appeared to collapse and the capital was left in the hands of strikers and mutineering conscript soldiers. Despite efforts by the British Ambassador [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|Sir George Buchanan]] to warn the Tsar that he should grant constitutional reforms to fend off revolution, Nicholas continued to bury himself away at the Staff HQ ([[Stavka]]) {{convert|600|km|mi|-2}} away at [[Mogilev|Moghilev]], leaving his capital and court open to intrigues and insurrection.&lt;ref name="tames52"&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 52&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1917, Russia was on the verge of total and utter collapse. The [[conscription|army had taken]] 15 million men from the farms and food prices had soared. An egg cost four times what it had in 1914, butter five times as much. The severe winter dealt the railways, overburdened by emergency shipments of coal and supplies, the final blow.&lt;ref name="tames52" /&gt;

Russia began the war with 20,000 [[Steam locomotive|locomotives]]; by 1917, 9,000 were in service, while the number of serviceable railway [[Wagon (railroad)|wagons]] had dwindled from half a million to 170,000. In February 1917, 1,200 locomotives burst their [[Fire-tube boiler|boilers]] and nearly 60,000 wagons were immobilised. In Petrograd, supplies of flour and fuel had all but disappeared.&lt;ref name="tames52" /&gt; War-time [[prohibition of alcohol]] was enacted by Nicholas to boost patriotism and productivity, but instead damaged the treasury and funding of the war due to the treasury now being deprived of alcohol taxes.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[[#Warth|Warth]], p. 199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nikolaus II. (Russland).jpg|thumb|upright=1.1|One of the last photographs of Nicholas II, showing him at [[Tsarskoye Selo]] after his abdication in March 1917]]

On 23 February 1917 in Petrograd, a combination of very severe cold weather and acute food shortages caused people to start to break shop windows to get bread and other necessities. In the streets, red banners appeared and the crowds chanted "Down with the German woman! Down with [[Alexander Protopopov|Protopopov]]! Down with the war! Down with the Tsar!"&lt;ref name="tames52" /&gt;

Police started to shoot at the populace from rooftops, which incited riots. The troops in the capital were poorly motivated and their officers had no reason to be loyal to the regime. They were angry and full of revolutionary fervor and sided with the populace.&lt;ref name="tames53"&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tsar's Cabinet begged Nicholas to return to the capital and offered to resign completely. The Tsar, 800 kilometres (500&amp;nbsp;mi) away, was misinformed by the Minister of the Interior, [[Alexander Protopopov]], that the situation was under control, and he ordered that firm steps be taken against the demonstrators. For this task, the Petrograd garrison was quite unsuitable. The cream of the old regular army had been destroyed in [[Poland]] and Galicia. In Petrograd, 170,000 recruits, country boys or older men from the working-class suburbs of the capital itself, remained to keep control under the command of wounded officers invalided from the front and cadets from the military academies. The units in the capital, although many bore the names of famous Imperial Guard regiments, were in reality rear or reserve battalions of these regiments, the regular units being away at the front. Many units, lacking both officers and rifles, had never undergone formal training.&lt;ref name="tames53" /&gt;

General Khabalov attempted to put the Tsar's instructions into effect on the morning of Sunday, 11 March 1917. Despite huge posters ordering people to keep off the streets, vast crowds gathered and were only dispersed after some 200 had been shot dead, though a company of the [[Volinsky Regiment]] fired into the air rather than into the mob, and a company of the Pavlovsky Life Guards shot the officer who gave the command to open fire. Nicholas, informed of the situation by Rodzianko, ordered reinforcements to the capital and suspended the Duma.&lt;ref name="tames53" /&gt; However, it was too late.

On 12 March, the [[Volinsky Regiment]] mutinied and was quickly followed by the [[Semenovsky Regiment|Semenovsky]], the [[Izmaylovsky Regiment|Ismailovsky]], the Litovsky and even the legendary [[Preobrazhensky Regiment]] of the Imperial Guard, the oldest and staunchest regiment founded by [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]]. The arsenal was pillaged, the Ministry of the Interior, Military Government building, police headquarters, the Law Courts and a score of police buildings were put to the torch. By noon, the fortress of Peter and Paul, with its heavy artillery, was in the hands of the insurgents. By nightfall, 60,000 soldiers had joined the revolution.&lt;ref name="tames53" /&gt;

Order broke down and members of the Duma and the [[Soviet (council)#Russian Revolution|Soviet]] formed a [[Russian Provisional Government|Provisional Government]] to try to restore order. They issued a demand that Nicholas must abdicate. Faced with this demand, which was echoed by his generals, deprived of loyal troops, with his family firmly in the hands of the Provisional Government and fearful of unleashing civil war and opening the way for German conquest, Nicholas had little choice but to submit.

====Abdication (1917)====
At the end of the "[[February Revolution]]" of 1917 (started in February on the Old Russian Calendar), Nicholas II chose to [[abdication|abdicate]] on 2 March ([[Old Style|O.S.]]) / 15 March ([[New Style|N.S.]]) 1917. He first abdicated in favour of Alexei, but a few hours later changed his mind after advice from doctors that the Tsarevich would not live long separated from his parents, who would be forced into exile. Nicholas thus abdicated on behalf of his son, and drew up a new manifesto naming his brother, [[Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich of Russia|Grand Duke Michael]], as the next Emperor of all the Russias. He issued the following statement (which was suppressed by the Provisional Government):

{{quote|In the days of the great struggle against the foreign enemies, who for nearly three years have tried to enslave our fatherland, the Lord God has been pleased to send down on Russia a new heavy trial. Internal popular disturbances threaten to have a disastrous effect on the future conduct of this persistent war. The destiny of Russia, the honor of our heroic army, the welfare of the people and the whole future of our dear fatherland demand that the war should be brought to a victorious conclusion whatever the cost. The cruel enemy is making his last efforts, and already the hour approaches when our glorious army together with our gallant allies will crush him. In these decisive days in the life of Russia, We thought it Our duty of conscience to facilitate for Our people the closest union possible and a consolidation of all national forces for the speedy attainment of victory. In agreement with the Imperial Duma We have thought it well to renounce the Throne of the Russian Empire and to lay down the supreme power. As We do not wish to part from Our beloved son, We transmit the succession to Our brother, the Grand Duke Michael Alexandrovich, and give Him Our blessing to mount the Throne of the Russian Empire. We direct Our brother to conduct the affairs of state in full and inviolable union with the representatives of the people in the legislative bodies on those principles which will be established by them, and on which He will take an inviolable oath. In the name of Our dearly beloved homeland, We call on Our faithful sons of the fatherland to fulfill their sacred duty to the fatherland, to obey the Tsar in the heavy moment of national trials, and to help Him, together with the representatives of the people, to guide the Russian Empire on the road to victory, welfare, and glory. May the Lord God help Russia!}}
Grand Duke Michael was proclaimed as "Emperor Michael II" to Russian troops and in cities throughout Russia, but his accession was not universally welcomed. While some units cheered and swore allegiance to the new Emperor, others remained indifferent.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, Rosemary; Crawford, Donald (1997) Michael and Natasha: The Life and Love of the Last Tsar of Russia, London: Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|978-0-7538-0516-9}}, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently declined to accept the throne until the people were allowed to vote through a Constituent Assembly for the continuance of the monarchy or a republic. The abdication of Nicholas II and Michael's deferment of accepting the throne brought three centuries of the Romanov dynasty's rule to an end. The fall of autocratic Tsardom brought joy to Liberals and Socialists in Britain and France. The United States of America was the [[Russian Provisional Government#World recognition|first foreign government]] to recognise the Provisional government. In Russia, the announcement of the Tsar's abdication was greeted with many emotions, including delight, relief, fear, anger and confusion.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;

===Imprisonment===
[[File:Tobolskhouse2.jpg|thumb|The Governor's Mansion in [[Tobolsk]], where the Romanov family was held in captivity between August 1917 and April 1918]]

Nicholas desperately wanted to go into exile in the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|United Kingdom]] following his abdication. The British government reluctantly offered the family asylum in the UK on 19 March 1917, although it was suggested that it would be better for the Romanovs to go to a neutral country. News of the offer provoked uproar from the Labour Party and many Liberals, and the British ambassador Sir [[George Buchanan (diplomat)|George Buchanan]] advised the government that the extreme left would use the ex-Tsar's presence "as an excuse for rousing public opinion against us".&lt;ref name="Massie, Robert K. 1967 p. 461"&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 461&lt;/ref&gt; The offer of asylum was withdrawn in April following objections by King [[George V]], who, acting on the advice of his secretary [[Arthur Bigge, 1st Baron Stamfordham]], was worried that Nicholas's presence in the UK might provoke an uprising like the previous year's [[Easter Rising]] in Ireland. The French government declined to accept the Romanovs in view of increasing unrest on the Western Front and on the home front as a result of the ongoing war with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Gareth Russell|title=The Emperors: How Europe's Rulers Were Destroyed by the First World War|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K4QFBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP164|year=2014|publisher=Amberley|pages=164–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rose, Kenneth ''King George V'' (1983) p. 210&lt;/ref&gt; The British ambassador in Paris, Lord [[Francis Bertie]], advised the Foreign Secretary that the Romanovs would be unwelcome in France as the ex-Empress was regarded as pro-German.&lt;ref name="Massie, Robert K. 1967 p. 461"/&gt;

In the early summer of 1917, after an improvement in the internal political situation in Russia, the Russian government approached the UK government on the issue of asylum and was informed the offer had been withdrawn due to the considerations of British internal politics.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; In August, the [[Alexander Kerensky|Kerensky]] government evacuated the Romanovs to [[Tobolsk]] in the Urals as a winter refuge to protect them from the rising tide of revolution, until the family could be sent abroad in the spring of 1918 via Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 487&lt;/ref&gt; There they lived in the former Governor's Mansion in considerable comfort. In October 1917, however, the [[Bolsheviks]] seized power from Kerensky's Provisional Government; Nicholas followed the events in October with interest but not yet with alarm. [[Boris Soloviev]], the husband of [[Maria Rasputin]], was supposedly organizing rescue attempts with monarchical factions, but none occurred. Rumors persist that Soloviev was working for the Bolsheviks or the Germans, or both.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 488-492&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas continued to underestimate Lenin's importance. In the meantime he and his family occupied themselves with keeping warm. Conditions of imprisonment became more strict, and talk of putting Nicholas on trial grew more frequent. The Tsar was forbidden to wear [[epaulette]]s.

On 1 March 1918, the family was placed on soldier's rations, which meant parting with ten devoted servants and giving up butter and coffee as luxuries. Nicholas and Alexandra were appalled by news of the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]], whereby Russia agreed to give up Poland, Finland, the Baltic States, the Ukraine, the Crimea and most of the Caucasus.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 493-494&lt;/ref&gt; What kept the family's spirits up was the belief that help was at hand.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Tames|Tames]], p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; The Romanovs believed that various plots were underway to break them out of captivity and smuggle them to safety. The Western Allies lost interest in the fate of the Romanovs after Russia left the war. The German government wanted the monarchy restored in Russia to crush the Bolsheviks and maintain good relations with the Central Powers.&lt;ref&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra: The Last Tsar and His Family'' (1967) p. 502-505&lt;/ref&gt; But on 30 April 1918 the Romanovs were transferred to their final destination: the town of [[Yekaterinburg]], where they were imprisoned in the two-storey [[Ipatiev House]], the home of the military engineer Nikolay Nikolayevich Ipatiev, which ominously became referred to as the "house of special purpose".

=== Execution ===
{{See also|Execution of the Romanov family}}
[[File:Family Nicholas II of Russia ca. 1914.jpg|thumb|upright=1.75|Russian imperial family (between circa 1913 and circa 1914)]]

There are several accounts of what happened and historians have not agreed on a solid, confirmed scope of events. According to the account of [[Yakov Yurovsky|Yurovsky]] (the chief executioner), in the early hours of 17 July 1918, the royal family was awakened around 2:00 am, got dressed, and were led down into a half-basement room at the back of the Ipatiev house. The pretext for this move was the family's safety, i.e. that anti-Bolshevik forces were approaching Yekaterinburg, and the house might be fired upon.&lt;ref name="Nicholas 1998"&gt;''Nicholas &amp; Alexandra – The Last Imperial Family of Tsarist Russia'', Booth-Clibborn Editions, 1998, {{ISBN|1861540388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Present with Nicholas, Alexandra and their children were their doctor and three of their servants, who had voluntarily chosen to remain with the family: the Tsar's personal physician [[Eugene Botkin]], his wife's maid [[Anna Demidova]], and the family's chef, [[Ivan Kharitonov]], and footman, [[Alexei Trupp]]. A firing squad had been assembled and was waiting in an adjoining room, composed of seven Communist soldiers from Central Europe, and three local Bolsheviks, all under the command of Bolshevik officer [[Yakov Yurovsky]].&lt;ref name="Nicholas 1998" /&gt;

Nicholas was carrying his son. When the family arrived in the basement, the former empress complained that there were no chairs for them to sit on. {{Citation needed|date=August 2011}} Yurovsky ordered two chairs brought in, and when the empress and the heir were seated, the executioners filed into the room. Yurovsky announced to them that the Ural Soviet of Workers' Deputies had decided to execute them. A stunned Nicholas asked, "What? What?" and turned toward his family. Yurovsky quickly repeated the order and Nicholas said, according to Peter Ermakov, "You know not what you do."

The executioners drew handguns and began shooting; Nicholas was the first to die. Yurovsky took afterwards credit for firing the first shot that killed the Tsar, but his protege – Grigory Nikulin – said years later that Mikhail Medvedev had fired the shot that killed Nicholas. "He fired the first shot. He killed the Tsar," he said in 1964 in a tape-recorded statement for the radio.&lt;ref&gt;Radzinsky p. 431&lt;/ref&gt; Nicholas was shot several times in the chest (sometimes incorrectly said to have been shot in his head, but his skull bore no bullet wounds when it was discovered in 1991). Anastasia, Tatiana, Olga, and Maria survived the first hail of bullets; the sisters were wearing over 1.3 kilograms of diamonds and precious gems sewn into their clothing, which provided some initial protection from the bullets and bayonets.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; First they were stabbed with bayonets and then shot at close range in their heads.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

An announcement from the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet of the Workers' and Peasants' Government emphasized that conspiracies had been exposed to free the ex-tsar, that counter-revolutionary forces were pressing in on Soviet Russian territory, and that the ex-tsar was guilty of unforgivable crimes against the nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Alexander, Robert |title=The Kitchen Boy: A Novel of the Last Tsar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l0z8GNUhOqoC|date=2003|publisher=Penguin Group US|isbn=978-1-101-20036-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In view of the enemy's proximity to Yekaterinburg and the exposure by the Cheka of a serious White Guard plot with the goal of abducting the former Tsar and his family… In light of the approach of counterrevolutionary bands toward the Red capital of the Urals and the possibility of the crowned executioner escaping trial by the people (a plot among the White Guards to try to abduct him and his family was exposed and the compromising documents will be published), the Presidium of the Ural Regional Soviet, fulfilling the will of the Revolution, resolved to shoot the former Tsar, Nikolai Romanov, who is guilty of countless, bloody, violent acts against the Russian people.&lt;ref&gt;Telegraph quoted in [https://books.google.com/books?id=l0z8GNUhOqoC ''The Kitchen Boy''] by Robert Alexander (unpaginated).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1981, Nicholas and his immediate family were [[Canonization|recognised]] as [[martyr]]ed [[saint]]s by the [[Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia]]. On 14 August 2000, they were recognised by the [[synod]] of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. This time they were not named as martyrs, since their deaths did not result immediately from their Christian faith; instead, they were canonized as [[passion bearer]]s. According to a statement by the Moscow synod, they were glorified as saints for the following reasons:

{{quote|In the last Orthodox Russian monarch and members of his family we see people who sincerely strove to incarnate in their lives the commands of the Gospel. In the suffering borne by the Royal Family in prison with humility, patience, and meekness, and in their martyrs' deaths in Yekaterinburg in the night of 17 July 1918 was revealed the light of the faith of Christ that conquers evil.}}

However, Nicholas's canonization was controversial. The Russian Orthodox Church Abroad was split on the issue back in 1981, some members suggesting that the emperor was a weak ruler and had failed to thwart the rise of the Bolsheviks. It was pointed out by one priest that martyrdom in the Russian Orthodox Church has nothing to do with the martyr's personal actions but is instead related to why he or she was killed.&lt;ref name="Massie"&gt;[[#Massie1995|Massie (1995)]] pp. 134–135.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian Orthodox Church inside Russia rejected the family's classification as martyrs because they were not killed on account of their religious faith. Religious leaders in both churches also had objections to canonising the Tsar's family because they perceived him as a weak emperor whose incompetence led to the revolution and the suffering of his people and made him partially responsible for his own murder and those of his wife, children and servants. For these opponents, the fact that the Tsar was, in private life, a kind man and a good husband and father or a leader who showed genuine concern for the peasantry did not override his poor governance of Russia.&lt;ref name="Massie" /&gt;

Despite the original opposition, the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] inside Russia ultimately recognised the family as "passion bearers," or people who met their deaths with Christian humility.

==Assessment==
Historian Raymond Esthus states:
: The contemporary assessments of Nicholas are remarkably uniform. He was described as shy, charming, gentle in disposition, fearful of controversy, indecisive, indulgent to his relatives, and deeply devoted to his family. Aleksandr Mosolov, who headed his Court Chancellery for sixteen years, wrote that Nicholas, though intelligent and well-educated, never adopted a definite, energetic attitude and loathed making a decision in the presence of others. Sergei Witte, who served Nicholas and his father for eleven years as Minister of Finance, commented that the Tsar was a well-intentioned child, but his actions were entirely dependent upon the character of his counselors, most of whom were bad.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond A. Esthus, "Nicholas II and the Russo-Japanese War" ''Russian Review'' 40#4 (1981), pp. 396-411 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/129919  online]&lt;/ref&gt;

Nicholas is generally considered to have been incompetent at the colossal task of ruling the enormous Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;Ferro, Marc (1995) ''Nicholas II: Last of the Tsars''. New York: Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0-19-508192-7}}, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Historian [[Barbara Tuchman]] gives a damning evaluation of his reign:

{{quote|[The Russian Empire] was ruled from the top by a sovereign who had but one idea of government—to preserve intact the absolute monarchy bequeathed to him by his father—and who, lacking the intellect, energy or training for his job, fell back on personal favorites, whim, simple mulishness, and other devices of the empty-headed autocrat. His father, Alexander III, who deliberately intended to keep his son uneducated in statecraft until the age of thirty, unfortunately miscalculated his own life expectancy, and died when Nicholas was twenty-six. The new Tsar had learned nothing in the interval, and the impression of imperturbability he conveyed was in reality apathy—the indifference of a mind so shallow as to be all surface. When a telegram was brought to him announcing the annihilation of the Russian fleet at Tsushima, he read it, stuffed it in his pocket, and went on playing tennis.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Barbara W. ''[[The Guns of August]].'' New York: Presidio Press, 1962, p.71.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Russia, Nicholas II faced widespread criticism after the victory of the Revolution. Pavel Bykov, who in Russia wrote the first full account about the downfall of the Tsar, denounced Nicholas as a "tyrant, who paid with his life for the age-old repression and arbitrary rule of his ancestors over the Russian people, over the impoverished and blood-soaked country". Soviet-era historians noted that Nicholas II was not fit to be a statesman. It has been argued that he had a weak will and was manipulated by adventurist forces. His regime was condemned for extensive use of the army, police, and courts to destroy the revolutionary movement. He was criticised for fanning nationalism and chauvinism. With the punitive expeditions and courts-martial during the 1905 Revolution, the monarch became known as "Nicholas the Bloody". Nicholas's reign was seen as a time of suffering for Russians.&lt;ref name="Kallistov"&gt;{{cite book|author=Kallistov, D. P. |title=History of the USSR in Three Parts: From the earliest times to the Great October Socialist Revolution |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qAFBAAAAYAAJ |year=1977 |publisher=Progress Publishers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert K. Massie]] provides a more sympathetic view of the Tsar:

{{quote| ... there still are those who for political or other reasons continue to insist that Nicholas was "Bloody Nicholas". Most commonly, he is described as shallow, weak, stupid—a one-dimensional figure presiding feebly over the last days of a corrupt and crumbling system. This, certainly, is the prevailing public image of the last Tsar. Historians admit that Nicholas was a "good man"—the historical evidence of personal charm, gentleness, love of family, deep religious faith and strong Russian patriotism is too overwhelming to be denied—but they argue that personal factors are irrelevant; what matters is that Nicholas was a bad tsar&amp;nbsp;.... Essentially, the tragedy of Nicholas II was that he appeared in the wrong place in history.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Massie1967|Massie (1967)]] pp. viii–x.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Nicholas II was granted honorary senior rank in a number of foreign armies, reciprocating by extending similar distinctions to a number of his fellow monarchs. These included the Imperial German, Spanish, Italian, Danish and British armies.

He was [[Colonel-in-Chief]] of the [[Royal Scots Greys]] from 1894 until his death. On becoming Colonel-in-Chief he presented the Regiment with a white [[bearskin]], now worn by the bass drummer of the Pipes and Drums of the [[Royal Scots Dragoon Guards]]. The Imperial Russian anthem is still played at dinner nights in the Officers' Mess, where there remains a portrait of the Tsar in Scots Greys uniform. Since his death, the Regiment has worn a black backing behind its cap badge as a symbol of mourning.

== Wealth ==
Estimates of Nicholas II's personal wealth have been vastly exaggerated. As ''Emperor of All The Russias'', and an autocrat, the resources under his command were virtually incalculable. However, the vast majority of this was owned by the state as Crown property; the Romanov family's ''personal wealth'' was only a small fraction of this. As monarch, the income of Nicholas was 24 million gold [[Ruble|roubles]] per annum: this derived from a yearly allowance from the Treasury, and from the profits of Crown farmland.&lt;ref name="Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64"&gt;Massie, Robert K. ''Nicholas and Alexandra'', New York, Atheneum, 1967, p64&lt;/ref&gt; From this income, he had to fund staff, the upkeep of imperial palaces and imperial theatres, annuities for the royal family, pensions, bequests, and other outgoings. "Before the end of the year, the Tsar was usually penniless; sometimes he reached this embarrassing state by autumn."&lt;ref name="Massie, Robert K. 1967, p64"/&gt; According to the Grand Marshal of the Court, Count Paul Benckendorff, the family's total financial resources amounted to between 12.5 and 17.5 million roubles.&lt;ref&gt;Clarke, William ''The Lost Fortune of the Tsars'', St. Martin's Griffin; Reprint edition, 1996, p101.&lt;/ref&gt; As a comparison, Prince Felix Yussupov estimated his family's worth in real estate holdings alone as amounting to 50 million gold roubles.&lt;ref&gt;Ferrand, Jacques ''Les Princes Youssoupoff &amp; les comtes Soumarkoff Elston'', Paris 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

== Documentaries and films ==
{{See also|List of films about the Romanovs}}
Several films about Nicholas II and his family have been made, including ''[[Anastasia (1956 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1956), ''[[Nicholas and Alexandra]]'' (1971), ''[[Anastasia: The Mystery of Anna]]'' (1986), ''[[Rasputin: Dark Servant of Destiny]]'' (1996 [[HBO]]), ''[[Anastasia (1997 film)|Anastasia]]'' (1997), and two Russian adaptations ''[[Assassin of the Tsar]]'' (1991) and ''[[The Romanovs: An Imperial Family]]'' (2000).

==Note==
* {{note|dates|O.S./N.S.}}Over the course of Nicholas's life, two calendars were used: the [[Old Style and New Style dates|Old Style]] [[Julian Calendar]] and the [[Old Style and New Style dates|New Style]] [[Gregorian Calendar]]. Russia switched from the Julian to the Gregorian calendar on 1 February (O.S.) / 14 February (N.S.) 1918.

The '''Iraqi Popular Army''' also known as the '''People's Army''' or '''People's Militia'''  (Arabic: الجيش الشعبي ''Al Jaysh ash Shaabi'') was a [[paramilitary]] organization composed of civilian volunteers to protect the Ba'ath regime against internal opposition and serve as a counterbalance against any coup attempt by the regular [[Iraqi Army]].&lt;ref name="globalsecurity_IPA" /&gt;

In 1987, the People's Army, standing at an estimated 650,000, approached the regular armed forces' manpower strength.

==History==
Officially, it was the Iraqi Baath Party Militia and included a special youth section. Formed in 1970, the People's Army grew rapidly, and by 1977 it was estimated to have 50,000 active members. Subsequently, a phenomenal growth, giving the militia extensive internal security functions, occurred. Whereas its original purpose was to give the Baath Party an active role in every town and village, the People's Army in 1981 began its most ambitious task to date, the support of the regular armed forces.

The official functions of the People's Army were to act as backup to the regular armed forces in times of war and to safeguard revolutionary achievements, to promote mass consciousness, to consolidate national unity, and to bolster the relationship between the people and the army in times of peace. The People's Army dispatched units to Iraqi Kurdistan before 1980 and to Lebanon to fight with Palestinian guerrillas during the 1975–76 Civil War. Foreign observers concluded, however, that the primary function of the People's Army was political in nature; first, to enlist popular support for the Baath Party, and second, to act as a counterweight against any coup attempts by the regular armed forces.

Beginning in 1974, [[Taha Yassin Ramadan]],&lt;ref name="bbcObituary"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/middle_east/2333287.stm |title=Obituary: Taha Yassin Ramadan |date=March 20, 2007 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=2007-03-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; a close associate of President [[Saddam Hussein]], commanded the People's Army, which was responsible for internal security. The command of such a large military establishment gave Ramadan so much power, however, that some foreign observers speculated that the primary function of his second in command was to keep him from using the People's Army as a personal power base.

People's Army members were recruited from among both women and men (who had completed their regular army service) eighteen years of age and older. It was unclear whether or not Baath Party membership was a prerequisite—especially after 1981 when the numerical strength of the People's Army ballooned—but, clearly, party indoctrination was at least as important as military training. Members usually underwent a two-month annual training period, and they were paid from party funds. Although the extent of their training was unknown in early 1988, all recruits were instructed in the use of a rifle. Graduates were responsible for guarding government buildings and installations, and they were concentrated around sensitive centers in major towns. Militia members possessed some sophisticated arms, and it was possible that disgruntled officers contemplating a challenge to Saddam Hussein could rally the support of a force of such militiamen.

The People's Army was sent into Iraqi Kurdistan before 1980 and even out of the country to such hot spots as Lebanon to fight with Palestinian guerrillas during the 1975–76 Civil War.&lt;ref name="globalsecurity_IPA" /&gt;

It was only dissolved when Taha Yassin Ramadan became [[Vice President of Iraq]] in 1991.

==Action seen==

===Al-Faw===
{{Main|First Battle of Al Faw}}
The '''First Battle of Al-Faw''', fought on February 11, 1986, was a battle of the [[Iran–Iraq War]]. The Iranians launched a surprise attack against the Iraqi troops defending the [[al-Faw Peninsula]]. The Iraqi units in charge of the defenses were mostly made up of poorly trained [[Military of Iraq|Iraqi Popular Army]] conscripts that collapsed when they were suddenly attacked by the Iranian [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Pasdaran]] (Revolutionary Guard) forces.

==Biography==
{{refimprove section|date=March 2011}}

[[File:Ramon Magsaysay teenager.jpg|thumb|upright=0.75|left|Magsaysay in his teenage years]]

Ramon del Fierro Magsaysay, of mixed [[Tagalog people|Tagalog]] and [[Ilocano people|Ilocano]] descent&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ilocanopride.blogspot.com/2007/11/our-ilocano-presidents.html|title=Ilocano Pride: Our Ilocano Presidents|first=|last=Mirokoto|date=November 8, 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, was born in [[Iba, Zambales]] on August 31, 1907 to Exequiel Magsaysay y de los Santos (April 18, 1874 in [[San Marcelino]], [[Zambales]] – January 24, 1969 in [[Manila]]), a blacksmith, and Perfecta del Fierro y Quimson (April 18, 1886 in [[Castillejos]], [[Zambales]] – May 5, 1981 in [[Manila]]), a schoolteacher.&lt;ref name="Reader's Digest"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ezequiel"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/126958168|title=Exequiel S Magsaysay|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Perfecta"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/126959545|title=Perfecta Q ''del Fierro'' Magsaysay|accessdate=August 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early life===
He spent his grade school life somewhere in [[Castillejos, Zambales|Castillejos]] and his high school life at Zambales Academy in San Narciso, Zambales. After high school, Magsaysay entered the [[University of the Philippines]] in 1927, where he enrolled in a pre-medical course.&lt;ref name="Reader's Digest"/&gt; He worked as a chauffeur to support himself as he studied engineering; and later, he transferred to the Institute of Commerce at [[José Rizal University|José Rizal College]] (1928–1932), where he received a baccalaureate in commerce. He then worked as an automobile mechanic in a bus company (Florida) and shop superintendent.&lt;ref name="Reader's Digest"/&gt;

====Career during World War II====
[[File:Ramon Magsaysay guerilla.jpg|thumb|left|Magsaysay as a guerrilla during the [[Second World War]]]]

At the outbreak of World War II, he joined the motor pool of the 31st Infantry Division of the [[Philippine Army]]. When [[Bataan]] surrendered in 1942, Magsaysay escaped to the hills, narrowly evading Japanese arrest on at least four occasions. There he organised the Western Luzon Guerrilla Forces, and was commissioned captain on April 5, 1942. For three years, Magsaysay operated under Col. Merrill's famed guerrilla outfit &amp; saw action at Sawang, [[San Marcelino, Zambales]], first as a supply officer codenamed ''Chow'' and later as commander of a 10,000 strong force.&lt;ref name="Reader's Digest"&gt;{{cite book|author=Manahan, Manuel P.|title=Reader's Digest November 1987 issue: Biographical Tribute to Ramon Magsaysay|publisher=|year=1987|isbn=|pages=17–23|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magsaysay was among those instrumental in clearing the Zambales coast of the Japanese prior to the landing of American forces together with the [[Philippine Commonwealth]] troops on January 29, 1945.

===Family===
He was married to [[Luz Magsaysay]] (''née'' Banzon) on June 16, 1933 and they had three children: Teresita "Sita" Banzon-Magsaysay (1934–1979), Milagros "Mila" Banzon-Magsaysay (b. 1936) and [[Ramon Magsaysay, Jr.|Ramon "Jun" Banzon-Magsaysay, Jr.]] (b. 1938).

====Relatives====
Several of Magsaysay's relatives became prominent public figures in their own right:
*[[Ramon Magsaysay, Jr.]], son; former Congressman and Senator
*[[Genaro Magsaysay]], brother; former Senator
*[[Vicente Magsaysay]], nephew; Congressman and former Governor of [[Zambales]]

On April 22, 1946, Magsaysay, encouraged by his ex-guerrillas, was elected under the Liberal Party&lt;ref name="Ramon Magsaysay 2008"/&gt; to the [[Philippine House of Representatives]]. In 1948, President [[Manuel Roxas]] chose Magsaysay to go to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] as Chairman of the Committee on Guerrilla Affairs, to help to secure passage of the Rogers Veterans Bill, giving benefits to Philippine veterans. In the so-called [[Philippine general election, 1949|"dirty election" of 1949]], he was re-elected to a second term in the House of Representatives. During both terms he was Chairman of the House National Defense Committee.

===Secretary of National Defense===
{{Refimprove section|date=March 2011}}
In early August 1950, he offered President [[Elpidio Quirino]] a plan to fight the Communist guerillas, using his own experiences in guerrilla warfare during World War II. After some hesitation, Quirino realized that there was no alternative and appointed Magsaysay Secretary of National Defence on August 31, 1950. He intensified the campaign against the [[Hukbalahap]] [[guerillas]]. This success was due in part to the unconventional methods he took up from a former advertising expert and CIA agent, Colonel [[Edward Lansdale]]. In the counterinsurgency the two utilized deployed soldiers distributing relief goods and other forms of aid to outlying, provincial communities. Prior to Magsaysay's appointment as Defense Secretary, rural citizens perceived the Philippine Army with apathy and distrust. However, Magsaysay's term enhanced the Army's image, earning them respect and admiration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Ladwig III, Walter C.|title="When the Police are the Problem: The Philippine Constabulary and the Huk Rebellion","|series=in C.

In June 1952, Magsaysay made a goodwill tour to the United States and Mexico. He visited [[New York City|New York]], [[Washington, D.C.]] (with a medical check-up at [[Walter Reed Hospital]]) and [[Mexico City]] where he spoke at the Annual Convention of [[Lions International]].

By 1953, President Quirino thought the threat of the Huks was under control and Secretary Magsaysay was becoming too weak. Magsaysay met with interference and obstruction from the President and his advisers, in fear they might be unseated at the next presidential election. Although Magsaysay had at that time no intention to run, he was urged from many sides and finally was convinced that the only way to continue his fight against communism, and for a government for the people, was to be elected president, ousting the corrupt administration that, in his opinion, had caused the rise of the communist guerrillas by bad administration. He resigned his post as defense secretary on February 28, 1953, and became the presidential candidate of the [[Nacionalista Party (Philippines)|Nacionalista Party]], disputing the nomination with senator [[Camilo Osías]] at the Nacionalista national convention.

====1951 Padilla incident====
[[File:Moises Padilla Story.jpg|thumb|right|Theatrical poster of the 1961 film ''The Moises Padilla Story'' that narrates the 1951 event.]] When news reached Magsaysay that his political ally [[Moises Padilla]] was being [[tortured]] by men of provincial governor Rafael Lacson, he rushed to [[Negros Occidental]], but was too late. He was then informed that Padilla's body was swimming in blood, pierced by fourteen bullets, and was positioned on a police bench in the town plaza.&lt;ref name="time 1954"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820089,00.html|title=THE PHILIPPINES: Justice for the Governor|date=September 6, 1954|work=Time Magazine|accessdate=February 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Magsaysay himself carried Padilla's corpse with his bare hands and delivered it to the [[morgue]], and the next day, news clips showed pictures of him doing so.&lt;ref name="Pimentel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mabuhayradio.com/content/view/430/51|title=Remembering President Ramón Magsaysay y Del Fierro: A Modern-Day Moses|accessdate=February 3, 2010}} A privileged speech by Senator [[Nene Pimentel]] delivered at the Senate, August 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; Magsaysay even used this event during his [[Philippine general election, 1953|presidential campaign in 1953]].

The trial against Lacson started in January 1952; Magsaysay and his men presented enough evidence to convict Lacson and his 26 men for murder.&lt;ref name="time 1954"/&gt; In August 1954,  Judge Eduardo Enríquez ruled the men were guilty and Lacson, his 22 men and three other mayors of Negros Occidental municipalities were condemned to the [[electric chair]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,820089-2,00.html|title=THE PHILIPPINES: Justice for the Governor|accessdate=February 3, 2010 | work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] | date=September 6, 1954}} Second page of ''Time''{{'}}s coverage of Rafael Lacson's case.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Presidential election of 1953====
Presidential elections were held on November 10, 1953 in the Philippines. Incumbent President [[Elpidio Quirino]] lost his opportunity for a second full term as [[President of the Philippines]] to former Defense Secretary Magsaysay. His running mate, [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[José Yulo]] lost to [[Senate of the Philippines|Senator]] [[Carlos P. García]]. [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]] [[Fernando López|Fernando Lopez]] did not run for re-election. This was the first time that an elected Philippine president did not come from the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]]. Moreover, Magsaysay started the practice in the Philippines of "campaign jingles" during elections, for one of his inclinations and hobbies was dancing.

The [[United States Government]], including the [[Central Intelligence Agency]], had a strong influence on the 1953 elections, and candidates in the election fiercely competed with each other for U.S. support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Cullather, Nick|title=Illusions of influence: the political economy of United States-Philippines relations, 1942–1960|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=1994|isbn=978-0-8047-2280-3|pages=108–109|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Gtj94zEWL_8C&amp;pg=PA108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ramon Magsaysay inauguration.jpg|thumb|Ramon Magsaysay swears in as the 7th President of the Philippines on December 30, 1953]]

In the [[Philippine general election, 1953|Election of 1953]], Magsaysay was decisively elected president over the incumbent [[Elpidio Quirino]]. He was sworn into office wearing the [[Barong Tagalog]], a first by a Philippine president. He was then called "Mambo Magsaysay".

As president, he was a close friend and supporter of the United States and a vocal spokesman against communism during the [[Cold War]]. He led the foundation of the [[Southeast Asia Treaty Organization]], also known as the Manila Pact of 1954, that aimed to defeat communist-Marxist movements in South East Asia, South Asia and the Southwestern Pacific.

During his term, he made [[Malacañan Palace|Malacañang]] literally a "house of the people", opening its gates to the public. One example of his integrity followed a demonstration flight aboard a new plane belonging to the [[Philippine Air Force]] (PAF): President Magsaysay asked what the operating costs per hour were for that type of aircraft, then wrote a personal check to the PAF, covering the cost of his flight. He restored the people's trust in the military and in the government.

Magsaysay's administration was considered one of the cleanest and most corruption-free in modern Philippines history; the period of his presidency is often cited as the Philippines's "Golden Years". Trade and industry flourished, the [[Philippine military]] was at its prime, and the country gained international recognition in sports, culture, and foreign affairs. The Philippines placed second on a ranking of Asia's clean and well-governed countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.muckingaroundmanila.com/malacanan-malacanang-interesting-palace-facts/|title=Malacañan or Malacañang?

=====President's Inauguration Day=====
Ushering a new era in [[Philippine government]], President Magsaysay placed emphasis upon service to the people by bringing the government closer to the former.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; This was symbollically seen when, on inauguration day, President Magsaysay ordered the gates of [[Malacañan Palace]] open to all and sundry, who were allowed to freely visit all the dependencies of the presidential mansion. Later, this was regulated to allow weekly visitation.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

True&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;  to his electoral promise, President Magsaysay created the Presidential Complaints and Action Committee.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; This body immediately proceeded to hear grievances and recommend remedial action. Headed by soft-spoken, but active and tireless, Manuel Manahan, this committee would come to hear nearly 60,000 complaints in a year, of which more than 30,000 would be settled by direct action and a little more than 25,000 would be referred to government agencies for appropriate follow-up. This new entity, composed of youthful personnel, all loyal to the President, proved to be a highly successful morale booster restoring the people's confidence in their own government. He Appointed Zotico Tex Paderanga Carrillo his Close Aide and Secretary 1953, as PCAC Chief for Mindanao and Sulu, he became a close friend to the president because of his charisma to the Common people of Mindanao. Zotico is a local Journalist and an esteemed writer from a Prominent Family in Camiguin Island, Misamis Oriental, Zotico become a depository of complaints and an eye of the president in the region his diplomatic skills became a passage for the government, moro and the rebels to hear the real situation in every city and municipalities. with his zero curruption mandate he recognise a turn of achievement of Zotico that made him his compadre when Zotico named his 5th child after the President when he won the Election in 1953 Ramon Magsaysay P. Carrillo became one of the many God children of the president. President Magsaysay also Visited Mindanao several times because of this Friendship he is the first President visited Camiguin Island. Where thousand of people waited for his arrival in one of the Port in Camiguin Island. &lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

President Ramon F. Magsaysay was the first president who regularly wore the Barong Tagalog (national costume). He set an example of humility by insisting that he be called "Mr. President" and not "His Excellency".  (Ryan A. Gragasin)

=====Agrarian reform=====
{{See also|Land reform in the Philippines}}

To amplify and stabilize the functions of the Economic Development Corps (EDCOR), President Magsaysay worked&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; for the establishment of the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA).&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; This body took over from the EDCOR and helped in the giving some sixty-five thousand acres to three thousand indigent families for settlement purposes.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; Again, it allocated some other twenty-five thousand to a little more than one thousand five hundred landless families, who subsequently became [[farmers]].&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

As further aid to the rural people,&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; the president established the Agricultural Credit and Cooperative Financing Administration (ACCFA). The idea was for this entity to make available rural credits. Records show that it did grant, in this wise, almost ten million dollars. This administration body next devoted its attention to cooperative marketing.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

Along this line of help to the rural areas, President Magsaysay initiated in all earnestness the [[Artesian well|artesian wells]] campaign. A group-movement known as the Liberty Wells Association was formed and in record time managed to raise a considerable sum for the construction of as many artesian wells as possible. The socio-economic value of the same could not be gainsaid and the people were profuse in their gratitude.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

Finally, vast irrigation projects, as well as enhancement of the Ambuklao Power plant and other similar ones, went a long way towards bringing to reality the rural improvement program advocated by President Magsaysay.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;[[Image:President Magsaysay at his study at Malacañang Palace c.1953.jpg|300px|thumb|left|President Ramon Magsaysay at the Presidential Study, Malacañan Palace.]]

President Ramon Magsaysay enacted the following laws as part of his Agrarian Reform Program:
* Republic Act No. 1160 of 1954—Abolished the LASEDECO and established the National Resettlement and Rehabilitation Administration (NARRA) to resettle dissidents and landless farmers. It was particularly aimed at rebel returnees providing home lots and farmlands in Palawan and Mindanao.
* Republic Act No. 1199 (Agricultural Tenancy Act of 1954) – governed the relationship between landowners and tenant farmers by organizing share-tenancy and leasehold system. The law provided the security of tenure of tenants. It also created the Court of Agrarian Relations.
* Republic Act No. 1400 (Land Reform Act of 1955) – Created the Land Tenure Administration (LTA) which was responsible for the acquisition and distribution of large tenanted rice and corn lands over 200 hectares for individuals and 600 hectares for corporations.
* Republic Act No. 821 (Creation of Agricultural Credit Cooperative Financing Administration) – Provided small farmers and share tenants loans with low interest rates of six to eight percent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dar.gov.ph/ar_history.html Department of Agrarian Reform (DAR) – Organizational Chart]&lt;/ref&gt;

=====HUKBALAHAP=====
In early 1954, [[Benigno Aquino, Jr.]] was appointed by President Ramon Magsaysay to act as personal emissary to [[Luis Taruc|Luís Taruc]], leader of the rebel group, [[Hukbalahap]]. Also in 1954, Lt. Col. Laureño Maraña, the former head of Force X of the 16th PC Company, assumed command of the 7th BCT, which had become one of the most mobile striking forces of the Philippine ground forces against the Huks, from Colonel Valeriano. Force X employed psychological warfare through combat intelligence and infiltration that relied on secrecy in planning, training, and execution of attack. The lessons learned from Force X and Nenita were combined in the 7th BCT.

With the all out anti-dissidence campaigns against the Huks, they numbered less than 2,000 by 1954 and without the protection and support of local supporters, active Huk resistance no longer presented a serious threat to Philippine security. From February to mid-September 1954, the largest anti-Huk operation, "Operation Thunder-Lightning" was conducted that resulted in the surrender of Luis Taruc on 17 May. Further cleanup operations of the remaining guerillas lasted throughout 1955, diminishing its number to less than 1,000 by year's end.&lt;ref&gt;Carlos P. Romulo and Marvin M. Gray, The Magsaysay Story (1956), is a full-length biography&lt;/ref&gt;

====Foreign policies====
[[File:Magsaysay Roosevelt.jpg|thumb|right|280px|[[Eleanor Roosevelt]] with President Ramon Magsaysay and then First Lady [[Luz Magsaysay]] of the Philippines in Manila]]

=====SEATO=====
The administration of President Magsaysay was active in the fight against the expansion of communism in the Asian region. He made the Philippines a member of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization ([[SEATO]]), which was established in Pepe Land on September 8, 1954 during the "Manila Conference".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/357732/Ramon-Magsaysay|title=Ramon Magsaysay - president of Philippines|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of SEATO were alarmed at the possible victory of [[North Vietnam]] over [[South Vietnam]], which could spread communist ideology to other countries in the region. The possibility that a communist state can influence or cause other countries to adopt the same system of government is called the [[domino theory]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Grace Estela C. Mateo: Philippine Civilization – History and Government, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The active coordination of the Magsaysay administration with the Japanese government led to the Reparation Agreement. This was an agreement between the two countries, obligating  the Japanese government to pay $550 million as reparation for war damages in the Philippines.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=====Defense Council=====
Taking the advantage of the presence of U.S. Secretary [[John Foster Dulles]] in [[Manila]] to attend the [[SEATO]] Conference, the Philippine government took steps to broach with him the establishment of a Joint Defense Council. Vice-President and Secretary of Foreign Affairs [[Carlos P. Garcia]] held the opportune conversations with Secretary Dulles for this purpose. Agreement was reached thereon and the first meeting of the Joint United States-Philippines Defense Council was held in Manila following the end of the Manila Conference. Thus were the terms of the Mutual Defense Pact between the [[Philippines]] and the United States duly implemented.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

=====Laurel-Langley Agreement=====
[[Image:Sen Primicias in Malacanang.jpg|thumb|left|280px|'''[[Malacañang Palace|At Malacañang Palace]], 1955.''' ''Clockwise, from top left:'' Senator Edmundo Cea, Former President José P. Laurel Sr., Senator Primicias, Senate President [[Eulogio Rodriguez|Eulogio A. Rodriguez, Sr.]], President Ramon F. Magsaysay, &amp; House Speaker José B. Laurel Jr.]]
The Magsaysay administration negotiated the Laurel-Langley Agreement which was a trade agreement between the [[Philippines]] and the United States which was signed in 1955 and expired in 1974. Although it proved deficient, the final agreement satisfied nearly  all of the diverse Filipino economic interests. While some have seen the Laurel-Langley agreement as a continuation of the 1946 trade act, [[Jose P. Laurel]] and other Philippine leaders recognized that the agreement substantially gave the country greater freedom to industrialize while continuing to receive privileged access to US  markets.&lt;ref&gt;Illusions of influence: the political economy of United States-Philippines. By Nick Cullather&lt;/ref&gt;

The agreement replaced the unpopular [[Bell Trade Act]], which tied the economy of the Philippines to that of United States economy.

=====Bandung Conference=====
Billed as an all-[[Oriental]] meet to promote Afro-Asian economic and cultural cooperation and to oppose colonialism or neocolonialism by either the United States or the Soviet Union in the Cold War, or any other imperialistic nations, the [[Asian–African Conference]] was held in [[Bandung]] ([[Java]]) in April 1955, upon invitation extended by the Prime Ministers of [[India]], Pakistan, [[Burma]], [[Ceylon]], and [[Indonesia]]. The conference is commonly known as the Bandung Conference. Although, at first, the Magsaysay Government seemed reluctant to send any delegation. Later, however, upon advise of Ambassador [[Carlos P. Rómulo]], it was decided to have the Philippines participate in the conference. Rómulo was asked to head the Philippine delegation.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; At the very outset indications were to the effect that the conference would promote the cause of neutralism as a third position in the current [[cold war]] between the capitalist bloc and the communist group. [[John Kotelawala]], Prime Minister of Ceylon, however, broke the ice against neutralism.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; He was immediately joined by Rómulo, who categorically stated that his delegation believed that "a puppet is a puppet",&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; no matter whether under a Western Power or an Oriental state.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

At one time in the course of the conference, Indian Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] acidly spoke against the [[SEATO]]. Quick to draw, Ambassador Rómulo delivered a stinging, eloquent retort that prompted Prime Minister Nehru to publicly apologize to the Philippine delegation.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

Records had it that the Philippine delegation ably represented the interests of the Philippines and, in the ultimate analysis, succeeded in turning the Bandung Conference into a  victory against the plans of its socialist and neutralist delegates.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

=====Reparation agreement=====
Following the reservations made by Ambassador Romulo, on the Philippines behalf, upon signing the Japanese Peace Treaty in San Francisco on September 8, 1951, for several years of series of negotiations were conducted by the Philippine government and that of Japan. In the face of adamant claims of the Japanese government that it found impossible to meet the demand for the payment of eight billion dollars by the way of reparations, president Magsaysay, during a so-called "cooling off"&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; period, sent a Philippine Reparations Survey Committee, headed by Finance Secretary Jaime Hernandez, to Japan for an "on the spot" study of that country's possibilities.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;
 
When the Committee reported that Japan was in a position to pay, Ambassador Felino Neri, appointed chief negotiator, went to Tokyo. On May 31, 1955, Ambassador Neri reached a compromise agreement with Japanese Minister Takazaki, the main terms of which consisted in the following: The Japanese government would pay eight hundred million dollars as reparations. Payment was to be made in this wise: Twenty million dollars would be paid in cash in Philippine currency; thirty million dollars, in services; five million dollars, in capital goods; and two hundred and fifty million dollars, in long-term industrial loans.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

On August 12, 1955, President Magsaysay informed the Japanese government, through Prime Minister [[Ichiro Hatoyama]], that the Philippines accepted the Neri-Takazaki agreement.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt; In view of political developments in Japan, the Japanese Prime Minister could only inform the Philippine government of the Japanese acceptance of said agreement on March 15, 1956. The official Reparations agreement between the two government was finally signed at [[Malacañang Palace]] on May 9, 1956, thus bringing to a rather satisfactory conclusion this long drawn controversy between the two countries.&lt;ref name="Molina, Antonio 1961"/&gt;

[[File:Pres. Ramon Magsaysay monument in Mt. Manunggal, Balamban, Cebu.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Monument at the crash site in Manunggal, Balamban, Cebu]]
Magsaysay's term, which was to end on December 30, 1957, was cut short by a plane crash. On March 16, 1957, Magsaysay left Manila for [[Cebu City]] where he spoke at three educational institutions. That same night, at about 1&amp;nbsp;am, he boarded the presidential plane "Mt. Pinatubo", a [[C-47 Skytrain|C-47]], heading back to [[Manila]]. In the early morning hours of March 17, the plane was reported missing. By late afternoon, newspapers had reported the airplane had crashed on Mt. Manunggal in Cebu, and that 36 of the 56 aboard were killed. The actual number on board was 25, including Magsaysay. Only newspaperman [[Néstor Mata]] survived. [[Carlos P. Garcia|Vice-President Carlos García]], who was on an official visit to [[Australia]] at the time, assumed the presidency to serve out the last eight months of Magsaysay's term.

In his tragic death, he was survived by his widow, First Lady [[Luz Magsaysay]] (1914–2004), then 43 years old alongside with his three grown-up children, daughters Teresita (1934–1979) then 23, Milagros (1936–), then aged 21 and his only son [[Ramon Magsaysay Jr.|Ramon 'Jun' Jr.]] (1938–), then aged 18, as well as his elderly parents, Exequiel and Perfecta Magsaysay who were both still living in their old ages of 83 and 71 at that time.

An estimated 2 million people attended Magsaysay's state funeral on March 22, 1957.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Zaide, Gregorio F. | title=Philippine History and Government|publisher=National Bookstore Printing Press |year=1984}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Townsend, William Cameron | title=Biography of President Lázaro Cárdenas | year=1952}}

'''Sir Richard Charles Nicholas Branson''' (born 18 July 1950) is an English [[business magnate]], investor, author and [[Philanthropy|philanthropist]].&lt;ref&gt;List of companies related to Richard Branson - http://www.flixens.com/director/richard-charles-nicholas-branson&lt;/ref&gt; He founded the [[Virgin Group]], which controls more than 400 companies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23897620-londons-1000-most-influential-people-2010-tycoons-and-retailers.do |title=London's 1000 most influential people 2010: Tycoons &amp; Retailers |work=Evening Standard |location=London |date=26 November 2010 |accessdate=11 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303202728/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard-home/article-23897620-londons-1000-most-influential-people-2010-tycoons-and-retailers.do |archivedate= 3 March 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson expressed his desire to become an entrepreneur at a young age. His first business venture, at the age of 16, was a magazine called ''Student''. In 1970, he set up a mail-order record business. He opened a chain of record stores, Virgin Records—later known as [[Virgin Megastores]]—in 1972. Branson's Virgin brand grew rapidly during the 1980s, as he set up [[Virgin Atlantic]] [[airline]] and expanded the [[Virgin Records]] [[music label]]. In 2004, he founded spaceflight corporation [[Virgin Galactic]], based at [[Mojave Air and Space Port]], noted for the [[SpaceShipTwo]] [[Sub-orbital spaceflight|suborbital]] [[spaceplane]] designed for [[space tourism]].

In March 2000, Branson was [[Orders, decorations, and medals of the United Kingdom|knighted]] at Buckingham Palace for "services to entrepreneurship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Virgin tycoon is knighted|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/695511.stm|agency=BBC|date=3 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; For his work in retail, music and transport (with interests in land, air, sea and space travel), his taste for adventure, and for his humanitarian work, he has become a prominent global figure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barling|first1=Julian|title=The SAGE Handbook of Organizational Behavior: Volume Two: Macro Approaches|publisher=SAGE|page=383}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thirty of the very best of British|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10050832/Thirty-of-the-very-best-of-British.html|agency=The Telegraph|date=13 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, he was placed in ''[[Time magazine]]'''s list of the [[Time 100|100 Most Influential People in The World]].

In June 2018, ''[[Forbes]]'' listed Branson's estimated net worth at [[United States dollar|US$]]5.1 billion.&lt;ref name="Richard Branson"/&gt;

==Early life==
Branson was born in [[Blackheath, London]], the eldest of three children of [[Eve Branson]] (''née'' Evette Huntley Flindt; born 1924), a former ballet dancer and air hostess, and Edward James Branson (1918–2011), a [[barrister]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/law-obituaries/8501350/Edward-Branson.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Edward Branson | date=8 May 2011}}&lt;br&gt;- "Births", ''[[The Times]]'', 12 July 1950, pg. 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fdnr1"&gt;[https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/finding-my-roots] ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', 2 February 2016, PBS&lt;/ref&gt; He has two younger sisters.&lt;ref name=SagaMar13&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.saga.co.uk/saga-magazine/2013/march/eve-branson.aspx|title=Like mother, like son|author=Nina Myskow|date=13 March 2013|publisher=Saga magazine|accessdate=5 November 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105104205/https://www.saga.co.uk/saga-magazine/2013/march/eve-branson.aspx|archivedate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather, the [[Right Honourable]] [[G. A. H. Branson|Sir George Arthur Harwin Branson]], was a judge of the [[High Court of Justice]] and a [[Privy Councillor]].&lt;ref&gt;"Forthcoming Marriages", ''[[The Times]]'', 22 June 1949, pg.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Branson was educated at [[Scaitcliffe School]], a [[Preparatory school (United Kingdom)|prep school]] in Surrey, before briefly attending Cliff View House School in [[Sussex]].&lt;ref name=TimesSep98&gt;Richard Branson. "At school I was dyslexic and a dunce.", ''The Times'', London, 11 September 1998, pg. 19&lt;/ref&gt;

His third great-grandfather, John Edward Branson, left England for [[India]] in 1793; John Edward's father, Harry Wilkins Branson, later joined him in [[Madras]]. On the show ''[[Finding Your Roots]]'', Branson was shown to have 3.9% South Asian (Indian) DNA, likely through intermarriage.&lt;ref name=fdnr1/&gt; He attended [[Stowe School]], an [[Independent school (United Kingdom)|independent school]] in [[Buckinghamshire]] until the age of sixteen.&lt;ref name=TimesSep98/&gt;

Branson has [[dyslexia]] and had poor academic performance; on his last day at school, his headmaster, [[Robert Drayson]], told him he would either end up in prison or become a millionaire.&lt;ref name=TimesSep98/&gt; Branson's parents were supportive of his endeavours from an early age.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shavinina|first=Larisa V|title=Micro-social factors in the development of entrepreneurial giftedness: the case of Richard Branson|journal=High Ability Studies|date=December 2006|volume=17|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; His mother was an entrepreneur; one of her most successful ventures was building and selling wooden tissue boxes and wastepaper bins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Virgin Way: Everything I know about leadership|last=Branson|first=Richard|publisher=Portfolio/Penguin|year=2014|isbn=|location=New York|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In London he started off [[squatting]] between 1967 and 1968.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/1999/jul/21/3|title=
Famous faces who took rent-free route|date=21 July 1999|publisher=Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early business career ==
After failed attempts to grow and sell both [[Christmas trees]] and [[budgerigars]], Branson launched his first successful business, a magazine named Student, in 1966. The first issue of ''Student'' appeared in January 1968, and a year later, Branson's net worth was estimated at £50,000. Branson started his record business from the church where he ran ''Student'' magazine. He interviewed several prominent personalities of the late 1960s for the magazine including [[Mick Jagger]] and [[R. D. Laing]].&lt;ref name="Branson2011"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWxnDythozIC|title=Losing My Virginity|author=Richard Branson|date=4 August 2011|publisher=Ebury Publishing|isbn=978-1-4464-8334-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson advertised popular records in ''Student'', and it was an overnight success.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-fails-virgin-companies-that-went-bust-2012-4?op=1|title=RICHARD BRANSON'S FAILS: 14 Virgin Companies That Went Bust|author=Mallory Russell|date=21 April 2012|publisher=[[Business Insider]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; His business sold records for considerably less than the "High Street" outlets, especially the chain [[W. H. Smith]]. Branson once said, "There is no point in starting your own business unless you do it out of a sense of frustration." At the time, many products were sold under restrictive marketing agreements that limited discounting, despite efforts in the 1950s and 1960s to limit so-called [[resale price maintenance]].&lt;ref&gt;Another example was the [[Net Book Agreement]], which limited the ability of book outlets, including discount book clubs, to offer deep discounts.&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson eventually started a record shop in [[Oxford Street]] in [[London]]. In 1971, he was questioned in connection with the selling of records that had been declared export stock. The matter was never brought before a court because Branson agreed to repay any unpaid VAT of 33% and a £70,000 fine. His parents re-mortgaged the family home in order to help pay the settlement.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Richard Branson – ''Losing my Virginity''&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Virgin''==
{{Main|Virgin Group|Timeline of Richard Branson's business ventures}}

===1972–1980: Founding of ''Virgin Records''===
[[File:The Manor Studios.jpg|thumb|[[The Manor Studio]], Richard Branson's [[recording studio]] in the [[manor house]] at the village of [[Shipton-on-Cherwell]] in [[Oxfordshire]].]]Earning enough money from his record store, Branson in 1972 launched the record label [[Virgin Records]] with [[Nik Powell]]. The name "Virgin" was suggested by one of Branson's early employees because they were all new at business.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Branson bought a country estate north of [[Oxford]] in which he installed a residential [[recording studio]], [[The Manor Studio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.biography.com/people/richard-branson-9224520|title=Richard Branson Biography|accessdate=16 September 2014|publisher=[[A&amp;E Television Networks]]|website=The Biography.com website}}&lt;/ref&gt; He leased studio time to fledgling artists, including multi-instrumentalist [[Mike Oldfield]], whose debut album ''[[Tubular Bells]]'' (1973) was the first release for Virgin Records and became a chart-topping best-seller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b03cw8g0|title=Tubular Bells: The Mike Oldfield Story|publisher=BBC|accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Virgin signed such controversial bands as the [[Sex Pistols]], which other companies were reluctant to sign. Virgin Records would go on to sign other artists including the [[Rolling Stones]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[XTC]], [[Japan (band)|Japan]], [[UB40]], [[Steve Winwood]] and [[Paula Abdul]], and to become the world's largest independent record label.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/197616|title=Richard Branson  The P.T. Barnum of British Business|last=|first=|date=2008|website=|publisher=|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also won praise for exposing the public to such obscure avant-garde music as [[Faust (band)|Faust]] and [[Can (band)|Can]]. Virgin Records also introduced [[Culture Club]] to the music world.

Branson's net worth was estimated at £5 million by 1979, and a year later, Virgin Records went international.

=== 1981–1987: Package holiday industries and ''Virgin Atlantic Airways'' success ===
Branson's first successful entry into the airline industry was during a trip to Puerto Rico. His flight was cancelled, so he decided to charter his own plane the rest of the way and offer a ride to the rest of the stranded passengers for a small fee in order to cover the cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-entrepreneur-visionary-2011-5/|title=Richard Branson: How a Cancelled Flight Led To The World's Greatest Travel Empire|last=Zeveloff|first=J|date=May 2011|website=|publisher=|access-date=18 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1982, Virgin purchased the gay nightclub [[Heaven (nightclub)|Heaven]]. In 1991, in a consortium with [[David Frost]], Branson made an unsuccessful bid for three [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] franchisees under the [[CPV-TV]] name. The early 1980s also saw his only attempt as a producer—on the novelty record "[[Baa, Baa, Black Sheep]]", by Singing Sheep in association with Doug McLean and Grace McDonald. The recording was a series of sheep baa-ing along to a drum-machine-produced track and reached number 42 in the UK charts in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://epnofny.com/epnmag/blog/2012/12/02/entrepreneur-guru-sir-richard-branson/ |title=Entrepreneur Guru Sir Richard Branson |publisher=EPN |date=2 December 2012 |accessdate=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson formed [[Virgin Atlantic Airways]] and Virgin Cargo in 1984. He formed [[Virgin Holidays]] in 1985.

=== 1988–2000: Telecoms ventures and worldwide impact ===
In 1992, to keep his airline company afloat, Branson sold the Virgin label to [[EMI]] for £500&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/3693588.stm|title=Profile: Richard Branson|date=27 September 2004|accessdate=3 May 2010|publisher=The BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson said that he wept when the sale was completed because the record business had been the very start of the Virgin empire. In 1993, Branson took what many saw as being one of his riskier business exploits by entering into the railway business. [[Virgin Trains]] won the franchises for the former [[Inter-city rail|Intercity]] [[West Coast Main Line|West Coast]] and Cross-Country sectors of [[British Rail]]. He created [[V2 Records]] in 1996 in order to re-enter the music business, owning 5% himself.&lt;ref name="solarnav"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.solarnavigator.net/sponsorship/richard_branson.htm|title=Richard Branson and Virgin-Probably Britains best known Entrepreneur|publisher=Solar Navigator.net|accessdate=3 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virgin also acquired European [[short-haul]] airline Euro Belgian Airlines and renamed it [[Virgin Express]].

A series of disputes in the early 1990s caused tension between Virgin Atlantic and [[British Airways]], which viewed Virgin as an emerging competitor. Virgin subsequently accused British Airways of poaching its passengers, [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] its computers, and leaking stories to the press that portrayed Virgin negatively. After the so-called campaign of "dirty tricks", British Airways settled the case, giving £500,000 to Branson, a further £110,000 to his airline, and had to pay legal fees of up to £3&amp;nbsp;million. Branson distributed his compensation (the so-called "BA bonus") among his staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/aug/02/theairlineindustry.britishairways|title=Row over dirty tricks led to decade of hostilities|author=Lee Glendinning|date=2 August 2007|work=The Guardian|accessdate=31 August 2011|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson launched [[Virgin Mobile]] in 1999, and [[Virgin Blue]] in Australia (now named [[Virgin Australia]]) in 2000.

=== 2001–2007: Entry into space travel and ''Virgin Media'' ===
On 25 September 2004, Branson announced the signing of a deal under which a new [[space tourism]] company, [[Virgin Galactic]], will license the technology behind [[SpaceshipOne]]—funded by [[Microsoft]] co-founder [[Paul Allen]] and designed by aeronautical engineer [[Burt Rutan]]—to take paying passengers into [[suborbital]] [[Outer space|space]]. Virgin Galactic (wholly owned by Virgin Group) plans to make flights available to the public with tickets priced at US$200,000 using the [[Scaled Composites White Knight Two]].&lt;ref name=sn20131111&gt;

In 2013, Branson said that he planned to take his two children, 31-year-old Holly and 28-year-old Sam, on a trip to outer space when they ride the SpaceShipTwo rocket plane on its first public flight, then planned for 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyle|first=Alan|title=First family of space: Richard Branson and kids will blaze new trail|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/first-family-space-richard-branson-kids-will-blaze-new-trail-8C11566225|publisher=NBC News|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of his promotion of the firm, Branson has added a variation of the Virgin Galactic livery to his personal business jet, the [[Dassault Falcon 900EX]] "Galactic Girl" (G-GALX).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gadling.com/2008/08/04/sir-richard-bransons-private-jet/ |title= Sir Richard Branson’s Private Jet |date= 4 August 2008 |author= Grant Martin |publisher= Gadling }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Windows Seat |url= http://www.traveldaily.com.au/photos/window-seat-2/194910 |date= 29 January 2011 |work= Window Seat |publisher= Travel Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was ninth in [[Sunday Times Rich List|''The Sunday Times'' Rich List 2006]] of the wealthiest people or families in the UK, worth slightly more than £3&amp;nbsp;billion. Branson wrote in his autobiography of the decision to start an airline.

{{quote|My interest in life comes from setting myself huge, apparently unachievable challenges and trying to rise above them ... from the perspective of wanting to live life to the full, I felt that I had to attempt it.|sign=|source=}}

In 2006, the airline was merged with [[SN Brussels Airlines]] forming [[Brussels Airlines]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/business/news/virgin-express-creates-brussels-airline-566542.html|title=Virgin Express creates Brussels airline|date=17 March 2004|work=The Independent|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also started a national airline based in Nigeria, called [[Virgin Nigeria]], which ceased operations in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/8089858.stm|title=Virgin to sell Nigerian airline|date=8 June 2009|access-date=4 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another airline, [[Virgin America]], began flying out of [[San Francisco International Airport]] in August 2007.

Branson's next venture with the Virgin group was [[Virgin Fuels]], which was set up to respond to [[global warming]] and exploit the recent spike in fuel costs by offering a revolutionary, cheaper fuel for automobiles and, in the near future, aircraft. Branson has stated that he was formerly a [[Climate change denial|global warming sceptic]] and was influenced in his decision by a breakfast meeting with [[Al Gore]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/GMA/story?id=2477400 |title=ABC News: Breakfast With Al Gore Persuades Branson to Pledge Billions to Global Warming |publisher=ABC News |date=22 September 2006 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 September 2006, Branson pledged to invest the profits of Virgin Atlantic and Virgin Trains in research for environmentally-friendly fuels. The investment is estimated to be worth $3&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefirstpost.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=770 | title=Come fly with me, come give it away | accessdate=23 September 2006 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65U04AmZI?url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/index.php?menuID=1&amp;subID=770 | archivedate=16 February 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On 4 July 2006, Branson sold his [[Virgin Mobile]] company to UK cable TV, broadband, and telephone company NTL/[[NTL:Telewest]] for almost £1&amp;nbsp;billion. A new company was launched with much fanfare and publicity on 8 February 2007, under the name [[Virgin Media]]. The decision to merge his Virgin Media Company with NTL was to integrate both of the companies' compatible parts of commerce. Branson used to own three-quarters of Virgin Mobile, whereas now he owns 15 percent of the new Virgin Media company.&lt;ref name="Perry"&gt;{{Cite news| last = Fryer| first =Pat | title = Uma Thurman to promote Virgin Media| publisher=earthtimes.org| date = 23 January 2007| url = http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/show/23001.html| accessdate =2 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Branson formed [[Virgin Comics]] and Virgin Animation, an entertainment company focused on creating new stories and characters for a global audience. The company was founded with author [[Deepak Chopra]], filmmaker [[Shekhar Kapur]], and entrepreneurs [[Sharad Devarajan]] and [[Gotham Chopra]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2006/jan/07/pressandpublishing.virginrichardbranson|title=Branson launches Virgin Comics with India appeal|last=Teather|first=David|date=7 January 2006|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson also launched the [[Virgin Health Bank]] on 1 February 2007, offering parents-to-be the opportunity to store their baby's [[umbilical cord]] blood [[stem cells]] in private and public stem-cell banks.
In June 2006, a tip-off from Virgin Atlantic led both UK and US competition authorities to investigate price-fixing attempts between Virgin Atlantic and British Airways. In August 2007, British Airways was fined £271&amp;nbsp;million over the allegations. Virgin Atlantic was given immunity for tipping off the authorities and received no fine—a controversial decision the Office of Fair Trading defended as being in the public interest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Ruth Sunderland |location=London |url=https://www.theguardian.com/airlines/story/0,,2141647,00.html |title=OFT defends 'snitch' policy |date=5 August 2007|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:AlbertoHazan RichardBranson2007 PermissionOTRS2011060910009523.jpg|thumb|right|Branson with Alberto Hazan in June 2007 helping launch [[Virgin Radio Italia]]]]On 9 February 2007, Branson announced the setting up of a new global science and technology prize—The [[Virgin Earth Challenge]]—in the belief that history has shown that prizes of this nature encourage technological advancements for the good of mankind. The Virgin Earth Challenge was to award $25&amp;nbsp;million to the individual or group who are able to demonstrate a commercially viable design that will result in the net removal of anthropogenic, atmospheric greenhouse gases each year for at least ten years without countervailing harmful effects. This removal must have long-term effects and contribute materially to the stability of the Earth's climate. Branson also announced that he would be joined in the adjudication of the prize by a panel of five judges, all world authorities in their respective fields: [[Al Gore]], [[Sir Crispin Tickell]], [[Tim Flannery]], [[James E. Hansen]], and [[James Lovelock]].

In July 2007, Branson purchased his Australian home, [[Makepeace Island]], in [[Noosa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sir Richard Branson's paradise island|url=http://www.cnngo.com/sydney/visit/richard-bransons-paradise-island-rent-269659|journal=CNN GO|publisher=CNN International|date=20 July 2011|accessdate=23 May 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120615192531/http://www.cnngo.com/sydney/visit/richard-bransons-paradise-island-rent-269659|archive-date=15 June 2012|dead-url=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In August 2007, Branson announced that he bought a 20-percent stake in Malaysia's [[AirAsia X]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/markets/2813816/Virgin-Group-buys-AirAsia-X-stake.html | work=The Daily Telegraph | location=London | title=Virgin Group buys AirAsia X stake | first=Emma | last=Thelwell | date=10 August 2007 | accessdate=22 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 October 2007, Branson's Virgin Group sought to add [[Northern Rock]] to its empire after submitting an offer that would result in Branson personally owning 30% of the company and changing the company's name from Northern Rock to [[Virgin Money]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Teather|first1=David|last2=Finch|first2=Julia|last3=Wearden|first3=Graeme|url=http://money.guardian.co.uk/news_/story/0,,2190411,00.html |title=Branson dangles offer for Northern Rock |work=The Guardian |date= 13 October 2007|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]'' ran a campaign against his bid; [[Vince Cable]], financial spokesperson for the [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrats]], suggested in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that Branson's criminal conviction for tax evasion might be felt by some as a good enough reason not to trust him with public money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Phillip Inman |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2007/dec/13/northernrock.creditcrunch |title=Northern Rock bidder threatens to pull out unless takeover date set, Business |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date= 12 December 2007|accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008–present: Hotels, healthcare and charitable influence ===
On 10 January 2008, Branson's [[Virgin Care|Virgin Healthcare]] announced that it would open a chain of health care clinics that would offer conventional medical care alongside homeopathic and complementary therapies, a development that was welcomed by [[Ben Bradshaw]], the UK's health minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1= Barker |first1= Alex |last2= Timmins |first2= Nick |date= 10 January 2008 |title= Branson launches healthcare business |url= http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/7f5d8f32-bfa0-11dc-8052-0000779fd2ac.html |work= [[Financial Times]] |accessdate= 7 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans where GPs could be paid for referring [[National Health Service]] (NHS) patients to private Virgin services were abandoned in June 2008. The BMA warned the plan would "damage clinical objectivity", there would be a financial incentive for GPs to push patients toward the Virgin services at the centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.healthcarerepublic.com/news/829970 |title=Virgin amends its profit plans |publisher=/ Healthcare Republic |date=11 July 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Plans to take over an NHS Practice in Swindon were abandoned in late September 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nursinginpractice.com/default.asp?title=VirgindropsGPpracticeplans&amp;page=article.display&amp;article.id=13581 |title=Virgin drops GP practice plans |publisher=/ Nursing in Practice |date=22 September 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RichardBransonVAOCApr09.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Branson in April 2009 at the launch of Virgin America in [[Orange County, California]]]]In February 2009, Branson's Virgin organisation was reported as bidding to buy the former [[Honda in Formula One|Honda Formula One]] team. Branson later stated an interest in [[Formula One]], but claimed that, before the Virgin brand became involved with Honda or any other team, Formula One would have to develop a more economically efficient and environmentally responsible image. At the start of the 2009 Formula One season on 28 March, it was announced that Virgin would be sponsoring the new [[Brawn GP]] team,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.crash.net/f1/News/144459/1/bransons_virgin_group_to_sponsor_brawn_gp.html Branson's Virgin Group to sponsor Brawn GP], www.crash.net&lt;/ref&gt; with discussions also under way about introducing a less "dirty" fuel in the medium term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bleacherreport.com/articles/146360-virgin-become-brawn-gps-title-sponsor Virgin Become Brawn Gp's Title Sponsor], Bleacher Report&lt;/ref&gt; After the end of the season and the subsequent purchase of Brawn GP by Mercedes Benz, Branson invested in an 80% buyout of Manor Grand Prix,&lt;ref name="F1News"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://formula-1.updatesport.com/news/article/1244801351/formula_one/F1headlines/FIA-release-2010-entry-list/view.html |title=UpdateF1 &gt;&gt; Formula 1 News &gt; FIA release 2010 entry list |publisher=Formula-1.updatesport.com |date=12 June 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090728053711/http://formula-1.updatesport.com/news/article/1244801351/formula_one/F1headlines/FIA-release-2010-entry-list/view.html |archivedate=28 July 2009  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.autosport.com/news/report.php/id/76653 |title=Virgin set for Manor GP move |work=Autosport |accessdate=14 September 2010 |date=3 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the team being renamed [[Virgin Racing]].

In 2010, [[Virgin Hotels]] was launched under the [[Virgin Group]]. In February 2018, Branson announced the first Virgin hotel would open in Edinburgh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scotsman.com/news/politics/richard-branson-chooses-edinburgh-for-first-uk-virgin-hotel-1-4679167|title=Richard Branson chooses Edinburgh for first UK Virgin hotel|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson and [[Tony Fernandes]], owner of [[Air Asia]] and [[Lotus F1 Racing]], had a bet for the [[2010 F1 season]] where the losing team's boss should work on the winner's airline during a charity flight dressed as a stewardess. Fernandes escaped as the winner of the bet, as Lotus Racing ended tenth in the championship, while Virgin Racing ended twelfth and last. Branson kept his word after losing the bet, as he served his duty as a stewardess on an [[Air Asia]] flight between Perth and Kuala Lumpur on 12 May 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-22499827 Virgin's Sir Richard Branson turns stewardess after losing bet], BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, Branson became patron of the UK's [[Gordon Bennett Cup in ballooning|Gordon Bennett]] 2010 gas balloon race, which has 16 hydrogen balloons flying across Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gordonbennett2010.com |title=Welcome!, 54th Coupe Aéronautique Gordon Bennett 2010 Official Site |publisher=Gordonbennett2010.com |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101002183128/http://www.gordonbennett2010.com/ |archivedate=2 October 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2012, Virgin Care commenced a five-year contract for provision of a range of health services which had previously been under the aegis of NHS Surrey, the local primary care trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/health/news/9176733/NHS-patients-to-be-treated-by-Virgin-Care-in-500m-deal.html|title=NHS patients to be treated by Virgin Care in £500m deal|date=30 March 2012|work=Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  By March 2015 Virgin Care was in charge of over 230 services nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nhs.uk/Services/Trusts/Overview/DefaultView.aspx?id=89552|title=Overview – Virgin Care Ltd – NHS Choices|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2012, Branson announced plans to build an [[orbital space launch]] [[Air launch to orbit|system]], designated [[LauncherOne]].&lt;ref name=bbc20120711&gt;
{{cite news |last=Amos|first=Jonathan |title=Richard Branson's Virgin Galactic to launch small satellites |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-18801180 |accessdate=13 July 2012 |publisher=BBC News |date=11 July 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Four [[private spaceflight|commercial]] customers have already contracted for launches and two companies are developing standardised [[satellite bus]]es optimised to the design of LauncherOne, in expectation of business opportunities created by the new ''smallsat'' launcher.&lt;ref name=nsj20120711&gt;

In August 2012, the franchise for the West Coast Main Line, managed by Virgin Rail since 1997, came to an end. The contract was awarded to FirstGroup after a competitive tender process overseen by the Department for Transport. Branson had expressed his concerns about the tender process and questioned the validity of the business plan submitted by FirstGroup. When Virgin Rail lost the contract, Branson said he was convinced the civil servants had "got their maths wrong". In October, after an investigation into the bidding process, the deal was scrapped. The Transport Secretary [[Patrick McLoughlin]] announced there were "significant technical flaws" in the process and mistakes had been made by transport staff. Virgin Rail continues to operate the West Coast line.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-19809717|title=West Coast Main Line deal scrapped after contract flaws discovered|publisher=BBC News|date=3 October 2012|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014, Branson announced his investment in drone company [[3D Robotics]] stating, "It's amazing to see what a little flying object with a GoPro attached can do. Before they came along the alternative was an expensive helicopter and crew. I'm really excited about the potential 3D Robotics sees in drones. They can do a lot of good in the world, and I hope this affordable technology will give many more people the chance to see our beautiful planet from such a powerful perspective."&lt;ref name="Richard Branson Explains Why He Just Invested In Drones"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businessinsider.com/richard-branson-invests-in-3d-robotics-2014-9|title=Richard Branson Explains Why He Just Invested In Drones|accessdate=15 September 2014|work=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Branson launched the "Foodpreneur" food and drink-focused start-up competition. Winners were provided with mentorship from Branson, legal support, and brand counseling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://startups.co.uk/winners-of-richard-bransons-foodpreneur-competition-announced/|title=Winners of Richard Branson’s “Foodpreneur” competition announced}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2014 winners included Proper Beans, Killer Tomato, Sweetpea Pantry and Sweet Virtues. In 2015, the competition expanded to the Virgin StartUp's Foodpreneur Festival. The 2015 winners were given the opportunity to pitch [[Target Corporation]] buyers. The 2015 winners included Pip &amp; Nut, Double Dutch Drinks, Harry Bromptons, Cauli Rice and Mallow and Marsh.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citeweb|url=https://www.virgin.com/entrepreneur/richard-branson-announces-2015-foodpreneur-festival-winners|title=Virgin StartUp’s Foodpreneur Festival whet the appetite of hundreds of food and drink entrepreneurs across the UK last Friday as the Festival brought them together for a series of insightful workshops and seminars from the industry’s best and brightest.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Branson announced the addition of Moskito Island to the Virgin Limited Edition portfolio.

In September 2018, Branson took part in his fourth Virgin Strive Challenge, where he and a core team travelled more than 2,000&amp;nbsp;km from Cagliari in Sardinia to the summit of Mont Blanc entirely under human and sail power. It was a gruelling month-long challenge where they hiked, biked and kayaked across Europe and had a near-miss on Mont Blanc when a rockfall rained down on them as they crossed the perilous Gouter Couloir. They raised more than £1m for Holly and Sam Branson’s charity Big Change, which supports young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/sir-richard-branson-seconds-from-death-on-charity-mont-blanc-climb-11513576|title=Sir Richard Branson 'seconds from death' on charity Mont Blanc climb|work=Sky News|access-date=29 October 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson made several world record-breaking attempts after 1985, when in the spirit of the [[Blue Riband]] he attempted the fastest Atlantic Ocean crossing. His first attempt in the "Virgin Atlantic Challenger" led to the boat capsizing in British waters and a rescue by RAF helicopter, which received wide media coverage. Some newspapers called for Branson to reimburse the government for the rescue cost. In 1986, in his "Virgin Atlantic Challenger II", with sailing expert Daniel McCarthy, he beat the record by two hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;McKenzie, Sheena (25 April 2013) "[http://edition.cnn.com/2013/04/25/business/richard-branson-virgin-atlantic-challenger-ii/ Back to the future for Richard Branson's retro 80s speedboat]". CNN Retrieved 30 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A year later his [[hot air balloon]] "Virgin Atlantic Flyer" crossed the Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://articles.latimes.com/1987-07-03/news/mn-1079_1_hot-air-balloon|title=Hot-Air Balloonists Crossing Atlantic Break Record |publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date =3 July 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1991, Branson crossed the Pacific from Japan to Arctic Canada, {{convert|6700|mi|km}}, in a balloon of {{convert|2600000|cuft|m3}}. This broke the record, with a speed of {{convert|245|mph|km/h}}.

Between 1995 and 1998, Branson, [[Per Lindstrand]], [[Vladimir Dzhanibekov]], [[Larry Newman (aviator)|Larry Newman]], and [[Steve Fossett]] made attempts to circumnavigate the globe by balloon. In late 1998, they made a record-breaking flight from Morocco to Hawaii but were unable to complete a global flight before [[Bertrand Piccard]] and [[Brian Jones (aeronaut)|Brian Jones]] in ''[[Breitling Orbiter 3]]'' in March 1999.

In March 2004, Branson set a record by travelling from [[Dover]] to [[Calais]] in a [[Gibbs Aquada]] in 1 hour, 40 minutes and 6 seconds, the fastest crossing of the [[English Channel]] in an [[amphibious vehicle]]. The previous record of six hours was set by two Frenchmen.&lt;ref name="Rick"&gt;{{Cite news| last = BBC News| title = Branson sets cross-Channel record|publisher=BBC News  | date = 14 June 2004 | url = http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/england/coventry_warwickshire/3805275.stm | accessdate =13 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The cast of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'', [[Jeremy Clarkson]], [[James May]] and [[Richard Hammond]], attempted to break this record in an amphibious vehicle which they had constructed and, while successfully crossing the channel, did not break Branson's record. After being intercepted by the Coast Guard and asked what their intentions were, Clarkson remarked "..our intentions are to go across the Channel faster than 'Beardy' Branson!". The Coast Guard wished them 'Good luck and Bon Voyage'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YVjo6YOT3Zg | title=Crossing the Channel in Car Boats!

In September 2008, Branson and his children made an unsuccessful attempt at an eastbound record crossing of the Atlantic Ocean under sail in the {{convert|99|ft|m}} [[sloop]] ''Virgin Money''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=158 |title=Richard Branson sets out to crack transatlantic sail record |publisher=meeja.com.au |date=3 September 2008 |accessdate=3 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/65U06n4kN?url=http://www.meeja.com.au/index.php?display_article_id=158 |archivedate=16 February 2012  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The boat, also known as ''Speedboat'', is owned by [[NYYC]] member Alex Jackson, who was a co-skipper on this passage, with Branson and Mike Sanderson. After two  days, four hours, winds of [[Beaufort scale|force]] 7 to 9 (strong gale), and seas of {{convert|40|ft|m}}, a 'monster wave' destroyed the [[spinnaker]], washed a ten-man life raft overboard and severely ripped the mainsail. She eventually continued to [[St. George's, Bermuda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyyc.org/archives_public/|title=Virgin Money Is Attempting to Break Transatlantic Passage Record|publisher=nyyc.org|date=23 October 2008|accessdate=23 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081223022340/http://nyyc.org/archives_public/|archivedate=23 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Television, film and print==
[[File:ETalk2008-Sir Richard Branson.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Branson at the [[2008 Toronto International Film Festival]]]]
Branson has guest starred, usually playing himself, on several television shows, including ''[[Friends]]'', ''[[Baywatch]]'', ''[[Birds of a Feather]]'', ''[[Only Fools and Horses]]'', ''[[The Day Today]]'', a special episode of the comedy ''[[Goodness Gracious Me (BBC)|Goodness Gracious Me]]'' and ''[[Tripping Over]]''. Branson made several appearances during the 1990s on the [[BBC]] Saturday morning show ''[[Live &amp; Kicking]]'', where he was referred to as 'the pickle man' by comedy act [[Trev and Simon]] (in reference to [[Branston Pickle]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.saturdaymornings.co.uk/bbccatalogueprog.shtml?show=livekicking&amp;number=LCKW533F |title=on |publisher=Saturdaymornings.co.uk |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716104401/http://www.saturdaymornings.co.uk/bbccatalogueprog.shtml?show=livekicking&amp;number=LCKW533F |archivedate=16 July 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Branson also appears in a cameo early in [[XTC]]'s "Generals and Majors" video.  He was also the star of a reality television show on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] called ''[[The Rebel Billionaire: Branson's Quest for the Best]]'' (2004), in which sixteen contestants were tested for their entrepreneurship and sense of adventure and only lasted one season.&lt;ref name="Bower2017"/&gt;

His high public profile often leaves him open as a figure of satire—the [[2000 AD (comics)|2000 AD]] series ''[[Zenith (comic)|Zenith]]'' features a parody of Branson as a [[super villain]], as the comic's publisher and favoured distributor and the Virgin group were in competition at the time. He is also caricatured in ''[[The Simpsons]]'' episode "[[Monty Can't Buy Me Love]]" as the tycoon Arthur Fortune, as the ballooning [[Narcissistic personality disorder|megalomaniac]] Richard Chutney (a pun on Branson, as in [[Branston Pickle]]) in ''[[Believe Nothing]]'', and voiced himself in "[[The Princess Guide]]". The character Grandson Richard 39 in [[Terry Pratchett]]'s Wings is modelled on Branson.

He has a [[cameo appearance]] in several films: ''[[Around the World in 80 Days (2004 film)|Around the World in 80 Days]]'' (2004), where he played a hot-air balloon operator, and ''[[Superman Returns]]'' (2006), where he was credited as a 'Shuttle Engineer' and appeared alongside his son, Sam, with a [[Virgin Galactic]]-style commercial suborbital shuttle at the centre of his storyline. He also has a cameo in the [[James Bond]] film ''[[Casino Royale (2006 film)|Casino Royale]]'' (2006). Here, he is seen as a passenger going through [[Miami Airport]] security check-in and being frisked – several Virgin Atlantic planes appear soon after. British Airways edited out Branson's cameo in their in-flight screening of the movie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6579839.stm |title=BA cuts Branson from Bond movie |publisher=BBC News  |date=21 April 2007 |accessdate=14 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He makes a number of brief and disjointed appearances in the documentary ''[[Derek and Clive Get the Horn]]'' (1979), which follows the exploits of [[Peter Cook]] and [[Dudley Moore]] recording their final comedy album. Branson and his mother were also featured in the documentary film ''Lemonade Stories''. On the TV series ''[[Rove (TV series)|Rove Live]]'' in early 2006, [[Rove McManus]] and Sir Richard pushed each other into a swimming pool fully clothed live on TV during a "Live at your house" episode.

Branson is a ''[[Star Trek]]'' fan and named his new spaceship [[VSS Enterprise|VSS ''Enterprise'']] in honour of the ''Star Trek'' spaceships, and in 2006, reportedly offered actor [[William Shatner]] a ride on the inaugural space launch of Virgin Galactic. In an interview in ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, published on 10 August 2009, Shatner claimed that Branson approached him asking how much he would pay for a ride on the spaceship. In response, Shatner asked "how much would you pay ''me'' to do it?"

In August 2007, Branson announced on ''[[The Colbert Report]]'' that he had named a new aircraft Air Colbert. He later doused political satirist and talk show host [[Stephen Colbert]] with water from his mug. Branson subsequently took a retaliatory splash from Colbert. The interview quickly ended, with both laughing&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comedycentral.com/motherload/index.jhtml?ml_video=91955

The interview was promoted on ''The Report'' as the ''Colbert-Branson Interview Trainwreck''. Branson then made a cameo appearance in ''[[The Soup]]'', playing an intern working under [[Joel McHale]] who had been warned against getting into water fights with Stephen Colbert, and being subsequently fired.

In March 2008, he launched [[Virgin Mobile]] in India; during that period, he made a cameo appearance in [[Bollywood]] film ''[[London Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20080304-2.html |title=Neha Dhupia swept off her feet by Richard Branson : Bollywood News |publisher=ApunKaChoice.Com |date=4 March 2008 |accessdate=14 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513211035/http://www.apunkachoice.com/scoop/bollywood/20080304-2.html |archivedate=13 May 2011  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2010, Branson narrated Australian sailor [[Jessica Watson]]'s documentary about her solo sailing trip around the world.

In April 2011, Branson appeared on [[CNN]]'s Mainsail with [[Kate Winslet]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/CNNI/Programs/main.sail | title=Show Pages – MainSail | date=31 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together they re-enacted a famous scene from the 1997 film ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' for the cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=TheHyperbot1 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zf9W7w_9T1U |title=Branson, Winslet – Titanic Scene |publisher=[[YouTube]] |date=22 April 2011 |accessdate=11 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=YouTube is not an ideal source.|date=November 2018}} On 17 August 2011, he was featured in the premier episode of [[Hulu]]'s first long-form original production entitled, ''[[A Day in the Life (2011 TV series)|A Day in the Life]]''.&lt;ref name=MSADITL&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2011/08/17/morgan-spurlock-a-day-in-the-life_n_929008.html|title=Morgan Spurlock 'A Day in the Life': Original Series Premieres on Hulu (VIDEO)|accessdate=8 September 2011|date=17 August 2011|work=[[Huffington Post]]|first=Gazelle|last=Emami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the 2012 [[Pride of Britain Awards]] on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] on 30 October, Branson, along with [[Michael Caine]], [[Elton John]], [[Simon Cowell]] and [[Stephen Fry]], recited [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s poem "[[If—]]" in tribute to the 2012 British [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Olympics|Olympic]] and [[Great Britain at the 2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympics]] athletes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Britain's biggest stars record iconic poem 'If' as tribute to Olympic heroes|url=https://www.yahoo.com/news/britains-biggest-stars-record-iconic-poem-tribute-olympic-111750818.html|work=Yahoo.com.|date=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Humanitarian initiatives==
In the late 1990s, Branson and musician [[Peter Gabriel]] discussed with [[Nelson Mandela]] their idea of a small group of leaders working to solve difficult global conflicts.&lt;ref name = prelders&gt;[http://www.looktothestars.org/news/6353-help-free-the-children-with-richard-branson Help Free The Children With Richard Branson], www.looktothestars.org&lt;/ref&gt;  On 18 July 2007, in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, Mandela announced the formation of a new group, [[The Elders (organization)|The Elders]]. [[Kofi Annan]] served as Chair of The Elders and [[Gro Harlem Brundtland]] as Deputy Chair. The Elders is funded by a group of donors, including Branson and Gabriel.

[[File:ICMEC Board.jpg|thumb|300px|Richard Branson with his mother Eve, and the Board of Directors of the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]]]]
In 1999, Branson became a founding sponsor of the [[International Centre for Missing &amp; Exploited Children]] ("ICMEC"), the goal of which is to help find missing children, and to stop the exploitation of children, as his mother Eve became a founding member of ICMEC's Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=4888 |title=- International Children's Organization Expands Global Reach With Four New Board Members |publisher= |accessdate=2 June 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141029054446/http://www.icmec.org/missingkids/servlet/NewsEventServlet?LanguageCountry=en_X1&amp;PageId=4888 |archivedate=29 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZdBNBdYKNC4C&amp;pg=PA207&amp;lpg=PA207&amp;dq=eve+branson+icmec&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=D9gkGzxTJv&amp;sig=VVskIY1F-vOhF_Zrq0tiTPUp3gQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9EJAVNeaMurfsAS744LoBw&amp;ved=0CDgQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=eve%20branson%20icmec&amp;f=false|title=Mum's the Word|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the Carbon War Room, founded in 2009, the entrepreneur sought solutions for global warming and the energy crisis. "We all have a part to play, but I believe entrepreneurs will have a really significant role to play in bringing investment and commercial skills to help develop the new technologies needed to grow a post-carbon economy", he said in his interview with ''[[Vision (magazine)|Vision]]''. Through Carbon War Room initiative he has focused efforts on finding sustainable alternatives for three industry sectors: shipping, energy efficiency and aviation and renewable jet fuels.&lt;ref name="vision.ae"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vision.ae/focus/exclusive_interview_sir_richard_branson|title=Sir Richard Branson interview – Vision Magazine|publisher=|accessdate=2 June 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150527110825/http://vision.ae/focus/exclusive_interview_sir_richard_branson|archivedate=27 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also launched Virgin Startup, an official delivery partner for the UK's Start Up Loans programme. Through this new organisation, he was to provide loans to entrepreneurs between the ages of 18 and 30 UK-wide. A pilot of the scheme, which ran over 11 months, injected £600,000 into 100 businesses.&lt;ref name="vision.ae"/&gt;

Branson's other work in South Africa includes the [[Branson School of Entrepreneurship]], set up in 2005 as a partnership between [[Virgin Unite]], the non-profit foundation of Virgin, and entrepreneur [[Taddy Blecher]], the founder of [[CIDA City Campus]], a university in Johannesburg. The school aims to improve economic growth in South Africa by supporting start-ups and micro-enterprises with skills, mentors, services, networks and finance arrangements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.virginunite.com/Templates/News.aspx?nid=96e9b78a-cc3b-4c6e-b4e4-bc0ba18184c1&amp;cid=f010e54f-209d-4736-8586-0a24ae2f35b2&amp;id=85b159fd-d3cd-482f-b2a4-fd47945eb87a/ |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130205141252/http://www.virginunite.com/Templates/News.aspx?nid=96e9b78a-cc3b-4c6e-b4e4-bc0ba18184c1&amp;cid=f010e54f-209d-4736-8586-0a24ae2f35b2&amp;id=85b159fd-d3cd-482f-b2a4-fd47945eb87a/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 February 2013 |title=Virgin Unite |publisher=Virgin Unite |accessdate=14 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph 2009"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ruddick|first1=Graham|title=Sir Richard Branson teaches African entrepreneurs Dragons' Den-style|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/supportservices/5906838/Sir-Richard-Branson-teaches-African-entrepreneurs-Dragons-Den-style.html|accessdate=3 July 2014|publisher=The Telegraph|date=25 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fundraising activity to support the school is achieved by [[Sunday Times Fast Track 100|''The Sunday Times'' Fast Track 100]], sponsored by [[Virgin Group]], at its yearly event, where places to join Richard Branson on trips to South Africa to provide coaching and mentoring to students are auctioned to attendees.

In March 2008, Branson hosted an environmental gathering at his private island, [[Necker Island (British Virgin Islands)|Necker Island]], in the Caribbean with several prominent entrepreneurs, celebrities, and world leaders. They discussed global warming-related problems facing the world, hoping that the meeting would be a precursor to future discussions regarding similar problems. Former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]], Wikipedia co-founder [[Jimmy Wales]], and [[Larry Page]] of [[Google]] were in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/22/business/worldbusiness/22deal.html "Thinking Green While Sifting Through the Sand"] ''The New York Times'' article published 22 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2013, Branson urged companies to boycott [[Uganda]] because of its "anti-homosexuality bill". Branson stated that it would be "against my conscience to support this country...governments must realize that people should be able to love whoever they want."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://www.globalpost.com/dispatch/news/regions/africa/131226/richard-branson-condemns-uganda-over-anti-gay-bill|title= Richard Branson condemns Uganda over anti-gay bill |publisher=Global Post |date=26 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==
===Tax evasion===
In 1971, Branson was convicted and briefly jailed for tax evasion, having fraudulently obtained export documents for records to be sold on the domestic market in order to avoid paying [[Purchase Tax]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/how_failure_breeds_success/2014/05/richard_branson_tax_fraud_how_a_youthful_indiscretion_helped_create_a_billionaire.html|title=A Portrait of the Billionaire as a Young Tax Cheat|first=Jordan|last=Weissmann|date=27 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018|via=Slate}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianlv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://guardianlv.com/2014/05/richard-branson-from-tax-fraud-to-billionaire/|title=Richard Branson : From Tax Fraud to Billionaire · Guardian Liberty Voice|date=29 May 2014|publisher=|accessdate=5 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Customs officials caught onto the scheme and executed a [[sting operation]], marking records bought for the international market with [[invisible ink]] and subsequently buying them on the domestic market. Branson was advised of the sting by an anonymous tip-off and attempted to dispose of the evidence, but this was unsuccessful.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guardianlv.com"/&gt;

Branson's business empire is owned by a complicated series of [[offshore trust]]s and companies. ''[[The Sunday Times]]'' stated that his wealth is calculated at £3&amp;nbsp;billion; if he were to retire to his Caribbean island and liquidate all of this, he would pay relatively little in tax.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/article/0,,2087-2483988_2,00.html |title=The Sunday Times: Britain |accessdate=1 January 2007 |work=The Times |location=London |first=Roland |last=Watson }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}} Branson has been criticised for his business strategy, and has been accused of being a [[carpetbagger#United Kingdom|carpetbagger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/21/richard-branson-northern-rock|title=Is Richard Branson all he's cracked up to be?|last=Chakrabortty|first=Aditya|date=21 November 2011|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=7 April 2013}} Branson's reply is here [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2011/nov/23/nonsense-virgin-success-dependent-on-state].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/24/richard-branson-defence-virgin-trains|title=Don't be fooled by Richard Branson's defence of Virgin trains|author=Aditya Chakrabortty|date=24 June 2013|work=[[The Guardian|guardian.co.uk]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}} Branson's response is here [https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/20/virgin-trains-handouts-track].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Aditya Chakrabortty|date=10 June 2013|title=The truth about Richard Branson's Virgin Rail profits|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2013/jun/10/truth-richard-branson-virgin-rail-profits|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=27 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson responded that he is living on Necker for health rather than tax reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2013/oct/13/richard-branson-tax-exile-virgin |title=Richard Branson denies being a tax exile |last1=Garside |first1=Juliette |date=13 October 2013 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian News and Media Limited |accessdate=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Assault claim===
In November 2017, singer Antonia Jenae, a backing singer for [[Joss Stone]], claimed Branson sexually assaulted her at Necker Island. A spokesperson for Branson confirmed to ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' newspaper that members of the band had been invited for a party on the island in 2010, but that he and friends and family in attendance had "no recollection" of the events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/11/25/sir-richard-branson-has-no-recollection-alleged-incident-necker/|title=Sir Richard Branson has 'no recollection' of alleged incident at Necker Island|work=The Daily Telegraph|date=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Branson later apologised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/showbiz/news/a843901/sir-richard-branson-joss-stone-antonia-jenae-alleges-assault/|title=Richard Branson apologises after singer alleges assault|date=25 November 2017|publisher=digitalspy.com|accessdate=3 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Owing to his interest in humanitarian and ecological issues, Branson also lists [[Al Gore]]'s best-selling book, ''[[An Inconvenient Truth (book)|An Inconvenient Truth]]'', and ''[[The Revenge of Gaia]]'' by [[James Lovelock]] amongst his favourites. According to Branson's book, ''Screw It, Let's Do It: Lessons in Life'', he is also a fan of [[Jung Chang]]'s ''[[Wild Swans]]'' and [[Antony Beevor]]'s ''[[Stalingrad (book)|Stalingrad]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Richard Branson's reading influences |url=http://www.infloox.com/person?id=7bb9503d |publisher=Infloox.com |accessdate=26 July 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130905035652/http://www.infloox.com/person?id=7bb9503d |archivedate=5 September 2013  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Branson |first=Richard |year=2011 |origyear=2006 |title=Screw It, Let's Do It: Lessons in Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8klTYCfVzEC&amp;pg=PA105#v=twopage&amp;q&amp;f=false |location=New York |publisher=Random House |page=105 |isbn=9780753547458 |access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fiction, Branson has long admired the character [[Peter Pan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite magazine |last=Branson |first=Richard |date=12 November 2012 |title=Richard Branson on How to Use Age to Your Advantage |url=http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224902 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201015724/http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/224902 |archivedate=1 December 2012 |deadurl=yes |work=[[Entrepreneur (magazine)|Entrepreneur]] |access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2006 he founded [[Liquid Comics|Virgin Comics LLC]], stating that Virgin Comics will give "a whole generation of young, creative thinkers a voice".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Gardner |first=Chris |date=5 January 2006 |title=Branson Taking a Passage to India |url=https://variety.com/2006/scene/markets-festivals/branson-taking-a-passage-to-india-1117935558/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |access-date=30 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newsarama.com/virgincomics/virgincomics.htm |title=Branson Enters Comics with Virgin Comics, Virgin Animation |accessdate=7 February 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060111162748/http://www.newsarama.com/virgincomics/virgincomics.htm |publisher=[[Newsarama]] |archivedate=11 January 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other relationships==
Robert Trigg had a history of violence towards women.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

A previous relationship between Trigg and Rebecca Allcorn was ended by her in 2002 after nearly a decade because of his drinking and violent outbursts.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; They had a daughter.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

He went into a relationship with Susan Holland, which deteriorated due to his drink-fueled rages.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; In 2003 he accused her of sleeping with a neighbour and beat her, kicking her in the head and face.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; Apparently afraid of his own behaviour he called police, warning them "I'm going to kill her. You need to arrest me.".&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; She spent three weeks in hospital and Trigg was later convicted of assault.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

In October 2014 he met Deirdre Loveridge and began a relationship with her.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; His jealousy led to the relationship breaking down.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He send more than a hundred abusive messages and phone calls.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; In November 2016, he was convicted of harassment and handed a [[restraining order]].&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; She was so terrified of him, she left the area.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

In August 2016 he entered a relationship with Caroline Yardwood, but this relationship also ended because of his jealousy.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He sent her many abusive text and voicemail messages.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

On December 21, 2016, he turned up drunk at the homeless charity shop where she worked.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He shouted insults and abuse before grabbing her by the arm and pushing her in the chest.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He followed her into a back room of the shop and pushed her, causing her to fall into a door.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He was arrested and later pleaded guilty to assault, harassment, and racially aggravated harassment and was jailed for twelve weeks.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

==Caroline Devlin==
Trigg and Caroline Devlin met in 2003.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; She was Scottish.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;
Neighbours described their relationship as volatile and said that Trigg had angry outbursts while drunk.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; After one outburst, Caroline said "I won't be here for my 40th.".&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt;

Bridget Benger, a close friend of Caroline, described how Caroline had become withdrawn and "lost her spark".&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt; Benger and Devlin had made a pact three weeks before the latters' death to look after each other's children if anything happened.&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt;

Her body was discovered by her ten-year-old daughter after Trigg had said there was something wrong with her mother.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He did not call for an ambulance, leaving it to her children to do so.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

Caroline Devlins' death was originally ruled as being due to an aneuyrism.&lt;ref name=bbc-robert-trigg-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt;

A dispute arose about Caroline Devlins' autopsy between Sussex Police and the coroner.&lt;ref name=telegraph-row-between-police-and-coroner&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2017/06/28/row-police-coroner-emerges-trial-chef-accused-killing-girlfriend/|title=Row between police and coroner emerges at trial of chef accused of killing girlfriend |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]|date=28 June 2017|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The police refused to pay for a [[Home Office]] pathologist because they only wanted a "routine" examination performed.&lt;ref name=telegraph-row-between-police-and-coroner/&gt; As the circumstances around her death were unexplained, the Worthing pathologist wanted a Home Office pathologist to do a more thorough examination.&lt;ref name=telegraph-row-between-police-and-coroner/&gt; There existed a state of distrust between the county pathologist and the police force to do with previous requests to do with deaths in unexplained circumstances.&lt;ref name=telegraph-row-between-police-and-coroner/&gt;

Caroline Devlins' post mortem was carried out four days after her death due to the dispute, as compared to two days in the case of Susan Nicholson.&lt;ref name=telegraph-row-between-police-and-coroner/&gt;

==Susan Nicholson==
Trigg met Susan Nicholson after both attended [[Drug rehabilitation|alcohol rehabilitation]] in July 2010.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; They started dating in November that year before he moved into her flat that December.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

Neighbour Hannah Cooper saw Susan suffering from injuries on four occasions and contacted police to report fights.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

In March 2011 Robert Trigg was cautioned for punching Susan in the face after an argument.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

In April 2011 Trigg called Cooper to say "It's Sue, I think she's dead.".&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He then left the flat, going to a nearby shop to buy cigarettes.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; He phoned his older brother Michael before phoning Hannah Coopher, a neighbour.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt; She called 999.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;

In the months before Susan Nicholsons' death in 2011 police were called to her flat six times after [[999 (emergency telephone number)|999]] calls.&lt;ref name=telegraph-robert-trigg-chef-long-history-domestic-violence-went-kill-two/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt; Two days before her death he was cautioned for punching her in the face.&lt;ref name=telegraph-chef-guilty-killing-two-girlfriends-five-years-apart/&gt;
An inquest into Susan Nicholsons' death ruled that she had died after Trigg had rolled inadvertently onto her while they both slept on a sofa.&lt;ref name=bbc-robert-trigg-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-robert-trigg-man-who-killed-two-girlfriends-five-years-apart-is-convicted-of-murder-and-manslaughter/&gt; During the inquest, Trigg estimated they had slept on the sofa 40 times (and had used it when they first moved in, in lieu of a bed).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2011/12/12/man-smothered-girlfriend-while-sleeping-death-manslaugher_n_1142821.html|title=Man 'Smothered Girlfriend To Death By Rolling Over In His Sleep'|date=2011-12-12|work=HuffPost UK|access-date=2018-01-25|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trigg subsequently sold his story, for an unknown amount to a magazine, in which he reiterated his claim that her death was accidental.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.theargus.co.uk/news/15403982.Killer_cashed_in_on_death_of_girlfriend_with_magazine_article/|title=Killer cashed in on death of girlfriend with magazine article|website=The Argus|language=en|access-date=2017-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parents' campaign==
Susan Nicholsons' parents Peter and Elizabeth Skelton were suspicious of Robert Trigg, partly because of his violent past but also because the sofa in question was too small for a couple to sleep on.&lt;ref name=telegraph-chef-guilty-killing-two-girlfriends-five-years-apart/&gt; They criticised the original investigation by [[Sussex Police]] and criticised the force for ignoring their pleas to reinvestigate their daughters' death.&lt;ref name=telegraph-chef-guilty-killing-two-girlfriends-five-years-apart/&gt;

==Trial==
The trial was held in [[Lewes Crown Court]] and lasted ten days.&lt;ref name=bbc-robert-trigg-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt; Trigg denied any wrongdoing.&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt;

During the trial, it was argued that both women were found in unusual poses and that Robert Trigg had not called for an ambulance, instead leaving that up to someone else.&lt;ref name=bbc-robert-trigg-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends/&gt;

===New pathological evidence===
Dr. Nathaniel Cary testified that Caroline Devlin had died as a result of a blow to the back of the head.&lt;ref name=bbc-robert-trigg-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends/&gt; He found that Ms. Nicholson had been suffocated.&lt;ref name=bbc-robert-trigg-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends/&gt;

===Verdict===
On 5 July 2017 he was convicted of the manslaughter of Caroline Devlin and the murder of Susan Nicholson.&lt;ref name=bbc-robert-trigg-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-man-found-guilty-of-killing-two-girlfriends-two-years-apart/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-robert-trigg-man-who-killed-two-girlfriends-five-years-apart-is-convicted-of-murder-and-manslaughter/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraph-chef-guilty-killing-two-girlfriends-five-years-apart/&gt;

===Sentence===
As he was led into court in handcuffs for sentencing, Trigg said "Isaiah 50, verse 11. They should be in here, not me.".&lt;ref name=guardian-british-man-jailed-for-life-for-killing-two-former-girlfriends&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2017/jul/06/british-man-robert-trigg-jailed-for-life-for-murder-of-two-former-girlfriends|title=British man jailed for life for killing two former girlfriends|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=6 July 2017|accessdate=6 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was sentenced to [[life imprisonment]] with a minimum term of 25 years.&lt;ref name=guardian-british-man-jailed-for-life-for-killing-two-former-girlfriends/&gt;

==Early life==
Pak was born in [[Hunan]], China, on November 27, 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Rose-Pak&amp;lc=2594&amp;pid=181481914&amp;mid=7096214|title=Rose Pak Obituary - Green Street Mortuary {{!}} San Francisco CA|website=obits.dignitymemorial.com|access-date=2016-09-21|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160921044253/http://obits.dignitymemorial.com/dignity-memorial/obituary.aspx?n=Rose-Pak&amp;lc=2594&amp;pid=181481914&amp;mid=7096214|archivedate=September 21, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; She received a Catholic education while growing up as a refugee in Macau and Hong Kong after her father, a businessman, had died in the [[Chinese Civil War]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/us/rose-pak-a-chinatown-power-broker-savors-mayor-edwin-lees-victory.html|title=Rose Pak, a Chinatown Power Broker, Savors Mayor Edwin Lee’s Victory|last=Eckholm|first=Erik|date=November 11, 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When she was 17, she received a scholarship to attend the [[San Francisco College for Women]], and in 1972 earned a master's degree at the [[Columbia School of Journalism]].&lt;ref name="Wildermuth" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; After a brief stint working at ''[[The New York Times]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=FORA.tv|title=The New West with Will Hearst: Rose Pak|date=July 18, 2016|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=weMse1zMHTg&amp;t=261|accessdate=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; she returned to San Francisco to work for the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' (as its first female Asian American journalist&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfbos.org/ftp/uploadedfiles/bdsupvrs/resolutions16/r0128-16.pdf|title=Resolution 128-16: Rename James Alley to 'Rose Pak's Way 白蘭之道'|last=|first=|date=April 22, 2016|website=|publisher=San Francisco Board of Supervisors|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;), a job that she left after eight years to become a full-time social activist.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==Political career==
Pak's first objective as an activist was to organize a campaign to save the [[San Francisco Chinese Hospital]] from closure.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Later she worked for decades to advocate for its replacement by a new, modern building, and for the [[Central Subway]] project that is set to improve Chinatown's connection to the rest of the Bay Area.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2014-01/24/content_17256194.htm|title=Rose Pak: A tireless advocate for Chinatown|last=Jun|first=Chang|date=January 24, 2014|website=|publisher=[[China Daily]]|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both projects broke ground in 2013.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Pak was a supporter of [[Art Agnos]] (the city's mayor from 1988 to 1992), but opposed his efforts to tear down the [[Embarcadero Freeway]], arguing that Chinatown would suffer catastrophic consequences if it lost the fast crosstown connection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Chinatown-s-champion-3173928.php|title=Chinatown's champion|last=Wildermuth|first=John|date=September 19, 2009|website=|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She won a ballot measure about the issue in 1987, but after the [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] damaged the freeway, her objections were overturned.&lt;ref name="Wildermuth" /&gt; According to the San Francisco Chronicle, Pak then "almost single-handedly persuaded the city to build" the $1.5 billion Central Subway project to compensate Chinatown for the demolition of the freeway.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/Rose-Pak-flashes-red-light-on-Stockton-Street-9126204.php|title=Rose Pak flashes red light on Stockton Street pedestrian mall|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=San Francisco Chonicle|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, Pak was instrumental in obtaining consensus to nominate [[Ed Lee (politician)|Edwin M. Lee]] as the first [[Asian American]] mayor of San Francisco.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/12/us/rose-pak-a-chinatown-power-broker-savors-mayor-edwin-lees-victory.html?pagewanted=all | work=The New York Times | first=Erik | last=Eckholm | title=Rose Pak, a Chinatown Power Broker, Savors Mayor Edwin Lee's Victory | date=November 11, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pak said, "This was finally our moment to make the first Chinese mayor of a major city."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/07/us/07bcmayor.html| title=Behind-the-Scenes Power Politics: The Making of a Mayor| author=Gerry Shih | work=[[The New York Times]] | date=January 6, 2011 | accessdate=January 7, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Pak and her ally Ed Lee had a fallout over Lee's choice of [[Julie Christensen (politician)|Julie Christensen]] as a replacement appointment to the Board of Supervisor instead of Pak's protege Cindy Wu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/matier-ross/article/S-F-Mayor-Ed-Lee-gets-fat-donation-earful-from-6013221.php|title=S.F.

Shortly before her death in 2016, Pak vehemently opposed a project to permanently convert parts of [[Stockton Street (San Francisco)|Stockton Street]] in the Union Square area outside of Chinatown into a pedestrian zone, arguing that Stockton Street was a "vital link" for Chinatown, and threatening to organize a blockade of City Hall by thousands of vehicles if the idea came to pass.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sanfrancisco.cbslocal.com/2016/08/08/rose-pak-threatens-city-hall-blockade-over-stockton-street-proposal/|title=Rose Pak Threatens City Hall Blockade Over Stockton Street Proposal|last=Matier|first=Phil|date=August 8, 2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the reopening of the Chinese Hospital at the end of April 2016, the city renamed an alley in Chinatown just east of the new tower in her honor to "Rose Pak's Way 白蘭之道".&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In May 2016, Pak returned to San Francisco after an extended medical stay in China where she had received a [[Kidney transplantation|kidney transplant]], announcing to a welcoming committee of Chinatown elders, local politicians and city officials that her health had been restored.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sfist.com/2016/05/23/rose_pak_returns_following_extended.php|title=Rose Pak Returns Following Extended Medical Stay In China|last=Barmann|first=Jay|date=May 23, 2016|website=SFist|access-date=May 24, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160526084402/http://sfist.com/2016/05/23/rose_pak_returns_following_extended.php|archivedate=May 26, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sfexaminer.com/rose-pak-back-feinstein-swipes-airbnb/|title=Rose Pak is back; Feinstein swipes at Airbnb (again)|last=Rodriguez|first=Joe Fitzgerald|date=May 23, 2016|website=The San Francisco Examiner|language=en-US|access-date=May 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She died in San Francisco on September 18, 2016, aged 68.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite news|title=Rose Pak, SF political powerhouse, dies|url=http://www.sfchronicle.com/news/article/Rose-Pak-SF-political-powerhouse-dies-9230594.php?t=59ea95ca71|accessdate=September 19, 2016|work=San Francisco Chronicle}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was single all of her life, and had no children.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Political ties to the People's Republic of China ===
Pak was an overseas executive director of the China Overseas Exchange Association (COEA), an organization overseen by the [[Overseas Chinese Affairs Office]] (OCAO) of the [[State Council of the People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://foreignpolicyblogs.com/2016/06/09/beijing-hidden-influence-san-francisco/|title=Beijing-by-the-Bay: China's Hidden Influence in San Francisco|last=Eades|first=Mark C.|date=June 9, 2016|website=Foreign Policy Blogs|publisher=|access-date=September 19, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At various times she spoke out in favor of the Chinese government's views, e.g. in 2012 calling all "overseas Chinese" to "defend the homeland” in the conflict about the [[Senkaku Islands|Diaoyu Islands]], and in 2008 opposing a resolution of the SF Board of Supervisors that criticized China for the Tiananmen Square massacre and other repression measures, passed on occasion of the [[2008 Summer Olympics torch relay|Beijing Summer Olympics torch relay]] reaching San Francisco.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/apr/02/local/me-torch2|title=S.F. keeping a light on for China?

Pak was critical of the [[Falun Gong]] movement in San Francisco and in 2004 she banned the group from participating in the city's annual Chinese New Year's Parade.&lt;ref name="Wildermuth" /&gt; The group and others, including San Francisco Supervisor [[Chris Daly]], subsequently alleged that Pak had connections to the Chinese Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Wildermuth" /&gt; Pak consistently denied any ties with Beijing.&lt;ref name="Wildermuth" /&gt; In an August 2011 interview with the [[New Tang Dynasty Television]] and ''[[Epoch Times]]'', former San Francisco Board of Supervisors President [[Aaron Peskin]] made similar allegations, claiming that Pak was "the real leader of San Francisco", and that she represented outside governmental interests that "include the People's Republic of China."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theepochtimes.com/n2/united-states/san-francisco-mayoral-race-deeply-corrupted-says-former-legislator-60506.html|title=San Francisco Mayoral Race Deeply Corrupted, Says Former Legislator|date=August 17, 2011|work=[[The Epoch Times]]|author=Matthew Robertson|accessdate=August 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sf.ntdtv.com/video/?id=na574200&amp;&amp;start=20|title=誰在操縱市長選舉 (Chinese video - Who's controlling the Mayoral Election)|date=August 16, 2011|work=[[New Tang Dynasty Television]]|accessdate=August 19, 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425123400/http://www.sf.ntdtv.com/video/?id=na574200&amp;&amp;start=20|archivedate=April 25, 2012|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3434">'''Rafael Vásquez''' (1804–1854) was a 19th-century general in the Mexican Army during the Mexican rebellion against the centralist style rule of government.

==Early life==
Vásquez was born in Mexico City in 1804. His first military endeavor was on February 20, 1827, as Captain of Patriots of the Hacienda de Ciénega de Mata, [[Jalisco, Mexico]].  He was appointed brevet brigadier general in 1839.

==Mexican political rebellions==
Vásquez was a major figure in the suppression of the Mexican insurgents, who opposed the centralization of the Mexican government under General [[Antonio López de Santa Anna]]. The states of [[Coahuila]], [[Nuevo León]], and [[Tamaulipas]] had advocated rebellion and sought secession from Mexico and declared a new [[Republic of the Rio Grande]].&lt;ref&gt;David M. Vigness, "REPUBLIC OF THE RIO GRANDE," Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/ngr01], accessed September 23, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Vásquez led a force to subdue [[Antonio Canales Rosillo]] and his Texan - Mexican troops into an ambush near [[Saltillo, Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Roberto Mario Salmón, "CANALES ROSILLO, ANTONIO," Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fca38], accessed September 23, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt; Assisting Canales was Colonel Samuel W. Jordan. Jordan led a group of federalist troops that had secretly been infiltrated by centralist supporters. However, he still managed to rout the centralists forces who quickly fled to Saltillo.&lt;ref&gt;"JORDAN, SAMUEL W.," Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fjo73], accessed September 23, 2011. Published by the Texas State Historical Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas invasion==
On March 5, 1842, General Vásquez invaded Texas with about 700 men and occupied [[San Antonio, Texas]]. The Texan forces were surprised and overwhelmed.&lt;ref name="de la Teja116"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; After a few skirmishes, they were unable to defend the town and evacuated to [[Seguin, Texas]]. Vásquez deemed it a surrender and took control of San Antonio. He raised the Mexican flag and thus declared Mexican laws in effect. On March 7, Vásquez fled San Antonio, while pursued by Texan forces.&lt;ref name="de la Teja117"&gt;de la Teja (1991), p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt; He crossed the Rio Grande and returned to Mexico. The Vásquez expedition was one of the events that led to retaliations by the Texans through the [[Mier Expedition]] and [[Somervell Expedition]].

==Later life==
Later in 1851 and 1852, Vásquez was commandant general of the state of [[Jalisco, Mexico]] . He died on March 9, 1854, in Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;"VASQUEZ, RAFAEL," Handbook of Texas Online [http://www.tshaonline.org/handbook/online/articles/fva22], accessed September 23, 2011.

}}'''Shyamal-Saumil''' is an [[Indian classical music]] duo formed in 1980, in [[Ahmedabad]], [[Gujarat]], India, composed of the Gujarati singers, Dr. Shyamal Munshi and Saumil Munshi. Shyamal-Saumil achieved both critical acclaim and commercial success in the 1980s and early 1990s, helping to popularize Gujarati classical music, known as "Sugam Sangeet" while experimenting, innovating, and branching out into other forms of media, like cinema and theatre. Shyamal-Saumil are known for their inclusive music, having created a plethora of albums for children, adolescents, and adults, and also having delved into and having explored different cultures and religious folk music in their works.

== History ==
Saumil Munshi was born on the 5th of September, 1960, while Shyamal Munshi was born on 14 April 1962, in Ahmedabad, India, to their father Paresh Munshi and mother Bhaktida Munshi. The passion for music and literature was instilled at a young age by their school activities. The two used to go to performances and competitions, where they used to recite ghazals and poems. In 1973, they joined the Jagh Mag Mandal, where they used to perform a variety of music, from film songs to classical poetry.

=== 1980–1984: Formation and debut ===
In 1980, the two gave their debut organized solo performance, titled, "Morpichch", a sold-out show. The show launched their careers and gave them credibility and fame. The shows were repeated in [[Kolkata]] and [[Mumbai]] as well, and over the course of the first 5 years, they gave 20 shows in 3 cities.

=== 1984-2000: Performances, Meghdhanoosh, and Acclaim ===
In 1995, Shyamal-Saumil released Meghdhanoosh, initially in cassette form, dedicated entirely to kids. The album comprised 45 songs on different morals and themes, and was largely sung by kids themselves. To this date, Meghdhanoosh remains the duo's best-selling album, selling over 25,000 copies.

=== 2000-2002: Further Success and Swarsetu ===
Having earned fame and success, Shyamal-Saumil, in late 2000, launched "Swarsetu", a listeners forum, to promote "Sugam Sangeet" and "Kavya Sangeet", as well as to introduce new and upcoming artists while staying true to the culture. Since 2000, Shyamal-Saumil have organized over 90 performances, each with a different theme and message. Swarsetu also allows children and adolescents to showcase their talents and imbibe roots and foundations into them.

=== 2002-2005: Hastakshar and Critical Reception ===
in 2002, Shyamal-Saumil released the biggest collaborative project of their career, a 6-album project called, "Hastakshar", with each album containing songs by a different illustrious poet and lyricist. These poets were Tushar Shukla, Raman Patel, [[Ramesh Parekh]], [[Suresh Dalal]], and [[Umashankar Joshi]], and for their songs, Shyamal-Saumil brought together 30 artists to create the project. The title song was sung by [[Jagjit Singh]], and other famous Bollywood singers also gave their voices for the songs. These included [[Kavita Krishnamurthy]], [[Shankar Mahadevan]], [[Udit Narayan]], [[Sadhana Sargam]],Bhupendar Singh, and Shubha Joshi. [[Shreya Ghoshal|Shreya Goshal]] sang her first Gujarati song on the album's track, "Aaj Maaru Mann". The album was extolled for its versatility and its richness in quality.

=== 2005-Present: Anushthaan, Swarsetu, and Legacy ===
In 2012, the Swarsetu News Digest was launched by Shyamal-Saumil, a monthly magazine, which showcased art, literature, music, poetry, and drama in Gujarat. The magazine also invited famous authors and poets to write columns, and was catered for all ages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.shyamalsaumil.com/swarsetu-news-digest/|title=Swarsetu News Digest {{!}} Shyamal Saumil|last=shyamalsaumil.com|website=www.shyamalsaumil.com|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, the magazine has also launched several competitions and literature fests, and workshops are organized in several schools to help propagate Gujarati culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.facebook.com/udgamschool/posts/10156246459865713|title=Udgam School for Children|website=www.facebook.com|language=en|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aapnu Amdavad Surilu Amdavad was a project released in 2011 to celebrate the heritage of the city of Ahmedabad. All the songs in the album were accompanied with videos, making the album one of the first music video albums in Gujarati music. The videos had notable appearances by the then-Mayor of Ahmedabad, [[Asit Vora]], and Indian cricketer, [[Parthiv Patel]], and also featured songs dedicated to the festival of kites, [[International Kite Festival in Gujarat – Uttarayan|Uttarayan]], and to [[Manek Chowk (Ahmedabad)|Manekchowk]], a prominent city square in Ahmedabad.

In 2014, Shyamal-Saumil organized a 3-day music festival called Anushthaan, an event which the Times of India called a "spectacle for music-lovers."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/entertainment/gujarati/music/Amdavadis-all-set-for-Anushthan/articleshow/45492438.cms|title=Amdavadis all set for Anushthan - Times of India|work=The Times of India|access-date=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event featured artists from all around Gujarat, including Parthiv Gohil, [[Aishwarya Majmudar|Aishwariya Majmudar]], Hema Desai, Dipali Somaiyya, and nearly 50 other musicians and artists.

The events also included dance performances by Chandan and Nirali Thakore, Maulik and Ishira Shah. Being an ensemble of the arts, Anushthaan also included several poets, stand-up comedians, and actors, who gave talks, speeches, and performances. Renowned artists like Sairam Dave, [[Jay Vasavada|Jay Vasavda]], [[Dhvanit Thaker|RJ Dhvanit]], Tushar Shukla, [[Darshan Jariwala]], [[Harsh Brahmbhatt]], Archan Trivedi, and [[Abhishek Jain]] were among the celebrities present.

Suomi''' is chief of the Laboratory of Comparative Ethology at the [[National Institute of Child Health and Human Development]] (NICHD) in Bethesda, Maryland. He is also a research professor at the [[University of Virginia]], the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]], and [[Johns Hopkins University]]. He is involved with the Experience-based Brain &amp; Biological Development Program, launched in 2003 by the [[Canadian Institute for Advanced Research]].&lt;ref name=profile&gt;[http://ciar.ca/web/home.nsf/pages/home.0673 "Profile for Stephen Suomi"], Canadian Institute for Advanced Research.&lt;/ref&gt;

Suomi was elected as a Fellow of the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] for his contributions to the understanding of how socialization affects the psychological development of non-human [[primates]].&lt;ref name=profile/&gt; He worked in the early 1970s as a research assistant to psychologist Harry Harlow, showing that it was possible to rehabilitate rhesus monkeys that had been reared in social isolation for the first six months of life by temporarily housing them with socially normal monkeys. At the [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] Suomi worked with [[Harry Harlow]] to develop the [[pit of despair]], a series of controversial and widely condemned experiments on baby monkeys that have been credited by some researchers as starting the [[animal liberation movement]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Blum2002/225"&gt;Blum, Deborah. ''Love at Goon Park: Harry Harlow and the Science of Affection''. Perseus Publishing, 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;225.&lt;/ref&gt; Suomi has made no mention of the morality of his work.

==Education and career==
Suomi received a B.A. in psychology from [[Stanford University]] in 1968, and a Ph.D. in the same subject from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1971. He became a full professor with the university's psychology department in 1984, and began to work for the NICHD in 1983.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

==Work==
Suomi describes his current research interests as focusing on the role of genetic and environmental factors in shaping individual psychological development in non-human primates; the effect of change on psychological development; and whether findings on monkeys in captivity can translate to monkeys living in the wild, and between human beings of different cultures.&lt;ref name=profile/&gt;

A former Harry Harlow student, Suomi has been criticized by members of the U.S. Congress for maternal deprivation experiments on monkeys.
