The '''ATEX directive''' consists of two EU [[directive (European Union)|directive]]s describing what equipment and work space is allowed in an environment with an [[explosive]] [[atmosphere]]. ATEX derives its name from the French title of the 94/9/EC directive: ''Appareils destinés à être utilisés en '''AT'''mosphères '''EX'''plosives''.

== Directives ==

[[Image:CE with grid.svg|thumb|right|200px|The [[CE mark]] which should be attached to EU certified equipment]] 
[[File:EX-logo.svg|thumb|right|200px|Mark for ATEX certified electrical equipment for explosive atmospheres.]] 
As of July 2003, organisations in the EU must follow the directives to protect employees from explosion risk in areas with an explosive atmosphere.

There are two ATEX directives (one for the manufacturer and one for the user of the equipment):
* the ATEX 95 ''equipment'' directive 94/9/EC, Equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres;
* the ATEX 137 ''workplace'' directive 99/92/EC, Minimum requirements for improving the safety and health protection of workers potentially at risk from explosive atmospheres.

The ATEX 94/9/EU that is dedicated to the manufacturer has changed. Still applicable up to 19 April 2016 the ATEX 94/9/EC will be removed and replaced by a new directive.

This new ATEX directive was published on Saturday 29 March 2014, under the new reference : '''Directive 2014/34/EU''' of the European Parliament and of the Council of 26 February 2014 on the harmonisation of the laws of the Member States relating to equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres (recast) Text with EEA relevance  – Official Journal of the European Union L 96 from 29 March 2014.

This '''new ATEX directive 2014/34/EU''' will be mandatory for manufacturer on 20 April 2016 as is stated in article 44 of the directive.

Promised for a long time, this new ATEX directive has been published together with 8 other directives in the frame of NEW LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK (NLF) ALIGNMENT PACKAGE (Implementation of the Goods Package). It was the subject of a "COMMUNICATION FROM THE COMMISSION TO THE EUROPEAN PARLIAMENT AND THE COUNCIL" for the Alignment of ten technical harmonisation directives to Decision No 768/2008/EC of the European Parliament and of the Council of 9 July 2008 on a common framework for the marketing of products, in Brussels, 21 November 2011 under reference COM(2011) 763 final.

This texts aims to align at its origin 10 directives who were :

* Civil Explosives Directive: Directive 93/15/EEC on the harmonisation of the provisions relating to the placing on the market and supervision of explosives for civil use;
* Directive on equipment for use in explosive atmospheres (ATEX): Directive 94/9/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning equipment and protective systems intended for use in potentially explosive atmospheres; 
* Lifts Directive: Directive 95/16/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to lifts; 
* Pressure Equipment Directive: Directive 97/23/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States concerning pressure equipment; 
* Measuring Instruments Directive: Directive 2004/22/EC on measuring instruments; 
* Electromagnetic Compatibility Directive (EMC): Directive 2004/108/EC on the approximation of the laws of the Member States relating to electromagnetic compatibility; 
* Low Voltage Directive (LVD): Directive 2006/95/EC on the harmonisation of the laws of Member States relating to electrical equipment designed for use within certain voltage limits;
* Pyrotechnic Articles Directive: Directive 2007/23/EC on the placing on the market of pyrotechnic articles; 
* Non-automatic Weighing Instruments Directive: Directive 2009/23/EC on non-automatic weighing instruments;
* Simple Pressure Vessels Directive: Directive 2009/105/EC relating to simple pressure vessels

The '''text of the new ATEX 2014/34/EU''' in available on the following web site :

* [http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX:32014L0034&amp;from=EN ATEX new directive from EUR-LEX]

Regarding ATEX 99/92/EC directive, the requirement is that Employers must classify areas where [[hazardous material|hazardous]] explosive atmospheres may occur into zones. The classification given to a particular zone, and its size and location, depends on the likelihood of an explosive atmosphere occurring and its persistence if it does.

Areas classified into zones (0, 1, 2 for gas-vapor-mist and 20, 21, 22 for dust) must be protected from effective sources of [[Combustion|ignition]].&lt;ref name=HSEzones&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/fireandexplosion/zoning.pdf| publisher=HSE UK| title=Explosive Atmospheres – classification of hazardous areas (zoning) and selection of equipment}}&lt;/ref&gt; Equipment and protective systems intended to be used in zoned areas must meet the requirements of the directive. Zone 0 and 20 require Category 1 marked equipment, zone 1 and 21 require Category 2 marked equipment and zone 2 and 22 require Category 3 marked equipment. Zone 0 and 20 are the zones with the highest risk of an explosive atmosphere being present.&lt;ref name=HSEzones /&gt;

Equipment in use before July 2003 is allowed to be used indefinitely provided a [[risk assessment]] shows it is safe to do so.

The aim of directive 94/9/EC is to allow the free trade of ‘ATEX’ equipment and protective systems within the EU by removing the need for separate testing and documentation for each member state.

The regulations apply to all equipment intended for use in explosive atmospheres, whether electrical or [[machine|mechanical]], including protective systems. There are two categories of equipment 'I' for mining and 'II' for surface industries. Manufacturers who apply its provisions and affix the [[CE mark]]ing and the Ex marking are able to sell their equipment anywhere within the European union without any further requirements with respect to the risks covered being applied. The directive covers a large range of equipment, potentially including equipment used on fixed offshore platforms, in [[petrochemical]] plants, mines, [[flour mill]]s and other areas where a potentially explosive atmosphere may be present.

In very broad terms, there are three preconditions for the directive to apply: the equipment a) must have its own effective source of ignition; b) be intended for use in a potentially explosive atmosphere (air mixtures); and c) be under normal atmospheric conditions.

The directive also covers components essential for the safe use and safety devices directly contributing to the safe use of the equipment in scope. These latter devices may be outside the potentially explosive environment.

Manufacturers/suppliers (or importers, if the manufacturers are outside the EU) must ensure that their products meet essential health and safety requirements and undergo appropriate conformity procedures. This usually involves testing and [[certification]] by a ‘third-party’ certification body (known as a Notified Body e.g. [[Intertek]], Sira, [[Baseefa]], Lloyd's, [[Technischer Überwachungsverein|TUV]] ICQC) but manufacturers/suppliers can ‘self-certify’ Category 3 equipment (technical dossier including drawings, hazard analysis and users manual in the local language) and Category 2 non-electrical equipment but for Category 2 the technical dossier must be lodged with a notified body. Once certified, the equipment is marked by the ‘CE’ (meaning it complies with ATEX and all other relevant directives) and ‘Ex’ symbol to identify it as approved under the ATEX directive. The technical dossier must be kept for a period of 10 years.

Certification ensures that the equipment or protective system is fit for its intended purpose and that adequate information is supplied with it to ensure that it can be used safely. There are four ATEX classification to ensure that a specific piece of equipment or protective system is appropriate and can be safely used in a particular application: 1. Industrial or Mining Application; 2. Equipment Category; 3. Atmosphere; and 4. Temperature.

The ATEX as an EU directive finds its US equivalent under the [[HAZLOC]] standard. This standard given by the [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration]] defines and classifies hazardous locations such as explosive atmospheres.

==Technical definitions==

In DSEAR, an explosive atmosphere is defined as a mixture of dangerous substances with air, under atmospheric conditions, in the form of gases, vapours, mist or dust in which, after ignition has occurred, combustion spreads to the entire unburned mixture.

Atmospheric conditions are commonly referred to as ambient temperatures and pressures. That is to say temperatures of −20&amp;nbsp;°C to 40&amp;nbsp;°C and pressures of 0.8 to 1.1 bar.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/fireandexplosion/atex.htm| title=ATEX and explosive atmospheres| publisher=HSE UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zone classification==

The ATEX directive is covering explosions from gases but also solid dust (which, contrary to common perception, can lead to hazardous explosions&lt;ref&gt;https://www.powderprocess.net/Safety_ATEX.html&lt;/ref&gt;)

Hazard – Gas / vapour / mist

Zone 0 – A place in which an explosive atmosphere consisting of a mixture with air of dangerous substances in the form of gas, vapour or mist is present continuously or for long periods or frequently

Zone 1 – A place in which an explosive atmosphere consisting of a mixture with air of dangerous substances in the form of gas, vapour or mist is likely to occur in normal operation occasionally.

Zone 2 – A place in which an explosive atmosphere consisting of a mixture with air of dangerous substances in the form of gas, vapour or mist is not likely to occur in normal operation but, if it does occur, will persist for a short period only.

Hazard – Powder / dust

Zone 20 – A place in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is present continuously, or for long periods or frequently.

Zone 21 – A place in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is likely to occur in normal operation occasionally.

Zone 22 – A place in which an explosive atmosphere in the form of a cloud of combustible dust in air is not likely to occur in normal operation but, if it does occur, will persist for a short period only.

;Effective ignition source

'''Effective ignition source''' is a term defined in the European ATEX directive as an event which, in combination with sufficient oxygen and fuel in gas, mist, vapour or dust form, can cause an explosion. Methane, hydrogen or coal dust are examples of possible fuels.&lt;ref&gt;Michelis, J.: "Explosionsschutz im Bergbau unter Tage", Verlag Glückauf Essen, 1998, {{ISBN|3-7739-0900-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective ignition sources are:
* '''Lightning strikes'''.
* '''Open flames'''. This varies from a lit cigarette to welding activity. 
* '''Mechanically generated impact sparks.''' For example, a hammer blow on a rusty steel surface compared to a hammer blow on a flint stone. The speed and impact angle (between surface and hammer) are important; a 90 degree blow on a surface is relatively harmless. 
* '''Mechanically generated friction sparks.'''  The combination of materials and speed determine the effectiveness of the ignition source.  For example, 4.5 [[meter per second|m/s]] steel-steel friction with a force greater than 2 [[kilonewton|kN]] is an effective ignition source. The combination of aluminium and rust is also notoriously dangerous. More than one red hot spark is often necessary in order to have an effective ignition source.
* '''Electric sparks'''.  For example, a bad electrical connection or a faulty pressure transmitter. The electric energy content of the spark determines the effectiveness of the ignition source. 
* '''High surface temperature'''.  This can be the result of milling, grinding, rubbing, mechanical friction in a stuffing box or bearing, or a hot liquid pumped into a vessel. For example, the tip of a lathe cutting tool can easily be 600 Celsius (1100&amp;nbsp;°F); a high pressure steam pipe may be above the autoignition temperature of some fuel/air mixtures.
* '''Electrostatic discharge'''.  Static electricity can be generated by air sliding over a wing, or a non-conductive liquid flowing through a filter screen.
* '''Radiation'''.
* '''Adiabatic compression'''.  Air is pumped into a vessel and the vessel surface heats up.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4785">'''Atmospheric optics ray tracing codes'''  - this article list codes for light scattering using ray-tracing technique to study atmospheric optics phenomena such as rainbows and halos. Such particles can be large raindrops or hexagonal ice crystals.  Such codes are one of many approaches to calculations of [[light scattering by particles]].

==Geometric optics (ray tracing)==
{{main article|Geometric optics}}
Ray tracing techniques can be applied to study light scattering by spherical and non-spherical particles under the condition that the size of a particle is much larger than the wavelength of light. The light can be considered as collection of separate rays with width of rays much larger than the wavelength but smaller than a particle. Rays hitting the particle undergoes reflection, refraction and diffraction. These rays exit in various directions with different amplitudes and phases. Such ray tracing techniques are used to describe optical phenomena such as [[rainbow]]  of [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|halo]] on hexagonal ice crystals for large particles. 
Review of several mathematical techniques is provided in series of publications.

The 46° halo was first explained as being caused by refractions through ice crystals in 1679 by the French physicist [[Edme Mariotte|Edmé Mariotte]] (1620–1684) in terms of light refraction &lt;ref&gt;E. Mariotte, ''Quatrieme Essay.  De la Nature des Couleur'' (Paris, France:  Estienne Michallet, 1681).  Sun dogs as well as the 22° and 46° halos are explained in terms of refractions from ice crystals on [https://books.google.com/books?id=y10O12JjHskC&amp;pg=PA466#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false pages 466 - 524].&lt;/ref&gt; 
Jacobowitz in 1971 was the first to apply the ray-tracing technique to hexagonal ice crystal. Wendling et al. (1979) extended Jacobowitz's work from  hexagonal ice particle with infinite length to finite length and combined Monte Carlo technique to the ray-tracing simulations.

[[File:Mass-spring-damper-bond-graph.png|thumb|266x266px|A simple [[mass–spring–damper]] system, and its equivalent bond-graph form]]

A '''bond graph''' is a [[Graph (discrete mathematics)|graphical representation]] of a physical [[Dynamical system|dynamic system]]. It allows the conversion of the system into a [[state-space representation]]. It is similar to a [[block diagram]] or [[signal-flow graph]], with the major difference that the arcs in bond graphs represent [[Undirected graph|bi-directional]] exchange of physical [[energy]], while those in block diagrams and signal-flow graphs represent [[Directed graph|uni-directional]] flow of information. Bond graphs are multi-energy domain (e.g. mechanical, electrical, hydraulic, etc) and domain neutral. This means a bond graph can incorporate multiple domains seamlessly.

The bond graph is composed of the "bonds" which link together "single port", "double-port" and "multi-port" elements (see below for details). Each bond represents the instantaneous flow of energy (''dE''/''dt'') or [[Power (physics)|power]]. The flow in each bond is denoted by a pair of variables called power variables, whose product is the instantaneous power of the bond. The power variables are broken into two parts: flow and effort. For example, for the bond of an electrical system, the flow is the current, while the effort is the voltage. By multiplying current and voltage in this example you can get the instantaneous power of the bond.

A bond has two other features described briefly here, and discussed in more detail below. One is the "half-arrow" sign convention. This defines the assumed direction of positive energy flow. As with electrical circuit diagrams and free-body diagrams, the choice of positive direction is arbitrary, with the caveat that the analyst must be consistent throughout with the chosen definition. The other feature is the "causality". This is a vertical bar placed on only one end of the bond. It is not arbitrary. As described below, there are rules for assigning the proper causality to a given port, and rules for the precedence among ports. Causality explains the mathematical relationship between effort and flow. The positions of the causalities show which of the power variables are dependent and which are independent.

If the dynamics of the physical system to be modeled operate on widely varying time scales, fast continuous-time behaviors can be modeled as instantaneous phenomena by using a [[hybrid bond graph]]. Bond graphs were invented by [[Henry Paynter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Analysis and Design of Engineering Systems|date=1961|publisher=The M.I.T. Press|author=Paynter, Henry M.|ISBN=0-262-16004-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tetrahedron of state ==
[[File:Tetrahedron-of-state.png|thumb|Tetrahedron of state]]
The tetrahedron of state is a tetrahedron that graphically shows the conversion between effort and flow. The adjacent image shows the tetrahedron in its generalized form. The tetrahedron can be modified depending on the energy domain. The table below shows the variables and constants of the tetrahedron of state in common energy domains.

Using the tetrahedron of state, one can find a mathematical relationship between any variables on the tetrahedron. This is done by following the arrows around the diagram and multiplying any constants along the way. For example, if you wanted to find the relationship between generalized flow and generalized displacement, you would start at the ''f(t)'' and then integrate it to get ''q(t)''. More examples of equations can be seen below.

Relationship between generalized displacement and generalized flow.

&lt;math&gt;q(t) = \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot e(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized momentum.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \cdot p(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized momentum and generalized effort.

&lt;math&gt;p(t) = \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between generalized flow and generalized involving the constant C.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

All of the mathematical relationships remain the same when switching energy domains, only the symbols change. This can be seen with the following examples.

Relationship between displacement and velocity.

&lt;math&gt;x(t) = \int v(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between current and voltage, this is also known as [[Ohm's law]].

&lt;math&gt;i(t) = \frac {1}{R} \cdot V(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Relationship between force and displacement, also known as [[Hooke's law]]. It should be noted that the negative sign is dropped in this equation because the sign is factored into the way the arrow is pointing in the bond graph. 

&lt;math&gt;F(t) = k \cdot x(t)&lt;/math&gt;

== Components ==
If an engine is connected to a wheel through a shaft, the power is being transmitted in the rotational mechanical domain, meaning the effort and the flow are torque (τ) and angular velocity (ω) respectively. A word bond graph is a first step towards a bond graph, in which words define the components. As a word bond graph, this system would look like:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
A half-arrow is used to provide a sign convention, so if the engine is doing work when τ and ω are positive, then the diagram would be drawn:
: &lt;math&gt;{\text{engine}}\;\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;
This system can also be represented in a more general method. This involves changing from using the words, to symbols representing the same items. These symbols are based on the generalized form, as explained above. As the engine is applying a torque to the wheel, it will be represented as a source of effort for the system. The wheel can be presented by an impedance on the system.  Further, the torque and angular velocity symbols are dropped and replaced with the generalized symbols for effort and flow. While not necessary in the example, it is common to number the bonds, to keep track of in equations. The simplified diagram can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle e_1}{\underset{\textstyle f_1}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

Given that effort is always above the flow on the bond, it is also possible to drop the effort and flow symbols altogether, without losing any relevant information. However, the bond number should not be dropped. The example can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;{S_e}\;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}\;\text{I}&lt;/math&gt;

The bond number will be important later when converting from the bond graph to state-space equations.

=== Single-port elements ===
Single port elements are elements in a bond graph that can have only one port.

==== Sources and sinks ====
Sources are elements that represent the input for a system. They will either input effort or flow into a system. They are denoted by a capital "S" with either a lower case "e" or "f" for effort or flow respectively. Sources will always have the arrow pointing away from the element. An examples of sources include: motors (source of effort, torque), voltage sources (source of effort), and current sources (source of flow).

&lt;math&gt;S_e \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
S_f \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ J&lt;/math&gt;

Sinks are elements that represent the output for a system. They are represented the same way as sources, but have the arrow pointing into the element instead of away from it.

&lt;math&gt;J \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ S_e
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
J \;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ S_f&lt;/math&gt;

==== Inertance ====
Inertance elements are denoted by a capital "I", and always have power flowing into them. Inertance elements are elements that store kinetic energy. Most commonly these are a mass for mechanical systems, and inductors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ I&lt;/math&gt;

==== Resistance ====
Resistance elements are denoted by a capital "R", and always have power flowing into them. Resistance elements are elements that dissipate energy. Most commonly these are a dampener, for mechanical systems, and resistors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ R&lt;/math&gt;

==== Capacitance ====
Capacitance elements are denoted by a capital "C", and always have power flowing into them. Capacitance elements are elements that store potential energy. Most commonly these are springs for mechanical systems, and capacitors for electrical systems.

&lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!}}\;\ C&lt;/math&gt;

=== Two-port elements ===
These elements have two ports. They are used to change the power between or within a system. When converting from one to the other, no power is lost during the transfer. The elements have a constant that will be given with it. The constant is called a transformer constant or gyrator constant depending on which element is being used. These constants will commonly be displayed as a ratio below the element.

====Transformer====
A transformer applies a relationship between flow in flow out, and effort in effort out. Examples include an ideal electrical [[transformer]] or a [[lever]].

Denoted

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ TR\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{r:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''r'' denotes the modulus of the transformer. This means
: &lt;math&gt;f_1 \cdot r = f_2&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 \cdot r = e_1&lt;/math&gt;

====Gyrator====
A [[gyrator]] applies a relationship between flow in effort out, and effort in flow out. An example of a gyrator is a DC motor, which converts voltage (electrical effort) into Angular velocity (angular mechanical flow).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 \overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup } }\ \ \ GY\ \   \overset{\textstyle _2}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\  \\
     ^{g:1}
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

meaning that
: &lt;math&gt;e_2 = g \cdot f_1 \,&lt;/math&gt;
and
: &lt;math&gt;e_1 = g \cdot f_2.\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Multi-port elements ===
Junctions, unlike the other elements can have any number of ports either in or out. Junctions split power across their ports. There are two distant junctions, the 0-junction and the 1-junction which differ only in the how effort and flow are carried across. It should be noted that the same junction in series can be combined, but different junctions in series cannot.

==== 0-junctions ====
0-junctions behave such that all efforts values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the flow values in equals the sum the flow values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ e's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum f_{in} = \sum f_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;
\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{0}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 = e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 + f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==== 1-junctions ====
1-junctions behave opposite of 0-junctions. 1-junctions behave such that all flow values are equal across the bonds, but the sum of the effort values in equals the sum the effort values out.

&lt;math&gt;all\ f's\ are\ equal
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;\sum e_{in} = \sum e_{out}
&lt;/math&gt;

An example is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\overset{\textstyle _1}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}} 
\stackrel{\textstyle\stackrel{\textstyle _2}{\upharpoonright}}{1}
\overset{\textstyle _3}{\underset{\textstyle }{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoondown}}
&lt;/math&gt;

Resulting equations:

&lt;math&gt;f_1 = f_2 = f_3
&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;e_1 = e_2 + e_3
&lt;/math&gt;

==Causality==
Bond graphs have a notion of causality, indicating which side of a bond determines the instantaneous effort and which determines the instantaneous flow. In formulating the dynamic equations that describe the system, causality defines, for each modeling element, which variable is dependent and which is independent.  By propagating the causation graphically from one modeling element to the other, analysis of large-scale models becomes easier.  Completing causal assignment in a bond graph model will allow the detection of modeling situation where an algebraic loop exists; that is the situation when a variable is defined recursively as a function of itself.

As an example of causality, consider a capacitor in series with a battery. It is not physically possible to charge a capacitor instantly, so anything connected in parallel with a capacitor will necessarily have the same voltage (effort variable) as the capacitor. Similarly, an inductor cannot change flux instantly and so any component in series with an inductor will necessarily have the same flow as the inductor. Because capacitors and inductors are passive devices, they cannot maintain their respective voltage and flow indefinitely&amp;#x2014;the components to which they are attached will affect their respective voltage and flow, but only indirectly by affecting their current and voltage respectively.

Note: Causality is a symmetric relationship. When one side "causes" effort, the other side "causes" flow.

In bond graph notation, a causal stroke may be added to one end of the power bond to indicate that the opposite end is defining the effort. Consider a constant-torque motor driving a wheel, i.e. a source of effort (''SE''). That would be drawn as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;\begin{array}[b]{r}\text{motor}\\SE\end{array}\;
\overset{\textstyle\tau}{\underset{\textstyle\omega}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;\text{wheel}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--

   motor      τ    \|
      SE  ----------| wheel
              ω     |
--&gt;

Symmetrically, the side with the causal stroke (in this case the wheel) defines the flow for the bond.

Causality results in compatibility constraints. Clearly only one end of a power bond can define the effort and so only one end of a bond can have a causal stroke. In addition, the two passive components with time-dependent behavior, ''I'' and ''C'', can only have one sort of causation: an ''I'' component determines flow; a ''C'' component defines effort. So from a junction, ''J'', the preferred causal orientation is as follows:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;I
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;C&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
          \|
  J -------| I
           |

    |      \
  J |------- C
    |
--&gt;

The reason that this is the preferred method for these elements can be further analyzed if you consider the equations they would give shown by the tetrahedron of state.

&lt;math&gt;f(t) = \frac{1}{I} \int e(t) \operatorname{d}\!t
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
e(t) = \frac{1}{C} \int f(t) \operatorname{d}\!t&lt;/math&gt;

The resulting equations involve the integral of the independent power variable. This is preferred over the result of having the causality the other way, which results in derivative. The equations can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt;e(t) = I \cdot \dot{f}(t)
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
f(t) = C \cdot \dot{e}(t)&lt;/math&gt;

It is possible for a bond graph to have a casual bar on one of these elements in the non-preferred manner. In such a case a "casual conflict" is said to have occurred at that bond. The results of a causal conflict are only seen when writing the [[state-space]] equations for the graph. It is explained in more details in that section.

A resistor has no time-dependent behavior: apply a voltage and get a flow instantly, or apply a flow and get a voltage instantly, thus a resistor can be at either end of a causal bond:
: &lt;math&gt;J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup\!\!\!|}}\;R
\qquad \text{and} \qquad
J\;
\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}}\;R&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         \|               |       \
 J -------| R           J |-------- R
          |               |
--&gt;

Sources of flow (''SF'') define flow, sources of effort (''SE'') define effort. Transformers are passive, neither dissipating nor storing energy, so causality passes through them:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
TF
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
         | ..      |          |       .. |
   ------| TF -----|    or    |------ TF |------
         |         |          |          |
--&gt;

A gyrator transforms flow to effort and effort to flow, so if flow is caused on one side, effort is caused on the other side and vice versa:
: &lt;math&gt;\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
\qquad \text{or} \qquad
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!|}}\;
GY
\;\overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-}}\;
&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--
   |       ..      |                | .. |     
   |------ GY -----|    or    ------| GY |------
   |               |                |    |
--&gt;
; Junctions
In a 0-junction, efforts are equal; in a 1-junction, flows are equal. Thus, with causal bonds, only one bond can cause the effort in a 0-junction and only one can cause the flow in a 1-junction. Thus, if the causality of one bond of a junction is known, the causality of the others is also known. That one bond is called the 'strong bond'
: &lt;math&gt;\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\dashv\!\overset{\textstyle \top}{\underset{\textstyle\bot}{0}}\!\dashv
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\text{strong bond}\rightarrow\;\vdash\!\overset{\textstyle \bot}{\underset{\textstyle\top}{1}}\!\vdash&lt;/math&gt;&lt;!--

=== Determining causality ===
In order to determine the causality of a bond graph certain steps must be followed. Those steps are:
# Draw Source Causal Bars
# Draw Preferred causality for C and I bonds
# Draw causal bars for 0 and 1 junctions, transformers and gyrators
# Draw R bond causal bars
# If a causal conflict occurs, change C or I bond to differentiation
A walk-through of the steps is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The first step is to draw causality for the sources, over which there is only one. This results in the graph below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the preferred causality for the C bonds.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1}&amp;    &amp; \downharpoonleft   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

Next apply the causality for the 0 and 1 junctions, transformers, and gyrators.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \bar{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

However, it should be noted that there is an issue with 0-junction on the left. The 0-junction has two causal bars at the junction, but the 0-junction wants one and only one at the junction. This was caused by having &lt;math display="inline"&gt;C_2
&lt;/math&gt; be in the preferred causality. The only way to fix this is to flip that causal bar. This results in a causal conflict, the corrected version of the graph is below, with the &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\star
&lt;/math&gt; representing the causal conflict.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_f &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; TR  &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; 0   &amp; \overset{\textstyle}{\underset{\textstyle}{|\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!-\!\!\!\rightharpoonup}} &amp; C_5 \\
    &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft} \star    &amp;    &amp; ^{r:1} &amp;    &amp; \underline{\downharpoonleft}   &amp;    &amp;     \\
    &amp;    &amp; C_2 &amp;    &amp;     &amp;    &amp; R_6 &amp;    &amp;    
\end{matrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

== Converting from other systems ==
One of the main advantages of using bond graphs is that once you have a bond graph it doesn't matter the original energy domain. Below are some of the steps to apply when converting from the energy domain to a bond graph.

=== Electromagnetic ===
The steps for solving an Electromagnetic problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place an 0-junction at each node
# Insert Sources, R, I, C, TR, and GY bonds with 1 junctions
# Ground (both sides if a transformer or gyrator is present)
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Linear mechanical ===
The steps for solving an Linear Mechanical problem as a bond graph are as follows:
# Place 1-junctions for each distinct velocity (usually at a mass)
# Insert R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1 junctions where they act
# Insert Sources and I bonds on the 1 junctions where they act
# Assign power flow direction
# Simplify
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Simplifying ===
The simplifying step is the same regardless if the system was electromagnetic or linear mechanical. The steps are:
# Remove Bond of zero power (due to ground or zero velocity)
# Remove 0 and 1 junctions with less than three bonds
# Simplify parallel power
# Combine 0 junctions in series
# Combine 1 junctions in series
These steps are shown more clearly in the examples below.

=== Parallel power ===
Parallel power is when power runs in parallel in a bond graph. An example of parallel power is shown below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-example.png|frameless]]

Parallel power can be simplified, by recalling the relationship between effort and flow for 0 and 1-junctions. To solve parallel power you will first want to write down all of the equations for the junctions. For the example provided, the equations can be seen below. (Please make note of the number bond the effort/flow variable represents).

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
f_1=f_2=f_3 &amp;  &amp; e_2=e_4=e_7 \\
e_1=e_2+e_3 &amp;  &amp; f_2=f_4+f_7 \\
            &amp;  &amp;             \\
e_3=e_5=e_6 &amp;  &amp; f_7=f_6=f_8 \\
f_3=f_5+f_6 &amp;  &amp; e_7+e_6=e_8
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

By manipulating these equations you can arrange them such that you can find an equivalent set of 0 and 1-junctions to describe the parallel power.

For example because &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_3=e_6&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_2=e_7&lt;/math&gt; you can replace the variables in the equation &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_2+e_3&lt;/math&gt; resulting in &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1=e_6+e_7&lt;/math&gt; and since

&lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_6+e_7=e_8&lt;/math&gt;, we now know that &lt;math&gt;e_1=e_8&lt;/math&gt;. This relationship of two effort variables equaling can explained by an 0-junction. Manipulating other equations you can find that &lt;math&gt;f_4=f_5&lt;/math&gt; which describes the relationship of a 1-junction. Once you have determined the relationships that you need you can redraw the parallel power section with the new junctions. The result for the example show is seen below.

[[File:Bond-graph-parallel-power-solved.png|frameless]]

=== Examples ===

==== Simple electrical system ====
A simple electrical circuit consisting of a voltage source, resistor, and capacitor in series.

[[File:Simple-RC-circuit.png|frameless]]

The first step is to draw 0-junctions at all of the node. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp;  &amp;  &amp;  &amp; \\ 
 &amp; 0 &amp;  &amp; 0 &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to add all of the elements acting at their own 1-junction. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; R &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   \\ 
    &amp;   &amp; 0 &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
S_e &amp; - &amp; 1 &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; 1 &amp; - &amp; C  \\
    &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   &amp;   &amp; | &amp;   &amp;   \\
    &amp;   &amp; \underline{0} &amp; - &amp; - &amp; - &amp; 0 &amp;   &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to pick a ground. The ground is simply an 0-junction that is going to be assumed to have no voltage. For this case, the ground will be chosen to be the lower left 0-junction, that is underlined above. The next step is to draw all of the arrows for the bond graph. The arrows on junctions should point towards ground (following a similar path to current). For resistance, inertance, and compliance elements, the arrows always point towards the elements. The result of drawing the arrows can be seen below, with the 0-junction marked with a star as the ground.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that we have the Bond graph, we can start the process of simplifying it. The first step is to remove all the ground nodes. Both of the bottom 0-junctions can be removed, because they are both grounded. The result is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|199x199px]]

Next, the junctions with less than three bonds can be removed. This is because flow and effort pass through these junctions without be modified, so they can be removed to allow us to draw less. The result can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|140x140px]]

The final step is to apply causality to the bond graph. Applying causality was explained above. The final bond graph is shown below.

[[File:Simple-RC-Circuit-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|140x140px]]

==== Advanced electrical system ====
A more advanced electrical system with a current source, resistors, capacitors, and a transformer

[[File:Transformer-rc-circuit.png|frameless|464x464px]]

Following the steps with this circuit will result in the bond graph below, before it is simplified. The nodes marked with the star denote the ground.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|463x463px]]

Simplifying the bond graph will result in the image below.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|355x355px]]

Lastly, applying causality will result in the bond graph below. It should be noted that the bond with star denotes a causal conflict.

[[File:Transformer-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|348x348px]]

==== Simple linear mechanical ====
A simple linear mechanical system, consisting of a mass on a spring that is attached to a wall. The mass has some force being applied to it. An image of the system is shown below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-corrected.png|frameless|291x291px]]

For a mechanical system, the first step is to place a 1-junction at each distant velocity, in this case there are two distant velocities, the mass and the wall. It is usually helpful to label the 1-junctions for reference. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{mass} &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
         &amp;  &amp;  \\
1_{wall} &amp;  &amp; 
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The next step is to draw the R and C bonds at their own 0-junctions between the 1-junctions where they act. For this example there is only one of these bonds, the C bond for the spring. It acts between the 1-junction representing the mass and the 1-junction representing the wall. The result is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
         &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;   
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to add the sources and I bonds on the 1-junction where they act. There is one source, the source of effort (force) and one I bond, the mass of the mass both of which act on the 1-junction of the mass. The result is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
S_e:F(t)      &amp;   &amp;               \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{mass} &amp; - &amp; I:m           \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
0        &amp; - &amp; C:\frac{1}{k} \\
|        &amp;   &amp;               \\
1_{wall} &amp;   &amp;  
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

Next you want to assign power flow. Like the electrical examples, power should flow towards ground, in this case the 1-junction of the wall. Exceptions to this are R,C, or I bond, which always point towards the element. The resulting bond graph is below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless]]

Now that the bond graph has been generated, it can be simplified. Because the wall is grounded (has zero velocity), you can remove that junction. As such the 0-junction the C bond is on, can also be removed because it will then have less than three bonds. The simplified bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-2.png|frameless]]

The last step is to apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Simple-linear-mech-bond-graph-3.png|frameless]]

==== Advanced linear mechanical ====
A more advanced linear mechanical system can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech.png|frameless]]

Just like the above example, the first step is to make 1-junctions at each of the distant velocities. In this example there are three distant velocity, Mass 1, Mass 2, and the wall. Then you connect all of the bonds and assign power flow. The bond can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|318x318px]]

Next you start the process of simplifying the bond graph, by removing the 1-junction of the wall, and removing junctions with less than three bonds. The bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mechanical-bond-graph-2.png|frameless|375x375px]]

It should be noted that there is parallel power in the bond graph. Solving parallel power was explained above. The result of solving it can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-3.png|frameless|370x370px]]

Lastly, apply causality, the final bond graph can be seen below.

[[File:Advanced-linear-mech-bond-graph-4.png|frameless|348x348px]]

== State equations ==
Once a bond graph is complete, it can be utilized to generate the [[state-space representation]] equations of the system. State-space representation is especially powerful as it allows complex multi-order [[Differential equation|differential]] system to be solved as a system of first-order equations instead. The general form of the state equation can be seen below.

&lt;math&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}} (t) = \textbf{A}\cdot \textbf{x}(t) + \textbf{B}\cdot \textbf{u}(t) &lt;/math&gt;

Where, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt; is a column matrix of the [[state variable]]s, or the unknowns of the system. &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[time derivative]] of the state variables. &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt;is a column matrix of the inputs of the system. And &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are matrices of constants based on the system. The state variables of a system are &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; values for each C and I bond without a causal conflict. Each I bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p(t)&lt;/math&gt; while each C bond gets a &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, if you have the bond graph shown below.

[[File:State-equation-bond-graph-1.png|frameless|422x422px]]

Would have the following &lt;math display="inline"&gt; \dot{\textbf{x}}(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{x} (t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{u}(t)&lt;/math&gt; matrices.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{\textbf{ x} }(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
\dot{p}_3(t) \\
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{x}(t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
p_3(t) \\
q_6(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
\qquad\text{and}\qquad
\textbf{ u} (t) =
\left [\begin{matrix}
e_1(t)
\end{matrix}  \right ]
&lt;/math&gt;

The matrices of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{A}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\textbf{B}&lt;/math&gt; are solved by determining the relationship of the state variables and their respective elements, as was described in the tetrahedron of state. The first step to solve the state equations, is to list all of the governing equations for the bond graph. The table below, shows the relationship between bonds and their governing equations.

The governing equations are the following.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{matrix}
input=e_1                                                                   &amp; eq. 1  \\
e_1=e_2+e_3+e_4                                                             &amp; eq. 2  \\
f_1=f_2=f_3=f_4                                                             &amp; eq. 3  \\
e_2=R_2 \cdot f_2                                                           &amp; eq. 4  \\
f_3 = \frac{1}{I_3} \int e_3 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac{1}{I_3} \cdot p_3  &amp; eq. 5  \\
f_4 \cdot r = f_5                                                           &amp; eq. 6  \\
e_5 \cdot r = e_4                                                           &amp; eq. 7  \\
e_5 = e_6= e_7                                                              &amp; eq. 8  \\
f_5=f_6+f_7                                                                 &amp; eq. 9  \\
e_6 = \frac{1}{C_5} \int f_6 \operatorname{d}\!t = \frac {1}{C_6} \cdot q_6 &amp; eq. 10 \\
f_7 = \frac{1}{R_7} \cdot e_7                                               &amp; eq. 11
\end{matrix}&lt;/math&gt;

These equations can be manipulated to yield the state equations. For this example, you are trying to find equations that relate &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)&lt;/math&gt; in terms of &lt;math display="inline"&gt;p_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math display="inline"&gt;q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math display="inline"&gt;e_1(t)&lt;/math&gt;.

To start you should recall from the tetrahedron of state that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t)&lt;/math&gt;starting with equation 2, you can rearrange it so that &lt;math&gt;e_3 = e_1 - e_2 - e_4&lt;/math&gt;. &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt; can be substituted for equation 4, while in equation 4, &lt;math&gt;f_2&lt;/math&gt; can be replaced by &lt;math&gt;f_3&lt;/math&gt;due to equation 3, which can then be replaced by equation 5. &lt;math&gt;e_4&lt;/math&gt; can likewise be replaced using equation 7, in which &lt;math&gt;e_5&lt;/math&gt;can be replaced with &lt;math&gt;e_6&lt;/math&gt; which can then be replaced with equation 10. Following these substituted yields the first state equation which is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{p}_3(t) = e_3(t) = e_1(t) - \frac {R_2}{I_3} \cdot p_3(t) - \frac{r}{C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

The second state equation can likewise be solved, by recalling that &lt;math display="inline"&gt;\dot{q}_6(t) = f_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The second state equation is shown below.

&lt;math&gt;\dot{q}_6(t)=f_6(t)=\frac{r}{I_3}\cdot p_3(t) - \frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6} \cdot q_6(t)&lt;/math&gt;

Both equations can further be rearranged into matrix form. The result of which is below.

&lt;math&gt;\begin{bmatrix}
\dot{p}_3(t)\\ 
\dot{q}_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} =
\begin{bmatrix}
- \frac{R_2}{I_3} &amp; - \frac{r}{C_6}\\ 
 \frac{r}{I_3} &amp; -\frac{1}{R_7 \cdot C_6}
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
p_3(t)\\ 
q_6(t)
\end{bmatrix} +
\begin{bmatrix}
1\\ 
0
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1(t)
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

At this point the equations can be treated as any other [[state-space representation]] problem.

'''Color [[moment (mathematics)|moments]]''' are measures that characterise color distribution in an image in the same way that [[central moment]]s uniquely describe a [[probability distribution]]. Color moments are mainly used for color indexing purposes as features in [[image retrieval]] applications in order to compare how similar two images are based on color. Usually one image is compared to a [[database]] of [[digital images]] with pre-computed features in order to find and retrieve a similar Image. Each comparison between images results in a similarity score, and the lower this score is the more identical the two images are supposed to be.

== Overview ==

Color moments are [[scale invariance|scaling]] and [[rotational invariance|rotation]] invariant. It is usually the case that only the first three color moments are used as features in image retrieval applications as most of the color distribution information is contained in the low-order moments.&lt;ref&gt;Hui Yu, Mingjing Li, Hong-Jiang Zhang, Jufu Feng. "Color Texture Moments for Content-Based Image Retrieval". Proc. IEEE Intl Conf. on Image Processing, pp. 929-932, Sep. 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Since color moments encode both shape and color information they are a good feature to use under changing lighting conditions, but they cannot handle occlusion very successfully.&lt;ref&gt;Xiaoyin Duanmu. "Image Retrieval Using Color Moment Invariant". Seventh International Conference on Information Technology, pp. 200-203, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Color moments can be computed for any [[color model]]. Three color moments are computed per channel (e.g. 9 moments if the color model is [[RGB]] and 12 moments if the color model is [[CMYK]]). Computing color moments is done in the same way as computing moments of a probability distribution.

=== Mean ===
{{Main|Mean}}
The first color moment can be interpreted as the average color in the image, and it can be calculated by using the following formula

:&lt;math&gt;E_i=\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^{N} \frac{1}{N}p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt;

where N is the number of pixels in the image and &lt;math&gt;p_{ij}&lt;/math&gt; is the value of the j-th pixel of the image at the i-th color channel.

=== Standard Deviation ===
{{Main|Standard_deviation}}
The second color moment is the [[standard deviation]], which is obtained by taking the square root of the [[variance]] of the color distribution.

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i=\sqrt{(\frac{1}{N}\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^{N}(p_{ij}-E_i)^2)}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;E_i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[mean]] value, or first color moment, for the i-th color channel of the image.

=== Skewness ===
{{Main|Skewness}}
The third color moment is the [[skewness]]. It measures how asymmetric the color distribution is, and thus it gives information about the shape of the color distribution. Skewness can be computed with the following formula:
:&lt;math&gt;s_i=\sqrt[3]{(\frac{1}{N}\textstyle\sum_{j=1}^{N}(p_{ij}-E_i)^3)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Kurtosis ===
{{Main|Kurtosis}}
Kurtosis is the fourth color moment, and, similarly to skewness, it provides information about the shape of the color distribution. More specifically, kurtosis is a measure of how flat or tall the distribution is in comparison to normal distribution.

=== Higher-order color moments ===
{{Main|Moment_(mathematics)#Higher_moments}}
Higher-order color moments are usually not part of the color moments feature set in image retrieval tasks as they require more data in order to obtain a good estimate of their value, and also the lower-order moments generally provide enough information.

== Applications ==

Color moments have significant applications in [[image retrieval]]. They can be used in order to compare how similar two images are. This is a relatively new approach to color indexing. The greatest advantage of using color moments comes from the fact that there is no need to store the complete color distribution.&lt;ref name="Similarity of Color Images"&gt;M. Stricker and M. Orengo. "Similarity of Color Images". In SPIE Conference on Storage and Retrieval for Image and Video Databases III, volume 2420, pp. 381-392, Feb. 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; This greatly speeds up image retrieval since there are less features to compare. In addition, the first three color moments have the same units, which allows for comparison between them.&lt;ref&gt;V. Chitkara, M.A. Nascimento, and C. Mastaller. "Content-Based Image Retrieval Using Binary Signatures". In Technical Report TR-00-18, Department of Computing Science, University of Alberta, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Color indexing ===

Color indexing is the main application of color moments. Images can be indexed, and the index will contain the computed color moments. Then, if someone has a particular image and wants to find similar images in the database, the color moments of the image of interest will also be computed. After that the following function will be used in order to compute a similarity score between the image of interest and all the images in the database:
:&lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)=\textstyle\sum_{i=1}^{r}w_{i1}|E_i^1-E_i^2|+w_{i2}|\sigma_i^1-\sigma_i^2|+w_{i3}|s_i^1-s_i^2|&lt;/math&gt;
where:
:*H and I are the color distributions of the two images that are being compared
:*i is the channel index and r is the total number of channels
:*&lt;math&gt;E_i^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;E_i^2&lt;/math&gt; are the first order moments computed for the image distributions.
:*&lt;math&gt;\sigma_i^1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\sigma_i^2&lt;/math&gt; are the second order moments computed for the image distributions.
:*s_i^1 and s_i^2 are the third order moments computed for the image distributions.
:*&lt;math&gt;w_{i1}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;w_{i2}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;w_{i3}&lt;/math&gt; are weights, specified by the user, for each of the three color moments used.
Finally, the images in the database will be ranked according to the computed similarity score with the image of interest, and the database images with the lowest &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; value should be retrieved. "A retrieval based on &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; may produce false positives because the index contains no information about the correlation between the color channels".&lt;ref name="Similarity of Color Images"/&gt;

== Example ==

A simple and concise example of the use of color moments for image retrieval tasks is illustrated in.&lt;ref&gt;Noah Keen. "Color Moments". Feb. 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider having several test images in a database and a "New Image". The goal is to retrieve images from the database that are similar to the "New Image". The first three color moments are used as features. There are several steps in this computation.

#'''Image preprocessing (Optional)''' - The image preprocessing step of the computation process is optional. For example, in this step all images could be modified to be the same size (in terms of pixels). However, since color moments are invariant to scaling, it is not necessary to make all images the same width and height.
#'''Computing the features''' - Use the color moments formulae in order to compute the first three moments for each of the color channels in the image. For example, if the HSV color space is used, this means that for each of the images, 9 features in total will be computed (the first three order moments for the Hue, Saturation, and Value channels).
#'''Calculating the similarity score''' - After computing the color moments the weights for each of the moments in the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; function should be determined by the user. The weights have to be adjusted each time in accordance with the application or condition and quality of the images. Following that the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; function is used to calculate a similarity score for the "New Image" and each of the images in the database.
#'''Ranking and image retrieval''' - From the previous step the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; values were obtained. Now a comparison of these values can be made in order to decide which of the images in the database are more similar to the "New Image", and thus rank the database images accordingly. The smaller the &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; value is the more similar the two color distributions are supposed to be. Finally, some of the top ranked images (the ones with the smallest &lt;math&gt;d_{mom}(H,I)&lt;/math&gt; value) from the database are retrieved.

&lt;/ref&gt; the '''Coulomb gap''' is a soft gap in the Single-Particle [[Density of states|Density of States]]  (DOS) of a system of interacting localized electrons.
Due to the long-range Coulomb interactions, the single-particle DOS vanishes at the chemical potential, at low enough temperatures, such that thermal excitations do not wash out the gap.

== Theory ==
At zero temperature, a classical treatment of a system gives an upper bound for the DOS near the [[Fermi]]-energy, first suggested by [[Alexei L. Efros|Efros]] and [[Boris Shklovskii|Shklovskii]].&lt;ref name="EfrosShklovskii1"&gt;A L Efros and B I Shklovskii , J. Phys. C8, L49 (1975)&lt;/ref&gt; The argument is as follows:
Let us look at the [[ground state]] configuration of the system. Defining &lt;math&gt; E_i &lt;/math&gt; as the energy of an [[electron]] at site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, due to the disorder and the Coulomb interaction with all other electrons (we define this both for occupied and unoccupied sites), it is easy to see that the energy needed to move an electron from an occupied site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt; to an unoccupied site &lt;math&gt; j &lt;/math&gt; is given by the expression:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta E=E_j-E_i-e^2/r_{ij} &lt;/math&gt;.
The subtraction of the last term accounts for the fact that &lt;math&gt; E_j &lt;/math&gt; contains a term due to the interaction with the electron present at site &lt;math&gt; i &lt;/math&gt;, but after moving the electron this term should not be considered. It is easy to see from this that there exists an energy &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; such that all sites with energies above it are empty, and below it are full (this is the Fermi energy, but since we are dealing with a system with interactions it is not obvious a-priori that it is still well-defined).
Assume we have a finite single-particle DOS at the Fermi energy, &lt;math&gt; g(E_f) &lt;/math&gt;. For every possible transfer of an electron from an occupied site i to an unoccupied site j, the energy invested should be positive, since we are assuming we are in the ground state of the system, i.e., &lt;math&gt;\Delta E&gt;=0 &lt;/math&gt;.
Assuming we have a large system, let us consider all the sites with energies in the interval &lt;math&gt; [E_f-\epsilon, E_f+\epsilon].  &lt;/math&gt; The number of these, by assumption, is  &lt;math&gt;  N= 2 \epsilon g(E_f).  &lt;/math&gt; As explained, &lt;math&gt; N/2&lt;/math&gt; of these would be occupied, and the others unoccupied. Of all pairs of occupied and unoccupied sites, let us choose the one where the two are closest to each other. If we assume the sites are randomly distributed in space, we find that the distance between these two sites is of order:
&lt;math&gt;  R \sim (N/V)^{-1/d} &lt;/math&gt;, where d is the dimension of space.
Plugging the expression for &lt;math&gt; N &lt;/math&gt; into the previous equation, we obtain the inequality:
&lt;math&gt; E_j-E_i-C e^2 (\epsilon g(E_f)/V)^{1/d} &gt;0 &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt; C&lt;/math&gt; is a coefficient of order unity. Since  &lt;math&gt; E_j-E_i &lt;2\epsilon &lt;/math&gt;, this inequality will necessarily be violated for small enough &lt;math&gt; \epsilon &lt;/math&gt;. Hence, assuming a finite DOS at &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; led to a contradiction. Repeating the above calculation under the assumption that the DOS near &lt;math&gt; E_f &lt;/math&gt; is proportional to &lt;math&gt; (E-E_f)^\alpha &lt;/math&gt; shows that &lt;math&gt; \alpha&gt;=d-1 &lt;/math&gt;.  This is an upper bound for the Coulomb gap. Efros &lt;ref&gt;A. L. Efros, J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys 9, 2021 (1976)&lt;/ref&gt; considered single electron excitations, and obtained an integro-differential equation for the DOS, showing the Coulomb gap in fact  follows the above equation (i.e., the upper bound is a tight bound).

Other treatments of the problem include a mean-field numerical approach,&lt;ref&gt;M. Grunewald, B. Pohlmann, L. Schweitzer, and D.Wurtz,J. Phys. C: Solid State Phys., 15, L1153 (1982)&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as more recent treatments such as,&lt;ref&gt;M. Muller and S. Pankov, Phys. Rev. B. 75, 144201 (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; also verifying the upper bound suggested above is a tight bound. Many Monte-Carlo simulations were also performed,&lt;ref&gt;J. H. Davies, P. A. Lee, and T. M. Rice, Phys. Rev. Lett. 49, 758 - 761 (1982)
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Mobius, M. Richter, and B. Drittler, Phys. Rev. B 45, 11568 (1992)&lt;/ref&gt;  some of them in disagreement with the result quoted above. Few works deal with the quantum aspect of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;G. Vignale, Phys. Rev. B 36, 8192(1987)
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental observations ==

Direct experimental confirmation of the gap has been done via tunneling experiments, which probed the single-particle DOS in two and three dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;J. G. Massey and M. Lee, Phys. Rev. Lett. 75, 4266 (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;V. Y. Butko, J. F. Ditusa, and P. W. Adams, Phys. Rev. Lett. 84, 1543 (2000).&lt;/ref&gt; The experiments clearly showed a linear gap in two-dimensions, and a parabolic gap in three-dimensions.
Another experimental consequence of the Coulomb gap is found in the conductivity of samples in the localized regime.
The existence of a gap in the spectrum of excitations would result in a lowered conductivity than that predicted by [[Variable range hopping|Mott Variable range hopping]]. If one uses the analytical expression of the Single-Particle DOS in the Mott derivation, a universal &lt;math&gt; e^{-1/T^{1/2}} &lt;/math&gt; is obtained, for any dimension.&lt;ref&gt;B. Shklovskii and A. Efros, Electronic properties of doped
semiconductors (Springer-Verlag, Berlin, 1984).&lt;/ref&gt; The observation of this is expected to occur below a certain temperature, such that the optimal energy of hopping would be smaller than the width of the Coulomb gap. The transition from Mott to so-called Efros-Shklovskii Variable Range Hopping has been observed experimentally for various systems.&lt;ref&gt;A. Y. Rogatchev and U. Mizutani, Phys. Rev. B. 61, 15550
(2000).&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, no rigorous derivation of the Efros-Shklovskii conductivity formula has been put forth, and in some experiments &lt;math&gt; e^{-1/T^{\alpha}} &lt;/math&gt; behavior is observed, for alpha which fits neither the Mott nor the Efros-Shklovskii theories.

'''Deep Green Resistance''' ('''DGR''') is a radical environmental movement that views mainstream [[Environmentalism|environmental activism]] as being largely ineffective.&lt;ref name=McBay&gt;McBay, Aric, Lierre Keith, and Derrick Jensen. 2011. ''Deep Green Resistance.'' New York: Seven Stories Press.&lt;/ref&gt; DGR is also used by group members to refer to their particular political strategies. The group believes that [[industrial civilization]], as they define it, is endangering all life on the planet and that a broad range of tactics are needed to achieve [[environmental justice|environmental]] and [[social justice]]. They argue for a radical shift in societal structures and functions.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Beliefs==
In the book ''Deep Green Resistance'', the authors state that civilization, particularly [[industrialisation|industrial civilization]], is fundamentally unsustainable and must be actively (and urgently) dismantled in order to secure a livable future for all species on the planet.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt; Civilization can be defined as the development of agriculture and the growth of cities. Deep Green Resistance argues that agriculture is detrimental to land fertility and cities necessarily surpass the natural carrying capacity of land bases. Civilization relies heavily on industry, which operates largely on non-renewable and unclean fossil fuels.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

DGR's principles stem from the concept of [[deep ecology]] and state that all species are inherently equal, and thus humans are not superior to any other form of life. Deep ecology attributes the current environmental crisis to the anthropocentrism that is embedded in Western perspectives. The term, first used by the Norwegian philosopher [[Arne Næss]], was quickly taken up by a variety of radical environmental groups, such as Earth First!.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob, Merle. 1994. “Sustainable Development and Deep Ecology: An Analysis of Competing Traditions.” Environmental Management 18(4):477-488.&lt;/ref&gt; Deep ecology provides a foundation upon which to base the cross-cultural nature-based spirituality that is often associated with radical environmental movements.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, Bron. 2001. “Earth and Nature-Based Spirituality (Part I): From Deep Ecology to Radical Environmentalism.” Religion 31:175-193.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement differentiates itself from [[bright green environmentalism]], which is characterized by a focus on personal, technological, or government and corporate solutions, in that it holds these solutions as inadequate. DGR believes that lifestyle changes, such as using travel mugs and reusable bags and taking shorter showers, are too small for the large-scale environmental problems the world faces. It also states that the recent surge in environmentalism has become commercial in nature, and thus in itself has been industrialized. The movement asserts that per capita industrial waste produced is orders of magnitude greater than personal waste produced; therefore, it is industrialism that must be ended, and with that, lifestyle changes will follow.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Origins and advocates==
The term was created for a conference entitled "Deep Green Resistance. Confronting Industrial Culture" in April, 2007 in Deerfield, Massachusetts. [[Lierre Keith]] was the main organizer.

Deep Green theory draws on elements of [[anthropology]], [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], [[deep ecology]] and [[ecofeminism]].

[[Derrick Jensen]] is a prominent member of the Deep Green Resistance Advisory Board. In addition to being a radical activist, he is also a writer, philosopher and teacher. Lierre Keith, another board member, is a feminist activist, writer and small farmer. Stephanie McMillan, and [[Jack D. Forbes]] are also prominent influences on the movement. DGR draws on the philosophy and writings of many authors, including [[Arne Næss]], [[Richard Manning]], [[Andrea Dworkin]], Peggy Reeves Sanday, [[David Abram]], [[Chellis Glendinning]], [[Chris Hedges]], [[Joseph Tainter]], [[Richard Heinberg]], [[Daniel Quinn]], Tracie Marie Park (a.k.a. Zoe Blunt) and [[Jerry Mander]], among others.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Resistance tactics==
The Deep Green perspective argues that the dominant culture, a term that encompasses all the cultures within globalized civilization, will not undergo a voluntary transformation to a sustainable way of living. This includes the dismissal of a possible success of a slow and soft shift to [[sustainability]]. Members of the Deep Green movement believe that industrial civilization will inevitably collapse. This notion is based on historical examples of the collapse of major civilizations such as Rome or the Mayan civilization, and statistics regarding the current system's unsustainability. DGR maintains that humans must act decisively before the collapse to ensure the Earth that remains inhabitable for all organisms and that humans build a more sustainably structured society following the collapse.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt; Deep Green Resistance supports an active resistance movement with the objective of accelerating the collapse of industrial civilization.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

Within the Deep Green theory, lifestyle or personal changes are not considered effective methods of creating meaningful change. The mainstream environmental movement is seen as being distracted by its emphasis on individual lifestyle changes and technological solutions instead of confronting systems of power and holding individuals, industries, and institutions accountable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.orionmagazine.org/index.php/articles/article/4801/ |title=Forget Shorter Showers |publisher=Orion Magazine |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fertileground1.ning.com/page/a-context-for-fg |title=Archived copy |accessdate=October 6, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009210832/http://fertileground1.ning.com/page/a-context-for-fg |archivedate=October 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders of the Deep Green movement view technological solutions, no matter how well-intentioned, as unsatisfactory and warn that they could even lead to accelerated ecological destruction and pollution.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

===Advocating for militant resistance===
Decisive Ecological Warfare:&lt;ref name=DGRDEW&gt;{{cite web|title=Decisive Ecological Warfare|url=http://deepgreenresistance.org/en/deep-green-resistance-strategy/decisive-ecological-warfare|website=deepgreenresistance.org|publisher=Deep Green Resistance|accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Well-organized underground militants would make coordinated attacks on energy infrastructure around the world … actions against pipelines, power lines, tankers, and refineries, perhaps using electromagnetic pulses. ….&lt;ref name=C&amp;C&gt;{{cite web|author1=Ian Angus|title='Deep Green Resistance' – How not to build a movement|url=http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/05/10/deep-green-resistance-a-path-to-certain-defeat/|website=climateandcapitalism.com|publisher=Climate &amp; Capitalism|accessdate=February 9, 2015|format=Book review|date=May 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Proponents of Deep Green Resistance encourage strategies for [[social action]] that range from violent to non-violent. DGR's support for militant action (described as a potentially necessary means by which to invoke drastic environmental change) is rejected by many [[pacifist]]s. Some have called this a potential deterrent to environmentalists who believe in nonviolent activism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.counterpunch.org/2011/12/20/deep-green-resistance/ |title=Deep Green Resistance |website=Counterpunch.org |date=2011-12-20 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The strategy described by Jensen, McBay and Keith largely centers around hard-hitting infrastructural sabotage, such as forcible [[dam removal]], rather than any kind of personal violence.

Jensen predicts, regarding the movement, that acts of personal violence in the future will be almost completely offensive by those countering the resistance movement (i.e. those currently in power) and self-defensive by those enacting the resistance movement. When asked, "If we dismantle civilization, won't that kill millions of people in cities? What about them?," Jensen has responded that "No matter what you do, your hands will be blood red... because the global economy is [already] murdering humans and non-humans the planet over...." and "As this culture continues to collapse, those who are doing the exploiting will continue.... Don’t blame those who want to stop that exploitation. Instead, help to stop the exploitation that is killing people in the first place."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Millions Killed?|work=Deep Green Resistance|url=http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/faq/millionskilled/|accessdate=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jensen has also clarified such ideas on ''[[Democracy Now!]]'': "I get accused of being the 'violence guy'... but I don’t ever think that's really fair, because I really consider myself the 'everything guy', that I want to put everything on the table and talk about all forms of resistance.... We can certainly parse out cases where we think it's appropriate to have militant response or non-militant response."&lt;ref name = DN112610&gt;{{cite interview|last=Jensen|first=Derrick|interviewer=[[Amy Goodman]]|work=[[Democracy Now!]]|date=26 November 2010|url=http://www.democracynow.org/2010/11/26/author_and_activist_derrick_jensen|title=Author and Activist Derrick Jensen: "The Dominant Culture is Killing the Planet...It’s Very Important for Us to Start to Build a Culture of Resistance"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith has discussed in depth the "complexity of the issue of violence" in the organization's [[eponymous]] book, and how it is "understandable that people who care about justice want to reject violence; many of us are survivors of it." However, she urges the following distinctions, favoring only the second in each dichotomy: "the violence of hierarchy vs. the violence of self-defense, violence against actual people vs. violence against property, and the [use of] violence as self-actualization vs. the violence of political resistance. It is difficult to find someone who is against all of these."&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

While Deep Green Resistance maintains that it is a strictly aboveground movement, Keith and McBay have openly encouraged an additional element of underground action, and DGR provides the theoretical and aboveground framework to support such action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.deepgreenresistance.org|title=Deep Green Resistance Homepage|website=Deepgreenresistance.org|accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization's book points to historical examples of resistance movements that relied on an interdependence between aboveground and underground networks in order to accomplish mutual goals.

==Literature and references==
A book titled ''Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet'' by Aric McBay, [[Lierre Keith]], and [[Derrick Jensen]] was released in May 2011, from Seven Stories Press.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Deep Green Resistance: Strategy to Save the Planet |author1=Derrick Jensen |author2=Aric McBay |author3=Lierre Keith |isbn=9781583229293 |website=Amazon.com |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The book is divided into four sections: Resistance, Organization, Strategy and Tactics, and the Future. Each section contains several essays written by McBay or Keith and concludes with Jensen's answers to common questions about resistance. The book intends to provide a framework from which readers can build upon in order to begin fighting for environmental change.&lt;ref name=McBay/&gt;

==Gender issues==
The organization's official website states that "DGR strives to be a radical organization in every respect, including our approach to feminist struggles."&lt;ref name=radfem&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/faq-radical-feminism/ |title=FAQ: Radical Feminism |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; DGR's [[radical feminism]] views [[gender role|gender]], by definition, as a social system created by [[patriarchy]] to coercively and violently control behavior of both males and females; however, within this system, men and masculinity are privileged, while women are trained into subordinated behavior and routinely targeted for institutionalized and socially sanctioned violence due to their sex and/or gender role.{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}

DGR's stance on gender has led some to interpret DGR as transphobic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://earthfirstnews.wordpress.com/2013/05/15/deep-green-transphobia/ |title=Deep Green Transphobia |work=earthfirstnews.wordpress.com |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The controversy especially swelled when a newly [[Transitioning (transgender)|transitioning]] member of DGR, self-identifying as a woman, requested to join a women-only communal sleeping and showering space and, later, a women-only caucus space; the women's caucus discussed the issue collectively and ultimately denied the applicant.{{citation needed|date=March 2014}} A year after this, Aric McBay claimed he "left the organization at the beginning of 2012 after a trans inclusive policy was cancelled by Derrick Jensen and Lierre Keith. Many good people and good activists left the organization for that reason. I find these transphobic attitudes to be disgusting and deeply troubling...."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aricmcbay.org/2013/05/14/dgr-and-transphobia/ |title=DGR and Transphobia |first=Aric |last=McBay |work=aricmcbay.org |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/2013/05/16/deep-green-reclamation/ |title=Deep Green Resignation and Reclamation &amp;#124; Earth First!

Keith and Jensen reiterated that the women of DGR made the decision to deny the applicant for themselves. In this statement, DGR also affirmed that "the right of women to define their own spaces" is central to how the organization operates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/reponse-to-aric-mcbay/ |title=Reponse(sic) to Aric McBay |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |quote=the right of women to define their own spaces |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization has denied these claims,&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.deepgreenresistance.org/protect-women-feminism-and-free-speech/ |title=Protect Women, Feminism, and Free Speech |work=deepgreenresistance.org |year=2013 |accessdate=19 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; explaining that "DGR does not condone dehumanization or violence against anyone, including people who describe themselves as trans."&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org" /&gt; The website asserts that DGR holds "a difference of opinion about the definition of gender" with [[genderism|genderists]], and states that "genderists think gender is an identity, an internal set of feelings people might have. Radical feminists think gender is a caste system."&lt;ref name="deepgreenresistance.org"/&gt; DGR's view of gender as a caste system implies that gender is an institution that cannot be improved or remedied, but, rather, requires complete dismantling so that egalitarian, spontaneous, and free behavior can emerge.&lt;ref name="radfem"/&gt; Because DGR inherently defines gender as "a brutal and corrupt arrangement of power," they want to dismantle the gender system, rather than reform it, celebrate it, or make it more inclusive. DGR, as self-described radical feminists, are "critical of gender itself. We are not gender reformists—we are gender abolitionists."&lt;ref name=radfem/&gt;

==Criticism==

Critics of Deep Green Resistance have made claims similar to critics of [[anarcho-primitivism]] and [[deep ecology]]. DGR's ideas have been variously criticized by online publications as polarizing solutions to environmental reform, "elitist", "too radical", or "out of step."&lt;ref name="climateandcapitalism.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Posted on May 10, 2012 |url=http://climateandcapitalism.com/2012/05/10/deep-green-resistance-a-path-to-certain-defeat/ |title='Deep Green Resistance' - A path to certain defeat |website=Climateandcapitalism.com |date=2012-05-10 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founder Derrick Jensen, for example, has concluded in his earlier work ''Endgame'' that "The mass of civilized people will never be on our side.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LGL8PCVc_pcC&amp;pg=PT173&amp;lpg=PT173&amp;dq=%22The+mass+of+civilized+people+will+never+be+on+our+side%22+jensen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=crnwS2f7R7&amp;sig=Pg8F6ze5TXizSQ23qnKw3wpSaFg&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yxCNUdzXOIi5rgH89YDgAw&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAQ |title=The Derrick Jensen Reader: Writings on Environmental Revolution |author=Derrick Jensen |website=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has led to the criticism of organizing a strategy that is pessimistic about popular involvement, and therefore aims at forcing change without the majority's consensus. Some critics have, therefore, argued that "radical tactics tend to be counterproductive to the goal of increasing awareness and concern in the general public."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Taylor |first=Bron |url=http://www.earthisland.org/journal/index.php/elist/eListRead/resistance_do_the_ends_justify_the_means |title=Resistance: Do the Ends Justify the Means? &amp;#124; Latest News &amp;#124; Earth Island Journal &amp;#124; Earth Island Institute |website=Earthisland.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of Deep Green Resistance further claim that DGR, which predicts massive numbers of human deaths during the forthcoming "crash" of civilization, does not offer a feasible or desirable alternative human lifestyle in seeking to accelerate this crash.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.therightplanet.com/2012/01/deep-green-resistance-occupy-until-it-all-falls-apart/ |title=Deep Green Resistance: Occupy Until It All Falls Apart |website=Therightplanet.com |date=2012-01-02 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Keith and Jensen have both acknowledged this unpleasant reality; however, they have repeatedly claimed that the crash is inevitable (and will only result in more suffering the longer it is delayed) and that they are merely warning of—and trying to prepare the world for—these forthcoming deaths and possible wide-scale violence. Jensen has stated that if activists do not wish to participate in the physical work of accelerating this crash, they, at the very least, should locally prepare and "set up committees to eliminate or, if appropriate, channel the (additional) violence that might break out."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=It's Time to Get Out|author=Jensen, Derrick|work=Endgame|url=http://www.endgamethebook.org/Excerpts/18-Time-Get-Out.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchists who believe that all hierarchically structured relations, whatever the purpose, are oppressive, disagree with DGR's promotion of the use of hierarchical organization within any underground.&lt;ref name="EF Critique"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archive.org/details/AnarchyRadio03-08-2011/ |title=Anarchy Radio 03-08-2011 : John Zerzan : Free Download &amp; Streaming : Internet Archive |website=Archive.org |date= |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBay and Keith have both promoted the idea of underground networks organized along hierarchical lines. Keith has advocated for a disciplined "command structure" regarding frontline activists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|title=Deep Green Resistance - Strategy to Save the Planet|publisher=YouTube|date=12 August 2011|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ZxBg1CbmG8}}&lt;/ref&gt; McBay, in ''Deep Green Resistance'', has argued that hierarchies are an efficient means of organizing underground resistance.&lt;ref name="sproutdistro1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sproutdistro.com/2013/05/18/deep-green-resistance-a-book-review/ |title=Deep Green Resistance: A Book Review |publisher=Sprout Distro |date=2013-05-18 |accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anarchist writers—among them anarcho-primitivists like [[John Zerzan]]&lt;nowiki/&gt; and [[Kevin Tucker (anarchist)|Kevin Tucker]]—have criticized DGR's Code of Conduct, their historical understanding of revolution and radical history, and the perceived "cult of personality" around Jensen and Keith.&lt;ref name="EF Critique"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthfirstjournal.org/newswire/articles/deep-green-resistance-a-critique|title=Deep Green Resistance — a critique|first1=Michelle| last1=Matisons|first2=Alexander Reid|last2=Ross|publisher=[[Earth First!]] Journal|year=2014–2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://earthspiritandanarchy.blogspot.com/2011/09/down-graded-resistance-critique-of-dgr.html/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131218172433/http://earthspiritandanarchy.blogspot.com/2011/09/down-graded-resistance-critique-of-dgr.html |archivedate=December 18, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://anarchistnews.org/node/14669/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121103175958/http://anarchistnews.org/node/14669 |archivedate=November 3, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://enkidu.anarchyplanet.org/2011/06/10/authority-and-civilization/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=May 21, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120710101150/http://enkidu.anarchyplanet.org/2011/06/10/authority-and-civilization/ |archivedate=July 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sproutdistro1"/&gt;

{{distinguish|Devil's gardens}}

In [[myrmecology]] and [[forest]] [[ecology]], a '''devil's garden''' ([[Kichwa language|Kichwa]]: ''Supay chakra'',&lt;ref&gt;David P. Edwards, Megan E. Frederickson, Glenn H. Shepard, and Douglas W. Yu (2009): ''[http://labs.eeb.utoronto.ca/frederickson/ac-content/uploads/edwardsetal2009.pdf A Plant Needs Ants like a Dog Needs Fleas: Myrmelachista schumanni Ants Gall Many Tree Species to Create Housing.]'' The American Naturalist 174, no. 5: pp. 734-740.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Spanish language|Spanish]]: ''Jardín del Curupira'') is a large [[stand level modelling|stand of tree]]s in the [[Amazon Rainforest]] consisting almost exclusively of a single species, ''[[Duroia hirsuta]]''. Devil's gardens are immediately recognizable because the dominance of a single tree species is dramatically different from the [[biodiversity]] of the forest as a whole.

Devil's gardens got their name because locals believed that an evil forest spirit ''[[Chullachaqui|Chullachaki]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://headoverheels.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2009/04/ayahuasca_visions_-_pablo_amaringo.pdf Pablo Amaringo: Ayahuasca Visions] - "a vision of the Supay-chacra or garden of the Chullachaki."&lt;/ref&gt; (meaning "uneven foot, single foot" in Kichwa) lived in them.

The [[ant]] ''[[Myrmelachista schumanni]]'' creates devil's gardens by systematically poisoning all plants in the vicinity except ''D. hirsuta'', the tree in which it nests. The ant poisons the plants by [[Injection (medicine)|injecting]] [[formic acid]] into the base of the [[leaf]]. By killing other plants, the ant promotes the growth and reproduction of ''D. hirsuta'', which has hollow stems that provide nest sites for the ants; a single ant colony might have more than 3 million workers and 15,000 queens, and may persist for more than 800 years.&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, M. E., Greene, M. J., &amp; [[Deborah Gordon|Gordon, D.]] (2005). Ecology: 'Devil's gardens' bedevilled by ants. ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' 437: 495-6.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the ants fend off [[herbivore]]s, the size of the garden is restricted by leaf destruction increasing as it expands, as the ants are unable to defend the trees beyond a certain point.&lt;ref&gt;Frederickson, M.

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure1.jpg|thumb|280px|Figure 1. A [[riparian forest]] in the [[White Mountains (New Hampshire)|White Mountains]], [[New Hampshire]] (USA).]]

'''Ecosystem ecology''' is the integrated study of living ([[Biotic component|biotic]]) and non-living ([[Abiotic component|abiotic]]) components of [[ecosystem]]s and their interactions within an ecosystem framework. This [[science]] examines how ecosystems work and relates this to their components such as [[chemical]]s, [[bedrock]], [[soil]], [[plant]]s, and [[animal]]s.

Ecosystem ecology examines physical and biological structures and examines how these ecosystem characteristics interact with each other. Ultimately, this helps us understand how to maintain high quality water and economically viable commodity production. A major focus of ecosystem ecology is on functional processes, ecological mechanisms that maintain the structure and services produced by ecosystems. These include [[primary productivity]] (production of [[biomass (ecology)|biomass]]), [[decomposition]], and [[trophic level|trophic]] interactions.

Studies of ecosystem function have greatly improved human understanding of sustainable production of [[Fodder|forage]], [[fiber]], [[fuel]], and provision of [[water]]. Functional processes are mediated by regional-to-local level [[climate]], [[Disturbance (ecology)|disturbance]], and management. Thus ecosystem ecology provides a powerful framework for identifying ecological mechanisms that interact with global environmental problems, especially [[global warming]] and degradation of surface water.

This example demonstrates several important aspects of ecosystems:
# Ecosystem boundaries are often nebulous and may fluctuate in time
# Organisms within ecosystems are dependent on ecosystem level biological and physical processes
# Adjacent ecosystems closely interact and often are interdependent for maintenance of community structure and functional processes that maintain productivity and [[biodiversity]]

These characteristics also introduce practical problems into natural resource management. Who will manage which ecosystem? Will timber cutting in the forest degrade recreational fishing in the stream? These questions are difficult for land managers to address while the boundary between ecosystems remains unclear; even though decisions in one ecosystem will affect the other. We need better understanding of the interactions and interdependencies of these ecosystems and the processes that maintain them before we can begin to address these questions.

Ecosystem ecology is an inherently interdisciplinary field of study. An individual ecosystem is composed of [[populations]] of [[organisms]], interacting within communities, and contributing to the cycling of [[nutrients]] and the flow of [[energy]]. The ecosystem is the principal unit of study in ecosystem ecology.

Population, community, and physiological ecology provide many of the underlying biological mechanisms influencing ecosystems and the processes they maintain. Flowing of energy and cycling of matter at the ecosystem level are often examined in ecosystem ecology, but, as a whole, this science is defined more by subject matter than by scale. Ecosystem ecology approaches organisms and abiotic pools of energy and nutrients as an integrated system which distinguishes it from associated sciences such as [[biogeochemistry]].&lt;ref name= "CH 03"&gt;Chapman, S.K., Hart, S.C., Cobb, N.S., Whitham, T.G., and Koch, G.W.  (2003).  "Insect herbivory increases litter quality and decomposition: an extension of the acceleration hypothesis". in: ''Ecology'' 84:2867-2876.&lt;/ref&gt;

Biogeochemistry and [[hydrology]] focus on several fundamental ecosystem processes such as biologically mediated chemical cycling of nutrients and physical-biological cycling of water. Ecosystem ecology forms the mechanistic basis for regional or global processes encompassed by landscape-to-regional hydrology, global biogeochemistry, and earth system science.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;

== History ==
Ecosystem ecology is philosophically and historically rooted in terrestrial ecology. The ecosystem concept has evolved rapidly during the last 100 years with important ideas developed by [[Frederic Clements]], a botanist who argued for specific definitions of ecosystems and that physiological processes were responsible for their development and persistence.&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, J.B. (1992). ''An Entangled Bank: The origins of ecosystem ecology''. Rutgers University Press, New Brunswick, N.J.&lt;/ref&gt; Although most of Clements ecosystem definitions have been greatly revised, initially by [[Henry Gleason]] and [[Arthur Tansley]], and later by contemporary ecologists, the idea that physiological processes are fundamental to ecosystem structure and function remains central to ecology.

[[Image:Silver Spring Model.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 3. Energy and matter flows through an ecosystem, adapted from the Silver Springs model.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, H.T. (1971). ''Environment, Power, and Society''. Wiley-Interscience New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt; H are herbivores, C are carnivores, TC are top carnivores, and D are decomposers. Squares represent biotic pools and ovals are fluxes or energy or nutrients from the system.]] Later work by [[Eugene Odum]] and [[Howard T. Odum]] quantified flows of energy and matter at the ecosystem level, thus documenting the general ideas proposed by Clements and his contemporary [[Charles Sutherland Elton|Charles Elton]]. See Figure 3.

In this model, energy flows through the whole system were dependent on biotic and abiotic interactions of each individual component ([[species]], inorganic pools of nutrients, etc.). Later work demonstrated that these interactions and flows applied to nutrient cycles, changed over the course of [[ecological succession|succession]], and held powerful controls over ecosystem productivity.&lt;ref&gt;Odum, E.P 1969. "The strategy of ecosystem development". in: ''Science'' 164:262-270.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="L70"&gt;Likens, G. E., F. H. Bormann, N. M. Johnson, D. W. Fisher and R. S. Pierce. (1970). "Effects of forest cutting and herbicide treatment on nutrient budgets in the Hubbard Brook watershed-ecosystem". in: ''Ecological Monographs'' 40:23-47.&lt;/ref&gt; Transfers of energy and nutrients are innate to ecological systems regardless of whether they are aquatic or terrestrial. Thus, ecosystem ecology has emerged from important biological studies of plants, animals, [[Terrestrial ecoregion|terrestrial]], [[aquatic ecosystem|aquatic]], and [[marine (ocean)|marine]] ecosystems.

==Ecosystem services==
Ecosystem services are ecologically mediated functional processes essential to sustaining healthy [[human]] societies.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin, F.S. III, B.H., Walker, R.J., Hobbs, D.U., Hooper, J.H., Lawton, O.E., Sala, and D., Tilman. (1997). "Biotic control over the functioning of ecosystems". in: ''Science'' 277:500-504.&lt;/ref&gt; Water provision and filtration, production of [[Biomass (ecology)|biomass]] in [[forestry]], [[agriculture]], and [[fisheries]], and removal of [[greenhouse gas]]es such as [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the [[atmosphere]] are examples of ecosystem services essential to [[public health]] and economic opportunity. Nutrient cycling is a process fundamental to agricultural and forest production.

However, like most ecosystem processes, nutrient cycling is not an ecosystem characteristic which can be “dialed” to the most desirable level. Maximizing production in degraded systems is an overly simplistic solution to the complex problems of hunger and economic security. For instance, intensive [[fertilizer]] use in the midwestern United States has resulted in degraded fisheries in the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref&gt;Defries, R.S., J.A. Foley, and G.P. Asner. (2004). "Land-use choices: balancing human needs and ecosystem function". in: ''Frontiers in ecology and environmental science''. 2:249-257.&lt;/ref&gt; Regrettably, a “[[Green Revolution]]” of intensive chemical fertilization has been recommended for agriculture in [[developed countries|developed]] and [[developing countries]].&lt;ref&gt;Chrispeels, M.J. and Sadava, D. (1977). ''Plants, food, and people''. W. H. Freeman and Company, San Francisco.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quinones, M.A., N.E. Borlaug, C.R. Dowswell. (1997). "A fertilizer-based green revolution for Africa". In: ''Replenishing soil fertility in Africa''. Soil Science Society of America special publication number 51. Soil Science Society of America, Madison, WI.&lt;/ref&gt; These strategies risk alteration of ecosystem processes that may be difficult to restore, especially when applied at broad scales without adequate assessment of impacts. Ecosystem processes may take many years to recover from significant disturbance.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt;

For instance, large-scale forest clearance in the northeastern United States during the 18th and 19th centuries has altered soil texture, dominant vegetation, and nutrient cycling in ways that impact forest productivity in the present day.&lt;ref&gt;Foster, D. R. (1992). "Land-use history (1730-1990) and vegetation dynamics in central New England, USA". In: ''Journal of Ecology'' 80: 753-772.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Motzkin, G., D. R. Foster, A. Allen, J. Harrod, and R. D. Boone. (1996). "Controlling site to evaluate history: vegetation patterns of a New England sand plain". In: ''Ecological Monographs'' 66: 345-365.&lt;/ref&gt; An appreciation of the importance of ecosystem function in maintenance of productivity, whether in agriculture or forestry, is needed in conjunction with plans for restoration of essential processes. Improved knowledge of ecosystem function will help to achieve long-term sustainability and stability in the poorest parts of the world.

==Operation==
Biomass productivity is one of the most apparent and economically important ecosystem functions. Biomass accumulation begins at the cellular level via photosynthesis. Photosynthesis requires water and consequently global patterns of annual biomass production are correlated with annual precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;Huxman TE, ea.(2004). "Convergence across biomes to a common rain-use efficiency". ''Nature''. 429: 651-654&lt;/ref&gt; Amounts of productivity are also dependent on the overall capacity of plants to capture sunlight which is directly correlated with plant leaf area and N content.

[[Primary production|Net primary productivity]] (NPP) is the primary measure of biomass accumulation within an ecosystem. Net primary productivity can be calculated by a simple formula where the total amount of productivity is adjusted for total productivity losses through maintenance of biological processes:

:NPP = GPP – R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure4.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 4. Seasonal and annual changes in ambient carbon dioxide (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) concentration at Mauna Loa Hawaii (Atmosphere) and above the canopy of a deciduous forest in Massachusetts (Forest). Data show clear seasonal trends associated with periods of high and low NPP and an overall annual increase of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Data approximates of those reported by Keeling and Whorf&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, C.D. and T.P. Whorf. (2005). "Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; records from sites in the SIO air sampling network". In: ''Trends: A Compendium of Data on Global Change''. Carbon Dioxide Information Analysis Center, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, U.S. Department of Energy, Oak Ridge, Tenn., U.S.A.&lt;/ref&gt; and Barford.&lt;ref name = "B01"/&gt;]] Where GPP is gross primary productivity and R&lt;sub&gt;producer&lt;/sub&gt; is photosynthate ([[Carbon]]) lost via [[cellular respiration]].

NPP is difficult to measure but a new technique known as eddy co-variance has shed light on how natural ecosystems influence the atmosphere. Figure 4 shows seasonal and annual changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration measured at [[Mauna Loa]], [[Hawaii]] from 1987 to 1990. CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; concentration steadily increased, but within-year variation has been greater than the annual increase since measurements began in 1957.

These variations were thought to be due to seasonal uptake of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; during summer months.  A newly developed technique for assessing ecosystem NPP has confirmed seasonal variation are driven by seasonal changes in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; uptake by vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Goulden, M. L., J. W. Munger, S.-M. Fan, B. C. Daube, and S. C. Wofsy, (1996). "Effects of interannual climate variability on the carbon dioxide exchange of a temperate deciduous forest". In: ''Science'' 271:1576-1578&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "B01"&gt;Barford, C. C., ea. (2001). "Factors controlling long and short term sequestration of atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in a mid-latitude forest". In: ''Science'' 294: 1688-1691&lt;/ref&gt;  This has led many scientists and policy makers to speculate that ecosystems can be managed to ameliorate problems with [[global warming]]. This type of management may include reforesting or altering forest harvest schedules for many parts of the world.

===Decomposition and nutrient cycling===
[[Decomposition]] and nutrient cycling are fundamental to ecosystem biomass production. Most natural ecosystems are [[nitrogen]] (N) limited and biomass production is closely correlated with N turnover.&lt;ref&gt;Vitousek, P.M. and Howarth, R.W. (1991). "Nitrogen limitation on land and in the sea: how can it occur?" In: ''Biogeochemistry'' 13:87-115.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reich, P.B., Grigal, D.F., Aber, J.D., Gower, S.T. (1997). "Nitrogen mineralization and productivity in 50 hardwood and conifer stands on diverse soils". In: ''Ecology'' 78:335-347.&lt;/ref&gt;
Typically external input of nutrients is very low and efficient recycling of nutrients maintains productivity.&lt;ref name ="L70"/&gt; Decomposition of plant litter accounts for the majority of nutrients recycled through ecosystems (Figure 3). Rates of plant litter decomposition are highly dependent on litter quality; high concentration of phenolic compounds, especially [[lignin]], in plant litter has a retarding effect on litter decomposition.&lt;ref name= "M 82"&gt;Melillo, J.M., Aber, J.D., and Muratore, J.F. (1982).  "Nitrogen and lignin control of hardwood leaf litter decomposition dynamics". In: ''Ecology'' 63:621-626.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hättenschwiler S. and P.M. Vitousek (2000). "The role of polyphenols in terrestrial ecosystem nutrient cycling". In: ''Trends in Ecology and Evolution'' 15: 238-243&lt;/ref&gt; More complex C compounds are decomposed more slowly and may take many years to completely breakdown. Decomposition is typically described with [[exponential decay]] and has been related to the mineral concentrations, especially manganese, in the leaf litter.&lt;ref&gt;Davey MP, B Berg, P Rowland, BA Emmett. 2007. Decomposition of oak leaf litter is related to initial litter Mn concentrations. Canadian Journal of Botany. 85(1). 16-24.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Berg B, Davey MP, Emmett B, Faituri M, Hobbie S, Johansson MB, Liu C, De Marco A, McClaugherty C, Norell L, Rutigliano F, De Santo AV. 2010. Factors influencing limit values for pine needle litter decomposition - a synthesis for boreal and temperate pine forest systems. Biogeochemistry. 100: 57-73&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Ecoecolfigure5.jpg|thumb|240px|Figure 5. Dynamics of decomposing plant litter (A) described with an exponential model (B) and a combined exponential-linear model (C).]]  
Globally, rates of decomposition are mediated by litter quality and climate.&lt;ref&gt;Meentemeyer, V.  1978  "Macroclimate and lignin control of litter decomposition rates". in: ''Ecology'' 59:465-472.&lt;/ref&gt; Ecosystems dominated by plants with low-lignin concentration often have rapid rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling (Chapin et al. 1982). Simple carbon (C) containing compounds are preferentially metabolized by [[decomposer]] microorganisms which results in rapid initial rates of decomposition, see Figure 5A,&lt;ref&gt;Aber, J.D., and J.M., Melillo  (1982). "Nitrogen immobilization in decaying hardwood leaf litter as a function of initial nitrogen and lignin content". In: ''Canadian Journal of Botany'' 60:2263-2269.&lt;/ref&gt; models that depend on constant rates of decay; so called “k” values, see Figure 5B.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, J.S. (1963). "Energy storage and the balance of producers and decomposers in ecological systems". In: ''Ecology'' 44:322-331.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to litter quality and climate, the activity of soil fauna is very important &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Castro-Huerta, R. |author2=Falco, L. |author3=Sandler, R. |author4=Coviella, C. |year=2015 |title=Differential contribution of soil biota groups to plant litter decomposition as mediated by soil use |journal=[[PeerJ]] |volume=3 |pages=e826 |doi=10.7717/peerj.826 |url=https://peerj.com/articles/826/?td=wk }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, these models do not reflect simultaneous linear and non-linear decay processes which likely occur during decomposition. For instance, [[proteins]], [[sugars]] and [[lipids]] decompose exponentially, but lignin decays at a more linear rate&lt;ref name= "M 82"/&gt; Thus, litter decay is inaccurately predicted by simplistic models.&lt;ref&gt;Carpenter, S.A. (1981). "Decay of heterogeneous detritus: a general model". In: ''Journal of theoretical biology''  89:539-547.&lt;/ref&gt;

A simple alternative model presented in Figure 5C shows significantly more rapid decomposition that the standard model of figure 4B. Better understanding of decomposition models is an important research area of ecosystem ecology because this process is closely tied to nutrient supply and the overall capacity of ecosystems to sequester CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; from the atmosphere.

===Trophic dynamics===
Trophic dynamics refers to process of energy and [[nutrient]] transfer between organisms. Trophic dynamics is an important part of the structure and function of ecosystems. Figure 3 shows energy transferred for an ecosystem at Silver Springs, Florida. Energy gained by primary producers (plants, P) is consumed by herbivores (H), which are consumed by carnivores (C), which are themselves consumed by “top- carnivores”(TC).

One of the most obvious patterns in Figure 3 is that as one moves up to higher [[trophic level]]s (i.e. from plants to top-carnivores) the total amount of energy decreases. Plants exert a “bottom-up” control on the energy structure of ecosystems by determining the total amount of energy that enters the system.&lt;ref&gt;Chapin F.S. III, Matson, P.A., and Mooney, H.A. (2003). ''Principles of terrestrial ecosystem ecology''. Springer-Verlag, New York, N.Y.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, predators can also influence the structure of lower trophic levels from the top-down. These influences can dramatically shift dominant species in terrestrial and marine systems&lt;ref&gt;Belovsky, G.E. and J.B. Slade. (2000). "Insect herbivory accelerates nutrient cycling and increases plant production". In: ''Proceedings of the national academy of sciences'' (USA). 97:14412-14417.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"&gt;Frank et al. 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; The interplay and relative strength of top-down vs. bottom-up controls on ecosystem structure and function is an important area of research in the greater field of ecology.

Trophic dynamics can strongly influence rates of decomposition and nutrient cycling in time and in space. For example, herbivory can increase litter decomposition and nutrient cycling via direct changes in litter quality and altered dominant vegetation.&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, M.D. (2001). "Insect population dynamics meets ecosystem ecology: effects of herbivory on soil nutrient dynamics". In: ''Agricultural and Forest Entomology'' 3:77-84.&lt;/ref&gt; Insect herbivory has been shown to increase rates of decomposition and nutrient turnover due to changes in litter quality and increased [[frass]] inputs.&lt;ref name= "CH 03"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Swank, W.T., Waide, J.B., Crossley, D.A., and Todd R.L. (1981). "Insect defoliation enhances nitrate export from forest ecosystems". In: ''Oecologia'' 51:297-299.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
However, insect outbreak does not always increase nutrient cycling. Stadler&lt;ref&gt;Stadler, B., Solinger, St., and Michalzik, B. (2001). "Insect herbivores and the nutrient flow from the canopy to the soil in coniferous and deciduous forests". In: ''[[Oecologia]]'' 126:104-113&lt;/ref&gt; showed that C rich honeydew produced during aphid outbreak can result in increased N immobilization by soil microbes thus slowing down nutrient cycling and potentially limiting biomass production. North atlantic marine ecosystems have been greatly altered by overfishing of cod. Cod stocks crashed in the 1990s which resulted in increases in their prey such as shrimp and snow crab&lt;ref name="Frank et al. 2005"/&gt; Human intervention in ecosystems has resulted in dramatic changes to ecosystem structure and function. These changes are occurring rapidly and have unknown consequences for economic security and human well-being.

==Applications and importance==

===Lessons from two Central American cities===
The biosphere has been greatly altered by the demands of human societies. Ecosystem ecology plays an important role in understanding and adapting to the most pressing current environmental problems. Restoration ecology and ecosystem management are closely associated with ecosystem ecology. Restoring highly degraded resources depends on integration of functional mechanisms of ecosystems.&lt;ref name= "E&amp;T97"&gt;Ehrenfeld, J.G. and Toth, L.A. (1997). "Restoration ecology and the ecosystem perspective". in: ''Restoration Ecology''  5:307-317.&lt;/ref&gt;

Without these functions intact, economic value of ecosystems is greatly reduced and potentially dangerous conditions may develop in the field. For example, areas within the mountainous western highlands of [[Guatemala]] are more susceptible to catastrophic landslides and crippling seasonal water shortages due to loss of forest resources. In contrast, cities such as [[Totonicapán]] that have preserved forests through strong social institutions have greater local economic stability and overall greater human well-being.&lt;ref&gt;Conz, B.W. 2004. Continuity and Contestation: Conservation Landscapes in Totonicapán, Guatemala. University of Massachusetts Masters of Science thesis.&lt;/ref&gt;

This situation is striking considering that these areas are close to each other, the majority of inhabitants are of [[Maya civilization|Mayan]] descent, and the topography and overall resources are similar. This is a case of two groups of people managing resources in fundamentally different ways. Ecosystem ecology provides the basic science needed to avoid degradation and to restore ecosystem processes that provide for basic human needs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20725">The establishment of [[industrial ecology]] as field of scientific research is commonly attributed to an article devoted to industrial ecosystems, written by Frosch and Gallopoulos, which appeared in a 1989 special issue of Scientific American.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Industrial ecology emerged from several earlier ideas and concepts, some of which date back to the 19th century.

== Before the 1960s ==

The term "[[Industrial Ecology|industrial ecology]]" has been used alongside "[[Industrial Symbiosis|industrial symbiosis]]" at least since the 1940s. [[Economic geography]] was perhaps one of the first fields to use these terms. For example, in an article published in 1947, George T. Renner refers to "The General Principle of Industrial Location" as a "Law of Industrial Ecology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Renner | first1 = G.T. | year = 1947 | title = Geography of Industrial Localization | url = | journal = Economic Geography | volume = 23 | issue = 3| pages = 167–189 | doi=10.2307/141510 | jstor = 141510 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Briefly stated this is:

{{quote|Any industry tends to locate at a point which provides optimum access to its ingredients or component elements. If all these component elements be juxtaposed, the location of the industry is predetermined. If, however, they occur widely separated, the industry is so located as to be most accessible to that element which would be the most expensive or difficult to transport and which, therefore, becomes the locative factor for the industry in question.}}

In the same article the author defines and describes industrial symbiosis:

{{quote|Often the location of an industry cannot be fully understood solely in terms of its locative ingredient elements. There are relationships between industries, sometimes simple, but often quite complex, which enter into and complicate the analysis. Chief among these is the phenomenon of [[industrial symbiosis]]. By this is meant the consorting together of two or more of dissimilar industries. Industrial Symbiosis, when scrutinized, is seen to be of two kinds, disjunctive and conjunctive.}}

It appears that the concept of Industrial Symbiosis was not new for the field of economic geography, since the same categorization is used by Walter G. Lezius in his 1937 article "Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio", also published in the Journal of Economic Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lezius | first1 = Walter G | year = 1937 | title = Geography of Glass Manufacture at Toledo, Ohio | jstor = 141587| journal = Economic Geography | volume = 13 | issue = 4| pages = 402–412 | doi=10.2307/141587}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Used in a different context, the term "Industrial Ecology" is also found in a 1958 paper concerned with the relationship between the ecological impact from increasing urbanization and value orientations of related peoples. The case study is in Lebanon:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Armstrong | first1 = L. | last2 = Bashshur | first2 = R. | year = 1958 | title = Ecological Patterns and Value Orientations in Lebanon | journal = Public Opinion Quarterly | volume = 22 | issue = 3| pages = 406–415 | jstor=2746350 | doi = 10.1086/266808 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The central ecological variable in the present research is ecological mobility, or the movement of men in space. It is patent that modern Industrial Ecology requires more such adaptive mobility than does traditional folk-village organization.}}

== 1960s ==

In 1963, we find the term Industrial Ecology (defined as the "complex ecology of the modern industrial world") being used to describe the social nature and complexity of (and within) industrial systems:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Barnard | first1 = F | year = 1963 | title = Education for management conceived as a study of Industrial Ecology | journal = Journal of Vocational Education &amp; Training | volume = 15 | issue = 30| pages = 22–26 | doi=10.1080/03057876380000041}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|...industrial organisations are social rather than mechanical systems. A firm is not only a working organisation with a working purpose. It is rather a community with its own 'politics', in so far as it is involved in problems concerned with the proper distribution of power between individuals and groups of individuals and with questions of individual and group prestige, influence, status and standing... [and he concludes that] the understanding which the student of management is expected to gain is no less than the attainment of insight into an [[Industrial Ecology]] of great complexity.}}

In 1967, the President of the American association for the advancement of science writes in "The experimental city"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Spilhaus |first1=Athelstan |year=1967 |title=The experimental city |journal=Daedalus |volume=96 |issue=4 |pages=1129–41 |jstor=20027108 }}&lt;/ref&gt; that "There are examples of [[industrial symbiosis]] where one industry feeds off, or at least neutralizes, the wastes of another..." The same author in 1970 talks about "The Next Industrial Revolution"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.167.3926.1673 |pmid=17729610 |title=The Next Industrial Revolution |journal=Science |volume=167 |issue=3926 |pages=1673 |year=1970 |last1=Spilhaus |first1=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of material and energy sharing and reuse is central to his proposal for a new industrial revolution and he cites agro-[[industrial symbiosis]] as a practical way for achieving this:

{{quote|The object of the next industrial revolution is to ensure that there will be no such thing as waste, on the basis that waste is simply some substance that we do not vet have the wit to use... The next industrial revolution is this generating of a huge new [industry that]... will not produce products, it will rather reprocess the things we call wastes so they may be reproduced in the factories into the things we need... Having the city near the rural area will enable waste heat to be used to speed up the biological processes of treating the organic wastes before they go back into the land. This might end in an elegant arrangement-the power plants located close enough to the center of use, to the people who need the power, but also, within the economics, close enough to the agriculture lands so that the waste heat may be used there. This is an example of agro-industrial symbiosis, if you like to call it that.}}

In these early articles, "Industrial Ecology" is used in its literal sense - as a system of interacting industrial entities. The relation to natural ecosystems (through either metaphor or analogy) is not explicit. Industrial Symbiosis on the other hand, is already clearly defined as a type of industrial organization, and the term symbiosis is borrowed from the ecological sciences to describe an analogous phenomenon in industrial systems.

== 1970s ==

Industrial Ecology has been a research subject of the Japan Industrial Policy Research Institute since 1971. Their definition of Industrial Ecology is "research for the prospect of dynamic harmonization between human activities and nature by a systems approach based upon ecology (JIPRI, 1983)".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; This programme has resulted to a number of reports that are available only in Japanese.

One of the earliest definitions of  Industrial Ecology was proposed by Harry Zvi Evan at a seminar of the Economic Commission of Europe in Warsaw (Poland) in 1973 (an article was subsequently published by Evan in the Journal for International Labour Review in 1974 vol. 110 (3), pp.&amp;nbsp;219–233). Evan defined Industrial Ecology as a systematic analysis of industrial operations including factors like: Technology, environment, natural resources, bio-medical aspects, institutional and legal matters as well as the socio-economic aspects.

In 1974 the term of Industrial Ecology is perhaps for the first time associated with a cyclical production mode (rather than a linear one, resulting to waste). In this article, the necessity for a transition to an "open-world Industrial Ecology", is used as argument for the need to establish lunar industries:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ehricke | first1 = K.A. | year = 1974 | title = Lunar industries and their value for the human environment on Earth | journal = Acta Astronautica | volume = 1 | issue = 5–6| pages = 585–622 | doi=10.1016/0094-5765(74)90023-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Low living standards provide one strong motive for most developing countries to increase their productivity and grow economically. Population increase (while it lasts) is a still more powerful driver for increased world consumption. Thus the pressure on resources will continue to grow. Instead of deploring it, we better grow with it. Only through transition to an open-world [[Industrial Ecology]] - which includes both benign industrial revolution on Earth and extraterrestrial industrialization - can the present apparent limits to growth be overcome.}}

Many elements of modern Industrial Ecology were commonplace in the industrial sectors of the former Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sathre | first1 = R. | last2 = Grdzelishvili | first2 = I. | year = 2006 | title = Industrial symbiosis in the former Soviet Union | url = | journal = Progress in Industrial Ecology | volume = 3 | issue = 4| pages = 379–392 | doi=10.1504/pie.2006.011743}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, “kombinirovanaia produksia” (combined production) was present from the earliest years of the Soviet Union and was instrumental in shaping the patterns of Soviet industrialization. “Bezotkhodnoyi tekhnologii” (waste-free technology) was introduced in the final decades of the USSR as a way to increase industrial production while limiting environmental impact. Fiodor Davitaya, a Soviet scientist from the [[Georgian Soviet Socialist Republic|Republic of Georgia]], described in 1977 the analogy relating industrial systems to natural systems as a model for a desirable transition to cleaner production:

{{quote|Nature operates without any waste products. What is rejected by some organisms provides food for others. The organisation of industry on this principle—with the waste products of some branches of industry providing raw material for others—means in effect using natural processes as a model, for in them the resolution of all arising contradictions is the motive force of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Davitaya, F. (1977) "Changes in the atmosphere and some problems of its protection" pp. 99–110 in ''Society and the Environment: A Soviet View''; Moscow: Progress Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== 1980s ==

By the 80s Industrial Ecology was already "promoted" to a research subject, which several institutes around the globe embraced. In a 1986 article published in the Journal of Ecological Modeling, there is a full description of Industrial Ecology and the [[analogy]] to natural [[ecosystems]] is clearly stated:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ogawa | first1 = H. | last2 = Sato | first2 = K. | last3 = Jo | first3 = N. | last4 = Noro | first4 = K. | last5 = Tsuchiya | first5 = K. | year = 1986 | title = Modelling of industrial ecological systems for evaluation of health services | journal = Ecological Modelling | volume = 31 | issue = 1–4| pages = 329–339 | doi=10.1016/0304-3800(86)90073-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The structure and inner-working of an industrial society resemble those of a natural ecosystem. The concepts in ecology such as habitat, succession, trophic level, limiting factors and community metabolism can also apply to the study of the ecology of an industrial society. For instance, an industry in a society may grow or decline as a consequence of dynamic changes in exogenous limiting resources and in the hierarchical and/or metabolic structure of that society. When studying the ecology of an industrial society (henceforth termed '[[Industrial Ecology]]'), these concepts and methodologies employed in ecosystems analyses are useful.}}

In fact, in the above article there is an attempt to model an "industrial ecological system". The model is composed of seven major sections: industry, population, labor force, living state, environment and pollution, general health, and occupational health. Notice the rough similarity with Evan's factors as stated in the above section.

During the 80s the emergence of another related term, "[[industrial metabolism]]", is observed. The term is used as a metaphor for the organization and functioning of industrial activity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hicks | first1 =  | year = 1983 | title = The Property Tax in a New Industrial Era | jstor = 3700958| journal = Proceedings of the Academy of Political Science | volume = 35 | issue = 1| pages =  208–221| doi=10.2307/3700958}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an article defending the "biological modulation of terrestrial carbon cycle", the author includes an extraordinary parenthetical note:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Schidlowski | first1 = M | year = 1984 | title = Biological modulation of the terrestrial carbon cycle: isotope clues to early organic evolution | url = | journal = Advances in Space Research | volume = 4 | issue = 12| pages = 183–93 | pmid = 11537773 | doi=10.1016/0273-1177(84)90561-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Parenthetically, it should be noted that it is an intrinsic property of life to proliferate exponentially until the encounter of limits set by (I) the availability of biologically utilizable reducing power, or (2) the exhaustion of some critical nutrient, or (3) an autotoxic effect imposed by life on its own environment. These limits are universal, applying to microbial ecosystems as well as to the population dynamics of a seemingly unrestricted biological superdominant such as Homo Sapiens (here, the ultimate limit is likely to be placed by an autotoxic effect exerted by the "extrasomatic" (industrial) metabolism of the human race).}}

=== 1989 – Decisive articles ===

In 1989 two articles were released that played a decisive role in the history of industrial ecology. The first one was titled "Industrial Metabolism" by Robert Ayres. Ayres essentially lays the foundations of Industrial Ecology, although the term is not to be found in this article. In the appendix of the article he includes "a theoretical exploration of the biosphere and the industrial economy as material-transformation systems and lessons that might be learned from their comparison". He proposes that:&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, R.U. 1989. Industrial Metabolism. In Technology and Environment,J.H. Ausubel and H.E. Sladovich, 23–49. 1st. Washington DC: National Academy Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|We may think of both the biosphere and the industrial economy as systems for the transformation of materials. The biosphere as it now exists is nearly a perfect system for recycling materials. This was not the case when life on earth began. The industrial system of today resembles the earliest stage of biological evolution, when the most primitive living organisms obtained their energy from a stock of organic molecules accumulated during prebiotic times. It is increasingly urgent for us to learn from the biosphere and modify our industrial metabolism, the energy - and value - yielding process essential to economic development... we should not only postulate, but indeed endorse, a long-run imperative favoring an industrial metabolism that results in reduced extraction of virgin materials, reduced loss of waste materials, and increased recycling of useful ones.}}

The term "Industrial Ecology" gains mainstream attention later the same year (1989) through a "[[Scientific American]]" article named "Strategies for Manufacturing". In this article, R.Frosch and N.Gallopoulos wonder "why would not our industrial system behave like an [[ecosystem]], where the wastes of a species may be [[natural resource|resource]] to another species? Why would not the outputs of an industry be the inputs of another, thus reducing use of raw materials, pollution, and saving on [[waste]] treatment?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Frosch | first1 = R.A. | last2 = Gallopoulos | first2 = N.E. | year = 1989 | title = Strategies for Manufacturing | url = | journal = Scientific American | volume = 261 | issue = 3| pages = 144–152 | doi=10.1038/scientificamerican0989-144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This vision gave birth to the concept of the Eco-industrial Park, the industrial complex that is governed by Industrial Ecology principles. A notable example resides in a Danish industrial park in the city of [[Kalundborg]]. There, several linkages of byproducts and waste heat can be found between numerous entities such as a large power plant, an oil refinery, a pharmaceutical plant, a plasterboard factory, an enzyme manufacturer, a waste company and the city itself.&lt;ref&gt;The Kalundborg Centre for [[industrial symbiosis]] (2007) http://www.symbiosis.dk/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Frosch|Frosch's]] and Gallopoulos' thinking was in certain ways simply an extension of earlier ideas, such as the efficiency and waste-reduction thinking annunciated by [[Buckminster Fuller]] and his students (e.g., [[J. Baldwin]]), and parallel ideas about energy [[cogeneration]], such as those of [[Amory Lovins]] and the [[Rocky Mountain Institute]].

== 1990s ==

In 1991, C. Kumar Patel organized a seminal colloquium on Industrial Ecology, held on May 20 and 21, 1991, at the National Academy of Sciences in Washington D.C. The papers were later published in the [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences]] USA, and they form an excellent reference on Industrial Ecology. Papers include:

The ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' (since 1997), the International Society for Industrial Ecology (since 2001), and the journal ''Progress in Industrial Ecology'' (since 2004) have covered [[industrial ecology]] in the international scientific community. Principles of industrial ecology are also emerging in various policy realms such as the concept of the circular economy that is being promoted in China. Although the definition of the circular economy has yet to be formalized, generally the focus is on strategies such as creating a circular flow of materials, and cascading energy flows. An example of this would be using [[waste heat]] from one process to run another process that requires a lower temperature. This maximizes the efficiency of [[exergy]] use. This strategy aims for a more efficient economy with fewer pollutants and other unwanted by-products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Yuan | first1 = Z | last2 = Bi | first2 = J | last3 = Moriguichi | first3 = Y | year = 2008| title = The Circular Economy: A New Development Strategy in China | url = | journal = Journal of Industrial Ecology | volume = 10 | issue = 1–2| pages = 4–8 | doi=10.1162/108819806775545321}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ideasthesia''' (alternative spelling '''ideaesthesia''') is defined as a phenomenon in which activations of concepts (inducers) evoke perception-like experiences (concurrents). The name comes [[Ancient Greek]] ''ἰδέα'' (idéa) and ''αἴσθησις'' (aísthēsis), meaning "sensing concepts" or "sensing ideas".&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2009) Is synaesthesia actually ideaesthesia? An inquiry into the nature of the phenomenon. Proceedings of the Third International Congress on Synaesthesia, Science &amp; Art, Granada, Spain, April 26–29, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The main reason for introducing the notion of ideasthesia was the problems with [[synesthesia]]. While "synesthesia" means "union of senses", [[empirical evidence]] indicated that this was an incorrect explanation of a set of phenomena traditionally covered by this heading. ''Syn-aesthesis'' denoting also "co-perceiving", implies the association of two sensory elements with little connection to the cognitive level. However, according to others,&lt;ref name = "Dixon et al 2006"&gt;Dixon, M.J., Smilek, D., Duffy, P.L., Zanna, P. M., Merikle, P. M. (2006) The Role of Meaning in Grapheme-Colour Synaesthesia, ''Cortex'' 42: 243-252.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Mroczko et al 2009"&gt;Mroczko A., T. Metzinger, W. Singer, D.

Consciousness and Cognition, 61, 94-106.&lt;/ref&gt; most phenomena that have inadvertently been linked to synesthesia in fact are induced by the [[Semantics|semantic]] representations. That is, the [[Meaning (linguistics)|meaning]] of the stimulus is what is important rather than its sensory properties, as would be implied by the term synesthesia. In other words, while synesthesia presumes that both the trigger (inducer) and the resulting experience (concurrent) are of sensory nature, ideasthesia presumes that only the resulting experience is of sensory nature while the trigger is semantic. Meanwhile, the concept of ideasthesia developed into a theory of how we perceive and the research has extended to topics other than synesthesia &amp;mdash; as the concept of ideasthesia turned out applicable to our everyday [[perception]]. Ideasthesia has been even applied to the theory of art. Research on ideasthesia bears important implications for solving the mystery of human conscious [[qualia|experience]], which according to ideasthesia, is grounded in how we activate [[concepts]].&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, A., Nikolić D. (2014) Semantic mechanisms may be responsible for developing synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Human Neuroscience'' 8:509. doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00509&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples and evidence==
[[File:Synesthesia 5.jpg|thumb|left|An illustration drawn by a synesthete showing her [[Number form|time unit - space synesthesia]]/ideasthesia: the months in a year are organized into a circle surrounding her body, each month having a fixed location in space and a unique color.]] A common example of synesthesia is the association between [[grapheme]]s and colors, usually referred to as [[grapheme-color synesthesia]]. Here, letters of the alphabet are associated with vivid experiences of color. Studies have indicated that the perceived color is context-dependent and is determined by the extracted meaning of a stimulus. For example, an ambiguous stimulus '5' that can be interpreted either as 'S' or '5' will have the color associated with 'S' or with '5', depending on the context in which it is presented. If presented among numbers, it will be interpreted as '5' and will associate the respective color. If presented among letters, it will be interpreted as 'S' and will associate the respective synesthetic color.&lt;ref name = "Dixon et al 2006"/&gt;

Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes also from the finding that colors can be flexibly associated to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with [[Glagolitic alphabet|Glagolitic]] letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited the colors of the corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.&lt;ref name = "Mroczko et al 2009"/&gt;

In another study, synesthetes were prompted to form novel synesthetic associations to graphemes never seen before. Synesthetes created those associations within minutes or seconds - which was time too short to account for creation of new physical connections between color representation and grapheme representation areas in the brain,&lt;ref&gt;Jürgens U.M., Nikolić D. (2012) Ideaesthesia: Conceptual processes assign similar colours to similar shapes. ''Translational Neuroscience'', 3(1): 22-27.&lt;/ref&gt; pointing again towards ideasthesia.

For [[lexical-gustatory synesthesia]] evidence also points towards ideasthesia: In lexical-gustatory synesthesia, verbalisation of the stimulus is not necessary for the experience of concurrents. Instead, it is sufficient to activate the concept.&lt;ref name = "Simner Ward 2006"/&gt;

Another case of synesthesia is swimming-style synesthesia in which each swimming style is associated with a vivid experience of a color.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic et al 2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mroczko-Wąsowicz, Aleksandra, and Markus Werning. Synesthesia, sensory-motor contingency, and semantic emulation: how swimming style-color synesthesia challenges the traditional view of synesthesia. ''Frontiers in Psychology'' 3 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt; These synesthetes do not need to perform the actual movements of a corresponding swimming style. To activate the concurrent experiences, it is sufficient to activate the concept of a swimming style (e.g., by presenting a photograph of a swimmer or simply talking about swimming).&lt;ref&gt;Jarrett, C. (2014). Great myths of the brain. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that grapheme-color synesthesia for [[Gemination|geminate consonants]] also provides evidence for ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Weaver, D.F., Hawco C.L.A. (2015) Geminate consonant grapheme-colour synaesthesia (ideaesthesia). ''BMC Neurology'', 15:112.&lt;/ref&gt;

In pitch-color synesthesia, the same tone will be associated with different colors depending on how it has been named; do-sharp (i.e. di) will have colors similar to do (e.g., a reddish  color) and re-flat (i.e. ra) will have color similar to that of re (e.g., yellowish), although the two classes refer to one the same tone.&lt;ref&gt;Itoh, K., Sakata, H., Kwee, I. L., &amp; Nakada, T. (2017). Musical pitch classes have rainbow hues in pitch class-color synesthesia. Scientific reports, 7(1), 17781.&lt;/ref&gt;

''One-shot synesthesia'': There are synesthetic experiences that can occur just once in lifetime, and are dubbed one-shot synesthesia. Investigation of such cases has indicated that such unique experiences typically occur when a synesthete is involved in an intensive mental and emotional activity such as making important plans for future or reflecting on their life. It has been thus concluded that this is also a form of ideasthesia.&lt;ref&gt;Kirschner, A., &amp; Nikolić, D. (2017). One-shot synesthesia. Translational Neuroscience, 8(1), 167-175.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In normal perception==
[[Image:Booba-Kiki.svg|thumb|right|Which one would be called Bouba and which Kiki? Responses are highly consistent among people. This is an example of ideasthesia as the conceptualization of the stimulus plays an important role.]]Recently, it has been suggested that the [[Bouba/kiki effect|Bouba/Kiki]] phenomenon is a case of ideasthesia.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013&gt;Gómez Milán, E., Iborra, O., de Córdoba, M.J., Juárez-Ramos V., Rodríguez Artacho, M.A., Rubio, J.L. (2013) The Kiki-Bouba effect: A case of personification and ideaesthesia. ''The Journal of Consciousness Studies.''  20(1-2): pp. 84-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shukla, A. (2016). The Kiki-Bouba paradigm: Where senses meet and greet. Indian Journal of Mental Health, 3(3), 240-252.&lt;/ref&gt; Most people will agree that the star-shaped object on the left is named Kiki and the round one on the right Bouba.&lt;ref name = Kohler1929&gt;{{cite book | author = Köhler, W | year = 1929 | title = Gestalt Psychology. | location = New York | publisher = Liveright}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "Rama2001"&gt;Ramachandran, VS &amp; Hubbard, EM (2001) Synaesthesia: A window into perception, thought and language. ''Journal of Consciousness Studies'' 8(12): 3–34.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been assumed that these associations come from direct connections between visual and auditory cortices.&lt;ref name = "Rama2001" /&gt; For example, according to that hypothesis, representations of sharp inflections in the star-shaped object would be physically connected to the representations of sharp inflection in the sound of Kiki. However, Gomez et al.&lt;ref name = Gomez2013 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Milán, Emilio Gómez, Oscar Iborra Martínez, and María José de Córdoba Serrano. El Universo Kiki-Bouba: Ideaestesia, Empatía y Neuromárketing. Fundación Internacional artecittà, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that Kiki/Bouba associations are much richer as either word and either image is associated semantically to a number of concepts such as white or black color, feminine vs. masculine, cold vs. hot, and others. These sound-shape associations seem to be related through a large overlap between semantic networks of Kiki and star-shape on one hand, and Bouba and round-shape on the other hand. For example, both Kiki and star-shape are clever, small, thin and nervous. This indicates that behind Kiki-Bouba effect lies a rich semantic network. In other words, our sensory experience is largely determined by the meaning that we assign to stimuli. Food description and wine tasting is another domain in which ideasthetic association between flavor and other modalities such as shape may play an important role.&lt;ref&gt;Spence, Charles, and Ophelia Deroy. On the shapes of flavours: A review of four hypotheses. ''Theoria et Historia Scientiarum'' 10 (2014): 207-238.&lt;/ref&gt; These semantic-like relations play a role in successful marketing; the name of a product should match its other characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;Bridger, D. (2015). Decoding the irrational consumer: How to commission, run and generate insights from neuromarketing research. Kogan Page Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for development of synesthesia==
The concept of ideasthesia bears implications for understanding [[Developmental psychology|how synesthesia develops]] in children. Synesthetic children may associate concrete sensory-like experiences primarily to the abstract concepts that they have otherwise difficulties dealing with.&lt;ref name="MroczkoNikolic2014"/&gt; Synesthesia may thus be used as a cognitive tool to cope with the abstractness of the learning materials imposed by the educational system &amp;mdash; referred to also as a "semantic vacuum hypothesis". This hypothesis explains why the most common inducers in synesthesia are graphemes and time units &amp;mdash; both relating to the first truly abstract ideas that a child needs to master.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, B., &amp; Caramazza, A. (1997). From graphemes to abstract letter shapes: levels of representation in written spelling. Journal of experimental psychology: human perception and performance, 23(4), 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for art theory==
The concept of ideasthesia has been often discussed in relation to art,&lt;ref&gt;Gsöllpointner, Katharina. "DIE KUNST DER SINNE–DIE SINNE DER KUNST." Exploring Cybernetics: Kybernetik im interdisziplinären Diskurs (2015): 137-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albertazzi, Liliana, et al. "The hue of angles—was Kandinsky right?." Art &amp; Perception 3.1 (2015): 81-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mărginaş, Raluca. "The Spurious Case of Synesthesia in the Popular Arts." Ekphrasis 1 (2012): 144-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. (2017). Hendrick ter Brugghen's Musicians and the Engagement of the Viewer. Temple University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast, J. (2018). Grinding the moor–ideasthesia and narrative. New Writing, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and also used to formulate a psychological theory of art.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"&gt;Nikolić D. (2016) Ideasthesia and art. In: Gsöllpointner, Katharina, et al. (eds.). 2016. Digital Synesthesia. A Model for the Aesthetics of Digital Art. Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter (http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/print/11666)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, we consider something to be a piece of art when experiences induced by the piece are accurately balanced with semantics induced by the same piece. Thus, a piece of art makes us both strongly think and strongly experience. Moreover, the two must be perfectly balanced such that the most salient stimulus or event is both the one that evokes strongest experiences (fear, joy, ... ) and strongest cognition (recall, memory, ...) &amp;mdash; in other words, ''idea'' is well balanced with ''aesthesia''.

Ideasthesia theory of art may be used for psychological studies of [[aesthetics]]. It may also help explain [[classificatory disputes about art]] as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"/&gt; There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.

==Neurophysiology of ideasthesia==
Ideasthesia is congruent with the theory of brain functioning known as [[practopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;van Leeuwen, T. M., Singer, W., &amp; Nikolić, D. (2015). The merit of synesthesia for consciousness research. Frontiers in psychology, 6, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to that theory, concepts are not an emergent property of highly developed, specialized neuronal networks in the brain, as is usually assumed; rather, concepts are proposed to be fundamental to the very adaptive principles by which living systems and the brain operate.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2015). Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 373, 40-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

This hypothesis explains why the most common inducers in synesthesia are graphemes and time units &amp;mdash; both relating to the first truly abstract ideas that a child needs to master.&lt;ref&gt;Rapp, B., &amp; Caramazza, A. (1997). From graphemes to abstract letter shapes: levels of representation in written spelling. Journal of experimental psychology: human perception and performance, 23(4), 1130.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Implications for art theory==
The concept of ideasthesia has been often discussed in relation to art,&lt;ref&gt;Gsöllpointner, Katharina. "DIE KUNST DER SINNE–DIE SINNE DER KUNST." Exploring Cybernetics: Kybernetik im interdisziplinären Diskurs (2015): 137-165.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Albertazzi, Liliana, et al. "The hue of angles—was Kandinsky right?." Art &amp; Perception 3.1 (2015): 81-92.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mărginaş, Raluca. "The Spurious Case of Synesthesia in the Popular Arts." Ekphrasis 1 (2012): 144-151.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, A. (2017). Hendrick ter Brugghen's Musicians and the Engagement of the Viewer. Temple University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Prendergast, J. (2018). Grinding the moor–ideasthesia and narrative. New Writing, 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt; and also used to formulate a psychological theory of art.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"&gt;Nikolić D. (2016) Ideasthesia and art. In: Gsöllpointner, Katharina, et al. (eds.). 2016. Digital Synesthesia. A Model for the Aesthetics of Digital Art. Berlin/Boston: De Gruyter (http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/print/11666)&lt;/ref&gt; According to the theory, we consider something to be a piece of art when experiences induced by the piece are accurately balanced with semantics induced by the same piece. Thus, a piece of art makes us both strongly think and strongly experience. Moreover, the two must be perfectly balanced such that the most salient stimulus or event is both the one that evokes strongest experiences (fear, joy, ... ) and strongest cognition (recall, memory, ...) &amp;mdash; in other words, ''idea'' is well balanced with ''aesthesia''.

Ideasthesia theory of art may be used for psychological studies of [[aesthetics]]. It may also help explain [[classificatory disputes about art]] as its main tenet is that experience of art can only be individual, depending on person's unique knowledge, experiences and history.&lt;ref name = "Nikolic Art"/&gt; There could exist no general classification of art satisfactorily applicable to each and all individuals.

==Neurophysiology of ideasthesia==
Ideasthesia is congruent with the theory of brain functioning known as [[practopoiesis]]&lt;ref&gt;van Leeuwen, T. M., Singer, W., &amp; Nikolić, D. (2015). The merit of synesthesia for consciousness research. Frontiers in psychology, 6, 1850.&lt;/ref&gt;. According to that theory, concepts are not an emergent property of highly developed, specialized neuronal networks in the brain, as is usually assumed; rather, concepts are proposed to be fundamental to the very adaptive principles by which living systems and the brain operate.&lt;ref&gt;Nikolić, D. (2015). Practopoiesis: Or how life fosters a mind. Journal of Theoretical Biology, 373, 40-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{nihongo|'''International Christian University''' |国際基督教大学|Kokusai Kirisutokyō Daigaku|'''ICU'''}} is a non-denominational [[private university]] located in [[Mitaka, Tokyo]], [[Japan]]. Commonly known as '''ICU''' (in Japan and abroad), the university was founded in 1949. ICU offers 31 undergraduate majors and a [[Graduate school]].

The university is considered to be the most prestigious [[Liberal arts college|Liberal Arts College]] in Japan and it has several partner institutions worldwide including [[University of California|The University of California system]], [[University of Pennsylvania]], [[Duke University]], [[Yonsei University]], [[University College London]] and more.

ICU is unique for being a fully bilingual campus. Classes are held in either English or Japanese, with all faculty required to have strong command in both languages. 
&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/campuslife/club/bilingual.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Notable alumni include: [[Princess Mako of Akishino]], [[Princess Kako of Akishino]], President and CEO of [[Sony]], [[Kaz Hirai]], and U.S. Senator, [[Jay Rockefeller]]. In 2014, the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] selected ICU as one of the 37 schools for [[Top Global University Project|The Top Global University Project]]. It is consistently ranked as one of the top and most selective universities in Japan.

===History===
[[File:International Christian University in 1950s.JPG|thumb|International Christian University in 1950s. The main building was used by Mitaka Institute of the [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ne.jp/asahi/airplane/museum/nakajima/nakajima2.html|title=中島飛行機株式会社その軌跡|accessdate=May 24, 2010|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

ICU was founded in 1949. With an emphasis on reconciliation and peace, ICU was envisaged as a “University of Tomorrow,” a place where [[Japanese people|Japanese]] and international students would live together and learn to serve the needs of an emerging, more interconnected world. When students enter ICU they sign the [[United Nations Universal Declaration of Human Rights]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/en/about/pledge.html|title=Student Pledge - ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and they are challenged to commit themselves to help bring about social justice and world peace. Due to this commitment to human rights, [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] delivered ICU's first convocation address.

According to JICUF (Japan ICU Foundation), 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Concerted fundraising campaigns were initiated in both [[Japan]] and in [[North America]]. [[Hisato Ichimada]], the Governor of the [[Bank of Japan]] who was [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]], headed the Japan campaign that raised the funds necessary to purchase a large tract of land for the university. The Honorary Chair of the US fundraising campaign was General [[Douglas MacArthur]], and the North American public responded with generous contributions as well."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jicuf.org/history History - Japan ICU Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The third son of the [[Emperor Taishō]], a younger brother of the [[Hirohito|Emperor Shōwa]] and an uncle of the [[Emperor of Japan|Emperor]] [[Akihito]] [[Nobuhito, Prince Takamatsu]] officiated the Honorary President of the Preparatory Committee for founding ICU.

==Campus==
ICU's main campus of 150 wooded acres is located in west Tokyo, with downtown areas like Shinjuku about half an hour's train ride away. Computer and internet access is available throughout the campus.
[[File:Entrance to ICU in spring.jpg|thumb|The entrance to ICU leading up to the university chapel. The road has rows of cherry blossom trees on both side which bloom in spring, signifying the start of a new school year.]]

The campus sits on ancient pre-[[Jomon]] and Jomon archaeological remains, which gives students the opportunity to participate in archaeological fieldwork. Excavated items found on the campus are on permanent display in the [[Hachiro Yuasa Memorial Museum]]. In addition, the campus is directly on the former location of a [[Nakajima Aircraft Company]] factory.

In a quiet wooded area of the campus and through a large thatched gate is the Taizanso Garden. Built in the 1920s, the garden includes a traditional Japanese [[tea house]] and the historically significant One-Mat Room constructed out of wood gathered from sacred and historic sites throughout Japan.

ICU owns a {{convert|240|acre|km2|adj=on}} campus in Nasu and a {{convert|13|acre|m2|adj=on}} retreat center in [[Karuizawa, Nagano|Karuizawa]], [[Kitasaku District, Nagano|Kitasaku District]], [[Nagano Prefecture]].

ICU houses one of the Rotary Centers for [[International studies|International Studies]] in [[Peace and conflict studies|peace and conflict resolution]], partnering with [[Rotary International]]. The [[University of California]] Tokyo Study Center which hosts the UCEAP program to Japan is also located on ICU campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.uctsc.org/index.html|title=University of California Tokyo Study Center, EAP, Japan Program, Sign Out, UC Center, カリフォルニア大学東京スタディセンター|website=www.uctsc.org|access-date=2018-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academics==

ICU offers [[bachelor's degree]]s in [[Bachelor of Liberal Arts|liberal arts]] fields, as well as [[master's degree|master's]] and [[doctorate|doctoral]] [[academic degree|degree]]s in [[education]], [[public administration]], comparative culture and [[natural science]]s. About 18% of the faculty come from overseas (primarily [[English-speaking world|English-speaking countries]]). There is a strong English language program (ELP), taught by tenured and contract faculty English teachers, which was embroiled in a contentious curricular reform in 2010&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://web.icu.ac.jp/lrb/docs/HaleLRB25.pdf |format=PDF |last=Hale |first=C. |year=2010 |title= Change, Conflict and Conant: ELP Reform and ICU's Liberal Arts Heritage. Language research bulletin. 25 |location=Tokyo |publisher=International Christian University}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to the name being changed to the ELA (English for Liberal Arts program) in April 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/english/liberalarts/collegewide/elp/index.html|title=HTTP 404 error｜国際基督教大学|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Academics who aspire to teach at ICU are required to submit a reference who can testify to their commitment to Christianity, despite the university' stance that increasing adherents to the Christian faith is not its primary goal.[http://www.icu.ac.jp/en/about/commitment.html]

=== Undergraduate Programs ===

Students choose one or two majors as single major, double major or major/minor. 31 majors are being offered as of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/english/liberalarts/major/index.html|title=HTTP 404 error｜国際基督教大学|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bilingual Academics ===
The languages of instruction at ICU are Japanese and English. Around 30% of all courses are offered in English, the rest in Japanese or in both languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/admissions/september/faq/index.html#g5|title=FAQ {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prospective students without prior Japanese language knowledge are able to apply under a documentary screening process, instead of undergoing the entrance exams held in Japanese. These students are required to have college level English proficiency and subsequently take ICU Japanese Language Programs (JLP) courses to gain [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] and eventually take courses taught in Japanese.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/admissions/september/faq/index.html#g2|title=FAQ {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the policy of [[Multilingualism|bilingualism]] of ICU curriculum, students take language courses for their non-dominant language in their freshman and sophomore year (Depending on the student's language requirements, English for Liberal Arts or Japanese Language Programs).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/liberalarts/policy/index.html|title=Policies {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Each campus department staffs employees with strong command in both languages. Student resources, ICU websites, and campus bulletin boards are in both Japanese and English to accommodate students from any language background.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/campuslife/club/bilingual.html|title=A Fully Bilingual Campus Organizational Structure {{!}} ICU - INTERNATIONAL CHRISTIAN UNIVERSITY|website=www.icu.ac.jp|access-date=2018-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trimester System ===
The academic year is divided into trimesters of approximately eleven weeks each with each course lasting one trimester term. This allows for a dynamic learning experience, one where students can design their own curricula as their interests change and develop.

===Japan ICU Foundation===
The Japan ICU Foundation (JICUF)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jicuf.org|title=Home Cover Page|publisher=|accessdate=July 29, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; was incorporated in [[New York (state)|New York State]] on November 23, 1948 and helped to establish ICU in 1953. Today, the foundation maintains two [[Nonprofit organization|non-profit corporations]]: The Japan ICU Foundation, Inc. and the JICUF Endowment, Inc.

The Japan ICU Foundation supports ICU in a variety of ways, including providing scholarships, running a faculty exchange program, providing funding for international programs and projects and helping to fund new buildings on campus. The Foundation has offices in [[New York City]]. The current president of JICUF is Dr. David Vikner.

== Research Institutes ==
ICU has eight research institutes as of 2016. In addition to research, these institutes plan and sponsor conferences, lectures, symposia and seminars as well as provide students with opportunities to meet distinguished scholars from Japan and overseas.
* The Institute of Educational Research and Service (IERS)
* The Social Science Research Institute (SSRI)
* The Institute for the Study of Christianity and Culture (ICC)
* The Institute of Asian Cultural Studies (IACS)
* The Peace Research Institute (PRI)

The ICU Graduate School had 150 students, with 64 men and 86 women. 90.5% of ICU's undergraduate and graduate students are Japanese citizens, and the remainder represent 44 countries. Many returnee Japanese students that have lived overseas, also known as [[kikokushijo]] (帰国子女), make up the student body.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icu.ac.jp/en//about/info/outline/Student.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of ICU students live off-campus, either at home with their families or in apartments. As of 2010, about 600 students were living on campus.

=== International Education Exchange Programs ===
More than half of the students participate in study abroad programs during their time at ICU. The percentage of students who study abroad through ICU programs before they graduate is 55.5% (in 2014). Students who come from abroad to study at ICU on a year-long exchange program are referred to as OYRs (One Year Regulars).

===ICU Dining Hall===
The ICU Dining Hall, also known as Gakki (ガッキ), is the official cafeteria of International Christian University. Rebuilt in 2010, Gakki is a public, self-service [[cafeteria]] and is one of the newest and most renowned buildings on campus.

===Student clubs/circles===
ICU students are known for their remarkable energy and initiative in creating a kaleidoscope of student-led and student-managed co-curricular activities. There are about 100 student-led clubs and organizations in the arts, sports, academic and social fields. New clubs are formed as student interest dictates, and most ICU students participate in one or more of these organizations.

=== After Graduation ===
As of 2016, 95.3% of ICU undergraduate alumni (students seeking employment) land a job right after graduation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.icu.ac.jp/en/campuslife/career/index.html|title=Paths after Graduation|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ICU students have found employment in a wide range of industries, particularly with global companies.

Over 20% of students go on to graduate school overseas and in Japan. Domestic and Overseas Universities include: International Christian University, [[University of Tokyo]], [[Kyoto University]], [[Hitotsubashi University]], [[University of Oxford]], [[Columbia University]], [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], [[University of London]], [[Harvard University]], and many more.

==Accreditation==
Accreditation actions had been taken at the [[American Academy for Liberal Education]] Board of Trustees Meeting at November 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aale.org/highered/decisions.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511011141/http://aale.org/highered/decisions.html |archivedate=May 11, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* International Christian University, Tokyo, Japan - granted Programmatic Accreditation, through November 2015

ICU's academic programs of the College of Liberal Arts and the Graduate School are individually chartered by the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Japanese Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT). ICU has also received accreditation from the Japan University Accreditation Association (JUAA).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.icu.ac.jp/en/about/info/evaluation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the ''Weekly Economist'''s ({{Interlanguage link multi|Shūkan ekonomisuto|ja|3=エコノミスト (雑誌)}}) 2010 rankings and the ({{Interlanguage link multi|PRESIDENT inc.|ja|3=プレジデント社}}) article on 2006/10/16, graduates from ICU have the 24th best employment rate in 400 major companies, and their average graduate salary is the 4th best in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.ttcn.ne.jp/honkawa/3865.html|title=Employment rate in 400 major companies rankings |year=2011 |publisher=Weekly Economist |accessdate=Apr 29, 2011|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=大学偏差値情報局 |time= 02:51|url=http://hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net/article/26733115.html#more |title=年収偏差値・給料偏差値ランキング（2006・10・16）：稼げる大学はどれ？ |publisher=Hensachi-ranking.seesaa.net |date=1999-02-22 |accessdate=2011-10-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;This 400 major companies exclude foreign companies, thus the ranking position tends to be lower for ICU which has many alumni who work in foreign companies&lt;/ref&gt;

===Popularity and selectivity===
ICU is one of the most selective universities in Japan. Its entrance difficulty is usually considered as one of the top among 730 private universities. National and public universities use different kinds of exams. Thus it's only comparable between universities in the same category, e.g., {{Interlanguage link multi|Yoyogi seminar|ja|3=代々木ゼミナール}} published Hensachi (the indication showing the entrance difficulties by prep schools) rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |title=代々木ゼミナール（予備校） - ご案内 |publisher= |accessdate=July 29, 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110422110816/http://yozemi.ac.jp/rank/gakubu/index.html |archivedate=April 22, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Japanese journalist {{Interlanguage link multi|Kiyoshi Shimano|ja|3=島野清志}} ranks its entrance difficulty as SA (most selective/out of 11 scales) in Japan, which includes only four private universities and 11 national universities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |script-title=ja:危ない大学・消える大学 2012年版 |year=2011 |publisher=YELL books |url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%8D%B1%E3%81%AA%E3%81%84%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6%E3%83%BB%E6%B6%88%E3%81%88%E3%82%8B%E5%A4%A7%E5%AD%A6-%EF%BC%92%EF%BC%90%EF%BC%91%EF%BC%92%E5%B9%B4%E7%89%88-YELL-books-%E5%B3%B6%E9%87%8E-%E6%B8%85%E5%BF%97/dp/4753930181|language=Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

in [[Modern Persian]] {{lang|fa|آیین مانی}} ''Āyin-e Māni''; {{zh|c={{linktext|摩|尼|教}}|p={{linktext|Mó|ní |Jiào}}}}) was a major religious movement that was founded by the [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/362129/Mani |title=Mani (Iranian prophet) |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; prophet [[Mani (prophet)|Mani]] (in {{lang-fa|مانی}}, [[Syriac language|Syriac]]: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="ltr"&gt;[[wikt:ܡܐܢܝ|ܡܐܢܝ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/mɑni/}}, [[Latin]]: ''Manichaeus'' or ''Manes'' from {{lang-grc-koi|Μάνης}}; {{circa}} 216–276) in the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www-bcf.usc.edu/~sbriggs/Britannica/manichaeism.htm |title=Manichaeism |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=4 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09591a.htm |title=Manichaeism |publisher=New Advent Encyclopedia |accessdate=4 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism taught an elaborate [[dualistic cosmology]] describing the [[conflict between good and evil|struggle]] between a [[goodness and value theory|good]], spiritual world of light, and an [[evil]], material world of darkness.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cosmogony-iii|title=COSMOGONY AND COSMOLOGY iii. In Manicheism|website=Encyclopædia Iranica|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24|quote=[I]n Manicheism the world was a prison for demons...}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an ongoing process that takes place in human history, light is gradually removed from the world of matter and returned to the world of light, whence it came. Its beliefs were based on local Mesopotamian religious movements and [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Widengren, Geo ''Mesopotamian elements in Manichaeism (King and Saviour II): Studies in Manichaean, Mandaean, and Syrian-gnostic religion'', Lundequistska bokhandeln, 1946.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism was quickly successful and spread far through the [[Aramaic language|Aramaic]]-speaking regions.&lt;ref name="BeDuhnMirecki2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jason BeDuhn|author2=Paul Allan Mirecki|title=Frontiers of Faith: The Christian Encounter With Manichaeism in the Acts of Archelaus|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JQd8b5s5QBUC&amp;pg=PA6|year=2007|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-16180-1|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It thrived between the third and seventh centuries, and at its height was one of the most widespread religions in the world. Manichaean churches and scriptures existed as far east as [[China]] and as far west as the [[Roman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Welburn, ''Mani, the Angel and the Column of Glory: An Anthology of Manichaean Texts'' (Edinburgh: Floris Books, 1998), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; It was briefly the main rival to [[Christianity]] before the spread of Islam in the competition to replace [[Hellenistic religion|classical paganism]]. Manichaeism survived longer in the east than in the west, and it appears to have finally faded away after the 14th century in [[south China]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Jason BeDuhn|Jason David BeDuhn]] ''The Manichaean Body: In Discipline and Ritual'' Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press. 2000 republished 2002 p.IX&lt;/ref&gt; contemporary to the decline of the [[Church of the East]] in [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]]. While most of Manichaeism's original writings have been lost, numerous translations and fragmentary texts have survived.

An adherent of Manichaeism is called a ''Manichaean'' or ''Manichean'', or ''Manichee'', especially in older sources.&lt;ref&gt;Such as the Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers First Series, ed. Philip Schaff, writing of Augustine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/Manichaean Merriam-Webster ─ Manichaean]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Life of Mani===

{{main|Mani (prophet)}}
Mani was an [[Iranian peoples|Iranian]]&lt;ref&gt;Mary Boyce, ''Zoroastrians: their religious beliefs and practices'', Routledge, 2001. p. 111: "He was Iranian, of noble Parthian blood..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Warwick Ball, ''Rome in the East: the transformation of an empire'', Routledge, 2001. p. 437: "Manichaeism was a syncretic religion, proclaimed by the Iranian Prophet Mani...&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{quote|According to the ''Fehrest'', Mani was of [[Parthian Empire|Arsacid]] stock on both his father's and his mother's sides, at least if the readings al-ḥaskāniya (Mani's father) and al-asʿāniya (Mani's mother) are corrected to al-aškāniya and al-ašḡāniya (ed. Flügel, 1862, p. 49, ll. 2 and 3) respectively. The forefathers of Mani's father are said to have been from Hamadan and so perhaps of Iranian origin (ed. Flügel, 1862, p. 49, 5–6). The ''Chinese Compendium'', which makes the father a local king, maintains that his mother was from the house Jinsajian, explained by Henning as the Armenian Arsacid family of Kamsarakan (Henning, 1943, p. 52, n. 4 1977, II, p. 115). Is that fact, or fiction, or both? The historicity of this tradition is assumed by most, but the possibility that Mani's noble Arsacid background is legendary cannot be ruled out (cf. Scheftelowitz, 1933, pp. 403–4). In any case, it is characteristic that Mani took pride in his origin from time-honored [[Babylon|Babel]], but never claimed affiliation to the Iranian upper class.|{{iranica|mani-founder-manicheism}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; born in 216 in or near [[Seleucia]]-[[Ctesiphon]] (now [[al-Mada'in]]) in the [[Parthian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Kevin Coyle|title=Manichaeism and Its Legacy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnFz3tI0qOwC&amp;pg=PR13|accessdate=27 August 2012|date=15 September 2009|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-17574-7|pages=13–}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]'',&lt;ref name="Mani-Kodex"&gt;L. Koenen and C. Römer, eds., ''Der Kölner Mani-Kodex. Über das Werden seines Leibes. Kritische Edition'', (Abhandlung der Reinisch-Westfälischen Akademie der Wissenschaften: Papyrologica Coloniensia '''14''') (Opladen, Germany) 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; Mani's parents were members of the [[Jewish Christian]] [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] [[sect]] known as the [[Elcesaites]].&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|mani-founder-manicheism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mani composed seven works, six of which were written in the [[Syriac language]], a late variety of Aramaic. The seventh, the ''[[Shabuhragan]]'',&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"&gt;Middle Persian Sources: D. N. MacKenzie, ''Mani's Šābuhragān'', pt. 1 (text and translation), BSOAS 42/3, 1979, pp. 500–34, pt. 2 (glossary and plates), BSOAS 43/2, 1980, pp. 288–310.&lt;/ref&gt; was written by Mani in [[Middle Persian]] and presented by him to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian emperor]], [[Shapur I]]. Although there is no proof Shapur I was a Manichaean, he tolerated the spread of Manichaeism and refrained from persecuting it within his empire's boundaries.&lt;ref&gt;Welburn (1998), pp. 67–68&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one tradition, it was Mani himself who invented the unique version of the Syriac script known as the [[Manichaean alphabet]]{{citation needed|date = November 2018}}, which was used in all of the Manichaean works written within the Sasanian Empire, whether they were in Syriac or [[Middle Persian]], and also for most of the works written within the [[Uyghur Khaganate]]. The primary language of [[Babylon]] (and the administrative and cultural language of the Sassanid Empire) at that time was [[Middle Aramaic|Eastern Middle Aramaic]], which included three main dialects: [[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]] (the language of the [[Babylonian Talmud]]), [[Mandaic language|Mandaean]] (the language of [[Mandaeism]]), and Syriac, which was the language of Mani, as well as of the [[Syriac Christianity|Syriac Christians]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

While Manichaeism was spreading, existing religions such as [[Zoroastrianism]] were still popular and [[Christianity]] was gaining social and political influence. Although having fewer adherents, Manichaeism won the support of many high-ranking political figures. With the assistance of the Sasanian Empire, Mani began missionary expeditions. After failing to win the favour of the next generation of Persian royalty, and incurring the disapproval of the Zoroastrian clergy, Mani is reported to have died in prison awaiting execution by the Persian Emperor [[Bahram I]]. The date of his death is estimated at 276–277.&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"/&gt;

[[File:Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation. Cathayan Manichaean silk painting, 13th-century.jpg|thumb|''[[Sermon on Mani's Teaching of Salvation]]'', 13th-century Chinese Manichaean silk painting.]]
Mani believed that the teachings of [[Gautama Buddha]], [[Zoroaster]], and [[Jesus]] were incomplete, and that his revelations were for the entire world, calling his teachings the "Religion of Light".&lt;ref name="Coyle2009" /&gt; Manichaean writings indicate that Mani received revelations when he was 12 and again when he was 24, and over this time period he grew dissatisfied with the Elcesaite sect he was born into.&lt;ref name="Reeves1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=John C. Reeves|title=Heralds of That Good Realm: Syro-Mesopotamian Gnosis and Jewish Traditions|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ewM1xTuRQaoC&amp;pg=PA6|accessdate=27 August 2012|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10459-4|pages=6–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mani began preaching at an early age and was possibly influenced by contemporary Babylonian-Aramaic movements such as Mandaeism, and Aramaic translations of [[Jewish eschatology|Jewish apocalyptic writings]] similar to those found at [[Qumran]] (such as the [[book of Enoch]] literature), and by the Syriac dualist-gnostic writer [[Bardaisan]] (who lived a generation before Mani). With the discovery of the Mani-Codex, it also became clear that he was raised in a Jewish-Christian baptism sect, the [[Elcesaites]], and was influenced by their writings, as well. According to biographies preserved by [[Ibn al-Nadim]] and the Persian [[polymath]] [[al-Biruni]], he received a revelation as a youth from a spirit, whom he would later call his Twin ({{lang-arc|[[wikt:תאומא|תאומא]]}} {{ipa|tɑʔwmɑ}}, from which is also derived the name of the [[Thomas the Apostle]], the "twin"), his ''Syzygos'' ({{lang-grc-koi|[[wikt:σύζυγος|σύζυγος]]}} "spouse, partner", in the ''[[Cologne Mani-Codex]]''), his Double, his Protective Angel or Divine Self. It taught him truths that he developed into a religion. His divine Twin or true Self brought Mani to [[self-realization]]. He claimed to be the ''[[Paraclete]] of the Truth'', as promised by Jesus in the New Testament.&lt;ref name="THE ROLE OF THE PARACLETE"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lutkemeyer |first=Lawrence J. |last2= |first2= |title=THE ROLE OF THE PARACLETE (Jn. 16:7-15) |jstor=43719890|journal=The Catholic Biblical Quarterly |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=220–229 |doi= |year=1946 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism's views on Jesus are described by historians:
{{quote|Jesus in Manichaeism possessed three separate identities: (1) Jesus the Luminous, (2) Jesus the Messiah and (3) Jesus patibilis (the suffering Jesus). (1) As Jesus the Luminous... his primary role was as supreme revealer and guide and it was he who woke Adam from his slumber and revealed to him the divine origins of his soul and its painful captivity by the body and mixture with matter. Jesus the Messiah was a historical being who was the prophet of the Jews and the forerunner of Mani. However, the Manichaeans believed he was wholly divine. He never experienced human birth as notions of physical conception and birth filled the Manichaeans with horror and the Christian doctrine of virgin birth was regarded as equally obscene. Since he was the light of the world, where was this light, they asked, when he was in the womb of the Virgin? (2) Jesus the Messiah was truly born at his baptism as it was on that occasion that the Father openly acknowledged his sonship. The suffering, death and resurrection of this Jesus were in appearance only as they had no salvific value but were an exemplum of the suffering and eventual deliverance of the human soul and a prefiguration of Mani's own martyrdom. (3) The pain suffered by the imprisoned Light-Particles in the whole of the visible universe, on the other hand, was real and immanent. This was symbolized by the ''mystic placing of the Cross whereby the wounds of the passion of our souls are set forth''. On this mystical Cross of Light was suspended the Suffering Jesus (Jesus patibilis) who was ''the life and salvation of Man''. This mystica cruxificio was present in every tree, herb, fruit, vegetable and even stones and the soil. This constant and universal suffering of the captive soul is exquisitely expressed in one of the Coptic Manichaean psalms.&lt;ref name="SNC Lieu"&gt;{{cite book |title=Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China |first=Samuel N.

{{quote|Other than incorporating the symbols and doctrine of dominant religious traditions, Manichaeism also incorporated the symbols and deities of indigenous traditions, in particular the [[Hindu]] deity [[Ganesha]] into its fold, demonstrated by the image available in the article, "Manichaean Art and Calligraphy" by Hans-Joachim Klimkeit. Mani was claiming to be the reincarnation of the Buddha, Lord Krishna, Zoroaster and Jesus depending on the context in which he was carrying out his preachings. Such strategic claims fostered a spirit of toleration among the Manichaeans and the other religious communities and this particular feature greatly assisted them in gaining the approval of authorities to practice in different regions along the [[Silk Road]].&lt;ref name="Silkspice.wordpress.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://silkspice.wordpress.com/2011/04/ |title=The movement of the Manichaean tradition along the Silk Road |publisher=Silkspice.wordpress.com |date=2011-04-05 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Academics also note that since much of what is known about Manichaeism comes from later 10th- and 11th-century Muslim historians like [[Al-Biruni]] and especially [[ibn al-Nadim]] (and his ''Fihrist''), "Islamic authors ascribed to Mani the claim to be the Seal of the Prophets."&lt;ref&gt;{{iranica|eschatology-ii|ESCHATOLOGY ii. Manichean Eschatology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, for Mani the expression "seal of prophecy" refers to his disciples, who testify for the veracity of his message, as a seal does.&lt;ref&gt;C. Colpe, ''Das Siegel der Propheten: historische Beziehungen zwischen Judentum, Judenchristentum, Heidentum und frühem Islam'', Arbeiten zur neutestamentlichen Theologie und Zeitgeschichte, 3 (Berlin: Institut Kirche und judentum, 1990), 227-43; G.G. Stroumsa, ''The Making of the Abrahamic Religions in Late Antiquity'', Oxford Studies in the Abrahamic Religions (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2015), 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ManichaeanElectaeKocho10thCentury.jpg|thumb|10th century Manichaean Electae in [[Gaochang]] (Khocho), China.]]
Another source of Mani's scriptures was original Aramaic writings relating to the ''Book of Enoch'' literature (see the [[Book of Enoch]] and the [[Second Book of Enoch]]), as well as an otherwise unknown section of the Book of Enoch called ''[[The Book of Giants]]''. This book was quoted directly, and expanded on by Mani, becoming one of the original six Syriac writings of the Manichaean Church. Besides brief references by non-Manichaean authors through the centuries, no original sources of ''The Book of Giants'' (which is actually part six of the Book of Enoch) were available until the 20th century.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Scattered fragments of both the original Aramaic "Book of Giants" (which were analyzed and published by [[Józef Milik]] in 1976)&lt;ref&gt;J. T. Milik, ed. and trans., ''The Books of Enoch: Aramaic Fragments of Qumran Cave 4'', Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; and of the Manichaean version of the same name (analyzed and published by [[Walter Bruno Henning]] in 1943)&lt;ref name="Henning"&gt;In: Henning, W. B., ''The Book of Giants'', BSOAS, Vol. XI, Part 1, 1943, pp. 52–74.&lt;/ref&gt; were found with the discovery in the twentieth century of the [[Dead Sea Scrolls]] in the Judaean Desert and the Manichaean writings of the [[Uyghurs|Uyghur]] Manichaean kingdom in [[Turpan]]. Henning wrote in his analysis of them:

{{quote|It is noteworthy that Mani, who was brought up and spent most of his life in a province of the Persian empire, and whose mother belonged to a famous Parthian family, did not make any use of the Iranian mythological tradition. There can no longer be any doubt that the Iranian names of [[Sām]], [[Nariman (Shahnameh)|Narīmān]], etc., that appear in the Persian and Sogdian versions of the Book of the Giants, did not figure in the original edition, written by Mani in the Syriac language.&lt;ref name="Henning"/&gt;}}

By comparing the cosmology in the Book of Enoch literature and the Book of Giants, alongside the description of the Manichaean myth, scholars have observed that the Manichaean cosmology can be described as being based, in part, on the description of the cosmology developed in detail in the Book of Enoch literature.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves, John C. ''Jewish Lore in Manichaean Cosmogony: Studies in the Book of Giants Traditions'' (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; This literature describes the being that the prophets saw in their ascent to heaven, as a king who sits on a throne at the highest of the heavens. In the Manichaean description, this being, the "Great King of Honor", becomes a deity who guards the entrance to the world of light, placed at the seventh of ten heavens.&lt;ref&gt;See Henning, ''A Sogdian Fragment of the Manichaean Cosmogony'', BSOAS, 1948&lt;/ref&gt; In the Aramaic Book of Enoch, in the Qumran writings in general, and in the original Syriac section of Manichaean scriptures quoted by [[Theodore bar Konai]],&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; he is called "malka raba de-ikara" (the Great King of Honor).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Mani was also influenced by writings of the Assyrian gnostic [[Bardaisan]] (154–222), who, like Mani, wrote in Syriac, and presented a dualistic interpretation of the world in terms of light and darkness, in combination with elements from Christianity.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Noting Mani's travels to the [[Kushan Empire]] (several religious paintings in [[Bamyan]] are attributed to him) at the beginning of his proselytizing career, [[Richard Foltz]] postulates Buddhist influences in Manichaeism:
{{quote|Buddhist influences were significant in the formation of Mani's religious thought. The transmigration of souls became a Manichaean belief, and the quadripartite structure of the Manichaean community, divided between male and female monks (the "elect") and lay followers (the "hearers") who supported them, appears to be based on that of the Buddhist [[sangha]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Foltz]], ''Religions of the Silk Road'', Palgrave Macmillan, 2nd edition, 2010, p. 71 {{ISBN|978-0-230-62125-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Kushan Empire|Kushan]] monk [[Lokaksema (Buddhist monk)|Lokakṣema]] began translating [[Pure Land Buddhism|Pure Land Buddhist]] texts into Chinese in the century prior to Mani arriving there, and the Chinese texts of Manichaeism are full of uniquely Buddhist terms taken directly from these Chinese Pure Land scriptures, including the term "[[pure land]]" (淨土 Jìngtǔ) itself.&lt;ref&gt;Peter Bryder, ''The Chinese Transformation of Manichaeism: A Study of Chinese Manichaean Terminology'', 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the central object of veneration in Pure Land Buddhism, [[Amitābha]], the Buddha of Infinite Light, does not appear in [[Chinese Manichaeism]], and seems to have been replaced by another deity.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Spread===
[[File:Spread of Manicheanism.png|alt=|thumb|310x310px|The spread of Manichaeism (300–500). ''World History Atlas'', Dorling Kindersly.]]
Manichaeism spread with extraordinary speed through both the East and West. It reached Rome through the apostle Psattiq by 280, who was also in [[Egypt]] in 244 and 251. It was flourishing in the [[Faiyum]] in 290.

Manichaean monasteries existed in Rome in 312 during the time of [[Pope Miltiades]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

In 291, persecution arose in the Sasanian Empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by Emperor [[Bahram II]], and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, [[Diocletian]] decreed against the Manichaeans: "We order that their organizers and leaders be subject to the final penalties and condemned to the fire with their abominable scriptures." This resulted in martyrdom for many in Egypt and [[North Africa]] (see [[Diocletianic Persecution#Manichean persecution|Diocletian Persecution]]). By 354, [[Hilary of Poitiers]] wrote that Manichaeism was a significant force in [[Roman Gaul]]. In 381, Christians requested [[Theodosius I]] to strip Manichaeans of their civil rights. Starting in 382, the emperor issued a series of edicts to suppress Manichaeism and punish its followers.&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Samuel (1992) ''Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China'' 2d edition, pp. 145-48&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tiffany Window of St Augustine - Lightner Museum.jpg|thumb|[[Augustine of Hippo]] was once a Manichaean.]]
[[Augustine of Hippo]] (354–430) converted to Christianity from Manichaeism in the year 387. This was shortly after the Roman emperor [[Theodosius I]] had issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 and shortly before he declared Christianity to be the only legitimate religion for the Roman Empire in 391. Due to the heavy persecution, the religion almost disappeared from western Europe in the 5th century and from the eastern portion of the empire in the 6th century.&lt;ref name="Wendy"/&gt; According to his ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'', after nine or ten years of adhering to the Manichaean faith as a member of the group of "hearers", Augustine became a Christian and a potent adversary of Manichaeism (which he expressed in writing against his Manichaean opponent [[Faustus of Mileve]]), seeing their beliefs that knowledge was the key to salvation as too passive and not able to effect any change in one's life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=418 |title=St. Augustine of Hippo |publisher=Catholic.org |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|I still thought that it is not we who sin but some other nature that sins within us. It flattered my pride to think that I incurred no guilt and, when I did wrong, not to confess it... I preferred to excuse myself and blame this unknown thing which was in me but was not part of me. The truth, of course, was that it was all my own self, and my own impiety had divided me against myself. My sin was all the more incurable because I did not think myself a sinner.&lt;ref&gt;''Confessions, Book V, Section 10''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Some modern scholars have suggested that Manichaean ways of thinking influenced the development of some of Augustine's ideas, such as the nature of good and evil, the idea of hell, the separation of groups into elect, hearers, and sinners, and the hostility to the flesh and sexual activity, and his dualistic theology.&lt;ref&gt;A. Adam, ''Das Fortwirken des Manichäismus bei Augustin''. In: ZKG (69) 1958, S. 1–25.&lt;/ref&gt; These influences of Manichaeism in Augustine's Christian thinking may well have been part of the conflict between Augustine and [[Pelagius]], a British monk whose theology, being less influenced by the [[Latin Church]], was non-dualistic, and one that saw the created order, and mankind in particular, as having a Divine core, rather than a 'darkness' at its core.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

[[File:Augustine Confessiones.jpg|thumb|A 13th-century manuscript from Augustine's book VII of ''[[Confessions (Augustine)|Confessions]]'' criticizing Manichaeism.]]
How Manichaeism might have influenced Christianity continues to be debated. Manichaeism could have influenced the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]], [[Paulicianism|Paulicians]], and [[Catharism|Cathars]]. However, these groups left few records, and the link between them and Manichaeans is tenuous. Regardless of its accuracy, the charge of Manichaeism was leveled at them by contemporary orthodox opponents, who often tried to make contemporary heresies conform to those combatted by the church fathers. Whether the [[Dualistic cosmology|dualism]] of the Paulicians, Bogomils, and Cathars and their belief that the world was created by a Satanic [[demiurge]] were due to influence from Manichaeism is impossible to determine. The Cathars apparently adopted the Manichaean principles of church organization. [[Priscillian]] and his followers may also have been influenced by Manichaeism. The Manichaeans preserved many [[apocrypha]]l Christian works, such as the [[Acts of Thomas]], that would otherwise have been lost.&lt;ref name="Runciman"&gt;Runciman, Steven, ''The Medieval Manichee: a study of the Christian dualist heresy''. Cambridge University Press, 1947.&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism maintained a sporadic and intermittent existence in the west ([[Mesopotamia]], [[Africa]], [[Spain]], [[France]], North [[Italy]], the [[Balkans]]) for a thousand years, and flourished for a time in Persia and even further east in Northern [[India]], Western China, and [[Tibet]]. While it had long been thought that Manichaeism arrived in China only at the end of the 7th century, a recent archaeological discovery demonstrated that it was already known there in the second half of the 6th century.&lt;ref name="La Vaissiere"&gt;Étienne de la Vaissière, "Mani en Chine au VIe siècle", ''Journal asiatique'', 293–1 (2005): 357–378.&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Song Dynasty, the Manichaeans were derogatorily referred by the Chinese as ''chicai simo'' (meaning that they "abstain from meat and worship demons"). An account in ''Fozu Tongji'', an important historiography of Buddhism in China compiled by Buddhist scholars during 1258-1269, says that the Manichaens worshipped the "white Buddha" and their leader wore a violet headgear, while the followers wore white costumes.

Manichaeism claimed to present the complete version of teachings that were corrupted and misinterpreted by the followers of its predecessors Adam, Zoroaster, Buddha and Jesus. Accordingly, as it spread, it adapted new deities from other religions into forms it could use for its scriptures. Its original Aramaic texts already contained stories of Jesus. When they moved eastward and were translated into Iranian languages, the names of the Manichaean deities (or angels) were often transformed into the names of Zoroastrian [[yazata]]s. Thus ''Abbā dəRabbūṯā'' ("The Father of Greatness", the highest Manichaean deity of Light), in [[Middle Persian]] texts might either be translated literally as ''pīd ī wuzurgīh'', or substituted with the name of the deity ''[[Zurvan|Zurwān]]''. Similarly, the Manichaean primal figure ''Nāšā Qaḏmāyā'' "The Original Man" was rendered ''Ohrmazd Bay'', after the Zoroastrian god [[Ahura Mazda|Ohrmazd]]. This process continued in Manichaeism's meeting with [[Chinese Buddhism]], where, for example, the original Aramaic {{lang|arc|קריא}} ''qaryā'' (the "call" from the World of Light to those seeking rescue from the World of Darkness), becomes identified in the Chinese scriptures with [[Guanyin]] ({{script|Hant|觀音}} or [[Avalokiteśvara]] in Sanskrit, literally, "watching/perceiving sounds [of the world]", the [[bodhisattva]] of Compassion).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Persecution and extinction===
Manichaeism was repressed by the [[Sasanian Empire]].&lt;ref name="Andrew"/&gt; In 291, persecution arose in the Persian empire with the murder of the apostle Sisin by [[Bahram II]], and the slaughter of many Manichaeans. In 296, the Roman emperor [[Diocletian]] decreed all the Manichaean leaders to be burnt alive along with the Manichaean scriptures and many Manichaeans in Europe and North Africa were killed. This policy of persecution was also followed by his successors. [[Theodosius I]] issued a decree of death for all Manichaean monks in 382 AD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=bI9_AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA361|title= Faiths Across Time: 5000 years of Religious History|author= J.

[[Augustine of Hippo]], one of the early Doctors of the Catholic Church was a Manichaean until his conversion to Christianity in 386.

However the foreigners who followed the religion were allowed to practice it without punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=cO7g4WBBK9YC&amp;pg=PA182|title= Silk and Religion: An Exploration of Material Life and the Thought of People, AD 600-1200, Parts 600–1200|first= Xinru|last= Liu|publisher= [[Oxford University Press]]|year= 1997|page= 182|isbn= 9780195644524}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the fall of the Uyghur Khaganate in 840, which was the chief patron of Manichaeism (which was also the state religion of the Khaganate) in China, all Manichaean temples in China except in the two capitals and [[Taiyuan]] were closed down and never reopened since these temples were viewed as a symbol of foreign arrogance by the Chinese (see [[Cao'an]].) Even those that were allowed to remain open did not for long. The Manichaean temples were attacked by Chinese people who burned the images and idols of these temples. Manichaean priests were ordered to wear [[hanfu]] instead of their traditional clothing, which was viewed as un-Chinese. In 843, [[Emperor Wuzong of Tang]] gave the order to kill all Manichaean clerics as part of his [[Great Anti-Buddhist Persecution]], and over half died. They were made to look like Buddhists by the authorities, their heads were shaved, they were made to dress like [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] and then killed.&lt;ref name="S.N.C.L."/&gt; Although the religion was mostly forbidden and its followers persecuted thereafter in China, it survived till the 14th century in the country. Under the [[Song dynasty]], its followers were derogatorily referred to with the [[chengyu]] {{lang|zh|吃菜祀魔}} ({{zh|p=chī cài sì mó}}) "vegetarian demon-worshippers".

Many Manichaeans took part in rebellions against the Song dynasty. They were quelled by Song China and were suppressed and persecuted by all successive governments before the Mongol [[Yuan dynasty]]. In 1370, the religion was banned through an edict of the [[Ming dynasty]], whose [[Hongwu Emperor]] had a personal dislike for the religion.&lt;ref name="S.N.C.L."/&gt;&lt;ref name="Xisha2011"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=O_vnAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA261|title= Manichaeism in the Later Roman Empire and Medieval China: A Historical Survey|author= Samuel N.C.

According to [[Wendy Doniger]], Manichaeism may have continued to exist in the modern-[[East Turkestan]] region until the [[Mongol conquest of the Qara Khitai|Mongol conquest in the 13th century]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=ZP_f9icf2roC&amp;pg=PA690|title= Merriam-Webster's Encyclopedia of World Religions|author= [[Wendy Doniger]]|publisher= [[Merriam-Webster]]|year= 1999|page= 690|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manicheans also suffered persecution for some time under the Abbasid Caliphate of Baghdad. In 780, the third Abbasid Caliph, [[al-Mahdi]], started a campaign of inquisition against those who were "dualist heretics" or "Manichaeans" called the ''zindīq''. He appointed a "master of the heretics" ({{lang-ar|الزنادقة صاحب}} ''ṣāhib al-zanādiqa''), an official whose task was to pursue and investigate suspected dualists, who were then examined by the Caliph. Those found guilty who refused to abjure their beliefs were executed. This persecution continued under his successor, Caliph [[al-Hadi]], and continued for some time during reign of [[Harun al-Rashid]], who finally abolished it and ended it.&lt;ref name="Christine"/&gt; During the reign of the 18th Abbassid Caliph [[al-Muqtadir]], many Manichaeans fled from [[Mesopotamia]] to [[Greater Khorasan|Khorasan]] from fear of persecution by him and about 500 of them assembled in [[Samarkand]]. The base of the religion was later shifted to this city, which became their new Patriarchate.&lt;ref name="Wendy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacques"&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=YdUUAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA658|title= Papers in Honor of Professor Mary Boyce|author= Jacques Duchesne-Guillemin, Pierre Lecoq|publisher= [[Brill Publishers]]|year= 1985|page= 658|isbn= 9789068310023}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later movements accused of "Neo-Manichaeism"===
During the Middle Ages, several movements emerged that were collectively described as "Manichaean" by the Catholic Church, and persecuted as Christian heresies through the establishment, in 1184, of the [[Medieval Inquisition|Inquisition]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Stroumsa|Stroumsa, Gedaliahu G.]], ''Anti-Cathar Polemics and the Liber de duobus principiis'', in B. Lewis and F. Niewöhner, eds., Religionsgespräche im Mittelalter (Wolfenbütteler Mittelalter-Studien, 4; Wiesbaden: Harrassowitz, 1992), 169–183, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; They included the [[Cathar]] churches of Western Europe. Other groups sometimes referred to as "neo-Manichaean" were the [[Paulicianism|Paulician]] movement, which arose in Armenia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/11583b.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Paulicians |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1911-02-01 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Bogomilism|Bogomils]] in Bulgaria.&lt;ref name="Runciman"/&gt; An example of this usage can be found in the published edition of the Latin Cathar text, the ''Liber de duobus principiis'' (''Book of the Two Principles''), which was described as "Neo-Manichaean" by its publishers.&lt;ref&gt;Dondaine, Antoine. O.P. ''Un traite neo-manicheen du XIIIe siecle: Le Liber de duobus principiis, suivi d'un fragment de rituel Cathare'' (Rome: Institutum Historicum Fratrum Praedicatorum, 1939)&lt;/ref&gt; As there is no presence of Manichaean mythology or church terminology in the writings of these groups, there has been some dispute among historians as to whether these groups were descendants of Manichaeism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/01267e.htm |title=CATHOLIC ENCYCLOPEDIA: Albigenses |publisher=Newadvent.org |date=1907-03-01 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Teachings and beliefs==
===General===
Mani's teaching dealt with the origin of evil,&lt;ref name="Coyle2009"/&gt; by addressing a theoretical part of the [[problem of evil]] by denying the omnipotence of God and postulating two opposite powers. Manichaean theology taught a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] view of good and evil. A key belief in Manichaeism is that the powerful, though not omnipotent good power (God), was opposed by the semi-eternal evil power (Satan). Humanity, the world and the soul are seen as the byproduct of the battle between God's proxy, Primal Man, and Satan. The human person is seen as a battleground for these powers: the soul defines the person, but it is under the influence of both [[light]] and [[dark]]. This contention plays out over the world as well as the human body—neither the Earth nor the flesh were seen as intrinsically evil, but rather possessed portions of both [[light]] and [[dark]]. Natural phenomena (such as rain) were seen as the physical manifestation of this spiritual contention. Therefore, the Manichaean worldview explained the existence of evil by positing a flawed creation in the formation of which God took no part and which constituted rather the product of a rebellion by Satan against God.&lt;ref name="Bevan, A. A. 1930"&gt;Bevan, A. A. (1930). "Manichaeism". ''[[Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics]]'', Volume VIII Ed. [[James Hastings]]. London&lt;/ref&gt;

Manichaeism presented an elaborate description of the conflict between the spiritual world of light and the material world of darkness. The beings of both the world of darkness and the world of light have names. There are numerous sources for the details of the Manichaean belief. There are two portions of Manichaean scriptures that are probably the closest thing to the original Manichaean writings in their original languages that will ever be available. These are the Syriac-Aramaic quotation by the [[Church of the East|Nestorian Christian]] [[Theodore bar Konai]], in his Syriac "Book of [[Scholia]]" (''Ketba de-Skolion''z, 8th century),&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; and the Middle Persian sections of Mani's [[Shabuhragan]] discovered at [[Turpan]] (a summary of Mani's teachings prepared for [[Shapur I]]&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"/&gt;). These two sections are probably the original Syriac and Middle Persian written by Mani.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

From these and other sources, it is possible to derive an almost complete description of the detailed Manichaean vision&lt;ref&gt;A completely sourced description (built around bar-Khoni's account, with additional sources), is found in: Jonas, Hans ''The Gnostic Religion'', 1958, Ch. 9: ''Creation, World History, Salvation According to Mani''.&lt;/ref&gt; (a complete list of Manichaean deities is outlined below). According to Mani, the unfolding of the universe takes place with three "creations":{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

'''The First Creation''': Originally, good and evil existed in two completely separate realms, one the ''World of Light'', ruled by the ''Father of Greatness'' together with his five ''Shekhinas'' (divine attributes of light), and the other the ''World of Darkness'', ruled by the ''King of Darkness''. At a certain point, the ''Kingdom of Darkness'' notices the ''World of Light'', becomes greedy for it and attacks it. The ''Father of Greatness'', in the first of three "creations" (or "calls"), calls to the ''Mother of Life'', who sends her son ''Original Man'' (''Nāšā Qaḏmāyā'' in Aramaic), to battle with the attacking powers of Darkness, which include the ''Demon of Greed''. The ''Original Man'' is armed with five different shields of light (reflections of the five ''Shekhinas''), which he loses to the forces of darkness in the ensuing battle, described as a kind of "bait" to trick the forces of darkness, as the forces of darkness greedily consume as much light as they can. When the ''Original Man'' comes to, he is trapped among the forces of darkness.

'''The Second Creation''': Then the ''Father of Greatness'' begins the ''Second Creation'', calling to the ''Living Spirit'', who calls to his five sons, and sends a call to the ''Original Man'' (''Call'' then becomes a Manichaean deity). An answer (''Answer'' becomes another Manichaean deity) then returns from the ''Original Man'' to the ''World of Light''. The ''Mother of Life'', the ''Living Spirit'', and his five sons begin to create the universe from the bodies of the evil beings of the ''World of Darkness'', together with the light that they have swallowed. Ten heavens and eight earths are created, all consisting of various mixtures of the evil material beings from the ''World of Darkness'' and the swallowed light. The sun, moon, and stars are all created from light recovered from the ''World of Darkness''. The waxing and waning of the moon is described as the moon filling with light, which passes to the sun, then through the [[Milky Way]], and eventually back to the ''World of Light''.

[[File:Analysis of Doctrinal Iconography of Mani’s Cosmology.jpg|thumb|400px|An analysis on Mani's cosmology.]]
'''The Third Creation''': Great demons (called ''[[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]]'' in bar-Khonai's account) are hung out over the heavens, and then the ''Father of Greatness'' begins the ''Third Creation''. Light is recovered from out of the material bodies of the male and female evil beings and demons, by causing them to become sexually aroused in greed, towards beautiful images of the beings of light, such as the ''Third Messenger'' and the ''Virgins of Light''. However, as soon as the light is expelled from their bodies and falls to the earth (some in the form of abortions – the source of [[fallen angel]]s in the Manichaean myth), the evil beings continue to swallow up as much of it as they can to keep the light inside of them. This results eventually in the evil beings swallowing huge quantities of light, copulating, and producing Adam and Eve. The ''Father of Greatness'' then sends the ''Radiant Jesus'' to awaken Adam, and to enlighten him to the true source of the light that is trapped in his material body. Adam and Eve, however, eventually copulate, and produce more human beings, trapping the light in bodies of mankind throughout human history. The appearance of the Prophet Mani was another attempt by the ''World of Light'' to reveal to mankind the true source of the spiritual light imprisoned within their material bodies.

===Outline of the beings and events in the Manichaean mythos===
[[File:Manichaean picture from cave 25 at Bezeklik Caves.jpg|thumb|Worshiping the Tree of Life in the Kingdom of Light.]]
Beginning with the time of its creation by Mani, the Manichaean religion had a detailed description of deities and events that took place within the Manichaean scheme of the universe. In every language and region that Manichaeism spread to, these same deities reappear, whether it is in the original Syriac quoted by Theodore bar Konai,&lt;ref name="Konai"/&gt; or the Latin terminology given by Saint Augustine from Mani's ''[[Fundamental Epistle|Epistola Fundamenti]]'', or the Persian and Chinese translations found as Manichaeism spread eastward. While the original Syriac retained the original description that Mani created, the transformation of the deities through other languages and cultures produced incarnations of the deities not implied in the original Syriac writings. This process began in Mani's lifetime, with "The Father of Greatness", for example, being translated into Middle Persian as [[Zurvanism|Zurvan]], a Zoroastrian supreme being.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Related to the story of the [[fallen angel]]s in the [[Book of Enoch]] (which Mani used extensively in The Book of Giants), and the {{lang|he|נפילים}} ''[[nephilim]]'' described in Genesis (6:1–4).

== The Manichaean Church ==
=== Organization ===
The Manichaean Church was divided into the Elect, who had taken upon themselves the vows of Manicheaism, and the Hearers, those who had not, but still participated in the Church. The terms for these divisions were already common since the days of [[early Christianity]]. In Chinese writings, the Middle Persian and Parthian terms are transcribed phonetically (instead of being translated into Chinese).&lt;ref&gt;G. Haloun and W. B. Henning, ''The Compendium of the Doctrines and Styles of the Teaching of Mani, the Buddha of Light'', Asia Major, 1952, pp. 184–212, p. 195.&lt;/ref&gt; These were recorded by [[Augustine of Hippo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/09591a.htm|title=Manichæism |encyclopedia=The Catholic Encyclopedia |date=1910 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The '''Leader''', (Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܟܗܢܐ|ܟܗܢܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/kɑhnɑ/}}; Parthian: ''yamag''; {{zh|c=閻默|p=yánmò}}) Mani's designated successor, seated as Patriarch at the head of the Church, originally in [[Ctesiphon]], from the ninth century in [[Samarkand]]. Two notable leaders were [[Mār Sīsin]] (or Sisinnios), the first successor of Mani, and [[Abū Hilāl al-Dayhūri]], an eighth-century leader.
* 12 '''[[Apostles]]''' (Latin: ''magistrī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܫܠܝܚܐ|ܫܠܝܚܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʃ(ə)liħe/}}; Middle Persian: ''možag''; {{zh|c=慕闍|p=mùdū}}). Three of Mani's original apostles were Mār Pattī (Pattikios; Mani's father), [[Akouas]] and [[Mar Ammo]].
* 72 '''[[Bishop]]s''' (Latin: ''episcopī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܐܦܣܩܘܦܐ|ܐܦܣܩܘܦܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʔappisqoppe/}}; Middle Persian: ''aspasag'', ''aftadan''; {{zh|c=薩波塞|p=sàbōsāi}} or {{zh|c=拂多誕|p=fúduōdàn}}; see also: [[seventy disciples]]). One of Mani's original disciples who was specifically referred to as a bishop was Mār Addā.
* 360 '''[[Presbyter]]s''' (Latin: ''presbyterī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;[[wikt:ܩܫܝܫܐ|ܩܫܝܫܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/qaʃʃiʃe/}}; Middle Persian: ''mahistan''; {{zh|c=默奚悉德|p=mòxīxīdé}})
* The general body of the '''Elect''' (Latin: ''ēlēctī''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr" dir="rtl"&gt;[[wikt:ܡܫܡܫܢܐ|ܡܫܡܫܢܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/m(ə)ʃamməʃɑne/}}; Middle Persian: ''ardawan'' or ''dēnāwar''; {{zh|c=阿羅緩|p=āluóhuǎn}} or {{zh|c=電那勿|p=diànnàwù}})
* The '''Hearers''' (Latin: ''audītōrēs''; Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܫܡܘܥܐ|ܫܡܘܥܐ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{ipa|/ʃɑmoʿe/}}; Middle Persian: ''niyoshagan''; {{zh|c=耨沙喭|p=nòushāyàn}})

=== Religious practices ===
The most important religious observance of the Manichaeans was the Bema Fest, observed annually:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The [[Bema#Christianity|Bema]] was originally, in the Syriac Christian churches, a seat placed in the middle of the nave on which the bishop would preside and from which the Gospel would be read. In the Manichaean places of worship, the throne was a five-stepped altar, covered by precious cloths, symbolizing the five classes of the hierarchy. The top of the Bema was always empty, as it was the seat of Mani. The Bema was celebrated at the [[vernal equinox]], was preceded by fasts, and symbolized the [[Passion (Christianity)|passion]] of Mani, thus it was strictly parallel to the Christian [[Easter]].&lt;ref&gt;Skjærvø, Prods Oktor, ''An Introduction to Manicheism'', 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

While it is often presumed that the Bema seat was empty, there is some evidence from the Coptic Manichaean ''Bema Psalms'', that the Bema seat may have actually contained a copy of Mani's picture book, the [[Arzhang]].&lt;ref&gt;
Ort, L. J. R., ''Mani: a religio-historical description of his personality'', 1967, p. 254.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Primary sources ==
[[File:Image of Buddha on a Manichaean Pictorial Roll.jpg|thumb|240px|Image of the [[Buddha]] as one of the primary prophets on a Manichaean pictorial roll fragment from [[Gaochang|Chotscho]], 10th century.]]
Mani wrote either seven or eight books, which contained the teachings of the religion. Only scattered fragments and translations of the originals remain.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The original six Syriac writings are not preserved, although their Syriac names have been. There are also fragments and quotations from them. A long quotation, preserved by the eighth-century [[Nestorianism|Nestorian Christian]] author [[Theodore Bar Konai]],&lt;ref name="Konai"&gt;Original Syriac in: Theodorus bar Konai, ''Liber Scholiorum, II'', ed. A. Scher, ''Corpus Scriptorum Christianorum Orientalium scrip. syri'', 1912, pp. 311–8, {{ISBN|978-90-429-0104-9}}; English translation in: A.V.W. Jackson, ''Researches in Manichaeism'', New York, 1932, pp. 222–54.&lt;/ref&gt; shows that in the original Syriac Aramaic writings of Mani there was no influence of Iranian or [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] terms. The terms for the Manichaean deities in the original Syriac writings are in Aramaic. The adaptation of Manichaeism to the Zoroastrian religion appears to have begun in Mani's lifetime however, with his writing of the Middle Persian ''[[Shabuhragan]]'', his book dedicated to the [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian emperor]], [[Shapur I]].&lt;ref name="Shabuhragan"/&gt; In it, there are mentions of Zoroastrian divinities such as [[Ahura Mazda]], [[Angra Mainyu]], and Āz. Manichaeism is often presented as a Persian religion, mostly due to the vast number of Middle Persian, Parthian, and [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] (as well as Turkish) texts discovered by German researchers near [[Turpan]] in what is now [[Xinjiang]], China, during the early 1900s. However, from the vantage point of its original Syriac descriptions (as quoted by Theodore Bar Khonai and outlined above), Manichaeism may be better described as a unique phenomenon of Aramaic Babylonia, occurring in proximity to two other new Aramaic religious phenomena, [[Talmudic Academies in Babylonia|Talmudic Judaism]] and [[Mandaeism]], which also appeared in Babylonia in roughly the third century.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

The original, but now lost, six sacred books of Manichaeism were composed in [[Syriac language|Syriac Aramaic]], and translated into other languages to help spread the religion. As they spread to the east, the Manichaean writings passed through [[Middle Persian]], [[Parthian language|Parthian]], [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]], [[Tocharian languages|Tocharian]], and ultimately [[Uyghur language|Uyghur]] and [[Chinese language|Chinese]] translations. As they spread to the west, they were translated into [[Greek language|Greek]], [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and [[Latin]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

GENERAL SURVEY}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is considered "the only extant Manichean temple in China"&lt;ref&gt;{{Iranica|chinese-turkestan-vii|CHINESE TURKESTAN: vii. Manicheism in Chinese Turkestan and China}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Walter Bruno Henning|Henning]] describes how this translation process evolved and influenced the Manichaeans of Central Asia:
{{quote|Beyond doubt, [[Sogdian language|Sogdian]] was the national language of the Majority of clerics and propagandists of the Manichaean faith in Central Asia. Middle Persian (Pārsīg), and to a lesser degree, Parthian (Pahlavānīg), occupied the position held by [[Medieval Latin|Latin in the medieval church]]. The founder of Manichaeism had employed Syriac (his own language) as his medium, but conveniently he had written at least one book in Middle Persian, and it is likely that he himself had arranged for the translation of some or all of his numerous writings from Syriac into Middle Persian. Thus the Eastern Manichaeans found themselves entitled to dispense with the study of Mani’s original writings, and to continue themselves to reading the Middle Persian edition; it presented small difficulty to them to acquire a good knowledge of the Middle Persian language, owing to its affinity with Sogdian.&lt;ref&gt;W. B. Henning, ''Sogdica'', 1940, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Originally written in Syriac ===
* the ''[[Gospel of Mani]]'' (Syriac: &lt;span lang="syr"&gt;[[wikt:ܐܘܢܓܠܝܘܢ|ܐܘܢܓܠܝܘܢ]]&lt;/span&gt; {{IPA|/ʔɛwwanɡallijon/}}; {{lang-grc-koi|εὐαγγέλιον}} "good news, gospel"). Quotations from the first chapter were brought in [[Arabic]] by [[ibn al-Nadim]], who lived in Baghdad at a time when there were still Manichaeans living there, in his 938 book, the ''Fihrist'', a catalog of all written books known to him.
* ''The Treasure of Life''
* ''The Treatise'' (Coptic: [[wikt:πραγματεία|πραγματεία]])
* ''Secrets''
* ''[[The Book of Giants]]'': Original fragments were discovered at [[Qumran]] (pre-Manichaean) and [[Turpan]].
* Epistles: Augustine brings quotations, in Latin, from Mani's ''[[Fundamental Epistle]]'' in some of his anti-Manichaean works.
* Psalms and prayers. A Coptic [[Manichaean Psalter]], discovered in Egypt in the early 1900s, was edited and published by [[Charles Allberry]] from Manichaean manuscripts in the [[Chester Beatty Papyri|Chester Beatty collection]] and in the Berlin Academy, 1938–9.

=== Originally written in Middle Persian ===
* The ''Shabuhragan'', dedicated to Shapur I: Original Middle Persian fragments were discovered at [[Turpan]], quotations were brought in Arabic by [[al-Biruni]].

=== Other books ===
* The [[Arzhang|Ardahang]], the "Picture Book". In Iranian tradition, this was one of Mani's holy books that became remembered in later Persian history, and was also called Aržang, a [[Parthian language|Parthian]] word meaning "Worthy", and was beautified with paintings. Therefore, Iranians gave him the title of "The Painter".
* The [[Kephalaia of the Teacher]] (Κεφαλαια), "Discourses", found in Coptic translation.
* ''On the Origin of His Body'', the title of the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]], a Greek translation of an Aramaic book that describes the early life of Mani.&lt;ref name="Mani-Kodex"/&gt;

===Non-Manichaean works preserved by the Manichaean Church===
* Portions of the [[Book of Enoch]] literature such as the [[Book of Giants]]
* Literature relating to the [[Thomas the Apostle|apostle Thomas]] (who by tradition went to India, and was also venerated in Syria), such as portions of the Syriac [[Acts of Thomas|The Acts of Thomas]], and the [[Psalms of Thomas]]. The [[Gospel of Thomas]] was also attributed to Manichaeans by Cyril of Jerusalem, a fourth-century Church Father.&lt;ref&gt;''"Let none read the gospel according to Thomas, for it is the work, not of one of the twelve apostles, but of one of [[Mani (prophet)|Mani's]] three wicked disciples."''—[[Cyril of Jerusalem]], ''Cathechesis'' V (4th century)&lt;/ref&gt;
* The legend of [[Barlaam and Josaphat]] passed from an Indian story about the Buddha, through a Manichaean version, before it transformed into the story of a Christian Saint in the west.

===Later works===
[[File:摩尼教文獻.jpg|thumb|摩尼教文獻 The Chinese Manichaean "Compendium"]]
In later centuries, as Manichaeism passed through [[Greater Iran|eastern Persian-speaking lands]] and arrived at the [[Uyghur Khaganate]] (回鶻帝國), and eventually the Uyghur kingdom of [[Turpan]] (destroyed around 1335), Middle Persian and Parthian prayers (''āfrīwan'' or ''āfurišn'') and the Parthian hymn-cycles (the ''Huwīdagmān'' and ''Angad Rōšnan'' created by [[Mar Ammo]]) were added to the Manichaean writings.&lt;ref&gt;See, for example, [[Mary Boyce|Boyce, Mary]] ''The Manichaean hymn-cycles in Parthian'' (London Oriental Series, Vol. 3). London: Oxford University Press, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; A translation of a collection of these produced the ''Manichaean Chinese Hymnscroll'' ({{zh|c=摩尼教下部讚|p=Móní-jiào Xiàbù Zàn}}, which Lieu translates as "Hymns for the Lower Section [i.e. the Hearers] of the Manichaean Religion"&lt;ref&gt;Lieu, Samuel N. C., ''Manichaeism in Central Asia and China'', 1998, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition to containing hymns attributed to Mani, it contains prayers attributed to Mani's earliest disciples, including Mār Zaku, Mār Ammo and Mār Sīsin. Another Chinese work is a complete translation of the ''Sermon of the Light [[Nous]]'', presented as a discussion between Mani and his disciple Adda.&lt;ref&gt;"The Traité is, despite its title (Moni jiao cao jing, lit. "fragmentary [Mathews, no. 6689] Manichean scripture"), a long text in an excellent state of preservation, with only a few lines missing at the beginning. It was first fully published with a facsimile by [[Édouard Chavannes|Edouard Chavannes]] (q.v.) and [[Paul Pelliot]] in 1911 and is frequently known as Traité Pelliot. Their transcription (including typographical errors) was reproduced in the Chinese translation of the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka|Buddhist Tripiṭaka]] (Taishō, no. 2141 B, LIV, pp. 1281a16-1286a29); that text was in turn reproduced with critical notes by Helwig Schmidt-Glintzer (1987b, pp. T. 81–86). A more accurate transcription was published by Chen Yuan in 1923 (pp. 531–44), and a new collation based on a reexamination of the original photographs of the manuscript has now been published by Lin Wu-shu (1987, pp. 217–29), with the photographs", {{iranica|chinese-turkestan-vii|CHINESE TURKESTAN vii. Manicheism in Chinese Turkestan and China}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical and polemic sources===
Until discoveries in the 1900s of original sources, the only sources for Manichaeism were descriptions and quotations from non-Manichaean authors, either Christian, Muslim, Buddhist, or Zoroastrian. While often criticizing Manichaeism, they also quoted directly from Manichaean scriptures. This enabled [[Isaac de Beausobre]], writing in the 18th century, to create a comprehensive work on Manichaeism, relying solely on anti-Manichaean sources.&lt;ref&gt;[[Isaac de Beausobre|de Beausobre, Isaac]], ''Histoire critique de Manichée et du Manichéisme'', 1734–1739, Amsterdam.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus quotations and descriptions in Greek and Arabic have long been known to scholars, as have the long quotations in Latin by Saint Augustine, and the extremely important quotation in Syriac by [[Theodore Bar Konai]].{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

====Patristic depictions of Mani and Manichæeism====
[[Eusebius]] commented as follows:
{{quotation|''The error of the Manichees, which commenced at this time.''|In the mean time, also, that madman Manes, (Mani is of Persian or Semitic origin) as he was called, well agreeing with his name, for his demoniacal heresy, armed himself by the perversion of his reason, and at the instruction of Satan, to the destruction of many. He was a barbarian in his life, both in speech and conduct, but in his nature as one possessed and insane. Accordingly, he attempted to form himself into a Christ, and then also proclaimed himself to be the very paraclete and the Holy Spirit, and with all this was greatly puffed up with his madness. Then, as if he were Christ, he selected twelve disciples, the partners of his new religion, and after patching together false and ungodly doctrines, collected from a thousand heresies long since extinct, he swept them off like a deadly poison, from Persia, upon this part of the world. Hence the impious name of the Manichaeans spreading among many, even to the present day. Such then was the occasion of this knowledge, as it was falsely called, that sprouted up in these times.&lt;ref&gt;Eusebius. ''The Ecclesiastical History of Eusebius Pamphilus, Bishop of Caesarea'', Translated from the originals by Christian Frederick Cruse.1939. Ch. XXXI.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Acta Archelai====
An example of how inaccurate some of these accounts could be is seen in the account of the origins of Manichaeism contained in the ''Acta Archelai''. This was a Greek anti-manichaean work written before 348, most well known in its Latin version, which was regarded as an accurate account of Manichaeism until refuted by Isaac de Beausobre in the 18th century:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the time of the Apostles there lived a man named [[Scythianus]], who is described as coming "from Scythia", and also as being "a Saracen by race" ("ex genere Saracenorum"). He settled in Egypt, where he became acquainted with "the wisdom of the Egyptians", and invented the religious system that was afterwards known as Manichaeism. Finally he emigrated to Palestine, and, when he died, his writings passed into the hands of his sole disciple, a certain [[Terebinthus]]. The latter betook himself to Babylonia, assumed the name of Budda, and endeavoured to propagate his master's teaching. But he, like Scythianus, gained only one disciple, who was an old woman. After a while he died, in consequence of a fall from the roof of a house, and the books that he had inherited from Scythianus became the property of the old woman, who, on her death, bequeathed them to a young man named Corbicius, who had been her slave. Corbicius thereupon changed his name to Manes, studied the writings of Scythianus, and began to teach the doctrines that they contained, with many additions of his own. He gained three disciples, named Thomas, Addas, and Hermas. About this time the son of the Persian king fell ill, and Manes undertook to cure him; the prince, however, died, whereupon Manes was thrown into prison. He succeeded in escaping, but eventually fell into the hands of the king, by whose order he was flayed, and his corpse was hung up at the city gate.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A. A. Bevan, who quoted this story, commented that it "has no claim to be considered historical".&lt;ref&gt;Bevan, A. A. (1930). "Manichaeism". ''Encyclopaedia of Religion and Ethics'', Volume VIII. Ed. [[James Hastings]]. London.&lt;/ref&gt;

=====View of Judaism in the ''Acta Archelai''=====
According to [[Hegemonius]]' portrayal of Mani, the [[Demiurge#Gnosticism|evil demiurge]] who created the world was the Jewish [[Jehovah]]. Hegemonius reports that Mani said,
{{quote|"It is the [[Prince of darkness (Manichaeism)|Prince of Darkness]] who spoke with [[Moses]], the [[Jews]] and their [[kohen|priests]]. Thus the [[Christian]]s, the Jews, and the Pagans are involved in the same error when they worship this God. For he leads them astray in the lusts he taught them." He goes on to state: "Now, he who spoke with Moses, the Jews, and the priests he says is the [[archon]]t of Darkness, and the Christians, Jews, and pagans (ethnic) are one and the same, as they revere the same god. For in his aspirations he seduces them, as he is not the god of truth. And so therefore all those who put their hope in the god who spoke with Moses and the prophets have (this in store for themselves, namely) to be bound with him, because they did not put their hope in the god of truth. For that one spoke with them (only) according to their own aspirations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Classical Texts: Acta Archelai of Mani |url=http://www.fas.harvard.edu/~iranian/Manicheism/Manicheism_II_Texts.pdf |format=PDF |page=76 |publisher=Iranian Studies at Harvard University}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Central Asian and Iranian primary sources===
In the early 1900s, original Manichaean writings started to come to light when German scholars led by [[Albert Grünwedel]], and then by [[Albert von Le Coq]], began excavating at [[Gaochang]], the ancient site of the Manichaean Uyghur Kingdom near Turpan, in Chinese Turkestan (destroyed around AD 1300). While most of the writings they uncovered were in very poor condition, there were still hundreds of pages of Manichaean scriptures, written in three Iranian languages (Middle Persian, Parthian, and Sogdian) and old Uyghur. These writings were taken back to Germany, and were analyzed and published at the [[Prussian Academy of Sciences|Preußische Akademie der Wissenschaften]] in Berlin, by Le Coq and others, such as [[Friedrich W. K. Müller]] and [[Walter Bruno Henning]]. While the vast majority of these writings were written in a version of the Syriac script known as [[Manichaean script]], the German researchers, perhaps for lack of suitable fonts, published most of them using the [[Hebrew alphabet]] (which could easily be substituted for the 22 Syriac letters).{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Perhaps the most comprehensive of these publications was ''Manichaeische Dogmatik aus chinesischen und iranischen Texten'' (''Manichaean Dogma from Chinese and Iranian texts''), by [[Ernst Waldschmidt]] and Wolfgang Lentz, published in Berlin in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ernst Waldschmidt|Waldschmidt, E.]], and Lentz, W., ''Manichäische Dogmatik aus chinesischen und iranischen Texten'' (SPAW 1933, No. 13)&lt;/ref&gt; More than any other research work published before or since, this work printed, and then discussed, the original key Manichaean texts in the original scripts, and consists chiefly of sections from Chinese texts, and Middle Persian and Parthian texts transcribed with the Hebrew alphabet. After the Nazi party gained power in Germany, the Manichaean writings continued to be published during the 1930s, but the publishers no longer used Hebrew letters, instead transliterating the texts into Latin letters.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Coptic primary sources===
Additionally, in 1930, German researchers in Egypt found a large body of Manichaean works in Coptic. Though these were also damaged, hundreds of complete pages survived and, beginning in 1933, were analyzed and published in Berlin before World War II, by German scholars such as [[Hans Jakob Polotsky]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Jakob Polotsky]] and Karl Schmidt, ''Ein Mani-Fund in Ägypten, Original-Schriften des Mani und seiner Schüler''. Berlin: Akademie der Wissenschaften 1933.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these Coptic Manichaean writings were lost during the war.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Chinese primary sources===
After the success of the German researchers, French scholars visited China and discovered what is perhaps the most complete set of Manichaean writings, written in Chinese. These three Chinese writings, all found at the [[Mogao Caves]] among the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], and all written before the 9th century, are today kept in London, Paris, and Beijing. Some of the scholars involved with their initial discovery and publication were [[Édouard Chavannes]], [[Paul Pelliot]], and [[Aurel Stein]]. The original studies and analyses of these writings, along with their translations, first appeared in French, English, and German, before and after World War II. The complete Chinese texts themselves were first published in Tokyo, Japan in 1927, in the [[Taishō Tripiṭaka]], volume 54. While in the last thirty years or so they have been republished in both Germany (with a complete translation into German, alongside the 1927 Japanese edition),&lt;ref&gt;Schmidt-Glintzer, Helwig, ''Chinesische Manichaeica'', Wiesbaden, 1987&lt;/ref&gt; and China, the Japanese publication remains the standard reference for the Chinese texts.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}

===Greek life of Mani, Cologne codex===
[[File:Kölner Mani-Kodex.jpg|thumb|right|Cologne Mani-Codex]]
In Egypt, a small [[codex]] was found and became known through antique dealers in [[Cairo]]. It was purchased by the [[University of Cologne]] in 1969. Two of its scientists, Henrichs and Koenen, produced the first edition known since as the [[Cologne Mani-Codex]], which was published in four articles in the ''Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik''. The ancient [[papyrus]] manuscript contained a [[Greek language|Greek]] text describing the life of Mani. Thanks to this discovery, much more is known about the man who founded one of the most influential world religions of the past.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/cologne-mani-codex-parchment |title= Cologne Mani Codex |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia Iranica |date= |year= |publisher= |location= |id= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Figurative use ==
The terms "Manichaean" and "Manichaeism" are sometimes used figuratively as a synonym of the more general term "[[Dualistic cosmology|dualist]]" with respect to a philosophy, outlook or worldview.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/Manichaean|title=Manichaean - definition of Manichaean in English from the Oxford dictionary|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms are often used to suggest that the world view in question simplistically reduces the world to a struggle between good and evil. For example, [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]] used the phrase "Manichaean paranoia" in reference to [[POTUS|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]]'s world view (in ''[[The Daily Show with Jon Stewart]]'', March 14, 2007); Brzezinski elaborated that he meant "the notion that he [Bush] is leading the forces of good against the empire of evil". Philosopher [[Frantz Fanon]] frequently invoked the concept of Manicheanism in his discussions of violence between colonizers and the colonized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/fanon/|title=Frantz Fanon|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author and journalist [[Glenn Greenwald]] followed up on the theme in describing Bush in his book ''[[A Tragic Legacy]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://launiusr.wordpress.com/2017/06/28/notes-on-an-important-book-glenn-greenwalds-a-tragic-legacy-how-a-good-vs-evil-mentality-destroyed-the-bush-presidency/|title=Wednesday’s Book Review: “A Tragic Legacy: How a Good vs. Evil Mentality Destroyed the Bush Presidency”|date=2017-06-28|work=Roger Launius's Blog|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the story "[[Memoirs of Hecate County|The Man Who Shot Snapping Turtles]]" (published in ''Memoirs of Hecate County''), [[Edmund Wilson]]'s narrator refers to Asa Stryker's argument as "the Manichaean heresy".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.nytimes.com/www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/23/home/wilson-hecate2.html|title=Home|website=archive.nytimes.com|access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In "[[My Secret History]]", author [[Paul Theroux]]'s protagonist defines the word Manichaean for the protagonist's son. Prior to explaning the word to his son, the protagonist mentions [[Joseph Conrad|Joseph Conrad's]] short story [[The Secret Sharer]] at least twice in the book, the plot of which also examines the idea of the duality of good and evil.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1813">'''Mesosociology''' is the study of intermediate (''meso'') social forces and [[social stratification|stratification]] such as [[income]], [[Ageing|age]], [[gender]], [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]], [[ethnicity]], [[social organization|organization]]s and geographically circumscribed [[community|communities]]. 

Mesosociology lies between analysis of large-scale macro forces such as the [[economy]] or human [[society|societies]] (which is a domain of [[macrosociology]]), and everyday human [[social interaction]]s on a small scale (a domain of [[microsociology]]).

==Social control==
Meso-level forces of [[social control]] include organizations and communities. The organizations are middle level structures of control. One type is a total institution, which is an organization in which people are confined until they can adhere to society's norms, including prisons and mental hospitals. Another type of middle level organization is the reintegration structure. This structure rehabilitates those who do not conform. These include rehabilitation centers for drugs and alcohol. A final type of organization is a [[safety-valve organization]]. These provide outlets for behavior that is considered deviant, but cannot be eradicated from society, including prostitution. Communities also are instruments of social control. Things that are controlled by local governments are often the most visible signs of social control in a community, such as a police force and the organization of neighborhoods.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}}

'''Michael A. Persinger''' (June 26, 1945 – August 14, 2018) was an American-Canadian [[professor]] of psychology at [[Laurentian University]], a position he had held from 1971 until his death in 2018.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His most well-known hypotheses include the temporal lobes as the central correlate for [[Mysticism|mystical]] experiences, subtle changes in [[geomagnetic]] activity as mediators of [[Parapsychology|parapsychological]] phenomena, the tectonic strain within the Earth's crust as the source of [[Ball lightning|luminous phenomena]] attributed to [[Unidentified flying object|unidentified aerial objects]], and the importance of specific quantifications for energy (10&lt;sup&gt;−20&lt;/sup&gt; Joules), photon flux density (picoWatt per meter squared), and small shifts in magnetic field intensities (picoTesla to nanoTesla range) for integrating cellular activity as well as human [[thought]] with universal phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Neuropsychological bases of God beliefs|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|publisher=Prager Publishers|year=1987|isbn=978-0275926489|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=Fall 2001|title=The Neuropsychiatry of Paranormal Experiences|url=https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/4857/87022759ddf1dca6c2411937a3f9889115e2.pdf|journal=Neuropsychiatric Practice and Opinion|volume=13:4|pages=515–524|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=1983|title=Religious and Mystical Experiences as Artifacts of Temporal Lobe Function: A General Hypothesis|journal=Perceptual and Motor Skills|volume=57|issue=3_suppl|pages=1255–1262|doi=10.2466/pms.1983.57.3f.1255|pmid=6664802}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=Summer 2010|title=10-20 Joules as a Neuromolecular Quantum in Medicinal Chemistry: An Alternative Approach to Myriad Molecular Pathways?|url=http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/ben/cmc/2010/00000017/00000027/art00009|journal=Current Medicinal Chemistry|volume=17|issue=27|pages=3094–3098|doi=10.2174/092986710791959701|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=2015|title=Inverse relationship between photon flux densities and nanotesla magnetic fields over cell aggregates: Quantitative evidence for energetic conservation|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211546315000455|journal=FEBS Open Bio|volume=5|pages=413–418|doi=10.1016/j.fob.2015.04.015|pmid=26005634|pmc=4436372|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=December 2008|title=Quantitative discrepancy in cerebral hemispheric temperature associated with "two consciousnesses" is predicted by neuroquantum relations|url=|journal=NeuroQuantology|volume=6|pages=369–378|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=2007|title=A theory of neurophysics ad quantum neuroscience: implications for brain function and the limits of consciousness|url=|journal=Intern.

Persinger attended [[Carroll College (Wisconsin)|Carroll College]] from 1963 to 1964 and graduated from the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] in 1967. He received his [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in [[physiological psychology]] from the [[University of Tennessee]] in 1969 and his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] from the [[University of Manitoba]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Research and academic work==
Persinger's work focuses on the commonalities that exist between the sciences, and aims to integrate fundamental concepts of various branches of science.&lt;ref name="SpaceTimeObs"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Persinger |first1 = M.

Persinger has stated that he studies parapsychological phenomena because "the ultimate subject matter of science is the unknown".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He believes that verifiable spontaneous and experimental types of parapsychological phenomena are physical and associated with non-local interactions between human brain activity and geophysical processes.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; For example, Persinger has presented evidence that the moderate strength correlation between geomagnetic activity at the time of a [[Precognition|precognitive]] experience and what the geomagnetic activity would be two to three days before the event was considered supportive evidence that energetic antecedents before the event,  not the event itself, was being discerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=1988|title=Increased geomagnetic activity and the occurrence of bereavement hallucinations: Evidence for melatonin-mediated microseizuring in the temporal lobe?|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0304394088902224|journal=Neuroscience Letters|volume=88|issue=3|pages=271–274|via=|doi=10.1016/0304-3940(88)90222-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Review of the physical properties with [[William G.

=== Physical cosmology ===
Later in his career, Persinger and his lifelong colleague Stanley Koren quantitatively, through calculations, explored the non-traditional relationships between the smallest and largest increments of space and time.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=2014|title=Evidence for a Causal Relationship Between Mach's Principle and the Quantitative Latency for Universal Entanglement|url=http://yadda.icm.edu.pl/yadda/element/bwmeta1.element.baztech-7e1025e3-3f45-4f2f-a208-b189a89da574|journal=International Letters of Chemistry, Physics and Astronomy|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael|date=May 2016|title=Inflections of periodicities of background photon spectral power densities are predicted by the lorentz contraction for a potential indicator for the intrinsic structure of space|url=|journal=Journal of Advances in Physics|volume=|pages=4014–4017|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, the time required for the universe to expand one [[Planck length|Planck's length]] was [[Planck time|Planck's time]], and the time for Planck's length to expand one Planck's length was [[Age of the universe|the age of the universe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Persinger|first=Michael A.|date=2007|title=A THEORY OF NEUROPHYSICS AND QUANTUM NEUROSCIENCE: IMPLICATIONS FOR BRAIN FUNCTION AND THE LIMITS OF CONSCIOUSNESS|journal=International Journal of Neuroscience|volume=117|issue=2|pages=157–175|doi=10.1080/00207450500535784|pmid=17365106}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This duration for a [[proton]] was about 3 ms, which considered the optimal point duration for interactive magnetic fields.

== Free speech ==
In 2016, Persinger was controversially removed as the instructor of a first-year psychology course.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/sudbury/persinger-psychology-class-1.3389410|title=Free speech or foul play?

The Laurentian University Faculty Association filed a [[grievance]] against the school for violating Persinger's [[academic freedom]].

'''Millsaps College''' is a private [[Liberal arts colleges in the United States|liberal arts college]] located in [[Jackson, Mississippi]], the state capital. Founded in 1890 and affiliated with the [[United Methodist Church]], Millsaps is home to 985 students. One of 40 colleges featured in Loren Pope's ''Colleges That Change Lives,'' it is one of only 21 private colleges nationwide named a ''Best Buy'' in the 2013 ''Fiske Guide to Colleges''.

==History==
The college was founded in 1889–90 by a [[Confederate States of America|Confederate]] veteran, Major [[Reuben Webster Millsaps]], who donated the land for the college and $50,000. Dr. [[William Belton Murrah]] was the college's first president, and Bishop [[Charles Betts Galloway]] of the [[Methodist Episcopal Church South]] organized the college's early fund-raising efforts. Both men were honored with halls named in their honor. Major Millsaps and his wife are interred in a tomb near the center of campus. The current United Methodist Church continues to have affiliations with the college.

==Academics==
Despite its religious affiliation, the curriculum is secular.  The writing-intensive core curriculum requires each student to compile an acceptable portfolio of written work before completion of the sophomore year.  Candidates for an undergraduate degree must also pass oral and written [[Comprehensive examination|comprehensive exams]] in their major field of study.  These exams last up to three hours, and may cover any required or elective course offered by the major department.  Unacceptable performance on comprehensive exams will prevent a candidate from receiving a degree, even if all course work has been completed.  "Comps" are usually associated with graduate degree requirements, so their inclusion at the undergraduate level is a source of pride (and possibly pressure) for Millsaps students. {{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Millsaps offers [[Bachelor of Science|B.S.]], [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], [[Bachelor of Business Administration|B.B.A.]], [[Master of Business Administration|M.B.A.]] and [[Master of Accountancy|MAcc]] degrees and corresponding programs.

The current undergraduate population is 910 students on a 103 [[acre]] (417,000 m²) campus near downtown [[Jackson, Mississippi]]. The student to faculty ratio is 1:9 with an average class size around 15 students. Millsaps offers 32 majors and 41 minors, including the option of a self-designed major, along with a multitude of study abroad and internship opportunities. Millsaps employs 97 full-time faculty members. Of those, 94 percent of tenure-track faculty hold a Ph.D. or the terminal degree in their field. The professors on the [[tenure]] track have the highest degree in their field.{{Citation needed|date=February 2012}}   The college offers research partnerships for undergraduate students, and a variety of study abroad programs.  Millsaps reports that 57% of their student body comes from outside Mississippi; a large portion of out-of-state students are from neighboring [[Louisiana]]. Millsaps is home to 910 undergraduate, 75 graduate students from 26 states and territories plus 23 countries. The college also offers a [[Continuing Education]] program and the Community Enrichment Series for adults in the Jackson area.

==Campus==
[[File:Millsaps College.jpg|thumb|left|Millsaps College campus.]]
The Millsaps campus is close to downtown Jackson. It is bordered by Woodrow Wilson Avenue to the north, North State Street to the east, West Street to the west, and Marshall Street to the south.

The center of campus is dominated by "The Bowl," where many events occur, including Homecoming activities, concerts, the Multicultural Festival, and Commencement.  Adjacent to the Bowl is the Campbell College Center, renovated in 2000, which contains the campus bookstore, post office, cafeteria, and Student Life offices.  This central section of campus also holds the Gertrude C. Ford Academic Complex, Olin Science Hall, Sullivan-Harrell Hall, and the Millsaps-Wilson Library.

The north part of campus includes the Hall Activities Center (commonly called "the HAC"), the sports fields, and the freshman dormitories. On the far northwestern corner is James Observatory, the oldest building on campus. Operational since 1901, the observatory underwent major renovations in 1980. It is open for celestial gazing.

Upperclassmen dormitories are located on the south side of campus, with Fraternity Row and the Christian Center. Originally constructed as a memorial to students and graduates who died in service during World War II, the Christian Center houses an auditorium and the departments of Performing Arts, History and Religious Studies.

Between the Christian Center and Murrah Hall, which houses the Else School of Management, is the tomb of Major Millsaps and the "M" Bench, erected by the classes of 1926, 1927, and 1928. The Nicholson Garden was added to improve the aesthetics of this area.

==Rankings and distinctions==
Millsaps was ranked 90 out of 251 national liberal arts colleges in the [[U.S. News &amp; World Report]] of America's Best Colleges Issue; top ranked liberal arts college in Mississippi, Louisiana, and Alabama; also, named to the list of "High School Counselors' Picks" for 2011 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com/best-colleges/millsaps-college-2414 |title=Millsaps College &amp;#124; Best College &amp;#124; US News |publisher=Colleges.usnews.rankingsandreviews.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps College professors are ranked among the best in the nation, according to The [[Princeton Review]]'s The Best 377 Colleges - 2013 Edition. The Millsaps faculty won praise in The Princeton Review's special Top 20 category:  Professors Get High Marks, where Millsaps was ranked twelfth in the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/college-rankings.aspx |title=College Rankings |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Princeton Review]] also named the Else School of Management at Millsaps College one of the Best Business Schools in the Southeast in the 2011 edition of its book, ''The Best 300 Business Schools''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princetonreview.com/business-school-rankings.aspx |title=Business School Rankings |publisher=Princetonreview.com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps is one of 40 schools in [[Loren Pope]]'s ''[[Colleges That Change Lives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctcl.org/ |title=Colleges That Change Lives &amp;#124; Changing Lives. One Student at a Time |publisher=Ctcl.org |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Millsaps is among 21 private universities and colleges nationwide named a "best buy" in the ''[[Fiske Guide to Colleges]] 2013''. Millsaps is the only institution in Mississippi to earn the "best buy" honor from the annual guide. The guide names Millsaps as "the strongest liberal arts college in the deep, Deep South and by far the most progressive" and notes that what differentiates the school is "its focus on scholarly inquiry, spiritual growth, and community service, along with its Heritage Program, an interdisciplinary approach to world culture."

Millsaps leads the list of 13 [[United Methodist]]–related colleges named among the top 100 liberal arts colleges by the 2012 [[Washington Monthly]] College Guide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012/liberal_arts_rank.php |title=Liberal Arts College Rankings 2012 |publisher=Washington Monthly |date= |accessdate=2014-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115154936/http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/college_guide/rankings_2012/liberal_arts_rank.php |archivedate=2013-01-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Athletics==
{{main|Millsaps Majors}}

The school's sports teams [[List of U.S. college team nicknames|are known as]] the Majors, and their colors are purple and white. They participate in the [[NCAA Division III]] and the [[Southern Athletic Association]].

Men's sports include: baseball, basketball, cheerleading, cross country, football, golf, lacrosse, soccer, tennis, and track and field,and the addition of a 2019-2020 swim team. Women's sports include basketball, cheerleading, cross country, dance team, golf, lacrosse, soccer, softball, tennis, track and field, and volleyball,and the addition of a 2019-2020 swim team.

The Majors had a fierce football and basketball rivalry with [[Mississippi College]] in nearby [[Clinton, Mississippi|Clinton]] through the 1950s before competition was suspended after an infamous student brawl at a basketball game.  Campus legend says the brawl was sparked by the alleged theft of the body of Millsaps founder Major Millsaps by Mississippi College students.  The rivalry was considered by many as the best in Mississippi, featuring a prank by Mississippi College students who painted "TO HELL WITH MILSAPS" (sic) on the Millsaps Observatory.  The football rivalry resumed in 2000 as the "Backyard Brawl", with games at [[Mississippi Veterans Memorial Stadium]].  The rivalry took a one-year hiatus in 2005 but resumed in 2006.

Millsaps was the summer training camp home for the [[National Football League|NFL's]] [[New Orleans Saints]] in 2006, 2007, and 2008.

Millsaps was also home to the famous game-ending play in the [[2007 Trinity vs. Millsaps football game]], in which [[Trinity University (Texas)|Trinity University]] executed 15 laterals on the way to a touchdown, defeating Millsaps by a score of 28-24.  The play later won the Pontiac Game-Changing Performance of the Year award, which had never before been bestowed upon a play outside of the [[NCAA]]'s [[NCAA#Football Bowl Subdivision|Bowl Subdivision]].

In 2008, Millsaps quarterback [[Juan Joseph]] was awarded the [[Conerly Trophy]], which goes to the best football player in the state of [[Mississippi]].

==Greek organizations==
The school is home to five different [[fraternities and sororities|fraternities]]: [[Kappa Alpha Order]], [[Sigma Alpha Epsilon]], [[Pi Kappa Alpha]], [[Lambda Chi Alpha]], and [[Kappa Sigma]]; as well as five [[fraternities and sororities|sororities]]: [[Delta Delta Delta]], [[Kappa Delta]], [[Phi Mu]], [[Chi Omega]], and [[Alpha Kappa Alpha]].

==Navy V-12 program==
Nearly 53 years after founding the college, Millsaps was chosen as one of 131 sites for the training of [[United States Navy|Navy]] and [[U.S. Marines|Marine]] officers in the [[V-12 Navy College Training Program]].

In April 1943, 380 students arrived for the Navy V-12 program. It offered [[engineering]], pre-[[Medicine|medical]] and pre-[[Dentistry|dental]]. Thereafter Millsaps began accepting students year-round for the program. A total of 873 officer candidates went through Millsaps between 1943 and 1945.

Traces of the Navy V-12 unit appear in the ''Bobashela'' (school [[yearbook]]) in 1944. That year, the ''Bobashela'' staff decided to dedicate the yearbook to the unit and Dr. Sanders, one of the unit's advisers. One section memorialized students who had been killed in action.

{{sociology}}
[[File:JHHammond.jpg|thumb|right|[[James Henry Hammond]] coined the "Mudsill Theory"]]

'''Mudsill theory''' is a sociological term indicating the proposition that there must be, and always has been, a [[Underclass|lower class]] for the [[upper classes]] to rest upon. The term derives from a [[mudsill]], the lowest threshold that supports the [[Foundation (architecture)|foundation]] for a building.

The theory was first used by South Carolina [[United States Senate|Senator]]/[[Governor of South Carolina|Governor]] [[James Henry Hammond]], a wealthy [[Plantation era|southern plantation]] owner, in a [[United States Senate|Senate]] speech on March 4, 1858,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/aia/part4/4h3439t.html Africans in America/Part 4/Mudsill Theory&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; to justify what he saw as the willingness of the [[lower classes]] and the duty of non-whites to perform menial work which enabled the [[upper classes|higher classes]] to move civilization forward. Efforts to reduce [[Social class|class]] or [[racial inequality]], under this theory, inevitably run counter to civilization itself.

Many saw the argument as a weak justification for [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]], and a flimsy example of creating your own [[science]] to reference as [[Logical argument|proof]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Richard Hofstadter|Hofstadter, Richard]]. The American Political Tradition &amp; the Men Who Made It. New York, NY: Knopf, 1974. 86-117.&lt;/ref&gt; An obvious flaw lies in that there are no indications as to which class or race rightfully belongs to the mudsill other than the pre-supposed regional groups that were already in place at the "bottom", thus causing a [[circular argument]].

It was directly used to advocate [[slavery]] in the [[rhetoric]] of others [[Origins of the American Civil War|pre-Civil War]] [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]], that were struggling to maintain their grip on the [[Southern United States|Southern]] economy. They saw the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolition of slavery]] as a threat to their powerful new Southern market that revolved almost entirely around the [[Plantation economy|plantation system]] which was furthered by the use of primarily [[Native ethnic groups of Africa|African]] slaves, but also utilized destitute [[Caucasian race|whites]].

These and other colloquialisms were used as rhetoric in what has been dubbed "the [[Marxism]] of the [[Slaveholder|Master-Class]]"&lt;ref&gt;Hofstadter, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; which fought for the rights of the propertied elite against what were perceived as threats from the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionists]], lower classes and non-whites to gain higher standards of living.

[[Abraham Lincoln]] argued forcefully against the mudsill theory, particularly [[s:Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society|in a speech]] in [[Milwaukee, Wisconsin]], in 1859,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abrahamlincolnonline.org/lincoln/speeches/fair.htm  "Address before the Wisconsin State Agricultural Society," Milwaukee, Wisconsin, September 30, 1859]&lt;/ref&gt; where he delineated its incompatibility with [[Free Soil]]. In his view, mudsill advocates "conclude that all laborers are necessarily either hired laborers, or slaves", since to them, "nobody labors unless somebody else, owning capital... induces him to do it". Further, mudsillers believed that these laborers were "fatally fixed" in their status. Lincoln contrasted his view that labor was in fact the source of capital, noting that a majority of persons in [[Free state (United States)|Free States]] were "neither hirers nor hired", but in such professions as farming where they worked for themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Northern soldiers fighting in the [[Western Theater]] of the Civil War turned this derogatory term into one of self pride, as in "Western Mudsill".

In [[sociology]], '''nomos''' refers to provisional codes (habits or customs) of social and political behavior, socially constructed and historically (even geographically) specific. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jarratt|first=Susan Carole Funderburgh|title=Rereading the Sophists: Classical Rhetoric Refigured|year=1991|publisher=Southern Illinois UP|location=Carbondale}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term derives from the Greek νόμος, and it refers not only to explicit laws but to all of the normal rules and forms people take for granted in their day-to-day activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hayek|first=Friedrich|authorlink=Friedrich Hayek|title=Law, Legislation and Liberty|year=1982|publisher=Routledge |isbn=9780415522298|pages=90–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nomos stands for order, valid and binding on those who fall under its jurisdiction; thus it is a social construct with ethical dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ostwald|first=Martin|title=Nomos and the Beginnings of the Athenian Democracy|year=1969|publisher=Oxford UP|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a belief, opinion or point of view; it is a human invention.

== History of the term ==

[[Carl Schmitt]] began using the term in his 1934 publication "On the Three Types of Juristic Thought"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schmitt|first=Carl|others=trans Joseph Bendersky|title=On the Three Types of Juristic Thought |year=2004|publisher=Praeger|pages=49–57}}&lt;/ref&gt; to denote the "concrete order" of a people,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mehring|first=Reinhard|title=Carl Schmitt: A Biography|year=2014|publisher=Polity|isbn=9780745652245|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt; before extending its use into his 1950 book "The Nomos of the Earth in the International Law of the Jus Publicum Europaeum".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/schmitt/#LibCosFouIntOrd|title=Carl Schmitt|last=Vinx|first=Lars|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=31 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bergerian nomos ===

After Schmitt, the next influential writer to use the term in a modern context is [[Peter L. Berger]]. Berger writes of human beings fashioning a world by their own activity (1967:5). Berger sees this taking place through a continual threefold cycle between individuals and society: externalisation, objectivation and internalization. The world thus fashioned has an order&amp;mdash;a set of principles&amp;mdash;which comes to be read onto society by individuals through externalisation and objectivation, and also internalised in each individual. This order thus comes to be assumed, spoken of, and placed into social discourse to be treated as common sense. This ordering of the world and experience, which is a corporate and social process as well as an individual one, is a nomos.

Berger writes of 'The socially established nomos' being understood 'as a shield against terror. Put differently, the most important function of society is nomization.' (1967:22). We all need that structuring nomos; it provides us with stability, predictability, a frame of reference in which to live. The alternative is the chaos and terror of what Berger calls anomy.

To be most effective, the nomos must be taken for granted. The structure of the world created by human and social activity is treated not as contingent, but as self-evident. 'Whenever the socially established nomos attains the quality of being taken for granted, there occurs a merging of its meanings with what are considered to be the fundamental meanings inherent in the universe.' (1967:24-25). Berger sees this happening in all societies, and while the nomos is expressed in religious terms in 'archaic societies', 'In contemporary society, this archaic cosmization of the social world is likely to take the form of "scientific" propositions about the nature of men rather than the nature of the universe.' (1967:25).

So this process of world-construction is not necessarily religious, but its expression has most often been religious. Later Berger explores the part religious belief has played in nomoi: providing a connection with the cosmic—seeking to provide a completeness to that religious world-view.

'Every human society is an edifice of externalized and objectivated meanings, always intending a meaningful totality. Every society is engaged in the never completed enterprise of building a humanly meaningful world. Cosmization implies the identification of this humanly meaningful world with the world as such, the former now being grounded in the latter, reflecting it or being derived from it in its fundamental structures. Such a cosmos, as the ultimate ground and validation of human nomoi, need not necessarily be sacred. Particularly in modern times there have been thoroughly secular attempts at cosmization, among which modern science is by far the most important. It is safe to say, however, that originally all cosmization had a sacred character.' (1967:27).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berger|first1=Peter|title=The Sacred Canopy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coverian nomos===

The next landmark in the use of the term is generally thought to be by [[Robert Cover]], who argued in his influential 1982 paper [http://digitalcommons.law.yale.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=3690&amp;context=fss_papers Nomos and Narrative] that while the mechanisms of law and social control are part of law, that students of the law, and legal actors, should instead focus on the [[Norm (sociology)|normative]] universe, the whole of the means of social control. As with Berger, Cover rooted the nomos in "narrative", or what a post-structuralist would call [[meta-narrative]]. Cover argued that no set of legal institutions exists apart from the narratives that locate it and give it meaning.

He says this because he argues that our moral sense is composed of the narratives from which we draw conclusions, and by which we locate ourselves in relation to other people. He argues that because narrative is morality, the normative universe must rest on narrative. Since we also construct our view of the universe physically from narrative, he argues that the normative universe is as much a part of our existence as the physical universe.

Cover then makes an argument of incorporation: he states that just as we develop increasingly complex responses to the physical world, so too is our development of responses to "[[Other (philosophy)|otherness]]" conditioned over time by interaction. From this he argues that societies that have great legal systems rest on more than formal and technical virtuosity, but in the richness of their understanding of the normative universe.

Cover argues that the explicit relationship between formal apparatus of a society, in this case a legal society, and the normative range of behavior is the fulcrum to understanding whether the society is functional or not.

Cover's use of the term is rooted in Berger's argument that nomos requires mythology and narrative, as pillars for the understanding of the meaning of each act within a particular nomos.

A '''nutrition scale''' is a weighing instrument that outputs precise nutritional information for foods or liquids. Most scales calculate [[calories]], [[carbohydrates]], and [[fat]]s, with more sophisticated scales calculating additional nutrients such as [[Vitamin K]], [[potassium]], [[magnesium]], and [[sodium]].

Scales often use [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] information on food to ensure accuracy. The products are used primarily as a weight-management tool but have found a user base with [[Diabetes|diabetics]] and [[Hypertension|hypertensive]] people.

'''Peace Mala''' ('''The Peace Mala Project for World Peace'''), is an organisation based in [[Morriston]] in [[Swansea]], [[Wales]] dedicated to fostering inter-cultural and inter-faith tolerance through the manufacture, distribution and wearing of a symbolic [[Japa mala|mala]] (bracelet) whose beads represent various faiths.

The organisation's stated aims are "promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/ From the 'Main aims of Peace Mala']&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Peace Mala bracelet==
A Peace Mala is a symbolic bracelet used to promote the message of the [[Ethic of reciprocity|Golden Rule]] of mutual respect recognised by many spiritual paths. It consists of 16 beads, forming a double rainbow, which represent Christianity, [[Buddhism]], [[Sikhism]], [[Islam]], [[Judaism]], [[Bahá'í Faith|Bahá'í]], [[International Society for Krishna Consciousness|ISKCON]], [[Zoroastrianism]], [[Folk religion|Tribal and Native Religions]], [[Jainism]], [[Earth religion]]s, [[Taoism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Bön#Yungdrung Bön|Yungdrung Bön]]. The central white bead represents the wearer and whatever path they follow, with two knots on the elastic thread: one  symbolising the wearer's uniqueness, the other a reminder of [[causality]] and the path of peace and friendship to follow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html Official description of the symbology and representations] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831214813/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/bow2.html |date=31 August 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Peace Mala was founded in 2002 by Pam Evans, former Head of the Department of Religious Studies at Coedcae Comprehensive School in [[Llanelli]], Carmarthenshire, Wales. The idea arose from class discussions about the contribution of the "[[September 11 attacks|9/11]]" attacks in New York to [[Islamophobia]], racism, religious intolerance and [[fundamentalism]] worldwide, as well as local effects exemplified by the experience of the student Imran Sheikh: "''I suffered from racist taunts and our local mosque was attacked following September 11 and that is when the Peace Mala all started.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/south_east/3162388.stm Word spreads of 'peace mala'], BBC Wales interview upon winning first prize in the ChildLine in Partnership with Schools (CHIPS) initiative.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 Evans gave up her position as Head of Department at Coedcae School to focus on her work with Peace Mala.  On 16 November 2006, (25th Shawwal 1427 [[Islamic calendar|AH]]), Evans was awarded the ''Noble Soul'' Award 2006 in recognition of her outstanding contribution to challenging Islamophobia in schools.  The award was presented by RAHMA (Racial Attacks and Harassment Monitoring Association) on the ''International Day of Peace.''

===Launch===
Peace Mala was officially launched in the [[Temple of Peace, Cardiff|UNA Temple of Peace]] in [[Cardiff]] on Wednesday 27 November 2002 by [[Archbishop of Wales]] [[Rowan Williams]] (later [[Archbishop of Canterbury]]). He was joined by members of the fourteen faiths represented on the Peace Mala bracelet, whose procession opened the ceremony, along with NGOs, students and teachers of schools from across Wales, lecturers from the University of Wales, and pupils and staff of Coedcae Comprehensive School.

===Awards===
Through the promotion of peace, tolerance and respect, Peace Mala has received numerous awards for their work, notably [[The Prince's Trust]] Millennium Award in 2003, the [[The Co-operative Group|Co-op]] Community Dividend Award in 2003, the [[ChildLine]] Cymru CHIPS Friendship and Respect Award in 2003 (1st Prize), and the Carmarthenshire Police Community Challenge Award in 2004.  In 2004 Peace Mala was also awarded First Prize in the [[CEWC-Cymru]] "Right-On" National Competition to promote Human Rights in Welsh schools. In 2006 Peace Mala was awarded a grant by Awards for All (Wales) in support of the Peace Mala Awards for Youth.

==Charitable status==
On 21 February 2007, Peace Mala, already a [[company limited by guarantee]] and not having a share capital, was entered in the [[Central Register of Charities]] as Registered Charity No. 1118053.

==Patrons==
[[Rowan Williams]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], was patron of Peace Mala from 2003 until 2008, and was succeeded by Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director of the ''Yundrung Bön Study Centre''.

===Rowan Williams===
Williams and Evans first met when he visited Coedcae School to give talks to the pupils about his work as Archbishop of Wales, a position now held by [[Barry Morgan]].  Williams was one of the first persons to be contacted by Evans when she came up with the idea of the Peace Mala. One of Williams's final acts as Archbishop of Wales was to join 14 other religious dignitaries in the launch of the Peace Mala in November 2002.

In 2003 Evans invited Williams to be a patron; he held the position until 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Most Reverend Dr Rowan Williams  Archbishop Of Canterbury|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030815001700/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rowan.html|archivedate=15 August 2003|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lama Khemsar Rinpoche===
Lama Khemsar Rinpoche also visited Coedcae School prior to his involvement with Peace Mala.  Rinpoche left [[Tibet]] in 1959, and is the first resident Lama of the Yungdrung Bön tradition in Europe. He also teaches widely in the US.

Evans invited Lama Khemsar Rinpoche to be a patron of the organisation, and he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama Khemsar Rinpoche, Spiritual Director  Of The Tibetan Yungdrung Bon Study Centre|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303195024/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/patrons/rinpoche.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, Lama Khemsar Rinpoche's students have made use of the main room in the Peace Mala Registered Office for their weekly Bön [[Ngöndro|Zogchen Ngöndro]] prayers and meditations. The Tibetan room at the centre is often used by Rinpoche when he visits Wales.

==Website==
The Peace Mala website was created in 2002 using money granted by the Princes Trust Millennium Award. It was designed and published using 100% [[solar power]] by the web publishing company Arcania. The website includes news articles relating to Peace Mala activities and endorsements from prominent religious leaders, political dignitaries and celebrities including the [[Pope John Paul II]], [[Tenzin Gyatso, the 14th Dalai Lama|the 14th Dalai Lama]], [[Jillian Evans]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]], Sir [[Mark Tully]] [[Beth Nielsen Chapman]], [[Bonnie Tyler]] and Barbara Dickson.

==Registered office==
On Wednesday 18 August 2004, the Peace Mala Registered Office was officially opened during a ceremony attended by the Lord Mayor and Consort of the City of Swansea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Opening Of The Registered Office For Peace Mala|url=http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|publisher=www.peacemala.org.uk|accessdate=12 November 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303192928/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/news/centre/centre.html|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The registered office is used as a base for Peace Mala activities including workshops and public talks. Yungdrung Bön practitioners in Wales also use the centre for their weekly ''Bon Zogchen Ngon-Dro'' prayers and meditations. Yungdrung Bön (meaning ''Eternal Light'' or ''Enlightened Teaching'') is the pre-Buddhist [[Bön]] faith of [[Tibet]].

===Peace Garden===
Attached to the registered office is a peace garden with many features including a shrine to [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Buddharupa|Buddhist statues]] and [[prayer flags]], a miniature [[Zen]]-style stone garden, water features, and a tree area which has been blessed in a ceremony led by [[Neopaganism|Witches]], and [[Druid]]s.  There is also a tranquil area facing [[Mecca]], which is dedicated to the [[Islam|Muslim faith]].

==Aims==
Peace Mala outlined its "Main Aims" as:
*Education for global citizenship through the promotion of understanding, respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities, cultures and enlightened, compassionate faiths.
*Peace Mala supports human rights, confronts bullying and all forms of prejudice.
*Peace Mala raises awareness of issues of global interdependence and encourages active compassion by learners that will effect positive changes locally and globally.

==Educational work==
Peace Mala works to engages with schools to educate youths into becoming "''global citizens through the promotion of respect, friendship, tolerance and peace between all communities and faiths''".&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Alex, "Youngsters honoured for promoting peace", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 22 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===International Awards for Youth===
In 2006 Peace Mala launched the ''Peace Mala Awards for Youth''.  The awards and competition encourage young people "''...  to become aware of and involved with issues of peace, justice, tolerance and friendship.''".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html Peace Mala, PEACE MALA NATIONAL AWARDS FOR YOUTH  Award Winners 2006] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120420011636/http://www.peacemala.org.uk/awards/2006/index.html |date=20 April 2012 }}. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt; The competition focuses in issues of equality, human rights and global citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.positivenews.org.uk/2007/archive/1144/peace-mala-international-youth-awards/ "Peace Mala International Youth Awards"], ''Positive News'', 17 October 2007. ''Retrieved 18 April 2013''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Youth Awards allows entrants from educational institutions, youth groups and faith groups. Two prizes are awarded: one for juniors (5–11) and the other for seniors (12–18). The awards were accompanied by cash prizes, and occasionally donated gifts such as commemorative framed posters signed by Gary Marlon Suson from the Ground Zero Museum Workshop.

In 2007 the Peace Mala Awards for Youth became an international competition with youth groups in the USA taking part in the project.&lt;ref&gt;Byrne, Kay, "Peace hopes win top prize", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 27 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009 the Awards were superseded by the Peace Mala Accreditation.

===Accreditation for Schools, Youth Groups and Community Groups===
In September 2009 Peace Mala celebrated the last Youth Awards ceremony, where the Awards were replaced an accreditation for schools, youth groups and community groups.  As the Awards had focused on competitive engagement by schools and some youth groups, the accreditation would be more cooperative and inclusive.  Schools and groups are encouraged to include the vision and objectives of Peace Mala within their ethos via the seven criteria and accreditation is awarded when the seven criteria have been successfully fulfilled as outlined in the self-assessment form available to applicants. These seven areas are intended to fit into the school, youth group or community group's values system and are in line with the objectives and vision of Peace Mala.

Applicants for accreditation are judged against seven key criteria:

# Community cohesion and global citizenship
# Needs and human rights
# Interdependence
# Active compassion
# Celebrating diversity
# Environmental responsibilities and sustainable change
# Conflict resolution and peace education

==Interfaith engagement==
Along with education and youth engagement, with the religious nature of its founding, Peace Mala engages regularly with interfaith and diversity engagement and occasions. Awareness events and fundraisers are regular occurrences.

===Pilgrimages===
Pilgrimages have been used by Peace Mala as a means of promotion, but also as a means to engage communities in interfaith involvement and raise awareness of local areas of interest and community diversity.

====Santiago de Compostela====

====Gower====
In May 2011, volunteers discovered a route map which may have been a pilgrimage path linking the Celtic churches of the [[Gower Peninsula]], as well pre-Christian sites such as holy wells and [[Dolmen|cromlech]] stones. A pilgrimage was organised, therefore, the next year to celebrate Peace Mala's first decennial year. The pilgrimage included one pilgrim who was joined at different legs of the pilgrimage culminating in a ceremony at St. Rhidian's Church in [[Llanrhidian]]. For the pilgrimage, Pam Evans travelled to Kildare to receive the flame of Brigid of the [[Brigidine Sisters]] of the Solas Bhríde hermitage; she then received the [[World Peace Flame]] at the [[Dru yoga|Dru International]] Training Centre for Education and Wellbeing in [[Snowdonia National Park]]; finally, various faith representatives attended a ceremony where a flame was blessed at the shrine of St David at [[St David's Cathedral]] by The Very Revd [[Jonathan Lean]]. These three flames were used during the start of the pilgrimage, where the lights were blessed by The Rt Revd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]]; as well as at the end, where the flames were blessed by numerous faith representatives including Muslim, Druid and Buddhists, as well as [[ISKCON]] sannyasa who greeted the pilgrims with kirtan.

At each of the sites visited, the main pilgrim lit votive candles and recited a prayer composed for the pilgrimage. She was joined on various days by school children as well as fellow pilgrims.&lt;ref&gt;"Pilgrims step out on peace walk", ''[[South Wales Evening Post]]'', 26 July 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

====Llangyfelach "Forgotten" Monastery====
On Thursday 9 May 2013, Ascension Day, Peace Mala led a one-day pilgrimage as means of a revival of a postulated pilgrimage route to a now-defunct early Celtic monastery founded by St David on the site of the current parish Church of St David and St Cyfelach in [[Llangyfelach]].&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, Paul, "Old tradition revived by pilgrimage", ''South Wales Evening Post'', 10 May 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The participants in the pilgrimage included pupil from St John Lloyd Catholic School in Llanelli, Hafod Primary School in Swansea and Catwg Primary School. Also in procession were dignitaries from numerous faith, including The Rt Rev'd [[John Davies (bishop of Swansea and Brecon)|John Davies]], [[Bishop of Swansea and Brecon]], as well as representatives from the [[Brahma Kumaris World Spiritual University]], the [[Catholic Church]], [[Anglican Communion]] and [[Kagyu]] Tibetan Buddhism among many others.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, Pam, "Peace Mala Pilgrimage to Saint David's Forgotten Monastery", ''Diocesan News: The Diocese of Swansea &amp; Brecon '', Issue № 18, June 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

====Travelling Doves of Peace====
Peace Mala released 14 small symbolic doves made from wood painted in the Peace Mala colours and each carrying a Peace Mala bracelet (along with other items) during a ceremony that took place in the Peace Mala peace garden on 30th April 2015. The Deputy Lord Mayor of the City and County of Swansea, the Mayor and Mayoress of Neath Port Talbot, Regional Chief of Police, Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia, representatives of several faith communities and pupils and teachers from some of Peace Mala Accredited schools were all in attendance.

The founder aims that as the Doves of Peace (also known as 'Peace Doves') travel the UK and across the world, they will raise awareness of the work of Peace Mala with schools, youth groups and community groups. Within the first few months after the launch, three of the doves travelled to the USA, Ireland, Holland, Italy, Cyprus, Israel, Africa, Hong Kong and Japan. The journeys of the 14 doves are being tracked to provide a geography project for schools and youth groups. This information is published on Facebook, Twitter and our interactive world maps for people to follow online.

[[File:Dove 13 in Jerusalem.jpg|thumb|Dove 13 in Jerusalem]]

Each dove is being sponsored on its travels, thereby also bringing financial support and security for the future work of the Peace Mala educational charity. One doves in particular, number 13, is known as the Inter-Faith Dove of Peace. Information on how to sponsor the doves is available on the Peace Mala website.

===Festival of Interfaith and Culture for Education===
The Peace Mala Festival of Inter-Faith and Culture for Education was held at the award-winning, beautifully restored setting of The Monastery Manchester in Gorton on 4 October 2010.  The festival was organised by Laura Daniels, Head Teacher of Woodheys Primary School in Sale Greater Manchester, one of the first accredited schools in the UK.  Daniels came on board as an educational ambassador for Peace Mala in 2008.

The festival brought together Peace Mala with the Greater Manchester Authorities and representatives of local Faith and Peace groups to celebrate humanity, unity and diversity.  Messages of support came from the First Minister of the Welsh Assembly Government, the Archbishop of Wales and the former Bishop of Jerusalem and the Middle East.  Other support was shown by organisations including One World Week, The Interfaith Foundation, Spiritual England, Trafford CYPS and Redeeming Our Communities Manchester.

Many schools, cultural communities and representatives of faith communities took part. Guest of honour and main speaker was Terry Waite CBE.

===Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales===
On 10 June 2010 the founder of Peace Mala was honoured with the Recognising Achievement for Service to Wales.  This award was first introduced by the Welsh Assembly Government in 2009. The 2010 Award for Promoting Tolerance was carefully selected to mark the 65th anniversary of the end of World War II and the liberation of the death camps in Auschwitz and elsewhere. Evans received this honour from the First Minister Carwyn Jones AM in recognition of her work with Peace Mala and her positive stand against all forms of inequality and intolerance.

'''Peace Mala units at Primary and Secondary level included in the new Religious Education Agreed Syllabus for Trafford Education Authority UK'''

On Wednesday 9 February 2011, the founder was invited to take part in a full day of meetings with Trafford Education Authority to discuss the inclusion of Peace Mala units at primary and secondary level for the new RE Agreed Syllabus.  This proved highly successful with ideas being shared between teachers and RE advisors including Steve Illingworth (Independent Educational Consultant and Education Link Officer to Salford SACRE) and Erica Pounce, School Improvement Partner and Link Advisor for Primary Education. Pounce reported that they had worked as a Collaborative with other Greater Manchester SACREs but had also developed a distinctive local flavour, which is where the Peace Mala Units would sit as an optional unit and as an example of a compelling learning experience.
The New RE syllabus for Trafford Education Authority, including units on Peace Mala, was launched on 24 March 2011.

===International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace, Llandaff 2017===
In July 2017 the Peace Mala International Interfaith Liturgy for World Peace took place at Llandaff Cathedral Wales. This major event took almost two years to organise and plan. The idea came to the founder after the Paris terrorist attacks on Friday 13 the November 2015. The founder felt urged to bring the Peace Mala community together and Llandaff Cathedral immediately sprang to mind as a venue for this. She also felt it was time to put the spotlight on the work being achieved by the children and young people in Peace Mala schools. The purpose would be to send out a message of love, friendship and peace to all people in our world. Representatives from sixteen religions, including three Christian Bishops, and supporters from across the UK and beyond attended and took part. These included dignitaries from Cardiff, Swansea, Neath Port Talbot and Greater Manchester and Peace Mala schools from across Wales, Greater Manchester and Yorkshire. The cathedral was filled to capacity and turned out to be the largest interfaith gathering for world peace that Wales had hosted.

===Apostolic Blessing for Peace Mala from Pope Francis, September 2017===
On September 21st 2017, Peace Mala celebrated the UN International Day of Peace at St Joseph’s Catholic Cathedral in Swansea Wales UK. This was thanks to the invitation of Bishop Tom Burns of Menevia and the support of the Dean, Rev. Fr. Benedict Koledoye. Seven schools attended and took part in the Peace Mala Youth Liturgy for World Peace. Peace Mala linked up with One Day one Choir, a global peace initiative which uses the harmonious power of singing together to unite people around the world on Peace Day.

Peace Mala schools that could not be present at the event sang the Peace Mala Anthem, ‘One Light’ in their school assemblies across the UK. Lee Michael Walton, composer of the anthem, drove from London and back to accompany the children’s singing on St Joseph’s Cathedral organ. When it came to the final prayer and blessing from Bishop Tom, he susprised the congregation with an Apostolic Blessing from Pope Francis,

''"His Holiness Pope Francis presents his good wishes to Pam Evans and to all those persons involved in Peace Mala and imparts to them the requested Apostolic Blessing upon their work for world peace and encourages them with his prayers."''

This message and blessing which has a seal signed by the Apostolic Nuncio, is now on the office wall of Peace Mala HQ in Swansea.

===Youth Liturgy for World Peace, St David's Church Neath 2018===
On September 21st 2018 Peace Mala will be working with St David's Church in Neath to host a Youth Liturgy for World Peace on the UN International Day of Peace. Peace Mala accredited schools and those working towards accreditation will be joined by local dignitaries and 21 representatives from eleven different faiths.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7926">In [[linguistics]], '''phraseology''' is the study of set or fixed expressions, such as [[idiom]]s, [[phrasal verb]]s, and other types of multi-word [[lexical unit]]s (often collectively referred to as ''[[phraseme]]s''), in which the component parts of the expression take on a meaning more specific than or otherwise not predictable from the sum of their meanings when used independently. For example, ‘[[Dutch auction]]’ is composed of the words ''Dutch'' ‘of or pertaining to the Netherlands’ and ''auction'' ‘a public sale in which goods are sold to the highest bidder’, but its meaning is not ‘a sale in the Netherlands where goods are sold to the highest bidder’. Instead, the phrase has a conventionalized meaning referring to any auction where, instead of rising, the prices fall.

== History of the development of phraseology ==
Phraseology (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φράσις ''phrasis'', "way of speaking" and -λογία ''-logia'', "study of") is a scholarly approach to language which developed in the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;Knappe, Gabriele. (2004) Idioms and Fixed Expressions in English Language Study before 1800. Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; It took its start when [[Charles Bally]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Bally, Charles (1909 [1951]) Traité de stylistique française. Genève: Georg et Cie.&lt;/ref&gt; notion of ''locutions phraseologiques'' entered Russian [[lexicology]] and [[lexicography]] in the 1930s and 1940s and was subsequently developed in the former Soviet Union and other Eastern European countries. From the late 1960s on it established itself in (East) German linguistics but was also sporadically approached in English linguistics. The earliest English adaptations of phraseology are by Weinreich (1969)&lt;ref&gt;Weinreich, Uriel (1969)  Problems in the Analysis of Idioms. In J. Puhvel (ed.), Substance and Structure of Language, 23-81. Berkeley/Los Angeles: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; within the approach of [[transformational grammar]], Arnold (1973),&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, I.V. (1973) The English Word Moscow: Higher School Publishing House&lt;/ref&gt; and Lipka (1992 [1974]).&lt;ref&gt;Lipka, Leonhard. 1992. An Outline of English Lexicology. Tübingen: Max Niemeyer Verlag.&lt;/ref&gt; In Great Britain as well as other Western European countries, phraseology has steadily been developed over the last twenty years. The activities of the European Society of Phraseology (EUROPHRAS) and the European Association for Lexicography (EURALEX) with their regular conventions and publications attest to the prolific European interest in phraseology. European scholarship in phraseology is more active than in North America. Bibliographies of recent studies on English and general phraseology are included in Welte (1990)&lt;ref&gt;Welte, Werner. (1990) Englische Phraseologie und Idiomatik. Ein Arbeitsbuch mit umfassender Bibliographie. Frankfurt: Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt; and specially collected in Cowie &amp; Howarth (1996)&lt;ref&gt;Cowie, A. P. &amp; Peter Howarth.  (1996) Phraseology - a Select Bibliography. ''International Journal of Lexicography'' 9(1): 38–51&lt;/ref&gt; whose bibliography is reproduced and continued on the internet and provides a rich source of the most recent publications in the field.

==Phraseological units==
{{Main | Phraseme}}
The basic units of analysis in phraseology are often referred to as [[phraseme]]s or ''phraseological units''. Phraseological units are (according to Prof. Kunin A.V.){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} stable word-groups with partially or fully transferred meanings ("to kick the bucket",  “Greek gift”, “drink till all's blue”, “drunk as a fiddler (drunk as a lord, as a boiled owl)”, “as mad as a hatter (as a march hare)”). According to Rosemarie Gläser, a phraseological unit is a lexicalized, reproducible bilexemic or polylexemic word group in common use, which has relative syntactic and semantic stability, may be idiomatized, may carry [[connotations]], and may have an emphatic or intensifying function in a text.&lt;ref&gt;Gläser, Rosemarie. 1998. The Stylistic Potential of Phraselological Units in the Light of Genre Analysis In A.P. Cowie (ed.), Phraseology. Oxford: Clarendon Press, page 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Röntgen equivalent physical''' or '''rep''' (symbol '''rep''')&lt;!-- note that there are differences between the spelled out word rep and the symbol rep; see, e.g., radiation poisoning using the word in plural (symbols remain unchanged in plural) --&gt; is a legacy unit of [[absorbed dose]] first introduced by [[Herbert Parker (scientist)|Herbert Parker]] in 1945 to replace an improper application of the [[Roentgen (unit)|roentgen]] unit to biological tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cantrill|first=S.T|author2=H.M. Parker |title=The Tolerance Dose|date=1945-01-05|url=http://oai.dtic.mil/oai/oai?verb=getRecord&amp;metadataPrefix=html&amp;identifier=ADA322447|accessdate=14 May 2012|publisher=US Atomic Energy Commission|location=Argonne National Laboratory}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the absorbed energetic dose before the biological efficiency of the radiation is factored in. The rep has variously been defined as 83 or 93&amp;nbsp;[[erg]]s per gram of tissue (8.3/9.3&amp;nbsp;[[milligray|mGy]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunning|first=John R.|title=A Glossary of Terms in Nuclear Science and Technology|year=1957|publisher=American Society of Mechanical Engineers|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=-zgrAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA146&amp;lpg=PA146&amp;dq=83+erg+roentgen&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=NH0gk0eNeD&amp;sig=EfFqXfhlSczKw3GKwCRMn4ncayY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YZCxT5XlEYzsggfbvIW9CQ&amp;ved=0CEMQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=83%20erg%20roentgen&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 May 2012|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; or per cm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of tissue.&lt;ref name="Low-Beer1950"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bertram |first=V. A. Low-Beer|title=The clinical use of radioactive isotopes|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wnTvxg6ZAToC|accessdate=14 May 2012|year=1950|publisher=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time, this was thought to be the amount of energy deposited by 1 roentgen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Anderson|first=Elda E.|title=Units of Radiation and Radioactivity|journal=Public Health Reports|date=March 1952|volume=67|issue=3|pages=293–297|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2030726/pdf/pubhealthreporig01075-0073.pdf|accessdate=18 November 2012|doi=10.2307/4588064|pmid=14900367|pmc=2030726}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Improved measurements have since found that one roentgen of air kerma deposits 8.77&amp;nbsp;mGy in dry air, or 9.6&amp;nbsp;mGy in soft tissue, but the rep was defined as a fixed number of ergs per unit gram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=APPENDIX E: Roentgens, RADs, REMs, and other Units|url=http://web.princeton.edu/sites/ehs/radsafeguide/rsg_app_e.htm|work=Princeton University Radiation Safety Guide|publisher=Princeton University|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1952 handbook from the US National Bureau of Standards affirms that "The numerical coefficient of the rep has been deliberately changed to 93, instead of the earlier 83, to agree with L. H. Gray's 'energy-unit'."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Bureau of Standards|title=Radiological Monitoring Methods and Instruments|year=1952|publisher=US Department of Commerce|volume=51|url=http://www.orau.org/ptp/Library/NBS/NBS%2051.pdf|accessdate=16 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gray's 'energy unit' was " one rontgen of hard gamma resulted in about 93 ergs per gram energy absorption in water". The lower range value of 83.8 ergs was the value in air corresponding to wet tissue. &lt;ref&gt; Meggitt G, "Taming the Rays", pub Lulu.com 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  The rep was commonly used until the 1960s,&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite patent

[[Image:Alan Turing Building Manchester from Upper Brook St July 2007.jpg|thumb|right|200px|The Alan Turing Building. Home of the School of Mathematics from July 2007]]
The '''School of Mathematics''' at the [[University of Manchester]] is one of the largest
&lt;ref name="location"&gt;Certainly the [[Faculty of Mathematics, University of Cambridge]] is larger. Exact figures for Cambridge are hard to come by as the faculty is divided into [[DPMMS]] and [[DAMTP]] (which includes some physicists). In the 2001 RAE Cambridge returned 60 applied mathematicians and 38 pure mathematicians as lecturers and professors. In any measure Cambridge is bigger. Oxfords 2001 [[Research Assessment Exercise|RAE]] return {{cite web |url=http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/submissions/index.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203002456/http://www.hero.ac.uk/rae/submissions/index.htm |archivedate=3 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }} lists 43 pure, 32 applied and also 12 statisticians making it slightly larger than and the size may have increased. Probably the next biggest after Manchester is Leeds with about 70 academic staff over pure, applied and statistics.&lt;/ref&gt; mathematics departments in the United Kingdom, with around 80 academic staff and an undergraduate intake of roughly 400 a year (including students studying mathematics with a minor in another subject)&lt;ref&gt;League Tables of UK Mathematics Departments, [http://www.maths.manchester.ac.uk/~bl/maths_league/uk-maths-league-tables.html] gives more details of size.&lt;/ref&gt; and another 200 postgraduate students. The school was formed in 2004 by the merger of the mathematics departments of [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology]] (UMIST) and the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] (VUM).  In July 2007 the school moved from the [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]] into a purpose-designed building – the first three floors of the [[Alan Turing Building]] – on Upper Brook Street.

==Organization==
[[Image:Alan Turing building atrium July 2007.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The atrium of the Alan Turing Building]]
The current head of the school is [[Peter Duck (mathematician)|Peter Duck]]. The school is divided, mainly for the purposes of teaching administration, into three groups: ''Pure Mathematics'' headed by Mark Kambites, ''Applied Mathematics'' headed by Oliver Jensen, and ''Probability and Statistics'' headed by Goran Peskir. The Manchester Institute for Mathematical Sciences (MIMS) is a unit of the school focusing on the organising of mathematical colloquia and conferences, and research visitors. MIMS is headed by [[Nicholas Higham|Nick Higham]] [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]], who is also Director of Research. Other high-profile mathematicians at Manchester include Sir [[Martin J. Taylor|Martin Taylor]] FRS and [[Jeff Paris (mathematician)|Jeff Paris]] (Fellow of the [[British Academy]])

Since its formation, the school has made some influential appointments including the [[Topology|topologist]] [[Viktor Buchstaber]] (a member of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]]) and [[Model theory|model theorist]] [[Alex Wilkie]] FRS. Numerical analyst [[Jack Dongarra]], famous as one of the authors of [[LINPACK]], was appointed in 2007 as Turing Fellow. In the autumn of 2007 another corresponding member of the Russian Academy of Sciences [[Albert Shiryaev]] was appointed to a 20% chair. Shiryaev is famous for his work on probability theory (he was a student of [[Andrey Kolmogorov|Kolmogorov]]) and for his work on [[financial mathematics]].

==Research==

As might be expected from its size, the school has a wide range of research interests, including the traditionally pure areas of [[Algebra]], [[Mathematical analysis|Analysis]], [[Noncommutative geometry]], [[Ergodic theory]], [[Mathematical logic]], [[Number theory]], [[Geometry]] and [[Topology]]; and the more applied [[Dynamical system]], [[Fluid dynamics]], [[Solid mechanics]], [[Inverse problem]]s, [[Mathematical finance]], [[Wave propagation]] and [[Scattering]]. The school also has a strong tradition in [[Numerical analysis]] and well established groups in [[Probability theory]], and [[Mathematical statistics]].

Manchester mathematicians have a long tradition of applying mathematics to industrial problems. Nowadays this involves not only the traditional applications in engineering and the physical sciences, but also in the life sciences and the financial sector. Some of the recent industrial partners include [[Qinetiq]], [[Hewlett Packard]], [[Numerical Algorithms Group|NAg]], [[MathWorks]], [[Comsol]], [[Philips]] Labs, [[Thales Underwater Systems]], [[Rapiscan Systems]] and [[Schlumberger]].

===Research Assessment Exercise (2008)===


The School of Mathematics entered research into three units of assessment. In Pure Mathematics 20% of submissions from 27 FTE category A staff were rated 4* (World Class) and 40% 3* (Internationally Excellent). In Applied Mathematics 25% of submissions from 28.8 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*. And in Statistics and Operational Research, 20% of submissions from 10.9 FTE category A staff were rated 4* and 35%, 3*.&lt;ref name="RAE 2008"&gt;{{cite web|title=Research Assessment Exercise 2008|url=http://www.rae.ac.uk/Submissions/submissions.aspx?id=163&amp;type=hei|accessdate=27 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
At the time of merger the two departments that came together to form the school were of roughly equal sizes and academic strengths, and already had a substantial record of collaboration including shared research seminar programmes and fourth year undergraduate and MSc programmes.

Many famous mathematicians have worked at the precursor departments to the school.

In 1885 [[Horace Lamb]], famous for his contribution to [[fluid dynamics]] accepted a chair at the VUM and under his leadership the department grew rapidly. Newman wrote:

:'His lecture courses were numerous, and his books provide a record of his methods. Many of his students were engineers, and they found in him a sympathetic guide, one who understood their difficulties and shared their interest in applications of mathematics to mechanics.'

In 1907 famous analyst and number theorist [[John Edensor Littlewood]] was appointed to the [[Richardson Chair of Applied Mathematics|Richardson Lectureship]] which he held for three years.

During 1912–1913 the pioneer of weather forecasting and numerical analysis [[Lewis Fry Richardson]] worked at [[University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology|Manchester College of Science and Technology]] (later to become UMIST). Number theorist [[Louis J. Mordell]] joined the College in 1920. During this time he discovered the result for which he is best known, namely the finite basis theorem (or [[Mordell–Weil theorem]]), which proved a conjecture of [[Henri Poincaré]]. Mordell then went on to become Fielden Reader in Pure Mathematics at VUM in 1922 and then held the Fielden Chair in 1923. Mordell built up the department, offering posts to a number of outstanding mathematicians who had been forced from posts on the continent of Europe. He brought in [[Reinhold Baer]], [[G. Billing]], [[Paul Erdős]], [[Chao Ko]], [[Kurt Mahler]], and [[Beniamino Segre]]. He also recruited [[J. A. Todd]], [[Patrick du Val]], [[Harold Davenport]], [[L. C. Young]], and invited distinguished visitors. 

Although Manchester was later to be known as the birthplace of the electronic computer, [[Douglas Hartree]] made an earlier contribution building a [[differential analyser]] in 1933. The machine was used for [[ballistics]] calculations as well calculating railway timetables.

Mordell was succeeded by the famous topologist and [[Cryptanalysis|cryptanalyst]] [[Max Newman]] in 1945 who, as head of department, transformed it into a centre of international renown.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Ledermann, Encounters of a Mathematician, 2009 {{isbn|978-1-4092-8267-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Undergraduate numbers increased from eight per year to 40 and then 60. In 1948 Newman recruited [[Alan Turing]] as Reader in the department, and he worked there until his death in 1954, completing some of his profound work on the foundations of computer science including ''[[Computing Machinery and Intelligence]]''. Newman retired in 1964. From 1949 to 1960 [[M. S. Bartlett]] held the first chair in [[mathematical statistics]] at VUM, he is known for his contribution to the analysis of data with spatial and temporal patterns, the theory of [[statistical inference]] and in [[multivariate analysis]]. At Manchester he developed an interest in [[epidemiology]], building a strong group in mathematical statistics and strengthening the department.

[[Image:Maths Tower, University of Manchester 2.jpg|thumb|left|The VUM [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]] prior to its demolition]]

[[Fluid dynamics|Fluid dynamicist]] [[Sydney Goldstein]] held the [[Beyer Chair of Applied Mathematics]] from 1945 to 1950, and was succeeded from 1950 to 1959 by [[James Lighthill]], also a fluid dynamicist. In pure mathematics, [[Bernhard Neumann]], an influential [[group theory|group theorist]], joined the department at VUM in 1948, leaving as a Reader in 1961 to take a chair in Australia. In 1969, VUM's [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics Tower]], an 18-storey skyscraper on Oxford Road, was completed. 

[[Image:Frank Bowman UMIST Mathematician oil portrait.jpg|right|thumb|Frank Bowman was the longest serving head of Mathematics at UMIST: 1933–1957. This portrait was presented to the department by the [[Royal Society of Chemistry]]]]
Up until the 1950s, UMIST's Mathematics Department taught largely service courses for the engineering and applied science courses, and despite stars such as Richardson, Mordell and in 1958–1963 group theorist [[Hanna Neumann]], did not have a strong focus on research.  Neumann was later to be the first woman appointed to a Professorial Chair of Mathematics in Australia. 

[[Image:Maths and Social Science Building.jpg|thumb|left|The Maths and Social Sciences Building, which housed the UMIST Department of Mathematics from 1968 until merger, and part of the merged School until the opening of the Alan Turing Building in July 2007]]

With the rapid expansion of higher education and the starting of an undergraduate mathematics degree this changed, and by 1968 the 15-storey [[Maths and Social Sciences Building]] (MSS) was completed on UMIST campus to house the growing department. In 1960 [[Robin Bullough]] joined the UMIST department initiating four decades of mathematical physics focusing especially on [[soliton]]s. The statistics group also grew in strength with an emphasis on [[time series]], led by [[Maurice Priestley]] and also [[Tata Subba Rao]]. In 1986 pure mathematics at UMIST was strengthened by the appointment of [[Martin J. Taylor]] FRS, famous for his work on properties and structures of [[algebraic numbers]].

Another renowned topologist, [[Frank Adams]], succeeded Newman in the Fielden Chair, which he held from 1964 to 1970.

The VUM [[Mathematics Tower, Manchester|Mathematics tower]] was demolished in 2005, with most of the staff moving to temporary buildings, the pure mathematicians to one named after Newman and the applied to one named after Lamb. The history of the School entered a new phase in July 2007 with the move to the Alan Turing Building.

Given a [[binary relation]] &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; between fixed strings over the alphabet, called '''rewrite rules''', denoted by &lt;math&gt;s\rightarrow t&lt;/math&gt;, an SRS extends the rewriting relation to all strings in which the left- and right-hand side of the rules appear as [[substring]]s, that is &lt;math&gt;usv\rightarrow utv&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;s&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; are strings.

The notion of a semi-Thue system essentially coincides with the [[presentation of a monoid]]. Thus they constitute a natural framework for solving the [[word problem (mathematics)|word problem]] for monoids and groups.

An SRS can be defined directly as an [[abstract rewriting system]]. It can also be seen as a restricted kind of a [[term rewriting]] system. As a formalism, string rewriting systems are [[Turing complete]]. The semi-Thue name comes from the Norwegian mathematician [[Axel Thue]], who introduced systematic treatment of string rewriting systems in a 1914 paper.&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; Thue introduced this notion hoping to solve the word problem for finitely presented semigroups. It wasn't until 1947 the problem was shown to be [[undecidable problem|undecidable]]&amp;mdash; this result was obtained independently by [[Emil Post]] and [[Andrey Markov (Soviet mathematician)|A. A. Markov Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;Abramsky et al. p. 416&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salomaa et al., p.444&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==

A '''string rewriting system''' or '''semi-Thue system''' is a [[tuple]] &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; where  
* {{math|&amp;Sigma;}} is an alphabet, usually assumed finite.&lt;ref&gt;In Book and Otto a semi-Thue system is defined over a finite alphabet through most of the book, except chapter 7 when monoid presentation are introduced, when this assumption is quietly dropped.&lt;/ref&gt; The elements of the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; (* is the [[Kleene star]] here) are finite (possibly empty) strings on {{math|&amp;Sigma;}}, sometimes called ''words'' in [[formal languages]]; we will simply call them strings here.
* {{mvar|R}} is a [[binary relation]] on strings from {{math|&amp;Sigma;}}, i.e., &lt;math&gt;R \subseteq \Sigma^* \times \Sigma^*.&lt;/math&gt; Each element &lt;math&gt;(u,v) \in R&lt;/math&gt; is called a ''(rewriting) rule'' and is usually written &lt;math&gt;u \rightarrow v&lt;/math&gt;.  

If the relation {{mvar|R}} is [[symmetric relation|symmetric]], then the system is called a '''Thue system'''.

The rewriting rules in {{mvar|R}} can be naturally extended to other strings in &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; by allowing substrings to be rewritten according to {{mvar|R}}. More formally, the '''one-step rewriting relation''' relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; induced by {{mvar|R}} on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; for any strings &lt;math&gt;s, t \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;s \xrightarrow[R]{} t&lt;/math&gt; if and only if there exist &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;s = xuy&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;t = xvy&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;u \rightarrow v&lt;/math&gt;.

Since &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; is a relation on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, the pair &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma^*, \xrightarrow[R]{})&lt;/math&gt; fits the definition of an [[abstract rewriting system]]. Obviously {{mvar|R}} is a subset of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;. Some authors use a different notation for the arrow in &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;) in order to distinguish it from {{mvar|R}} itself (&lt;math&gt;\rightarrow&lt;/math&gt;) because they later want to be able to drop the subscript and still avoid confusion between {{mvar|R}} and the one-step rewrite induced by {{mvar|R}}.

Clearly in a semi-Thue system we can form a (finite or infinite) sequence of strings produced by starting with an initial string &lt;math&gt;s_0 \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; and repeatedly rewriting it by making one substring-replacement at a time: 

:&lt;math&gt;s_0 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ s_1 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ s_2 \ \xrightarrow[R]{} \ \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

A zero-or-more-steps rewriting like this is captured by the [[reflexive transitive closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted by &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[abstract rewriting system#Basic notions]]). This is called the '''rewriting relation''' or '''reduction relation''' on &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; induced by {{mvar|R}}.

== Thue congruence ==

In general, the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; of strings on an alphabet forms a [[free monoid]] together with the [[binary operation]] of [[string concatenation]] (denoted as &lt;math&gt;\cdot&lt;/math&gt; and written multiplicatively by dropping the symbol). In a SRS, the reduction relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is compatible with the monoid operation, meaning that &lt;math&gt;x\xrightarrow[R]{*} y&lt;/math&gt; implies &lt;math&gt;uxv\xrightarrow[R]{*} uyv&lt;/math&gt; for all strings &lt;math&gt;x, y, u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;. Since &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; is by definition a [[preorder]], &lt;math&gt;\left(\Sigma^*, \cdot, \xrightarrow[R]{*}\right)&lt;/math&gt; forms a [[Monoidal_category#Monoidal_preorders|monoidal preorder]].

Similarly, the [[reflexive transitive symmetric closure]] of &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{}&lt;/math&gt;, denoted &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; (see [[abstract rewriting system#Basic notions]]), is a [[Congruence relation|congruence]], meaning it is an [[equivalence relation]] (by definition) and it is also compatible with string concatenation. The relation &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''Thue congruence''' generated by {{mvar|R}}. In a Thue system, i.e. if {{mvar|R}} is symmetric, the rewrite relation &lt;math&gt;\xrightarrow[R]{*}&lt;/math&gt; coincides with the Thue congruence &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt;.

== Factor monoid and monoid presentations ==
Since &lt;math&gt;\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; is a congruence, we can define the '''factor monoid''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R = \Sigma^*/\overset{*}{\underset R \leftrightarrow}&lt;/math&gt; of the [[free monoid]] &lt;math&gt;\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; by the Thue congruence in the [[factor monoid|usual manner]]. If a monoid &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is [[isomorphic]] with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}_R&lt;/math&gt;, then the semi-Thue system &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; is called a [[monoid presentation]] of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;.

We immediately get some very useful connections with other areas of algebra. For example, the alphabet {''a'', ''b''} with the rules { ''ab'' → ε, ''ba'' → ε }, where ε is the [[empty string]], is a presentation of the [[free group]] on one generator. If instead the rules are just { ''ab'' → ε }, then we obtain a presentation of the [[bicyclic monoid]].

The importance of semi-Thue systems as presentation of monoids is made stronger by the following:

'''Theorem''': Every monoid has a presentation of the form &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt;, thus it may be always be presented by a semi-Thue system, possibly over an infinite alphabet.&lt;ref&gt;Book and Otto, Theorem 7.1.7, p. 149&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, the set &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is called the '''set of generators''' of &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; is called the set of '''defining relations''' &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;. We can immediately classify monoids based on their presentation. &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt; is called
* '''finitely generated''' if &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; is finite.
* '''finitely presented''' if both &lt;math&gt;\Sigma&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt; are finite.

== The word problem for semi-Thue systems ==

The word problem for semi-Thue systems can be stated as follows: Given a semi-Thue system &lt;math&gt;T:=(\Sigma, R)&lt;/math&gt; and two words (strings) &lt;math&gt;u, v \in \Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt;, can &lt;math&gt;u&lt;/math&gt; be transformed into &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; by applying rules from &lt;math&gt;R&lt;/math&gt;? This problem is [[Undecidable problem|undecidable]], i.e. there is no general algorithm for solving this problem. This even holds if we limit the input to finite systems{{Definition needed|date=January 2018}}.

Martin Davis offers the lay reader a two-page proof in his article "What is a Computation?" pp.&amp;nbsp;258–259 with commentary p.&amp;nbsp;257. Davis casts the proof in this manner: "Invent [a word problem] whose solution would lead to a solution to the [[halting problem]]."

== Connections with other notions ==

A semi-Thue system is also a [[term-rewriting]] system&amp;mdash;one that has [[monadic (arity)|monadic]] words (functions) ending in the same variable as the left- and right-hand side terms,&lt;ref&gt;[[Nachum Dershowitz]] and [[Jean-Pierre Jouannaud]]. [http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/dershowitz90rewrite.html Rewrite Systems] (1990) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; e.g. a term rule &lt;math&gt;f_2(f_1(x)) \rightarrow g(x)&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the string rule &lt;math&gt;f_1f_2 \rightarrow g&lt;/math&gt;.

A semi-Thue system is also a special type of [[Post canonical system]], but every Post canonical system can also be reduced to an SRS. Both formalisms are [[Turing complete]], and thus equivalent to [[Noam Chomsky]]'s [[unrestricted grammar]]s, which are sometimes called ''semi-Thue grammars''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Daniel I. A. Cohen|D.I.A. Cohen]], Introduction to Computer Theory, 2nd ed., Wiley-India, 2007, {{isbn|81-265-1334-9}}, p.572&lt;/ref&gt; A [[formal grammar]] only differs from a semi-Thue system by the separation of the alphabet into [[terminal symbol|terminal]]s and non-terminals, and the fixation of a starting symbol amongst non-terminals. A minority of authors actually define a semi-Thue system as a triple &lt;math&gt;(\Sigma, A, R)&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;A\subseteq\Sigma^*&lt;/math&gt; is called the ''set of axioms''. Under this "generative" definition of semi-Thue system, an unrestricted grammar is just a semi-Thue system with a single axiom in which one partitions the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals, and makes the axiom a nonterminal.&lt;ref&gt;Dan A. Simovici, Richard L. Tenney, ''Theory of formal languages with applications'', World Scientific, 1999 {{isbn|981-02-3729-4}}, chapter 4&lt;/ref&gt; The simple artifice of partitioning the alphabet into terminals and non-terminals is a powerful one; it allows the definition of the [[Chomsky hierarchy]] based on what combination of terminals and non-terminals the rules contain. This was a crucial development in the theory of [[formal languages]].

==History and importance==
Semi-Thue systems were developed as part of a program to add additional constructs to [[logic]], so as to create systems such as [[propositional logic]], that would allow general mathematical theorems to be expressed in a [[formal language]], and then proven and verified in an automatic, mechanical fashion. The hope was that the act of [[theorem proving]] could then be reduced to a set of defined manipulations on a set of strings.  It was subsequently realized that semi-Thue systems are isomorphic to [[unrestricted grammar]]s, which in turn are known to be isomorphic to [[Turing machine]]s. This method of research succeeded and now computers can be used to verify the proofs of mathematic and logical theorems.

At the suggestion of [[Alonzo Church]], [[Emil Post]] in a paper published in 1947, first proved "a certain Problem of Thue" to be unsolvable, what [[Martin Davis]] states as "...the first unsolvability proof for a problem from classical mathematics -- in this case the word problem for semigroups." (Undecidable p.&amp;nbsp;292)

Davis [ibid] asserts that the proof was offered independently by A. A. Markov (C. R. (Doklady) Acad. Sci. U.S.S.R. (n.s.) 55(1947), pp.&amp;nbsp;583–586.

A '''slow movement''' is a form in a multi-[[Movement (music)|movement]] musical piece. Generally, the second movement of a piece will be written as a slow movement, although composers occasionally write other movements as a slow movement as well. The tempo of a slow movement can vary from largo to andante. It is usually in the [[dominant key|dominant]], [[subdominant]], [[parallel key|parallel]], or [[relative key|relative]] key of the musical work's main key.

== Overview ==
The general layout of a four-movement piece is as follows:

# A fast movement, written in [[sonata form]]
# A slow movement
# A [[minuet]] or [[scherzo]]
# A faster movement, usually a [[rondo]]

However, composers sometimes remove, add or re-arrange movements, such as Beethoven's Moonlight Sonata, which begins with the slow movement. When a piece has additional movements, they may also be written as a slow movement.

== Form ==
A slow movement is usually written in one of three forms: [[Ternary form|compound or "large" ternary]], sonata form without development, and [[Variation (music)|theme and variations]].

=== Large ternary ===
Large ternary is the most common form used for a slow movement. It consists of three parts, labeled ABA. The first and third part are almost identical, whereas the middle part is contrasting.
If the starting key is a major key, the middle part is typically written in a minor key; if the starting key is a minor key, the middle part is typically written in a major key. The keys do not have to have the same tonic. If the middle part is written in a major key, it is often labeled Maggiore. If it is written in a minor key, then it is labeled Minore.
The final part is always a return of the first part, but frequently has additional ornaments and small phrases added on.

=== Sonata form without development ===
Sonata form without development is a variant of sonata form where the development is omitted, leaving only the exposition and recapitulation.  This form is also known as [[Sonatina]] form.  As written above, in Sonatina form, there is no development section, but rather a dominant-seventh chord between the exposition and the recapitulation that prepares for the recapitulation and the tonic key.  One example of the piece in sonata form without development is the second movement of Beethoven's Piano Sonata No. 17, "The Tempest".

=== Theme and variations ===
Theme and [[Variations (music)|variations]] form starts with a theme, followed by multiple variations. This theme is usually eight to thirty-two bars in length, and may be constructed as a musical sentence,  period, or small ternary. Each variation is a recurrence of the theme with melodic, harmonic, rhythmic and ornamental changes.

Theme and variations sometimes contain one "minore" variation. This variation will have a contrasting tonality, and may be different in form from the theme.

Theme and variations may also have a coda to finalize the piece. It may bring back the original theme with few or no changes, in order to create symmetry.

'''Steve William Fuller''' (born 12 July 1959) is an American philosopher-sociologist in the field of [[science and technology studies]].  He has published in the areas of [[social epistemology]], [[academic freedom]], and the subjects of [[intelligent design]] and [[transhumanism]].

==Biography==

Fuller attended [[Regis High School (New York City)|Regis High School]] in [[Manhattan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|accessdate=4 August 2014|last=Fuller|first=Steve |title=Science vs. Religion? Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution |page=9|url= https://books.google.com/?id=1P22AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9 |date= 2007|publisher=Polity Press|isbn=9780745673493}}&lt;/ref&gt; Admitted as a John Jay Scholar to [[Columbia University]], he majored in History and Sociology and graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1979. Awarded a [[Kellett Fellowship]], he studied at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], and received an M.Phil. in History and Philosophy of Science in 1981. He earned his Ph.D. in the same subject from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1985, where he was an Andrew Mellon Pre-Doctoral Fellow. Fuller's doctoral dissertation, "Bounded Rationality in Law and Science", explored the implications of the views of [[Herbert A. Simon]] for political theory and philosophy of science.

Fuller held assistant and associate professorships at the [[University of Colorado at Boulder]], [[Virginia Tech]] and the [[University of Pittsburgh]]. In 1994, he was appointed to the chair in sociology and social policy at the [[University of Durham]], [[England]]. He moved in 1999 to the [[University of Warwick]], England. In July 2007 Fuller was awarded a [[D. Litt.]] by Warwick in recognition of "published work or papers which demonstrate a high standard of important original work forming a major contribution to a subject".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.warwick.ac.uk/insite/newsandevents/warwickpeople/higher_doctorates_for/  Higher Doctorates for Warwick People], [[University of Warwick]]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, Fuller served as President of the Sociology section of the [[British Association for the Advancement of Science]]. In that capacity, he staged a play, "Lincoln and Darwin—Live for One Night Only!", at the BA's annual Festival of Science in Liverpool.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=403503 |title=On stage, On the Origin ... author endures a dramatic trial of faith |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play was later produced as a podcast in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |title=Lincoln and Darwin for one night only |publisher=Sci Phi Journal |date=11 February 2009 |accessdate=1 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226215015/http://sciphijournal.com/2009/02/11/11-darwin-and-lincoln-for-one-night-only/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Fuller is most closely associated with [[social epistemology]] as an interdisciplinary research program. Social [[epistemology]] is a normative discipline that addresses philosophical problems of knowledge using the tools of history and the social sciences. Fuller founded the first journal (1987)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandfonline.com/action/journalInformation?show=editorialBoard&amp;journalCode=tsep20#.VJ6H3V4gMA&lt;/ref&gt; and wrote the first book (1988)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fuller|first1=Steve|title=Philosophy, Rhetoric, and the end of knowledge|date=1993|publisher=The University of Wisconsin Press|page=xii}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-jJmvfREmQC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=%22Social+Epistemology%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K4qeVPCNAo3sasbwgrAF&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Social%20Epistemology%22&amp;f=false ]&lt;/ref&gt; devoted to this topic. The most obvious feature of Fuller's approach, already present in his 1988 book, is that he rejects out of hand the Cartesian problem of [[scepticism]].

Along with 21 books, Fuller has written 65 book chapters, 155 academic articles and many minor pieces. He has given many distinguished lectures and plenary addresses, and has presented to academic and non-academic audiences throughout the world, including over 100 media interviews. His works have been translated into fifteen languages. 23 academic symposia have been published on his work. He moved to the [[United Kingdom]] in 1994, the year he organized a conference in Durham on "Science's Social Standing".&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Since moving to the UK, Fuller has increasingly oriented himself towards public intellectual expression, including television, radio and internet, which he interprets as a natural outgrowth of his version of social epistemology. Two of his books have been recognised in this regard. ''[[Kuhn vs. Popper]]'' was Book of the Month for February 2005 in the US mass circulation magazine, ''Popular Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mone |first=Gregory |url=http://www.popsci.com/scitech/article/2005-02/not-quite-rumble-theoretical-jungle |title=(Not Quite a) Rumble in the Theoretical Jungle &amp;#124; Popular Science |publisher=Popsci.com |date=13 July 1965 |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Rupert Read]] wrote: "I did not have to read far into this book in order to conclude that it is worthless. ...

He periodically contributes a column to the Project Syndicate, associated with George Soros' Open Society project, which appears in several languages in newspapers across the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.project-syndicate.org/search?search_string=Steve+Fuller&amp;languageid=1&amp;rm=search&amp;submit=submit&amp;submit.x=17&amp;submit.y=13 Project Syndicate]. Project Syndicate. Retrieved on 14 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006 he also taught a course on the epistemology of journalism at an international summer school at the [[University of Lund]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.icomm.lu.se/summerschool/course1.html The Epistemology of Journalism Course Description] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061118133435/http://www.icomm.lu.se/summerschool/course1.html |date=18 November 2006 }}, [[University of Lund]]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Academic freedom===

Fuller believes (modeled on what he takes to be the German model) that [[academic freedom]] is a freedom reserved for academics, not a special case of freedom of speech.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Fuller | first1 = Steve | last2 = Haworth | first2 = Alan | title = Academic freedom | journal = [[The Philosophers' Magazine]] | volume = 38 | issue = 2 | pages = 72–77 | doi = 10.5840/tpm20073864 | date = 2007 }} Debating the [http://www.afaf.org.uk/afaf-statement/ "statement of academic freedom"] made by Academics for Academic Freedom (AFAF).&lt;/ref&gt; This includes the right to "cause reasoned offence", if within the terms of reason and evidence appropriate to the academic profession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/education/higher/against-the-grain-it-is-an-academics-right-to-cause-reasoned-offence-455905.html | work=The Independent | location=London | title=Against the grain: It is an academic's right to cause 'reasoned' offence | first=Nick | last=Jackson | date=5 July 2007 | accessdate=24 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believes it important for academics to be able to express intellectual opinions for further debate which can result in progress. He also argues that students are equally entitled to academic freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=410297 |title=A clear and present danger |publisher=Times Higher Education |date= |accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===
Fuller has made many statements about his support for [[intelligent design]] (ID) and authored two books on the subject. In 2005, in the case of ''[[Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District]]'', he testified on behalf of a local school system in the United States that required the teaching of intelligent design. The decision of the U.S. District Court held that intelligent design was a form of [[creationism]] and that its inclusion in the curriculum violated the U.S. Constitution's prohibition on the [[Establishment Clause|establishment of religion]]. The decision repeatedly cited Fuller's testimony to undermine the school system's position. Some of Fuller's critics within the [[Science and Technology Studies]] community described his participation in the trial as "naive" and suggested that the field needs further development before it can constructively engage the legal community on the nature of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Lynch | first = Michael | author-link = Michael Lynch (ethnomethodologist) | title = From Ruse to Farce | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 819–826  | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067897 | date = December 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Edmond | first1 = Gary | last2 = Mercer | first2 = David | title = Anti-social epistemologies | journal = [[Social Studies of Science]] | volume = 36 | issue = 6 | pages = 843–853 | doi = 10.1177/0306312706067900 | date = December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller has said that he does not support intelligent design "but feels that it should have a 'fair run for its money{{'"}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Corbyn|first=Zoe|title=Steve Fuller: Designer trouble |url=https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/31/academicexperts.highereducationprofile|publisher=The Guardian |location=London|date=1 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Dissent over Descent'', he says he sees religion in general as a motivating influence in scientific pursuits and believes that the difference between science and religion is more institutional than intellectual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Dissent Over Descent|year=2007|publisher=Icon|isbn=9781840468045|pages=8–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=200538&amp;sectioncode=26 Schools for the Enlightenment or epiphany?: Steve Fuller], [[The Times Higher Education Supplement]], 25 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have called his views on science [[Postmodernism|postmodernist]], though others characterise them as more closely related to [[Social constructionism#Social constructionism and postmodernism|social constructionism]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf Brief for Amicus Curiae, Scipolicy Journal of Science and Health Policy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930204245/http://www2.ncseweb.org/kvd/all_legal/2005-10_amicus_briefs/2005-11-04_SciPolicy_Journal_amicus.pdf |date=30 September 2007 }}, ''Kitzmiller v. Dover Area School District''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.talkreason.org/articles/Fuller.cfm Steve Fuller and The Hidden Agenda of Social Constructivism], Norman Levitt, Talk Reason&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 February 2007, Fuller debated [[Lewis Wolpert]] at [[Royal Holloway, University of London]] on whether evolution and intelligent design should be accorded equal status as scientific theories. Fuller supported the proposition. Fuller endorsed a work in support of Intelligent Design, the [[Discovery Institute]]'s textbook ''[[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism]]'' (2007).&lt;ref&gt;[http://exploreevolution.com/endorsements.php Endorsements], [[Explore Evolution: The Arguments For and Against Neo-Darwinism|Explore Evolution]] website&lt;/ref&gt;

Appearing in the 2008 film ''[[Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed]]'', Fuller told an interviewer:&lt;ref name=expelled&gt;''Expelled: No Intelligence Allowed'' (2008 film). Rocky Mountain Pictures. Directed by Nathan Frankowski.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|If you take seriously that evolution has to do with the transition of life forms, and that life and death are just natural processes, then one gets to be liberal about abortion and euthanasia. All of those kinds of ideas seem to me follow very naturally from a Darwinian perspective – a deprivileging of human beings, basically. And I think people who want to endorse Darwinism have to take this kind of viewpoint very seriously.}}

Fuller openly acknowledges that while some people simply do not like or accept either 'design in nature' or that human beings were created "in the image and likeness of God" (''imago Dei''), many people do and that it has been a consistent fixture in the progress, development and motivation for doing modern science.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video| url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zQ51gVtJAw | first=Steve | last=Fuller |title="Why some people like the idea of design in nature and others don't" |work=University of Cambridge, |date=14 July 2012 |accessdate= 19 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transhumanism===
Much of his work focuses on questions around technological enhancements and how they can improve the capacities of human beings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/bio/fuller/ Steve Fuller]. Ieet.org. Retrieved on 14 May 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller argues that the pursuit for enhancements is based on a need ″to create some distance between ourselves and the other animals.″ &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | first=Kevin | last=Holmes | title = Talking to the future humans – Steve Fuller | url= https://www.vice.com/en_uk/read/talking-to-the-future-humans-steve-fuller-transhumanism | work=Vice Media | date= 29 September 2011 | accessdate= 15 February 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Fuller, transhumanism offers humanity the prospect "to re-engineer the human body to enable us to live longer so as to work and play harder." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fuller|first=Steve|title=Humanity 2.0|year=2011|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9780230233423|page=242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principal works==

===''Science Vs Religion?''===
In 2007, Fuller wrote ''Science Vs Religion?: Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution''. In addition to introductory and conclusionary chapters, it has chapters on the history of the [[relationship between religion and science]], the thesis that modern science has its basis in an attempt by humanity to transcend itself and reach God, how Fuller believes complexity distinguishes ID from "other versions of creationism", legal issues, and the future of "[[Darwinism]]".&lt;ref name=Sarkar&gt;[http://ndpr.nd.edu/review.cfm?id=13887 Review of ''Science Vs Religion?''], Sahotra Sarkar, ''Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews'', 7 August 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Professor of mathematics at [[Rutgers University]], [[Norman Levitt]] in a review described it as "a truly miserable piece of work, crammed with errors scientific, historical, and even theological".&lt;ref name="2007Levitt"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature | title=Norman Levitt Deconstructs Steve Fuller's Postmodernist Critique of Evolution  | publisher=[[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)]] |date=19 December 2007  | first=Norman | last= Levitt   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt took issue with the following points:&lt;ref name="2007Levitt"/&gt; 
*Fuller's acceptance at face value of [[William Dembski]]'s claims on complexity and randomness, and his failure to come to grips with the wealth of results that this field has generated and with the trenchant criticism of Dembski's claims (or even to describe these claims accurately);
*Fuller's disparagement of [[evolutionary biology]], without doing "serious analysis of the working methods and logical structure of biology itself" on which to base it;
*Fuller's misrepresentation of [[Isaac Newton]]'s religious beliefs in order to make a point that is in fact antithetical to Newton's views;
Levitt infers that Fuller's views arise from an "animosity to science as such and to its cognitive authority [that] still pervades academic life outside the dominion of the science faculty".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/07-12-19.html#feature The Painful Elaboration of the Fatuous], Norman Levitt, eSkeptic, [[Skeptic (U.S. magazine)|Skeptic magazine]]&lt;/ref&gt;
Fuller later responded to these points, accusing Levitt of axe-grinding and questioning his understanding of the book, which Fuller claimed was less a defense of contemporary intelligent design theory than a demonstration of its rootedness in the history of science. Fuller also claims that Levitt misquotes one of the three passages Levitt cites from the book, making it mean the opposite of the original.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-01-16.html#feature Steve Fuller Responds to Norman Levitt's Review of ''Science v. Religion''] E-Skeptic, 16 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Levitt subsequently responded at length to Fuller, concluding that "Fuller's misreading of the politics that generated and sustains the ID movement is so complete as to constitute a peculiar pathology all its own."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skeptic.com/eskeptic/08-01-23.html#response Norman Levitt Responds to Steve Fuller] E-Skeptic, 23 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Fuller has long been highly critical of the views of science of his opponents in the [[Science Wars]], including  Levitt, dating back at least to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storyCode=154395&amp;sectioncode=26|title=In Snow's shoes |publisher=THES|date=11 November 1994|accessdate=1 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Can Science Studies be Spoken in a Civil Tongue?'', S Fuller, Social Studies of Science, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

Intelligent Design and the Problem of Evolution | publisher=Philosophical Reviews |date=7 August 2008 | first=Norman | last= Levitt   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarkar further states that the book has an idiosyncratic interpretation of the [[history of philosophy]], including of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and of [[logical positivism]]; having a limited grasp of the [[history of science]], including making claims about [[Isaac Newton|Newton]], [[Georges Cuvier|Cuvier]], [[Louis Agassiz|Agassiz]], [[Lamarck]], [[Gregor Mendel|Mendel]], Pearson and [[Galton]] that are not supported by their writings; failure to engage the "debate over naturalism that ID creationism has generated" with "remarks on supernaturalism [that show] him to be equally non-cognizant of the work of ... Philip Johnson"; and other scientific errors.&lt;ref name="2008Sarkar"/&gt;

===''Dissent Over Descent''===
In 2008 Fuller's book on the intelligent design controversy, ''Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism'' was published. Steven Poole of [[The Guardian]] wrote: "book is an epoch-hopping parade of straw men, incompetent reasoning and outright gibberish, as when evolution is argued to share with astrology a commitment to "action at a distance", except that the distance is in time rather than space. It's intellectual quackery like this that gives philosophy of science a bad name."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/jul/12/saturdayreviewsfeatres.guardianreview7 | title=Trivial pursuits Steve Fuller's Dissent Over Descent: Intelligent Design's Challenge to Darwinism  | publisher=The Guardian |date=12 July 2008  | first=Steven | last=Poole | accessdate =10 October 2008 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Ruse]], Philosopher of Science at [[Florida State University]] wrote in the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' that Fuller's book "is completely wrong and is backed by no sound scholarship whatsoever. In at least one case, Fuller makes his case by an egregious misreading—of something I wrote about the role of genetic drift in Sewall Wright's shifting balance theory. For the record, Charles Darwin set out to provide a cause, what he called—following his mentors like William Whewell (who in turn referred back to Newton)—a true cause or ''vera causa''. Darwin felt, and historians and philosophers of science as well as practicing evolutionary biologists still feel, that he succeeded…"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/322/5898/47.pdf |format=PDF| title=A Challenge Standing on Shaky Clay  | publisher=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |date=3 October 2008  | first=Michael | last=Ruse   | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a "book of the week" review by retired Divinity Professor [[Keith Ward]] in the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]],'' the book was praised for providing often overlooked information and provocative interpretations, but was criticised for a number of inaccuracies and misrepresentations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/story.asp?storycode=402929 The book of the week: Dissent over Descent], [[Times Higher Education Supplement]], 24 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. C. Grayling]], in [[New Humanist]], wrote that the book contains a "mark of ignorance and historical short-sightedness on Fuller's part".&lt;ref name="2008NewHumanist"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1856| title=Origin of the specious | publisher=[[New Humanist]] |date=September 2008  | first=A.C. | last= Grayling  | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, Fuller wrote an online response saying "if Grayling's grasp of the history of science went beyond head-banging standards, he would realise that our current level of scientific achievement would never have been reached, and more importantly that we would not be striving to achieve more, had chance-based explanations dominated over the design-based ones in our thinking about reality."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1880 | title=Against the faith | publisher=[[New Humanist]] |date=September 2008  | first=Steve | last=Fuller | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; To which Grayling wrote: "Steve Fuller complains, as do all authors whose books are panned, that I did not read his book properly (or at all)."&lt;ref name="2008NewHumanistWeb"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1881 | title=Bolus of nonsense| publisher=[[New Humanist]] |date=September 2008  | first=A.C. | last= Grayling  | accessdate =10 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued, "I'll take on Fuller any day regarding the history and theology of the various versions of Christianity with which humanity has been burdened.

'''Subsurface engineers''' (also known as Completion engineers&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.myoilandgascareer.com/role/completions-engineer|title=Completions Engineer Oil &amp; Gas Careers {{!}} myOilandGasCareer.com|last=Career|first=My Oil and Gas|website=www.myoilandgascareer.com|access-date=2018-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are a subset within [[Petroleum Engineering]] and typically work closely with [[Drilling engineers]]. The job of a Subsurface Engineer is to effectively select equipment that will best suit the subsurface environment in order to best produce the hydrocarbon reserves. Once the hardware has been selected, a Subsurface Engineer will monitor and adjust the equipment to ensure the well and reservoir produces under ideal circumstances.

== Overview ==
Subsurface engineers must design a successful well completion system by selecting equipment that is adequate for both downhole environments and applications. Considerations must be given to the various functions under which the completion equipment must operate and the effects any changes in temperatures or differential pressure will have on the equipment. The completion system must also be efficient and cost effective to achieve maximum production and financial goals. Another factor in the selection of specific completion equipment is the production rates of the well.The typical job duties of a Subsurface engineer include managing the interface between the reservoir and the well, including perforations, [[sand control]], [[artificial lift]], [[downhole flow control]], and [[downhole monitoring equipment]]. Additional responsibilities of a Subsurface engineer include: performing a cost and risk analysis on the design, contacting vendors for the rental, purchase, and shipment of equipment, and working closely with fellow employees ([[geologists]], [[reservoir engineers]], [[drilling engineers]], and [[Petroleum production engineering|production engineers]]).

The [[Society of Petroleum Engineers]] (SPE) has technical disciplines which allow SPE members to focus their attention on the technical activities that most interest them. Drilling and Completions historically have been intertwined work within [[Petroleum Engineering]]. In 2016, SPE split the Drilling and Completions technical disciplines so SPE members would be able to focus more on Drilling or Completions&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wellez.com/spe-splits-drilling-completion/|title=SPE Splits Drilling &amp; Completion Disciplines as Operators Increase Focus on Completion Technologies - WellEz|date=2016-06-07|work=WellEz|access-date=2018-03-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. SPE continues to publish the SPE Drilling &amp; Completions journal&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.onepetro.org/journals/SPE%20Drilling%20-%20Completion/Preprint/Preprint|title=SPE Drilling &amp; Completion|last=|first=|date=13 March 2018|website=OnePetro|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=13 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, it has been publishing the journal since 1993.

== Design Components ==
The design components considered to perform a well completion may include:
*Cost and risk analysis
*Determining the specifications for the wellbore clean-out
*Use of specific Packer assemblies
*Determining specific tool selection to operate equipment within the well
*Assess possible equipment load specifications and incorporation of safety factors
*Best use of flow control accessories (sliding sleeves and safety valves)
*Determining the appropriate perforating shots per foot and charges based on the target formations
*Acidifying the formation to inhibit flow of hydrocarbons
*Sand Control operations to increase production
*Prevention of formation sand production with the use of wire screens
*Review Well logs to determine equipment placement within the well
*Determination of specific production pipe regarding well flow rates
*Selection of equipment to maintain well stability
*Oversee completion operations

'''Super-dense water''' is water that has been contained in an environment with both molecular uniformity and extreme depth, which causes the [[molecules]] of water to be packed tightly together and thus gain a tougher solidity and higher density than regular ice.  Super dense water is found on [[planet]]s, such as the moons [[Tethys (moon)|Tethys]], [[Ganymede (moon)|Ganymede]], [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]], and [[Europa (moon)|Europa]] in the [[Solar System]], which are covered entirely in water and have little to no [[landmass]].

==Speculation==
Speculation exists that a planet located at around 30 [[light-year]]s away from [[Earth]] may contain super-dense water. See [[ocean planet]] for more information on its formation.
It is also speculated that super-dense water is located in Towradgi, New South Wales.

In [[computer science]], '''synchronization''' refers to one of two distinct but related concepts: synchronization of [[Process (computer science)|processes]], and synchronization of [[Dataset|data]]. ''Process synchronization'' refers to the idea that multiple processes are to join up or [[Handshaking|handshake]] at a certain point, in order to reach an agreement or commit to a certain sequence of action. ''[[Data synchronization]]'' refers to the idea of keeping multiple copies of a dataset in coherence with one another, or to maintain [[data integrity]]. Process synchronization primitives are commonly used to implement data synchronization.

== The need for synchronization ==
The need for synchronization does not arise merely in multi-processor systems but for any kind of concurrent processes; even in single processor systems. Mentioned below are some of the main needs for synchronization:

''[[Fork-join model|Forks and Joins]]:'' When a job arrives at a fork point, it is split into N sub-jobs which are then serviced by n tasks. After being serviced, each sub-job waits until all other sub-jobs are done processing. Then, they are joined again and leave the system. Thus, in parallel programming, we require synchronization as all the parallel processes wait for several other processes to occur.

''[[Producer–consumer problem|Producer-Consumer:]]'' In a producer-consumer relationship, the consumer process is dependent on the producer process till the necessary data has been produced.

''Exclusive use resources:'' When multiple processes are dependent on a resource and they need to access it at the same time the operating system needs to ensure that only one processor accesses it at a given point in time.This reduces  concurrency.

==Thread or process synchronization==
[[File:Multiple Processes Accessing the shared resource.png|thumb|'''Figure 1''': Three processes accessing a shared resource ([[critical section]]) simultaneously.]]

Thread synchronization is defined as a mechanism which ensures that two or more concurrent [[process (computer science)|processes]] or [[thread (computer science)|threads]] do not simultaneously execute some particular program segment known as [[critical section]]. Processes' access to critical section is controlled by using synchronization techniques. When one thread starts executing the [[critical section]] (serialized segment of the program) the other thread should wait until the first thread finishes. If proper synchronization techniques&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite conference
  |   title=More than you ever wanted to know about synchronization: Synchrobench, measuring the impact of the synchronization on concurrent algorithms
  |   author=Gramoli, V.
  |   conference=Proceedings of the 20th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles and Practice of Parallel Programming
  |   pages=1–10

}}&lt;/ref&gt; are not applied, it may cause a [[race condition#Software|race condition]] where the values of variables may be unpredictable and vary depending on the timings of [[context switch]]es of the processes or threads.

For example, suppose that there are three processes, namely 1, 2, and 3. All three of them are concurrently executing, and they need to share a common resource (critical section) as shown in Figure 1. Synchronization should be used here to avoid any conflicts for accessing this shared resource. Hence, when Process 1 and 2 both try to access that resource, it should be assigned to only one process at a time.  If it is assigned to Process 1, the other process (Process 2) needs to wait until Process 1 frees that resource (as shown in Figure 2).

[[File:Shared Resource access in synchronization environment.png|thumb|'''Figure 2''': A process accessing a shared resource if available, based on some synchronization technique.]]

Another synchronization requirement which needs to be considered is the order in which particular processes or threads should be executed. For example, we cannot board a plane until we buy a ticket.  Similarly, we cannot check e-mails without validating our credentials (i.e., user name and password). In the same way, an ATM will not provide any service until we provide it with a correct PIN.

Other than mutual exclusion, synchronization also deals with the following:
* [[deadlock]], which occurs when many processes are waiting for a shared resource (critical section) which is being held by some other process. In this case, the processes just keep waiting and execute no further;
* [[Resource starvation|starvation]], which occurs when a process is waiting to enter the critical section, but other processes monopolize the critical section, and the first process is forced to wait indefinitely;
* [[priority inversion]], which occurs when a high-priority process is in the critical section, and it is interrupted by a medium-priority process. This violation of priority rules can happen under certain circumstances and may lead to serious consequences in real-time systems;
* [[busy waiting]], which occurs when a process frequently polls to determine if it has access to a critical section. This frequent polling robs processing time from other processes.

==Minimizing synchronization==
One of the challenges for exascale algorithm design is to minimize or reduce synchronization. 
Synchronization takes more time than computation, especially in distributed computing. Reducing synchronization drew attention from computer scientists for decades. Whereas it becomes an increasingly significant problem recently as the gap between the improvement of computing and latency increases. Experiments have shown that (global) communications due to synchronization on a distributed computers takes a dominated share in a sparse iterative solver.&lt;ref&gt;

}}
&lt;/ref&gt; for ranking the top 500 supercomputers.

===Classic problems of synchronization===
The following are some classic problems of synchronization:
* [[Producer–consumer problem|The Producer–Consumer Problem]] (also called The Bounded Buffer Problem);
* [[Readers–writers problem|The Readers–Writers Problem]];
* [[Dining philosophers problem|The Dining Philosophers Problem]].

These problems are used to test nearly every newly proposed synchronization scheme or primitive.

===Hardware synchronization===
Many systems provide hardware support for [[critical section]] code.

A single processor or [[uniprocessor system]] could disable [[interrupt]]s by executing currently running code without [[Preemption (computing)|preemption]], which is very inefficient on [[Multiprocessing|multiprocessor]] systems.&lt;ref name="Wiley2014"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silberschatz|first1=Abraham|last2=Gagne|first2=Greg|last3=Galvin|first3=Peter Baer|title=Operating System Concepts|date=July 11, 2008|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|isbn=978-0-470-12872-5|edition=Eighth|chapter=Chapter 6: Process Synchronization}}&lt;/ref&gt;
"The key ability we require to implement synchronization in a multiprocessor is a set of hardware primitives with the ability to atomically read and modify a memory location. Without such a capability, the cost of building basic synchronization primitives will be too high and will increase as the processor count increases. There are a number of alternative formulations of the basic hardware primitives, all of which provide the ability to atomically read and modify a location, together with some way to tell if the read and write were performed atomically. These hardware primitives are the basic building blocks that are used to build a wide variety of user-level synchronization operations, including things such as [[Lock (computer science)|locks]] and [[Barrier (computer science)|barriers]]. In general, architects do not expect users to employ the basic hardware primitives, but instead expect that the primitives will be used by system programmers to build a synchronization library, a process that is often complex and tricky."&lt;ref name="Morgan2011"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hennessy|first1=John L.|last2=Patterson|first2=David A.|title=Computer Architecture: A Quantitative Approach|date=September 30, 2011|publisher=Morgan Kaufmann|isbn=978-0-123-83872-8|edition=Fifth|chapter=Chapter 5: Thread-Level Parallelism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many modern hardware provides special atomic hardware instructions by either [[test-and-set]] the memory word or [[compare-and-swap]] contents of two memory words.

===Synchronization strategies in programming languages===
In [[Java (programming language)|Java]], to prevent thread interference and memory consistency errors, blocks of code are wrapped into '''synchronized''' ''(lock_object)'' sections. This forces any thread to acquire the said lock object before it can execute the block. The lock is automatically released when the thread which acquired the lock, and is then executing the block, leaves the block or enters the waiting state within the block. Any variable updates, made by a thread in a synchronized block, become visible to other threads when they similarly acquire the lock and execute the block.

Java ''synchronized'' blocks, in addition to enabling mutual exclusion and memory consistency,  enable signaling—i.e., sending events from threads which have acquired the lock and are executing the code block to those which are waiting for the lock within the block. This means that Java synchronized sections combine functionality of mutexes and events. Such primitive is known as [[Monitor (synchronization)|synchronization monitor]].

Any object may be used as a lock/monitor in Java. The declaring object is a lock object when the whole method is marked with ''synchronized''.

The [[.NET framework]] has synchronization primitives. "Synchronization is designed to be cooperative, demanding that every thread or process follow the synchronization mechanism before accessing protected resources (critical section) for consistent results." In .NET, locking, signaling, lightweight synchronization types, spinwait and interlocked operations are some of mechanisms related to synchronization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Synchronization Primitives in .NET framework|url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/ms228964%28v=vs.110%29.aspx|website=MSDN, The Microsoft Developer Network|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=23 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Implementation of Synchronization ===

==== Spinlock ====
{{Main article|Spinlock}}
Another effective way of implementing synchronization is by using spinlocks. Before accessing any shared resource or piece of code, every processor checks a flag. If the flag is reset, then the processor sets the flag and continues executing the thread. But, if the flag is set (locked), the threads would keep spinning in a loop and keep checking if the flag is set or not. But, spinlocks are effective only if the flag is reset for lower cycles otherwise it can lead to performance issues as it wastes many processor cycles waiting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Embedded Software Development with ECos|last=Massa|first=Anthony|publisher=Pearson Education Inc|year=2003|isbn=0- 13-035473-2|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Barriers ====
{{Main article|Barrier (computer science)}}
Barriers are simple to implement and provide good responsiveness. They are based on the concept of implementing wait cycles to provide synchronization. Consider three threads running simultaneously, starting from barrier 1. After time t, thread1 reaches barrier 2 but it still has to wait for thread 2 and 3 to reach barrier2 as it does not have the correct data. Once all the threads reach barrier 2 they all start again. After time t, thread 1 reaches barrier3 but it will have to wait for threads 2 and 3 and the correct data again.

Thus, in barrier synchronization of multiple threads there will always be a few threads that will end up waiting for other threads as in the above example thread 1 keeps waiting for thread 2 and 3. This results in severe degradation of the process performance.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Meng, Chen, Pan, Yao, Wu|first=Jinglei, Tianzhou, Ping, Jun. Minghui|date=2014|title=A speculative mechanism for barrier sychronization|url=|journal=2014 IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing and Communications (HPCC), 2014 IEEE 6th International Symposium on Cyberspace Safety and Security (CSS) and 2014 IEEE 11th International Conference on Embedded Software and Systems (ICESS)|volume=|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrier synchronization wait function for i&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; thread can be represented as:

(Wbarrier)i = f ((Tbarrier)i, (Rthread)i)

Where Wbarrier is the wait time for a thread, Tbarrier is the number of threads has arrived, and Rthread is the arrival rate of threads.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=M. M.|first=Rahman|date=2012|title=Process synchronization in multiprocessor and multi-core processor|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org.prox.lib.ncsu.edu/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=6317471&amp;isnumber=6317321|journal=Informatics, Electronics &amp; Vision (ICIEV), 2012 International Conference|volume=|issue=|doi=10.1109/ICIEV.2012.6317471|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Experiments show that 34% of the total execution time is spent in waiting for other slower threads.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Semaphores ====
{{Main article|Semaphore (programming)}}
Semaphores are signalling mechanisms which can allow one or more threads/processors to access a section. A Semaphore has a flag which has a certain fixed value associated with it and each time a thread wishes to access the section, it decrements the flag. Similarly, when the thread leaves the section, the flag is incremented. If the flag is zero, the thread cannot access the section and gets blocked if it chooses to wait.

Some semaphores would allow only one thread or process in the code section. Such Semaphores are called binary semaphore and are very similar to Mutex. Here, if the value of semaphore is 1, the thread is allowed to access and if the value is 0, the access is denied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Real-Time Concepts for Embedded Systems|last=Li, Yao|first=Qing, Carolyn|publisher=CMP Books|year=2003|isbn=1578201241|location=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mathematical foundations ===
Synchronization was originally a process-based concept whereby a lock could be obtained on an object. Its primary usage was in databases. There are two types of (file) [[File locking|lock]]; read-only and read–write. Read-only locks may be obtained by many processes or threads. Readers–writer locks are exclusive, as they may only be used by a single process/thread at a time.

Although locks were derived for file databases, data is also shared in memory between processes and threads. Sometimes more than one object (or file) is locked at a time. If they are not locked simultaneously they can overlap, causing a deadlock exception.

[[Java (programming language)|Java]] and [[Ada (programming language)|Ada]] only have exclusive locks because they are thread based and rely on the [[compare-and-swap]] processor instruction.

An abstract mathematical foundation for synchronization primitives is given by the [[history monoid]]. There are also many higher-level theoretical devices, such as [[process calculi]] and [[Petri net]]s, which can be built on top of the history monoid.

===Synchronization examples===
Following are some synchronization examples with respect to different platforms.&lt;ref name="Wiley2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Silberschatz|first1=Abraham|last2=Gagne|first2=Greg|last3=Galvin|first3=Peter Baer|title=Operating System Concepts|date=December 7, 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons.|isbn=978-1-118-06333-0|edition=Ninth|chapter=Chapter 5: Process Synchronization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Synchronization in Windows====
[[Windows]] provides:
* [[Interrupt|interrupt masks]], which protect access to global resources (critical section) on uniprocessor systems;
* [[spinlock]]s, which prevent, in multiprocessor systems, spinlocking-thread from being preempted;
* [[dispatcher]]s, which act like [[mutual exclusion|mutex]]es, [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]], [[Event (computing)|event]]s, and [[timer]]s.

====Synchronization in Linux====
[[Linux]] provides:
* [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]];
* [[spinlock]];
* [[barrier (computer science)|barrier]]s
* [[mutual exclusion|mutex]]
* [[readers–writer lock]]s, for the longer section of codes which are accessed very frequently but don't change very often.
* [[Read-copy-update]] (RCU) &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lwn.net/Articles/262464/|title=What is RCU, Fundamentally? [LWN.net]|author=|date=|website=lwn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enabling and disabling of kernel preemption replaced spinlocks on uniprocessor systems. Prior to kernel version 2.6, [[Linux]] disabled interrupt to implement short critical sections. Since version 2.6 and later, Linux is fully preemptive.

====Synchronization in Solaris====
[[Solaris (operating system)|Solaris]] provides:
* [[Semaphore (programming)|semaphores]];
* [[condition variable]]s;
* [[adaptive mutex]]es, binary semaphores that are implemented differently depending upon the conditions;
* readers–writer locks:
* [[turnstiles]], queue of threads which are waiting on acquired lock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunsite.uakom.sk/sunworldonline/swol-08-1999/swol-08-insidesolaris.html|title=Turnstiles and priority inheritance - SunWorld - August 1999|first=Jim|last=Mauro|date=|website=sunsite.uakom.sk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pthreads synchronization====
[[Pthreads]] is a platform-independent [[API]] that provides:
* mutexes;
* condition variables;
* readers–writer locks;
* spinlocks;
* [[barrier (computer science)|barrier]]s.

==Data synchronization ==
{{main article|Data synchronization}}
[[File:Data Synchronization.png|thumb|'''Figure 3: '''Changes from both server and client(s) are synchronized.]]

A distinctly different (but related) concept is that of [[data synchronization]]. This refers to the need to keep multiple copies of a set of data coherent with one another or to maintain [[data integrity]], Figure 3. For example, database replication is used to keep multiple copies of data synchronized with database servers that store data in different locations.

Examples include:
* [[File synchronization]], such as syncing a hand-held MP3 player to a desktop computer;
* [[Cluster file system]]s, which are [[file system]]s that maintain data or indexes in a coherent fashion across a whole [[computing cluster]];
* [[Cache coherency]], maintaining multiple copies of data in sync across multiple [[cache (computing)|cache]]s;
* [[RAID]], where data is written in a redundant fashion across multiple disks, so that the loss of any one disk does not lead to a loss of data;
* [[Database replication]], where copies of data on a [[database]] are kept in sync, despite possible large geographical separation;
* [[Journaling file system|Journaling]], a technique used by many modern file systems to make sure that file metadata are updated on a disk in a coherent, consistent manner.

===Challenges in data synchronization===
Some of the challenges which user may face in data synchronization:
* data formats complexity;
* real-timeliness;
* data security;
* data quality;
* performance.

==== Data formats complexity ====
Data formats tend to grow more complex with time as the organization grows and evolves. This results not only in building simple interfaces between the two applications (source and target), but also in a need to transform the data while passing them to the target application. [[Extract, transform, load|ETL]] (extraction transformation loading) tools can be helpful at this stage for managing data format complexities.

====Real-timeliness====
In real-time systems, customers want to see the current status of their order in e-shop, the current status of a parcel delivery—a real time parcel tracking—, the current balance on their account, etc. This shows the need of a real-time system, which is being updated as well to enable smooth manufacturing process in real-time, e.g., ordering material when enterprise is running out stock, synchronizing customer orders with manufacturing process, etc. From real life, there exist so many examples where real-time processing gives successful and competitive advantage.

====Data security====
There are no fixed rules and policies to enforce data security. It may vary depending on the system which you are using. Even though the security is maintained correctly in the source system which captures the data, the security and information access privileges must be enforced on the target systems as well to prevent any potential misuse of the information. This is a serious issue and particularly when it comes for handling secret, confidential and personal information. So because of the sensitivity and confidentiality, data transfer and all in-between information must be encrypted.

====Data quality====
Data quality is another serious constraint. For better management and to maintain good quality of data, the common practice is to store the data at one location and share with different people and different systems and/or applications from different locations. It helps in preventing inconsistencies in the data.

====Performance====  
There are five different phases involved in the data synchronization process:
* [[data extraction]] from the source (or master, or main) system;
* [[data transfer]];
* [[data transformation]];
* data load to the target system.
* data updation

Each of these steps is critical. In case of large amounts of data, the synchronization process needs to be carefully planned and executed to avoid any negative impact on performance.

'''Systems modeling''' or '''system modeling''' is the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary study]] of the use of [[scientific modeling|model]]s to conceptualize and construct [[system]]s in [[business]] and [[Information technology|IT development]].&lt;ref name="PAW06"&gt;[http://lamswww.epfl.ch/people/wegmann/ Research interests] Professor [[Alain Wegmann]], Last changed 2006-12-01. Retrieved June 19, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

A common type of systems modeling is [[function model]]ing, with specific techniques such as the [[Functional Flow Block Diagram]] and [[IDEF0]]. These models can be extended using [[functional decomposition]], and can be linked to [[requirement]]s models for further systems partition.

Contrasting the functional modeling, another type of systems modeling is [[systems architecture|architectural modeling]] which uses the [[systems architecture]] to conceptually model the [[structure]], [[behavior]], and more [[view model|views]] of a system.

The [[Business Process Modeling Notation]] (BPMN), a graphical representation for specifying business processes in a workflow, can also be considered to be a systems modeling language.

== Overview ==
In business and IT development the term "systems modeling" has multiple meanings. It can relate to:
* the use of [[scientific modeling|model]] to conceptualize and construct systems
* the [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary study]] of the use of these models
* the systems modeling, [[systems analysis|analysis]], and [[systems design|design]] efforts 
* the systems modeling and [[simulation]], such as [[system dynamics]]
* any specific systems [[modeling language]]
As a field of study systems modeling has emerged with the development of [[system theory]] and [[systems sciences]].

As a type of [[scientific modeling|modeling]] systems modeling is based on [[systems thinking]] and the systems approach. In business and IT systems modeling contrasts other approaches such as:
* [[agent based modeling]] 
* [[data modeling]] and 
* [[mathematical modeling]]
In "Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge" (1997) [[Ingeman Arbnor|Arbnor]] and [[Björn Bjerke|Bjerke]] the systems approach (systems modeling) was considered to be one of the three basic methodological approaches for gaining business knowledge, beside the analytical approach and the actor's approach (agent based modeling).&lt;ref&gt;Ingeman Arbnor, Bjorn Bjerke (2007). ''Methodology for Creating Business Knowledge''. Sage Publications, Inc, 1997. Back cover.&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The function model originates in the 1950s, after in the first half of the 20th century other types of management diagrams had already been developed. The first known [[Gantt chart]] was developed in 1896 by [[Karol Adamiecki]], who called it a ''harmonogram''. Because Adamiecki did not publish his chart until 1931 - and in any case his works were published in either Polish or Russian, languages not popular in [[Western world|the West]] - the chart now bears the name of  [[Henry Gantt]] (1861–1919), who designed his chart around the years 1910-1915 and popularized it in the West.&lt;ref&gt;H.L. Gantt, ''Work, Wages and Profit'', published by the ''[[Engineering Magazine]]'', New York, 1910; republished as ''Work, Wages and Profits'', Easton, Pennsylvania, Hive Publishing Company, 1974, {{ISBN|0-87960-048-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first well defined function models, was the [[Functional Flow Block Diagram]] (FFBD) developed by the defense-related [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] Incorporated in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;Tim Weilkiens (2008). ''Systems Engineering with SysML/UML: Modeling, Analysis, Design''. Page 287.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s it was exploited by the [[NASA]] to visualize the time sequence of events in a space systems and flight missions.&lt;ref&gt;[[Harold Chestnut]] (1967). ''Systems Engineering Methods''. Page 254.&lt;/ref&gt; It is further widely used in classical [[systems engineering]] to show the order of execution of system functions.&lt;ref name="TD03"&gt;Thomas Dufresne &amp; James Martin (2003). [http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc "Process Modeling for E-Business"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061220024049/http://mason.gmu.edu/~tdufresn/paper.doc |date=2006-12-20 }}. INFS 770 Methods for Information Systems Engineering:  Knowledge Management and E-Business. Spring 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest pioneering works in [[information system]]s modeling&lt;ref name="JAB07"&gt;[[Janis A. Bubenko jr]] (2007) "From Information Algebra to Enterprise Modelling and Ontologies - a Historical Perspective on Modelling for Information Systems". In: ''Conceptual Modelling in Information Systems Engineering''. [[:w:John Krogstie|John Krogstie]] et al. eds. pp 1-18&lt;/ref&gt; has been done by Young and Kent (1958), who argued:

:''Since we may be called upon to evaluate different computers or to find alternative ways of organizing current systems it is necessary to have some means of precisely stating a data processing problem independently of mechanization.''&lt;ref&gt;Young, J. W., and Kent, H. K. (1958). "Abstract Formulation of Data Processing Problems". In: ''Journal of Industrial Engineering''. Nov-Dec 1958. 9(6), pp. 471-479&lt;/ref&gt;

They aimed for a precise and abstract way of specifying the informational and time characteristics of a [[data processing]] problem, and wanted to create a notation that should enable the [[Systems analyst|analyst]] to organize the problem around any piece of [[computer hardware|hardware]]. Their efforts was not so much focussed on independent systems analysis, but on creating abstract specification and invariant basis for designing different alternative implementations using different hardware components.&lt;ref name="JAB07"/&gt;

A next step in IS modeling was taken by [[CODASYL]], an IT industry consortium formed in 1959, who essentially aimed at the same thing as Young and Kent: the development of "a proper structure for machine independent problem definition language, at the system level of data processing". This led to the development of a specific IS [[information algebra]].&lt;ref name="JAB07"/&gt;

== Types of systems modeling ==
In business and IT development systems are modeled with different scopes and scales of complexity, such as:
* [[Functional model]]ing
* [[Systems architecture]]
* [[Business process modeling]]
* [[Enterprise modeling]]

Further more like [[systems thinking]], systems modeling in can be divided into:
* [[Systems analysis]]
* [[Hard systems]] modeling or [[operational research]] modeling 
* [[Soft system modeling]] 
And all other specific types of systems modeling, such as form example [[complex systems]] modeling, [[dynamical systems]] modeling, and [[critical systems thinking|critical systems]] modeling.

'''Technological rationality''' or '''technical rationality''' is a philosophical idea postulated by the  [[Frankfurt School]] philosopher [[Herbert Marcuse]] in his 1941 article, "Some Implications of Modern Technology", published first in the journal Studies in Philosophy and Social Sciences, Vol. IX. It gained mainstream repute and a more holistic treatment in his 1964 book ''[[One-Dimensional Man]]''. 

It posits that [[Rationality|rational]] decisions to incorporate [[technology|technological]] advances into society can, once the technology is ubiquitous, change what is considered rational within that society.

'''The College at Southeastern''' (abbreviated "C@SE") is a [[Christian]] [[liberal arts]] college located in [[Wake Forest, North Carolina]]. Established in 1994, it serves as the undergraduate school for [[Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sebts.edu/college/about/history.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; Both of the Southeastern schools are affiliated with the [[Southern Baptist Convention]]. The school is accredited by the [[Southern Association of Colleges and Schools]].&lt;ref&gt;http://sebts.edu/college/about/accreditation.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==

Both of the Southeastern schools are affiliated with the Southern Baptist Convention. The college is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools. The College at Southeastern combines the best of a liberal arts college education with substantial biblical and theological training.

The mission of the college is "to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ by equipping students to serve the church and fulfill the Great Commission."

While Southeastern equips young men for pastoral ministry, the college also equips missionaries, counselors, teachers, youth pastors and others who spread the Gospel across the street and around the world.

Approximately 500 Southeastern college and seminary students and graduates currently serve as foreign missionaries, the vast majority through the International Mission Board. Dozens of graduates serve as North American church planters in urban centers such as Boston, Chicago, Tampa, Atlanta, Richmond and Nashville, as well as underserved rural areas in the Midwest and New England.

Hundreds of Southeastern students from the college and seminary participate annually in short-term mission trips sponsored by the seminary or local churches. Numerous Southeastern professors regularly lead mission trips or teach short-term in overseas settings.

Enrollment is currently approximately 3,250 students including the College at Southeastern and Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary. Students come from 49 states and are citizens of 33 countries. The College’s current enrollment is approximately 650 students.

== Academics ==

Students can select one of 10 majors and 15 minors and are equipped to employ their Christian worldview in whatever vocation God has called them to serve. Students pursuing a four-year Bachelor of Arts degree will complete a core curriculum, which includes vital training in biblical studies, Christian worldview, world history, theology and English. Students enrolled in the Bachelor of Arts program complete a minor in Christian studies in addition to their selected major.  C@SE also offers a small variety of associate degree programs and certificate programs.

==History==

Southeastern Seminary opened its doors in 1950 on the [[Wake Forest University|Wake Forest College]] campus with a relative handful of students and a mandate to train ministers for churches all over the east coast of the United States. In the nearly sixty years since then the student body has grown considerably and its reach has expanded across the entire globe.

The College at Southeastern began in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;http://collegeatsoutheastern.com/admissions/default.aspx{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to accommodate the school’s increasing enrollment trustees approved construction of a new academic building at their October 2005 meeting. Since its completion in 2008, Paige and Dorothy Patterson Hall is now the flagship academic building on campus. Patterson Hall houses the Center for Faith and Culture, The College at Southeastern and the school’s doctoral programs.

The Southeastern Board of Trustees elected to change the name of the college from Southeastern College at Wake Forest to the College at Southeastern in April 2008.

In January 2009, Dr. Bruce R. Ashford was installed as dean of The College at Southeastern. He made several important changes during his first few month including new curriculum like minors in leadership and student ministry.

Dr. Jamie Dew succeeded Ashford in January 2013 as the dean of the college.

The College at Southeastern is marked by Ashford and Dew’s vision to give greater flexibility to students’ academic pursuits. The History of Ideas Program engages students to research and read classical works that have shaped history from a Christian perspective. New majors were added such as Global Studies, Missions, Pre-Law, History, Biblical Studies and Worship Ministry.

==Faculty==

The faculty at Southeastern promises to teach in accordance with, and not contrary to, the Abstract of Principles and the Baptist Faith &amp; Message. The school further affirms the Chicago Statement on Biblical Inerrancy and the Danvers Statement on Biblical Manhood and Womanhood.

The school aims to see students become effective disciples of Christ.

; Independent countries: This category has independent countries, which the CIA defines as people "politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory".&lt;ref name="ents"/&gt; In this category, there are 195 entities.
; Others: The ''Other'' category is a list of other places set apart from the list of independent countries. Currently there are two: [[Taiwan]] and the [[European Union]].
; Dependencies and Areas of Special Sovereignty: This category is a list of places affiliated with another country. They may be subdivided into categories using the country they are affiliated with:

:*[[France]]: eight entities
:*[[Netherlands]]: three entities
:*[[New Zealand]]: three entities
:*[[Norway]]: three entities

The Factbook is full of usually minor errors, inaccuracies, and out-of-date information, which are often repeated elsewhere due to the ''Factbook''{{'}}s widespread use as a reference.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}}{{dubious|date=April 2018}} For example, [[Albania]] was until recently, described in the ''Factbook'' as 70% [[Muslim]], 20% [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox]], and 10% [[Roman Catholic]], which was based on a survey conducted in 1939, before [[World War II]]; numerous surveys conducted since the fall of the Communist regime since 1990 have given quite different figures.{{citation needed|date=April 2018}} Another example is [[Singapore]], which the ''Factbook'' states has a [[total fertility rate]] of 0.78 children per woman, despite figures in Statistics Singapore which state that the rate has been about 1.2–1.3 children per woman for at least the past several years, and it is unclear when, or even whether, it ever dropped as low as 0.78.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html#14 Statistics Singapore – Latest Data] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141105202002/http://www.singstat.gov.sg/statistics/latest_data.html |date=2014-11-05 }}.

In June 2009, [[National Public Radio]] (NPR), relying on information obtained from the ''CIA World Factbook'', put the number of Israeli Jews living in settlements in the [[West Bank]] and Israeli-annexed [[East Jerusalem]] at 250,000. However, a better estimate, based on [[United States Department of State|State Department]] and Israeli sources put the figure at about 500,000. NPR then issued a correction. Chuck Holmes, foreign editor for NPR Digital, said, "I'm surprised and displeased, and it makes me wonder what other information is out-of-date or incorrect in the CIA ''World Factbook''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/ombudsman/2010/06/01/127349281/cia-gets-the-numbers-wrong

'''''The Worship of the Serpent''''' by [[John Bathurst Deane]] is an 1833 study of [[snake worship]] and specifically the snake mentioned in the [[Book of Genesis]] who convinced [[Eve]] to eat the fruit of the [[Tree of the Knowledge of Good and Evil]], leading her to convince [[Adam]] to do the same.

==Overview==
A number of [[Gnostic]] texts, some only discovered recently such as those from the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] expound on an idea of knowledge and how the serpent gave knowledge to man. Deane draws a number of conclusions and makes certain guesses regarding snake worship, not just confined to Europe, but indeed all over the world. Deane goes on in his title to list a number of associations to the serpent such as the [[dragon]] and the [[leviathan]]. So thorough (albeit outdated) is his research, that he has "traced THE WORSHIP OF THE SERPENT from Babylonia, east and west, through Persia, Hindûstan, China, Mexico, Britain, Scandinavia, Italy, Illyricum, Thrace, Greece, Asia Minor, and Phœnicia." (Ch VIII)&lt;ref&gt;Colin Kidd,''The Forging of Races: Race and Scripture in the Protestant Atlantic World'' (2006), p. 120&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Brunnichia_ovata.jpg|right|thumb|[[Redvine]] (''Brunnichia ovata'') tendrils coil upon contact.]]
'''Thigmotropism''' is a directional growth movement which occurs as a mechanosensory response to a touch stimulus. Thigmotropism is typically found in [[Vines|twining plants]] and tendrils, however plant biologists have also found thigmotropic responses in flowering plants and fungi. This behavior occurs due to unilateral growth inhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mordecai|first=Jaffe|date=March 2002|title=Thigmo Responses in Plants and Fungi|url=|journal=American Journal of Botany|volume=89|pages=375–382|doi=10.3732/ajb.89.3.375}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the growth rate on the side of the stem which is being touched is slower than on the side opposite the touch. The resultant growth pattern is to attach and sometimes curl around the object which is touching the plant. However, flowering plants have also been observed to move or grow their sex organs toward a pollinator that lands on the flower, as in ''Portulaca grandiflora.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scorza|first=Livia Camilla Trevisan|last2=Dornelas|first2=Marcelo Carnier|date=2011-12-01|title=Plants on the move|journal=Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior|volume=6|issue=12|pages=1979–1986|doi=10.4161/psb.6.12.18192|issn=1559-2316|pmc=3337191|pmid=22231201}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physiological factors ==
Since growth is a complex developmental procedure, there are indeed many requirements (both biotic and abiotic) that are needed for both touch perception and a thigmotropic response to occur. One of these is calcium. In a series of experiments in 1995 using the tendril ''Bryonia dioica'', touch-sensing calcium channels were blocked using various antagonists. Responses to touch in treatment plants which received calcium channel inhibitors were diminished compared to control plants, indicating that calcium may be required for thigmotropism. Later in 2001, a membrane depolarization pathway was proposed in which calcium was involved: when a touch occurs, calcium channels open and calcium flows into the cell, shifting the electrochemical potential across the membrane. This triggers voltage-gated chloride and potassium channels to open and leads to an action potential that signals the perception of touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fasano|first=Jeremiah M.|last2=Massa|first2=Gioia D.|last3=Gilroy|first3=Simon|date=2002-06-01|title=Ionic Signaling in Plant Responses to Gravity and Touch|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s003440010049|journal=Journal of Plant Growth Regulation|language=en|volume=21|issue=2|pages=71–88|doi=10.1007/s003440010049|issn=0721-7595}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant growth hormone auxin has also been observed to be involved in thigmotropic behavior in plants, but its role is not well understood. Instead of asymmetric auxin distribution influencing other tropisms, it has been shown that a unidirectional thigmotropic response can occur even with a symmetric distribution of auxin. It has been proposed that the action potential arising from a touch stimulus leads to an increase of auxin in the cell, which causes the production of an contractile protein on the side of the touch that allows the plant to grip onto an object.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reinhold|first=Leonora|date=1967-11-10|title=Induction of Coiling in Tendrils by Auxin and Carbon Dioxide|url=http://science.sciencemag.org/content/158/3802/791|journal=Science|language=en|volume=158|issue=3802|pages=791–793|doi=10.1126/science.158.3802.791|issn=0036-8075|pmid=6048120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, it has been shown that when auxin (typically leading to growth ''away'' from the side of its localization) and a touch stimulus (causing a tropic response ''toward'' its localization) were applied on the same side of a cucumber hypocotyl, the stem will curve towards the touch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Takahashi|first=Hideyuki|last2=Jaffe|first2=Mordecai J.|date=1990-12-01|title=Thigmotropism and the modulation of tropistic curvature by mechanical perturbation in cucumber hypocotyls|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1399-3054.1990.tb05679.x/abstract|journal=Physiologia Plantarum|language=en|volume=80|issue=4|pages=561–567|doi=10.1111/j.1399-3054.1990.tb05679.x|issn=1399-3054}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like phototropism, a thigmotropic response in stems requires light. Plant biologist Mark Jaffe performed a simple preliminary experiment using pea plants that led to this conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=What a Plant Knows: A Field Guide to the Senses|last=Chamovitz|first=Daniel|publisher=Scientific American|year=2012|isbn=|location=New York|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt; He found that when he snipped a tendril off of a pea plant and placed it in the light, then repeatedly touched one side of it, the tendril would begin to curl. However, when performing this same experiment in the dark, the tendril would not curl.

== Thigmotropism in roots ==
[[Root]]s also rely on touch to navigate their way through the soil. Generally, roots have a negative touch response, meaning when they feel an object, they would grow away from the object. This allows the roots to go through the soil with minimum resistance. Because of this behavior, roots are said to be negatively thigmotropic. Thigmotropism seems to be able to override the strong [[gravitropic]] response of even primary roots. [[Charles Darwin]] performed experiments where he found that in a vertical bean root, a contact stimulus could divert the root away from the vertical.

==Misconception==
''[[Mimosa pudica]]'' is well known for its [[rapid plant movement]]. The leaves close up and droop when touched. However, this is not a form of [[tropism]], but a [[nastic movement]], a similar phenomenon. Nastic movements are non-directional responses to stimuli (e.g. temperature, humidity, light irradiance), and are usually associated with plants. &lt;ref&gt;En.wikipedia.org. (2017). Nastic movements. [online] Available at: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nastic_movements [Accessed 17 Aug. 2017].&lt;/ref&gt;

This '''timeline of the evolutionary history of life''' represents the current [[scientific theory]] outlining the major events during the development of [[life]] on planet [[Earth]]. In [[biology]], [[evolution]] is any change across successive generations in the heritable characteristics of biological populations. Evolutionary processes give rise to diversity at every level of [[biological organization]], from [[kingdom (biology)|kingdoms]] to [[species]], and individual [[organism]]s and [[molecule]]s, such as [[DNA]] and [[protein]]s. The similarities between all present day organisms indicate the presence of a [[common descent|common ancestor]] from which all known species, living and [[Extinction|extinct]], have diverged through the process of evolution. More than 99 percent of all species, amounting to over five billion species,&lt;ref name="Book-Biology"&gt;{{harvnb|McKinney|1997|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=4LHnCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110&amp;lpg=PA110&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false 110]}}&lt;/ref&gt; that ever lived on Earth are estimated to be extinct.&lt;ref name="StearnsStearns2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stearns |first=Beverly Peterson |last2=Stearns |first2=S.

While the dates given in this article are estimates based on [[scientific evidence]], there has been controversy between more traditional views of increased [[biodiversity]] through a cone of diversity with the passing of time and the view that the basic pattern on Earth has been one of annihilation and diversification and that in certain past times, such as the [[Cambrian explosion]], there was great diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.as.wvu.edu/~kgarbutt/EvolutionPage/Studentsites/Burgesspages/models_of_evolution.html |title=The Burgess Shale &amp; Models of Evolution |last1=Hickman |first1=Crystal |last2=Starn |first2=Autumn |website=Reconstructions of the Burgess Shale and What They Mean... |publisher=[[West Virginia University]] |location=Morgantown, WV |accessdate=2015-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Barton|Briggs|Eisen|Goldstein|2007|loc=[http://www.evolution-textbook.org/content/free/figures/10_EVOW_Art/20_EVOW_CH10.pdf Figure 10.20]}} Four diagrams of evolutionary models&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extinction ==
{{Main|Extinction event}}
[[File:Geological time spiral.png|thumb|right|240px|Visual representation of the history of life on Earth as a spiral]]
Species go extinct constantly as environments change, as organisms compete for environmental niches, and as genetic mutation leads to the rise of new species from older ones. Occasionally biodiversity on Earth takes a hit in the form of a [[mass extinction]] in which the extinction rate is much higher than usual.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontology/measuring-sixth-mass-extinction|title=Measuring the sixth mass extinction - Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; A large extinction-event often represents an accumulation of smaller extinction- events that take place in a relatively brief period of time.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth# |title=Archived copy |access-date=2016-08-09 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160816103516/http://www.bbc.co.uk/nature/history_of_the_earth# |archive-date=2016-08-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first known mass extinction in earth's history was the [[Great Oxygenation Event]] 2.4 billion years ago. That event led to the loss of most of the planet's [[obligate anaerobe]]s. Researchers have identified five major extinction events in earth's history since:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://cosmosmagazine.com/palaeontology/big-five-extinctions|title=The big five mass extinctions - Cosmos|website=cosmosmagazine.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* End of the [[Ordovician]]: 440 million years ago, 86% of all species lost, including [[graptolite]]s
* Late [[Devonian]]: 375 million years ago, 75% of species lost, including most [[trilobite]]s
* End of the [[Permian]], "The Great Dying": 251 million years ago, 96% of species lost, including [[tabulate coral]]s, and most extant trees and [[synapsid]]s
* End of the [[Triassic]]: 200 million years ago, 80% of species lost, including all of the [[conodont]]s
* End of the [[Cretaceous]]: 66 million years ago, 76% of species lost, including all of the [[ammonite]]s, [[mosasaur]]s, [[ichthyosaur]]s, [[plesiosaur]]s, [[pterosaur]]s, and nonavian [[dinosaur]]s

(Dates and percentages represent estimates.)

Smaller extinction-events have occurred in the periods between these larger catastrophes, with some standing at the delineation points of the periods and epochs recognized by scientists in [[Geologic time scale|geologic time]]. The [[Holocene extinction]] event is currently under way.&lt;ref name="pnas98_1"&gt;

The [[Phanerozoic]] Eon, literally the "period of well-displayed life," marks the appearance in the fossil record of abundant, shell-forming and/or trace-making organisms. It is subdivided into three eras, the [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]] and [[Cenozoic]], which are divided by major [[mass extinction]]s.

A '''transparency report''' is a statement issued on a regular basis by a [[company]], disclosing a variety of [[statistics]] related to requests for user [[data]], records, or content. Transparency reports generally disclose how frequently and under what authority [[government]]s have requested or demanded data or records over a certain period of time. This form of [[corporate transparency]] allows the public to discern what private information governments have gained access to through [[search warrant]]s and court [[subpoena]]s, among other methods. Some transparency reports describe how often, as a result of government action or under [[copyright]] provisions, content was removed. Disclosing a transparency report also helps people to know about the appropriate scope and authority of content regulation for online discussions.&lt;ref name=Google&gt;{{cite web|title=transparency report introduction|url=https://www.google.com/transparencyreport/removals/|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Google]] first launched a transparency report in 2010, with Twitter following in 2012. Additional companies began releasing transparency reports as during the aftermath of the [[Global surveillance disclosures (2013–present)|global surveillance disclosures beginning in 2013]], and the number of companies issuing them has increased rapidly ever since. Transparency reports are issued today by a variety of technology and communications companies, including [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Verizon]], [[AT&amp;T]], [[Twitter]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], [[Dropbox (service)|Dropbox]], [[Facebook]], [[Yahoo]] and [[CloudFlare]]. Several companies and advocacy groups have lobbied the [[U.S. government]] to allow the number of secret data requests (requests which include a [[gag order]]s - including [[National Security Letter]]s) to be described within ranges in the report. 

==Government demand increases in years==

===Google===
[[Google Search|Google's]] latest ''(10th)'' transparency report indicates that the government demands for data are increasing in recent years.This report shows demands from government in the first six months of 2014, and the firm said that it includes demands made under the US Foreign Intelligence, Surveillance Act (FISA) and through National Security Letters (NSLs).
"FISA and NSL demands have increased by 15 percent during the six months, according to the firm, and by 150 percent over the 10 reports and the five year reporting period. That's globally. In the US the figures for the same period are 19 percent and 250 percent."
[[Google]] legal director ''Richard Salgado'' accepted that the government has to fight crime and deal with threats, but the opposition of data demands need to be considered as well.
''"This increase in government demands comes against a backdrop of ongoing revelations about government surveillance programs. Despite these revelations, we have seen some countries expand their surveillance authorities in an attempt to reach service providers outside their borders,"'' he said.
''"Governments have a legitimate and important role in fighting crime and investigating national security threats. To maintain public confidence in both government and technology, we need legislative reform that ensures surveillance powers are transparent, reasonably scoped by law, and subject to independent oversight."''
The report shows that the US makes the most demands for Google users' data, and Google said that it made 12,539 requests that affected some 22,000 accounts. It added that it provided data in 84 percent of cases.

In the UK it said there were 1,535 requests covering 1,991 users or accounts, and [[Google]] provided data for 72 percent of the requests.&lt;ref name=google&gt;{{cite web|last1=Dave|first1=Neal|title=Google’s 10th transparency report shows government requests are rising|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/inquirer/news/2369323/google-s-10th-transparency-report-shows-government-requests-are-rising|accessdate=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Yahoo===
The latest Yahoo transparency report was released on 25 September 2014. The report states that 30,511 users were affected by 18,594 government data requests.,whereas 57,324 accounts were affected by 29,470 government requests.&lt;ref name=yahoo&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Government data request|url=https://transparency.yahoo.com/government-data-requests/index.htm|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, both of these figures do not include those secret requests sent by the FISA court. During the last six month from ''July 1, 2013, to December 31, 2013'', it received between 0 and 1998 FISA requests for user data, affecting up to 54,997 users (including national security letters). Comparing to the first sixth month from ''January 1, 2013 to June 30, 2013'', 32,997 accounts was affected. As we can see from the figures, although the total number of data request drop, the number of data request approved from the FISA court have increased significantly.
Overall, 41 percent of accounts affected by government data requests came from requests made by the U.S. government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Yahoo Data requests drop, but FISA stats are worrying|url=https://venturebeat.com/2014/09/25/yahoo-transparency-report-over-30k-government-data-requests-nearly-half-from-the-u-s/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purpose==
Transparency reports may be published for a variety of purposes. One purpose could be to clarify how much information governments ask for, how such requests are evaluated, and how the receiving entity chose to respond. This information may lead consumers to the conclusion that the report's publisher is more trustworthy.&lt;ref name=argument&gt;{{cite web|title=Transparency reports useful, but more info needed on 'digital searches'|url=http://www.scmagazine.com/transparency-reports-useful-but-more-info-needed-on-digital-searches/article/376751/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there is some debate about what transparency reports really reveal. Some critics argue that mere quantities of requests may mislead consumers, since most entities have little control over the number of requests they receive, the breadth of the requests they receive, or even the number of requests they ultimately comply with.&lt;ref name="transparency report"&gt;{{cite web|title=what transparency report don't tell us?|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2013/12/what-transparency-reports-dont-tell-us/282529/#disqus_thread|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Companies such as [[Google]], [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], [[Facebook]], and [[Twitter]] all release transparency reports, all of which list the type and number of government data requests each company receives. these reports include exact numbers and shed a bright light on government activity. The U.S. government will not, however, permit companies to report exact numbers for national security requests or the number of requests that came under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance (FISA) Section 702, Patriot Act Section 215, or national security letters.
Instead, they have to aggregate the numbers or provide a range. And that’s even if the government permits a company to publish that data. Google may publish national security letter information, but not FISA information. Facebook may publish FISA information, but it must lump such data in with NSL information. As a result, consumers cannot see the true figure for total government data requests.
Critics of this policy, such as the [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]], argue that there is no clear national security justification for blocking entities from releasing this information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why the transparency report is necessary in the fight for privacy|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/09/12/transparency-reports/|accessdate=21 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conflicts between government and company==

In June 2013, [[Google]] asked the Department of Justice for permission to disclose details about the number of FISA requests it receives. As a result, [[Microsoft]], [[Yahoo]], and [[Facebook]] followed suit immediately. However, the Department of Justice refused those requests, and they only provide the companies with a heavily redacted version of their arguments.
Here's what Google legal director Richard Salgado had to say about FISA requests:
''"We want to go even further. We believe it’s your right to know what kinds of requests and how many each government is making of us and other companies. However, the U.S. Department of Justice contends that U.S. law does not allow us to share information about some national security requests that we might receive. Specifically, the U.S. government argues that we cannot share information about the requests we receive (if any) under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. But you deserve to know."''&lt;ref name=conflicts&gt;{{cite news|title=Google slams U.S. government in latest transparency report|url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2063386/google-slams-u-s-government-in-latest-transparency-report.html|accessdate=22 October 2014|agency=PC WORLD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''“Our ability to speak has been restricted by laws that prohibit and even criminalize a service provider like us from disclosing the exact number of national security letters ('NSLs') and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ('FISA') court orders received - even if that number is zero.”''avian network's veep for legal Ben Lee has blogged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Twitter sues US government for right to disclose NOTHING|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2014/10/08/twitter_sues_us_government_for_right_to_disclose_nothing/|publisher=The register|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 7 October 2014, [[Twitter]] announce that there will be a lawsuit against the United States government for violating its First Amendment right to freedom of speech. The Transparency Report which would reveal how many national security letters (NSLs) and Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) orders [[Twitter]] receives. They provided a draft of the transparency report to the Department of Justice and discussed it for months. [[Twitter]] was still unable to get the permission for allowing them to publish even a redacted version of the report from the government.
The response form FBI for its stance is that the information Twitter wants to publish "is classified and cannot be publicly released", they also said according to the framework provided on 27 January 2014, Twitter is only permitted to qualify its description of the total number of accounts affected by all national security legal process it has received but it cannot quantify that description with specific detail that goes well beyond what is allowed under the 27th Jan 2014 framework and that discloses properly classified information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FBI response|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/r/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2014/10/07/National-Security/Graphics/Exhibit%205%20-%2020140909%20FBI%20Letter%20to%20Twitter.pdf|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

===About the government===
The United States government announced on 30 August 2013 that a transparency report which is in its own form will be released. Director of National Intelligence James Clapper announced the change on his office's [[Tumblr]] blog. He said that the decision will come naturally after President Barack Obama ordered the declassification of as much intelligence information as possible. Total numbers for national security letters, Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) business records requests, FISA one register/trap and trace requests will be stated in the transparency report. Beside that, the report will also include the number of targets being investigated in each of these requests. The number will reflect the 12 months prior to the date published.
The inspiration of the report comes from the recent surveillance program leaks from former NSA-contractor Edward Snowden, according to an anonymous source speaking with the ''Washington Post''.
[[Google]], [[Twitter]],and [[Facebook]] all release their own forms of transparency report, however they are not allowed to release this sort of information in their report.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Meghan Kelly|title=U.S. to release transparency report with FISA and national security requests|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/08/30/us-transparency-report/|accessdate=22 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A trophy or '''trophy of arms''' in art and architecture is a real or depicted artistically assembled display of weaponry and other militaria, often captured from a defeated enemy, as an [[Ornament (art)|ornament]] designed for the purpose of triumphalist display by a victor or as a show of military prowess by a monarch.&lt;ref&gt;Osborne, Harold, ''The Oxford Companion to Art'', Oxford, Clarendon Press, 1990, p. 1161-2&lt;/ref&gt; Similar decorative vertical arrangements of hunting accessories, musical instruments or other objects are also commonly referred to as trophies.

The term comes from the ancient Greek ''[[Tropaion]]'' and Roman equivalent ''Tropaeum'', military victories which were commemorated with a display of actual captured [[weapon|arms]], [[armour]] and [[Heraldic standard|standards]]. The use of trophies as an ornament in decoration became popular in the [[Italian Renaissance]], and as   an architectural element in [[relief]] or free-standing sculpture during the [[baroque]] era, where they are often used as a kind of [[finial]] to decorate rooflines, gate columns and other elements of buildings with military associations, which included most royal palaces.

The [[Triumphs of Caesar (Mantegna)|''Triumphs of Caesar'']] by [[Andrea Mantegna]] (1482–94, now [[Royal Collection]]) are a series of paintings of the [[Roman triumph]] of [[Julius Caesar]] that soon became enormously influential in [[old master print|print]] form.  They showed trophies carried on carts and on poles, and 
probably gave a big impetus to the trend for [[ornament print]]s of trophies, which were then copied into a range of media. 
   
==Origins==
The practice was used in the classical age by the Greeks and Romans.  [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'' relates the practice of warriors in the [[Trojan War]] removing the armour and weapons of a killed opponent in order to make an offering to the gods. This was contrasted to mere [[Treasure|booty]]. Trophies of arms were commonly depicted on Greek and Roman coins.

In England a tradition of making trophies of arms and armour, designed to display British military prowess, was established in the armoury of the [[Tower of London]] from the late 17th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalarmouries.org/tower-of-london/power-house/dragon]&lt;/ref&gt; In about 1700 John Harris created an impressive display in the Grand Storehouse which included a serpent and a seven-headed [[Lernaean Hydra|Hydra]], together with a variety of weapons including muskets, pistols and swords. The antiquarian William Maitland described it as a sight "no one ever beheld without astonishment...not to be matched perhaps in the world".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.royalarmouries.org/tower-of-london/power-house/dragon]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituent elements==
Elements commonly depicted within antique trophies of arms include:
*breastplates
*spears
*halberds
*bows
*arrows
*quivers
*lit torches
*swords
*cannon and balls
*captured military standards
*clubs

'''Values Modes''' is a [[Geodemographic segmentation|segmentation]] tool in the United Kingdom, based on the British Values Survey.

== Background ==
The Values Modes model was created in 1973, by Pat Dade and Les Higgins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/viewpoints/Ubuntu-BOTU.pdf |format=PDF |title=The Ubuntu - BOTU Struggle |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tool, which is owned by the company Cultural Dynamics, is used strategically in marketing and political campaigns. It divides the population by values, identifying three core groups: Settlers, Prospectors and Pioneers. It is the main subject of the book "What Makes People Tick",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rose|first1=Chris|title=What Makes People Tick?|date=2011|publisher=Matador|isbn=978 1848767 201}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Chris Rose.

== Methodology ==

=== Segmentation ===
The Values Modes tool is based on the premise of twelve discrete [[psychographic|psychographic types]], under three umbrella groups. These were developed using a combination of empirical research and the application of [[Abraham Maslow]]'s [[Maslow's hierarchy of needs|Hierarchy of Needs]].&lt;ref name="cultdyn1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/valuesmodes.html |title=CDSM Values Modes |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tracking ===
The British Values Survey asks a large sample of people a range of questions each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.campaignstrategy.org/articles/usingvaluemodes.pdf Using Values Modes], Chris Rose and Pat Dada, 2007, p.1&lt;/ref&gt; It uses their answers to track how values are changing. Researchers gauge shifts in the values composition of certain groups and track changes in the overall population.

=== Questions ===
The British Values Survey measures over 100 psychological attributes of individuals, and includes [[Shalom Schwartz]]'s [[Values scales]] model, which identifies ten core human values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], IPPR, October 2013, Nick Pecorelli, p.11-13&lt;/ref&gt; Questions are based on a simple [[Likert scale]]. They range from everyday concerns (i.e. "How much do you agree that products don't last as long as they used to?") to questions on social issues like the sentencing of criminals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/bvs.html |title=BVS |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Groups and sub-groups ==
There are three core umbrella groups, each of which contains four sub-groups.

|-
| Pioneer group – ''inner-directed'' || Pioneers are motivated by [[self-realisation]]. Their views are governed by values of [[collectivism]] and fairness. In their personal lives they are ambitious, but seek internal fulfilment rather than the esteem of others. || 'Transitionals','Flexible Individuals', [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM2.html ‘Concerned Ethicals’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM4.html ‘Transcenders’] || 32%

| Prospector group – ''outer-directed'' || Prospectors are driven by the esteem of others. They are motivated by success, status and recognition. They are usually younger and more optimistic. They are often conscious of fashion or image, and tend to be [[swing voters]]. || [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM8.html ‘Golden Dreamers’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM7.html ‘Happy Followers’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM6.html ‘Now people’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM5.html ‘Tomorrow people’] || 37%
|-
| Settler group – ''sustenance-driven'' || Settlers are motivated by resources and by fear of perceived threats. They tend to be older, [[socially conservative]] and security conscious. They are often pessimistic about the future, and are driven by immediate, local issues affecting them and their family. || [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM12.html ‘Roots’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM11.html ‘Smooth sailing’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM10.html ‘Brave New Worlders’], [http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/VMPages/VM9.html ‘Certainty First’] || 31%

==Uses of Values Modes==

===Organisational uses===
A person's 'values group' can affect how they view most issues, from the environment&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/CCEnV_Feb_2013.pdf |format=PDF |title=Climate Change, Energy and Values : Surveys in Five Countries |author=Chris Rose |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to taxation, immigration or economic and personal aspiration. Individuals with different values are said to perceive these issues differently, and are more amenable to certain changes. Values Modes is therefore used by some organisations to design policies, [[Behaviour Change Communication|behaviour change]] strategies and [[social marketing]] campaigns. It has been deployed in areas including [public health, recycling and road safety, and has particular usage among local authorities looking to build relations with residents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nlgn.org.uk/public/wp-content/uploads/Changing-Behaviours.pdf |format=PDF |title=NLGN : Changing Behaviours |author=Nigel Keohane |publisher=Nlgn.org |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Values Modes is also said to have business uses, and has also been applied to [[corporate governance]] in the past.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dominantneedsanalysis.com/images/corporategovernance,executivevalues,organisationalperforma%85.pdf] {{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person's values can also affect the language they respond best to. Prospectors, for example, are reportedly more open than Settlers to statistics-led messaging, and there are also often clashes between service providers, who tend to be Pioneers, and service-users, who are often Settlers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://thecampaigncompany.wordpress.com/2011/02/08/the-values-gap/ |title=The Values Gap &amp;#124; The Campaign Company Blog |publisher=Thecampaigncompany.wordpress.com |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Values Modes tool is therefore also used by some communications departments, to prevent “clashes” and to "tailor initiatives and messages to fit different value groups."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.rsablogs.org.uk/2012/social-economy/making-sense-world/ |title=Making sense of the world - RSA |publisher=Rsablogs.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Political uses ===
Analysts who use the Values Modes tool claim that, as class-based voting has "dealigned",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ippr.org/assets/media/images/media/files/publication/2011/09/still-partying-like-1995-110922_7983.pdf Still Partying Like it's 1995], IPPR, Graeme Cooke, September 2011, p.17&lt;/ref&gt; it provides a more accurate model of [[voting behaviour]] than segmentation based on race or ethnicity, or social class-based approaches such as [[Mosaic (geodemography)|Mosaic]] and [[ACORN (demographics)|ACORN]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.totalpolitics.com/campaigns/1328/speak-to-the-value-not-to-class.thtml |title=Speak to the Value Not to Class |publisher=Total Politics |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], p.8&lt;/ref&gt;

This has affected how analysts who use Values Modes view politics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Beyond-Class.pdf Beyond Class: The Motivational Values And  Political Affinities of British Voters], Chris Rose, April 2014&lt;/ref&gt; In the case of the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]], for example, it has been suggested that the distinction between [[Blue Labour|Blue]] and [[New Labour]] is largely a distinction between an appeal to Settler and Prospector values.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], p.44-45&lt;/ref&gt; The tool has also been used in the media to analyse [[Barack Obama]]'s victory in the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prabhu |first=Jaideep |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/politics/2012/10/new-america-gives-obama-hope |title=A new America gives Obama hope |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2012-10-12 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; to explore messaging in the film [[An Inconvenient Truth]], by [[Al Gore]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://journal.media-culture.org.au/index.php/mcjournal/article/viewArticle/175 Media and Culture Journal, Vol. 12, No. 4 (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt; and to inform the debate about the possibility of a UK [[Brexit]] from the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Prabhu |first=Jaideep |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/2014/02/no-again-all-things-euro |title=It’s no again to all things Euro: the rise of the new Eurosceptics |publisher=Newstatesman.com |date=2014-02-28 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This has led some to go further and link people's values to fundamental changes in [[Left-right politics|the political spectrum]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Chris Clarke |url=http://leftfootforward.org/2014/06/ukips-rise-isnt-the-end-of-politics/ |title=UKIP’s rise isn’t the end of politics – but it does mean the end of the left-right continuum |publisher=Left Foot Forward |date=2014-06-24 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; – although the three main [[UK political parties]] each have a fairly even mix of the three values groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Beyond-Class.pdf |format=PDF |title=Beyond Class: The Motivational Values And Political Affinities of British Voters |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===UKIP===
Some figures on the political left have used the Values Modes tool to try and understand the rise of [[UK Independence Party]] (UKIP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk/post/93886955583/ukip-and-the-migration-issue |title=UKIP and the migration issue &amp;#124; John Denham |publisher=Theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk |date=2014-08-05 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; – a political party with a predominantly Settler base (especially among those with Brave New World or Golden Dreamer values&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Council_Elections_2013.html |title=Council Elections |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which is built on preoccupations with issues like immigration. Nick Pecorelli argues that Labour lost many of its Settler supporters in office, and attributes the rise of UKIP, in part, to this change, writing that “Labour Settlers, once the bedrock of the party’s support, are gradually being dislodged from their tribal loyalties”.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf The New Electorate], p.31&lt;/ref&gt; Values Modes were used as part of a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] strategy on 'Beating Ukip on the Ground',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk/post/93887140448/beating-ukip-on-the-ground |title=Beating UKIP on the ground &amp;#124; John Denham |publisher=Theoptimisticpatriot.co.uk |date=2014-08-05 |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was incorporated into the Fabian Society paper, "Revolt on the Left".

==Changes to values==

===Within individuals===
The Values Modes tool is based on the premise that people switch between groups as life experiences change their values. If people's needs are met and goals are fulfilled they tend to make a transition through the groups.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/Beyond-Class.pdf Beyond Class], p.10&lt;/ref&gt; This shift usually takes the form of a move from Settler to Prospector to Pioneer, as immediate, sustenance-driven needs are replaces with more abstract concerns.

===Over time===
The British Values Survey indicates that, since data collection began, the proportion of the [[UK population]] in different values groups has changed significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.campaignstrategy.org/newsletters/values_dynamic_tippingpoint.pdf |format=PDF |title=A Values-Dynamic Tipping Point |author=Chris Rose |publisher=Campaignstrategy.org |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period 1973–2005 saw a shift away from Settler values&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cse.org.uk/pdf/sof1120.pdf Using Values Modes], p.1-4&lt;/ref&gt; – probably because of greater affluence meaning core needs were more often being met. Since the [[2008 economic crisis]], the survey describes a return, by some of the less optimistic Prospectors, to Settler values, perhaps as a result of resources being scarcer.

The table below&lt;ref name="cultdyn19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cultdyn.co.uk/ART067736u/new-electorate-voter-values_Oct2013_11359.pdf |format=PDF |title=IPPR Report : The New Electorate |publisher=Cultdyn.co.uk |accessdate=2015-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; tracks changes to the UK values composition over time. The increase in Prospector values between 2011 and 2012 is "hints at a hesitant return to optimism or perhaps a normalisation of austerity."&lt;ref name="cultdyn19"/&gt;

== Criticism and alternative approaches ==
The [[Common Cause Foundation]] set of "cultural values"] is seen by some as an alternative approach to Values Modes. A RSA (Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce) blog on the subject, written in February 2013&lt;ref&gt;https://www.thersa.org/discover/publications-and-articles/rsa-blogs/2013/02/understanding-your-values---a-group-exercise--new-uk-values-report&lt;/ref&gt;, described the Common Cause critique of Values Modes as being that "Rather than satiating that level of Maslow’s ‘Hierarchy of Needs’ – and thus prompting people move to new more globally compassionate, caring needs – Values Modes will just strengthen the values of selfish consumerism." Pat Dade, according to the blog, responded by saying that such an approach would "alienate many, perhaps even most of the UK population, who don’t enjoy the feeling of being lectured in worthy-sounding ''Guardian''-esque language, and rarely if ever change their behaviour as a result of it."

The '''Venus tablet of Ammisaduqa''' (''[[Enuma Anu Enlil]]'' Tablet 63) refers to the record of astronomical observations of [[Venus]], as preserved in numerous [[cuneiform]] [[clay tablet|tablet]]s dating from the first millennium BC. It is believed that this astronomical record was first compiled during the reign of King [[Ammisaduqa]] (or Ammizaduga), the fourth ruler after [[Hammurabi]]. Thus, the origins of this text should probably be dated to around the mid-seventeenth century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |first=Russell |last=Hobson |title=The Exact Transmission of Texts in the First Millennium B.C. |type=PhD thesis |publisher=[[University of Sydney]] |date=2009 |url=http://ses.library.usyd.edu.au/bitstream/2123/5404/1/r-hobson-2009-thesis.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; (according to the [[Middle Chronology]]).

The tablet recorded the rise times of [[Venus]] and its first and last visibility on the horizon before or after sunrise and sunset (the [[heliacal risings]] and settings of Venus) in the form of lunar dates. These observations are recorded for a period of 21 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=John David |last=North |author-link=John North (historian) |title=Cosmos: an illustrated history of astronomy and cosmology |publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] |date=2008 |page=41 |isbn=0-226-59441-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The sources==
This Venus tablet is part of ''[[Enuma anu enlil]]'' ("In the days of Anu and Enlil"), a long text dealing with [[Babylonian astrology]], which mostly consists of [[omen]]s interpreting celestial phenomena.

The earliest copy of this tablet to be published, a 7th-century BC [[Cuneiform script|cuneiform]],  part of the [[British Museum]] collections, was recovered from the [[Library of Ashurbanipal|library at Nineveh]]. It was first published in 1870 by Henry Creswicke Rawlinson and [[George Smith (assyriologist)|George Smith]] as ''Enuma Anu Enlil'' Tablet 63, in "Tablet of Movements of the Planet Venus and their Influences" (''The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia'', volume III).

As many as 20 copies of this text are currently on record, many of them fragmentary, falling into 6 groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Erica |last1=Reiner |author-link1=Erica Reiner |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Babylonian planetary omens |volume=Volume 3 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1998 |isbn=90-5693-011-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest of these copies is believed to be Source "B", found at [[Kish (Sumer)|Kish]] in 1924. It was copied from a tablet written at Babylon while [[Sargon II]] was King of [[Assyria]] between 720 and 704 BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Hermann |last1=Hunger |author-link1=Hermann Hunger |first2=David Edwin |last2=Pingree |author-link2=David Pingree |title=Astral sciences in Mesopotamia |series=Handbuch der Orientalistik |volume=Volume 44 |page=32 |publisher=[[Brill Publishers|Brill]] |date=1999 |isbn=90-04-10127-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
Several dates for the original observations, as contained in the tablet, were proposed early in the 20th century. The following dates, corresponding to the High, [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Middle]], [[Short chronology timeline|Low]] and [[Chronology of the ancient Near East|Ultra-Low Chronologies]], were inferred for the beginning of the Venus observations: [[1702 BC]], [[1646 BC]], [[1582 BC]], 1550 BC, respectively.

The tablet's significance for corroborating [[Babylonia]]n chronology was first recognised by [[Franz Xaver Kugler]] in 1912, when he succeeded in identifying the enigmatic "Year of the Golden Throne" ("Venus" tablet K.160) as potentially the 8th year of the reign of Ammisaduqa, based on one of his year names.

Since then, this 7th-century BC copy has been variously interpreted to support [[Chronology of the Ancient Orient|several chronologies]] in the [[2nd millennium BC]].

Many uncertainties remain about the interpretation of the record of astronomical observations of Venus, as preserved in these surviving tablets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |quote=We then discuss why the 56/64 year Venus cycle cannot be traced in the Venus Tablet and therefore cannot serve as an anchor for the search of chronologies. |last=Gurzadyan |first=V.

Problems of atmospheric refraction were addressed by [[Vahe Gurzadyan]] in a 2003 publication.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=V.

Also, the tables used to calculate the helical rising of Venus assume a rate at which the earth is slowing, a rate which is not certain, causing "clock-time errors".&lt;ref&gt;John D.

{{For|the railroad device|water crane}}
[[File:Pelagiczone.svg|thumb|160px|Deep sea water column]]

A '''water column''' is a conceptual column of water from the surface of a sea, river or lake to the bottom sediment.&lt;ref&gt;Munson, B.H., Axler, R., Hagley C., Host G., Merrick G., Richards C. (2004). "[http://waterontheweb.org/resources/glossary.html#W Glossary]". ''Water on the Web''. University of Minnesota-Duluth. Retrieved 27 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Descriptively, the deep sea water column is divided into five parts—''[[pelagic zone]]s'' (from Greek πέλαγος (pélagos), 'open sea')—from the surface to below the floor, as follows: ''[[epipelagic]]'', from the surface to 200 meters below the surface; ''[[mesopelagic]]'', from 200 to 1000 meters below the surface; ''[[bathypelagic]]'', from 1000 to 4000 meters below the surface; ''[[abyssopelagic]]'', from 4000 meters below the surface to the level sea floor; ''[[hadopelagic]]'', depressions and crevices below the level sea floor.

The concept of water column is useful since many aquatic phenomena are explained by the incomplete vertical mixing of chemical, physical or biological parameters.  For example, when studying the metabolism of [[Benthos|benthic organisms]], it is the specific bottom layer concentration of available [[chemical]]s in the water column that is meaningful, rather than the average value of those chemicals throughout the water column. 

Water columns are used chiefly for [[environmental science|environmental studies]] evaluating the [[Stratification (water)|stratification]] or mixing of the thermal or chemically stratified layers in a lake, stream or ocean: for example, by wind-induced currents. Some of the common parameters analyzed in the water column are [[pH]], [[turbidity]], [[temperature]], [[hydrostatic pressure]], [[salinity]], [[total dissolved solids]], various [[pesticide]]s, [[pathogen]]s and a wide variety of chemicals and [[biota (ecology)|biota]].

The term ''water column'' is also commonly used in [[scuba diving]] to describe the vertical space through which divers ascend and descend.

The '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' (F&amp;ES) is a [[professional school]] of [[Yale University]]. It was founded to train [[forester]]s, and now trains environmental leaders through four 2-year degree programs ([[Master of Environmental Management]], Master of [[Environmental Science]], Master of [[Forestry]], and Master of Forest Science) and two 10-month mid-career programs. Yale F&amp;ES strives to create new knowledge that will sustain and restore the health of the biosphere and emphasizes the possibility of creating a regenerative coexistence between humans and non-human life and the rest of the natural world. Still offering forestry instruction, the school has the oldest graduate forestry program in the United States.

==History==
[[File:Yale School of Forestry class of 1904.jpg|thumb|right|275px|Yale School of Forestry class of 1904]]
The school was founded in 1900 as the '''Yale Forest School''', to provide high-level forestry training suited to American conditions. At the urging of Yale alumnus [[Gifford Pinchot]], his parents endowed the two-year postgraduate program. At the time Pinchot was serving as [[Bernhard Fernow]]'s successor as Chief of the Division of Forestry (predecessor of the [[U.S. Forest Service]], USFS). Pinchot released two foresters from the division to start the school: fellow Yale graduate [[Henry Solon Graves]] and James Toumey.&lt;ref name=Sparhawk&gt;{{cite book |last=Sparhawk |first=W.N. |chapter=The History of Forestry in America |page=710 |title=Trees: Yearbook of Agriculture |year=1949 |location=Washington, D.C.  |publisher=[[United States Department of Agriculture]] |url= https://archive.org/stream/treesyearbookofa00unitrich |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graves became the School's first dean and Toumey its second.

When the school opened, other places in the United States offered forestry training, but none had a post-graduate program. (Both Pinchot and Graves had gone to Europe to study forestry after graduating from Yale.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Pinchot |first=Gifford |title=Breaking New Ground |year=1998 |publisher=Island Press |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n64aE9kblKMC&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPA152 |page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the fall of 1900, the [[New York State College of Forestry at Cornell]] had 24 students, [[Biltmore Forest School]] 9, and Yale 7.&lt;ref name="Sparhawk" /&gt; Despite its small size, from its beginnings the school influenced American forestry. The first two chiefs of the USFS were Pinchot and Graves; the next three were graduates from the school's first decade. Wilderness and land conservation advocate [[Aldo Leopold]] graduated in the class of 1908.

In 1915, Yale School of Forestry's second dean, James Toumey, became one of the "charter members", along with [[William L. Bray]] of the [[History of the New York State College of Forestry|New York State College of Forestry]], by then reestablished at [[Syracuse University]], and [[Raphael Zon]], of the [[Ecological Society of America]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esa.org/history/|title=You are being redirected...|author=|date=|website=esa.org|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1950, the "activist wing" of that society formed [[The Nature Conservancy]].&lt;ref name="esa.org"/&gt;

Besides the school's own forests, Yale has used a number of other sites in the eastern United States for field education over the years. From 1904 to 1926, the summer session leading to a master's degree in forestry was held at [[Grey Towers National Historic Site|Grey Towers]] and [[Forester's Hall]] in [[Milford, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref name="arch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce/SelectWelcome.asp |title=National Historic Landmarks &amp; National Register of Historic Places in Pennsylvania |publisher=CRGIS: Cultural Resources Geographic Information System |format=Searchable database}} ''Note:'' This includes {{cite web |url=https://www.dot7.state.pa.us/ce_imagery/phmc_scans/H050979_01H.pdf| title = National Register of Historic Places Inventory Nomination Form: Forester's Hall |accessdate=2012-05-30 |last1=Steiner |first1=Ben |last2=Husson |first2=Leon |last3=Helfrich |first3=Carson O. |format = PDF |date= December 1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1912, Yale classes took occasional field trips to the land of the Crossett Lumber Company in [[Arkansas]]. For two decades from 1946 until 1966, the company provided the school a "camp," including cabins and a mess hall, used during spring coursework on forest management and wood products production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |author1-last=Darling, Jr. |author1-first=O.

Reflective of the expanding variety of environmental interests, the school changed its name to the '''Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies''' in 1972. Today, F&amp;ES is a leader in global sustainability, hosting the bi-annual [http://yess.yale.edu Yale Environmental Sustainability Summit] to assemble thought leaders from around the globe. The school's 16th and present dean is [https://environment.yale.edu/profile/burke/ Ingrid "Indy" Burke], who replaced [[Peter Crane|Sir Peter Crane]] in October, 2016.&lt;ref name=Indy&gt;{{Citation | url   = http://news.yale.edu/2016/07/20/biogeochemist-indy-burke-named-dean-yale-s-school-forestry-environmental-studies | title = Biogeochemist Indy Burke named dean of Yale’s School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies | work  = YaleNews | publisher  = [[Yale University]] | accessdate = March 8, 2017 | ref = none}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school owns and manages {{convert|10880|acre|km2|0}} of forestland in [[Connecticut]], [[New Hampshire]], and [[Vermont]]. The [[Yale-Myers Forest]], in [[Union, Connecticut]], donated to Yale in 1930 by alumnus [[George Hewitt Myers]], is managed by the school as a multiple-use working forest. Yale-Toumey Forest, near [[Keene, New Hampshire]], was set up by James W. Toumey (a former dean of the school) in 1913. Other Yale forestlands include Goss Woods, Crowell Forest, Cross Woods, [[Bowen Forest]], and Crowell Ravine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://environment.yale.edu/forests/ |title=Yale School Forests |publisher=Yale School of Forestry &amp; Environmental Studies |accessdate=28 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A three-alarm fire burned several buildings within the Yale Myers Forest Camp on May 28th, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2016/05/29/fire-claims-four-fes-buildings/|title=Fire claims four F&amp;ES buildings|author=|date=|website=yaledailynews.com|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rebuilding efforts are ongoing.

== Student life ==
The school has an active tradition of student involvement in academic and extracurricular life. Many students take part in student interest groups, which organize events around environmental issues of interest to them. These groups range in interest from Conservation Finance and International Development, to the Built Environment and "Fresh &amp; Salty: The Society for Marine and Coastal systems". There are also social and recreational groups, such as the Forestry Club, which every Friday organizes themed "TGIF" ("Thank-God-I'm-a-Forester") happy hours and school parties; the Polar Bear club, which swims monthly in Long Island Sound under the full moon (year-round); Veggie Dinner, which is a weekly vegetarian dinner club; the Loggerrhythms, an a cappella singing group; and the student-run BYO Café in Kroon Hall opened in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Henderson |first=Drew |title=Kroon opens student café |newspaper=Yale Daily News |date=18 February 2010 |url=http://www.yaledailynews.com/news/2010/feb/18/kroon-opens-student-cafe/ |accessdate=29 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A notable F&amp;ES tradition is the extravagant environmentally inspired decoration of graduation caps in preparation for commencement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://environment.yale.edu/blog/2012/05/graduation-snapshots/|title=Graduation snapshots|author=|date=|website=environment.yale.edu|accessdate=21 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
